Need DL depth in general.    Campbell - 85% sure he makes the roster. We have no S depth now.    Mayle - 65% sure he makes the roster. Although we didn't get any big names, we have a lot of competition at the WR role. I think Mayle will make it though.    Gaines - 50% sure he makes it. He can be a special teams guy if nothing else, but there's a stronghold at CB right now.    Johnson - Makes the roster. He's our new FB most likely.    Telfer - 50% sure he makes it. Meeeeeeeeeh? He's a blocking TE and I'm not sure he'll make it considering we'll already have Dray/Housler/Barnidge.  Pullard - Makes the roster. Special teams.  Captain IEO - Heads to IR."

Browns,3e3q4n,KevinMack25,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"What doesn't make sense to me is Telfer. Maybe the FO thinks they picked up a hidden gem. But I keep hearing his foot surgery is going to keep him out until damn near the end of camp. To me, that could either mean they have no clue what they're going to do at TE and Telfer is better than the unknown, or they're really comfortable with Telfer and willing to roll the dice on him with a roster spot."
Browns,3e3q4n,Chiranthodendron,3,Tue Jul 21 21:40:00 2015 UTC,I feel like he'll be cut and put on the practice squad if they really have high hopes for him
Browns,3e3q4n,KevinMack25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"That is a great point. He'd be an ideal candidate for development. It's unlikely (I hope) that teams would offer him a contract while he's on the practice squad since most of his success was early in college and he's coming off of a surgery.   Personally, I like the risk in picking him. I just don't want another team to reap the benefits."
Browns,3e3q4n,surlysci,2,Tue Jul 21 23:39:58 2015 UTC,"I think Telfer may go on IR.  Or at least the half season IR, I forget what it's called.  Then they could have half a year to figure out if he should take up a roster spot or if we should try and sneak him to the practice squad.  It was definitely a weird pick though.  I guess it makes sense to take wild swings on guys in the 6th and 7th."

Browns,3e3550,ccavana3,13,Tue Jul 21 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"I'd rather somebody replace Schwartz. Most sacks given, hits given, and hurries. Greco really wasn't the problem last year and I think he's more serviceable than Schwartz"
Browns,3e3550,StewieBanana,6,Tue Jul 21 17:04:05 2015 UTC,"I agree that Schwartz is the line's weakest link. However, I don't think Erving is all that good as a tackle, which is why I think that our starting 5 remains the same as last year."
Browns,3e3550,Brokewood,6,Tue Jul 21 17:25:44 2015 UTC,Wasn't Bitonio originally a tackle?  Could it be possible they move him over to RT and put Erving at LG?  Or would they just not want to fuck around with something working as well as it does?
Browns,3e3550,JohnnyFire,11,Tue Jul 21 17:41:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't jeopardize the cohesion on that left side. They have a net +55.9 working together. That's insane.
Browns,3e3550,TemujinRi,3,Tue Jul 21 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"Now that's something I haven't considered. I assumed Bitonio was going to be out of play when we drafted him, so I didn't look at a whole lot of his college film. I did read that he shut down Barr when he played tackle though."
Browns,3e3550,iliekdrugs,7,Tue Jul 21 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"Greco's stat line does not match what I see on the field, and what I see on the field is...I mean, I can't name a game he doesn't get shoved on his ass or pushed backwards at least 5 yards from the line. And I don't know, is my dislike of Greco irrational because those bad plays tend to stick out? I suppose that's a fair assessment.  I think both Greco and Schwartz will need to be replaced in the near future; Greco benefitted from being next to Mack early on, and Schwartz is a 5th rounder drafted in the second, with stats to show. Erving provides a safety valve for both, as well as Mack.  But if everyone stays healthy and Erving competes, we're gonna be damn good in that spot."
Browns,3e3550,HWGBHWG,4,Tue Jul 21 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"And I don't know, is my dislike of Greco irrational because those bad plays tend to stick out?   Possibly, here's his game by game grading, which also shows that he was healthy enough to play every snap on offense.  http://i.imgur.com/4TGRnvx.png   I think both Greco and Schwartz will need to be replaced in the near future;    Agreed.   Greco benefitted from being next to Mack early on   The stats above show he had two weak games immediately after Mack's departure, but it looks like he adjusted quickly even if Nick fucking McDonald was playing next to him.   But if everyone stays healthy and Erving competes, we're gonna be damn good in that spot.   Hell yeah, and we're protected for when Mack bounces out."
Browns,3e3550,klax04,3,Tue Jul 21 17:31:52 2015 UTC,Please recall the game immediately after Macks' departure Greco started at Center.
Browns,3e3550,Brokewood,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, completely forgot that was the case. I wonder if Shanahan's ZBS was tough to grasp, because didn't he play some center before we had Mack and do really well?"
Browns,3e3550,kpyle,4,Tue Jul 21 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"We spent a first rounder on him, not crazy to expect contribution from him this year."
Browns,3e3550,bad_master,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"Erving is absolutely the plan for when Mack opts out and leaves, but you're telling me that a rookie is going to replace any of the 3 established starters at the interior line? Greco was the 7th best run blocking guard and 11th overall guard per PFF."
Browns,3e3550,holdingpp,4,Tue Jul 21 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"I don't WANT to dismiss Greco for Erving. I just think Erving is better, and will beat him out in camp... but if not, I don't care. Greco is strong as an Ox, so Erving is going to have to work his tail off to beat him out, especially considering the emphasis put on the run-game under Pettine. I just want the best possible combination on the o-line, no matter what the name on the back of the jersey is."
Browns,3e3550,bad_master,5,Tue Jul 21 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"Per PFF, Greco was ranked as the 7th best run blocking guard in the league. He was rated 27th out of 78 in pass blocking (above average)."
Browns,3e3550,LoLz14,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"If he is better he will play over him. Greco is a great backup to have since he can play any position on the line, and as we all saw last year we desperately need decent backups in case someone gets injured."

Browns,3e2k5e,jampge,17,Tue Jul 21 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"Meh, they had a bit of a meeting of the minds earlier in the off season.  I have a feeling that sideline interference like this was discussed and between this and the failure of Manziel and Gilbert to adapt to the NFL along with West's smaller attitude issues led to them deciding that Northcutt wasn't worth keeping around.  I don't know if this is a power struggle as much as Farmer admitting his mistakes and trying to move on.  If Northcutt was central to a lot of these issues then he definitely needed to go for real improvement to happen."
Browns,3e2k5e,miked1be,11,Tue Jul 21 13:53:53 2015 UTC,"If the allegations in the article are true, then this looks like a really positive move for the organization. There wasn't any compartmentalization last year, and it showed with the texting debacle and the draft first round shitshow.  Farmer appears to be a decent judge of talent, and Pettine a decent coach. If there's no overstepping of bounds, I think this team could really turn around if we get our QB next year."
Browns,3e2k5e,fuckingbrowns,5,Tue Jul 21 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, they really just need to get through the growing pains and learn their roles without overstepping.  If they can do that soon enough to keep their jobs we should be set.  It's rough that Haslam, Farmer, and Pettine are all learning this stuff as they go without at least one of them being a veteran at their job but I guess the other alternative is a retread that failed elsewhere so who knows what the lesser of the evils is there."
Browns,3e2k5e,miked1be,6,Tue Jul 21 14:59:55 2015 UTC,I don't know if this is a power struggle    But that doesn't create clicks for Grossi

Browns,3e2k5e,bigdump,9,Tue Jul 21 13:57:56 2015 UTC,"I think there's SOME truth to this, as in there was a degree of a power struggle last season.  The texting kind of solidifies that.  But his firing and Farmer's apparent safe bet drafting style this season makes it look like they're all making changes to butt out of each other's responsibilities.  Alleged drafting of Manziel by Haslam and Gilbert by Pettine coming to an end and Farmer getting rid of his sideline nuisance could all be concessions made by them in the meeting they had earlier in the off season.  Was there a power struggle of some sort?  Almost definitely.  Is Northcutt's firing an indication of that struggle going strong right now?  It could very well be a sign that it's coming to an end."
Browns,3e2k5e,miked1be,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:31 2015 UTC,"Never heard of Gilbert being Pettine's pick, but it makes some sense."
Browns,3e2k5e,EL1CASH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"Nobody was necessarily any one particular person's pick.  However, Pettine really wanted him.    The day after the 2014 draft I was listening to radio interviews with the FO, which also included some audio from the calls to the players when they were getting selected.  When they called Gilbert, Pettine was the first to speak to him and basically said (paraphrasing since I don't have the direct quote to link to): ""I told these guys I'd do a flip off of the table if we picked you"".  So it's obvious that Pettine really liked him, but also, that it wasn't his sole decision to make."

Browns,3e2k5e,TemujinRi,5,Tue Jul 21 23:18:07 2015 UTC,"What happened as best I can tell is this:  Haslam wanted to do the typical ""slam dunk"" strategy rather than building up something. And think about it; if Gilbert stepped in and played amazing and Manziel had met his potential quickly, our opinions on the 2014 class are extremely different. But it's not just a matter of ""get exciting players"" as Farmer was (likely) coerced into doing; it's a matter of getting exciting players that fit and make sense.  So we've changed the strategy; now we're building the trenches, developing a strong defense and seeing if what we got in 2014 is going to work in any way in the meantime. But I think what happened in the midst of 2014 was that Haslam, Farmer, and Pettine all kind of had a different vision for things; now they need to get on the same page, and based on how the draft played out this year, I think they were. Future planning, getting high character guys, adding depth on both lines, that's what good teams do to build.  I don't see this much more as a power struggle as I do seeing a second year owner with a first year HC and a first year GM breaking themselves into the fold and making some (still rectifiable) mistakes. They made the mistakes, they have to live with those mistakes, and now they need to move forward and cut bait with those (like Northcutt and Shanahan, among others) that can't follow a potentially collective vision."
Browns,3e2k5e,JohnnyFire,4,Tue Jul 21 14:23:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really don't see how Northcutt's firing could be seen as a negative and sign of a power struggle that's still going strong.  He worked for Farmer so it's very likely that Farmer was involved in the decision to fire him, that tells me that this is most likely a decision made as a concession to help move things in the right direction.  I guess Pettine could have talked Haslam into firing Northcutt behind Farmer's back but I doubt that.  Haslam has been high on Farmer from the beginning and I really don't see him doing that without Farmer's agreement."
Browns,3e2k5e,miked1be,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:30:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see this much more as a power struggle   power struggle was in the coach playing the players he wanted and not what ownership/GM wanted.    Thing is, there is no power struggle anymore.  Pettine is safe this year no matter what.  If the players that Farmer brought in (Bowe, McCown, Hartline) fail miserably, his job will be in question, but Pettine's won't.  So no struggle for power at all, its firmly in Pettine's hands."
Browns,3e2k5e,java-beans,5,Tue Jul 21 14:52:04 2015 UTC,"If the players that Farmer brought in (Bowe, McCown, Hartline) fail miserably, his job will be in question   I highly doubt that his FA acquisitions will be what defines his job security; if that's the case he should just quit now. He's shown that he can draft really well in the late rounds. If his late picks do well this year too, then I think he's safe."
Browns,3e2k5e,fuckingbrowns,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:08 2015 UTC,You're responding to msh / djroomba / dota / etc...  so I'd say it's pretty obvious as to why those specific players were mentioned.

I like Ken though, but I don't really think Ken's style fits well with Kiley's.  I listen considerably less now that Chuck is gone."
Browns,3dxyjz,AntsInMyMouth,3,Mon Jul 20 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"Really? I think Kiley and Ken are a lot more listenable now than Kiley and Booms. Kevin actually says some really funny shit some days, he's just crass. He has a very dry sense of humor but the dude has me rolling sometimes."
Browns,3dxyjz,clycloptopus,2,Mon Jul 20 21:18:32 2015 UTC,Tall Boy Fridays were the best. Gotta pour one out for those.
Browns,3dxyjz,pfftYeahRight,6,Tue Jul 21 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"This is a dual-edged sword, because Ken did really well leading the train in afternoons. But it might still be really good: I remember seeing a lot saying Kevin ""New York Yankees #1 Fan"" Kiley might be on his way out once his contract runs up, meaning Ken could get free reign when that occurs.  This is awesome though; finally a reason to actually listen consistently to the morning show again, because now only one of the two on there is a trainwreck in waiting. And they did push that some of Ken's bits from the late night show will be coming to the mornings (DEAD WRESTLER TRIVIA?!) so we'll see how that goes."
Browns,3dxyjz,yeathatsnice,4,Mon Jul 20 13:24:37 2015 UTC,When does Kiley's contract run through?  I likely won't listen till then.  That dude put's me in a grumpy mood on the way to work just listening to him.  Glad Ken's there... it's a start.

Morning  stuff is usually a recap of yesterdays actual news and then some talk instead of the free form stuff that make Ken great. He and the rest of his crew work well together and are given a bit more leeway in how they do their show compared to what is acceptable in the mornings. Hope he does well and the show is great, but I am going to miss him doing Tall Boys Fridays."

Browns,3dxyjz,rodion_kjd,6,Mon Jul 20 13:47:44 2015 UTC,Have you heard Kiley interview guests?  It's beyond awkward.  He uniquely combines being condescending and combative with a general lack of knowledge of the subject at hand.

Schwartz got pushed back into the pocket pretty far, Bitonio got fucking worked, and he was staring down the barrel of a hurting, it was also his first start and he's admitted that he didn't properly study/prepare.  (Which by all accounts from teammates, he has changed for the better...even earning praise from Whitner)   We had an offensive coordinator who I wouldn't trust to call strategies in Red Alert, let alone an NFL game, and on top of everything else we were facing a very good defense that was playing with a massive chip on their shoulders.   Overall, I'm not worried about it. His decision making will become better in time and I'm sure it helps having a semi-competent veteran to learn from."

Browns,3dy9l2,Bphill73,5,Mon Jul 20 19:33:32 2015 UTC,"2.) Patrick Peterson  Despite the rough year, Peterson remains one of the most talented corners in the NFL. He is still the prototypical cover corner, at 6-foot-1 and 219 pounds with electrifying speed. He was relieved of his punt return duties, but he showed that he retained his skills with the ball in his hands in a Week 6 pick six, the first of his career. His ability to follow the number one receiver is truly special and it allows the defense to play to their strengths. As a former first-round pick, expectations were high from the start. He was lived up to them, showing he is one of the better corners in the league, but he will have to play with more consistency.   Who are you quoting? I don't see the word elite anywhere."

Browns,3dy9l2,AKlep,0,Mon Jul 20 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"I would almost be inclined to put Bitonio in there instead of Mack. Obviously Mack has the longer track record, but I don't think any of Mack's seasons were as good as Bitonio's rookie year. Dude was an absolute monster. Can't really go wrong with either though."
Browns,3dy9l2,miked1be,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"True, you have to account for consistency there though too.  Hard to put a 1 year player on this list when we haven't seen how he is for the long haul while Mack hasn't missed a snap until he broke his leg, not even when he had his appendix removed during a bye week."
Browns,3dy9l2,AKlep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:09:08 2015 UTC,Valid points. I really think Bitonio is going to be elite for a long time and help anchor the left side with Thomas.
Browns,3dyz3y,Clevelantis,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:03 2015 UTC,Call the Cleveland Browns front office or the management company for the stadium. One of those 2 entities will be able to tell you how to go about this.

While they're nice, for the prices I will never see them again, and the cost to regular people is there is no longer the two public bars as they are now club access only (some of the pictures are from inside the old Brownstown bar), which to me is shady as fuck, but it is what it is.  As far as other stuff going on, there's new artwork up in the lower concourse and as you can see they tiled the concession fronts with orange and brown tiles, which looks really nice."

Browns,3dme3x,ltshinysides,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"Yea, club seems pretty legit, there's different prices ranging from like $3500 to $7000 per seat, plus the actual game tickets, that seems to get you cool stuff, extended hours, private entrance, food/drink and what not.

Yeah y'all traded up for Manziel, which was crazy. That means the Browns were likely on board with Manziel the whole time. It made for a flashier pick than Bridgewater, but I guess they overlooked Manziel's flaws."

First I think Gabriel is going to be the 5th option with either Bowe or Hartline as the WR2, then Hawkins as WR3, then either Bowe or Hartline whoever isn't WR2.

Browns,3dnnf0,NolaBrownsFan,2,Fri Jul 17 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"I see Greco as the weakest but that's just my personal opinion, and even if Schwartz is the weakest I think since Erving is better at Guard he should play that position and with a much better player at guard it would help out on that right side making Schwartz's job easier and proving to people that he isn't that bad. Also I feel like if they wanted to replace Schwartz they would have drafted a pure tackle to make the transition easier."

Rice worked with the current Browns RB/OL coaches in Baltimore. If/when it happens, it'll be after camp starts so it's not the only thing on the news.  I think the Browns would be content with Rice or another vet, Winston, and Johnson, with Johnson being used this season similar to Darren Sproles when Sproles was in San Diego. Winston doesn't look fast enough for the NFL imo.  West grew up idolizing Rice. If Rice signs, maybe it would help West."

Browns,3dieq6,DeLuca2400,3,Thu Jul 16 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"I usually park near the college stadium. A bit of a walk, but I've usually always found a space.   Every year I get excited, and then kinda feel let down. You can't see worth shit. It's way too damn crowded. I wish they'd move it to a college like they did long ago. Or at least put up some bleachers and try to make it comfortable.   I'll still go this year. I'm even pumped for it."
Browns,3dieq6,24rubikscube,2,Thu Jul 16 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah so I went to college at BW.  Some advice, they don't ticket on weekends and beech st. south of bagley has lots of space for street parking.  Seminary too. Daisy st and that entire area northwest of Bagley & Front (polish village it is called).    Edit: FWIW street parking in Berea is free and legal at all times before 3am, so anywhere in town not right next to the complex is fair game"
Browns,3dieq6,cubert2,2,Thu Jul 16 19:32:35 2015 UTC,"I took my 4 year old daughter to last year's. There are a few different things for kids to do. My daughter enjoyed it for the most part but it was EXTREMELY hot the day we went so she was ready to go after like 2 hours. It was hard at times for her to see the actual practice stuff due to the number of people and where we were actually able to get a sit/seating spot. If she has very little interest in football, it may not be desirable for her. There was a few inflatables, a football throwing thing and a few little games from sponsors and that was about it. The lines weren't too bad for these things but it's definitely nothing she'd be missing out on if she didn't go. If you did go early enough and manage to get a great spot by the facility exit where the players go in and out, she may be able to score you some sweet pics and autographs but those spots are the first to go and I don't know what time you'd have to get there to be able to score those spots. I want to go again for myself this year during a weekday when it is less crowded."

Browns,3djglg,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,6,Fri Jul 17 03:43:55 2015 UTC,"Step 1) Get absolutely hyped. Get you hopes up for the game. Imagine Joe getting a minimum of three pick 6's. Know in your heart that the Crow is stampeding in for a score or two. Mainly forget about the past and don't let the phrase ""typical browns"" enter your pretty little head. The more psyched you are the more fun you're going to have.  Step 2) Buy more beer than you can drink so that you have some to offer to the friends you're going to make in the muni-lot. (Cleveland loves Great Lakes. If you want to make some life long friends then have some handy) Step 3) Go to the muni-lot and do what Browns fans do best. Don't be afraid to talk to anyone.. You're all a big brown family on game day. Don't be afraid to talk a little fun trash to some Ravens fans either as long as you say it with a smile and in good taste.  Step 4) Watch our Brownies run a train on silly ole Joe Flaco and company. Celebrate accordingly. And don't forget to say a prayer to the Great Pettine before bed."
Browns,3djglg,undersized-koala,3,Thu Jul 16 21:54:55 2015 UTC,That....that was magnificent
Browns,3djglg,HiiBillyMaysHere,3,Fri Jul 17 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"If you want the ""genuine experience"", get to the lot early as fuck and tailgate in the Muni Lot with the rest of the crazy folks. Bring a 12-pack or two decent 6-packs, post up, and do what you gotta do.  If you don't want to deal with some of the loons however, try parking closer to East 6th or 9th, and then go get Barocco and hit the bars around there pre-game. As this is MNF, I'm assuming it should be a bit tougher in and out of the city, so do what you gotta do.  Outside of game-day, plenty of things to do. If you like beer and brews, hit West 25th; go to Market Garden, Town Hall, Corner Pub, Great Lakes Brewing, all of it. Hit East 4th; Zocalos, Butcher and Brewer, Greenhouse Tavern, Flannerys, Harry Buffalo. Check out the Casino as much as you can stand. Cleveland Chop is decent. If you get itching for more, drive down Detroit on the West side for 16-Bit Bar, Melt (seriously, just get to Melt), and more bars/dining options. Hit even further West for a few other options out in Lakewood. If you go Southeast, try Michael Symon's B-Spot, Burntwood Tavern, and Hunan in the Beachwood/Chagrin Falls area. Go even further east to Downtown Willoughby for Willoughby Brewing Company and a decent bar crawl.  In-stadium, they have ANOTHER B-Spot on the upper levels if you have time to kill pre-game. Really, I have no idea which seats are ""best"", but I'm sure for that game, anywhere will be fine."
Browns,3djglg,JohnnyFire,2,Thu Jul 16 21:05:04 2015 UTC,"How early do you really have to get to the Muni for MNF though?  They don't open the lot until 12pm for TNF, I expect MNF to be the same, no?  Spot on with the suggestions though!"
Browns,3djglg,iliekdrugs,2,Fri Jul 17 00:54:22 2015 UTC,"Drove by there this weekend, and saw a new sign.  ""Muni Lot opens 6 hours before gametime""     But, for MNF, the lot will be full of downtown workers, so who knows what time you can get in there and set up."

Browns,3dk16b,Wookie_Goldberg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:58:56 2015 UTC,So is there any reason to buy from nflshop or fansedge when you're basically just buying form fanatics.com? Any reason why you would order from one other than another?
Browns,3dk16b,Wookie_Goldberg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"Fanatics has flat rate shipping at $4.99 and NFL Shop has variable shipping. You can only get customs on NFL Shop. Other than that it's the same. Both have fancash, and the free shipping is a separate wing of Fanatics Inc. It's called Shoprunner, and is run on all Fanatic sites. They have amazon style robotic warehouses all over the country.  Fansedge is probably the best. They offer 365 day returns and flat rate $4.99 shipping. Fanatics and NFL Shop have 60 day returns. No customs on Fansedge, though.  Some others are rallyhouse, sportsfanfare, and fanzz. Those aren't owned by Fanatics."

Browns,3decbh,batardo,2,Wed Jul 15 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"They'll wait until 2016 for sure. The Browns technically were established in 1945, but the key thing in anniversaries like this is when they started playing."
Browns,3de6vy,applecrunchme,2,Wed Jul 15 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"Before the Cincinnati start last year I was pumping myself up by watching JFF highlights on youtube and quickly found myself concerned because there were a ton of runs and scrambles off broken plays that everyone knows wouldn't work in the NFL and a fair amount of floating a football up for Mike Evans to make a great catch over some CB that is probably bagging groceries now.   However there were some good pocket throws, he did show some great accuracy and really the highlights I find most encouraging are from the Buffalo game. He showed legitimate zip and accuracy, NFL quality. Now he didn't sustain that in his starts, but he possesses it for sure. Just needs to figure out how to consistently display it in a game."
Browns,3de6vy,St0ckt0nS,0,Wed Jul 15 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"Only the most adamant Manziel haters question Manziel's physical abilities. Everyone know the dude can throw. The question has always been can his mental and emotional game match his physical potential.   I'm with you though, I think he still has a good chance to be an above average to solid QB."
Browns,3de6vy,Marzman315,6,Wed Jul 15 16:35:58 2015 UTC,"his size is a legitimate concern, but his arm strength is w/o question better than Hoyers was, it's above avg for the NFL"
Browns,3de6vy,Abiv23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:52:10 2015 UTC,an above average to solid QB.   Which is what Cleveland hasn't had in forever... Honestly Jake Delhomme was the last one that I think would fall into that category. Maybe Kelly Holcomb?
Browns,3df879,JohnnyFire,17,Wed Jul 15 20:19:56 2015 UTC,Add this to the reasons to not simply cut Josh Gordon.
Browns,3df879,Witness_My_Greatness,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:38:55 2015 UTC,I understand what you're saying but with Gordon's issues he's not getting anywhere near that.

Browns,3df879,Abiv23,7,Thu Jul 16 16:22:42 2015 UTC,I understand what you're saying but with Gordon's issues he's not getting anywhere near that the field.
Browns,3df879,Witness_My_Greatness,5,Wed Jul 15 21:04:09 2015 UTC,It's a waste of money to sign a WR to that kind of contract.
Browns,3df879,jampge,3,Thu Jul 16 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"I'd rather we worry about getting our QB problems sorted out before we worry about trying to sign a top-tier WR.  If we signed a top WR we would be spending somewhere between $14M and $28M for the year or two in which we'd have a QB still learning the ropes and unable to fully utilize their talents.  In the mean time, we'll hopefully have Josh Gordon back on the field with one year left as a rookie and if he loses his appeal we can tender him as an RFA for another cheap year."
Browns,3df879,admiralkit,2,Thu Jul 16 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Except for the fact that contracts get more expensive each year, and the fact that it always costs more to sign players in free agency than it does to resign your own players."

Just wait to see what their new TV deal will come to.   I don't think it is good for the game (or any of the sports), for the fans sake. Its just going to make cable packages more expensive, as well as ticket sales."
Browns,3de2pz,matthewjam96,13,Wed Jul 15 15:29:23 2015 UTC,i could see Joe Haden making the cover at some point

Browns,3de2pz,Stoopid-Stoner,9,Thu Jul 16 05:52:18 2015 UTC,That cover art was sick. Burly ass white dude. Brett Farve just looked scared in his cover. But Hillis definitely was the sadsack of the madden cover fraternity. Daunte Caulpepper and Vince Young as close seconds lol.  I dont have a problem with the Peyton Hillis legacy. It was sad that it ended so quickly - I think its more of his agent's fault than his.
Browns,3de2pz,Kylekub,9,Wed Jul 15 15:41:26 2015 UTC,"It was a fun ride while it lasted, and this cover was the culmination of all that."

And Peyton Hillis was an absolute beast the season before and it was really awesome that the fans were able to vote him onto the cover. It sucks that Hillis never ended up being what we hoped, but I still think its awesome that he was on there. And plus, Madden 12 is arguably the best Madden released on that generation of consoles, so it couldn't get much better."

You're too young to remember watching them move, yes, all you know is crappy football, but it could be worse. Your first memories could all be of coming SO close to the Super Bowl in 86,87,89.

You can also put crackers into it to make the dogfood flavor a bit more salty.  Here are some people from outside of Ohio eating Skyline Chili.  Here is a list of states ranked by signature food. Guess where Ohio is ranked thanks to this abomination.  The first time I had Skyline Chili, I was in college, and I thought it was delicious. As it turns out, it was the only food place that was open in my college town at 230am. Upon going there sober the following week, I learned that ANYTHING tastes good when you're drunk and high and hungry at 230 in the morning.  Skyline Chili fucking sucks, and is representative of the entire city of Cincinnati.  The only good things to come out of Cincinnati are Graeters and Rhinegeist."

Browns,3d5w9i,DrLawyerson,2,Tue Jul 14 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah. This upcoming draft (I can't fucking believe I'm talking about this already :-!) is going to be really odd for the Browns, if everything pans out.  If the ""On-paper-should-be-fucking-awesome"" defense actually plays out, and if the pieces on offense we know should do okay actually do okay (that being Thomas/Bitonio/Mack/Erving, and we can keep Mack in the fold), the only holes that would be notable would be adding one more offensive lineman, WR, TE, and QB. And the field appears to be stacked on the O-Line, have some interesting WR prospects, a few silently okay TE's, and a QB class potentially rivaling 2004 and 2012 in terms of depth.  I guess the point is now is that if the Browns have all things in order, we may not need to go out and take a Bosa or an Oakman or a Nkemdiche in the first round again. We might be able to roll the dice on a dynamic WR (Treadwell, Duke Williams, Pharaoh Cooper, Marquez North, or Quinshad ""Deserves Better"" Davis). We could take the best OT on the board (Stanley, Tunsil, Dragon, Decker). We could even snag a second round QB if we feel there is depth (guys like Kessler, Towels, or my current potential later-round-steal favorite, Gunner Kiel) or even grab the best QB available (please be Jared Goff, holy fuck Farmer, get me Jared Goff, I am starting this bandwagon now, I like Cook and Hack and Jones, but get me Jared Goff if you're doing this in the first)  ...I guess what I'm saying is, there's options. And good ones...I hope. Even if the Browns managed to swing something like Duke Williams and Gunner Kiel in their first two picks for example, I think you can instantly argue the team is in position to turn the corner. And again, that depends on what we get out of Manziel in 2015."

There is no realistic situation where it would be worth it."

Browns,3d8btf,740Buckeye,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"Not a trade, no.  However, keep in mind what's coming in 2015; if Dez doesn't get tied up, and DT doesn't get tied up, those two and AJ Green and Julio Jones and Alshon Jeffrey will all likely enter the market as UFA (if they don't get franchised; likely Jones will, but Green and Jeffrey might not).  We have absolutely no chance in signing them, nor will we offer them a shitballs worth of money, but hey, force these other teams to work their own pocket books at the least."

Browns,3d0s9a,NuffNuffHoldTheFluff,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:52:24 2015 UTC,They'll probably design a Joe Haden P.E. (Player Edition) of one of their Jordan cleats for him to wear this season. Unlikely they make a custom Joe Haden shoe that's exclusively designed for him and sold to the public.
Browns,3d0s9a,scsmith83,9,Mon Jul 13 15:59:00 2015 UTC,Joe loves shoes so much that the Hadens are going to be amazing. Calling it now - Haden will read a screen this season and make a 1 handed INT legs spread air Jordan style resulting in 6.
Browns,3d0s9a,TemujinRi,4,Sun Jul 12 21:20:16 2015 UTC,This is probably a big deal to Joe seeing as he's such an avid shoe collector and all.  So congrats to him.

Browns,3cymm1,Abiv23,-2,Tue Jul 14 16:20:12 2015 UTC,That was what I was watching. He stumbled running a route in practice with nobody covering him
Browns,3cymm1,Illinois_Jones,8,Sun Jul 12 02:25:39 2015 UTC,You can take away as much from him stumbling as you can from him making the one hand catch. Neither really means anything in a random clip on his Instagram. At least he is committed to learning the position.
Browns,3cymm1,rackemrackem,7,Sun Jul 12 05:40:56 2015 UTC,I agree.  There's really nothing too special about this clip except that he seems to be working his ass off trying to learn the position.  Which still is pretty sick.

If McCown had come in for 2014 instead of Hoyer, it would have been a far superior setup for all involved. The Browns failed to put an effective veteran above Manziel, and it fed a media craze because there was a legitimate QB controversy in the eyes of the public. Manziel is a star, though he needs some time to develop. Flutie comes to mind (I obviously mean this positively). Let him learn the game. But it's definitely saying something if he can't beat out McCown."

He always seems to be able to find a little open space if he can get past the line, which in our scheme could be huge. I do think Duke Johnson take's a bunch of carries from him and Twest but if our offensive line can get him some space downfield this year more instead of collapsing in the backfield I think he could have a big year."
Browns,3cycs8,Rectalcactus,2,Sun Jul 12 23:24:52 2015 UTC,"His rookie season was marred with our deteriorated O-line. The guy is prolific, but he needs help. Let's hope we can do it this year."
Browns,3cycs8,JesteroftheApocalyps,2,Tue Jul 14 03:30:33 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested in seeing the same stats in splits of with and without Alex Mack in the starting lineup. I know our entire offense sputtered after the injury. I would tend to believe that with him he got hit in the backfield less often, and broke off a higher percentage of 10+ yard runs per attempt than without him. Thus the additions of Mack and Erving and Bowie this year will only propel him to be a better back for us."
Browns,3cy4rj,KevinMack25,2,Sat Jul 11 20:53:04 2015 UTC,"I am glad he added some context to these numbers since it is a difficult stat to really understand when it is posted on it's own. We really are a good tackling team overall. Kruger is really the only one who was poor at tackling last year, and even then he was double teamed often due to our lack of NT so his numbers should drop.   Tackling is not a problem for our defense. Getting sacks and stopping the run by closing gaps has been the problem. Hopefully our newly drafted guys, and getting injured players back, can help out and take pressure off the LBs so they can attack the gaps and the QB."

The Cowboys are the best fans because the Cowboys charge their fans the most."

I've been looking for a good seller for the new jerseys, but none seemed to have mastered it. A lot of them use the orange from the old jerseys. There's another seller (2015 Jerseys Online) that has a little better rating, and enough orders to know feedback. His apparently aren't perfect either though.   It just seems like a tough jersey to make. If they'd learn overseas that we changed the orange. The strings don't bother me. Easy to fix.  There's Pro Bowl jerseys for sale that have good ratings and pics in the feedback. I've thought about getting a Haden Pro Bowl jersey until a good Browns jersey is available.  Don't beat yourself up.

Browns,3ct0bg,Mustang1718,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:17:48 2015 UTC,Interesting. I would have imagined him with a 10-19 number so he could be eligible to play as our emergency third QB. Having #87 doesn't him to do that.
Browns,3ct0bg,blackedout,23,Fri Jul 10 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"That's not how the rule worked, also there is no 3rd string QB rule any longer. If our 3 QBs couldn't play, we can have anyone play QB, whomever is our emergency QB is likely designated by the team, but it doesn't really matter to the NFL what number they wear. If Pryor is on the roster as a WR, he has a WR number. Period. There is no roster slot or number rule for an ""emergency QB""."
Browns,3ct0bg,Mustang1718,5,Fri Jul 10 15:42:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't know that. It does make a ton of sense though.  I guess I meant ""emergency"" as more of a soft meaning of QB3 rather than the actual definition of a player out of position to finish the game with the other QBs who dressed are unable to play. My mistake."
Browns,3ct0bg,blackedout,3,Fri Jul 10 16:08:17 2015 UTC,No worries! The league used to have that old QB3 rule until they added an extra roster slot to all teams.

Browns,3ctagy,Daviroth,4,Sat Jul 11 11:34:04 2015 UTC,I just think that if basketball players like jimmy graham and Jordan Cameron can transition from mainly college basketball players to play TE in the NFL so seemingly easily then I don't see why Pryor can't transition from QB to WR.
Browns,3ctagy,sponslerm,3,Fri Jul 10 20:15:55 2015 UTC,What makes you think it easy? How many people wash out of basketball? How many of those people make NFL rosters? How many of those people get a starting job?

Until recently the Browns have always had a receiver or two that doesn't belong on an NFL roster. Sometimes it's been our top 2 guys.
Browns,3ctagy,elessarjd,2,Sat Jul 11 08:35:58 2015 UTC,"my assessment from a football perspective.  these are his workout highlights.  he is trying to build his nfl resume.  this was probably 1/20th of the actual work put in.  we did not get to see all the bad reps.  that being said, he appears fast and a natural carcher of the football.  he does seem to struggle with getting out of breaks quickly but most big guys do.  more time at the position will help."

As a CB/FS, the only part we ever learned about was our specific roles. So we would what our coverage assignment would be, but not what the rest of the team was doing. This post shows exactly how important that is.  This went on with the offensive side of the ball as well. We would learn about route compliments such as post/corner or curl/flat type stuff, but not the play as a whole explaining what defenders were getting pressure put on them or what routes become important in a man or zone read by the QB.   If this would have happened, I would have prevented my most embarrassing play where I bit on a deep drag when a post snuck behind me in either Cover 2 or Cover 3 (this was like 7-9 years ago and I don't fully remember) while I was playing as a FS. Only semi-recently have I learned the weak spots in coverage as well which would have pointed me to look for the post.  Anyway, enough with my anecdotes and ramblings. Keep these posts coming!

To Mike’s point: He’s cut his teeth in this league on defense. Fix that defense and keep the score down. The offense will catch up.”   THANK YOU GOD.  It sucks that we probably aren't going to go from shit to Super Bowl overnight, but I want to build a winner, and building a winner means get the defense strong and the trenches strong first, and then catch everything up in the meantime. Yes, we are still missing a few pieces on offense, but if this draft actually plays out like it seemingly did, the Browns will finally have a dominant D to work with.

Browns,3cpo3p,Dusty_Dionne,2,Fri Jul 10 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"I hope, if this year is another middle of the road year or bad year, and the defense is completely solved and figured out and top tier, with how our offensive line is looking to be top tier, that Pettine and Farmer get the kind of deal that Carrol and Whoever-The-Seahawks-GM-Is and get to go an actual 3rd or 4th year.  2 years isn't nearly enough for a coach to take a team and turn it into what he knows can win for him."
Browns,3cpo3p,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,2,Thu Jul 9 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"I mean, ideally the defense this season looks as solid in action as it does on paper. At that point, okay, maybe the offense sucked and we went 6-10, but it's now obvious what pieces are left (I'd assume QB and WR). Fit those positions into BPA drafting and make it work."
Browns,3cpo3p,JohnnyFire,-1,Fri Jul 10 01:57:15 2015 UTC,"Except it doesn't really work that way.  2016 Free agents:  Taylor, Gipson, Robertson, Housler, Gordon, Schwartz, Winn, Bademosi, Kitchen, Barnidge, Solomon.  Not to mention any actual free agents we'll need to sign.  Not to mention if our QB situation is still in flux.  Not to mention Mack, or the 2-4 WR/TE's we'll need to even start fixing the offense.  It isn't like we will be able to say ""Whelp! Defense is fixed! next group!""   You should be trying to win every year, trying to resign your guys.  That's the whole point of building.  Right now, we're letting our homegrown guys go, which completely defeats the purpose of building."
Browns,3cpo3p,-dota-,2,Fri Jul 10 12:24:51 2015 UTC,"Taylor won't be resigned. Too injured and useless.  Gipson will probably get a big contract. If not, yeah, I won't be happy.  I'd assume we try to lowball an offer to Robertson, but we have some LB depth as of now; just got to make sure we keep that up in drafting.  Housler...okay? We'll see what he does but I could honestly care less if he plays below par?  We'll still own Gordon iirc if he doesn't play a snap. Not sure though.  Schwartz sucks. I know it's fun to point out his improvements in 2014, but he's a 5th round pick who was picked in the 2nd round and plays like a 5th rounder. Part of the reason you get Erving is to add depth to this line so we can afford to part with a sub-par OT.  Winn will be resigned at low cost. Same with Bademosi, same with Kitchen. And frankly, keeping any of them, as far as I'm concerned, is not going to be where the Browns live or die.  Barnidge I would like to resign, but I understand if he leaves. I'd hope our new TE (Tefler) is going to move into the blocker role anyway.  Solomon is whatever. I don't think anyone knows how he'll actually pan out yet, so I'm not worried.  If Mack leaves, that is why we got Erving. If he doesn't want to be here, we can't keep him here. His agent is a bit of a rat in that regard and to his credit, he got the exact contract that all agents want, one which benefits him and his client a shit-ton. It's a fault of the old regime backing us into that corner.  So even if we lose, say, Housler/Taylor/Schwartz/Gipson and keep the rest, okay, then we need to find a low-end DT/DE, a TE, and ensure that Erving fills the RT role appropriately. So that leaves the biggest holes still at QB, WR, TE. We would know what we need to draft. You can't fix all the problems at once, because it is, you know, a process, and it's not like we're actively killing this team in the meantime by working with the bounds of what we have and what we are."

You: ""Well, the defensive line is okay, but that doesn't mean our offense is good and our QB situation is god awful.""  One person: But the defense--  You: ""You're just going to ignore the offensive problems? Gloss over all the issues this franchise has with it's WR's and QB?""  One person: ...no, we're talking about the defensive line. And with that said, I'm excited to see--  You: ""We're probably not going to be able to resign all of them, just so you know. It's all Farmer's fault because he didn't draft well. Now this team is fucked because they're one dimensional, and you need to look at the facts.""  Other person: ...what? Dude, stop trying to start shit.  You: ""YOU THINK I'M STARTING SHIT? HOW HYPOCRITICAL AND IRONIC. I SPEAK NOTHING BUT FACTS.""  Saying that you cite ""facts"" doesn't make it a good argument."

Browns,3cpo3p,miked1be,-1,Sat Jul 11 06:46:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with most things you said but:  Winn, Bademosi and Kitchen aren't all going to be cheap, and I really think you're underplaying their value.  And it will be more evident this season.  I think Solomon will be included in this as well, but that's just my optimism.   If Mack leaves, that is why we got Erving.   Right, but he's played zero snaps, and we have no idea if he's actually good or not. And we still have to fill Schwartz position, so its not like we haven't addressed this.  And you completely glossed over our entire secondary, which is still a pretty big question mark.  We may have some players there, as some guys stepped up last year, or we may have some big holes if they don't truly pan out.  Our secondary is what scares me the most moving forward.  So we may have to replace, DT/DE/CB/TE/WR/QB.  Which is crazy.  We can't fix it all at once, but surely, once its fixed, we should be keeping the players.  Which we didn't."
Browns,3cpo3p,-dota-,7,Fri Jul 10 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"Our secondary is what scares me the most moving forward.   This doesn't mean it's correct, but you realize that your opinion on this is diametrically opposed to the consensus of many pundits, players in the league on other teams, coaching staffs, and fans, right?   Not saying they're right and you're wrong, because that would mean that they know the future, but I'm curious as to WHY to you feel this way?"
Browns,3cpo3p,TopHatAbobo,-2,Fri Jul 10 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"For one, Gilbert.  He was a self admitted train wreck last year, and was an abject disaster. Its good that he's seeming to do right in this off season, but he seemed to do right last off season.  But he is a huge, huge, huge question mark.    Tramon Williams.  He's already 32 years old, and next year he'll be 33.  This is where DBs start do decline, and is one reason why we got him and a perennial playoff team didn't feel he was worth it.  Everyone is expecting big things from him.  And they may be right this year, but next? Definitely going to be a question mark.  Whitner has 10 years in as a hard hitting player.  After year 11, how effective will he be in year 12?  Think he has 14 years at top level play in his body?  That's hard to imagine, especially in this division.  We're expecting huge things out of Desir and Williams.  They showed flashes in limited time, but its a big difference between playing a couple plays a game as a backup than being alone on an island as a starter with film on you they can study.  What did Desir play like, what, 3 games? with like 7 tackles for the year?  This isn't even remotely mentioning Gipson, with his injury, can he come back, and if he does, will we be able to afford him.  Since we didn't give him a contract this year, and he feels jaded and he goes some where else.  And these are just the big names.  Let alone gains or poyer or any o fthe other guys im forgetting.  Never before have I seen a part of the defense that so many people just assume is going to be good with so many huge question marks.  In two years, we could potentially be replacing pretty much every starter save haden.  We're far from ""set""."
Browns,3cpo3p,-dota-,4,Fri Jul 10 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, but you could say the same things about almost every position group on every team in the league.  Even someone like Sammy Watkins is a question mark heading into next year (hip surgery in the off-season).   In two years, we could potentially be replacing pretty much every starter save haden. We're far from ""set"".   Maybe we're actually on the same page here, but it's nearly impossible to be ""set"" at any position group, save those that are one member (QB, K, P, maybe RB).  Go to any team's subreddit, many fans of these teams feel the exact same way you do about their ""strengths"".    This is one of the reasons I particularly like Farmer and Pettine so far, they both seem to understand the constant entropy / attrition that is inherent in the NFL (i.e. Not For Long) coupled with the hard salary cap (this would be more Sashi Brown's realm though) so that you have to keep looking for replacement players in more favorable contract situations.  Sometimes it works out ok, sometimes not, but that's the nature of the beast.  No one (no, not even Belichick) makes consistently perfect, great moves in regards to roster management.  It's just easier to hide those deficiencies when you have an arguably GOAT, HOF QB and a HOF HC.  I understand it's foolish to expect ALL these guys to work out, especially the later 3rd round and later picks (like Steelers fans just assuming Shmarko Thomas is the heir apparent to Troy Polamalu), but it's also faulty to assume that all of them have hit their respective ceilings as well, or that the FO won't continue to address strengthening all position groups with the best talent that's available to them that fits with the team."
Browns,3cpo3p,TopHatAbobo,-1,Fri Jul 10 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"Who are all these teams than win by recycling  players? I can't think of any. Pats won because they have a hof qb and after trying to recycle through cbs for years, they finally went out and paid for a top flight cb.  Seattle, same thing. Did nothing until they got a quality qb who was underpaid, and paid more players. And just went out and paid big money on Graham."
Browns,3cpo3p,-dota-,3,Fri Jul 10 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"Never said anything about recycling, I'm not sure what you think I've meant in the above now (but I guess I should have expected that, considering, well... you know).   Pats won because they have a hof qb and finally went out and paid for a top flight cb.    Yep, that's the only reason.  Certainly haven't won before that was the case.  I forgot that coaching means nothing too.  Blount certainly didn't contribute HEAVILY to their success in the playoffs leading up to the Superbowl or anything.  You also ignored me saying that having a top flight QB helps to cover up areas of deficiency on your team.  But, these deficiencies can routinely be exploited by well-coached, well-balanced teams (E.g. almost any time that the Falcons faced a ""good"" team, Patriots crushing the Colts in the AFCCG, etc...).  I'm not so sure about the CB mattering anyway though, since we all know it's all about offense anyway, right?  I also forgot that Seattle consists of solely Wilson and Sherman.  Remind me, who was the 2013 2014* (Edit: brainfart) Superbowl MVP?    You're also totally discounting Lynch's contributions to that team (which is evident that they feel that he significantly strengthens their team by the contract they gave him, and also shows that they don't have AN ADEQUATE REPLACEMENT for him).  They paid Graham big money because.... he's worth it for the contract he's getting paid, and again, they don't have a replacement-level player.  But don't for a minute think they wouldn't unload him if they drafted a player that was anywhere close to him in talent level (or the very unlikely scenario of signing a comparable FA for less money).  The Patriots also could've picked up Revis's option on his contract, but.... it was too expensive (yes, even for another year of Revis production).  Instead they now have to face him twice a year."

His consistency stands out, as he rarely shanks a punt or boots it deep into the end zone for a touchback. With a long of 71 yards, he showed he still has the leg drive to blast one deep. Lee will look to continue his dominance as a punter in Cleveland next season after the 49ers traded him to the Browns for a seventh-round pick.   Wow!  I knew he was good but I'm blown away by how awesome he sounds."

Browns,3cpi5o,Marzman315,2,Thu Jul 9 19:02:36 2015 UTC,"Part 3    8) ERIC OLSEN - BACKUP OFFENSIVE GUARD  Height: 6-4 | Weight: 306 Age: 27 | Experience: 4 years College: Notre Dame  Note: Has been in the league since 2010. ... Experience has been limited to the guard position.  Eric Olsen signed with the Browns at the end of May, but this won't be his first training camp. Olsen was a 6th round draft pick by the Denver Broncos in 2010. During his five years in the NFL to date, Olsen has bounced around to five different teams, most recently the Tennessee Titans in 2014.  Olsen started four games with the New Orleans Saints back in 2012, but has otherwise been a backup. Those four starts might be a little misleading -- the Saints used him as an extra blocker in those contests, beginning the game with six linemen. His primary position is offensive guard, but he can also see some work at center.  My guess is that Olsen will be the second-team left guard behind Joel Bitonio in camp this year. If either John Greco or Cameron Erving begin the season as a backup, then Cleveland will already be in pretty good shape when it comes to depth at the guard position. Greco and Erving are also being trained to have the versatility to play pretty much any position on the line. Olsen might have to prove his worth on special teams to make the club.  Final Roster Odds: 33%    9) RYAN SEYMOUR - BACKUP CENTER  Height: 6-4 | Weight: 305 Age: 25 | Experience: 2 years College: Vanderbilt  Note: Was the Browns' fourth center in 2014. ... Appeared to be an upgrade over Nick McDonald at center.  The Browns claimed Ryan Seymour off waivers from the 49ers last September. He was briefly sent down to the practice squad before being called up to the 53-man roster in October for the rest of the year.  Seymour was sitting on the bench until Nick McDonald suffered an injury, forcing the Browns to dig deeper on the depth chart at the center position. He was inserted into the starting lineup part-way through the team's loss to the Buffalo Bills, and the coaching staff was impressed enough with Seymour and had seen enough from McDonald, so they started him at center from Weeks 14-16. Seymour suffered a hamstring injury in his final game, forcing him to miss the season finale.  We can't just pigeon-hole Seymour at center, though. Last year at camp with the 49ers, he saw action at tackle and guard. Cleveland already has several players who can play center right now in Alex Mack, John Greco, and Cameron Erving. A ""backup center"" won't make the team this year. Unfortunately, his ability to play center may actually hurt his chances. If Mack and Greco are on the first-team offense during the preseason, Erving will be at right guard with the second-team offense. With all three players having roles, that leaves Seymour at center, unable to showcase whether he has the talent to contribute as a backup tackle or guard this year.  Final Roster Odds: 34%    10) VINSTON PAINTER - BACKUP OFFENSIVE TACKLE  Height: 6-4 | Weight: 310 Age: 25 | Experience: 2 years College: Virginia Tech  Note: Imagine the venom he would've received if he ended Joe Thomas' consecutive snaps streak.  Vinston Painter was a sixth-round draft choice by the Denver Broncos in 2013 and spent most of his rookie season on their practice squad. Painter was drafted as a right tackle, but was moved to right guard during the Broncos' training camp in 2014.  The Browns signed Painter off Denver's practice squad at the start of last season, and he remained with the club all season despite not seeing any snaps on offense. Painter came close to seeing playing time twice last season -- in the first game after Alex Mack's injury, John Greco was set to move from right guard to center, leaving a vacancy at right guard. It came down to Paul McQuistan or Painter, and the coaching staff ultimately went with Painter.  Since Painter wasn't with the Browns in camp last year, I haven't had a chance to see how he plays. However, I do know how awful McQuistan performed at right guard, so it's a little discouraging to think that the coaching staff saw something to make them want to start McQuistan over Painter for a game last year. The other time Painter almost played was when the Browns were destroying the Steelers and the coaches told him to go in for Joe Thomas at left tackle (Thomas declined the offer). I'm pegging Painter to begin camp as the team's left tackle on the second-team offense.  Final Roster Odds: 33%    Part 4    11) ANDREW MCDONALD - BACKUP OFFENSIVE TACKLE  Height: 6-6 | Weight: 310 Age: 26 | Experience: 2 years College: Indiana  Note: Has played for several teams since 2012, but not with legitimate NFL experience.  Andrew McDonald signed with the Miami Dolphins in 2012 as an undrafted free agent. He spent all year on their practice squad but didn't make the team out of camp in 2013. Last year, he bounced between the Carolina Panthers, Seattle Seahawks, and Indianapolis Colts, only playing in two career games as a reserve. The Browns claimed him off waivers last December.  McDonald admitted that he was ""Player A"" in the Ted Wells investigation into the bullying that took place on the Miami Dolphins a couple of years ago. For those who aren't familiar with the report, ""Player A"" would make McDonald a victim, not a perpetrator, of the bullying.  McDonald is expected to compete for a backup role at offensive tackle in camp. I'm projecting him to play left or right tackle with the third-string offense.  Final Roster Odds: ~1%    12) KARIM BARTON - BACKUP CENTER  Height: 6-3 | Weight: 313 Age: 23 | Experience: 1 year College: Morgan State  Note: Spent all of 2014 on the Browns' practice squad. ... Originally from Jamaica.  Karim Barton signed with the Philadelphia Eagles last offseason as an undrafted free agent. He played as a backup in three preseason games and played right tackle his final year at college. Philadelphia waived him in their first round of cuts, and the Browns claimed him off waivers.  Cleveland released Barton a week later but signed him to the practice squad, where he spent all of last season. Originally from Jamaica, the Browns did a feature story on him at the end of March, covering the issues with his parents and the admiration he has for veteran linemen John Greco and Joe Thomas.  Barton will compete for a backup spot at offensive guard this camp. If he doesn't win a roster spot, he'll have another shot at landing on the practice squad, but it's not often that a player stays on the same team's practice squad for two years in a row due to the influx of new talent that comes in.  Final Roster Odds: ~1%    13) TYLER LOOS - UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT OFFENSIVE LINEMAN  Height: 6-5 | Weight: 294 Age: 22 | Experience: Rookie College: Northern Illinois  Note: Signed by Browns after a rookie tryout. ... Played tackle in college but could move inside to guard.  Tyler Loos is one of two undrafted free agents the Browns signed after a tryout at rookie minicamp in May. Our SB Nation affiliate has a full biography up on Loos. Here is a snippet:   ""Tyler Loos has never been a mauler, but more of a technique player. The question might be whether he has the foot quickness and strength to play tackle in the NFL. But with his health issues hopefully behind him, we may see Loos grow into a more physical player since he will be able to focus on other aspects of his strength other than rehabilitating his legs.""  Loos played left tackle in college, but it's up-in-the-air as to whether he'll assume that role on the third-team offense or move inside to guard like our Tim Miller thinks he will.  Final Roster Odds: ~1%    14) DARRIAN MILLER - UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT OFFENSIVE LINEMAN  Height: 6-5 | Weight: 307 Age: 22 | Experience: Rookie College: Kentucky  Note: Signed by Browns after a rookie tryout. ... Played tackle in college but could move inside to guard.  Darrian Miller is the other undrafted free agent offensive lineman the Browns signed after a tryout at rookie minicamp in May. Miller was rated as a 6th or 7th round pick by Dane Bruglar of CBS Sports. Here's what Bruglar said about him in his scouting report:  ""The Wildcats’ starting left tackle the past three seasons, Miller showed steady improvement over the years and stood out during East-West Shrine Game practices for his consistency in pass protection and promise as a run blocker. He doesn’t play with lateral explosion or lower body burst, limiting his range against speed rushers, although he works well in shorter areas with his flexible stance to stay square. Miller lacks the physical tools or consistent technique to be a reliable NFL starter at tackle and is a candidate to move inside to guard where he can work in small spaces – durable later round prospect.""  Like Loos, it's believed that Miller, who played tackle in college, could shift over to guard. The Browns could experiment with both players at both positions on the third-team offense until they find the right combination in camp. At the end of the day, Miller and Loos are really just competing for a spot on the practice squad.  Final Roster Odds: ~1%"

Browns,3cjyov,giannini1222,3,Wed Jul 8 17:02:02 2015 UTC,"I understand that. But saying ""reportedly"" is not speech to use when using conjecture. Reportedly implies truth and actual fucking REPORTS that that's what they said. It's completely bullshit, especially the way he said it. He absolutely fails to mention that Hoyer was playing like shit when he got benched, and almost single-handedly threw away the game he started in last. Nah, none of that matters Grossi it was all the text (which was stated by the NFL to provide NO advantage, where you could argue that providing personnel advice or calling for a change is definitely advantageous, thus Grossi is just flat out lying).   Nonetheless, when we have nothing but conjecture instantly going to the absolute worse case scenario about something that many people have denied is going to get him a lot of deserved shit. Fuck Grossi."
Browns,3cjyov,Daviroth,8,Wed Jul 8 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That was the thing that pissed me off the most. He states the record which was won on the back of the defense, offensive line, the run game, and almost despite Hoyer. He doesn't say Hoyer had the worst completion percentage of all QBs, the worst 3rd down percentage of any team, the lowest passing TDs of any team; but makes it sound like he was only taken out because of Farmer texting.   Which if it was during that Colts game, texting was the least thing Farmer should have done."

Because I can't think of a single other thing   Yes, because it's what YOU think happened means that it's obviously the ONLY thing that could have happened.   especially considering all the other colateral[sic] info we have.   Specifically what?  The Bob LaMonte, err...., I mean, the Jason La Canfora report?  You're also asking him to commit the very thing he was demonizing (conjecturing on the contents of the texts)."
Browns,3cjyov,-dota-,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"He texted about something right? If it was innocuous, then they would have just said it. The fact you can't even come up with a reasonable hypothesis confirms the point."

OP said it was conjecture to assume what the texts said, because it is.   The fact you can't even come up with a reasonable hypothesis confirms the point.   Which is what?  That argument from ignorance makes your statement logically valid?  Because it doesn't."
Browns,3cjyov,-dota-,-1,Wed Jul 8 21:53:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't ignore your other point. I just assumed this was common knowledge.  Da and couch both had mental break downs.  Thomas, Mack, everyone is on record multiple times saying how much of a leader Hoyer was, and how well respected.  Which is why grossi said that pettine called him to apologize for how he was treated. Because he had massive respect for him.   And again.  All facts lead us to the same thing. It was clearly about the qb situation, which farmer said as well, and it wasn't happy texting.  That's all we need to know.  No matter what was said, it was clearly and obviously negative.  Props to pettine for not caving to the pressure. But you sound like you've got your mind made up, so no sense continuing this chain."

End of story.   As for the texting thing it could have been LITERALLY ANYTHING. I'm not gonna go off on conjecture as you seem to be asking me, which is silly because I'm saying conjecture is stupid. I have no idea what it says, there are only a handful of people in the entire world who know what they said. Throwing around bullshit about what the texts said is a waste of time and will only cause arguments so there is no point."
Browns,3cjyov,-dota-,-4,Wed Jul 8 23:36:36 2015 UTC,"We both agreed they have better arms, but they were out of the league because they weren't leaders of men. Which is why when couches arm gave up, every gave up on him too. Why both cried in the face of adversity. Hoyer held his teammates and coaches respect beyond the field, which shows leader of men. End of story.  Whatever the text was, wasnt good.  So even assuming the best, it was terrible, right? Otherwise they would have said something. Really no way to look at it objectively other than that.  If you want to put a rosey Homer coating, go nuts, but it really doesn't help your argument."
Browns,3cjyov,Daviroth,2,Thu Jul 9 00:12:06 2015 UTC,"We weren't ranking them as leaders of men. We were ranking them as QBs of the Cleveland Browns. If Hoyer was such a good leader how did he have worse results with better talent? It doesn't really matter because Couch and DA led the team to more success. Hence, better QBs.   Them not telling us what it was does not mean it is a horrible thing. That is a fucking HUGE assumption that is also faulty logic. It's also the only leg your ""theory"" has to stand on as well, so that's the end of that."
Browns,3cjyov,-dota-,0,Thu Jul 9 00:46:16 2015 UTC,"While, DA and Couch had better arms, Hoyer was 10 times the leader of men than either of them   Think you're replying to the wrong person then, that's the entire point of my post."
Browns,3cjyov,Daviroth,2,Thu Jul 9 00:52:17 2015 UTC,"Are you just ignoring what I said? I said that we aren't judging them as leaders of men and even if we were how could Hoyer be a much better leader with more talent on the team and achieve worse results? You either believe Couch's playoff team or DA's team had more talent (lol), that they are better QBs by a fair margin (THE POINT OF THIS THREAD), or that Hoyer really wasn't as great as Grossi's Hoyer-stuffed-throat says he was.   Do you believe that Hoyer was a better leader AND a better QB? Because that doesn't make sense and isn't supported by the numerous other facts.  Also I know I'll never be able to make you see anything other than your own opinion as you keep downvoting me like 5 year old as if that will somehow discredit what I'm saying.

Browns,3cjyov,Brokewood,9,Wed Jul 8 16:50:38 2015 UTC,"Give me Couch on this team, we contend.  p.s. Should some one tell Grossi, his old man crotchety-ness is showing? He obviously is pissed that he got ousted from the Browns, but he acts like Farmer personally killed his dog."
Browns,3cjyov,blackedout,3,Wed Jul 8 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He was at the Dalton line.  Not earth-shattering, not great, but definitely ""good enough"". This team would be fantastic with a QB that was at his level..... Which makes me think he should have been above Hoyer on this list. An injury to the center back in 02 wouldn't have phased Couch the least; he still managed to drag us to the playoffs with 50+ sacks against him."
Browns,3cjyov,Doyle524,2,Wed Jul 8 16:55:58 2015 UTC,50+ sacks? God damn our line was shit before JT.
Browns,3cjyov,blackedout,5,Wed Jul 8 20:22:13 2015 UTC,"50+ sacks for a few years. The guy broke fingers, ribs, had sprains, and eventually broke a damn leg prior to our playoff appearance.   He was led to the slaughter."
Browns,3cjyov,blackedout,3,Wed Jul 8 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"I did some drilling on PFR, and came to the conclusion that Dalton and Couch are pretty similar, with Andy getting the lead in I think all categories (mind you, he is on a much better team than the early 00 Browns)...  Comparing Couch 99-02 with Dalton 11-13 (Couch was injured much of 2000, and I wanted to compare a similar number of games 52 for Couch, 48 for Dalton).   Couch had an awful record of 19-32, Dalton was 30-18.... But get this, Couch's QB Completion percentage was 59.9, Dalton's 60.9, yards per attempt were 6.5 for Tim, 7.0 for Andy. Rating of 74.8 for Tim, rating of 85.7 for Andy....  Here's where it gets brutal: Tim was sacked 147 times, Andy only 99. Tim lost 1003 yards on those sacks, Andy 571.   The Browns killed Couch. He'd have surpassed Dalton on Dalton's current team."
Browns,3cjyov,topper_mango,2,Wed Jul 8 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"Couch, and then everyone else.  Cribbs gets an honorable mention for doing more good behind center in a handful of wildcat snaps than most of our starting quarterbacks managed in their entire career."

Browns,3cifpm,moodyfloyd,5,Wed Jul 8 16:48:52 2015 UTC,After some more research it looks like he called Brown when Cincy cut him on June 18. It says he planned then to work with Brown and Moss. A few days later on June 22 he signed with us. I can't find exactly when they all got together or if this was the first day. Source.

I'm generally pretty hemmed up and haven't had any problems.  As far as dawg pound, I've only ever sat in the upper level, and honestly it's been pretty dead every time I've sat there."

Browns,3ch9bc,leopold_stotch21,2,Wed Jul 8 15:26:05 2015 UTC,So is orange. And white isn't half bad.
Browns,3ch9bc,Doyle524,5,Wed Jul 8 20:33:09 2015 UTC,Browns also #1 selling team uni according to Dicks. I like it.

Browns,3ch9bc,Fakespeedbump,2,Wed Jul 8 05:32:47 2015 UTC,"Which is why I bought the old ones. I figure they had more practice knocking them off. And if not, I'm only out like $22."

Browns,3ch9bc,TweetPoster,2,Tue Jul 7 22:09:55 2015 UTC,I really want one of the new ones but already bought a (fake) Haden jersey last season. Would it be weird to have two of the same jerseys of the same player?   Haden is my favorite in the league (even went as far as swapping my #4 overall pick in an online Madden league for #17 and other picks over guys like Luck or Lynch that are game breakers so I could have Haden) but this feels slightly obsessive. Like Patrick with Jeffrey the jellyfish.
Browns,3ch9bc,Mustang1718,2,Wed Jul 8 01:33:44 2015 UTC,Absolutely not. I'd own 30 Haden jerseys if I could.
Browns,3ch9bc,someguy3084,2,Wed Jul 8 03:15:50 2015 UTC,There's 7 days in a week. It's not weird until you have 7 plus alternates for home and away games.

Browns,3ch9bc,QueefStain,8,Wed Jul 8 05:23:53 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with the draft and everything to do with having new jerseys
Browns,3ch9bc,Fakespeedbump,3,Wed Jul 8 05:33:52 2015 UTC,For sure but I couldn't have predicted the new jerseys vaulting a Browns player to number 1 in sales
Browns,3ch9bc,QueefStain,5,Wed Jul 8 05:37:20 2015 UTC,With our fan base I'm really not surprised. Just look at who wins the subreddit growth contest every year and how many pro bowlers we had after the fan voting.   Edit: And the fact that we got Peyton Hillis on the cover of Madden when fans got to choose.

So you're saying we won as a joke? :(   Kind of... the year he won Hillis was 11th in Rushing yards and tied for 6th in TDs. A very solid year but when you think of Madden, they usually put MVPs and very high profile stars on there."
Browns,3ch9bc,Redditor5StandingBy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:37:34 2015 UTC,Yeah but I was really proud of it because I thought we accomplished something as fans. I mean I was voting everyday for it. I still have it displayed in my living room lol.

It sounds like you're projecting because you want so badly to be good, anyone who says anything that's not superbowl makes you rage.  Rage like a child.  But I don't expect a realistic response, because people who start comments with ""Fuck you"" aren't looking for discussion, just to rant."
Browns,3cl87n,-dota-,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:40:16 2015 UTC,"Oh that's just fucking silly. Have you been a Browns fan for six months? This is NOT the worst QB situation we've had. Not even remotely close. Forget not in the ballpark, not on the same continent that the ballpark is on. A game-manager who has proven he can be good with a solid supporting cast, and a high-upside kid who has been impressing teammates and turned himself around is actually one of the better QB situations we've had in the last decade or so. I know you're trying very hard to be miserable and pessimistic, but try to stick to reality. We won seven games last year with the statistically worst QB in the NFL. Let's not write the Browns off as the fucking worst team in the league yet ok?  Edit: also, fuck you for being condescending. If rage bothers you, I wouldn't start being bitchy and whiney around me. I have something of a reputation."
Browns,3cl87n,Marzman315,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you said. This is potentially the best Defense, Oline, and Running back situation we've had in 15+ years.   I feel confident in saying this is 100% for sure the best coaching situation we've had in the last 15 years  WR and QB are admittedly a bit of a question mark as to how it will play out, but certainly not even close to the worst we've had. Maybe I'm bias because I'm a Manziel optimist, but I'm looking forward to at least a half-decent season from the Browns this year.  I feel like Pettine coming back should make everyone excited for this season"

Browns,3cl87n,wotrab,5,Wed Jul 8 20:08:09 2015 UTC,And OP for his pointless pessimism.
Browns,3cl87n,Marzman315,3,Wed Jul 8 23:52:06 2015 UTC,I give them the wide margin of 7 wins +/- 2. I don't think we're worse than last year where we managed 7 before being derailed by injuries. I can't imagine someone other than McCown or manziel playing (barring injury obviously). Either we have a veteran who's role is to minimize turnovers or we give manziel a thorough look.  This team is too good to tank. I don't even know that we'd want a top pick in next year's draft just to get a qb. Maybe an elite prospect will emerge from the college ranks this season but when I look at the top prospects right now they seem like they'd all get late-1st to second round grades if they were in the last two drafts. I'm sure 2 will go in the top 10 as usual.
Browns,3cl87n,OrnetteOrnette,8,Wed Jul 8 20:40:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no fucking way. Our schedule isn't as scary as it was coming out of last season, as a few of the more dangerous teams seem to be showing signs of falling off. We play the Bengals and the Ravens at night this year, and this team seems to historically show the fuck up in primetime situations against tough opponents. Our running game is going to be ferocious, and even if we do have another lineman go down, the addition of Erving guarantees that the quality of play will remain similar rather than falling off a cliff. Our defense has the potential to be the best in the league; the secondary is already there, and we added some key pieces to help stop the run.   I see us in playoff contention in December this year."
Browns,3cl87n,Doyle524,6,Wed Jul 8 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"I know the schedule is tough, but our team is the most talented it has been in a long time. Elite defense, a great offensive line and a powerful running game. That alone should get us to .500. Decent QB play and we could have a winning record."
Browns,3cl87n,growing_present,5,Wed Jul 8 20:14:57 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand. We rode our o-line and defense to seven wins with the 33rd ranked NFL QB last year, we lost fucking no one, and everyone thinks we're going to be picking ducking top three in the draft! It's fucking infuriating."
Browns,3cl87n,Marzman315,4,Wed Jul 8 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, we are BETTER than last year, not worse.  Tougher schedule? Yes, but that doesn't mean we're going to be embarrassing."
Browns,3cl87n,NolaBrownsFan,2,Thu Jul 9 13:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think people are worrying too much about the scedule. 49ers fell apart, our defense could surprise Denver and shut down KC, St. Louis and SD, Cardinals don't scare me too much. Seahawks in Seattle isn't going to be fun, but we match up well against the Jets. Raiders and Titans shouldn't be tough wins, and we match up well against our divisionals (let's not forget we're coming off a 31-10 destruction of Shitsburgh).   Yeah QB is a concern but it honestly could be worse. And the team has been thoroughly constructed to make the most of weak QB play. Much like it was last year, when we won 7 games with the system. Maybe we aren't Super Bowl contenders just yet, but there is absolutely no reason to believe we'll regress."
Browns,3cl87n,Marzman315,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"I believe people (not just browns fans, but NFL fans in general) put too much emphasis on strength of schedule before the season begins.  A LOT can change from season to season, we don't know if the AFC and NFC west will be as tough as they previously were, sometimes teams slip off and I would guess that is kind of going to happen with 49ers and perhaps Denver/Arizona also.  I almost think those two divisions with the exception of the Seahawks kind of declined since last season"
Browns,3cl87n,DayvyT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:16:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like we're in the same situation as the Bills and Jets. Very talented roster, just question marks with the QB. I wouldn't be shocked if all 3 teams surprised people."
Browns,3cl87n,growing_present,3,Thu Jul 9 19:46:07 2015 UTC,I say we can go 7-9 again. Not hopeful that we break .500. Lack of talent on offense and a new scheme doesn't let us perform well against the tougher part of our schedule.
Browns,3cl87n,gleaming-the-cube,2,Wed Jul 8 21:07:33 2015 UTC,Lack of talent at WR and QB fits better. We have insane talent on offense. It's just not balanced across all units.
Browns,3cl87n,Daviroth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:39:08 2015 UTC,Skill positions is what I meant. If you count the O line and RBs we have great talent but I meant more specifically WR and QB as you mention. The talent we have kind of leaves us one dimensional and easier to defend against.
Browns,3cl87n,gleaming-the-cube,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:38:13 2015 UTC,What is this insane talent you speak of on offense? And if you say our running backs I'm going to blow my brains out because both west and crow haven't done all that much in the NFL.
Browns,3cl87n,chris101010,2,Thu Jul 9 03:33:25 2015 UTC,"How about a top 3 o line? Vastly improved relieving corps? TEs that'll play more than 5 games? And yes, the RBs are pretty damn good."
Browns,3cl87n,Rageboner27,0,Thu Jul 9 04:57:53 2015 UTC,"Our TE's are by far the worst unit on the team.  While our receivers are bad, our TEs are easily, EASILY the worst offensive position int he NFL.  They're decent blockers, but not remotely good/strong route runners. Our RBs look decent, and our oline is top notch, but we're completely one dimensional in the skill positions."
Browns,3cl87n,-dota-,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:50:35 2015 UTC,I'd say they are more of the biggest question mark than the worst part of the O.
Browns,3cl87n,themitey1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:25:28 2015 UTC,"Basically our entire offensive line. Crow and West are solid as well, it's not like they are bad. They have talent."
Browns,3cl87n,Daviroth,2,Thu Jul 9 11:48:48 2015 UTC,"The good thing right now is that the upcoming draft has a deeper class than last year. It's a class more similar to 2014 than 2015, where there might be 5-6 draftable prospects and 2-3 can work out from that group.  Jared Goff has become my QB of choice in the meantime."
Browns,3cl87n,JohnnyFire,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:16:19 2015 UTC,I'm not sure about Goff. His stats are insanely inflated. As a true freshman he was throwing 50 balls a game.

Browns,3cl87n,fap-the-potato,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:52:04 2015 UTC,I'm prepared for a low-win season as we still could use some key pieces. But I really hope the four QB thing doesn't happen.
Browns,3cl87n,seamonkeydoo2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:13:26 2015 UTC,I still think we get 7 wins at least and barring injury I think only two Qbs start. We Know the secondary will be great and there's no reason we won't have a much improved run defense that'll keep us in a lot of games. We know we'll have one of the best O-lines that's even improved in quality and depth from last season and we know we'll have a decent to good running attack. Those are all pretty much fact at this point and I believe that if we get anything close to average qb play we can hit 7-8 wins.
Browns,3cl87n,Drokk88,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:24:02 2015 UTC,"Hack, Goff, Kessler, Cook."
Browns,3cl87n,Chiranthodendron,-1,Wed Jul 8 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"Hackenberg has every quality that made Weeden bad, and I'm not a Kessler fan at all. Goff and Cook will go top five and our roster is way too good to project us picking that high."
Browns,3cl87n,Marzman315,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:29:48 2015 UTC,"In my ideal world the Seahawks tag Wilson and we give them the two first rounders/lock him up for 7 years 130 million with $65 guaranteed. He puts the work in and can win with a strong cast around him. The AFC is a weaker conference than the NFC and we have our core locked up for a while. Missing two years of firsts wouldn't be that bad if you're getting a sure thing that puts the work in. It's a risk but it could be worth it.  As for the names I listed, we obviously don't know how they'll pan out, but there is potential in next year's class. It's all about finding the right combo of work ethic and talent."
Browns,3cl87n,Chiranthodendron,-2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"Cook is Brian Hoyer 2.0. College stats are fucking identical.   Hackenberg still has a lot to prove, 3rd round at best unless his offensive line keeps him safe this year. He'll always be known for getting mauled by Bosa though."

Nev's trademark ""TOUCHDOWN BROWNS!"" with Dieken's color commentary was an absolute thrill for Browns fans everywhere and could perfectly define that thrilling moment of excitement. example  Don't get me wrong, I love Donovan, but I think the downvotes may be coming from guys who know only Donovan as the voice of the Browns.. too young to know the excellence that once was - every Sunday for those great Browns teams.  As a huge sports fan who went to school for broadcasting, I am still in awe that we, all at one time, had these broadcasters bringing our action into our cars (or living rooms, workstations, etc):  Legendary voices like Nev Chandler, Tom Hamilton, Joe Tait, Mike Hegan, Paul Keels, Gib Shanley, Doug Dieken, Casey Coleman, and Herb Score (I'm sure I've left someone out here).  We are blessed to have had these men broadcasting our games in Northeast Ohio over the years.  They are superior talent to national play-by-play men.  Of all these names- Chandler (Browns), Tait (Cavs, Indians), Keels (Buckeyes), and Hamilton (Indians, Buckeyes) are the gold standard and are clear cut Hall of Famers.    edit: link"

Browns,3c7dev,UrbanAppalachian,35,Sun Jul 5 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"This is one of my favorite Browns topics.  Tim Couch does not belong on any ""draft bust"" lists, in my opinion.  His TD/INT (64/67) ratio was good considering how bad the teams were.  I'd love to see a 21 year old TC on this team."
Browns,3c7dev,jcmck0320,8,Sun Jul 5 16:20:26 2015 UTC,Your response is sweet confirmation bias. I entirely agree.
Browns,3c7dev,dm_mute,4,Sun Jul 5 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"Do you really believe that he would do well on our team now? Do you think our team now is good enough to support a 21 year old QB? To be clear, I'm a diehard Browns fan, and I'm not trolling you. You seem to have a strong opinion and some facts to back it up, and I'd really like to know more about if and why you think Tim Couch would be good on our team this year."
Browns,3c7dev,jcmck0320,9,Sun Jul 5 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do.  From 1999-2003, Tim Couch did not have an offensive line or a running game.  The most decent wide receiver on the team was Kevin Johnson.  On top of that, there was a ton of drama from the front office.    As bad as the 5-11 teams have been recently, they were not nearly as bad as the teams Tim Couch was on."
Browns,3c7dev,dm_mute,3,Sun Jul 5 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for your reply."
Browns,3c7dev,wardsac,3,Sun Jul 5 23:16:30 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%.  He would be pretty good, maybe very good, with the OL and running game we have now.  WRs aren't very good, but no worse than what he had."
Browns,3c7dev,OllieSimmondsMustDie,15,Mon Jul 6 11:59:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think so,  precisely because of the O line issues and the Detmer injuries.   Couch had all the tools to succeed in virtually any other scenario."
Browns,3c7dev,felisrufus,8,Sun Jul 5 16:16:45 2015 UTC,A lot of people seem to forget that Couch was supposed to sit and learn behind Detmer for a year or two.
Browns,3c7dev,BiznessCasual,3,Sun Jul 5 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"""Y'know, looking back on it, I really think we screwed up Couch.  He really could have been a good QB, maybe not Peyton Manning, but good, if only he hadn't thrust him into a shitty situation.""  Five minutes later...  ""C'MON, WE GOTTA SEE WHAT MANZIEL CAN DO! THROW THE KID IN THERE, WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE! GIVE HIM A CHANCE!! HURRRRRRRRR!""

Browns,3c7dev,24rubikscube,17,Sun Jul 5 16:50:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say no. I don't think he'd have been an elite, but he really didn't have a chance. Not a bust because any QB would've flopped in that situation."
Browns,3c7dev,miked1be,8,Sun Jul 5 16:14:56 2015 UTC,I'd say that he wasn't a bust as a player but the pick itself was definitely a bust.  We needed to improve the rest of the team before throwing a young player in there at QB to get destroyed.  There may have been an initial intent to let him sit for a while but that went right the fuck out the window at the first sign of trouble.  They really should have traded the pick or picked another position but that's hindsight for you.
Browns,3c7dev,wayback72,5,Sun Jul 5 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"Right on! Ditka and the Saints offered their entire draft for that pick, which would have changed Browns history.  Forever."
Browns,3c7dev,JohnnyFire,6,Sun Jul 5 23:40:59 2015 UTC,"I have gone on a rant about this before, but between 1999 and 2002, the Browns drafted an exact ZERO Pro Bowlers. That's fucking impossible. How can you miss that much? On a team which needed top notch talent, you needed a lot of chances to get it right, even if that meant not getting a top flight QB right off the bat.  Some might say the misses, terrible management over 4 years, and general tom-fuckery was to stop the expansion craze and threats of moves; if Cleveland was made an example of, and ruined a talented young QB with a shitty team that couldn't win, then they'd shut up a lot of fanbases. There was no incentive to take that Ditka trade and get good, because if the Browns did well, the teams with move-claims would be chomping at the bit to prove they could do it too. It happened to Houston as well.  But as far as Ditka, keep this in mind: if we take that trade down, we get all of New Orleans' picks, and probably more than what Washington received. I'd say they'd have had to included a 2001 pick. So fine, we drop down a bit in the 1999 draft and probably fall hard that year, but keep in mind who's on the board with our picks and all of New Orleans' picks at this point:  1999  1.12: Jevon Kearse, Damien Woody (either start creating a dominant defense or begin shoring up the offensive line.)  2.32: Jon Jansen, Mike Rucker (same theory as above)  In the second round, with two picks, you have Dre Bly and Peerless Price.  In the third round, with three picks, you have Joey Porter, Gary Stills, and Marty Brooker.  In the fifth round, with three picks, you have Jerry Azumah and Roderick Coleman.  In the sixth round, with three picks (or more), you have Desmond Clark.  In the seventh round, with three picks (or more), you have Donald Driver and Sean Morey.  2000  1.2: Even if we take Courtney Brown first, and he still busts, the Browns can get any of LaVar Arrington, Chris Samuels, Jamal Lewis, Corey Simon, Thomas Jones, Brian Urlacher, or Shawn Ellis and be an instantly better team anyway defensively.   2001  1.23: We could've gotten Drew Fucking Brees. And even if we'd somehow atoned for our sins and gotten Tom Brady in 2000, there's still Deuce McAllister, Kyle Vanden Bosch, Reggie Wayne, Todd Heap, any would do fine to at least wipe some of the stain of Gerard Warren away.  I mean fuck. I've done a full reasonable redraft of 1999-2002 before, and I won't report that here, but come on, when you get a chance to get the barn and you have nothing to lose as a young team, you have to take it, and by not, you're just showing there's an agenda to be pushed."
Browns,3c7dev,wayback72,3,Mon Jul 6 15:46:20 2015 UTC,"You make an interesting case.  I'm going to have to rethink things now through the lens of your theory.  Good stuff, thanks-  I know for an absolute fact the league leveraged the Browns move (while we were vapor) to get several stadium deals completed between '96 and '99 (basically telling teams ""don't let what happened in Cleveland happen to you""), ..but my impression of the Browns drafting woes was always that of severe incompetence by Dwight Clark and Carmen Policy.   I must have forgot what a shit-show our drafting was back then.  Jamir Miller popped in my mind, but thinking back now, we didn't draft him.  ..so yeah, 0 for our first 4 drafts.  God.  Hey, there is a bright side.  Fast forward to today:  We are a 7-9 team that is improving *and we finally have a damn good HC.  *edit props to Coach Pettine"
Browns,3c7dev,Doyle524,2,Tue Jul 7 02:28:11 2015 UTC,"At that point, we really needed as much good, young talent as we could possibly get. Trading with the Saints would have pushed us forward several years (assuming we didn't whiff on every single pick), to the point where we could have been legitimate contenders by 2001.  I'm actually interested in your redraft, could I get a link?"
Browns,3c7dev,Marzman315,6,Wed Jul 8 21:14:02 2015 UTC,"It's not fair to call him a bust. He was put on a team with no o-line, no run game, no receivers, and no defense. How in the hell was he supposed to be successful? Same can be said about David Carr"
Browns,3c7dev,blackedout,5,Sun Jul 5 17:04:12 2015 UTC,No. That expansion draft was a sham to protect other teams' interests. Couch was a victim of a legendarily bad team.
Browns,3c7dev,scrambledpotatoes,4,Sun Jul 5 17:21:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, since we all agree he's not a bust. How good could he have been?  Me personally I see him just north of the Dalton line, but not by much. Only because I have a hard time finding where he would be now in comparison to the rest of the starters around the league."
Browns,3c7dev,blackedout,5,Sun Jul 5 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"I'd put him at the Dalton line. He made it to the playoffs, so that's as high as I'd ever dare speculate. He had the tools at one point. If we had a decent line and run game he would have been good enough that we wouldn't have worried about a QB for at least 5 or 6 years."
Browns,3c7dev,scrambledpotatoes,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:35 2015 UTC,Fair enough. But I can't see Couch (with a decent team) posting single digit QB ratings as often as Dalton has. Can you?
Browns,3c7dev,blackedout,4,Sun Jul 5 21:23:27 2015 UTC,"Well... That's really wayyyyy past where I'd ever dare speculate, but his issue at the end was mental (disregard the broken leg, ribs, thumb, etc... The man was sacked 50+ times per year) he got the yips from taking so much punishment that maybe it would have worked? An argument can be made if suppose, but at this point, I'll just stay with ""he's not a bust"" and not cry over spilled milk so-to-speak."
Browns,3c7dev,hiburd,4,Mon Jul 6 13:00:45 2015 UTC,"I just remember that o-line being so bad the running back couldn't even fall for two yards. Total rushing yards in 1999 was 1150 lol, 2000 it was only 1085, 2001 things started  looking up to 1351, and in 2002 we finally had a mediocre 1615 yards for the season. With no run game no wonder he was getting so much pressure."
Browns,3c7dev,Doyle524,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:54:40 2015 UTC,We didn't even have a 1000 yard rusher until we resurrected Jamal Lewis from the dead Ravens.
Browns,3c7dev,BillionaireBob,3,Wed Jul 8 21:16:27 2015 UTC,I don't think we can say he'd be elite. I certainly think he could have been a very good starter.
Browns,3c7dev,Pissflaps69,3,Sun Jul 5 16:47:32 2015 UTC,"I've always felt he was unfairly saddled with the bust label.  The reality is that he was given the worst supporting cast in the NFL, without any meaningful targets and a dreadful offensive line, and succumbed to it similarly to David Carr.  I think if drafted today by the Browns, he'd be the best QB we've had in the expansion era and he'd give us a chance to compete yearly for the playoffs."
Browns,3c7dev,BiznessCasual,3,Mon Jul 6 18:08:57 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he's still statistically the best QB we've had since '99.
Browns,3c7dev,Doyle524,2,Tue Jul 7 04:11:28 2015 UTC,"Yep. Only Anderson and Hoyer are close, too."
Browns,3c7dev,Ihateloops,2,Wed Jul 8 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"He could have been good if in a different situation, but he wasn't. He was in the situation he was in and pretty much failed. That makes him a bust in my eyes."
Browns,3c7dev,dougefreshm4l,2,Mon Jul 6 08:19:37 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go against the grain on this one and say he was a draft bust. It may not have been his fault at all, but with him being the number 1 overall pick and not even having a decent career he was definitely a bust. Just because a guy gets injured or has a shitty team around him doesn't mean he's not a bust."
Browns,3c7dev,Klint22080,3,Mon Jul 6 12:06:02 2015 UTC,"Browns fan here. We have ruined over 20 qb careers since 1999. It's impossible to be that unlucky. Couch had serious talent and drive. The problem was nobody around him. By the time we started to build he was too hurt. The other qbs had talent around them but stupid ass coordinators failed to bring out the most from them. And every time we had a qb we found a way to knock them down a notch. Anderson threw the ball too hard(ever watch Favre throw the ball)? McCoy was too small. Hoyer didn't have a strong enough arm. Weeden didn't have accuracy and threw too hard. Garcia wanted to run too much(he ran for his life) and now manziel has a drug problem(or the oc made him play a style of offense he never has). Point being coaches now want to win because of them not the players. It's been sad in Cleveland. We now have a great offensive line, receivers who can catch the ball and a good run game, manziel should have no excuses this year. Sorry didn't realize this was on r/Browns. I bet we are all Browns fans lol."

Browns,3c7dev,MrLennoxTyson,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:30:59 2015 UTC,"I like to think that Tim Couch would have had a respectable career elsewhere, but who knows. Regardless, I don't think anyone else in that draft who was in play for the first pick would have done as well or even come close to Couch's output. McNabb would've been minced-meat just the same as couch, and probably would've been sacked/injured more for his tendency to pull it down. Akili Smith doesn't even deserve to be mentioned, but there ya go. Smart move would have been to draft an O-line man or anchor defensive player, but expansion teams rarely make the smart move. Similar case with David Carr."

If they can build off of last season and continue to grow, and if Shelton has immediate impact, we could be outrageously scary.  And while that obviously doesn't address the glaring issue we have on Offense, at least we'll beat the shit out of other teams in the process.    Also, surprisingly decent article from Bleacher Report.  Love that they didn't do a listicle for clicks."

Browns,3bvx2t,jacksonbarrett,2,Thu Jul 2 16:25:13 2015 UTC,Despite the offensive problems I do agree that games this year are going to be quite enjoyable to watch because of the defense.
Browns,3bvx2t,fear865,6,Fri Jul 3 12:11:04 2015 UTC,It's such a breath of fresh air to hear others outside of our fan-base say good things about the Browns.

Browns,3bvx2t,wickedshxt,2,Thu Jul 2 22:06:00 2015 UTC,Pretty much.  We hear the same thing about our defense pretty much every year.  I'll believe it when I see it.
Browns,3bvx2t,unicorn_therapist,3,Fri Jul 3 00:06:17 2015 UTC,We all knew this. Good to see others do as well. This defense is going to be fun this year.
Browns,3bvx2t,OllieSimmondsMustDie,3,Thu Jul 2 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"We just need an offense that can avoid constantly going three and out to keep our defensive unit fresh, and we'll shock a lot of teams."
Browns,3bvx2t,JesteroftheApocalyps,5,Sun Jul 5 13:12:45 2015 UTC,"Mike Pettine is building a scary defense for Cleveland. Theoretically, it could be like the 2002 Bucs or do I dare say the 2000 Ravens, where both teams were pretty weak at QB, insanely strong on defense, and just crushed opponents on the DL and cornerback/safety side.  We just need a super-solid inside LB. I'm praying Kirksey can live up to the task. I pray he's bulked up a bit but also running tons of wind sprints.   And Mingo has got to get his shit together. He's actually shown a lot of promise in scattering ways, he just needs to put the whole package together.  If all this stuff could happen , we could start winning the close games we lost last year.  And Pettine needs to understand to step up the brutality on our team. One aspect of football is you have to really beat the shit out of the other team. Physically destroy them.   And I can see that in the way he thinks/drafts. And in my heart, I don't feel that Shanahan quit; I think he was kind of driven out because he was too finesse in his style of offense.   I know DeFellipo is a QB guru, but I'm hoping that Pettine makes him grind down defenses with our O-line before trying to bomb it downfield.  Alex Mack! If you can hear me, stay healthy!"

If either he and Kirksey can step it up another notch, a healthy Uncle Phil and Danny Shelton, Gipson, Kruger holding down the flank, Mingo improving his pass rush, and of course Joe Haden, we should become the most strangulating defense in the NFL. I just pray we don't have any crushing season-ending injuries like we had last year.  Oh yeah, and Desir needs to develop into a reliable nickel package player."
Browns,3bvx2t,lonewolfman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:27:51 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to see what the competition between a healthy mingo, solomon,  and our rookie nat orchard can do for that position.

While Thomas, Chancellor and Sherman are better than Gipson, Whitner and Haden, they are actually pretty similar players.  I'd argue that Tramon Williams is better than Cary Williams.  I don't know between K'waun and Lane.  Then we've got Gilbert and Ekpre-Olomu waiting in the wings as well."

Browns,3bxqgb,JimasaurusRex,6,Fri Jul 3 00:51:01 2015 UTC,"I've been rooting for the Ottawa REDBLACKS since I heard someone describe them as the Canadian Browns. They had their team taken away but just came back as an expansion team last year. Plus if you put red and black together, they kinda almost make brown.  Also, the Tiger Cats are pretty much the Canadian Steelers (Black and Yellow team from steel town) so fuck them.  It gives me something to get emotionally invested in."

Browns,3bxqgb,Brokewood,3,Fri Jul 3 01:57:30 2015 UTC,"Ya I agree it's totally different. I don't like the 3 downs, lots of kicking. Also find that the plays are a lot more uninteresting due to such a wide field. Hard to put it in words but all the open space + only 3 downs makes the play calling really uneventful for me.   Also, the defense has to be a stupid distance away from the line of scrimmage, which I understand I guess to due to only 3 downs but i find it retarded.   And I guess at the end of it all they're just B tier athletes that can't put on a show like NFL athletes can."
Browns,3bxqgb,Godszn,2,Fri Jul 3 04:08:35 2015 UTC,It's almost completely a different sport.  But i don't know how a 25 year old that's out of the league improves otherwise.
Browns,3bxqgb,stangstang,2,Fri Jul 3 03:02:35 2015 UTC,If you want an Ohio connection - the quarterback for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (who were in the Grey Cup last season) was the starting QB for Steubenville when they won the D3 championship in '05 and '06.

Browns,3bvewf,SwiftBacon,5,Thu Jul 2 13:49:21 2015 UTC,This tweet doesn't seem to make sense.  Why would running more routes increase your yards / routes run?  Routes is in the denominator... Increasing that would decrease routes/ yards run.    Am I missing some obvious reason why running more routes increases the average?
Browns,3bvewf,Odihn,10,Thu Jul 2 14:02:34 2015 UTC,"It probably means that the browns weren't known for their passing attack. It's saying that although the browns weren't known for utilizing a heavy pass offense, it was still effective. I think the browns are so high because when we did pass it would be a bootleg rollout to someone running deep after we had ran a lot of run plays prior."
Browns,3bvewf,Mustang1718,3,Thu Jul 2 14:17:25 2015 UTC,"Bingo. The way to stretch this number out is to pass fewer times but land long passes when you do. It seems to favor a run-oriented play-action pass offense over a West Coast offense scheme.  What is the significance of yards/route run anyway? I saw the Bears were the worst last year because they threw a million screens. But what does it do besides show what your scheme is? It doesn't seem to show efficiency too much to me, but I could be wrong."
Browns,3bvewf,Marzman315,2,Thu Jul 2 16:44:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess it really isn't an efficiency thing, just evaluating the offense really"
Browns,3bvewf,cubert2,3,Thu Jul 2 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"It all goes back to the o-line in my opinion. Hoyer was awful but his strengths were in the short passes and play action. The o-line opened run lanes that were exploited by young running backs and defenses had no choice but to accommodate for them. Therefore the play action ripped teams to shreds. That strategy seems to be what our offense is built around. On the outside you have two guys that have different skillsets. Bowe, who, while he has had issues with drops, is well noted for having an uncanny ability to make catches in traffic, and Hartline, a 6'4"" possession guy. On the inside you have Hawkins and Gabriel, speedsters with good hands and YAC capabilities. Factor in potential wildcards like Mayle and Pryor and you have a receiving corps that may not have the big names or double team magnets that would be ideal, but one that has multiple skills and brings an array of various talents. That is why I wasn't and still am not concerned about adding a major playmaker. Our QB situation is not great and a star wideout is not going to help that. Our best chance at a formidable offense is to take the same approach that won us 7 games last year. Power running and play action. Add a dominant o-line and Manziel's (if he is indeed the starter which I personally think he will be) mobility, and bam. You have an offense that may not be flashy, but one that is able to do damage in a number of ways and prey on mismatches. Also factoring in the good field position that our defense will frequently allow us to have. It's not too tough to see what the strategy is, and with the strategy in place, a star wide-out won't really make a huge difference."
Browns,3brg8t,hmbeast,8,Wed Jul 1 15:33:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the insight.  Right now we have Whitner under contract until 2018 and Gipson on his RFA tender.  If Gipson walks next season they might look to him to take over that role depending on if the team sees him as a free or strong safety."
Browns,3brg8t,miked1be,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:42:38 2015 UTC,If Gipson walks we have Poyer and he is fairly good. I'd rather have Gip but we will see how it plays out.
Browns,3brg8t,bmcclure937,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:45:07 2015 UTC,"Also it seems like with our defense, we can plug any intelligent player into the FS slot and have him put up good numbers."
Browns,3brg8t,Doyle524,3,Thu Jul 2 03:46:28 2015 UTC,"You can find safeties anytime.  4th rounder?  All I'll say is Gipson was undrafted.  I know Campbell is more of a SS, but if he was the heir apparent somehow- I'll call that a win."
Browns,3brg8t,irishtide,5,Wed Jul 1 17:16:49 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, that can be said about any position really. But you can't just sit there and bank on finding diamond-in-the-rough players who were undrafted. Gipson is a rare case, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say that most of the elite safeties in the NFL right now and in the past were drafted in the 1st few rounds, or at the very least...drafted."
Browns,3brg8t,liquidswordzman,2,Wed Jul 1 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"That and outside of QB, quality safeties are hardest to find in the league right now. It's almost arguable that more teams have a starting-caliber QB than they do FS or SS. We're very lucky to have our starters."
Browns,3brg8t,Mustang1718,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this, awesome to have personal insight to a new member of the family.  I'm excited to have Campbell on the team, even though he won't see the field on defense for a few years.  Whitner isn't going anywhere and I don't see Campbell as a FS.  Luckily we'll see him ball out as a special teams player and know that Whitner has a worthy backup."

Tressel brings up a good point that makes me believe if he's even slightly competent at receiver he will make the team. IF McCown and Manziel both go down I really don't think it matters if it's Shaw, Lewis, or Pryor throwing the ball at that point."

Well we got to 7-4 and started losing, but I still had a smile on my face. People were bitching up a storm and I was just sitting here thinking ""we are one season removed from 4 wins, I'm happy about a measurable improvement."" Sure there some are questions about certain players and certain positions, but once it's sorted out, cleveland is going to win more and eventually make the playoffs. I'd rather be patient and get there as a contender than sneak in when we don't belong and get smashed in the wildcard weekend. It's all baby steps, and we're taking them. I've always got hope, and I don't get disappointed in a loss unless we really just blew it. We'll find answers to a lot of questions about the team this season. And I'm hopeful!"

It's gonna be hard enough for him to convert to a WR in like two months without the added baggage of trying to be a slash player.

Browns,3bqwvo,wickedshxt,3,Wed Jul 1 17:55:45 2015 UTC,"Being cut for being a QB, yes.  However, if you can save a roster spot by having a WR that can jump in as a third string QB or just help out in practice it can be helpful.  More helpful than if he was just a WR or just a QB.  Also, him making this single comment to the media takes absolutely nothing away from him working as a WR.  Players can have lives and conversations off the football field."

Browns,3bqwvo,miked1be,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:44:06 2015 UTC,He can say this and hope it'll help his cause while focusing almost completely on learning the WR position.  You're acting like he's saying he's going to be splitting time training at WR and QB.  All he did was make a statement.

Browns,3bs4jl,giannini1222,8,Wed Jul 1 18:28:40 2015 UTC,"I'm glad Johnny got a good taste of the NFL in those last games, and walked away knowing he'd have to double-down to make it.    Hoyer wasn't going to be sticking around anyway."
Browns,3bs4jl,NoMagic,2,Wed Jul 1 19:25:15 2015 UTC,"I really hope that between his performance in those games and his stint in rehab that he realizes the situation he's in. He has all the tools to be great, just has to get his head on straight and buckle down.   That's also true that Hoyer was most likely going to bounce after the way things went down, maybe it was for the best. I just think our QB situation now isn't any better than it was a year ago.  If Manziel can get it together and with the additions we've made on both sides of the ball, we can be a legit contender. Maybe McCown can catch lightning in a bottle like he did in Chicago and get the offense straight."
Browns,3bs4jl,Marzman315,21,Wed Jul 1 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"No, that's fucking ridiculous. Did you see him in the Indianapolis game? He single handedly lost it for us. He was far and away the worst QB in the league going leading up to his benching. Before Mack got hurt, the line and the run game let him coast by on the play action. When he was trusted to run the offense he was about as bad as a QB could possibly be. His benching wasn't just for the shits and giggles of letting Manziel play like so many people have inexplicably convinced themselves.  When a QB is single handedly losing games, you fucking bench him. Hoyer should have even benched the week before. He was legitimately damaging the team with his horrendous play. He wasn't managing any games he was repeatedly turning the ball over and consistently missing wide open receivers."
Browns,3bs4jl,Marzman315,6,Wed Jul 1 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, Manziel played in six fucking quarters. Hoyer had long ruined our playoff chances and playing him was a last ditch desperate effort to make the playoffs. Yes Manziel played badly, but in the game he played (in the forced read option) the entire team played terribly unlike the last few Hoyer losses where everyone played great except him. So if you see guy A lose multiple games with a great supporting cast and see guy B lose one game with the team playing terribly, and blame guy B for ruining the season and missing the playoffs, I want the fucking drugs you're taking."
Browns,3bs4jl,fap-the-potato,2,Wed Jul 1 18:43:32 2015 UTC,"Hoyer had long ruined our playoff chances and playing him was a last ditch desperate effort to make the playoffs.   We were 7-6 when he got yanked, still could have made a run at the playoffs. I understand Hoyer was playing poorly, but who's to say he couldn't have rebounded?  I honestly would love for Manziel to prove me wrong and fuckin ball out this year, but it just doesn't seem like he can play in the NFL. Six quarters or not, dude hasn't even passed the eye test.   If Manziel even sees the field this year I'd be amazed. If he puts up decent numbers anywhere near league average, I'll eat my Tim Couch jersey."
Browns,3bs4jl,ArcaneNine,7,Wed Jul 1 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"Can we hold you to this ""eating my tim couch jersey"" scenario?"
Browns,3bs4jl,Marzman315,7,Wed Jul 1 19:07:34 2015 UTC,Absolutely. And I'll be happy to do so if Manziel can get his shit together and become a decent QB.
Browns,3bs4jl,Daviroth,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:09:02 2015 UTC,When we lost that Colts game we lost any real chance at the playoffs. There were so many other teams in the AFC with good records that we would need a miracle out of our team to get to the playoffs. We put in Manziel because he was an unknown 1st round pick and we wanted to see what we had with them. If he was bad then we would at least get a better pick. Hoyer was clearly not going to be the starting QB of a winning team. Pettine got the timing right with the QB switch because he was thinking long-term.
Browns,3bs4jl,Marzman315,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:05:01 2015 UTC,"You're letting your silly hate for Manziel cloud your judgement. That Indy game (and Falcons game.... And Bills game....) were inexcusable. We had lost several games in a row and Hoyer was getting worse in every single one. There was no reason to believe he'd rebound. He was given the chance to start against Indy despite everyone calling for his benching (not Manziel's start, Hoyer's benching). Especially after Manziel's impressive TD drive against Buffalo that everyone has forgotten about.   Your ridiculous disdain for Manziel has led you into this insane logic that Hoyer wasn't responsible for the Browns troubles late last year. If you watched those last few games he started and think that should be what we expect at QB you're certifiable. Is Manziel the answer at QB? Maybe, maybe not. But to blame him after he barely played last year for the Browns missing the playoffs eater than Hoyer who played several terrible games with a great supporting cast is outright nonsense."
Browns,3bs4jl,Coniuratos,5,Wed Jul 1 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"I don't hate him at all. I was excited to see him play, but he doesn't play well at all.   If your ridiculous love for Manziel has led you into the insane logic that he even deserved to be on the field last year, you should probably re-watch how he played."
Browns,3bs4jl,hatmantc,2,Wed Jul 1 19:07:43 2015 UTC,"Manziel didn't earn being on the field last year. But Hoyer had to go, he was losing us games."
Browns,3bs4jl,hatmantc,-5,Thu Jul 2 11:09:32 2015 UTC,Are you fucking serious? Let's use hindsight to determine wether or not a guy should have played or not.  Hopefully the mods will delete this nonsense post for wasting space on the page sooner rather than later.
Browns,3bs4jl,Brokewood,7,Wed Jul 1 19:11:22 2015 UTC,"Dude, calm down. It's a discussion board. The mods don't need to delete a post just because you disagree with the premise."
Browns,3bs4jl,Brokewood,0,Wed Jul 1 20:20:35 2015 UTC,"He didn't look good in training camp, preseason, or the 6 quarters that he played last season. Has he done anything in the NFL to convince you he can be any good?"
Browns,3bs4jl,patagonian_pegasus,2,Wed Jul 1 19:15:02 2015 UTC,same could be said for Hoyer.. Neither of them looked good in Preseason.. Hoyer might have had a one or two games where he looked good.. but he had more games where he looked poor
Browns,3bs4jl,Marzman315,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"one or two games where he looked good.. but he had more games where he looked poor   I'd say it was more half and half, but I don't disagree that he ended up playing like garbage."
Browns,3bs4jl,fireeight,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:20:43 2015 UTC,with the way his play was trending.. you answered your own question.. no he wouldn't have lead us to the playoffs
Browns,3bs4jl,miked1be,2,Wed Jul 1 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"Don't you feel 7 quarters of play, with no run game, a 4th string Center, and a terrible scheme being forced upon him it's a little hasty to judge?"
Browns,3bs4jl,miked1be,0,Wed Jul 1 19:27:10 2015 UTC,"I really hope it is, but he still had the same running game we had all season and the same center Hoyer was playing with after Mack went down.   I agree Shanahan absolutely fucked him with the playbook, those sweeps he ran were a death sentence for Manziel."
Browns,3bs4jl,fireeight,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"I really hope it is, but he still had the same running game we had all season and the same center Hoyer was playing with after Mack went down.   But this was the death sentence for Hoyer. Once Mack went down (and/or we went up against teams that could actually stop the run) the whole purpose of the play action was negated. Teams knew we weren't a threat to rush, so our offense became 1 dimensional. Add to that, our center became a liability against the pass rush.  Was Hoyer short changed? Probably. But that Colts game was 1000% winnable. That Falcons game was won in spite of Hoyer, not because of him."
Browns,3bs4jl,fireeight,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:52:35 2015 UTC,How about his first appearance against the Bills?
Browns,3bs4jl,Marzman315,0,Thu Jul 2 15:33:48 2015 UTC,"He was far and away the worst QB in the league going leading up to his benching. Before Mack got hurt, the line and the run game let him coast by on the play action. When he was trusted to run the offense he was about as bad as a QB could possibly be.   I think you're being a bit hyperbolic there man. And you cannot possibly believe that there wasn't pressure to put in Manziel ever since he was drafted, the Colts game was just a convenient pretext to throw him in there."
Browns,3bs4jl,Marzman315,4,Wed Jul 1 18:38:31 2015 UTC,"Losing a game where you consistently had field position at the 50 yard line, the defense scoring 21 points, and going against one of the worst defenses in the league who were missing their best player is a hell of a convenience. And that's bullshit because no serious Browns fans were clamoring for Manziel until Hoyer started playing terribly. And it isn't hyperbolic. Know where Hoyer ranked among starting QBs in QB rating? 33rd. That is fucking abysmal."
Browns,3bs4jl,hatmantc,2,Wed Jul 1 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"I still think that we would have had a better chance finishing out the season with Hoyer. What were we going to do, super-lose the last 5 games? Odds are he would have bounced back."
Browns,3bs4jl,bearsdriving,7,Wed Jul 1 19:01:42 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious why we're hyperbolating about a situation from the past, with an athlete who no longer plays for our team.   Under pressure, Hoyer made some of the worst decisions I've ever seen a QB make. Every time that I think about the Hoyer situation, I remind myself that literally none of the 31 other NFL teams considered him a starter, and our situation was so bleak that we didn't have a choice."
Browns,3bs4jl,miked1be,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"Because it's the offseason and I thought it was interesting to think about for one; and also because we now have a 36 year old QB that went 1-10 last year, a dude that just got out of rehab, a second year player with a noodle arm, and someone we already cut 2 years ago.   Hoyer may have played like garbage for a few games, but he's still got the best record for a Browns QB since DA."
Browns,3bs4jl,themitey1,5,Wed Jul 1 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"McCown played similarly to Hoyer with one of the worst offensive lines in the league (even without Mack ours was good, especially in pass protection), no run game, and an offensive coordinator that was literally not there all season.  That doesn't look too good for Hoyer."
Browns,3bs4jl,hatmantc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping McCown can have a year like he did with Chicago for us, he's got a solid arm. I'm just concerned with his age as a QB, he won't be able to finish out the season. Manziel is most likely our best option if he can pull it together. Having a great arm and maneuverability in the pocket is what makes Russell Wilson great."
Browns,3bs4jl,hatmantc,4,Wed Jul 1 20:02:46 2015 UTC,I'm definitely not expecting much with McCown outside of not fucking up if he's being carried by the team.  There's a very good chance that he starts week 1 and if he does he could probably put together a few wins like Hoyer did last year.  I just hope Manziel can figure shit out and start after about halfway through the season or earlier or McCown will probably start to falter and we'll end the season on a low note again.
Browns,3bs4jl,Brokewood,2,Wed Jul 1 20:08:13 2015 UTC,I just hope Manziel can figure shit out and start after about halfway through the season or earlier or McCown will probably start to falter and we'll end the season on a low note again.   That's honestly the worst thing that could possibly happen to this team. We'll be hearing Fail for Cardale halfway through the season; no turning back after that.  Johnny is definitely the best option if he can just use his talents properly. Young dude with a rocket arm could be the face of the franchise if he stays out of trouble.
Browns,3bs4jl,Brokewood,2,Wed Jul 1 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"I get it, and I get that it's the offseason, so there aren't a whole hell of a lot of interesting things happening in the football world. Based on what you saw from Hoyer though, do you want him to lead our team in the future? Assuming he bounced back (which he didn't), do you want him as our franchise guy? We saw what we saw,  and we saw the exact reasons that no other team looks at him as a starter. Based on that information, do you want him as our starter? I saw a guy who threw into double and triple coverage consistently. I'm glad that we gave him the time that we did, so that we could remove all doubt that he is not, in fact, an NFL-caliber starting quarterback.   It was time to move on. The immediate result was not what we hoped for, but at least we know with certainty that Brian Hoyer is not or solution."
Browns,3bs4jl,Marzman315,3,Wed Jul 1 20:07:33 2015 UTC,"I was really just hoping the hometown dude could pull it together and be a decent QB. Carson Palmer played like shit in Oakland but he got it together the past 2 years in Arizona. After seeing that and seeing that Hoyer was capable of the occasional comeback from a shitty half or so, it seemed like a possibility."
Browns,3bs4jl,Spartan_55,2,Wed Jul 1 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with you at all. I wanted him to succeed not only as the hometown guy, but as the quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. After a while though, his inadequacies started to overshadow whatever hidden potential that we believed he may have had.   Then, he started to blame his teammates for broken plays and losses. That's where I lost all of my faith in him as a leader, and that's when I was done with wanting to watch him lead us."
Browns,3bs4jl,740Buckeye,-5,Wed Jul 1 20:46:51 2015 UTC,You're defending Hoyer of all people yet accusing Manziel of having a noodle arm?? Lol you're fucking clueless. This thread is a joke.

Browns,3bs4jl,ArcadeNineFire,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:25:00 2015 UTC,That's just stupid. Why bother trying something different and risky to try and win some games since we have nothing to lose when we can just curl up and die and wait until next year?  Your hatred for Manziel has completely ruined whatever good judgement you have. I honestly believe you dislike him more than you like the Browns if you think giving him a shot after Hoyer's complete collapse last year was that terrible an idea.
Browns,3bs4jl,rodion_kjd,0,Wed Jul 1 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"Why bother trying something different and risky to try and win some games since we have nothing to lose when we can just curl up and die and wait until next year?   Because we were still in it dude, 7-6 isn't bad.  And I don't know how many times I have to say I don't hate Manziel, I'm just being realistic. Did you see anything he did on the field last year that looked promising?"
Browns,3bs4jl,GoofBoy,3,Wed Jul 1 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"You know the game where Hoyer threw two INTs in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter when the defense shut down the Falcons offense? Funny how you leave that out.   You also left out that he got us in position to win that game. He overcame his shittiness to get us in a spot to win. Funny how you left that out.    Period. End of story. Hoyer sucked ass, and lost the starting job because of it. Change your diaper as get the fuck over it.   I have a mental image of you pounding your fists against your keyboard in anger. Please calm down and stop being fucking rude. I'm just trying to have a conversation, there's no need to get all crazy here dude."

Browns,3bn012,cleveland_14,6,Tue Jun 30 15:11:55 2015 UTC,I'm happy the screwy idea of ignoring free agency and building strictly from the draft is gone.  These are the kind of guys that can educate a locker room in ways the coaches just can't.
Browns,3bn012,NoMagic,2,Tue Jun 30 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't like about this free agency period is that we got older.  McCown (35), Hartline (28), Williams (32), Bowe (30), Starks (31), Housler (27) have an average age of 30.5  Cameron (26), Skrine (26), Hoyer (29), Sheard (26), Rubin (28), Austin (31) have an average age of 27.7  But I guess the positive of signing all those veterans is that they were only signed to 2-3 year deals and when those contracts are up we will more than likely not re-sign them so that cap space will be open.  For Skrine, Sheard, Rubin and Cameron, I like the idea of re-signing our draft picks and having continuity. Cameron was obviously out of our hands.  Skrine, Sheard and Rubin, while decent, were replaceable."
Browns,3bn012,OrnetteOrnette,3,Tue Jun 30 21:15:07 2015 UTC,They (free-agents) are all bridge players who will help our young guys learn the position (with the possible exception of Housler)  I'd be more concerned if we didn't have younger players at the position to step into these roles once the free agents decline due to age
Browns,3bn012,Abiv23,3,Tue Jun 30 21:54:25 2015 UTC,Thank god the days are gone where we come out of free agency with our biggest signing being Frostee Rucker.....
Browns,3bn012,cleveland_14,2,Tue Jun 30 18:59:45 2015 UTC,I like them grabbing solid vets that can help build a foundation and temporarily fill holes.  I'm glad they're not jumping completely into it though and signing big money guys coming off of their first contract that are starting bidding wars between teams.
Browns,3bn012,miked1be,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:05:36 2015 UTC,"When they signed Starks, the book on him said he is a run stopper, which made him a key addition in my mind.  If (as this article suggests) he'll be creating a consistent pass rush from the inside, the defense will be that much better as well, particularly on 3rd down.    If he has Dansby/Whitner type leadership inside, it will be a HUGE, difference making bonus."
Browns,3bs5rf,DixieFlatline78,13,Wed Jul 1 18:37:23 2015 UTC,"When has he ever been prone to tantrums? Everything I've read suggests he's been a hard worker in the NFL, just not good enough to be a true QB."

Browns,3bn9nn,wardsac,7,Tue Jun 30 16:14:55 2015 UTC,"If you have money and are willing to take a risk in exchange for a huge potential reward, do this:  1) Subscribe to a VPN that has servers all over the world, in Europe, Asia, etc. This shouldn't run you more than $50-$60 a year for a good one. I have one that's $60 and it's perfect.  2) Set up your VPN so that when you turn it on, it looks like your traffic is coming from Europe somewhere. Maybe the UK. Whatever works, and whatever is fastest. I can't tell you exactly how to do this because it varies from VPN to VPN and from computer to computer. You'll have to do the research–it's a little tricky, but it's not rocket science.  3) Go to gamepass.nfl.com. If it looks like it thinks you're from overseas and starts offering you packages to buy, you're in. If it knows about your VPN servers and blocks them, you're out. This could happen at any time and is absolutely unpredictable. Netflix has been making noise about cracking down on foreigners who use VPNs to make it look like they're in the US. If this happens with gamepass when you try to make it look like you're coming from London, it's not my fault. This is why you need money to do this.  4) Sign up for gamepass. This will give you access to all games streamed live, plus live feeds of NFL Network and RedZone. You'll also get coaches' film and all the other stuff that comes with the Rewind (I think that's the name) package in the U.S.  In terms of quality and reliability, this is probably your best bet. It's certainly not the least expensive, though. I think gamepass runs $270 or something, so you're looking at $330 or so for the year, including the VPN."

Browns,3bpavq,_MitchPlease,9,Wed Jul 1 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"Hopefully constructive criticism... There's actually a not uninteresting story buried in the article... Gruden not writing Johnny off, basically saying he's young, etc.    But it's lost in all this pointless op-ed stuff... ""As we all know this has not been the case.""    if we know, why retell us?   ""losing the respect of his teammates in the process.""    awfully sensationalistic   ""Losing offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan to Atlanta this offseason, coupled with his personal struggles to stay sober – it was no surprise that Johnny didn’t “wreck this league” like he thought he was going to.""   What would losing Kyle Shanahan this offseason have to do with Johnny not 'wrecking this league' last season?   ""While the NBA has faced it’s fair share of scrutiny over the one-and-done rule which allows college freshman to make the jump from college to the pros, the NFL requires athletes to complete three full seasons before making the leap. This is something that the one-time youngest offensive coordinator in the league has an issue with. “They shouldn’t be coming out this early,” Gruden said. “They missed two training camps, two regular seasons and two spring practices – and a lot of time to develop both mentally and physically.”   Sounds like you are saying the NFL doesn't let them leave early but Gruden is complaining about them leaving early because they miss 'two offseasons, two regular seasons and two spring practices'?  Isn't this contradictory?   ""maxi""???    You sure you don't mean ""moxie""?    You got to talk to Gruden about Johnny... it's cool you can report what he said... why interject the same bullshit being spewed by people who don't have anything interesting to report?   Would be a much better article if you had just stuck with reporting on Gruden's pre-draft and current assessments and been less sensationalistic in setting up the context.  For example, why not state things as they are - ""Johnny struggled playing 7 quarters""  instead of being all grandiose i.e. ""has been an utter disappointment and failure"".   No idea why I decided to write a critique.  Take it for what you will."

Browns,3bex0b,marrone12,2,Mon Jun 29 12:29:39 2015 UTC,"Having watched him try, it's as if he's trying to write his name left-handed. His body or mind just doesn't seem to process the request. He stumbles, looks confused, often looping back trying to reverse field.  He can cut left once he's started running to his right, like in the 93 yarder. But if the run starts left, it's already over.  Pryor running left is how Oakland ended up in so many 3rd and ""Don't even bother"" situations.  3rd & 48: Never Forget."
Browns,3bex0b,Play4Blood,3,Mon Jun 29 12:48:54 2015 UTC,"Having watched him run left many times at OSU, I have to wonder if this is more a problem with Oakland's blocking than it is with Pryor.

Not putting Brown in that category.   Pryor can learn a lot from both, and I'm interested in seeing what he can do for Cleveland. I think it creates a unique possibility. Keep him as a QB and WR. He's got starting experience under center and he can still work as a receiver with maybe a meeting or two with the QBs. It's a way to justify keeping him on the roster even if he probably won't see the field."

Browns,3bb6z9,omnidub,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:34:22 2015 UTC,Mingo better get that edge or we need another pass rusher.
Browns,3bb6z9,SuperPoop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:46:46 2015 UTC,I think Mingo is going to end up doing a lot of coverage and other stuff that will not get stats but will free other guys.  Coaches will love what he does for them even if the fans don't get it.  Just my feeling that O'Neal et. al. will find ways to use the athleticism to put wrinkles in the overall scheme to make it hard on opposing offenses to match up.  Mingo is not a play maker but he is an insane athlete.  Let's hope they get some value from him.

Browns,3b7yrd,bearsdriving,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:03:33 2015 UTC,I'd argue that him being available makes him the most valuable.  He's worth paying a premium for to lure him from other teams.

Browns,3b7yrd,AnonymousBrownsFan,3,Sun Jun 28 18:41:24 2015 UTC,I think he's a pretty good QB but the system makes him look better than he is. Actually think he would do better in Cleveland though with our great Oline

Browns,3b7yrd,omnidub,4,Fri Jun 26 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"They're saying he should get paid more because the salary cap is higher since Rodgers got his contract. Player value is looked at in terms of how much you're spending on them in overall cap percentage rather than in dollars, and if you do that Rodgers is still worth more in terms of cap percentage back when he signed his contract then Wilson will be when he signs his if he gets what he wants."

He could end up getting more money than Rodgers very easily though as QB contracts have been climbing in the past couple years pretty heavily especially if he goes out on the open market and teams have to lure him away from other teams."

Browns,3b7yrd,stangstang,3,Fri Jun 26 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to say Russell Wilson is a terrible quarterback, he isn't. But frankly I'm beginning to think the biggest reason RW has been successful id because Pete Carroll was given the stability by the Seahawks organization to pick his guy and develop him. I'm not certain that many teams (Browns especially) could've been as successful with him as Seattle has.  Additionally, it doesn't hurt that Seattle has had a pretty dominant defense practically his entire tenure. The organization has been successful because they bought into RW, but Russell has probably owes a lot of success to the fact that his development was spurred because he was drafted by a very well organized franchise."

Browns,3b9bz5,Brokewood,2,Sun Jun 28 13:55:23 2015 UTC,I personally would go a size larger than usual because the stripes on the shoulder pull the sides in a little.

Browns,3b6uh1,gakule,0,Fri Jun 26 17:26:14 2015 UTC,I just hate that we signed Bowe for as much money as we did. The guy is washed up and is taking playing time from our talented midgets.
Browns,3b6uh1,fuckingbrowns,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:43:00 2015 UTC,I don't recall the structuring of his contract...is he someone who could be a candidate to be cut if he doesn't pan out in training camp? I guess that would depend on his guaranteed money.
Browns,3b6uh1,SnakeLaFleur,2,Fri Jun 26 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"No he's got nine million in guaranteed money so he'll more than likely be around for the next two years. Even if he can't play as well, it's nice to have a mentor in the wr room."

Browns,3b6uh1,fuckingbrowns,0,Fri Jun 26 17:46:25 2015 UTC,"Serious question.... Why is running routes in the NFL so hard?  What makes a good wide receiver?  I don't understand, if you can get off the ball, have good cuts, and catch the ball.... That seems easy for a gifted athlete. Am I missing something?"
Browns,3b6uh1,SuperPoop,3,Fri Jun 26 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"That seems easy for a gifted athlete   For an athlete to have all of the above plus NFL size is a rarity. Let's take a look at some of our current and past receivers.   Josh Gordon - He's the total package, a legitimate #1. Also a retard. Hawkins/Gabriel - Excellent cuts and acceleration. Lacking size. Could start at #2/#3 on many teams. Bowe - Used to be a bona fide #1, but thumb injuries have caused a ton of drops lately. Lost speed makes me question why he's on our team. Braylon Edwards/Greg Little - They have the size, strength, speed, and acceleration to be #1 receivers. Can't catch a cold, and they were 1st and 2nd round picks. Mohammed Massaquoi - Receiver who was on just the wrong side of the bell curve, nothing exceptional, but no red flags either, also a 2nd round pick Brian Robiskie - Sucked. 2nd round pick.   My point is that 1 or 2 of the traits you listed are common on many NFL athletes, but to get all of them plus NFL size? There are probably only about 10-15 guys like that in the league."

Browns,3b5khv,professor_tappensac,5,Fri Jun 26 03:58:43 2015 UTC,What if we never sent nor received from our match?
Browns,3b5khv,-shoop-,8,Fri Jun 26 04:56:00 2015 UTC,Bad form. I know Pabsty puts a lot of work into the matches and monitoring everything.
Browns,3b5khv,bowhunter6274,3,Fri Jun 26 09:52:31 2015 UTC,He never asked for my address or got back to me about spending limit. I assumed he just wanted free beer..
Browns,3b5khv,-shoop-,3,Fri Jun 26 14:15:36 2015 UTC,In context that makes sense. Sometimes you just get a shitty partner. It happened to me one year. We agreed on an amount and he shorted me claiming the box must have busted open on the way and that's all that was left that didn't get broken. They get black flagged the next year.
Browns,3b5khv,bowhunter6274,4,Fri Jun 26 14:56:30 2015 UTC,that's all that was left that didn't get broken. They get black flagged the next year.   Yeah that dude stiffed you. If a bottle breaks they don't just repack the remaining items and keep shipping it. Technically what we're doing isn't 'legal' in the sense.   The only reason I know they don't continue the shipment is because my shipment to my partner got damaged and a bottle broke and they shipped it right back to me even though it was out for delivery that day to his place.
Browns,3b5khv,fear865,3,Fri Jun 26 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I spent about 50-70 dollars on the guy, and ended up drinking all of the beer myself. It was a wonderful draft."
Browns,3b5khv,-shoop-,2,Fri Jun 26 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Same :/  Edit: my match just PM'd me, no worries!"
Browns,3b5khv,pfftYeahRight,2,Fri Jun 26 12:25:11 2015 UTC,"You too, that sucks man. Maybe you and OP should swap some brews?"

Browns,3b10m6,cynosurescence,14,Thu Jun 25 02:36:22 2015 UTC,love it but can't believe he's rated better than Joe Thomas
Browns,3b10m6,QueefStain,7,Thu Jun 25 04:57:34 2015 UTC,Yeah especially since I wouldn't consider last year one of Haden's best.
Browns,3b10m6,aggroCrag32,4,Thu Jun 25 13:59:07 2015 UTC,"If you look at like the last 10 games Haden was playing batshit insane. It's the first couple of games where he was off, but outside of that he was unbelievable."
Browns,3b10m6,Daviroth,2,Thu Jun 25 19:56:07 2015 UTC,The whole defense shat down their leg for the beginning of the season. Well the rush defense kept shitting but that's a different story.
Browns,3b10m6,kpyle,2,Fri Jun 26 01:46:23 2015 UTC,As the league becomes more pass-oriented the lock-down corner has increased in value trememndously. While I would never undersell Joe Thomas' value we still need good lineman around him for his usefulness to be apparent. Whereas Haden is guarding the other teams best receiver pretty much by himself week to week.
Browns,3b10m6,LosingMyEdge7,5,Thu Jun 25 18:26:41 2015 UTC,Love that play against Julio.
Browns,3b10m6,dentwreckless,9,Thu Jun 25 05:57:32 2015 UTC,"Only thing that's odd to me is that unless Patrick Peterson isn't on the list, he's ranked higher than Haden. That really doesn't make sense to me at all"
Browns,3b10m6,RylanTheWalrus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:38:04 2015 UTC,PP might not be on the list. Didn't he have an absolute shit year last year?
Browns,3b10m6,Daviroth,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:56:37 2015 UTC,He also didn't have much help because they stacked the box like every down. The front seven had so many injuries to key players that the defensive scheme involved intentionally giving up some yards in the passing game to keep pressure on the QB and stop the run.
Browns,3b10m6,ArcaneNine,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:03:06 2015 UTC,I don't think he's a better corner back.  But what he means to that team is a lot more than joe to the browns

Browns,3b10m6,Squidward-Tentpoles,0,Thu Jun 25 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"Not that peterson deserves to be above haden, cause he doesn't. But if there's any team you shouldn't call team bias against it's the cardinals. The media hates us almost as much as they hate the browns"

Browns,3b1bnt,jswolfie316,10,Fri Jun 26 13:06:14 2015 UTC,"I don't really see it that astounding imo.   The entirety of a defensive unit and offensive line are usually unsung hereos. They protect the QB while the QB is the one getting the interviews and massive endorsements, etc."

Above average QB at this point, still makes way too many mental mistakes, just seems like he is ""graded"" off of reputation for years now?"
Browns,3b1bnt,subhuman1,12,Thu Jun 25 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"See I'm just the opposite. I detest the Steelers organization and have zero respect for the organization. Their coach is a cheater, their QB is a rapist, and their disgusting fanbase is made up primarily of inbred hillbillies.   That being said, I begrudgingly admit that their dispicable rapist QB is one of the best in the league."

Browns,3b1bnt,TapedeckNinja,2,Thu Jun 25 16:33:23 2015 UTC,I'm not a Steelers hater at all   Get out.
Browns,3ayzrz,bowhunter6274,7,Wed Jun 24 17:08:28 2015 UTC,I really hope he lives up the expectations. Being compared to Shady and Gio is a huge compliment. Gonna be interesting to see what this trio of backs can do for our offense.
Browns,3ayzrz,corysagaming,3,Wed Jun 24 17:10:36 2015 UTC,Im in the same boat.   As much as it pains me to say it Le'veon Bell is prolly the most exciting runner to watch in the NFL right now.  Im hoping the Duke can go toe to toe with him when we match up.   Cant wait to see him shredding the field right back down their throats.
Browns,3ayzrz,miked1be,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see that.  Duke would probably need a bit more size to sustain the playing time that Bell gets though as Bell is 6'1"" 244 and Duke was 5'9"" 207 at the combine.  He's beefier than McCoy though so there's that."
Browns,3ayzrz,JohnnyFire,2,Thu Jun 25 12:46:44 2015 UTC,"I still want Duke to be our bigger version of Darren Sproles with his pass catching ability; not the biggest guy, not the scariest guy, but the guy that will make you pay the most if you forget about him in the open field."
Browns,3ayzrz,stangstang,4,Wed Jun 24 18:36:04 2015 UTC,That's what he's shaping up to be.   He'll be a big part of the offense.  I'm looking for big things from this guy

Browns,3awvln,AnonymousBrownsFan,17,Wed Jun 24 12:40:09 2015 UTC,It worked for the Buckeyes.
Browns,3awvln,fuuuuuuuuuuuck216,2,Wed Jun 24 13:09:19 2015 UTC,that's assuming he can catch the ball.
Browns,3awvln,emdubl,4,Wed Jun 24 16:22:49 2015 UTC,Gotta be better than Greg Little's hands.
Browns,3awvln,High_Im_Caleb,3,Thu Jun 25 10:27:28 2015 UTC,"QB's typically have excellent catching skills.  Young QB's have to toss balls back an forth with each other from around age 11 or younger in some cases.  They get more catching reps than any other position.  I know it's not the same as a live game, but thousands of reps of receiving a ball from another trained QB does develop skill."
Browns,3awvln,MonarchStarcrack,0,Fri Jun 26 18:12:17 2015 UTC,"I don't get this, I've read it on /r/nfl and /r/FantastyFootball but no one has supported that claim.   I mean he is a QB, but he has caught all three passes going to him in college. Not sure why people say he has rock hands."
Browns,3awvln,bearsdriving,3,Wed Jun 24 19:43:55 2015 UTC,I mean three passes isn't a great sample size so that's why people are saying that. With that being said he should have good hands otherwise he wont be a WR for long.
Browns,3awvln,fear865,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:54:07 2015 UTC,He's still caught more passes then he dropped
Browns,3awvln,_vsrs_,2,Thu Jun 25 01:42:41 2015 UTC,i didnt say he can or cant catch. but there is a big difference between catching balls in practice and in nfl games. there are lots of guys with size and speed that cant consistently catch a thrown football.
Browns,3awvln,emdubl,8,Wed Jun 24 21:06:38 2015 UTC,a Little true
Browns,3awvln,iliekdrugs,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:05:35 2015 UTC,"Well, he has caught an NFL pass, so there's that. It isn't much, but it's more than most QBs. We'll see what he's got now that he's switching positions full-time. If it's not there, it's not there. But if it is, he could be a nice weapon."
Browns,3awvln,JasonNafziger,0,Wed Jun 24 22:31:03 2015 UTC,"yeah, well Elway also caught 3 passes in his career. 1 for a TD, but I would never consider him a viable WR.   :)"
Browns,3awvln,emdubl,2,Wed Jun 24 22:57:43 2015 UTC,There is a massive difference in raw physical talent between Elway and Pryor....
Browns,3awvln,twdavis18,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:23:31 2015 UTC,Isn't it sub 4.4?
Browns,3awvln,Nightcinder,15,Sat Jun 27 12:41:22 2015 UTC,He is a really smooth runner. As long as he can learn his routes and catch at all he might actually have a chance at making the roster. Still wouldn't count on it though.
Browns,3awvln,ChairyCweed,7,Wed Jun 24 04:16:10 2015 UTC,He also needs to learn how to block. Ask Ernest Bynes if receivers need to block even by the endzone.
Browns,3awvln,Deadleggg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"I've been telling OSU fans he's a better WR prospect for the NFL for years. Idk if it'll work out but he is huge, really fast and good at making people miss in the open field. It's worked well enough for Denard at RB."
Browns,3awvln,LosingMyEdge7,8,Wed Jun 24 14:20:12 2015 UTC,"As an OSU Fan, every OSU fan I know knew when he was at Ohio State he would be a better WR prospect than a QB.    Agreeing with you, but I think most OSU fans already knew it.  I don't know a lot of Buckeye fans who thought he was a great QB.  Freak athlete, meh QB."
Browns,3awvln,wardsac,2,Wed Jun 24 14:43:49 2015 UTC,I live in Columbus so I really only talk to OSU fans outside of one of my brothers- probably came across a little more heavy handed than I wanted to. It's just tough to comprehend sometimes why a lot more of these super athelete college QB's don't come into the NFL with a more realistic idea of how best to utilize their skillset. Not to mention the ridiculously low amount of them that play more than 1-2 years at QB.
Browns,3awvln,LosingMyEdge7,2,Wed Jun 24 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"No worries, and totally agree.  I think with Pryor, his ego was bigger than even the usual star college football player.  Has been since he was in High School.  Lots of athletic QBs do come in understanding that their QB skills aren't going to cut it so they make a switch.  Edelman and Cribbs and Matt Jones come to mind.  But, as you said, far too many don't have anyone around them honest enough to tell them the truth."
Browns,3awvln,wardsac,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:11:10 2015 UTC,I think he'd make a better TE with his size though
Browns,3awvln,Nightcinder,27,Sat Jun 27 12:43:26 2015 UTC,"I'll be damned if this experiment works, but as long as it helps I'm all for it."

Browns,3awvln,Marzman315,11,Wed Jun 24 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"looks like it isn't even with the team, i see it as he's striving to get better @ wr even when he's not practicing with the team. I like it"
Browns,3awvln,740Buckeye,3,Wed Jun 24 08:27:11 2015 UTC,"yea that's at his old high school in Jeanette, PA. you can see the jayhawk painted on the stands. probably Jordan Hall on the video with him"
Browns,3awvln,moodyfloyd,2,Wed Jun 24 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"He's going to need to be doing a lot of work on his own if he wants to get anywhere near being able to compete for a roster spot this season.  He's an athletic freak and can run well when he gets the ball in his hands, just needs to get the ball in his hands first.  It would be freakin cool if this worked out though."
Browns,3awvln,miked1be,10,Wed Jun 24 15:49:35 2015 UTC,"Just let the guy run straight. If nothing else, the defenses would have to respect his speed which would open up at least one side of the field a little bit. I'm probably being way overly optimistic, but I think he's got a chance."
Browns,3awvln,Future_Timer,9,Wed Jun 24 13:41:25 2015 UTC,This or any kind of flag route or deep post where he runs across the defense. I have a good feeling this is gonna work out for us.
Browns,3awvln,ccavana3,4,Wed Jun 24 14:34:58 2015 UTC,this is why i think he's gonna make the team. If anything he can just be a situational guy that just runs straight lines and demands safety attention until he learns how to be a WR
Browns,3awvln,Godszn,3,Wed Jun 24 15:32:23 2015 UTC,Like Travis Benjamin. Just bigger and with (hopefully) the ability to catch a ball.
Browns,3awvln,KahlanRahl,2,Wed Jun 24 16:59:54 2015 UTC,exactly. Also with the size to be a potential #1
Browns,3awvln,Godszn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:38:19 2015 UTC,And more ACL's

Browns,3awvln,Future_Timer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:31:57 2015 UTC,Isn't that what they do?
Browns,3awvln,Ne007,2,Sat Jun 27 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"You know, besides the obvious corner fade, I'd kind of like to see Pryor run that quick-pass sweep (everybody calls it something different) that college teams love now. He's a devastating runner and pretty fast, even though teams seem to use smaller WRs for that play."
Browns,3awvln,JasonNafziger,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:26:15 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to call him a playmaker since he hasn't been once since college, but he's got all the physical attributes to be one as a WR and as they always say ""get the ball in the hands of your playmakers"". Screens, hitches, and slants very well may be our bread and butter IF this experiment pans out."
Browns,3awvln,Witness_My_Greatness,2,Wed Jun 24 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"since he hasn't been once since college   Well, the only relevant stat here would be his yards per carry (although he did have a 22-yard catch in 2012), and he averaged 5.1 yards on 10 carries in 2012 and 6.9 yards on 83 carries in 2013 (that includes a 93-yarder.)  Obviously, it's a wait-and-see situation, but if he turns out to be a decent WR, then he could be a major difference-maker with his ability to play from various positions. I'd be scared to death of him in the red zone if I was another team."
Browns,3awvln,JasonNafziger,0,Wed Jun 24 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, if I were the other team I would hope he was in on all redzone plays. A former QB who has never played WR? If I'm the defense, I'm salivating over that. Leave him in all game."
Browns,3awvln,AlexSPerry,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"He's a freakish athlete who's going to win the majority of jump balls against most DBs. He's run corner fades before and it's not exactly a complex concept.  Add to that the ability to move him into the backfield pre-snap to run the ball and you can catch the defense unprepared to stop a massive, agile ball-carrier whose momentum alone could be enough to get the ball in.  And then, of course, you have to at least consider the possibility that he might throw the ball. Maybe that's not his strong suit, but it's just one more thing for the D to be watching for."

Browns,3awvln,miked1be,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:58:21 2015 UTC,I've always thought he could be dangerous as a return-man. Just look at what he can do in the open field.
Browns,3awvln,rodion_kjd,2,Wed Jun 24 21:38:16 2015 UTC,He's taller than any successful return man I've seen.  They're generally smaller and can change direction quickly to avoid the entire other team that's running down the field straight at them.  Pryor is very fast but I think he'd be killed in the return game.

Browns,3awhxs,Kylekub,4,Wed Jun 24 02:34:35 2015 UTC,Point taken.  Agree with you on Brees.  Problem we have is average height of offensive linemen continue to grow.  My point was the he isn't likely to be successful if he stays in the pocket.
Browns,3awhxs,4Nails,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:13:25 2015 UTC,"I have hope.  The one throw against Buffalo that he zipped into the TE with the pocket collapsing around him, on the replay I said ""that looked like Drew Brees"". The ball came out in a collapsing window between linemen, just like Brees does so many times.  I know there's a gif of that slow mo replay but I was never able to save it.  Of course that drive was basically the only positive display he made on the field.

Frankly, it's more of a black mark we didn't interview him   Nobody said that. We had O'Connell working with him, that was probably the process. But they didn't go him directly most likely because they knew Tennessee or Tampa wasn't going to move and Farmer had already interviewed him before the 2014 draft process. It's not like they knew nothing on the kid.   You're telling me you're giving a pass to this from Front office in this fucked up qb position and they didn't explore all avenues and do their due diligence?   What the blue fuck does the front office have to do with this? This isn't a shot at the fucking front office, this isn't about the front office, this about every fucking media member for a month ahead of the draft standing on tables with their ""LOLBROWNS"" lapels on and going ""LOLBROWNS GONNA TRADE #3FIRSTROUNDERS TO THE TITANS #LOLBROWNS #BROWNSGONNABROWNS"" because it made for a good story, even up until draft day. Fucking hell, pundit after pundit stood up and claimed how in love the Browns were with Mariota and how they were going to give up everything to get him, and yet they did not, nor did it seem (after the fact) that they had any intention to.  Where in the blue fuck are you turning this into yet another tirade on the FO? The Titans were going to take Mariota regardless, so what the fuck could we do? Throw them 4 first rounders? Maybe a 5th? Maybe we could trade them Joe Haden too while we're at it. Sorry if that's overreacting, but nothing I said and nothing about this was on the FO not reaching out being a stupid thing, it's on every fucking media member in this country saying that the Browns were going to take Mariota and laughing at how stupid it would have been (regardless of if you think it would've been or not) because it would've required likely 3-4 first round draft picks to do, and that never freaking works. They built a narrative to directly feed into people who want to laugh at the FO, and why do I get the feeling if they had gone and gotten Mariota, there would've been a similar post from a certain someone in this forum saying:   Frankly, it's more of a black mark that we ever considered him. You're telling me you're giving a pass to this from Front office in this fucked up qb position to go beyond due diligence and trade away all our assets for an unproven QB? Come now.

Browns,3aunyg,JohnnyFire,-16,Tue Jun 23 21:34:47 2015 UTC,"It's not the media overreacting. They never reported we talked. Source? Link? You don't have it cause there isn't one. If anything, the browns would intentionally link bad info, so again complaining about the media is retarded.  The only true info you can gather is at our biggest need, at the most important position, they didn't interview him.  Hell the pats interviewed qbs with Brady and no team chance  because it's better to be prepared.

Browns,3aunyg,java-dev,16,Tue Jun 23 21:48:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, fine you're right. We should have traded 3 first rounders to get Marcus Mariota, a spread offense QB who you have said multiple times you hate, and probably thrown in Joe Thomas and Alex Mack and anything else we needed, and should've been talking to him constantly because it's not like Ray Farmer has been researching this guy for two years and Kevin O'Connell totally wasn't working with him  And you're absolutely right that this Browns-Mariota story was by no means a completely big fat media story made to laugh at the Browns and generate clicks.

Yet there were also just as many, much less sexy, much less publicized reports that the Titans were hugely in on Mariota from the get go.

I'm not fucking karma whoring, I'm fucking making a comment in a thread which is not inaccurate and not exclusively an issue with Browns fans, and while you accuse me of trying to whore karma and circle jerk and act outraged, you have blown up my inbox trash talking me in this thread.  All I said was, and where the fuck we got to the same tired argument out of this still confounds me, that the media was full of shit. And they were full of shit in 2012 when they said the Browns were going to trade up for RGIII, and they were full of shit when they said we were going to take Geno Smith at 6 in 2013, and they were full of shit with the whole ""Browns take Manziel at 4"" stuff in 2014. Eagles fans faced it this year too. Jets fans as well. The majority of the media picks one star or story and draws it out to the point of absurdity that even ESPN is shouting about how the Browns  (not may, will) will trade 3 picks to move up 10 spots just to be the first to guess it correctly.  There is no argument on my behalf being made about the front office, because I wasn't trying to make a fucking statement on the front office, because I was making a fucking passing statement in a fucking thread for fun, because that's what you fucking do in a discussion; you discuss things. Your version of a discussion is ""let me take this, and put it in a completely different direction than you and prove how wrong you are about something completely nonsequitor"".  Please, stop commenting on my posts. This has been two days of this and it's not fun and it's not cool and it's getting really annoying. I'm asking you nicely. I opened my inbox to just a flood of username mentions for no fucking reason. I don't like Johnny Manziel as much as other people here like them. I call out when the FO is fucking up as I did on the 2014 draft. Please, please leave me be and find another target for your rage on the front office.

Browns,3aunyg,java-dev,2,Tue Jun 23 22:53:19 2015 UTC,So they did this right?  You said it was more of a black mark than anything.  You wouldn't ever be contradicting though...
Browns,3aunyg,miked1be,-11,Tue Jun 23 23:13:06 2015 UTC,Either A: its a black mark  or B:  Johnnyfire is completely offbase and karma farming.  Your pick.
Browns,3aunyg,java-dev,2,Tue Jun 23 23:16:16 2015 UTC,You said it was more of a black mark than anything then agreed with someone that said they did the right thing.  Your pick.
Browns,3aunyg,miked1be,-7,Tue Jun 23 23:19:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, its a black mark in my opinion.  But if it isn't, then he's talking out his ass."
Browns,3aunyg,java-dev,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"...  Or, and hear me out...  C: The Browns did beyond their due diligence by hiring the one guy who knows the most about Mariota as a prospect."

Browns,3aunyg,Kylekub,6,Tue Jun 23 18:27:59 2015 UTC,We didn't need it. We hired someone intimately familiar with him.

Browns,3aunyg,fuckingbrowns,3,Tue Jun 23 19:49:40 2015 UTC,Why are we still talking about this?
Browns,3aunyg,rderekp,2,Wed Jun 24 04:08:26 2015 UTC,It was a recent quote from Mariota saying he didn't have contact with the Browns during the draft process.  He must have been asked about it or something so him saying it is news.  It's the off season.
Browns,3aunyg,miked1be,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:58:31 2015 UTC,"I more meant, ""Why are reporters asking him about this? Who cares? The draft is over."""
Browns,3aunyg,rderekp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:38:30 2015 UTC,I think it's because the rookie symposium is going on right now in Cleveland so rookies are getting more time with the media than they have previously since the draft.  Just the connection of the media availability and the location.
Browns,3aunyg,miked1be,5,Wed Jun 24 19:52:32 2015 UTC,"Kind of a technicality really.  Our QB coach had quite a bit of contact with him but he wasn't with the team yet so ""the team"" didn't have contact with him."

Browns,3attp5,iAmA_scientist4,14,Tue Jun 23 13:32:46 2015 UTC,I had no idea his real name is Randy Johnson. Can we start calling him the little unit?
Browns,3attp5,MercilessMizzou,8,Tue Jun 23 15:28:49 2015 UTC,hahaha this is perfect
Browns,3attp5,Godszn,3,Tue Jun 23 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"I really like saying Duke though, kinda an old school name."
Browns,3attp5,PabstyLoudmouth,3,Tue Jun 23 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"He goes by 8Ball on twitter, which I love, and will be problematic if him and Johnny ever share the backfield together."

Browns,3attp5,Ihateloops,2,Wed Jun 24 06:45:45 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure there is a negative euphemism some where in there...
Browns,3attp5,Brokewood,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:23:12 2015 UTC,Haha I thought the exact same thing.
Browns,3attp5,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Tue Jun 23 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"I am not so sure about that. West and Crow are going to get all the carries, so unless they go down, he is not going to garner many points. Then again, I always run out of RB by the end of the season, so what do I know."
Browns,3attp5,Brokewood,2,Tue Jun 23 22:24:22 2015 UTC,"The key point is that it's a PPR league, where getting receptions is just as, if not more important, than standard carries. So if Johnson is going to be a darren sproles like back for us, he could get a decent number of targets."
Browns,3attp5,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Wed Jun 24 00:25:21 2015 UTC,I don't see him getting more than 25 receptions this year at all. It is training camp mind you.
Browns,3attp5,Brokewood,2,Wed Jun 24 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but I think he's more of a late round sleeper pick..."
Browns,3attp5,PabstyLoudmouth,3,Wed Jun 24 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"Sure but if you have 15 picks, is this guy one of them? I have not seen a single snap to judge the guy at this level. There is no way I can say one way or the other."
Browns,3attp5,Brokewood,2,Wed Jun 24 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"Idk how many people you play with, but I'm regularly with 14-16 people in my drafts...  Pickings get really slim in the late rounds. It's where I take chances on rookies. Sometimes it pans out, (thank you Kelvin Benjamin!) sometimes it doesn't (way too many examples to count)."
Browns,3attp5,Ihateloops,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:46:43 2015 UTC,"If you're in a league with other Browns fans he'll probably get drafted. If not, you can wait and grab him off waivers later if he looks promising."
Browns,3augwo,elessarjd,18,Tue Jun 23 16:37:18 2015 UTC,"Shelton hasn't been with us long because he had been back in Washington finishing his graduation process. Though the few days he's had have been virtually all positive.  Erving has been taking reps at all the OL positions. And from all reports, seems to be catching on well at all of them and living up to the ""smart"" label of the OL group. He had a minor injury that kept him out of the end of minicamp.  Orchard has had mostly positive reports, but a minor injury kept him on the stationary bike at the end of minicamp.  Duke Johnson was the last rookie to get signed and got a late start to camp because of transportation issues. Everyone who sees him practice seems to love him and thinks he'll be a dynamic player catching the ball in space.  Xavier Cooper had DC O'Neil say he was an ""under the radar guy"" that O'Neil was ""thrilled"" with.  Campbell hasn't really had any major reports come out specifically on him, but everyone still assumes he's the heir to the (W)Hitner throne.  Mayle had a broken thumb (I think) coming into camp so he's been running routes and hasn't been allowed to catch with both hands. Though there have been no reports of him having poor route running, physical skills, or work ethic - just that he hasn't caught a ball yet.  Charles Gaines has been completely swallowed up by our CB depth. He's mentioned a few times, but when you're competing with Haden, T. Williams, Gilbert, K. Williams, Desir, and Nelson...it's probably hard to get into the spotlight. It should be noted that he's not just learning ""inside"" or ""outside"" CB, but is being cross-trained as both.  Malcolm Johnson has impressed people with his mix of size and speed. He's been an intriguing wrinkle for the offense to throw at the defense. So most reports are about how he may be used (he's been in the backfield, TE, and slot so far in camp).  Randall Telfer is in a cast for a foot injury he suffered his last season in college.   Hayes Pullard has had the cliche' ""he's doing well"" reports that Campbell and Gaines, have been getting. Nothing negative though. I suppose it's worth noting that he's talked to the media, seems competent, and seems hungry.   IEO is just doing a ton of interviews since he's rehabbing that knee injury of his.  Someone correct me if I missed something or messed something up, I just whipped this up on the way out the door.  Edit: added O'Neil's comments on Cooper.  Edit 2: I meant to say IEO was doing ""interviews"" not ""injuries"". He has enough of those."
Browns,3augwo,KevinMack25,4,Tue Jun 23 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for taking the time to type all that out.  I'm excited for training camp to start and see how these guys do there."
Browns,3augwo,AKlep,3,Tue Jun 23 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"O'Neil was raving about Cooper. He's definitely not in the ""just doing well"" category."
Browns,3augwo,KevinMack25,4,Tue Jun 23 21:20:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the correction. I'll throw that in there.

Browns,3arzlq,afallucco,23,Tue Jun 23 01:07:37 2015 UTC,I got down voted to oblivion last time I said it but I will say it again... You know reddit is full of porn right?
Browns,3arzlq,Norka19,6,Tue Jun 23 13:38:22 2015 UTC,"But those are not Browns themed boobs, the ladies are just showing the support for the team. In a way, they are like this subreddits Cheerleaders."

Browns,3arzlq,Dusty_Dionne,5,Tue Jun 23 07:17:21 2015 UTC,I'm going to hitch myself to you at the top- Boobs for Browns is more of a preseason/opening weekend thing when we're all still excited and hopeful. It helps bolster out collective charge to muni lot where all your wildest dreams can come true.
Browns,3arzlq,LosingMyEdge7,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:54:19 2015 UTC,Or...  Makes us win the subreddit growth contest.  But I like the sound of yours more.

Browns,3arzlq,dbauer0706,6,Tue Jun 23 01:52:15 2015 UTC,Totally disagree. Maybe someone should create a special subreddit for it to keep this one sfw. Either that or we'll need to make this subreddit nswf to cya incase of minors that are a part of this community
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,17,Tue Jun 23 01:15:21 2015 UTC,A lot of other subs have occasional NSFW content and they get along just fine labeling the individual post as NSFW so the thumbnail is then hidden.  The full NSFW subreddits are like that and have warnings because they set it so the thumbnails aren't hidden.
Browns,3arzlq,miked1be,-7,Tue Jun 23 03:40:10 2015 UTC,"I unsubbed last time because there was full on hardcore posts, not just nsfw ones.  And there was local pornstars posting.  Its one thing if its ""occassional nsfw"" and its another thing when members are posting hardcore pictures of themselves with their muffintopped overweight girlfriends.  And even if the mods eventually remove them, it isn't immediate, and the users don't mark them appropriately.  Why even bother when there are a ton of better places to see stuff like this?  Its just bad taste.  I don't go to the gaming subreddit to see pictures of their overweight girlfriends posting in zelda cut offs, why would anyone want to see chunky ladies in browns cut offs?"

Browns,3arzlq,TapedeckNinja,-8,Wed Jun 24 02:30:18 2015 UTC,TIL.. Still think it should be exiled to it's own subreddit and not stink up the place
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:01:51 2015 UTC,"It's basically the will of the users, if it gets upvoted enough (which it does), it means most people like that post. They are doing it for us, some people just show support in different ways. I did not downvote you and neither should anyone else."
Browns,3arzlq,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Tue Jun 23 22:07:57 2015 UTC,I don't mind the downvoted. I mean how dare I not think bfb is awesome.
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:14:51 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying, I do, but I disagree. And I think you have every right to your own opinion.

Browns,3arzlq,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Tue Jun 23 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"Just because something is ""upvoted"" doesn't mean it's good for the actual subreddit though. I mean I love me some Doctor Pepper but it's not good for my stomach or teeth...  Just feel maybe it could be done better and not flood the subreddit I know 2 of the top five all time post are bfb ..maybe like ive mentioned before have one post where people can add to it... Keeps things nice and tiddy looking and still gives the masses what they want  But i guess ill concede and abide by the agree to disagree mantra."
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,9,Tue Jun 23 22:27:14 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that's what NSFW tags are for.
Browns,3arzlq,Coniuratos,0,Tue Jun 23 02:03:17 2015 UTC,Subreddits like gonewild have a warning before hand.
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,8,Tue Jun 23 02:55:58 2015 UTC,Probably because they show thumbnails of NSFW posts. /r/browns doesn't.
Browns,3arzlq,Coniuratos,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:04:43 2015 UTC,Yes we do actually.  Here's a quick link to some of the top posts in this sub HERE  and you will see the NSFW posts that show the thumbnail.
Browns,3arzlq,bowhunter6274,5,Tue Jun 23 10:04:23 2015 UTC,"I'm just seeing the Snoo NSFW image in the thumbnails for them. What I mean is, on NSFW subs like gonewild, you get a preview of the actual image in the thumbnail."
Browns,3arzlq,Coniuratos,6,Tue Jun 23 12:43:01 2015 UTC,That's weird. The preview is definitely there for me. I wonder if I have some RES setting or something.
Browns,3arzlq,bowhunter6274,2,Tue Jun 23 13:56:06 2015 UTC,it's most likely due to RES
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,2,Wed Jun 24 12:38:23 2015 UTC,"What about a stickied mod post for it? Then again, posters would only get comment karma.  Not sure if that's really a driving factor of posting or not."
Browns,3arzlq,Garth_McKillian,4,Tue Jun 23 05:19:22 2015 UTC,That's a great idea too
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,2,Tue Jun 23 10:05:14 2015 UTC,I'm sure that minors now a days have never seen porn.
Browns,3arzlq,Fzero124,-1,Tue Jun 23 16:57:32 2015 UTC,No reason to contribute to the problem
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,5,Tue Jun 23 17:36:29 2015 UTC,Why does it even bother you that someone might see naked bodies?
Browns,3arzlq,Fzero124,-1,Tue Jun 23 18:00:28 2015 UTC,Because there is no real valid reason for those post in this Reddit. Plus I'd had for this Reddit to vet shut down because of something stupid
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:24:45 2015 UTC,"Under what possible circumstance could /r/browns get shut down when /r/gonewild, not to mention weird shit like /r/clopclop or /r/dragonsfuckingcars, exist?"

Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,2,Tue Jun 23 23:37:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  If Browns becomes a group of people that actively doxxs in order to post hate, then I would want it shut down.   Luckily, a naked body isn't going to cause us to turn into those people.   If it bothers you so, you're welcome not to look at it.  This is coming from someone that barely spends a second looking at those pics here."
Browns,3arzlq,Fzero124,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:28:59 2015 UTC,Also r/gonewild and other ones of its nature have a warning before entering which needs to be acknowledged before entering

I don't understand why you have such an objection against naked people?  It's likely that you look at it, your parents, and (assuming you have them), your children, look at naked bodies.  It's really not a big thing."
Browns,3arzlq,Fzero124,0,Wed Jun 24 06:08:49 2015 UTC,"it's not my only objections.. just one of the few.   my main objection is there's not real reason for it other than to inflate our numbers with subs who will only visit the site for the two week time frame every year. There's no discussion really being added (which is kind of the point of forums). And to top it off, asking for those type of post come off as desperate and slimy to me   A child should know, and understand, sex before the age of 14-17. Shielding them from the truth does nothing other than making some think it's not normal to have sex at that age.    feel free to send an underage person some nude images (not of yourself of course) and let an any of their authority figures in on that.. bet you could get charged with sending pornographic images to a minor..    the last time that you posted out of sports was two years ago. A child should know, and understand, sex before the age of 14-17.     this is simply untrue.. i comment in entertainment based subreddits all the time. Movies, TV, games, sports.. i run the gambit of genres. usually don't create post all that often."
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,0,Wed Jun 24 12:05:49 2015 UTC,"Did I say anything about sending pictures?  I said should know and understand sex.  What should come to mind is sex ed, which when I was a kid was taught in 7th and 9th grades.    I will admit that I was wrong about the last, and rude, but I was looking at another persons account and that person was a complete asshole from his/her comments."
Browns,3arzlq,Fzero124,4,Wed Jun 24 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't wanna see people's dipshit dogs in the Cavs subreddit either, it's not freaking /r/aww, but there they were.  All you gotta do is not click the link if you don't wanna see it.  Easy-peasy"
Browns,3arzlq,wickedshxt,0,Tue Jun 23 13:31:10 2015 UTC,There's a huge difference between dogs and somebody posted pictures of themselves or their girlfriends tits in a subreddit for no reason
Browns,3arzlq,hatmantc,7,Tue Jun 23 13:54:49 2015 UTC,"Not really.  At the end of the day, it's junk posted for no reason.  Don't like it? Don't click it.  Some people may want to click it, it's for those people."
Browns,3arzlq,wickedshxt,4,Tue Jun 23 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, just like the crappy memes, outdated jokes, spacebrowns, etc. all you have to do is hit ""hide post"" and you will never see it again."
Browns,3arzlq,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Tue Jun 23 17:38:07 2015 UTC,Exactly
Browns,3arzlq,wickedshxt,-2,Tue Jun 23 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"By your rationale, we should just start posting anything here. How about we start posting movie reviews? Maybe we can post our favorite recipes? Oh, I know, let's start posting pictures of castles. I like castles."
Browns,3arzlq,western78,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"Have you looked at this subreddit sometimes?  There's tons of garbage that doesn't belong, posts like ""this just in! BROWNS!""  That's really worthwhile.  At least ""Boobs for Browns"" attempts to accomplish something."
Browns,3arzlq,wickedshxt,3,Tue Jun 23 17:49:00 2015 UTC,Thank you! I hurt inside a little every time I see one of those stupid posts.
Browns,3arzlq,24rubikscube,0,Tue Jun 23 19:13:39 2015 UTC,"I usually downvote those posts as well. But there isn't a ""post dumb stuff for a month"" event during the Browns preseason. What is it that ""Boobs for Browns"" is supposed to be accomplishing? Artificially increasing our subscriber numbers to win some contest? Why would we want people subscribing to our sub purely for porn? I truly cannot understand how a football fan can be happy having their preseason news overridden by a bunch of crappy porn."
Browns,3arzlq,western78,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:56:02 2015 UTC,Artificially increasing our subscriber numbers to win some contest?    Yes.   Why would we want people subscribing to our sub purely for porn?    Because #Winning.
Browns,3arzlq,Brokewood,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:16:14 2015 UTC,By far the worst thing that goes on in this sub. It's happens at the time of year when there is actually news going on. I can remember coming here after a preseason game and having to scroll down to the next page to find the game discussion. It had been pushed off the page by a bunch of below average porn. I can't understand how anyone can find that acceptable on a football subreddit.
Browns,3arzlq,western78,3,Tue Jun 23 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"It drives page views and memberships during the contest. We want people to come into the Browns subreddit, whether it's to see Browns related content or for the boobs.  Browns fans are the best fans. And if some redditor or their wife/girlfriend/sister/mother/etc feels compelled to share their breasts to draw other redditors to our board then who am I to disagree?  But I can see why not being able to see actual Browns related content in frustrating. Thankfully, BftB only comes once a year."
Browns,3arzlq,BeDoubleYou,3,Tue Jun 23 18:50:31 2015 UTC,"We want people to come into the Browns subreddit   Why? If they aren't Browns fans and are only here for boobs, why would you want them here?   Thankfully, BftB only comes once a year.   Yeah, in the middle of preseason."
Browns,3arzlq,western78,3,Tue Jun 23 18:59:52 2015 UTC,"Why?   Because I'll be goddamned  if I let any subreddit get more subscribers during the contest than the Browns. Also, promoting people from other teams subreddits is a nice way to keep from ours from becoming too ""circle-jerky"". Being in an echochamber is great if you like ignorance, but it never hurts to get an outsiders  prospective regarding things that maybe we as fans overlook because we are attached to the team.   In the middle of the preseason.   Which is exactly when every other team's subreddit is advertising and doing everything they can to get other redditors to THEIR sub page. Nobody on r/browns set that timeline."
Browns,3arzlq,BeDoubleYou,2,Tue Jun 23 20:08:05 2015 UTC,"Being in an echochamber is great if you like ignorance, but it never hurts to get an outsiders prospective regarding things that maybe we as fans overlook because we are attached to the team.   I don't see anything wrong with a ""echochamber."" This is a fan subreddit. If you wanted an outsiders opinion, you could go to /r/nfl."
Browns,3arzlq,mtux96,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:21:43 2015 UTC,Have you been to r/nfl? That place is literally the definition of an echochamber. They wouldn't admit the Browns did something right if it hit them in the face. We shouldn't sink to their level.  R/nfl is the lowest common denominator of football talk. There's never any intelligent discussion or disagreement. Just everyone shouting over each other and forming downvote brigades.
Browns,3arzlq,BeDoubleYou,4,Tue Jun 23 20:53:30 2015 UTC,So in order to improve /r/Browns we advertise  with boobs to get more people from /r/NFL to come here.. that doesn't make much sense to me if you don't like the people there.
Browns,3arzlq,mtux96,-2,Tue Jun 23 20:56:09 2015 UTC,"Who said we're trying to appeal to people from r/nfl? I said we want to attract more redditors (in general) to our sub. That doesn't mean I only want to get people from r/nfl in here, how about people that don't know there's an exclusive Browns subreddit? What about people from other countries that don't feel attached to any given team?  The boobs just get people who wouldn't normally come to the subreddit here and then once they see the amount of passion people here have for the team, they respect it and stay longer than they may have otherwise."
Browns,3arzlq,BeDoubleYou,2,Tue Jun 23 23:04:16 2015 UTC,Because I'll be goddamned if I let any subreddit get more subscribers during the contest than the Browns.   That's my problem. I couldn't care less about some subscriber contest. I do care when I come for post-game discussion and have to sift through porn to get to it.
Browns,3arzlq,western78,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"I couldn't care less about some subscriber contest.   Well that's fine, but most of us do. If you don't like it, there's always the option to hide or downvote threads.  Also, clearly your definition of porn is a lot more loose than mine. Seeing some boobs is hardly what I would consider ""porn"". I'm not saying your point isn't valid, just that I'm not sure I would agree with the wording."
Browns,3arzlq,BeDoubleYou,2,Tue Jun 23 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.   Explain to me how a bunch of pictures of breasts, asses, and pussies (yes those got submitted too) are not pornography, based on the definition of the word."
Browns,3arzlq,western78,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:49:15 2015 UTC,"Cause I'm not using them for fap material, I'm admiring a set of boobs. Not everything that's explicit is sexual to me.  And as I explained the last time someone complained about vaginas being posted, most of us said that that particular post was in poor taste and that it was ""boobs for the Browns"" and not ""any body part you want for the Browns"".  Could it be regulated and moderated better, absolutely. But most people don't have a problem with it. I'm sorry that you can't enjoy a pair of boobs without it being a sexual thing."
Browns,3arzlq,BeDoubleYou,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:08:10 2015 UTC,"I can't believe you are actually arguing ""Boobs for Browns"" isn't sexual."
Browns,3arzlq,western78,0,Tue Jun 23 23:42:51 2015 UTC,"I don't find it sexual. Just cause somebody's topless/naked doesn't mean it has to be sexual. Maybe you just have a different upbringing or culture. Being naked (or nearly so) is pretty normal where I'm from. Especially in the summer. I can enjoy boobs without it being about sex, much like I can look at a sculpture of a naked man without being aroused. Sometimes the human body is a beautiful thing."
Browns,3arzlq,BeDoubleYou,0,Tue Jun 23 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"You're exaggerating how much is actually posted. It's not difficult to scroll past a couple of B4B posts to find the postgame thread, which at any rate usually gets pinned to the top after getting posted."
Browns,3arzlq,Coniuratos,2,Tue Jun 23 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not. At the height of ""Boobs for Browns"" the front page was almost completely boobs. It was far more than a couple."
Browns,3arzlq,western78,2,Tue Jun 23 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"Over the course of the entire contest, sure. At any given time, there's only ever a few at the top."
Browns,3arzlq,Coniuratos,2,Tue Jun 23 20:25:41 2015 UTC,No. You're wrong. I clearly remember the front page being dominated by porn for at least a couple of days.
Browns,3arzlq,western78,6,Tue Jun 23 20:28:56 2015 UTC,"There were 25 boob posts last year, and if it dominated the sub for 2 days, meh. That is 2 days out of 365, and honestly it's nice to see us do some things different. We are not just about football, we do the fantasy leagues, beer swaps, the subreddit growth contest (won 3 years in a row), contests, and we do that because we care. Sometimes it sucks being a Browns fan, we have been shitty since we came back, and it's nice to interact with people in other ways than simply talking about football. We are a community, not just a sports page."
Browns,3arzlq,PabstyLoudmouth,-2,Tue Jun 23 22:05:30 2015 UTC,You're complaining about boobs. BROWNS boobs.  Are you a troll from the 49ers forum or what?
Browns,3arzlq,NoMagic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:20:45 2015 UTC,I'm complaining about how off-topic the sub got last preseason.
Browns,3arzlq,western78,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:54:27 2015 UTC,well let's have it confined to a stickey then

Browns,3arzlq,BigFatDynamo,4,Wed Jun 24 02:32:34 2015 UTC,I must be crazy for thinking pornography has no place on a football team's subreddit.
Browns,3arzlq,western78,0,Wed Jun 24 02:38:01 2015 UTC,Agreed.

Browns,3aqzrq,iFeastOnTacos,57,Mon Jun 22 20:19:42 2015 UTC,"He'll probably end up being cut, but I applaud the front office for trying an experiment.  Pryor has great athleticism."
Browns,3aqzrq,NolaBrownsFan,25,Mon Jun 22 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"I agree.  There's no real reason to dislike this unless he ends up taking a roster spot and absolutely sucking.  I've always heard that QBs tend to have good hands because of all the catching they do while warming up and, as you said, he's certainly got the athleticism.  Be cool if it worked out since we didn't have to lose anything to grab him."
Browns,3aqzrq,miked1be,15,Mon Jun 22 20:29:24 2015 UTC,I like the possibility of trick plays as well.

Browns,3aqzrq,DREWBICE,9,Mon Jun 22 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, let me rephrase that, a strong arm."
Browns,3aqzrq,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Mon Jun 22 23:09:35 2015 UTC,A really strong arm if I'm remembering OSU games properly.
Browns,3aqzrq,Daviroth,2,Tue Jun 23 11:49:02 2015 UTC,"Julian Edelman. Need I say more? At the very least he'll push a few players in camp, but there's a real possibility that he contributes athletically and on special teams. Think of how good of a PR he could be?"
Browns,3aqzrq,StraightDegan,3,Tue Jun 23 04:41:30 2015 UTC,If you're going to bring up a Kent State QB that excelled at a different position you can't leave Cribbs out of the conversation.  I'm not sure someone Pryor's size would do all that well in the return game though.
Browns,3aqzrq,miked1be,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:07:14 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he was all-state in basketball. That's good hands!!

Browns,3aqzrq,Spyce,21,Mon Jun 22 23:05:25 2015 UTC,He spent more time hitting an open pair of legs than hitting the books at OSU.

Browns,3aqzrq,barneythecarni,15,Mon Jun 22 21:11:11 2015 UTC,I've been saying for years he needed to switch to receiver. 6'4 and runs a 4.38
Browns,3aqzrq,Dustin65,12,Mon Jun 22 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"Let's see him run some routes, get in and out of breaks, and get off the line first but yeah...he should have made the switch sooner."
Browns,3aqzrq,Carpetron,2,Mon Jun 22 21:11:49 2015 UTC,"He did do plenty of running when he was a QB, and didn't look too bad at it. Now, the real questuin is can he catch something in stride.  I do believe there were some trick plays where he caught some touchdown passes while at OSU, it'd be interesting to dig up some footage."

Browns,3aqzrq,sonicmerlin,3,Wed Jun 24 00:24:36 2015 UTC,"TE routes usually move through space allowing timing/size to get them open on the route (seam, fade, drag, flats..etc)  Pryor would be a nightmare for Lbs on drag routes  WR routes involve more cutting and setup to create seperation (double move go, post corner, button hook, slant...etc)"
Browns,3aqzrq,Abiv23,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:39:19 2015 UTC,Oh ok thanks
Browns,3aqzrq,sonicmerlin,8,Thu Jun 25 00:02:00 2015 UTC,Browns scrimmage at The Shoe part of me thinks it's to draw a few more people locally but then also keeping in mind TP's relationship with tOSU didn't necessarily end on the best of terms.  Hope he finds a home. Can't see him making final 53 as a WR or QB.
Browns,3aqzrq,rubbsreddit,9,Mon Jun 22 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"we don't have much size at WR and we've been complaining about the talent. We'll see if he can do anything, and if he can't then there's really no loss."

Browns,3aqzrq,RedChocobo2,2,Tue Jun 23 00:51:48 2015 UTC,The first four are likely locks. I'd imagine two more make the team. I wouldn't be surprised if Benjamin doesn't make it.

He isn't that great of a WR and he apparently lost the ability to return the ball which is the only reason he was on the team. Benjamin is gone, he contributes next to nothing. They will replace him on the depth chart with a massive sized WR and let Duke return."

He has definitely proven he's not an NFL QB, but at 26 years old, 6'4, 235, and able to run a sub 4.4 40, he's not a waste of a roster spot."

Browns,3aqzrq,IamMcSqueeb,7,Mon Jun 22 21:06:42 2015 UTC,Didn't really mean it was one of the other. Just including a couple different ideas in one post.  1) I never got the TP hate. 2) he's worthy of a shot at WR
Browns,3aqzrq,rackemrackem,3,Mon Jun 22 21:36:20 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok. Makes more sense. The hate from me and my friends was his just all around terrible character. He was a dick to every person he met in public. He was a sleezeball who used his notoriety to try to sleep with girls and get free things. Just not a guy that you want representing the school you go to in the public eye. He was good at football and he knew it and didn't seem to be humble about it. Similar to Johnny, and you can see all the hate for him.   Now I'm sure he might have matured now seeing as he isn't the best of the best anymore (like Johnny) but I'm not one to forget things like that. But I'm with you, I like this move and hope it turns out well. He has some pretty amazing athletic ability."
Browns,3aqzrq,IamMcSqueeb,6,Mon Jun 22 21:50:33 2015 UTC,He was a sleezeball who used his notoriety to try to sleep with girls and get free things.   You've pretty much described 99% of elite college football players.  I was at OSU in the 90's and this behavior was rampant.

Browns,3aqzrq,giannini1222,3,Mon Jun 22 22:05:06 2015 UTC,That's simply not true. Just graduated and still live in Columbus.  Most that disliked him have gotten over it.  He's matured greatly in the last few years and it's evident when you read what his NFL coaches have said about him. He'll be remembered in a positive light the same way Clarett is now.

Browns,3aqzrq,Marzman315,2,Mon Jun 22 20:27:00 2015 UTC,Well maybe he can make it as a TE if he can handle the blocking assignments.  Long way to go before the final cut though and he is going to have to work hard to make the team at WR or TE.
Browns,3aqzrq,theduke282,7,Mon Jun 22 20:23:01 2015 UTC,He's too lanky to play TE. Unless he gain a bunch of weight during the off-season.

Browns,3aqzrq,DeLuca2400,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:50:22 2015 UTC,There's no way he'll be a blocking TE.  He hates contact and is why he was so hesitant to switch from QB for so long.

Browns,3ar2ff,ratcw73,26,Mon Jun 22 20:38:50 2015 UTC,"Well I think the important thing is wether or not he can catch. You can have all the athleticism in the world but if you have lousy hands you won't be a good receiver (see Little, Greg)"
Browns,3ar2ff,Marzman315,10,Mon Jun 22 20:43:28 2015 UTC,It's pretty crazy how big some of these guys are with monster hands that go half way around the football but can't catch it. Maybe TP will be this years Denard Robinson and just kill it at a non-QB position.
Browns,3ar2ff,average_white_male,2,Mon Jun 22 21:08:37 2015 UTC,"Denard would kill it longer if he wasn't a 197lb 6' running back. He's a small dude, hard for him to play RB at that weight and stay healthy is hard."
Browns,3ar2ff,bearsdriving,7,Tue Jun 23 15:33:15 2015 UTC,Or run routes. Or read the defensive back standing across from you. Hopefully he can do all those things.
Browns,3ar2ff,Ihateloops,6,Mon Jun 22 21:24:40 2015 UTC,"Or read the defensive back standing across from you   Agree on the first point, but disagree on this one. He read the defensive backs every play. He shoud have a good diea what he is up against each play."
Browns,3ar2ff,bowhunter6274,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:00:40 2015 UTC,"Reading the d back as a receiver is different than reading them as a quarterback.  Also, seeing as he hasn't managed to stick as a quarterback and is now trying out as a wide receiver, he clearly wasn't really a great quarterback. He may have never quite figured out reading defenses that well."
Browns,3ar2ff,Ihateloops,6,Mon Jun 22 22:20:58 2015 UTC,"I fail to see how it is different. As a QB, he read coverages pre-snap and what the receivers were up against. Just because he didn't make it as a QB in the NFL doesn't necessarily mean he can't read defensive coverage."
Browns,3ar2ff,bowhunter6274,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:46:07 2015 UTC,Because as a QB he didn't have to worry about trying to break a press or catch someone in a backpedal or knowing their tells on whether they were playing bump or faking it.
Browns,3ar2ff,Ihateloops,11,Tue Jun 23 22:53:52 2015 UTC,I'd be more impressed if he wasn't blowing by 93yo Troy Polamalu.

Browns,3avyvu,Marzman315,8,Wed Jun 24 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"Oh come on!  The Browns are not the kind of team that can be leaving stones un-turned.  And even then, ask the Patriots about bringing in random guys on a flier to see if something clicks, which they seem to do every offseason.  Pettine has maintained since day 1 that competition is the core of his philosophy.  Sure it's a waste of time to bring in random guys to compete with Joe Thomas, but in a group that we're building, it absolutely makes sense.  You could just as legitimately interpret things as the staff liking where they are with Bowe and Hartline, recognizing that those guys are getting older (so even if they're great this year, a less bright immediate future looms), and hoping to uncover a guy who can maximize his potential under their guidance."
Browns,3avyvu,zeek0us,2,Wed Jun 24 02:32:29 2015 UTC,"Plus, this move gets the fans hyped up, and the team could use a little bit of excitement and goodwill.  It seems like a no-brainer."

Browns,3avyvu,Illinois_Jones,2,Wed Jun 24 11:44:07 2015 UTC,"Uh, i think we arguably have the worst receiving core in the game. I would be surprised if we don't claim any WRs dropped in preseason too.  Signing a guy with Megatron size and more speed isn't a bad thing. Athletes like Prior don't become available outside the draft very often, he is raw, but we are maybe the only team that he could land on the final 53."
Browns,3avyvu,bearsdriving,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"Our worst position groups are QB, WR and TE.  Until those are filled with promising, young talent we will continue to sign the transient on-the-cusp players at those positions in high volume every year.  Gabriel is the only promising young WR on the roster right now.  He's the only WR whom I expect will more than likely be re-signed when his contract expires (Hawkins has 3 more years, will be 32, a lot can change).  We had the fewest passing touchdowns last year.  We were 20th in yards.  We will not be a passing team this year.  We will sign serviceable veterans and project UDFAs indefinitely until we find a quarterback who can throw for over 4,000 YDs and 20 TDs, or otherwise proves they deserve a high volume of plays.  Until then we can afford to be patient and scrupulous.  The QB is the limiting factor."

Browns,3aslwe,miked1be,2,Thu Jun 25 00:30:28 2015 UTC,I think you're delusional if you think he can compete with these other guys.  Short skinny WR who fumble punts multiple times in a row don't stick on NFL rosters.
Browns,3aslwe,PrimeTimeHoyer,0,Tue Jun 23 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"He lead the WRs with 3, none of them had a lot and 3 TDs isn't exactly lighting the world on fire.  He certainly wasn't horrible but thinking someone is delusional that he doesn't make the roster is a bit extreme."
Browns,3aslwe,miked1be,0,Tue Jun 23 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"I only heard him mention guys that are right now starters on the roster that were out.  Mack and Benjamin were both starters and both were out, that's it.  He's talking about installing the offense and you have 2nd and 3rd round guys playing up higher than they normally would this early and it's hurt some of the continuity.  Not once did I hear him say Benjamin was a top WR on the team, just that he's a starter right now."
Browns,3aslwe,miked1be,0,Wed Jun 24 01:22:31 2015 UTC,"And while we've added Bowe and Hartline who will almost definitely be starters we've also added Mayle and Pryor who are a rookie and a first year WR that could overtake him.  Sure he's a starter now, early in preseason, but that doesn't mean that can't change."
Browns,3aslwe,miked1be,0,Wed Jun 24 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"All my initial reply to you said was that he didn't exactly light the world on fire last season so calling someone delusional if they think he could be cut was a bit extreme IMO.  You have yet to provide anything against what I'm saying aside from a video where the OC calls him a starter right now, early in the off season."
Browns,3aslwe,miked1be,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:55:02 2015 UTC,I think him or one of the other vets we brought in could become the surprise cuts of this off season. But Pettine has said he'll keep the 52 best players even if that means having 5 or 6 WR's or DB's. I think being a Special Teams ace will be the major difference maker for the last 6 or 8 guys on the roster.
Browns,3aslwe,PrimeTimeHoyer,2,Wed Jun 24 19:11:59 2015 UTC,"Bowe - Hartline - Gabriel - Hawkins - Pryor - Mayle  Bold but I think Benji gets cut and Pryor makes some plays in camp and preseason to earn the last spot.  He can be tried at KR too, so Benji and his fumbles are on the way out."

Browns,3aqm8r,TSR3K,3,Mon Jun 22 20:18:02 2015 UTC,Isn't the franchise for a safety over 10 million this year?  And probably higher the next year.
Browns,3aqm8r,Brokewood,4,Mon Jun 22 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"$9.53 million.  up from $8.65 in 2014, so I imagine it will be over $10 in 2016. But the cap itself will rise as well, so it's meh. We literally have to spend the money at some point."
Browns,3aqm8r,LobotomistCircu,3,Mon Jun 22 22:16:02 2015 UTC,"I'm no football contract wizard, but couldn't we just frontload a contract and have it not be that big of a gamble?  We do have the space right now to pay him what he wants, it's the years to come where that becomes risky."
Browns,3aqm8r,Brokewood,4,Mon Jun 22 23:55:55 2015 UTC,"If we pay him big upfront; the flip side of the coin is what motivation is there for Gip to continue to do well? And if we paid him big now, after his knee injury, and he never recovers... Why did we just waste that money that could be used to extend other players? Bademosi, Barnidge, Benjamin are all FAs in 2016. Crowell, Bowie, Bryant, Dray, Hartline, Poyer and Starks are all FAs in 2017.  I get it, the honorable thing is to pay the man for services rendered. But the NFL is a cold, hard place. The cliché question is more of ""how can you help me now and in the future?"" not ""what have you done for me in the past?""  I have faith in Farmer's ability to find talent, I have faith in his and Morocco Brown's ability to manage the cap."
Browns,3aqm8r,Nightcinder,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:09:47 2015 UTC,That's still a gamble.
Browns,3aqm8r,LobotomistCircu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, but a seemingly high reward/low risk one."
Browns,3aqm8r,Nightcinder,2,Tue Jun 23 02:26:47 2015 UTC,pay him lots of money up front in hopes he recreates last season after a bad knee injury?
Browns,3aqm8r,LobotomistCircu,2,Tue Jun 23 02:42:11 2015 UTC,It's unused cap space.  It's not like saving it helps the team if it goes unused this year
Browns,3aqm8r,miked1be,2,Tue Jun 23 02:44:55 2015 UTC,Cap carryover is actually a thing.
Browns,3aqm8r,JohnnyFire,9,Tue Jun 23 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"It doesn't rule out Cleveland at this point, but I hope he plays so well that Cleveland has to throw some $$$ at him."
Browns,3aqm8r,klax04,6,Mon Jun 22 19:44:56 2015 UTC,"If he has a great year, again, and hits the open market then we are going to have to overpay to keep him. If it comes down to that then we had better do it, because right now this is on the FO not on Gipson."
Browns,3aqm8r,TopHatAbobo,3,Mon Jun 22 20:20:18 2015 UTC,"If he has a great year, again, and hits the open market then we are going to have to overpay to keep him.   Do you mean just the Browns specifically would have to ""overpay"", or that anyone who acquires him at that point would be ""overpaying""?    Honestly, there's no such thing as overpaying unless you yourself are paying over your own guidelines.  Gipson said the contract negotiations were close before he opted to sign his tender.  Had the Browns agreed to his terms, they'd be overpaying according to their own standards."
Browns,3aqm8r,klax04,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:46:53 2015 UTC,"Overpay as in we will have to pay more than any offer by a large percentage. For example the Texans offer him 7.5mm a year and the Browns offer 8mm, he would say no to the Browns since he would rather go else where and take a small pay cut. Browns would then have to offer more, like say 8.5 or 9 to keep him and that would make him the highest paid safety when he is not the best.   Instead of rolling the dice and locking in a player of his caliber early the FO chose to roll the dice on him signing next year. Yes the injury plays a huge part of it, but if he returns to form we now have to compete in a bidding war to keep him. We could easily end up overpaying him to stay, or just outright losing him."
Browns,3aqm8r,TopHatAbobo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"For example the Texans offer him 7.5mm a year and the Browns offer 8mm, he would say no to the Browns since he would rather go else where and take a small pay cut.   Why would he want to go to the Texans in this situation?  I'm a little confused on why he would take less money."
Browns,3aqm8r,klax04,2,Mon Jun 22 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"I just used the Texans as a fill in, but feel free to use any team better than the Browns- which is pretty much every team. Texas also has no tax so that helps.   Either way, if he does not want to play here anymore or has no trust in the FO he will leave and take less to do so. Many players have done so in the past from every team, so it is nothing new. He wanted to be here and the FO did not show much interest in keeping him around. Most of the stuff coming from him so far is that he feels disrespected and unwanted."
Browns,3aqm8r,TopHatAbobo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:42:22 2015 UTC,"So, in your scenario, the FO showed that they are untrustworthy, didn't want him, and disrespected him by not giving him the contract in the amount he's looking for, so he'll sign with a team that apparently is even less trustworthy, wants him even less, and has less respect for him since they would be offering EVEN LESS money?  If your job didn't offer you the raise you were after, you were able to find a better offer some time later at another employer, you brought this amount to your current employer's attention and they not only MATCHED but offered MORE money, you would turn them down?  That's basically what you're saying he would do.   Many players have done so in the past from every team, so it is nothing new.    How many were in the same situation as Gipson?  Players get tagged by teams and end up signing long term contracts with the team, even after ""feel[ing] disrespected"".  Many players have done so in the past from every team, so this is also nothing new.     Most of the stuff coming from him so far is that he feels disrespected and unwanted.   Contract talk / negotiation (the primary function of media to players / teams).  He also said he wanted to play for the Browns for the rest of his career, and that he loves his coaches and teammates.    Actions speak louder than words, we'll see what he does.  He signed his tender for this year, if he rebounds successfully there are many ways in which the Browns could try and retain him, now is not their only opportunity."
Browns,3aqm8r,subhuman1,-1,Tue Jun 23 11:45:06 2015 UTC,"""great year, again"".  He has never had a 16 game ""great year""....please stop with the homer-ism."
Browns,3aqm8r,klax04,5,Mon Jun 22 21:13:13 2015 UTC,"He played 16 games in 13/14 season. 5 picks, 95 tackles, and 16 passes defended. That is a great year for a FS. Last year he had a great year untill he got injured in game 11.   So you think he is average or below average or something?"
Browns,3aqm8r,subhuman1,0,Mon Jun 22 21:27:54 2015 UTC,"Thats a good to very good year.  ""Great"" year implies pro bowler, top 5 type of talent. For his career? Slightly above average with one full season under his belt. Total knee explosion lat year, hasn't been on the field since....yeah....let's break the bank on him...."
Browns,3aqm8r,klax04,3,Mon Jun 22 22:59:03 2015 UTC,"Pro Bowler last year. Has played 3 years, so rookie season not on the field much and then 2 very good seasons.   You don't have to break the bank on him, just give him 6-7mm a year for like 3 years. We have the cap space, and if he returns to form it is a steal, if not then it is a waste of a couple of million we would not have used anyways."
Browns,3aqm8r,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"I actually agree, two years ago he was brick-hands on easy INTs and even lost a few games on deep misplayed passes.  He had a decent year and then half a great year.  I wanted him replaced before he improved, and I wouldn't be heartbroken if he decides to play tough and go elsewhere after basically proving jack shit."
Browns,3aqm8r,Deadleggg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:52:58 2015 UTC,I think it does. It's about respect from his point of view.

Browns,3aqm8r,OrnetteOrnette,0,Mon Jun 22 18:52:24 2015 UTC,"I wonder if we should just trade him right now then. Could maybe get a third rounder for him (given that wherever he goes, his future is uncertain). I wonder if Gilbert or Williams could play safety while the other is corner #2."

Browns,3aqm8r,OrnetteOrnette,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"Well even if we don't trade him we should see if any of our other young DBs can play there this year. We let our young pro bowl safety tj ward walk and then found a competent replacement in FA, worked out reasonably well."
Browns,3aqm8r,SANDFIGHT,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:43:31 2015 UTC,FO is big on Jordan Poyer so hopefully he can work out
Browns,3aqm8r,subhuman1,0,Mon Jun 22 20:39:56 2015 UTC,No one is giving up a 3 for someone who jacked up his knee this way and hasn't seen the field since. MAYBE a 6-7 that is a conditional 3 if he makes the pro bowl or something like that.
Browns,3aqm8r,OrnetteOrnette,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:11:49 2015 UTC,"Well we've got until the trade deadline so there is the option of showing him on the field, then dealing him. I think teams would be more wary because of his pending free agency than anything else. The team who'd be interested in him would need to feel like he could help them win a championship this season and then probably be open to the idea of parting ways with him after."

Browns,3aptuv,fuckingbrowns,14,Tue Jun 23 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"There is no convincing me that McCown is a quality quarterback. He is a free agent bandaid put on our broken arm of a QB position. He is a waste of time compared to the rest of the team, which is great. The only reason these articles work is because everybody expects the worst, and any extra that he gives us is a bonus/boost.

Browns,3aptuv,DJ_GiantMidget,7,Tue Jun 23 10:29:14 2015 UTC,"IMO our team right now is on par, if not better, than the bears he played on a couple years ago. The reason everyone thinks hes shitty is because hes been put in shit situations 90% of the time. Comparing the bucs to us this year is like comparing your uncles old stationwagon to a mustang. The only bad thing about him really is his age. If he does well i see 3 years max here. Maybe by then johhny will have outshined him?"
Browns,3aptuv,StalinOut,9,Mon Jun 22 19:36:22 2015 UTC,"He was throwing to Marshall, Jeffery and Bennet. He was also handing the ball off to Matt Forte."
Browns,3aptuv,Putuinurplace,7,Mon Jun 22 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he also wasn't making bad decisions and turning the ball over which, if you will recall, is what kept us in games last year."
Browns,3aptuv,gakule,3,Mon Jun 22 17:36:03 2015 UTC,"And what kept us out of games is the QB's having an abysmal completion percentage, something McCown is not going to improve on for us this year."
Browns,3aptuv,average_white_male,6,Mon Jun 22 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"Well, even with the shit o line Tampa had he had a better completion % than Hoyer. Year before with a much better o line and worse o line than what we had, he was at 66.5%... so yeah, he actually might bub."
Browns,3aptuv,gakule,3,Mon Jun 22 19:04:01 2015 UTC,He also had mike Evans to throw to. The Chicago year was an enigma and his career numbers are a large enough sample size that you know what you're gonna get outta this guy and it's average at best.
Browns,3aptuv,Rectalcactus,2,Mon Jun 22 19:28:01 2015 UTC,"He had a 56% completion in Tampa vs. 55% for Hoyer last year...not really a big upgrade. He had a 66% completion in Chicago, correct, throwing to Marshall and Jeffery and Forte (who catches 100 passes a year which bolsters completion %). So I really don't see why you think he is an upgrade in any form form."
Browns,3aptuv,average_white_male,2,Mon Jun 22 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"You said he's not going to improve, when he has an opportunity to do so. I'm not saying he's our savior by any means, but he's not as bad as Tampa and probably not as good as Chicago. Somewhere in the middle is still an upgrade."
Browns,3aptuv,gakule,3,Mon Jun 22 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"I said he wouldn't improve our completion percentage at the QB spot, which I still don't think he will. I really see him as Hoyer 2.0, he will keep us in some games but never win us the games."
Browns,3aptuv,average_white_male,2,Mon Jun 22 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're wrong, I just hope I'm right that he falls in the middle of his Chicago - Tampa stats. As long as he doesn't lose us games, we should be in a good spot until we can get Russel Wilson"
Browns,3aptuv,gakule,0,Mon Jun 22 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"Did he though? He completed only 56 percent t of his passes and he threw more interceptions than touchdowns. 14 in 11 games. They were the worst team in the league because of their offense specifically. Granted we do have a much better offensive line than Tampa but they had better receivers. That is also irrelevant since my original comment was in response to saying our roster is on par with that Bears team. While we may have advantages in certain areas, they had four probowl level skill players on that offense, and as far as we know we have none currently. Thus I think it is a bit ambitious to label our offense to be on par with the Beats team where McCown had success."
Browns,3aptuv,Putuinurplace,3,Mon Jun 22 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"In Tampa he was behind a horrendous o-line with a non-existent running game. He struggled despite good receivers. I'm more of the mind that we throw Manziel into the fire with a kind of ""fuck it"" attitude, but it's not unthinkable that McCown could do reasonably well behind arguably the second best pass blocking line in the league while using our run game as a crutch."
Browns,3aptuv,Marzman315,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"The comment I was replying to was talking about the Bears, why would I be talking about Tampa? Measuring him with Tampa is unfair, that team was a god damned mess. No QB would look good behind that line.  With the Bears he had 66.5% completion, and 13 tds to 1 int, with a rating of 109. We have a lot better o line than the bears, a good backfield thay could be as good or better than the Bears (not saying it will be, but we've got a stuffed backfield. We LEAD the league in rushing stats before Mack going down, didn't we?), a good group of WR that people are hella sleeping on, and a much better defense.  I'm not saying we'll see the same player as we saw with the Bears, but that's okay we just need him to sustain drives and not turn the ball over. Our defense will keep us in games enough to let our ground game wear the other team down and open up some deep passes regardless of who is our QB."
Browns,3aptuv,gakule,2,Mon Jun 22 20:25:38 2015 UTC,Our wide receivers may be underrated but they are not nearly to the level the bears were that year. It's not even close. McCown might not be terrible but if you look over his career numbers it's pretty easy to see what year was an enigma and that he is an average to below average journeyman who isn't gonna improve to that degree in the last stages of his career.
Browns,3aptuv,Rectalcactus,2,Mon Jun 22 19:02:57 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, he's not going to light up the league, but when did he really play on a stacked team at any point? Bears might be an outlier for him, but even if we can get something between Tampa performance and bears performance, that's still a pretty solid QB performance."

If he can make the roster (and he won't unless he deserves it) the majority of Buckeye fans will be happy for him.  I've been going to Buckeye games my entire life and I just graduated last December...most Buckeyes like him.  It's evident he has matured greatly if you read anything his NFL coaches have said about him.  Also, Tressel getting caught lying to the NCAA was worse than a small tattoo violation (and pretty much everyone has forgiven him too).  The cover up was worse than the crime.  Clarett changed his ways and is loved by Buckeye fans after doing way worse things than selling his personal possessions for some tattoos.   He never dragged the school/team down with him when they handed him a ridiculous 5 year ban and has done nothing but bust his ass according to all of his recent coaches.  Forgive and remember the good times and stop acting like he's Aaron Hernandez.  Go Bucks and Go Browns.  I hope he can learn the position, he could end up being a real weapon.  Making the roster this year will be a tall task but after a year of training I wouldn't be surprised.  He's still only 26 and has fresh legs."

Browns,3apvsa,JohnnyFire,5,Mon Jun 22 15:20:18 2015 UTC,"Every ounce of me wants to agree with this analysis, and I hope to god it's true that we're finally building something and not rebuilding starting from scratch. In fact, I'll take this as a given for now, because I'm a fan and I want it to be so.  Of course, in the back of my mind, I know it's too early to make declarations like this. A little real talk: we're going into year two of the Pettine era, which has already been marked by coaching changes, namely the departure of Shanahan, Loggains and others.  With so much change in schemes going on, it's hard to come down and say we're already building a team according to a long-term vision to develop offensive and defensive schemes and find guys who fit them perfectly. Roster-wise, there has been a lot of turnover, which in itself is evidence of rebuilding, not building. Many of you will disagree with me, but I look at Skrine leaving as another sign that underlines why we might not be building yet. A couple years ago, Skrine was utter garbage, but we stuck with him and let him make his mistakes. He got better – not elite, far from elite – but better. And then, despite having more cap space than Nelly at the VMAs, we let him go. Buster Skrine is what ""building"" means. ""Building"" doesn't mean finding value in the draft, training them up until they become half-decent and letting them walk. Now, there may be factors I'm not aware of in this particular deal, and I'm not going to claim to have any inside info, but I nevertheless think this is bad to see.  And here's the other thing. We can't use this year's draft as evidence that we're ""building"" for the first time in a long time. These guys are prospects. They haven't panned out. Duke might look great in breeze shorts in minicamp, but he hasn't played a down yet. Neither has Shelton, Erving, Orchard or any of the other guys we drafted. These guys are young and raw and we'll need some time to find out whether we actually ""built"" through the draft or set ourselves up for another ""rebuilding.""  And hence it's too early to ask the question about what the next piece is. If everything pans out and we did end up building through the draft this year, then we'll maybe be in the playoffs and have a new set of priorities next year. If McCown pulls miracles out of his ass, we might be thinking about which WR is the cherry on our offensive sundae next year, not who the QBOTF is. If things don't go swimmingly – let's face it, a real possibility – we will be high up in the draft order and thinking QB, and it'll very much be back to ""rebuilding.""  I want to be with you on this. The preseason of year two of a new regime is far too early to make this kind of analysis."
Browns,3apvsa,batardo,2,Mon Jun 22 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"And hey, that's fair. It is early. Never too early to extrapolate facts tho~!  I'd say on your last point though, having a high draft pick to get a QB might not be the worst thing at this stage of the game; yes, getting a QB is the most important thing, but you can't get that QB until you...you know, get that QB. So there's a lot of factors in play in the long term, and who knows? Maybe we go 6-10, but our defense doesn't let a single team go over 20 points and the issue is clear (that Manziel/McCown can't score points). Doesn't that skew the perspective a bit?  But you are right in that sense; it will be more sensible to talk about this after we see them go on the field."
Browns,3apvsa,vosbekka,0,Mon Jun 22 19:09:59 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, then we're sitting 6-10, and the ""surefire"" good QBs will be well beyond our reach in the draft.  We can try and get lucky, but us picking the 3rd or 4th best QB in a draft doesn't fill me with a ton of confidence, considering their previous choices were Manziel / Shaw / McCown, which all would have not worked out if this was true."
Browns,3apvsa,ArcaneNine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"We got a DT to help with run defense, which is arguably the largest reason we lost games last year outside of QB. I was mad about the signing of Josh McCown since I thought Shaun Hill was the same player but tons cheaper. But apart from that I've been either passively or actively onboard with all the FA signings so far.  Ultimately though, it mostly comes down to coaching and lack of injuries. The better teams in the league don't necessarily have much better rosters than us. They just find a way to connect on timely drives, stop their opponents when they need to, and win games."
Browns,3apvsa,miked1be,0,Mon Jun 22 16:31:37 2015 UTC,I thought Shaun Hill was the same player but tons cheaper.   With the cap space we have I think the FO was looking more at the possibility of picking up McCown over a guy like Hill because it gave us a compensatory pick since he was cut instead of being an end of contract free agent.  I don't think that was the only reason of course but I'm sure it was part of the motivation for picking up McCown.
Browns,3apvsa,ArcaneNine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:54:01 2015 UTC,Interesting. What's the reasoning behind the multi-year contract then? You would think that we might like to move on from him as soon as possible if the compensatory pick was a significant motivation.
Browns,3apvsa,admiralkit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:22:51 2015 UTC,"My brain isn't at 100% today, so apologies if I misread something in the posts going on.  McCown's contract, IIRC, is only guaranteed $1M if we cut him this off season.  Also, the advantage of having McCown under a multi-year contract is that if we move on from Manziel we still have the elder veteran on staff to train the new QB we would inevitability draft in 2016."
Browns,3apvsa,ArcaneNine,3,Mon Jun 22 17:32:52 2015 UTC,I think he would count $3 million against the cap in that situation though. And I'm not sold on a career backup being the best mentor for a 2016 starter.
Browns,3apvsa,admiralkit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"The great news is that with all of our cap space, if we do decide to move on from McCown because we've found a better option for mentor that it's really not going to take a lot of work in the front office to make it happen.  I like that McCown was specifically brought in with mentorship in mind because it means the front office isn't sitting by idly as the coaches try to get their QB prospect trained up.  I wonder if they have some sort of reasoning for that instead of having a couple of developmental guys on the roster simultaneously and seeing if any of them can develop into a competent starter - seems like with as hard as it is to hit it right that more shots would mean more results.  Then again, I'm also not in charge of part of an NFL team, so they probably know something I don't."
Browns,3apvsa,miked1be,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but I think it's just security. The multi-year gives us a safety net and allows us to not be looking for some magical answer at back-up for either Manziel or otherwise."
Browns,3apvsa,miked1be,0,Mon Jun 22 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"As mentioned already it gives us a bit of a safety net if we can't get a better option next season.  Also, it may have been something that helped lure him away from Buffalo as opposed to a less player friendly 1 year deal."
Browns,3apvsa,miked1be,-1,Mon Jun 22 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"Eh,  we have no idea who was offered what or demanded what to stay with the team.  Also, some of the players that we let walk either didn't fit the system as well as they should to garner the contract they'd require or we had viable guys to step into their roles making a big contact not as worthwhile.  Currently they're building a strong core (both lines), and a formidable secondary and (hopefully) strong run game.   We actually appear to be building a team that can help a new QB out once we find him if we haven't already. He'll be protected and have dump off safety valves from our backs while being given good field position by the defense and pro bowl punter.  Add a large receiving target at some point and what more could a QB ask for?"
Browns,3apvsa,holdemtexas,0,Mon Jun 22 15:49:14 2015 UTC,"Gronk?  I mean, you asked. >_>  But I do agree. It is going to be really integral that, if Manziel flails and fails again in 2015, we find the QB, but considering that QB will be coming to a team that likely adds a young WR, has Gordon back, and with a locked-down offensive scheme and O-Line, they might actually have a (gasp) chance to succeed.  Unlike, say, Colt McCoy, who, limited as he may have been, was throwing to fucking Carlton Mitchell with the right side of the line being an absolute joke. That's I guess the point here. Imagine where Colt McCoy would be today if we had given him Julio Jones in 2011. I don't know if we instantly become an amazing team, or anything like that, but the lack of foresight has sunk this team in the past. I'm just hoping that maybe this regime knows who they want moving forward and is already planning for things in 3-4-5 years time to set this team up right."
Browns,3apvsa,holdemtexas,0,Mon Jun 22 17:38:33 2015 UTC,"what more could a QB realistically ask for?   Happy?  :)  Yeah, Colt would have been much better on this team than the team he was on but I'm still not too convinced he'd be a true franchise QB.  I definitely think he'd have been good enough to play well enough for a few years while they went out and found their guy."
Browns,3apvsa,java-dev,2,Mon Jun 22 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, again, he was limited by his own capabilities.  What I'm saying is, I agree with your point; it's good to have things in order before moving forward. Because look at all of the QB's that have become ""franchise guys"" since the first of our ""big 22"" picks (Quinn/Weeden/Manziel); only one succeeded because of their own god-level talent (Andrew Luck). The rest either labored and struggled through a rebuilding process (Stafford, Newton) or had a decent team around them to step into (Wilson, Ryan, Flacco, Tannehill, Foles, Kaepernick, Dalton). Some could've been good but either faced injuries (Bradford, Locker, Kolb) or had a system around them that was set-up to fail after the short-term (Griffin, Freeman, Sanchez).  And there were plenty that were just plain limited in their potential (Quinn, Weeden, Russell, Claussen, Henne, Smith, Manuel, McCoy, Skelton, Lindley, Ponder, Gabbert, Yates, Cousins, etc. etc.). But I could argue that in a different situation, maybe you see Claussen or Henne make something of themselves. Maybe Gabbert on a non-awful Jacksonville team with time to sit for two years is a completely different player. Maybe Colt overcomes himself and keeps the starting job into 2012 with Julio Jones to throw to. Who knows? But you can never know any of that if you don't have a solid foundation. Yes, a franchise QB is what gets you to the playoffs, but you'll never even have a chance at one if you don't right the rest of the ship, which is the only thing positive I can say coming into this season; that looks like the way we're going.  Now just get Jared Goff and a top-flight wideout and we can call it a 2016 playoff run."
Browns,3apvsa,miked1be,0,Mon Jun 22 18:33:40 2015 UTC,"the two things we needed to get locked down and correct (QB and WR)   QB I get, but WR? I can't wrap my mind around the fact that so many people want our team to take a WR in the first or second round. IMHO, it's like taking a punter in the first. Both help your team, but you could have the best punter or wide receiver the game has ever seen, and you still won't make the playoffs without a top tier offense or defense.   A perfect example is Calvin Johnson. He's the greatest receiver of this generation, and if he's in the league for another 4-5 years, he'll be on Jerry Rice's heals for best of all time. Guess how many superbowls he's been too? Zero. He's only made the playoffs twice in his career and the Lions lost both times on wild card weekend.   Wide Receivers just aren't that valuable. Not valuable enough for a first round pick. Maybe, maybe a mid first round pick if you're selecting the next Jerry Rice or megatron but those are once in a generation players. A superstar wide receiver is not going to change your team from a bottom dwelling joke to a playoff bound team. Just ask the 2013 Browns how having the season's best WR panned out for them.  So why? Why do people still think we should be taking a first round wide receiver? What's the thought process behind it? How can they toss out logic and embrace the illogical? Is it because of video games? Are wide receivers valuable in madden or something? I've never played Madden so maybe people who play the game look at football differently. I don't know, it's just maddening to see people suggest things that don't make sense."
Browns,3apvsa,java-dev,-1,Mon Jun 22 20:20:12 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify; I would've liked to see a more dynamic WR option than Vince Mayle. And I didn't like either of Devante Parker or Breshad Perriman. But there were a few options in the second round I did like (namely, Jaelen Strong, who has a similar skill set to Josh Gordon in my view).  The thing is, you still have to have some fucking people out there to catch footballs. And right now, it is still a liability; Rob Housler is an unknown and Barnidge is only good in spots, making TE an issue. Bowe hasn't been seen as a pure WR1 and Hartline's production dropped off. The rest of our WR options are either too young (Mayle) and raw to make a instant impact, or are slot guys (Gabriel, Benjamin, Hawkins) who can't make the same type of plays. You need to have certain types of WR, and you can only get certain types of WR that play at high levels at certain times. Same for TE.  And yes, that's a valid point, but in terms of ""positions where the Browns are weak"", WR and TE are very, very high up there. And we really did address WR with the signings of Bowe and Hartline, but it might not be enough to give Manziel/McCown enough of a dynamic offense. Yes, a ground-and-pound will get you far, but it's also not going to be the end all be all at the end of the day. You need reliable proven targets; you can get those anywhere in the draft, but it's still a passing league, and if you don't have an elite QB, your targets need to be even better.  And even with an elite QB, you need top flight receiving talent. Sometimes it's a two way street where one leads to the other, but I don't see anyone sitting here saying that the Patriots are unhappy with Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski.  If it's the right player at the right time, you take them. That's pretty much all it is to me, regardless of position. I don't think anyone was going to be bitching if Amari Cooper fell into Cleveland's laps."
Browns,3apvsa,miked1be,-1,Mon Jun 22 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you still have to have some fucking people out there to catch footballs.   I never said anything about not picking up WRs, I said my problem was with people wanting us to draft them ""in the first round"", and to an extent, the second round. I think it was you yourself who said people got up and walked out of the bar you were in because we didn't pick up a WR in the first round of a draft. That's what I'm talking about. To me, that's stupid. We don't even have a QB. A WR isn't going to help us win games at all. The WR position is a luxury position. It's something you start to look at after the rest of the pieces are already in place. Even then, it still might be better to draft for depth elsewhere.   but in terms of ""positions where the Browns are weak"", WR and TE are very, very high up there.   The Browns are also weak at the kicker position. Should we have picked up one of those in the first round?   You can have the best 4 WRs in the NFL running your routes, but if your QB is Brandon Weeden, they're not going to win you a single game. However, if your QB is Tom Brady, you could have completely average, or even below average receivers, and make it to a superbowl. The WR position isn't particularly valuable in real life. It might be in Madden, but all the 'real life' evidence points the the position not being super important to a long successful franchise."
Browns,3apvsa,java-dev,-4,Mon Jun 22 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"You're not looking for a real answer, you're looking for confirmation bias.  And that's fine, but call a spade a spade.  None of the previous arguments were even remotely refuted.   But are we going somewhere? Does it feel like we are engaging in a process finally to make the Browns something beyond a consistently mediocre-or-worse team? I   You have to have a QB, everything else is completely worthless.  I can't even fathom how this is not apparent. Take Manning off the colts, they're suddenly going from 12 win+ to 1st pick in the draft.  Give them luck, and they're back to 10+ wins every year.  Anything you add to the team which takes away from your ability to get a franchise QB is screwing your team.  Taking a 5'11"" spread QB with obvious off the field issues is screwing your team.    Its pretty obvious that you can look back in the modern QB era (the last 25+ years) you don't make the playoffs and win superbowls with mediocre and poor QBs, let alone with bad ones.  Our two biggest holes were receiver and QB and we didn't remotely address either one.  We're much close to tanking for this year than trying to win in a vacuum, and I'm not even sure you can find the argument the other way?    Our picks were fine for a team that had some sort of established offense, or QB, not for bringing in the single worst statistically QB in the NFL last year.  But call people names and call out members of the community, because that's clearly worked so well for you over the years.  Disgusting."

Nonsequitor.  But let's address this with the Colts, because they are, in fact, a solid example here:  In 1998, the Colts get Peyton Manning. Now yes, Peyton does turn them into a team of playoff excellence, but he doesn't do that right away, because the team around him was piss-poor. I mean, really, really bad. '98, the Colts go 3-13, and in this era of ""what have you done for me lately"", people would be calling for Peyton's fucking head. It got so bad that the Colts had to let a great player (Marshall Faulk) be traded in order to stock up draft picks and get the rest of the team right; so high an investment that while the Colts would go 13-3 in 1999 and make the playoffs, Indy actually slips to 6-10 as their coach (Mora) and poor drafting slam them into a wall. Yes, they would get over the wall, but everything comes with an ebb and flow; and even then, with their elite QB, it would take 4 seasons to get the whole thing back up to snuff and win the Super Bowl they had been working for.  Yeah, figure that: it took from 1998 to 2006, 8 fucking seasons, to get to and win a Super Bowl with Peyton Manning, with a major fall off in the middle due to a lack in long-term planning. By the time they hit that Super Bowl (and the eventual return trip in 2009), the Colts had set up a dynamic, long-term thinking team, with pro-bowlers on both sides of the ball. So it wasn't as if this transformation was immediate: there was a learning curve even as the team was going 13-3 to get to that point.  The Colts in 2011 did have Peyton Manning hurt, but it wasn't as though this was the sole problem. Their RB (Addai) was banged up and heading to eventual retirement. They were losing depth on defense left and right to severe injuries. Dallas Clark was headed down. They'd also had a fairly poor draft class in 2011 (save Anthony Costanzo) of whom two were injured before the season even began. The whole team was beat up, and they were, as you noted, being led by a shitty QB with no chance for success. So yeah, they were fucked, but the foundation of the team they had built for Peyton Manning was still there.  So when Andrew Luck comes in, not only does he succeed because he's once-in-a-lifetime talent, but because he's still got Reggie Wayne and an okay offensive line and defensive playmakers like Dwight Freeney. Everything that Peyton had, now he has, only now they're healthy and basically have gone from franchise QB to franchise QB.  Now if you can tell me where the Browns' Andrew Luck was in 2015, fine. I know you stood up for Matt Cassell, but you're facing a rather deep public opinion that he may not even make the opening day roster for Buffalo, a team which is currently due to start EJ ""Side Arm Into Traffic"" Manuel. Perhaps Mark Sanchez? After the Jets loaded their roster for him, he still fell down, even if he would be a marginal upgrade. Hoyer? Well, okay, but Hoyer is also almost 30 years old already, an age that puts him in the area of a bridge QB. We could get an ""old guard"" guy like Shaun Hill, but all things considered he would probably be comparable in the end to McCown. None of those options end up being anything more than maybe a slight uptick in production, maybe for a few seasons.  Or what about trades? To get Sam Bradford or Nick Foles, we would've likely had to mortgage our draft, and in terms of Bradford, he was an injury risk and a flight risk, not wanting to be here because of his agent's influence. Foles might have fared better but we'd just be handing away our bonus first (which yes, we spent on Cameron Erving, and I believe you don't agree with that, but it's the principle). Either could have walked away if we didn't extend them and likely would have if someone came calling with a bigger contract.  Okay, how about the draft? Well, we can't get Jameis Winston, because Tampa Bay was destined to take him. What about Mariota? Ask any team that's had to trade away more than 3 first rounders if it was worth it to get that player, no matter how good that player ends up being. Maybe there was a late-round steal? I would've liked to maybe have gotten a low-risk pick in the late rounds like Brett Hundley, but what guarantees that they would be anything?  We fucked up taking Johnny Manziel. But we can't fix that problem if there's no option that is poignantly, significantly better, and we don't want to hand the team off to Manziel or our future QB, whoever that ends up being, in a state of disarray. You're now looking at a team that invested heavily in rounding out the defense, and now will field a deeper, rock-solid offensive line. And you know what team that worked out for, a team that built up the defense over several successful drafts and then worked on the O-Line and ended up in a very similar spot to us when they finally hit on a QB? Seattle. No, we are not Seattle; we probably never will be. But if you believe that having a defense that's got the upside of a Top 5 squad, with a good offensive line and solid running options, couldn't be supplemented next year with a decent QB prospect and turn the corner, and you would rather continue to lump on this regime for not getting you a QB right fucking now when there was no QB to get that would have been anything better than a bridge QB, so that you could have a moral victory of maybe one playoff spot, than you're never going to be happy with this team.   And if you don't believe that QB deficiencies can be masked, because QB play is, even as you say and I agree with, the most important thing in the NFL today, ask me how the 2012 Minnesota Vikings and 2013 Kansas City Chiefs snuck into the playoffs. Because they did it with a ground-and-pound offense and solid D, running with Christian Ponder (who is awful) and Alex Smith (who last year couldn't get a TD to a WR to save his own family). We probably aren't making the playoffs, sure, but it's not like this is the impossible dream here; teams are doing this.  There is no other option for 2015. We have finished the defense. We have finished the offensive line save maybe adding a better RT option in the mid-rounds next year. We had no ""quick fix"" for the QB problem we dug ourselves. If you can present to me a 2015 offseason plan which is more reasonable and solves all the issues we've had, all things considered for cap space, draft picks, where free agents wanted to go, and etc., then please do. I still think we could have made a better push for a TE or WR somewhere in the offseason, fine, and I'm sure that would be part of it. But don't turn this into another ""no, you don't get it, this FO is awful and Johnny is the worst statistical QB"" argument. Give me your plan, 2015 only, that fixes this."

McCown as the starter is tanking, pure and simple and this season will not be fun.    The only hope is if Manziel figures it out, but given that he's not being handed the job against McCown is damning in and of itself.    Ugh.  This is the first season since the return that I am not looking forward to.  The rest we had a fresh QB that we could hope was the guy.  This season, not so much."
Browns,3ajvin,DansBeerBelly,5,Sun Jun 21 00:27:04 2015 UTC,"McCown is a slight SLIGHT upgrade over Hoyer. All we need to do is 4/6 in the division. (Which we were like 2 field goals away from doing last season) and then split the West and beat the Titans. We can beat the Raiders, Rams, Niners, and either the Chargers or Cards. You know what too?! We're going to beat the Broncos at home this year. That's good enough to to make the playoffs. We'll beat the steelers and then lose to probably the Patriots in the divisional round. You'll see. Playoffs AND a playoff win. Predicted."

Browns,3ajvin,Cory_mathews,2,Sun Jun 21 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"You and me both, man. Every year I seem to talk myself into a reason that the Browns would be good. Whether it be a new head coach, coordinator, QB, or RB. Each year I would look at a team that would go from basement dweller to playoffs and think 'why couldn't that be us this year?'. This is honestly the first year I can't even bring myself to even optimistically believe we'll have a good team. It's a team with an 8-8 ceiling and 2-14 floor. Can it be 2017 yet?"
Browns,3ajvin,24rubikscube,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:32:14 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a rebuilding year. It's also a tougher schedule.   If Manziel ends up being what we hoped when we drafted him, then that changes everything. I'm not holding my breathe though."
Browns,3ajvin,Chiranthodendron,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:02:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's really that bad. We have a top 5 secondary with even more talent on the bench. We have a talented LB group and replaced the guys who left with better fits for the system. Our DL now has 80 people and is definitely going to improve. The defense is stacked and, barring injury, should be top 10 at the end of the year.  Offense is another thing, but it's not like we have nothing. Our OL will be massively improved with our new versatility and depth. The WR core seems deeper with Bowe (who is good when he wants to earn more money), Hartline (who is the equivalent of a less injured Miles Austin), and Hawkins/Gabriel. The fact that Travis Benjamin doesn't need to start and we have a rookie waiting in the wings makes me even happier/more optimistic about the group. Our tight ends are essentially the same as last year because Cameron gave us nothing.  At QB, we have McCown. This may seem like a downgrade, but it isn't. Hoyer was a dick. He was decent, but fell apart when the line broke. He floated balls and often under threw guys. He would go into the no huddle to call his own plays because he didn't like Shanahan's (I didn't like them either, but this is kind of a dick move) and he refused to accept his role once it changed. McCown was the offensive coordinator and the QB last year in Tampa Bay. He didn't have an offensive line. He didn't have a running game. He had great WRs, but you see how that turned out?  Best case scenario we make the playoffs or McCown really is a tank machine who gives us the first overall pick next year. Worst case scenario? We miss the playoffs at 10-6."
Browns,3ajvin,fuckingbrowns,4,Mon Jun 22 12:04:34 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, we really seem to have improved our team without actually getting better at scoring. If we find our QB in next year's draft, it should be plug and play and beat the everliving shit out of the AFCN."

Browns,3ajvin,bac5665,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:54:51 2015 UTC,No team without a top 15 QB can be ok in this NFL.  I'm not convinced we have a top-32 QB    The rest literally doesn't matter.
Browns,3ajvin,topper_mango,2,Sun Jun 21 02:57:00 2015 UTC,"You do not need a top 15 quarterback to go deep in the playoffs.  The Jets rode a Pettine defense and Mark frickin' Sanchez to a pair of conference title games not so long ago.  To have an answer at quarterback would be nice, but it's not everything.  This year is about building the sort of team that allows our quarterback of the future (whether that be Manziel or someone else) to succeed.  I don't know about you, but I'm tired of dropping first round picks on quarterbacks and plugging them in to a team without weapons, depth, or defense and watching them fail miserably.  If you get the team right, the quarterback position eventually takes care of itself (look no further than Pittsburgh and Baltimore for examples of well built teams who won for years before they finally found their guy)."
Browns,3ajvin,bac5665,0,Sun Jun 21 13:57:17 2015 UTC,"And Sanchez played very well those years.  In fact, like a top 15 QB."
Browns,3ajvin,TapedeckNinja,2,Sun Jun 21 13:58:44 2015 UTC,"By what measure?  2009: 23rd in tQBR, 28th in passer rating, 27th in ANY/A, -24.6 PFF rating (2nd worst among starting QBs), 162.9 Y/G, 12 TDs to 20 INTs  2010: 17th in tQBR, 19th in passer rating, 24th in ANY/A, -6.2 PFF rating (22nd among starting QBs), 205.7 Y/G, 17 TDs to 13 INTs  That really doesn't look like a top-15 QB."
Browns,3ajvin,topper_mango,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:46:37 2015 UTC,"Because he had a good team around him!  Good teams make average quarterbacks look good!    Those Jets teams had a lot in common with the 2015 Browns.  Stellar offensive line, stellar defensive backfield, adequate and deep defensive line, and a hodgepodge of castoffs, has-beens or never-were's masquerading as an offense (Santonio Holmes, Braylon Edwards, Jerricho Cotchery, Ladanian Tomlinson, Shonne Greene, etc...)."
Browns,3ajvin,bac5665,2,Sun Jun 21 14:16:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm saying it's unlikely.  Really unlikely.    And Sanchez almost certainly is a better QB than Manziel or McCown.  Sanchez isn't great, but he's serviceable.  You can start him and run a respectable team while you look for the long term answer.  McCown, other than one year in CHI has failed to do even that in his career."

We have a head coach and GM who are on the same page.  Whens the last time you heard an annoying Jimmy Haslam is meddling comment?  We're really deep at corner and DL.  I feel like a lot of people didn't watch how Seattle did it. The browns are copying the seahawks. The same 'hawks who barely went 8-8 winning a terrible nfcw (see carolina last year for refrence) barely won their home WC game thanks to a once in a lifetime run, and got hammered by da bears the next week.

Browns,3aja4m,tytrim89,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:36:08 2015 UTC,This is one of the best team write ups I've ever read. As a lifelong Cleveland fan I know this year won't be elite but I'm excited too see where this leads us. A defense that's gonna seriously Crack some skulls I think and an offense that needs a qb but has some talented guys and a monstrous o-line.
Browns,3aja4m,fmessiahcon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:44:43 2015 UTC,Great write up. I think Hughes will start over Starks on the line though.

Browns,3aiber,inferno167,3,Sun Jun 21 00:52:33 2015 UTC,I like Mingo.  But he needs to learn how to tackle.  Which is a weird thing to say of a football player.
Browns,3aiber,stangstang,12,Sat Jun 20 16:44:07 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Mingo basically playing with one arm most of last year? I thought I read he has major shoulder issues that needed surgery?  Anyway, I agree. It would be nice if our OLBs could set a frikken edge now and then too. We blamed the DL for the running woes and rightly so to some degree. But a lot of those big gains were because our OLBs lost containment too."

Browns,3akb42,FernsAreFine,5,Sun Jun 21 12:30:32 2015 UTC,There is absolutely no harm in giving him a tryout. Coaches don't like him? He goes home at the end of the day.
Browns,3akb42,740Buckeye,3,Sun Jun 21 09:28:39 2015 UTC,He's never played a down at WR. I'd rather give players who have actually played WR before over someone who hasn't.

Browns,3akb42,740Buckeye,2,Sun Jun 21 09:32:47 2015 UTC,He could do worse though. I think he will be a terrible receiver.

Browns,3agr34,montemonte316,11,Sat Jun 20 00:56:59 2015 UTC,Buy the cheapest tickets possible and just move to any empty seat you want to watch from. I personally like the upper deck as close to the 50 as possible. Being a pre-season game there will be empty seats all over the stadium.
Browns,3agr34,bowhunter6274,5,Sat Jun 20 01:22:21 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on that bro. I have a sneaky feeling as soon as we ""break the rules"" and change seats, she will be paying more attention to the usher than the game, because ""they know these aren't our seats and we're going to get kicked out!"".  Just want to avoid that situation and enjoy the game."
Browns,3agr34,felisrufus,6,Sat Jun 20 01:55:20 2015 UTC,"Preseason? Honestly the stadium will be mostly empty and you can move wherever you want as long is its not club seats. I have done it for years.  $40 a seat is way too high. If you wait, I'm sure you can get some way cheaper. If you're really willing to risk it, you could probably get some outside the stadium for $5"

Browns,3agr34,JRockstar50,3,Sat Jun 20 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"No no no no. If youre set on going Preseason (don't), then get your tickets on StubHub a week or so prior to the game.  Preseason you can get in for under $10 and you can move around"
Browns,3agr34,Djbuckets,2,Sat Jun 20 12:32:40 2015 UTC,If you're tailgating just buy a couple from a scalper in one of the lots. Should be able to do way better than $40 for lower level. If you want security and to not have to worry about anything the day of then just spend the $80 for some peace of mind. It's not like it's $800 for finals tickets or something.
Browns,3agr34,vousaimezmike,2,Sat Jun 20 11:13:04 2015 UTC,$40 for a preseason game? Are they letting you sit on the bench with the team? I just give my preseason tickets away. Take her to training camp for free and a real game.
Browns,3agr34,wickedshxt,2,Sat Jun 20 12:45:26 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, definitely do NOT buy preseason tickets now, they can be had for next to nothing, if not nothing, once it's close.  Also as others have said, you're better off waiting for the regular season, preseason games are a waste."
Browns,3agr34,Always_Next_Year,2,Sat Jun 20 15:45:18 2015 UTC,I know people with season tickets who couldn't give preseason tickets away. Post on Craigslist in Cleveland and say you want some preseason tickets and you will pay $10 a piece for them. Somebody will email you.

He said the thing that people who lived and breathed this city thought, but didn't have the balls or the clout to say.  And you want to villify him for that? You should be praising his name, because he fits right into your mantra, but you want to be an edgy kid who follows the ""cool"" trend of hating on him.  Well you shouldnt.

Browns,3ad8jo,ccavana3,4,Fri Jun 19 04:36:45 2015 UTC,I can't believe how far this dude fell. I remember watching him play against a local school when he was a senior. Jeannette Jayhawks vs Wilmington Greyhounds at Slippery Rock University. That day I saw one of the single most talented athletes that I've laid eyes on still to this day.   100 yard interception return that day (he played as a DB on defense). Still burned into my memory.   I'll never forget how he essentially took the entire game over himself. My cousin played for Wilmington and basically conceded that they would've had no shot even if the team were full of all-state players. He was that dominant. The Tressel scandal ruined him.   Jordan Hall was also on the same team that day.
Browns,3ad8jo,dring_round,8,Fri Jun 19 04:44:13 2015 UTC,What ruined him was a terrible throwing motion he could never fix.
Browns,3ad8jo,sgSaysR,4,Fri Jun 19 16:13:57 2015 UTC,"Dude, your memory of him is flawed. Is he an amazing athlete? Absolutely. Was he ever going to be an NFL QB? Not a chance."
Browns,3ad8jo,uuunity,4,Fri Jun 19 17:13:16 2015 UTC,Never said for certain he was going to be an amazing QB did I? I said he was a great raw athlete. If he would've worked on mechanics etc he could've been a faster Cam Newton imo. He didn't develop right.
Browns,3ad8jo,dring_round,-1,Fri Jun 19 17:35:40 2015 UTC,"You just contradicted yourself your saying you never said he was going to be an amazing Qb then you said he ""could"" be a faster cam newton which would be an amazing Qb, so make up your mind."

Browns,3ad8jo,clycloptopus,4,Fri Jun 19 06:54:42 2015 UTC,"Because you aren't signing table scraps. He is a table scrap QB, just 1 month ago he said he didn't want to play WR. Now that he has no option to play QB, he has decided to take his freakish size (he has Megtron measurables) and try to actually play in the NFL.   The biggest thing is that it is no-risk. If we got him, he isn't guaranteed anything and we can cut him if he doesn't work. But someone who is athletic and has that size makes sense to try him."

If this guy went to literally any other school he'd never get mentioned, but because he went to OS people want to spend a top five pick on him. You're all too impatient to let Manziel develop but you'll take this guy who couldn't possibly be more raw. He'll take years of development before he's close to NFL ready at this point."
Browns,3ad8jo,Marzman315,6,Fri Jun 19 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"Anyone who walked into three championship games with ice water in his veins and dominated them all would be talked about, no matter what school he played for. The potential is far more intriguing from an NFL standpoint than Manziel ever has been. Cardale has a size that cannot be taught and he doesn't seem to have attitude issues. Any guesses on if he'll waste and entire year in the NFL partying and then have to go to rehab?"
Browns,3ad8jo,Back41DayOnly,3,Fri Jun 19 18:43:41 2015 UTC,his running game dominated  did you think hoyer was dominating early in the season last year too?
Browns,3ad8jo,Abiv23,-1,Fri Jun 19 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"How many third and longs did Cardale convert against Alabama? The running game had great stats, but it wasn't making it easy by any means.  Hoyer wasn't dominating, but he was winning. That's more than we can say about any other QB we've had in a long time [DA's fluke year the one exception]."
Browns,3ad8jo,Back41DayOnly,3,Fri Jun 19 18:54:29 2015 UTC,246 yards rushing by Elliott meant 1 on 1 coverage on the outside (not to mention Ifo Ekpre-Olomu being injured in practice leading up to game)  Let's see if Cardale even starts this year before crowning him
Browns,3ad8jo,Abiv23,2,Fri Jun 19 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"Just like we waited to crown Manziel, right?  I have no problem with seeing what happens this season with Cardale. I'm definitely not interested in drafting another QB who clearly doesn't belong. There's plenty of good QB's coming up in this draft."

Browns,3acd6e,leopold_stotch21,2,Fri Jun 19 13:46:31 2015 UTC,It isn't supposed to do that. When the machine is embroidering the letters they should cut the thread between letters but some knock off companies will skip this step to save time. Not really a big deal.

Despite having only 39 receptions last year he had the same YPC (12.8) that he had in the previous season I which he had 70+ receptions.  Who else had exactly 12.8 YPC the last two years? Mike Wallace. Who people constantly label a deep threat.
Browns,3abf29,SANDFIGHT,2,Thu Jun 18 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not advocating for Mike Wallace as he's one of the most overrated players in the NFL. He wanted to be a true #1 receiver and Miami signed him to be that, so they started having him run the full route tree and he had a lot of WR screens thrown his way. He proved he really was best suited to be exactly what Pittspuke used him as, just a deep threat. That said, Brian Hartline is no burner, never was. He's a solid receiver but he's no #1, more of a solid #2. Problem is that's also what Bowe is at this point in his career. The WR corps does lack true deep speed overall, that's the biggest blow from losing you know who. Hartline is going to be a decent possession guy hopefully, someone reliable on 3rd downs and in the red zone hopefully. We need that too so I hope he returns to his form of a few years ago."
Browns,3abf29,Carpetron,3,Thu Jun 18 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"Everything you said is spot on.  Can Gabriel be the true deep threat being so short?  The problem with his size is, he's not the sharpest cutter, not the best route runner and doesn't have the quickest acceleration.  Where a Jackson can be the smaller receiver because he is insanely fast off the line and in changing direction."
Browns,3abf29,java-dev,2,Fri Jun 19 11:55:50 2015 UTC,"I've heard Mayle is looking like a decent red zone target because of his size, so we have that going for us."

Browns,3abf29,jsho4realyo,2,Thu Jun 18 21:59:10 2015 UTC,"he compared himself to big-time receivers who are similar in size to him, Antonio Brown and Steve Smith, and he had a more impactful rookie season than both of those two stars combined    how so?  EDIT: don't get me wrong here, I love me some T-Gabe, and some wideout news. I seriously want the facts here."
Browns,3abf29,ccavana3,4,Fri Jun 19 06:23:24 2015 UTC,"I think he was saying his rookie year compared to their rookie years. Not his 2014 vs their 2014's. If thats the case he had 36 receptions on 71 targets for 621 yards, at an average of 17.3. Antonio Brown had 16 receptions on 19 targets for 167 yards, at an average of 10.4. Steve Smith Sr. had 10 receptions on ?? targets for 154 yards at an average of 15.4. I can see the point he was trying to make if that was the case."
Browns,3abf29,lonewolfman,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:46:20 2015 UTC,"Gabriel was our best WR last year already.  The dude can flat get open, and he blocks like a guy 6 inches taller and 20lbs bigger, great player and I can't wait to see him play this year."

Browns,3aa9bl,Mustang1718,10,Thu Jun 18 15:00:58 2015 UTC,This was the one to stick out to me the most. I'm curious as to whether we have guys at LB that have enough range to fit a 4-3. Would we see Kirksey and Mingo on the outside with Dansby in the middle? Do we rotate Kruger down to a DE on some plays for pass rushing? How versatile is Nate Orchard?
Browns,3aa9bl,bgrueyw,4,Thu Jun 18 15:30:33 2015 UTC,"I think Orchard is an edge guy. I would guess that we would see Kirksy, Dansby and Robertson in 4-3 formations."

McCown is going to be 36 and was only slightly better than Hoyer with TB last year.  The defense will be a top 5 unit? Last year we had the best defensive back field (per many metrics and by PFF ratings) and defensive line was a priority, with Jim O'Neil's 2nd year I think they easily improve. We can beat Denver at home? I think Denver isn't nearly as tough as last year (especially on their offensive line) and we match up very well on defense. This is the ""boldest"" prediction but is maybe 40% likely now? Our running backs will be a top 10 unit? We where the top unit before Mack went down and we improved the line this year. We are actually going to throw to our RBs and Duke seems pretty legit. Being a top 10 unit behind a top 5 run blocking line isn't too bold."
Browns,3abeiv,bearsdriving,2,Thu Jun 18 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"The Browns would be doing themselves a disservice if they allowed Josh McCown to go the whole season as the leader of the offense. Unless McCown is leading the team to a definitive playoff spot, the Browns need to find out what they have in Manziel going into the potentially great quarterback class of the 2016 NFL Draft.   Isn't this almost the exact same thing being said last year?"

The money sign is a Drake thing which is all about "" me "" .  I feel the difference is obvious.  But let's pretend it isn't.  One guy is the one of the best ever, and the other guy is an unproven fuck up who's earned nothing.  You make any kind of sign when you're a nobody is the quintessential ""me"" play"
Browns,3a6vrb,java-dev,3,Wed Jun 17 20:05:47 2015 UTC,Wish I could give you more upvotes for the Jim Brown mention. People forget that he is/was a woman beater. My person view of him is very tainted because of that.
Browns,3a6vrb,Quikey,4,Wed Jun 17 20:28:20 2015 UTC,his money sign is a symbol of the time where this Johnny Football persona consumed him and ultimately led to his spiral out of control.

Browns,3a6vrb,miked1be,0,Thu Jun 18 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"i'm not saying that they will be making fun of his substance abuse issue.  what i am saying is this: if manziel truly beats his demons, his rise-from-the-ashes story will be on ESPN, everywhere, like he is currently while he sucks.

Browns,3a6vrb,Godszn,6,Wed Jun 17 19:44:37 2015 UTC,"I don't really care, but I keep hearing this explanation of the money sign origin. To my knowledge, it is wrong. Though he could totally be lying I guess, Johnny explained last year that it was a ""thing"" at A&M:   Manziel said it started during his redshirt season at A&M as a “playful gesture” between himself and running back Ben Molina.  “What me and Ben Molina would do, when were freshman at A&M, was kind of just say, let’s get this money, let’s go make a play for this team. Me and Ben kind of had an inside joke, and look where it is now.”"
Browns,3a6vrb,alfredbester,7,Wed Jun 17 18:41:56 2015 UTC,Yes. He did it at A&M before he ever met Drake.

Browns,3acwue,barneythecarni,0,Fri Jun 19 22:05:20 2015 UTC,What agenda do I have?
Browns,3acwue,RP336,5,Sun Jun 21 11:54:01 2015 UTC,Grossi has been a putz for a very long time. He's still bitter that the Browns stopped giving him info. He exists solely to be Cleveland's personal Skip Bayless at this point.

Browns,3a6480,Brokewood,37,Wed Jun 17 18:51:25 2015 UTC,I couldn't believe the commentators mentioning how long Golden state has waited to win the championship while they're sitting there in Cleveland. Wanted to choke somebody!
Browns,3a6480,Back41DayOnly,23,Wed Jun 17 16:03:22 2015 UTC,I mean they talked about our drought earlier and it is true that Golden State and Oakland have had a long drought. Honestly I'd rather them talk about that than snarkily commenting on how ours continues.
Browns,3a6480,LosingMyEdge7,11,Wed Jun 17 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they definitely showed our championship drought EVERY game in the series...  WE GET IT"

Browns,3a6480,g4r4e0g,2,Wed Jun 17 21:11:42 2015 UTC,Raiders v Browns.  Probably the most unlikely matchup.  I'm for it though.
Browns,3a6480,Don_Drapers_Whiskey,6,Thu Jun 18 03:13:31 2015 UTC,Though to be honest i think the Indians have the best shot at the championship if they weren't in the AL Central...... yes that makes no sense.
Browns,3a6480,g4r4e0g,4,Wed Jun 17 17:53:17 2015 UTC,With the wildcard it makes it a little easier.   The central is tough.
Browns,3a6480,Back41DayOnly,2,Wed Jun 17 19:00:36 2015 UTC,still waiting for a meteor to hit detroit as miggy is up to bat making the central much easier to win.
Browns,3a6480,Abiv23,2,Wed Jun 17 19:15:12 2015 UTC,I'd aim that meteor for KC instead at this point

Browns,3a6480,Back41DayOnly,4,Wed Jun 17 20:32:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. The Cavs are still a very good team, and can likely reach the finals again next year. As long as they don't get gutted in free agency."
Browns,3a6480,jesus_zombie_attack,3,Wed Jun 17 20:26:42 2015 UTC,free agency and how everyone comes back from their injuries will be the key

Browns,3a6480,casiotron,3,Wed Jun 17 21:20:24 2015 UTC,And the cavs were two injuries from bringing the championship.  I'm pretty sure the cavs are currently our best bet for a championship.

Browns,3a71hg,Flables,8,Wed Jun 17 19:01:07 2015 UTC,John Manziel.
Browns,3a71hg,kevler9oh,5,Thu Jun 18 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"Instead of the money sign, he will now just deliver a firm handshake to the 10 other offensive players on scoring plays."

Browns,3a71hg,St0ckt0nS,12,Thu Jun 18 04:40:29 2015 UTC,"Johnny is doing things that are putting himself in a position to be successful and the Browns are doing things to put him in a position to be successful. Very good things going on. Need to get Manziel to a place where his talent will decide his success and he's a talented kid. Get rid of the distractions (downtown life, drinking, Drake AND Hoyer) and replace those with positive things and refocus instead of giving up.  Big props to McCown too, embracing Johnny which is exactly what Manziel needs both professionally and personally at this point. Doesn't need the cold shoulder this year. Plus if you're McCown and you and Johnny connect and he learns from you....you're done playing a in few years and you may still have a paycheck coming because of your relationship with Manziel. Win-win in everyones eyes.  Browns have done a great job at just being steady, not overreacting to anything and making some smart decisions. Its clear the long term plan for this team is for Manziel to grow into a good NFL QB. Hopefully it'll all pay off."
Browns,3a71hg,HawkeyeJosh,3,Wed Jun 17 20:08:17 2015 UTC,Plus if you're McCown and you and Johnny connect and he learns from you....you're done playing a in few years and you may still have a paycheck coming because of your relationship with Manziel.   What do you mean here?
Browns,3a71hg,HawkeyeJosh,4,Thu Jun 18 01:21:33 2015 UTC,"I'd assume that if Josh can successfully pass the reigns over to Johnny, the Browns will leave a roster spot open for him for an extra year or two. He's in his late 30s and doesn't have much legit starting time left, staying on an NFL roster past your physical usefulness is the type of job security that quite a few guys dream about."

Browns,3a71hg,stangstang,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:05:51 2015 UTC,It would certainly be hard to pass on him as our backup.  He may not be a true starter in the league but a quality backup is worth keeping around too.
Browns,3a71hg,SaintDemure,3,Thu Jun 18 04:42:07 2015 UTC,"He's doing the smart thing.  If he flames out or johnny straight up beats him for the job, he is securing an opportunity to be a backup here."

Browns,3a5op7,MonarchStarcrack,11,Wed Jun 17 13:26:30 2015 UTC,Word is he's been a star of camp so far
Browns,3a5op7,Carpetron,15,Wed Jun 17 14:07:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, and nothing against Crow or West, but Duke has the pedigree to be a huge star."
Browns,3a5op7,MonarchStarcrack,6,Wed Jun 17 14:08:47 2015 UTC,Hopefully he looks just as good when they put the pads on and start hitting.
Browns,3a5op7,scsmith83,2,Wed Jun 17 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"My first reaction is 'shut up, he'll be fine.' I've listened to the hype and he could be very, very good. But looking at his weight it is a bit scary.    He is 5'9"" and 194 lbs, 16 lbs lighter than Andre Ellington who the Cards have been looking to replace because he can't stay healthy or take the NFL pounding at that weight.    Here is a look at ideal running back height and weight.  Here is a look at RB BMI that is interesting. It was published in '08 but is still valid. For reference, Duke has a 28.6 BMI.  Also, Jamaal Charles is one of the best RBs in history (5.5 ypa is the best all time career average over Jim Brown, who is 0.3 ypa behind him) and he is only a 27.8 BMI, which bucks the trend."
Browns,3a5op7,bearsdriving,4,Wed Jun 17 15:21:43 2015 UTC,"His combine weight was 207.      http://www.nfl.com/draft/2015/profiles/duke-johnson?id=2552461  Also, Ellington as far as I can tell is more of an inside runner while Duke is an outside runner/pass catcher.  Duke's weakness seems to have been vision in finding the hole on inside routes which is what we have guys like Crowell and/or West for."
Browns,3a5op7,rhombergnation,3,Wed Jun 17 15:31:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where this myth of Duke's weakness being vision came from.  Nothing could be further than the truth.  His vision is what has always made him so outstanding.  At Miami, he got lots of comparison's to Frank Gore because they share a similar incredible vision on inside runs."
Browns,3a5op7,bearsdriving,0,Wed Jun 17 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"I'm just going off of his draft profiles for the most part, I really didn't watch him at all.  If that's not a problem then that's awesome but he's still a bit on the small side to be an up the middle runner.  Even if his vision is fine he'll still be utilized (at least at first) as an outside runner or pass catching RB which is fine because it compliments what we already have perfectly.  He'll be a great addition to our backfield if he's anywhere close to his potential.  I can't wait to see him out there."
Browns,3a5op7,Scuba44,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:32:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, if he is 207 and keeps his quickness that is awesome. I was worried that the 10 lbs lighter made him quicker and more elusive but when pads went on he'd lose that edge.   Also, Ellington isn't an inside runner as much, he actually fits Duke's game pretty well. He had the 6th most receptions last year for RBs despite missing a quarter of the season."
Browns,3a5op7,LosingMyEdge7,2,Wed Jun 17 18:01:46 2015 UTC,He was like 204 in his last season at Miami and will probably add a couple pounds before the season starts.  Expect him to be closer to 210 by then.
Browns,3a5op7,rhombergnation,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:43:11 2015 UTC,Hopefully they're smart with him and limit the reps while maximizing his impact on the game. Crow and West are solid options after all.
Browns,3a5op7,Bhockzer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I imagine it will be like a Hill/Bernard situation in Cinci.  Duke is right about the same size as Bernard, who's doing well in his role."
Browns,3a5op7,Abiv23,5,Wed Jun 17 16:23:25 2015 UTC,"As a hurricane fan who has kept up with this guy's career since he was a freshman in high school, all i can say is you guys got potentially the biggest steal of the draft.  Electric, one of a kind type of football player."

Browns,3a6h6e,miked1be,7,Wed Jun 17 16:41:33 2015 UTC,You know MKC is going to ask that question at him. And so are other reporters.
Browns,3a6h6e,miked1be,2,Wed Jun 17 16:47:18 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean he'll give any sort of conclusive answer.
Browns,3a6h6e,miked1be,2,Wed Jun 17 17:29:32 2015 UTC,"I would imagine he would want to get it out of the way and put it behind him and move on, no?"
Browns,3a6h6e,StalinOut,2,Wed Jun 17 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"Has the media made a big deal about not knowing what drug the addition was to that I haven't seen?  The fact that it isn't clear has been mentioned but it hasn't exactly been talked about outside of the morbid curiosity of some fans.  Why does it matter so much?  He had an addiction problem and went to rehab, his camp has obviously not released the specifics yet so they're probably not going to now.  He MAY admit it was alcohol but if he does it could be true or it could be just to say something that isn't a violation of the substance abuse policy, he's certainly not going to admit that he broke league rules.   Edit:  Yep:  http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2015/06/johnny_manziel_at_cleveland_br.html   He said he doesn't want to talk about going to rehab and all that it entailed. ""I'm trying to close a chapter on my life.''"
Browns,3a6h6e,blackedout,5,Wed Jun 17 18:27:12 2015 UTC,Any update? Did he speak?

Browns,3a7zae,xXx_1username1_xXx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:03:53 2015 UTC,"If you search ""Brown's projected roster"" in Google, you get about 4 articles from different sites doing some version of that. And I can't remember exactly off the top of my head, but I know one of the sites (maybe Cleveland.com) is doing a position-by-position breakdown. Though I think they're only a few groups in.   And if you're looking for a breakdown of the roster at the end of last year for comparison, I think there's a post for that on this sub so maybe check for that from before the draft.  Edit: I found the site that's doing the position breakdowns. It was The Bleacher Report."

Browns,3a3w81,atech087,2,Wed Jun 17 09:50:53 2015 UTC,Or if we wouldn't have missed 13 Free Throws :(
Browns,3a3w81,Kylekub,2,Wed Jun 17 13:07:59 2015 UTC,"All game I was sitting there wondering... how do PROFESSIONAL players miss what are the most repeatable and consistent shot available in all of basketball? Back when I played in school, our coach made us shoot free throws until we made 10 in a row. This was after running and doing every other bit of practice. If our free throw % dipped below 85% we didn't get to start the next game until we brought it back up. Those free throw points killed us last night and I feel like they did the entire seriea."
Browns,3a3w81,gakule,2,Wed Jun 17 04:05:40 2015 UTC,exactly! Im all for supporting LeBron... but the self proclaimed best player in the world better make his damn free throws =\
Browns,3a3w81,Kylekub,5,Wed Jun 17 11:15:34 2015 UTC,I'd still say hands down he's the best individual player in the NBA right now. He dragged the cavs kicking and screaming to game 6 nearly single handedly.

Browns,3a3w81,jvpewster,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:43:24 2015 UTC,"Free throws is just a misnomer that kills causal fans. If your entire HS team shot above 85% from the line you'd be the best ft shooting team in the country. Players do practice free throws a lot but it's hard to replicate the fatigue and muscle strain of an nba game without destroying your body. Even guys like Dwight shoot above 70% in practice and they take thousands, it's just that their legs go out during games and it's hard to be so accurate."

Browns,3a2gkd,740Buckeye,23,Tue Jun 16 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"Reportedly showed up to practice with the injury, not a result of anything on-field."
Browns,3a2gkd,Wookie_Goldberg,10,Tue Jun 16 18:32:59 2015 UTC,Wow. Good thing he signed the qualifying offer and not a long term deal. Hopefully this is nothing and he hurt it training on his own. We don't need any motorcycle injuries.
Browns,3a2gkd,24rubikscube,10,Tue Jun 16 19:58:20 2015 UTC,"Did he not report it? I hope he didn't try to get an extension while coming in the door like, ""btw, I fucked my leg up. Figured it wasn't a biggie since we were so busy negotiating $. I'll see yah later. Ttyl. Bie."""

Browns,3a2gkd,miked1be,0,Wed Jun 17 04:19:33 2015 UTC,Supposedly he'd be able to play if there was a real game to play but they're being precautionary.
Browns,3a2gkd,iliekdrugs,12,Wed Jun 17 13:44:57 2015 UTC,Maybe this is why he wanted a long-term contract so bad
Browns,3a2gkd,Chiranthodendron,8,Tue Jun 16 18:45:10 2015 UTC,He wanted a long term contract because everyone wants job security.
Browns,3a2gkd,jhook87,8,Wed Jun 17 04:02:28 2015 UTC,oh for fucks sake
Browns,3a2gkd,DREWBICE,4,Tue Jun 16 19:55:44 2015 UTC,He will be fine by the start of the season I would imagine.
Browns,3a2gkd,Daviroth,5,Tue Jun 16 19:02:37 2015 UTC,Definitely. The start of the season is so far away for muscle injuries. He could probably have his hamstring ripped in half and he would still be ready to go by the season.
Browns,3a2gkd,NoMagic,2,Tue Jun 16 20:49:34 2015 UTC,Paintball injury.

Browns,3a2mw7,miked1be,2,Tue Jun 16 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"Coaching Changes (that I can think of):     Lost Kyle Shanahan (OC) Gained John DeFilippo (OC) Lost Dowell Loggains (QB coach, fired) Gained new QB coach (I think) Joker Phillips to WR Coach   Free Agency (biggest moves, but not all inclusive):   Lost Jabal Sheard (New England) Lost Buster Skrine (New York Jets) Lost Jordan Cameron (Miami Dolphins)  Lost Brian Hoyer (Texans) Signed Josh McCown (QB, Tampa Bay) Signed Tramon Williams (CB, Green Bay) Signed Dwayne Bowe (WR, Kansas City) Signed Brian Hartline (WR, Miami) Signed Thad Lewis (QB, Buffalo?) Traded for Andy Lee (P, San Francisco) for 7th round pick Cut P Spencer Lanning   Offseason News worth noting:      Shanahan makes the Browns look like a shit show so they'll let him quit  Dowell Loggains is fired Browns focus on Defense in the draft Browns opt for Josh McCown over Brian Hoyer We're gonna get a bunch of compensatory picks next year due to how FA was played Total rework of key special teams players (Lanning, Cundiff, and Yount are all gone)   Starting Line-up: OL: Thomas, Bitonio, Mack, Erving, Schwartz (or maybe Schwartz, Erving for RG/RT respectively - who knows) QB: Currently Josh McCown RB: Isaiah Crowell WR: Bowe, Hartline, Hawkins TE: Barnadge?  Defense: DL: Shelton, Starks, Bryant OLB: Kruger, Mingo ILB: Dansby, Robertson CB: Haden, Williams S: Gipson, Whitner  Strengths: O-line should be dominant and help establish a great running game.  D-line should be improved, especially as Shelton gets experience - entire D should be improved there.  Special teams has been a major focus  Weakness: Passing game - both from lack of QB talent and a not hugely exceptional WR core.  Kicking - no idea who our new kicker will be or if they're any good.  Kick returner - god help us all.  Training camp battles:    QB: McCown vs. Manziel for QB1 RB: Johnson vs. West for RB2 CB: T. Williams vs. Gilbert for CB2 CB: Gilbert vs. K. Williams for CB3 NT: Taylor vs. Shelton OLB: Mingo vs. Orchard   Schedule predictions:  We could go between 5-11 and 8-8, in my opinion.  QB is just a giant question mark at the moment, though I have some hope that McCown behind a good O-line will get us some decent play for a few games.  Our schedule isn't easy - no major rebuilds from Cincy, Pittsburgh, or Baltimore, and we're playing the AFC and NFC West conferences.  Figure 2-4 or 3-3.  AFC has Denver and San Diego who are both very good, Kansas City who is competitive though not exceptional with Reid/Smith, and Oakland who might actually have their QB of the future in Carr.  All four teams could be potential losses or we could go 3-1.  NFC West is hard to predict - AZ may not have Palmer back, and you saw how that tanked their season last year.  St. Louis may or may not show up.  San Francisco is basically a dumpster fire at the moment and they may not get it put out in time, and Seattle will be tough.  We could go 1-3 or 3-1 here as well.   Jets have even bigger concerns at QB than we do, and I doubt Tennessee will get their team turned around in this offseason.  Probably 2-0 here.  Offensive scheme notes: We're still running ZBS which seemed to reinvigorate our running game last year.  Passing game will probably be a bit more West Coast than it was under Shanahan.  Defense: Same 3-4 hybrid we ran last year, but with a focus on stopping the run and getting more QB pressure by way of personnel adjustments."
Browns,3a2mw7,admiralkit,2,Tue Jun 16 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, we got Kevin O'Connell as our QB coach.  The guy that worked with Manziel and Mariota prepare for the draft."
Browns,3a2mw7,miked1be,0,Tue Jun 16 22:21:54 2015 UTC,"We also signed Randy Starks (DT, Miami) and Rob Housler (TE, Arizona).  And Ahtyba Rubin signed with Seattle.  Not a huge loss there but he should net us a compensatory pick (7th round, probably).  Maybe not huge moves but I expect both of those guys will be starters."

Browns,39zekc,Godszn,3,Tue Jun 16 03:29:22 2015 UTC,Funny but it makes sense.  It's a guaranteed fluff interview that won't go anywhere near the issues he's working through.  I guess they could get Mary Kay to agree to do an approved questions only interview but she could end up stumbling over herself and reverting back to her reality show-like reporting roots.

Browns,39xr9u,HawkeyeJosh,2,Mon Jun 15 19:18:20 2015 UTC,Russell Wilson makes the most sense of the 3. I'd take him in a heart beat. We are building pretty much the same team he has in Seattle with more Salary Cap space

Browns,39xr9u,AKlep,6,Mon Jun 15 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"Ha, I don't think anyone, including the author of that article, thinks Wilson is hitting the open market. I think it deals more with the fact that the Seahawks are reportedly ""10s of millions of dollars apart"" and not offering more than 4 years.   I understand top QBs don't hit FA, I understand that Seattle will lock him up, and I know that here is no chance at all; but goddamnit we'd be great with him in there."

Browns,39xr9u,JohnnyFire,4,Mon Jun 15 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"The Russell Wilson thing bothers me.  I take this like JR Smith and Iman Sumpert in the Finals. Does it suck that you keep going for it all and missing? Yes. But the only way to get something right is to fucking get something right.  Russell Wilson is a phenomenal player, but one who was drafted at the right time, put into the right system, and did the right things. There's nothing assured he can be that in Cleveland. We need to find our own Russell Wilson. I think next year's draft class at QB is strong enough to find just that (ALL ABOARD THE JARED GOFF HYPE TRAIN BROS) but the only way we're going to get a true franchise QB is to draft a true franchise QB. Yes, we've been trying for fucking ever, but it's about time we did this shit the right fucking way."

As you said, Rice doesn't fit our mantra as a team and T-West does show a bit of promise. I'd also be shocked if the Seahawks don't lock up Wilson long-term. I understand they're reportedly far from a deal, but it would be totally out-of-the-ordinary for a guy with his pedigree to hit the open market. That said, he grew up about 10 minutes from where I currently live and I'd love to have a local Richmond guy leading my beloved Brownies. It can't hurt to dream, right?"
Browns,39xr9u,GoofBoy,2,Mon Jun 15 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should have posited crazy speculation instead of crazy rumors.   Pure clickbait.  I really don't see anybody doing anything other than wild speculation in what you linked to.    Clayton was speculating on  Here are five teams that would make the most sense for him:  no way do I read that as a rumor, just him speculating.  The 5 landing spots for Rice article, just plain lazy as far as I am concerned.  If Cleveland General Manager Ray Farmer wants to take another risk on a player with off-field baggage, Rice would be a great fit and also address a position of need.  What part of this Browns offseason has given any indication the Browns have an appetite for an old player with off-field baggage?  Let me help, None.  The thought out response would be because of issues in Cleveland, they have become risk averse to character questions, check out the 2015 draft class as piece of evidence #1.  So, don't expect Ray Rice to end up there...  Russell Wilson, pure fantasy without a glimmer of anything saying otherwise.    No sources, no I have it on authority, no I heard, no rumors as far as I can tell.  Yet, I do agree that it is the stupid time of year."

Browns,39xr9u,hatmantc,2,Tue Jun 16 19:49:39 2015 UTC,Terrance West may be released[3] - This one seems the most crazy to me because he is only a 2nd year guy and shows promise and the article looks like my 8th grade cousin wrote it     i've said this before.. but Crowell as the feature back just scares me.. he just seems too raw for that responsibility
Browns,39xr9u,skallix,2,Mon Jun 15 19:54:16 2015 UTC,Crowell seems far too caw to not have that responsibility.
Browns,39xr9u,24rubikscube,2,Mon Jun 15 20:29:54 2015 UTC,I don't see him as a feature back either. I doubt the organization does either.

Browns,39xqj4,JohnnyFire,3,Mon Jun 15 18:59:52 2015 UTC,"I think people who say he is fat think he doesn't have that much skill, and the guys you listed have a ton. I don't think he will be that great but he will still help our defense."
Browns,39xqj4,ChairyCweed,2,Mon Jun 15 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I just needed some easy examples.  I'd be happy if he just became a consistent starter at this point."
Browns,39xqj4,JohnnyFire,2,Mon Jun 15 19:19:04 2015 UTC,I didn't want him in the first because I didn't think he would be a 3 down player but Farmer said he thinks he will be so we will see. At the very worst he eats up space.

Browns,39pyhy,java-dev,3,Sun Jun 14 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"Heh, very nice, I didn't even see that Twitter post.  I've seen DPN rage in the past about people not giving credit to them, so I figured I would take the extra 2 seconds to do it.  Ironically though, when the Browns beat the Saints this year, I submitted this album to this sub that night after the game. Lo and behold, three days later, look what was on DPN! http://www.dawgpoundnation.com/2014/09/17/youll-never-guess-many-experts-picked-browns-beat-saints/"
Browns,39pyhy,jcmck0320,0,Sun Jun 14 18:34:14 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. That's hilariously bad. Did he credit you at all? I'm all for more blogs and journalism, but that's something that pretty much gets me to write a site off.  Holy cow that's bad."
Browns,39ukho,jruoff32,7,Sun Jun 14 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"Shaw over McCown and Manziel? Yeah, that doesn't seem likely"
Browns,39ukho,Illinois_Jones,2,Mon Jun 15 01:25:18 2015 UTC,"The amount of people here who think Shaw could ever be a starter is way higher than it should be. You don't just ""fix his arm strength"" and ""put him in a system""."
Browns,39ukho,ChairyCweed,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"Shaw had the short hand of the stick professionally all year - he obviously wasn't trained to start this year, and was just thrown into it and held his own (as much as any of our starters at the end of the season...)  I think if he had some good guidance during OTAs and has some good preseason action, he could be very serviceable in a system that favors the run game."
Browns,39ukho,Kylekub,2,Mon Jun 15 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"I agree almost 100%. He could find success in our offensive system if our running game plays up to expectations. The only knock on Shaw, and I think most people would agree, is his arm strength. He's got a lot of heart, he prepares himself, he seems to be pretty smart and able to manage a game. But if he can't stretch the defense when they jam the box then we won't be able to do everything we need. Maybe he can bulk up and add a few yards to his deep passes. I don't think he'll start, but if he does I can say confidently that he is not the worst QB we've trotted onto the field."
Browns,39ukho,Future_Timer,0,Mon Jun 15 14:00:05 2015 UTC,"McCown and Manziel don't really qualify as ""under the radar""."
Browns,39ukho,Troop-the-Loop,6,Mon Jun 15 02:18:20 2015 UTC,The article says they think Shaw has a chance to be the starter. That's what I was talking about
Browns,39ukho,Illinois_Jones,0,Mon Jun 15 11:34:12 2015 UTC,"He certainly has a better chance to start this year then he did last year, yet he did start a game in 2014. I wouldn't be against him starting either, I thought he looked good for a rookie in his only start. Better than Manziel looked anyway."
Browns,39ukho,WorpeX,4,Mon Jun 15 12:18:03 2015 UTC,"He looked okay. He's vanilla and doesn't do anything special, which has been the knock on him since college."
Browns,39ukho,Illinois_Jones,5,Mon Jun 15 12:31:48 2015 UTC,Also dat noodle arm.
Browns,39ukho,Nightcinder,-1,Mon Jun 15 15:08:35 2015 UTC,"Well they were saying he's an ""under the radar"" player to watch. Not that he's better than McCown and Manziel."
Browns,39ukho,Troop-the-Loop,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"bottom line is that he may be the best option at quarterback for Cleveland.    It kind of did say that.  I understand that he's just filling up an article, but it isn't true."
Browns,39ukho,bearsdriving,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:36:55 2015 UTC,"There is no way Ifo Ekpre-Olomu plays this year. Even if he is technically healed, they are going to be 1000% more cautious with him due to the severity and nature of the injury."

Browns,39q7sy,Deadleggg,6,Sun Jun 14 01:44:07 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that seems like this story is just fluff? The Crow and West showed what they are made of last season. Of course the unproven rookie will be running harder right now, especially this early before the preseason"
Browns,39q7sy,mceppy,5,Sun Jun 14 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"He's gotta put on some weight to be considered a 3 down back imo.   He has a pretty small frame as well, hard to know how it'll hold up in the NFL going against guys twice his size."
Browns,39q7sy,740Buckeye,4,Sat Jun 13 18:59:18 2015 UTC,Wasnt Sproles a 3rd down back. Only way he would have to put on weight is if they intend in using him in short runs up the middle but not off the are going to swing him out the backfield
Browns,39q7sy,hatmantc,12,Sat Jun 13 20:02:57 2015 UTC,He said 3 down back not 3rd down back. Two different things.
Browns,39q7sy,cleveland_14,3,Sat Jun 13 20:28:43 2015 UTC,Yup.I see I totally misread that. Mostly due to word that he'd be a 3rd down guy

Browns,39q7sy,Kylekub,-3,Mon Jun 15 12:19:35 2015 UTC,"Even if they're swinging him out of the backfield, he's only like 5'9 and 190 lbs. You look at him and you can tell he's tiny,"
Browns,39q7sy,740Buckeye,5,Sat Jun 13 20:37:54 2015 UTC,"207 lbs at the combine.. Jamaal Charles, a 3 down back, is 199 or 200 lbs. Just saying."
Browns,39q7sy,nizule,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:21:32 2015 UTC,Jamaal Charles is also no stranger to getting injured.
Browns,39q7sy,740Buckeye,3,Sat Jun 13 21:40:38 2015 UTC,He has actually held up well over his career besides the knee injury in 2011.
Browns,39q7sy,ChairyCweed,2,Sat Jun 13 21:49:56 2015 UTC,Charles has had over 190 carries in 5 of his 7 years. He is pretty reliable.
Browns,39q7sy,Daviroth,7,Mon Jun 15 02:56:43 2015 UTC,"Considering how well the two different backs played last season (albeit a little inconsistently at times), this bodes well for the team. Hopefully Manziel, and/or the guy I don't really want to play, can hold up their end of the deal. Maybe we'll do better than expected?"
Browns,39q7sy,okaythisisit,2,Sat Jun 13 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"I think maybe just for this year, the RB duo will still be Terrance West and the Crow, and he'll be used primarily on special teams, and maybe certain 3rd down situations."
Browns,39q7sy,Matthew345,5,Sat Jun 13 22:50:09 2015 UTC,Why come off the bench for the year?  Crow and West were rookies last year and both produced early and often.
Browns,39q7sy,Resident_Wizard,3,Sun Jun 14 02:58:25 2015 UTC,I think he may have a more limited role on O this year simply because he can make a bigger impact for the team on special teams.

Browns,39q7sy,Nightcinder,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:22:43 2015 UTC,It's a little early to anoint anybody anything. They haven't even practiced in full pads yet.
Browns,39q7sy,batardo,2,Sun Jun 14 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Crow and West are both pretty powerful. Their strength is in running in pads while Johnson's is in running without them."

Browns,39p1wr,ccavana3,6,Sat Jun 13 11:05:39 2015 UTC,"He has been paying every position on the line with 1s and 2s, read that he is doing great and likely  will start on the right,  but is very very versatile"
Browns,39p1wr,MadMardiganWaaait,5,Sat Jun 13 13:49:54 2015 UTC,"Here's a bigger question: does anyone think Bitonio could push Schwartz for the RT job? Right now we have three (hypothetically) great guards. I know the concept of ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" comes into play here, but a line with Thomas, Erving, Mack, Greco, and Bitonio sounds like it could be really formidable.  The only reason I bring this up is because I know Bitonio struggled less as a tackle than Erving did."
Browns,39p1wr,Chiranthodendron,2,Sat Jun 13 15:24:40 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, why did you bump Bitonio to RT instead of Erving?"
Browns,39p1wr,LiterallyHitner31,3,Sat Jun 13 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"My guess Bitonio has a year's worth of experience and may transition easier, while Erving gains his experience starting at guard   Edit: just read Pluto's article, left guard is the only position on the line they haven't put Erving into, so it sounds like that's Bitonio's spot this year"
Browns,39p1wr,iliekdrugs,4,Sat Jun 13 22:24:40 2015 UTC,He was one of the best LG last year. No need to fix what isn't broken.
Browns,39p1wr,nizule,2,Sun Jun 14 09:01:36 2015 UTC,You don't move Bitonio IMHO.  He was ranked as a top 5 guard in his ROOKIE season!  Why would you displace him just because we are a little weak somewhere else.  Let him develop between Thomas and Mack.  We will probably have the best left side O-line in the league this year and I see zero reason to mess with that.
Browns,39p1wr,shicken684,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:50:56 2015 UTC,I'd be disappointed if he couldn't...Schwartz is bad with anyone that moves faster than a tortoise.
Browns,39p1wr,740Buckeye,8,Sat Jun 13 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know – I mean, Schwartz is not great by a longshot, but I'm not sure I'd call him actively bad. He's no Oniel Cousins, that's for sure."
Browns,39p1wr,batardo,3,Sat Jun 13 17:52:06 2015 UTC,"He's slightly above average, which fortunately brings down the overall quality of the line"
Browns,39p1wr,iliekdrugs,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:23:35 2015 UTC,"I would just say average, not above it, but yeah"
Browns,39p1wr,RedChocobo2,2,Mon Jun 15 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"Oniel Cousins   I have never seen a player so thoroughly get his ass kicked in the NFL   Even the fill-ins for Mack seemed better (or maybe, less bad)"
Browns,39p1wr,Abiv23,4,Tue Jun 16 21:07:05 2015 UTC,He can definitely jump in to play center if need be. He's expected to be lined up at RG. He can even play tackle if something happens there.
Browns,39p1wr,24rubikscube,3,Sat Jun 13 13:02:42 2015 UTC,"Woof. A line with three firsts and two seconds. No matter what that gives massive versatility to the line. Greco going back in at RG and Cam moving to center is actually a viable option, as well as Greco actually taking reps at center and learning the position."
Browns,39p1wr,Chiranthodendron,2,Sat Jun 13 15:21:03 2015 UTC,Thing is greco wasn't really bad at center for the short time he played last year. Now his replacement at right guard was another story alltogether.
Browns,39n5cd,shabouwcaw,22,Fri Jun 12 22:48:31 2015 UTC,Now get to work on his long term deal!!!
Browns,39n5cd,battle_squid,17,Fri Jun 12 22:54:33 2015 UTC,"Let's see what he can do after that injury.  Make an offer that reflects how well he will play, not how well he has played."
Browns,39n5cd,Brokewood,6,Sat Jun 13 01:10:57 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Glad he signed the tender, but also glad that the FO is taking a wait and see approach to signing him long term.  He could be fine, or he could be Gary Baxter."
Browns,39n5cd,topper_mango,4,Sat Jun 13 01:23:08 2015 UTC,I think you're underselling the severity of Gipson's injury when you call a Grade 3 rupture of his MCL and a sprained PCL a 'freaking sprain in his knee'.
Browns,39n5cd,topper_mango,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"Was anyone acting like it was a career threatening injury?  The potential is there for it to be career ending, but the more likely outcome is either that he's fine or that he's lost a step.  That we don't know which it is begs caution when discussing the top tier contract he wants."
Browns,39n5cd,topper_mango,2,Sat Jun 13 15:45:26 2015 UTC,"'Potentially'.   If you don't know, you don't pay.  The Browns are handling this the right way.  You don't throw top money at an injured player this year to get him to stay next year."
Browns,39n5cd,topper_mango,8,Sat Jun 13 15:53:34 2015 UTC,Now he can get them reps in and make this secondary even more bad ass.
Browns,39n5cd,KegmanZulu,15,Sat Jun 13 16:06:27 2015 UTC,Thank god. We need to let this ride and see how his injury affects him. I like tashaun but he only deserves what he's worth.
Browns,39n5cd,kpyle,6,Sat Jun 13 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, but don't expect him to give us the hometown discount next year.  We'll have to pay him top dollar for not believing in him"
Browns,39n5cd,java-dev,4,Sat Jun 13 16:30:18 2015 UTC,Just like no other team believed in him as well? No one offered him a contract at all. He's not stupid.
Browns,39n5cd,Paintballreturns,2,Sat Jun 13 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"No other team offered, because they would ahve to pay AND give us a pick, which obviously costs way more than just paying him."
Browns,39n5cd,java-dev,3,Fri Jun 12 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"A second round pick is good enough for a pro bowl safety if the team actually believed he was one already, no?"
Browns,39n5cd,Paintballreturns,3,Fri Jun 12 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"It's a HUGE risk to pay a lot of money and give up a 2nd rounder for a guy coming of his injury, especially since it was during his breakout year.  Browns had the ability to match the contract, so they would need to out bid us, PLUS lose a 2nd."
Browns,39n5cd,Wookie_Goldberg,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:47:47 2015 UTC,"If you're one of the 31 other teams, why give up money AND a pick when you can wait a year and just give him the money?"
Browns,39n5cd,eleven21,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"Ummm, because you'll get him for an extra year in his ""prime"" AND you won't have to out bid 30 other teams for his services?  It should be painfully clear to everyone here-----A 2nd round pick for a top 5/10 safety is ""chump change"". Multiple teams would have jumped all over this if he was 100% healthy.

Browns,39n5cd,eleven21,4,Sat Jun 13 00:46:09 2015 UTC,I am just worried about the knee. It'd be stupid to pay him lots now then find out he has lost a step. We should know by preseason what he's worth. I hope he is a boss and gets paid plenty.
Browns,39n5cd,kpyle,0,Sat Jun 13 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"Or we pay him fair market value this year, and he stays with us forever, or next year we have to overpay and he can still get hurt anyways."
Browns,39n5cd,java-dev,4,Sat Jun 13 16:31:44 2015 UTC,"The guy tore both his PCL and MCL... If we're being objective not many players return to form after such an injury. Often players just never fully recover or develop arthritis from the injury, which limits both agility and speed. It's often an injury that is easily re aggravated. I have a similar injury, and while I probably never had the top notch medical treatment Gip does, I can say my knee has never been the same since.  The treatment for this type of injury has gotten better and more reliable the last few years, but it's hardly a sure thing. If the injury didn't happen Gipson would have probably been able to get a deal done with another team, but as it stands he's going to have to prove he can stay healthy."
Browns,39n5cd,Trilljoy,0,Sat Jun 13 18:53:29 2015 UTC,Didnt we just pay a guy comign off a PCL?
Browns,39n5cd,java-dev,4,Sat Jun 13 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"That was 2 years ago and was a sprain not a tear which didn't require surgery. Hartline also isn't getting top dollar. We're still paying Gip, you realize? We're literally quadrupling his pay with the tender."
Browns,39n5cd,Trilljoy,0,Sat Jun 13 00:03:25 2015 UTC,You know a sprain is literally a different word than tear and gipson didn't require surgery either?  And he was one of the best safeties in the league and made a probowl? what more do you want him to do?
Browns,39n5cd,java-dev,3,Sat Jun 13 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"I never said Gip required surgery, but I can see how you think I implied it. Still, it was a grade 3 tear of the MCL, pretty serious. His rehab is designed to strengthen and repair the ligament, but like I said, nothing is guaranteed. It all comes down to how it heals, and how his body repairs. It's not a perfect science, this has been a career effecting injury for so many others in the past.  It's not about what I want him to do. It's about the team protecting itself from committing money to a player who won't see the field. You can talk cap room all you like, bad spending is bad spending no matter how much money you have. It's not something good organizations do often.   I've said before, the NFL contract system is setup in a manner that players get paid for past performance. Gipson is still young yet, and relatively unproven (he's certainly promising). The tender system is collectively bargained and is a process that happens across the league. We're hardly the only team utilizing it. Gip looked to have a breakout year last year, but that isn't a reason for a large contract. We've seen many flashes in the pan here in Cleveland."
Browns,39n5cd,Trilljoy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:32:57 2015 UTC,"Breakout year? the year before he was great too. He just had more ints.  he literally is everything you want in a safety, and he's way better than any of these other guys on our roster that even have a modicum of hype.    Yes, he had an injury.  But PCL tears that don't require surgery are almost always fine to come back to.  hell http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/90514-treatment  85% of people return to their sport with the feeling that their knee is just as good.    it sounds like a chincey organization who doesn't like paying players and trying to undercut (Mack, Skrine, etc) is just doing the same thing here."

Or we pay him fair market value this year, and he stays with us forever, or next year we have to overpay and he can still get hurt anyways.  I have a hard time believing that they wouldn't have leaked out through Mary Kay if he was turning down big money   ""Fair market value"" is ""big money"", but that's NOT ""overpay[ing]""?"
Browns,39n5cd,TopHatAbobo,0,Wed Jun 17 19:24:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe your opinion of ""fair market value"" is different from the team's.  As stated this is a guy that's coming off a big injury that wasn't the fastest to begin with.  He played smart last season and made good plays but they need to see that he can still perform consistently.  Offering big money could end up blowing up in their faces."
Browns,39n5cd,miked1be,2,Sat Jun 13 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"Hometown discount is pretty much bullshit anyway.  He's coming off injury in a breakout year,  he has to prove himself.  If he feels the Browns need to overpay him to retain him under those circumstances then he didn't want to stay anyway.  Anything else is a moot point."

Browns,39l55s,740Buckeye,2,Tue Jun 16 17:43:51 2015 UTC,Since Tate was the one let go I'm guessing they felt that his removal would resolve the issue the quickest instead of removing West from the situation. Maybe they hoped that West was young and would grow out of it as opposed to Tate who was older and more entrenched in his behavior.    There were issues in the beginning of the season with RBs not finding a groove and I believe it was Tate that was complaining that they were splitting reps too much for him to get into a good groove in the running game.  Sounds like it was more of an issue of him worrying too much about what West was doing instead of his own performance or he was just making excuses and just trying to pressure the coaching staff into giving him reps instead of West.
Browns,39l55s,KevinMack25,5,Fri Jun 12 14:26:45 2015 UTC,"Of course it would resolve the issue the quickest, if the report is true Tate had an entitlement mentality with NONE of the stats to back it up.

Also, he may not have put up the same numbers as our current guys while on our team as opposed to the Vikings, we don't know.  Eh, we were able to fill front 7 pretty effectively in the draft so the loss of Rubin (who's dropped off) and Sheard (who didn't really fit the system) will probably (if the guys we got pay off) be a non factor.  Skrine is good and athletic but not really an outside corner, we replaced him with a proven vet that is while our young guys develop.  Gipson can still be signed but he's coming off of an injury and is in a prove it year, because of this the FO is probably wary of signing him to a big deal.  Mack has said he wants to see how the season plays out before going for a longer deal so I don't know how you expect us to be able to sign him before he wants to be.   Cameron is the only loss that might hurt but he was out so much due to concussions I'm not sure how much he would have played anyway.  Also, from the sounds of things he didn't really want to return to Cleveland anyway."
Browns,39kojz,miked1be,3,Fri Jun 12 12:52:29 2015 UTC,"Adding some veteran hands has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on resigning Mack or Gipson, get that idea out of your head. Yeah, Johnson worked out in Minnesota. UDFAs get cut absolutely all the time and every now and then they go somewhere else and do reasonably well. Just bad luck. It wasn't the wrong thing to do at the time.   Furthermore, his contract is so small it would have no influence whatsoever on our overall cap situation, not sure where you're even getting that from. Cameron didn't want to be here, Rubin was terrible last season, and Skrine wanted way too much money and was upgraded with Tramon. Bowe and Hartline might not be megastars but they'll do fine and have plenty of veteran advice to give to young QBs and WRs."
Browns,39kojz,Marzman315,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:59:12 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about things we could have done with the money we used on hartline, bowe and housler, which doesn't amount to much (around 12m) but would be enough to entice FAs at other positions. I expect bowe and hartline to play well. Unless we broke the bank this offseason our passing offense was going to continue to be below average."
Browns,39kojz,Marzman315,2,Fri Jun 12 13:21:00 2015 UTC,"But it's a pretty moot point because we're spending comparatively very little on those guys (McCown too) so with our huge cap space we can afford these guys and extend our younger stars. Farmer is big on building through the draft, Bowe and Hartline and to a lesser extent Housler are temporary solutions until we draft our hand picked guys."
Browns,39kojz,TrueSol,3,Fri Jun 12 14:26:26 2015 UTC,Yes. He's a quality receiver and would be anywhere. He just needed time to recover. Weirdest part is that we kept him through the summer while he was injured and then gave up on him so quickly. He would be very helpful here.
Browns,39kojz,Mustang1718,2,Sat Jun 13 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exactly when it was, but Charles had a torn ACL at some point. I believe we signed him from the Packers practice squad before finding that out. Those take quite a bit of time to recover from, so depending on when it actually happened, it might not have been worth stashing him on the roster. You also want players who can contribute right away more than you want to save project players.  This sounds a little bit hypocritical when we have done such things with Desir last year and Ekpre-Olomu at the CB spot this year. I would argue that you don't make as many substitutions on defense and your starters are out there almost 100% of the time. There is also the fact that Pettine is a defensive specialist and might put in word to farmer to carry a couple extra guys on the defensive side as he can evaluate their talent a little bit better."
Browns,39kojz,Coniuratos,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:03:06 2015 UTC,But they did stash him on the roster throughout the ACL injury in 2013. It was only after he was back on the field in 2014 that he got cut.
Browns,39kojz,workPRODUCTIVITY-0,2,Sat Jun 13 12:24:24 2015 UTC,No mistake. Hindsight.  Better fit for Vikings. Like someone already said... he had an injury...  Then he was to skinny and could not hold a block. Then he caught a case of the braylon edwards and dropped every slant and go route we threw at him in preseason. Then came Taylor Gabriel. And therefore we let a three yr project drafted by a different gmail for a different offense go.

Browns,39kojz,bearsdriving,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"Also I didn't think of this when I read the Tim wright post on r/nfl but I wonder if he'd be better than housler. I like barnidge and dray so I'm not worried about TE. Wright might be a faster pass catcher option. I guess we would've tried to get Gresham if it was something we wanted to spend on. Although wright is probably cheaper than Gresham, clay or Jordan."
Browns,39kojz,FunkyPoodle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:01:23 2015 UTC,"Wright is a better pass blocker, run blocker, and receiving threat that Barnridge, Dray, and Housler. He is is also much cheaper than any of them at $0.6M this year compared to Houseler at $1.7M, Dray at $1.8M, or Barnridge at $1.2M.    If he is available, he is totally worth it if we can get him."

Browns,39kyiq,got_nabors,8,Fri Jun 12 13:29:25 2015 UTC,"Evan Mathis would be great for any team as he's been a top guard since 2011 and is arguably the best G in the league.  That said, he wants top 5 money ($8M area), we may have the money but we don't need a guard and can spend that money somewhere else (hopefully). If Bowie and Erving measure up like they should we won't really need him next year. I would be ecstatic if he came, but it would rather see play makers come in with that type of money."
Browns,39kyiq,bearsdriving,4,Fri Jun 12 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"To me, taking him no and paying the money is well worth the Browns are trying to do for the long run.  It would completely solidify the RG position while Cameron Erving can grow into the RT position, or take over for Mack if he decides to leave.  Bringing in Mathis now and signing him for a couple years just gives the Browns absolute depth on the line for a few years to come.  Making absolutely sure that we don't need to count on Bowie to come into form, just in case."
Browns,39kyiq,fuckingbrowns,2,Fri Jun 12 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think Erving is all that formidable in space. He's an adequate tackle, but really shines when playing inside."
Browns,39kyiq,Mungina,5,Sat Jun 13 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"i mean id love to have him but there are other teams with bigger needs at guard that are in a better position to win now (denver, seattle, giants).    frankly, i will be surprised if he doesn't get picked up by denver or seattle.  the guy is an absolute mauler at the end of his career, if i was him there is no way in hell I'd sign with a team like the browns that are in no position to win a championship NOW when teams that need a guard are out there and on the cusp."
Browns,39kyiq,bearsdriving,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:32:53 2015 UTC,"Curious about the championship thing since I've seen it on /r/browns twice now. I know he was upset about money for a few years and just wanted to make more money, never heard about the winning team thing."
Browns,39kyiq,miked1be,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of guys like that will want more money from their current team, especially if they don't have a huge amount of faith in the team winning a championship so they'll take compensation for not winning a ring.  When they go up for FA though a lot of them will head off to the best team that gives them a decent contract, some do go for money first and foremost though."
Browns,39kyiq,bearsdriving,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:25:01 2015 UTC,"He was making good money ($5.1M a year) but has been holding out for more money the last two years. He said he is looking for top 5 Guard money, which is about $7M a year.   It makes sense that he wants to win one and I'm not sure how much of the sitting out OTAs and complain about costs are from him or his agent, but it smells of making the money before retiring more than getting the ring."

Browns,39geg5,bearsdriving,3,Thu Jun 11 15:43:27 2015 UTC,"Curious to get the blocking thing. He grades out pretty decently, a middle of the pack blocker who would be an advantage over anyone besides maybe Barnridge on our team.  He is also more of an offensive threat that any of our TEs.  Here is PFF's ratings on each person:   Tim Write last year.  These numbers may be skewed because Brady, but he also had similar numbers with Tampa the year before with 54 receptions, 574 yds, and 5 TDs in only 626 snaps (roughly 55-65% of the snaps). Cleveland last year, Cameron's offense really distracted most critics from his blocking. Our new guy Housler, he definitely doesn't look like much of an upgrade over anyone. The hope with him is that Arizona wasn't using him right.   Here is just a quick summary of last year.  With Flip wanting a big sure handed TE, Wright may be an option. I'd love to at least check him out.     Name Snaps Overall Pass Pass Block Run Block Targets Rec. Yds TDs    Barney 366 0.3 -.7 -.1 1.1 24 13 156 0   Dray 612 -6.4 -0.1 1.9 -7.0 27 17 242 1   Housler 327 -8.2 -.3 -1.4 -6.6 14 9 129 0   Wright 357 -.1 -.2 0.5 -.5 32 26 259 6"

I find basketball boring to watch.  I have been watching (somewhat) the Finals and rooting for the Cavs, just because they are Cleveland.  I do not really consider myself a ""bandwagoner"" just because whether they win or lose, I still won't follow what they do 5 minutes after this championship.  I don't buy their gear or go to their games, I just applaud their accomplishment and hope for continued success.  To give an idea of how much I don't follow NBA, a couple weeks ago I was playing trivia at a bar and they asked for the 4 teams left in the playoffs.  1 of the teams I guessed was the Seattle Supersonics, I did not know they moved."

Browns,39aw77,bearsdriving,2,Wed Jun 10 18:11:00 2015 UTC,"Dallas Cowboys   2014 Ranking: 18  Top five players: Dez Bryant, Greg Hardy, Orlando Scandrick, Tyron Smith, Tony Romo  Starters who should be upgraded: Nick Hayden, Morris Claiborne, Anthony Hitchens, J.J. Wilcox, Terrance Williams, Tyler Clutts, Joseph Randle  Analysis: The Cowboys have one of the league's best offenses, but some big question marks on defense. The offensive line might be even better this season after last year's dominant campaign, which is why Dallas was fine moving on from DeMarco Murray. Randle averaged 6.7 yards per carry last season and 4.2 yards per carry after contact on 51 carries, and the team is banking on him being very productive behind that blocking.  The defense overachieved a year ago, and the D-line looks very thin entering 2015. The secondary is an issue, while the linebacker corps will get a huge boost if Sean Lee can return healthy.   Pittsburgh Steelers   2014 Ranking: 27  Top five players: Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown, Le'Veon Bell, Kelvin Beachum, Cameron Heyward  Starters who should be upgraded: Cortez Allen, Stephon Tuitt  Analysis: A career year for Roethlisberger coincided with Brown's emergence as possibly the league's best wide receiver and Bell's development into one of its top all-around running backs. That offensive trio will likely dictate the Steelers' fate in 2015, but their strong offensive line is an important factor as well.  The other side of the ball is where the questions lie; of particular concern is Pittsburgh's lack of a productive edge rush. Perhaps first-round rookie Bud Dupree will provide a jolt, but right now defensive lineman Heyward is the defense's only true impact player.   Indianapolis Colts   2014 Ranking: 12  Top five players: Vontae Davis, Andrew Luck, T.Y. Hilton, Robert Mathis, Dwayne Allen  Starters who should be upgraded: Khaled Holmes, Todd Herremans, Gosder Cherilus, Greg Toler, Kendall Langford, Arthur Jones, D'Qwell Jackson  Analysis: Much like the Packers, the Colts receive a boost for being in great shape at the most critical position in the game. Luck may not be quite as good as the hype surrounding him most of the time -- he was only PFF's ninth-ranked quarterback in 2014 -- but he has elite highs and as much raw ability as any passer in the game. Running back Frank Gore and wide receiver Andre Johnson aren't long-term solutions, but both should represent immediate upgrades. There are issues on the O-line, where Anthony Castonzo is the only one of the starting five to rank above average.  The defense remains a work in progress, but has one elite player at a critical position -- the hugely underrated Davis. Teams throwing his way in 2014 had a passer rating of just 38.8, the lowest mark in the league.   Cleveland Browns   2014 Ranking: 24  Top five players: Joe Thomas, Joel Bitonio, Alex Mack, Donte Whitner, Karlos Dansby  Starters who should be upgraded: Craig Robertson, Gary Barnidge, Rob Housler, Josh McCown, Terrance West  Analysis: The Browns have a good roster overall, but they are brought down in these rankings because they are in quarterback purgatory -- with no end in sight. Johnny Manziel was a disaster as a rookie, making McCown the team's new beacon of hope. The Browns are banking on the return of McCown's magical 2013 season with the Bears, which is looking more and more like a fluke.  Cleveland's offensive line and defense are in very good shape, but the skill positions have become a question mark with the losses of Jordan Cameron to free agency and Josh Gordon to suspension.   Buffalo Bills   2014 Ranking: 20  Top five players: Marcell Dareus, Kyle Williams, LeSean McCoy, Mario Williams, Jerry Hughes  Starters who should be upgraded: Jarius Wynn, Matt Cassel  Analysis: Under the direction of Rex Ryan, the Bills should have one of the best defenses in the NFL. Their problem is at quarterback, where EJ Manuel, Tyrod Taylor and Cassel are locked in a competition that won't produce an above-average starter. Last year Manuel's passer rating under pressure was 45.5, and that somehow beat Cassel by over 20 points.  McCoy brings a top-level talent to a backfield that was already impressive, and an improved Sammy Watkins in his second season could make him one of the best wide receivers in the league. The concern outside of the quarterback position is along the right side of the offensive line.   Carolina Panthers   2014 Ranking: 22  Top five players: Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis, Charles Johnson, Kawann Short, Greg Olsen  Starters who should be upgraded: Roman Harper, Michael Oher  Analysis: The prospect of heading into another season with no real answer at offensive tackle must be a scary one for Cam Newton. The last time Oher started at left tackle, he allowed 11 sacks on the year, and over the past four seasons he has averaged 8.75 sacks allowed. The offensive line looks weak overall, with only Ryan Kalil at center ranking above average, but the Panthers are at least loading up with weapons for Newton at receiver.  The defense again has potential to be a very good unit, but there is a notable hole at edge rusher following the loss of Greg Hardy. Carolina's safeties aren't great, either.   San Francisco 49ers   2014 Ranking: 2  Top five players: NaVorro Bowman, Joe Staley, Aldon Smith, Anquan Boldin, Bruce Miller  Starters who should be upgraded: Erik Pears, Darnell Dockett, Shareece Wright, Michael Wilhoite  Analysis: The Niners' roster was already on the decline, and then they lost a lot of talent to retirements this offseason, but the cupboard is not completely bare. Bowman returns to lead the defense alongside Smith, who's still one of the league's best edge players.  On offense, Colin Kaepernick has not developed as smoothly as the 49ers would have liked after he burst onto the scene in 2012. He has a new deep threat in Torrey Smith to go with a reliable possession receiver in Boldin. The offensive line has holes, but left tackle Staley is still at the top of his game, while center Daniel Kilgore was a pleasant surprise last year.   San Diego Chargers   2014 Ranking: 14  Top five players: Eric Weddle, Philip Rivers, Brandon Flowers, Orlando Franklin, Keenan Allen  Starters who should be upgraded: D.J. Fluker, Kendall Reyes, Sean Lissemore, Tourek Williams, Jimmy Wilson, Donald Butler  Analysis: The Chargers will always be in the playoff mix with Rivers at the helm, as he continues to play at a high level heading into his 12th season. The offensive line got a nice addition in Franklin, who will form one of the best run-blocking left sides in the league alongside King Dunlap. The wide receiver unit looks strong with Allen, Malcom Floyd and Stevie Johnson, while tight end Ladarius Green is poised to finally take the reins from Antonio Gates.  The defense features all of its best players in the secondary, led by safety Weddle and cornerbacks Jason Verrett and Flowers. The front seven is a concern, however. The Chargers don't have an edge rusher who can get consistent pressure, and the defensive line has been destroyed in the running game the past two seasons.   Kansas City Chiefs   2014 Ranking: 10  Top five players: Justin Houston, Dontari Poe, Jamaal Charles, Derrick Johnson, Travis Kelce  Starters who should be upgraded: James-Michael Johnson, Eric Fisher, Zach Fulton, Donald Stephenson, Jason Avant,  Analysis: This is another team with major offensive line concerns. The Chiefs really need former No. 1 overall pick Fisher to take a step forward at left tackle, and if Mitch Morse were to work out at center as a rookie, that would help them out a lot, too. Until then, the offense is reliant on Charles, Kelce, Jeremy Maclin and a lot of smoke and mirrors from Andy Reid.  The defense is a different story, with good overall talent and a true force coming off the edge in the form of Houston."
Browns,39aw77,batardo,2,Wed Jun 10 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"Oakland Raiders   2014 Ranking: 28  Top five players: Khalil Mack, Dan Williams, Donald Penn, Gabe Jackson, Rodney Hudson  Starters who should be upgraded: Khalif Barnes, Mychal Rivera, Derek Carr, Curtis Lofton  Analysis: The Raiders were surprisingly solid on the offensive line last season, particularly in pass protection. First-round rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper should be an immediate upgrade to what was a below-average receiving corps in 2014. Quarterback Carr received heaps of praise in some circles for his rookie season, but he still has ways to go to prove he's the answer in Oakland.  The defensive side of the ball is led by second-year linebacker Mack, who proved a dominant force against the run as a rookie. He can still improve as a pass-rusher, and if that part of his game comes around, he'll be a Pro Bowler for years to come. Adding nose tackle Williams in free agency should help the run defense.   Tampa Bay Buccaneers   2014 Ranking: 17  Top five players: Gerald McCoy, Lavonte David, Mike Evans, Vincent Jackson, Demar Dotson  Starters who should be upgraded: Louis Murphy, Chris Conte, Johnthan Banks, Bruce Carter, Clinton McDonald  Analysis: McCoy and David are elite defensive talents, but unfortunately for the Bucs, they don't have much around them. Players like Danny Lansanah and Henry Melton have the ability to change that, but there are still major holes at defensive end, nose tackle and safety.  No. 1 overall pick Jameis Winston is the headline addition to the offense, but the Bucs are also slated to start rookies at left tackle and right guard, leaving some uncertainty around the level of protection Winston will get in Year 1.   Tennessee Titans   2014 Ranking: 21  Top five players: Jurrell Casey, Derrick Morgan, Kendall Wright, Delanie Walker, Jason McCourty  Starters who should be upgraded: Justin Hunter, Brian Schwenke, Byron Stingily, Coty Sensabaugh, Michael Griffin  Analysis: Few teams are leaning on rookies as much as the Titans heading into 2015. Quarterback Marcus Mariota obviously has the potential to transform the offense, but he's an unknown quantity at this point, and fellow rookie wide receivers Dorial Green-Beckham and Tre McBride, and running back David Cobb, all figure to play big roles out of necessity.  Casey is the only star on defense, but he does have several good players alongside him, especially if Brian Orakpo can stay healthy. Heading into his third season, the Titans need a big step forward from cornerback Blidi Wreh-Wilson, who allowed six touchdowns last season and a passer rating of 110.8 when targeted.   Atlanta Falcons   2014 Ranking: 30  Top five players: Julio Jones, Desmond Trufant, Matt Ryan, Jon Asamoah, Ryan Schraeder  Starters who should be upgraded: Tyson Jackson, Charles Godfrey, Jake Matthews, Patrick DiMarco  Analysis: Ryan is one of the more underrated quarterbacks in the league, but he has shown he needs help for the Falcons to be a winning team. The state of their offensive line will once again be a concern, with Matthews in particular needing to take a huge step forward after an ugly rookie season (he allowed seven sacks and 51 total pressures).  Trufant is on the cusp of greatness at cornerback, looking primed to take the next step into the Darrelle Revis/Richard Sherman category, but there's a worrying lack of quality elsewhere on the roster -- particularly on defense.   Jacksonville Jaguars   2014 Ranking: 32  Top five players: Brandon Linder, Julius Thomas, Sen'Derrick Marks, Jared Odrick, Ryan Davis  Starters who should be upgraded: Roy Miller, Chris Clemons, Paul Posluszny, Allen Hurns, Marqise Lee, Luke Joeckel  Analysis: The Jaguars have some good players, including Linder, Marks, Odrick and Thomas. Here's the problem: Two of those four came over in free agency and have yet to play a down for the team, and only Linder makes it into the high-quality grading bracket.  The key pieces that were supposed to turn the franchise around -- Joeckel, Blake Bortles and Johnathan Cyprien in particular -- have all fallen well short of expectations thus far. In Bortles' case, the team at least knew he would be a long-term project and never intended to start him as a rookie, but the signs were not good in his first year. He will need to make a major leap forward as a sophomore to help the team out."

Those injuries still happened and all those players (A. Bryant, P. Taylor, J. Hughes, D. Bryant, B. Winn, I. Kitchen) have some questions to answer on the field because of them. On top of that, Shelton could be 2014-A. Rubin all over again. I think it's unlikely that Shelton plays that bad, but as we saw last year, things can go downhill real quick.realrealrealquick"

Browns,392eei,Xibyn,2,Mon Jun 8 19:30:06 2015 UTC,"I was very comfortable with Lanning at punter, so this move surprised me.  After researching Andy Lee, I like the move a lot more now.  According to his Wikipedia page, he set the record for net average in 2011 (44.0 net yards per punt) and was 3rd all-time that same year in gross average (50.9 yards per punt).  The career statistics used in the above article make it seem like both punters were basically the same, but you have to figure that over the course of a decade, there may have been 50 punters between Lanning and Lee's 1.2 yard difference.  I like to think of average punt yards like golf strokes - one or two seem like nothing, but it's huge when you're a pro - It can be the difference between a being champion and being tied for 9th place.  Personally, I think Lee is a major upgrade - not just for his leg, but for his leadership.  He's a two-time All Pro.  My only concern now is why SF was willing to trade him so cheap?  edit: grammar"
Browns,392eei,wayback72,3,Tue Jun 9 03:09:54 2015 UTC,"The reason they traded him for so cheap was a mixture of his high salary cap, their drafting of a punter in the fifth round, and just overall incompetence by their front office in what has been the worst offseason maybe of all time for the 49ers."

Browns,391orq,DawgsChalkTalk,3,Mon Jun 8 16:37:37 2015 UTC,You know who has a lot of experience running these plays?  Johnny Manziel.
Browns,391orq,TwoAngryFigs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:39:32 2015 UTC,"Aside from clickwhoring, I enjoyed this article. I do agree this will be an increasing trend we will see as the NFL evolves from year to year."
Browns,391orq,rsipp512,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:53:18 2015 UTC,"I'm very curious as to what in Sam Hell Flip is actually going to run. Allegedly, they're keeping the Zone Blocking Scheme. He also talks about keeping what makes Johnny unique, so I wonder if we're going to see more forced Zone Read Option, despite Johnny's inglorious NFL history with it so far."
Browns,391orq,Brokewood,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:43:47 2015 UTC,I don't know why anyone thinks johnny is a zone read QB. Sure he has decent speed and elusiveness but he isn't ridiculous. He is closer to a west coast QB than anything else.
Browns,391orq,kpyle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:36:50 2015 UTC,Manziel is a pocket QB that makes plays when the play breaks down. He is not a read option QB despite what Shanahan called for him to run.
Browns,391orq,maxpowerway,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:23:12 2015 UTC,You'll get zero argument form me. I think Shanahan just wanted to recycle his old RG3 playbook.

Browns,390ose,grinny588,8,Mon Jun 8 15:31:57 2015 UTC,By far the best part about this trade! Getting a 3 time pro bowler and having the option to cut him at any point if things aren't working out without any dead money is just about as perfect as it could get

Browns,38tj1w,Gryzvwald,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:42:27 2015 UTC,I understand where you are coming from but you should look at the context of the thread. This is Lanning giving our city no matter where we reside now some love for all the support we've given him. Not the best place to berate him whether it is deserved or not. Like Putuinurplace said the trade thread would be more appropriate.
Browns,38tcd8,JohnnyFire,59,Sat Jun 6 17:19:38 2015 UTC,Sp-spencer? 😢
Browns,38tcd8,blackedout,41,Sat Jun 6 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"I thought our problem was our kicker? Didn't Spence do an alright job?   Edit: Also, wrong 49ers kicker."
Browns,38tcd8,Stowcenter93,13,Sat Jun 6 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"Alright is actually a very accurate description of how Lanning did.  He didn't fuck up much, but his punting was pretty average beyond that.  Lots of times we'd see a drive stall out and we'd get 45 yards from him, which doesn't compensate for our offensive struggles when their offense could move the ball more than ours.  Even on short punts, Lanning  would get within the 15-20 yard lines but rarely would put it inside the 10.  He's the kind of player you don't get rid of unless you get someone better, which is what we have probably done with picking up SF's old punter."
Browns,38tcd8,admiralkit,25,Sat Jun 6 20:31:26 2015 UTC,Fuck yea!!!!  Although that's not the 49er kicker we want.

Browns,38tcd8,Mackin24,23,Sat Jun 6 17:23:03 2015 UTC,Lee has a bit of a stronger leg plus he's proven his ability. Seems marginal at best as an improvement...not really worried about trading 7th round picks since we got like 62 rookies this year
Browns,38tcd8,WaffylesYay,3,Sat Jun 6 17:37:04 2015 UTC,Is it a money thing?
Browns,38tcd8,Mackin24,6,Sat Jun 6 17:37:45 2015 UTC,Definitely not a money thing. Lee is signed to a deal. Lanning is making little to nothing on a non guarantee which is probably why they have no issue doing this move. They will just cut him.
Browns,38tcd8,evdarr,12,Sat Jun 6 17:42:52 2015 UTC,"just popping over from the 9ers reddit to congratulate you on a freakin beast of a punter and I am shocked to see most of you not ecstatic. Do you guys realize who and what you got there? After the draft it was inevitable that we'd see andy go, but fuck, I'm a grown man and I had to wipe a few tears away when it sunk in that we would lose andy.   Respect that man and love him as he deserves. I was pulling for you guys a little bit before but if you have a good season I might actually buy a browns jersey now."
Browns,38tcd8,Mingatron,10,Sat Jun 6 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily that most of us don't know that Andy is a great punter and an upgrade at the position.  It's just that Lanning was a bit of a fan favorite.  Had a good sense of humor, was engaged with the fans, and just an overall nice guy.  It's like your first car... sure, it's not the best on the streets and the new one is way better in all meaningful ways, but it's still sad to see it go."

Browns,38tcd8,debtsetradio,11,Mon Jun 8 06:14:16 2015 UTC,Was never impressed by Lanning. Don't know anything about the new punter but I felt we definitely needed an upgrade.
Browns,38tcd8,admiralkit,15,Sat Jun 6 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"Lanning  was solid though not exceptional.  Given that I don't expect much from the offense this year, an upgrade at Punter can only be a good thing."
Browns,38tcd8,debtsetradio,7,Sat Jun 6 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He wasn't terrible, but I didn't feel like he gave us a boost the way a great punter can. So far it's looking like our bread and butter is going to be our defense, and a good punter can help make a good defense great by consistently winning the field position battle.  Koch for the Ravens always kills us, everytime we get a stop inside the 20 it seems like that dude booms it. Hoping this new guy can bring that dimensions to our special teams."
Browns,38tcd8,nizule,9,Sat Jun 6 19:35:01 2015 UTC,Hell yes. Lee is fantastic.

Browns,38jxgn,Xibyn,17,Thu Jun 4 18:41:16 2015 UTC,"Can he? I don't know. Do I want to give him a real, honest opportunity to try? Absolutely.   If the Browns part ways with him before giving him a serious chance, I'll be pissed."
Browns,38jxgn,Fred_Zeppelin,3,Thu Jun 4 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"By all indications they will give him a fair shake. They stuck with him and supported him through rehab, Pettine defends him against the media routinely, and he went from ""alternating 2nd QB reps"" to ""taking the 2nd QB reps"". He might not start a single game this year, but it won't be because he wasn't given a chance. He also might start several game this year. This is why football is fun. Go Browns!"
Browns,38jxgn,AKlep,2,Fri Jun 5 02:52:09 2015 UTC,Exactly.  And they sacrifice nothing to be patient with it and see it play out.  Its not like they have a stud rookie waiting in the wings that playing Manziel would be keeping someone from growing.
Browns,38jxgn,Kosmo_Kramer_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:51:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I was never sold on him when we got him, but since we have him I want to at least give him a fair and legitimate shot. I want the opportunity for my initial reaction to be proven wrong."
Browns,38jxgn,HawkeyeJosh,14,Sat Jun 6 07:57:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like the thing people fail to account for (this article briefly mentions it, ftr) is Manziel is a smart guy. He made a bunch of youthful mistakes, to a certain degree coasted on his natural talent (this is a just to a certain degree, make no mistake you don't win a heisman without putting in some work,) and yadda yadda is from a 'privileged' background. All of that, sure, wrecks a guy who doesn't have the mental capacity to deal with it. But Manziel is pretty bright, you don't have to hang out with him to see that. Now he's realized he was blowing his one shot at living his dream, took a huge step towards fixing that, and came and got right back to work. Everyone knows he has natural talent, but he's gotta get his head right on and off the field. And I just think, despite what 2 articles a day would try to make you believe, he's gonna do it.   I honestly don't think McCown starts game one this season, I honestly don't think the Browns think he's gonna either. I don't even know if McCown believes it, in his heart. BUT if this whole season is McCowns and they all just think Manziel needs one more bench season to get his head right, I still think he's gonna do it, because now he knows what he should be doing over there.  My point is: Go Johnny. Show us that magic. Make these goddamn incessant articles stop."
Browns,38jxgn,mambalaya,3,Thu Jun 4 19:24:05 2015 UTC,To sum up what you just said.
Browns,38jxgn,TheDoubleL27,8,Thu Jun 4 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, most of that elusiveness just doesn't translate too well to the NFL. Guys make tackles at this level. He needs to focus on his pocket passing if he wants to be successful."
Browns,38jxgn,Doyle524,2,Thu Jun 4 20:52:15 2015 UTC,"I think the common misconception is that he is a running qb. He will always look to pass first.  The running is just a bonus.  Guys like aaron rodgers, andrew luck, alex smith aren't running qbs but if the play breaks down they can pick up some yards with their feet."
Browns,38jxgn,stangstang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:01:00 2015 UTC,That's what I'm saying he needs to be.
Browns,38jxgn,Doyle524,3,Thu Jun 4 23:02:26 2015 UTC,"He's getting there.  It takes time though.  Aaron rodgers didnt become aaron rodgers in 1 year.  Unfortunately, if he doesnt beat out mcccown in training camp, most of the world will consider him a bust."
Browns,38jxgn,stangstang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:06:32 2015 UTC,It bums me out to see Rodgers and Luck in the same sentence as Alex Smith.
Browns,38jxgn,toomuchpwn,0,Fri Jun 5 21:25:45 2015 UTC,"That is the biggest load of horse shit. Everyone knows his elusiveness won't be AS effective as it was in college, but to say it won't translate??   I don't get why people think they can say this like it's a proven fact when Russell and Cam etc etc are still elusive at this level. And don't start with the ""slower 40 time"" BS because Johnny's fastest 40 time was a 4.56 which was on par with Kap, Cam and Russell."
Browns,38jxgn,dring_round,4,Thu Jun 4 21:28:48 2015 UTC,"Because Russell and Cam (when effective) use the run as a supplement to the pass. A good running QB keeps his eyes down field while escaping the pocket, which Johnny really doesn't in this video. Also most of the tackles he squirmed out of would have been sacks by any competent NFL DL or LB. I'm not saying he won't be successful, and I'm not saying that his running ability can't help him succeed, I'm just saying that he can't rely on it as much as he did."
Browns,38jxgn,Doyle524,2,Thu Jun 4 21:44:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly, just like Kap Cam and Russell."
Browns,38jxgn,dring_round,0,Thu Jun 4 21:45:31 2015 UTC,But he's the man he's the man he's the maaaan.
Browns,38jxgn,TheDoubleL27,2,Thu Jun 4 21:22:44 2015 UTC,Watching the way he holds the ball away from his body as he runs just terrifies me.

Browns,38jxgn,tomchaney479,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:23:40 2015 UTC,This is one of the better Johnny articles I've seen in awhile in that it seems to put things in the right perspective without making any claims about things we won't know until the fall. By that I mean Johnny seems to be doing the things he needs to do to give himself the best chance for success this season. It doesn't claim that he definitely will or won't succeed or start because that's asinine and unknowable. Also it mostly deflects the water bottle story as nothing because it pretty much is. Time will tell but at least if Johnny gives it everything he has there won't be near so much to regret for him or us.

Dude was too busy blaming everyone else for the nose dive his season took and protect his job. McCown might suck every bit as bas bad as Hoyer did at the end of last season but at least he will be showing how a profressional QB does his job, and if Johnny can be that guy that will be a valuable tool for the future. At the very least I expect I won't have to see Derek Anderson esque excuse making after every  0TD 3 INT performance."
Browns,38gd20,farmerwouldsay,14,Thu Jun 4 14:36:55 2015 UTC,"As boring as it is, McCown is a much better guy for this team right now. Don't fuck up, run the offense, and the Browns will get results. Keep the kid on the bench."

Browns,38gd20,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"The key is he was better than Hoyer with an abomination of a line featuring Oneill cousins and Gilkey, while Hoyer enjoyed a atop 15 line and couldn't get it done.  We upgraded, plus he can run a little.  He's an athlete and he has a good attitude win-win."

Gip was an UFA and the tender does more than quadrupole what he was making. Not that I'm against players trying to maximize their earnings, they should, but unless Gip can find another team to negotiate with he's going to have to sign that tender.  Some have tried to make this story into more than it is. You can call it low ball if you like, but the bottom line is the tenders exist for the teams advantage and protection. It's all been collectively bargained. NFL contracts are now setup in a manner which players get paid for past production, and Gip simply hasn't had enough time on the field to warrant a huge contract.   Hopefully he proves he can remain healthy, has a solid season or two, and earns a nice payday."

Browns,38g6wv,bigbaer1,2,Thu Jun 4 05:22:21 2015 UTC,"With Tate being cut/traded it didn't help either be more valuable and with Duke in town I think it will be harder than before.    The biggest issue that fantasy owners should have with Browns running backs is that Pettine would start them based on parameters that no one but he knew (how they did in practice).  I wonder how much of that was Shanahan, who favors committee running backs, and how much is that Crow and West never separated enough.   Maybe with Flip actually getting with the rest of the NFL by incorporating bubble passes we may have more set roles (every down back, 3rd down passing back, etc) instead of Crow-this-game, West-this-game."

We sorely missed that last year and I think with our line this is a great way to get our RBs in space instead of, you know, tosses to the right.  Our DBs are killing it. Even without much contact they are suffocating, it seems like it will be a good year on that side of the ball."

I remember covering a charity game alongside the St Louis Rams' video guys, they had great equipment but they were literally drunk while filming  and our footage ended up crushing theirs by a mile.  On topic, West looks good running the ball, would be cool to get him going often, his attitude is hilarious and that TD dance!"
Browns,38e8cx,ButtasaurusFlex,10,Wed Jun 3 17:12:32 2015 UTC,They said he is doing really well and will fight Gilbert for the #2 corner. That position is our deepest.
Browns,38e8cx,stangstang,8,Wed Jun 3 18:11:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that secondary looks fantastic. So is it Gilbert's job to lose? Tramon must've figured he could beat him out."
Browns,38e8cx,qck11,7,Wed Jun 3 18:37:30 2015 UTC,I think there are only a select few that have a starting job locked up. Gilbert didn't do the greatest last year. Obviously the FO would rather have him play lights out but Pettine will start the best player.
Browns,38e8cx,Future_Timer,6,Wed Jun 3 19:49:14 2015 UTC,It was assumed when we first were able to sign him that he would come in to play opposite Haden. At least thats the vibe I got from the beat writers and what I read. My bet is we see Williams start but Gilbert will still see the field a good amount.
Browns,38e8cx,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:27:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Gilbert could have trouble getting playing time if Tramon wins it early on."
Browns,38e8cx,miked1be,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:55:26 2015 UTC,"It's still way too early but I'm sure he's fine, he's played well for too long to not mesh with a new team."
Browns,38dmcw,KevinMack25,7,Wed Jun 3 15:07:53 2015 UTC,"Not surprising. As last year went on they got better and better, they're in their second season in the same defense, and off season moves have only improved the group. Should be fun to watch.  Edit:  “It’s par for the course,” Haden said. “We just come into it making sure we get our hands on a lot of balls.""  Nice."
Browns,38dmcw,miked1be,3,Wed Jun 3 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"When he said McCown was ""Standing tall in the pocket, peering over the center of the defense""   Felt like some backhanded snark from Grossi"
Browns,38dmcw,St0ckt0nS,4,Wed Jun 3 21:16:29 2015 UTC,But is Gipson going to be part of that group?
Browns,38dmcw,Bhockzer,6,Wed Jun 3 15:25:14 2015 UTC,The only way he wouldn't be is if another team gives him an offer the Browns don't want to match and give us a 2nd rounder for him as well.
Browns,38dmcw,miked1be,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:45:54 2015 UTC,I thought that period ended around April 25th. Now other teams can't bring him in/make offers. He has until sometime in late June/July to sign the tender or its gets dropped to $600k-$800k.
Browns,38dmcw,Chiranthodendron,2,Thu Jun 4 16:14:55 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, I suck at keeping track of all of these dates."
Browns,38dmcw,miked1be,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:25:58 2015 UTC,"The Defense looks incredibly deep this year. Maybe its because I'm so used to having little depth for so many years with the browns? I dunno, but this year...so much depth and talent. If the DL can apply constant pressure this D might become a nightmare for opposing QBs."

I'm sure teams who are in the same system that they have been in for years are smooth this time of year and those with new systems are sloppy.  Neither means shit. Hell last year the Patriots were flat out awful, AWFUL over a month into the season. Thats how meaningless OTAs are when even the first few weeks of the regular season doesn't even mean shit and we're 100 days away from those.  You, me, a reporter, and even the coaches can't tell anything from OTAs. Nothing at all. It's no real pressure slow down of the 101 basics of principles they're going to be using. Mental reps are 10000x more important than actual reps in OTAs.   I'm getting tired of this shit. I mean these reporters have seen 2 days of OTAs and have already declared this season a wash and everybody sucks and this franchise is a failure on ever level. After 2 fucking days of meaningless OTAs they've decided this.  Hack bullshit."
Browns,38ak6i,KevinMack25,2,Tue Jun 2 23:36:11 2015 UTC,I find it interesting that he didn't mention the offense in its 1st year is going against a (pretty damn good) defense in its 2nd year. That could be making the offense look a little worse.
Browns,38ak6i,bearsdriving,4,Wed Jun 3 00:26:57 2015 UTC,"The best comment on the article was the same thing...   So... McCown and Manziel are struggling vs the #1 pass defense last year, while learning a new offense, and we should panic?   Great reporting guys!"

Browns,388bo0,jakeremore,2,Tue Jun 2 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"That has jack shit to do with Haslam, Farmer, and Pettine.  Haslam smartly cleaned house when Lombardi and Banner went weasel, now he's got Football guys in charge and low and behold we went 7-9 in year one with shit QB and no run defense.  We are on the way up and focusing on decades old negativity is a waste."
Browns,388bo0,PrimeTimeHoyer,-1,Tue Jun 2 20:59:53 2015 UTC,"True, but you can't blame Grossi for being negative in his ""honest"" reporting of the team. Unless he's lying, there are few ways to spin 14-16 years being losing seasons being positive.  As for Pettine and Haslam, what has Grossi seen that is different? Stop looking at hope and start looking at results."
Browns,388bo0,jakeremore,5,Tue Jun 2 21:56:06 2015 UTC,"Our best record in 7 years?    Two drafts ripe with contributors?  Veteran acquisitions who actually work out?  Letting dead weight go (my favorite) instead of ponying up big bucks?  This regime is different than the others before.  They got results immediately, sort of like Butch Davis, who not coincidentally took us to the playoffs our lone time STR."
Browns,388bo0,PrimeTimeHoyer,2,Tue Jun 2 22:28:02 2015 UTC,"I think the true test of this regime will be next year when the schedule gets ridiculously tough instead of super easy as was last year. Take the average win total of this past year and the following year and that's the true test.  But I'm sorry I'm not willing to give them credit when they had to have a QB competition in camp when Johnny could barely throw a football straight and couldn't read a NFL defense at all. We found that out in week 12 or whatever, but they saw this guy in training camp all off-season.   You could have declared Hoyer the guy right away because he (hopefully to the coaches) was the clear better QB between the two and said that Manziel was a year away. Instead they run a QB competition that makes fans think that Manziel is pretty close to what Hoyer was. This set them up to fail big time later in the season once Hoyer's mental defenses finally collapsed from the pressure of the fans and front office being against him.  Hoyer was 7-4 and there were people calling for Johnny. The coaching and front office created that problem, not Tony Grossi.  EDIT: I didn't even bring up the Farmer text-gate nonsense until now either."
Browns,388bo0,jakeremore,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"Uh, Hoyer was a bottom tier starter last year.  He barely edged out Manziel in the preseason, and played PASSABLY but unspectacularly the first few weeks before nosediving to the bottom of active QBs in every important category.  Then when his implosion is complete Manziel gets put in the game and scores first drive out.  The mistake was going back to Hoyer against IND, where he promptly shat the bed completely while the defense turned a top 5 QB into mincemeat, and we lost our playoff hopes on his terrible QB play.  The rest of the season is Shanahan crying and orchestrating his way out, Manziel pissed at getting benched unreasonably after sparking the O, and the veterans taking control of the team and playing tough to the end.   Without the cancerous anchor of Brian Hoyer I expect this team to be vastly improved on offense."
Browns,388bo0,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you something for the sake of sanity. Do you believe that if Manziel started the season he would have at least gone 7-4, or heck even 6-5?  EDIT: You have hindsight and saw what Manziel looked like when he played against the Bengals, Pettine and Farmer were seeing this since training camp and somehow didn't know."
Browns,388bo0,jakeremore,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"I believe our record would have been no worse in the end of we had started Johnny from wk1.  Hoyer was a TD black hole the entire season, spraying the ball everywhere but in stride to wide open guys.  Our running game and defense won us those games, Hoyer's signature win was TEN where he did jack shit for 3.5 quarters and we won on a fluke when TEN QB went out of the game and Tuel came in up big.  Or PIT where he connected on barely 2 worthwhile passes all day and it's a slaughter because we ran all over their sorry asses.  Sorry, Hoyer blew, Manziel might not have been better but he wouldn't/couldn't have been much worse considering the supporting cast.  McCown is a perennial never was, and in 2014 he rated just above Hoyer with Oneil Cousins and no OC, Hoyer has A HOF LT and Shanahan and still can't beat him.  Pathetic."
Browns,388bo0,PrimeTimeHoyer,4,Tue Jun 2 23:43:44 2015 UTC,I believe our record would have been no worse in the end of we had started Johnny from wk1   You are crazy
Browns,388bo0,farmerwouldsay,-2,Wed Jun 3 00:36:05 2015 UTC,"No I'm not.  Hoyer was a bottom 5 QB last year.  He got outplayed by two rookies head to head, couldn't hit a wide open guy in stride if his life depended on it.  If Johnny would have started instead of Hoyer I believe our record would have been the same, only we'd have won more at the end of the year instead of only at the beginning and falling off a cliff."
Browns,388bo0,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:28:48 2015 UTC,"wasn't that the game that Mack went down for the season? The McCown game I'm referring to.  EDIT:What I'm saying is that Hoyer was bleh/average at best, and Manziel isn't capable at all of playing in this league. The source of that last statement are the three games he showed up in last season and what writers who follow the browns have been saying while watching him the past few weeks. Also that never was QB from Tampa is now going to be our starter this season. Props to Farmer."
Browns,388bo0,jakeremore,0,Wed Jun 3 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"Hoyer was not average, he was bottom of the barrel in every important category.  If we'd have gone with Johnny from day one we'd be a lot better off right now IMO and no worse for the wear last season.  Our easiest schedule in a decade and we blew it on Brian Fucking Hoyer, who shit his legs spectacularly while whining constantly and blaming everyone else as his stats dropped below Geno Smith and guys like that.   We should be talking about repeating our playoff trip, not rebuilding the QB position again."
Browns,388bo0,PrimeTimeHoyer,0,Wed Jun 3 00:45:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't fathom why Grossi isn't more positive.  He can focus on the Browns success in the first round over the past half decade: Phil Taylor, Trent Richardson, Brandon Weeden, Mingo, Gilbert, and Manziel.  Or, he could talk about the legends who have quarterbacked the Browns over the last 15 years: names like Quinn, Anderson, Frye, Gradkowski, Manziel, etc.  How about he focus on all of the late season key games the Browns have played - with playoff implications hanging in the balance.  Hard to understand why Grossi and other media members can be so negative about the Browns."

Browns,388egx,dring_round,10,Tue Jun 2 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"Id also like to remind everyone that one of Johnnys private tutors before the NFL draft is now our QB coach. I think the organization is trying very hard to make him pan out, opposed to the media consensus that were ""moving on"""
Browns,388egx,Godszn,3,Tue Jun 2 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the big story when hiring him was that he gave us a bit of an inside look at Mariota since he trained with him too.  Looks like it was just advantageous all around.  I think it was more about Manziel than Mariota though, I really didn't get much of an impression that they were going to make a serious run at him in the draft and by all accounts they didn't.  Sounds like they offered both firsts to move up to the 2nd overall spot which sounds more like an exploratory flyer than real attempt."
Browns,388egx,miked1be,7,Tue Jun 2 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"It's only June. I'm not focusing on this issue till preseason. I'm pulling for John but if he can't beat a 38 year old career backup, he probably won't work out for us. He needs to show up sometime this season or he's most likely gone. I'm more focused in on the impending rb battle and what happens with the front seven of the d. Can't wait until camp starts."
Browns,388egx,sunkingishere,3,Tue Jun 2 16:32:23 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting till preseason.  If they look even remotely close,  I'm putting in johnny and not looking back."
Browns,388egx,stangstang,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"Should have done that last year.  Remember how mediocre they both looked in preseason?  The competition ended up being a wash of ""meh"", and Hoyer got that job based on training camp."
Browns,388egx,PrimeTimeHoyer,2,Tue Jun 2 23:15:54 2015 UTC,"And we almost made the playoffs.  I can understand if it's a crap season for sure, but gotta take your best chance to win.  Plus Pettine can't afford to screw around too long or he will be axed."
Browns,388egx,smartfbrankings,-1,Wed Jun 3 02:34:17 2015 UTC,"We SHOULD have made the playoffs, with all the flukes and lucky bounces going our way, and yet we couldn't because our QB could t hit a barn and went 1td to 8int down the stretch when we needed him most.  Good QBs put up 20+tds, not 8-10 with an equal amount of INTs and getting worse every game until the season ends.  At least with Manziel the hope is he'd be trending UP by the end of the year."
Browns,388egx,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:57:49 2015 UTC,"No one is claiming Hoyer was good.  Just that he provided a better chance at winning than Manziel.  With Manziel, all there is is hope.  Far too much emphasis is on game play as somehow making players better.  He's putting 95% of his work in in practice anyway, the game stuff is just polish."
Browns,388egx,smartfbrankings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:46:39 2015 UTC,And Johnny didn't bother to learn the playbook or show up on time. We saw what he did when he was in...he looked like absolute shit.  In any normal situation the backup at least has a grasp of the offense or knows it completely.  Ours didn't. There was no development to be had because he couldn't be bothered to do shit for an entire year.  We'll see if this year is at all different because the talk is that he did the same thing at Texas A&M unless he was playing Alabama or a bigger team.  If he can't win the job in camp like anybody else he doesn't play. Period.
Browns,388egx,Deadleggg,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"He looked like shit in 6 quarters with an OC orchestrating his exit behind the scenes and no support from his QB mentor.  Hoyer looked like shit for 6 WEEKS, and still there's Browns fans go want him back.  Give it a rest."
Browns,388egx,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:54:51 2015 UTC,Definitely not his fault at all. Sure
Browns,388egx,Deadleggg,2,Wed Jun 3 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah he fucked up, it's probably the best that he learned his lesson rookie year.  Nonetheless, Hoyer and Hoyer alone blew last season for us, Pettine gave him every chance, every opportunity to stand up and make a play to get us in the playoffs, and all he did was tank like a scrub and bring our season down with him.  Good riddance, and Johnny couldn't have been any worse that dead last."

Browns,388egx,taylork213,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"2nd year rookie is essentially what he is. He was lazy as fuck last year and didn't learn. So therefore, a 37 year old veteran should very obviously look better at first than someone who essentially reset from square one."
Browns,388egx,smartfbrankings,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:03:12 2015 UTC,Do you think QBs learn more in practice or starting?
Browns,388egx,miked1be,0,Wed Jun 3 02:33:21 2015 UTC,Different QBs learn different ways at different stages in their development.
Browns,388egx,smartfbrankings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:04:10 2015 UTC,"While there are certain elements of being in a game that are hard to replicate, the number of reps during a game is so insignificant compared to practice.  Johnny can benefit tremendously just through practice, and McCown playing won't have a big impact on that development if he is serious."
Browns,388egx,taylork213,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"no such thing as a 2nd year rookie, 2nd year rookie is actually an oxymoron. Just cause he loafed through his first full season doesn't make him a rookie. Stop the excuses"
Browns,388egx,taylork213,0,Wed Jun 3 18:14:13 2015 UTC,"No excuses.   2nd year ""rookie"".   There, do the quotes help?   As a result of his actions last year, he is the EQUIVALENT of a 2nd year ""rookie"".   Holy fuck some of you people in this sub....."
Browns,388egx,taylork213,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:16:35 2015 UTC,"rookie...meaning a player in there first full year, Manziel is not... so no, he's not a 2nd year rookie (Which is still a oxymoron), he's a 2nd year under preforming player based on his draft spot. If he was injured his first year-full season, then maybe 2nd year rookie would apply, but it doesn't, no matter how you spin it or where you put quotes  Not sure why that's hard for you to understand, seriously need to get over your Manziel crush, it's clouding your critical thinking skills. stop the excuses"
Browns,388egx,mikeyrawx914,0,Wed Jun 3 18:24:48 2015 UTC,"I said ""rookie"" because he wasted his first year. If you cannot understand that, maybe you have MORE than clouding of your critical thinking skills.   Nice attempt at making me look like the dumbass, dumbass."

Browns,388egx,miked1be,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:37:14 2015 UTC,After seeing how the team played around him in his first start it isn't really much of a question who will start the year. That being said we should all know it's very likely he gets his chance to start come November.
Browns,388egx,740Buckeye,3,Tue Jun 2 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"I'm putting it on Shanahan.  That mother fucked tanked a season in DC, you don't think he did the same here?  All that read option bullshit we'd never run in a game before, and you try it against that Cincy front 7?  Fuck that, Kyle Shanahan did that on purpose because he didn't like being told what to do because he's a little bitch."
Browns,388egx,smartfbrankings,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"IMO there's more to it than just a comparison between McCown and Manziel.  We have a brand new, rookie OC that's trying to bring his brand new offense to the team.  The offensive players are learning this and trying to progress as a unit.  Having McCown in there over Manziel right now gives them a vet that only has to learn the offense and help execute it as opposed to a 2nd year player that has to learn and do all of that along with continuing to learn to play at the NFL level.  This is why I agree with McCown in his statement from the other day that a competition with Manziel would be a distraction.  QBs splitting reps while the offense and OC are trying to work out a system would slow the process for the rest of the guys.  Any advantage Manziel may offer right now (if any at all) just isn't worth the setback for the rest of the team IMO.  Let him grow and build and get into an offense that already knows the ropes if/when he eventually starts."
Browns,388egx,740Buckeye,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"And what happens when Josh McCown channels his inner Brandon Weeden?   Then we have a 2nd year quarterback that has to learn as he goes IN A GAME.   Do it now, get it over with so we're not shooting ourselves in the foot during the season."
Browns,388egx,smartfbrankings,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:25:26 2015 UTC,How is learning as he goes in a game in week 1 worse than week 4 or 9 or 15?
Browns,388egx,740Buckeye,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:34:43 2015 UTC,That's why he learns in the offseason...
Browns,388egx,smartfbrankings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:37:44 2015 UTC,So what is McCown being named the starter now hurt Johnny from learning in the offseason?
Browns,388egx,740Buckeye,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"Not saying he shouldn't be named the starter as of now, but to keep Johnny from getting first team reps is just stupid.   McCown is a Brian Hoyer type player, below average quarterback who has random bursts of decent play...it's not as if we're going to be starting him for the entire season."
Browns,388egx,smartfbrankings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:48:56 2015 UTC,You missing the downside of having the first team offensive players having to play with Johnny instead of McCown?
Browns,388egx,Deadleggg,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:57:14 2015 UTC,"What downside? They have the same playbook, and it's not as if we're going to be asking the receivers to run deep routes and catch prayers.   Any negative impact on the ""learning"" of the new system will be minimal, because it's going to be a very run heavy offense with a few 5-10 yard routes."
Browns,388egx,miked1be,2,Wed Jun 3 02:59:03 2015 UTC,"The downside is having to adjust to a QB who is not ready and makes more mistakes, doesn't know the playbook as well, etc...  They'll have a lot more wasted reps."
Browns,388egx,740Buckeye,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:47:15 2015 UTC,I don't think Pettine believes in handing anybody anything. If Johnny can't earn his reps now Odin help us during a game.
Browns,388egx,miked1be,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"And what if the coaches truly believe Manziel isn't ready yet?  Then we're throwing a guy to the wolves surrounded by an offense that's still trying to figure out the system for themselves, let alone helping a young QB along that isn't ready."
Browns,388egx,740Buckeye,0,Tue Jun 2 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"That's why this is the offseason. It's not as if we're going to be going into Week 2 with the coaches saying ""Well, we'll see who looks better in practice this week"".   Shit like this is occurring ALL AROUND the league at this time, it's all about putting your team in the best position to win."
Browns,388egx,miked1be,2,Tue Jun 2 16:27:58 2015 UTC,So... Just throw him in no matter the opinion of the coaches and hope he's ready by the time the season starts?
Browns,388egx,740Buckeye,-1,Tue Jun 2 16:28:56 2015 UTC,He's fucking splitting reps during drills dude...he isn't splitting reps in a fucking game.
Browns,388egx,KevinMack25,3,Tue Jun 2 16:29:54 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about?  I'm saying that right now IMO it's better for a vet like McCown to take first team reps so the offense can learn at a better rate, especially if the coaches believe Manziel isn't ready.  If Manziel isn't ready he could possibly hamper the development of the rest of the offense.    What I'm getting from you is that it's the off season right now so we should be naming Manziel starter so he can spend time with the first team and hopefully be ready by the time the season starts even if the coaches don't think he's ready for that.  I'm asking if that's what you're saying.  No need to be all snippy about it."
Browns,388egx,740Buckeye,-1,Tue Jun 2 16:33:15 2015 UTC,"The way I read the article is that McCown is saying that there is NO chance that Manziel starts this year, no matter how well Manziel comes along or how poorly McCown does.   DeFilippo said in an interview that the playbooks will be exactly the same for both quarterbacks, you could have Tim Tebow getting first team reps and I bet that the offense will look just the same no matter who the quarterback is on week 1.   Run heavy, short passes."
Browns,388egx,PrimeTimeHoyer,3,Tue Jun 2 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"McCrown   I would have also accepted ""Mc-Royale-ty (with cheese)"""

Browns,388egx,DayvyT,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:17:14 2015 UTC,"“More than anything, for me, I just believe it takes away from any kind of distraction that you can have and the team can just move in one direction, regardless of who that guy is,” McCown told Cleveland.com. “It’s helpful to just say, ‘this is our guy until something happens and he’s not our guy.’ But I agree with that philosophy and that approach. It doesn’t take anything away from our group and it doesn’t take away from what Johnny and Thad [Lewis] and Connor [Shaw] are doing. We’re all working together.”   Looks to me he's just saying that he believes its better to just have a starter named instead of splitting first team reps in a QB competition unless something happens (like injury, poor play, improved play from Johnny, etc) and then that player is no longer your starter.  That doesn't sound like any sort of ""no matter what"" scenario."
Browns,388egx,PrimeTimeHoyer,0,Tue Jun 2 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"And just as I said earlier, shit like this has been happening across the NFL for decades and it will continue to do so with minimal distractions, new offense coordinator or not. It's no more of a distraction than any of the other important position battles currently ongoing. The RB battle could be called a distraction due to the different play styles.  You split reps throughout the offseason and make your choice based upon what you see."

Browns,383ah1,JohnnyFire,57,Mon Jun 1 15:49:06 2015 UTC,"Close. More like:  Stephen A. Smith: Now I understand, you talk to these athletes, they need to have a grasp...a GRASP...on their personal livelihoods. But you DO NOT have friends when you are playing to be one of the GREATEST. Everything you do, ev-rey-thing-that-you-do, has to be, not ARBITRARILY, not LACKADAISICALLY, it has to be to be the best you can possibly be, and I KNOW, I KNOW that Manziel does not live, breathe, eat, sleep, EXIST as a franchise QB in the NFL to-day. That's the problem, he needs to stop pontificating on the day-to-day problems of being in the public...eye...and CON-SUME HIM-SELF on being a star."

Chances are someone told him to fuck off in that time and he stuck around.    Edit:  Also, this http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/browns/2015/05/31/johnny-manziel-harassment-byron-nelson-golf-tournament/28266979/   According to police, an 18-year-old autograph seeker may have badgered Manziel, a former star at Texas A&M, for a couple of hours.  ""The only criminal offense that occurred was somebody that was in Johnny's group pushed the 18 year old. It was not Johnny, that's misinformation that's out there, and (the 18 year old) didn't want to press charges,"" said James McLellan, public information officer for the Irving Police Department.

Browns,383ah1,740Buckeye,6,Mon Jun 1 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"From what I've read Johnny did a good job of tolerating the heckler for so long.  He was probably employing some anger management mental techniques he learned at rehab,  But someone should tell him he doesn't need to torture himself by listening to harassment for 2 hours.

Browns,383ah1,DrHandBanana,-4,Mon Jun 1 23:50:24 2015 UTC,Nothing to contribute to this garbage TMZ media nonsense.  It doesn't change his 42 QB rating and 0 TDs passing last year.
Browns,383ah1,hatmantc,3,Tue Jun 2 00:54:57 2015 UTC,"If any other team had an alcoholic quarterback fresh out of rehab, I think they'd be happy to hear he wasn't drinking in a typical social drinking situation. I didn't mention the ""incident"" at all, because it was a total TMZSPN overblown deal. Nothing changes the facts you stated, the post was about his good choices from a Browns team member. You chose to react like a prick and then justify it with a remark about poor performance last year. Not sure why you would post at all if you have nothing to add or say."
Browns,383ah1,DrHandBanana,-2,Tue Jun 2 01:10:49 2015 UTC,"Just on a small crusade to one by one changing this reaction commentary to witch hunt stories like this.  It seems you have already labeled the dude an alcoholic when you don't know a bit of his personal life.  You're assuming you even know the reason he went to rehab.  We dont.  Better not check out that video of Peyton Manning drunk kareoke.  Or the pica of half the other nfl QBs you can find drinking (Rapelesburger and Sheli are Super Bowl winners with drunk pics).    It is silly to spy on our own dude like this.  Cleveland has finally reentered the national media and we are looking amateurs because of the reactions like yours.    Sit back and wait until pre season comes.  Results on the field are the only thing that mattered, not any of this garbage."

The truth is that they can’t. One guy might feel stronger in their observations, but there is no way for two people to watch the same guy throwing passes and one conclude that he looked solid and the other to conclude that his career is as good as dead. Unless one is blatantly distorting facts into opinion.   It's entirely possible(and happens all the time) to have two different observations on the same practice.  It's called bias.  One person is pro-Manziel, the other is anti-Manziel."
Browns,383lig,MethLab,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:39:13 2015 UTC,Pro or anti manziel. This level of retardation thankfully doesn't filter to any other position. Is someone pro Terrance west or anti Brian Hartline? This fanbase and it's obsession with finding it's Messiah is slightly embarrasing.
Browns,383lig,Deadleggg,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:11:10 2015 UTC,Or it's not about being pro or anti anything. They literally might have different opinions about what a starting QB should be.   Scouts disagree all the time when looking at the same thing.

I get it, ""people only write trash because you guys keep buying it/clicking it"" but this is the wrong dude to write about it. He has stopped recently but he is the same guy who has tried so hard to break stories by posting things he's heard from ""sources"". Then when he's wrong he always says ""I never said it would happen for sure"" Come on dude, just own it. He has tried to build his whole shtick around how awful the local media is but can't see he does the same shit.   I think we all wish our local/national media was better (Grossi/MKC can be laughable at times) but this is like an alcoholic giving everyone advice on how to get sober."

It's less like ""an alcoholic giving everyone advice on how to get sober"" and more like (expanding on your point that ""he has stopped recently"") a recently sober alcoholic giving everyone advice on how to get sober. In the latter, the main issue isn't whether the message is valid or not, but whether the messenger can follow their own advice."

You'd be fucked in the head if you didn't battle for a starting qb salary when you've been a backup your whole NFL career. That's major money, and Hoyer wanted it. If I had the opportunity to set my family up for life playing football for a few years, you're damn right I would be as competitive as possible.   That's money that he wants to last the rest of his life, don't be pissed at him for wanting to earn as much as he can."

Browns,380x0o,Anavrin22,2,Mon Jun 1 15:14:21 2015 UTC,The Steelers beat up on the Ravens for several years while the Ravens sought a franchise quarterback. The moment they found one the series is pretty darn close to 50/50.

Browns,3832ad,Brokewood,11,Mon Jun 1 14:45:28 2015 UTC,I flat out can't stand ESPN anymore. OP also refers to 850 and The Really Big Commercial. Those guys are a joke and barely give any valid sport opinions. In fact you'll commonly find more opinions on movies than you will on sports on that show.   ESPN is a joke and so is this non-story.

Here, listen to this irate fan with completely horseshit opinions talking about the most extreme view of this take.  Wow.  Manziel must really be that bad, and it sounds like everybody hates him.  Have you tried Jo-Bees?  I feel great because of these little gold tablets.  What a difference it has made in my life.  We'll be back after these commercials.  10 minutes of commercials  You're listening to the Really Big Show on ESPN 850. This B-Spot burger is delicious, right Casey?  We'll be back to talk about the developing story on Manziel.  10 more minutes of commercials  We're here with Football Expert Tony Grossi.

Browns,3832ad,sonicmerlin,9,Mon Jun 1 18:32:50 2015 UTC,I don't know why everyone expects Johnny to be a hermit. People are just assholes and Johnny needs to realize that and be able to control his anger when these situations are present.
Browns,3832ad,n813,2,Mon Jun 1 14:55:52 2015 UTC,I just hope he learns from these experiences with the general public.  There are attention seeking d-bags everywhere that will look to exploit him just like any other hot tempered celebrity.
Browns,3832ad,MonarchStarcrack,2,Mon Jun 1 15:11:49 2015 UTC,"You will be downvoted for saying this, but it is true. He needs to learn how to handle conflict. I am questioning his leadership at this point as well. If he can't control himself, how can he lead a team? Before people jump on me, just remember that he reacted and didn't react to the situation professionally."
Browns,3832ad,calebkeith,2,Mon Jun 1 15:03:59 2015 UTC,"I really hope I'm not but it's the truth. He's a recovering addict. Making him sit at home, alone, in a city where the only people he probably associates with is teammates. The last thing he needs is to not live a life. He lives on a golf course that requires a $100/month food/drinks tab. If he's stuck there, he's going to end up drinking which is obviously not a good thing. This kid needs a support system that says, ""Hey. You need to live your life BUT you need to realize there are people out there that want to hurt you physically and emotionally. Don't buy into their garbage.""  People have to remember, this kid has had his butt kissed probably for the first 20 years of his life. This negative stuff is all new to him. He's gotta learn to cope with it now."
Browns,3832ad,n813,2,Mon Jun 1 15:58:30 2015 UTC,"He lives on a golf course that requires a $100/month food/drinks tab.   If you think for one second that the club is going to force him to actually purchase F&B, I've got a bridge on 480 to sell you. He's gonna cut a check for $100 every month and be done with it."
Browns,3832ad,eleven21,0,Mon Jun 1 18:45:10 2015 UTC,Oh I don't doubt that. No reason to be an asshole but it's not to stop him from running to a bar a quarter mile from his house.
Browns,3832ad,n813,3,Mon Jun 1 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"I'm just glad the Indians and Cavs are doing well because the Manziel stories are just incredibly lethargic at this point.  We get it; he played like shit and went to rehab. But everyone wants to be the pundit that made the poignant allegory for Manziel's downfall that resonates with the blogosphere the most. Every one of them are trying to make some grand statement about Manziel not as a player or a person but as a concept; the idea of a man who was so good in one universe (college) and so bad elsewhere because it's meaningful to the sport somehow.  I don't like Manziel as a person or a player very much but holy fuck do I want him to just play some football at this point, like the fucking football player he is supposed to be, for better or worse."
Browns,3832ad,JohnnyFire,4,Mon Jun 1 15:32:24 2015 UTC,So basically they're blaming the victim and not the victimizer ... hope they never are on the jury for a rape case  Edit: words
Browns,3832ad,hatmantc,2,Mon Jun 1 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah MAYBE...Johnny should've used a bit of restraint, yes this SOMEWHAT comes with the ""Johnny Football"" persona, but I will say this:  Put yourself in his shoes. Imagine having it in the back of your head that everytime you go in public, there will likely be SOMEONE whose day has been devoted to making you look bad or ruining your day. That has to be maddening. If someone pushed my buttons, no matter how famous I was or what position I was in, I would be irritated as fuck. God only knows how many times this has happened before, with Johnny using restraint when cameras weren't around to capture it. I firmly believe this persona got wayyyy too big for Johnny to control, it exploded overnight. Got much more than he bargained for. He even said shit got way too crazy after he won the Heisman.   So yes, maybe control yourself better, but I really cant say I would do so in his situation."
Browns,3832ad,dring_round,2,Mon Jun 1 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah his reaction was fine.  I'm just glad that alcohol wasn't involved.  It's not his temper that ruined JM's rookie year, it was the alcohol and bars, staying up late and partying, doing the bare minimum work required of a QB."
Browns,3832ad,sonicmerlin,2,Mon Jun 1 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"I hate watching PTI.  Michael Wilbon completely hates the Browns and Johnny Manziel.  Their job is to talk about sports and the relevant stories and they act like anything to do with Johnny is gives them anal warts.  Sorry dickholes at ESPN, Johnny's on the Browns, get over it."
Browns,3832ad,MonarchStarcrack,0,Mon Jun 1 14:53:17 2015 UTC,"All I want to know is, did he hit the guy right in the numbers?"
Browns,3832ad,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Mon Jun 1 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"He missed the guy, actually, and one of Johnny's friends said ""nice throw, Johnny,"" in a sarcastic manner."
Browns,3832ad,rodion_kjd,0,Mon Jun 1 18:00:31 2015 UTC,I am more concerned with Johnny's throwing accuracy. Apparently he threw a water bottle at the guy from a few yards away and completely missed.
Browns,3832ad,oubrew,2,Mon Jun 1 15:27:37 2015 UTC,"BUT, it wasn't intercepted. SO..."
Browns,3832ad,BigWhiskeyEd,0,Mon Jun 1 22:07:20 2015 UTC,"And I know, I shouldn't be listening or watching these programs   I have no issues with the local ESPN programs like 850. It's the only saving grace that doesn't circlejerk the anti-Cleveland agenda.   That being said, Johnny is good fodder for news and everyone knows this. What else are they going to talk about for the Browns right now? Everyone looks fine at OTA's?   It's obviously a lazy story, but what else is there to talk about at this point in the off-season? No worse than the 'what type of sandwich would your QB be' threads in /r/NFL."

Browns,37zr38,JohnnyFire,13,Sun May 31 19:53:12 2015 UTC,"Feel better about incident with newest updates.  Sounds like kid was bothering him for some time and Johnny let it be, then kid went too far, tried to grab him, Johnny ""spikes"" his water bottle and is held back while someone gets security.  All fine, still wish Johnny would take his own security with him to public events, but doesn't sound like he did anything wrong here...even put up with a lot of shit before getting angry.  PS- Also pretty happy no alcohol was involved. I think we've all wondered, but if he's in Dallas with friends and at a golf course with no alcohol thats a pretty good sign."
Browns,37zr38,St0ckt0nS,17,Sun May 31 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"If you're harassing me and grab my arm, you better expect some fucking action. Johnny has every right to defend himself in situations like these, absolute nonstory"
Browns,37zr38,740Buckeye,4,Sun May 31 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"But it's Manziel...  So there are no ""nonstories"".  I'm not 100% convinced that ESPN wouldn't run a special about how he wipes his ass. Back to front vs front to back, standing vs squatting, etc. And what ever Johnny did would at first be demonized before cooler heads prevailed and stated that this is shit journalism."
Browns,37zr38,Brokewood,0,Sun May 31 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in principle. Unfortunately, Johnny is a celebrity, and when you've got that status there are just some things you can't do without the media following every aspect of it. This includes making any sort of aggressive actions toward an asshole heckler.  Remember when Joakim Noah pushed the fan in Cleveland on the way out? You can't do that shit, the media will be all over it. There's no denying that the fan was probably a huge douchebag, but you just can't throw shit at them if you're a celebrity."
Browns,37zr38,fuckingbrowns,5,Mon Jun 1 00:42:27 2015 UTC,"There's no reports other than the ""fans"" that anything was thrown AT anyone. Reports are that Johnny threw the water bottle onto the ground similar to a football spike."

Browns,37z7yd,ltshinysides,26,Mon Jun 1 02:36:31 2015 UTC,I'm more concerned with how well he threw the bottle of water.  How was his form?   Did his release look fast enough and was his footwork OK?
Browns,37z7yd,GeorgeHermanBluth,10,Sun May 31 19:11:56 2015 UTC,I'm surprised he's at least throwing. I'd have expected him to just grab the bottle and immediately start running.   A witness told police that the bottle hit a brick wall.   Damn.
Browns,37z7yd,garrisonc,5,Sun May 31 20:42:20 2015 UTC,He missed his receiver. This concerns me because it really shows he isn't throwing accurately under pressure.  An NFL franchise quarterback ought to be able to hit a punk square in the face with a water bottle.
Browns,37z7yd,NoMagic,14,Mon Jun 1 01:47:33 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of JFF, never wanted to draft him, don't think he's going to be a viable NFL leader/QB.

Browns,37z7yd,JohnStamosBRAH,7,Sun May 31 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"Disappointed he threw a water bottle. He has to be smarter than that.  Regardless of the harassment it's his job at this point to be above that. If a random loser at a Golf Tournament can rattle him, imagine what opposing defenses will say and do to get him off his game. He still has some maturing to do."
Browns,37z7yd,themitey1,3,Sun May 31 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"While that's true, we don't know the extent of the harassment. If it was something wildly excessive I can't fault him for reacting that way."

But from a celebrity perspective, you have to control yourself better.  These things happen to celebrities all the time, harassment.  You just gotta get past it.  I don't blame Johnny though.  I bet this is the last time he ever really ""acts out"" towards harassment from fans and such."

Browns,37z7yd,PrimeTimeHoyer,-5,Sun May 31 22:37:05 2015 UTC,Throwing a water bottle isn't going to sit well with the Browns. Lets hope he knew the guy like TMZ reported and its not a random 18 year old kid like others are reporting.

If that's the case I don't think much of it.  If you're 22 and friends there can be times where guys will get into a heated argument but be cool an hour later.
Browns,37z7yd,St0ckt0nS,6,Sun May 31 19:52:39 2015 UTC,Actually his friend came inbetween the fan heckling Johnny for 2 hours to head off a confrontation.  The fan was grabbing Johnny's arm and verbally insulting him.
Browns,37z7yd,St0ckt0nS,-1,Sun May 31 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Well what the fuck.  Two hours?  This reeks of stubbornness.  That guy was obviously trying to goat Johnny.  Hopefully this is minor and Johnny takes away from this that the media are wolves who are looking for him to fuck up so to next time either have security immediately or go somewhere else.  I'm not saying its right he have to move, but he's a persona who people see as being larger than life and won't stop until they get the best of him."
Browns,37z7yd,St0ckt0nS,2,Sun May 31 20:05:50 2015 UTC,Why would the police cover for Johnny?
Browns,3811o4,battle_squid,2,Mon Jun 1 01:51:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, great show. What was your favorite part?"

Browns,37y6ov,740Buckeye,19,Sun May 31 11:45:44 2015 UTC,But I thought we were a team built on competition where every reserve pushes every starter?
Browns,37y6ov,droidworkerbee,9,Sun May 31 12:11:14 2015 UTC,I can kind of see what he's saying.  We haven't exactly seen stellar results from an open QB competition where guys share time in first team reps.  If McCown is out there sucking and Manziel looks ready and more promising then he should be put in.  Until that happens we have new OC with a new offense everyone is trying to learn and swapping out QBs constantly will set that back.
Browns,37y6ov,miked1be,1 point,Sun May 31 13:42:29 2015 UTC,"As much as I was for taking Hoyer out last year, Pettine was right. They knew JFF was not what most everyone built him to be and even though Hoyer was the worst QB in the game since Cincy, JFF would have been worse.   I hope whatever forces in the FO who wanted that change now learned that the coaches know their best chance for winning. If McCown is in there and sucking I will be pissed and complain, but I will know that is our best chance."
Browns,37y6ov,bearsdriving,-2,Mon Jun 1 13:15:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Pettine did wait a bit before putting Manziel in.  It seemed like it was more of an action of getting Hoyer out of the game than getting Manziel in.  He might have just wanted to change things up hoping it might spark something because he didn't have confidence in the team under Hoyer.  Either that or he knew the season was basically over so they might as well see what they had in Manziel."

Browns,37y6ov,Jhonopolis,2,Sun May 31 13:13:33 2015 UTC,"McCown thinks a competition with Manziel would be a distraction?  I think none of this 'who starts at quarterback' nonsense matters all that much.  Or, at the very least, doesn't matter as much as the attention it gets here and elsewhere.  Neither of these guys are an Andrew Luck type talent.  Start one, or start the other.  Either way, our wins and losses this year and in subsequent years will be determined by the defense, the running game, and how well we gel as a team."
Browns,37y6ov,topper_mango,5,Sun May 31 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a guy who isn't too confident in his abilities tbh. If anything, a competition might gain the respect of some teammates and fans. Knowing that they earned the spot is hella lot more comforting than knowing that they were just handed the spot with no proof to their abilities."
Browns,37y6ov,gakule,13,Sun May 31 11:47:00 2015 UTC,"After last year, I have to disagree. What I got out of the article is 'Hey, look what happened last year with a competition between Johnny and Hoyer, chemistry was way off between multiple facets of the game that may have translated into another win or two had things not been off'.  I think that we'll probably see Manziel as the starter at some point, but maybe they're content on transitioning to him after this season and making sure he knows the play book and had worked on his mechanics. We'll just have to see, but I think that another QB competition 'just to drive competition' is a poor idea for our team right now."
Browns,37y6ov,davabran,2,Sun May 31 13:01:27 2015 UTC,"In my eyes, it's more of a Hoyer showing his true skill level and a rookie quarterback with personal issues starting behind a Swiss cheese offensive line than anything to do with team chemistry"

Spent another $3 on the correct size iron-on lettering and with a new razor blade (I have a box of them in my toolbox, about $5 for that whole box and it comes with 50 razors, so about $0.10 for the one).  So, for about $8.10 and an hour of my time, I got myself a Manziel jersey.  I'm not a fan of Johnny, but every jersey I buy, that player ends up getting dumped by the Browns within a year.  I'm seeing if this works with a homemade jersey so I can save some money."

Johnny was being harassed, went to security, left the golf course.   Not a big deal, however this is Johnny again not understanding fully that he's not a normal person. He is love/hated in his home state, half of Texas hates his guts and the idea that he'd be bothered in public in Dallas should be expected and ignored. I'm sure most celebrities get shit said to them all the time, rarely do they need security, or better yet they bring their own security instead of just hanging out with the crowd.  Johnny has to face it, every single thing he does is going to get blown up. Browns fans have to face it too. He's that guy, and it will always look worse because of the attention. People go ""Oh well you didn't see Brian Hoyer get into these situations"" and thats because nobody gave a shit to report about everything Hoyer did/does.  Its like the tabloids and going ""Wow Jennifer Aniston must be a mess she's always in the tabloids...don't see Lisa Kudrow in the tabloids ever..."" Yeah its because nobody gives a fuck about Lisa Kudrow, not that they behave differently, Kudrow doesn't get eyeballs.   Johnny gets eyeballs and thus this stuff will never stop."
Browns,37y8ji,miked1be,2,Sun May 31 14:36:35 2015 UTC,"Not a big deal, however this is Johnny again not understanding fully that he's not a normal person.   That's kind of a leap considering you have no idea what the behavior of the fan was.  He could easily have understood exactly who he was,  gotten security to prevent any further drama while he waited for his ride and left.  He completely deescalated the situation by responsibly removing himself and the only reason we know about it is because someone got a picture of him sitting in front of a couple cops.  In what way is that him not fully understanding that he's not a normal person?"
Browns,37y8ji,St0ckt0nS,-2,Sun May 31 14:59:48 2015 UTC,"Johnny should be well aware that he can't go to a very busy and very public golf tournament in Texas and not get harassed. Be it praise, autograph hunters, picture hounds, and drunk Texas fans fucking with him, all of that is to be expected.   The the fact he went to this tournament without any personal security and was so surprised that he was being bothered to the point he had to go find a security guard, would indicate to me that he was at least surprised that he got that attention. He shouldn't be at this point, especially in Texas.  I have no doubt someone said something shitty to Johnny, zero doubt about that, and if this story is right then he handled it correctly by leaving...but he also could've completely ignored it and kept moving, because he knew it was coming when he decided to go."
Browns,37y8ji,miked1be,2,Sun May 31 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"Haha, wow.  So he just can't go anywhere at all where there are other people?  You still have no idea what kind of harassment he was getting.  Maybe it was surprising because he did ignore it and people kept trying to escalate. He wasn't at a bar late at night where people would likely have alcohol boosted courage and a lack of inhibitions, he went to a golf tournament and by all indications left as soon as something off happened.  Would you rather he was in the news because another idiot, harassing fan was accusing his security guy of assault?  He walked away,  criticizing that is crazy."
Browns,37y8ji,St0ckt0nS,-2,Sun May 31 15:19:28 2015 UTC,"People get shitfaced at golf tournaments, and I don't think its crazy for him to understand that he was going to get attention one way or the other and have his own security team with him. He's in Texas for shits sake.   Thats a bad decision by him, and no he can't just go anywhere like a normal person and thats the problem. He needs to understand situations better and be more prepared.   For Johnny Manziel to just show up like a normal patron at a huge golf tournament in Texas is a lapse in judgment and not understanding the situation. He should have had his own security if he was going to be walking the grounds with the public. Thats where he's at in life and you might think thats sad for him, but thats a reality. Fail to do that and things like this will happen, over and over and over, and none of them may be his fault, but they won't stop."
Browns,37y8ji,miked1be,1 point,Sun May 31 15:24:22 2015 UTC,"Again,  how do you know what he did and didn't do?  How do you know what the fans did and didn't do?  Ask you know is that he was somewhere, got some sort of harassment and removed himself from the situation.  Again, criticizing that is crazy."
Browns,37y8ji,St0ckt0nS,-2,Sun May 31 15:28:53 2015 UTC,"Well the fact he needed to find the tournament security and wait on a car, would tell me he didn't have his own people there for protection.   If you find anything to the contrary of that let me know.  Now I'm proud of him for removing himself from the situation and it doesn't appear alcohol was involved, both are great news...however with some basic self awareness and one phone call we wouldn't even have this thread, or photos of him talking to cops with Bud Light in the picture. Being self aware and proactive is what adults do and what celebrities that keep out of the news do.   Johnny keeps showing up in the news. Regardless of it being his fault or not...or how he handled it, he's in the news because he wasn't self aware and proactive."
Browns,37y8ji,St0ckt0nS,2,Sun May 31 15:33:20 2015 UTC,"By the way you're talking to a HUGE Johnny fan. I want him to be our QB very badly, I've had to defend him over and over to friends and family and I've stuck with him and continue to stick with him and have faith in him.  But this attitude he has of ""Why can't I just live like everyone else"" has got to stop or these situations where we spend a morning wondering if he did something wrong or not will never end. He's not a normal person and can't live his life as such. He's a celebrity, and needs to learn to protect himself and image of a celebrity."
Browns,37y8ji,miked1be,2,Sun May 31 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"Or he used the police in place because he knows personal security can come into question just like the incident at his apartment last year. Apparently nothing happened because of the way he handled it. If he had personal security that even touched a harassing fan we could have that fan selling his story to TMZ about how Manziel's security assaulted him. He used the cops and security in place and avoided incident,  that's all."
Browns,37y8ji,tenfingersandtoes,4,Sun May 31 15:43:02 2015 UTC,Maybe he played some great golf?
Browns,37y8ji,SmokeyTheBear420,10,Sun May 31 14:14:15 2015 UTC,Can someone explain why people assume this is bad? Isn't Byron Nelson a golf tournament? The one Johnny pulled out of a few weeks ago because of obligations to the Browns? I doubt they'd be the ones breaking news of a Johnny relapse. If he did relapse I have a hard time imagining it was while golfing   Edit: and there you have it. Fan was harassing him
Browns,37y8ji,fdc245,2,Sun May 31 12:25:59 2015 UTC,"He's not saying from the people at Byron Nelson, he's saying something happened while Johnny was there and it's going to get out."
Browns,37y8ji,fuckingbrowns,-5,Sun May 31 12:30:26 2015 UTC,Can someone explain why people assume this is bad?   Because this is not the first time that Johnny has had issues with fans while alcohol is involved.
Browns,37y8ji,SmokeyTheBear420,1 point,Sun May 31 14:54:24 2015 UTC,How else should he have handled either of those situations?
Browns,37y8ji,fuckingbrowns,-4,Sun May 31 14:56:34 2015 UTC,By not putting himself in this position time and time again? Don't see any of the other QBs from his draft class dealing with this shit.
Browns,37y8ji,Marzman315,1 point,Sun May 31 15:01:23 2015 UTC,Sow when he's not practicing he should just lock himself in a dark room to avoid being bothered by fans?
Browns,37y8ji,fuckingbrowns,-5,Sun May 31 15:53:01 2015 UTC,"Guy is a first round pick last year and behind Josh fucking McCown on the depth chart. Thats unacceptable. So yes, he should lock himself up until he locks down that starting job."
Browns,37y8ji,nickyxpants,1 point,Sun May 31 15:57:00 2015 UTC,Do you have a problem with him going to church?
Browns,37y8ji,fuckingbrowns,0,Sun May 31 19:27:37 2015 UTC,His being at church has nothing to do with what happened at the golf course. It's a statement made only to make Manziel look better.
Browns,37y8ji,Marzman315,1 point,Sun May 31 21:43:44 2015 UTC,You have a problem.
Browns,37y8ji,ChairyCweed,0,Sun May 31 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"None of the quarterbacks from his draft class are as popular or as talked about as him. Come on dude, think a little."
Browns,37y8ji,fuckingbrowns,-4,Sun May 31 15:08:13 2015 UTC,The reason he's a bigger celebrity is because he's known for partying off the field. He brought it upon himself.

Browns,37y8ji,HelloStranger9,1 point,Sun May 31 12:16:00 2015 UTC,If he is drinking is it a relapse or only if he got drunk?
Browns,37y8ji,miked1be,1 point,Sun May 31 13:14:28 2015 UTC,"well if your speaking about the NFL rules he never failed anything so he's allowed to drink. If your speaking about rehab, we don't really know what he went in for but if it was alcohol then any drink of anything would be considered bad. But again, we still have no idea what he got treatment for."
Browns,37y8ji,miked1be,0,Sun May 31 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily,  by entering rehab the NFL can choose to enter him in the substance abuse program.  Haven't heard of they have or not though.  That's not something they really announce."
Browns,37y8ji,SadBrownsFan7,2,Sun May 31 14:05:38 2015 UTC,He entered voluntarily. They can only move him into the program if the rehab is court ordered i.e part of some criminal case or plea agreement.
Browns,37y8ji,fdc245,1 point,Sun May 31 14:12:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough,  I didn't know it was spelled out like that."
Browns,37y8ji,fdc245,1 point,Sun May 31 14:17:39 2015 UTC,Most people who are alcoholics and start drinking again dont have that slow down/stop button meaning they drink get smashed and it is a full on relapse. Some guys eventually figure it out and can become casual drinkers. Id say considering how recently he has come out of rehab. Its a relapse. But again this can all be open to opinion on whether his goal was to stop drinking completely or just learn to control it which really defines what is considered a relapse.  (just my opinion as someone with alcoholics in the family/close friend group)

Also, the report of him throwing a water bottle is supposedly at a friend.  Throwing a water bottle at a friend is way different than throwing a water bottle at some stranger antagonizing you.

Browns,37qzjm,DeuceBuggalo,3,Fri May 29 20:01:16 2015 UTC,Hey friends what is the difference between Backers and the Dawg Pound?
Browns,37qzjm,DeuceBuggalo,3,Sat May 30 05:20:26 2015 UTC,"The TL;DR:  Dawg Pound I was the cheap seats of Cleveland Municipal Stadium that crazy people sat in. Think Oakland's Black Hole. It was monikered by Hanford Dixon, and adopted by the fan base.  Dawg Pound II were the seats behind one endzone with bleacher style seating as opposed to actual seats. It was supposed to be the carry over from the old stadium, but something was lost in translation.  Dawg Pound III is the newest regimes attempt to turn the whole stadium into the dawg pound. Make it so that all Browns Fans represent the Dawg Pound.  Compared to the Browns Backers which are designated spots (normally bars) all around the globe that agree to show Browns games whenever they're on. Cleveland is a dispersed city, especially after all of the steel mills closed down. People left to find work. The one thing that held together a lot of extended families, and maintained a connection to the dispersed hometown, was the Browns. Add into that, our old owner, Randy Lerner, owned Aston Villa.... So he also sold Browns paraphernalia around the globe."
Browns,37qzjm,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Sat May 30 15:00:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't consider the disparate city angle. My hometown (Edmonton, Canada) is very similar and it's the Oilers filling the role of social glue there.  Anytime a team moves it is brutal on the fanbase, but from the angle you describe it must have been completely devastating when the Browns left. Glad y'all are back! My best bud is a Browns fan which is why I sub here."
Browns,37qzjm,DeuceBuggalo,2,Sat May 30 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"The Browns Backers are an official fan club with chapters all across the country (and in other countries), typically created for the purpose of gathering together to watch Browns games.  I am part of the Triple Cities Browns Backers in upstate NY. There is about 20-30 of us who meet at a local bar to wach every game. We also take a trip each year to Cleveland for a home game."

Browns,37sroq,wickedshxt,2,Sat May 30 22:11:41 2015 UTC,That'll be nice if they knock the preseason down to like 20 bucks.  It's such a ramjob having to pay regular season prices for a worthless game that is just an all around bad experience.
Browns,37sroq,fear865,3,Sat May 30 07:39:31 2015 UTC,On the flip side they better not jack up prices too much. For the tier 1 games
Browns,37sroq,vousaimezmike,1 point,Sat May 30 13:33:14 2015 UTC,"I hope they do, actually. The goal is to mirror (somewhat closely) the secondary market. I can sell my $60 ticket in the upper dawg pound for over $100 for every home opener, so I would expect face value to be around $90 for the tier one games, and $30 for the preseason games. This might actually help people actually purchase preseason tickets."
Browns,37sroq,wickedshxt,1 point,Sat May 30 16:53:01 2015 UTC,"Also, for season ticket holders this is good in that we are limited from selling below face value on NFL Ticket Exchange (which made selling preseason impossible)."
Browns,37sroq,vousaimezmike,1 point,Sat May 30 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have any impact on the season ticket pricing though.  The money they take off the value of preseason they'll just add onto other games, so I don't see a major change occurring.  It's always been possible to get tickets to preseason games for about $5-8 on Craigslist/StubHub (or free if you know a season ticket holder) regardless of pricing."
Browns,37pyfe,bearsdriving,104,Fri May 29 14:00:29 2015 UTC,"""a battle with something that defeated him""  I've been trying to put my finger on why I hate this article, and I think I have.   What I'm saying now has nothing to do with the Browns. It has everything to do with working with and helping people who've struggled with substance abuse, for friends and family who have faced the stigma and obstacles society presents them through a lens of misunderstanding:  Fuck you, Tony.   This is the old-school insulting approach to mental illness and substance abuse. ""Something that defeated him"". That grinds my fucking gears to dust. You cannot be ""defeated"" by a mental illness. It's like saying ""Hey, fuck that guy, he's sick and was defeated by the flu!"" Naw. Fuck Tony. This has nothing to do with Johnny and everything to do with a smug dinosaur of a reporter that doesn't know how the world works on any level, let alone sports."

Browns,37pyfe,PrimeTimeHoyer,31,Sat May 30 01:20:14 2015 UTC,"You're not alone in thinking that way.   This is the pièce de résistance of the entire piece. Not only does this comment clash wildly with the comments from the team about how hard Manziel has worked, but it's also an insult to those who have battled personal demons. The public doesn't know the details about what Manziel has struggled with and eventually committed himself to rehab over. Claiming that the issue ""defeated"" him is an insult to all those who have sought help for addiction or mental illness. Manziel may never succeed as an NFL quarterback, but do not assume that his struggles to develop are because he was ""defeated"" by personal battles. The reality is that a successful stint in rehab is a success, even if it doesn't translate into capability in a chosen career."
Browns,37pyfe,miked1be,-68,Fri May 29 16:03:26 2015 UTC,Johnny's lottery ticket was about to blow away. Some PR rehab bought him some time. He's not an NFL QB.

Browns,37pyfe,theedeacon,12,Fri May 29 21:47:39 2015 UTC,"You get the same thing with cancer. ""The fight against cancer."" Well, my relatives fought cancer and lost. Does that somehow make them less of a person? No, they had a terrible disease and no measure of fighting would have done that."
Browns,37pyfe,droidworkerbee,4,Fri May 29 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"Worked with a hospice, so I did think of this initially. To that, I can only say that people speak like this about deceased individuals. It makes no sense to be angry if someone who has died ""lost the battle"", but it's a different connotation to say that they were ""defeated"". Also, my main point on this: Johnny isn't dead. Society gives up on people with substance abuse issues, so saying that they're defeated is more of the wrong status quo. They're still here. They're still alive. They can succeed.  You only lose when you quit. Johnny didn't quit and neither do millions of others who suffer."
Browns,37pyfe,blackedout,3,Fri May 29 16:14:03 2015 UTC,Wonder if you worked where my aunt spent her last days on the inner west side.
Browns,37pyfe,droidworkerbee,2,Fri May 29 16:32:30 2015 UTC,No. I volunteered to help the nurses and do fundraising after I cared for my grandmother in her home until she passed. Cancer is a helluva thing. I was glad they were there.
Browns,37pyfe,blackedout,7,Fri May 29 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%.    It's a stupid thing to say, at best, and incredibly insensitive and inappropriate."
Browns,37pyfe,wardsac,-1,Fri May 29 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair... the context may be different than you think. It isn't that it ""defeated"" him as a person, but that it may have defeated his chances with the NFL.   It's sad, and tragic, and it is often the case with substance abuse. People can have their lives ruined by addiction or mental illness, and while they may overcome these problems, they may have missed out on important things in their lives during their struggle.  I think that could be what is meant. But I also am a Steelers fan (and didn't read the entire article), so I could be wrong."
Browns,37pyfe,Synectics,0,Fri May 29 18:37:36 2015 UTC,"What do you expect? We are talking about a sports writer here, everything said will be couched in martial metaphors.

And as a football organization, we have games to play and games to win.  This has everything to do with putting the best player on the field to do that regardless of what they're doing in their personal life.   Grossi isn't a dinosaur reporter.  He's a life long Browns fan who's cared way more about the Browns than you have in your life.  He's seen more crap than you've had to deal with, and has probably kept a ton of things under his hat he isn't even journalistically allowed to say.  Maybe its time you figure out how the world works, isntead of passing judgement on a reporter who's obviously much more plugged in to the scene than you.  Johnny is allowed to struggle with substance abuse, and he even in the article sort of gives him an out by saying anyone would have similar problems.  And no where does he say johnny rehab can't recover.  Just that(FROM THE ARTICLE:)"" Manziel’s skills don’t coincide with what the Browns are asking of their quarterback.""  Which is 10000% true.  Manziel plays dangerously.  They didn't build the offense and bring in the players they did to run a wide open dangerous offense.  You can't have a guy who's going to take risks in this offense."
Browns,37pyfe,djroomba322,5,Fri May 29 17:46:47 2015 UTC,Serious: are you Tony Grossi?  It would make so much sense.
Browns,37pyfe,Dinowhaleball,-7,Fri May 29 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"Why would that make sense? I think banner was great, grossi does not.  I think Lombardi helped our team a ton, grossi does not.  So in your tiny view of the world, you see over issue two people have a common similarly based on common sense and logic, and you immediately jump to ridiculous conclusions?

Browns,37pyfe,blackedout,12,Fri May 29 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"Eh, these are OTAs and they're still trying to get everyone from the HC down gelled in their completely brand new offense.  I can see them wanting a guy like McCown that'll be more than willing to safely stay behind a strong offensive line while the rest of the offense figures shit out before injecting someone that could make plays and be a little more dynamic (once and if he's ready).  I understand that Manziel probably hasn't looked good but again, these are just OTAs.  Maybe he won't succeed but it's far too early to say stuff like this right now.

Browns,37pyfe,Daviroth,7,Mon Jun 1 02:50:56 2015 UTC,"Grossi's gotta pay the rent somehow.   The first week of Browns OTAs was a revelation of where the team is going offensively and who is going to lead them ... They are, by all appearances, moving on.   Yeah.  In May.  After a couple of days of OTAs, we have a ""revelation.""  Hahhahahahahhaha.  I mean, whatever, if they're going to roll with McCown and show Johnny the door, I'm fine with that.  In fact, I probably have more confidence in McCown than most.  But it's fucking May 29th.  There are no goddamn ""revelations.""  At this point Grossi's just another goober fan with a throbbing boner for Hoyer and he ain't gonna be happy until Manziel pays for running our Hometown Mr. Hero out of town."
Browns,37pyfe,TapedeckNinja,1 point,Fri May 29 17:00:53 2015 UTC,The Hoyer Boner needs to die.  It's like all of Cleveland took a Cialis with #6 on it and no amount of facts and history will convince them the guy plain sucks.
Browns,37pyfe,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Sat May 30 21:28:44 2015 UTC,I would not say Hoyer sucked. He is a pretty high quality backup who can come in for a couple of games a year and hold his own IF the rest of the offense does as well. Weeden sucks. Weeden and Hoyer are worlds apart imo.
Browns,37pyfe,Daviroth,23,Mon Jun 1 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"Just a question to Grossi, who was saying that the Browns were ever trying to reinvent Manziel? I thought the idea was that they wanted cocky son-of-a-bitch play-maker spread-offense-running rocket-arm Manziel? They want a run-first in-your-face offense; hell, they even shored up the offensive line and drafted yet another RB to do so. The guy handing off the ball needs to be just as active in the backfield and I don't particularly see McCown as a wiry spry motherfucker at this point in his career.  Now, does that mean that Johnny fits or can succeed? Fuck if I know. But it's also May 29th and we haven't seen the influence of the new OC or the new pieces in play. So I don't know. The idea of doom-and-glooming the Browns here just doesn't phase me yet, because we're still 3 months out, and a lot can change in that time; hell, our QB could end up being Connor Shaw, Destroyer of Worlds by the time we're done."
Browns,37pyfe,JohnnyFire,11,Fri May 29 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"Why can't we just wait and see how the Johnny situation plays out, it's not even June, everyone needs to calm their tits."

Browns,37pyfe,aPersonOfInterest,-2,Fri May 29 16:56:13 2015 UTC,I'm skeptical of his motivations. His character has been in question.
Browns,37pyfe,aPersonOfInterest,-2,Fri May 29 20:36:02 2015 UTC,Celebs in PR rehab is mindblowing?
Browns,37pyfe,aPersonOfInterest,5,Fri May 29 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing anyone in the Browns organization who wanted a ""cocky son-of-a-bitch play-maker spread-offense-running rocket-arm Manziel"" has seen enough of him (and our defense) to realize that our best chance of winning is a game manager QB."
Browns,37pyfe,MethLab,4,Fri May 29 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"Well, no, our best chance of winning is to draft the right QB at the right time in the right position that we can develop the correct way over a number of years and lock them down long term while building the correct team around them to make them a ""franchise"" guy, regardless of the their style of play, size, ability, background or persona.  And if we've reached the point where people are so anti-Manziel that they're going to just say ""Well, McCown is a solid game manager"", please explain how well he managed a team which actually had offensive weapons to 1-10. If you say Manziel is a shitty option, fine, but don't attempt to qualify our other options in 2015 as highly superior.  So yeah, the Browns wanted a cult of personality out of Manziel; I trust them to figure out what he actually has, but I would imagine even they have to know that we can't move into 2016 without seeing if there's anything there. You have to get some kind of return on your investment, even if that investment is shit."
Browns,37pyfe,JohnnyFire,1 point,Fri May 29 21:31:57 2015 UTC,"While your idea of our best chance of winning is a solid one, it doesn't explain what you do when you realize you didn't draft a ""franchise"" guy.  Because if I understand you correctly, you're saying that you (a fan) can know more about Manziel by seeing him play a few games, than the coaching staff has learned by watching him in practice (and games) for going on 2 seasons?  By stating that Manziel is a backup, it appears to be clear that the Browns don't believe Manziel gives us the best chance to win this season or going forward.  I'm not defending McCown.  He's probably not going to be very good, but for some reason the coaches still believe he is a better option than Manziel.  And I don't think that is anti-Manziel bias, just a decision based on performance."
Browns,37pyfe,MethLab,2,Fri May 29 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, you or whoever, can someone show me a quote where Mike Pettine, Ray Farmer, or whoever explicitly said ""Johnny Manziel is our backup for Week 1""? I don't say that to be facetious, I really want to know where the actual quote is.  Second, you're missing the point. I don't know better, but how in the fuck are we saying that after two OTA's that Manziel is done? How does Grossi know that much better? Isn't the consensus on Grossi that he's gained a bit of a reputation as a pot-stirrer just to stir the pot anyway? We have 3 whole months to dissect this stuff, and there are people honestly believing that this won't go back and forth and up and down for the next 3 months as it is. And if you think the mentality that we have now can't change in 3 months (not even just on the coaches behalf, but on the behalf of the collective group think) by the actions of Manziel, McCown, and anyone else, well, fair enough I guess."
Browns,37pyfe,JohnnyFire,1 point,Fri May 29 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"Quote    Browns head coach Mike Pettine declared Josh McCown the team's number one quarterback.

Browns,37pyfe,MethLab,1 point,Fri May 29 16:50:11 2015 UTC,"Yep.  He's going to be the starter for camp.  No mention of week one like JohnnyFire requested.  All media sources took the quote that he was the starter going into camp, and then ran with it, leaving out the camp part.  I highly suggest you go watch the video interview when he says it on clevelandbrowns.com.  It helps put it in perspective."
Browns,37pyfe,themitey1,18,Fri May 29 17:48:27 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who feels a large part of our hometown media just loves trashing everything the Browns do or don't do? Is it like this with every team? Every Grossi article is something about the Browns being wrong and we should all pack it in before the season starts. Maybe once they should try telling me about a rookie who has impressed and not Johnny who we all agree there's no telling what will happen before the season.

Browns,37pyfe,fuckingbrowns,27,Fri May 29 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"I've accepted a reality where Manziel doesn't play a snap, but I'd rather he at least did play to confirm that he's shit first to the fanbase rather than just go ""WELL, HE LOOKED GOOD/BAD IN PRACTICE/FOR TWO PLAYS/ON THAT ONE DRIVE/IN COLLEGE/SOMETIMES.""  I still, even if Johnny is awful, don't see the benefit in not at least putting him on the field at some point. At least let me, with my own two stupid eyes, see that he sucks for sure. Anyone can shout that the Bengals game should have been enough proof for anyone, but I'm a man who values sample size just as much as the results; otherwise we'd be touting Matt Schaub as amazing because he was above average for a few seasons.  I'm not going to come in here and defend Johnny; I don't have a leg to stand on. I'm also not going to shout that he's good enough, because I don't know. I just want to actually know from something more than an editorial on this one before the Browns are looking at Jones/Cook/Hackenberg/Goff/Kiel next year."
Browns,37pyfe,JohnnyFire,4,Fri May 29 17:46:10 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I'd say later on in the season would be probably best.  A lot of people are saying it wouldn't benefit the team at all to start McCown over Manziel week 1.  This is an offense, OC, and HC that are all figuring out a brand new offensive scheme.  How is putting a guy in week 1 (if he's not ready and can't run the offense quite yet) more beneficial than a vet that's accustomed to the NFL and can at least serviceably manage the offense while the rest of the guys on the field are still learning it?   That said, let the offense play some games, let them all figure shit out, and if they believe Manziel can at least get out there and play then give him his shot."
Browns,37pyfe,miked1be,1 point,Fri May 29 14:12:55 2015 UTC,The only benefit of not putting him out there is if mccown gives us a better chance to win. NFL players are competitive they don't want to sit around and let manziel grow into a qb he may or may not become. If they are both equals you start manziel if mccown gives you better chance of succeeding you start him just for the team.
Browns,37pyfe,chris101010,-2,Fri May 29 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"Football had all of camp and the first 10ish games to get ready. He came out and shit the bed. 6th rd talent with 1st rd hype. Your ""own two stupid eyes"" already confirmed the obvious."
Browns,37pyfe,aPersonOfInterest,10,Fri May 29 14:49:27 2015 UTC,"Me:   rather than just go ""WELL, HE LOOKED GOOD/BAD IN PRACTICE/FOR TWO PLAYS/ON THAT ONE DRIVE/IN COLLEGE/SOMETIMES.""   You, implying over a few games:   He came out and shit the bed.   Look, if you don't like Manziel, that's fine. I don't even really like Manziel that much as it is.  But we know he didn't give a shit last year. I don't know if he truly does even give a shit this year, but I would rather bank on him doing so then doing nothing.  How about we, you know, wait out training camp and see what happens? Because, like I said below, who the fuck knows? McCown could tear his ACL, Manziel could go back on the bottle, hell, we could end up with Connor Shaw as our starter. There's over 3 months of stuff to get through before we can start reigning in non anecdotal or editorial judgement. If he doesn't win the starting spot, fine, give it to McCown and let's be stagnant and plan for our guy next year. But if he shows even a goddamned flash, then fucking pull the trigger. Maybe he sucks, so what? Put McCown back in. This isn't a Tebow situation where he had a ton of tape to verify to me, the guy who isn't generalizing through editorials and isn't watching the OTA's and training camp every freaking day, that he was never going to be the guy. Manziel may never be the guy, but you have to be 100% sure of that fact before you fish or cut bait, because (AND I AM NOT SAYING THAT MANZIEL WILL BE AS GOOD AS ANY OF THESE PLAYERS) Brett Favre threw 4 passes for 2 interceptions in Atlanta in 1991; hell, in 2003, several years into his career, Drew Brees threw 11 TD's to 15 interceptions and nearly saw the whole ship sink.  You just don't know, until you really fucking know."
Browns,37pyfe,JohnnyFire,2,Fri May 29 19:46:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't compare Manziel to those QBs.  Obviously Favre and Brees coaches saw enough talent and promise that the coaches felt comfortable playing them even though they were young and raw. Your case would be better made if you could find an example of a player who was a bench warmer until they got some playing time and then took off.  When you say you need to see Manziel play, you are implying that the coaching staff can't tell if a player is good enough to play from watching practice.  I fully believe that if the coaches thought Manziel was up for it, he would get his chance.  If they think he would do more harm than good, he'll sit."
Browns,37pyfe,MethLab,4,Fri May 29 15:32:49 2015 UTC,If you're going to judge a guys career based on one bad game as a rookie it's a lot more than your eyes that are stupid.

I don't argue with your type anymore. Carry on."
Browns,37pyfe,Marzman315,-8,Fri May 29 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"man who values sample size just as much as the results;   I mean, you literally have 3 years of sample size where he did absolutely nothing that compares to what NFL QBs do.  He has never once shown a single iota of NFL QB talent.  He's shown ""Johnny Ball"".   I think NFL games are too few and too precious to throw away on ""lets just throw him out there and see if he sucks""  Because again the problem is, he's going to suck.  And if he's going to be successful, its going to take two to three years of him sucking first.  Because he's that far behind.  You will not have enough information to form a solid opinion if he somehow stays healthy and plays 16 games.   You'll have a better idea, but you won't know.    So buy in for 3 years of suck, or cut bait and find someone who can actually have a future with the organization.  Half measures help no one."

He's just saying that he hopes that's what happens because it'll make him feel better about the evaluation and result of Manziel either being kept or cast aside.  To me it looks like it's just a personal preference.
Browns,37pyfe,miked1be,2,Fri May 29 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"...so what you're saying is, people shouldn't hop out and make judgements on the play of someone or the ability of someone when they're in no power to do so.

Browns,37pyfe,rockjones,4,Fri May 29 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with the realities that Manziel may never amount to crap. It would suck to waste the high pick, but I've dealt with that enough times over the years. I do have a problem with Grossi drawing these sweeping conclusions that it is over for him. After his play last year and rehab in the offseason, the team had no choice but to ""move on."" That doesn't mean he's been cut, doesn't mean he can't win the job. He's basically in the same position as every other non-bonafide QB in the league. You want it, you gotta earn it. I don't think anyone is Berea has an agenda to anything other than winning games and letting the best guys play. Grossi always likes to make things seem so personal, it irritates me."
Browns,37pyfe,RealFuryous,2,Fri May 29 14:52:06 2015 UTC,"... And? The reality of the situation is simple: until we have a solid starting QB no one is safe. Johnny has to learn the same offense everyone else does and none of his actions last season suggest he deserves preferential treatment. If Johnny sucks so bad then sign Mark Myers out of JCU and let him hold a clipboard.  With that said, talk to let's reevaluate Johnny's progress after the third preseason game."
Browns,37pyfe,DayvyT,2,Fri May 29 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"I hope Johnny has the mental maturity to ignore the negative press and just play ball.  Look at what Lebron did this year, all the negative reports from the media in november and december about how the Cavs were collapsing and then he said in interviews ""Calm your tits, we got this"" (paraphrasing) And he lead them to the motherfucking NBA Finals. I've heard Manziel has been in touch with Lebron's camp and I hope some of this mental maturity to focus and ignore the press is rubbing off on him"

Coach placed him at 2, and is making him earn it. He feels he's above Lewis and Shaw, and that's good enough progress for me to feel that Pettine knows what he's doing, and Johnny has work to do.  I'll wait until August on this one. Tony likes a good headline."

He's the only guy on the roster who even resembles a long-term solution. If he's a bust and McCown is McCown, this could be a very, very long season no matter how many picks we invested on defense."

Hoyer was absolutely awful in the second half of the season.  His last eight starts gave us 1,968 yards, 4 TDs, 11 INTs, and 52.53% completions.  At a glance, I don't think McCown's had a stretch of starts that bad in his entire mediocre career.  I honestly don't know that our QB play can possibly be any worse than it was in the second half of 2014, when Hoyer fell apart and Manziel looked like a deer in the headlights."

The reality is it was commissioned by Banner and finished shortly after he left the organization.

Also, the team will get a compensatory pick for getting him and letting Hoyer walk.    That said, I'm certainly not too thrilled about him being the best option we had available for what the team wanted.  He's not exactly a proven talent, he's been mediocre at best his entire career but I don't think he's nearly as bad as some Tampa fans would want you to believe.

Also, with our defense looking to be top 5, we shouldn't have to score that many points on offense to keep us in games."
Browns,37r7kc,Doyle524,2,Fri May 29 23:16:05 2015 UTC,"Cmon man, you can only make excuses for a guy for so long.  He's been in the league for 13 years."
Browns,37r7kc,wickedshxt,-4,Sat May 30 00:53:38 2015 UTC,"Fluke year?  he played 5 games and lost 2 of them with 3 elite offensive weapons and good oline play.    In 12 years of being in the NFL he's thrown for over 2k yards twice and his highest TD total is 13 in a year.  Good freaking lord.  we'll obviously root for him, but he's going to be 36, you don't suddenly go from 2500 yards and 13 TDs to quality QB with no offensive weapons and being way past your ""prime""."
Browns,37r7kc,djroomba322,1 point,Fri May 29 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"Not really sure what you're freaking out about.  I put the fluke part in there because everyone talks about how great a year he had in Chicago.  For the record I think he's awful and I don't expect much this year.  Sure I'll root for the guy, he is a Brown after all, but I already am considering this year to just be an excuse to get drunk on Sunday's, nothing more."
Browns,37r7kc,wickedshxt,-5,Fri May 29 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"Freaking out? Not freaking out.  It wasn't a good year.  he had 5 ok games.  Like Holcomb.  Like everyone else who has a modicum of success because their play is unexpected, their tendencies are revealed, and then they go back to shit.   but I already am considering this year to just be an excuse to get drunk on Sunday's, nothing more.   Which is why its so frustrating that this front office decided to throw it away.  This is the shit that causes Mack to want to leave."
Browns,37r7kc,djroomba322,2,Fri May 29 20:44:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think McCown's very good, but he's a good athlete, he's mobile, and he has (historically, by the numbers) played pretty well when pressured.  In the end, I don't think his results will be much different from what we would've seen with Hoyer, he just gets it done (or not) in a different way.  To me, his skill-set is a much better match in terms of being a mentor for Manziel.  He's also much more interchangeable with Manziel as a piece in the offense.  I'll take McCown + a 5th round pick over Hoyer for sure.  Of all the guys who were potentially available (Fitzmagic, Cassell, Hoyer, McCown, Sanchez), I'd probably have picked Fitzmagic over the rest, but again, he's a totally different kind of QB and doesn't really fit the same scheme that Manziel does.  Plus, he's got some serious squeakyfloor skills, too."

If quarterbacks won games, Dan Fouts would have been the greatest quarterback of all time, but teams win games, and I think he'll give us a good shot... at the very least as good as Hoyer ever did."

It's the inference, pure and simple.   He hasn't ever said ""Johnny won't start"" or that ""Josh is starting week 1 of the season"".  Here's the interview where he talks about this: http://youtu.be/5R63Kz3TbrQ  MKC had the first crack at the story, and she went OVERLY negative in her reaction piece here: http://youtu.be/TOnvz4EZiBo  She takes Pettine's comments on face to mean that he's literally ""Closing the door"". What's telling, is that Pettine very carefully chose how he phrased his responses, leaving room for Johnny.  MKC didn't see it."
Browns,37qw8k,ScottoGato,1 point,Fri May 29 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"several people seem to note that the coaching staff has already decided that Manziel won't start in 2015   Nope, and it would be ridiculous for Pettine to have said that.  Johnny will get his opportunities to take the #1 spot from preseason and throughout the season.    I'm sure, however, that they are comfortable going into the preseason with McCown.  DiFilippo was McCown's QB Coach in 2007 with the Raiders.  That will give some stability to start the preseason (and most likely the regular season)."

Browns,37lghh,Cavanaughk5,3,Thu May 28 16:40:59 2015 UTC,I have to disagree. Campus is the only place in columbus that seems mostly Browns fans. Go to Grove City or Hilliard. Mostly steeler fans out there.

You'd think Columbus, being farther away from Pittsburgh and smack dab in between Cleveland and Columbus, would be even more heavily Browns/Bengals."
Browns,37lghh,AKlep,4,Thu May 28 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"That's because it is. I go to OSU as well, and it is definitely primarily Browns/Bengals.

I think having good people on the field, no matter where they are, best available kind of players is good.  I think they liked him, liked his versatility, how he was able to play.  He's played a lot of different positions.  Having another guy, smart guy, is gonna help the team in general.  Reporter:  What about the ""if Alex Mack doesn't come back next year part of that?""  (he didn't answer that part on purpose, idiot)  Mack:  laughs defer    He was also asked why no other deal was done before the transition tag or something along those lines and told them that was an agent question.  Basically he tried to skirt a question politely that they knew he wasn't going to answer and they pressed it anyway because they need their useless sound bites."

The Browns didn't approach Mack with an offer last offseason and made what he believed to be a ""cursory effort"" during the 2013 season.   From Rapoport:   Positive for #Browns: Much better chance of retaining star C Alex Mack. He’ll still test FA. With old regime, he was gone.

You're probably new here, but people here thought Farmer was a genius for letting the jags do the contract for him.  Same with Gipson.  And He was given time from farm,(as you previously pointed out) that he wanted answers from the front office (Farmer).  He was not worked with, wasn't given the answers, and so he, an all pro center is now going to leave."

After his February 2014 front-office blowup, owner Jimmy Haslam put a full-court press on Mack. Haslam arrived at Mack’s southern California home with his new coaches, his new GM and his top contract negotiator. The Browns expected to sign Mack on the spot, but Mack deferred."

You go find another team willing to pay that much and we'll match it, but we're not going to give you that much.  This is really, really simple. Of course he deferred.  he knows the quality of Farmer, Haslam, and the rest of the front office and team.  Why WOULDN'T he defer?  Because they brought a fancy plane out?  MACK SAID PAY ME THIS MUCH AND THEY SAID NO.   The fact is, if we were a quality organization with quality front office guys then mack would stay. Simple as that.  The fact he wants out is telling.  And the fact we're doing the same thing to Gipson, is again, telling."
Browns,37lcqi,djroomba322,7,Thu May 28 17:17:48 2015 UTC,"if we were a quality organization with quality front office guys then mack would stay   You mean like Jacksonville?   A league source monitoring the Mack proceedings intently said of Jacksonville's participation, ""Nothing genius happened here. This was a comedy of errors.""  Asked what the Jaguars could have done within league rules to get the Browns not to match, the source said, ""Guarantee the whole deal for five years.""   Sounds like a real ""quality organization with quality front office guys"".  *In reality, you have absolutely no idea what went on behind closed doors at these contract negotiations (and neither do we).  You don't even provide any sources backing up your assessment of what happened."
Browns,37lcqi,TopHatAbobo,2,Thu May 28 17:24:04 2015 UTC,Hold on sec.... We're doing the same thing to Gipson? How so? I mean Gipson had a pretty bad injury last year. The kind of injury someone could lose a step from. I don't think it would be wise to throw a bunch of money at someone who could have lost a step then we would be overpaying for someone who isn't at that level anymore.
Browns,37lcqi,KegmanZulu,-6,Thu May 28 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"So either A) the FO gets yelled at for signing a guy per my previous comment, or B) they get yelled at for giving a guy who's had mulitple great seasons their due.  So what's the problem?"
Browns,37lcqi,djroomba322,5,Thu May 28 18:22:46 2015 UTC,But if he loses a piece of the skill set that helped him become the player that deserves a big ass contract and he now can't preform at that level why would he be payed? That's why the browns camp probably wants a show me deal and they have every justification in doing so. You complain all the time about how we over-payed for McCown so why would you want to overpay a player who could very well be bad at his position now due to injury?
Browns,37lcqi,KegmanZulu,3,Thu May 28 18:34:01 2015 UTC,"And the fact we're doing the same thing to Gipson, is again, telling.   I don't understand.  Are you saying that we need to lock Gipson into a long-term deal before he becomes an unrestricted free agent?"

There is a way to be critical, and correct misinformation. And then there is how you handle things.   I think it is fair to say that there are many things that happen inside the Browns organization that we don't know the reasoning nor background information for. You can speculate all you like as to why exactly Mack didn't sign or whether Ray farmed ""made"" Jacksonville write the contract for him. But that is all it is, speculation."

In fact none of them are.  Only when responding to people who have been dickheads in the past I let them see the error of their ways.     I think it is fair to say that there are many things that happen inside the Browns organization that we don't know the reasoning nor background information for.   And that's fair to say.  All we know is Mack had an offer and the Browns refused match what he wanted and let the market dictate his future salary.  And that's all you need to know."

Some people called it genius, others were upset that a deal couldn't be worked out prior.    I let them see the error of their ways   It is in the manner in which you do this that sets the perception. And to be sure, to you, nothing will seem like you are a dickhead.   We also know that Mack was made an offer by the Browns and he deferred. Any more than that is mere speculation."
Browns,37lcqi,Baconaholic,1 point,Thu May 28 18:52:55 2015 UTC,We also know that Mack was made an offer by the Browns and he deferred   By every imaginable account it was a lowball offer.  We do know 100% that Mack asked for a rate and was denied by the Browns.

And that's all you need to know.   Actually, we (and you) don't even know if THAT is true.  You just assume that MUST be the case since you can't envision a different scenario.  You're once again performing an argument from ignorance fallacy."
Browns,37lcqi,TopHatAbobo,6,Thu May 28 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"No. Ray Farmer was the one who said ""No, we won't work with you, go on the market and get fair value"".   Source on the bold part here? (or are you just going to pretend you have me on RES ignore again?  Do I have to mention Greg Little to get you to respond?)   You're probably new here, but people here thought Farmer was a genius for letting the jags do the contract for him.   Condescending and entirely irrelevant.   an all pro center is now going to leave   Even if he does, he was on the team for 2 years longer than he would've been had Banner / Lombardi still been in charge."

He's under contract, and if he tries to sit out its no different than the past two years. Plus he's one failed test from another big suspension.   Really, even if he wants out of Cleveland, his only real option is to stay clean and play his ass off so someone else comes calling.   Having said all that, I'd like to see him come back and do well.

He's gonna have a lot to prove and if he can turn it around on the organization that he frankly fucked over, he can go get a big payday elsewhere.  Nobody is going to question if Gordon has talent or not, but it's if he's serious about getting his shit together and putting football ahead of himself. That's the tough part. If he does (and we see the same from say, DGB in 2015) then maybe he can earn a contract in 2017 or beyond. But first he's got to prove to the NFL that he can get his act together appropriately.  But the potential of Gordon coming back with a developing Mayle, Hartline in WR2, and maybe grabbing Gordon's replacement in the 2nd or 3rd round next year (Say Josh Doctson out of TCU?) could put us in a great position moving into 2016."

I remember last [year] they made a big fuss about Johnny being in Vegas for Memorial Day Weekend. Johnny was here in Cleveland for Memorial day weekend this year. So that’s another step that he’s taken.  “He understands that you can’t be in Vegas or Miami or any of these other places, you have to be here. If you have to come in a day or two extra for an hour or two per day, that’s what quarterbacks do.

Browns,37h0lk,GPTrixie,5,Wed May 27 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"It will be fine.  He is, and will always be, an above average 2nd string QB.  That's all he ever was.  One string of 6 good games does not make a sudden All Pro out of a 30 year old QB."
Browns,37h0lk,bassistwanted,3,Wed May 27 20:03:44 2015 UTC,Rich the Cannon Gannon is the one exception I'd say
Browns,37h0lk,Carpetron,3,Wed May 27 20:27:42 2015 UTC,The problem is that's better than almost all the QBs we've had since returning.
Browns,37h0lk,24rubikscube,4,Thu May 28 00:12:41 2015 UTC,Good thing we went with the below average 2nd string QB instead!!
Browns,37h0lk,Back41DayOnly,2,Wed May 27 23:40:52 2015 UTC,I'm a JFF supporter so I think what you said is wrong and I hope come week 4 you're eating crow...
Browns,37h0lk,bassistwanted,3,Thu May 28 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"Would you rather he didn't succeed? He's a hometown guy who breathed new life into a team he rooted for his entire life, and for the better part of a season inspired hope in not just his team, but his city.  Enduring a good player leaving? That's par for the course for any Cleveland sports fan. Yeah, I know he shit the bed after Mack went down, but I still think he got a raw deal. I wish nothing but success for him down the road."

Browns,37h0lk,bmcclure937,-7,Wed May 27 15:56:42 2015 UTC,The tweet says not the Browns so it is instantly Browns news? We already had a bunch of reports that the Browns would not be on Hard Knocks. Not sure why we need another.
Browns,37h0lk,themitey1,1 point,Wed May 27 20:17:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but at the same time, it's the offseason.  Just let it be, it's been really slow for news and discussion lately."
Browns,37iitv,mulch17,13,Wed May 27 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"Yup, dude looked to be giving 110% but man....you could have sworn his feet had cement blocks tied to them. And like no lower balance at all. Once a DL got a arm around him it was play over.  Drafting Cam just gives us so much flexibility now, love it."
Browns,37iitv,subhuman1,3,Wed May 27 22:15:44 2015 UTC,"Rumor is that Bowie is above him on the depth right now (not cause Cam is a rookie but because Bowie is good), if that's true our line is gonna be scary good if Irving would be 2nd choice to replace a starter.   EDIT: Just so people see how bad McDonald was, here is PFF's rankings last year for centers. Using his crappiness-per-snap ratio he is twice as bad as the worse center in the league and the only thing that stopped him was that stupid Alex Mack played too many games.   Alex Mack, however, if he continued his pace would have been a 23.0, which would have been the best C in the game. Went from the top to the bottom."
Browns,37iitv,bearsdriving,6,Wed May 27 23:56:47 2015 UTC,"Never want to wish ill will on anybody, but I'm sure we are happy to see him gone.  I still find it very hard to believe that he was the best possible replacement for Mack, and that there was nobody off the street we could have signed to replace him during the season. That dude played like straight up ass."
Browns,37iitv,GeorgeHermanBluth,5,Wed May 27 21:59:02 2015 UTC,He defended the North Eastern realm bravely against our Eastern enemies the rat birds and the shit stains.  He held the line without fear against the bastard rebels from the Sothron realm of Cinci.  He gave his all... until some better guy showed up...and now his watch is ended.
Browns,37iitv,Brokewood,4,Thu May 28 05:58:12 2015 UTC,"With Bowie getting healthy, and Erving getting drafted, I feel this was inevitable.  not necessarily a bad thing. It's good to see the talent level rising."

Browns,37iitv,SmokeySmokes,2,Wed May 27 23:19:26 2015 UTC,Well that's it. Might as well throw in the towel for this season
Browns,37iitv,Helix1322,1 point,Thu May 28 01:44:07 2015 UTC,I lost count of how many times I saw a DT bull rush him and just the QB no time.  It is a good move by the browns.
Browns,37iitv,ImLurking_,1 point,Wed May 27 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"He honestly just wasn't good enough to keep around, especially after drafting Cam. He is responsibly for one of my favorite Browns memories.  I was at the Tampa Bay game last year, I was sitting high up, but it gave me a nice panoramic view of field. I decided to just focus on one position/player for the play, and chose McDonald. The Nose ran over McDonald and knocked him straight on his ass, and proceed to make the tackle in the backfield. McDonald went down so hard it looked like a cartoon. That play represented everything the Browns have been since I can remember."
Browns,37grbf,kuss51292,30,Wed May 27 14:48:22 2015 UTC,I mean...that's not surprising at all. Dude has been in rehab. Has a LOT of work ahead of him if he wants to be a starting QB. If anyone expected superstar play after 1 day of OTA's....that would be pretty foolish.  Come back next year. Tell me if he's still the same QB. That will be a much better evaluation than 1 day of OTA's.
Browns,37grbf,Troop-the-Loop,7,Wed May 27 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"Really, the question isn't is he better now, it's is he better in September. I fear that his wasted season will always come back to haunt him."
Browns,37grbf,droidworkerbee,8,Wed May 27 15:06:57 2015 UTC,"September would definitely be a better indicator than today, but I still think next year would be best.   I think Manziel needs do to all he can to effectively make this his rookie season. Come in with no expectation to start, but a will to do so. Spend the vast majority of the season improving on fundamentals. Working on checking his downs, learning when running is actually worth it, and not to throw into heavy coverage. Work on creating and mending relationships with crucial teammates. If he treats this season like a rookie QB should, I think he'll do alright, and it will help him move past his wasted season."
Browns,37grbf,Troop-the-Loop,4,Wed May 27 15:11:57 2015 UTC,"Sure. But ""what if?"" is a very nagging question in some people's minds. Perhaps it won't bother him, but it would sure as hell bother me."
Browns,37grbf,droidworkerbee,-1,Wed May 27 15:24:24 2015 UTC,if anything its a positive for him   How on earth are you going to spin what is essentially a missed season due to drug/alcohol abuse as a positive?
Browns,37grbf,fuckingbrowns,4,Wed May 27 15:28:39 2015 UTC,"Because not having inner demons is neutral, having them is negative, having them and dealing with them is still negative.

Browns,37grbf,Back41DayOnly,5,Wed May 27 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt theres no visible difference to a media member between a no pads OTA last year and a no pads OTA this year (even though its a complete different offense so how its EXACTLY the same is beyond me)  However Grossi himself dug into the ""Brian Hoyer is the answer"" camp pretty deep last year. Backed it up after Manziel failed and dug in even further this offseason and criticized the front office many many many many times.   Grossi has a dog in the fight.  If things work for the Browns, if the QBs are good and the team is better than it was last year, Grossi looks dumb. Very dumb for his comments over the past half year.   To think he is unbiased in this, or any situation, is false. He is now captain negative, has disagreed with just about everything Farmer has done, and if the Browns are good, or if Manziel is good....Grossi basically sees all credibility he somehow still has fly out the window"
Browns,37grbf,St0ckt0nS,4,Wed May 27 21:02:20 2015 UTC,The  NFL.com beat reporter said something similar yesterday
Browns,37grbf,hatmantc,4,Wed May 27 21:01:51 2015 UTC,Why state this at all? Give him time.
Browns,37grbf,Not_a_Clue,3,Wed May 27 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"This doesn't mean a lot. Manziel wasn't terrible before September but definitely looked like he needed some seasoning and hard work to develop.  We know he completely blew off his entire rookie season and spent most of this offseason in rehab. So he really hasn't had the time or ability to develop yet. He might very well end up yet another bust, but for now its too early to tell."
Browns,37grbf,Raunchyfarts,3,Wed May 27 18:50:30 2015 UTC,I wouldn't expect Johnny to look any different as he probably hasn't been thinking football to much. I can't take anything serious that Grossi tweets now since he change his avatar to sponge bob and patrick. it was at least better when he had a pic of his orange self.
Browns,37grbf,bry_guy,7,Wed May 27 15:22:06 2015 UTC,Grossi didn't look any different from tweets I saw last year. He is still the same [insert noun of your choice.]

Browns,37grbf,fear865,3,Wed May 27 16:13:48 2015 UTC,Hey a noun is a noun. :)
Browns,37grbf,FancySack,10,Wed May 27 16:25:27 2015 UTC,Only natural Grossi would refuse to say anything positive.
Browns,37grbf,kevler9oh,1 point,Wed May 27 15:14:35 2015 UTC,"The only reason you interpret it as negative, is because you internally have a negative opinion on it.  He didn't say he looks bad.  He said he looks the same.  Grossi has always had the same opinion as most people about Manziel.  What he did well in college isn't what pro QBs do well, and its going to take him to transition."
Browns,37grbf,djroomba322,4,Wed May 27 15:18:47 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty negative and dumb comment because it's the first OTA. Why would Johnny look much different then last year? The difference from last year and this year is that Johnny is putting in more time and effort to improve, but there hasn't even been much time yet."
Browns,37grbf,Godszn,7,Wed May 27 15:20:40 2015 UTC,The overall implication of it is that it is negative statement.
Browns,37grbf,kevler9oh,-8,Wed May 27 15:19:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't take it as negative. You took it as negative because you think Johnny is going to do poorly, so you tint everything through your negative glasses.  I didn't see it as a negative at all. Telling."
Browns,37grbf,djroomba322,11,Wed May 27 15:37:36 2015 UTC,Stop trying to sound smart.
Browns,37grbf,kevler9oh,6,Wed May 27 16:30:36 2015 UTC,"Because you're inherently negative, you don't need glasses"
Browns,37grbf,Dinowhaleball,8,Wed May 27 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"It was a negative comment because Johnny Manziel was terrible in just about everything that was on the field last year, minus that Buffalo drive. Saying that he's the same QB from last year implies that he still sucks."
Browns,37grbf,Injured_Society,-2,Wed May 27 15:50:51 2015 UTC,How is that negative. Seems like that's honest?
Browns,37grbf,djroomba322,8,Wed May 27 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"I don't side with you often, but I didn't see it as a negative either.  It was more of...stating the obvious.  He doesn't look better or worse than last year.  Picking up where he left off.  Rehab didn't effect him negatively on the field.  It probably would have been better if Grossi could elaborate more.  But it's twitter.  Whatever."
Browns,37grbf,themitey1,8,Wed May 27 17:12:04 2015 UTC,"Leave it to Tony to state answers to questions nobody asked.   Of course he looked the same, Tony, it's OTAs with no contact and lip-service to the press. Anyway, that's not what reporters are asking, and they aren't even asking you. They're asking the team and players if Johnny has changed."
Browns,37grbf,blackedout,5,Wed May 27 16:58:43 2015 UTC,Let's not pretend like this sub and the browns community in general isn't going nuts for johnny again.   He's the backup qb and everyone is still drooling over every throw. No one is mentioning the pick 6 he threw. Just the touchdown  I'm all about this tweet. It's a reminder that he hasn't earned anything on the field yet. Everyone wants a redemption story. Grossi's worried people are writing one too soon
Browns,37grbf,chuckyjc05,3,Wed May 27 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"I know I'm going nuts for it. All I'm saying is that Tony is being a ""Debbie Downer"" when he needn't be. It adds nothing to the discussion. He's a bit like the ""harsh reality"" friend that everyone has ""Don't even bother with CPR, 95% of people will die anyway"" or ""I know I should adopt a shelter dog because all of them will be dead by next month, but I can't choose."" We're Browns fans, we all think the same negative thoughts, but Grossi has to put pen to paper."
Browns,37grbf,blackedout,13,Wed May 27 18:27:03 2015 UTC,So you're saying Tony Grossi is djroomba?
Browns,37grbf,fear865,1 point,Wed May 27 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"OMG, it all makes sense now."
Browns,37grbf,sonicmerlin,3,Wed May 27 16:36:40 2015 UTC,I think the blind optimism based on nothing is part of the problem
Browns,37grbf,chuckyjc05,4,Wed May 27 16:43:46 2015 UTC,"You hold the same opinion as 90% of the people who've ever even heard of the Browns. I don't think getting excited about the team is a ""problem""."
Browns,37grbf,blackedout,5,Wed May 27 17:07:07 2015 UTC,Getting unnecessarily/wrongfully excited is.   Thats what grossi is saying. He looks the same as a year ago.  Im not saying dont be optimistic. Im saying be optimistic about something that seems likely. Not something you hope to happen.   He may come out and have an amazing season. But the only evidence i have that that will happen is that he's putting in more hours than other people. So im not going to jack off to his practice throws just yet
Browns,37grbf,chuckyjc05,2,Wed May 27 22:06:01 2015 UTC,"To be fair, him looking the same as last year doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing, they liked what he did in practice.  It was the new scheme on the field that fucked everything."
Browns,37grbf,Nightcinder,-4,Wed May 27 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"For the 610th million time, there wasn't a different scheme.  They ran the same scheme.  Johnny was incapable of running it.  Stop with this nonsense."
Browns,37grbf,djroomba322,3,Wed May 27 18:15:23 2015 UTC,"It's not unnecessary at all. You're being pessimistic, because as of right now, they may suck or they may be great. Life is more enjoyable for a lot of people if they get happy about something. The Browns make me, and many others quite happy. They may depress me from time-to-time, but I remember when they weren't here. If I want to talk about how excited I am that Johnny Football isn't laying drunk in a gutter, and my team is out there for the first time this year, I will. I don't need another voice on the mountain telling me I'm a fool for doing so. Believe me, I know. Being a victim or whining about my team all the time just makes me a shitty person to others. I prefer excitement."
Browns,37grbf,blackedout,-4,Wed May 27 18:23:39 2015 UTC,Oh brother.  Life is better today because you're optimistic. But it's people like that who live in fantasy world who scream bloody murder and the sky is falling and can't believe how no one possibly saw it coming.  All you had to do was have an ounce of being realistic now.  That's it.  It's not pessimism is it's true.  It's accepting facts.
Browns,37grbf,djroomba322,0,Wed May 27 23:51:05 2015 UTC,"Did you forget to log back into your other account, roomba?"
Browns,37grbf,blackedout,-4,Thu May 28 01:32:11 2015 UTC,What? Are you making some small minded argument that anyone why disagrees with you must be me? Maybe your opinion just isn't that good.  Might be time for a bit of introspection for you.
Browns,37grbf,djroomba322,1 point,Wed May 27 19:20:55 2015 UTC,It's so funny that he knows after one OTA that Manziel looks the same.  We saw one full game last year.  Not a huge sample size!
Browns,37grbf,Dinowhaleball,3,Wed May 27 19:26:55 2015 UTC,Off season sucks ass. Nothing but johnny on here.
Browns,37grbf,jacksonbarrett,2,Wed May 27 19:37:49 2015 UTC,Of course he doesn't look different - he's practicing and people aren't going 100% against him or other players on the field. He failed last year because when people were giving 100% on the game field he'd buckle.  Any progress or improvements he's made this year won't actually be appreciated until he's in a game time situation.
Browns,37grbf,JohnStamosBRAH,4,Wed May 27 20:17:52 2015 UTC,I wish we could vote Grossi out. He's a turd.

Browns,37grbf,jakedidit,-4,Wed May 27 16:41:39 2015 UTC,Confirmed Manziel bust.
Browns,37h1n3,HWGBHWG,19,Wed May 27 16:02:23 2015 UTC,"Johnny Neutral here:  You have to start him. Like him or hate him, doubt him or not. If we don't start him, we gain nothing. McCown, and I know there are some folks here who want to start fights over this, but bear in mind, McCown is not a fucking starter who will take you to the playoffs or beyond; at best he gets you back to 7-9. Manziel is an unknown; you have to see what you have there. And maybe there's nothing. In fact, there's still a good chance there is nothing, but this isn't like Tebow where he played sub par but was carried by an above-average squad to the playoffs and then fizzled out. Manziel hasn't played enough meaningful football to make a judgement call on his talent or ability as of yet, and yes, he lacks in a lot of ways, but we need to see what the hell we have here before we drop the kid in 2016.  If he sucks, fine. Get me a long-term fix at QB in 2016. If goes in and performs, fine, get me Shawn Oakman or Laquan Treadwell and let's finish this team up. But McCown starting tells you nothing about what you have for the next 3-4-5 years. We need to start thinking about 3-4-5 years down the line.  So, start him. Live by the sword you chose and either kill with it or die by it."
Browns,37h1n3,JohnnyFire,3,Wed May 27 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"It makes sense not to start him now if the coaches see potential but don't think he's ready, the last thing we need is another shell shocked husk of a once-promising QB. I'm as big a Manziel doubter as you'll find on this sub, but there's no point starting a guy who's not ready just because we have him. Give him the time he needs to learn and put him in when he's prepared to handle it."

Browns,37h1n3,jvpewster,42,Wed May 27 23:24:38 2015 UTC,"If he lines up behind Mack on Sunday.  That's it. The debate that we are about to have for months is pointless. If Pettine puts him in, he's the starter."
Browns,37h1n3,droidworkerbee,6,Wed May 27 16:04:39 2015 UTC,"Also, Pettine is the man, he's calling the shots and if he feels Johnny is ready to go week 1, then Johnny is ready. I trust his judgement. No one knows more about the QB situation than him."
Browns,37h1n3,SuperPoop,2,Wed May 27 16:51:26 2015 UTC,Preach. Also him starting means nothing to me until he proves something as a starter. I won't hate on him before that time and I hope the good news about him is true. Even if it is being a long-term starter in the NFL at QB is a low percentage bet for anyone and all the work in world guarantees us nothing. I hope he does well as I don't see McCown as a long term solution. I do think with our O-line (along with the running game) and Defense we're in a good position to take the pressure off whomever starts which is good for developing a QB for the future.
Browns,37h1n3,LosingMyEdge7,6,Wed May 27 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, I am a Johnny doubter.   However, I don't believe McCown is the future of the franchise, so why not roll the dice on Johnny and see if he can put it together. It'd be a long shot, but its remarkably unlikely that the browns are winning the Superbowl this year.   I say play Johnny until we're 100% certain he'll never actualize. At which point we'll have a great pick which we can use on his replacement."
Browns,37h1n3,anacondra,1 point,Wed May 27 17:32:49 2015 UTC,"If he can't beat out McClown then yeah I'm very worried. I'm Johnny Skeptical. I have some doubts, but I still hold hope."
Browns,37h1n3,24rubikscube,1 point,Thu May 28 00:10:09 2015 UTC,"Even if McCown returns to his Chicago form and gives us the best chance to win this year, is he the best to play?  I don't see a lot of long term feasability in McCown. I think it's great that the Browns swung for the fences with Johnny. I'd rather strike out on 3,4,5 more qbs and eventually hit on an Aaron Rogers, or Tom Brady, rather than settling for any old Andy Dalton.  If Johnny isn't the guy to help us win a Superbowl, he can help us find the next on deck. Simply put, I want the Browns QB to be Johnny Manziel or Cardale Jones."
Browns,37h1n3,anacondra,5,Thu May 28 00:18:25 2015 UTC,If Johnny plays like last year (I still don't think he was too bad last year) then I'll be convinced he's not right for the job.
Browns,37h1n3,hard_to_explain,2,Wed May 27 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"Pett chose Hoyer after preseason game 2 or 3 last year, so they'd get time to practice with the first team for the rest of the preseason. I'd suspect he'd do the same this season."
Browns,37h1n3,mokango,3,Wed May 27 16:10:42 2015 UTC,"I will be convinced that Johnny is our guy if he starts and plays well in a significant stretch of games (as in, 750+ snaps running the offense).  I will be convinced that he's not our guy if he starts and plays poorly in a significant stretch of games.  Here's my concern, though:  what if Johnny starts from day 1 in 2015 and performs similarly to what Blake Bortles or Derek Carr did in 2014 (i.e., not awful for a young QB but among the worst starters in the league)?  Are we going to run him out of town for that?  It's a weird situation of Johnny's own making."
Browns,37h1n3,TapedeckNinja,3,Wed May 27 17:48:10 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm worried about as well.  And seriously, that's been Cleveland's #1 problem since 1999.  If a QB can't come in and perform on day 1, he's a failure and we run them out of town.  Rinse and repeat every single fucking year.  If Johnny comes in and does subpar, I would love to stick with him for another year or 2, see if he develops into a decent QB or not.  Fuck instant gratification, let's try developing a QB for once.  Something Cleveland had NEVER tried."

Browns,37h1n3,Nightcinder,5,Wed May 27 17:43:16 2015 UTC,I haven't seen him make a throw in the NFL that made me think he was going to be a good quarterback.
Browns,37h1n3,ragar31,2,Thu May 28 00:04:54 2015 UTC,"If he has a verified relapse and doesn't immediately lock himself down to correct it, I'm done. Period. I think the entire city will be at that point. For me, a Johnny lover, it comes down to one last chance. That's why I enjoy his storyline... He's got one final chance, something that many people don't get, and I hope beyond belief that he can capitalize on it. We all know how bad this city needs it."
Browns,37h1n3,blackedout,2,Thu May 28 00:26:12 2015 UTC,"What will convince me Johnny isn't the starter? Pettine saying he isn't the starter. What will convince me he is? Take a guess. I've a lot of faith in Pettine, he has thus far shown me he deserves it."
Browns,37h1n3,Ocerion,2,Wed May 27 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"I think the answer to both questions is consistency. The most jaded Manziel haters will admit that he has the physical skills to be great and showed limited flashes last year. The most blindly optimistic Manziel fans will admit that his in game performance last year was generally disappointing.  Personally, I believe that we spent a first rounder on the guy, stick him in and see what he can do. But I trust Mike Pettine 100%. If he thinks Manziel should start, he should start. If he thinks he shouldn't, he shouldn't."

I expect a new fire in his eyes. He will be the starter. He will perform like the media expected and he will be worshipped like Lebron.
Browns,37h1n3,Candygram_for_Mongo,1 point,Wed May 27 16:12:07 2015 UTC,I'm Johnny Neutral.   If he can step up and show he can lead the team to victory I'm all for it. However he has to show me that on the field and off the field. You don't see Manning or Brady out partying even in the off season. He has corrected that part of his life. Surrounded himself with the right kind of support and now he needs to show what he can do on the field.
Browns,37h1n3,Helix1322,1 point,Wed May 27 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"I think the only way to know for sure is to start him. Every game. Then the Browns, the fans and the world will see if he really has what it takes.  Until that happens there will always be speculation and debate surrounding if Johnny Football got a fair shake."
Browns,37h1n3,GeorgeHermanBluth,1 point,Thu May 28 22:43:23 2015 UTC,"Doubter here:  1 - Show me something, anything, in pre-season that looks like you can throw, from the pocket, to someone other than your 1st option.  2 - Show me that your college ability to extend a broken play will translate to the NFL and that you're fast enough and slippery enough to evade pass rushers at this level.  3 - Win the starting job over Josh or be starting by week 3 or 4 due to skill and NOT an injury to Josh.  4 - If you start day one give me an 8 - 8 season and have at least a few of those wins be directly attributable to something you did.  I don't want Crow or West pounding 6 touchdowns off draws.  Anybody can stand back there and hand the ball off.  I want some clutch touchdown passes, some short gain bullets, and at least a few long, perfect bombs.  5 - Stay the hell out of the media for anything even remotely questionable.  6 - Act like you're happy you're being given the chance to live a life tons of people dream of living."

Browns,37h1n3,Daviroth,-3,Thu May 28 22:26:19 2015 UTC,So there is no reason to think otherwise until he produces something measurable... Other than hype.
Browns,37h1n3,jabb0,7,Wed May 27 16:42:26 2015 UTC,So then him producing something measurable would be your answer to his question.
Browns,37h1n3,ginganinja019,-2,Wed May 27 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"Measurable on the field, not tears or beers"
Browns,37h1n3,jabb0,3,Wed May 27 17:40:58 2015 UTC,Not entirely true but pretty close.
Browns,37h1n3,Daviroth,-3,Wed May 27 18:39:24 2015 UTC,He did produce some tears on the field :-)
Browns,37htnv,Spartan_55,19,Wed May 27 19:10:26 2015 UTC,I'm eager to see what Duke Johnson can do in the running and possibly return game.  He's really athletic and with a healthy O line our RBs could be very exciting to watch.
Browns,37htnv,miked1be,8,Wed May 27 19:15:48 2015 UTC,This playbook better have a heavy dose of screen plays to him. Did we run more than 5 RB screens last year? Get Thomas and Bitonio out there taking out DBs. The bubble screen to Hawkins was only ever good for a few yards.
Browns,37htnv,youwithme,6,Wed May 27 19:38:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, he's athletic enough to be a good good receiving option on quick dump off passes which might be his best bet since some people seem to be knocking his inside running ability and vision.  Unless he improves there we'll probably see a lot of outside runs or dump offs to him."
Browns,37htnv,miked1be,10,Wed May 27 19:44:42 2015 UTC,I want to see if Shelton lives up to expectations. Can't wait to see our front 7 out there lighting up every RB they see.
Browns,37htnv,bowhunter6274,4,Wed May 27 19:50:18 2015 UTC,I really want to see what Shelton can be with a good supporting cast around him.  He may not play close to full potential until next season or so but I expect him to be able to at least compete this year and play as a rotational guy.
Browns,37htnv,miked1be,2,Wed May 27 19:55:49 2015 UTC,"He'll be starting once uncle Phil unfortunately gets hurt again. I wish that big, beautiful man could stay healthy. I want to see him smack a woman beater in the face again."

Browns,37htnv,blackedout,6,Wed May 27 19:46:50 2015 UTC,"I was the biggest Hoyer fan out there and I'm still salty he's gone. More importantly though, I'm a browns fan and I'll stand behind Johnny even though I've despised him since his draft. I know what the rest of the team is capable of already, minus this years rookie class. So I'm excited to see what he can do more than anyone now that he's actually putting his mind to it. He'll be the starter regardless of what the media/staff says. I have little hope, but since brown and orange run in my veins, there's always some."
Browns,37htnv,Not_Sure23,1 point,Wed May 27 22:24:44 2015 UTC,Why such a big Hoyer fan? Johnny's no better at the moment but after the run game fell apart Hoyer sucked major ass. The colts game was the worst thing I've seen in a long time
Browns,37htnv,Masterdebater22,6,Thu May 28 02:56:49 2015 UTC,"Because he played with passion, made smart decisions, had a leadership quality out there that I haven't seen from a qb in a long time, and had potential. He wasn't a star and he made a lot of bad throws, but also a lot of good ones and a few spectacular ones.  But he hasn't had much playing time and still had a lot to learn. He was coachable and we should've continued to build around him instead of hoping to hit the qb lottery year after year draft after draft."
Browns,37htnv,Not_Sure23,1 point,Thu May 28 03:19:41 2015 UTC,"Hoyer is not the type of guy you build a team around. In my mind, Hoyer is like a worse version of Tony Romo. He can do some great stuff, also he's gonna make some bad throws, he has potential, but most likely won't get you to the super bowl. That's great and Hoyer will work on a team like the Texans to give them a halfway decent QB until they can get someone better, but they have JJ Watt and Arian Foster, etc.  I think Johnny can operate on this level at least as good as Hoyer, and I think he has the potential to break out and be great if he commits to it. I think Johnny needs a firm understanding of pro play and the time to get it right. But, time will tell."
Browns,37htnv,JRR_Brolkien,13,Thu May 28 14:25:27 2015 UTC,I hope to see some classic Johnny Football this year. I wanna see that money sign a little more often this year
Browns,37htnv,SmokeyTheBear420,3,Wed May 27 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"I wanna see that money sign a little more often this year   I love JM, but I hope if he balls out the first game, as a statement, he does it strictly business. Scores a TD and doesn't do a damn thing, just embraces his teammates and walks off the field. After that statement game, bring the money signs back and piss off the rest of the NFL."
Browns,37htnv,kevler9oh,4,Thu May 28 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see what Johnny can do if he is given this season. Hartline bc I'm happy he's back in Ohio. I think he's a very underrated possession WR with great route running. Shelton bc he's going to fucking destroy. Our RBs given our OL upgrade, and our entire Secondary."

Browns,37lgpq,BigRedKomodo,9,Thu May 28 14:13:45 2015 UTC,I think it means that it was a stupid question because there's no way he was going to give any sort of answer to that this early and accurately trying to read anything more into it is impossible.

It'll take 3-4 years to get to the point where we need to spend BIG money on a QB, so I don't see why we wouldn't use that for a 4/5 year deal on Mack"
Browns,37lgpq,Kylekub,1 point,Thu May 28 14:36:13 2015 UTC,"Look at 35 year old lineman and it doesn't look smart to pay him that money when you have his replacement (maybe) the whole time.   Also, he's under contract till 2018. He is about $0.5 MIL away from being the highest paid center but has 42.9% guaranteed compared to 24.6% to the highest paid guy. He isn't hurting for money right now."
Browns,37lgpq,bearsdriving,3,Thu May 28 14:50:17 2015 UTC,"It's not about money, it's about playing for a team that can win. If the Browns want to keep him, the need to not suck first."
Browns,37lgpq,Nerdlinger,1 point,Thu May 28 14:51:15 2015 UTC,"I think he meant what he said... It is too early for him to be making a decision. I hope he stays and I imagine we would be willing to pay him what he is worth assuming he's back to probowl form (my expectations).   Additionally, if we can be competitive again this year i think Mack will see the progress and consider a long term deal. If we win 5 games or less i think he's gone. :("
Browns,37lgpq,FollowDasFUhrer,1 point,Thu May 28 14:24:35 2015 UTC,"He is getting paid the highest of any center in the game and will be 31 next year, age of decline is 28 for centers. Not sure he'll get more money or a better contract.  Also, before being asked 100 times, he did say he absolutely hasn't made up his mind about this; if we are bad and have turn over, he'll leave.  That said we have Cam and Bowie who are great replacements. Mack is probably the best center in the game, but we won't be nearly as bad off as before. Bowie may take Greco or Schwartz's spot this year and Cam is suppose to be a big talent."

The Browns have gone out of their way to build on the Seattle model (although they've missed a few key points) of starting with a dominant defense and letting the offense come into play afterwards. That could pay off. Strong on all fronts here. Solid coaching. I think Mike Pettine is a damn good coach who's been given some shitty, shitty hands early on. He's hard nosed and wants to win. Offensive line is going to be strong. Cameron Erving is either going to fill in for an injured or departing Alex Mack, get John ""I can't make a play without being pushed back 20 yards"" Greco out of the RG position, or move Mitchell ""Fifth Round Talent"" inside to guard and take the RT. That would put 4 of the 5 spots on the line in fucking great shape. Quiet draft, quiet offseason. Ain't that a miraculous change after last season?   Won't:   Schedule amps up from last year. The Browns had a chance to sweep the leg on last season facing a weak NFC South, and only partly took advantage of it. The NFC West and AFC West aren't going to be so forgiving in 2015. The lack of offensive weapons is a big problem. WR is currently two guys who are on the verge of being washed up in Bowe and Hartline, a rookie (with potential, albeit that) in Vince ""Super Smash Brothers"" Mayle, and a load of slot guys who are incredibly boom or bust. TE? Gary Barnidge and Rob Housler. I wish Cleveland had gotten a viable target, but Farmer isn't interested in such; we'll see how that turns out. Going into this season it already feels like an evaluator for Manziel more than it being a potential redemption road or coming out party. We all know the names coming out in 2016; there's a lot more than in 2015 and likely will be a lot more available regardless of where Cleveland is picking to play around with (Jones, Hackenberg, Cook, Goff, Kiel, Hogan, Prescott, plenty more). If Manziel doesn't find his footing, the Browns will be looking for QB 24 in 2016, and that's not a good start.   VERDICT: Okay, so prior to the 2014 draft, and heading into last season, I championed the idea that the Browns would have a successful season if they could kill the ""old Browns"" stigma. The wins come after you convince the players and the league that you need to be taken seriously, that this bullshit from expansion to now no longer matters. And although the Browns did improve their record, they didn't wipe that stink away as of yet. The goal in 2015-2016 is not going to be a Super Bowl; it's to finally do that. You can change the atmosphere in Berea and Cleveland if you go 4-12, but you're a fighting 4-12 and in every game and there's nothing stupid forthcoming. So no, I don't think Cleveland is even thinking about the Super Bowl right now. I'm excited because I think the Browns can still succeed this year with the type of draft they had, thinking 5-6 years down the line as opposed to no foresight at all, but I don't think the dividends of Shelton, Cooper, Duke Johnson, Nate Orchard, SSBM, and Erving are paying off in 2015. I'll pop them in at 29 and pray that goes up if Manziel's resurgence is not so exaggerated.

I don't believe a word out of his mouth anymore about how he's growing up and maturing anymore - he was born on third base and thought he hit a triple.  But I believe Whitner was one of the guys who publicly called out Gilbert for being a fuck-up last year, so you know he's not one to coddle a guy just to make sure they feel warm and fuzzy on the inside.  The difference between a great QB and a good QB is that the great QBs are the first in and the last out of the building.  Doesn't mean Johnny will be our guy, but it's at least a glimmer of hope that his swan-riding days are behind him."

I'm not enabling anything, but in my opinion we didn't see enough of Manziel to make any kind of rational decision about his future given the circumstances.  I do hope he does well, because I want us to win.  That's the only band wagon I'm on, the lets win bandwagon.    Manziel is what we have right now, so I'm going to root for him to be good."

Browns,37cw27,Doyle524,1 point,Wed May 27 15:20:40 2015 UTC,"The offensive line is made up of at least three excellent players. Left tackle Joe Thomas, left guard Joel Bitonio, and center Alex Mack are All-Pro caliber players. Right guard John Greco and right tackle Mitchell Schwartz were good last year, but suspect at times. However, when Mack went down with a broken leg last year, the quality of play from the line went downhill. Our backups just didn't mesh well, didn't do their jobs well, and made the other four look bad.   JFF is quarterback Johnny Manziel, aka Johnny Fucking Football."

Browns,37cw27,St0ckt0nS,2,Wed May 27 02:58:16 2015 UTC,"The difference this year is the amount of players saying it that Johnny is putting in the work, and even Joe Thomas has said he's seen a change. Feels like people top to bottom agree he's putting in the hours, feels much more genuine this year, especially since we're not seeing pictures of him all over the internet at different parties.   I do believe Johnny has been out (IE Shaqs party) but I don't believe he's been doing these things solo or under the influence, he's been with people who are helping him stay sober, and lets hope he sticks to it. Makes me nervous, but doesn't mean he's doing something wrong.  The reality of rehab is its ongoing. Never stops, and relapses are almost guaranteed and many treatments before a person really stops using is expected.

I looked at some of his tape from William & Mary and he's a high-motor, workout warrior type of player. He's the definitive ""tweener"" though so he'll probably never see significant time on defense, but he could be a prime candidate for special teams.   That's the good thing about running the 3-4 defense, you'll have more linebacker type guys on your roster and it makes filling out your special teams easier."

You go find another team who does, and have them write a contract for us.""  We were hoping to pay him less, he wanted (rightly) to be paid as one of the best centers.    Which is exactly what he did.  He went and found a team that would give him an opt out clause so he could leave as soon as possible.  Why would he want to stay at a place where he felt he wasn't being appreciated or valued?  Same deal here.

Alex Mack wanted to leave, and for reasons I completely understand. Mack refused contract negotiations in the last year of his rookie contract.   Once the season was over Mack went off to Brazil on a humanitarian trip, and he wanted answers about the new coaching staff, etc. The Browns had 2 weeks to negotiate a contract before Mack hit the FA market. That's why he got the transition tag. That was a smart move by Farmer for talent retention.  Something something, facts, something something educate you."
Browns,37bmub,Trilljoy,-17,Tue May 26 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"The article you link says nothing about that.  He wanted the max deal before the season.    Farmer, refused to negotiate, over the entirety of the off season.   Funny that Mack's agent went on the same humanitarian trip too.  That was really nice of him being away.    Mack said ""I want answers and this money. Pay me.""  Farmer could have at any point offered him a better contract.  Any day from March 11th until Day 1 of the season.  But you know what he did?  Nothing.   Something something, facts, something something educate you."
Browns,37bmub,djroomba322,9,Tue May 26 15:05:27 2015 UTC,"I think the important thing to take away from my post is Mack was leaving regardless of what money the Browns offered. That's fairly obvious, but also why the transition tag was important."

We've let high quality players keep walking away because we refuse to pay them.  How in the world can you defend the organization and just say ""oh well he was leaving lol"".  And lets pretend that your misguided understanding of events were true.  Do you know why Mack would be leaving anyways?  Because Farmer couldn't give him the answers he wanted.  He surely laid out what he wanted to do moving the organization forward and Mack wanted nothing to do with it.  And I'm sure you don't see anything wrong with that either. Right? Right.  Funny how when this all went down then all I read in here was ""Farmer is a GENIUS! Let the jags do our work!""  and yet now everyone can't see the very simple writing on the wall."

Browns,37bmub,Trilljoy,-12,Tue May 26 15:33:21 2015 UTC,"Look, I shouldn't have to explain this to you.  You realize that any team can renegotiate any contract they want at any point right?  That's the whole point of NFL contracts?  Mack isn't interested and the Browns aren't either.  And at any point they could have given Mack the proposal that Farmer gave when he was hired, and he wasn't interested.  Look, if Farmer was really that good of a GM, he could have gotten the deal done in 2 weeks.  I think that is a testament to him not being ready for the job, that's shown to be even more obvious going forward with the whole Manziel, Gilbert, Textgate, Gibson, Skrine, etc etc etc.  I don't really understand how you can defend him on any level."

Browns,37bmub,Daviroth,3,Tue May 26 13:30:51 2015 UTC,"Gipson was great last year, and was very good for the last half of the season before last season. But he had a very serious knee injury and 1.5 years of solid production under his belt.   AT MOST, we should offer him a hefty one year contract with the understanding that he will get extended if the injury doesn't slow him down. I really don't see how that would be unfair in any way, but I'm sure the problem is we aren't offering him a hefty contract. I mean, shit, we got the cap room to give him high-end safety money for one year, then we can extend him with appropriate pay for however well he is playing."
Browns,37bmub,aggroCrag32,9,Tue May 26 16:20:39 2015 UTC,"Not saying he didn't show great potential, but he had one good year. He still needs to prove it wasn't an anomaly."

Browns,37bmub,droidworkerbee,7,Tue May 26 17:41:29 2015 UTC,"Of your arguments, this one is fairly weak. McCown's contract is large in you or me money, but he's making the 27th most per year of QBs in the league. Perhaps you would have preferred Fitzpatrick or Sanchez or Mallett, but his contract is roughly on par with theirs per season, and really none of them have proven anything."
Browns,37bmub,djroomba322,-5,Tue May 26 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"27 is yearly, not including bonus. Which if you include, he's definitely higher.  And it's appalling he's in the top 50, let alone top 32."
Browns,37bmub,droidworkerbee,4,Tue May 26 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"Sanchez's and Fitz's signing boni are more per year, and Mallett will get $1M for making the roster. For reference, 32 is Chase Daniel, and below him are such stellar talents as Shaun Hill, Matt Hasslebeck, and Drew Stanton. They're better?"
Browns,37bmub,djroomba322,-5,Tue May 26 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. Wholeheartedly, unequivocally yes.  I'm shocked you even question that.  And your numbers aren't correct, but I'm on my phone so I can't link it.   There is at least 10+ qb options not on rookie contracts who are making less than mccown. The only way his contract is beneficial is if he stays for more than a year which is an even more hilarious thought."
Browns,37bmub,TapedeckNinja,4,Tue May 26 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"He's actually the 26th-highest-paid QB by both average salary and total guranteed money.  $1MM of his 2016 salary was front-loaded into this year, which is the reason his guaranteed money is a bit higher than his ""peers"" (e.g., Cassell, Hoyer, Sanchez, Fitzmagic), but is also likely to be part of the bargaining chip we used to lure him here when he already had an offer from Buffalo."
Browns,37bmub,djroomba322,-7,Tue May 26 19:33:03 2015 UTC,Those aren't his peers.  He's by far and away the worst one of those by any measurable statistic except weird anti porn ads
Browns,37bmub,TapedeckNinja,3,Tue May 26 19:45:32 2015 UTC,"Huh.  Okay.  Over each of their past five seasons in which they started games (obviously Hoyer doesn't have five seasons worth of starts):     Rating ANY/A Y/A TD Rate INT Rate Completion %    Sanchez 74.06 4.98 6.67 3.77 3.67 56.34   Fitzpatrick 83.40 5.76 6.97 4.68 3.39 61.00   McCown 79.38 5.44 6.98 4.22 3.85 60.23   Hoyer 76.55 5.75 7.27 3.06 3.06 56.05   Cassell 80.45 5.41 6.70 4.31 3.10 58.82    It doesn't look like he's ""far and away the worst"" in all of those statistics.  Aside from Fitzpatrick appearing to be clearly the best guy in this bunch, I'm not sure there's much differentiation between these QBs."

Browns,37bmub,740Buckeye,1 point,Tue May 26 22:18:09 2015 UTC,It's not idiotic. Everyone that I've seen opposed to offering Gipson a decent contract has cited his knee injury as the main cause as to why they're opposed.

If you recall he won the starting job in Seattle the year the won the Superbowl, and the absolute only reason the Seahawks shifted him to the practice squad instead of IR (which allowed us to claim him) was because he reported after injury overweight and Coach Carroll tried to slide him onto the practice squad and save the IR designated to return tag for another player."

I'm always looking to follow everyone on the current Browns roster on Twitter, so I am now maintaining a roster online of all player's Twitter accounts. There is a follow all button to make it easy to follow everyone on the current roster. I figured someone here might be interested.  I was inspired by someone in the /r/PHP subreddit who made a website to follow a bunch of popular developers so I decided to create the same thing for the Browns. The source is up on Github for anyone who is interested.  Cheers!"

I'm not all in on Johnny, my history will show me as a Hoyer fan, but I understand addiction, and social media is part of his addiction. I DO want him to succeed. This kind of stuff hinders that, imo.   Additionally, I would be willing to bet that if West, Crow, and Duke are in a three way tie, it will come down to personal conduct, and this kind of stuff shows a person as not being mature. Will that impact the front offices opinion on him? Shrug I just hope for a good, powerful, responsible, team. We Bark Together"

For a team looking to break guys like Josh Gordon, Johnny, Gilbert, etc. and turn them into both good players and to avoid the off-field issues, it doesn't appear T-West is getting the gist of what it takes to ""Play like a Brown.""  Dancing on national broadcasts until your QB shuts you down. Posting pictures of yourself flipping the bird. Publicly hunting for trim on Instagram, and being called on it by Deadspin.

Anyone here who has a job where you represent a company/employer(is some fashion)  understands the potential ramifications of this BS. Hear about the guy who just lost a $100,000+ salary for yelling ""right in the pussy"" to a camera?  Was that illegal?

Browns,377w53,CharlotteWins,3,Mon May 25 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"The word ""thug"" is often used by certain people in place of the n word.

Browns,377w53,Batfall,2,Tue May 26 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"Is the picture in bed taste? Yeah, probably.   Essentially what you, and the original poster, are saying is ""Do something in bad taste"" + ""be black"" = ""violent criminal"" (thug). If you can't see the problem there.. I don't know what to tell you.  Not every person who takes a stupid picture is labeled a thug.. it's almost always reserved for one race in particular."

Is the military paying to spread this message via NFL games and events really that much different than Gatorade paying to be the only way players can quench their thirst or Bose to be the only way coaches can communicate with each other?

Browns,3701iz,randyc87,5,Sat May 23 18:12:07 2015 UTC,I agree. I'd love to see it but I don't think its conducive to a winning environment. Especially on a team with a QB who needs to stay out of the media spotlight
Browns,3701iz,djroomba322,-7,Sat May 23 19:43:36 2015 UTC,"There is literally zero correlation between being on hard knocks and doing poorly.  If anything, statistics dictate the alternative, and that teams on Hard Knocks have made an improvement over the previous year the majority of the time.  Additionally, this would have been the perfect chance to build a positive reputation.  There is zero chance they would film us and make it negative.  Its a big miss imo."
Browns,3701iz,djroomba322,3,Sat May 23 21:48:15 2015 UTC,I may be misinformed but if you make the playoffs aren't you exempt from being on hard knocks. If the extra cameras lead to increased performance why do zero teams sign up to be featured on the show. IMO being selected isn't something any organization wants. I don't see any potential good of having any more media attention than we need  If I am totally off base here please educate me. I'm honestly not very knowledgeable on the matter

Browns,3719b1,cancrdancr,3,Sat May 23 23:15:01 2015 UTC,"If you want a jersey of someone that is gonna be on the browns, I'd probably stay away from the Gordon Jersey. A year gone from an NFL team w/ his history of stupidness is a recipe for disaster. I could easily see him never really play quality football ever again.   If you want his jersey for other reasons, then I think it looks pretty sick, like any other jersey i guess, so go for it!"
Browns,3719b1,Godszn,2,Sun May 24 01:34:57 2015 UTC,He holds the record for most yards in a season for a Cleveland WR. And he has over 2700 yards despite all of the suspensions.   I feel he is going to take the Manziel route and go sober and turn his career around.
Browns,3719b1,AKlep,2,Sun May 24 03:04:34 2015 UTC,One can hope. Hopefully Manziel can provide a good example of the benefits of sobriety.
Browns,3719b1,OKidAmnesiac,2,Sun May 24 05:04:33 2015 UTC,"Gordon and Manziel are two different situations. Gordon has had numerous repeated suspensions for substance abuse dating all the way back to college without being either 1) smart enough to beat the system or 2) have enough sense to admit a problem or will power to put his career first. Dude was found passed out in his car in the driver's seat at a taco bell hammered in college. He had the talent though and a chance to become one of the highest paid and best receivers in the game, then lost it bc he can't follow a simple rule for a few years. I don't mean to sound like a dick, but he just doesn't come across as intelligent at all given the above info and the way he talks to the press.   However, Manziel's gotten one in house suspension, from when he was found hammered in his apartment instead of showing up to work (was injured though, he wasn't playing that day but it doesn't make it right). JFF didn't show an ounce of the potential Gordon did, and I'm not really sure yet if his poor play is bc of a lack of talent or a lack of effort- jury's still out on that. Whatever JFF is he's not stupid. I honestly think rehab was a brilliant PR move by him to completely erase his first season from people's minds and get a clean slate while allowing the media to get off his back. Everybody loves a redemption story. If he doesn't produce this season he will most likely be a backup for a few years and then out of the league.   *edit: Gordon was not the one driving and was in the passenger seat. The driver and him were both found passed out drunk in the car while GOING THROUGH the drive through, you know how messed up you have to be for that? And they had tons of weed on them and in the car. He's dumb as a box of rocks."
Browns,3719b1,740Buckeye,2,Sun May 24 16:25:40 2015 UTC,The only reason I brought Manziel's name up is because of his rehab and being sober. The only way Gordon can make it in this league is if he goes the sober route like Manziel. Gordon knows this and wants his big pay day when his rookie deal is up. I really think Gordon has a good head on his shoulders and will come back next year ready to go.   I understand both situations are different.
Browns,3719b1,Coniuratos,1 point,Sun May 24 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"How many chances has Gordon had?   No, he's fucking done. He'll fuck up again, I'm willing to bet both of my nuts on it."
Browns,3719b1,iliekdrugs,2,Sun May 24 17:03:39 2015 UTC,We still have 2 years on his rookie contract when he comes back next year. He'll only be 25 next year too. It would be dumb for the Browns to get rid of such a talent in the prime of his career that's still on his rookie deal.   Do you think we'll keep him? I'm really debating it because he is one of the best young playmakers we have on the team. And he was suspended this year for drinking a beer on a flight to Vegas.  There's no new jersey for Gordon on nflshop.com or any other official website. The only way to get a Gordon jersey is to pay $50 more to make a custom jersey. Is the writing on the wall for Gordon?
Browns,3719b1,Spkk,6,Sat May 23 22:47:17 2015 UTC,"If they were going to cut him, they probably would have already cut him."
Browns,3719b1,topper_mango,2,Sat May 23 23:14:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm, what ever happened to his appeal over the game 16 suspension last year?  We may only have 1 year left on his contract"
Browns,3719b1,Daviroth,1 point,Sun May 24 00:35:16 2015 UTC,It seems most likely Gordon will not be ready to play come training camp next year. A full season completely separated from coaches and team is basically a death sentence for a pro athlete's career. I can't think of many examples of players who have come back from a full year suspension and played up to the same level.
Browns,3719b1,tohearnnr,2,Sat May 23 23:15:27 2015 UTC,"Anyone who moves from one team to another is in the same boat though.  Effectively cut off from their new team and coaches the prior year, not because they were suspended, but because they were on another team.  If Gordon gets his head straight and reports in shape and ready to roll, they can get him up to speed in a matter of weeks."
Browns,3719b1,NoMagic,2,Sat May 23 23:48:07 2015 UTC,Well it helps that Gordon is an athletic god. I don't think it'll help but for an athlete like Gordon I don't think it's a death sentence.
Browns,3719b1,draino3112,2,Sun May 24 05:50:35 2015 UTC,I'm not clear how much contact is allowed but Josh has a lot of friends on the team (Haden prime example) who if need be could funnel information to him.
Browns,3719b1,NoMagic,7,Sun May 24 09:04:08 2015 UTC,"When/if he comes back, it's likely he'll be treated as trade bait, at best.  Fuck up a Super Bowl and it's 4 games.  Drink a beer in the off-season and you lose your career.  Goodell still has to go. Running the NFL is no job for the aggressively stupid."
Browns,3719b1,miked1be,11,Sun May 24 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"Why is it people have such a hard time wrapping their head around his suspensions. He was suspended for a full year for breaking the same rule like 5 times. Saying ""gone for a year for drinking a beer"" leaves out that if it didn't have all these violations he could drink 16 beers and no on would give a shit.  He gone for a year because he is a repeat offender. Not because he's some innocent who Rodger Goodell decided to punish. Plus, the NFLPA agreed to these rules. Blame them too."
Browns,3719b1,SeekingMC,3,Sun May 24 05:34:18 2015 UTC,"Okay... the NFLPA is just as crazy as Goodell for creating a system that's 10x harsher than airline pilots for drug tests and ruins careers in the margin, but allows players to kick a quarterback in the fucking nutsack after a play is blown dead and pay a simple fine.  How's that?"

Browns,36vm6l,BurroughOwl,3,Fri May 22 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"The reverse impact is also just as likely...everything is under a microscope this season already, and really since JFF arrived. Let the kid have a chance to succeed under normal training camp conditions. Let the coaches coach him without worrying about HBO editing every conversation they have, showing every errant pass he throws, constantly bugging his teammates for their daily ""how's he doing"" quote. There will be plenty of media coverage as it is."
Browns,36vm6l,Carpetron,2,Fri May 22 18:49:58 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, but the media's love for him isn't going anywhere. This would give him a chance to show the world that he is a changed man and tell the story how he wants it to be told and not what the media will speculate about him."
Browns,36vm6l,Beezer12WashingBird,2,Fri May 22 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"I think you are giving HBO too much credit for allowing Johnny to control the narrative they edit and put forth.

Browns,36vm6l,Carpetron,2,Fri May 22 19:04:13 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I just think it gives him the platform to show that he has changed. He really just needs to prove it on the football field though.

Browns,36tw0x,TucanJamz,13,Fri May 22 02:11:51 2015 UTC,Can I request a cell phone too? I would think it would be kinda funny.  But seriously I'd like a farmer flair.

Browns,36tw0x,Doyle524,5,Fri May 22 02:32:06 2015 UTC,I love exhibit A and will look into implementing that. I've had a few ideas for some other new pieces of flair but I've been wicked busy over the last couple months. Hopefully this weekend I'll have some time to work on this :)

Browns,36tw0x,JohnStamosBRAH,2,Fri May 22 11:43:15 2015 UTC,Exhibit B looks like a black Terminator. So badass.   And I'd like to submit Jim O'Neil and Jimmy Haslam as members of the Quartet of Badassery.
Browns,36tw0x,Brokewood,9,Fri May 22 06:26:13 2015 UTC,"Unpopular Opinion:  Call me an old codger, but I hate these vanity flairs.  I think the flairs should only consist of Browns logos, past and present. Give me the Mastiff, give me Brownie, all iterations of him. Give me that old B football. Or the even older, never used, CB helmet.  I hate these newfangled lunchable flairs, money $igns, and people's faces. We're not /r/texans. And we shouldn't try to be. The Browns have always been about the clean, classic look. Our sub should reflect that.  Players leave, coaches get fired, but the Browns.... the Browns are forever.  /oldman rant"

Browns,36tw0x,Coniuratos,2,Fri May 22 21:21:28 2015 UTC,You're an old codger.
Browns,36tw0x,Beezer12WashingBird,0,Fri May 22 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from, the lunchable stuff and the money signs do get a little out of hand. Do you have a problem with the numbered jerseys?  Edit: I was just looking over our flair again, why do we have all the other teams? It just seems like wasted space, I'm sure there are some people who are fans of other teams that subscribe but enough to warrant adding flair for Jacksonville?"
Browns,36tw0x,Brokewood,3,Fri May 22 14:21:39 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I like the customization it allows.  If someone loves Isaiah Crowell, great. Put a #34 jersey on in your favorite color. Don't clutter up the flairs with crows, his head and 4 door sedans. Once Crowell's off the team, the flairs make no sense. So do we delete them? or let them sit there?   If all we have are the jerseys, no harm no foul, you can just change the number there. Instead, we now have some oscar meyer prepackaged lunch that makes no sense."
Browns,36tw0x,enigmaticevil,5,Fri May 22 14:24:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every team sub includes the other teams' logos. When a fan from another team stops by, it's good to know who they are."

Browns,36tpbg,jdog75,15,Fri May 22 02:26:56 2015 UTC,"When reddirs algorithms notice that a large number of people are being directed to a subreddit from a single link, and then having a large amount of interactions, they system flags it as vote brigading. They do this to stop subreddit from directing all of their subscribers to another subreddit to down vote everything.   The problem is that the link everyone clicked was from the mods of /r/AtlantaHawks and everyone who went over there were very friendly and there to have a good conversation. Because reddits systems cannot tell the difference between a good meeting of subreddits, and something more destructive, it flags it as vote brigading and shadow bans the people it feels took part in it."

Browns,36rj6o,Brokewood,3,Thu May 21 15:40:34 2015 UTC,kind of which the would have put Browns across the chest and Cleveland down the leg
Browns,36rj6o,hatmantc,8,Thu May 21 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"How about we don't need words on the pants at all, stripes were enough"
Browns,36rj6o,Carpetron,2,Thu May 21 19:23:23 2015 UTC,well my idea was more of in-case they are married to the idea... which i bet will grow on us over time

Browns,36rj6o,hatmantc,0,Thu May 21 17:28:05 2015 UTC,IIRC he gave the Indians last place just because he found the logo offensive. It may be offensive but using that in a uniform ranking is stupid.

Browns,36rj6o,chris101010,0,Thu May 21 16:06:32 2015 UTC,"This is a logically flawed argument, just because they look like another levels jerseys doesn't make them inferior. Lower talent level ≠ lower jersey quality.  Look at it this way, while the NFL is a huge corporate product they naturally have more restrictions on changing the jerseys so it is harder to update and refresh NFL jerseys than it is at a level where you do not have these concerns. So it then becomes impossible to incorporate any new stylistic elements if people don't like them because they look like ""high school/arena league"" jerseys since they will have naturally been able to change their jerseys quicker.   I am not saying new = better, but I do like the details in this jersey and bold new modern elements (texture on helmet and contrast stitching especially) and if you don't like any jersey because it looks ""arena league"" it will be impossible to update jerseys to include modern styles."

He's almost exactly the same size as Drew Brees 6' and 210 lbs.  Russell Wilson is 5'11"" and 206 lbs.  Where he seems small is when he is trying to create something with his legs and he's being caught by linemen and linebackers that are much bigger than him."

Interestingly enough, the most recent photos of Johnny it looks as if he's added about 5 pounds of muscle, so that's a plus."

Browns,36rp2o,NewRedditorHere,40,Thu May 21 16:17:07 2015 UTC,Most people around here dislike that jackass.
Browns,36rp2o,bmcclure937,22,Thu May 21 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'm HONESTLY not trying to be rude, but simply trying to gather information.  Didn't Shanahan advocate for the Browns to pass on Manziel?"
Browns,36rp2o,Trilljoy,30,Thu May 21 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"He did. But what I think /u/bmclcure937 is trying to get at is Shanahan has been a polarizing personality within both the Redskins and Browns organizations, and neither organization were very fond of him (alarming considering his father was the HC of the skins). His exit from the Browns was handled in an extremely unprofessional manner using the media against the Browns, but the Browns were more than happy to let him go without much of a fight (which suggests Shanahan didn't take the more professional route first).  I do think he is a good coordinator, but his personality can get in the way of that."
Browns,36rp2o,Trilljoy,11,Thu May 21 16:58:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely heard about that.  I guess in Washington he was just on a power trip, since he was working for his dad.  In Cleveland, I guess it's the coaches not letting him work with what he wants.  Another question:  how did Pettine handle Shanahan personally during all this drama that Shanahan was bringing the Browns?  Or was it all during the offseason and Pettine/GM just let him go?"
Browns,36rp2o,Trilljoy,11,Thu May 21 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"The drama never really happened until after the season. Pettine was quoted as saying he only wants people to work under him who want to be there, so he had no problem letting him go. While I can't say for certain, I do think Pettine is being sincere here because Shanahan was forced upon Pettine, hired by Lombardi and Banner, and I don't think he fit in well with how Pettine wanted to run things. So I don't think Shanahan had to go the route he did for his exit.  But, just to reiterate, Shanahan is a good coordinator. He had our offense of limited talent performing very well all things considered. I can understand he had a problem starting Manziel, if true. But you need to know your role, and not mail things in because your superiors are making judgement calls you don't agree with. We all have to deal with that."
Browns,36rp2o,Brokewood,5,Thu May 21 17:19:37 2015 UTC,Side question:  how do you feel about your new coordinator?
Browns,36rp2o,IamMcSqueeb,11,Thu May 21 17:28:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about him yet, but my first impressions from watching press conferences and interviews are the same when we hired Shanahan. Both initially seemed intelligent, quick, and very confident in their ability to do the job. I like the idea of young, smart coordinators because the NFL game is evolving again right before our eyes, and having coaches with some adaptability left is a good thing.  (I have to get back to work lol, I won't be able to answer anymore questions)"
Browns,36rp2o,Duke_of_Balloons,7,Thu May 21 17:33:01 2015 UTC,"Intrigued.  He claims to tailor his scheme to the talent available. And we'll have no idea because Flip has never called plays in the NFL. Derek Carr loved working with him when he was at the Raiders. We know he utilizes RBs in a passing game way more than Shanahan. Flip also puts emphasis on utility FB/TE, but that's about where we're at. I'm cautiously optimistic about what he can do. And all of that optimism comes from Pett's love of his work ethic.  We shall see. Any change, even a change for the better, is always accompanied by drawbacks and discomforts."
Browns,36rp2o,bgrueyw,3,Thu May 21 17:43:25 2015 UTC,Honestly it's a better opinion than of Shanahan at the start. Pettine is excited for him unlike Shanahan who he just kinda got lumped with. This team is now all people that want to work with pettine and are trying really hard to prove themselves. I think Shanahan had a little too much arrogance to be on this coaching staff.  But can't say I know much about him because he hasn't called any plays yet. Would say my opinion is that I'm excited to see him do work
Browns,36rp2o,bmcclure937,3,Thu May 21 20:06:36 2015 UTC,"On the plus side, he has run a bunch of different offenses with QBs, had a good year with Carr, and the topper is that we almost hired him last year over Shannahan, so there is already faith in him.   The down side, he's a rookie OC and that's always a gamble."
Browns,36rp2o,GGStokes,5,Fri May 22 06:09:47 2015 UTC,"They've been pretty tight-lipped about everything. Part of the problem in between Pettine and Shanahan is that they didn't really have a relationship prior to coaching here. Considering everything between Washington and Cleveland I would guess that Shanahan must be extremely hard to work with because from a football mind perspective he really knows his stuff, and still teams appear glad when he is gone."
Browns,36rp2o,miked1be,8,Thu May 21 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a huge red flag.  Hopefully his entitled ass likes it here with an established quarterback and Julio."
Browns,36rp2o,OutdatedReferences,11,Thu May 21 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly the reason why many fans dislike him. I was commenting from a mobile app, sorry to upset others because I posted a short and sweet reply that echoed the majority of Browns fans' feelings.  Shanahan is a young and stubborn OC. He is good at his craft but pitches a fit when things do not go his way. Simple enough. He came here and did a decent job with what he had to work with... our run game the first part of the season could not have looked better!! Then shit started to hit the fan and our offense stalled out and Shanahan decided he didn't want to work for the rest of his contract with the Browns and jumped ship.  Do I blame him for running from dysfunction? No. But it is still a bitch move to back out of a commitment when we are paying you to do a job. Do the job and move on when your job is done."
Browns,36rp2o,miked1be,7,Thu May 21 17:39:36 2015 UTC,Trust me -- Falcons fans understand.
Browns,36rp2o,Duke_of_Balloons,8,Fri May 22 00:39:24 2015 UTC,"I don't remember any reports about him wanting to nor not wanting to draft Manziel but there were rumors that he didn't want to start him at all or rather didn't want to bench Hoyer.  I really think Manziel starting was a product of people wanting Hoyer out more than they wanted Manziel in.    The issue most fans have with Shanahan is the fact that a bunch of negative stuff in the press came from somewhere about the time that he was asking to leave so it's extremely fishy.  He was brought in with previous management (Banner/Lombardi) and then Banner was consulting on the coaching search with Atlanta when magically a bunch of negative stuff hit the press and Shanahan was asking to leave to head to Atlanta.  Kyle either leaked that stuff to make his exit more justified or he talked to Banner about it and he leaked it for the same goal.  It just doesn't look good.  He was a late hire last season so it seems like he only joined the Browns because it was that or sit out a year, he just didn't seem to fit in with the way Pettine was runing the team.  There's also the fact that there were reports of Redskins players and later Browns players being happy he was gone.  I truly hope for your sake he's done some growing and you won't run into issues like that or that at least he's in a situation he likes more than he liked here and nothing bad comes up."
Browns,36rp2o,miked1be,6,Thu May 21 17:00:21 2015 UTC,"I never thought about the Banner aspect!  Great insight.   And I hope we can contain him too.  I think we can.  He was brought in to work with Matt Ryan, not coach him up.  I imagine that if he starts with that shit again, Quinn/Ryan will do something about it.  Quinn is a HUGE Ryan fan(duh, he's his head coach now).  And Ryan is HEAVILY supported by the fan base, Dan Quinn, and more specifically Arthur Blank.  This is Matt's team.  Ryan isn't working FOR Shanahan.  They're working together.  So I imagine that if he continues with petty drama, he'll get run out faster than anyone.  Our offense is already semi-established.  I imagine that at the first signs of drama, he's gone."
Browns,36rp2o,fap-the-potato,2,Thu May 21 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"The same could be said about a supportive fanbase and owner in Washington when RG3 got there. Of course, Griffin had his own issues he brought to that party."
Browns,36rp2o,fap-the-potato,1 point,Thu May 21 18:26:18 2015 UTC,"There are reports that Mike let Kyle walk around like he was the head coach so there is a definite sense of entitlement there.  Also, the owner seemed far more supportive of Griffin than he did the coaching staff so I'm sure that could put a bad taste in Kyle's mouth.  Hopefully, for Atlanta's sake, with a strong leader he has rapport with that isn't his dad in charge and some playmakers to use on offense he'll be happy."
Browns,36rp2o,youwithme,3,Thu May 21 18:34:52 2015 UTC,"I might be biased, but I think he's finally at the spot where he's wanted to be.  I'm not excusing his behavior at Wash. and Cleveland, but I think the situation is different.  It always is, I know.  But here's to hoping he keeps his head out of his ass."
Browns,36rp2o,Duke_of_Balloons,2,Thu May 21 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"but I think he's finally at the spot where he's wanted to be.   Idk pal, he's clearly waiting to jumpship to HC as soon as he can. So even if he does great things for your team, that won't mean much long term for the Falcons."
Browns,36rp2o,Dinowhaleball,2,Fri May 22 06:12:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, definitely.  I give it 3 years max."
Browns,36rp2o,jcmck0320,1 point,Fri May 22 13:16:26 2015 UTC,but I think he's finally at the spot where he's wanted to be.   As an OC?  I agree that he probably is right where he wants to be.  If your team has success though he's most likely going to push hard for a HC job.  It's his ultimate goal.  I know that should be the goal of any coach in the league but he seems to have been jumping around whenever possible to try to position himself for it instead of sticking somewhere out and working hard where he's at.
Browns,36rp2o,bmcclure937,3,Thu May 21 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"As an OC, yes.  I feel like with the personnel we have, he will be able to truly flourish enough to be a candidate for the HC job he's been wanting."
Browns,36rp2o,miked1be,0,Thu May 21 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"well if you believe the pundits and media, i think everyone but a random homeless man wanted the browns to pass on manziel."
Browns,36rp2o,djroomba322,3,Thu May 21 16:59:35 2015 UTC,Who was it that decided that Manziel would be the pick?  GM?  Pettine?
Browns,36rp2o,MightBeKindOfADick,6,Thu May 21 17:12:59 2015 UTC,"Well that depends on who you ask. The front office is adamant that he was a pick they all wanted. But you can't really expect someone to come out and say ""Nope, didn't want the guy! Hated 'im! Looks like the kinda kid who sticks his fingers in the cups of water.""  However the media is hellbent on the narrative that a homeless man told Jimmy Haslam to draft Johnny and that Haslam is the one who pushed the to deal happen.   So to be honest...we really don't know what the real story is. We just have good guesses."
Browns,36rp2o,Trilljoy,0,Thu May 21 17:21:46 2015 UTC,Haslam
Browns,36rp2o,djroomba322,1 point,Thu May 21 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"I've also heard he was the reason we passed on Bridgewater. So, yeah.      I don't wanna wish bad on the Falcons, but he literally gave up last year. Even in our worse years, I've never seen a coordinator just quit doing their job. So that might give some more context for the visceral reactions, that and the being a complete prick on the way out.     Luckily you don't have Brian Hoyer at QB and have some nice WRs.  How is your O-line though? If they have trouble running the zone scheme then your passing attack is up a creek, I'm sure everyone has already told you about Mack going down."
Browns,36rp2o,snwborder52,1 point,Fri May 22 06:07:22 2015 UTC,"I'll never forget when it showed Manziel come off the field and sit on the bench after a bad drive, and Kyle just sat there next to him looking bored, like a petulant child.  Not even talking him through what happened or whatever coordinators talk about on the bench.  Fuck that guy!"

Browns,36rp2o,djroomba322,-15,Fri May 22 04:06:43 2015 UTC,"That should relieve the OP.  People who can't understand how the first year in a decade we run a real offense and go 7-9 based on his scheme and playcalling should be laughed at.  For OP:  As others have said, he utilizes the play action and QB bootlegs a lot.   I don't feel that you're going to get a very accurate look at what you'll see in Atlanta because you guys have real weapons and receivers, and he had udfa 5'7"" guys.    The most important thing you can take away from it, this is the first year since our return we had comeback wins.  He made a ton of adjustments at half time.  He did many plays and formations in the first half as set up plays and came back to it in the second half.     But to your original question again, he did his best to form the offense to the talent he had at the time, whether it be when Gordon came back, or we're on our 3rd center, or our 3rd QB.   He's easily been the best OC we've had since our return and its sad to see him go."

Browns,36rp2o,Doyle524,-11,Thu May 21 17:02:09 2015 UTC,"A) You clearly have no idea what the word irony means or how it is used, because that's wrong.  You're attempting to infer its situational irony, which is notoriously misused.    B) I didn't call anyone a name. I judge only the opinions, not the people.  People who have that type of opinion, should be laughed at.  People who think the earth is flat should be laughed at.  Its similar in terms of obviousness.   On top of that, I responded to a serial poster who's shown time and again (and even in this thread) where he said he makes inferences and posts his own narrative instead of facts."

The only reason I believe it isn't as poor of an environment as you think it is is that Shanny is the only one who wanted out so badly. With the amount of people involved Shanny is definitely an outlier, not a majority."
Browns,36rp2o,hermanthetrout,-3,Thu May 21 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"Well, Haslam isn't going anywhere.  Pettine is a first time coach, so him trying to get out means he doesn't get a job somewhere else, so he's kind of stuck.   Farmer is the main culprit of the actual environment, so he's not interested in going anywhere.  Hoyer already got out as well as shanny.  I don't know who else you'd even have to talk about."
Browns,36rp2o,djroomba322,4,Fri May 22 02:18:53 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of position coaches and other players that could have even anonymously mentioned that something was up and not right. To me there are a lot more people who are staying put rather than leaving, like a fuckton more, and since all Shanny had to do was ask to go and they let him I'm sure they would've done the same for anyone who wanted it, and no one took it."
Browns,36rp2o,hermanthetrout,-3,Fri May 22 03:14:40 2015 UTC,"http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/team/coaches.html  compare that to the 2014 coaching roster.  Most of the of them on offense are gone, either quit or removed.  So... i still don't understand who you're talking about."
Browns,36rp2o,youwithme,2,Fri May 22 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"So ""most"" means half on just offense? Plus the issues that are referenced are team wide, not just on the offense.  According to this list. We have the same TE coach, OL coach, assistant OL coach, RB coach. Roper's position isn't listed there and neither is Edgerly's. Taking those two out (obviously) we only lost Shanny, Loggains, McDaniel, and Hightower. So quite literally half. Loggains was fired for not doing his job well. Shanny asked to leave. I don't know about McDaniel or Hightower so you have maybe two other people that had similar concerns as Shanny. Two."
Browns,36rp2o,kuhlmader1,0,Fri May 22 06:04:11 2015 UTC,"McDaniel is friends with Shanahan and followed him to the team, not a shocker that he followed him to the Falcons (he's also the one that was on the plane with Gordon when he had his drink.  Conspiracy!).  Hightower followed Shanahan over from Washington so he's probably in a similar boat.  Not surprising that a certain someone would call maybe half of the guys ""most"" to push his own narrative though."

Browns,36rp2o,thamilton7,13,Thu May 21 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"Hey, welcome to our board.  From what I remember, our run game was our offense. We really used that run game to set up a lot of deep throws. Seemed like a lot of deep crossing patterns as well, with the QB on the move. Hoyer had a lot of success with this because the run game was such a threat early in the season.  I'm not sure how that will translate over to your system with the personnel you guys have. I'm sure the passing attack will be much more dynamic for you guys. You have better WRs and a better QB than we had last year.   I'm sure the reason Julio is saying that is because his routes will be much deeper, Kyle likes getting his WRs in one on one positions downfield and let them make a play.   Hope that helps."

Browns,36rp2o,TotesMessenger,12,Thu May 21 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly no expert but this is just what I saw.  This could all be very different because you guys have a much more talented QB than anything we had last season.  Basically he seems to rely on a strong run game to bring the defense up and open up deeper routes.  He'll use pitches, hand offs, or sometimes dump off passes then burn the secondary with a QB bootleg that gives a receiver time to get open deep.  Receivers might have to use athleticism to get open while the QB is rolling out and extending the play or something along those lines."

He was run heavy here, but that isn't standard for him; we have a much better offensive line than Atlanta and are much worse at skill positions so he did what he had to. He is good to great at creating the best plan for the team to succeed and poor to bad at deviating and making changes to that plan. He'll open up your passing game a lot and I'm looking for Jones to be huge this year (at least in FF)."
Browns,36rp2o,TemujinRi,11,Thu May 21 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"He is good to great at creating the best plan for the team to succeed and poor to bad at deviating and making changes to that plan.   This is definitely the most succinct way to describe him.  Apparently Alex Mack even felt the same way:   Considered one of the game’s best centers, Mack isn’t anticipating a production drop-off upon return. But he wasn’t exactly shocked to see the team's rushing numbers drop without him. That would have happened anyway, he said. The Browns were running the ball at a fervent pace, so he knew defenses would eventually adjust and the offense needed a counter move that never came.   http://espn.go.com/blog/cleveland-browns/post/_/id/12637/alex-mack-dishes-on-challenging-season-cautious-rehab-plan"
Browns,36rp2o,740Buckeye,4,Thu May 21 17:17:25 2015 UTC,"It was different with us until Josh Gordon came back, but Shanahan's offense focuses largely on WR1. 80% of his passing plays target him. His plays are designed to give him space. Look at Pierre Garcon's production in 2013. He led the league with 113 receptions and targets with 182. Julio is going to have a productive year, so he should probably get in shape."

As soon as he sees a higher step, he'll take it and f&@$ you over for being in the vacinity when he does. Because he'll throw your whole organization under the bus to make himself not look bad, and justified for not having the honor to stand by his contract. Though you'll most likely decide he was better off the team than on. Just the same as every other team he has been on."

Browns,36rp2o,24rubikscube,4,Thu May 21 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"Julio will be running deep routes, a lot of deep routes. Not sure if that makes it intense but he will be expected to run more than usual.   Shanny loves play action and having the run game set up the passing attack. You need to have a good RB and O line for it to be effective, but given the WRs and QB the Falcons have the run game will not need to be as impressive. Either way he likes to do a even mix of run and pass, with a trick play or two per game just because he wants, to show off how smart he is.   Issues with him will be his lack of adaptability in game and refusal to listen to others. Once his game plan is set, it is set and nothing will change that. Also if he gets upset with the FO he will burn bridges without a care. As far as an OC he is above average, should be fine for you guys."

I'm not 100%, and i could be wrong.   Either way having been to the old ones and to the convention center i'm going to shoehorn both together in my own uniformed opinion.  Go. it's fun, it's enjoyable, and you get do fun stuff. Don't worry too much about how packed it is. If it is, then you can divert and go have fun with them downtown. There should be fun stuff to do for the kiddos. The inflatable village (to me at least) sounds fun and i'm wondering if it's JUST for kids or if i'm allowed to play on it too because i'm a bit jealous.

Browns,36myfd,ctnp,3,Wed May 20 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"Ha, it's literally the first picture when you type in ""Joe Thomas field goal"" into google.   Google-fu - with great power comes great responsibility."

Browns,36myfd,Browns27,3,Wed May 20 19:17:30 2015 UTC,It's actually humorous nowadays listening to them basically write an oral essay on a (perceived) controversial call.  Times they do change.  I'll just old-man my way out.
Browns,36myfd,topper_mango,4,Wed May 20 19:29:05 2015 UTC,This was the year that I became a fan. The Browns were on TV and Dad jumps up from his chair yelling something about putting Jim Brown back into the game. I was just a toddler but it was the first time that I had seen Dad so animated and yelling at the TV. A handful of years later I'm wearing my Browns jersey to football practice every day.

Browns,36mctd,kuss51292,6,Wed May 20 13:09:41 2015 UTC,The 2014 Training Camp Schedule was released June 20th last year. Can probably expect a similar release date this year.
Browns,36kl3f,themitey1,18,Wed May 20 01:51:46 2015 UTC,Good ol' Chase Goodbread reporting.  What a name.
Browns,36kl3f,zerozero27,4,Wed May 20 02:09:59 2015 UTC,My graduating class from uni was filled with astoundingly awesome reporter names.  Clay Manship being my favorite.
Browns,36kl3f,JohnnyFire,2,Wed May 20 14:00:10 2015 UTC,Wes Mantooth in your class too?
Browns,36kl3f,droidworkerbee,3,Wed May 20 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"Nah, but I did know a Chip Johnson.  Not as good, but Chip is always the sports reporter."
Browns,36kl3f,JohnnyFire,13,Wed May 20 17:25:05 2015 UTC,"The only thing that seems to be true with the draft analysis so far is that no one agrees on the Browns. Some say we vastly improved, others say our picks made no sense, others say it was a high risk draft past the 1st pick. I just want to see them all on the field."
Browns,36kl3f,average_white_male,16,Wed May 20 02:40:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of people really, really wanted the Browns to draft a WR and/or a QB fairly early.  Those people usually think our draft sucked.  I would've been fine with Parker at #12 or Perriman at #19, but I think we got better players in Shelton and Erving.  We'll see soon enough I guess, but I'm hyped about our defense across the board."
Browns,36kl3f,TapedeckNinja,10,Wed May 20 05:24:19 2015 UTC,"100% this. Most of the draft-haters tend to be people who think Farmer fucked up by not drafting a wideout. Or are pissed we didn't trade up for Bryce Petty or some nonsense.   I've been saying since the day last season ended, DL-OL in the first round. So glad that's what we went with."
Browns,36kl3f,Troop-the-Loop,8,Wed May 20 12:46:47 2015 UTC,"Right ... you can't have your cake and eat it too.  The Browns can't hit home-runs at every position in one off-season.  If they make a blockbuster trade to move up for Mariota, then we probably still have the worst run defense in the league (on paper) going in to this season.  If they take Parker at #12 we're probably in a similar position (as there wasn't really good value on the DL at #19).  Given that they added Hartline and Bowe (who are both competent if unexciting receivers), it makes sense that they targeted what was statistically the weakest unit on the team with a lot of their early picks.  Some people seem to think that the Browns operate in a vacuum.  They didn't trade up to get a ""franchise QB"" and they didn't bring in a Suh or Cobb or Maclin caliber FA, so they ""failed.""  Never mind the fact that free agents get to choose where they go and selling the farm to move up in the draft is not, historically, a smart move.  These are probably the same kind of people who would tell you not to ""make excuses"" if a tanker-truck flipped over on the highway and caused you to be late to work.  You should've left earlier.  You should've gone off-road.  A real go-getter would've found a way to get to work on time.  The Browns should've tried harder."
Browns,36kl3f,TapedeckNinja,-1,Wed May 20 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"I am just looking forward to Farmer actually drafting talent in the 1st round for once, 3rd times the charm!"
Browns,36kl3f,brobeerme,2,Wed May 20 17:22:22 2015 UTC,Are you implying Danny Shelton isn't talent drafted in the first round?
Browns,36kl3f,Troop-the-Loop,2,Wed May 20 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"He looks like it, but then again so did Bark Mingo, Justin Gilbert, and Johnny Manziel, all 3 had near zero impact in first + seasons in which 1st rounders are suppose to have.  You draft in the 1st round for immediate impact, even at QB.  That being said  I have more confidence in Danny Shelton panning out than I did the others.  Other than that, Farmer is does a good job drafting outside the 1st round."
Browns,36kl3f,brobeerme,2,Wed May 20 17:33:48 2015 UTC,"You draft in the 1st round for immediate impact, even at QB.    People say this all the time, but I don't understand why.  Seems like some arbitrary false axiom.    I'd rather have a guy who started off shaky for 1-2 years but plays at a high level during his prime than a guy who starts off a starter and quickly hits his ceiling and that's all he ever is.  This can be heavily position dependent, however."
Browns,36kl3f,TopHatAbobo,2,Wed May 20 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"Justin Gilbert   Isn't this kinda meaningless though, Patrick Peterson was absolutely terrible as a rookie at CB, but if you were to redraft the 2011 class aren't you taking him 2nd or 3rd overall?"
Browns,36kl3f,bgrueyw,1 point,Wed May 20 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"Pat Pete is great but are you serious? For starters I'm taking jj watt, can Newton, Tyron smith, Sherman, Justin Huston, aj green, Von miller, Julio jones, marcel Darius, maybe Aldon smith all before him and those were just the guys I could think of off the top of my head. That draft was loaded."
Browns,36kl3f,Putuinurplace,2,Fri May 22 20:01:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Though I'd be hesitant to add Justin Gilbert to that list of 1st round failures. He's only played one season, and while it was lackluster, I wouldn't necessarily call it bad.   I'm not a Gilbert fan yet, but I'm not writing the guy off. Could turn out to be a solid addition to our secondary."
Browns,36kl3f,Troop-the-Loop,2,Wed May 20 17:44:12 2015 UTC,"As far as not having an impact at the spot he was drafted and the expectations that were set for him in his first year , his first year was a total failure. Maybe he will pan out, then again we are going on year 3 with Mingo waiting for him to pan out, #6 overall.  To be fair, I expected Manziel to do nothing in his first year based on his size, play style, and ridiculous ego.  I still don't expect him to be anything, I hope I am wrong."
Browns,36kl3f,brobeerme,-14,Wed May 20 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"Probably because the fact we don't have a single player on our team that has caught more than 2-3 touchdowns in the last few years, or even in their career. That might be why.  He either screwed up with the players he brought in, in FA or the draft.  Not one or the other, but in combination of both, he definitely screwed up.   I've been saying since the day last season ended, DL-OL in the first round. So glad that's what we went with.   All this tells me is that it more than likely was the wrong choice then based off your previous posting history."
Browns,36kl3f,djroomba322,6,Wed May 20 13:16:00 2015 UTC,"Well you clearly know best. Maybe you should apply for the Browns GM job, since you'd do a much better job of it.   We don't need elite WR's. We don't even have a good enough QB to throw to them, yet. I believe the run game will be the heart of our offense, so beefing up the lines is a good idea.   Wanna make a friendly wager? I'd be willing to put down money we finish with a better record this year than last year. If you're so convinced that Farmer screwed up, should be a safe bet for you. Right?   EDIT: And if we're talking about post-history. Dude. You have no room to talk.   EDIT2: OOOH OOH. Forget betting money. If I win, you leave /r/Browns forever. If you win, I leave /r/Browns forever. Much better deal."
Browns,36kl3f,Troop-the-Loop,-10,Wed May 20 13:19:05 2015 UTC,"Again, judging from your post history, you don't seem like a very trustworthy or true person, so I'm not going to waste my time.  I've already got multiple bets for actual money we're going to hit the under on the vegas line which was 6 last time bets were placed.  if I was GM we wouldn't have had Richardson or Weeden, so sure, I'd definitely do a better job.  But then again, a monkey throwing poop at at random pictures would do a better job.   We don't need elite WR's.   Who said we need elite receivers?  We need good receivers.  Which we don't have."
Browns,36kl3f,djroomba322,8,Wed May 20 13:27:35 2015 UTC,"FARMER WAS NOT GM WHEN WE DRAFTED THOSE GUYS DUMBASS. Yes, he was on the payroll as assistant GM, and had a say in who we picked. But you cannot ascribe those picks to him. He did not have final say.   Seems like you're a little scared to put your money where your mouth is. It's all well and good to talk about bets, and to make outlandish claims. When forced to stand by your claims, you run and hide. Typical djroomba doucheyness.   Come on. Bet me. 6 wins and under, I'll disappear from this sub. 7 and up, you're gone for good. If you're so sure in yourself, and I'm such a moron, what are you afraid of?"
Browns,36kl3f,Troop-the-Loop,-6,Wed May 20 13:30:43 2015 UTC,"Name calling isn't permitted, but again, as you continue to prove, you're not really here to talk football but berate people who don't agree with you.  Farmer has never been a part of an organization that had a good QB.   Farmer picked Gilbert and Manziel, that's fireable on itself.  Farmer brought in McCown.     Come on. Bet me. 6 wins and under, I'll disappear from this sub. 7 and up, you're gone for good. If you're so sure in yourself, and I'm such a moron, what are you afraid of?   I'll make the bet you offered that we're going to finish better than last year (lol), but you're a nobody who's name I won't remember in an hour.  So you'll have to remind me next year when you lose."
Browns,36kl3f,djroomba322,3,Wed May 20 13:37:53 2015 UTC,I am curious. What GM would you like the Browns to hire? Who is your favorite?
Browns,36kl3f,DasJarnold,4,Wed May 20 15:57:35 2015 UTC,Alright let's make that bet. Here's your reminder.
Browns,36kl3f,Troop-the-Loop,6,Wed May 20 13:40:28 2015 UTC,He doesn't seem trustworthy or true? You have like 5 names you use to spam this sub get the fuck out of here
Browns,36kl3f,qck11,2,Wed May 20 17:56:30 2015 UTC,It will be really easy to spot him though.  He always resorts to the same tired talking points over and over and over.
Browns,36kl3f,TopHatAbobo,0,Wed May 20 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"I literally just talked to a mod and his response is that ""the users know who he is and can just ignore him and move on""   How is that a logical solution to a constant troll?"
Browns,36kl3f,qck11,-1,Wed May 20 19:24:22 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand what spam means.  And reddit names are meaningless.  Thanks for your helpful input and thoughtful conversation.

Browns,36kl3f,TopHatAbobo,-5,Wed May 20 18:46:20 2015 UTC,Greg little would work on this team better than bowe.
Browns,36kl3f,djroomba322,7,Wed May 20 19:42:00 2015 UTC,"I find that hard to swallow considering he currently does not work on this, or any, team.  Bowe had more yards last year than Greg Little had in any year he played in the league.  Bowe is also renowned for his blocking prowess which is the only area in which Greg Little was actually productive.  I don't even like Bowe, but he is objectively better than Greg Little."
Browns,36kl3f,TopHatAbobo,4,Wed May 20 20:10:14 2015 UTC,BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Browns,36kl3f,TapedeckNinja,3,Thu May 21 01:55:59 2015 UTC,"The reason NFL gave us a high grade was because it was focusing just on defense, which we rocked. We had 7 picks just dedicated defense, which only 19 teams had more than 7 picks total. We had the worst run defense last year (4.5 ypa, most rushing yards per game) and we dedicated 3 of the top 100 picks in the draft to fixing this. Of course we should look good in rankings, we had the best defensive backs and just stocked up our line.   I don't think many people who ranked the draft can say we messed up the defensive side; but because we play offense and defense in the NFL the draft isn't as much a home run. We ""needed"" play makers and a QB, but drafted a lineman when we have 5 great ones (note: I totally agree with this pick and understand it, others don't), a RB when we have 2 starters, and waited till the third day to get a WR and that guy didn't play football four years ago.   I think we nailed it, but I understand why others don't think so."
Browns,36kl3f,bearsdriving,5,Wed May 20 13:30:53 2015 UTC,but drafted a lineman when we have 5 great ones    I think this might be a bit of an exaggeration.  :)

Correct me if I'm wrong but Tim Couch never played in the playoffs, Kelley Holcomb did and threw for some sort of playoff record and we still lost. I was young and don't remember it too much but I'm almost positive it was Holcomb"
Browns,36g67e,AlCapooter,3,Tue May 19 09:29:21 2015 UTC,This is correct.

Browns,36f1cs,Resident_Wizard,10,Tue May 19 20:02:03 2015 UTC,Seriously doubt it was because of any potential distraction.  The Sandusky think first broke like 4 years ago and hasn't been in the news for some time.  Most people probably didn't know or care about the fact that his son worked for the Browns.
Browns,36f1cs,miked1be,2,Mon May 18 22:11:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, it happened a while ago and the Browns kept him around this long, I doubt it was related. It's not like him being related to Jerry at all reflects on him as a person."
Browns,36f19o,KevinMack25,4,Mon May 18 21:49:34 2015 UTC,I think Pullard will at least be a decent rotational guy. I like most of the picks that the Browns made as long as they don't draft like this every year.
Browns,36f19o,ChairyCweed,3,Mon May 18 22:23:22 2015 UTC,Let's hope the 4th rounder we spent on Mayle makes HIM a decent rotational guy...a lot of scouts had him as an undrafted FA
Browns,36f19o,Carpetron,7,Mon May 18 23:25:47 2015 UTC,I may be way off on this but I like the Mayle signing. I think he has a lot more potential than people give him credit for and can really start putting up serious numbers in a year or two. Especially with guys like Bowe and Hawkins to learn from. I accept he's not an instant remedy but in a few years he will be well worth the pick.
Browns,36f19o,tenfingersandtoes,4,Tue May 19 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"Coug here: Mayle is a pure physical specimen, beautiful build, high high high ceiling. He's a bit of a project skills wise but the tools are there. He may not be a huge contributor in his first year but with a little work his potential ceiling is more than worth it. It IS a good signing."
Browns,36dz73,bmcclure937,31,Mon May 18 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"""When trying to relay his game strategy to Pettine, Flip sensed confusion, and clarified for the stoic coach by stating 'No no, Mike. It's like y'know, what the secondary does after they recover a turnover, how they try to get a touchdown... Like, instead of intercepting, or snagging a fumble, we just start with the ball'. Upon this information, Pettine strapped on his trademark wraparounds, cracked a can of Natty, and sauntered out of the room, shouting 'DE-FENSE! WOOF WOOF!'"""

Browns,36djqc,NameSnag,8,Mon May 18 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"And people said he had an off year (maybe not here, but the forum I talk Browns at had many Thomas nitpickers which drove me crazy. Trolls, likely)."
Browns,36djqc,enigmaticevil,10,Mon May 18 15:46:02 2015 UTC,"He's the best pass blocker in the NFL but since he's maybe the eighth best run blocker people like to pretend he's terrible at it. His run blocking is good, but without Mack he couldn't compensate on his own."
Browns,36djqc,Marzman315,2,Mon May 18 15:58:18 2015 UTC,"This, and thats why I think people give him a lot of shit for the way he played last year.   A chain is only as good as it's weakest link, and hoooooooooly fuckin shit did we have some links made of spaghetti last year."
Browns,36djqc,740Buckeye,3,Mon May 18 20:53:08 2015 UTC,He did have a couple holding penalties later in the season from what I recall. I think he had 2-3 on one game which seemed highly uncharacteristic for him. I would assume that is what they mean by it.
Browns,36djqc,Mustang1718,3,Mon May 18 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, according to Pro Football Reference, he had 6 penalties all season.  http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/ThomJo28/penalties/2014/  Edit: 10 penalties counting the ones declined by the opposition."
Browns,36djqc,enigmaticevil,2,Mon May 18 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah and like 3 of them were in one game iirc. That was an off game for everyone. Think that was near the end, when johnny was in and our line was rubble"

Browns,36djqc,enigmaticevil,4,Mon May 18 16:46:08 2015 UTC,So far the only Browns to make the list other than Joe T (20) have been Dansby (95) and Bitonio (47)  Haden going to make the list in the top 10?
Browns,36djqc,AnonymousBrownsFan,3,Mon May 18 16:00:49 2015 UTC,"Probably not. Based on last season alone, the omission is upsetting but not that surprising."
Browns,36djqc,droidworkerbee,2,Mon May 18 16:15:55 2015 UTC,no way dansby should be ahead of him though.
Browns,36djqc,dmintz,2,Mon May 18 20:23:35 2015 UTC,Dansby was PFF's #8 ILB.  Haden was the #28 CB (those first two games covering Antonio Brown and Jimmy Graham really killed his season-long grade).  What's more surprising to me is that Whitner didn't make the list.  I bet he was close.
Browns,36djqc,TapedeckNinja,2,Mon May 18 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"Ya seriously though, Haden is not the #28 Cb. granted he does have trouble against smaller shiftier guys, but he is in without a doubt top 5 maybe higher. Don't get me wrong though. Dansby is an animal and was one of the best free agent signings i've seen in a while."
Browns,36djqc,dmintz,1 point,Tue May 19 00:10:53 2015 UTC,"I remember his rough start, the first 4 games were the worst I had ever seen him play, but after that he went back to his pro bowl self. While he probably won't make top 10, top 15 wouldn't surprise me."

Browns,36bk2f,TapedeckNinja,3,Mon May 18 15:59:30 2015 UTC,I didn't hear about that but I would like to know more
Browns,36bk2f,giannini1222,3,Mon May 18 01:51:02 2015 UTC,This subs twitter account tweeted a link to it. The thread was posted by a user with the name mike shanahan in it I believe.
Browns,36bk2f,Coniuratos,2,Mon May 18 02:13:42 2015 UTC,You can see it on /u/Mike_Shanahan's profile page.
Browns,36bk2f,TapedeckNinja,3,Mon May 18 02:31:12 2015 UTC,"Just happened to stumble across some further information ...  http://cle.scout.com/forums/4409-the-watercooler/13840419-manziel-town-hall-pub-saturday-night  That's a thread from over on the OBR ... from May 4th.  Someone in the thread denied it and said JFF was 100% not there (and the legitimacy of said denial was vouched for by Lane Adkins himself).  Not sure if this was a separate ""sighting"" or not, but I will say I've seen pictures of Jim Brown at TownHall, so I wonder if there's some sort of unofficial team affiliation there."
Browns,36bk2f,blackedout,9,Mon May 18 21:16:38 2015 UTC,"No idea what happened. None of my business what the kid does with his friends, and I don't think it is anyone else's.   Here's information on recovering alcoholics and social situations/bars/friends just so people are more informed as to why they shouldn't have an opinion.   http://www.zensobriety.com/avoiding-alcohol"
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-31,Mon May 18 05:08:48 2015 UTC,"None of my business what the kid does with his friends,   It sure as fuck is your business. He's on payroll. He made it our business last year betraying our trust. He's getting paid millions of dollars to play football.  Its our business if he's doing stuff that is going to make him incapable of doing that.  And he proved pretty clearly last year he isnt capable of doing it while hanging out at bars.  How in the world is this NOT our business?  Yeah, I see josh gordon smoking weed on instagram ""LOL NOT OUR BUSINESS!"" no."
Browns,36bk2f,TopHatAbobo,19,Mon May 18 11:00:04 2015 UTC,"The ""bar"" is the same one he went to last time, a couple of weeks ago.  Calling it a bar is like calling Chipotle a bar because they happen to serve alcohol.  I don't want to put words in the mouth of /u/blackedout, but I believe he's saying it's none of our business because Manziel wasn't drinking and it's absurd to follow him around and point out every time he's AROUND alcohol due to its ubiquitous nature in our society.  That's worse than TMZ."
Browns,36bk2f,droidworkerbee,9,Mon May 18 11:22:24 2015 UTC,"I've already made these arguments with others, so I'll bite with you too.  It's perspective. Johnny is not on my payroll, he's on the payroll of a team I enjoy. He's not personally responsible to me, but to his employer / teammates / friends and family. I have a vested interest in his future, but he owes nothing to me on a personal level.  Addiction sucks and Johnny's rehabilitation might fail. He could have a shitty game against a tough defense and not have the will/support to not reach for the bottle and get hammered (or whatever his drug is). He might realize he can't hack it and turn to it in preseason. He might get hooked on painkillers in three years. I don't know, and I can't predict, but I recognize it as a possibility.  I know people who have fallen on all levels of that spectrum. I have a close family member who is getting their 30 year chip in the fall. It's his third attempt to stay sober and this one has stuck a lot better than the last two. I have friends who have been hit with a DUI and not changed a damn thing, only to find themselves in the same situation months later. In either case, judgment and shame is about the worst thing to offer that person. If Johnny relapses, it's entirely possible his chances at football with the Browns or otherwise are done, and he'll have an extra added difficulty as a person getting through that because his failure won't be limited to the people who know him, it'll be headline news. As a player, it'll be time to let him go, shake our heads, and move on as best we can. As a person, if we want him to have a decent life, harassing him and judging his failure is about the worst thing we can do.  So, is it our business? From a fan's perspective, sure. But as judge, jury, and executioner, you can damn well be sure I won't be crucifying the kid if he fails like I've seen plenty of other people fail."
Browns,36bk2f,Shockworth,4,Mon May 18 13:08:48 2015 UTC,Upvote for being rational! Very nice post. It's important to realize that these players are just people. They don't really owe us anything as fans. Sometimes they will be great and sometimes they will be horrible. Like all people.
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-14,Tue May 19 02:51:14 2015 UTC,"No one is saying anything about crucifying the kid.  But everything you just said only furthers the point that its easy to slip back into that type of lifestyle, and you have to be extremely skeptical of addicts and they deserve no benefit of the doubt.  And him failing on a personal level is different than on a professional level.  I only care about on a professional level.  Yes they effect each other.  If larry page goes to rehab for substance abuse you can bet your ass i'm going to worry about my google stock if I see him out at a bar with people drinking at night.    He got the benefit of the doubt last year, but he's lost that since he betrayed our trust.  He owes us nothing, but we are completely within our right to be skeptical and verbal about it if he's so brazenly unaware of what he did to all of us as fans."
Browns,36bk2f,droidworkerbee,6,Mon May 18 13:16:53 2015 UTC,"You're not talking about crucifying him here, I'll agree. Call it me preemptively bracing for the fall because it's what I've come to expect. In the reality where he doesn't make it, I'm cutting that argument out because it's not helpful to the addict, and to be honest it's not really healthy for the one doing the crucifying either."
Browns,36bk2f,blackedout,9,Mon May 18 13:27:34 2015 UTC,"Because he was with a team captain who happens to know what substance abuse is. People may not trust Johnny, but we all trust Joe. Because he was in a place that happens to serve alcohol, doesn't mean the kid was drinking. Again, Joe was there, it was Town Hall... An establishment who's main draw (at least for me) is a sandwich. Point being, I don't care because this isn't a story."
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-18,Mon May 18 12:28:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, you mean that same team captain who was with Gordon who was literally not allowed to drink alcohol and that same team captain didn't even question it when Gordon did?  We literally just watched this exact same scenario play out over the course of 3 years with Gordon.  And I had to listen to these same excuses for him.  Forgive me if I don't just bowl over backwards taking the benefit of the doubt of an addict again.  And again. and again.  And I honestly don't understand how anyone could, and how we should be ""oh its not our business if he's drinking"".  That's crazy."
Browns,36bk2f,TapedeckNinja,8,Mon May 18 12:33:56 2015 UTC,"No one on the team was aware that Gordon wasn't allowed to drink.  That's not really relevant to this ""story.""  Besides that, have you ever been to TownHall?  It's not a bar.  It's a vegan-friendly restaurant."
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-16,Mon May 18 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Well, thats funny, because I am someone who's never even met the dude, and I knew he wasn't supposed to drink, or even that it would be a good idea.    And to your second point, all I was saying is we have a right to be concerned if we want to.  These people are saying ""its a non issue he can do what he wants!"" .  I'm saying he's allowed to do what he wants, but we are also allowed to be skeptical of him when he chooses to put himself in situations that are sketchy.  I've been to Townhall yes.  I wouldn't be going to any building with a bar in it, if my public persona, and my personal demons had a big alcohol issue.  When I quit smoking years ago, I didn't rush back to the smoking benches where all my friends were, because I knew it was hard, and it was not going to help.  And if my friends saw me there, they would have every right to question me.  And as our QB, who already proved he can't be a QB that way, while watching Jameis practice from 6am-8pm everyday, it just is one more thing to roll our eyes at."
Browns,36bk2f,blackedout,10,Mon May 18 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"Proof of him drinking, and I think everyone in here (myself included) drops him like a bad habit, so I'm with you there. At the moment, he went to a sandwich joint with Joe at 8:45PM... There's not a thing in the world we can do, no proof of him drinking, and the organization will handle him if there was.   Point being, this is a non-issue, Roomba."
Browns,36bk2f,Daviroth,5,Mon May 18 12:54:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, you mean that same team captain who was with Gordon who was literally not allowed to drink alcohol and that same team captain didn't even question it when Gordon did?   You are completely grounded in fantasy land. Haden has specifically said Gordon didn't tell them about that so he had no idea Gordon wasn't allowed to drink alcohol.   Also, no one said he was drinking. They said they saw him at Town Hall."
Browns,36bk2f,BurningBeard24,4,Mon May 18 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"Dude after seeing your comments in just about every thread for the last few months it seems like /r/browns is a trigger for you,  I would politely recommend you stay away and seek some kind of PTSD counseling"
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-16,Mon May 18 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"I can assure you, without a shadow of a doubt, your opinion is not only wrong, but in poor taste.  Maybe people like you should try and be more accepting and helpful instead of trying to ostracize people.  You could be helping the community, but instead you seek to push people who don't conform to ""the right view"" away and make others also do the same.  I would politely recommend you stay away from /r/browns and go back to the default subs where this kind of attitude is more appropriate."
Browns,36bk2f,BrownCavsTribe,2,Mon May 18 15:53:50 2015 UTC,Maybe people like you should try and be more accepting and helpful instead of trying to ostracize people.    You should probably take some of your own advice here.  Your attitude towards Manziel is the exact opposite of accepting and helpful.
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-5,Mon May 18 22:22:07 2015 UTC,What is wrong with my attitude? Don't trust an addict? Wait to give him accolades until he actually does something? Not praise a guy who literally stole money from you last year?  What's wrong with that?
Browns,36bk2f,BrownCavsTribe,5,Mon May 18 22:42:36 2015 UTC,"He did not ""literally"" steal money from you or anyone else."
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-2,Tue May 19 01:53:17 2015 UTC,He literally took money and slacked off worse than any player since Jamarcus Russell did.  I don't know what else you'd consider stealing if that isn't.
Browns,36bk2f,BrownCavsTribe,2,Tue May 19 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"He didn't ""take"" anything. A contract was signed between two consenting parties. He earned every penny regardless of whether or not you're satisfied with his on the field productivity and personality."
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-6,Tue May 19 02:00:08 2015 UTC,I think you don't understand what earned means.
Browns,36bk2f,brownsallday,5,Tue May 19 02:26:04 2015 UTC,These kinds of posts need to go away.  You just made up an opinion on something you know absolutely nothing about.  This is TMZ dog shit.
Browns,36bk2f,Daviroth,3,Mon May 18 03:56:38 2015 UTC,I don't know why you got downvoted. It is horseshit.
Browns,36bk2f,Whizard72,4,Mon May 18 06:42:39 2015 UTC,Some people have already written Manziel off and that's understandable. I've often heard about Manziel's competitiveness and how he carries a chip on his shoulder. What we saw out of him last year belies nothing I ever heard about him. Let us hope and pray that the Manziel we see this year is the Manziel we thought we drafted.
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-6,Mon May 18 09:23:26 2015 UTC,"Its the off season.  For every horseshit article ""DAE Manziel stayed 2 hours lolz works hard"" there is one of these.  You gonna complain about those too?  I don't see you doing that, and they're just as horseshit as this."
Browns,36bk2f,Daviroth,8,Mon May 18 11:45:49 2015 UTC,"Him staying 2 hours longer is relevant to football. How he spends his personal time, and automatically assuming he was getting hammered, is bullshit. One of the tweets literally said (paraphrased) ""good to see rehab worked out for him"". That is a bullshit fucking statement."
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-9,Mon May 18 15:03:52 2015 UTC,"How can even you believe that after last year? He was the worst qb in football because his off the field issues, which is entirely relevant.  How can you believe otherwise?"
Browns,36bk2f,Daviroth,4,Mon May 18 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"What is relevant is him being at the bar. However, automatically assuming that since he is at a bar he is getting shitfaced and thus rehab was all a joke is what is bullshit. Yeah he was at a bar, with Haden, big fucking whoop. If he controls himself it doesn't fucking matter, it's the assumption that it is already over by people because he was spotted at a single bar that is fucking bullshit."
Browns,36bk2f,djroomba322,-8,Mon May 18 15:29:44 2015 UTC,"Did anyone make that assumption?  No.  The only one who did actually, was you, since you were so defensive about it.   yeah he was at a bar, with Haden, big fucking whoop.  I honestly don't even know how you can live with this kind reasoning for a guy who has substance abuse issues.  Pretty much rehab 101 is don't go to bars.   How many bars does he need to be spotted at for it to be suspect to you?  What in the world could he do before you actually went, ""Oh, that's probably not a good thing""?  If he literally stabbed your mom in the neck you'd say ""Oh, well, he only stabbed one person, its not a pattern or anything, its fucking bullshit we have to keep hearing about it, he's not a murderer or anything""."
Browns,36bk2f,Daviroth,9,Mon May 18 15:43:48 2015 UTC,"Did anyone make that assumption? No   Lol, really dude? Well you are just flat out wrong on that one.  You are the one making this extreme as fuck. He went to one bar with his teammate, there is no report of him drinking at that bar or getting out of control at that bar. Based on that it is bullshit to assume rehab was a joke. As that tweet suggests.  You are fucking always hyperbolic as fuck man. Why even say that last statement? You are just trying to rile me up so you can fight with me more. Just stop."

If we went with that route you don't even want to know the kind of things they say about all of our players.  I'm not making anything extreme.  Where do you get that?  He went to ONE BAR AS A PERSON OUT OF REHAB FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE.  Hooooooooooooooly shit man. That's not cool.  You call me hyperbolic, but remember when I told you and told you and told you and told you and TOLD YOU Gordon was going to fuck up again, and what did he do?  And what did you tell me?  I accepted your apology if you remember.  Because of how completely and utterly wrong you were, and how correct I was.  I wans't trying to rile you up.  I was correct.  And you were wrong.   And all I'm saying now is that we have every right to question his decision making because he's shown in the past he's not very good at it."

I order a sprite and grenadine and a plate of nachos.  People in recovery can still go to bars. Being in recovery doesn't mean you run away and hide from alcohol. it means you own up to having a problem and decide to not do it anymore. SOME people need to stay away, SOME people can be around it just fine.   Maybe stop calling him a failure because he went to a bar. You don't know what he did there.

I dunno, we were playing XBox, and we asked me about this brand of nuts.""  So the guy looks at me all confused, and says, ""'Wow I've never heard of that. What did you say the name of the product is?""  And of course in a not so in-yo-face voice, but in a regular voice and straight face, I said, ""Deez Nuts. My friend told me I would like Deez Nuts?""  I'm white and he's black, so of course I put on a bit of ""stupid clueless white guy"" acting in it.  The guy froze for a cool 10 seconds, and then laughed his ass off."

Browns,3645y2,EmptySoapDispenser,10,Sat May 16 01:50:34 2015 UTC,Hard to argue with that gigantic sample size.
Browns,3645y2,ChairyCweed,-2,Sat May 16 01:58:29 2015 UTC,No he didn't. He had better stats but he has shown that he can't make the throws that a starter or even a backup has to make.
Browns,3645y2,h3rp3r,-2,Sat May 16 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"For short passes he was accurate, and without a deep threat most of the passes thrown this year are probably gonna be in that range. Despite having less time to prepare he made fewer mistakes than Manzel."
Browns,3645y2,ChairyCweed,2,Sat May 16 02:15:15 2015 UTC,If he can't throw deep they will just stack the box and stop the run. Shaw can't throw hard enough to throw his receivers open so we will be an extremely shitty version of the Chiefs. There is just no upside with starting Shaw in week one. McCown could do everything Shaw can do except run. He made fewer mistakes because he took fewer chances. They had Manziel making more difficult passes and had Shaw only throwing short for the most part.
Browns,3645y2,RedChocobo2,1 point,Sat May 16 02:37:19 2015 UTC,"Your assessment of shaw is wrong. Peyton can't throw hard but he throws his guys open. Shaw is very capable of earning the starting job. Will he, well probably not, but don't count him out"
Browns,3645y2,h3rp3r,-3,Sun May 17 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"We have no deep threat, they will stack the box no matter who is at QB. McCown is only there to be a veteran presence, I hope we are never in the situation where he is starting. Manzel took more chances because he makes poor decisions, give me the more stable QB anyday."
Browns,3645y2,ChairyCweed,0,Sat May 16 03:03:49 2015 UTC,"Not taking chances because your arm is too weak doesn't make you stable, it makes you a shitty quarterback. I just want them to cut him already so people can stop acting like he is anything better than a third stringer/ camp arm."
Browns,3645y2,h3rp3r,0,Sat May 16 12:33:46 2015 UTC,"Who are our other options at QB? Johnny ""I'm gonna run into this linebacker"" Manzel, Josh ""over the hill"" McCown, and Thad ""we already cut him once"" Lewis. Yeah, none of our QBs are 1st rate, so lets give reps to the QB that has shown that he has the accuracy to keep our offense on the field, even if he only throws 40 yards down field."
Browns,3645y2,ChairyCweed,-1,Sat May 16 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"All three are better than Shaw. He blows, dude. Almost any quarterback can make the throws he can, he is one of the worst quarterbacks on a roster. Connor ""we had him on the practice squad and nobody wanted him"" Shaw is fucking terrible."

Browns,3645y2,ChairyCweed,2,Sat May 16 06:12:03 2015 UTC,I have absolutely no idea why people are thinking Shaw can start. My guess would be that he won in college and they didn't watch him but I have no idea. You have to watch him for 5 plays to know he doesn't have the arm strength to start.
Browns,3645y2,Daviroth,1 point,Sat May 16 12:28:36 2015 UTC,without a deep threat   Are we ignoring one the the top yards/catch receivers from last year now? Is that what we are doing?

Browns,362c7k,24rubikscube,1 point,Fri May 15 16:58:49 2015 UTC,Ditto. Mine smelled like a tire and I was really disappointed with the color of orange and the drop shading. I'm never going to take a shot at AliExpress again.

Browns,362c7k,24rubikscube,3,Fri May 15 20:22:44 2015 UTC,I wouldn't buy the new jersey on there for a while. Eventually there'll be good ones. It'll take time.
Browns,362c7k,P-barnes8919,3,Fri May 15 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"That's what a lot of people (myself included) didn't consider when they ordered AliExpress jerseys within weeks of the new uniforms being revealed. These are brand new uniforms, the people making the knockoffs probably didn't even have their hands on the originals to make copies of when they started manufacturing these. They were just in a huge rush to get them out on the market. Give it a few months or even a year and I'm sure there will be a marked increase in quality."

Browns,35zgd4,DCMurphy,22,Fri May 15 19:45:15 2015 UTC,It's hilarious. r/nfl is just littered with pats fan denials.  Like the league has some hidden agenda against 1 team when they catch them cheating.

Browns,35zgd4,hlainelarkinmk2,16,Thu May 14 22:11:23 2015 UTC,Or they are just getting punished harder cause they have a history of cheating.
Browns,35zgd4,stangstang,1 point,Thu May 14 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"Eh, I doubt that.  If he is over-punishing for this particular offense it may very well be because (hypothetically) it's well known around league circles that the Patriots skirt the rules more often than most and now that they have some kind of case against them they're hammering them for it.  A lot of people are saying it's because of the black eye they got last year after the Ray Rice thing and other cases but jumping on the Pats to try to make up for that just shows inconsistency.  It really seems like they're going after Brady and the Pats for past offenses that they couldn't ever prove anything on."
Browns,35zgd4,miked1be,1 point,Fri May 15 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"If they skirt the rules, then more power to them. Every team should push the rules. If the league can't police their sport, then that's their problem."

Typically if you have a number in that range as a DB, you aren't making the team, and if you do, you're typically a bottom of the depth chart guy. I feel like it's similar to baseball players in spring training, the higher the number, the less likely they are going to make an opening day roster. I think I did see him match up with Leon Hall and Pacman, but you could tell that was a lot closer and a better matchup.   Not knocking, just making an observation."

Browns,360f46,JaZzyyJaZz,11,Fri May 15 01:12:51 2015 UTC,They kept labeling Erving as a guard. I like this set up for the O line. I feel Schwartz was more of a liability than Greco. I'm all for this.   Just reading through the projected starters got my football boner out of hibernation.   Is it August yet??????
Browns,360f46,bowhunter6274,7,Fri May 15 01:25:19 2015 UTC,PFf backs up your feeling about Schwartz (I think his grade was about 0). Greco graded out really well last year (like +16).
Browns,360f46,Campesinoslive,7,Fri May 15 03:58:14 2015 UTC,"Schwartz was still a top-15 OT, but he was the worst performer on our line for sure. Greco was the #8 OG I believe, and of course JT, Bitonio, and Mack are all pro caliber players."
Browns,360f46,Doyle524,0,Fri May 15 05:59:06 2015 UTC,"I don't like it, Erving is a C/G and tackle is one of the hardest positions to switch to in the NFL. If we made a move, I would see Bitonio going to RT and Erving going LG. Greco has the shortest arms on our line by about 3"", which is important as a tackle.   Either way we move people around to get Erving in, or if he sits this year, the line is going to be strong."

Browns,360f46,jg87iroc,2,Fri May 15 02:29:29 2015 UTC,"Johnny isn't ready, has a lot to prove, and we need someone competent enough to consistently start in this division. Either way, Johnny proves this year whether or not he is the long-term answer at QB. Yes, JFF has a shot but he has to simultaneously prove he's capable of avoiding distractions and give Browns leadership proof he can start in this league. McCown starts and JFF comes if (when?) we are eliminated from playoff contention. At that point Johnny fights for his future in a Browns uniform.  Hope JFF pans out but if not there's a QB in on a college practice field getting ready to lead this team at some point."

Browns,35y8l0,bearsdriving,20,Thu May 14 15:06:12 2015 UTC,I would hate for them to have that constant distraction.   from what i've heard is that the cameras are  less intrusive than say the local or national media. and the interviews would just be one more of the many they already would have to do in a day
Browns,35y8l0,hatmantc,7,Thu May 14 15:12:27 2015 UTC,"There cameras are way less intrusive that the local media. But that's not saying much, the local media can be dicks.   These are the points I have been saying all along. There is already time reserved for media availability, so while the rest of the team is talking to local media, they are taken to talks to NFL Films."

Browns,35y8l0,DocMichaels,2,Thu May 14 16:31:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only season I watched was the cincy one. It's actually really good. I'd love to see the Browns on hard knocks. (or as my wife put it; ""what's that football show? 'tough times'?"") between our schedule and our qb situation, I don't have real high expectations for this season. So I'm rooting for the browns to be picked."
Browns,35y8l0,Helagak,-7,Fri May 15 11:15:06 2015 UTC,Distraction? Who cares? Not like we're going to win anything anyway.
Browns,35y8l0,SuperPoop,2,Thu May 14 22:12:15 2015 UTC,Not with that attitude Mr. Debbie Downer!
Browns,35y8l0,AKlep,0,Fri May 15 12:52:23 2015 UTC,Haha. I guess I just can't go into a season optimistically anymore. We went 7-9 last year with one of the easiest schedules. I'm not buying any hype anymore. We're a 4-5 win team unless they prove me wrong.
Browns,35y8l0,SuperPoop,29,Fri May 15 14:07:22 2015 UTC,I think it's a good idea. People would see Pettine and the organization for what it is and not all of this lolbrowns bull shit media has created. So our solution to the media is the media? I guess.
Browns,35y8l0,average_white_male,9,Thu May 14 15:11:23 2015 UTC,"Right, NFL Films has always seemed to do a great job of bringing the behind the scenes of the NFL to viewers without pushing a narrative.  There's a reason they're so respected by everyone in the league, players and coaches included.  I don't really think this would be as bad as everyone thinks it would be."
Browns,35y8l0,miked1be,3,Thu May 14 16:43:50 2015 UTC,I really think it all depends on their trust in JFF right now. If he was the train wreck he was last year this is a horrid idea but if this little turn around is true and we see a locker room behind him I think it could be awesome for the organization and fans.
Browns,35y8l0,average_white_male,1 point,Thu May 14 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"Right, I don't think it would be bad as far as added pressure goes but it could be bad if it somehow ends up showing that he's regressed or not improved at all."
Browns,35y8l0,miked1be,1 point,Thu May 14 16:56:19 2015 UTC,So our solution to the media is the media? I guess.   non-twitter driven media

Browns,35y8l0,ohennwen,8,Thu May 14 15:16:19 2015 UTC,"I think we should do it. It would be a great way to keep Johnny honest. Knowing the cameras will show all he might be forced to be professional. If he already is taking the right steps then great, the cameras will show everyone the new John Football"
Browns,35y8l0,Jhonopolis,2,Thu May 14 15:26:39 2015 UTC,I really hope Manziel matured. If not for anything else just so we can call him John Football.

Browns,35y8l0,miked1be,2,Thu May 14 18:09:16 2015 UTC,"You're drawing a strange line in the sand, it's a nickname."
Browns,35y8l0,ohmk,2,Thu May 14 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"I've gone back and forth on this in my head since they started talking about it. At first I thought it would be a bad idea and only cause distractions, but truthfully I would love to be able to watch in depth Browns coverage."
Browns,35y8l0,Future_Timer,5,Thu May 14 15:09:01 2015 UTC,"Not exactly sure how I feel about it.  But on the positive side, Pettine has had past experience with being on Hard Knocks before with the Jets.  So he'll be able to handle it and manage the team with it well I would think."
Browns,35y8l0,themitey1,2,Thu May 14 15:40:26 2015 UTC,"Do it, Browns. It might be good for Johnny to look America in the eye and admit that he had a coke(?) problem. This would be a fantastic 'recovery' story if the wins happen. The great Johnny Football's rise from addiction to Superbowl."

Browns,35y8l0,eleven21,2,Thu May 14 21:40:34 2015 UTC,The only parts I have trouble watching is video of players being cut.  Maybe I'm just a big ol softy or something but I hate that.
Browns,35y8l0,miked1be,2,Fri May 15 14:35:46 2015 UTC,I thought teams we're free to decline if they did not want to participate?
Browns,35y8l0,enigmaticevil,10,Thu May 14 15:01:51 2015 UTC,Teams with rookie head coaches or have made the playoffs in either of the past 2 seasons can decline.  Anyone else can be forced to do it by the NFL.  The Browns have asked to be left out of it but that doesn't mean the league has to comply.
Browns,35y8l0,miked1be,3,Thu May 14 15:06:30 2015 UTC,"Any team can decline (Browns have this year), but the league/HBO can force a team too anyway.   I heard the Falcons are open to it, but with Johnny in a make or break year I don't think HBO wants to miss that cash cow. I mean if Johnny plays bad even while clean living, he won't be a draw like he is right now."
Browns,35y8l0,bearsdriving,6,Thu May 14 15:09:02 2015 UTC,I can promise you that the Falcons aren't thinking of doing it because they just did it last season

Browns,35y8l0,rdpcatfan,1 point,Thu May 14 17:28:38 2015 UTC,It could be great/terrible PR for those who have been sitting on the fence w/ Johnny. It would make for an intriguing narrative.
Browns,35y8l0,enigmaticevil,2,Thu May 14 15:15:22 2015 UTC,They are; but that doesn't mean Hard Knocks doesn't want to see them still.
Browns,35y8l0,enigmaticevil,2,Thu May 14 15:02:23 2015 UTC,Just clarifying. I'd love to see our Browns on Hard Knocks
Browns,35y8l0,hatmantc,2,Thu May 14 15:14:23 2015 UTC,We don't need any more distractions. What our team needs is consistency
Browns,35y8l0,hatmantc,0,Thu May 14 16:24:08 2015 UTC,How would this be a distraction? There's cameras all over these practices already..They already have to do press interviews afterwards..So where's the distraction
Browns,35y8l0,twoquarters,0,Thu May 14 16:33:34 2015 UTC,It may distract Manziel while he is settling into the regime.
Browns,35y8l0,seamonkeydoo2,2,Thu May 14 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"No more than being filmed by action19 news, being interviewed by espn or say 92.3 the fan. He'll be filmed throughout the entire thing regardless"

Browns,360t0j,24rubikscube,1 point,Fri May 15 23:49:26 2015 UTC,Disagree. Faith doesn't get you the starting job on this team. McCown's experience is poor but it's more and better than Manziel's.
Browns,360t0j,droidworkerbee,28,Sat May 16 00:01:33 2015 UTC,That's the first I've heard of this out of Pettine.  One unnamed source in a Yahoo article doesn't scream reliable to me.

An unnamed source + in an article not about the subject + burried halfway down an article + no evidence for it = sketchy journalism"
Browns,360t0j,bearsdriving,7,Fri May 15 17:57:07 2015 UTC,I'm guessing he had no choice but to consider moving on. If the guy goes into rehab indefinitely than you have to plan accordingly.
Browns,360t0j,justindci,10,Fri May 15 11:07:58 2015 UTC,"This sounds like bogus off season fluff for page views. McCown was brought in to mentor, set an example and be a back up. Hoyer wanted to be the #1 guy and wasn't trying to just be a back up. McCown is hear to be a leader in the locker room and play some stop gap games if Manziel goes down or till he becomes the starter, similar to Byron Leftwich in Shittsburgh."
Browns,360t0j,Spartan_55,2,Fri May 15 04:44:44 2015 UTC,"It's a moo point now and would have been a meaningless discussion now matter how it played out.  They weren't going to cut Manziel regardless; and they didn't withhold from drafting a QB because of their faith in Manziel. He was going to be on the roster, and barring a drug or domestic violence incident, was almost certainly going to be the backup QB. All of that was true before he went to rehab and is still true now. The only possible difference rehab made is that it may have moved him from the presumptive third-stringer to the presumptive backup going into camp."

Browns,35ygga,moodyfloyd,10,Thu May 14 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"Kiley needs to go, like bought out of his contract needs to go now.  He was advocating the Cavs doing whatever it takes to win a championship AKA taking Rose out in a similar fashion to Love this mornin, morality be damned, and then taking calls from all of Cleveland's psychopaths saying ""anything for a championship, anyone who doesn't think that is soft"". He probably doesn't even fucking believe that's the way to go, he just wants us as fans to get more mud in our face if it gets picked up nationally.  He misrepresents the city and he isn't even from here. Carman had the sensibility to say ""I can't go there"" and then was subsequently called out as soft by JG the producer, who probably comes up with these stupid prompts to begin with.  I don't like Mike and Mike, and I'm tuning into the fan now because Carman is on in the morning but jesus, can we just get a fucking radio show where I can turn it on and perhaps hear something about what happened the day before in CLE sports without some insane spin.  For fuck's sake, Kluber tied Bob Feller's record for strike outs in a game and I didn't hear a single blurb about it during my time getting ready this morning + commute."
Browns,35ygga,randalflagg,2,Thu May 14 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"Mike and Mike is 53 minutes of commercial an hour with some very uninteresting generic sports takes in between.  Kiley and Booms was listening to two idiots argue every morning about games they barely paid attention to and cut off anyone with an intelligent opinion (that does not mean I think all or even most callers are intelligent).  Their game shows were wholly uninteresting and the idiot pop quiz was just dumb.    Not to mention the show was filled with ""I'm not racist, I have (insert) friends."" or ""I'm not racist but..."".  It was infuriating."
Browns,35ygga,Resident_Wizard,6,Fri May 15 00:08:11 2015 UTC,"I would've rather seen Kiley get the axe than Booms, and that's saying a lot considering that for me, Booms is somewhere between a cockroach and that white stuff that accumulates at the corner of your mouth when you're really thirsty."

Whether it was or wasn't is not the point, but the fact that Kiley was acting like a child every time a point was made against him just shows such terrible reporting... or professionalism for that matter"

Browns,35z77o,TapedeckNinja,3,Fri May 15 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"If both our O & D-Lines come together I see us going 9-7 regardless of who is under center. Those guys coming together will maximize the strengths we already have.  Love the talent we have at RB. All 3 of them have what it takes this year to move the chains and keep JFF or McCown looking good on 3rd and short situations. Not to mention Bowe, Hartline, and Hawkins will be money on the short throws. This year will be all about minimizing the QB on offense.   And on defense, guys just gotta find their role. Another year with Pettine should maximize that. They said it last year, but this is a career defining year for Mingo, he's gotta play well. I'd love to see a Pierre Desir or a Kirksey make a name for themselves in year 2. The rookies are rookies. If they come in and play even above average, I'd take that as a win.  If everything clicks, should be and exciting season to watch. GO BROWNS!!"
Browns,35z77o,TucanJamz,3,Thu May 14 23:10:10 2015 UTC,"Floor: 8-8 (without injuries or other bullshit). Ceiling: 13-3  Prediction: 10-6  Our schedule is way easier than it looks if you look deeper into the teams. SF, OAK, SD, STL, NYJ, and TEN should be easy wins. They are looking to be bottom of the barrel for the most part, and if not, we match up well with them. PIT is going downhill. CIN is stagnant from last year. BAL looks strong, but weaker than last year. And we can definitely beat one or two of ARI, KC, SEA, and DEN.   As long as the run game and defense return to early 2014 form (which they should, we have done nothing but add talent at both), we can be very scary, and with a competent QB and WRs who can take advantage of that like Hoyer did early last year, we're looking at playoff and division contention."
Browns,35z77o,Doyle524,2,Fri May 15 05:41:43 2015 UTC,No way are SD and STL easy wins
Browns,35z77o,Official_Wingman,5,Fri May 15 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"Floor: 4-12 Ceiling: 10-6  I think we see a small dip to 6-10 this year.  Wins: TEN, OAK, CIN (home), BAL (home), SF, DEN.  2016 will be our breakout year IMO. Either Johnny will have developed or we will have moved on from him."
Browns,35z77o,youwithme,5,Thu May 14 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"Until the QB situation is clarified, I can't do any better than 8-8. It's still way too early to tell."
Browns,35z77o,n813,3,Thu May 14 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"Floor: 4-12.   Ceiling: 12-4.   My Guess: 9-7.   Bold Prediction: We come out big, and win @Seattle week 15.   I think West or Crow, whoever emerges as the clear #1, gets 1000+ yards. Whoever is the #2 gets 750+ yards. I'm leaning towards West, but I'm biased cause I saw the guy play at college. Either of them are capable #1's."
Browns,35z77o,Troop-the-Loop,3,Thu May 14 21:05:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with your floor/ceiling. I'd be happy if we can get the run game going really well because at this point, the QB situation is still very shaky. I think with the O-line being healthy and now even more improved with Cam Erving, the already impressive run game we have can develop further. Hopefully Crow and West will step up, because I'm not so sure Johnny can cut it."
Browns,35z77o,JimasaurusRex,3,Thu May 14 23:05:33 2015 UTC,"I really believe our run game will be insane this year. If Mack stays healthy, and Erving finds his sweet-stop this off-season, we could arguably have one of the best O-Lines in the league. West and Crow showed a lot of skill last season, and they both seem committed to getting better. It sounds like there's some healthy competition between them.   As long as our QB doesn't turn the ball over, I think our run game and defense can do more than enough to win. Admittedly, not turning the ball over could be a challenge."
Browns,35z77o,Troop-the-Loop,2,Thu May 14 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The turnovers worry me the most. The QB, whoever it is, needs to make smart passes. If he gets too overconfident and throws a pick a game we'll have a rough time."
Browns,35z77o,JimasaurusRex,2,Thu May 14 23:48:34 2015 UTC,Unless we have a Quarter back that plays well and mistake free whoever that may be we won't win more than 7 games.
Browns,35z77o,chris101010,-1,Thu May 14 23:36:46 2015 UTC,"I sit in wide eyed wonder reading these comments.  It boggles my mind that people look at this roster and see anything more than 6 wins.  With this schedule, and our problems at QB and complete lack of any offensive weapons at WR or TE in a passing league, I have no idea where the offense is coming from.  I hope I'm wrong but this has all the making of another 3 QB season finish, being a 1 dimensional team that teams stack the box and shut down."
Browns,35z77o,djroomba322,5,Fri May 15 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"The offense comes from the same place it did the first 6 weeks of 2014. We establish the run, and use that to set up the play action and passing game.   Points will also come from the defense. Mark my words on both of these."
Browns,35z77o,Doyle524,-1,Fri May 15 05:44:53 2015 UTC,"Our #1 receiver scored 0 TDS last year, our #2 scored 2, and our #3 scored 2, and our #1 TE scored 0.  One dimensional offenses don't work in the NFL, and if you depend on points off the defense you're already screwed.  Because our QB position no longer runs a great play action and is more prone to turnovers.  Esp if its Manziel."
Browns,35z77o,djroomba322,2,Fri May 15 11:02:32 2015 UTC,"KC and MIA just simply didn't throw the ball downfield to their receivers. The stats are therefore quite misleading.   I didn't say we'd be relying on points from the D, just that we'll be getting some.   And if our run game works like it did early last year, you could fake the run while holding the ball over your head and still run an effective play action. (Yes, this is a slight exaggeration, but I'm sure you see the point I'm making.)  Our offense won't be one dimensional. Thing is, it doesn't build off of the skill positions; it builds off of the line. Which is a good thing, since we have a first ballot HOFer, two all-pros, and two other players that were in the top 10 and top 15 for their respective positions last year, plus a first round rookie. They'll create running lanes, which will lessen pressure on the QB by making it easier to get yards on the ground, and they'll literally take pressure off of the QB in a pass rush sense, giving him more time to throw. Give a bad QB time in the pocket, and more often than not, he becomes a decent QB. That's what happened with Hoyer (not implying that he was bad, just that the line made him look much better than he was) for the first half of last year. When the run game started getting shut down, and he no longer had a week to throw the ball every play, he made mistakes, and generally became less consistent."
Browns,35z77o,Doyle524,0,Fri May 15 18:39:13 2015 UTC,"KC and MIA just simply didn't throw the ball downfield to their receivers. The stats are therefore quite misleading.   Well, for one, our offense (if Oakland is any indication) won't be throwing the ball down to receivers.  And Smith is 10 times the QB McCown is.  MIA did throw the ball down the field, just hartline coming off PCL surgery had lost a step and isn't a downfield threat anymore.   Our offense won't be one dimensional. Thing is, it doesn't build off of the skill positions; it builds off of the line.    Thats just a bunch of words that mean literally nothing.  We have 5 linemen, and a tight end and a fullback maybe.  They are going to have 8 in the box, and will only need to leave a saftey and can play man on the outside because our receivers aren't a threat.  This is literally the definition of a one dimensional offense.   When the run game started getting shut down, and he no longer had a week to throw the ball every play, he made mistakes, and generally became less consistent.   No......... Our receivers who are notoriously poor route runners and are undersized, were unable to create any separation from average DBs.  And that is what happened late in the season.  Hoyer is 10 times the QB McCown has been, considering he won more games than McCown has in what, 10 years?    When the run game started getting shut down, and he no longer had a week to throw the ball every play, he made mistakes, and generally became less consistent.   When you say things like this, it invalidates your entire argument.  Because that means you obviously have never seen a single snap of McCown or don't have any idea what you're going to expect from a rookie spread offense guy who's played 1 NFL game."
Browns,35z77o,djroomba322,3,Fri May 15 18:44:55 2015 UTC,Remember how we were playing until Mack got hurt? That's how. McCown is either a lateral move or an upgrade over Hoyer and we should be able to run downhill again and set up easy pass plays. The defense will keep us in games and we will need to scratch out some touchdowns.
Browns,35z77o,TSR3K,0,Fri May 15 13:38:41 2015 UTC,care to explain how a player who does stuff like this is a lateral move?  Go ahead and link me anything Hoyer ever did that stupid.  Tampa loses that game by under a touchdown btw.  You want to know how they went 1-10 under Josh?  That's how.  McCown is more equal to Weeden than Hoyer.   Remember how we were playing until Mack got hurt?    Except Josh McCown isnt good at playaction and Hoyer was great.  And Hoyer was capable of vertical passing and not making mistakes.   The defense will keep us in games and we will need to scratch out some touchdowns.   That's all well and good until we have rookie QB whos constantly turning the ball over or older Weeden 2.0
Browns,35z77o,djroomba322,2,Fri May 15 14:08:49 2015 UTC,"QB  QB  QB   Our offense starts with the line, not the QB. We establish the run game and give the QB time to throw, and I could ""lead"" the Browns to 8 wins."
Browns,35z77o,Doyle524,1 point,Fri May 15 18:41:31 2015 UTC,"Except Josh McCown isnt good at playaction   What makes you say that?  Tampa Bay wasn't good at running play action in 2014 because they had arguably the worst rushing offense in the league (31st by DVOA, fourth-worst in total yards at 1,375, second-fewest attempts at 353--Cleveland ran the ball 477 times last year).  The Bucs didn't even try to run play action because it didn't work at all.  If you go back and watch the tape, no one was biting on it; defenses weren't stacking the box against the run at all and their coverage didn't change from running downs to passing downs.  McCown was fine at running the play action before his stint in Tampa Bay.  In Chicago, 21% of his dropbacks were play action and he had a 107.6 rating on those plays."
Browns,35z77o,TapedeckNinja,1 point,Fri May 15 19:22:32 2015 UTC,"As someone who had to watch him play with the bears, with competent running backs, he was terrible at executing pay action.  Tampa is a prefect example though. Put a shit qb and rush 9 every time you can sell out to stop the run and make the qb beat you.  Obviously even with two fantastic weapons he couldn't.  It was magnified because they weren't great, but we'll see a very similar effect here.  But mechanically he is bad at selling the fake and getting back to a proper throwing platform. Hoyer was always awesome at this."
Browns,35z77o,djroomba322,1 point,Fri May 15 19:59:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I forgot the main point.  The entire point of play action is to force the lbers and fs and ss to freeze and make them move forward instead of into throwing lanes.  They are going to keep 8 in the box pretty much every play until josh mccown can connect with bowe consistently.  So if you think that in the face of constant 7,8,9 man fronts we're going to win those run match ups, then we're at a stopping point here.  Cause I don't see how mccown to bowe works or how we go 80+ yards against those kind of fronts in the AFCN"

I painted my summer set of wheels with actual wheel paint a couple years ago and it was a pain in the ass to sand it so many times. I used cans for that and had some inconsistencies once the cans started to get emptier. The sprayer video looks like it would save a ton of time and make for better results.  Also, did you tape things off or just peel off the overspray?  And finally, did you mess with spraying places like under the hood, inside trunk lid and door jambs? I haven't seen pictures of people doing that."

Browns,35r5tq,JohnnyFire,25,Tue May 12 20:50:59 2015 UTC,"I'm only posting this because the idea of everyone hopping on the McCown train is absolutely mind boggling.  This isn't about liking Manziel or not. This isn't about if Manziel can succeed in the NFL or not. This is about the national media as a whole taking an inch (""For now, McCown is the starter"") and making it a mile (""MCCOWN IS STARTING THE BROWNS ARE FUCKED""). We know McCown sucks. The Browns, I'd assume, do not want to end up in a situation where McCown is actually starting, and are praying that Manziel does show something, anything to force his way into the starting job.  McCown is a career backup. He's also not going to bitch if he is the backup. It's a way better logistical situation for him, but everyone has take the ""McCown is starter heading into camp"" line from Pettine that Manziel will never start. No. He can earn it. If you think he can or not, he can, and as Ken Carman even says, ""If Manziel does pan out, it's the only way you wipe this all away"". McCown playing helps us in no way and just leaves assured uncertainty, while Manziel playing bears a risk of some sucking but at least clears up the situation as to what the Browns need to do moving forward."
Browns,35r5tq,dring_round,8,Tue May 12 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"Good post, I just basically posted the same thoughts a couple days ago. Playing McCown does nothing for you, at least if Johnny tanks then you know he's garbage and you can move on by drafting someone else.   Joe and Joe won't be around forever."
Browns,35r5tq,sba_17,2,Tue May 12 22:41:10 2015 UTC,"This is a great reflection on it, you stated my thoughts in a way that I couldn't articulate"
Browns,35r5tq,Doyle524,2,Tue May 12 22:45:35 2015 UTC,"We know McCown sucks.   I wouldn't go that far. 2013-form McCown could play at Hoyer type levels this year, especially considering that our line and running game should take a lot of the pressure to succeed off of his (or Johnny's) shoulders, just like they did last year for BH."
Browns,35r5tq,miked1be,2,Wed May 13 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Hoyer kind of sucked too.  I don't believe McCown was as bad as people think,  even Bucs fans somehow seem to forget their own team completely lacked an OC (he literally was not there) and effective offensive line.  Funny how they conveniently ignore that so much.  Thing is,  neither is a real NFL starter."

If that was true, you're basically saying Farmer is not good at his job for signing a player that doesn't help us, when there are other players who can help us."
Browns,35r5tq,Future_Timer,3,Wed May 13 11:36:05 2015 UTC,You wonder why people don't like when you comment on things. You have to be such a dick about it all the time. Make an argument without being condescending and aggressive and people might engage you in a way that's not always so defensive.
Browns,35r5tq,djroomba322,-2,Wed May 13 13:38:14 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with my comment.  He just wrote a 4 page paragraph detailing why Manziel starting shows us something, and McCown starting doesn't.  I just wanted to verbalize for posterity, when McCown comes back and starts these people who twist words will have to actually stick to their opinion once.  What about my comment is aggressive? How am I being a dick?  What about it is condescending?  Josh McCown is a very poor football player in his youth, and he's now approaching middle age.   I'm not defensive. I am now both aggressive AND defensive?   All I'm saying is OPs logic is totally sound, but when McCown ends up starting, it will be obvious that they're not in it to win it this year as there were better options and as op said, it doesn't help us."
Browns,35r5tq,djroomba322,5,Wed May 13 13:44:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not defensive. I am now both aggressive AND defensive?   I promise, I do not want to create a fight here, but you do realize one of the signs of someone being defensive, as most psychologists would argue, is taking a stance to argue against your own defensiveness?"
Browns,35r5tq,djroomba322,2,Wed May 13 14:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'll bite on this one, fine. Allow me to rephrase.  McCown starting doesn't help us. I know, I know, there's an argument to be made paying someone a large sum to be a backup, but you know what, having a backup is important when you're working with a volatile situation. And when McCown has been placed in situations where he is called upon as the backup, he's done okay.  But all too truthfully, he's not a 16 game starter. That much is obvious. McCown was signed with the intention to be a back-up, because of his age and because:  A. Other options were more expensive  B. Other options would've wanted to start immediately due to age or older contracts  C. Other options would make more noise when they didn't start. Not saying that we need to be complacent on Manziel starting, but if he does earn the right start we certainly don't want a media magnet behind him amplifying the fact that someone else wants a piece.  So yeah, if he's starting, it's not fulfilling his purpose and value to this team more than likely. But of course there's an argument to be made that Manziel will never be a pro, and Farmer needed to go out and get a top notch QB in the draft or free agency: I'd contest that when the field in FA is weak, the draft class is on the weak side, and the available other options (trading for Foles or Bradford) could be expensive stop gaps at the very worst, making a splash move isn't possible.  The McCown signing is meant to be one thing: get someone with even nominal experience on the team who will not cause a ruckus and allow the team one more season to evaluate Manziel as a potential starter. Not because it is the best option, or even the ideal option, but because it's the option that is the safest and most logical."
Browns,35r5tq,djroomba322,-5,Wed May 13 12:18:53 2015 UTC,"So then, to your point:  If McCown is starting, at any point, we can take it as a sign of we're screwed right?   Other options would make more noise when they didn't start   Don't buy this for one second, don't even know what you mean by this.  Cassell wouldn't make noise. 10 game winner with 2 teams.  Cheap.  Hoyer didn't even make noise with this team last year.  The only person that caused any noise was Manziel.     Other options were more expensive   Hoyer wanted less than what McCown got.    You know Cassell is getting paid 2.5 mil less than McCown right?"
Browns,35r5tq,KegmanZulu,4,Wed May 13 12:32:54 2015 UTC,"See, here's the issue I think you're making: you're saying that Matt Cassell is still capable of being a 10-game winner in the NFL. He's 32 and has had four straight seasons of poor play, and if memory serves was either beaten out or nearly edged out by Christian fucking Ponder. Brian Hoyer has also had his time in the shade, but has already suffered two injuries in two seasons and clearly wanted out after all the fuss last year; I'm not saying it's fair, but there was no way he was coming back.  I understand that you don't like our QB options, but you can't go grasping straws saying someone was out there that could be a franchise (or even hold-over) QB when you can see the writing on the wall: there was no good option. McCown is going to suck if he has to play, much like Matt Cassell (who, by the way, is becoming a running joke amongst much of the NFL, believe it or else) would and like Hoyer may be if, in Houston he ends up backing up for Mallett as one expects he will.  A backup is a backup. You don't want the backup to play anyway, so what are we even arguing about? That there were better options to be a back-up? Okay, fine, but that shouldn't matter in a season where (I'd say more than likely) Manziel is going to start and get evaluated. Unless you really think that going and getting a Matt Moore or a Mark Sanchez to potentially ride the bench behind Manziel would be a better idea.  And the cost, by the way, is relative to the cap, of which we had a lot. So who cares? In the grand scheme of things, McCown is still being paid backup money. If the argument is ""Well, why not use that money for other players"", okay, fine, but they're pretty much making clear they want to load up on draft picks for 2016 with compensatory selections and keep the cap available for...okay, that much I really don't know what for, but the point still stands, we see what they're trying to do here.  I want to win too, I really do, but I don't think Hoyer, or Cassell, or anyone else we could get (realistically, anyway) in 2015 was going to give us a better chance or put us in a better long-term situation than to see if Manziel couldn't dig out of his own hole. What's good on this team and what's bad on this team is still what it is regardless of who's playing backup and, if this is what you're advocating, who would have replaced him."
Browns,35r5tq,djroomba322,-1,Wed May 13 14:02:18 2015 UTC,"He's 32 and has had four straight seasons of poor play, and if memory serves was either beaten out or nearly edged out by Christian fucking Ponder. Brian Hoyer has also had his time in the shade, but has already suffered two injuries in two seasons and clearly wanted out after all the fuss last year; I'm not saying it's fair, but there was no way he was coming back.   And every single statistic you can argue against him, McCown has a ten fold worst statistic in the same category.     backup is a backup. You don't want the backup to play anyway, so what are we even arguing about?    He's not going to be a backup.   n the grand scheme of things, McCown is still being paid backup money.   he got more than backup money.   And the cost, by the way, is relative to the cap, of which we had a lot.   We have a lot of cap space to get good players, not overpay for terrible ones.   I want to win too, I really do, but I don't think Hoyer, or Cassell, or anyone else we could get (realistically, anyway) in 2015   Hoyer literally won 7 games last year.  With this team.  Coming off of ACL surgery.    Unless you really think that going and getting a Matt Moore or a Mark Sanchez to potentially ride the bench behind Manziel would be a better idea.   I listed my QBs already that could give us a legitimate chance to succeed.  And as you said, McCown is worthless.  Why didn't we bring in a late round guy or some talent to try and build up?  We're literally going to have to completely start over at QB and WR with nothing coming up the pipe."
Browns,35r5tq,brownsallday,2,Wed May 13 14:11:06 2015 UTC,"I'm going to stop a moment and point out that this is why people believe you're being a pain on these forums; because you're coming off as severely confrontational and not really attempting to add anything to the conversation; it's clear no matter what I point out or say, that's not going to budge you on your thoughts about McCown, or at least that's what it appears from your tone.  But to your point:   And as you said, McCown is worthless. Why didn't we bring in a late round guy or some talent to try and build up? We're literally going to have to completely start over at QB and WR with nothing coming up the pipe.   The WR argument is completely different so I won't go there, but at this point, we know why and how; again, what late-round QB was there that could actually be built up? Brett Hundley? He fell so far he became a backup for a team that already has a franchise QB. I can't even name another legitimate QB out of that field, mainly because there were so few of them. And as far as Cassell and Hoyer, Cassell is only going to start because the Bills have a worse QB than even we do in Manuel, and Hoyer probably is going to be behind Ryan Mallett in Houston.  And as far as your point stands about McCown not being paid backup money, some 2015 salary stats:   McCown: $4,666,667 Sanchez: $4,500,000 Hoyer: $5,252,000 Cassell: $5,252,000 Chase fucking Daniel, yeah, Chase fucking Daniel: $333,333,333   So...yeah."

The only thing that matters is,  Contract guaranteed Money:  So:   McCown = 6.25 mil   Hoyer = 4.75 mil  Cassell = 5.65 mil  Sanchez = 5.5 mil  So... yeah.      I'm going to stop a moment and point out that this is why people believe you're being a pain on these forums; because you're coming off as severely confrontational and not really attempting to add anything to the conversation;    I am adding to the conversation.  You just got your facts wrong.  I don't see how correcting you is confrontational.  I'm more than willing to change my opinion if you offered any realistic stat or information that would make sense.  But so far, all the data you've provided has been either wildly inaccurate, or we're in agreement on.   I can't even name another legitimate QB out of that field,   The point is to have player development.  Not have a probowl ready QB in the 6th.  A guy you can mentor and build. We don't have that.   it's clear no matter what I point out or say, that's not going to budge you on your thoughts about McCown   You can definitely budge me.  If you can find me statistical data or proof that doesn't make him being successful or useful a 1 in a million shot, I'll happily change my mind. I'm not married to an opinion.  The only one who here is, is you.  If we're agreement he's terrible, which we seem to be, then the Browns overpaid for a backup that's terrible, with no upside, on the sole reasoning he ""won't cause problems"".  He's never mentored anyone successfully, he's never shown in 14? years outside of a 5 game stretch where he lost 2 games that he's even been competent.  He's literally dead weight with zero upside.  Cassell would make us a playoff contending team, but do you know why we didn't go after him?  Because he can actually play a little football.  The front office doesn't want another QB to be good.  They're doing this on purpose.  They don't want any sort of controversy.  They would rather lose with McCown if manziel can't beat them out than risk having Hoyer win 9 games."
Browns,35r5tq,Godszn,2,Wed May 13 14:48:07 2015 UTC,"Hey just so ya know, showing off that McCown is making a whopping 600k more than Cassell doesn't help your case that we spent way too much getting McCown. You might want to get your facts right before you go around ""correcting"" others. Edit: Also I just read below on why people think you're being condescending and what I just pointed out shows that. All you did was rewrite the numbers to show that McCown had a larger number in front but he is getting paid back up money we didn't over spend you putting a 6 as the front number doesn't change that."

Browns,35r5tq,SmokeySmokes,14,Wed May 13 16:06:10 2015 UTC,"""a great uncertainty given the way the Cincinnati Bengals treated him last season.""  Treated him in his first NFL start ever.  I'm sure the Bengals went into that game wanting to KILL Johnny after what the Browns did to Dalton earlier in the year.  Where Dalton looked nearly as ugly.  In NOT his first NFL start ever.    Not making excuses. Maybe the Bengals game was a fair representation of what Johnny's career will be.  Maybe not.    At least he has nowhere else to go than up.  Hell, a QBR of 2.0 would be 100% improvement!  Which would make him as good as Dalton was vs. Browns (1st game).  I'm not sure what my point is.  Please downvote."

Browns,35r5tq,Doyle524,1 point,Tue May 12 22:10:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think that average or even serviceable QB play would ""waste"" this season. Our line is looking to be top-2 in the NFL again, our running game should only improve from last year, and our defense should be elite. All of that takes pressure off of the QB to succeed, and gives him room to mature and improve. I think, barring injuries, we should win about 8 games at least. And that's with Ryan Leaf at QB. If our starter proves himself to be competent, that number inflates to 10 easily."
Browns,35r5tq,ClevelandLumberjack,0,Wed May 13 03:13:50 2015 UTC,Seriously? 10 wins. Fans do this every year. Something will not add up. The defense will fall short somewhere or the running backs will take a step back. I think 8 wins is the ceiling and I would be happy with that if Manziel starts. Your optimism is far too strong. The last 6 years are evidence of it.
Browns,35r5tq,RedChocobo2,1 point,Wed May 13 11:30:42 2015 UTC,"Lol come on, I've been a fan for 19 years. You think I don't know that things always go wrong? I'm just saying that something feels different this year. We have very good talent at about 20 positions, and our coaching staff and GM appear to know what they're doing for once. Plus our schedule is getting easier by the day, as 5 of the 8 inter-divisional teams we play are on a severe downturn (or are just plain awful). The Steelers, Jets, and Titans are also either on the downhill or at the bottom. Add to that the mentality we seem to have where we play up in big games, and we could knock off Denver or Seattle. Frankly, I'd be surprised if we don't win either of those. Cincinnati could be a sweep, but we'll at least beat them once, and a split with Baltimore is very possible. We could IMO win as many as 13 or 14 games, but I think 10 is more realistic."
Browns,35rdrp,Godszn,18,Tue May 12 21:48:05 2015 UTC,That pick 6 against IND was one of the biggest plays of the season.  He stepped up at a big moment so there's some positives there for sure.
Browns,35rdrp,PrimeTimeHoyer,6,Tue May 12 22:23:43 2015 UTC,His major upside coming into the draft was the fact that once he intercepts the ball he's a major threat to return it for a TD or massive yards.  Maybe with more snaps we can see some more TDs.
Browns,35rdrp,wertyvv,14,Tue May 12 23:45:18 2015 UTC,He wasn't super shitty. The expectation were just too high. Not every rookie corner we get will be as good as Haden his rookie year.
Browns,35rdrp,kpyle,17,Tue May 12 21:56:32 2015 UTC,"Even at that, Haden wasn't that overly shut-down when he was a rookie as well."
Browns,35rdrp,MUSinfonian,12,Tue May 12 22:06:50 2015 UTC,Haden didn't even play until week 7 or something when he was a rookie. Think about that.
Browns,35rdrp,reddit_like_its_hot,-1,Tue May 12 22:10:52 2015 UTC,That was probably just Mangenius being stubborn.
Browns,35rdrp,fuuuuuuuuuuuck216,4,Thu May 14 12:14:41 2015 UTC,"Haden wasn't that great his rookie season though, he just had 6 INT's which made it look a lot better then it was. Obviously Haden has grown into a elite corner and I just think that shows Gilbert should be given time before we throw him off a bridge."
Browns,35rdrp,draino3112,2,Tue May 12 22:21:21 2015 UTC,I think a lot of people had an issue with his off field issues over lack of on field performance.  Most people understand that CB takes some adjustment time in the NFL but there were comments from vets and the fact that he got benched that caused most of the criticisms of him.
Browns,35rdrp,miked1be,0,Wed May 13 16:04:43 2015 UTC,Gilbert has the size and skill. He made marked improvement over last season IMO. The only thing holding him back is himself and whatever his off the field issues were. With rookies I think there's a much higher chance of turning those around- i.e. most people take awhile to settle down and become adults after college. There's every reason to think Gilbert could turn into a very solid player and compliment to Joe down the line.
Browns,35rdrp,LosingMyEdge7,0,Wed May 13 14:47:09 2015 UTC,"I think expectations were to come in and compete and do your job.  He failed.  When vets are calling you out in the press, things are not going well, to put it mildly.  I believe the entitled behavior, being late to practice not studying etc. is what got/gets to people.  Hopefully, Justin has grown up and will be a man and do his job this year.  Then we should see the natural talent he obviously has take over."
Browns,35rdrp,GoofBoy,6,Wed May 13 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"Weren't his off the field issues, whatever they may be, the most important takeaway from his rookie season though? His play was hit or miss, but I was under the assumption that he was viewed in a negative light for other reasons along with subpar play."
Browns,35rdrp,nizule,4,Tue May 12 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"Yup, his play improved over the season as it should have and he even showed glimpses of being a seriously good corner. His personal stuff got in the way too often though and he was suspended for it. He also had poor attitude and work ethic.   Supposedly he has figured out his personal issues and has been working out with Haden."

Browns,35rdrp,karma199,3,Tue May 12 21:49:12 2015 UTC,It's because he didn't get his start with BR. They brought him and paid him a whole bunch of money to write for them. He was already a pretty well respected NFL draft guys.
Browns,35rdrp,subhuman1,3,Wed May 13 01:41:47 2015 UTC,"I know ""on paper"" has little merit...BUT....  Holy shit the potential is there to be scary good on D this year.

Browns,35rdrp,corysagaming,1 point,Tue May 12 22:42:09 2015 UTC,They had him playing 10 yard off all year.   When Haden is on the other side they are gonna take the easy yards all game.  Hopefully Haden taught him how to play some press man
Browns,35rdrp,djroomba322,-30,Wed May 13 01:22:09 2015 UTC,"Ahh yes, my favorite part of the off season.  That moment when Browns fans are so desperate for their rookie who had a spectacularly bad year, and was 2nd only to their other rookie as the worst player picked in the first round to do well, they're willing to give Matt Millen's words value."
Browns,35rdrp,TapedeckNinja,10,Tue May 12 23:31:43 2015 UTC,You're barking up the wrong tree. That's Matt Miller.
Browns,35rdrp,djroomba322,-17,Wed May 13 02:11:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, wel then that's my bad.  I just assumed Millen was the only one in the world who would say something so dumb.    Oh, so lets take a look at who Matt Miller is.  A local guy with Oklahama Sooners on his twitter profile, who lives right outside of OK, where Gilbert went to college?  Yeah, I think we found the reason this was said."
Browns,35rdrp,TapedeckNinja,11,Wed May 13 02:23:01 2015 UTC,"Sooners? Huh?  Matt Miller is the Todd McShay of BR.  He's a former coach and scout and the rookie rater for Madden, and is generally a pretty well-respected dude. His scouting reports and mocks are very good.  I'm not saying that his opinion on Gilbert means anything, but he's about as legit as it gets. Certainly my go-to guy for scouting reports."
Browns,35rdrp,djroomba322,-14,Wed May 13 02:49:42 2015 UTC,"My brain was thinking ou instead of OSU, same point.  He is only saying it because he's local ESP since no one else is."
Browns,35rdrp,TapedeckNinja,9,Wed May 13 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"So, because he has an opinion you don't happen to agree with, that means he's biased? PFF's analysts disagree with the ""Gilbert was awful"" story, too.  Miller's in the middle of his rookie film review for his upcoming series on the 2014 draft class, that's why he's talking about Gilbert."
Browns,35rdrp,djroomba322,-5,Wed May 13 03:25:47 2015 UTC,So you think that him having Gilbert's alma mater in his twitter profile has absolutely zero influence at all?
Browns,35rdrp,themitey1,7,Wed May 13 08:29:14 2015 UTC,"It may, or it may not.  Why just completely disregard his opinion based something you have no idea about?"

Browns,35rdrp,TopHatAbobo,8,Wed May 13 10:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's exactly like that... except actually nothing like that at all.  Matt Miller has no connection with Oklahoma State.  Even if he did, this is a terrible analogy.  What the hell are you talking about or even trying to say?"
Browns,35rdrp,themitey1,6,Wed May 13 13:52:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's nothing alike.  That would make more sense if Gilbert played one single game ever and was great.  And that's what everyone is basing their opinion on.  He was the top rated CB in the draft last year for a reason.  It wasn't just one guy saying it, and it wasn't just our team saying it.  If we didn't take him, he still would have gone first of all cbs.  This is so silly."
Browns,35rdrp,TapedeckNinja,3,Wed May 13 14:34:09 2015 UTC,I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. I don't see anything Oklahoma State in his profile.

Browns,35rdrp,djroomba322,-17,Tue May 12 23:38:44 2015 UTC,"Why would you say that?  Of course I'm a Browns fan.  But I'm not going to believe Matt Millen all of a sudden when he's shown consistently to be a poor judge of talent.  If you could redraft the first round with only the first round talent, Gilbert would easily go 28th-32nd.    His mechanics where atrocious.  He definitely got better, but he was still outplayed by UDFAs.  Not what you want for a top 10 impact player.  He was benched for conduct detrimental, etc etc.  In an entire season he had 1 good play. http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/media-center/videos/Justin-Gilbert-Picks-Off-Luck-For-A-Touchdown/2bb42153-1604-40c4-b15f-f4e2338eaa10   And if you actually watch it?  He reads it right, but luck threw it right to him because of good pressure.   So does that make me not a Browns fan?  After hearing for a whole 2 off seasons how hard everyone is working and how everyone's changed their life around again, that I might just maybe wait to see it on the field?  Pretty easy to show up for a couple drills in May and make a photo op.  The people who do good in the NFL don't need to have people comment on their work ethic.  They just work.  They're not in the public.  They just go do it and grind.  Anything more is image building.  But Yes, I'm a Browns fan.  Are you?"

He's a leader, and he needs to show results, and only results. The past doesn't matter."
Browns,35v9l2,blackedout,2,Wed May 13 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Plus, I feel there will be far less tension this year in a locker room that isn't split between Hoyer and Manziel considering McCown at least has a better mindset towards being a backup. Just like last year it is JFF's job to take and hold."
Browns,35v9l2,average_white_male,7,Thu May 14 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"If Manziel puts the work in, does the whole ""first in, last to leave"" thing, shows improvement in mechanics/confidence, and has a strong understanding of the pro system I don't think there is any reason that he would lose teammates respect.  It's not about him starting. It has t been and won't be. It's about him showing that he's serious about football and being the best he can be.  Think about it this way: You have a job where you work 37 hours a week but are considered part time. You do what you're supposed to, come in on time and never give anyone problems. Then this dude gets hired as a manager on salary, makes as much or a little bit more than you, and routinely comes in late, looks stupid, and is hungover. You'd probably be pissed... Until you find out he has an addiction problem and goes on leave to go to rehab. If the guy then came back and did his job well, you'd have no reason to dislike him or not respect him.  So even if Manziel proves to have too weak of an arm, makes reads too slowly, and can't make the adjustment, if he does his job and makes the attempt, the locker room will probably respect him for giving it his all... But if that were the case he'd probably also be on his way out."

Browns,35pz7e,miked1be,5,Wed May 13 12:50:59 2015 UTC,"For some reason, no matter who's in charge, the Browns are always slow in the rookie signing process.  Not really a big deal but it just seems like most of the league is always finished well before us.   Edit:  sheesh, wasn't a criticism just an observation."
Browns,35pz7e,Daviroth,6,Tue May 12 15:57:50 2015 UTC,I just personally don't think it's an accurate observation. I feel like we are pretty much right along with the rest of the league.
Browns,35pz7e,miked1be,5,Tue May 12 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not the only one that thinks they've been slow in the past, maybe I'm just looking at a few teams that signed quickly this year and not the league as a whole.  Also,  just stating an opinion to try to get a conversation going in what was an otherwise empty thread."
Browns,35pz7e,Daviroth,4,Tue May 12 17:30:59 2015 UTC,"It's definitely an interesting observation, I don't know why anyone downvoted you."

Browns,35qakq,bmcclure937,30,Tue May 12 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"Ekpre-Olomu said he doesn't regret staying in school. He helped get the Ducks through a 12-1 regular season. He was drafted by one of the teams he wanted, a press-cover team, which is perfect since Ekpre-Olomu's first name, Ifomeno, means ""something that fits you well.""  When the Browns called, he remembers saying ""thank you"" over and over.  ""Making my family proud is a big thing,"" Ekpre-Olomu said. ""That's why I was just relieved to move on to the next chapter. I'm a Brown now.""   Please kick ass next season Captain IEO."
Browns,35qakq,JohnnyFire,11,Tue May 12 17:30:22 2015 UTC,Looks like we may have got a steal. Our secondary is full of talent.
Browns,35qakq,clevelandrocks14,1 point,Tue May 12 17:21:56 2015 UTC,"It was the second best unit on the team last year, behind the offensive line, and our DC stated that it was the group with the most potential for improvement...  Next year could be ridiculous."
Browns,35qakq,Doyle524,1 point,Wed May 13 02:05:12 2015 UTC,Our offensive line struggled pretty hard for most of the season last year. While the secondary put up league leading numbers and three pro bowlers. I think they should get the edge for best unit.
Browns,35qakq,Fakespeedbump,1 point,Wed May 13 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"Our line had one Pro Bowler, but Bitonio was widely considered a snub, and Mack surely would have been there had he not been placed on IR. Greco and Schwartz were also playing at an All Pro level before Mack's injury. Besides, the line was the reason our running game worked, and the reason Hoyer could stand in the pocket for hours and wait for something to develop. Saying that our secondary is the second best unit behind the line is absolutely not a knock on the defensive backs, but a huge praise of our line.   Of course, when Gipson went down, Leonhard stepped in and played at a high level, showing far better depth than our line had. And Desir came off the bench late in the season and played well. The secondary was certainly fantastic."
Browns,35qakq,Doyle524,7,Thu May 14 00:09:41 2015 UTC,"Will he even make the team? As I understand it, because he hasn't played a snap for us, putting him on the IR would cost us a roster spot."
Browns,35qakq,fuckingbrowns,8,Tue May 12 18:33:45 2015 UTC,Red Shirt freshman.
Browns,35qakq,cwap4brains,6,Tue May 12 18:40:36 2015 UTC,It only costs a roster spot through week 1.
Browns,35qakq,Doyle524,3,Tue May 12 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"And I think we'll take that risk, considering his potential."

Browns,35qgvd,R101C,1 point,Tue May 12 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"all good   Nah. I wouldn't be disappointed (after the immediate effects of the game wear off), but it would certainly be much better to win the SB than to lose it."
Browns,35qgvd,Doyle524,0,Tue May 12 19:44:02 2015 UTC,No.
Browns,35qgvd,fuckingbrowns,22,Wed May 13 00:53:47 2015 UTC,I don't believe people go out on the field trying to lose. The players would absolutely hate that.
Browns,35qgvd,droidworkerbee,9,Wed May 13 01:50:13 2015 UTC,Not only that but coaches that got fired for a losing record after being told to lose probably wouldn't stay quiet about it for very long.  Eventually someone would speak out about it if it happened as much as some people suspect it does.
Browns,35qgvd,miked1be,4,Tue May 12 19:03:51 2015 UTC,Exactly. And coaches are trying like to hell to keep their jobs every year. They aren't purposefully losing games because it'll get them fired and then their resume will look like shit anyway once they are fired.
Browns,35qgvd,SnakeLaFleur,4,Tue May 12 17:54:02 2015 UTC,Look at the turnover after the Colts' last season before Luck was drafted.  What coach would agree to tanking to that degree and basically kamikaze-ing their career for the good of the Colts organization that they'll no longer be a part of?
Browns,35qgvd,miked1be,14,Tue May 12 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"With this team, I feel like injuries mount and we don't have good depth at some positions. I think we have some fine starters, but the guys on the bench don't hit it out of the park like some teams seem to be able to do."
Browns,35qgvd,cancrdancr,6,Tue May 12 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"Which is exactly why we drafted the way we did. We have top-end talent in a lot of positions, and now we have top-end depth at those positions and also added what could become top-end talent at other positions where we have holes. Our most vulnerable positions now is Quarterback and -maybe- FS if we don't resign Gipson or have a viable backup with Leonard gone. Our running back group seems solid, not necessarily ultra-talented but productive. Our WR group is solid, not ultra-talented but probably can be productive. We have surrounded whomever our QB is with enough solid pieces on offense that if one piece goes down, it doesn't destroy the integrity of the offense, and our defense has insane depth now against the run and the pass. I don't see us stumbling into the same problem this year as last year."
Browns,35qgvd,gakule,2,Tue May 12 19:12:35 2015 UTC,We're a QB away from being a legit team. Unfortunately it seems like we can never find a legit QB.
Browns,35qgvd,scsmith83,3,Tue May 12 18:17:20 2015 UTC,"You say that, but there are surprises at QB every year. Some fail to perform where people think they should, and some suddenly play at a really high level. Why do people discount that system and the other 21 guys on the field might make some QBs just look really good?"
Browns,35qgvd,Illinois_Jones,2,Tue May 12 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, look at Hoyer last year. With a working running game and little pressure on him to perform, he played very well. The offense as a whole masked his deficiencies and gave him room to make plays when we needed them.   When the running game went to shit after Mack went down, more pressure was put on his shoulders, and defenses could key on him more instead of worrying about the run, and his weaknesses were exposed and capitalized upon."
Browns,35qgvd,Doyle524,1 point,Tue May 12 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"I wish the QB talk would die out. We have what looks to be a great O-line and running game, and an elite defense. Those can carry a team to the playoffs or even the super bowl. Besides, we have two players with decent upsides at QB, and a young receiving corps led by two veterans."
Browns,35qgvd,Doyle524,1 point,Tue May 12 23:35:42 2015 UTC,"I'm usually optimistic in the off season, but until we have a qb that proves he's capable of leading us to wins consistently, I'll temper my expectations. I'm hopeful Johnny proves the doubters wrong and becomes that guy, but it's still TBD.  Our D and the rest of our offense appear capable if the qb play is sufficient enough."
Browns,35qgvd,scsmith83,1 point,Wed May 13 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"See, that's the thing. I think our D and the rest of our offense is capable even if we have Ryan Leaf and JaMarcus Russell at QB. If we get the run working early, that'll be a huge amount of pressure off of our QB's shoulders, which is the best thing that could happen whether Johnny or Josh starts."
Browns,35qgvd,Doyle524,7,Wed May 13 01:54:58 2015 UTC,"From what I recall, we tend to have soft schedules at beginning of the year and then get tough down the stretch at the end."
Browns,35qgvd,Mustang1718,5,Wed May 13 02:06:11 2015 UTC,not sure why you get downvoted for this but the last few years the year end schedule has been tough  and last year really should have been 7 straight losses.. but thank good for Mike Smith being a terrible coach and calling that timeout
Browns,35qgvd,hatmantc,4,Wed May 13 03:17:45 2015 UTC,Maybe other regimes but Pettine would be the biggest hippocyrte (i can't spell) if he did that. Going out and tanking for picks is not playing like a brown

Browns,35qgvd,OrnetteOrnette,1 point,Tue May 12 18:34:00 2015 UTC,Nope. Last year was 100% a result of injuries and a lack of depth. It was apparent as soon as Mack went down.

Browns,35nva5,average_white_male,6,Tue May 12 12:11:17 2015 UTC,I'd like to see a comparison of a real vs. fake one.
Browns,35nva5,Doyle524,-2,Tue May 12 13:00:29 2015 UTC,There have been several in the last couple weeks.
Browns,35nva5,average_white_male,12,Wed May 13 01:43:26 2015 UTC,Because not everyone wants to pay $100 plus dollars for small differences that absolutely no one will notice unless they stare at the jersey for twenty minutes. So I save myself the 80 bucks and accept some random stitching differences.
Browns,35nva5,hatmantc,8,Tue May 12 12:56:46 2015 UTC,i think at this point we should have a sticky post so that people can post there instead of in self post that are going to soon be dominating the subreddit
Browns,35nva5,average_white_male,4,Tue May 12 13:07:19 2015 UTC,That would be useful. Hopefully it just passes soon when other actual Browns news starts with the season.

Since the jerseys are new, there has been no feedback to read on the site to be able to tell if you are buying from someone who has a quality product or not.  People are posting these to try to help others sift through/avoid the crap sellers."
Browns,35nva5,Execrat0r,5,Tue May 12 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to give everyone an update on the quality and overall look of the jersey.  THIS is the exact link I purchased from, I'd assume different sellers have different quality jerseys possibly.    Overall it looks great.  A few stringy areas where the stitching may need trimmed a tiny bit if I want to be nitpicky, but overall, I'm very happy with color, design, etc.    Fitment is a bit different.  I opted for a Large, as that's what I thought I had ordered last time with my Josh Gordon jersey, but apparently I had previously ordered a medium :/ ... The large is a bit big, but will fill out nicely with a hoodie underneath, come winter tailgating.  Hope this helps you guys get a better idea of what kind of product they have!"

Browns,35mftr,youwithme,22,Mon May 11 19:03:54 2015 UTC,YES! You buy the Shelton jersey and I'll rub my body all over a Roethlisberger jersey.

Now he's just positioning himself as the best player to ever play his position in NFL history.  Something that would be much more likely if the Browns ever stop failing around him and manage some success.

Browns,35mftr,Deadleggg,6,Mon May 11 23:39:55 2015 UTC,The veterans who make it past their rookie deals and get paid more than vet minimum are.  Every dollar less being paid to draft picks is a dollar more teams can spend on the top- and mid-tier talent.  It's why the players were willing to concede to a rookie pay scale in the CBA - all of the big voices in the NFLPA are players who get those big money deals.
Browns,35mftr,admiralkit,2,Tue May 12 00:46:38 2015 UTC,Some players aren't.  The vets that were lower draft picks but shined in the NFL are probably pretty happy with the extra cap space available.
Browns,35mftr,miked1be,1 point,Tue May 12 00:48:48 2015 UTC,Rookies aren't. Veteran players get better contracts because teams don't have to commit massive amounts of money relative to unproven rookies.

I'd love to own a jersey, I've never had a jersey before. At this point, even a cheap Chinese knock-off would do... Unfortunately this is my wallet.

Browns,35m0my,miked1be,7,Tue May 12 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Lots of safe picks.  Not because they're not flashy, but because they're ceilings are lower and safer.  We definitely filled some holes but we didn't address, as he said, our two biggest holes on the team.  I wish we went safe last year, and took some chances this year instead."
Browns,35m0my,djroomba322,6,Mon May 11 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"but because they're ceilings are lower and safer.   I'd equally argue that their floors are higher. These kids aren't going to be busts. At worst, they'll be solid, but ultimately not elite level, starters."

Browns,35m0my,miked1be,8,Tue May 12 00:06:55 2015 UTC,"Ceilings and floors are two different things. A player can look to have a high floor AND a high ceiling (Luck) or a low floor and a high ceiling (Manziel or someone like him but I know you'll disagree with that but whatever).  He was clarifying to add in that there was more of an upside than you were mentioning but since it was a positive reply to you, you obviously had to be condescending. That clear things up at all?"

Browns,35m0my,TapedeckNinja,2,Tue May 12 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"Obviously the biggest hole (or maybe, the biggest unknown) on the team is QB ... but there was nothing to be done about that in the draft short of sending three first-round picks to the Titans to get Mariota, and obviously the Browns didn't think he was worth that.  After that, I think Shelton filled the biggest need.  Our receivers aren't exciting but our defensive line was awful last year: 20th in passing offense (22nd by DVOA) and 32nd in rushing defense (31st by DVOA)."
Browns,35m0my,youwithme,1 point,Mon May 11 21:03:32 2015 UTC,"We have been given shit for not going after QB and WR in the draft. I like the plan though. They are giving Johnny a legitimate shot next year. They boosted up the defense, running game and offensive line. I know they didn't grab a WR early, but they did grab some veteran receivers who are going to (hopefully) run good routes and know the playbook. If all goes according to plan, they will run the ball and keep it simple for Johnny.   If all of that works out, we will look back at how great this draft was. If it doesn't, well fuck."

Browns,35m0my,revamp11,1 point,Mon May 11 17:30:51 2015 UTC,"Major deficiency before he got injured was his strength and size which causes him to fall off of tackles and get out-positioned vs. larger WR’s. Buster Skrine had this issue for a little while but Buster is a better athlete than this kid at full health. He was never going to be a first round pick as was pumped up in media circles for the past few years   I wasn't editorializing or even commenting.  I was quite honestly surprised to read any criticisms of Ifo after the exciting highlight videos and hype--every other article prior to this one called Ifo the possible steal of the draft.    Now in strolls a scout who not only is lukewarm on the pick, but then says Skrine (who we let walk, and whom not many Browns fans were overly fond of due to his PI penalties, etc) is better.  My comment was barely 10 words long and I merely succinctly summarized what was said, how did I mangle, or ""mince"" the report?"
Browns,35m0my,themitey1,1 point,Mon May 11 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"Because you left out athlete.  I'm not saying what you did was intentional, but the scout isn't saying Buster is better than Ifo.  Only that Buster is a better athlete.  Leaving out athlete implies that Buster is all around better, which is not what he said."
Browns,35m0my,AKlep,8,Tue May 19 02:05:43 2015 UTC,"The article claimed Skrine was the better athlete, not player. Even so, how is Skrine not the better player?

Browns,35or2d,RP336,6,Tue May 12 13:09:50 2015 UTC,Nice job Rapoport. Add another check to the bullshit column.
Browns,35or2d,rljohnson21,5,Tue May 12 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"Well Shelton did sign a injury agreement that in the case he had a bad injury he would accept the terms. It's not like Rapoport was standing in the room and twisted it, most likely his ""source"" didn't relay the information correctly. Shelton DID sign something where he would accept the terms, so Rapoport isn't wrong in spirit. It's a technicality."

Saw him light it up at college and he also went to my rival high school, so I saw plenty of him there.   I really hope he makes it on to the final roster. He really is a great player and person overall. Our university just won the division 2 championship and he is a big reason why. His draft stock should have been higher but an injury set him a back and made him miss a few games this past season. He grew up a Cowboys fan and he loves to compare himself to Dez Bryant. He has the size, really physical, and great hands.  With Josh Gordon being out and all, I'd really love to see him become the next UDFA star. Be on the lookout guys!"

Browns,35lsww,Kosmo_Kramer_,5,Mon May 11 16:15:39 2015 UTC,"Even if that happens, Cardale will still be a fairly high pick.  Meyer isn't picking his starter based on who is the best NFL player, he's taking the best for his system, which in my opinion is JT Barrett by far."
Browns,35lsww,DrBasedGod,1 point,Mon May 11 17:16:55 2015 UTC,But wouldn't cardale have left school if he wasn't promised the starting job? He had a first round grade pretty much on lock
Browns,35lsww,Kosmo_Kramer_,4,Mon May 11 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"He's a pretty good kid, he made it clear in his presser that he never considered leaving.  Being in school and growing up is what he wanted to do.  Meyer won't know until August who he is going to start, and I think he made that clear to all three of them."
Browns,35lsww,DrBasedGod,2,Mon May 11 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm from Cleveland but don't follow the Buckeyes so I don't really know much about the situation. I've never seen three legit QBs fighting for the same spot so I'm wondering what happens to the other two once Meyer chooses a starter? Could miller transfer or does he not have eligibility?"
Browns,35lsww,Kosmo_Kramer_,2,Mon May 11 19:20:51 2015 UTC,"Miller graduated so he could transfer and play a year per the graduate transfer rule (like how Russell Wilson played a year at Wisconsin).  He is currently enrolled and working out in Columbus despite rumors of him going to Duke, Alabama, Oregon, etc.  He is a central Ohio boy and has a kid and Meyer loves him like a son.  So he shouldn't be going anywhere.  He'll play somehow, whether at QB or slotback or WR.    It really is an unprecedented situation.  JT has three more years left, so he definitely won't leave.  Cardale is the only real NFL prospect at the moment."

I was also a bit critical at the time of the selection, but this guy is a playmaker and we will find a way to use his talent.  A lot of people forget just how dominate The U was for a stretch in the early 2000s in terms of NFL talent. Glad to see the Duke in Cleveland."
Browns,35l8qs,_MitchPlease,5,Mon May 11 15:11:55 2015 UTC,"At first I was pretty mad about this pick. I'm a BIG T-West fan, and fantasize about seeing West and Crow both rush for 1,000+ yards in a single season. I thought this pick took away from that fantasy.   After having actually thought about it, I really like this pick. He brings a different sort of running style to our game. Truly a Change of Pace back, and not just a third-and-short kind of guy. I think that, if utilized properly, Duke Johnson ends up being the perfect #3 on our depth chart. Where he provides enough small bursts to ensure the durability of West and Crow, without really taking away from their overall productivity. The argument could even be made that Duke could potentially be at #2 on our depth chart, with West and Crow sharing the #1.   I've just been saying for a while that I believe the best path to success for our Cleveland Browns is through the run game. With our dedication to beefing up the O-Line, and adding depth and versatility at RB, I'm really hopeful of an entire season where we run as well as the first 3 games of 2014."
Browns,35l8qs,Troop-the-Loop,5,Mon May 11 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"When you have three RBs  with relatively different skillsets, it forces defenses to stay honest to defending the run game. Not to mention with the addition of Duke we could potentially change the style of the running game depending on what opponents are weak against.  West brings a somewhat inconsistent ""dancing"" style, which  I think makes him our ""big play"" guy. Crowell is a one cut, ""hit the hole and go"" kind of runner and Duke is a ""catch the ball (whether lined up behind the QB or split wide as a receiver) and pass block"" kind of back.  Honestly, I think the run game is going to kick ass. And if Johnny/McCown can just avoid turnovers and get the ball to receivers that really ought to be open, our offense will be as good as it was last season before Hoyer completely imploded."
Browns,35l8qs,BeDoubleYou,3,Mon May 11 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the other great thing about this pick, he can return kicks as well"

Browns,35naeb,TucanJamz,1 point,Tue May 12 00:01:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree then, I feel like the roster's pretty set once you start the regular season. Barring some T-Rich type trade, roster moves are a minimal thing once you get down to the 53 guys. The only transactions the Browns made in the first month of the season last year were practice squad rotations and when a significant injury like Mack's happened, the only response was activating Nick McDonald from the PUP list. These are tasks that a competent assistant can handle."

Punishment was harsh for these reasons, also to stop them from continuing the way their organization behaves and any other organization that wants to mimic them in the future. Ruling was heavy handed with reason.    Anyways,  I guess I'll be the asshole and say it, 31 picks in the first round benefits us next year in the second round and it's always nice when bad things happen to Sports teams outside of Cleveland."

Browns,35naeb,TapedeckNinja,3,Mon May 11 23:10:21 2015 UTC,"wow, I could not disagree more....it was CHEATING....far more serious than anything Josh 'the brain' Gordon ever did"
Browns,35naeb,Bhockzer,3,Mon May 11 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"Everybody cheats. There are hundreds of things that happen on the field every week that are cheating. Skrine was a cheater; he'd get beat and grab a jersey. Holding is cheating.   I don't really care about Brady one way or the other, but I don't think ""he cheated"" is a reasonable justification for what turned out to be an extraordinarily harsh punishment (due to the lost picks).  IMO, the hammer came down because the Patriots didn't cooperate fully and because they were so indignant about the investigation in public."
Browns,35naeb,24rubikscube,3,Tue May 12 00:55:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and Buster would get penalized for grabbing the jersey. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Comparing committing a penalty in a game to what appears to be a long running and systematic method of circumventing rules is asinine. Hell, the rules that were broken are rules that were created as a result of QBs like Brady and Manning lobbying the NFL to allow for the teams to prepare and provide their own footballs, within a specific set of guidelines, rather than have to use footballs prepared and provided by the NFL."

Every team should be extremely concerned if the league can just curbstomp them even if in this case, no physical deflation was shown and no real evidence of Brady ordering deflation was uncovered. Hypothetically, how good would you feel about league investigators rolling into Cleveland right now based on a tip from some rival for something that you were even 100% certain of your innocence?"
Browns,35naeb,SmokeySmokes,9,Tue May 12 06:11:44 2015 UTC,"I will preface this by saying I am a life long Browns fan.   If everyone here thinks the Patriots' success is all due to under-inflating footballs by a cunt hair the everyone here is fucking crazy. If you think 10 percent of it is due to that you're crazy. Fuck the colts. Fuck Jim irsay. And fuck Payton fucking manning. In the afc championship the colts got beat 45 TO 7. At half, the colts 'discovered' the tampered with balls and had them replaced and STILL GOT THEIR ASSES KICKED. You think that's because of under-inflated footballs? Did the pats D dominate the colts because of that? Give me a fucking break. Jim irsay and manning had to cry UNTIL THE LEAGUE CHANGED THE WAY PASSES ARE DEFENDED to win a Super Bowl. It's a bunch of sour grapes. And if you don't think every team in the league cheats, ALL OF THEM, you're a gullible shithead and deserve to lose the rest of your miserable life. ALL TEAMS CHEAT. EVERYONE DOES STEROIDS."
Browns,35naeb,Godszn,8,Mon May 11 22:51:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think the Pats are getting such a harsh punishment becuase they've been caught several times cheating. Do I think it's over kill? Yes. Is it understandable due to their history of cheating? Yes."
Browns,35naeb,sugar_free_haribo,5,Mon May 11 22:58:35 2015 UTC,I absolutely think the ball deflating has nothing to do w/ their success. I also absolutely think that has nothing to do w/ how the NFL should treat the punishment
Browns,35naeb,Spaceghost466,2,Mon May 11 23:03:08 2015 UTC,"ALL TEAMS CHEAT. EVERYONE DOES STEROIDS.   I've been asked by a few people if this controversy has lowered my esteem of Brady at all. The honest answer is no, because I think PEDs are worse than potentially removing 0.4 psi from balls, and I'm pretty fucking sure he's on PEDs of some kind. I don't think it's even really possible to play in the NFL without doing some incredibly sketchy shit on the down low, either for performance enhancement or recovery. The naive/opportunistic outrage over deflategate is utterly insane. Teams around the league are popping champagne all while ceding a ridiculous amount of their rights to the NFL and opening themselves up to devastatingly unfair ""investigations"" in the future."
Browns,35naeb,FaceFive,1 point,Tue May 12 06:23:57 2015 UTC,Wait. Sorry. Are you fucking saying the NFL never changed any rules due to Brady's whining?
Browns,35naeb,hambone21,1 point,Tue May 12 00:54:00 2015 UTC,"I would bet the repeated cheating (its only cheating if you get caught) plays into the punishment.  I also agree they were hands down the best team on the field vs the Colts. So, why in the fuck cheat if you are that much better? Not Brady's finest moment. I always saw him as the model for a QB. I wish he had not been a part of it."
Browns,35naeb,topper_mango,0,Tue May 12 01:17:33 2015 UTC,Manning plays for the Broncos...
Browns,35naeb,kpyle,6,Tue May 12 18:20:24 2015 UTC,I think the 1st round pick was excessive. IMO brady should've gotten 6-8 games and a fine for the patriots. Brady and the trainers doing something stupid shouldn't mean the team misses out on a high pick.
Browns,35naeb,sugar_free_haribo,2,Mon May 11 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"I think taking draft picks in any situation involving players is the way to go.  When you suspend a player of Brady's importance for any number of games less than a full season, you end up putting other teams on the schedule at an advantage or disadvantage.  The Dolphins and the Jets have to face Brady twice next season.  Buffalo only has to face Brady once.  Advantage Buffalo.  Totally unfair to Miami and New York."
Browns,35naeb,kpyle,2,Tue May 12 01:15:43 2015 UTC,The suspension should count against division opponents first. Each gets one game and then the last one is random. Way more detrimental when a player leaves intermittently.
Browns,35naeb,topper_mango,1 point,Tue May 12 04:13:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting suggestion, but there are too many suspensions whose length is not a clean multiple of 3."

Browns,35naeb,StalinOut,3,Tue May 12 04:16:02 2015 UTC,Anything more than one game is ludicrous tbh. The league has shown they will punish based on public outcry and not actual gravity of offense. Seriously stupid.
Browns,35naeb,Peter_Panyc,2,Mon May 11 23:15:43 2015 UTC,Because drugs are bad mmmmkay
Browns,35naeb,Peter_Panyc,4,Mon May 11 22:22:12 2015 UTC,Unpopular opinion I do agree. Brady cheated his way to the super bowl and josh smoked a blunt that doesn't even improve performance.
Browns,35naeb,Peter_Panyc,2,Mon May 11 22:33:00 2015 UTC,"Comparing Brady to Gordon is pretty short sighted. 1st time offender, no concrete evidence that Brady had anything to do with it, Whereas Gordon repeatedly broke rules and we had legitimate proof."
Browns,35naeb,kpyle,2,Tue May 12 11:20:47 2015 UTC,"Brady will miss 2 games on appeal. Gordon will miss 20. Brady cheated in the AFC championship game. Gordon got high on his own time while playing for a team that never made the playoffs. They are different.   We don't need concrete evidence, people have been put in prison on less. We didn't need concrete evidence to know Bonds was juicing, we all knew it when he magically hit 70+.   The draft picks are because of a pattern of cheating."
Browns,35naeb,sugar_free_haribo,2,Tue May 12 12:02:31 2015 UTC,"I don't mean for this to sound condescending but it seems like you don't understand how laws work. You can't indict someone just because you know. You need proof, you know, like drug tests. Our opinions do not matter here. It's a matter of fact. Secondly Brady wasn't suspended for tampering with the balls. He was suspended for not cooperating with the NFL."
Browns,35naeb,kpyle,2,Tue May 12 12:32:00 2015 UTC,"But you're wrong. You can indict someone without proof. You can indict someone simply based on testimony of a cop and nothing else. If you've ever spent time on a grand jury, you would know this. I just wrapped up a term of service, so the jury instructions are pretty fresh in my head. The saying about being able to indict a ham sandwich, it's pretty accurate.   People have been not just indicted, but convicted of murder based on eye witness accounts, which were later learned to be mistaken based on additional evidence and dna testing. If you've never read up on how often eye witness accounts of fact are wrong, you should. It's crazy.   The concept of fact is fun when what was done was done behind closed doors. We won't have video of it and everyone involved will deny it. The balls were flat, and if a linebacker knew it, then a control freak qb knew it. So, yeah, he got punished for lying and the team got punished for the organization cheating yet again."
Browns,35naeb,sugar_free_haribo,1 point,Tue May 12 12:56:59 2015 UTC,"You and I agree that eye witness testimony is often exaggerated and has been used to wrongfully accuse and indict someone. In this case we have even less than that, especially when we look at the evidence that is directly related to Brady. Even with the text conversations, nothing us ever said that remotely shows that Brady was involved.  Is there anything showing that he told them to deflate the balls? Or that he knew?"
Browns,35naeb,kpyle,1 point,Tue May 12 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, I'll say it again. He is one of the most detail oriented and competitive people in the league. He sleeps on a schedule when on vacation. We've all read about his dedication even the week after they lose a playoff game. There is no way he didn't have the ultimate say on ball inflation. Imagine the grief the equipment guy would get if he under or over inflated the balls without talking to Brady first. I would put a substantial sum of money on it. And ultimately, he stood in the way of the investigation, which pissed off the king."
Browns,35naeb,sugar_free_haribo,2,Tue May 12 16:42:54 2015 UTC,The New England Asterisks can suck a dick. Give them the Pete Rose treatment. Ban them from the post season until Brady and Belichick retires as well. I fucking hate cheaters. What little respect I had left for that team is gone.

If you are in the NFL you have to be on drugs in order not to die and play every single week. The sport wouldn't exist in its current form without drugs. Deflated balls on the other hand...   and many of whom are  ""cheating"" in subtle ways.   How so? Because they are basically holding on every play? That isn't close to the scale of the shady bullshit organization of the patriots. You fucking pride yourselves on taking everything to the edge of legality for any sort of advantage. Then they change or enforce the rule so you find another loophole. Look at that ravens game with your finicky eligible receiver horse shit. ""BB is so smart."" No he isn't. He was exploiting a bullshit and since closed loophole. Its not genuine, but its technically legal. The patriots favorite kind of legal.  What kills me the most is how the patriots don't even need to cheat to be good, but they do anyways. Bunch of insecure little bitches. Keep playing that close to the fire and you'll get burned."
Browns,35naeb,138glv,2,Tue May 12 11:43:28 2015 UTC,"I’m just going to let the cat of the bag, every team does it, every game, it has been since I played. Cause when you take the balls out of the bag, they are rock hard. And you can't feel the ball as well. It's too hard. Everybody puts the pin in and takes just enough air out of the ball that you can feel it a little better. But it's not the point to where it's flat. So I don't know what the big deal is. It's not something that's not been done for 20 years. Well, I would say [to a ball boy], 'Take a little bit of air out of it. It's a little bit hard. And then he'd take a little bit out and I'd squeeze it and I'd be like, 'OK, it's perfect.' That’s it.   - Jeff Blake   In 2012 Brad Johnson paid 7,500 for ball handlers to scuff and wear in the balls before Super Bowl XXXVII, per Johnson's preference. ""I paid some guys off to get the balls right,"" Johnson told the Tampa Bay Times in 2012. ""I went and got all 100 footballs, and they took care of all of them.""   If you really care so much about this, if you have any consistency on this matter, you should be screaming bloody murder right now demanding investigations of all teams and calling into question the result of every NFL game ever.   The NFL already did that and found something that deserved a punishment. It obviously wasn't competitively advantageous or we'd have been punished as mush as you cheaters.   You misunderstand. I'm not talking about just Farmer or whatever limited to the scope of this particular infraction. You seem to believe that at least your team and many/most others are pure as the driven snow. Put down your pitchfork for a second and really think about what would be found if we actually had access to all the shit that is discussed within any NFL front office or locker room.   I don't care. If you are in the NFL you have to be on drugs in order not to die and play every single week. The sport wouldn't exist in its current form without drugs. Deflated balls on the other hand...   Way to move the goalposts. PEDs of any kind are ok but a suspected 0.3 psi removed from balls that's actually consistent with Ideal Gas Law predictions is somehow worthy of you losing your shit? 0.3 psi is an order of magnitude less than what is even faintly perceptible to humans.   You fucking pride yourselves on taking everything to the edge of legality for any sort of advantage. Then they change or enforce the rule so you find another loophole. Look at that ravens game with your finicky eligible receiver horse shit. ""BB is so smart."" No he isn't. He was exploiting a bullshit and since closed loophole.

You realize that protocols have changed since these guys played? I'm not sure refs did the same checks as they do now. It's not that the patriots modified them, its they did so illegally and then tried to cover it up.   Put down your pitchfork for a second and really think about what would be found if we actually had access to all the shit that is discussed within any NFL front office or locker room.   That's idiotic. On a long enough time line, everyone has done someting wrong. You, me, your grandma, Goodell. The punishment is always worse when you try to cover it up.   PEDs of any kind are ok   Yes they are, well some of them. They are entertainers. Their job is to do amazing feats of physicality. If it doesn't do long term damage to their body and is being used under medical supevision they are perfectly fine. But since they are illegal, players can't do them safely. They need to approve some forms of PEDs. They never will because what will the children think?   0.3 psi is an order of magnitude less than what is even faintly perceptible to humans.   Well most of the balls measured below 11, the lowest being 10.5 as documented by the report. That is a noticeable amount. The amount isn't all that important. The fact that between pre-game checks and half time, 9 of 11 patriot game balls were magically below the legal threshold by at least 1 psi. Someone tampered with those balls.  Also, even if the wells report is dead wrong, 0.3 illegal is still illegal. Ask Josh Gordon.   Where is your anger for the Eagles and Lions who ran similar plays during the regular season? Literally no one gave a shit at the time.   And most people won't because it wasn't illegal at the time. That's not the point. The point is the Pats consistently play close to the line of legal. They may not necessarily always cross it but that doesn't make it right. It's just a shady practice."
Browns,35naeb,TopHatAbobo,1 point,Tue May 12 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"You realize that protocols have changed since these guys played?   Irrelevant. It's blatant cheating. Just like Jerry Rice's admission to using stickum throughout his career. Here's what you had to say about cheating:   Give them the Pete Rose treatment. Ban them from the post season until Brady and Belichick retires as well. I fucking hate cheaters.   On the matter of PEDs, you are so ideologically inconsistent that it really defies belief. An archaic rule established in the 1930s about legal air pressure, which no one at the league ever questioned or even understood the thermodynamics of prior to January, is suddenly so utterly sacrosanct that you are losing your fucking mind over it, but the totally unregulated, well-researched, criminally illegal use of drugs that can radically impact the fairness of the on-field product doesn't matter at all to you. Personally I don't care about either. But it's clear that PEDs have way more impact and potential to create asymmetrical competitive scenarios.  And again, the alleged deflation here (that wasn't even close to being proven) is 0.3 psi, which is not even humanly palpable. Never mind the fact that based on outdoor conditions balls can vary in pressure anywhere from 9 to 15 psi.   Well most of the balls measured below 11, the lowest being 10.5 as documented by the report. That is a noticeable amount. The amount isn't all that important. The fact that between pre-game checks and half time, 9 of 11 patriot game balls were magically below the legal threshold by at least 1 psi. Someone tampered with those balls.   You don't know what the hell you're talking about. Start here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/35i21s/based_florio_a_prominent_media_member_has_finally/  Read the three linked PFT articles from the weekend (has been picked up by many others by now including Peter King who has vociferously agreed with that analysis) as well as the rest of the thread. The point is that deflation cannot be shown at all, and in the very worst case scenario - resting on a ridiculous number of simply untenable and unscientific assumptions - the league claims 0.3 psi deflation. There is NO physical evidence.  Even regardless of which gauge was used to check balls in the pre-game, the Wells Report concedes that if the Pats' balls were measured in the first 4 minutes of halftime (as opposed to minutes 2 through 6 as they claim), then the pressure readings were consistent with the Ideal Gas Law. The entire house of cards of Wells' argument relies on one non-expert's recollection of the pre-game inflation levels of 48 different balls to a tenth of a psi in a room with uncertain atmospheric conditions, whether balls were measured at halftime one minute earlier or later, and a hundred other things that would be LAUGHED out of court.  Brace yourself for Brady's entire suspension to be thrown out on appeal. It's 100% going to happen and you can tag me as saying that.   And most people won't because it wasn't illegal at the time. That's not the point.   It wasn't illegal when the Pats did it either. They were running the same plays that other teams had earlier in the season. You are again changing your tune to excuse some perceived transgression when done by a non-Patriots team."

I purchased a White jersey from Aliexpress, and I compared it to my (real) white jersey from last year. The orange was slightly darker, which is about what I had figured through the editing - it wasn't going to look too crazily different from a distance.  I also ordered from ""New Power Sport Store"".  I can post some pictures later tonight comparing the aliexpress jersey with the jersey I bought from the mall last season."

Like, so bright it practically glows in the dark. It's like a reflective vest. Also the stripe on the sleeves is printed on weirdly, it comes almost to downward point instead of being straight from the front to the back. There were loose threads everywhere and poor stitching, but nothing super noticeable.  Overall for what I paid I'd say it's a fine jersey, but definitely not as good as I assume the authentic one is."

Browns,35ju30,Helix1322,9,Mon May 11 01:40:00 2015 UTC,"Generally in my experience the official jerseys come in three flavors:  I: Nike Game - Entirely silk screen. The jersey material feels pretty nice but it looks kind of cheap. Generally retails for about $99. I only think it's worth buying if you see a former player's jersey at Kohls for $15/$20.  II: Nike Limited - This $150 variant has stitched numbers, name/nameplate, and possibly the ""Cleveland"" across the chest (don't own one, someone should let me know). The only thing silk screened will be the strips on the sleeves. I think this is the best value for the long haul, maybe for a player like Haden, Bitonio, Shelton, or Irving.  III: Nike Elite - This one is what you get for Joe Thomas. It's $250ish and everything is stitched. If you own this you probably want to get it signed and hang it in a frame and never eat wings in the same room as it. These are reserved for highly regarded picks or players. Thomas and Haden will have these, but when a star QB is drafted like Manziel was last year you will see them pop up for that player. Get this for a player you see going to the hall of fame or being a Brown for their entire career.  Of the three I'd suggest the limited for your situation."

National Football League of article  Third jersey:       The NFL was the last of the major professional sports leagues to adopt the third jersey rule in 2002, with the only exceptions being the 1994 season, when teams issued a throwback uniform in honor of the league's 75th Anniversary. Initially, the NFL rule stated that a team may wear their third jersey only once a year, however, after one year this restriction was increased to twice a year. There are currently no rules on wearing alternate pants. Teams are also permitted to wear alternate jerseys as often as desired in playoff games (except the Super Bowl, where teams must wear their standard uniforms); the only team to do so (other than in 1994) was the 2008 San Diego Chargers.

Browns,35hifr,miked1be,1 point,Sun May 10 18:14:10 2015 UTC,"Additionally, if they had named him the starter instead of McCown the media would've went crazy. Clearly we don't want that."
Browns,35hifr,Fakespeedbump,11,Mon May 11 05:41:20 2015 UTC,"Look, I really hope he works out for us. I truly truly do. It's what we've been longing for since our return. We all just want a damn quarterback.  I listened to Mary Kay's video and she's full of shit mostly, However.....  I'm sorry but if I'm Johnny, and I know I'm working hard and I'm not even being given a chance to prove myself, then I'm requesting a trade.   Roll with him this year and let him learn. You're not moving the franchise forward any by playing McCown. You will be an average team at best and you will have learned nothing about your 1st round QB. At least if you let Johnny start and he tanks then you know he's garbage and you can move forward by drafting a new QB next year."
Browns,35hifr,dring_round,12,Sun May 10 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"Who says he's not getting a chance here? I think it was a huge vote of confidence that the team didn't draft a QB this year. I think all the right things are being said right now, we just gotta wait until the season starts."
Browns,35hifr,TucanJamz,6,Sun May 10 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"I think it is Johnnys spot to win. The dude just got out of rehab after being given the opportunity many people dream about and he has blown it...so far. The FO and coaches aren't going to just hand the keys right back to him since he went to rehab. He has to show through camp and preseason that he has changed. It seems he's done that so far, but McCown is still there to make him keep working for it.   Or McCown becomes BasedMcCown and takes us to the promised land?"
Browns,35hifr,qck11,0,Sun May 10 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"McCown wasn't brought in to be the solution - he is explicitly a placeholder who can also be a mentor.  If Manziel is someone who can be developed, he's certainly getting the opportunity to learn instead of being thrown to the wolves.  As long as the team is investing time and training and a roster spot on him, he has no worries about being shunted to the sidelines."
Browns,35hifr,admiralkit,2,Sun May 10 21:42:31 2015 UTC,"Well, Joe Thomas seems to be on-board with the ""New Johnny"", so I'm hopeful that he has his life priorities figured out.  His play on the other hand, that still needs A LOT of work."
Browns,35hifr,french_toste,4,Sun May 10 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"I just don't think he's big enough. I was at that bengals game, and he looked like a little kid out there. I also hope he will be good, but I won't believe it until I actually see it. Go Browns! Woof! Woof!"
Browns,35hifr,Lando1025,1 point,Sun May 10 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly, when you can't see over your own line you're basically throwing blind if you go over the middle."
Browns,35hifr,Witness_My_Greatness,3,Sun May 10 20:26:59 2015 UTC,QB's don't usually see over their line. They see through lanes.
Browns,35hifr,Kramereng,2,Sun May 10 21:01:07 2015 UTC,Russell is over an inch shorter....
Browns,35hifr,dring_round,-2,Sun May 10 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"Russel Wilson is thick. Johnny is skinny, I've seen it with my own eyes. Trust me I want him to be good, but I'll be joyously shocked if he can preform at the pro level."
Browns,35hifr,Lando1025,5,Sun May 10 22:56:48 2015 UTC,"What does being ""thick"" have to do with height or being able to see over the line?"
Browns,35hifr,dring_round,-4,Sun May 10 23:27:10 2015 UTC,"I suppose we will just have to wait and see, won't we."
Browns,35hifr,Lando1025,-5,Sun May 10 23:43:00 2015 UTC,"Where in the hell do you get that from?  Wilson measured in at 5'11""1/4 and Manziel measured in at 5'11""3/4.  And that's the only thing they remotely have in common."
Browns,35hifr,djroomba322,3,Mon May 11 12:01:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, I made an error.   Now go away."
Browns,35hifr,dring_round,3,Mon May 11 15:09:35 2015 UTC,"How DARE you sir!  There is absolutely NO WAY you could be off on someone's height by ONE INCH.  WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GET THAT FROM!??!?!  (Also, if we're going to be super pedantic, Russell Wilson's Combine height was measured at 5' 10 5/8"")"
Browns,35hifr,TopHatAbobo,2,Mon May 11 20:27:35 2015 UTC,"So, therefore I'm right. Thank you."

Browns,35hifr,chris101010,4,Sun May 10 15:45:40 2015 UTC,Right ... I don't think Manziel's behavior/performance in camp was really ever the issue.  Seems like things spiraled out of control for him when the season actually started and he took the backup spot.
Browns,35hifr,TapedeckNinja,2,Sun May 10 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah he didn't react well to being backup when at best Hoyer and he were equals in preseason.  When we were winning it was all rosy, but as Hoyer's limitations started losing games it became a problem.  Of course he wasn't ready and it showed, but that's on him not preparing as a professional, and hopefully that is fixed this season."
Browns,35hifr,PrimeTimeHoyer,2,Mon May 11 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree, I think Johnny got spoiled with the idea that he was going to be starting and then when he didn't get it he just said ""well fine if I'm not getting my way then I'm just gonna pout and not try and get better"" then fucked himself when he actually got to play and didn't know anything"
Browns,35hifr,rdpcatfan,1 point,Mon May 11 01:16:10 2015 UTC,"Where's the gif of Manziel on the sideline ""I woulda fuckin hit him"" after Hoyer airmailed another longball.    I'll admit I thought it was hilarious of course much less hilarious when Manziel plays like garbage when he gets the start and doesn't even attempt a deep ball before he gets injured."
Browns,35hifr,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Mon May 11 03:23:54 2015 UTC,It's kind of hilarious now but at the time it was awful. But I get what you're saying about the deep ball but that is more of an issue play calling than Johnny and we all know that he didn't know the playbook so he definitely didn't call the plays
Browns,35hifr,rdpcatfan,2,Mon May 11 03:46:44 2015 UTC,"Let's be real. What else is he gonna say? ""Oh yeah he's not looking too good fuck my life"". He's kinda forced to say he's looking good out there for trade value, publicity and for JFF."
Browns,35hifr,always_selling,3,Sun May 10 15:57:41 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to say ""fantastic."" The bare minimum would be, ""Johnny is doing the stuff we've asked him to."""
Browns,35hifr,newsballs,1 point,Sun May 10 16:07:23 2015 UTC,"Still no guarantee to turn it into success, but one less obstacle out of the way, and one that was in his control."
Browns,35hifr,smartfbrankings,1 point,Mon May 11 17:13:43 2015 UTC,"""This guy is an insane talent."" is good news.  ""This guy has a fantastic work ethic."" = Charlie Frye redux."
Browns,35hifr,s_s,-17,Mon May 11 12:44:07 2015 UTC,"He can be the single hardest worker in the history of the NFL.  You don't go from ""drunk party guy doing it your own way"" for high school, college and your first year of the pro's to ""professional pro-style QB"" in 4 months.  The whole thing about being an NFL QB is the grind.  Is failing and bouncing back.  Is after watching your hard work not pay off, continuing to work hard and work even harder.  I can show you a million QBs who have ""fantastic"" work ethics in May.  College and the pros are filled with them. For 2 weeks.  Lets see what his work ethic is next may.  And the may after.   It takes years of hard work to be even an adequate consistent NFL QB.  It isn't some flip you switch one day and suddenly you're aaron rodgers.  Lets cross our fingers our team can carry him, but its going to be people like you who expect him to come out like Aaron Rodgers who will be his downfall.  He is easily 2-3 years away from being a competent QB if he really is working hard to change his ways."
Browns,35hifr,djroomba322,14,Sun May 10 12:57:57 2015 UTC,"I don't expect him to be Aaron Rodgers, he can be a mediocre QB and we'll still win a decent amount of games due to the defense we're building."
Browns,35hifr,DayvyT,6,Sun May 10 13:02:32 2015 UTC,Matt Ryan level of performance would be satisfactory to me this season.
Browns,35hifr,djroomba322,-8,Sun May 10 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but a decent to good qb can make this a play off team.  And you want to retard our progress and watch pro bowl caliber talent leave our team year after year as they, professional athletes, see he isn't the guy?"
Browns,35hifr,crookfingerjake,6,Sun May 10 13:22:08 2015 UTC,Do you propose that we give up?
Browns,35hifr,djroomba322,-4,Sun May 10 13:25:47 2015 UTC,"I propose we get a solution at the qb position better than Mccown, Manziel Shaw, and Lewis.  This might be the worst collective talent at the position since our reinception."
Browns,35hifr,firerex,6,Sun May 10 13:32:53 2015 UTC,"Not saying that you're wrong, but with what realistic approach could we do that?"
Browns,35hifr,miked1be,13,Sun May 10 13:39:47 2015 UTC,Guess we should just go to the Aaron Rodgers store and pick up one or two of them.  Can't belive our FO hasn't thought of that yet.
Browns,35hifr,mas277,8,Sun May 10 13:53:26 2015 UTC,The Tom Brady store is cheaper and has more super bowls. Are they open on Sundays?
Browns,35hifr,djroomba322,5,Sun May 10 14:04:17 2015 UTC,Yeah but I heard that they sell underinflated Tom Bradys...
Browns,35hifr,miked1be,-1,Sun May 10 14:10:04 2015 UTC,"Cassel won 10+ games with 2 different teams and was available.   Hoyer won 7 games with this team and he was available.  And you know our line troubles.  Foles and Bradford were all available and all an upgrade.  I feel the price they were asking is much lower than their value, even for 1 year.    Hell, Sanchez could have been acquired.  That right there, barring any sort of Mariota investment, or taking a flyer on a Petty would have gave us a real definitive solution at the QB position this year so we had a chance to win some games.  McCown obviously is much lower talent than all of them.  Hell, this isn't even accounting for QBs like Glennon, which have shown flashes, or any number of other backups that would be a marked improvement.  I mean, we can go to the Rodgers store, sure.  But we've seen the McCown store is the kmart closeout special, and Manziel's store hasn't even finished building yet, it wont even be open for 3 more years.    We had a ton of options."
Browns,35hifr,djroomba322,4,Sun May 10 14:11:00 2015 UTC,"Foles and Bradford were traded for each other (among other things included in the deal) how do you know what the price would have been for the Browns, if their teams would even listen to a deal without a viable QB option.  Also, Bradford's agent represented a few ex Browns QBs and doesn't even want to start talking about an extension so we'd very possibly be spending that for 1 season with him.     I feel the price they were asking is much lower than their value, even for 1 year.   How do you know what the price would have been without a viable QB thrown in with the deal?  You don't.   There's no way Sanchez, Glennon, and Hoyer are obviously much higher talents.   The only viable option I see in your comment that had a decent chance of being a better option is Cassel but we also don't know what all went into the dealings there.   You're talking like any one of these guys could have easily been acquired and the Browns are definitely wrong for not making the deal.  None of these are as easy or as definite a prospect as you're making out."
Browns,35hifr,firerex,-3,Sun May 10 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"Foles and Bradford were traded for each other (among other things included in the deal) how do you know what the price would have been for the Browns, if their teams would even listen to a deal without a viable QB option.   I think, this statement alone just proves we don't have a QB on the team, as any of our QBs would have been viable trade candidates.   But lets play the game.  None of those guys would be off the table if we were willing to pay a little more than market value.   here's no way Sanchez, Glennon, and Hoyer are obviously much higher talents.   That's markedly untrue.  We'll have to agree to disagree.   You're talking like any one of these guys could have easily been acquired and the Browns are definitely wrong for not making the deal. None of these are as easy or as definite a prospect as you're making out.   All of these guys were readily available for practically peanuts and we had the most capspace and picks.  We would have lost a 5th round compensatory pick next year which is why we didnt do it.  Think about that for a second."
Browns,35hifr,BurningBeard24,4,Sun May 10 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"Judgement has to be made on more than wins.   Take Hoyer. Look at Hoyer's interceptions and dropped interceptions. We had a fresh offense with a great run game and virtually no tape on our plan.   If you only look at wins, think about QBs like Rodgers or Brees who struggled at first then found their groove. Honestly I think you're trolling if that's your only metric you look at when judging a QB. It should be the last thing you look at due to stats that matter and their correlation with wins. They are not so polarizing as a win or loss though and can be observed more."

Browns,35hifr,grinny588,0,Sun May 10 13:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not insulting OP.  I'm saying it is exactly that kind of talk that we've seen over and over and over where we have a low to medium talent QB, and when they don't have immediate success, they've rustled the community up into such a fervor, now there is a lynch mob when they don't succeed.  I'm just telling him to have some perspective and be cautious.  Because this is quid pro quo for Browns fans."
Browns,35hifr,djroomba322,6,Sun May 10 13:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, how could you possibly know what it takes to be an NFL QB? I doubt it's any more than me or any other guy in this sub."
Browns,35hifr,grinny588,-2,Sun May 10 15:21:52 2015 UTC,"Well, we have years and years and years and years of very apparent and easily researched data.  And its shown time and time and time again that very specific qualities are required to be an NFL QB and he has very few of these qualities."
Browns,35hifr,Spkk,4,Sun May 10 15:39:58 2015 UTC,So data that's available to everyone? Ok
Browns,35hifr,TapedeckNinja,-1,Sun May 10 15:58:04 2015 UTC,Downvotes are not a disagree button. This comment adds to the discussion. You're spot on; I love to see articles saying Manziel has turned it around. But lets see how he carries it into the season before we say its a done deal.
Browns,35hifr,miked1be,14,Sun May 10 13:44:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I presume that some of the downvotes are of the ""do I really need to see this same rant every time someone posts anything remotely positive about Manziel?"" variety."
Browns,35hifr,Spkk,14,Sun May 10 14:49:14 2015 UTC,"Lets cross our fingers our team can carry him, but its going to be people like you who expect him to come out like Aaron Rodgers who will be his downfall.   The downvotes are generally for stuff like this."
Browns,35hifr,miked1be,2,Sun May 10 13:51:43 2015 UTC,"Its somewhat true though. We have high expectations here in Cleveland. After the Bengals game, I talked with my parents (longtime fans) and they had already written Johnny off. We have to reasonably support the man, and we can't call for his head if things go wrong in the first game.  I understand people disagree with the negativity, but I'm against blanket downvoting just because its one specific user."
Browns,35hifr,djroomba322,9,Sun May 10 13:58:21 2015 UTC,"He could have easily just said ""because of certain fans"" or something but he didn't.  He had to condescendingly loop op in with fans he thinks are causing a lot of our problems.  It's his MO and people are tired of it."
Browns,35hifr,miked1be,2,Sun May 10 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"I personally feel that saying ""because of certain fans"" would have been more insulting to a very specific sect of people.  Segregating them further and making more of a gulf.  Its that type of language that separates us into different ""camps"" and makes us forget we're all Browns fans.  It creates an even greater rift between the gaps, and for someone who's been in the realistic majority the last thing we should be doing is pushing people away saying ""because of certain fans"".  We're ALL a fan base.     That's a pretty shitty MO I know."
Browns,35hifr,djroomba322,5,Sun May 10 14:26:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ""people like you"" way less shitty."
Browns,35hifr,miked1be,-8,Sun May 10 14:30:56 2015 UTC,I agree.  I feel your seems worse.  Unless you're being sarcastic and condescending here.  And in which case that's uncalled for obviously.  I think your post proves how easy it is to be misunderstood.  Thanks for showing that.

I'm pretty sure what he needs to show won't come around until September. Putting oneself in position to succeed and actually succeeding are two very different things.  (B) Did anyone really think his career was so in the shitter that it was over? I mean, trending downward from his draft slot and hype absolutely, but I'm tired of this BS narrative (thanks for that, ESPN) that his career (in Cleveland at least) was essentially over."
Browns,35g82d,droidworkerbee,6,Sun May 10 01:33:29 2015 UTC,"There were a substantial amount of people proclaiming that he would never play meaningful snaps as a starter because he was not capable of playing at that level. These people are the same ones that say ""I hope I am proved wrong"" so that they have a constant story, and will come around when he actually succeeds. They gave up on him and are waiting to un-give up on him. Spineless I say."

You can't give up if you never gave in to begin with. It is well documented that I wanted Bridgewater or Manziel based upon which direction the team wanted to go. Bridgewater was pro-ready with question marks, and Manziel was a project with question marks."
Browns,35g82d,nizule,-10,Sun May 10 03:46:44 2015 UTC,So who should we of taken?   Bridgewater would be lying dead at the bottom of Lake Erie for his 12 interceptions.
Browns,35g82d,740Buckeye,7,Sun May 10 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wanted Bortles.    Also, it's have, not of."
Browns,35g82d,rsipp512,-12,Sun May 10 02:27:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I forgot that you were my English professor. Thanks senpai.   Any quarterback that we would of drafted last year woulda been fucked."
Browns,35g82d,740Buckeye,4,Sun May 10 03:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would have taken Bridgewater. I also wouldn't have traded down to get Gilbert. I would have stayed @ 3 and got Watkins. That would have been a nice combo. Oh well. Would have, should have, could have."
Browns,35g82d,TheHungryHeathen,4,Sun May 10 02:37:30 2015 UTC,All seems like hindsight to me

Browns,35g82d,TheHungryHeathen,1 point,Sun May 10 04:19:43 2015 UTC,"I would have stayed @ 3 and got Watkins.   It was #4, not 3.  You would also be down both Cameron Erving & Ibraheim Campbell in your scenario.    As much as it sucks to have to wait, unless the guys the Browns picked conclusively flame out in the next year, you have to give them a few years to see if they can reach their potential."
Browns,35g82d,TopHatAbobo,1 point,Sun May 10 14:12:21 2015 UTC,My mistake. It was 4. That was too many beers ago.
Browns,35g82d,TheHungryHeathen,-1,Sun May 10 14:57:18 2015 UTC,Take the sure pick in Watkins at 4 and BPA at 26 which would never be manziel.
Browns,35g82d,djroomba322,3,Sun May 10 02:52:26 2015 UTC,4 picks for a wide receiver? You do that every time
Browns,35g82d,SaigonOSU,1 point,Sun May 10 03:21:53 2015 UTC,"It wasn't 4 picks for a receiver. Buf has a 10 year top 10 guy now.   That was the safest pick in the draft.  Really high ceiling.   We gave it up for the hope of magic beans.  Literally no GM would give up Watkins for Gilbert, Manziel and Erving."
Browns,35g82d,djroomba322,1 point,Sun May 10 12:11:26 2015 UTC,"At this point in time, probably, but at the time of the trade, you'd be crazy not to take that, especially when it's Buffalo and their 1st in likely to be high.   Not to mention wasting 1st round picks on WRs is lolworthy"
Browns,35g82d,SaigonOSU,2,Sun May 10 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"If Gilbert produces even averagely this year, the trade is well worth it.  3 starters for 1, seems like a decent tradeoff to me."
Browns,35g82d,740Buckeye,-2,Sun May 10 03:20:47 2015 UTC,"Literally, if we passed on both first round picks last year, we would have been a better team.  Don't try to sell this as a 3 for 1 trade."
Browns,35g82d,djroomba322,4,Sun May 10 03:27:21 2015 UTC,"Except it very well has the potential to be a 3 for 1 trade...  By all accounts, Manziel is taking all the right steps in order to be a productive member of the team.   Gilbert has apparently been training and being mentored by Joe Haden.   Erving has the ability to be a disruptive force on the line, and Ibraheim Campbell can potentially fill in the void when Witner retires."
Browns,35g82d,740Buckeye,-2,Sun May 10 03:45:05 2015 UTC,"Let's slow the role here.  Erving talent looks OK, but he's a utility guy who's never played a snap.  Manziel took 400 steps backwards, and 20 steps forwards.  And once he gets back those 380 steps, he's still 1000 steps behind the other rookies.  I don't see how training with Joe haden means he's going to be good. It can't hurt but if that's all it took, every cb the last 7 years would be amazing.  He has shown nothing in terms of improvement or even wanting to get better as he trained in the off season last year for rookie otas.  Watkins has already shown with poor to average qb play he is going to at worst be a consistent quality top receiver in this league.  You can maybe make an argument for switching, but with the knowledge of hindsight, 32/32 GMs take Watkins and it's not remotely close."
Browns,35g82d,djroomba322,2,Sun May 10 04:22:26 2015 UTC,"Or we could of taken Kelvin Benjamin, Jordan Matthews, or Allen Hurns.   Watkins is good, but he also had a major slump last season...product of the QB? Maybe."
Browns,35g82d,740Buckeye,2,Sun May 10 04:34:27 2015 UTC,"To answer b, if he didn't get his shit together, then yes, I would have said he managed to blow his chance in Cleveland. Maybe someone else goes out on a limb, but he was on thin ice here without a change in attitude and work ethic."
Browns,35g82d,R101C,2,Sun May 10 02:39:23 2015 UTC,He played like 1 game with a giant hole in the offensive line.
Browns,35g82d,bluntmasterflash,4,Sun May 10 05:10:27 2015 UTC,His attitude and immaturity coupled with that alcohol problem would have ended it here. Not the hole in the o line.
Browns,35g82d,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,1 point,Sun May 10 05:34:55 2015 UTC,"The line of coke was a greater issue than the o line. That's all I'm getting at. A qb can't be gronk. A wr can, a DE can, a te can. A qb can't be."
Browns,35g82d,R101C,2,Sun May 10 12:03:10 2015 UTC,"If you wanted to open a discussion about Manziel just listen to the local sports radio.    Young Learning People change slowly Addictions are not won or lost, it's a constant battle.    All in all, he's a good bet. Now with a better chance to start, we could what real goals are on the check list and how tenacious he really is.   Best part is, give Cleveland 2 wins for a season start with John. 2 and 0, instant forgiveness  and I'll worship the ground he walks on."
Browns,35g82d,blualpha,2,Sun May 10 05:43:57 2015 UTC,"Here's a YouTube link to the comments Pettine made yesterday: https://youtu.be/5R63Kz3TbrQ  Note that Pettine stated that there's ""plenty of time before the start of the season"" and that he wants Johnny to have horse-blinders on and focus. MKC took this interview to literally mean that JFF was hereby shutdown and would have no chance to start. My opinion on this is that for right now, proven experience by McCown places him at number 1 ahead of rookies and Manziel. This is the logical choice. Nowhere did I hear that Johnny wouldn't get a shot. I think that if JFF outplays McCown by any measurable amount this preseason, Pettine starts him.  Anyway, if you see an article citing MKC, or saying that Manziel has no shot, it's based off of this interview."
Browns,35g82d,blackedout,6,Sun May 10 01:48:37 2015 UTC,If Johnny had no shot he would've been cut or traded already. Of course he has a shot. That's just absurd for anyone to say otherwise.

Browns,35g82d,MuadD1b,0,Mon May 11 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"So, realistically, can they play McCown most of the season, fall out of playoff contention in early November, give JF 6 +/- weeks at the helm, then still draft a qb next year? Seems possible, I mean, unless JF wins 4 of 6 and plays inspired football. Pettine says he likes competition at all positions. We know McCown is short on years. Thoughts? I guess this is how I can see them justifying playing McCown to start, if they see him as the best chance to win games. Meanwhile, JF has more time to grow up and learn."
Browns,35g82d,R101C,3,Sun May 10 02:30:22 2015 UTC,"Whoever looks the best in camp and preseason is the starter. Like you said, the guy giving us the best chance to win is on the field. Its to be determined at this point. I honestly hope they start manziel. He is floor is lower but his ceiling is higher. We are going to be a run first offense no matter who is back there. Either have situation to thrive in imo. Their job is to not lose the game."
Browns,35gdhs,PrimeTimeHoyer,11,Sun May 10 02:23:21 2015 UTC,This is a new style of helmet from Ridell. It has a section in the front that is flexible to disperse impact through the whole helmet rather than one point in hopes to reduce concussions. Many college players wore them last year. Ex: Ezekiel Elliot.
Browns,35gdhs,hambone21,4,Sun May 10 02:56:25 2015 UTC,It is the same style Eddie Lacy wore that didn't prevent a concussion last season. I know Billy Winn wore one during OTAs last year but don't remember if he kept it all year
Browns,35gdhs,MasterPooBlaster,2,Sun May 10 13:04:56 2015 UTC,Ridell definitely makes the coolest helmets

Browns,35gdhs,browndogey,3,Mon May 11 05:13:24 2015 UTC,"Each player can choose whichever helmet style they prefer. UDFAs could pick this helmet style if they wanted, however most rookies have their old schools send all their pad and helmet information to the pro team so they have the exact same set up as they had in college."
Browns,35gdhs,MasterPooBlaster,2,Sun May 10 03:34:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe since he's signed his contract he gets to have a custom new styled helmet instead of the generic ones everyone else gets?  Either way I think it looks great, and would love it if the rest of the team adopted this style as well."

I actually had to send one of my jerseys back because fed ex ran over the thing and ruined the rubber numbers.

Too bad the guy that owned a few of the stores in NE Ohio got divorced. He closed up his stores so his wife wouldn't get them in the divorce (or to liquidate assets to make the division of money easier, not sure).  Now if I want Donatos I have to travel to Parma or Lakewood. :("

Browns,35ee2y,Fzero124,-1,Sun May 10 00:56:22 2015 UTC,WHEW   Meh. With the depth we just drafted Kitchen will be lucky to sniff the field this year. He isn't thaaaat good.
Browns,35ee2y,Daviroth,8,Sat May 9 17:21:19 2015 UTC,Pettine actually said he's looking for Kitch to step up during this year. Obviously Feast Mode will be our main guy at 3/NT with Uncle Phil going likely to a 5 technique. It doesn't seem that far-fetched that Kitch will see a fair bit of playing time depending on injuries and the scheme.
Browns,35ee2y,thelastoneusaw,1 point,Sat May 9 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"They just said earlier in the offseason that Taylor was going back to NT. Taylor, Shelton, Starks/Cooper will all be in front of Kitchen. Kitchen will be lucky to be the third NT on the depth chart."
Browns,35ee2y,Daviroth,2,Sat May 9 22:28:28 2015 UTC,Cooper? Nope. Starks? Doubtful. Shelton? He'll likely be playing end opposite Desmond Bryant. I see Ish being the #2 or 3 NT on the depth chart easily.
Browns,35ee2y,Doyle524,0,Sat May 9 23:16:12 2015 UTC,You are delusional. You think Shelton is gonna play anything but pure NT? Lol.
Browns,35ee2y,Daviroth,2,Sun May 10 02:37:28 2015 UTC,"Shelton was projected to not be the best anchor, but a guy who can play 3-4 DE or 4-3 DT at an extremely high level. I don't doubt that he can anchor a line, and he will see time at the nose, but I think he starts at the end."

Gooddell came out with a statement where he said that Farmer's actions may have violated a rule, but did not give the team any undue advantage. As such, he was punished for breaking the rule, not for cheating.   So if you wanna be suuuuuuper technical, he didn't cheat. Realistically though, an argument can be made either way."

Browns,35bt68,jacksonbarrett,1 point,Sat May 9 02:09:35 2015 UTC,Sure they cheated but in this instance in this game in likely had no effect on the outcome
Browns,35bt68,oshkoshthejosh,2,Sat May 9 05:52:26 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean they shouldn't be punished for it. Cheating ruins the game of football IMO.
Browns,35bt68,ErroneousOnAllCounts,2,Sat May 9 06:20:23 2015 UTC,"There was a great article on this (I believe on NFL.com) where they posited: Would Brady still be an amazing QB without deflated balls? Of course. Would the Pats still have won that game? Probably. If the NFL tests every ball they put in Tom Brady's hands before the play starts, will the Pats still be a playoff team? Almost certainly.   The real problem is that when everyone in the league is playing by a set of rules and someone(s) decides that those rules don't apply to them anymore, it ruins the spirit of the game and nobody wants to watch anymore because it's not sport."
Browns,35bt68,oshkoshthejosh,1 point,Sun May 10 11:43:37 2015 UTC,I wouldn't exactly say it was cheating either if he had said it over the PA system it'd be breaking the same rules.

Browns,35bklw,cleveland_14,8,Fri May 8 21:35:27 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

Browns,35bfed,djroomba322,6,Fri May 8 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"Goodell, who was reluctant to provide any specifics on the investigation, said that Troy Vincent is handling the probe. While Farmer and the Browns did not seek or gain a competitive advantage, Goodell made it clear that rules are rules and they will be enforced.  “There of course are mitigating factors that you have to consider,” Goodell said, “but the violation of the rule and the integrity of that rule is not necessarily whether you got an advantage or not, it’s the fact that you broke a rule. And that’s a more general comment and we don’t want anyone breaking the rules. The 32 clubs want to be operating under the same rules.”   http://cleveland.cbslocal.com/2015/03/25/roger-goodell-on-ray-farmer-texts-we-dont-want-anyone-breaking-the-rules/"
Browns,35bfed,TapedeckNinja,3,Fri May 8 19:15:15 2015 UTC,"FTA:   League officials visited the Browns facility in January to seek details on the electronic communications that took place last season. Farmer said that his phone was not confiscated or looked at.   So Troy asked Ray, and Ray gave him a story, and they never looked beyond that.  Not saying that isn't what really happened, but its better for everyone involved to not look too deep into it. Because all that's going to do is make Ray, the Browns, and the NFL look worse.  And it can all go away with a very reasonable story.  Ray's story is more than likely the truth of it, but the fact they didn't look into it (or did and kept it on the hush hush) makes it suspicious."
Browns,35bfed,djroomba322,2,Fri May 8 19:33:28 2015 UTC,"Well, look at the Wells report – the league doesn't really have the authority to confiscate or look at people's personal phones. (The Patriots employees' texts quoted in the report were work phones.) So the only option is the more old-fashioned method of asking everyone what happened and seeing if their stories lined up.  I agree that the league had no incentive to look into it very closely, but the part you quoted on its own isn't that meaningful."
Browns,35bfed,ArcadeNineFire,2,Fri May 8 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"I'd guess that they have the messages that Shanahan received, though, although I don't know that for sure."
Browns,35bfed,TapedeckNinja,5,Fri May 8 19:40:12 2015 UTC,I don't need one. There is no way that a text from the GM could have given a competitive advantage. Think about it for just one second. What could he have possibly texted that was secret or advantageous that the coaches couldn't have known or possessed that only the GM would have had that would have been anything other than opinions based on Ray's observation on the field.
Browns,35bfed,ErroneousOnAllCounts,1 point,Fri May 8 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"And couldn't he just pick up the official communication device or walk down to the field, anyway?"
Browns,35bfed,TapedeckNinja,-1,Fri May 8 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"He could have easily seen better formations, or that a player was hurt, or that he saw something on tv live feed, or a player on the opposing sidelines working an injury hidden at the back of their sidelines, or that the corner is turning his hips the wrong way on the out every time, or that player X would help them in situation Y.    This is literally why they have offensive coordinators in their pressbox up top.  If Farmer has football experience (which he obviously does), I don't see why its too hard to fathom him giving actual useful information."
Browns,35bfed,djroomba322,3,Fri May 8 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"As much as everyone in this sub seems to hate you, this is a great point. Being able to discover one vulnerable but inconspicuous aspect of the opposing team can make a huge impact on the game."
Browns,35bfed,SwissItalianStallion,1 point,Fri May 8 19:43:48 2015 UTC,"That information is not exclusive. That is information that anyone who paid money to sit in a press box can obtain. That's not a competitive advantage are you dense? If he is that good at picking up on the nuances of a football game he would either be a coach or a coordinator. Maybe he is that smart. But that still doesnt mean that he observed something and passed it along is a competitive advantage. Every team has the ability to hire Coaches and Staff. you defined their job description. So if someone is giving out free information during a game that's not a competitive advantage. It just so happens that GM's arent allowed to communicate with the team during the game. So he broke the rule, but its not like he has a superpower to read the opposing teams playbook that a coordinator or staff member doesnt have so he isnt giving them some kind of cheating edge like steroids or equipment manipulation or paying off the refs. This is not cheating this is some guy that thinks he knows more shit than his staff trying to tell them how stupid he thinks they are."
Browns,35bfed,ErroneousOnAllCounts,3,Fri May 8 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"That is information that anyone who paid money to sit in a press box can obtain.    They don't all have phones directly to the field though.  So, I'm not dense.   This is not cheating this is some guy that thinks he knows more shit than his staff trying to tell them how stupid he thinks they are.   Which is obviously not a good thing either.  But he definitely could give a competitive advantage."
Browns,35bfed,djroomba322,-2,Fri May 8 20:57:33 2015 UTC,I love how the article doesn't understand the difference between breaking the rules to achieve a competitive advantage (cheating)   You mean like Joe Haden? I wonder how much respect Pettine would say he lost for him?

Browns,35b5fh,Doyle524,10,Sun May 10 00:27:18 2015 UTC,"For those curious on the WR's, here's what (little) I could find:  Paul Browning: Comes from a school I didn't know existed (Colorado State-Pueblo). Good size at least (6'2"", 218). He played 12 games, with 11 TD's, and averaged a little under 100 yards a game. Albeit against less than stellar talent.  Jabari Carr: Nothing about this guy screams any talent, unless he's injury riddled, and even then. He never broke 650 yards in any season, and ended his career at SJS with less than 12 TD's. Not a good size, I doubt he makes it out of camp.  Nic Demski: He's Canadian, and was apparently a big prospect for the CFL draft, rated in the top 25; he may still go high to the Alouettes or Blue Bombers if all plays out. At 6'0"" and 215, maaaaaybe there's something there? Or maybe he can just bring us Moosehead?  Christian Green: Had a burial on the depth chart at FSU it seems, and in 2014 only got 120 yards total. He worked out with a few teams and was considered a high target in FA, but that weight under 200 considering his size worries me.  Sedrick Harris: I see absolutely nothing on this dude. Might be in the CFL draft, might not, no clue.  Darius Jennings: A KR specialist at UVA. His size confirms this. Beyond such, dude seems to be capable of big plays: averaged around 19 yards per catch. Maybe a diamond in the rough if he puts on some muscle?  Nick Jones: Playing in the SEC gets some respect points. Another guy who didn't appear to do much in college but could be dynamic with a chance; just really, really small is all.  Kevonte Martin-Manley: Insert name joke here. From Iowa, so he's a bruiser, but was primarily a punt returner. Okay size though.  Kyle Prater: Okay, here's the name of interest. Prater left USC to be closer to home, and although his numbers were unimpressive at Northwestern, the dude is big and long; 6'5"", 231. With some coaching, I could see him coming out of camp and being in contention for the roster; let's see what he does.  Demarco Robinson: Nothing special, and another really light dude under 6'0"". I actually saw him watching a bit of a UK game and iirc, I didn't see anything special from him at the time. Not holding my breath here.  Jedarius Williams: I see nothing on this dude either, but holy shit, 5'5""? On the one hand, 5'5""?! On the other hand, 5'5""?! I'm taller than this guy!  VERDICT: Look at Kyle Prater and Paul Browning for size guys; Nic Demski and Darius Jennings for potential diamonds in the rough."

Browns,35aci0,Fakespeedbump,3,Fri May 8 13:33:40 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  I'm guessing Thomas in the top 20, Haden in the top 50, and  Gipson near the bottom, 70-100.  Bitonio might deserve to just barely crack the top 100, but I don't know if there's enough awareness of him among the other players."
Browns,35aci0,LoLz14,2,Fri May 8 19:49:13 2015 UTC,linemen seem to show up pretty sporadically   let alone guards and right tackles.  If you see an OL it will almost always be a LT or a C.
Browns,35aci0,AnonymousBrownsFan,1 point,Fri May 8 15:30:21 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing, in order of probability,  Thomas, Gibson, Haden, Whitner,   And wildcards/not so probable, again in order of probability  Bitonio, Crowell, Tramon, Kruger, Mack, Hawkins."
Browns,35aci0,NFLVideoConverterBot,2,Fri May 8 15:35:37 2015 UTC,"I think Thomas will be top 15, Haden top  25, and Gipson in the 80s hopefully."

Browns,35c3xr,themitey1,3,Fri May 8 22:04:22 2015 UTC,Alright thanks. It had me really worried.
Browns,35c3xr,rabidpeacock,4,Fri May 8 22:09:45 2015 UTC,"It's moreso just a bold prediction than a rumor.  IMO, we might be able to find some trade value with him rather than just cutting him."
Browns,35c3xr,subhuman1,4,Fri May 8 22:42:15 2015 UTC,"Phil has 1 yr left on his rookie deal. Although I like him both as a player and a person, this is a make or break year for him. He has to play well or he will be cut. I personal wouldn't be surprised if he is not healthy enough to play they release him this year. If he plays well he may be resigned. If they don't need him or he wants too much money he will be gone. Gone diddley gone. Farmer likes his compensation picks. That's how farmer wants to build this team."
Browns,35c3xr,droidworkerbee,3,Fri May 8 23:08:15 2015 UTC,Hard to say.  We're not going to be 9 deep on a 3 man front. I'd LOVE to think the knee is 110% an PT is in phenomenal shape. But if the knee is iffy or he's way overweight...I would better understand picking two DTs in our first few picks.
Browns,35c3xr,subhuman1,2,Fri May 8 22:20:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If you're building a team on competition and he isn't 100%, I could see him getting cut.  But of course that's just speculation, and you and I know exactly as much as silly radio man knows."

Browns,3588fk,Dougdahead,15,Thu May 7 22:42:07 2015 UTC,Hopefully he never works in Cleveland sports media in any facet ever again. He was so negative even when things were going great and super rude and condescending to callers.
Browns,3588fk,Bier_Man,8,Thu May 7 23:50:10 2015 UTC,I thought Bob Golic was gonna throttle him a couple times. I wish someone on tailgate 19 would have slapped the shit outta him

Those topics always bugged me. His blatant disregard to people that didn't agree with me was also off putting  Booms was always for the fan though. I felt like the 2 of them were an awesome compromise. Kiley was the analytical guy, and Booms was the passion. He loved every part of Cleveland and defended it to his death. Their morning show was great in the sense that they could really battle it out each and every morning, and still respect each other greatly and work together on a consistent basis.  He will be missed. But he has said some of the stupidest things Ive ever heard"

Browns,356ifr,BigFatDynamo,28,Fri May 8 01:21:26 2015 UTC,One of the things I hated most about the show was that neither Kiley or Booms would ever let a caller finish their point. They constantly interrupted them and called everyone idiots. I dont think I've ever heard someone call in and not get interrupted. It got annoying so I stopped listening.
Browns,356ifr,madhatter5415,9,Thu May 7 15:34:59 2015 UTC,"it was embarrassing listening to them interview people. Let them talk, they're on YOUR radio show to provide something for YOU."

Browns,356ifr,BoobSacamano,5,Thu May 7 20:01:45 2015 UTC,They had a world war 2 hero on last year and were interrupting him and doing their schtick.  It's beyond awkward and embarrassing that these two represent Clevelalnd to outsiders.    The Boston interview a few weeks ago was the worst though.

Browns,356ifr,JohnStamosBRAH,4,Thu May 7 15:35:50 2015 UTC,So torn on this. No question he should have a drive-time slot (preferably afternoons for me) but his late-night show is outstanding.

He helped Booms start the Phil Taylor debacle a few months ago. He's been constantly slamming David Blatt over every win and every loss. Every morning he basically has now baited the ""Booms gets on Manziel's dick"" segment of the day by consistently claiming that Manziel is terrible even when he has nothing to do with the segment. He originated the stupid ""HAWK"" dumper on anyone who disagrees with him which makes no fucking sense, and now when anyone calls in that isn't a professional, he just yells at them the whole time. He's also dumped people that have agreed with him ffs.  Booms is a far-too-home-to-be-real jackass and an unfunny, annoying dick who gets too caught up in his own ""jokes"". Kiley is a blowhard negative fuck who doesn't actually do analysis and has the world view of a 78 year old conservative cockbag."

Browns,356ifr,JohnStamosBRAH,1 point,Thu May 7 17:51:14 2015 UTC,Mary Kay Cabot is a complete moron and is by faaar the worst beat reporter though so Kiley does have a point.

Browns,356ifr,JoeyCypher,1 point,Thu May 7 19:06:11 2015 UTC,Well I guess I'll be continuing to not listen then.
Browns,356ifr,Marzman315,-4,Fri May 8 02:58:11 2015 UTC,"""racist, misogynistic""  Words that white knight goobers use when they can't handle strong opinions they disagree with. Grow a fucking pair and stop being a professional umbrage taker. People like you are the reason sports has become so feminized and watered down."
Browns,356ifr,JohnnyFire,2,Thu May 7 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"But he's not adding anything to the discussion. If he was giving me a reason why a woman couldn't be a referee, or a reporter, or why Phil Taylor having guns was wrong but Joe Thomas having them wasn't, or didn't go out of his way to vehemently insult not only everyone that came on his goddamned show but the intelligence of his listeners by just shouting over and over and over inane bullshit until it stuck, then fine.  But he doesn't. He's a goon. This isn't about feminizing and watering down sports, it's about him not making any valid argument for or against it, just spouting the bullshit that a conservative 60 year old man would think is something they could share on Facebook. He's an asshole. I could give a fuck about SJW or anti-SJW, who gives two shits? But an asshole is an asshole, and that is that."
Browns,356ifr,lordofallshit,0,Thu May 7 22:39:24 2015 UTC,i fucking LOATHE sjws but i agree kiley is trash

Not even from an lolbrowns or ""put Johnny in"" approach  They just really don't know sports well, ESPECIALLY BASKETBALL.   Can Ken do two shows a day?"

And most of all I'm sad for the fans of the show, because when you're a standup, the reason you get into it is because of the people that go and enjoy what you do. To have this happen, it's rough. I'm grateful for, basically, the four years we had, but this came way out of left field. But I'm an optimist. Onward and upward.   Shut up Booms, you're not even a good standup."
Browns,356ifr,JoeyCypher,3,Thu May 7 16:26:53 2015 UTC,He is a failed comedian. I wish he would stop calling himself that!

Browns,356ifr,Coffees4closers,12,Thu May 7 15:40:19 2015 UTC,It was clearly my email to Andy Roth after the last reddit post about that god awful show..You're welcome Cleveland
Browns,356ifr,Zotmaster,2,Thu May 7 15:22:58 2015 UTC,Nothing yet. My guess is either the almighty ratings number or he broke some business policy somehow.
Browns,356ifr,Resident_Wizard,2,Thu May 7 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"He did make a Junior Seau joke this morning after a shotgun sound. I'm not saying that was it, but I was wondering if that would tick some people off."

Browns,356ifr,Resident_Wizard,1 point,Thu May 7 20:22:12 2015 UTC,I don't know when the dude got fired. I'm assuming it was after the show. I'm sure whatever it was that got him fired was just the straw that broke the camels back.   The guy had a lot of negative opinions of him and I'm sure the many complaints didn't fall on deaf ears.
Browns,356ifr,themitey1,1 point,Thu May 7 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I asked because the tweet is from 7:44am this morning.  Meaning, he either got fired before his show today, or during the show.  Not after."
Browns,356ifr,Resident_Wizard,1 point,Thu May 7 21:00:42 2015 UTC,I was listening at 7:55 this morning when I pulled into work and he was still on air at that time.  Can anyone shed any light on whether or not Chuck Booms finished the show this morning?
Browns,356ifr,pfftYeahRight,2,Thu May 7 21:08:21 2015 UTC,He was there at 9am
Browns,356ifr,JoeyCypher,1 point,Thu May 7 21:38:17 2015 UTC,He was on the entire show. Also did the countdown while still mentioning how many days till HIS spelling bee.
Browns,356ifr,Zotmaster,2,Thu May 7 22:58:59 2015 UTC,"Somehow I forgot about this after hearing it on my drive to work.  He did this during their Ahead or Behind segment.  I dunno if it merits a firing, but now I can't help but wonder."

Browns,356ifr,notgravy,4,Fri May 8 01:38:46 2015 UTC,Hope he got his new teeth paid off beforehand...  the guy was constantly wrong or misinformed or just plain idiotic. Then called everyone else morons and idiots. Ohhh ok. Stopped listening to everything on that station in the time slot EXCEPT for when Coach Sam called in on Monday mornings.
Browns,356ifr,Imperial_Aerosol_Kid,4,Thu May 7 15:40:30 2015 UTC,"I can finally stop listening to Mike & Mike every day.  Nothing against Mike & Mike, but it would be nice to have a local option."

Browns,356ifr,Audient2112,2,Thu May 7 16:35:59 2015 UTC,I'm sorry man.  I understand the love for Kosar.  But I could absolutely not listen to a show of him trying to form a thought during a conversation and inform people of that thought.  Any time something funny would start happening or rolling he would kill the vibe by taking too much time to get out his well thought out responses.  Love the guy.  There is a place for him.  But co-host of a morning drive radio talk show isn't it.
Browns,356ifr,lordofallshit,3,Thu May 7 17:21:02 2015 UTC,This will allow Mr. Booms to devote his energy full time to sniffing Manziel's jock. Happy for them both.

Browns,356ifr,normalism,2,Fri May 8 03:41:38 2015 UTC,"These guys drove me to listen to Mike and Mike on my commute.  The constant bickering was depressing in the morning.  Playful jabs are fine, but these 2 were like an old married couple.  As long as Kiley is on the air the show will still suck.  Booms was the worst, but Kiley still sucks."
Browns,356ifr,marcmiller2007,4,Thu May 7 14:57:16 2015 UTC,THERE  IS  A  GOD
Browns,356ifr,randalflagg,2,Thu May 7 16:38:43 2015 UTC,About time. I can hopefully go back to listening to Cleveland sports in the mornings. I live in Texas and have an hour commute so having Booms on the radio during that commute made me want to drive into oncoming traffic.

Browns,356ifr,wickedshxt,1 point,Thu May 7 18:58:22 2015 UTC,What was the dig? Another one of his borderline racist comments?
Browns,356ifr,Alfndrate,1 point,Thu May 7 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"After the interview, he was like ""nice kid"" or something along those lines kinda sarcastically, then Kylie said something, then Booms was like ""I'll be out in the hallway slicing open my wrists"" or something to that effect.  Sure, it wasn't an amazing interview, but it was probably one of the kid's first, and he did a fine job with it.  Totally unnecessary douche comment, as usual."
Browns,356ifr,Dawgpound88,1 point,Thu May 7 17:09:13 2015 UTC,"His interview probably would have been better if the people talking to him actually knew how to get some decent answers out of a guy by asking the right questions.  Still no reason for Booms to mention slicing his wrists, especially if he claims to be a Cleveland fan. Booms shouldn't be hating on a kid that had NO choice of who picked him. Browns picked him and brought him into the NFL, let him enjoy that moment."

Browns,356ifr,TapedeckNinja,4,Thu May 7 17:51:16 2015 UTC,What did he do to be let go?
Browns,356ifr,JohnStamosBRAH,5,Thu May 7 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"Might be fallout from the Phil Taylor incident.  I haven't seen any confirmation so who knows if he's really gone, and if he is, why it happened."
Browns,356ifr,TapedeckNinja,2,Thu May 7 15:02:14 2015 UTC,What was the Phil Taylor incident?
Browns,356ifr,hatmantc,4,Thu May 7 15:14:05 2015 UTC,"Uncle Phil posted some pictures on his instagram of some big game he'd brought down and the guns he used to do it, and Booms kind of went off the deep end in a way that was perceived by some people to be racist.  More info here and here."
Browns,356ifr,SheppyD,-6,Thu May 7 15:26:37 2015 UTC,His job was to play the heel...he played it well

Browns,356ifr,work_account_duh,10,Thu May 7 15:53:11 2015 UTC,he caused the station to lose listeners. including me.
Browns,356ifr,BoobSacamano,3,Thu May 7 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"yup, i hated having to wait until 9am to hear some local sports takes when Rizzo comes on.  Maybe now i can catch an hour or two."
Browns,356ifr,Resident_Wizard,2,Thu May 7 15:20:08 2015 UTC,"Even when RBS comes on, you're lucky if they talk sports. They're too busy playing country music on AM radio for minimum possible quality, talking about their last or next round of golf, or forcibly shoving twitter down your throat."
Browns,356ifr,Brokewood,2,Thu May 7 15:25:43 2015 UTC,You mean RBC (Really Big Commercial)
Browns,356ifr,hatmantc,10,Thu May 7 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"Then we have different expectations for our radio programs. I want more out of my talk shows than some glorified verbal drama. I want to be informed and I want educated opinions to be debated on the merits of the facts.   I don't want, "" BUUUTT JJJAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHNNNNNNNYYYYYY!!!!!"" ""Fire the bums!"" The sound of people being hung up on simply because they disagree."
Browns,356ifr,TapedeckNinja,-2,Thu May 7 20:07:29 2015 UTC,The thing is they were never an informational morning show..That wasn't their schtick .. They were entertainment /opinion and shock..
Browns,356ifr,moodyfloyd,9,Fri May 8 00:54:53 2015 UTC,"Cleveland doesn't need shock-jock sports radio.  We don't need to be goaded into paying attention to our teams.  I certainly don't wish him ill, but if he really is gone, I'll be happy to give 92.3 another shot in the mornings."
Browns,356ifr,Brokewood,5,Thu May 7 15:15:18 2015 UTC,and those types of morning shows are pure cancer to my ears. hopefully we can get a real morning show instead of ahead or behind and dumbfuck pop quiz.
Browns,356ifr,hatmantc,2,Thu May 7 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"And this is the reason that I, and apparently enough other people, refused to listen to them. A free market economy at work."

Booms would usually say something every hour that was unrealistic and outlandish and Kiley is just the most negative turd of them all.  But that is what made the show interesting. You had 2 guys who had completely opposite thoughts. I'll agree the whole Johnny thing has gotten old, but that is just in sports media all around, not just Kiley&Booms.  If ESPN 850 is smart, they will give Booms his own show. I would listen. The guy really does love Cleveland sports and has our back."

To the point where I'm yelling and just physically getting upset.  And that went on and on until this year I was like, you know what, this isn't worth listening to anymore.  I'm just getting upset every morning instead of enjoying it.  I still listen from time to time, but only realy like mayyyybe once a week to see what outlandish crazy thing they were talking about.  Or I'd tune in when some sports news hits to see what they would say.  But I just couldn't take them any longer."
Browns,356ifr,AnonymousBrownsFan,1 point,Thu May 7 15:48:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely, but if you try to say anything you get downvoted into oblivion.

Browns,356ifr,supaloco,1 point,Thu May 7 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"Why do you say that?  Are Bull's ratings really good or something?  I find him entertaining, but didn't realize that he was so highly regarded."
Browns,356ifr,tomchaney479,1 point,Thu May 7 21:44:24 2015 UTC,"Just because he has a national show really. He's had it for some time now so he must be doing something right (I have no clue about ratings).   But, if it tanks he would probably just stay at the Fan. If it does well, he'll probably have a daily slot nationally. Just pure speculation on my part as, he is the only one on a national platform."
Browns,356ifr,themitey1,1 point,Fri May 8 01:40:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now that you mention it, I have heard him on that national show on weekends.  He's definitely talented, way moreso than Booms."
Browns,356ifr,raw157,1 point,Fri May 8 02:18:04 2015 UTC,I believe he already has like a once a week gig or something nationally.  He's been on his way up for a while.

Browns,356ifr,tooth999,1 point,Thu May 7 20:22:02 2015 UTC,A local morning radio sports personality was fired. He is pretty much universally disliked. Chuck Booms is his name if you are still interested.
Browns,35ayjo,JohnnyFire,21,Fri May 8 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"Sure, but there's no way he gets out of Seattle. Elite, Super Bowl winning QB's do not become free agents and there's no way he gets traded."
Browns,35ayjo,maxpowerway,2,Fri May 8 16:31:01 2015 UTC,Pretty much this. The sense I get out of what the Seahawks are putting out in public is just talk to try and bring the number down. Luck and Wilson are both gonna get paid.
Browns,35ayjo,droidworkerbee,3,Fri May 8 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"Most of the time.  There's always a chance things can change if sides can't agree. I'm not saying it's likely, but it can happen if things go awry."
Browns,35ayjo,maxpowerway,11,Fri May 8 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"It won't because both sides are negotiating. They will find a place somewhere in the middle, likely leaning more toward Wilson's desired figure.   When was the last time an elite, Super Bowl winning QB in his prime tested free agency? Could it happen? Sure, but I could also be drafted by the Browns next year. I could invent the proton pack from the movie Ghostbusters.

I can't put my finger on it, but he's done some things that make me question his head.  Like after the last Superbowl, he was talking like he will be in the Superbowl again next year.  I was shocked at that mentality.  It's like he doesn't get that there is a great change he won't EVER be in that game again.  Talks with him could break down simply because he's not realistic in his understandings?"

Browns,35ayjo,johns602,5,Fri May 8 16:26:57 2015 UTC,We'd be fucking stupid not to. There's no chance he'll get out of Seattle though unless something goes terribly wrong in negotiations.
Browns,35ayjo,djroomba322,3,Fri May 8 16:32:32 2015 UTC,"The cool thing is that if they sign Russel Wilson to anywhere near the money he wants/deserves, it will make it nearly impossible for them to resign Bobby Wagner after this year. If the Browns were able to get him- a dominant MLB who will be a man who makes any defense he is a part of ""GO""- they would have to be considered one of the top defenses in the league hands down."

I mean really, what is any realistic argument?  it isn't arrogant or condescending.  Its an statement of wide eyed wonder.    Its like saying ""Should you stare at the sun for 5 minutes?

Especially since the OP didn't even give a moment's thought to it, or he wouldn't have posted it to begin with, since he couldn't even posit a reason himself.

It gives no insight that wasn't already obvious.  Its like saying ""Blue is a color in the rainbow and is also the color of water"".  Thanks Magic.   But, even though his comment was low effort and unhelpful in furthering the discussion, I didn't respond to it and tell him that.  And cause an off topic issue.

Browns,3582d9,GoofBoy,1 point,Fri May 8 03:00:02 2015 UTC,Think 3rd and 1 blocking TE.  If he shows enough in the passing game he will be a cheap 2nd TE to trot out on short yardage plays.  By all accounts very good high character kid with injury issues.
Browns,3582d9,Dredd_Pirate_Barry,1 point,Fri May 8 04:33:10 2015 UTC,Don't we have 3 or 4 tight ends now? Who's the best receiving threat we have? There's no way we'll roster that many?
Browns,3582d9,GoofBoy,3,Fri May 8 13:18:07 2015 UTC,"Run the ball & stop the run first is what the Browns are concentrating on right now.  This kid fills a roll as a cheap option to augment the TE position group.  He is an able and willing blocker.    This TE class sucked for weapons.  Can't draft what isn't available.  6th round picks are development prospects that pan out at about a 10% rate to become starters, not sure why the angst over the pick.  Very high character kid.  Edit: Farmer is beating the competition at every position drum every chance he gets.  The Browns will cut some good football player this year who will play for other teams.  That is a good thing, means the roster is getting stronger."

He was the better of the two, though I agree they should have just canned the whole show and replaced it with another. Surely someone young and talented is out there looking for a shot."

Sure it would strengthen the morning show, but it would weaken the station as a whole.  I would probably toss on the dude that watches The Bachelor (can't think of his name right now) as a compliment to Kiley. He can roll with being made fun of which I would imagine Kiley doing a ton. I also feel as if he is a bit smarter and can carry the show for when real sports talk occurs.  And after talking about all of this, I really miss being on radio. Granted it was only a high school class (88.9FM, The Alternation for our local folk) but it was still a ton of fun. If you listened from '05-'08 there was a chance you heard me."

Browns,3587cf,kuss51292,8,Fri May 8 01:17:20 2015 UTC,Does anyone have any info on this guy and why he went undrafted?
Browns,3587cf,blackedout,5,Thu May 7 22:50:20 2015 UTC,"He's a hair under 6' and 175 pounds. He's 40 pounds lighter than Johnny, and the same height. Too small, for many teams to consider, unfortunately."
Browns,3587cf,bluepike,3,Thu May 7 22:58:10 2015 UTC,"I recall seeing something on him on SI-MMQB or someplace like that recently. He had the usual hard knock upbringing you see in the stories, but the guy is something like 6'2"" and a buck-75 soaking wet but apparently he has a pretty solid arm. I can't speak for his play at all as I never saw Marshall in action.  EDIT: It was ESPN: http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12723552/marshall-qb-rakeem-cato-refuses-believe-make-2015-nfl-draft"
Browns,3587cf,MUSinfonian,5,Thu May 7 22:52:45 2015 UTC,"Former Marshall student here: Cato is a baller and will get the job done. He's gone through so much in his life that he will not let anybody down. He grew up in a HORRIBLE part of Miami and his mother passed away when he was 13, so he was under the care of his sister until college. Living out of his friend's houses at some times, football was his only escape. He now has two daughters and is one of the Herd's all-time great QB's."

Browns,3587cf,blackedout,1 point,Fri May 8 12:13:13 2015 UTC,"He's slightly under 6' and 178. To compare, Johnny is slightly under 6', but he's 213."
Browns,3587cf,MUSinfonian,1 point,Thu May 7 22:59:41 2015 UTC,Cato is a BEAST. Very mobile QB with a hell of an arm and great accuracy. Only reasons why he went undrafted is because he played in CUSA at Marshall and he is about JFF's height.
Browns,3587cf,dentwreckless,3,Thu May 7 22:53:29 2015 UTC,"On seeing some film, he seems like a really intelligent  football player.  Athletic playmaker.  How's his decision making look, /u/musinfonian"
Browns,3587cf,MUSinfonian,2,Fri May 8 04:16:26 2015 UTC,"He usually gets through his reads well and has great accuracy. He's not a run first QB, but definitely knows how to extend plays with his feet allowing his receivers to get open. Honestly, he plays just like Johnny in the sense of play-style, but he's one of those guys that fully embraces that ""Play Like a Brown"" mentality."
Browns,3587cf,dentwreckless,1 point,Fri May 8 04:23:22 2015 UTC,Do you think that he could perform as a pro at the QB position?
Browns,3587cf,MUSinfonian,2,Fri May 8 05:18:14 2015 UTC,"I may sound extremely biased here, but I think he not only will perform well at the QB position, but he'll excel at the QB position."
Browns,3587cf,dentwreckless,1 point,Fri May 8 05:50:08 2015 UTC,"From what I watched, he's got a good frame for his weight and he's very smart about not taking hits.  Also has a great feel for the side lines."
Browns,3587cf,MUSinfonian,2,Fri May 8 05:57:57 2015 UTC,Definitely. He's got a good head on his shoulders and can get the job done.

Browns,3587cf,StalinOut,1 point,Thu May 7 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"He seems very small, does he have talent though?"
Browns,3587cf,MUSinfonian,3,Fri May 8 00:29:01 2015 UTC,"A shitload of talent. It's like the flak that Johnny got last year for his height. If Cato was about 2-3"" taller, there would be no question to his size."
Browns,3587cf,StalinOut,1 point,Fri May 8 00:31:05 2015 UTC,"Hell Ill give him a shot then, have him compete with Connor for 3rd"
Browns,3587cf,740Buckeye,1 point,Fri May 8 00:55:47 2015 UTC,"Johnny also has about 20 lbs on the kid...  Manziel is listed as 206, Cato is listed at 187...Same height, but Johnny has a bit of a stocky frame. while Cato looks as if he's been starved for a few months."
Browns,3587cf,MUSinfonian,1 point,Fri May 8 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"Right, but I'm just giving a reference to his height as one of the ""takeaways"" to his tangibles. He plays very much like Johnny does and can definitely be a playmaker at QB. Nobody understands how underrated Cato is unless you're a Marshall student/fan."
Browns,3587cf,740Buckeye,2,Fri May 8 03:08:19 2015 UTC,Problem is can his frame take the punishment of playing NFL defenses?
Browns,3587cf,Kylekub,1 point,Fri May 8 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"I respect his entire career, but would the CUSA translate well to the AFC North? I still think Shaw would make a better development QB than Cato."
Browns,3587cf,bgrueyw,2,Fri May 8 11:21:56 2015 UTC,"Why not? Dalton played in the Mountain West, Roethlisberger played in the MAC, and Flacco played in the Colonial Athletic Association(FCS). So baring injury only the Browns could have a starting QB who played in a power 5/AQ conference in the AFC North, assuming Manziel wins the job over McCown."
Browns,3587cf,Kylekub,2,Fri May 8 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"Dalton also led TCU to #2 in the nation at one point. TCU's competition was much stronger than Marshalls, that's no question.   Roethlisberger and Flacco both are over 6'5, 240 pounds. Big, rugged men. Cato is only 6'0 180 after a visit to Cici's Pizza... The AFC North needs durability in its QBs.   Manziel would be our best bet with this sort of development if we are going that route. But, it also makes sense to have an arsenal of like-QBs, so the gameplan doesn't change if the personnel does."
Browns,3587cf,bgrueyw,2,Fri May 8 14:23:33 2015 UTC,"but would the CUSA translate well to the AFC North?   You changed your premise on me.  But I think the question with Cato is does being in an NFL strength and conditioning program allow him to strengthen his body, or is his frame maxed out? If so, he seems to have better arm talent than Shaw, and would be a better dev prospect. Assuming things like durability are equal."
Browns,3587cf,Kylekub,1 point,Fri May 8 15:18:32 2015 UTC,"I guess my point was that Flacco and Roethlisberger are outliers, that just happen to be in the same timeline. Nothing about them are comparable to Cato aside from the sub-power teams.   Looking at the build of the browns, they aren't trying to go for the long ball, or any incredibly powerful throws at all. It seems that theyre relying heavily on the run, then high percentage passes. You don't need someone who can drop a 70 yard bomb in that offense."
Browns,3587cf,grwilkes88,1 point,Fri May 8 17:04:02 2015 UTC,"Being a short, small guy, I'm definitely rooting for him!  Undersized shouldn't be undervalued!"
Browns,3587cf,ChairyCweed,1 point,Fri May 8 13:46:56 2015 UTC,I'd take him over Shaw as our third stringer.
Browns,3587cf,dentwreckless,4,Thu May 7 23:42:59 2015 UTC,Shaw is good. Why would you take Cato over him? Shaw could be as good as Manziel if not better if their rookie performances are any indication.
Browns,3587cf,ChairyCweed,0,Fri May 8 04:13:39 2015 UTC,Shaw will never be good. I'd rather develop somebody than have a third stringer with the ceiling of backup. I wanted Mannion but he went too early.
Browns,3587cf,dentwreckless,1 point,Fri May 8 11:18:58 2015 UTC,I'm not going to start discussing this until I know what you know of Shaw.
Browns,3587cf,ChairyCweed,0,Fri May 8 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"Are we talking about the same guy? The one with the noodle arm? It's not even that he can't throw it deep, he gets no zip on his passes. There is no starter in the league with a worse arm. You develop the guys that have the physical tools, there is nothing to develop with Shaw. The lack of arm strength limits him to a 3rd stringer/camp arm."
Browns,3587cf,dentwreckless,1 point,Fri May 8 18:57:06 2015 UTC,"Does it matter about his work ethic or his decision making? How many people clamored for McCoys noodle arm? I don't even want him as a starter, but I think he could be a capable backup."
Browns,3587cf,ChairyCweed,0,Fri May 8 19:33:41 2015 UTC,I think his ceiling is being a backup but we have McCown and Manziel. I would like to have a high ceiling guy develop for a couple years and Shaw is just taking up room since we have two guys ahead of him.
Browns,3587cf,Kylekub,1 point,Fri May 8 19:45:19 2015 UTC,How is Shaw not developable? Winningest QB in an SEC school history... SEC has trained him better than the CUSA would have trained Cato.  Not that Cato isn't great. People whine about 'the system' all the time - South Carolina has a much more forgiving system in the NFL than Marshall does
Browns,3587cf,ChairyCweed,0,Fri May 8 11:24:27 2015 UTC,"How is he? He will never be a starter because of his arm strength. You develop somebody that has the physical tools, somebody like Tom Savage or Bryce Petty"

Browns,35b2w7,kuss51292,8,Fri May 8 16:52:50 2015 UTC,"That's going j to camp and nothing else. However, I do think starting McCown in the season is a mistake because then you literally just threw that 1st round pick in Manziel away without even letting him go through the growing pins of being a rookie or a new NFL QB."
Browns,35b2w7,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,4,Fri May 8 16:59:35 2015 UTC,Ever think the coaches know more than a random guy on reddit? He has been straight garbage on and off the field by all reports.
Browns,35b2w7,Mike_Shanahan,2,Fri May 8 18:44:15 2015 UTC,McCown has been straight garbage for years leading an NFL offense.
Browns,35b2w7,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,2,Fri May 8 19:13:59 2015 UTC,And yet has been in the league this long. He's not great or good but he could very easily beat out Johnny.

Browns,35b2w7,Mike_Shanahan,3,Fri May 8 19:32:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, yeah, he has had one good stretch (not a year) in the NFL. I fully expect JFF to start."
Browns,35b2w7,The-OneAnd-Only,0,Fri May 8 19:55:30 2015 UTC,We let him go through growing pains. He couldn't be bothered to show up for meetings or learn the playbook. If his ass is sitting in year two it is 1000% his own fault.
Browns,35b2w7,Deadleggg,3,Sat May 9 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"I see this as more as just keeping the media away, unlike last year where there were cameras everywhere watching to see who won the QB battle between Hoyer and Manziel. Now with the Manziel's situation I think Pettine is trying to make sure there's as little distractions as possible."
Browns,35b2w7,rdpcatfan,10,Fri May 8 17:18:42 2015 UTC,Oooooo guys I have something to say! Now hear me out because this may be a bit radical but....camp hasn't started yet lets wait and see what happens.

Browns,35b2w7,maxpowerway,6,Sat May 9 15:25:34 2015 UTC,"Look, this is going to change, but here's my stance on this: start Manziel.  If we're really screwed, you gain nothing out of starting McCown. He was signed for backup money, to be a backup. The dude has never been able to string together more than a few appearances where he looks like a long term starter, and now he's too old to ever be that. If he does well, who cares, he's not going to be a viable starter anymore. If he sucks, derp, we knew this.  But again, if we're as screwed as some people say, you have to start Manziel. You need to at least see what the fuck you've got. ""BUT BUT BUT BUT HE SUCKED AND HE WAS A DRUNK AND HE DIDN'T CARE"" It was three games. Yes, he played poor. Yes, he had issues. But you have to get some value out of all of this. More than likely we don't. More than likely Manziel sucks. What if he doesn't? What if he got serious? I doubt he does, but fuck man, if the mentality is going to be that the offense is currently incomplete, why not throw the wildcard out there? This isn't like last year where we felt Hoyer was good enough to get us where we needed to go; we don't know who's good enough or where the hell we're going. Most people are thinking we're about to go waaaay down as it is.  If McCown does earn the starting job, fine. Great. But if you even think Manziel has some shot, a .01% chance of being a starting-caliber QB in the NFL, you've at least got to give the kid some kind of chance. If he fails, fine. We fucked it. He sucked. If he does well...then maybe you have some things to think about."
Browns,35b2w7,JohnnyFire,2,Fri May 8 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"I'm confident that the front office thinks what you and me are thinking. As long as Manziel looks somewhat ready to be an NFL starter, he's gonna start. Like you said, they need to see how he pans out to know whether he's worth keeping or worth throwing away.  For what it's worth, I think his attitude and work ethic will make Pettine and co. confident in starting him week 1. Will he be good, idk, lets hope.  I also hope they give him the majority of the starting reps when training camp starts if they do intend throwing him out week 1. I don't want the same situation as last year where they go 50/50 throughout training camp / preseason then decide"
Browns,35b2w7,Godszn,1 point,Fri May 8 18:32:02 2015 UTC,"They didn't go 50/50. It was more 90/10 for hoyer.   Then it was, well give it to brian cause he had more practice with the 1's."
Browns,35b2w7,stangstang,1 point,Fri May 8 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"Ya you're right. It wasn't quite 50/50, but I don't think it was as extreme as 90/10. Anyway, it definitely should have been more unanimous imo. Pick a guy and give him 100% of the reps for max preparation heading to wk1"

In all honesty, I think it's johnny's job to lose, but we are paying mccown a shit ton of money for what has seemingly been mediocrity. Trust in Pettine to put the best man out there."
Browns,35b2w7,SuperPoop,2,Fri May 8 17:24:46 2015 UTC,It's almost like the season starts in 4 months and that's a long ass time.
Browns,35b2w7,TrueSol,2,Fri May 8 17:34:17 2015 UTC,"He could very well just be trying to mitigate the ""QB competition"" media circus.  Bring them into camp, watch them practice, name a starter.  Don't call it a QB competition, don't talk about either of them being ahead of the other, etc.  McCown is the vet right now and easy to say is the starter for now with minimal controversy."
Browns,35b2w7,miked1be,5,Fri May 8 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Look at our picks, look at our staff, and then tell me with a straight face that you're not playing Manziel.   Kevin O'Connell was Johnny's pre-draft mentor.   We picked up some VERY physical receivers who can go after balls and fight. (Mayle is a big target)  We picked up a running back who can catch a pass and block.    We picked up heft on our O-Line.   I know they talked about kicking the run game up a notch, but with a scrambler like Johnny, a good stable of backs who can block, and WRs who can go after the ball, we could really freeze some defenses solid with a pass threat.   The key to this whole thing is balance. We need our offense to be as good as our defense, and our passing game to be as good as our run game. With that balance, we will be very competitive."
Browns,35b2w7,blackedout,2,Fri May 8 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"Damn this season needs to start already, just reading your post gives me Johnny/Browns hype almost as much as last season after the Bills game."

Mayle was the only receiver they drafted, and he was a 4th round pick. The two tight ends are an undersized H-Back and a run blocking specialist."
Browns,35b2w7,Ihateloops,2,Fri May 8 19:53:39 2015 UTC,I believe he's talking about Mayle along with Bowe and Hartline.
Browns,35b2w7,Deadleggg,0,Sat May 9 14:56:21 2015 UTC,"I'm looking not only at Mayle, but UDFA Prater, too. (6'4 225). We're also going into rookie camp with 3 players listed as FB. Bowe isn't exactly tiny, but he's physical, and we picked him up. So, there's 3 bigger guys at WR at least."
Browns,35b2w7,blackedout,1 point,Fri May 8 19:58:40 2015 UTC,"Ah. You said ""look at our picks"" which led me to only think about the draft."
Browns,35b2w7,Ihateloops,1 point,Fri May 8 20:04:44 2015 UTC,Both mayle and prater are not going to be able to come in and play well right away. They do not have the talent to do that.

Browns,35b2w7,buckeyegold,7,Fri May 8 16:57:25 2015 UTC,Or know he has a learning curve with a new OC and system to learn. They are developing him rather than throwing him to the wolves.
Browns,35b2w7,tohearnnr,6,Fri May 8 16:59:39 2015 UTC,Not saying there is no learning curve at all. My point is ever since they drafted him it seems like they never really wanted him.
Browns,35b2w7,buckeyegold,3,Fri May 8 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"I think partly what the players are saying now how he's working harder now, meaning he really has to earn his way to challenge to be a starter type situation"
Browns,35b2w7,tohearnnr,1 point,Fri May 8 17:11:22 2015 UTC,All I'm trying to say is if you want home to mature and evolve you gotta give him meaningful snaps with the faith of the organization behind him.   Putting him in after injury or after the season is finished (last season post colts game) isn't going to do much other than say you're only playing bc we have no other choice.
Browns,35b2w7,buckeyegold,4,Fri May 8 17:23:28 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I feel like the media that comes with Johnny also is holding them back too. If Johnny fails, ESPN will cream their Huggies with the story"
Browns,35b2w7,tohearnnr,3,Fri May 8 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"He didn't do himself any favors last season there is no denying that. But to say in May there will be no competition is just stupid. Not just for Johnny, but to Shaw & Lewis. Closed minded af"

Browns,35b2w7,Deadleggg,0,Sat May 9 14:58:02 2015 UTC,Josh McCown will be our week 1 starter. Thaddeus Lewis will be our backup. Connor Shaw will be our 3rd option. The Browns will give Johnny Manziel time to recover from his demons.

Browns,35b2w7,newsballs,1 point,Fri May 8 18:44:58 2015 UTC,I'm a huge manziel believer but if he can't beat Mccown and Thad my confidence will be hugely shaken.  I say manziel starts week one.
Browns,359fi6,dentwreckless,2,Fri May 8 05:24:49 2015 UTC,wonder if they want to convert him to a safety position
Browns,359fi6,moodyfloyd,1 point,Fri May 8 15:00:11 2015 UTC,I'd say it's more likely they play him as a slot CB when he's healthy.
Browns,359fi6,Dredd_Pirate_Barry,1 point,Fri May 8 15:51:25 2015 UTC,So what's the chance that he clears waivers to go on IR?
Browns,359fi6,BeDoubleYou,1 point,Fri May 8 13:30:41 2015 UTC,He doesn't have to clear waivers if we sign him to the roster and then put him on IR. You don't HAVE to waive a player in order to put them on IR.
Browns,359fi6,IamMcSqueeb,1 point,Fri May 8 13:55:59 2015 UTC,But the tough part is justifying a 53-man spot for him when we could have another young guy that can actually play there instead
Browns,359fi6,BeDoubleYou,1 point,Fri May 8 16:02:53 2015 UTC,"We don't even dress 53 guys a game. I think only 48 are allowed onto the field on Sundays. So one of those guys he's taking a roster spot from probably isn't going to see the field unless there's an emergency anyways.   Sure, he takes the spot of a bubble guy but having too many qualified players to take one roster spot is a good problem to have, it means we'll be flush for years to come."
Browns,359fi6,sginsc,1 point,Fri May 8 16:22:46 2015 UTC,"they could just resign someone once he is on the IR, or sign him and place him on IR before the final rosters are due in August, so there wouldn't be an issue of actually losing a roster spot."
Browns,3580p6,Execrat0r,33,Thu May 7 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"I mean, he's not wrong....  It's not like he insulted the whole team or organization"
Browns,3580p6,jswolfie316,10,Thu May 7 21:47:14 2015 UTC,"I don't care if what he said isn't wrong, Fuck em'."
Browns,3580p6,jswolfie316,12,Thu May 7 21:51:34 2015 UTC,True
Browns,3580p6,TemujinRi,27,Thu May 7 21:54:10 2015 UTC,"Really guys? There's being fans and then there's being assholes. Let's be honest here, Ed Reed was a great football player who's legacy has benefited greatly due to Cleveland quarterbacks. That's not him being an asshole that's just truth. Instead of being haters and dwelling on that past shit, let's all take a moment to recognize that it's Pre-fuckin Pre-season, practice has begun, and all roads in here in Believeland are leading straight to Santa Clara. BROWNS"
Browns,3580p6,Illinois_Jones,11,Thu May 7 22:31:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but fuck him tho"
Browns,3580p6,wickedshxt,6,Fri May 8 01:00:18 2015 UTC,No kidding.  It's not like he's wrong.
Browns,3580p6,bowhunter6274,10,Thu May 7 22:46:12 2015 UTC,"Even though we've been bad since he was in the league, it's really tacky to say something like that."
Browns,3580p6,Back41DayOnly,9,Thu May 7 21:48:14 2015 UTC,Welcome to Baltimore.
Browns,3580p6,Brokewood,5,Thu May 7 22:16:31 2015 UTC,"Don't hate the player, hate our shit for brains owner's games with the FO and coaching staff.  And hate Art Modell... fuck that guy."
Browns,3580p6,Kylekub,5,Fri May 8 01:46:36 2015 UTC,Ed Reed ate us alive his entire career. He's damn well earned the right to say that.
Browns,3580p6,Masterdebater22,5,Fri May 8 11:48:49 2015 UTC,"I don't really get the outrage. Our QB situation has been godawful for the entirety of Reed's career. To be honest, I never had a problem with Ed Reed, he was a great player that we unfortunately had to go toe to toe with all the time.  Off the top of my head I hate a shitload of other players way more than Reed from our division over the last 13 years, including: Consentlessberger, Hines ""Clipping"" Ward, James Harrison, Vontaze Burfict, Chad Johnson, Ray ""Murderer"" Lewis, Ray Rice, Terrell Suggs, and probably a bunch I forgot about. And of those, only Lewis was as dominant at his position as Reed."
Browns,3580p6,jg87iroc,4,Thu May 7 22:53:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a player of his caliber and legacy can say what he damn well pleases. I might be in the minority but I think players like him have earned it."
Browns,3580p6,chris101010,4,Fri May 8 03:10:25 2015 UTC,Why fuck ed reed because he is a hall of fame player and none of our qbs are ?

Browns,356lzd,bmcclure937,9,Thu May 7 15:17:53 2015 UTC,i was so pumped when i saw we drafted him. i thought we might take a risk on him with one of our 4th rounders but to get him in the 7th is huge.
Browns,356lzd,moodyfloyd,8,Thu May 7 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"The problem is his injury is really severe so he may well never play. That said, this is what you do with 6th or 7th rounders. Take chances on injured players who have loads of talent."
Browns,356lzd,shicken684,1 point,Thu May 7 15:39:36 2015 UTC,Loads of talent is an understatement.
Browns,356lzd,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,2,Fri May 8 01:12:30 2015 UTC,"If Ifo comes back next year, we just got our Richard Sherman."

Browns,356lzd,ccavana3,3,Thu May 7 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"Fuck Richard Sherman. I live in Seattle, that guy is so annoying."
Browns,356lzd,getsbuckets,11,Thu May 7 17:12:23 2015 UTC,"I actually like him. He plays the villain, and he know how to market himself."
Browns,356lzd,Masterdebater22,2,Thu May 7 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"He acts pretty nice towards most people. He creates buzz against players he doesn't respect, which gets him in the news. Sherman has had no problem praising others (e.g. Dez Bryant). There's nothing wrong with talking a little trash to opposing players' if you can back it up."
Browns,356lzd,Syia,3,Thu May 7 19:09:52 2015 UTC,Wow. You are the first non Seahawk fan I've heard defend him. And your upvotes show there are more. My mind is blown. I guess it's cause I live in the Seahawk-49ers rivalry area?
Browns,356lzd,getsbuckets,6,Thu May 7 19:08:05 2015 UTC,I mean you live where the circle jerk is strongest so yeah it might skew your view on the issue. I like Sherman too mostly because I don't hear about him every day so he's more of an anti-hero in my mind rather than an annoyance
Browns,356lzd,DrBasedGod,2,Thu May 7 19:14:17 2015 UTC,True. That's a reasonable perspective.
Browns,356lzd,getsbuckets,0,Thu May 7 19:15:56 2015 UTC,"How is he similar to Richard Sherman?  They play completely different styles.  If we are talking about a status, I'd take another Joe Haden than a Richard Sherman any day of the week."
Browns,356lzd,brownsallday,3,Thu May 7 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"I was more implying we got a late round steal that can do well at CB. I love Joe, don't get that twisted."
Browns,356lzd,JohnnyFire,0,Thu May 7 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"Eh, more of a top flight slot corner. Basically what we all thought Skrine should have turned into."
Browns,357jp9,blackedout,19,Thu May 7 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like we're just as quick to call athletes heroes. The American public wants easy dichotomies: black v white, good v evil, democrat v republican, that kind of shit. So any opportunity to present something extreme, no matter which end of the spectrum, will be taken."
Browns,357jp9,DrBasedGod,3,Thu May 7 19:41:03 2015 UTC,Really not much in this opinion piece. Honestly kind of unnecessary. I think sensible people would agree with the sentiment and insensible people would not be prone to change their minds anyway.
Browns,357jp9,pigeon56,3,Thu May 7 21:02:46 2015 UTC,I've said it before but hopefully some of the new rookies coming in (Winston) will take some of the heat off Johnny. The relative obscurity might be a good change of pace for him.
Browns,357jp9,rljohnson21,1 point,Fri May 8 00:04:25 2015 UTC,All of the hate goes away the second he starts winning.
Browns,357jp9,Fred-the-moose,1 point,Fri May 8 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"Opinions aside, I thought that to be a HuffPo writer would require a verbal and grammatical acumen that surpasses what Mr. Petite demonstrated in this article.  For example, end of first paragraph:  ""Stories about people in the public eye matriculate out across the internet like a wildfire even when the story is really not a noteworthy at all.""  The word ""matriculate"" contains the sounds of the word ""trickle"", but the meaning (to formally enroll in a college or university) is completely different.  Besides, ""trickle"" is ""to flow in a small stream"": far from the pace and intensity of a wildfire."

Browns,358erj,Godszn,6,Thu May 7 23:36:31 2015 UTC,Our o-line is also under valued cause the squeelers and rat birds olines are pretty good too.
Browns,358erj,stangstang,6,Fri May 8 01:47:06 2015 UTC,"The Cowboys have the best line in the league. They are very good and very young. Hopefully our's is top 5 this year, but potentially losing Mack at the end of the year will set us back."
Browns,358erj,nizule,6,Fri May 8 00:07:19 2015 UTC,We were easily 2 or 3 before Mack went down.
Browns,358erj,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,1 point,Fri May 8 01:14:44 2015 UTC,"Can't argue with this. Mack,Thomas and Bitonio are all Pro Bowlers for us. The Cowboys also had 3 Pro Bowlers last season..Frederick,Martin and Smith. Doug Free graded out the 8th best RT in the league last year, and La'el Collins would have been a top 10 pick this season if not for a Lemony Snickets.  He was expected to be a beast player for a bad team, I can only imagine how beast he's going to be surrounded by the rest of those guys down there. But we've got the best O-line in the AFC North, maybe the entire entire AFC without injury."
Browns,358erj,TemujinRi,-6,Fri May 8 21:27:20 2015 UTC,Our right side is not good.
Browns,358erj,stangstang,7,Fri May 8 01:04:53 2015 UTC,"Our right side is good but not great.  Erving could make it great, though."

Browns,358erj,Abiv23,1 point,Fri May 8 14:36:48 2015 UTC,"You're right, depth has been a bigger issue. I'll edit my previous statement to say our depth on the right side got a ton better."
Browns,358erj,professor_tappensac,3,Sun May 10 00:10:00 2015 UTC,"Greco's a pretty good guard.  He's been more than solid in the running game, but his pass pro isn't great.  Personally I think Schwartz is the weak link in the line.  He doesn't do anything particularly well."

Browns,357tcv,supaloco,7,Thu May 7 21:05:02 2015 UTC,I really love the Really Big Show and Nathan Zegura. Can't stand Goldhammer but like Golden. Don't listen to any others.
Browns,357tcv,sirporks88,5,Thu May 7 22:58:01 2015 UTC,I have the opportunity to listen to them all at some point during the week due to my schedule.  Here is how i see it:   1.The Really Big Show  2.Ken Carmen  3.CBD  4.The Bull and the Fox  Everyone else is trash
Browns,357tcv,PerfectV,4,Thu May 7 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"Switch Carmen and RBS, and those are my rankings."
Browns,357tcv,nizule,2,Fri May 8 00:08:30 2015 UTC,"What do you like about Bull and the Fox? After listening to Baskin and Phelps, when Bull and Fox come on they sound like a loud mouth and  a blowhard (you can figure which is which) that try to argue points that they aren't even educated about.   There should be a drinking game for how many times Bull says 'uhhhhhhh' you'd be on the floor by 2:30."
Browns,357tcv,JayBird30,1 point,Fri May 8 00:55:34 2015 UTC,"For me, I am more of a football guy than the other sports around town. Baskin and Phelps seem like the baseball/basketball guys, that aren't as knowledgeable about the football aspects.

Browns,357tcv,nizule,1 point,Fri May 8 01:04:44 2015 UTC,"I like Fox better than Bull.  I know fox is straight homer, but i like the fact that he didn't really make it that big in the pros.  He gives some sideways insight into the locker rooms from time to time."

Browns,357tcv,Stowcenter93,3,Fri May 8 04:33:27 2015 UTC,Best: Ken Carman  Tie between: Bull n Fox and Baskin n Phelps  Last: Kiley and Booms but I'll be damned if they were not entertaining. Feel like if you could replace Kiley with a more level headed straight man Booms might do much better.   Whatever. I'm following him on Twitter now. Wish him luck wherever.  I also don't listen to ESPN Cleveland. I don't get a good signal most of the time.

Learning to move on and focus on the next shot has been more than therapeutic for him, he has since used his GI Bill to become a golf pro and has his own academy.

Browns,3560fs,newsballs,2,Thu May 7 12:02:38 2015 UTC,I am so pumped that the brown jerseys have orange stitching. That was the one thing that was holding me back- I absolutely LOVE those things. Thanks for the pictures OP!
Browns,3560fs,sginsc,1 point,Thu May 7 13:17:10 2015 UTC,Has there been a for sure determination on the quality of these? I would like to pick one up.

Browns,3560fs,bowhunter6274,1 point,Thu May 7 12:40:26 2015 UTC,"That reverse side ""3"" looks very different compared to the other numbers. Is it the angle or is it actually different?"
Browns,3560fs,DocMichaels,2,Thu May 7 14:11:25 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about on the white Crowell jersey, it appears somehow they gave it a white drop shadow with brown stitching... Which is the reverse of what it should be and what it is on the other numbers on the jersey. I would wait at least a few months before getting one of these. If you didn't care about stitched or silk screened, and want one right away, get one of the official jerseys. Otherwise wait. The stripe is crooked, at least the orange is off, possibly the brown, and the stitching needs work."
Browns,3560fs,lonewolfman,1 point,Thu May 7 14:34:17 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the reply- thought it was just me on mobile.   I'm happy with my (legit) Haden brown.  Last Legit-ish jersey I got was Hillis, and while that turned out well for the team, it's quality was on point."
Browns,3560fs,DocMichaels,1 point,Thu May 7 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"No problem, I was on mobile when I first saw it, and had the same concern. From what I've seen these aren't worth it, at least yet. From posts during last season they did make some quality knock offs, but these are just too new.    I've been wanting a Haden orange, so I've been paying close attention to aliexpress as details have been coming out. Haden's my favorite player and I only have one of the low tier Reebok's I got for a birthday a couple years back.    I can't really justify a legit on right this moment with the fact that I have three Nike screen prints, having family who works at Marshall's is really nice, in total they cost the normal $100. I also have a stitched Cribbs jersey that I still wear with pride."
Browns,3560fs,lonewolfman,-4,Thu May 7 14:50:37 2015 UTC,Those look awful.  I'll be glad when they finally get shut down by the Feds.  Another knockoff manufacturer down the tubs.

Browns,3560fs,Zyutzey,2,Thu May 7 15:53:00 2015 UTC,"Not wanting to buy an expensive jersey doesn't automatically make people want to buy a cheap one just for the sake of it being cheaper.  I don't want to spend $200-300 but I also don't want to spend $25 or whatever it is if it doesn't look good.  I just won't buy a jersey, people are allowed to criticize products."

Browns,352d6h,PrimeTimeHoyer,8,Wed May 6 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"The real benefit over other forums is Reddit's upvote/downvote quickly segregates quality posts from the shit.

I couldn't resist.  Each time I told this favorite story of mine, I would follow up with - ""Who is your team again?"" and then the clincher, ""Does your fan-base do anything like this?"".  BWAHAHAHAHA!!  Not trying to be an asshole but the looks on their faces says it all - they're fans without a fan-base.  And BROWNS fans - we are the best fucking community out there - period."

It's like boobs, but for the Browns. IMO, It's fun.   Drafts for the Draft just happened. Pabsty sets up Cleveland ex-pats or distant fans with Locals, and regional beers are shared.   IPAs for Opening Day is similar to D4D.   Just some awesome shit."

Browns,352d6h,djroomba322,-28,Thu May 7 00:12:59 2015 UTC,"Observation of someone who has posted here MUCH longer than 3 years:  This place used to be this oasis, so to speak.  We used to be able to have civilized discussions about our team, where both positive and negative comments were enjoyed.  Because we were trying to break it down to the real point.  We were trying to actually understand the situation.  As any sub grows, it loses its ability to actually have conversations, and turns into an echo chamber.    Now its just a shell of its former self.  Where people are allowed to be shouted down if you don't agree, but more importantly if you don't think the Browns are a championship caliber team.  Its filled to the brim with folks who are so ..scared? people with no sense of self worth, they have to fill their own value on the validations of others.  But /r/NFL doesn't respect us!  Now, I see people screaming in /r/NFL if people even hint at making fun of one of the consistently bad teams in the league.  Hell, you can look back at post history, and see people whining about how /r/NFL doesn't give us respect, or how another user tried to get a user banned because he wasn't positive enough.  We're still filled with all kinds of ridiculous things like textgate, our OC quitting, our QB in rehab, asking a QB to come play for us, and him staying on vacation, that people can't laugh at themselves, and take it all so seriously.  Its such a shame.  Because we truly do have a bright future as a team, but this fanbase has frankly become one of the worst in all of sports I've seen.     But anything reminds people here of the awful desert of rude, shitty, arrogant, condescending, pessimistic commentary found all over the rest of the internet, it tends to be universally reviled. And I LOVE this place for that.   Except its not.  Your ""universally reviled"" state is really just a way that you can mercilessly attack those with different opinions.  And you are no exception.  You have an opportunity to turn this place into the shangri la that you seem to think it is, but its partly on you and on all of us to raise the bar.  Do your part.  And the fact this post is getting downvoted really only goes to prove my point."
Browns,352d6h,JohnStamosBRAH,18,Thu May 7 01:37:57 2015 UTC,"You have good points here, and you frequently have good points when you post too. I think there are a couple key reasons why you get the backlash that you do.   First, you seem to always be on the attack. You talk down to people, intentionally or otherwise. You're like a fiery prosecution attorney, only you're arguing with accountants at the water cooler instead of the defense in a courtroom. Nobody really wants a First Take screaming match, and nobody is on trial for their opinions. I understand that you know a lot about the team, lots of people here do. It might be useful to reimagine your approach. I don't see this sub as an echo chamber.   Second, this is as the OP said, one of the best places on the web for Browns talk that isn't incessantly negative. Some of us are just tired of dealing with 15 years of uninterrupted frustration. As you say, there's lots to be excited about right now. It's okay to be a Manziel fan. Even you cannot 100% say he will fail, but it's okay that you think he will. It's also okay for you to post about it. But I see people who feel attacked when you post. That doesn't solve the problems you mention here. It just gets you the reputation that you now have, and eventually booted.   I think your input on this board is valuable. You have a viewpoint that is unique around here. From a content standpoint as someone who comes here to read discussion on my team, I'd be sad to see you go. However, I would rather that than continue to see the vitriol that you and others who reply to you, keep creating. I've stopped posting my opinions as frequently because I'm not interested in a shouting match. I'd rather just talk about the Browns. I think a lot of people are like that. I hope you take this in the way it was meant, as hopefully helpful criticism, instead of a personal attack. At the end of the day, we're all still fans of this team."
Browns,352d6h,djroomba322,-2,Thu May 7 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"You make some fair comments.  But I'm certainly not the first on attack.  I only respond in a ""condescending"" nature to people who have been verbally abusive and attacked me.    I'm tired of dealing with 15 years of uninterrupted frustration.  But don't you feel we should be allowed to say ""Hey, our GM just broke another rule, that's messed up right?""  Shouldn't we be able to discuss that and come to a conclusion that doesn't mean he's the best GM ever?  That's just an example.  I'm ok with you being a Manziel fan.  I personally want him to succeed.  This is the distinction.  These are people I think raised in a Fox News generation, where if you have a narrative and something doesn't fit your narrative you shout them down until they're wrong and shut up.   I am more than happy to change my opinion on him, and would love for him to be a perennial probowler.  But the data we have right now does't support that.  Is that negative? Or is that just a truth we should be allowed to live with.   I don't care about personal reputation.  At least on the internet.  I clearly don't care about karma.  I care about information.  If someone gives false information, and lies to other Browns fans, I would like to see that wrong righted.   And if someone directly calls me names, and shouts me down, and I respond in a condescending manner, I'm the bad guy?  Where are the hordes of people telling them that it isn't cool?  Where are the mods?  The truth is, they would rather side with someone who thinks our team is a 16-0 pie in the sky than someone who's more realistic.  not negative, realistic.  So they only yell at me.  Tell me, you've surely seen a bunch of people harrassing me, and others, calling us names, why hasn' anyone stopped them if this is such a friendly and nice community?"
Browns,352d6h,JohnStamosBRAH,14,Wed May 6 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"But I'm certainly not the first on attack. I only respond in a ""condescending"" nature to people who have been verbally abusive and attacked me.   Because you seem to be losing sight on the issue at hand, I'd like to point out the nature and tone of your commenting in just the last day.   You could not find it huh? That's right, because it didn't happen.  NO. STOP THIS. He questioned PETTINE. Not Shanahan. This is PETTINE's team. ...Stop passing blame, that's so dumb.  Pray tell me, in your infinite wisdom, why did we not put Manziel in earlier?...Are you kidding?.... I'm assuming you've never had a job where you depended on someone else for a paycheck.   and in your own twisted little world...Un-fucking-believable. How do you even justify that?  Funny you even cut out a ton of his other throws from the pocket where he threw it backwards falling off of one foot. Why lie? What's the point?  Its pretty common knowledge from uninformed fans   You really have to understand how this type of an attitude is perceived by other people.  It's condescending, patronizing, and you're baiting people to get into heated arguments with you. You're super aggressive and if anyone disagrees with you about anything, it's your daily mission to prove exactly how wrong they are.  This is not something people like to be around. It's not enjoyable to discuss topics in a manner like that. People do not get off proving they're right in the manner that you do.   And it doesn't matter what screenname you use, or who actually comments like this, because even when you create a new account and continue posting like this, you still get downvoted.  People have have not even identified that it was you yet, they would just downvote the comments because of the aggressive and condescending tone.  So it has nothing to do with it being from you, it has everything to do with your attitude.  Until you recognize that this starts and ends with your behavior, nothing will change. And it's been proven each time you create a new account.  In addition, if you get someone reply to you that you deem to be condescending, then ignore them.  Be a mature adult and just ignore them.  You do not have to ""respond to them in kind"". You do not have some obligation to set the straight. It's not your responsibility to teach them something.  Just. freakin. ignore them.    If you learn to change the tone of your comments and when to pick your 'battles', this will all fix itself.  I guarantee it."
Browns,352d6h,djroomba322,-2,Wed May 6 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"What was said was by people who have attacked me before. They're being completely unreasonable and taking it out of context. The lower quote proves that.  I only responded in that way because of the sheer ridiculousness of this entire sentiment.  It's insanity. Look at the other replies and you'll see why my response was the way it was.  Attacked, by factless biased jerks with agendas."
Browns,352d6h,JohnStamosBRAH,7,Wed May 6 17:09:46 2015 UTC,"Just because someone doesn't have 'facts' or is 'biased' does not mean they're attacking you. Please, for the love of dog, make sure you're aware of that. I hand picked those comments because there was absolutely nothing wrong with the comment you were responding to. One of your comments there was even a top level comment responding to OP! How can you justify that?  You sit here and bitch and moan and complain about how you're being treated and you have an entire group of people telling you whats wrong and all you do is ignore them and tell them they're wrong.  You're an insufferable stubborn person who is never wrong. There is absolutely nothing that we, as mods, can do when you refuse to change your behavior and continue to act in the manner that you do.  Your behavior pokes at the bear, and its not our problem when the bear attacks.  Again, let me make this perfectly clear, change the tone of your comments or nothing will ever change with your experience here. If you can justify your comments up there or think there's nothing wrong with them, then you're on your own."
Browns,352d6h,djroomba322,-3,Wed May 6 20:33:12 2015 UTC,The person I was replying to was and is a notorious offender.
Browns,352d6h,JohnStamosBRAH,9,Wed May 6 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"All you do is have excuses. Man up and take some responsibility in your life. Are you honestly going to sit here and take no blame in this whatsoever?  How can this only happen to you?  How does that happen to you over and over again?  I am telling you, objectively, what you're doing is wrong. Take it, or leave it, but don't you dare bitch at us when that bear bites back."
Browns,352d6h,A_Mann,-2,Wed May 6 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"I've said on multiple posts I'm not blameless.  And I'm more than willing to deescalate the situation , but as you know the mods have said they have no interest in actually moderating.  And I believe the t mod said it was my power to fix the situation.  If they aren't going to do their job then  I'm going to respond to people as they are posting to me.   The only tool I have is to respond to them like they respond to me.  I'm not special. I'm just a guy. If they feel some people are allowed to abuse a user, then I'm going to not take the abuse lying down."
Browns,352d6h,youwithme,11,Wed May 6 22:03:58 2015 UTC,"Check who you're responding to.  I am telling you that the reason why you are getting yourself into these types of situations is because of your tone and your behavior. You are creating the world of problems that you're in and you're escalating further by acting the way you do. Like I state before, this starts and ends with you.  No one has this type of problem, only you, and it's because of your behavior. You ""responding in kind"" is completely childish and you're only stooping to the level of the person you're arguing with.  Be a man and ignore it.  Fighting back in the manner that you do not only makes you look like an immature teenager but it also further escalates the entire issue surrounding you.   And lets make this perfectly clear - My job isn't to follow you around like your babysitting making sure that every single person that you piss off with your shitty attitude plays nicely with you."
Browns,352d6h,djroomba322,4,Wed May 6 22:06:42 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you on this post. It's unfortunate that the situation has spun up to the point that it has and I really don't know what can be done to stop it. I will say that discussions like these probably help.
Browns,352d6h,PizzaThrash,24,Wed May 6 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"From my point of view, you are negative just to be negative. You take light-hearted positive comments and post 4 negative paragraphs about it. And we are taking it too seriously? You just called our fanbase the worst in sports. How to you expect this sub to respond to that? If I were to guess, you aren't even a Browns fan. You are just trying to make us all look bad.   I do agree with some things you said. But this sub circlejerks like every other teams sub. It's not much different anywhere else."
Browns,352d6h,djroomba322,-16,Wed May 6 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"I do agree with some things you said. But this sub circlejerks like every other teams sub. It's not much different anywhere else.   most subs dont have users petitioning to ban other users.  Most subs you don't have to worry about opening the sub and finding some overweight muffin topped chunky girls for 2 months.  I leave the circlejerk posts alone.  In things that seem like an actual discussion is involved, its discussed.  You seem to think I'm negative and I can't understand it.  When Hoyer was playing and doing well I was super positive.  I was super positive about our offense, our coach.  And we got rid of our OC and QB.    Funnily enough, this sub is SUPER NEGATIVE about Hoyer.   Is SUPER NEGATIVE about Shanny.  And I'm the negative one?  There is a groupthink that if you don't follow the groupthink you're considered negative, even if you're not."
Browns,352d6h,PizzaThrash,21,Wed May 6 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"That petition was heavily criticized and removed by the mods within minutes. You deserve to be here same as anyone else. You also deserve to be derided for your condescending, antagonistism and general unpleasantness.  Quit acting like you're the sole voice of reason standing firm against the circle jerk. Being a dick with a different opinion isn't people's problem with you; being a dick is.  Edit: just realized the very post I'm responding to is a perfect example of this. Boobs for Browns is very popular, but you're not the only person who doesn't enjoy it. You are, however, the only person I've seen who criticizes it by insulting the women who take part in it. Poor form."
Browns,352d6h,djroomba322,-10,Wed May 6 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"Funny enough, there was a previous petition put up by a mod.  How interesting is that?  And it failed, just like this one. The problem, again, isn't the majority.  As we can see, the majority are quite alright with my posting and even in the manner of it.  The problem, as I will reiterate, is a small group of like 10 teenagers who shout down anyone who don't agree with them, call them names, are condescending, sarcastic, and just assholes in general.  If we're not 100% on board then we're bad fans.  And most people, are reasonable and just ignore it, or their ideals are in line with them, so they never interact.  I'm slightly less than reasonable, and I refuse to let these jagoffs turn what was once a great sub into /r/gaming and all the other subs who've lost their ability to have conversations.  I'm never ""a dick"" to anyone who wasn't a dick to me first.  And I'm not the sole voice of reason.  That's the whole point.  Can't you see that?"
Browns,352d6h,PizzaThrash,13,Wed May 6 15:44:05 2015 UTC,"So your solution to these dozen or so"" teenagers"" who are sarcastic condescending assholes to people with different opinions than their own is to be a sarcastic condescending asshole to people with different opinions than your own? And that fixes things, how exactly? If there's a silent majority of reasonable people, why add your own voice to the shitflinging rabble simply because you fling a different brand of shit?"
Browns,352d6h,djroomba322,-11,Wed May 6 16:00:49 2015 UTC,"How do I fix it?  What do I do?  The mods explicitly stated time and time again that they'll do something about it, and then never do.  So am I supposed to just have to deal with it for every post in the future?  And that's just how I get to post going forward?  And a new user comes in and wants to talk, and these asshats shout him down, and he leaves.  And the next new user comes, and agrees with these clowns and stays, and now we have ANOTHER one of these?    Because that's exactly what's happened.  And that's whats going to continue to happen.  My voice is only speaking up so that those few bad apples figure it out and see what kind of harm they're doing to this community.  Or what's left of it.  How should I handle it, as someone who has a realistic perspective on the team who's been right about every single decision going back to holmgren, shurmur, richardson, gordon, weeden, etc?  After being shouted down and told I was a fucking retard for ""not supporting"" weeden?    What should I do?"
Browns,352d6h,PizzaThrash,9,Wed May 6 16:15:23 2015 UTC,"I don't have the answers. I'd start by doing the following: rather than tearing into your perceived ideological enemies on the sub, write calmly and without insult on your points; turn the other cheek when the backlash and downvotes come; don't use your past ""being right"" as a shield from criticism, and quit with the self-identification as ""realistic"" or ""reasonable"", as hindsight is 20/20 and it smacks of r/iamverysmart."
Browns,352d6h,fear865,-6,Wed May 6 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is 20/20 but I can link you back posts to 5 years ago where I called it all ebfore it happened.  Tell you what.  for 90% of my post history I already do that.  Don't you feel just a little bit, angry teenagers found someone they're allowed to yell at, so they do.  The same angry people who post angrily everywhere.  Where I only respond in kind to 10% at most.    But I'll take your advice.  It will be interesting to see if other users who notice that will defend a person or not.  My take is no, its never happened.  Well it used to.  But its just another reason why this sub is showing marked decline."
Browns,352d6h,Troop-the-Loop,5,Wed May 6 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, I reiterate that I don't have the answers. I actually quit reddit for a two year stretch because this site has a tendency to breed some seriously toxic communities. If you think the sub is not what you want it to be anymore and can't, or being yelled at online gets too draining, I highly suggest taking a break or even leaving. You don't owe this sub or reddit anything. It's far better to leave a bad place than to end up part of the problem.  For the record, I only came back to reddit to talk sportsball because in real life I'm surrounded by Pats fans."
Browns,352d6h,Fakespeedbump,8,Wed May 6 16:39:15 2015 UTC,Please stop. I'm sure I'm not the only one here but  it was funny the first few days but now it's kinda getting weird. Continue if you will but just throwing out my opinion.
Browns,352d6h,Troop-the-Loop,4,Wed May 6 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"First few days? I've done it twice. Once, the original time, which lasted 2 hours. And once, today, which lasted all of 10 minutes. Like 4 comments.   So don't know what you're talking about with these ""past few days""."
Browns,352d6h,ctnp,-1,Wed May 6 16:51:32 2015 UTC,Just stop.
Browns,352d6h,fear865,3,Wed May 6 16:33:16 2015 UTC,I have already said I would stop. I have not posted since this morning. Your comment is unnecessary and late.
Browns,352d6h,youwithme,5,Wed May 6 16:38:51 2015 UTC,"Hah, I even gilded someone who was a dick to me (called me out by name) and he changed accounts.  We stick together."
Browns,352d6h,Troop-the-Loop,10,Wed May 6 17:00:18 2015 UTC,I refuse to let these jagoffs   Pittsburgh confirmed guys.

Lol  Honestly I think you make this sub more interesting. You're an extreme Devils advocate. But you're still gonna get downvotes and angry responses. I just have a feeling that's what you want, otherwise you wouldn't continue to post here so much."

Browns,352d6h,x2skier,2,Wed May 6 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"Aight, look. I was super positive about our offense with Hoyer and Shanny. I didn't like our drafting Johnny. But when we let Hoyer and Shanny walk, I still held optimism, because the rest of our team, which was quite responsible for our successes, was still here.  We have the #1 or 2 offensive line in the NFL, which makes the QB's job way easier and our running backs look like gods. We have the best secondary in the league, and one of the top defenses overall. We have a QB and a receiving corps who can at least make the easy throws and catches and capitalize on easy opportunities.  The passing game is going to be just the cherry on top of our offense this year. Without it, we still have a perfectly good ice cream sundae."
Browns,352d6h,Troop-the-Loop,13,Wed May 6 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see the same things you do, which is fine.  You've indicated the same.  But we have different perspectives, so live and let live.  I'm not a professional analyst, and my future doesn't ride on the success of the team.  As such, I'm allowed to enjoy the Browns to whatever capacity I deem fit, and it tends to be whatever mindset keeps me from seeing what a monumental waste of time following any sporting passion amounts to, winners and losers alike.  The Browns aren't great, they have real issues.  They aren't the worst, they have big bright spots.  Anticipation abounds across all spectrum!  Let it breathe!"
Browns,352d6h,Marzman315,10,Wed May 6 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised in your 3 years of being on /r/Browns that you haven't tagged all of msh's accounts, because he is our resident troll. Just downvote and move on."

Browns,352d6h,A_Mann,9,Thu May 7 03:49:27 2015 UTC,"I disagree about your assumption the r/nfl does not respect us.  I think they do not respect our team, but ask most people about a Brown's fan and loyalty will definitely be in that definition.  They respect the fans.    My guess is that the downvoting is coming as a part of your wording.  Some of your sentences come across to me as you finding your opinion superior, eg. ""I have been here MUCH longer than four years.""  I am no writer either and much of what I type is easily misconstrued so please do not take this as piling on.  We are all in this together; this is entertainment, not real for us.  If our Browns do win a Super Bowl, do any of our lives really change?  Mine definitely won't with the exception of the hangover I will have on that Monday.  CHEERS!"

Browns,352d6h,A_Mann,3,Wed May 6 16:21:45 2015 UTC,"Except its not.  Your ""universally reviled"" state is really just a way that you can mercilessly attack those with different opinions.  And you are no exception.  You have an opportunity to turn this place into the shangri la that you seem to think it is, but its partly on you and on all of us to raise the bar.  Do your part.   Woah, what's the point of calling me out again? I don't fuck with you. I don't agree with 98% of anything you say, but I don't ""mercilessly attack"" anybody, and I rarely respond to you.  Leave me out of your crusade.   I already think /r/Browns is fine. This thread was borne of my observation of this place, and my assessment is positive.  Why do I need to change anything about a community I already like?"
Browns,352d6h,JohnnyFire,5,Wed May 6 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"Then fucking leave. Make the first positive contribution you've ever made to this community, and fucking disappear from this forum. Literally no one would miss your  ""insight."" Go to /r/steelers, where people share your opinions on the Browns."
Browns,352d6h,djroomba322,-9,Wed May 6 15:45:39 2015 UTC,"There it is.  See?  You're literally proving my point.  You make the single most poignant point to my argument. ""If YOU DONT SAY THINGS I LIKE THEN YOU'RE NOT A FAN, GO TO ANOTHER SUB"".  I hope everyone appreciates the irony, and can see how this is exactly the problem."
Browns,352d6h,A_Mann,14,Wed May 6 16:07:19 2015 UTC,"You're right in your reply to the above poster. I think however that the attitude you're getting is a result of a long history of attacking others. Two wrongs don't really make a right. I don't think it's correct that you're being brigaded, but I also think you can be a real dick sometimes so I don't entirely fault either side. Honestly if I were you, I'd make another account and try again. You can't fix what has happened but you can account for it and move on."
Browns,352d6h,TapedeckNinja,12,Wed May 6 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly if I were you, I'd make another account and try again. You can't fix what has happened but you can account for it and move on.   hes already had like 5 and they never change"

Browns,352d6h,TapedeckNinja,6,Wed May 6 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"Nor what people think of Roombas.  Which is rightly unfair. They're not just for chasing cats, they do well at cleaning apartments, and now nobody is going to give them the time of day :'("
Browns,352d6h,droidworkerbee,-11,Wed May 6 15:56:39 2015 UTC,"Is it that?  Or is that I, as a single user, has been attacked over and over and over unprovoked for so long, that I'm not going to be one to take their crap anymore.  Back when I thought Karma meant something, in another time, the Browns sub actually voted and awarded me with an award at the year end rewards.  Interesting huh?  Back when the sub was actually a discussion, we could have reasonable discussions, and I was the top contributor, more than anyone else.  And its partly my devotion and love of this sub that doesn't allow me to just give it up and let it turn into this shit hole.  So now I defend myself in the same manner to which I'm attacked.  And is it over the top sometimes?  Probably.  And I apologize.  But isn't it funny I'm a perfect poster in every other single sub but its just this one with its grouphate and poor moderation that we have an issue?   you can account for it and move on.   I refuse to let people who shout people down get their way and not let the other side have a voice.  Once the mods decided they weren't interested in moderating the community, I'm going to respond in kind to people. I've had lovely conversations and discussions with non assholes.  But the assholes are going to be treated the way they treat everyone else."
Browns,352d6h,Troop-the-Loop,16,Wed May 6 16:01:15 2015 UTC,You've got a serious persecution complex brought on by negative responses to your negative contributions. I stand by the posts I've made in this thread and hope you find a way to comment without stirring shit up in the future.
Browns,352d6h,wardsac,13,Wed May 6 16:03:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is, we actually have users who follow him around and troll him now, so what I used to see as just perceived persecution and projection is now becoming actual persecution (see the post above yours).  The sad part for me is that other NFL team subs and /r/NFL have taken notice and are talking shit about us now:  http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/34xp26/patriots_releasing_cb_alfonzo_dennard/cqz1zhc?context=10000  One way or the other, it's gone too far.  And I'm not pointing fingers because I know I have been and can be a prick sometimes, too.  But, look at this thread.  I see something new on /r/Browns and I'm like ""nice, 50 comments on this thread already, let's see what's poppin!"" ... and there are three actual top-level comments and the rest is just bickering and finger-pointing."
Browns,352d6h,Troop-the-Loop,-4,Wed May 6 17:43:49 2015 UTC,"But its always been persecution, you just may not have realized it.  And it wasn't as bad before, but once these people realized they could attack people with impunity and without mod intervention, they do it more brazenly and relentlessly.  I know you and I have had our differences of opinion.  I think I grouped you in with the rest of these assholes so for my direct interaction with you I apologize.  You don't have to like me and I don't expect you to, but I do apologize you to you."
Browns,352d6h,wardsac,2,Wed May 6 16:04:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't been active on /r/browns for all that long, so I'm not really familiar with the history and how we got where we are today.  I don't really care, either, and I don't mean that in a rude or dismissive way but rather just that picking at past drama is most definitely not my thing.  For me, half of the fun of Reddit (or any other forum) is in arguing--hopefully, the constructive, well-formed kinds of arguments that lead people (myself included) to learn something new or question their assumptions.  Anyway, thank you for the apology, and I am also sorry for being a dick, for needling you, or piling on with other people in /r/browns.  In some ways this little bit of drama in our sub has turned into an unhealthy obsession and hopefully we can all just let it go and get back to talking about the Browns."

Browns,353tt5,MrHobo,21,Wed May 6 21:41:21 2015 UTC,Might as well put him on IR already. Hopefully he makes a full recovery and can be an asset to us next year.
Browns,353tt5,giannini1222,13,Wed May 6 21:57:18 2015 UTC,That's pretty much what I have heard. He's gonna red shirt this year and hopefully turns back into the player he was before the injury. If we get what could have been a first rd pick as a 7th round pick just by sitting him out a year would be a hell of a steal.
Browns,353tt5,bowhunter6274,7,Wed May 6 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"It'll cost us a roster spot, too."
Browns,353tt5,CGracchus,5,Wed May 6 22:17:26 2015 UTC,See now how does that work? If he's listed on the practice squad someone can snag him up if they wanted? We're forced to use him on the 53?
Browns,353tt5,bowhunter6274,15,Wed May 6 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"I believe he has to be on the roster for one week before going to IR, or else he can be picked up as a waiver claim."
Browns,353tt5,droidworkerbee,6,Wed May 6 22:26:01 2015 UTC,"This and /u/iammoomoo's post together get the full of it.  If we don't want another team picking him up, we have to have him on our 53 man roster to keep some other team from having the chance to snag him."
Browns,353tt5,CGracchus,2,Wed May 6 22:34:23 2015 UTC,"I'm posting from mobile and typed quickly so thank you for understanding what I typed, I was worried I wouldn't make sense."

Browns,353tt5,CGracchus,1 point,Wed May 6 22:53:05 2015 UTC,He might be worth doing that for one week though.  Then we basically put him on IR after a week and swap a practice squad guy to the roster.
Browns,353tt5,themitey1,1 point,Wed May 6 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"As long as we don't get that player poached, I'll be okay with it.  Assuming our 53rd player is an impact one, even on ST where we struggled last year."
Browns,353tt5,CGracchus,1 point,Wed May 6 22:49:26 2015 UTC,Of course.  I think our 53 roaster will be pretty competitive.  So much so that we'll have a few guys that will overflow to the practice squad that we'll really want on the roster.  I'm sure they'll figure it out.
Browns,353tt5,themitey1,2,Wed May 6 23:12:27 2015 UTC,I'm assuming if he gets grabbed as a waiver claim that he then has to go on someone's 53 man roster?
Browns,353tt5,admiralkit,4,Thu May 7 01:15:25 2015 UTC,No if he is placed on IR it doesn't count as a roster spot.
Browns,353tt5,randyc87,3,Wed May 6 22:26:33 2015 UTC,Will need to be active before he can go to IR i think. Just one week.
Browns,353tt5,rsipp512,2,Wed May 6 22:50:21 2015 UTC,really? what if a player gets hurt in preseason? Do you have to wait till after the first game to put him on IR? that doesn't make sense.
Browns,353tt5,dmintz,3,Thu May 7 13:21:43 2015 UTC,"This situation happened last year to the panthers and the pats took a guy designated for IR. unfortunately, if we want to put him on IR he has to be unsigned and clear waivers first so he can be poached before he ever lands on IR. if his progress is good enough he will need to cost us a spot to not take the risk of losing him."
Browns,353tt5,iammoomoo,1 point,Wed May 6 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, he has to make it past the first or second round of cuts to be placed on IR prior to the season so that he can't be snagged.  Or, otherwise, they can just place him on the PUP to start the year and then immediately put him on IR after the sixth week. IIRC, he doesn't use up a roster spot while on the PUP."
Browns,353tt5,VonJaeger,3,Thu May 7 00:57:41 2015 UTC,"I am not positive if we can put him on the PUP list as his injury occurred prior to him being in the NFL. It looks like Marcus Lattimore as well as 3 other 49ers who suffered ACL injuries in college were put on the Active/Non-Football Injury List.  Based on the following link that is what we would have to do, but it seems like it is the route we will go with him ultimately landing on the IR.   http://www.ninersnation.com/2014/7/18/5914295/nfl-pup-list-rules-injured-reserve-nfi-list-rules-49ers-2014"

Browns,353lu9,JohnnyFire,22,Wed May 6 20:41:53 2015 UTC,Dude got fucked over hard.
Browns,353lu9,fear865,3,Wed May 6 20:43:06 2015 UTC,Yeah :( I hope the league comes up with a way to prevent similar things from happening in the future.
Browns,353lu9,bad_master,8,Wed May 6 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how, you can't force a team to draft someone and lots of guys slide hard for seemingly no reason. And in this case it is hard to attribute how much of the slide was caused by the murder of an ex by someone unrelated, and how much was caused by the uncertainty that he/his agent created by threatening to hold out until the 2016 draft."
Browns,353lu9,bgrueyw,7,Wed May 6 21:05:42 2015 UTC,"The league could prevent this either by allowing him into next year's draft or the supplemental draft. A more creative mind than mine could come up with better solutions. It's not without its difficulties, but there are possibilities."
Browns,353lu9,bad_master,4,Wed May 6 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, Set up a supplemental draft this month just for him.  Same rules, you take him in the 1st, you lose a first next year. That would be fair. The only problem is, once you set a precedent like this the NFL will be opening themselves up for god knows how many future lawsuits..."
Browns,353lu9,subhuman1,2,Wed May 6 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"I think he has it pretty good since he can pretty much be a free agent before he gets his rookie contract. He can find a team that will use him like he wants (LT) instead of what he probably should be (G), negotiate pay with actual leverage which rookies don't have, and ultimately pick who he plays for.   He is like a great baseball short stop Cuban defector, he calls the shots and will end up much better than the guys going through the draft."
Browns,353lu9,bearsdriving,2,Wed May 6 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have leverage on pay, but he at least can choose where he plays and have guaranteed money."
Browns,353lu9,bgrueyw,1 point,Wed May 6 23:49:08 2015 UTC,Has the actual supplemental draft already happened? Could he just enter there?
Browns,353lu9,JohnStamosBRAH,1 point,Wed May 6 23:56:46 2015 UTC,Every team just passed him up in 7 rounds of the real draft. Why would anyone spend a 1st round pick on him now?
Browns,353lu9,SnakeLaFleur,2,Thu May 7 12:40:25 2015 UTC,Because at the time of those 7 rounds people were unsure about the murder investigation so they didn't want to spend a high round pick on him.  In the later rounds his agent was saying they were going to try to hold out for next year's draft so teams were wary of drafting him only to have him refuse for a season and they'd have wasted a pick.  Now that he's cleared of charges if he was allowed to enter the supplemental draft he'd be a much more attractive prospect.    TLDR:  Kind of a lot's happened since then.
Browns,353lu9,miked1be,1 point,Thu May 7 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"I get all that, but I don't think any team would spend a 2016 1st round pick on him. You're dealing with an unknown asset there. What if it was the #1 overall pick? It sucks what happened to him, but undrafted free agency is the best thing for him at this point."
Browns,353lu9,SnakeLaFleur,1 point,Thu May 7 14:26:02 2015 UTC,Well they've already said he can't go into the supplemental draft so UDFA is really his only option but it's not a bad one.  He won't get a lot of money at first but he can choose where he goes.
Browns,353lu9,miked1be,12,Thu May 7 14:28:28 2015 UTC,He should be allowed into the supplemental draft
Browns,353lu9,farmerwouldsay,11,Wed May 6 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"This is the only fair solution, really.  I can understand why the NFL doesn't want to set that precedent, but his situation is both extraordinary and unique, and the price he's been forced to pay, too steep."
Browns,353lu9,topper_mango,3,Wed May 6 21:16:48 2015 UTC,"And is even that all that fair? Why should the Buccs be given priority on a player that was draft eligible but didnt take this year? (I'm assuming the Buccs would have the first priority, but whoever it is same argument applies).   EDIT: I guess it's fair in the fact that they would have to use a draft pick and all, but not for the whole who deserves the opportunity to sign the guy."
Browns,353lu9,CBD2032,4,Wed May 6 21:22:40 2015 UTC,"Fair to the player, which in this instance, is more imortant than fair to the teams, I think.  Collins got royally screwed through no fault of his own.  The NFL should go out of its way to fix this."
Browns,353lu9,topper_mango,2,Wed May 6 21:32:15 2015 UTC,"Plus, it's not really fair for 31 teams when one lucky team will get a 1st-round talent on a minimum salary without having to give up any draft picks."
Browns,353lu9,bad_master,1 point,Wed May 6 22:51:42 2015 UTC,And also the opportunity to recruit him.
Browns,353lu9,miked1be,1 point,Thu May 7 13:58:36 2015 UTC,If they did pick him then they would forfeit their first round pick in 2016.  So really he would probably fall to the 2nd round still
Browns,353lu9,Fore_Player,2,Wed May 6 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"According to this the NFLPA refused to allow him to remove his name from the draft, and this tweet has a relevant article in the CBA that is pretty clear he cannot go into the supplemental draft.  So his option is attempt to get into the 2016 draft, which probably requires suing the league. Either way it requires the calculated risk, after a year away from football will he be drafted higher than the 3rd round? If not, he might be better off trying to get a fully guaranteed UDFA contract than waiting a year to make an extra million over the 1st 4 years, because that results in him having to wait an extra 2 years to get a contract extension, which presumably would be worth more than $1M in net value, also it would reduce his financial dependency on his agent, which probably has some value."

Browns,353lu9,ccavana3,4,Wed May 6 21:02:10 2015 UTC,Very little chance that a Tackle who is going to be chasing a contract in a year's time is going to sign with a team that has a seven time All Pro at Left Tackle.  He'll want to play LT this year so he can get paid like a LT next year.
Browns,353lu9,topper_mango,1 point,Wed May 6 21:13:30 2015 UTC,"chasing a contract in a year   Yeah, no. He's locked into his contract for 4 years, or 3 if he wants to be an ERFA at the end of the third year."
Browns,353lu9,Doyle524,1 point,Thu May 7 04:47:53 2015 UTC,"It's 2 for UDFA's, not 3 like drafted rookies if I am not mistaken."
Browns,353lu9,bluepike,1 point,Thu May 7 15:58:04 2015 UTC,"Theoretically the team he signs with could refuse to deal with him until his contract year. I saw an article that said a manjor draw to him would be a team who likes to extend guys early, and it mentioned Dallas or Cinncy as teams that like to lock up guys early. But both would probably be a poor fits because Cincy drafted two tackles to start this years draft, and Dallas signed Smtih to a big extension last year to play LT."

Browns,352rn9,Execrat0r,11,Wed May 6 16:54:11 2015 UTC,"My lord, Hoyer had that low of a completion % WHILE the WRs had that low of a drop %?  That seems almost impossible.  Remember when Hoyer fans were blaming all his bad stats on the WRs not being able to catch? Funny now."
Browns,352rn9,St0ckt0nS,12,Wed May 6 18:45:14 2015 UTC,Hoyers good stats were because the defenders couldn't catch the balls that landed in their hands.
Browns,352rn9,Nightcinder,3,Wed May 6 18:53:29 2015 UTC,I remember Dan LeBatard had a stat on his show one time where someone charted not only INTs but passes that shouldve been INTs and that Hoyers INTs+Dropped INTs was like in the mid-30's.  Everyone on the show was blown away that any NFL QB could be that high.
Browns,352rn9,St0ckt0nS,6,Wed May 6 18:56:07 2015 UTC,You know those plays where the defender drops the ball because he didn't expect it to land in his hands? That's like half of hoyers throws.
Browns,352rn9,Nightcinder,2,Wed May 6 19:05:11 2015 UTC,"http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2015/2014-adjusted-interceptions  Hoyer had something like 7 passes that should've been intercepted but weren't.   The guy started off well to begin the year, but once people got film on him and knew how to shut down the running game - and the play action, by extension - the dude just did not have the accuracy or arm strength to carry the team. That Indianapolis game was one of the worst QB performances a Brown has put out since returning to the league. Absolutely dreadful down the stretch."
Browns,352rn9,VonJaeger,1 point,Thu May 7 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"The run game being shut down had a lot to do with Mack going down, too. Which is why I think either McCown or Johnny can have success this year, even if they show up in 2014 form. It wouldn't be ideal, but the run game should be good, and the defense could easily be dominant, so if we start a QB who can just make the easy throws, like Hoyer could, we'll be fine."
Browns,352rn9,Doyle524,1 point,Thu May 7 03:55:54 2015 UTC,No disagreement here.
Browns,352rn9,VonJaeger,1 point,Thu May 7 05:15:37 2015 UTC,"On that chart Hoyer had 9 INTs that were DROPPED. The stat on LeBatard was all passes that should've been INTs, not just dropped, but thrown to a DB who didn't see it, knocked down when should've been caught, etc.   Factoring in just the dropped INT (which he led the league in) Hoyer had a adjusted INT% of 4.5%. Which is insane and I believe only Stanton had a worse one. Nearly 1 out of every 20 passes were directly in the arms of a defender."
Browns,352rn9,St0ckt0nS,1 point,Thu May 7 04:40:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there were times last year - even early on in the season - where Hoyer got lucky. But he very easily could have had five picks in that Colts game, that's how bad Hoyer was playing."
Browns,352rn9,VonJaeger,1 point,Thu May 7 05:16:15 2015 UTC,Were they?  I don't remember that.  I think most people were blaming it on the inaccuracy of Hoyer.
Browns,352rn9,themitey1,2,Wed May 6 18:48:56 2015 UTC,"I come from TheBrownsBoard Forum. Anyone who liked Hoyer even a little bit (or hated Manziel, plenty of those too) blamed everything Hoyer did wrong on the WRs not being any good."
Browns,352rn9,St0ckt0nS,1 point,Wed May 6 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"Well that's just silly.  I'm not familiar with those forums, is it always that bad there?  I mean, I don't mean to talk bad about them, but that's not a good look."
Browns,352rn9,themitey1,2,Wed May 6 19:19:11 2015 UTC,Yeah. That was the other side of the debate.
Browns,352rn9,firerex,4,Wed May 6 22:11:42 2015 UTC,"This is a great stat line, but it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Our passing offense was troubled last year, to say the least. If we can keep just about the same percentage of drops and decrease the overthrows, under-throws and INTs, we'll be gravy."
Browns,352rn9,PizzaThrash,2,Wed May 6 17:13:53 2015 UTC,Because interceptions don't count as drops.
Browns,352rn9,newsballs,2,Wed May 6 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like we'll regress from this, if only based on the law of averages."
Browns,352rn9,droidworkerbee,2,Wed May 6 20:45:16 2015 UTC,"The law of averages doesn't work in Cleveland.  Each team in the NFL, as of 2015, made the playoffs an average of 3 years ago. (We haven't since 2002, 12 seasons ago.)  Each team won a playoff game an average of 5 years ago. (We haven't since 1994, 17 seasons ago.)   Each team played in the conference championship an average of 10 years ago. (We haven't since 1989, 22 seasons ago.)  Each team has made a super bowl/NFL championship game appearance an average of 17 years ago. (We haven't since 1964, 42 seasons ago.) If you really want to be picky, we also made the 1969 NFL Championship Game, losing to Minnesota, but that game's winner went on to play the AFL champions in Super Bowl IV, so it doesn't count as a true championship game. Besides, it was still 37 seasons ago.  Each team has won a championship an average of 27 years ago. (We haven't since 1964, 42 seasons ago.)  Each team has won their division an average of 5 years ago. (We haven't since 1989, 22 seasons ago. This is the longest division championship drought in the NFL.)  And this is using the more flattering ""seasons"", rather than ""years"", meaning that the seasons 1996, 1997, and 1998 are deemed to not have existed. Add 3 to every Browns number (except last playoff experience) to get the real-world years."

I don't think it's as dire as this author makes it out to be. I mean, when you look at the names, sure, no one is going to say, ""We need to look out for this guy."" Even Julius Thomas was relatively unknown outside of Denver before he exploded on the scene a couple years ago, because injury forced him into the line up.  Maybe one of these guys steps up and becomes a solid passing target? How many days until TC opens?  edit Holy run-on sentence."
Browns,353ccf,Deadleggg,3,Wed May 6 20:55:38 2015 UTC,21 passes over 20 yards and only 9 were deemed catchable. Yikes.
Browns,353ccf,phinwalsh,3,Wed May 6 22:29:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty alarming!  I was surprised by that fact too."
Browns,353ccf,Witness_My_Greatness,3,Wed May 6 22:36:19 2015 UTC,"Solid improvement I talent across the board (mins tight end really) and adding quality depth and rotational players on defense is good.  If last year's rookies make a significant jump we could have play makers at running back, linebacker and corner. I'm really excited about the defense. The secondary is loaded with Veterans and the defensive line should be I m proved with the addition of a true nose tackle.  If our QBS are average and limit bone headed turnovers we'll threaten 9-7 and mayyyyybe a wildcard.  If the QBS play above average we have the division ."

Browns,356wr3,notgravy,1 point,Thu May 7 19:33:44 2015 UTC,"Booms radio and comedic genius never shined brighter than some lame-o ""hit the button"" first kind of game.   In Chuckie's game, instead of buzzers, they shouted ""WahWah"" or ""PeePee""   It was a riot - for a 2 year old who just learned the word PeePee.  This was shit that a freshman college radio student, working the graveyard shift for free, would be embarrassed of.     Chuck loves it.  Correction.   Chuck loved it."
Browns,3526xw,dayflyer55,11,Wed May 6 14:11:32 2015 UTC,I would not draft any of the browns backfield.  I imagine a similar situation to last year where we have no clue who will get most touches until the game is halfway over.
Browns,3526xw,Odihn,8,Wed May 6 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"Our RBs are good for football, horrible for fantasy. Although Crow was good value last year as 13th round or something (can't remember when I actually got him) some people will take Crow/West way earlier than they should for fantasy."
Browns,3526xw,Daviroth,1 point,Wed May 6 14:32:27 2015 UTC,I took Crow in the 16th as the last guy drafted. Homerism paid off.
Browns,3526xw,kpyle,3,Wed May 6 20:25:51 2015 UTC,"I think crowell becomes your workhorse, west is your breather back, and duke is your 3rd down/change of pace/darren sproles type back.  The roles are going to be way clearer, but you're right, it's still a three headed monster"
Browns,3526xw,Nightcinder,9,Wed May 6 14:35:25 2015 UTC,I'm still saying I won't be surprised if Twest gets traded
Browns,3526xw,Redditor5StandingBy,1 point,Wed May 6 14:43:51 2015 UTC,Nothing below a 3rd hopefully. Maybe get a good deal on a RB/WR trade
Browns,3526xw,alexunderwater,2,Wed May 6 16:43:25 2015 UTC,I'd like to see a trade like that with Indy. They hAve more good WRs than they could possibly use.
Browns,3526xw,firerex,3,Wed May 6 18:10:49 2015 UTC,Dunno how willing Indy will be to trade is for another RB.
Browns,3526xw,WaffylesYay,2,Wed May 6 21:55:23 2015 UTC,ESPECIALLY from us

Browns,3526xw,jg87iroc,3,Thu May 7 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"Your probably dead on with that, for the first half of the season at least. Duke may the opportunity to get early down work as he progresses but its all up in the air. So I'm staying clear of that situation. I don't think I will draft a single browns player nobody is going to get a big enough piece of the pie to relevant"
Browns,3526xw,Redditor5StandingBy,2,Wed May 6 14:44:30 2015 UTC,what about DEF?
Browns,3526xw,jg87iroc,3,Wed May 6 16:46:01 2015 UTC,I almost exclusively stream unless a top 3 d falls to me really late. They will be on my radar for sure though

Browns,3526xw,mibikin,1 point,Wed May 6 16:50:07 2015 UTC,Most formats you should be streaming your defenses anyways.  So if its in the last two rounds I see no harm in it
Browns,3526xw,moodyfloyd,1 point,Wed May 6 18:26:11 2015 UTC,Yeah my last two picks are usually our defense and then a kicker.
Browns,3526xw,RylanTheWalrus,5,Wed May 6 18:31:44 2015 UTC,my league awards points for return yardage and TDs (1 pt for every 25 return yards). im taking a flier on duke in the 15th. might be a good flex play eventually.

Browns,3526xw,theduke282,1 point,Wed May 6 14:54:25 2015 UTC,I imagine our backfield will be a Nawlins type fantasy backfield where'd you'd generally want to avoid it.  Duke may be a good late round flyer for 1 PPR leagues where he could plug in flex spots/bye weeks
Browns,3526xw,bmcclure937,1 point,Wed May 6 15:52:04 2015 UTC,Its gone full Belichick
Browns,3526xw,Putin__Nanny,7,Fri May 8 17:30:43 2015 UTC,"From a fantasy perspective the Browns offense is pretty toxic. Nobody has emerged as consistently productive. We have a RBBC (Running Back By Committee) so it is unsure who will be seeing most touches, most yards, most TDs, most looks in RedZone, etc.  We also have a question mark at QB and brand new WRs, so it is a wild guess who might produce. No TE is guaranteed a good game.  I am a huge Browns fan but would avoid Browns offense at all costs in fantasy, as tempted as you might be."
Browns,3526xw,Cats_Boobs_Gameing,2,Wed May 6 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"The defense is the only thing that could work for FF, depending who they have to play any giving week."
Browns,3526xw,Nightcinder,5,Wed May 6 20:31:05 2015 UTC,"Simple way to beat this do what I do. Draft Issiah Crowell and T west to be my RB1 and RB2. and than draft Duke Johnson to be my WR/RB and bam the Browns 3 headed monster will be mine, every yard, TD and reception out of the backfield will be mine! Also bonus points if you draft Johhny Football in round 1 and make him your starting qb. GO BROWNS!"
Browns,3526xw,TweetPoster,2,Wed May 6 16:28:51 2015 UTC,I bet you could go through a fantasy draft this year and get an entire roster of browns starters.  I may try this just for the sake of hilarity.

I don't see him winding up a starter, but using him as a hybrid weapon is the best thing we can give Manziel/McCown in lieu of a true WR1 at the moment."
Browns,3526xw,TapedeckNinja,8,Wed May 6 15:00:09 2015 UTC,He can be our Gio to Crowell's Jeremy Hill.  Obviously that's an insanely optimistic outlook but it would be nice.

Browns,351yte,Daviroth,3,Wed May 6 14:17:24 2015 UTC,Because that's probably a rendering and if you order it they have a couple of weeks to make one anyways.

Browns,351yte,brownsallday,1 point,Thu May 7 01:17:45 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm just easily impressed. But they make a quality product for a fraction of the price.

Browns,351yte,QueefStain,0,Wed May 6 15:53:17 2015 UTC,It's a jersey photo. How much effort are you under the impression that takes? Also if they're sewn jerseys then they have the letters and numbers readily available. It's no more effort for them to make this jersey than it is for them to make the most popular jersey they sell.
Browns,351yte,Mustang1718,2,Thu May 7 05:55:07 2015 UTC,Alibaba is nuts man. There are entire cities devoted solely to making their cheap knock-offs of everything.

He is a pretty avid golfer so if he can just do that in his off time, without the typical college students getting drunk on the university course, I think he will be fine.

Browns,34zrl1,blackedout,32,Wed May 6 03:19:30 2015 UTC,"Shanahan is a good offensive coordinator. No one will deny that. But the thing is that, like his father, he is very stuck in his ways and wants to have everything done his way. And I have a feeling that he and Pettine disagreed on a few key things, and Kyle basically threw a fit. The playcalling became much less inspired and far more vanilla right around the Houston game. The reasons for that, I don't know.   But all I need to know about Kyle Shanahan are these two things:   Mike Pettine seemed very pleased and very relieved that he hired Coach Flip as OC. Why? Because Flip was his hand picked man. Kyle Shanahan was forced on him by Lombardi and Banner when they hired Pettine. You want a guy that is loyal to your head coach, and I don't think Shanahan was to Pettine. The fact that Browns players didn't see all that upset by his departure and, even more than that, Washington players were very happy when he left and they actually congratulated Cleveland players when Shanahan was let go. If your players hate your coaches...that's just bad mojo."
Browns,34zrl1,VonJaeger,10,Tue May 5 22:54:44 2015 UTC,Not disagreeing at all but what Washington players were congratulating the browns when Shanahan left. Genuinely interested

Browns,34zrl1,stefantababy,6,Wed May 6 04:54:39 2015 UTC,"Shanahan is a good offensive coordinator. No one will deny that.   I totally will debate that. I live near DC and before tunein allowed me to listen to Browns radio, I had to endure Lavar Arrington discuss RG3 for years on my way home from work. Things that was widely discussed about RG3/Redskins offense while Shanny was here:   RG3 was awesome for a year with a perfect offense for him to execute When one thing changed (RG3s mobility) the entire offense fell completely flat with very little modifications to help them succeed Defenses figured out the offense and adjusted making the offense much worse while the offense didn't seem to change much. Because RG3 wasn't smart enough to run a grown up offense, Shanny finally (a year later) made a simplified version and it ended up with DBs sitting back and waiting for the passes they knew where coming.   Does this sound eerily similar to us? We are all white wine and shrimp for 6 weeks and then Mack gets hurt but we keep pushing forward, defenses figure it out and stack the box after our big win in Cincy, we don't change a thing and Hoyer goes from passable to horrible, puts Johnny in a simplified offense not suited to him and it is disastrous.   I think Kyle makes great plans for the offense he's given and then I think he is just like Chud: he won't adjust after half time when the other team is. JJ Watt is killing Schwartz? Let's keep fucking tossing it off the RT. 4th and long? Let's only do a 3 yard shuttle pass (I understand this is good at times, but he only did this, never threw for a 1st down).   TL:DR - Kyle would make a great Madden OC because defenses won't adjust to his schemes."
Browns,34zrl1,bearsdriving,3,Wed May 6 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"I agree & I wonder why he thinks he has the gravis tas his daddy does.

But the guy is a self-entitled asshole who feels like he deserves more than what he is worth because of what his dad has accomplished. From my non-expert experience being around him."

So to make yourself feel better, you're in x-girlfriend syndrome and I get that.  She never really loved you.  But the fact of the matter is Johnny was a piece of shit last year.  By his own admission.  And you know this, and I know this, and he knows this.  He didn't study, he didn't practice, he came in late and didn't listen.  It was a complete and wasted year.  If this is a shock to you, my dear friend, please take a breath and then go read, well, anything.    So Shanny, who was here to help him succeed saw a shit faced little fuck who didn't give a fuck and didn't care and chose not to listen to him.  What's remotely so hard to see about that? You think this is some alien remote concept?  Shanny can only show him the plays so much before Manziel ahs to do something himself.

Pray tell me, in your infinite wisdom, why did we not put Manziel in earlier?  Because Pettine and Shanny, who are real football guys, saw he wasn't earning his keep.  Wasn't paying his due. Was getting stoned or high or drunk and coming late to meetings, not putting the work in.  Do you honestly think that Pettine and Shanahan had some great conspiracy? Are you kidding?  He is an adult.  They are all adults.  I'm assuming you've never had a job where you depended on someone else for a paycheck.  its one thing to help a newbie out, its another thing if they're the bosses son and all they do is drink all day.  You bet your ass you'd want out just as much as the next guy."
Browns,34zrl1,VonJaeger,6,Wed May 6 02:09:30 2015 UTC,"So Shanny, who was here to help him succeed saw a shit faced little fuck who didn't give a fuck and didn't care and chose not to listen to him. What's remotely so hard to see about that? You think this is some alien remote concept?    Oh, I'm not disagreeing at all. But that also makes Shanahan a quitter who gave up because of the fact that he didn't want to coach a player. You can try and slice this anyway anti-Manziel that you'd like, and while I absolutely agree that Manziel was pretty much a failure last year, to insinuate that Shanahan gave it his all is absolutely laughable. The dude gave up near the end of the season, and anyone who followed Cleveland closely knew it. The play calling was a fucking joke come November - coincidentally, this was right around the time Hoyer started to struggle. Hoyer started playing bad and the pressure was put on Hoyer and when people started calling for Manziel, Shanahan started giving up. Shanahan never liked Johnny - you can check with any Cleveland beat reporter, and they'll tell you that Shanahan always preferred Jimmy Garappolo, Derek Carr, or Tom Savage. Those were the three guys he preferred. Shanahan gave up on the season once it was known that Hoyer was out of time. Simple as that. And someone like that should not be part of the team - why do you think Pettine and Farmer were so eager to release him from his contract? The dude had become a cancer.  Shanahan always wanted this head coaching gig. When he interviewed for Cleveland, that was the position he interviewed for initially. When Lombardi and Banner hired Pettine, they made it so that Shanahan would be his OC - Pettine did not get to choose. Don't you think there was a bit of resentment in that you're forced to work under a rookie HC that got the job that you wanted? And then the GM drafts a QB that you didn't want, and then your preferred QB on the roster - Hoyer - is failing and you realize that it's only a matter of time before Manziel gets his chance...don't you think you'd not give a shit? The truth of the matter is that Shanahan was forced into Pettine's staff with a rookie QB that he didn't want and that rookie QB was going to start as soon as the shit QB in front of him struggled. And Shanahan couldn't handle that. If you're willing to make a 23 slide presentation to your boss about why you want to quit your job, you fucking quit.   Shanahan's presence had become toxic within Berea and it was time for him to go - he knew it, Pettine knew it, Farmer knew, and hell, Hoyer knew it as well. The entire situation at the end of the year - Manziel's struggles, Farmer's questioning of Shanahan, Shanahan's dislike of Johnny, Hoyer's crashing to Earth - created a toxic atmosphere. You have to fix the problem, so what do you do? You get rid of the guy that didn't want to be there. Cleveland just lucked out that Shanahan realized this as well, and asked for his release. Actually, that's not right. Cleveland didn't luck out, because Shanahan asking to be released caused Cleveland to look far more dysfunctional than it really was. It's pretty funny that as soon as Shanahan left, and Johnny went to rehab, and Hoyer left, and Flip was hired that the dysfunctional reports in Cleveland died down significantly.  I genuinely think that Shanahan is a good coach, but Shanahan has an ego. He had one in Washington, and that's why nobody in that organization or on that team can stand him anymore. He wants things to be done his way. And I think he wanted Johnny to do well, but I think he already did not like Johnny form the get-go because Farmer didn't take the guy that he wanted. So when Manziel didn't do what he was supposed to, neither did Shanahan. It's as simple as that."
Browns,34zrl1,djroomba322,-14,Wed May 6 02:13:01 2015 UTC,"You make some interesting points.  But it looks like you take the entire situation and make justifications from the end result, instead of how the situation would naturally unfold.  But i do think he was more interested in a head coaching gig than an OC gig.  And I think like any level headed individual it took him hanging out with Manziel probably a week to realize he wasn't going to be able to get any recognition or his next job from staying here.   Shanahan's presence had become toxic within Berea and it was time for him to go - he knew it, Pettine knew it, Farmer knew, and hell, Hoyer knew it as well.   See, this is what I don't particularly agree with.  I think you're missing some very obvious divisions.  You think Pettine was on Farmers side in all of this, and he clearly most certainly was not.  Pettine is a players guy and he backed Hoyer.  And for good reason. In fact, Grossi said on the radio that pettine called him after the ravens game to apologize for how he was treated by the organization.  Farmer didn't support Hoyer and it made Pettine angry.  That's in part of what the whole textgate was about assumedly.  Why else would have reason to text down?  I'm sure there was some animosity between pettine and shanny, because Shanny surely said ""look at this fucking kid, he doesn't do shit, he doesn't learn shit, its not my fault if he fails"" and pettine would say ""just do it and shut up"" etc etc.    But the toxicity stemmed from Farmer not backing Hoyer when we had the chance.  Pettine is the one most people should be mad at, not Shanny.  Because he's in charge of his OC.  If he thought for  a second what Shanny was doing was going against the fiber of the team and actively hurting them, he seems like a guy who would have ended right there.  But the truth is, they were both probably on the same side together, with hoyer as well.   So when Manziel didn't do what he was supposed to, neither did Shanahan. It's as simple as that.   Yes, but again the wrong reason.  He's a top tier NFL offensive coordinator.  If I'm the Philharmonic Conductor, I'm not going to waste my time conducting if you put some 8th grader with a tuba out there, which is what Manziel was.  And I certainly wouldn't stay if my next paycheck or gig would be tied to it.  Same as why Mack asked for an opt out, same as why Cameron left."
Browns,34zrl1,VonJaeger,2,Wed May 6 02:26:47 2015 UTC,"You think Pettine was on Farmers side in all of this, and he clearly most certainly was not.   I never said that. I just think that Pettine recognized that having Shanahan and Hoyer around still was creating a toxic atmosphere. Shanahan very clearly did not want to be in Cleveland anymore - everyone in that organization knew it - and Pettine knew that Hoyer sticking around was creating a bad atmosphere. It wasn't all Hoyer's fault, or Farmer's, but there were things said and feelings revealed that simply couldn't be taken back. There were too many emotions on the table for the team to operate in a healthy environment.    But the toxicity stemmed from Farmer not backing Hoyer when we had the chance.   The toxicity stemmed from Shanahan being vehemently opposed to starting Manziel, Farmer constantly questioning Shanahan and not supporting Hoyer, and Hoyer from starting to sell out the team near the end. Don't act like Hoyer is the innocent man in all of this, because he isn't. Gordon selling out on the year was in large part due to he and Hoyer never getting along. There are rumors that Hoyer and Jordan Cameron started disagreeing at the end of the season as well.    Pettine is the one most people should be mad at, not Shanny. Because he's in charge of his OC. If he thought for a second what Shanny was doing was going against the fiber of the team and actively hurting them, he seems like a guy who would have ended right there. But the truth is, they were both probably on the same side together, with hoyer as well.   Pettine should share part of the blame, yes. He should have put his foot down at some point and told Shanahan how it was going to be. That's part of the reason why Pettine vowed to be more involved on the offensive side of the ball when they hired Flip. But there's a difference between intentionally sabotaging a team and just creating a toxic atmosphere. You can't do a whole lot about making someone feel better about something. That's out of your hands. And if Shanahan was really on Pettine's side, he would still be here - no question. Shanahan decided he wanted out of Cleveland, and that's not on Pettine's side or on Cleveland's side. That's on Shanahan's side.    Yes, but again the wrong reason. He's a top tier NFL offensive coordinator. If I'm the Philharmonic Conductor, I'm not going to waste my time conducting if you put some 8th grader with a tuba out there, which is what Manziel was.   Then he quit. I mean, there's no other way to say it. He didn't want to work with Manziel. I can't blame him for being frustrated with Manziel, but the fact of the matter is that he quit and wanted to leave because of it. He, and everyone else in that organization, knew that Hoyer was not going to be brought back. And if that happens, that means you're either riding with Johnny or you're drafting someone new. And Shanahan didn't want to be a part of it, so he left the team.   The crux of the matter is that Shanahan got his feelings hurt, he felt like he was being encroached upon, and he felt like he should have been given the freedom to do what he wished on offense. When that didn't happen and Farmer and Pettine decided that Manziel needed to start, Shanahan got pissed and basically quit. I can't blame him for being pissed off that your QB is being decided for you, but it is what it is. If he were truly a top tier offensive coordinator, he'd stick around and work through it and find a resolution. Instead, he gave a bunch of bullshit reasons as to why he wanted out and quit on the team. Just like Johnny quit on the team last year. In three of his stops as an offensive coordinator, Shanahan has completely burnt his bridges with two of them. If that's not an indication of the kind of person he can be, I don't know what is."
Browns,34zrl1,watts22,3,Wed May 6 02:43:07 2015 UTC,"dude, you gotta stop feeding the troll.  this guy hates on the browns nonstop on this sub.  you will never get through to him, no matter how logical your argument.  Also, there are reports that the reason we didn't pick up bridgewater, was because Shanahan wasn't on board with it.  So he didn't want bridgewater, didn't want manziel, couldn't get along with RG3... who the fuck does he want?  Next year he'll probably be bitching about Matt Ryan.  You are correct in your assessment of Shanahan.  I'm glad he's gone."
Browns,34zrl1,djroomba322,-14,Wed May 6 03:06:48 2015 UTC,"I think you're certainly allowed your own opinion of things.  And most of the things you make sense and could very readily be valid.  Except:   Don't act like Hoyer is the innocent man in all of this, because he isn't   He obviously is.  He did absolutely nothing wrong. He was the consummate profession on every level and in every turn.  I've heard you and other people who are ""team Manziel"" and ""anti-Hoyer"" say he threw Cameron under the bus and that is the basis for this insane jihand against him.  Except that wasn't true, he didn't do that, you have zero proof he did, and you're wrong.  Absolutely positively hoyer did nothing wrong.  And you have zero proof that he did.  You have not one shred of evidence, and I can link you literally thousands of interviews where he said the exact right thing, or video not taken out of context of him helping Manziel and talking to him.   Farmer constantly questioning Shanahan    NO.  STOP THIS.  He questioned PETTINE.  Not Shanahan. This is PETTINE's team.  If he has a problem with the OC, he talks to Pettine and pettine handles it.  Stop passing blame, that's so dumb.  If you don't like the OC for the Pats, do you think Craft goes down and says shit to the OC? No. He talks to Bellichek.   Then he quit. I mean, there's no other way to say it. He didn't want to work with Manziel. I can't blame him for being frustrated with Manziel,   Again, for the 3000th time.  he worked with him.  he worked with him he worked with him.  Manziel decided he wasn't interested, and quit working with him.  I can't even possibly fathom you imagining this.  You think if Manziel had his revelation in november and completely changed his life around Shanny would have said ""NO I CANNOT TEACH YOU"".  Bullshit and you know it.   he crux of the matter is that Shanahan got his feelings hurt, he felt like he was being encroached upon, and he felt like he should have been given the freedom to do what he wished on offense   Complete bullshit.  And completely unfounded.  You know nothing of his emotion.  The only one we know who was emotional was Farmer and his texting to the field in anger.  That's it.  His pay is tied to the QB, we have the worst QB in the league, he wants out.  You can call that shady, but don't try to make him some villain."
Browns,34zrl1,VonJaeger,3,Wed May 6 02:52:21 2015 UTC,"He obviously is. He did absolutely nothing wrong. He was the consummate profession on every level and in every turn. I've heard you and other people who are ""team Manziel"" and ""anti-Hoyer"" say he threw Cameron under the bus and that is the basis for this insane jihand against him. Except that wasn't true, he didn't do that, you have zero proof he did, and you're wrong. Absolutely positively hoyer did nothing wrong. And you have zero proof that he did. You have not one shred of evidence, and I can link you literally thousands of interviews where he said the exact right thing, or video not taken out of context of him helping Manziel and talking to him.   Except for the part where he threw the entire offense under the bus in the loss to Indianapolis. He literally called out Jordan Cameron for not running the correct route. Stop defending his ass. I'm not anti-Hoyer, but the dude gets so fucking babied because he's from Cleveland. He's a bad QB who is a failure, because he fucking failed to win games. Stop acting like the dude didn't contribute to the toxic environment, because he most certainly did. Feel free to have your opinion and be in complete denial about it, but when even Tony Grossi admits that Hoyer is getting hostile, you know it's true, because Grossi is probably the biggest Hoyer apologist there is.   NO. STOP THIS. He questioned PETTINE. Not Shanahan. This is PETTINE's team.   ...he questioned Shanahan's play calling. That's questioning Shanahan, because Shanahan is the offensive coordinator and Pettine does not call the offensive plays. That doesn't mean he went down and talked to Shanahan - he most certainly talked to Pettine - but he was questioning Shanahan's ability to play call.   Again, for the 3000th time. he worked with him. he worked with him he worked with him. Manziel decided he wasn't interested, and quit working with him. I can't even possibly fathom you imagining this. You think if Manziel had his revelation in november and completely changed his life around Shanny would have said ""NO I CANNOT TEACH YOU"". Bullshit and you know it.   Fine, let me clarify. He stopped working with Manziel, just as Manziel stopped trying. Does that clarify things for you? He gave up on Manziel - and Cleveland - just as Manziel gave up on the season.   Complete bullshit. And completely unfounded. You know nothing of his emotion. The only one we know who was emotional was Farmer and his texting to the field in anger.   Complete bullshit. And completely unfounded. You know nothing of Farmer's emotion.    You can call that shady, but don't try to make him some villain.   I didn't say he's a villain. I said he's a quitter. And you can deny that and spin that on Manziel and Farmer and Pettine all that you'd like, but you cannot deny that Kyle Shanahan quit on this team and walked out on it, because he didn't want to play nice with Ray Farmer, Mike Pettine, and Johnny Manziel."
Browns,34zrl1,djroomba322,-9,Wed May 6 03:07:25 2015 UTC,"Except for the part where he threw the entire offense under the bus in the loss to Indianapolis. He literally called out Jordan Cameron for not running the correct route.   Nope.  Link.  Bullshit.  I think we found the problem.  You take an out of context incorrectly quoted statement and extrapolate more from that.  I absolutely 100% garuntee I wont wake up tomorrow with you providing an in context link for this that fits your narrative.  Please prove me wrong.   Fine, let me clarify. He stopped working with Manziel, just as Manziel stopped trying. Does that clarify things for you? He gave up on Manziel - and Cleveland - just as Manziel gave up on the season.   Nope.  He worked with Hoyer.  He only stopped working with Manziel when Manziel stopped working.  I hardly see how that's on Shanny.   ...he questioned Shanahan's play calling. That's questioning Shanahan, because Shanahan is the offensive coordinator and Pettine does not call the offensive plays.   Again.  You talk to the coach.  The GM doesn't talk about playcalling to the OC.  (I can't believe i'm explaining this).  So now the GM magically wills the OC to do something, but the coach then comes back and says ""But I said do X"" and the OC is going to say, ""But the GM said do y!"".  No.  That's retarded.  Pettine has 100% control over his team.  If he didn't like something, or if something was happening that was wrong, its on him.  You can't just pass it off, that's not how any organization has ever worked.    Kyle left because we had dysfunction in our front office, our QB is shit, and there are better opportunities out there.  If you see that as a negative, fine.  I think its shitty, but I can't blame him."

The whole reason I am so mad about this is because we gave up a good offense and a good QB and a close to winning season and tossed it all.  So we could start over again.

The definition of grand is magnificent and imposing in appearance, size, or style. None of that applies to Manziel's statement."
Browns,3505c6,djroomba322,-23,Wed May 6 01:36:09 2015 UTC,"Semantics. You see what you want to see and ignore the facts.    So what determines grand or not huh?  because I was told explicitly here, that he didn't NEED to make a statement.  And yet there it is, all eyes on me."

Browns,3505c6,miked1be,1 point,Wed May 6 04:28:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure Tampa Bay's bad O line and the fact that their offensive coordinator was missing all season had nothing to do with it.  Sure, McCown didn't do much to help the team but basically saying he single-handedly got them the first pick is a bit silly.  Also, when I say that the OC was missing, I don't mean metaphorically where he sucked so much he might as well not have been there, I mean he physically was not there.  They had to use their QB coach as OC or something along those lines."

I pretty sure it was his job to come in and clean Randy Lerner/Holmgen's dreck out of the front office, and put the organization in a clean position to be built properly--like the way a lot of businesses use consultants (e.g. ""The Bobs"").  But when Jimmy couldn't close on Chip Kelly, I think it was in Haslem's best interest to use Joe as a scapegoat, and I think Joe agreed to it, because he was never supposed to be there permanently to begin with."

Can Johnny improve? Yes. Does he have talent? Yes. Will he turn into a franchise QB? Who knows. From all reports, he's on the right track, and I will support him as long as he keeps his reported new work ethic. Still, without JTC's interference, we'd have Bridgewater and would be much better off today."
Browns,34ybay,inferno167,2,Tue May 5 16:47:01 2015 UTC,would we better off? or would we have been calling for a new qb because he almost had as many INTs as he has TD and that he wasn't exactly the savior we'd hoped he'd be?
Browns,34ybay,hatmantc,-1,Tue May 5 19:08:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I believe we would be. Bridgewater showed a lot more promise last year than Johnny did, and put in a lot more work. As I said, Johnny can improve, and we've certainly put him in the perfect situation with a great offense for him to be able to improve. Great defense and a strong run game, passing off play action is a good way to develop any young QB. If he does turn out to be our franchise QB, then great. That's really the only thing I care about, not the name on the back of the jersey."
Browns,34zgsn,Titans_Mod,11,Tue May 5 21:04:24 2015 UTC,"This is a really cool and engaging idea, especially in the boring-downtime off season before June-July.  I think we Should consider something similar."

Browns,350r8h,Spartan_55,5,Wed May 6 03:45:42 2015 UTC,"From March 24th:   Houston Texans owner Bob McNair stated the team may appear on Hard Knocks, via John McClain of the Houston Chronicle. ""It’s something we’re considering, but I haven’t decided,"" he said.  ""It’s a distraction, but it’s something people like to see,"" McNair added, with McClain pointing out the team previously turned down the opportunity in the past. McClain provided further comments:  McNair on Hard Knocks “Our first responsibility is 2 do everything 2 win on the field so the question is what impact does that have on you?”  Texans invited on Hard Knocks but Gary Kubiak wasn't in favor of it. They didn't qualify last year cause O'Brien was a first-year coach."

Browns,34xw20,kevler9oh,1 point,Wed May 6 07:41:08 2015 UTC,"pretty much.  like i said, i wouldnt mind someone like hundley or greyson but given our current situation they will not have the time to sit a few years and develop.  those are NOT guys that should be starting first year.  there were plug and play guys at other positions that were available into the 3rd and 4th that can contribute right away.  This is NOT a team that was a QB away, makes much more sense to get the good players than reach for junk at your biggest need.  besides, next year's class looks light years better than the guys that just came out.  to be honest there is not a single QB in this class i would have wanted before the mid second round in a non-trash class."

He has a personality defect and as Bobbie Bowden once said ""How am I supposed to fix a problem a player's momma should've fixed years ago."" Remember last year when he got a break and instead of reading the play book he ends up in Vegas partying? Sure I hope it works out but we gotta find a QB for the long run.  The repeat effect from rehab doesn't drop off for another 5 years.  He's going to get hit and he's going to hear the boos and its really easy just to make that all go away with what ever is his drug of choice.

He was clearly not in any kind of comfort zone with the snap (watch some A&M highlights and his body language). But he showed some skills. He has the legs to truly outrun/out-turn an NFL defenseman. He also has the arm. I'm too much of an ignoramus to know how his vision or play control are, but he has talent. His body is in it, but it was his head that wasn't."

Browns,34yxbj,draino3112,6,Tue May 5 19:46:51 2015 UTC,"A base 4-3 with cover 2 is not giving you any completion under 20 yards. I get that your saying it's not a complex set but it's not even ""pretty close"" to prevent."
Browns,34yxbj,blinner,-6,Tue May 5 20:08:52 2015 UTC,Base personnel.  The corners didn't press and the linebackers didn't blitz.  Neither was disguised in any way.    I think those are the keys here.
Browns,34yxbj,Marzman315,4,Tue May 5 20:15:29 2015 UTC,That's a pretty enormous jump from prevent defense.
Browns,34yxbj,blinner,-7,Tue May 5 20:49:09 2015 UTC,Not at the NFL level.  Any QB should be able to trounce that defense.
Browns,34yxbj,Marzman315,4,Tue May 5 21:21:19 2015 UTC,"Okay whatever you say, I see your mind is clearly made up."
Browns,34yxbj,kpyle,0,Tue May 5 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"Its true though. Vanilla defense is easy to beat. See Weeden in the preseason. It wasn't prevent at all, but they weren't exactly pulling aces out of their sleeve. They didn't need to at that point in the game. Its not that big of a deal in the end. That was unprepared, on-his-own-hype-train Manziel we saw last year. If he gets his head in the game there's no telling what he could do. He has some footwork issues, but he is physically capable either way."
Browns,34yxbj,SuperPoop,0,Wed May 6 00:44:03 2015 UTC,I disagree. He was able to do things in college with his legs. I don't think in the NFL his legs will be able to do anything except extend plays.
Browns,34yxbj,God_HatesFigs,18,Wed May 6 17:57:33 2015 UTC,"So glad Shanahan is gone. He was terrible with RGIII and his limited time with Manziel. Neither player ran a zone read or option offense in college, so his offense with those players was like shoving a square peg in a round hole.   And nearly all of those plays involved some kind of boot play-action, when Johnny works better from a pocket to see the whole field and to take advantage of breakdowns in the defense."
Browns,34yxbj,Daviroth,9,Tue May 5 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. Johnny Manziel is custom built to a bootleg play-action beautifully, and he does. This is the game where the playcalling was actually perfectly fine for Manziel, it's all the other games where mistakes were made.  But nonetheless: Manziel runs well, has a strong arm, and seemingly throws well off balance. He is built to run the bootleg play-action. It's almost quite literally his calling."
Browns,34yxbj,God_HatesFigs,8,Tue May 5 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he did pretty well on those plays but my point is you can only run so many bootlegs before the defense puts Banjo Coverage on your QB and he's getting crashed by an LB every time.   Also comparing the offensive gameplan of Buffalo (in which Johnny came in in relief) and Cincinnati (came in as a starter) was night and day. In Buffalo the offense ran a more typical pro style probably because the offense practiced all week with Hoyer as the starter but when Manziel  came in he barely missed a beat. Vs. Cincinnati Shanahan inexplicably threw away the playbook and made everyone run a zone-read (something Manziel never did in college). Using his athleticism on the edge is fine, but it isn't at all a viable option in this league as a full-time offense."
Browns,34yxbj,Daviroth,2,Tue May 5 21:46:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to say he will run the bootleg exclusively at all, I'm sorry if I came off that way. What I'm saying is that an offense made for Johnny will almost certainly use bootlegs very often, much like Shanny's offense did. I'd expect quite a few every game. They get a little smart and put an OLB exclusively on Manziel? Run down their fucking throats and do quick slants/in-pocket reads for a quarter until they stop. Then bootleg play-action for 50 yards.  Obviously dramatized, but Manziel will be running bootlegs."

Browns,34yxbj,Rectalcactus,1 point,Thu May 7 13:16:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting!! There is a lot of good things to see in this video but still room for improvement. There are two plays he makes what I consider very poor judgements, and one that is just a bad throw. The play at 2:00, while it does end up a completion, was a bad decision and lucky it was not intercepted. To compound the bad decision the receiver breaking towards the left sideline had just become wide open. There is another throw he makes to west that look very similar but incomplete, man open on the left side but he never looks and he attempts to force it up the middle. However two bad decisions out of that many is not damning. The one thing I have large concerns about is his ability and willingness to go through his progressions especially to his left, he seems to heavily favor the right side then the middle with little attention to the left on plays not moving in that direction (bootlegs ect.). That being said he shows some good arm strength and decent accuracy barring the absolute miss of dray on the 5 yard dump out over the middle. He has some things to work on but I still believe he can iron it out and become a starting caliber qb."
Browns,34yxbj,dayflyer55,1 point,Thu May 7 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"I was expecting to be impressed by this, but I'm not. He looked like the worst kind of rookie in this game.  The boot was working well on the first drive because they were playing a prevent D, yet their linebackers were hanging on the play-action a little too long too.  He made good reads, but there these receivers were, like, wide open.  What I originally thought were some great passes- threading the needle (which they were)- at half speed he was eyeing his target from snap to throw and really forcing the ball in.    The athletic ability is there.  The decision making is not.  But I didn't see anything here that was uniquely bad to Johnny, just typical rookie qb play.  I'm excited to see if he can catch on this year."
Browns,34yxbj,Rectalcactus,1 point,Tue May 5 21:31:45 2015 UTC,Progressions and decision making needs work. Needs to stop eyeing up one section of the field the whole play and it will help both. Hopefully something they work at this offseason.
Browns,34yd4g,fivedime,15,Tue May 5 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"(1) 12 Danny Shelton, DT, Washington  What he brings: He's a prototypical two-gap nose tackle with a thick frame and excellent power. He commands double teams and makes plays against the run, and is an improving pass-rusher who can push the pocket and is light on his feet for a 339-pound nose tackle. He plays with an edge and good effort and stamina for a guy his size.  How he fits: Shelton adds size and depth to the interior defensive line and is arguably the best run-stopping defensive lineman in this class. He is insurance for DT Phil Taylor, who is coming off of knee surgery and entering a contract year. Shelton is a quality fit in defensive coordinator Jim O'Neil's hybrid scheme and should immediately help a Browns run defense that allowed a league-high 141.6 yards per game.    (1) 19 Cameron Erving, C, Florida State  What he brings: Erving excelled at center after moving over from left tackle midway through the 2014 season. He's a great athlete for the center position with his length and quickness, and his versatility to play multiple spots along the line is a huge asset. He's a good run-blocker but even better in pass protection.  How he fits: Erving adds depth and, most importantly, versatility along the offensive line. He will likely start his career at right guard next to OC Alex Mack and OG Joel Bitonio, giving the Browns one of the better offensive lines in the league. This also is in an attempt to continue to enhance the run game and take pressure off of QB Josh McCown or Johnny Manziel, whoever starts behind center.    (2) 51 Nate Orchard, OLB, Utah  What he brings: He's an effective pass-rusher with his initial quickness, second effort and ability to convert speed to power. He's strong at the point of attack for an outside linebacker prospect, but he has limited experience dropping in coverage and doesn't have great speed to play in space.  How he fits: Paul Kruger was the only OLB to have more than two sacks in 2014, which includes 2013 first-round pick Barkevious Mingo (2 sacks). Orchard brings a speed to power element and provides Jim O'Neil with another edge-rushing presence. Cleveland continues to bolster their front seven after losing Jabaal Sheard to free agency to combat the talented backs and strong rushing attacks within the division.    (3) 77 Duke Johnson, RB, Miami (FL)  What he brings: He isn't going to be a bell-cow back, but he projects as a very good change-of-pace runner with his quickness, speed and open-field running ability. He's one of the best pass-catchers of all the running backs in this class. There is some concern about his durability and whether he can consistently stay on the field.  How he fits: After adding Cam Erving in the first round, Cleveland continues to bolster its rushing attack in an effort to take pressure off QB Josh McCown or Johnny Manziel. This is a great fit for Johnson, who has excellent vision and will have the ability to manufacture big plays behind what is shaping up to be a very good offensive line. Johnson also brings strong versatility in the passing game, which allows whoever is at quarterback some easy completions.    (3) 96 Xavier Cooper, DT, Washington State  What he brings: He's a very effective interior speed rusher with his quickness, but he struggles to get pressure when the offensive lineman is able to lock on. He's a disruptive run defender with excellent range, but he needs to win with quickness.  How he fits: The Browns continue to stockpile bodies along the front seven. Cooper provides the quickness with enough size and versatility to fit within their hybrid front. He brings quality upside as a pass-rusher and should have an impact early as a rotational backup.    (4) 115 Ibraheim Campbell, S, Northwestern  What he brings: Campbell is a team captain who is at his best defending the run. He takes sound angles closing from the high slot, shows he can shed blocks quickly when he lines up in the box and is a reliable tackler who is better than average making one-on-one plays in space. He doesn't have the burst to regularly stay with NFL slot receivers in man, and his shorter arms raise concern about his ability to match up with tight ends, but he has enough range to cover a deep half and he flashes the ability to play the ball.    (4) 123 Vince Mayle, WR, Washington State  What he brings: Mayle doesn't have great speed and has some tightness coming out of breaks with underneath routes. However, he is an above-average athlete with plus size (6-2, 224) and strength and flashes the ability to win in contested situations. Mayle has a chance to develop into a No. 4 or No. 5 possession-type receiver on the back end of a roster.    (6) 189 Charles Gaines, CB, Louisville  What he brings: He's a very good athlete who can stick with most receivers, but his technique in coverage needs some polish and he can have trouble against bigger receivers on contested catches because of his lack of ideal size.    (6) 195 Malcolm Johnson, TE, Mississippi State  What he brings: Johnson lacks ideal size but brings a lot of versatility. He lines up at multiple spots and has quality receiving skills. Johnson reminds us a little of Buffalo Bills TE Charles Clay.    (6) 198 Randall Telfer, TE, USC  What he brings: Telfer has excellent measureables and brings good value as an inline blocker. While he isn't a dynamic threat in the passing game, he is tough and willing to do the dirty work the position requires, including working the middle of the field.    (7) 219 Hayes Pullard, ILB, USC  What he brings: Pullard has above-average instincts and overall range as a run defender. In addition, he shows strong awareness in coverage and does a nice job of marking targets in his territory in underneath zone coverage. Pullard is a reliable tackler but must continue to get stronger and improve his take-on skills. He will add initial depth as a middle or weakside linebacker and has the skill set to potentially develop into a starter down the road.    (7) 241 Iko Ekpre-Olomu, CB, Oregon  What he brings: The biggest concern with him relates to his durability, as he's recovering from a torn ACL suffered in December. He possesses the agility and explosive burst to hold up in man coverage on the outside or move inside to nickel corner. His football instincts are very good.    Mel Kiper's Draft Grade: B  Mel Kiper: Last year, Browns fans waited and hoped for the team to take a wide receiver, but Cleveland never found one it liked enough at each pick slot. This year, we saw more of the same. The Browns made a predictable and smart pick with Danny Shelton at No. 12, and I think he helps them shore up a leaky run defense immediately. The really curious selection was Cameron Erving at No. 19. Although I agree with some that he's among the best O-lineman in the draft -- and easily the best center -- he might end up at guard right away. The pick did make me think the Browns remember how much the run game fell apart when Alex Mack got hurt last year, and they aren't about to let that happen again. Still, a surprising pick. I liked the addition of the productive Nate Orchard. They no longer have Jabaal Sheard around, and Orchard gives them some juice off the edge as they wait for Barkevious Mingo to put it all together. Duke Johnson was a nice get in Round 3 as arguably the best pass-catching RB in the draft. If he's healthy, he's a stud. Xavier Cooper provides immediate depth on the defensive interior, and he's sneaky disruptive because of great quickness for his size. Vince Mayle had a ton of production in the WSU offense, but the speed is a major issue, and the hands can be inconsistent. I liked the additions of both Ibraheim Campbell (they need safety depth) and Charles Gaines. Hayes Pullard has a lot better tape than you'd expect for a guy taken so late. He'll see the field if healthy. Ifo Ekpre-Olomu could be a steal because he's essentially a redshirt and could really help the Browns in 2016. If there's a big question for me, it's whether they added enough help in the passing game. The QB situation is obviously a mystery -- I liked the idea of adding Bryce Petty in Round 3 here -- and based on what I can see, the Browns think the best use of the QBs they have right now is to keep them handing off.    Todd McShay's favorite pick  Round 3 (77): Duke Johnson, RB, Miami (Fla.)  I really liked the Browns' first round, and their top four picks overall in nose tackle Danny Shelton (No. 12), center Cameron Erving (No. 19), outside linebacker Nate Orchard (No. 51) and Johnson. Shelton can anchor the Browns' 3-4 defense; Erving will upgrade the O-line if the Browns are confident he can play guard, with Alex Mack already at center; and Orchard will bring physicality as a pass-rusher coming off the edge. But Johnson is my favorite as a great value in the third round. He is a big-play weapon in space and as a pass-catcher out of the backfield if he can stay healthy in the NFL."

Or all the penalties bringing back what few positive plays we had?  2nd and 20 over and over, pressure up the middle, Cincinnati dominating both lines of scrimmage?    Manziel threw like shit, but Shanahan is pathetic, be glad he's gone, and his stupid Pistol game plan with him.  It had been weeks at that point since we'd scored any kind of points on O, and the empty backfield QB keeper against Carolina was nothing more than a hit-piece, it had about zero chance for success, and what do you know the QB got injured (just like rg3).  Good riddance."
Browns,34y7s1,PrimeTimeHoyer,2,Tue May 5 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is that I don't think Shanahan switched to a read option offense for Manziel in that game.  At least, I didn't see it.  I am glad Shanahan's gone.  I was mad when we hired him."

Browns,34y7s1,PrimeTimeHoyer,-16,Tue May 5 22:57:10 2015 UTC,"Its pretty common knowledge from uninformed fans that he didn't run a regular offense in cinci.  Source? No?  Right.  Here's the deal.  The NFL is hard.  He couldn't call the plays.  The coach realizing this, gave him a chance.  He then watched him stand there like an idiot scramble and throw backwards.  So he tried to simplify it.  And then that didn't work.  And so he tried to make it even easier.  And that didn't work.  And then he tried to make it even easier.  And that didn't work.  And finally he was left with the simplest of all of the plays, the read option, and he couldnt even do that.  If you think for 1 second he was given a different playbook, you're insane.  We ran the exact same formations and the exact same sets. If anything we had a couple more shotgun than we normally have, because johnny was incapable of coming out of center in a proper drop.  The read option scheme worked just fine with a real QB like shaw too.  Don't let your jonny love cloud the facts.  Or do whatever makes you feel better."

Browns,34y7s1,Rectalcactus,6,Tue May 5 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"The only reason Shaw ""appeared"" better is because he didn't get the ball down 15-0.  PFF has Johnny rated above Shaw on the season (they both sucked), and Connor got better support from the D against BAL.  Against Cinci they laid down from the word go and we never had a chance."
Browns,34y7s1,PrimeTimeHoyer,-11,Tue May 5 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, QB problems? definitely the defense's fault.  It was 23-0 which isn't remotely insurmountable with like 3 minutes left in the 4th.  Totally the defenses fault.   Don't be ridiculous."
Browns,34y7s1,djroomba322,5,Tue May 5 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"Obviously Manziel played terribly in that game.  And, there's no (or very small) statistical correlation between defense and QB performance.  However, in many ways, it was like a perfect storm of a bad game.   Our special teams play was atrocious and we kept bringing the ball out of the end zone and getting stopped at the 15 yard line. We killed ourselves with penalties on Cincy's opening drive (roughing the passer and horse-collar in our own territory), and Haden dropped an INT in the end zone. Our first four drives ended as follows:    Manziel scramble on a busted bunch formation play, no one was open, no one was moving, caught by the spy just short of the first down. Good third down pass to Hawkins dropped; Manziel stepped up in the pocket on a blitz (good to see). Interception on a dig route to Hawkins (under-thrown) Manziel scrambles, makes a throw to Dray, who jumps too early and drops it (not a good pass, still should've been caught)   The next drive had two false starts, and a drop/tip by Benjamin that turned into an interception (called back, luckily).  It was a clusterfuck.  I couldn't even bring myself to re-watch the second half, even in condensed mode.  Poor special teams play, poor QB play, too many mistakes (9 penalties), and a defense that played well in spurts but couldn't get out of its own way to get off the field.  An all-out embarrassment."
Browns,34y7s1,TapedeckNinja,-2,Tue May 5 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you.  They didn't do a whole lot to help him.  Part of the this is a microcosm of the future problems we're going to see.  He is a reckless runner, a reckless scrambler.  And that is what made him great in college and is going to make him a liability in the pros.    Linemen are going to have a tough time keeping track of where he is, and that goes for receivers too. Chaos on offense is almost always a bad thing.  You'll get the occasional big play, but for every one of those, there is a linebacker you didn't see as you're twisting sideways and throwing off of one foot.   You want a reliable, under control, consistent, calm presense.  I still don't understand why he gets compared to wilson.  It makes no sense.  Even take away he can't actually run like Wilson, wilson plays under control.  With purpose.  Not jerky and sporatic.  And we'll see receivers and linemen lose him, and its going to be a huge issue, and will cause clusterfucks like this on a consistent basis."

Browns,34y7s1,MushyBananas,6,Tue May 5 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"No, I mean an actual whole game of him making plays like this video.  Regardless of all the factors that combined to create his six quarters of suck, I just wish I knew what a whole game like that looked like.  Maybe it would ease some of the justified doubt that lingers."
Browns,34y7s1,CaptainSweater,-7,Tue May 5 15:57:46 2015 UTC,"He did have a whole game of him playing like this video.   He didn't get to play a defense dropping 7 in to coverage in a prevent defense who are up 2 scores with 3 minutes left.   When the Bills decided to play defense, without even scheming against him he was 4-out.  After wonderful plays like this: http://gfycat.com/BarrenSeveralArizonaalligatorlizard  The next game, when a team had a couple days to prepare for him, put actual pressure on him and took away throwing lanes which is why he had to move and throw from bad platforms.  Because he is terrible at anything that doesn't involve him planted 10 feet out in shotgun on a 1st read."

Browns,34y7s1,theband65,4,Wed May 6 02:15:32 2015 UTC,let's see how he looks this year. I hated on him a lot last year because it seemed like he didn't care. Hopefully he's on top of his game this year.
Browns,34y7s1,NebsLaw,2,Tue May 5 15:54:25 2015 UTC,"I expect him to bounce back. I think we have made smart moves to help him. If it doesn't work out, then we look for someone else next offseason."
Browns,34y7s1,youwithme,6,Tue May 5 17:39:50 2015 UTC,People jump on the Johnny Hatewagon so blindly that they don't realize how good he is. Then they just throw shit out there like his arm strength/accuracy sucks and hope that they're right. There was so much talk about how he would fail at the NFL level that everyone started to assume he wasn't actually talented.  Johnny has all the skill to be great. It is only his mentality that's holding him back.
Browns,34y7s1,youwithme,4,Tue May 5 17:23:23 2015 UTC,He throws into 3 defenders. What am I missing?

Browns,34vxz9,bucksnbrownies,4,Tue May 5 01:17:34 2015 UTC,Made 77.5% through college.
Browns,34vxz9,bad_master,5,Tue May 5 01:21:45 2015 UTC,Doesn't sound impressive.
Browns,34vxz9,bearsdriving,4,Tue May 5 01:37:35 2015 UTC,That's the reason it's not on the infographic. If you have to put your bicep size on your graph over your field goal percentage you may not too great.  Hopefully he works out. I wish we brought in a ton of kickers though.
Browns,34vxz9,bearsdriving,6,Tue May 5 12:53:59 2015 UTC,He's about as impressive as a UDFA kicker gets right after the draft.
Browns,34vxz9,Putuinurplace,7,Tue May 5 01:43:18 2015 UTC,"Only like 28% of the rostered kickers are actually drafted. Actually, 9 of the top 10 kickers on PFF are undrafted. But the worse part is looking at the drafted kickers and how many of them were dropped or are back ups.   Really, drafting Ks seems like the least efficient way to go about it when you can be getting depth other places and get a starting quality guy through UDFA."
Browns,34vxz9,Beezer12WashingBird,4,Tue May 5 12:52:34 2015 UTC,How about tucker from the ravens.
Browns,34vxz9,Putuinurplace,3,Tue May 5 03:15:45 2015 UTC,Maybe because any kicker we get from the ravens blows dicks

Browns,34vxz9,TucanJamz,3,Tue May 5 08:41:03 2015 UTC,Why kicker so strong?
Browns,34vxz9,battle_squid,6,Tue May 5 00:51:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's because there isn't much they can do on the practice field other than just bomb kicks all day, so they hit the weight room really hard. Steve Weatherford on the Giants is a good example of this, but then there's kickers like Sebastian Janikowski who looks like he's ate at every McDonalds on the way to the game"

Browns,34vxz9,ForeignNFLfan,2,Tue May 5 12:08:27 2015 UTC,I think touchbacks on kickoffs are pretty highly valued by this staff. Stupid question because I don't watch college football: is the kickoff from the same yard line as the NFL?

Browns,34vjjt,buckeye45299,32,Mon May 4 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"I mean, here's the thing: I've never been optimistic about the Browns in my life (at least not in the past couple of decades), but I feel pretty good about them now.  Do I think we're going to make the playoffs this year?  Meh.  Probably not.  Do I think we're going to field a real goddamn competitive team every week, and not be embarrassed like we were in the days of Pat Shurmur?  Hell yes.  As everyone in /r/nfl would say: the negativity will stop when the Browns start winning games.  Even another year around .500 would probably shut a few people up.  As long as we keep Pettine and Farmer around and let them carry out their plan, I think the Browns are on the right track to be a damn good team in the long-term.  There are no shortcuts to success."
Browns,34vjjt,TapedeckNinja,9,Mon May 4 22:36:57 2015 UTC,"It would also help if we could go an offseason without some ridiculousness in the front office.  Ray Farmer getting himself suspended after Kyle Shanahan threw a semi-public shit fit trying to quit doesn't make for the offseason headlines that help project a stable organization, even if in the big scheme of things it wasn't a particularly big deal."
Browns,34vjjt,admiralkit,2,Tue May 5 01:44:50 2015 UTC,"Very true.  I hope that they have a staff in place that can all work together with some kind of harmony now, since everyone in the organization is finally all on the same page.  If I recall correctly, Shanahan was hired by Lombardi/Banner and not by Farmer/Pettine.  My conspiracy theory is that Farmer's texts were not football-related at all, and that he was just talking shit: ""Hey Kyle, go fuck yourself.""  ""Hi Kyle!  Suck my balls!""

Browns,34vjjt,Brokewood,4,Mon May 4 23:03:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of fans are overly negative. In fairness, I think a lot of fans in here are overly optimistic. I try to be realistic. I think we had a great draft. Probably the best draft we've had since returning. I loved it, and I don't just say that. My opinion of Ray Farmer went way up."
Browns,34vjjt,24rubikscube,2,Tue May 5 06:26:28 2015 UTC,"i agree with all of this. we just need some consistency in this city and let the front office get a 4 year plan in place. for now though we need our local reporters (Pat Mc, Jeremy Fowler) to stop whining like they belong in the front office and that they know better. consistency is the name of the game now"
Browns,34vjjt,djroomba322,-1,Tue May 5 04:05:51 2015 UTC,"This right here is the problem. This victim card.  We're not victims.  No one is out to get us.  Its not nearly as sky as falling as you think it is.  If someone says something negative, they might have a negative point.  That doesn't mean they're out to get you and make fun of you.    Are there some lolbrowns stuff?  Sure.  But most of it has disappeared.    Tell me, when's the last time you heard anyone say the Factory of Sadness?  Right?  You haven't.  Because Browns fans haven't harped on it over and over and over keeping it alive.  Just stop playing the victim, see the good for what it is, and accept while we do retarded stuff, people are completely allowed to say negative things."

Browns,34vjjt,Coffees4closers,3,Tue May 5 00:12:32 2015 UTC,Yea for sure. I'm hoping Flip installs a good playbook that works for John. Really want him to pull it together.
Browns,34vjjt,tonyd1989,2,Tue May 5 04:10:31 2015 UTC,I upvoted just for you calling him John. I think I will only refer to him as John or Mr Manziel from now on
Browns,34vjjt,clycloptopus,8,Tue May 5 04:18:27 2015 UTC,"This is why I like farmer and pettine. They don't listen to what the media or fans are screaming for. They do what they think is going to win games and that's it. That's why I do believe that manziel was farmers pick, he picks who he believes can succeed. In 5 years these two are going to look like goddamn geniuses."
Browns,34vjjt,TapedeckNinja,2,Tue May 5 14:32:13 2015 UTC,i love the way they operate too they're absolutely staying within themselves and what they believe is best. i do think they got pushed a little bit by jimmy to make that manziel pick but i think he has the talent. and if we keep building a great unit around the quarterback then we can make it work with anyone.

Browns,34vjjt,Coniuratos,1 point,Tue May 5 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Sort-of-Devil's-advocate: it's one thing to wade into the ""lolbrowns"" fray and try to stand up for your team using facts and good arguments about the state of the franchise.  It's a totally different thing to go in and start crying about ""lolbrowns"" (even though I'm sure I've been guilty of doing that myself at some point).  Let's be honest.  /r/NFL kind of sucks.  It's not as bad as /r/NBA, but it's too big to be a good community without iron-fisted mods.  There's good football talk on /r/NFLRoundTable and there's great draft talk on /r/NFL_Draft.  The majority of /r/NFL is just jokes, memes, dumb questions, and circle-jerks."
Browns,34vjjt,youwithme,3,Tue May 5 01:01:33 2015 UTC,"Defending them with facts and good arguments is one thing, the lolbrowns shit is something entirely different in my eyes. Even the term ""lolbrowns"" makes me want to cringe. Oh, and nothing is worse than r/NBA as a Cavs fan. Nothing."

Browns,34vjjt,TucanJamz,-3,Tue May 5 14:53:27 2015 UTC,the problem is the new influx of browns fans that came with johnny (which hey i don't mind a broader fan base). however they're the ones with the loudest voices and acting like they understand the full cycle of being part of the browns. for now they just need to sit and watch and not act like they represent the larger group of true fans.

Browns,34vjjt,youwithme,5,Tue May 5 00:55:23 2015 UTC,"By that logic, I'd say we were a Danny Shelton or a Cameron Erving away from winning a super bowl, and we got both without trading any picks. Our lines breaking down last season was a bigger reason we lost games than QB play. The horrors of Manziel's first start against Cincinnati was amplified by the fact that we couldn't run the ball and Jeremy Hill hit the whip in the endzone like 50 times."
Browns,34vjjt,Resident_Wizard,5,Tue May 5 03:00:14 2015 UTC,"This. Everyone was so fucking quick to throw Manziel under the bus based upon his play with a swiss cheese offensive line and an offensive coordinator trying to kill him.   There's more that he could of done to be prepared without a doubt, but placing the blame entirely on him is foolish."
Browns,34vjjt,shitbeer,0,Tue May 5 00:14:59 2015 UTC,No but they were a QB away from being watchable. The offense is going to be disgusting.
Browns,34vjjt,wouldland,3,Tue May 5 00:56:14 2015 UTC,"Did you click on the ""I'm sick of negativity thread"" just to be negative? Haha"
Browns,34vjjt,fireeight,3,Tue May 5 12:44:42 2015 UTC,Well the other option is to give up the farm for the flashiest of picks to appease those idiots.  It's a no win situation on the Browns offseason front.  We need to pull out some quality wins to shut em up.
Browns,34vjjt,Taurath,4,Tue May 5 14:24:42 2015 UTC,"I know this is a positive thread and I'm all on board the Pettine/Farmer wagon, but I have a serious question...  What if we go, say, 4-12 next year? I mean, you know half the fan base would be screaming for Pettine to be fired. Is that just me being conditioned to expect to lose a coach every 2 years or so? I really hope we give Pettine, and even Farmer, at least these next two seasons no matter what. Ideally, the next three or four seasons no matter what. I really think they know what they're doing and are getting this thing moving in the right direction. I just would hate to see a terrible year derail all the support for Pettine."
Browns,34vjjt,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Mon May 4 22:56:23 2015 UTC,"we have to give it a chance of at least 4 years to let them work out the kinks and get the right players in no doubt. but i think we slightly overachieved by all expectations last year and it'll be tough to replicate that again this year. i mean just look at the schedule it is absolutely brutal. AFC and NFC west going to places like seattle and KC is crazy, not to mention the standard AFC north brutality. i think the fans are aware it takes time and hopefully will be patient this year as long as we stay competitive and keep moving forward"
Browns,34vjjt,Taurath,1 point,Tue May 5 01:52:30 2015 UTC,"No matter what, if you go 4-12 there will be grumbling, but I think how much depends on the competitiveness of the team. Are they getting blown out every game? Scoring some touchdowns and playing at least average D, but still losing the close games?  If that is a fair assessment, then I can't imagine there would be major changes in the front office or coaching staff."
Browns,34vjjt,PabstyLoudmouth,1 point,Tue May 5 04:15:25 2015 UTC,exactly and as long as we build around the qb position with the right kind of pieces then we can elevate an average qb to better things (and wins) while finally turning this franchise around.

Browns,34zbaj,Abiv23,6,Tue May 5 20:40:01 2015 UTC,"He's definitely a talented runner, but the question is... can he play WR? Catching a ball is pretty much second nature to anyone that has been on the football field before, but catching in traffic, running routes, blocking, and having the necessary skills and training to throw off defenders is not exactly a quick thing to learn. He certainly has the athleticism to play some position in the NFL, but I doubt his skill is there at another position."

Browns,34w8fo,Nightcinder,16,Tue May 5 01:56:08 2015 UTC,"I listened to this on the radio. Pettine was talking about experience and how it plays out on the field. They asked if it was safe to assume that Mccown was #1 headed into camp, and Pettine said that you could assume that. He's just giving the benefit to the guy who's got more experience at the moment. It's not Josh's to lose, it's his headed into camp by default with experience... HUGE difference than he's the starter week 1."
Browns,34w8fo,blackedout,11,Tue May 5 03:00:14 2015 UTC,"Almost word-for-word what he said around this time last year. Pettine highly values experience. This can be seen by bringing in guys like Dansby, Whitner, and even Starks this year.   Then there is also the fact that inexperienced QBs tend to make more mistakes, and he wants to play classic safe, smashmouth football where ball security is high priority."
Browns,34w8fo,Mustang1718,2,Tue May 5 04:48:27 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, but that's where I disagree with Pettine. If we keep to this theory, then we'll never break in a new quarterback, Manziel or not."

Browns,34w8fo,stampylives,26,Tue May 5 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"He's the favorite entering training camp. Big difference.  After Manziel's performance last season, I could be favored. I'm taking this with a grain of salt."
Browns,34w8fo,PleasureBox,2,Tue May 5 02:06:59 2015 UTC,Have you ever drunkenly rode a swan float? This is very important in their decision making.
Browns,34w8fo,barryho,9,Tue May 5 13:26:22 2015 UTC,"The full article by MKC clearly stated McCown is favored going into training camp, not the regular season."
Browns,34w8fo,Spartan_55,17,Tue May 5 02:43:05 2015 UTC,"I think at this point Pettine is in wait and see mode with Manziel. If he continues to work his ass off the way he seems to be doing post rehab I can't imagine McCown being the starter. Simply because we know McCown is not good. Obviously if Manziel's behavior regresses, or looks downright inept McCown gets the start. Pettine is doing the right thing making Manziel earn it. He's been handed everything he will grow up a lot of he has to earn the starting job."
Browns,34w8fo,debtsetradio,10,Tue May 5 02:09:40 2015 UTC,"This. Assuming Manziel has in fact worked super hard since rehab and continues to do so, he's gonna be the day 1 starter. Farmer not drafting a QB tells me they're gonna give Manziel this year to earn the starting QB job long term.   Remember, Johnny was a 1st rounder for a reason. People can hate on him, but he has undeniable talent. So unless he reverts to Pre-rehab Johnny Football, I'm pretty confident he'll beat out McCown."
Browns,34w8fo,Godszn,1 point,Tue May 5 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"Not even the most jaded Manziel haters can deny his physical skills and football IQ. It's all a head game with him. If he gets his head out of his ass and gives 100%, there's nothing stopping him from becoming a solid starter. Maybe never an elite, top five QB, but sort of a Kapernick, or Flacco level guy that might not carry the team himself, but can win a lot of games with a good supporting cast (which I'd argue that he has)."
Browns,34w8fo,Marzman315,7,Tue May 5 18:40:25 2015 UTC,"This basically tells me that this starting job is Manziel's to acquire. McCown is the favorite entering training camp, which means that Manziel has to come out and ball. I don't think it's McCown's to lose - I think it's Manziel's to win, and there's a big difference there."
Browns,34w8fo,VonJaeger,3,Tue May 5 02:48:45 2015 UTC,That's exactly how I took it.
Browns,34w8fo,blackedout,2,Tue May 5 03:00:53 2015 UTC,"Even if he is better I don't see how him starting at all is a positive for us. Unless he can lead us to the playoffs and get this team used to winning, I think him playing delays our progress. Having him lead the browns to a 6-10 record vs let's say a 3-13 record from manziel would be a negative in my eyes. Start Johnny so we can get a good look at what he is capable of. If he shows promise then great we have something, and if not maybe we can actually be in position to target a truly high level prospect, which we have not done since couch."
Browns,34w8fo,Putuinurplace,10,Tue May 5 02:48:19 2015 UTC,"However, telling Johnny ""Hey it's your job, have fun"". Is really fucking stupid."
Browns,34w8fo,Daviroth,1 point,Tue May 5 03:45:37 2015 UTC,I agree with that
Browns,34w8fo,Putuinurplace,5,Tue May 5 14:08:48 2015 UTC,Even if they plan on having Manziel start they need to make sure he earns it.
Browns,34w8fo,miked1be,8,Tue May 5 04:23:12 2015 UTC,It's obviously Manziels job to lose. They just want him to work hard.
Browns,34w8fo,ChairyCweed,2,Tue May 5 02:27:01 2015 UTC,"That's how I see it. A little extra motivation for someone that shouldn't need any more motivation than what he already has, but that's all it is. The best QB will start the season and he's letting everyone know they have to rise to challenge and prove they're ready to start.   Pettine is really good at trying to get the most out of everyone it seems. He doesn't mince words and he'll try to convince you it's all or nothing. A lot of young players need that motivation and drive."
Browns,34w8fo,demolitio4,2,Tue May 5 03:49:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. They want to provide him with as much motivation as they can. If Pettine were to say 'Manziel is our qb no matter what' what's to stop Manziel from halting his progress. We all hope Manziel can get back to 'wreck this league' mode.
Browns,34w8fo,youreeffed,2,Tue May 5 04:13:19 2015 UTC,McCown is 36 and will be retired in a year or two. What possible upside is there to starting this guy?
Browns,34w8fo,Dustin65,10,Tue May 5 02:22:05 2015 UTC,Not handing the job to a guy who hasn't earned it just because the alternative sucks. It's better for team morale in the long run when your hardest workers are rewarded. If Manziel doesn't continue to work hard the players will recognize it. And if is handed the starting job with a poor work ethic that will harm Pettine's credibility in the long run.
Browns,34w8fo,debtsetradio,3,Tue May 5 02:42:15 2015 UTC,"I think we all should have learned our lessons with this last year to trust Pettine and Farmer's decision.   Hoyer flat out was the worst QB playing for 4 games in a row last year after only being passable for the first 9 games and all most the entire fan base was screaming for Manziel. We were wrong, Pettine was holding back making what we thought was a smart decision because they know who should be starting."
Browns,34w8fo,bearsdriving,-5,Tue May 5 12:04:24 2015 UTC,"Even if he does work hard, you're making some sort of assumption that it will make him good.  There are a ton of guys who work really hard who never pan out.  He has to actually be a good pro style QB who can make reads and call an offense.   This is why McCown is favored going forward.  Work ethic is the baseline.  That shouldn't even have to be questioned.  What will get him to start is to actually be good at QB.  Pettine doesn't want to have his team embarrassed."
Browns,34w8fo,djroomba322,3,Tue May 5 11:27:21 2015 UTC,I'm assuming a hard working Manziel is worth starting over any 36 year old journeyman QB who's most recent season netted his team the Number One Overall pick. There's a huge gap between good and worth starting based on upside because the alternative is a proven liability on the downside of his career.
Browns,34w8fo,debtsetradio,2,Tue May 5 12:42:18 2015 UTC,Trying to light a fire under Manziel's ass. Not a bad idea.
Browns,34w8fo,enigmaticevil,2,Tue May 5 16:07:43 2015 UTC,This would be such a disappointment...WE WANT JOHNNY
Browns,34w8fo,dbauer0706,8,Tue May 5 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"Erhm... uh.... I think the chant would be better if it went...  WE WANT THE BEST QB ON OUR ROSTER TO BE OUR STARTER!!  Not necessarily excluding johnny, but not de facto picking him either. Everything must be earned."
Browns,34w8fo,Brokewood,1 point,Tue May 5 03:34:30 2015 UTC,Honestly I would rather de facto pick Johnny than watch Josh McCown be the starter for us :/

Browns,34w8fo,tomchaney479,5,Tue May 5 03:03:48 2015 UTC,I don't get why this sub thinks one of the QB's in the 2016 draft is gonna be good
Browns,34w8fo,meyer_33_09,2,Tue May 5 03:05:26 2015 UTC,Same. I'm not that high on any of the top 2016 guys (Jones/Hack/Cook). I'd rather fill in other areas of need early and take a chance on a guy in a later round.
Browns,34w8fo,Daviroth,2,Tue May 5 12:37:00 2015 UTC,I'm extremely skeptical of it. I don't really want anyone. Hackenberg and Cook are not that good. Cardale is NOT ready to be an NFL QB. Not even close.  It's looking like a scary QB class to me.
Browns,34w8fo,deputydon,1 point,Tue May 5 03:44:48 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Cardale isn't ready, he seems more ready than Manziel was last year, and is still an entire season away from needing to be ready.   Cardale has one thing going for him right off the bat. Size. He's a big boy, unlike Manziel. He's 6'5"" 250 lbs. That is almost identical to Cam Newton.   I'd also argue that he's shown he's able to be a clutch player when the pressure is on him. I'll give Ohio State's success to mainly Ezekiel Elliot, as he rushed for an average of 232 yards with 8 touchdowns the last three games of the season, but I actually think Cardale doesn't get enough credit for the things he did do right.  People point out his accuracy issues and completion percentage. Why?   Against Wisconsin he had a 70.1% CMP% with 3 TDs.  Against Alabama, arguably the best defense in college football, he had a 51.4 CMP% which is rather bad, but he made the deep throws, limited interceptions, and won the game.   And vs Oregon he had a 69.6 CMP%   And between these three games he averaged 247 passing yards per game.   I'd also say that due to his size, he's more durable than a guy like Manziel, and as evidenced by those three games, he can still run and even power through some defenders. He has a cannon that proved to be pretty accurate, he showed pocket awareness and really only went mobile when he felt the pocket start to collapse.   For reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLCV_znK73E Start watching at the 2:05 mark. He see's the defender get past his blocker, realizes the pocket has collapsed and takes off, breaks a tackle and gets the first down. Next play shows his size and strength as a defender tries to block him and Cardale just plows through him.  The play at 2:24 is yet another example, pocket collapses, he takes off, plows through a defender after getting the first down. And then my favorite example is at 3:08. The pocket starts to collapse but he keeps looking down field waiting for Smith to get open, he takes a few steps forward to dodge the defense, takes off to his right and launches it down field with perfect accuracy. Watch his head. He constantly is looking down field, but shows great pocket awareness and vision.   Would he be ready to be an NFL starter immediately? Probably not. Ohio State doesn't run a pro style offense. But he showed he has the size, the arm, the accuracy, the patience, and awareness to become an NFL QB. And I'd argue that Pettine's Power Run offense is easier to learn and adjust to than say a complex Bruce Arians' offense."
Browns,34w8fo,Daviroth,2,Tue May 5 07:25:15 2015 UTC,"I never compared Cardale to Manziel at all, so I have no idea why you brought that up. Nonetheless here goes.  First off Ohio State's success in the post season, after Barrett went down should be attributed mostly to the defense. They were absolute trash all year, and played like the best defense in college football the last 3 games. They won us those championships, secondarily is Zeke IMHO.  No one complains about his completion percentage, they complain about his accuracy. These things are not mutually exclusive ESPECIALLY in college football.  You also don't have to send me clips, I watched every single game OSU has played in the last 3 years as I attended OSU. Cardale's problems are not with his arm, size, or instinct to move out of the pocket. Cardale's problems are with thinking like a QB. He showed almost no ability to read a defense, in just about any way. That is what matters. They can be big and strong and know when to run all they want, but if they can't throw the ball where it is supposed to be then it doesn't matter.  Now that we have had that talk I'll bring up Manziel since you seem intent on bringing him into this. Manziel showed the ability to adjust reads, scramble when needed, and throw every pass asked of him in college. He thought like a QB, didn't have accuracy issues, and went beyond his #1 receiver often. The one and only thing Cardale has on Manziel right now is size, that's literally it. Cardale is not very far along in his quarterback progression, it is why I think JT will win the job. JT can play the QB position, Cardale can just not fuck it all up."

Browns,34w8fo,tomchaney479,0,Tue May 5 12:44:00 2015 UTC,"The difference in winning 5 or 6 games (as Vegas has projected) and 2 or 3 games is quite large when it comes to the draft. 5/6 wins means you're drafting ~7-11 while 2/3 wins means you're picking top 3 and likely 1st.  First off, it's a fool's errand to project QBs one year out - we don't know who will emerge (e.g., bortles, RG3, tannehill, etc.) and who will fall (e.g., bridgewater, etc.)  Second, even if no QB is worth selecting top 3, we could always trade down, pick up multiple future firsts, and take best QB available later in the first.    Like the NBA, winning 5-8 games in the NFL is the worst place to be - not good enough to contend but not bad enough to get a difference maker top 3.  That's one reason (in addition to poor drafting) that we've been stuck in mediocrity for years."

And you know, not burn bridges for absolutely no reason, as there isn't any good reason for her to say this in the first place.  As a Browns fan, I never had any interest in this kid. As a football fan, I'm completely confused why she thinks Miami is going to be a great fit for her son. As a person, I hope the kid has a blast and a great career, and I hope he can learn a way to muzzle his mom. (I'm betting buying her a house might work.)"

Where here we are in year 3? of a 5 year rebuild, state taxes and you're going to miss all of your escalators for performance.     If this is just a Browns circlejerk thread, just say that in the beginning.  Otherwise we should be exploring why this thing continually happens. We should be discussing the ways to make us an organization who people on offense actually want to play for.

No one was grading him as a can't miss prospect: there were route running concerns and he hadn't proved he could withstand the physicality of pro coverage. Put down the pitchfork.  You know why a GM might list personality reasons as a downside after picking Johnny Manziel and Justin Gilbert? Because he saw them not reach their potential last year and learned his lesson!

Browns,34too9,TheMightyCupcake,2,Mon May 4 16:50:41 2015 UTC,My g/f got me a Manziel jersey for Christmas.  I made her send it back.  Am I a bad person? Lol.
Browns,34too9,ColombianHugLord,3,Mon May 4 21:43:18 2015 UTC,My brother and I bought one for my dad this last Christmas. He sent it back for store credit. I think he's going to get  Shelton jersey now.
Browns,34too9,rlriii13,2,Mon May 4 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"I bought 3 new-style Joe Haden jerseys. After buying a Colt McCoy and Trent Richardson, I was sick of losing. I think Haden is gonna be around for a while."
Browns,34too9,goshish,5,Mon May 4 14:29:37 2015 UTC,"I bought a Cribbs jersey a while back and I just bought a Joe Haden. If I wanted to play it safe, I'd buy a Joe Thomas jersey because he's been here long enough and played well enough that he'll be a Browns legend forever, regardless of if he ever leaves the team or not. With Cribbs I feel like his career here warrants wearing his jersey with pride whenever I want."
Browns,34too9,Kylekub,8,Mon May 4 15:44:39 2015 UTC,Cribbs is solid.  No problem there. I got lucky and got a Thomas jersey when we drafted him.  No way could I have ever expected he would be with us as long as he has.
Browns,34too9,TheMightyCupcake,3,Mon May 4 15:48:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Those three players are jersey-worthy imo, and I'd add Dawson to the list too, even though kicker jerseys aren't super hot, and he plays for SF now.  I own Sipe and Kosar jerseys I love wearing, but I also own Couch, Frye and Garcia jerseys, which I only break out to be an ironic asshole. I'm personally done with Browns QB jerseys until we have one that can start three years in a row.  ...and I still think Frye could of actually been a decent QB in this league, if he ever had anyone that took the time to polish him up :/"
Browns,34too9,GRunner6S,4,Mon May 4 20:22:20 2015 UTC,3 of the same player seems like a little much...
Browns,34ts0t,dayflyer55,24,Mon May 4 14:28:24 2015 UTC,"Kind of funny when people say we have a huge wide receiver problem too. While I feel we could be better, our biggest issue at WR was when Gordon came BACK from the suspension, before that we were fine and didn't try to force it to anyone"
Browns,34ts0t,BMC4,15,Mon May 4 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"This is important.  Hoyer targeted Gordon way too much, and Gordon appeared to just not give a shit.    Our receiving corps may not be flashy, but on paper it's even- if not slightly better than last year.  That being said, so is McCown.  So, if he and our WRs are only equal to last year, we haven't regressed.  If Johnny has progressed, then we can throw the ball a lot better.  Then again, I think we're going to just shove the ball down opponents throats by running it.    I see the Browns over all haven't regressed, maybe stayed the same, if not improved."
Browns,34ts0t,DocMichaels,2,Mon May 4 14:44:56 2015 UTC,"Just a little statistical analysis:  Atlanta- First game back: 8 catches, 120 yards, 16 targets (By far his best)  Buffalo- : 7 catches, 75 yards, 13 targets (Again, not great reception:target ratio)  Indy: 2 catches, 15 yards, 7 targets (Clearly forcing it to him, yet another game with the most targets on the team)  Cincy: 3 catches, 48 yards, 4 targets (Johnny's first game)  Carolina: 4 catches, 4 yards, 7 targets  So in 5 games, Josh averaged 4.8 catches and 9.4 targets per game. Not that good"
Browns,34ts0t,BMC4,0,Mon May 4 14:55:00 2015 UTC,"Yes,..?  I guess you're agreeing with what I was saying?   I think our corps now, and our corps pre-Gordon  ""return"", are relatively comparable."
Browns,34ts0t,DocMichaels,5,Mon May 4 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just showing that Gordon in his 5 games got targeted nearly 10 times per game when our next highest receiver (and most productive) had like 7 per game  I was agreeing with you about him getting targeted too much"
Browns,34ts0t,BMC4,-1,Mon May 4 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"The problem wasn't that we were forcing him the ball, the problem was that Hoyer couldn't get it to him, and time after time he was wide open deep and the ball fell incomplete 10 yards away.  Josh Gordon is no angel but the blame for last year's collapse lies with Shanahan and Hoyer."
Browns,34ts0t,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Mon May 4 21:22:02 2015 UTC,"So true.  And our #1 receiver last year is going to be our #3 receiver this year.  Even though we didn't get a young stud, we picked up some BIG, sure handed possession receivers."
Browns,34ts0t,fuckingbrowns,4,Mon May 4 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"Even though we didn't get a young stud, we picked up some BIG, sure handed possession receivers.   Who? Bowe and Hartline had drop rates of 7.78% and 8.06%, respectively. I'd rather have Hawkins and Gabriel in there, drop rates of 6.35% and 5.63%, respectively."
Browns,34ts0t,Nerdlinger,5,Mon May 4 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"OK, OK, well they're big at least.  Either way, I feel confident enough that we can put three competent receivers on the field at any time."
Browns,34ts0t,math-yoo,29,Mon May 4 15:13:19 2015 UTC,I'll believe it when I see it.
Browns,34ts0t,debtsetradio,3,Mon May 4 14:33:33 2015 UTC,I'll believe it when I see it is the /r/browns karma train or what?
Browns,34ts0t,R101C,13,Mon May 4 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"We can definitely average 3 points per game on offense, with this defense that should be plenty enough to win."
Browns,34ts0t,Pissflaps69,1 point,Mon May 4 14:48:00 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking the defense will score 2-7 a game. Probably get nearly a fg a week without having to move the sticks. Throw in 6-12 from the offense on their worst day and we could be starting at a lot of 15-6 victories. Like a crazy baseball game every week. And if the offense does put something together and the d can pin it's ears back and go, it could be very fun to watch."
Browns,34ts0t,R101C,2,Mon May 4 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"There aren't a lot of NFL offenses that we'll hold to 6 pts.  Just bc we refused to take receivers doesn't mean the rest of the league followed suit.  If we don't score 20-30 pts a game, were usually going to lose."
Browns,34ts0t,Witness_My_Greatness,1 point,Tue May 5 11:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they gave up 21 a game last year. Realistically, if the offense is any better at all, and the defense should be better, 20 points should win at least a handful of games. The defense made 7-10 points easy pickings nearly every week last year. My point being, this isn't a team that needs 35 a week in a track meet to win games."
Browns,34ts0t,MercilessMizzou,-2,Tue May 5 12:17:27 2015 UTC,In Cundiff we trust. /s
Browns,34ts0t,fuckingbrowns,10,Mon May 4 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I put a lot of that on Shannahan. In the beginning of the season his play calling was amazing."
Browns,34ts0t,blackedout,12,Mon May 4 14:42:45 2015 UTC,"He was terrible at making adjustments. Mack aside, teams were privy to the playaction passing game by week 6. I can't get over the fact that he called 8 sweeps towards JJ Watt when he was matched up against Schwartz."
Browns,34ts0t,TapedeckNinja,9,Mon May 4 14:56:56 2015 UTC,"To me, that showed that he was an arrogant head case. ""No one can beat my play calling! Not even JJ Watt!"" Who does that?"
Browns,34ts0t,TapedeckNinja,7,Mon May 4 15:24:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like Kyle Shanahan is going to be a really good coach someday, if he can just get past that know-it-all approach to the game.  Reminds me of kids who come out of college and enter the workplace and think they know everything."
Browns,34ts0t,TapedeckNinja,2,Mon May 4 15:59:54 2015 UTC,Well everything is easier when you can dominate the line of scrimmage on offense.
Browns,34ts0t,tribe98reloaded,5,Mon May 4 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"We'll see, but The Duke could be an interesting pass-catching weapon out of the backfield.  He's a good complement to our other guys, who are primarily between-the-tackles runners.  I hope The Duke or another of our picks makes an impact in the return game, because we were 20th in average starting field position last year, and improving that could actually make a real difference for our offense (Seattle was 4th, New England was 2nd, Cincy was 7th, Denver was 9th)."
Browns,34ts0t,Manhigh,3,Mon May 4 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"Benjamin has just been god awful in the return game.  I don't know what we do with him from here on out.  Do you just use him strictly to run go routes on offense (he runs a 4.36)?  Do you hope that focusing on just punts or kicks makes him more productive?  Do you cut him?  The duke seems to have an ideal skill set for punt returning, although I'm not sure he did in college.  I guess time will tell."
Browns,34ts0t,MuricaLite,9,Mon May 4 15:23:55 2015 UTC,I won't be surprised if Benjamin gets cut.
Browns,34ts0t,TapedeckNinja,3,Mon May 4 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"I hope they do. He's not a good wide receiver, and he was so bad at kick returns this past year that Duke will be at least as good as him. So, there's really no reason to have him on the team."
Browns,34ts0t,battle_squid,2,Mon May 4 15:40:31 2015 UTC,"He had a clutch game winning catch, and stripped that intercepted pass.  He's got a lot of heart.  Problem is that he, Hawkins, and Gabriel are all smaller receivers.  Hawkins is better outright and Gabriel is a better long term prospect.  Benjamin was an amazing returner but he lost his mojo there.  Some team will pick him up, there's just no role for him on this one I think."
Browns,34ts0t,Mike_Shanahan,1 point,Tue May 5 12:33:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. The Mayne takes  the #5 receiving spot after Bowe, Hartline, Hawkins and Gabriel."
Browns,34ts0t,fuckingbrowns,1 point,Mon May 4 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"I think we carried 6 WRs on the active roster last year, so I suppose we could keep Benjamin but I'd rather give a shot to one of the UDFAs."

Browns,34ts0t,themitey1,5,Tue May 5 01:24:08 2015 UTC,"Before Mack went down, all of the defenses we beat were bad."
Browns,34ts0t,TapedeckNinja,2,Mon May 4 14:40:59 2015 UTC,"Erving looked competent when he played LT, but not great. While I think he'll push Schwartz for the starting job at RT, I'm not convinced he'll usurp the position. Per PFF, Greco was the 11th best guard in the league, so I'm pretty sure his job will be safe. Erving played his best ball at center, but I doubt he's better than Mack. Erving was a very good move for the long term success of this team, but I just don't see him contributing much this year if the line stays healthy."
Browns,34ts0t,qck11,3,Mon May 4 14:44:41 2015 UTC,"And if you look at what this team was able to do when mack was healthy, he probably doesn't need to.  That's why I think either the Browns love this guy enough where they feel comfortable letting Mack walk next year, or they feel like he can beat out schwartz for the RT spot.  But I also guess OL injuries are pretty common, and it helps tremendously to have a 6th man that you can literally put anywhere.  But I still kind of feel like the browns wouldn't have taken him at 19 if they felt like he couldn't be a starter at RT."
Browns,34ts0t,wickedshxt,1 point,Mon May 4 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"If Mack is going to walk for certain, I would trade him now.   Better to reap some talent back."
Browns,34ts0t,Mike_Shanahan,4,Mon May 4 16:13:12 2015 UTC,Can't.  He has a no trade clause.
Browns,34ts0t,Witness_My_Greatness,1 point,Mon May 4 16:27:08 2015 UTC,We can trade him if he agrees to it.  Lane Adkins reported that someone called about acquiring him during the draft.
Browns,34ts0t,Mike_Shanahan,0,Mon May 4 16:53:04 2015 UTC,Doesn't mean you can't bench him.  See if he'll consent to a trade then?
Browns,34ts0t,Pissflaps69,6,Mon May 4 16:52:27 2015 UTC,He's not going to be traded if we bench him....he would sit on his ass. Get paid. Make us look like complete idiots. Then walk next year and have a year less of wear on his body.
Browns,34ts0t,fuuuuuuuuuuuck216,0,Mon May 4 17:01:06 2015 UTC,I disagree.. guys want to prove their worth before they negotiate a new contract.  But it's a silly scenario regardless.

This is the first time since Kosar that I actually like the FO, the coach, and the team.  Fingers crossed about Johnny, because if we had a solid known-quantity at QB we'd be really scary."

Browns,34tho8,Cleveland_man,1 point,Mon May 4 13:54:23 2015 UTC,My problem is I read about the team so much that I just start beliving what they are saying about the picks. I fall for it every year no regrets this was an excelllent draft.
Browns,34tho8,revamp11,10,Mon May 4 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"Raymond Bosak has this to say:   Despite my grumblings over the three days, I feel the Browns did a great job fixing the issues on the defensive side. Yes, I would have like for Farmer to draft a quarterback or a top-tier receiver. However, the Browns had the 32nd ranked run defense and their pass rush left little to be desired. Johnny Manziel will have to get his head on straight, and judging by the comments by Joe Thomas during workouts, Manziel has turned a corner. The additions of Brian Hartline and Dwayne Bowe did improve this group of receivers, and I lost sight of that.  All of us did.  We are so starved for a superstar that we can’t see that there is an immense group of talent on this roster already. We want a winner so bad that we are willing to cast out a quarterback and coach after two years, instead of letting them gel and form some chemistry together. I know that’s a stark difference of my view of Manziel as of late, but fact of the matter is that he IS our quarterback. This disturbing trend of someone new every two years has gotten real old, real fast.  So let’s calm down and support the team. They listen to, and see everything we say on the radio and social media. If the players know they aren’t supoprted, they won’t win games. I’m just as tired as you with the losing and suffering. I’m just as tired of watching the Ravens, Steelers and Bengals make the playoffs every year. So relax, and enjoy this one. These guys may suprise you. I guarantee it.   This is pretty much how I feel about things."
Browns,34tho8,JohnnyFire,5,Mon May 4 15:23:51 2015 UTC,"I still stand where I did way back at the beginning of the offseason jibbery joo. 6-10 or 7-9.  That's not going back and slamming the Browns. There are still things that are missing on this team (Namely, depth at FS, a true top-tier TE in spite of investing high late in the draft, a true stud WR1, and, possibly, QB) from helping them move to the next level, and they aren't exactly getting a cake-walk schedule. So yeah, I'm not expecting a Super Bowl. What I am expecting is that things take a jump in the right direction; that you see the defense start adopting this ""play like a Brown"" mentality full tilt, that the media starts looking at units for Cleveland (RB's, DT's, secondary) as potentially dangerous, that Mike Pettine and Ray Farmer are on the same page and making the Browns move from a joke to a potential contender heading into 2016 if all is going the right way.  Fixing a franchise with one or two bad seasons can happen in one year; fixing a franchise that has been wreaked with past mistakes can take a while. All I want is to enter 2016 feeling like the process is at hand; that we are close, so close that we could finally say ""Yeah, that WR, or that QB, or that TE, or that LB, they take us to the next level."""

So i don't get excited about anything except a W anymore. As much as sports don't matter in grand scheme of things it does wear on you when you get let down so often by something. My prediction for this season is 6 wins but if Manziel shows everyone he can actually play professional football the ceiling could be 10-11.
Browns,34tho8,Ne007,2,Mon May 4 14:29:06 2015 UTC,I don't ask for a winning season.   I ask for stability and tradition please.
Browns,34tho8,SaintDemure,2,Mon May 4 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"I'm very confident with the defensive additions but I do worry we won't be able to score enough points down the stretch. McCown isn't capable of repeating what he did in 2013. Let's remember he had 2 of the best receivers in the NFL making him look much better than he actually was. Johnny is still unknown and we have no idea if he has the ability to lead. I believe our defense will be a force, though I'm cautiously semi-optimistic as far the the offense is concerned. With our strength of schedule, I don't see us winning more than 6 games but of course I hope I'm wrong."
Browns,34tho8,dayflyer55,4,Mon May 4 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"Before alex mack was injured we were averaging 25 points/game. With the defense we have this year, that should be enough."

Browns,34tho8,ColombianHugLord,2,Mon May 4 14:12:15 2015 UTC,"I'm rarely pessimistic about this team. The only times I've not been excited about it were with Pat Shurmur and with Eric Mangini as the head coaches. I really liked the team with Chud at the head and was disappointed by his firing.  That being said, I am very optimistic about this team. I really like what we were able to do last season and I love the pieces we're adding. We still have a big question mark at QB and I'm not going to assume that Johnny Manziel will be the answer for us, but we are building a foundation for a strong running game and a strong defense, and that's a great way to build a team. Look at Pittsburgh and Baltimore: that's exactly what they've done and they've accounted for 5 Super Bowl appearances in the last 15 years."
Browns,34tho8,debtsetradio,1 point,Mon May 4 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"I'm optimistic every year by the start of the season. I manage to convince myself everything is going to work out, every player is going to set up etc. I'm not changing this year. Go Browns."
Browns,34tho8,Illinois_Jones,1 point,Mon May 4 13:54:40 2015 UTC,We went 7-9 last year with what I consider to be a worse lineup on both sides than we are going to have this year. Last year was also the first year for our head coach and GM. That after getting no more than 5 wins for how many straight seasons? I don't see what we have to be pessimistic about

Browns,34rkr0,dayflyer55,16,Mon May 4 16:12:42 2015 UTC,The AFC North as a whole had really good drafts. Looks like it will stay a bloodbath for years to come.
Browns,34rkr0,Campesinoslive,5,Sun May 3 23:42:05 2015 UTC,"I'm iffy on the Bengals, but that point does stand. It isn't like teams got worse in this draft.  We're praying Perriman is gonna be at Greg Little level of drops, Pittsburgh's evident defensive transition doesn't do anything for Dupree, and the Bengals going with a large number of luxury picks comes back to bite them with all their primetime games.  It would be very nice to at least end this year with the feeling that we still have the window open."
Browns,34rkr0,VonJaeger,2,Mon May 4 00:00:02 2015 UTC,"Cincinnati's draft makes more sense when you consider the fact that both of their tackles are FAs next year and the one - Whitworth - is going to be 34 in December. They're a good enough team that they can afford to take two straight future tackles. Everyone else has very high ceilings / are extremely productive players. Cincinnati doesn't have a bunch of needs, so they just kinda focused on taking the best players out there and they did a good job of that.  As for Baltimore, I'm hoping that Perriman's hands remain as bad in the pros as they did in college - even at his worst, Greg Little's highest drop percentage was like 11% - Perriman had something like 14% last year or some ridiculous number. Also hoping that Carl Davis just stays constantly inconsistent.  I can see Pittsburgh's draft either being very boom or very bust. Obviously hoping it'll be shitty. They're going to have nothing in terms of a pass rush this year though unless Jarvis Jones somehow decides he wants to play pro football."
Browns,34rkr0,Ihateloops,2,Mon May 4 05:17:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like Perriman is this year's wide receiver who comes out of nowhere, flies up draft boards, then busts, a la Troy Williamson and Darrius Heyward-Bey. At least I hope so, now that he's a Raven."

I have watched every Oregon game for the past 3 years and I truly believe he will be a starting cornerback when he is 100%. He is the steal of the draft for sure and if not for that injury he would have been a top 3 CB in this draft class.
Browns,34rkr0,Doyle524,1 point,Mon May 4 03:50:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, if Ifo isn't hurt, you gotta believe he's a top 20 prospect. So if he can get healthy, we'll have picked 8 of the top 100."
Browns,34rkr0,workaccount202,1 point,Mon May 4 07:42:04 2015 UTC,"He is definitely worth the gamble.  But if he'll ever be 100% again is completely up in the air.

Browns,34rx1h,Godszn,13,Mon May 4 02:16:19 2015 UTC,Exactly. Nose tackles job is to not move most the time. By that I mean don't get pushed around.
Browns,34rx1h,kpyle,2,Mon May 4 03:18:42 2015 UTC,Farmer even said he was happy Shelton's 40 time was slow because it meant he'd have a better chance of getting him for the Browns.
Browns,34rx1h,miked1be,2,Mon May 4 14:02:11 2015 UTC,Does a nose tackle even run 40 yds in an ENTIRE GAME (not counting running on and off the sideline)?  I wouldn't be surprised if they don't.
Browns,34rx1h,dayflyer55,1 point,Mon May 4 15:47:14 2015 UTC,"40 time is such a BS stat.  its not a realistic distance, its not a realistic style of running for the NFL and how often is a guy going to be running in a strait line unobstructed for 40 yrds?  its even more useless for a guy like a DT.  its just a metric people use to differentiate one guy from another with all other things being equal.  it has some value but its all relative to position and frankly overstated in value most of the time."

Browns,34rx1h,dayflyer55,3,Mon May 4 14:06:35 2015 UTC,"Man you guys are seriously going to have a terrifying defense. I think Haden has been really good, but with an improved pass rush he could be lights out."
Browns,34rx1h,LordBridgewater,1 point,Mon May 4 15:43:02 2015 UTC,My main concern with Shelton is his production versus avg teams versus his production against small school fodder. It was something like 4 tackles and 0.25 sacks versus 11 tackles and 2.5 sacks(per game). If Taylor stays healthy and plays 50-65% of the downs I bet we see a fresh Shelton on some passing downs. The dude is a good one gap penetrator now. He'll probably be even better once he drops down to 315-320
Browns,34rx1h,subhuman1,1 point,Mon May 4 14:31:14 2015 UTC,I don't think he will ever see a ton of snaps unless he becomes feast mode unleashed one game. People are forgetting we have randy starks a Phil Taylor still on the roster. Yes Phil is banged up but with those 3 rotating snaps to keep a fresh body in there it looks like the plan is to not only terrorize the backfield but tire out the o line. Having a fresh 330lber in the 4th quarter is more dangerous than 2 tired 330lbers.
Browns,34rx1h,tytrim89,1 point,Tue May 5 02:35:51 2015 UTC,"He isn't close to Williams as a pass rusher. I still don't even think he will be a 3 down player, but I hope I'm wrong. College numbers don't mean much, but like I said, I really hope he proves me wrong."
Browns,34rx1h,ChairyCweed,4,Mon May 4 01:46:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it says almost as much about Williams as Shelton. Williams was the ""best, all around"" defender going into the year, and did just enough to not cause anyone to doubt that much. Still, Williams doesn't have that great of a burst off the line, and his pass rushing numbers on 3rd and longs weren't great."
Browns,34rx1h,Deadleggg,1 point,Mon May 4 02:01:13 2015 UTC,Can he n play 3 downs? Yes he played 90+plays against a few teams. Do my teams use that many 3 down linemen? No. He's not going to be there on 3rd and 11 very often but 3rd and less than 6? You betcha.
Browns,34rx1h,goshish,1 point,Mon May 4 12:09:08 2015 UTC,"If he's as disruptive as he looks like he might be, we won't really need him on third downs anyways. I think this kid is going to be lights-out stellar, but I do wonder if he will be up to being an every-down kind of player. Not a lot of people can carry 330 lbs and have that level of stamina."
Browns,34rx1h,Mungina,1 point,Mon May 4 20:16:34 2015 UTC,"why is anyone worried about him as a pass rusher?  that was NOT why he was picked up.  any pass rushing is a bonus as far as im concerned, he is there to clog up the middle and that is something we sorely lacked.  if he can stop the run up the middle i will take that all day every day over a QB hurry up (although id like to see those too)."
Browns,34rz9j,PrimeTimeHoyer,14,Mon May 4 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"This is just the kind of guy to cover huge TEs and come up to put the fear of God in the opposing offensive skill players.

The fault of Sanchez was Rex has fuck all idea how to develop a QB past that.  This illustrates the quintessential point of my position.  You get the right QB with the right experience, they're extremely plug and play and can have immediate impact.  I don't know why you put Rex on here.  He was a pretty good QB who's main fault was always consistency.  And he wasn't remotely a rookie or inexperienced player?  He wasn't elite but he wasn't bad at all."

Browns,34q7lm,djroomba322,9,Sun May 3 19:58:58 2015 UTC,The years Sanchez went the AFC championship his stats were 2009: 54% completion 2400 yards 12 TDS and 2010: 20 INTS and 55% completion 3300 yards 17 TDs and 13 INTS. He definitely improved his second year but you cant say that the QB play really had much to do with those teams success.
Browns,34q7lm,bjbush,-15,Sun May 3 18:03:37 2015 UTC,...  Yes.  You missed the point.  Year 1: QB comes in completely blind to the NFL as a rookie.  Plays within the confines of the system.  Year 2:  Sanchez takes personal lessons ot get up to speed to the NFL.  No development by Rex at all.  Year 3+  caps out similarly to year 2.  Of course he benefited from having a good team.  But it wasn't the good team that got him there.  If Josh McCown is on that team tehy don't make the playoffs.
Browns,34q7lm,djroomba322,6,Sun May 3 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"You said he came in and had an immediate impact and was plug and play so I assumed you meant that he came in and carried them to the playoffs so either I can't read or you are losing track of your own point. That Jets team had the best defense in all of football in 2009. The defense carried them all the way to AFC championship game, all Sanchez did was not fuck up."
Browns,34q7lm,bjbush,-17,Sun May 3 18:11:59 2015 UTC,"He definitely came in and helped that team get to the playoffs.  Without him they don't make it to the AFC Championship.  But they prove in the end that you can have an elite defense and that alone can't get you to the super bowl.   SO you gotta either take the narrative that elite defenses (which we're trying to build) aren't enough to actually win real games, or we need a franchise guy (which we're ignoring) you don't get both."
Browns,34q7lm,djroomba322,6,Sun May 3 18:17:47 2015 UTC,Or that an elite defense can get you deep into the playoffs so we should build one of those and then try and find a QB to come in without the pressure of carrying an average defense. You are basically taking everything and putting it into the most negative light possible. If we got to 2 straight AFC championship games I would be ecstatic as would the entire fanbase.
Browns,34q7lm,bjbush,-13,Sun May 3 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"Or that out of all the playoff teams for the last 15 years, only 2-3 of them ever had success with an elite defense, and the majority of THOSE also had a good QB.  I mean those facts alone should tell you what we're doing is fundamentally flawed."

Browns,34q7lm,bjbush,-13,Sun May 3 18:24:25 2015 UTC,right.  Elite defense is not enough to win you the big games in the NFL.  You need an offense of some kind.  Which pretty much breaks down the entire process of what we have built this year.
Browns,34q7lm,djroomba322,9,Sun May 3 18:29:11 2015 UTC,You're retarded
Browns,34q7lm,Illinois_Jones,9,Sun May 3 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"the only thing that matters is quarterback play   False, observably false, provably false.  I take issue with the word ONLY. QB play is the most important part of winning a football game, but it is NOT the only thing. Peyton Manning only has 1 Super Bowl ring despite consistently being the best (or at worst 2nd best) quarterback this century so why didn't he win more Super Bowls. In fact, by your logic, it is fair to ask why haven't Manning and Brady won every Super Bowl in the last 15 years?   QB play is very important, but lets be honest here, the best qb in any individual game is not always the qb that wins that game."
Browns,34q7lm,npac85,-15,Sun May 3 21:06:01 2015 UTC,"Guess what, you linked a bunch of guys before the passing era. So your first link is obviously wrong.  Oh look, your second link continues being as wrong as the first link.  And your third link is retarded because it starts with Rothlesburger.  I'm going to try and not be condescending to you.  You have to understand how this only demonstrate how little of an understanding you have of the situation right?  I'm really sorry, but if you believe that, I think we've found the problem.   Peyton Manning only has 1 Super Bowl ring despite consistently being the best (or at worst 2nd best)    And what in the fuck does this have to do with being a great team and going to superbowls?  So let me guess, Jim Kelly was terrible because he never won a super bowl.   In fact, by your logic, it is fair to ask why haven't Manning and Brady won every Super Bowl in the last 15 years?   No.  Because that is probably the most retarded strawman sentiment I've ever read on this forum.  I'm impressed.  It takes a special kind of misunderstanding to jump to that logic.   QB play is very important, but lets be honest here, the best qb in any individual game is not always the qb that wins that game.   QB play is the only thing that matters.  Period.  End of sentence.  You can have an average team with a great QB and win a superbowl with like 7 good players.  Or you can build an entire elite franchise with 18 pro bowlers with a mediocre QB and win a super bowl.  guess which one is easier to do?  Want a hint?"
Browns,34q7lm,djroomba322,2,Sun May 3 21:14:23 2015 UTC,"An elite defense/run game, like the 85 Bears, 00 Ravens, 02 Bucs, 06 Steelers, etc. all had, could have won the super bowl with Jamarcus Russell at the helm. That's his point.   We're building a team around the defense and run game. We play in a physical division. 5 or 6 games every year will likely be decided on defense. A run game is a necessity in a cold weather stadium late in the season.   Also, if Johnny ends up not busting (I'm not saying he will, not saying he won't, just saying that both are a possibility), we're looking at a 22-man juggernaut.   Even with McCown under center, this team is looking like the best we've had since the late eighties. I really wish you could put your negativity to rest; while I understand that the Browns have been inept and incompetent (literally a walking punchline) for over 20 years, this is a time when we should be excited to see all the talent we've amassed on defense and on the ground. We're going to be able to make a run this year, as long as we don't get fucked by injuries."
Browns,34q7lm,Doyle524,11,Mon May 4 08:06:06 2015 UTC,People that think like you are why this team keeps bringing in qbs to fail.  First we build a solid core.  Then we bring in a QB who doesn't have to be a savior right away.
Browns,34q7lm,halfsane,-15,Sun May 3 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"People like me wouldn't have drafted 28 year old baseball players or 5'11"" spread guys.  People like me would look for prototypical size QBs with big hands from pro style offenses and good mechanics.  People like me wouldn't be leaving rookie quarterbacks with no weapons to help him out.  People like me would draft the QB the guys I paid 100,000 dollars to research QBs suggested I should.  People like me don't expect a player to be a savior day 1.  People like me don't think Carr or Bridgewater or Wilson or any young QB came in to save their franchise.  Its people like YOU who think that.  You get a guy who's not a drug addict, who cares about football, who's from the right type of offense with the right size and you set him up to succeed, not to fail.  But that's just people like me"

Browns,34q7lm,SmokeySmokes,3,Sun May 3 20:53:24 2015 UTC,"Do you know who Aaron Rodgers gifted HDTVs to as thanks?  His Oline- not his receivers.  If you ask any QB who they would prefer a team draft in the 1st round- an OL or a WR- they will tell you OL because they know how implant that protection is and how fast even a ""mediocre"" WR is."
Browns,34q7lm,sonicmerlin,1 point,Sun May 3 23:27:02 2015 UTC,"Yep. The talent disparity between the #1 WR and the #50 WR in the league isn't going to make a huge decision over the course of the season, especially when the team in question plans to run the ball. The disparity between the #1 OT or OG or C and the #50 at the same position could be the difference between 5 sacks and 2000 yards rushing, and 45 sacks and 600 yards rushing."

Browns,34q7lm,Rizzlerick,2,Mon May 4 03:43:37 2015 UTC,"That's true. Brady has four rings now, but his play alone is not what got them all. But having a good core with a mediocre QB can get a few wins and even a ring. Look at the Younger Manning; Flacco; Dilfer, etc.  An o-line goes a long way toward securing consistency at being good. They can even make a bad RB look good just by letting him get two extra yards per carry."
Browns,34q7lm,unicorn_therapist,1 point,Mon May 4 04:55:43 2015 UTC,Eli and Flacco are waaaay better than Dilfer
Browns,34q7lm,fuuuuuuuuuuuck216,0,Mon May 4 14:21:06 2015 UTC,You're right. Dilfer was bad. Eli and Flacco are mediocre.

Browns,34q7lm,Stowcenter93,0,Mon May 4 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"This is precisely why I value defense over a QB or a WR. If you can shut down the opposing offense, you can normally put up a fluke 3 or 7 with a completely stagnant offense, and that could be enough to win. Add a run game to the mix, and you've got a contender. Add a passing game as icing on the cake, and you're looking at the AFC championship game or the Super Bowl."
Browns,34q7lm,Doyle524,2,Mon May 4 08:09:10 2015 UTC,If we had a better kicker last year we probably would've won 2 or 3 more games. I pray we get some one who's at least accurate from 45 yards in.

Browns,34rp5e,Chiranthodendron,10,Mon May 4 00:17:18 2015 UTC,"Shelton saw his brother's life get taken away.  Desir worked full time, at one point cleaning poop, while raising a family and performing at such a high level that he was drafted as a D2 athlete.  Orchard basically was abandoned and raised by a cool family in Utah.  Haden's story about his brother is also crazy inspiring.  Are there any other crazy stories about Browns players being really cool people going through some serious adversity?"
Browns,34rp5e,Brokewood,8,Mon May 4 00:47:44 2015 UTC,Kruger should have died and has some crazy scars on his stomach from getting jumped in a fight. Joel Bitonio lost his father early (who also has a crazy cool story).
Browns,34rp5e,kevler9oh,5,Mon May 4 02:49:19 2015 UTC,Kruger also has been mentoring Orchard prior to being drafted. Unsure of how long exactly.

Browns,34vbrv,Abiv23,4,Mon May 4 21:39:40 2015 UTC,I just built a time machine and traveled to the future. Looks good guys.
Browns,34vbrv,giannini1222,2,Mon May 4 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing, based on the current composition of our roster and the guys we picked up in the draft, that you'll start to see a shift in thinking from ""we need to build a team"" to ""we have a pretty good team and now we need a QB.""  There are just too many variables to say how much we would want to give up to get one.  How many of the QBs are going to be top prospects?  Who's in front of us?  We're going to have to pay more than we want, most likely.  I'd have no problem shelling out two firsts and a handful of other picks (one each in 4/5/6) if that's what it takes.  I would still hesitate to give up three firsts to get to the top of the draft, and that seems to be the going rate.  I just wonder ... are fans in New York, Houston, and Buffalo talking about this already?  Or is this just a Cleveland thing?"
Browns,34vbrv,TapedeckNinja,2,Mon May 4 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"The problem is, (and this is obviously too far out), that the teams are ahead of us because they need a QB themselves.  And so if there is that can't miss generational talent, they're taking him no matter the price.  And if its still a good prospect?  We're going to have to give up RG3 prospects no doubt.  Which is why this year it was imperative to utilize our 2 first round picks, in either generating more future picks or moving up on the price we could afford.  If we're going from 8 to 1, it won't be two firsts.  It will be swapping 1sts, and then two more 1sts.  Minimum.  We will not have a pick in 2017, or 2018 either. And we'd probably have to lose a 2nd.  So our other option is, we take the 3rd best guy in the draft probably.  Which can definitely work out. But its more of a gamble.   And this is without even knowing who's coming out, and how everyones senior year is.  The fans in those cities aren't talking about it because they have legitimate options at QB for this year.  Cassell has won 10+ games with 2 different teams.  Manuel isnt going way yet either.  The jets are giving Geno one more chance, but its a year to groom Petty who's a big arm.  And houston is going to have at a minimum Hoyer playing, but they feel pretty comfortable with their guy too.  We're the only situation that actually looks scary (in the bad way) on paper, which is why its hard to get too excited about the position.  Again, the main problem that isn't even mentioned here, is Manziel is easily 3 years away from being competent just based on his mechanics.  Even if he has a bad year this year, it doesn't mean he cant be good in the future.  He's just that far behind.  it will take an entire other year to see if he truly is bad or if he is just a rookie with zero understanding of pro style offenses."
Browns,34vbrv,djroomba322,1 point,Mon May 4 22:16:41 2015 UTC,"It is hard to project who's going to need a QB next year.  Based on the pre-FA O/U odds, if we win six games we'll be behind Oakland, Tennessee, Jacksonville, Washington, and Tampa Bay.  If we're lucky, none of those teams need a QB.  However, that doesn't mean Buffalo or Houston or New York wouldn't jump us to get one.  And there are certainly other teams waiting in the wings who could need QBs (Chicago, Washington, and Arizona come to mind).  Regardless of what you think about Hoyer/Fitzmagic/Cassell or whoever else those teams trot out, none of them are ""set"" with a long-term answer at QB.  And I disagree that we're the only situation that looks scary; I think that's a case of ""the grass is always greener.""  Hang out on /r/nyjets after Geno Smith has a bad game and you might change your mind; they'll be chanting for Petty soon enough.  I do not disagree that we'll need at least a couple of seasons to get the true measure of Johnny Manziel, I'm just playing along with OP's ""it's time to move on"" premise."
Browns,34vbrv,TapedeckNinja,2,Mon May 4 22:31:11 2015 UTC,"I think you approach the quarterback position like you do any other position.  A small move is okay for a player you want, but never mortgage the future.  If you need a qb, take the guy who falls to you.  A good team can make those second tier qb prospects look good."
Browns,34vbrv,topper_mango,1 point,Mon May 4 22:04:12 2015 UTC,"I just wonder if the whole ""passing league"" thing has changed the dynamic of drafting QBs in today's NFL.  Would a guy like Roethlisberger be available at #11 now? Or Flacco at #18?"
Browns,34vbrv,TapedeckNinja,1 point,Mon May 4 23:48:02 2015 UTC,"Good question.  The first player to come to mind is Tanehill, who, like Roethlisberger, was the third QB taken in a top heavy draft.  Tannehill lasted to 7 (I think), so maybe there's the answer: they still slide, but not as far...?  Then again, I don't think Roethlisberger (or Tanehill) were second tier prospects.  I'm more talking the Dalton's and Flacco's and Carr's and Bridgewater's, and I think they're available most every year."
Browns,34vbrv,topper_mango,1 point,Tue May 5 00:12:37 2015 UTC,I think one of the reasons we've been focusing on compensation picks this year is so we can have ammo next year for this kind of move.   If the scouting department feels like one of those QBs is a future star then j say we pull the trigger and do it
Browns,34vbrv,Cory_mathews,1 point,Tue May 5 00:00:41 2015 UTC,Can we trade comp picks or do you mean trade all the regular picks and have the comps as backup?

Browns,34vbrv,Cory_mathews,1 point,Tue May 5 12:18:47 2015 UTC,Wouldn't give anything up. Christian Hackenberg will be there when we pick at #9.
Browns,34vbrv,el_osoalto,1 point,Tue May 5 00:19:21 2015 UTC,"If the Browns are at the point where they have enough talent, and tossing future picks out the window to figure out QB actually seems like a good option, then give me a Joe Flacco or a Russell Wilson. Give me the low ceiling guy that I can get in the 2nd and 3rd round to complement the guys we already have. That way the team can still improve when we keep our 1st rounders."
Browns,34vbrv,TucanJamz,1 point,Tue May 5 00:32:37 2015 UTC,It won't matter. All we need is someone to hand the ball off. Ray Farmer is going to introduce a new formation. It will have 6 linemen 4 running backs and a QB. Ray says WR & TE's are way overrated and you don't need any to win.
Browns,34tnhh,Kylekub,4,Mon May 4 13:48:30 2015 UTC,"I think Cleveland's going to remain pretty much content with how their QB chart is. They've got four arms going into camp - two vets, two young guys. I don't see them adding at all to that."
Browns,34tnhh,VonJaeger,-1,Mon May 4 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see Mark Myers on the roster than Thad Lewis any day...  edit: But, in the Browns defense... The OLine is getting better. At this rate, a 4 year old can sit in the pocket and land a pass. I am hopeful that the OLine will make the offense essentially dummyproof"
Browns,34tnhh,VonJaeger,4,Mon May 4 14:03:03 2015 UTC,"The thing about Thad Lewis is while he's not talented as a QB, he has a very good mental grasp over the game and he understands how to play the position. That sort of thing gets underrated but it's so important. In a lot of ways, Thad Lewis is the perfect camp body. You know he's not going to push for the starting gig - at best he'll claim that third spot from Connor Shaw - but he brings a lot more than just an arm to camp. Especially when you're installing a new offense.  Also, the year will go basically as well as the QBs are able to run the offense. They don't have to go out and throw for 300 yards every week, but when we were winning last year, it was because Hoyer was executing the offense very well. The way Cleveland will win this year is through playing clean, mistake free football."

Browns,34thhn,SnakeLaFleur,31,Mon May 4 12:50:45 2015 UTC,"text to take away page views:   Browns remain a mystery: Still get a little baffled by the Browns. They needed a space eater and got one at No. 12 overall in Danny Shelton, but that's a little rich for a player that I can force off the field whenever I like. Forget about third down, I can get you into your sub-package on first down by going with four 4 WRs and running out of that spread formation if I want, putting Shelton is on the sideline. They again passed on receiver far too long with it being such a strong position in this draft, as it was a year ago. And if you go back to last year, when they traded down with Buffalo and essentially passed on Odell Beckham Jr. and Sammy Watkins, things don't look great (they knew at the time, if you recall, that Josh Gordon was facing a year suspension). The Browns took Justin Gilbert with that pick and used their other first rounder on Johnny Manziel; Buffalo took Watkins and they passed on ODB, and out of that trade, Cleveland ended up with Gilbert, versatile offensive lineman Cameron Erving (the 19th overall pick over the weekend) and a fifth-round pick. You wouldn't find anyone on the planet who would part with either receiver for that package of players. Oh, and they don't have a quarterback after swinging and missing on attempts to get Sam Bradford and Marcus Mariota. And they play a very tough schedule. Yikes."
Browns,34thhn,moodyfloyd,13,Mon May 4 13:21:57 2015 UTC,"Cleveland ended up with Gilbert, versatile offensive lineman Cameron Erving (the 19th overall pick over the weekend) and a fifth-round pick.   Jesus, he can't even get his information right, it was a fourth round pick which was used to select Ibraheim Campbell.  He couldn't even be bothered to put the player's name in this, just ""a fifth-round [actually 4th] pick"".

Nonetheless, when you've got real CFB analysts who actually watched every snap Shelton played saying things like:   A monster of a man at 339 pounds, Shelton played well enough in 2014 that we believe he’s the best player on the defensive interior available in this draft, even ahead of the highly-rated Leonard Williams from USC. What makes Shelton so impressive in our eyes, is that for as big a player as he is physically, we think he can be so much more than the 0-technique nose tackle so many have him pegged as.  He’s so active with his hands and feet that it really feels like he could be a special player if he’s allowed to attack. It’s interesting that in this draft class Leonard Williams is considered the disruptive force and Shelton the solid run defender, when we feel that the opposite is true. He projects well as an NFL player regardless, but I’ll be excited to see Shelton with a team that give him a little bit of freedom to go after and terrorize opposing offensive linemen.   La Canfora is pegging Shelton as a two-down hog, which is actually the same reason I was against drafting Shelton at #12 ... until I actually did some research, that is.  It's just lazy journalism.  He's making assumptions about the kid because of his size and because of some hot-takes he read elsewhere."
Browns,34thhn,TapedeckNinja,25,Mon May 4 14:38:37 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, guys.  I just had a fucking revelation:   You wouldn't find anyone on the planet who would part with either receiver for that package of players. Oh, and they don't have a quarterback after swinging and missing on attempts to get Sam Bradford and Marcus Mariota. And they play a very tough schedule. Yikes.   Jason LaCanfora is /u/djroomba322."

That sounds pretty childish on our part but I don't know the whole story so I'm genuinely asking.   Edit: I can obviously see his comments, but why is he being downvoted on such a massive scale? Sure I don't agree with everything he says but not all of his comments seem that bad, in fact I see some that spark a reasonable point for debate.

Browns,34thhn,Spartan_55,13,Tue May 5 17:31:25 2015 UTC,Johnny Manziel and Taylor Gabriel could both be in the running for NFL MVP and they'd still say we needed a QB and WR.

When you select a QB it changes the course of your franchise for 3+ years.  Of course his selection effects this draft.

Browns,34thhn,theband65,10,Tue May 5 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"1) Spartan was purposely portraying a very unlikely scenario to illustrate that Jason La Canfora is a fool.  2) Yes, drafting Manziel has implications to the team beyond just 2014, but there was nothing that the Browns could have done in 2015 that would have un-drafted Johnny Manziel in 2014. In that respect, if you're going to try to analyze the 2015 draft, you have to compare who they got to other players who were eligible for the 2015 draft. There's too many unknowns that could have occurred from last year to this year that makes comparing Watkins or ODB to Justin Gilbert/Cam Erving a stupid argument."

Browns,34thhn,VonJaeger,-18,Mon May 4 13:31:15 2015 UTC,"You miss the point.  Completely and utterly.  Johnny Ball needed to see if he could do the run around thing at the nfl level.  That was obvious that doesn't work.  So now he has to learn how to do a prostyle offense.  He has to be deprogrammed from running.  He has to have his entire footwork reprogrammed.  He has to learn route trees, and actual plays.  He is basically starting completely over and fresh because he's not fast enough to run away from defenders, and not big enough to take a hit."
Browns,34thhn,Marzman315,5,Mon May 4 13:37:38 2015 UTC,"He has to be deprogrammed from running.   Manziel isn't a dual threat QB. He's a scrambling QB - much in the same vein that Russell Wilson or Aaron Rodgers are. There's a difference between running and scrambling.   He doesn't have to be ""deprogrammed"" from running in the slightest. Manziel's legs are one of his biggest strengths and Cleveland - or any other team - would be foolish to take those away from him and make him a pure pocket passer. You don't keep someone from running, you just try and change their tendencies. Instead of bolting at the first instance of pressure, like he did in college, you step into the pocket and then bolt once pressure continues. But to say that he needs to be kept from running is falling into the same exact trap that others have fallen into when trying to pigeon hole a mobile QB into becoming a straight pocket passer. Too many teams try to force their QBs into their scheme instead of adjusting the scheme around the QB - to take away Manziel's legs and tell him not to run at all is absurd."

And he scrambles for yards, which they don't.  He 100% has to be deprogrammed from this.  Its the NFL.  He doesn't have kaep or luck size.  He can't scramble like they can.  He has to avoid contact and he's never done that on any level.  He needs to be taught NFL schemes. And we're going to do exactly what you said.  Force him into being a straight pocket passer.  That's exactly what they did with Carr. ANd that's exactly what they're going to do with Manziel.  SO you better get used to it now."

Browns,34thhn,VonJaeger,-10,Mon May 4 14:21:58 2015 UTC,Right.  Open field running and option running.  The exact opposite of what Manziel does.
Browns,34thhn,Troop-the-Loop,5,Mon May 4 14:25:15 2015 UTC,What the hell are you talking about? Wilson ran for 850 yards last year.

Under you, Manziel will fail. Why? Because you take away one of his greatest strengths. You're attempting to pigeon hole him as a pure pocket passer.   Its the NFL. He doesn't have kaep or luck size. He can't scramble like they can. He has to avoid contact and he's never done that on any level.   Then why does it work for Wilson? Manziel is larger than Wilson is. Oh, that's right, it's because Wilson scrambles intelligently. I absolutely agree that you focus on when to run and when not to...but to insist that he shouldn't at all is just pure idiocy.   And we're going to do exactly what you said. Force him into being a straight pocket passer. That's exactly what they did with Carr. ANd that's exactly what they're going to do with Manziel.

Browns,34ptz9,PolishMusic,4,Sun May 3 15:31:35 2015 UTC,"May I ask why he is your favorite? He's the biggest head-scratcher in my opinion when it comes to our early round talent. I watched this video of him against Colorado State this morning and didn't see very much to be impressed by.  I will admit that I like other things I have heard from him including being a team captain and leader in tackles for 3 years in Utah. He also worked with Kruger in the recent past as well. These are great for changing the locker room culture and enforcing Pettine's ""Play like a Brown"" philosophy, but I am not seeing anything special as a pass rusher."
Browns,34ptz9,Mustang1718,4,Sun May 3 15:11:46 2015 UTC,"I was with you mainly because I hadn't heard of him before and his measurables don't blow you away but I watched this film and I see why they drafted him.  Look at how many times they refuse to run at him, he is double teamed, or they use misdirection in their blocking scheme to get him off his rush. When he is one on one he gets pressure on the QB. The long pass was because it took him a second to realize that they were not blocking him but forcing him outside and just had the back to block. The trick play was the only touchdown because they get him to chase to the otherside of the field and then flip it back, but these are two plays with what would simply be ""rookie"" mistakes out of a whole game.  He is not the flashiest player and he made a few poor decisions but that is what coaches are for. This guy looks like another Kruger"
Browns,34ptz9,pievdelta,5,Sun May 3 16:17:59 2015 UTC,"Funny you mention Kruger, he's actually been mentoring Orchard for the last few years.  Orchard even wore #99 at the senior bowl."
Browns,34ptz9,surlysci,4,Sun May 3 18:19:30 2015 UTC,"He's the biggest head-scratcher in my opinion when it comes to our early round talent.   I can see wondering if he was really worthy of such an early pick, that's understandable but as of now I'm pretty sure he was. In addition to being a Browns fan, I cover the pack 12 for a living, and this guy on his own was someone offensive coordinators had to plan around. Notice how in the video you shared just about every single play Colorado state ran was either double teaming him or to the opposite side of the field. CSU literally drew up a significant portion of their game plan around avoiding him, and CSU was not the only team that had to do this, or would have benefited greatly from doing this.   Also, be careful using just bowl games as a indication of any one player or team's ability. Because of the way bowl games work they can tend to lead to atypical results."
Browns,34ptz9,npac85,2,Sun May 3 20:51:57 2015 UTC,"If it helps, the CSU game was one of his least productive that I watched of him, and that tackle he was going against was sneaky good and was drafted by Denver, I believe.  Like the guy said below watch him own Peat in his Stanford game.  Also I think he's a guy that does better when moved around to take advantage of matchups and I'm guessing we're going to be moving the guy around a lot depending on the situation."
Browns,34ptz9,surlysci,0,Sun May 3 18:13:36 2015 UTC,He's not really a special pass rusher. Maybe a 10 sack guy.
Browns,34ptz9,ChairyCweed,14,Sun May 3 15:28:45 2015 UTC,"10 sacks would be huge for the Browns defense, would make the pass rush respected"
Browns,34ptz9,Nightcinder,6,Sun May 3 15:47:18 2015 UTC,He had 18.5 last year against good college teams. I'd take his ten sacks any day
Browns,34ptz9,SmokeySmokes,1 point,Sun May 3 22:40:19 2015 UTC,I'm talking about ceiling. 10 sacks in his rookie year would be outstanding. 10 sacks in his 5th year would still be good for a 2nd rounder.

Browns,34ptz9,blinner,15,Sun May 3 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, lets say he did want Mingo when he was at Buffalo which seems to be the case.

Browns,34ptz9,ChairyCweed,3,Sun May 3 15:32:17 2015 UTC,"I think the most recent example of this is Daylon McCutcheon. Daylon did not exactly have an exciting start to his career, but in his third year he clicked and became a fan favorite. He never really reached an 'elite' status but was extremely consistent. Still, it took time for him to develop. (As I write this I'm saddened by the fact we've drafted so poorly over the years that Daylon is the best example I can come up with.)  Mingo is an athletic freak. If it were not for that he wouldn't have projected first round. He's also transitioning from DE where he now has to read the whole field and understand his adjustments. Where as a DE he really only had one thing to think about."
Browns,34ptz9,Trilljoy,7,Sun May 3 15:54:04 2015 UTC,Mingo can still be good and has shown he can be a pass rusher. Fuck off with the negativity.

Browns,34ptz9,BurningBeard24,2,Mon May 4 10:46:04 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I've been here enough to see that... It bothers me. I shouldn't admit it, but it does. We have so much potential for next year, with every facet of the team being upgraded in some way, but these supposed fans see nothing but doom and gloom. I've followed the Browns since they came back. I know what failure looks like. Pettine and the team he and Ray have put together do not look like failure. Our defense and run game will carry the team, and worst case scenario, you have McCown under center. He's competent. If Johnny or Shaw burst out in camp, practice, or the preseason, then we're looking even better.   My point is, let's get pumped for next year!"
Browns,34ptz9,Doyle524,2,Mon May 4 12:55:48 2015 UTC,I do hope is is the next Elvis Dumerville or Terrell Suggs.  I just don't believe it.  I sure hope I am wrong.

Browns,34ptz9,blinner,1 point,Sun May 3 14:32:25 2015 UTC,Who drafted him?
Browns,34ptz9,ChairyCweed,-10,Sun May 3 14:33:56 2015 UTC,Read the article below.  Pet and O'Neil wanted him so bad in 2013 that they had their wives bake Mingo cupcakes for the GM.
Browns,34ptz9,blinner,1 point,Sun May 3 14:39:42 2015 UTC,So what you are saying is that Ray Farmer didn't draft him?
Browns,34ptz9,ChairyCweed,-7,Sun May 3 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"Correct.  Joe Banner was in charge of the draft that year.  Farmer was in the room, but didn't have final say."
Browns,34ptz9,blinner,2,Sun May 3 15:44:41 2015 UTC,But were there cupcakes?
Browns,34ptz9,topper_mango,-5,Sun May 3 16:32:01 2015 UTC,Nope.  Those are reserved for Buffalo.
Browns,34ptz9,blinner,5,Sun May 3 16:44:49 2015 UTC,You have a great memory for things that never happened.
Browns,34ptz9,9planets,-4,Sun May 3 15:30:14 2015 UTC,Read the article.  It's very clear that Pet and O'Neil desperately wanted Mingo.
Browns,34ptz9,blinner,3,Sun May 3 15:41:23 2015 UTC,I don't think Pet picked Mingo?
Browns,34ptz9,blinner,-16,Sun May 3 14:30:00 2015 UTC,He wanted to.

Browns,34ptz9,blinner,-3,Sun May 3 22:41:35 2015 UTC,Read the other comments I made.  They were desperate to get their hands on him in Buffalo.  Desperate enough to bake cupcakes.
Browns,34ptz9,SmokeySmokes,2,Sun May 3 23:22:38 2015 UTC,I understand what you were saying your flair just made me salty

Browns,34qblt,pg5042,2,Mon May 4 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"Man, I didnt really even realize what we all had on the DL now.  DEs - Armonty, Desmond, Cooper, Winn, Starks  NTs - Shelton, Taylor, Ishmaa'ily Kitchen  DE/NTs - Hughes  However, Armonty might play some OLB too. There's also some guys that we were pretty high on last year like Jaccobi McDaniels and Calvin Barnett. There's gonna be some tough cuts, or maybe trades coming."
Browns,34qblt,CBD2032,11,Mon May 4 03:07:56 2015 UTC,We actually switch between 3-4 and 4-3 arrangements at about a 50/50 ratio.

Browns,34qblt,Brokewood,9,Mon May 4 18:42:16 2015 UTC,Cooper and Starks will most likely play the 3 tech and line up as the RDE. Shelton and Phil will probably be the true NT's

Browns,34qblt,topper_mango,17,Sun May 3 22:58:38 2015 UTC,Ill will? He's spent more time on the sidelines than in games. That's just fact. It's why they drafted the way they did.
Browns,34qblt,JDean330,5,Mon May 4 12:13:49 2015 UTC,"We can also rotate them in and out to keep them fresh.  Since our offense won't be all that great, it will be good to keep fresh guys on defense consistently."
Browns,34qblt,themitey1,6,Sun May 3 22:32:31 2015 UTC,"Shelton and Taylor are going to line up at the nose. Starks and Hughes will likely be the primary rotations at the 3 tech, with Cooper coming in on pass rushing downs.  Cooper is essentially Starks' successor when Starks retires/leaves, while Shelton is Taylor's replacement."
Browns,34qblt,VonJaeger,5,Sun May 3 22:52:19 2015 UTC,"You're completely forgetting the best D-lineman on our roster - John Hughes. You also forgot both Bryants, Winn, and Kitchen. I would expect our depth chart to look like this:  D. Bryant - Taylor - Hughes Winn - Shelton - Kitchen  Everyone else will be mixed and matched as needs arise due to injuries, etcetera. This leaves A. Bryant, Cooper, and Starks as our depth guys. I don't expect Copper to have any significant role in year 1."
Browns,34qblt,AKlep,3,Sun May 3 23:11:33 2015 UTC,Hopefully we get a good rotation going and everyone  (uncle Phil) can stay healthy

Browns,34q6ry,meximeme,8,Mon May 4 06:26:07 2015 UTC,I am positive someone would have taken the risk on Collins on day 3 had he not announced he will hold out if he gets drafted day 3. He really needs to fire his agent if given that advice from them.
Browns,34q6ry,dayflyer55,3,Sun May 3 16:18:33 2015 UTC,Apparently he was trying to get drafted yesterday after all.
Browns,34q6ry,Helix1322,9,Sun May 3 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"Because the agent is a moron and a gm would have to be a moron to draft him.  Here's the sequence of events   1) agent says collins wont sign with a team if he's drafted. He will sit a year and re enter the draft.  2). NFL says yes, he can do that if he's drafted.  But if he isn't drafted he can't re-enter next year.    3). Agent now tries to get Collins drafted.  See the problem there?  You are basically letting yourself get screwed by drafting the guy, since its the only way he can enter the draft next year.  Conclusion?  Agent fucked up big time.    Edit- ok, so I just read that udfas can get similar money to their third round draft choices.  Except they have a more advantageous free agency when their initial contract is up.  Plus, you get to pick your team.  So- maybe we are the idiots and the agent is a genius."
Browns,34q6ry,chubby_prince,3,Sun May 3 20:05:31 2015 UTC,I feel that now is the time to make a move on him rather than waiting for things to play out. If he has more time then he will get more offers. I rather grab him while he is desperate and add him to strengthen our O line.   The biggest differance from being drafted now vs in the late rds was the bonus money which we won't get much anyhow....  Pay structure and lenth of the contract is the same.  Just offer a lot of granteed money as long as he makes the team (and doesn't have criminal charges brought against him)
Browns,34q6ry,Trilljoy,1 point,Sun May 3 21:09:20 2015 UTC,"I know what you are saying - but I want to point out that he's a free agent now.  You can't just ""grab him"".  He decides which team to go to.  The only way he becomes desperate is if he's charged with murder....and then none of this matters.  If he's cleared, all 32 teams will be interested and he can sign with any one he chooses."
Browns,34q6ry,Oskie5272,2,Mon May 4 16:29:54 2015 UTC,Wasn't there was a report that he intends to take the year off and reenter the draft next year?

Browns,34o7uu,BurroughOwl,15,Sun May 3 01:52:55 2015 UTC,"isn't that what the draft is for and why the NFL promotes it so much?  We have NO reason to believe that this is a team changing draft class except for HOPE.  Rember Courtney Brown?  He was gonna change our defense.    Fact is, we never know if a draft was good or not for a couple of years.  Unfortunately for us, we never get to see the same front office and coaching staff long enough to evaluate their long term effectiveness."

Browns,34o7uu,Commisioner_Gordon,3,Sun May 3 02:46:39 2015 UTC,And for once I think the fans actually have Pettine's and Farmer's back more or less
Browns,34o7uu,LiterallyHitner31,2,Sun May 3 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like Pettine is almost universally respected by our fanbase right now, and I even see other fanbases giving him respect in /r/nfl, despite the usual lolbrowns circlejerk.  I see a lot of ridicule of Farmer on here and other places, though, which I think is completely unwarranted. It's a direct result of Manziel and Gilbert not panning out yet, and since they were the ones that everyone knows about, that's what they base their opinion on. What they don't acknowledge is the excellent players that we found later in the draft. I think Farmer is one of the best GMs in the league, and he's going to prove it over these next few years."
Browns,34o7uu,Commisioner_Gordon,3,Sun May 3 17:54:57 2015 UTC,And they are miles above any other leader we've had for the past 5 years. They may not be perfect but so far their new direction has made the Browns a new force to be reckoned with and not a laughable joke like we used to be

Browns,34o7uu,DaDulas,10,Sun May 3 01:33:03 2015 UTC,Did we pick up any picks for next year?
Browns,34o7uu,BurroughOwl,8,Sun May 3 01:44:41 2015 UTC,i had the same question.  i think the answer is No.
Browns,34o7uu,VonJaeger,7,Sun May 3 02:07:11 2015 UTC,No. But we're expected to receive somewhere in the neighborhood of two fourth round picks and a sixth rounder due to compensatory picks.
Browns,34o7uu,battle_squid,2,Sun May 3 02:46:41 2015 UTC,I thought it was 2 4ths and 2 5ths at first
Browns,34o7uu,VonJaeger,4,Sun May 3 04:33:24 2015 UTC,"Actually, it looks like it has changed a bit since OTC published it the first time:  http://overthecap.com/2016-compensatory-draft-picks-update-432015/  Three 5ths and a 7th."
Browns,34o7uu,LurkaDurkaDoWorka,9,Sun May 3 06:14:31 2015 UTC,Best part about this draft is the depth we are going to have at multiple positions. Pettine already has established that no one's job is safe during training camp and that competition will be encouraged such that whoever emerges will have truly earned their spot on the 53 man roster come September. Can't wait to see who all makes the cut from this class!
Browns,34o7uu,normalism,19,Sun May 3 02:26:59 2015 UTC,12 players in 7 rounds.  Holy fuck. I don't understand this optimism¿

Browns,34o7uu,BurroughOwl,7,Sun May 3 01:25:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a sucker, i like it.  If JFF is our starter as rumored, then giving him options away from the outside and long-yard pass is a good idea.  We all knew there wouldn't be many survivors from the D-line so this gives us a whole new class to build upon.    Like i said elsewhere, we won't really know for a couple of years whether this was great or not, but i like it so far."
Browns,34o7uu,blackedout,2,Sun May 3 02:14:48 2015 UTC,"To go along with this, I think Farmer's idea of a wide receiver for Johnny was ""Does he look like Mike Evans? Take him."""
Browns,34o7uu,PabstyLoudmouth,3,Sun May 3 15:59:49 2015 UTC,"Well I could not be much happier with our draft. We upgraded our run d by a bunch and got a very solid O-lineman in Erving. Orchard is a great fit as Krugger is his mentor and should compete for playing time. Cooper will also help the DL and has a huge upside. Mayle may not start but give him a year in the NFL and he could be a quality starter.   Given what we have done here, I am confident we will be better than last year. 9-7."
Browns,34o7uu,Nottah,5,Sun May 3 12:20:19 2015 UTC,A lot tougher schedule this year. 9-7 would be sweet.

I don't hate our picks by any means, but I wish they reinforced the offense a bit more as I don't think we have the tools to drive the field in a game-winning two-minute drill scenario. Third downs on defense have plagued us for both years I have followed our team's every move, but I am sure it goes back much further as this is the most complete squad we've had probably since our return. It's going to be exciting to see them become dominant like that Colts game last year, but for every game."

Browns,34okt1,joeprunz420,1 point,Sun May 3 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"It is the most comparable (and punting too). The difference is in the expectations. If you miss a couple of clutch kicks (sometimes even just 1) in the NFL you are out of a job. In college you can miss a ton of kicks and still be fine. In the NFL you have to be as close to automatic every time as possible. And finding 32 individuals that can do that is tough. In college though, they're more likely to take anyone with even a little bit of ability who is willing to do the job (almost always without a scholarship, yeah you basically have to pay money to be a college kicker). In other words, its not about adapting to the pro game, its about finding someone who can make the kicks in the first place because there just isn't that many of them."

Browns,34ojkp,Syia,7,Sun May 3 05:23:34 2015 UTC,"In theory, the Browns drafting was excellent this year. Pretty much everyone, including fans of other teams agree.  We still don't have long-term elite players at WR, QB, or RB, but there was no way to get them this year. I wouldn't be surprised if the Browns have a bad year, but I would not say its because of the draft."
Browns,34ojkp,farmerwouldsay,6,Sun May 3 05:37:03 2015 UTC,"We got the guy that broke a bunch of Miami rushing records held by serious NFL players. I wouldn't be surprised if he makes a big impact his rookie season, especially receiving out of the backfield."
Browns,34ojkp,djroomba322,-11,Sun May 3 08:12:57 2015 UTC,"He looks good, but Farmer now has had 2 full drafts and 2 full off seasons and his entire offense that he has built includes Josh McCown our probable day 1 starter and Dwanye Bowe our #1 receiver.  This is inexcusable considering the list of players he's passed on in two years."
Browns,34ojkp,LoLz14,3,Sun May 3 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"One can definitely agree with you, but let's take a look at what players were available in this and last year's drafts.  Wikipedia link for 2014  Wikipedia link for 2015  So I took a look at 2014th NFL draft. I think we can all agree that there was plethora of good Wide Receivers. Watkins, Evans, Beckham Jr were all gone by pick number 12. They all panned out great.   Later on there was Kelvin Benjamin who had also very good year and Cooks with solid but nothing special.   We could've picked all 3 of the first mentioned guys but in reality (at that point) we had Josh Gordon. People wanted another WR but maybe not in the first round.   Obvious shock came after first day of draft when we found out he was suspended. So WR is a need all of a sudden. But you know, thing is, you can't change draft board that easily. There are months of process in there. Perhaps scouts didn't like anyone that much.  I thought Jordan Matthews was pretty good, and of all guys picked outside first round he did best. We picked Joel Bitonio and I can't really complain about that, he has been just awesome for us.   One can definitely blame them that we didn't pick a mind blowing WR after first 2 rounds but we stacked up on defense and run game.   Let's face it, our undrafted picks and other picks were pretty awesome. Kirksey, Crow, K'Waun Williams. That draft was solid. We yet have to see how will Manziel fare as well as how will Gilbert pan out.  I was pretty mad after that draft that we were left without a single notable WR, out of so many good ones, but hey, we played pretty good.  THIS YEAR.  You can't be mad at Shelton pick. Dude will help in our run defense so much. Same goes for Cooper. Orchard is great pass rusher, and we could use a bit of that, especially with Sheard gone. Erving was really great pick, dude can play any position in OL.  After that our defensive picks were again (IMO) pretty solid, another solid SS and CB which there is always a need of and a potential steal of the draft in Olomu. Pullard can be a steal as well considering he has constantly been playing at USC.  What about WRs? Welp, nothing special again. Had there been White when we were picking who knows what would've happened. I can't blame them for picking Shelton over Parker, I think top 2 WR were way ahead of rest of them. QB class is weak. We got another WR, one TE and one OLinemen so pretty much, we improved in offense as well.  Give it time, we'll see what will happen. Everyone wants a wide receiver, everyone wants a QB, EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE A GOOD OFFENSE.  But who knows, maybe Johnny pans out, maybe we'll get on the roll, maybe our big young trio of RBs can stomp all over opponenet's defense. We'll see, have fait in FO, they seem like they know what they're doing. We finally have a good coach who can really lead. BROWNS."
Browns,34ojkp,djroomba322,-4,Sun May 3 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"We had the 4th pick in the draft.  We could have of had any receiver we wanted for 10+ years.  Farmer knew that Gordon was going to be suspended for the season before the draft.  This wasn't some sort of surprise.    All kinds of trades could have been accomplished to move up and get a guy, or move down somewhere else.  But even holding our own picks we take Watkins and whoever is at 26 (bridgewater maybe? or still manziel?) done.   You can keep saying player B is better than player A, and that's fine, but when we have absolutely 0 quality receivers and B & A are close, you gotta get someone. Anyone.  Someone with real talent.    I totally understand your point, and in most cases I would agree with you.  But we're so far behind the 8 ball here.   I just want to win, just like you.  And like I said, this draft goes a long way in making our team better, but it was clearly a ""lets take safe picks and not fuck this up"" kind of draft.   I just look around the league and what does every single good team have?  A prototypical size QB from a pro style offense, and impact offensive weapons.  Some teams have great defenses, some have good, but all of them consistently have good QB and impact players.  And I don't feel we really adressed that. My heart says we can find a way to eek out like 10 wins just running and defense, but my brain says we see the same thing we always see.  Great QBs making plays, our QB not making plays.  And us finishing in the bottom of the barrel again."
Browns,34ojkp,LoLz14,2,Sun May 3 23:15:45 2015 UTC,"You definitely do have valid points, I agree with you that a WR is needed as much as a good QB. Maxbe FO has some other plans on how to run offense.  Either way, it""s gonna be really interesting. I wish people did not downvote you that much because your point is valid."
Browns,34ojkp,djroomba322,-4,Sun May 3 23:24:04 2015 UTC,"Oh and I hope this goes without saying, that Tight End is obviously a huge need as well.  And the whole Cameron thing is kind of a bummer.

You know, the team that just made back to back super bowls. With a short QB who plays a read option more often than most. And a group of WRs picked out of a cracker jack box.   Sure, QB and WR are important, I don't think you can argue that they're not, but at the end of the day, there's still 18 or 19 other starters on the team that have an equally large role in a team's success."
Browns,34ojkp,djroomba322,-3,Mon May 4 12:44:51 2015 UTC,"Seattle.  You know the team that has a prototypical QB from a pro style offense and impact weapons who just deemed it necessary to go get the best impact weapon they could find on the market in Graham?  Have you ever actually watched a Seahawks game?  Because I know the narrative is not great receivers.  Hawkins is the only receiver on our team which would make the roster for them, and he would be a 3rd or 4th option at best.  Their receivers are quite good and fill roles extremely well.   But the simple fact you think Wilson is ""just a guy"" means you already are missing the key and fundamental facts about their team.  Seattle literally just traded away a lineman to get a tight end.  Why arne't we building like Seattle's building?  That's all I ever hear from you apologists.  ""lets be more like seattle!""  Except we don't have a QB who can run an option.  We don't have any impact weapons.  THere are 18 or 19 other starters that have a large role to success, but you win games on QB and impact weapons."
Browns,34ojkp,Doyle524,3,Mon May 4 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"You win games by scoring more points than the other team. Simple fact. You can do that by putting up a lot of points on offense, or by allowing few points on defense. We're going for the latter, with help in the former from a running game that promises to be solid, and which will open up the pass game from a competent McCown or a breaking-through Johnny or Shaw if either shows dramatic improvement in camp or preseason.   I never said Wilson is ""just a guy"", I said he isn't prototypical. 5'11"", 206 with a proclivity for scrambling? Not prototypical at all. Neither is the great Drew Brees (6'0"", 209), although he is at least more of a pocket passer. In fact, McCown (6'4"", 218) is far more prototypical than either of them.   Also, I'd argue that we have a pretty damn solid group of ""role receivers"" on our roster. None can do it all (except maybe Gordon, and he can't keep himself on the field), but all of them can contribute in some meaningful way.   This year isn't a throwaway season, we have the pieces to make a run at the division."
Browns,34ojkp,djroomba322,-4,Mon May 4 13:06:04 2015 UTC,"Ugh.  Let me slow it down for you.  Russell wilson's prototypical criteria:  Footwork? Check.  Handsize? Check. Pro-style offense experience? Check.  Speed? Check.  Release? Check. Arm Strength? Check. Intelligent? Check.  No off the field issues? Check. Intangibles? Check. Height?  no check.  He fills pretty much every single thing you want except height.  McCown doesn't remotely check half of those and he's 36 and markedly untalented.  Show me another team with a worse passing attack than us.  Show me 2 teams.  You can't.  We don't have a ""solid group"".  We have ""the worst group in the league"".  We are easily, EASILY bottom 5 in terms of WR/TE and the fact you think this is debatable just means we're done here.   This year isn't a throwaway season, we have the pieces to make a run at the division.   Want to put your money where your mouth is? We can put some real cash down on this one.  The vegas over under will probably open at 5 wins for us.  If you think we're going to hit 9, or hell even 7, I'm more than willing to make some money off of our team's poor season.

Browns,34oemm,Nightcinder,1 point,Sun May 3 15:49:04 2015 UTC,"That's my biggest fear as well. Say they go 7-9 or worse for the next two years due to the lack of QB or offense then Farmer and co. are likely out and we'll have to rebuild again. Just like we have been for the last 15 years.   We've had other 'solid' drafts which address un-sexy positions in the past using high draft picks (Mack, Phil, Mingo, Schwartz, bitino, Thomas, Sheard) however so far none of these moves resulted in a winning season mostly because we have been unable to build a potent offense. I don't think we made any steps towards fixing this problem during the offseason.   In my opinion the best case scenario is 8-8 thanks to a great defense and we build an offense next offseason."
Browns,34oemm,Cory_mathews,1 point,Sun May 3 20:59:58 2015 UTC,7-9 3 consecutive years won't get them fired. There was no QB to have this offseason....none. Unless you wanted 3 first rounders for Mariota which is insane.
Browns,34oemm,Deadleggg,6,Mon May 4 12:21:04 2015 UTC,I'm not sold on Jimmy letting them both slide if we have an underwhelming season. Right now it's all smiles but we know all too well how attitudes change towards the end of the season.
Browns,34oemm,Witness_My_Greatness,10,Sun May 3 01:24:59 2015 UTC,"Yup, but I'm tired of never letting this team build some chemistry and properly rebuild. An owner has to give these guys a chance instead of having a high turnover that leads to a state of constant rebuilding and ever-changing gameplans leading to a team that's not cohesive since some picks were taken solely for this DC or OC's style in mind that might not adjust to a new coach well.   Now we're starting to hopefully get a team that has an identity and at the very least, a coach that will be here for quite some time. He's the first coach that I've REALLY liked from the get-go because of his demeanor and confidence. These guys have a vision so it's time to see it take shape over the next few years.   We HAVE to get some stability or else we're continue to struggle to convince free agents to come here and gain respect throughout the league. I'm tired of the way people view the organization and I hope past mistakes remain in the past and we're finally on our way to a proper competitive team.   Of course, this is the time where everyone is optimistic but it's hard not to be. I didn't get the WR I wanted, but the picks were pretty damn good for the most part and will make our defense a formidable foe in the trenches as well. It was definitely needed since it's kind of embarrassing to have such a good secondary but weak pass-rushing and horrible run defense which allowed teams to just wear us down and impose their wills on us even if they were struggling offensively in the past.  Hopefully this is the start of something great. Stick with the plan and I think good things will happen which is an odd thing to say. They need to look beyond just this year and see what a little stability could bring for the future.   Now, if Pettine goes off the deep end and Farmer trades Joe Haden for a new phone that holds the record for speed-texting, then I won't be upset if we start over. :P But this is a good foundation and I like Pettine a lot."
Browns,34oemm,demolitio4,1 point,Sun May 3 05:48:44 2015 UTC,Even if we suck this year if we show improvement at all they'll get another year at least.
Browns,34oemm,Nightcinder,1 point,Sun May 3 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"Then the ""fans"" (not saying you) need to be patient and not overreact when we have some growing pains. The more support we show our coach the less the media gets to write the ""hot seat"" narrative. That will be like pouring calamine lotion all over Jimmy's trigger finger."
Browns,34oemm,9planets,1 point,Sun May 3 17:06:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately for us, a large portion of our fan base aren't redditors and many have no patience left. You have to remember we're talking about the same fans that cheered for a couple of our own QBs getting injured."
Browns,34oemm,Witness_My_Greatness,1 point,Sun May 3 22:58:35 2015 UTC,"I think, barring an unmitigated disaster of a season that we haven't seen since Mangini, Pettine and Farmer will be back for next season. And I think we all know that if the season is a disaster that our QB situation is as well. If that's the case, I have a feeling that Haslam would allow the two one more crack at the position for the draft next year, and if they fail again, then they would be fired.  So, long story short, I don't see Farmer and Pettine going anywhere for another two years barring something ridiculous."
Browns,34oemm,VonJaeger,1 point,Sun May 3 07:26:11 2015 UTC,Learned his lesson after last year.
Browns,34oemm,farmerwouldsay,3,Sun May 3 01:40:59 2015 UTC,He fired The GM after they already started scouting and Pettine got hired on pretty late which explains some of the poor desicions. But I'm stoked at the picks we got year 1 and feel we added a ton of talent to compliment them and the Vets. Now I'm just praying we can keep Mack play Cam at RG/T and have a war for who gets the other spot on the Right side.
Browns,34oemm,Spartan_55,2,Sun May 3 04:26:19 2015 UTC,Schwartz is our RT.  Greco will become depth and our Line will look like this: 2 1 1 2 1 <-- That's an incredibly high-drafted line.
Browns,34oemm,Nightcinder,2,Sun May 3 15:50:48 2015 UTC,Are you looking at the line from the defense's perspective? Because Joe Thomas definitely wasn't drafted in the second
Browns,34oemm,Oskie5272,5,Sun May 3 16:27:46 2015 UTC,"Whoops, flip it around, 1 2 1 1 2 >_>"
Browns,34oemm,Nightcinder,2,Sun May 3 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"That is my biggest take away from this years draft. Last year they were not prepared and someone was likely interfering in it. Way too chaotic with moving around and going flashy. Maybe it was just rookie mistakes, or maybe it was something else, but this year they drafted as if they had a plan and were truly sticking to it."
Browns,34oemm,klax04,1 point,Sun May 3 04:01:30 2015 UTC,"Like Farmer said in his press conference, if you can move back and still get your guy you do it.  This year they had some guys fall to them at certain spots and they didn't want to trade around to get those guys."

Browns,34ocdn,GRunner6S,7,Sun May 3 01:39:14 2015 UTC,NFL.com gave us a B and said we reached to much but if they pan out all the players we drafted will be perfect fits in Cleveland
Browns,34ocdn,SmokeySmokes,2,Sun May 3 00:56:03 2015 UTC,"Shit doesn't make sense to me.   ""They drafted guys before they should've been drafted, but they're great picks.""  It's one or the other, to me. We had great picks, and the people at NFL.com are working at NFL.com because no NFL team called them up.   I'm happy with what the FO did, and I'm ecstatic they picked up the cb from Oregon. At worst, he doesn't pan out and we messed up on a 7th round pick. At best, he's a top 50 caliber player and we steal one of the best defensive back talents in the draft with a 7th round pick."

Browns,34ocdn,GRunner6S,-15,Sun May 3 01:53:50 2015 UTC,"It was a good draft. But it didn't address our biggest holes on the team.  I don't see how we don't have the worst passing attack in the league. I can't think of any other team who is even close? Receivers, tight ends, quarterbacks.  Even if we have a better running game, you can't pass in a passing league? Good luck winning more than five games."
Browns,34ocdn,djroomba322,8,Sun May 3 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone act like Hartline, Bowe, Gabriel, and Hawkins are chumps? None of them are #1 receivers but people act like they are practice squad material.  You don't necessarily need pass catching tight ends to win either. Lots of teams like Seattle and Denver have had success with mediocre pass targets.  What it really comes down to is QB. The QB play for us will dictate the 2015-16 season."
Browns,34ocdn,jswolfie316,-9,Sun May 3 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"Well Seattle went out and got graham because they see the value in a pass catching tight end.  Our oc said pass catching tight end is very important to our offense. We don't have one.  I can't believe you think anyone else would take bowe.  Gabriel couldn't make a playoff team roster, and Hartline had not had a good year since his pcl year and has lost a step.  Tell me a team who has a worse passing attack. You can't. We have easily, EASILY a bottom 5 passing game."
Browns,34ocdn,djroomba322,2,Sun May 3 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"No one would take a vet WR who is solid as 2nd or 3rd on the depth chart? No one would keep a promising deep threat WR on their roster over a practice squad player?  Although it would be nice to have a #1, it's not the receivers. It's the quarterbacks."
Browns,34ocdn,jswolfie316,2,Sun May 3 03:05:51 2015 UTC,"You're right. But I am willing to argue that this draft fits quite nicely with what Pettine and Farmer have been preaching from day 1. I'm still of the belief that they intend to grab that pass catching threat whenever they feel that time is right. Like it or not, we are still a rebuilding team and all optimism aside this FO has brought in talent who fit nicely in what we are trying to do. So many other times it didn't make sense. (Weeden to run a west coast offense.)  I know you have your reservations on Farmer, but you must at least admit there is at least a shred of competence there?"
Browns,34ocdn,Trilljoy,-4,Sun May 3 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"Sure.  I think he is the best gm we've had since our return. But he suffers the same fatal flaw that all the others did.  They thought they could outsmart the room. They thought that they could draft smarter than the other day 31 guys, and it's ultimately going to be his undoing.  His picks aren't going to look great when we lose 10+ games scoring like 13 points a game.  And hell be given one more year? Draft another spread guy next year. Hell suffer the same fate, and the same nightmare continues to plague us."
Browns,34ocdn,djroomba322,1 point,Sun May 3 04:28:40 2015 UTC,Hartline had an off year last year but the previous 2 he went over 1000. Gabriel is a 2nd year player and Hawk is a damn good slot guy. The Hawks traded a 1st for Graham who with Drew Brees had a losing season...in which they lost to Brian Hoyer and some midgets.

Browns,34ocdn,Deadleggg,1 point,Sun May 3 03:17:45 2015 UTC,There wasn't a QB at 12...or 19....or in the 2nd or 3rd round to take. Petty barely knows what a playbook is and won't see the field much in the next 3 years. Hoyer is a better QB than McCown and got run out of town.  We added 2 receivers in the offseason and drafted one. We drafted 2 tight ends and a pass catching hback. Was Randy Moss sitting there that I wasn't aware of?  Our running game collapsed after mack went down and our defense was dead last in run defense and we only had 31 sacks. All 3 of those problems were addressed in the draft.

Browns,34nl1q,SANDFIGHT,4,Sat May 2 21:16:30 2015 UTC,There are 2 rules that kinda stand out between CFB and NFL.    CFB requires 1 foot in bounds. NFL requires 2.  CFB runners are down by contact regardless of defensive player touching. (If you fall on your own you are down). NFL players are only down once a defensive player touches them while down.
Browns,34nl1q,BurningBeard24,3,Sat May 2 21:26:06 2015 UTC,Ohhhhh that explains why CBs thy make crazy athletic interceptions always get back up and just start celebrating instead of running them back lol.  Is there any reason for this rule? Player safety?

Browns,34o1ib,SmokeySmokes,16,Sat May 2 22:54:09 2015 UTC,"I don't like ""grading"" a draft until after giving it at least a year to see how players pan out.  On paper though, you really couldn't have had a better draft than Ray Farmer and the Browns organization had this year.  We hit on all of our needs, added some depth, and most importantly we went after high character, ""football-is-my-life-I'm-not-just-here-for-a-paycheck"" type of guys.  I have absolutely nothing to complain about.  Very well done."

Browns,34o1ib,tsaihi,3,Sun May 3 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"This draft was extremely thin at QB and TE, would you have rather picked Grayson or Petty in round 2 to fill a need?"

Browns,34o1ib,tsaihi,1 point,Sun May 3 00:41:15 2015 UTC,Yea but for that we would have needed 1st overall and another late round first.
Browns,34o1ib,Cleveland_man,4,Mon May 4 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"But we still hit them.  Just because they came later in the draft does not automatically make them worthless.  We picked up solid veteran WRs in free agency (I know a lot of the fanbase is unimpressed by either of these, but they're both out to prove something and I'm not writing them off), Gabriel showed us flashes last year, plus we still have Hawkins and by most accounts Mayle is going to be able to contribute assuming he has a good preseason.  Dray and Barnidge, despite not being the highlight-reel pass-catching TEs are still both solid, especially as blockers in our run game.  Maxx Williams by all accounts was an egotistical douchebag in his pre-draft interviews, which no doubt contributed to his falling draft stock.  He would have been a nice addition, but he would have bolted the first chance he had.  We made two late-draft selections, hoping to develop them (assuming both make it on the final roster) and groom them into the type of TE we need. Edit forgot one of them is going to get put at FB, and the other is more of a blocking TE anyways... it still helps the overall goal though, which is fortifying our run blocking.  We weren't going to find an answer at QB this year.  I'm not even going to talk about this one any further.  The good (read: great) news is that we have a GM and a head coach that are on the same page, trying to build an identity for our franchise.  It starts in the trenches.  It features a heavy run-first, playaction offense.  We have 2 RBs coming off solid rookie years, and added a 3rd who is going to complement them all nicely.  After fortifying our O-line, our run game is sure to be stronger than ever.  Maybe we didn't ""hit on"" WR or TE in the ""OH WOW LOOK WHO THE BROWNS PICKED UP WHAT A PLAYMAKER""-sense.  But we definitely picked up some players who can help make us better at those spots.  I'd still consider those needs hit on."
Browns,34o1ib,AMAZINGshaun,2,Sun May 3 00:16:09 2015 UTC,"What's the point of another project QB?  And that's all you get outside the top 10 in the draft.  Of all fanbases, we should know best how easy it is to waste picks taking a flier on a QB when the foundation isn't there.  I think the avoiding WR thing is thoroughly baked into Farmer's philosophy.  Two of the most successful teams in recent years, NE and Sea, are perfect examples of the notion that you win by investing in the core of your team (lines in particular) and plugging in WRs you get off the heap to complete the picture.  And the Harline/Bowe duo isn't exactly garbage.  I feel like people (especially national ""draft gurus"") are too simplistic in identifying needs.  Nobody would have said OL was a need at the start of last season, but one injury showed how important it is to have depth there.  And I'd much rather have a deeper/more talented OL than a stud WR.  Gordon's return showed how useless even a top talent is when the D can't get off the field and the OL can't keep the QB upright.  OTOH, when the lines play well, Taylor Gabriel can look like an all-pro.  I would say our top needs were: run-stopping DL talent (check), OL depth (check), a pass rusher (check), and versatile offensive weapons (we'll have to see, but they certainly took shots here).    My only complaint would be that I don't know how much upside Telfer has as a weapon.  I would have liked to see a guy like Cameron, who was picked as an athlete.  Then again, he hurt everywhere except catching passes.    Mayle is a perfect compliment guys like Hawkins and Gabriel as an extra WR, and looks like he could be a Colston-like WR/TE hybrid type of guy.  Johnson could fill the Darren Sproles ""mismatch weapon"" role.  Telfer looks more like a ""put him in there right away and he won't be a liability"" guy, but not a weapon like Cameron could be.  Anyway, day 2 picks are always crapshoots, but I feel like the bodies we got are all guys who aren't boom-or-bust as much as likely backup/ST contributor, possible starters.  And what we need are more guys who are at least adequate."

Browns,34o1ib,deputydon,2,Sat May 2 23:40:42 2015 UTC,"I dont want to give a ""grade"" either, but I wanted to comment on at least 2 things I noticed with Farmers draft  Firstly, the sheer number of players drafted 12 as opposed to just 6 last year. I like this move, especially with the value players they nabbed Charles Gaines and (It goes without saying) Ifo Ekpre, among others. I think thats awesome and especially with the value they got in each rounds.   Why 2 tight ends? They signed Housler, you cant take 5 into the season, and you have to wonder how valuable 6th round TE selections would be as opposed to Maxx Williams (perfect for Flip) who went at 55 to a divisional rival no less. I really think he missed here, You know one of those tight ends wont make the 53 team come august, so the pick is valueless. there is definitely a package deal somewhere between picks in rounds 4-7 (even 3, i think) if youre the Browns.   I dont know...Im not upset with the picks overall but you have to appreciate the value of a Maxx Williams or a Jaelen Strong over the value a 6+ round picks may/may not offer(bust potential). Like Why Vince Mayle when you can have a Strong."
Browns,34o1ib,uuunity,5,Sat May 2 23:54:18 2015 UTC,Malcom Johnson is going to be playing FB.   Randall Telfer excels in run Blocking and can open some holes but that's probably it. He also has had some knee issues in the past.
Browns,34o1ib,Ihateloops,2,Sun May 3 00:10:42 2015 UTC,"Can't agree more with you about Maxx Williams. We were in the perfect spot to take the best TE in the draft, and fill out biggest hole on our team,  and opted out of doing so.   I love our draft overall but I really wish we would have taken Maxx."
Browns,34o1ib,zeek0us,1 point,Sun May 3 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"I like every player they drafted and think they got solid value at the picks, but I'm definitely also a bit concerned at the lack of offensive playmakers added. Malcolm Johnson is a FB/H-back, Telfer is a blocking tight end, Mayle intrigues me, but is raw. Duke Johnson is the only player they came away from this draft with that I think might be able to give the offense a punch, and he has to join a solid RB rotation.  Sometimes reaching/overpaying slightly is ok if you have deep needs at positions."
Browns,34o1ib,Ihateloops,1 point,Sun May 3 00:15:15 2015 UTC,"Look at our depth chart, though.  Hartline and Bowe is a quality front-like WR duo.  Hawkins/Gabriel/Benjamin are all good change-of-pace options who've proven they can be productive.  Adding Mayle provides a big body to offset those little guys, and was productive in college (can't argue with 106/1400 in the pac-12).  Pettine's offensive philosophy is clearly based on a run-first attack.  We have West/Crowell already, so adding Johnson offers the perfect third dimension (small, shifty, good receiver).  It's true that we don't have that threat at TE (but how much of that big body mismatch role is invested in Mayle?), but I feel like Cameron's worthlessness as anything but a mismatch in the passing game bothered the staff.  Seems to me that they want big bodies who can run block (to be on the field in any situation), and exploit mismatches if they're afterthoughts in coverage."
Browns,34o1ib,zeek0us,1 point,Sun May 3 05:59:46 2015 UTC,"Our big difference in opinion is on the worth of Hartline and Bowe. I am not at all enthused by them as our starting receivers. Hartline has been a decent receiver, but incredibly inconsistent, and Bowe is just plain not good anymore at all. he's a big guy, but too slow to actually create separation, and isn't a good enough technical route runner to overcome his lack of foot speed."
Browns,34o1ib,Ihateloops,3,Sun May 3 06:04:05 2015 UTC,"Bowe is only 30, and he's a big guy.  You're right that it's not clear if he's done or just needed a change in scenery, but I would put him about on par with Miles Austin last season, and I thought Austin was a great pickup.  The other thing is that picking WRs is a crapshoot unless it's Megatron.  For every Odell Beckham, there are two Darrius Heyward-Beys.  I feel like the ratio of guys picked to guys that become valuable contributors is lowest for receivers.   We agree that there are questions about the WR corps, but I prefer the strategy of addressing needs that minimize the reliance on the WRs.  Farmer is on record noting that high-priced WR talent is weakly correlated to team success.  I think the odds of finding a ""diamond in the rough"" are a lot higher when you build a team/offense that asks receivers to do specific things -- like with the NE passing game.    Anyway, I kind of agree with Farmer in that flashy, high-priced WRs seem to be spread pretty evenly between good and bad teams.  Good lines, versatile players, and solid depth tend to be cluster on winning teams."

I think allowing some stability and not putting anyone new in the mix is the best thing to do.   I like we shot our big wad on Dline and Oline, seriously it is so cliched to say that's where you win but there, I said it.   Overall I like what we did, no big splash, just solid players at positions that we needed to address."

Browns,34mzd4,pragmaticzach,20,Sat May 2 17:10:39 2015 UTC,"This pick seems pretty good.

Browns,34mzd4,Hougie,6,Sat May 2 17:20:32 2015 UTC,He was a finalist for the Biletnikoff award twice (best receiver in the NCAA).  Last year he set WSU records for most receptions in a season and most receiving yards in a season.  He was also one of only a handful of NCAA receivers to record a 250 yard game last season.

That's pretty impressive and telling of his talent. Don't know how you can't count Crabtree as the #1 WR on a team that went to the NFC Championship two consecutive years.  If anything the rookie part plays into this even better. Recently, there have been even more successful Air Raid transitions to the NFL than there have ever been before. Evans being the breakout success and the rest of the guys being solid foundations for their respective teams."

Browns,34nkof,JohnStamosBRAH,14,Sat May 2 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"Pettine's been talking up how hard it is to scheme against a TE/H-back hybrid since he came here and it sounded like from Johnson's interview the Browns were really targeting this guy.  I know he's a later round pick, but I could see him being given the opportunity to be a big part of the offense.  Here's a good link showing the ways he can be used."
Browns,34nkof,surlysci,2,Sat May 2 21:01:13 2015 UTC,"Sweet! Thanks for the link, looks like an all-around player at TE."
Browns,34nkof,Doyle524,1 point,Sat May 2 22:41:15 2015 UTC,I didn't listen to a few of the 6th+ rd picks but it seemed like none of them were surprised the Browns picked them. They knew who they liked and got them.

He said they debated moving up but thought the guys they were targeting would be there in the 6th so they stayed put.  They also supposedly got offers for higher picks next year but decided they wanted the players they were targeting this year more than a 5th rounder next year."

Browns,34nj2k,sba_17,2,Sat May 2 21:02:49 2015 UTC,"In my mind, wr's aren't valued very high. I'm a Seattle fan too, and between Bowe, Hartline, Hawkins, Gabriel, and now Mayle, we can run a pretty baller rotation. That's what Seattle has done, and it suited them well. In the worst case, Manziel and our wr's don't work out, so we draft offense next year. We got so many defensive players this year that next year can be offensive-focused."
Browns,34nj2k,stangstang,3,Sat May 2 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"It works for seattle cause their offense is focused on wilson and lynch.  It might end up working out for the browns eventually. But with all the questions on offense, you need to start somewhere."
Browns,34nj2k,sba_17,1 point,Sat May 2 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"With the addition of Erving to our line, we just might have a good running game next year. Crowell and Duke Johnson might be a killer combo.

Browns,34mwtl,Witness_My_Greatness,2,Sat May 2 17:14:53 2015 UTC,Lots of good I saw from this guy. Can play downhill on the run and make open field tackles.HE also can take on a blocker and shed and make a tackle. He has great hands and seems to have solid coverage. I'm guessing he is a SS and will back up Whitner more but can also play FS.
Browns,34mwtl,Kenya151,2,Sat May 2 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"What I really loved about watching the highlights was that after a great play, he just got up and just went about playing. No ridiculous high fives or prancing around for ""tackling"". Looks like a great pick."

Browns,34mtki,hiburd,11,Sat May 2 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"Difference being: Braylon was drafted in the 1st round. Mayle was drafted in the 4th. Such a better place to risk these kinds of drafts, and this just goes to show how much better our front office is now than then."

Browns,34mtki,spoongrd,6,Sat May 2 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"He's apples and oranges to Travis Benjamin. The bigger concern is that he would be like a Greg Little, they have similar size/athleticism/drop concerns.  But Little was a 2nd-round pick that was expected to start immediately. Mayle can play a few reps this year, but still spend time on the bench learning and developing."
Browns,34mtki,mulch17,5,Sat May 2 18:09:33 2015 UTC,He is nothing like Travis Benjamin...
Browns,34mtki,nizule,-1,Sat May 2 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"I just remember GL* being a big target receiver, but lacked in fundamentals (aka catching the damn ball). Mayle may be a physical beast, but he hasn't been playing that long. I hope he can nail the fundamental stuff and not struggle learning them in the NFL"
Browns,34mtki,spoongrd,2,Sat May 2 18:12:01 2015 UTC,Huh? Benjamin is one of the shortest guys on the team

Browns,34mtki,Ihateloops,11,Sat May 2 20:52:05 2015 UTC,"Manziel, McCown, Lewis, Shaw.. Whoever wins the QB competition. They'll throw to whoever is open off play action, similar to what made Hoyer so successful for the first part of the year last year."
Browns,34mtki,inferno167,4,Sat May 2 20:58:05 2015 UTC,It is only a passing league until someone shows the analysts that is isn't.  All it takes is a coach that uses fresh ideas and prove everyone wrong.

Could be plenty of value picks left, maybe some small school guys. Would like to see some ILB depth. Maybe take a look at a FB and Kicker, possibly Mark Weisman from Iowa and Tom Obarski from Concordia-St. Paul to round out the draft. Gotta say though, pretty solid job by Farmer this year, can't complain with any pick."

Browns,34mtki,btoch23,2,Sat May 2 19:20:17 2015 UTC,How is Michael Bennett still on the board?  Was supposed to go in the 2nd round and we're about to start the 6th.
Browns,34mtki,rufus418,3,Sat May 2 19:23:05 2015 UTC,There goes Bennett to Jaguars.
Browns,34mtki,pelijr,2,Sat May 2 19:40:35 2015 UTC,"There are a few shockers, that's number one right now. After La'el Collins, Bennett is the best available"
Browns,34mtki,inferno167,2,Sat May 2 19:25:34 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Collins said he won't sign with anybody if he gets drafted in a later round

Browns,34mtki,UrbanAppalachian,2,Sat May 2 19:56:27 2015 UTC,Charles Gaines? That's the name the r/nfl page has us picking but I'm pretty sure we haven't picked yet have we?
Browns,34mtki,enragedcactus,1 point,Sat May 2 19:59:33 2015 UTC,Yeah we got him
Browns,34mtki,PolishMusic,2,Sat May 2 20:00:22 2015 UTC,Seems like a BPA pick.

Browns,34mtki,rsipp512,2,Sat May 2 21:14:45 2015 UTC,"Good. Seemed like ILB was the last area we needed a bit of depth. What do you guys think, does Tre Mcbride drop to our final pick, and will Farmer actually take 2 WR's, or do we draft a kicker?"
Browns,34mtki,Ihateloops,1 point,Sat May 2 21:13:37 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine either way. Though at this rate our choices seem to be TE or Run-blocking/defense ""something"""
Browns,34mtki,rufus418,1 point,Sat May 2 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"I really like McBride, and I would hope Farmer would take him if he's there, but I doubt he'll pull the trigger if he sees good value elsewhere."

Browns,34mtki,inferno167,3,Sat May 2 16:27:15 2015 UTC,They've shown that they will pay what they think is right or let them walk.

Browns,34mtki,inferno167,1 point,Sat May 2 17:41:04 2015 UTC,What did we get for that 2nd pick?
Browns,34mtki,average_white_male,1 point,Sat May 2 16:53:02 2015 UTC,Safety looks like another cover guy we can put on the field in passing downs. Depth at safety and probably a pick for the future to develop behind whitner

Browns,34mtki,meximeme,1 point,Sat May 2 17:14:21 2015 UTC,Maybe they feel Tre is going to fall to later rounds so acting now wouldn't be good form.   Or maybe we're just overhyped
Browns,34mtki,SpartaWillBurn,1 point,Sat May 2 17:15:54 2015 UTC,Any crazy predictions for the 7th? I'm going to predict Connor Halliday with our final pick.

Browns,34mtki,mulch17,1 point,Sat May 2 22:14:25 2015 UTC,Please tell me that we're at least going to bring in an undrafted kicker now...
Browns,34mtki,blackedout,2,Sat May 2 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"Kyle Brindza, Justin Manton, Sam Ficken, Jared Roberts, Tom Obarski, and Josh Lambo are all UDFA's. I'd imagine Farmer would pursue at least one."
Browns,34nli5,Baconaholic,4,Sat May 2 20:24:44 2015 UTC,"I already like him! He's a big guy, isn't he?"
Browns,34nli5,sba_17,5,Sat May 2 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"USC fan here, he's probably the best TE we've had in the last 5 years. Easily better than Jordan Cameron, imo. Way more aggressive in all aspects. Also I don't really understand the knocks about his catching on NFL.com, we just don't pass to TEs much because we're a WR factory but he looked damn good when Barkley was around."
Browns,34nli5,TheSyrianSensation,5,Sat May 2 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think he has huge upside, and he was probably drafted as more of a run-blocker anyways. Just out of curiosity, why are all of his clips from 2011? What happened in recent years?"
Browns,34moy4,SeamusThePirate,20,Sat May 2 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"Not really even sure how plugging him at guard is wasting his potential?  He can play anywhere on the line.  He's not even originally a fucking center.  Pretty sure he was originally a LT, then moved to center at some point."
Browns,34moy4,themitey1,8,Sat May 2 16:00:39 2015 UTC,Exactly! I think he only moved to center last year. He'll be a BEAST on our line.
Browns,34moy4,blackedout,4,Sat May 2 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"Dude started college at DT. Fuck the media, I think this was a great pick. Showed that the front office is really being strategic."
Browns,34moy4,pg5042,28,Sat May 2 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"THIS JUST IN: The sports media story lines are straight up retarded. They deal in entertainment, not news or analysis. Stop paying attention to it, or at least limit yourself to trusted unbiased sources, and your will have a happier life. Unless of course you enjoy getting mad at stupid bullshit ""news"", in which case go ahead and keep listening."
Browns,34moy4,LiterallyHitner31,23,Sat May 2 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"I hate how the analysis of every pick is ""he will be good and a great scheme fit, but he isn't a WR!!!, C+"""
Browns,34moy4,this_is_my_reddit_UN,2,Sat May 2 16:34:27 2015 UTC,"I get that its entertainment, I just dont feel that being informed and entertaining are mutually exclusive. Its not like its a huge story, so misrepresenting the facts to keep a flimsy narrative is foolish. If thry're worried about entertainment, then fill air with the Mack story during the pick instead of one dismissive sentence."
Browns,34moy4,ErroneousOnAllCounts,-1,Sat May 2 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"Are you paying for it? If not, you really have no say in what they decide to spew. If you pay attention to it, you are in no way entitled to be able to shape their agenda or complain about their unfairness. It's really not hard to not go to Yahoo Sports/Bleacher Report/Gawker/Deadspin or any other ""news"" cite that puts lame opinions up to get page clicks. Stop being a baby and stop reading their shit. It's like asking a child the meaning of life and being pissed that they scream ""Ice Cream!"" instead of giving you an enlightening answer that challenges your previous philosophical viewpoint on your life"
Browns,34moy4,nizule,1 point,Sat May 2 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. You can even see the progressions of the hosts over the past few years. The hosts are obsessed with achieving radio stardom, and cannot be considered analysts or journalists by any stretch. They love talking about food and entertainment more than sports. This goes for Rizzo, Bull & Fox, and more. The reason people like Ken Carmen is because he is a bit more knowledgable and sticks to his roots."
Browns,34moy4,nizule,7,Sat May 2 16:25:13 2015 UTC,"I consider myself an above-casual fan, but the knowledge of prospects and team situations expressed from radio hosts is appalling. If you don't know the ins and outs of even just the first round picks, you shouldn't be discussing the draft. Its pathetic. They spend all of their time thinking about ways to spin a Mariota or Manziel story, but can't take the time to read about the quiet ""studs"". This is not just in Cleveland, and does not just pertain to Erving."
Browns,34moy4,d-a-f-f-y,3,Sat May 2 16:17:29 2015 UTC,"Yup. I was listening to a podcast where they kept saying ""browns draft a backup center in round one"". It was annoying"
Browns,34moy4,admiralkit,3,Sat May 2 19:23:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this strikes me as spot on.  Considering the salary cap will have gone up approximately $20M between when Mack signed his contract and when he has the option to opt out, it would be smart business for him to opt out and see what he could get, even if it was still with Cleveland.  This is our backup plan, especially considering how fucked we were when Mack got injured.  If Mack gets injured again, Erving steps in.  If Mack opts out, Erving steps in.  If Mack stays with us and doesn't get injured, then we've got a starter-quality lineman who can step in at and take over any position. (Also an issue is that Schwartz, for as much as we rag on him here, is in a contract year and would be an upgrade for many other O-lines around the league).  Edit: didn't grammer good."
Browns,34moy4,GregEdge,2,Sun May 3 01:43:58 2015 UTC,"Also, just be aware that the media is now controlled by hack ""journalists"" wielding Twitter accounts. That's why there are so many fucky stories that come out, only to be refuted within minutes. They don't do any research, they don't fully understand the sport(s) they cover, they are just there- in front of an iMac, trying desperately not to drool on the keyboard, so they can get an office at some point."
Browns,34moy4,pievdelta,3,Sat May 2 20:03:57 2015 UTC,They also think we still are DESPERATE for a WR...washed up executives go to the media guys that still understand what is going on have a job.
Browns,34moy4,Deadleggg,4,Sat May 2 16:18:56 2015 UTC,Hawk had a good season and Gabriel showed promise. We added Hartline and Bowe to give us 4 above average guys. The Seahawks won with less.
Browns,34moy4,Greenlytrees,-3,Sat May 2 16:59:50 2015 UTC,The Seahawks also have Russell Wilson and the D.  Sorry but I literally lol'ed at your comment.
Browns,34moy4,Deadleggg,2,Sat May 2 18:56:58 2015 UTC,Talking about receivers only.
Browns,34moy4,Greenlytrees,0,Sat May 2 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"But my point is you can have nobodies at receiver only if you have a great QB and defense around them, which we don't as of yet. Having better receivers would help cover for those deficiencies."
Browns,34moy4,Deadleggg,1 point,Sun May 3 04:01:19 2015 UTC,"We don't have bad receivers. All are above average. Hartline is solid and a possession guy and is yer off from 2 1000 yard seasons. He's an upgrade over Miles Austin.  Hawk stays, Gabriel should improve in yer two. Bowe gives us flexibility but isn't a true number 1 any longer but as part of the corps he's an upgrade over anyone we had this past season.  Overall we added 3 WRs an h back and a tight end. It's been upgraded. If there's a lack of a superstar talk to Gordon not Farmer."
Browns,34moy4,Areason2Laugh,1 point,Sun May 3 13:46:33 2015 UTC,"We do need help at WR. We have some good WRs but we need a great one now that we lost Josh. Bowe was the best free agent we could nab, now it's time to try to score in the draft. I'm glad they didn't draft a WR high though. WRs are weapons, and I'm glad we got more of them."
Browns,34moy4,WaffylesYay,-2,Sun May 3 12:51:23 2015 UTC,Most of those folks on the radio have not played a lick of football and know nothing. Cleveland Browns daily should be all that's worth listening too if you want real info.
Browns,34n18c,blackedout,3,Sat May 2 17:26:11 2015 UTC,Nice looks like he can take a hit and still get yardage.

Browns,34n18c,Doyle524,3,Sat May 2 22:32:36 2015 UTC,"Cleveland creating a fanbase in Pullman, Washington with Cooper and Mayle picks lol. I'm a Texans fan but I will definitely be following the Browns closer now."

Browns,34n18c,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,1 point,Sat May 2 22:56:59 2015 UTC,I thought we didn't draft a wide receiver.
Browns,34mzpg,UrDone87,7,Sat May 2 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"I like it! Maybe Farmers thought process for offense is if you can't get a top talent guy at a position, take as many offensive weapons later in the draft and hope someone turns out to be a stud. Who knows. I like it."
Browns,34mzpg,DREWBICE,7,Sat May 2 17:19:50 2015 UTC,Or maybe we'll be able to get some of the better UDFA WRs since they know they have a better shot to make the roster with us?
Browns,34mzpg,iliekdrugs,2,Sat May 2 17:22:05 2015 UTC,Possibly! I mean wasn't Gordon a like compensatory pick?
Browns,34mzpg,iliekdrugs,6,Sat May 2 17:23:58 2015 UTC,Supplemental draft
Browns,34mzpg,NewDogSameTricks,2,Sat May 2 17:26:16 2015 UTC,That's right.. Haha either way.. the studs are out there!
Browns,34mzpg,lordcorbran,3,Sat May 2 17:27:51 2015 UTC,"Well he had opportunity to take top talent WR's per ""rankings,"" but opted for other positions.  Seems more to me that he values them like the NFL values RB's today.  Not to say we didn't have other needs as well.  Time will tell...."
Browns,34mzpg,Deadleggg,3,Sat May 2 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear they're going for the Seattle-type model, and they seem to just pick guys off the street at that position."
Browns,34mzpg,RyanEbie33,1 point,Sat May 2 17:55:15 2015 UTC,Or he saw Gordon go off and won more games with Hawkins and Austin. Being dead last in run defense was a bigger worry.
Browns,34mzpg,Samuelmantell,6,Mon May 4 12:40:00 2015 UTC,He's over 6'.. I'm happy regardless at this point! haha
Browns,34mzpg,Jhonopolis,6,Sat May 2 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"Another Senior Bowl player for the Browns, I have to start watching that game more."
Browns,34mzpg,bearsdriving,4,Sat May 2 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"Sounds like we've drafted squarely along ""Play Like A Brown"" lines. Hard working, competitive, lovers of the game. Love that he mentioned special teams and one of the shots on one of his reels was a special teams tackle. But honestly 6'2, big frame, and work ethic are a welcome combo."
Browns,34mzpg,Deadleggg,3,Sat May 2 17:53:32 2015 UTC,"Seems like a really intelligent guy, very mature."
Browns,34mzpg,Matthew345,2,Sat May 2 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"How come no ones mentioned that he has only played receiver for two years? That is crazy to me, means he has a possible huge upside."
Browns,34mzpg,topper_mango,1 point,Sat May 2 23:37:54 2015 UTC,He comes from an air raid offense so he at least had a ton of balls thrown at him
Browns,34mzpg,moodyfloyd,1 point,Mon May 4 12:40:51 2015 UTC,"It was either him or Darren Waller.. I think I would have liked Darren Waller better, the Browns front office must see something in this guy that they liked. He seems mature and hungry so.. Kinda shitty he's only been a WR for two years, but he's got a lot of upside."
Browns,34mzpg,topper_mango,3,Sat May 2 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"I think they're taking a chance on the trend of former basketball players being successful in the league also, no downside, but tremendous upside if he gets the right coaching."
Browns,34n5nm,fakeshits,1 point,Sat May 2 18:04:15 2015 UTC,Is it hard to greatly improve a rb vision for inside running? It seems to me guys either come in the league with it or are always mediocre/poor at it. If we can coach that up a lot he could be a 3 down back.
Browns,34n5nm,jg87iroc,1 point,Mon May 4 01:27:13 2015 UTC,"That part of the scouting profile baffled me...He is known for his vision.  His whole life this guy has been legendary in South Florida for having that vision with burst, like a young frank gore."

Browns,34no78,PolishMusic,22,Sat May 2 20:49:07 2015 UTC,Bitches forgot about (Jim) Dray
Browns,34no78,Ihateloops,8,Sat May 2 21:11:31 2015 UTC,He's been in the league a few years now and hasn't shown anyone that he is a starting caliber tight end.
Browns,34no78,Dustin65,3,Sat May 2 20:55:44 2015 UTC,Barnidge is already 29. He'll be out of the league in a couple years
Browns,34no78,StalinOut,2,Sat May 2 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"He's a nice dude, consistent catcher. But he's not a gronk"
Browns,34no78,cudada,1 point,Sun May 3 01:15:51 2015 UTC,I agree with you.  I think he's been perfect in clutch situations during the last season.  He could certainly start the next couple seasons while mentoring the new recruits.
Browns,34p6s5,Shleppel,20,Sun May 3 07:26:41 2015 UTC,"It's Walterfootball. We could win the Super Bowl and he would shit on us for not winning by enough. He also goes by how he ranks the players and not how others rank them. Overall the guy is not any good at what he does, but for some reason he is popular.   He completely misses that Erving was taken as a replacement in case Mack leaves, which is a real possibility, and that Mariota was going to cost too much. The Titans obviously wanted him and were asking for more than he is worth. Mariota is far from a sure fire prospect, and I am happy we passed on trading up to get him."
Browns,34p6s5,klax04,4,Sun May 3 08:54:32 2015 UTC,Mariota was going to cost too much   Look at what they turned down from the Eagles...we'd have to give them our entire fucking team.
Browns,34p6s5,740Buckeye,2,Sun May 3 12:28:52 2015 UTC,"If Chip Kelly says Tennessee was asking too much for a player he dearly wanted, I think Farmer/Pettine are telling the truth when they say their discussions never progressed past an initial stage months ago.

Browns,34p6s5,Daviroth,-3,Sun May 3 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"It'll be an absolute disaster if the Browns go into the 2015 season with Josh McCown and Johnny Rehab as their two quarterbacks.   Fair? Probably a bit of hyperbole, but there isn't a QB situation in the league worse than ours.   I have no problem with the Danny Shelton pick, but the Cameron Erving selection is baffling. The only reason Erving emerged as a first-round prospect was because of how well he played at center compared to the other positions.    Fair?  Yes.  Good player, but we are going to be playing him out of position and he'll only really be utilized if one of our other players leaves.  Not really what you want in a 1st round talent.  You want to add a piece that does something you don't already have to make your team better this year, so that Mack doesn't want to leave.  A top tier offensive talent will help you win games WITH mack.  Erving, again, nice player, doesn't appreciably make our team better this year.   I liked some of Cleveland's other selections like Xavier Cooper and Ibraheim Campbell, but they once again failed to find a play-maker   I suppose Duke Johnson is our ""playmaker"".  But we're basically going to be a poor mans Kansas City chiefs.  Good defense with an average QB (Our QB isn't average) with a good pass catching back (Johnson is no Charles) and literally Dwanye Bowe.   The one receiver they drafted was Vince Mayle. They took him in the fourth round, when he probably belonged in the fifth or sixth.   Im not going to comment on this guy, he'll probably be a practice squad guy like Moore.  Our draft is fine, if we were another team.  Every team got better this off season.  It isn't like we're the only ones to add players.  After free agency, and after the draft lets take a look at our offense:  Travis Benjamin:  Yikes.  Don't know why he was on the team before last year, and amazed he's still on it.  Dwanye Bowe:  We saw him last year in a ""power run offense"" and we can expect more of the same.  Pretty much nothing. Even if he has a career year and stops dropping the ball because of his mangled finger, he's old and lost a step.  But he can block kind of?  Taylor Gabriel:  Short, not great route runner.  He's like if deshawn jackson was slower and with no moves.  He plays hard which is good, but he doesn't make the roster of another NFL team and got the majority of his catches as an after thought action.  Hartline:  If we had him 4 years ago, he's a great #2.  But everyone says he lost catches because of the players he was with.  Except that just means he wasn't good enough to be the guy being thrown to.  And that's going to translate here too.  And he clearly lost a step after his surgery.   Hawkins:  Good player, but he should be the 3rd option and he's going to be continually playing above his station here because we don't have weapons.  Draft:  we picked up one guy who's probably going to be a practice squad guy, or hopefully make us cut benjamin.  Dray/Barnidge:  not great receivers.  Good blockers.  Eh.  They'd probably make the roster of most teams as utility guys.  But neither are impact players, neither draw even attention in the passing game which is why they end up catching a few passes.  Housler:  he's been in the league for four years with a close to elite QB and has 1 touchdown and 1 fumble.  Sure, he's been on a team with weapons.  That should mean he's getting even more open and nothing.  I don't understand how this guys an answer?  West / Crowell :  They're not special.  They're decent to good which is a huge upgrade over players like Richardson and oby.  But they're not special players you can build an offense around (which we are apparently doing).    Johnson:  He looks good.  If he can stay healthy he can possibly be special.   But he's not a power back that I can tell, and if we're building for a power run game I don't see him excelling in that.    Manziel/McCown:  Single worst QB situation in the league by far.  And it isn't close.  Manziel's troubles are well documented and I think people don't realize how incredibly difficult it is to come from a spread offense and transition into a prostyle. It isn't a 4 month process.  He's not going to be able to do it in 4 months, and it will probabyl take a couple years.  If Manziel is the guy we're going to let try to win, he's going to fail, but that should be expected.  he's easily 2-3 years from being even a competent QB and that's assuming you can completely deprogram his running instinct, completely deprogram his footwork mechanics and teach him how to play in the NFL as well as give him game experience.  So we need to commit to him for three years or upgrade now.  Watching him for 1 year will tell you nothing.   And this is why players like Cameron and Mack want out, because they know this isn't a 1 year fix.  McCown:  I can't even believe this has to be said, but the Bucs expected him to come in last year and play like he did with the bears.  Well, he didn't because he's Josh McCown.  How many times have we seen a QB come in and play well for 4-5 games, now there is enough tape on him and he's completely figured out?  And those are guys with talent.  McCown is beyond journeyman.  So yes, C- sounds fair.  We made safe picks.  We make picks that no one can complain about, that have low bust potential, but they also don't address the biggest gaping holes in our team."
Browns,34p6s5,djroomba322,2,Sun May 3 15:03:13 2015 UTC,"I won't argue much on the QB situation, it's pretty dire. I have hope, but not really any expectation.  The Erving pick though, it's widely documented that he can play anywhere on the line. Hell he was playing LT earlier. Because of this I don't think you can criticize the pick as a ""1st round backup"" because we don't know the intention of it yet. For all we now he was drafted to replace Schwartz or Greco (which is probably the case) and simply provide insurance, while also being a starter mind you, in the off chance Mack does leave. If Mack doesn't? Great now we have a player playing RT/G who is hopefully really good.  Benjamin is off the team with the Johnson pick. He is out. He is awful, he was on this team to return kicks and he couldn't do it. As soon as we got someone who could he is out.   All the other assessments of our receivers are a little on the pessimistic side but not completely off base. I personally believe Gabriel would make other NFL rosters, how many I'm not sure, but he could make some as a #5 or so. Like you said, he plays hard and aggressive, and teams like that sort of thing.  We are completely devoid of pass catching talent at TE though, I will completely give you that. Barnidge/Dray are utility players 100%, Housler miiiiiiight be a pass catching talent but it's highly unlikely.  In regards to Crow/West I was having a talk with my buddy before the draft about why I wouldn't be upset if we had taken Gurley/Gordon in the first at 19. That is pretty much exactly what I said. They are good serviceable backs but they aren't playmakers and difference makers, if we want to be a run heavy offense we need difference makers. However, having 3 solid contributing backs would still be very good (if Johnson can work out).  In the end, everyone will downvote this post for being completely pessimistic but you aren't really wrong on most of your points. I have a couple different opinions on a couple of the players than you and I'm generally optimistic while you are generally pessimistic. But I think people will downvote you for your name and your first sentence.  EDIT: By the way, how do you feel about that last 7th round pick? Do you like taking a risk on a player like that or would you have rather spent that pick on someone else?"
Browns,34p6s5,Daviroth,0,Sun May 3 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"By the way, how do you feel about that last 7th round pick? Do you like taking a risk on a player like that or would you have rather spent that pick on someone else?   Its fine.  Its a 7th round pick, so its really not a risk.  There is no one in the 7th you even typically expect to make the team usually,  its practice squad guys.  If this guy can be healthy, it will be worth it, but if not, its just a 7th rounder.  But it isnt some genius move, and the odds of teh guy working out are extreeeeeeemely low."

All players that looked good or contributed and were taken in later rounds or undrafted.  We still have a LOT of picks left in this draft. I don't understand why people are freaking out. Yes, it's not the sexiest draft so far, but we are filling holes. Making the team better. I'm so positive about the future after this draft. It seems like Haslam has left the staff draft who they want. It seems Farmer has a vision for this team. And it seems like Pettine is serious about building a team that will DOMINATE on defence.

Lane Adkins has been saying for a while that West has been on the coaches' shit list for a while now and he called Cleveland taking a RB like Duke way back in February or so.  At any rate, I guess his attitude sucks and he spends more time talking the talk than he does actually putting the effort in. He's apparently been a giant pain in the ass at practice because he doesn't listen very well. Sounds to me he's having a hard time adjusting from being the big dog at Towson to being at the bottom of the food chain as a rookie. And the Duke pickup is a slight indictment of him, honestly."

Browns,34mwa8,smartfbrankings,1 point,Sun May 3 01:42:44 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, for sure shooting blindly. But seeing as what we have is garbage, there is no reason to not take a chance on a 3rd round guy. If he sucks too, we're no worse off than we were before. If he happens to play well, then fantastic.  I'm tired of sucking and waiting for next year every year. And then we never make the move to pick up the stud. We take people in the second half of the first round who have ""fallen"" in the draft, for incredibly obvious reasons, and disregard the study that we commissioned that told us to draft Bridgewater."
Browns,34mwa8,Ihateloops,1 point,Sun May 3 02:39:02 2015 UTC,"No worse off except for not having that pick on someone else and giving up another pick to move up.  If you think this ship is going to right itself overnight, you are delusional.  There are a lot of holes to plug, and getting desperate won't help.  You keep saying you want to pick up the stud, a 3rd round QB is not a stud.  This was a horrible QB class, so survive a year with McCown giving Johnny a chance to see if he wants to turn it around or even has that ability, then the situation solves itself next year."
Browns,34mwa8,smartfbrankings,1 point,Sun May 3 13:17:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're the one who brought up waiting a year for ""the stud"" and I just said it one time in direct reply to your point.

Browns,34mwa8,battle_squid,1 point,Sun May 3 16:08:14 2015 UTC,"I'd rather take my chances with 12 players than 10 or 11.  You can afford a lot more players and get a lot more benefit on the diamond in the rough, rather than throwing it all at one player who probably won't be that good anyway."

I like our draft so far, but I feel like your draft is far and away the best.   Your draft so far is the type of draft that creates a great foundation to build on. I'm always a sucker for teams that make the offensive and defensive lines a priority.  That's how you build a team. Your defense is on its way to being elite if Orchard and Mingo can become productive pass rushers. I'm interested in seeing how day 3 goes for yall. Congrats. You guys deserve this. Enjoy it."
Browns,34l5mu,BigFatDynamo,14,Sat May 2 08:11:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to come in and share some kind words. Good luck with Gregory.
Browns,34l5mu,tomchaney479,7,Sat May 2 11:51:13 2015 UTC,"Nice comment, but I think fans should hold off on saying that we ""crushed"" a draft until a year or two from now.  Last year, a large majority of fans and media gave the Browns an A, same goes with the Richardson/Weeden draft and the Phil Taylor trade down draft.  It's fine to say that we made some promising picks, but to say that we crushed it or nailed it is silly."
Browns,34l5mu,DaDulas,8,Sat May 2 13:01:05 2015 UTC,This is what we do.  This is the best time of year to be a Browns fan.  My hope is at an all time high.

Browns,34l5mu,kevler9oh,3,Sat May 2 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"Last years draft was a really good draft, I think people forgot what low-risk-high-reward means...  Edit: down vote is a disagree button now I guess."
Browns,34l5mu,largefarva68,1 point,Sat May 2 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Worst thing about this sub is that too many people just down vote what they don't agree with.  I don't agree that last years draft was ""really"" good but that doesn't mean I have to down vote you.  You added to the discussion."
Browns,34l5mu,tomchaney479,-1,Sat May 2 19:17:37 2015 UTC,"Did you seriously just say that the Browns draft last year was ""really good?""  If so, then you are wrong.  When the Ravens took Ogden and Lewis in the first, that was a really good draft.  When the Chargers drafted Tomlinson and Brees in 2001, that was a really good draft.  Another really good draft - when Pittsburgh took Roethlisberger in 04.  Drafting two likely future busts in the first round is not a ""really good draft.""  In fact, it probably is the exact opposite of that.  Despite Bitonio's solid play, he does not outweigh the massive failure of Gilbert/Manziel.  Now if we had taken Watkins/Bridgewater - that might qualify as good."
Browns,34l5mu,kevler9oh,2,Sat May 2 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"Gilbert is the only bad pick I'll give you. Browns needed to try something at quarterback and took a low risk late pick on JM. If he pans out, it's one of the best trades of all time (Richardson for JM), if not, it's not a big deal. Quarterbacks are hard to find, seemingly harder for us, and you'll never know really what you'll get. Jury is still out on Manziel, I'd say he's going to do better this year just based on Joe Thomas' praises.  A good first round doesn't make a draft class great, the total picture does. Bitonio, Crowell, Kirksey, and to some extent West have been pretty solid contributors and outweigh whatever you may think we've lost in Gilbert and JM."
Browns,34l5mu,lordcorbran,3,Sat May 2 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily call Gilbert a bad pick. He's got the ability, his issues were off the field, and he's been being mentored by Haden. He could definitely still work out."
Browns,34l5mu,kevler9oh,2,Sat May 2 18:07:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not even saying he's a bad pick, but people on here are so adamantly against the two of them it's pathetic."
Browns,34l5mu,lordcorbran,1 point,Sat May 2 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"They've looked pretty bad so far, but I feel like there's at least some legitimate reason to be optimistic about both of them turning it around. Now, that's definitely not the kind of thing you want to have to say about guys who were first round picks, but it's too early to write either of them off."
Browns,34l5mu,tomchaney479,-1,Sat May 2 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"Does the Chargers drafting of Ryan Leaf bc of (a) need and (b) he was highly rated make him any less of a bust or make that SD draft any better?  No, Leaf was a failure and the Chargers had a bad draft as a result.  Same for Oden with Portland - the final result was that it was a wasted pick and a bad draft.  You can come up with all of the reasons in the world to justify taking Manziel.  At the end of the day, he is headed towards being a bust, and that's all that matters.  Two bad picks in the first round?  Not a ""really good draft.""  That's ridiculous."
Browns,34l5mu,kevler9oh,1 point,Sat May 2 16:50:03 2015 UTC,"Leaf pick set the franchise back immensely, Manziel pick didn't."
Browns,34l5mu,tomchaney479,0,Sat May 2 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"Both are busts, wastes of first rd picks and set their franchise back (if we took Bridgewater, we wouldn't be looking for a QB now like we are with Manziel).  To your earlier point, last year's draft was not ""really good,"" I'm sorry."

Browns,34l5mu,AlCapooter,15,Sat May 2 13:35:23 2015 UTC,I'm honestly just excited we are sticking to our guns and giving Johnny a chance. It would have been stupid to blow a 1st round on the guy and then get another QB 1st round this year. If he doesn't pan out this year then get a new QB. This just instilled a ton of confidence in me for this FO.  How many of our previous FO guys would have just hit the panic button and drafted a QB looking for one of those immediate fixes rather than trying to build this thing from the ground up.
Browns,34l5mu,themitey1,11,Sat May 2 04:56:27 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I think Duke will be a great offensive weapon.
Browns,34l5mu,VonJaeger,10,Sat May 2 03:06:14 2015 UTC,"We absolutely are. Browns fans are frustrated about not drafting a wide receiver - but that's a completely different point than being frustrated about the players we have drafted. Because, honestly, Farmer's knocking it out of the fucking park with the talent level on the players he has drafted."
Browns,34l5mu,meyer_33_09,16,Sat May 2 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know about ""crushing"" it, but we are definitely having a smart, solid draft. A very refreshing change from past decisions (particularly in the first round)."
Browns,34l5mu,jvpewster,2,Sat May 2 03:11:44 2015 UTC,"It's not really a change in direction though. Last 10 years or so we've always taken both offensive lineman and pass rushers at a higher frequency then most teams, this year the defense was just a glaring need. We'd have faired a lot better last year if every team didn't set season highs against us rushing the ball.  That being said that's a reason people thought we'd target a WR. Its a hole for us and one that's proven hard to fix in FA"

Browns,34l5mu,SnakeLaFleur,10,Sun May 3 13:42:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with with everything you just said. This is a solid draft. I actually think last years draft is going to be just as solid over time. I think Farmer drafts really well. Ultimately, we won't know for sure for a few seasons but I am very happy."
Browns,34l5mu,HawkeyeJosh,4,Sat May 2 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"I like it so far, too. It's not flashy at all (maybe Shelton is kind of a flashy pick, but that's more culture and personality and pistol-whipping a dude with the dude's own gun), but we're fortifying the lines. If Johnny's gonna do his thing, he's going to need this protection, and I'm loving the hell out of our defense -- maybe our line could be as badass as our secondary.   I do hope we pick up a tight end, though. I'm no longer big on WRs -- none really are left -- but a solid TE could help out."
Browns,34l5mu,Chiranthodendron,3,Sat May 2 07:01:56 2015 UTC,"Well I think that's the plan. We showed we could win games last year with a healthy offensive and defensive lines. When both lines fell apart, the season fell apart. As much as TE and WR are a need and good guys are still out there, I'm almost at the point where I say they draft La'El Collins and have a line full of first round talent. I wasn't on that train until now, but getting Collins and Erving on the right side would be nasty good and the team would have all the depth they need.  If they go WR/TE, I'd hope Rashad Green and Blake Bell come to us, but I view a lot of the tight ends remaining as the same at this point. I'd even be fine with pushing TE to later and grabbing Ifo Ekpre-Olamu for a little DB depth."
Browns,34l5mu,sonicmerlin,2,Sat May 2 11:38:09 2015 UTC,Lol nice prediction on Ifo.  We even got him after drafting two TEs.
Browns,34l5mu,shicken684,1 point,Sat May 2 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"Collins has said he won't sign, so that's pretty much a wasted pick."

Browns,34l5mu,flanders427,2,Sat May 2 03:35:18 2015 UTC,Maxx Williams is really the only one worth taking early (Funchess is more of a WR)
Browns,34l5mu,ohheyeverybody,4,Sat May 2 05:45:38 2015 UTC,"Cameron was a fourth round pick.  I don't remember how deep that draft was at TE, but I'm just throwing it out there."

Browns,34l5mu,tenfingersandtoes,5,Sat May 2 03:35:02 2015 UTC,West for a solid second year WR is what I could see happening. A guy that has played in the league but is still raw talent.  Not sure who and am a little drunk so I may be talking out of my ass.

Browns,34l5mu,CBD2032,3,Sat May 2 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"You dont seriously think theyd trade him after they traded for him in the offseason, do you?   No matter how you shake it, someone looks stupid. They gave up a 3rd rounder plus Ellerbe (whom they were supposedly gonna cut). So they are going to want at least a 3rd round talent (current NFL player or draft pick[s]) if it's more than that, the Browns look dumb for not trading for giving up a 3rd in the first place. If it's less, the Dolphins look dumb for giving up a 3rd rounder for lesser value.   No one wants to look dumb (especially after only a month and a half on the roster and only a week-ish of OTAs), which is why Kenny Stills will likely not get traded. At least until the end of preseason when they can see what they have at WR and what he offers to their team specifically."
Browns,34l5mu,tenfingersandtoes,0,Sat May 2 05:09:50 2015 UTC,"I would like that move, he's a young guy that can pull off a big plays. With time he could definitely develop into a solid WR1."

Browns,34l5mu,raw157,2,Sat May 2 04:18:57 2015 UTC,I'm not doubting their picks. I just wish we took WR. I'm glad they didn't over reach for a WR or RB but I wish they would have picked up the former.   I like the draft thus far. They all seem like stand up guys and solid players. It's interesting how Farmer is staying away from anyone with a red flag by his name.
Browns,34l5mu,BalfazarTheWise,4,Sat May 2 08:39:21 2015 UTC,This is one of the best drafts for the Browns in years. If we manage to somehow get a good WR and TE through draft or trades I'll never doubt Farmer again

Browns,34l5mu,bmack083,1 point,Sat May 2 04:52:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's so different from last years draft.  Pretty obvious that Haslam had a huge part to play in the first round last year.  Good news is, it seems like he has learned from it this year.  It's funny listening to Cleveland Browns Daily when they say Farmer had Johnny number 1qb on the board."
Browns,34l5mu,dayflyer55,1 point,Sat May 2 09:03:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold on orchard.  I think if erving can beat out schwartz for RT that pick is a home run, but solid even if he can't.  Shelton is an obvious great pick.  Xavier Cooper is an absolute beast, and this D line is gonna be NASTY.  Duke Johnson is a perfect pick.  I'm just not too sure about orchard.  He's horrendous in coverage. On tape, he just doesn't seem to ""dominate"" the way you want an edge rusher to.  not to mention I think mingo still needs to be given a fair shake under pettine's system.  But other than that, I think it was a damn good draft."
Browns,34l5mu,miked1be,2,Sat May 2 12:24:16 2015 UTC,If Erving can be an improvement over Greco then that would be a big help too.  Schwartz isn't great but he can do his job decently if he's got someone playing well next to him.  Either that or move Schwartz over to guard and Erving to RT.
Browns,34l5mu,lordcorbran,1 point,Sat May 2 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"Mingo will definitely still get his shot. Pettine's system is all about rotating guys in there, they'll be using a lot more than just the starters."
Browns,34l5mu,subhuman1,1 point,Sat May 2 15:08:03 2015 UTC,"Solid B for the first round. We need a pass rush threat as we had nothing after Krueger last year so I don't mind reaching a little for Orchard. He needs time to develop a counter move or two though. Johnson is a PERFECT fit for a zone scheme and I can see him being touted as the best pick in this draft by mid season.  Cooper is a strange pick. We have Taylor, Starks, Shelton, Winn, Hughes and both Bryants...so we're already 7 deep for 3 positions(not counting Kitchen). And he is best in a one gap penetrator role.   TJ Cummings would have made more sense to me.  We're 7-8 deep on the DL....let's get 7 deep on the OL?"
Browns,34l5mu,lordcorbran,1 point,Sat May 2 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"People seem fairly high on that tackle they got from Seattle, so I think there's pretty decent depth on the o-line as is."

Browns,34lxk7,Spartan_55,17,Sat May 2 09:37:15 2015 UTC,"I almost feel like this is a too many cooks in the kitchen type of deal. I mean is sounds great on  paper. The power of the crow, dukes speed and agility, and west somewhere in between. I still get a bad feeling though."
Browns,34lxk7,phinwalsh,3,Sat May 2 11:43:36 2015 UTC,Agreed. At least one of these three are going to want to be a feature back and not down with the idea of splitting time three ways.
Browns,34lxk7,Mind__Is__Blown,4,Sat May 2 11:49:44 2015 UTC,"""Yeah, it's hard to get into rhythm with three guys just because you don't get warm,'' said Crowell, who rushed seven times for 18 yards -- a 2.6-yard average that was best among the backs -- with a long gain of 11.  ""You kind of come to the sideline and kind of get kind of cold. But it's been all right. It's been working so far. We've been winning games. So I don't have a problem with it.""   Wonder how he'll feel about it when we're not winning games this year.   Like Crowell, West attributed his running woes, in part, to the division of labor among the three backs.  Asked if there are enough carries to go around, Crowell smiled and said, ""I'm probably not allowed to say that."""
Browns,34lxk7,djroomba322,4,Sat May 2 12:07:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think we're going for a 3 headed monster type of deal.  I think this is simply to drive competition, and West will end up being the odd one out.  Just like Tate ended up being.  Then again, we're not the only team seemingly having 3 functional RBs on the roster.  We'll see what happens at camp this year!"
Browns,34lxk7,themitey1,-8,Sat May 2 12:28:05 2015 UTC,"So the 3rd round RB is going to replace the 3rd Rnd RB all the while, our best TE is a guy who's been in the league 4 years and has more fumbles than touchdowns?   And our developmental receivers are... wait, we don't have any? And no tall receivers? No one explosive?  Much better to overdraft and cut carries/ replace existing talent than actually fill holes on the roster."
Browns,34lxk7,djroomba322,8,Sat May 2 12:35:10 2015 UTC,"I think Duke has more potential than either RB we currently have.  Our TE situation wasn't going to be necessarily improved any better in the 3rd round compared to in the later rounds.  Basically it was Maxx vs every other TE option, we have 4 more picks to get one.  That goes the same for WR.  We DO have developmental WR's currently on our roster.  And the WR's that were available in the third round aren't much better options than what is left currently.  DGB left early, and the issues with Strong are apparently worse than any of us knew, or else he would have been gone much earlier than he did.  I really like Duke.  We really didn't have a back that can catch, and now we do.  They've gone on record previously of the draft saying they wanted someone who can catch out of the backfield, and now we got pretty much the best option in the draft that can do so.  That's an offensive win.  It's not what you were looking for, but they were.  Tough.  I like Duke better than the other options that were available at the time."
Browns,34lxk7,themitey1,-3,Sat May 2 12:46:55 2015 UTC,"The problem is, we should have addressed this way before the third.  We should have addressed this way before this year.    Here's a list of guys we could have had our pick of last year alone:  Sammy Watkins  Mike Evans  Jarvis Landry  Jordan Matthews  Beckham Jr  Brandin Cooks  Kelvin Benjamin  John Brown  Marquise Lee  Bruce Ellington (who ironically enough was drafted with our pick)  And that's last year alone.  All of those dudes are an upgrade, and many of them are going to be great.   Throw in this year's draft, with players like Parker, and even guys like Agholor.  Guys that can make an impact immediately.    But as far as developmental guys go, who are we developing?  Here are our camp bodies:  Kevin Cone, Rodney Smith, Marlon Moore.  That's it.  Those are project pipe dreams at best and none of them are developing into starting high quality weapons.  Someone like Strong or DGB may not have a great year this year, but they're going to be developed by coaches this year so next year they'll be useful and can be top tier receivers.  We have literally no one in the pipe.  And there isn't anyone left with huge upside.  Or we can draft a 3rd running back who's going to split carries and take carries away from our already average RB corps."
Browns,34lxk7,djroomba322,7,Sat May 2 13:03:34 2015 UTC,"You also forgot Taylor Gabriel, the best of the bunch of newer WRs we have.  Why can't those guys develop into high quality weapons?  Because they aren't drafted high or well known?  That's silly.  Developmental guys aren't supposed to be well known till they develop.  Do I think they will?  I think Gabriel and Smith have the potential to.  I don't think so about the other 2.  And we can't get developmental guys now?  Why not?  The only WRs left pretty much define what a developmental guys are.  DGB and Strong aren't developmental, they are moreso instant impact boom or bust type of players.  And if they didn't like those options, then who the fuck are we to say do it anyways?  And yes, we can draft a 3rd running back who has the potential to be better than any of them, you know, upgrading the position that they have stated again and again will be the most important part of our offense going forward.  Should we have addressed this before the third?  I dunno, it will depend on how the guys we did get pan out.  If all the guys we got are solid instant starters that upgrade their positions, then I disagree.  And they seemingly are from what all the analysts say.  The only think disappointing about our draft to me is that it's not flashy in that it's not what we were thinking they'd take.  But I don't think it's bad at all.  Our team is better.  Just not in the way we imagined it would.  Last year, I feel like we were in the exact same position going into the season.  We all felt like we didn't have any options on the offense, and it wouldn't produce at all.  No star receivers, rookie RBs, no real option at QB, Manziel wasn't ready...etc etc.  Then when we actually played, our offense was surprisingly productive, until our line fell apart and teams figured out Hoyer.  I kind of feel like we're going into a similar situation, except with better RBs, and improved trenches.  Our FO obviously has a plan and they stuck to it, which is better than reaching for guys they aren't high on.  Let's just see what happens.  I feel good about it."
Browns,34lxk7,themitey1,-7,Sat May 2 13:20:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't count Gabriel because he probably won't be on the team next year.  He basically shares the same role as Hawkins on the field.  Last year he got more playing time because we obviously have no weapons at all.  He showed very clearly he is great at exploiting a weak defense and finding space and absolutely positively horrible at making space for himself.  He's too short, and not a great route runner.  The majority of his catches came from play action.    When Gordon comes back, and we fill the roster with a real #2, he maybe stays as a 4th option, but I expect us to move on from him.  The problem is his ceiling is low. He has basically hit it already, and as you can see, to limited success.   And we can't get developmental guys now? Why not? The only WRs left pretty much define what a developmental guys are. DGB and Strong aren't developmental, they are moreso instant impact boom or bust type of players. And if they didn't like those options, then who the fuck are we to say do it anyways?   We can draft pipe dream guys with 2% of panning out sure.  But we're not going to draft anyone who is a good player who we can make into a star.  Someone who will have actual impact on the field.   Last year, I feel like we were in the exact same position going into the season. We all felt like we didn't have any options on the offense, and it wouldn't produce at all. No star receivers, rookie RBs, no real option at QB, Manziel wasn't ready...etc etc. Then when we actually played, our offense was surprisingly productive, until our line fell apart and teams figured out Hoyer.    Hoyer wasn't ""figured out"".  The running game dried up, so we had no play action.  We lived off of play action.  Our receivers were, once again, great at exploiting play action and terrible at making their own windows.  They're not big enough targets, and not able to create their own windows, and not the best hands.  Last year we had a QB who was willing to play in the confines of the offense and not make mistakes.  We don't have that this year.  This year we have a rookie QB who's never played a snap correctly in a new offense with a new OC in a pro style offense, or Josh McCown who has played 5 good games in his entire career.  I even question how bad he was in tampa.  This is weeden level shit. And look.  The game was 10-0.  Carolina won that game 20-14.  There is a reason they went 1-10 with McCown and its not entirely because the team had oline.  Shit like this swings games, gives up field position and makes you play from behind even if you ahve an elite defense.  I wonder how many games they could have won with just an average QB?  Not 10 or anything crazy, but plays like this change the whole dynamic.  And no matter what you think of hoyer, he didn't make the big mistake, he played within the confines of our offense, and let the game stay close.  He played it like Pettine wanted, and didn't do shit like that.    Our FO obviously has a plan and they stuck to it   Just because you have a plan, it doesn't mean its a good one.  And a plan that is pretty much the opposite of every playoff team in the league is a bad one."

In other words, Duke's skill set could be used in a different way, whether it be a third down back, a wing or slot receiver, etc. while Crow/West maintain that ""mostly a rusher"" role.

Wouldn't break my heart to see him picked up with one of our 4ths if he makes it to us   Edit: after a second of actual thought yes I realize that'd mean we literally would have draft a new D-line entirely from PAC-12 and I'm ok with that because I think they'd play off eachother extremely well

Browns,34l6h6,Kavilion,25,Sat May 2 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"WSU alumni here.  Xavier is a beast. His numbers last year weren't too great, our defense was downright pitiful and he was moved positions a few times out of necessity (defensive coordinator was fired at the end of the year).  If you want to see the real deal, take a look at his 2013 season.  Obviously i'm bias, but you guys got a great pick. Some analysts had him as high as mid-2nd round. Also our D-line coach Joe Salavea is one of the best in the business.  With Shelton, Orchard and Cooper all coming up...watch out. That will be a stout line."

Browns,34l6h6,Nightcinder,19,Sat May 2 03:30:35 2015 UTC,I'm ok with this. Shelton isn't going to fix our run d all by himself.
Browns,34l6h6,jg87iroc,15,Sat May 2 03:14:04 2015 UTC,Another underrated component to fixing the run d is to not have the offense go 3 and out and run a tired defense out there constantly while the other team is ahead and playing ball control offense.
Browns,34l6h6,Ihateloops,6,Sat May 2 04:30:08 2015 UTC,THANK YOU. Our defense was paper at times last year but part of that was our own inability to stay on the field.
Browns,34l6h6,jvpewster,1 point,Sat May 2 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"True, but it's pretty hard to argue that the D carried its weight this season.  We made a stud out of almost every RB we faced.  Plus, a D that prevents the opponent from playing ball control offense (because they stuff the running game it depends on) flips the script and forces 3 and outs to make the other defense tired."

Browns,34l6h6,740Buckeye,4,Sat May 2 04:39:30 2015 UTC,"What worries me about Gilbert are these reports of multiple people inside the organization saying he has the worst attitude of any player they've ever seen.  I like Haden's been trying to straighten him out, but at this point I'll take it as a pleasant surprise if he plays up to the #8 pick."
Browns,34l6h6,surlysci,5,Sat May 2 05:20:58 2015 UTC,"Source? I've heard that his attitude is an issue, but I've never heard anyone calling it the ""worst"".   This is in the same league with guys like Randy Moss, Kenny Britt, James Harrison and Peyton Hillis."
Browns,34l6h6,740Buckeye,4,Sat May 2 05:24:20 2015 UTC,"I thought it was new, but it turns out it was rehashing old news (and from MKC, so...ya), but I guess I missed it the first time:   Gilbert's benching in Baltimore follows a season-long series of transgressions in which he was frequently late for meetings and displayed one of the worst attitudes some in the organization have ever seen.   link"
Browns,34l6h6,surlysci,0,Sat May 2 06:39:41 2015 UTC,"Disagree.   Joe Thomas also said Manziel was ""Night and Day"". Still won't believe it till it translate to the field."
Browns,34l6h6,Stowcenter93,3,Sat May 2 04:44:18 2015 UTC,He also has a whitner/Haden  3 feet up his ass so I have more faith in Gilbert.
Browns,34l6h6,Deadleggg,2,Sat May 2 06:24:51 2015 UTC,"He is probably just an average kid who got a shit load of money and fame.  That and when you are as athletic as Gilbert, where you've been playing down in skill level against the competition, you just don't understand the professional preparation it takes to match up against these guys."

Browns,34l6h6,WaffylesYay,1 point,Sat May 2 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"The point of trades like that the team trading up suspects a guy they want will be gone by the time they pick.  I don't really know how much teams know about other teams' plans, but that certainly seems to be at least part of it (i.e. X team likes this guy and they pick before us).  If you really like a guy and can get him for a reasonable price (shuffling picks on day 3 doesn't matter that much, because that's when teams' draft boards diverge from ""consensus"" rankings), you go for it.  My take is that guys up through the third round are expected to make the team and likely get significant PT in their rookie seasons.  Guys in rounds 4-7 are more of a crapshoot/development projects.  We gave up #147 to go from 111 -> 96, basically.  Swapping 7th rounders is pretty much meaningless."
Browns,34l6h6,zeek0us,-1,Sat May 2 23:16:27 2015 UTC,"4 out of 5 I think we did well. I don't like Orchard at all but I'm okay with this.  Would have preferred another Oline man if they were thinking trenches, and I really want a damn WR but whatever. DT is another safe pick."
Browns,34l6h6,Stowcenter93,5,Sat May 2 03:16:19 2015 UTC,Why don't you like Orchard?
Browns,34l6h6,BMC4,8,Sat May 2 03:20:32 2015 UTC,"Am I allowed to say without getting downvoted?  Well to me, he is Sheard's replacement. But Sheard was straight run defense while everything I have watched about Orchard shows poor run defense and containment.   His strong point is pass rush but he is very one dimensional and can't cover any sort of pass.   He remind of Mingo, which is not a good thing to me. Now, he has better stats than Mingo did his junior year , but Mingo also played in the SEC so his carried a bit more weight.  When we drafted Mingo, we had the exact same reaction as we are having now and I just don't see it working out."
Browns,34l6h6,Stowcenter93,4,Sat May 2 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Well, I get the impression Orchard has better football instincts, but that doesn't mean much. Let's hope he's coachable. And if he turns out to be the most disruptive pass rusher on the team, then it's probably still a win of a pick."
Browns,34l6h6,kilo20,6,Sat May 2 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"Oh if that's the case then A+ on the pick!   I'm not counting him out, and he is DEFINITELY coachable. Everything I read said how he's a good person and was the captain of the team. He is a very coachable and good guy.  I guess I just feel like I've been on this road before and don't like where it takes me, especially since I knew all the other options."
Browns,34l6h6,Stowcenter93,3,Sat May 2 03:43:44 2015 UTC,PFF has him 5th in P5 conference run stops https://twitter.com/PFF/status/594301623469486080?s=09
Browns,34l6h6,SaigonOSU,2,Sat May 2 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"Here, I'll quote the response to that from bleacher report cause they said it best.   According to Pro Football Focus, he made 22 run stops a season ago against Power-5 competition. However, it's worth noting that Orchard's tendency to attack the backfield on every play lent itself to these big plays, but also drew him out of position frequently.   When your strength is attacking and rushing the backfield all the time, those numbers better be high.  Edit: also this   When Orchard didn't get into the backfield, he was often a non-factor against the run, taking poor angles to the ball carrier and showing limited reaction skills."
Browns,34l6h6,Stowcenter93,1 point,Sat May 2 04:18:01 2015 UTC,"We'll see. If he can rush the passer, it won't matter, but hopefully Pettine can correct those flaws"
Browns,34l6h6,SaigonOSU,2,Sat May 2 04:25:22 2015 UTC,I just hope he doesn't become a Mingo. And I felt like other positions could have been taken. But I digress.
Browns,34l6h6,Stowcenter93,4,Sat May 2 04:28:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of PFF, and they rate Mingo better than most people's perception. Played through injury last year, and has really improved in the run game, doing things that don't show up in stats.   Also, we drafted him in one of the weakest draft classes in recent memory, so it's not like we took a flyer on him"
Browns,34l6h6,SaigonOSU,3,Sat May 2 04:37:55 2015 UTC,"That draft was weak, and he's not a bust, but his impact on the team to me has been underwhelming."
Browns,34l6h6,Stowcenter93,3,Sat May 2 04:49:56 2015 UTC,"That's fair, hopefully being healthy and improvements to the line will help his production"

Browns,34l6h6,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Sat May 2 04:07:37 2015 UTC,Mingo is stout against the run which was the knock on him. He also can't find the QB.
Browns,34l6h6,Deadleggg,1 point,Sat May 2 06:26:25 2015 UTC,"Wait, what?  Sheard was straight run defense since when?  IIRC, we drafted him as a pass rusher (he was a rush DE at Pitt, no?), but maybe my memory is off.  Anyway, Orchard led the NCAA in sacks, so even if he's not a great run defender, he'll be filling the need at 3-4 OLB.  Were any of the OLBs that made the Ravens/Steelers' defenses so dominant all those years ever picked for their run-stopping ability?  Plus, Orchard is a former WR, so I'd be surprised if he was a complete disaster in pass coverage on the occasions when that's his job."

Browns,34kxzk,nofxsnap,16,Sat May 2 02:06:28 2015 UTC,I'm still giving Gilbert the benefit of the doubt. Corner is one of the hardest positions to play in the NFL. Some people can't adapt to the different play speed as quickly as others.
Browns,34kxzk,aggroCrag32,6,Sat May 2 02:56:33 2015 UTC,"Add to that, Pettine scheme requires the guys to be in press a lot and on an island.  He expects a lot from the CBs and rightfully so.  That just makes it that much  more difficult for Gilbert notwithstanding the maturity issues."
Browns,34kxzk,sil0,14,Sat May 2 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"Which still has potential to work out. 50% realistically, but Johnny could have really changed in rehab, and if he puts forth the effort, he has the physical tools to succeed."
Browns,34kxzk,Doyle524,8,Sat May 2 02:12:07 2015 UTC,Manziel was a risk. I think Gilbert will be able to perform at high level though.

I've been babbling about him for months.  His athleticism is through the roof. Seriously, he's like a Jordan Cameron clone. Arians just doesn't have much use for TEs downfield. I think he's got a chance to be an impact player in this offense."
Browns,34kxzk,TapedeckNinja,3,Sat May 2 02:10:43 2015 UTC,"He is as bad at blocking as Jordan Cameron. I think he is better than people give him credit for and he is athletic, but he is a very poor blocker too. I'd love to pull a trade off for Bennett since Chicago is shopping."
Browns,34kxzk,bearsdriving,2,Sat May 2 02:53:29 2015 UTC,Yep. He really is like a poor man's Jordan Cameron.  It would not surprise me if he has a breakout year. It would also not surprise me if he doesn't make the final roster.
Browns,34kxzk,TapedeckNinja,1 point,Sat May 2 14:55:51 2015 UTC,Bennett is like 29
Browns,34kxzk,BMC4,3,Sat May 2 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"Jimmy Graham is 28. If you can ball, you can ball."
Browns,34kxzk,osufan765,1 point,Sat May 2 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"TE is a weird position, generally it takes 2-3 years to be serviceable in the NFL. Bennett is going into his age 28 season, the age of decline of a TE starts at 30 with 29 as the peak age, and he is under contract for 2 years. It would be a good decision to get a good TE in blocking and catching in the expected prime of his career."
Browns,34kxzk,bearsdriving,2,Sat May 2 15:46:09 2015 UTC,He is clutch in Madden so I'm game for Housler
Browns,34kxzk,Cavs032,2,Sat May 2 04:56:47 2015 UTC,"He hasn't done much so far. I think we've had a good draft, but our TE situation is probably the worst in the NFL."

Like I said, I accept that people laugh at me for hyping Housler. He's just someone I've watched for a while and the guy I had pegged as our target if Cameron left back at the end of the season."
Browns,34kxzk,TapedeckNinja,-2,Sat May 2 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"Oh tagged so hard.  This is hilarious.  Cardinals fans threw a fucking parade in their sub when he was gone.  Their nickname for him was ""Rob ""Brick Hands and Spray Tans"" Housler""  ""He's a big, athletic guy who can't catch, block or run routes very well. If that sounds like the missing piece for Atlanta, more power to them.""  Yeah that screams impact player."
Browns,34kxzk,djroomba322,6,Sat May 2 13:21:19 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we have 3 TE's. Maybe not one that meets your Offensive standards, but we very much have a TE."
Browns,34kxzk,Troop-the-Loop,3,Sat May 2 02:07:05 2015 UTC,Williams had a lot of red flags in meetings with teams supposedly. I'd rather have less J.Gordon/Gilbert/Devone Bess types that need to be coddled or that you have to worry about not giving 100%
Browns,34kxzk,ErroneousOnAllCounts,1 point,Sat May 2 02:32:10 2015 UTC,We didn't really have a TE last year either. Cameron played 3 games.
Browns,34kxzk,Chiranthodendron,7,Sat May 2 11:53:18 2015 UTC,NINE teams picked a WR in front of him. NINE. That should say something.
Browns,34kxzk,draino3112,5,Sat May 2 02:52:47 2015 UTC,"I trust Ray, but with all of the WR talent last year and this year, I would've liked to use one pick to grab a stud receiver that could really help our QB, as opposed to relying on average/below average guys. Defense is shaping up REALLY nicely, though."
Browns,34kxzk,meyer_33_09,18,Sat May 2 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"I don't recall a single game last year when I thought ""Man, if only we had another good receiver, we could win this game."" I did recall several where I thought ""It sure would be nice if the other team wasn't able to run the ball at will against us."" Count me on board the mediocre receivers bandwagon."
Browns,34kxzk,ArcaneNine,3,Sat May 2 04:13:49 2015 UTC,"I did have that thought when Gordon was dropping balls against the Colts, but I had a tom of other thoughts too, like ""Why is Hoyer playing so poorly? Why is our best receiver struggling so badly with routine catches? Why did the team fall apart with one offensive line injury? Why couldn't our run D stop that 4th down TD against a pretty poor OL?"""

The two best WR drafts in decades, and we have like 6+ picks in the first two rounds and we can't get a single player?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Danny Shelton wants to play here because he's a lineman and and his paycheck doesnt count on a dude throwing the ball to him.  Parker does.   Strongs not my boy.  The Browns are my boy.  We need weapons.  We need impact players.  I'm watching our division rivals go out and take impact players.  Newsome, who is a GOOD GM who has shown time and again, that you need those impact guys and what did he do? Went out and got the best pass catching TE in the draft. And we're collecting 6th round draft picks and a guy who's been in the league 4 years with 1 TD.  Great."

Browns,34kuo5,topper_mango,2,Sat May 2 11:58:25 2015 UTC,"Time and time again?  They went more than a decade without a franchise qb, and before yesterday hadn't drafted an offensive playmaker in the first three rounds of any draft in years.

Browns,34kuo5,Beezer12WashingBird,5,Sat May 2 01:52:41 2015 UTC,No no. Ray farmer will never be as good as (fill in any possible person that has ever been considered for any GM I'm any professional or semi-professional sports team).

He even struggled to get some of these college players down. Ok now the positives. He finds the ball and has great instincts. When he does get lower and tackle he wraps up. He seems to be a good pass rushing outside line backer. I don't know if he will start but it seems like a good pickup. He also was the captain, I noticed the C on his Jersey, and was out there pumping up the team. We need leaders. We need guys excited to play football. Browns are slowly building a team of hard working, football loving players. I predict good things."

Browns,34ldyf,phinwalsh,2,Sat May 2 04:48:43 2015 UTC,and who would they be?
Browns,34ldyf,battle_squid,2,Sat May 2 11:45:53 2015 UTC,Hawkins and Gabriel
Browns,34ldyf,phinwalsh,2,Sat May 2 12:20:15 2015 UTC,thanks man
Browns,34ldyf,stefantababy,4,Sat May 2 12:41:08 2015 UTC,Honestly looking at this list it might just be better to try to pick up one of these guys as an undrafted free agent and use the picks elsewhere
Browns,34ldyf,themitey1,5,Sat May 2 04:53:31 2015 UTC,"Just going off this list, these are the ones I want in this order:   Tre McBride Darren Waller Austin Hill Titus Davis   Basically, I'm looking for tall, physical receivers that can catch the ball.  We have enough small fast route running guys that are good, so we need something different.  That's the criteria I'm looking for."
Browns,34ldyf,Marzman315,3,Sat May 2 04:44:33 2015 UTC,I like Mayle a lot. Perfect fit since we don't desperately need a day one contributer. I've also heard good things about Smelter  Edit: Wooo!
Browns,34ldyf,1nurseman,2,Sat May 2 05:40:57 2015 UTC,I will take anyone that doesn't have stones for hands and can run a decent 40.
Browns,34ldyf,MercilessMizzou,2,Sat May 2 04:45:16 2015 UTC,"Give me a Justin hardy, Rashad Greene or maybe Waller."
Browns,34ldyf,giannini1222,2,Sat May 2 04:45:32 2015 UTC,Grossi said McBride is most likely the pick
Browns,34ldyf,inferno167,2,Sat May 2 04:50:39 2015 UTC,Tre McBride or bust! Kid is gonna be a stud in the pros.
Browns,34ldyf,chris101010,1 point,Sat May 2 04:52:06 2015 UTC,Lippet is going to be the steal of the draft.
Browns,34ldyf,VonJaeger,1 point,Sat May 2 07:43:05 2015 UTC,"Where is Kenny Bell? He may be the second or third best amongst these guys.  Edit: I'd like these guys in this order: DeAndre Smelter, Tre McBride, Kenny Bell, Titus Davis, Darren Waller, Vince Mayle, Stefon Diggs, Tony Lippett. If we cannot get one of those guys, I'd prefer to just go after a tight end or say to hell with it, pick up some WRs as UDFAs, and just draft other guys at other positions."
Browns,34ldyf,d-a-f-f-y,1 point,Sat May 2 07:43:26 2015 UTC,My dog's name is Titus. So I hope we pick that guy.
Browns,34ldyf,topper_mango,1 point,Sat May 2 08:44:45 2015 UTC,No Ty Montgomery?  I want Ty Montgomery...
Browns,34ldyf,jrich612,1 point,Sat May 2 09:57:03 2015 UTC,I would love Diggs and McBride back to back in the fourth. McBride can definitely play outside and if Diggs can't he could be an incredible slot guy. Both are super athletic.
Browns,34ldyf,BigFatDynamo,1 point,Sat May 2 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"Alright bro, why didn't I get an email with these writeups before the draft?   Funny and useful, thank you for taking the time to write these up.  Next year, I expect a draft magazine."
Browns,34ldyf,RedChocobo2,1 point,Sat May 2 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"your analysis of crowder is good except for saying that his is bad after the catch. he is AMAZING after the catch in terms of shiftyness, don't know where that comes from. he doesn't break tackles incredibly well due to his small size, but thats only if you can get your hands on him!"
Browns,34ldyf,playgroundlegend89,1 point,Sat May 2 18:06:24 2015 UTC,Its all about Diggs.. Diggs is Farmers only Redemption
Browns,34ldyf,740Buckeye,1 point,Sat May 2 06:02:39 2015 UTC,Diggs ain't the type of guy that'll last with our schedule this year.   He'll get ragdolled by some of the secondaries we play.
Browns,34ldyf,Chiranthodendron,0,Sat May 2 07:28:14 2015 UTC,"Gimme Rashad Green, Blake Bell, and Ifo Ekpre-Olamu and I'll be a happy guy tomorrow.  We need more cool names so I can name my kitten after someone. Barkevious Mingo is meeting fierce opposition. Ifo might be the next best bet.  Edit: I should also mention that I really would love to see the team sign Kasen Williams as an UDFA, he had a mother sophomore campaign before an injury derailed his junior year. His senior year had a different coach and he fell off, but after watching his sophomore games I think he could be a decent player if used properly. He was a great blocker, never afraid to go across the middle, and burned guys deep if the scattershot QB hit him."
Browns,34krkf,_MitchPlease,18,Sat May 2 00:36:14 2015 UTC,Ray Farmer said this is the guy he wanted in the second yesterday. We picked up an extra fourth and upgraded our seventh to a sixth. Phenomenal work!

Browns,34krkf,SuperPoop,3,Sat May 2 00:45:14 2015 UTC,"Guy put up numbers. NFLN compared him to Ryan Kerrigan, and if we get the production from him that Washington gets from Kerrigan, this is a great pick."

Browns,34krkf,Acm0028,13,Sat May 2 00:47:03 2015 UTC,I'd much rather have a solid LB than a risky WR.
Browns,34krkf,Deadleggg,-6,Sat May 2 01:04:19 2015 UTC,I'd rather have an offensive playmaker which we don't really have. Seems our gm and coach are fine with the defense being on the field the whole game so we gotta build depth for that. We need to be able to get some guys who can score. Would've rather had Maxx but we let the Ravens get him. Smh
Browns,34krkf,Rizzlerick,3,Sat May 2 01:20:50 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone sees these WRs as offensive play makers since from our original pick on none of them have been picked.  Just because we lack WRS doesn't mean you reach for one who you don't see as a 2nd round talent.
Browns,34krkf,djroomba322,-5,Sat May 2 01:31:57 2015 UTC,I'm fucking pissed we need a receiver more.

Browns,34kbkh,TheFranchise36,1 point,Sat May 2 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, first post in the party here. This draft couldn't be better. Teams are going to have problems stopping our run game. Fresh legs in the game at RB all game long. Duke hits the line of scrimmage so hard, he's so fast, I love it. Our offensive line is going to be phenomenal. Didn't we sign the lineman off Seattle's practice squad? He was supposed to be really solid, just hurt at the time. We may have two new starters on that right side.  Our front seven on defense just had a huge upgrade, our d line will be fresh all game as well. Our defense will be feared. Our run defense has gotten mich better, look out we may be top notch now.  Why are people begging for a WR? We signed two in FA. Bowe is the deep threat, hardline is super versatile and Hawkins will be able to go back to the slot, where he thrives. Gabriel is our 4th and a deep threat, looks good to me.  We're going to see significant improvements this year. I'd like a big and fast TE, but this class doesn't have many. Housler may be good enough, hasn't been in an offense that really values receiving TEs yet.  GO BROWNS"
Browns,34kbkh,kuhlmader1,2,Sat May 2 14:51:25 2015 UTC,I am beyond thrilled with this draft so far... no QB taken and we're improving the run defense.

Browns,34kbkh,inferno167,3,Sat May 2 03:27:45 2015 UTC,Cooper looks like a perfect 3-4 DE and should be able to complement Shelton nicely

Browns,34kbkh,FL14,3,Sat May 2 03:30:30 2015 UTC,One will be a situational guy (Coop) and spell someone is what I was thinking.  Rubin is in Seattle.
Browns,34kbkh,sil0,4,Sat May 2 03:36:48 2015 UTC,Rubin was signed by the Seahawks months ago.
Browns,34kbkh,SmokeySmokes,7,Sat May 2 03:35:37 2015 UTC,"Well they wanted to address the run defense, mission accomplished! I feel like they didn't get the WR they wanted so they decided to address other needs and it seems like we will be a run heavy team next year."
Browns,34kbkh,oustudent,2,Sat May 2 03:20:56 2015 UTC,I feel like they probably wouldn't have drafted a receiver no matter what.
Browns,34kbkh,Fred_Zeppelin,2,Sat May 2 03:54:11 2015 UTC,I'm ok with that. Control the tempo and keep the pressure off your defense.

Browns,34kbkh,moodyfloyd,2,Sat May 2 03:05:20 2015 UTC,Bengals got a good solid TE.  I thought they were well covered at TE.
Browns,34kbkh,sil0,2,Sat May 2 02:45:54 2015 UTC,I don't know if we can say anything. We drafted another RB
Browns,34kbkh,Fred_Zeppelin,1 point,Sat May 2 02:49:06 2015 UTC,"For sure, but not a diss.  I like the guy and think he'll be a solid player.  I figured they would look at other areas and maybe go TE 6-7."
Browns,34kbkh,brownsfan760,1 point,Sat May 2 02:54:21 2015 UTC,Jermaine Gresham is probably on his way out and Tyler Eifert has been inconsistent

Browns,34kbkh,Execrat0r,2,Sat May 2 03:07:22 2015 UTC,Does anyone think that we will trade back into the round?
Browns,34kbkh,SmokeySmokes,2,Sat May 2 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"they could use a 4th, 5th and 6th to move in leaving two back to back 4ths and two 6ths t move to the last spot in the third"

Browns,34kbkh,SmokeySmokes,5,Sat May 2 02:44:44 2015 UTC,I think Duke is a good pick because the Browns don't really have another scatback who has speed and can help in the passing game
Browns,34kbkh,sunkingishere,4,Sat May 2 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"Per Daryl Ruiter.  Makes even more sense.  ""1 cut kind of guy, see a hole hit it"" - Johnson on what type of runner he is #Browns"

Browns,34kbkh,Fred_Zeppelin,5,Sat May 2 02:43:46 2015 UTC,Are we seriously going to end up with 11 rookies?
Browns,34kbkh,GeorgeHermanBluth,4,Sat May 2 02:40:36 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of a poor man's MJD. Okay I can get on board with this pick, he seems to be a good kick returner, nice vision, excellent excelleration, a little tiny, probably is injury prone but if he stays healthy he could be our own little Darren Sprolls"
Browns,34kbkh,rsipp512,7,Sat May 2 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"I smell a WFNY article on Monday about the fanbase's fascination with drafting a receiver when we already have Hartline, Bowe, and Hawkins."

Browns,34kbkh,moodyfloyd,4,Sat May 2 02:53:04 2015 UTC,"I'll grow to like all our picks over the weekend.  I really don't have a problem with any of them, but did think we had a rather obvious need at WR, but without a legit QB, that is devalued.  I'm glad we built in the trenches and gave the RB group a little more reason to be consistent."

Browns,34kbkh,Vayporub,2,Sat May 2 02:41:03 2015 UTC,I dig it. 1:10
Browns,34kbkh,Execrat0r,9,Sat May 2 02:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a Miami U homer so I'm super pumped. Duke is very very versatile. He can return kicks, catch passes, run between the tackles and can get to the outside. He's also pretty dang hard to bring down.  Don't agree with Mel, Miami ran him into the ground every game and he did pretty well durability wise, his usage rate was insane. He does have pretty bad ball security issues, that's definitely the worst thing about him. He fumbled in some very key spots the past few years so I really hope he can get better with that issue.   I hope we can find some room for him to be used on our team. I think he can definitely succeed."
Browns,34kbkh,WeaponEquis,2,Sat May 2 02:34:41 2015 UTC,I would love for us to trade back into the 3rd
Browns,34kbkh,jswolfie316,3,Sat May 2 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"based on the value chart, it would take us two fourths, a fifth and a sixth, to move up to the current pick"
Browns,34kbkh,Fred_Zeppelin,2,Sat May 2 02:35:32 2015 UTC,Uhhhh nevermind
Browns,34kbkh,jswolfie316,2,Sat May 2 02:38:30 2015 UTC,"i should add, leaving us with one 4th and 2 6th rounders i think they have some plans for that 4th round though."
Browns,34kbkh,GeorgeHermanBluth,2,Sat May 2 02:41:54 2015 UTC,The Browns have now made 21 draft picks without drafting a WR. The last WR chosen was Travis Fucking Benjamin in the 4th Fucking Round of the 2012 Fucking NFL Fucking Draft.

Browns,34kbkh,Execrat0r,6,Sat May 2 02:35:27 2015 UTC,I like this pick because Duke Johnson is great  I hate this pick because I love TWest and Crow
Browns,34kbkh,WeaponEquis,2,Sat May 2 02:32:42 2015 UTC,"I think all 3 can contribute. West and Crow are good ball carriers, but they aren't good at pass pro or receiving. Duke adds a weapon on passing downs."
Browns,34kbkh,Chanman_614,3,Sat May 2 02:35:25 2015 UTC,"True. I hope he can play similar role to Bernard, while Crow and TWest are Hill"

Browns,34kbkh,revamp11,4,Sat May 2 02:30:51 2015 UTC,I see very little Browns flair in there. I accept that as a compliment.
Browns,34kbkh,Execrat0r,5,Sat May 2 02:34:22 2015 UTC,"We are. We are winning this draft. You want interior guys early. We have selected so many ""NFL-ready"" wide receivers in the 2nd round all busts. KC screwed us over but there is not much we can do about that."
Browns,34kbkh,GoodLordBatman,2,Sat May 2 02:32:55 2015 UTC,That's a first...I was expecting lolbrowns.
Browns,34kbkh,GoodLordBatman,2,Sat May 2 02:31:21 2015 UTC,"Really really REALLY like this pick, although we need FUCKING RECEIVERS. How hard is it to just look at WR's for one goddamn motherfucking round?"
Browns,34kbkh,moodyfloyd,2,Sat May 2 02:30:43 2015 UTC,"As LT said a few minutes ago, Duke Johnson is similar to Gio Bernard. Duke is going to be a steal if he can match Gio's production."
Browns,34kbkh,ElectricEntity,6,Sat May 2 02:29:58 2015 UTC,We brought in Duke and Evring....Go Cavs.
Browns,34kbkh,Krayfish,1 point,Sat May 2 02:29:56 2015 UTC,We didn't have a legit 3rd down back on the roster. Now we do.

Browns,34kbkh,Chilr0y,3,Sat May 2 02:28:30 2015 UTC,Maybe we now have someone who can both catch and return punts?
Browns,34kbkh,sil0,2,Sat May 2 02:28:24 2015 UTC,Why the fuck did we just draft a RB?
Browns,34kbkh,sil0,8,Sat May 2 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"Only have two on the roster, both sophomores, Johnson is good value there and is great on special teams... Solid pick."
Browns,34kbkh,sil0,4,Sat May 2 02:28:59 2015 UTC,I don't think they're sold on west.
Browns,34kbkh,SpartaWillBurn,3,Sat May 2 02:28:34 2015 UTC,He's pretty. I like it.
Browns,34kbkh,God_HatesFigs,2,Sat May 2 02:27:56 2015 UTC,SERIOUSLY WITH THE COMMERCIALS  i feel like this horse is rotting but WTF
Browns,34kbkh,buttstufff,2,Sat May 2 02:27:53 2015 UTC,Come on!  Why can't we just draft a wide receiver?
Browns,34kbkh,rufus418,3,Sat May 2 02:27:38 2015 UTC,Well... maybe he will take back punts? We all know we need some consistency in that area. Sounds like he has good production in terms of yards.
Browns,34kbkh,average_white_male,3,Sat May 2 02:27:33 2015 UTC,He can return punts. I like him already.
Browns,34kbkh,sunkingishere,3,Sat May 2 02:27:19 2015 UTC,"Change of pace RB I guess. I didn't see this as a need, but what do I know."
Browns,34kbkh,GoodLordBatman,3,Sat May 2 02:27:13 2015 UTC,Just saying LT said he really likes this pick.
Browns,34kbkh,sunkingishere,2,Sat May 2 02:27:08 2015 UTC,Lt has said he likes every single running back.
Browns,34kbkh,PabstyLoudmouth,1 point,Sat May 2 02:30:22 2015 UTC,Lel I was going to respond with this and steal your thunder.
Browns,34kbkh,bowhunter6274,2,Sat May 2 02:49:27 2015 UTC,Told yall.     Just think of the most obscure guy in the draft that might be decent and that's who we're picking.
Browns,34kbkh,themitey1,2,Sat May 2 02:26:55 2015 UTC,Duke Johnson was considered by many to be a top 5 RB in the draft if not top 3.
Browns,34kbkh,sil0,2,Sat May 2 02:29:53 2015 UTC,"Meh.  He is obscure to the folks that dont follow college football regularly.  I don't hate the pick, I just thought we had need elsewhere.  We probably do, but Farmer and team don't value any guys that high.  I had him at #8 on my list."
Browns,34kbkh,GoodLordBatman,2,Sat May 2 02:34:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think the need at receiver is as desperate as some people said. Lots of solid, if not spectacular options. No need to reach or pick one for the sake of picking one. Do really hope they take a TE though."
Browns,34kbkh,themitey1,2,Sat May 2 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"No need to reach, but a definite need.  Our WR corps is slippery as fuck."
Browns,34kbkh,average_white_male,6,Sat May 2 02:39:27 2015 UTC,Don't worry about the WR position.
Browns,34kbkh,sil0,2,Sat May 2 02:26:46 2015 UTC,So who's getting put out there for trade bait?
Browns,34kbkh,GeorgeHermanBluth,2,Sat May 2 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"Respectfully disagree. With the Erving pick and now Johnson, it's pretty clear we're gonna run the shit out of the ball. At some point throughout the year, it's likely one will get banged up for a couple games. This ensures that no matter what, we've got at least a two-headed monster."

Browns,34knvv,nofxsnap,4,Sat May 2 00:11:50 2015 UTC,He has a point about teams like Seattle and New England that are as good as they get without a top flight WR.
Browns,34knvv,carrotsandbears,5,Sat May 2 00:18:59 2015 UTC,Because they have top flight QBs
Browns,34knvv,Pthompson1187,7,Sat May 2 00:32:59 2015 UTC,To the point where it's so obvious. I mean cmon we need a playmaker at WR. Idk they obviously know more than me maybe they wanted Devin smith an when he got picked up they decided to trade down
Browns,34knvv,Carpetron,4,Sat May 2 00:09:47 2015 UTC,I think that's exactly how that went down once Smith went off the board they were listening to offers.
Browns,34knvv,carrotsandbears,8,Sat May 2 00:27:44 2015 UTC,Ammo to trade up in the next round? I thought we had enough picks
Browns,34knvv,oofficial,3,Sat May 2 00:04:21 2015 UTC,At first I was pissed. Now I like. Maybe could turn that 6 and 4 rounder into a 3 who knows. Effectively turn that 7 into a 3

Browns,34knvv,Pinguinos3,13,Sat May 2 04:05:15 2015 UTC,But Jaelen Strong was falling to us :(
Browns,34knvv,ChairyCweed,12,Sat May 2 00:02:55 2015 UTC,They probably know more than we do. And that is a pretty good trade.
Browns,34knvv,cmhdave73,4,Sat May 2 00:04:27 2015 UTC,I think that's a great trade.  I was hoping for a WR at 43 and really liked Jaelen Strong there but I'll be damn if I pass up that trade.
Browns,34knvv,bearsdriving,3,Sat May 2 00:09:42 2015 UTC,Farmer said people keep asking about WRs but he doesn't understand why because he can't think of when his WRs ever let him down and he already addressed that need in FA. They repeat that quote every few minutes on ESPN850.  Ugh.
Browns,34knvv,sgSaysR,1 point,Sat May 2 02:50:18 2015 UTC,I agree.  I can't understand what they dont see in Jaelen.  Maybe they think we can get him later.  I have no clue

Browns,34knvv,Putuinurplace,1 point,Sat May 2 00:06:40 2015 UTC,Good value but what do we need those for? A lot of the time sixth round picks are that impactful unless you get lucky and now we have three of them. I hope we are targeting some trade ups or trades for nfl players.
Browns,34lok1,theduke282,7,Sat May 2 07:01:41 2015 UTC,"WR: We have invested in this position via free agency, and everyone seems to have forgotten about it. Everyone was pleased with Hawkins and Austin last year to some degree, but bringing in two more veterans doesn't seem to matter to anyone. If I'm trying to build an offense with a young quarterback who's had some issues, I would rather use veteran, established leaders to do it.  Basically the same people who complain we don't draft receivers are the same people who complain we don't have a QB to throw to said receivers, and then don't understand how those two things are related.  TE: I think there are quite a few that grade out as 4-5 rounders. As I thought Heuerman and Kroft were two of those, though, we would be wise to not wait too long into the fourth. Of course, it all depends on whether or not our guy is there at the slot we want."
Browns,34lok1,droidworkerbee,2,Sat May 2 11:01:08 2015 UTC,"I liked Austin a lot last year. I also liked dray and barnidge. Our passing game won't be flashy but that doesn't mean it can't be effective. We don't have any athletic freaks but the group of WRs, RBs, and TEs have a versatile skill set between themselves. If manziel proves himself as a competent qb then there will be time to invest in more receivers who complement his ability."
Browns,34lok1,OrnetteOrnette,1 point,Sat May 2 14:29:01 2015 UTC,I very well know our talent level at QB is questionable.  Just hoping we give whoever the starter is the tools to go out and have a shot.
Browns,34lok1,firerex,1 point,Sat May 2 14:19:47 2015 UTC,"I think making defenses have to account for a solid run game opens them up a lot. See Hoyer, Brian last year. Run game goes and he collapses."
Browns,34lok1,MHanky,1 point,Sat May 2 15:22:51 2015 UTC,Austin is gone.
Browns,34lok1,droidworkerbee,7,Sat May 2 11:22:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. That's not my point. We added him and people were pleased with his production. If not lights out amazing, he worked how we needed him to. I feel that Bowe and Hartline will do the same."
Browns,34lok1,MHanky,2,Sat May 2 11:26:36 2015 UTC,Oh ok. The way you worded it made it sound like you thought we still had him. I hope bowe still has something in the tank. I hate getting these once great receivers at the end of their career.
Browns,34lok1,droidworkerbee,3,Sat May 2 11:32:41 2015 UTC,No prob. I do need to work on wording things better sometimes.
Browns,34lok1,Chiranthodendron,3,Sat May 2 11:44:32 2015 UTC,"Austin was replaced with Hartline. Bowe was brought in as the ""#1"""
Browns,34lok1,djroomba322,-8,Sat May 2 11:27:07 2015 UTC,"Signing temporary players who are on the downside of their careers is pretty much the opposite of investing in free agency.  It is the quintessential stop gap.   Hawkins is a 3rd option who was playing above his station.   Basically the same people who complain we don't draft receivers are the same people who complain we don't have a QB to throw to said receivers, and then don't understand how those two things are related.   To a point, but you need receivers who can create their own space and help newbie QBs look good.  You need a big target who increases a throwing radius who catches everything.  Someone like, I don't know, Devante Parker.  Where the elite QBs have that pinpoint accuracy, Manziel obviously doesn't, and these receivers can bail him out. See: A&M.   Drafting a 5th round TE isn't the way to fix the position or that's what everyone would do."
Browns,34lok1,gakule,5,Sat May 2 11:56:53 2015 UTC,"You are fucking delusional. Just stop posting, holy shit."
Browns,34lok1,Beezer12WashingBird,4,Sat May 2 13:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Jordan Cameron is almost bad as a 5th round TE, he was drafted in the 4th. And look how he turned out. He can't play TE to save his life. Ozzie Newsome knows all this stuff, I don't know how Ray Farmer doesn't."
Browns,34lok1,Illinois_Jones,2,Sat May 2 14:22:11 2015 UTC,"Good TEs can be found in the 4th and 5th. Not to mention, we don't know how important a pass-catching TE will be in our new offense. Our WRs are fine. Having one big target isn't going to save us if our QBs aren't accurate. Big target receivers are a luxury, not a necessity. I'd rather have quick guys who can get off the line and run good routes"
Browns,34lok1,bad_master,4,Sat May 2 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"At WR, DeAndre Smelter seems like a guy who can catch a first down, and Darren Waller, at 6'6'', seems like he can take advantage of mismatches and make TDs. I'd like to get both, as they are complementary. Neither are breakout WRs.  At TE, I like Nick O'Leary or Blake Bell. Both are tough, aggressive guys who can catch a pass."
Browns,34lok1,rodion_kjd,3,Sat May 2 07:34:49 2015 UTC,"We have serviceable, veteran guys across the TE and WR positions. I know none of you guys want to talk about it but we don't have anyone to throw the ball to an elite, stud WR. Our picks in the 1st and 2nd rounds have instantly made us a better team. Having an elite receiver on the field would just be frustrating. It'll be the 1st thing they go for next year if one of our QBs shows he's the man."
Browns,34lok1,AnalRapistGhandi,1 point,Sat May 2 12:21:58 2015 UTC,I'm a little disappointed we didn't take a WR in these last two drafts because there was a lot of talent there. But I like our picks this year so I'm not gonna fret about it too long.
Browns,34lok1,Putuinurplace,1 point,Sat May 2 14:13:29 2015 UTC,"I want a tight end still, but even as someone who REALLY wanted a WR what we need is a number one guy, not a two or a three. So with what is left I don't want to draft one anymore. Only way one turns into the stud we need is if we get lucky. Let's keep turning this defense into a juggernaut."
Browns,34lok1,R101C,1 point,Sat May 2 14:48:56 2015 UTC,"I have two thoughts on the draft.    I love the picks so far.  I hate not having an answer at wr or qb.    The point is that I want everything now, but get that you have to build it right, put people in places to succeed, and get better each year. So the I want it now part of me just wants to destroy the steelers by 40 twice a year. Meanwhile, the patient part of me is glad we can now pound them on both sides of the ball, and maybe make a few close games wins instead of losses. And wr isn't a train wreck, but a nice young #1 would be a cool toy to have. It just wouldn't be useful yet though.   With a brutal schedule and a lot of exploration needed at qb, this year should be about laying a strong foundation and continuing the culture change.   I wasn't sold going into free agency.  Right now I'm pretty happy. I'll give Farmer another 13 months before I judge his plans. The top of this draft is far superior to last year's, and if the bottom has a few hits like last year, it will be an incredible class for the Browns."
Browns,34lok1,djroomba322,-17,Sat May 2 15:17:17 2015 UTC,"The plan is pretty straight forward. Try to build a team like Seattle.  Except without the good qb or elite rb.  Have a good defense to keep games close. In a passing league, where ever single playoff team had quality qbs and quality receivers, we are building the exact opposite of that.  There is no one in the draft left to address the wr position. Everyone has a combination of poor measurable, off the field concerns, or questionable talent.  Their plan is to lose this year, evaluate manziel, and then when Gordon comes back next year, try to win."
Browns,34lok1,Beezer12WashingBird,8,Sat May 2 10:02:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah everyone. This guy knows all the ins and outs of the Browns. Of course they want to lose this year, I mean it's not like their jobs depend on them being competitive. Jimmy had a sit down with Ray and Mike and /u/djroomba322 and said ""Dont worry about this year boys, do what you can with our roster. Make only picks in the draft that would be detrimental to our success and you know what, just have fun with it""."
Browns,34lok1,Illinois_Jones,3,Sat May 2 14:26:47 2015 UTC,Assuming Gordon comes back.  Not to be a downer but he has burned so many chances its hard to trust him to straighten up.

Thought I would just peek in the other night to see if things had changed to be greeted by:    @DawgPoundNation  ·  Apr 30 Ray Farmer, you are trash. GTFO of Cleveland. Moron.

If I hear of Farmer or Pettine speaking to the media, I'll usually do a YouTube search for ""Pettine"" and then filter down to ""posted today"" and it'll bring up the reporters' vids from the presser before they hit the news.

Browns,34n1iv,dring_round,2,Sat May 2 17:28:41 2015 UTC,I think it would be a solid developement player.  If we can grab him in the 5th or UDFA why the heck not.
Browns,34n1iv,Zedress,4,Sat May 2 17:32:04 2015 UTC,I dont think we have a 5th
Browns,34n1iv,Jhonopolis,1 point,Sat May 2 17:35:40 2015 UTC,We have enough trade bait with 3x sixth round picks & 3x seventh picks to make a move in the fifth.  ....but I honestly forgot that little fact...
Browns,34n1iv,Zedress,2,Sat May 2 17:37:41 2015 UTC,We have nothing to lose at this point so I wouldn't be surprised if we picked him up
Browns,34n1iv,Stowcenter93,2,Sat May 2 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"I like Hundley and he won't go undrafted, but I don't think we should be the ones to draft him."
Browns,34n1iv,pievdelta,1 point,Sat May 2 18:01:24 2015 UTC,Looks like he is getting drafted after all :)
Browns,34juzw,Candygram_for_Mongo,11,Fri May 1 19:47:43 2015 UTC,"Prepare for WR, TE, or OLB. Those seem to be unaddressed positions of need with a prospect that might be available at our pick, or after a trade up or down. We could also look at a second OL or DL, but that would surely be a pure depth pick, and I think it's too early to pick depth in the second or third."
Browns,34juzw,Doyle524,10,Fri May 1 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"I full expect a pass rusher.  We are going for the smart non-flashy picks it seems. A pass rusher is a need and something good teams have. After Farmer's tirade about WR's earlier, I fully expect that to be picked last (and also be a returner #1)."
Browns,34juzw,supaloco,2,Fri May 1 20:11:29 2015 UTC,You were right.
Browns,34juzw,scsmith83,1 point,Sat May 2 01:40:54 2015 UTC,I wish I wasn't. Jaelen Strong and Eli Harold would have made me a very happy man.
Browns,34juzw,supaloco,3,Sat May 2 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"Strong, Kendricks, or Williams would be awesome tonight."
Browns,34juzw,APF429,4,Fri May 1 20:23:17 2015 UTC,My guess would be just enough so we can send the whole team to away games on one plane and not be over weight limits.
Browns,34juzw,shaneration,3,Fri May 1 22:02:44 2015 UTC,Another cook in the kitchen. No way current staff can keep up with this much horsepower.
Browns,34juzw,R101C,2,Fri May 1 23:57:52 2015 UTC,Personally I'm hoping for Maxx Williams or Randy Gregory. If Maxx is there after the first 5-6 picks I'd be totally fine trading up a few spots to make sure we can snag him.  Gregory is a risk but I feel like our first round was solid and safe enough we can afford to take a riskier pick in the 2nd.
Browns,34juzw,TrueSol,2,Fri May 1 21:01:51 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an article a few years back (I forget from who, if someone else can find it I would love to read it again), which showed the 'Hit' 'Ok' 'Bust' rate of first round draft picks by position.   What was really interesting was that the 'hit' vs 'bust' ratios were about the same for every position AND right at 50%. But that for line men—particularly interior linemen (i.e., Centers, Guards, Nose Guards D-Tackles) a larger proportion of them ended up in the 'Ok' category with the same ratio of 'hits' to 'busts' as the other positions.   The author speculated that this phenomenon may be a result of scouts having more difficultly grading these positions, so he dismissed the perceived effect. But there may be something to it, that you are more likely to get your projected value from these positions in the first round.   At any rate, what I'm trying to say is that the NFL draft is a coin flip situation with each pick. 50% bust, 50% hit. We wont know for years, but I like what they've done so far (as I hoped they would do in an earlier post)."
Browns,34juzw,Peninj,1 point,Fri May 1 22:42:47 2015 UTC,"So true. The linemen get no glory. All the hype is on QB, RB, WR. The teams that go far, get their by team effort. If you can't control the line of scrimmage, it doesn't matter how great your QB, RB, WR is."
Browns,34juzw,Bphill73,2,Fri May 1 23:16:30 2015 UTC,I would honestly cry tears of joy if we got maxx williams

Browns,34juzw,StalinOut,1 point,Fri May 1 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"I want a TE, WR or ass rusher too, but I think we're gonna shock some people and trade up for S Landon Collins.  Pettine likes having three safeties, Collins is versatile enough to play linebacker in dime formations, we need an heir to replace Whitner in 2 years and he could be a backup to Gibson should he go down and leave our secondary exposed again like last year.  If we get Collins, we literally get the best center, nose tackle and safety in the draft.  I hope we also trade up a second time too, there's a lot of talent available on the board."
Browns,34juzw,Cats_Boobs_Gameing,1 point,Fri May 1 23:05:02 2015 UTC,We need an offensive weapon. TE or WR
Browns,34juzw,gleaming-the-cube,1 point,Fri May 1 23:08:08 2015 UTC,we got a good offensive weapon in the DUKE who can catch out of the backfield and return kicks and punts and also be a fresh set of legs out of the backfield pretty stoked
Browns,34juzw,BorisTBurger,0,Sat May 2 08:41:05 2015 UTC,I like Darren Funchess (Hybrid WR/TE) and Eli Harold (DE/OLB). I hear that Maxx Williams is a problem in the locker room and has a bad attitude. I also like Jalen Strong but think Funchess will be more versatile.
Browns,34lb67,pievdelta,1 point,Sat May 2 04:03:06 2015 UTC,"You know, that's a pretty smart way of looking at this. The QBs are the main guys in the NFL; Mariota and Winston are the future main guys; find the guys that gave them problems."
Browns,34lb67,bad_master,1 point,Sat May 2 06:09:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that Winston and Mariota were both behind excellent offensive lines, so let's find guys who gave those lines problems."

Browns,34l1hh,SparksFlowing,10,Sat May 2 02:17:11 2015 UTC,"Really shifty and agile, great receiver out of the backfield - there was even some talk that about him moving to WR. Only real concerns I've seen are size/power. Love this pick, he complements Crowell really well."
Browns,34l1hh,Nottah,13,Sat May 2 02:23:22 2015 UTC,Lol I read that as shitty instead of shifty.

T west was inconsistent and crowell had fumble issues, and neither were great recievers. duke is an awesome pass catching back, more explosive than either of them as well. expect him to get a lot of 3rd down touches"
Browns,34l1hh,Masterdebater22,3,Sat May 2 02:29:58 2015 UTC,"I think he ends up as our version of Gio Bernard to Crowell's Jeremy Hill. Not totally on board with an RB but clearly rushing will be the core of this team, so might as well beef up the backfield."
Browns,34l1hh,Beezer12WashingBird,2,Sat May 2 02:31:20 2015 UTC,Don't know anything about him. But Murica picked him so that's pretty cool.

Browns,34l1hh,LosingMyEdge7,9,Sat May 2 02:24:08 2015 UTC,We don't have a 3rd down back and crow/west both have below average hands.   This guy will be in our two minute offense and play a larger part in the passing game. Wouldn't be surprised if he split wide a few times
Browns,34l1hh,Doyle524,2,Sat May 2 02:28:54 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why more teams aren't trying to find guys like this who they could teach to play several different skill positions within an offense. The flexibility you gain having 2 or 3 guys that can do that allows you to recover when important players get injured or if someone isn't performing.
Browns,34l1hh,Nerdlinger,1 point,Sat May 2 02:55:11 2015 UTC,We're going hard on versatility for sure.
Browns,34l1hh,SwiftBacon,3,Sat May 2 03:05:04 2015 UTC,Yeah… this one confuses me.  I guess we're not planning on passing this year.
Browns,34l1hh,Trilljoy,6,Sat May 2 02:27:21 2015 UTC,I heard he's a good catching receiver. Could help as a wild card RB for screens or in the slot.
Browns,34l1hh,curveball21,2,Sat May 2 02:28:24 2015 UTC,I'd like to think this is one of those don't draft for need but take the top graded player scenario's... but I'm confused as well.

Browns,34l1hh,Doyle524,0,Sat May 2 02:30:50 2015 UTC,Neither running back did much once Mack went down. Good running backs still make plays. I think he can start.

Browns,34l1hh,blackedout,1 point,Sat May 2 02:35:13 2015 UTC,"He may be the most purely talented out of Crowell, West, and himself, honestly. He's got a very unique but useful skillset that compliments itself extremely well to Crowell. I'd expect that they'd be used very much how the Bengals use Giovani Bernard and Jeremy Hill.   This leaves West as the odd man out, however. I would not be surprised if we tried to move him."

Only thing that I wasn't thrilled with was Farmers defense of T Benjamin as a return man.  Our return game last year was worst in the league. That's not acceptable, and I hate to see us defending god awful play. Don't need to draft that this early but I really hope that either Benjamin comes back a 100% different player this year (unlikely) or we deal with those huge issues in the mid to later rounds of the draft."
Browns,34j38f,TrueSol,2,Fri May 1 21:36:26 2015 UTC,"IMHO if you read between the lines of what Farmer was saying, he still wants to go with depth vs. skill players i.e. don't expect any flashy WR or TE drafted this second round. (Which is fine by me; I'd rather have all that set in place, then think about the TD machines.)"
Browns,34gwcx,cancrdancr,96,Fri May 1 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"Only player in the NCAA that was an on-field All-American AND an Academic All-American.   We got a smart player. Good dude, too."
Browns,34gwcx,DocAuch,37,Fri May 1 01:33:19 2015 UTC,"UW Fan here: He's a really good dude, he's spent a lot of his time at UW interning at a local (fantastic) museum called the Burke, that had a exhibit on Polynesian history, in order to gain a better perspective on his heritage. By all accounts he's a really down to earth kid. Also a goddamn good football player  http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-football/danny-shelton-has-worked-his-way-to-his-nfl-draft-moment/"

Browns,34gwcx,wardsac,2,Fri May 1 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"Since you know more than I do about him, what would be an apt NFL comparison?"
Browns,34gwcx,uwhuskytskeet,10,Fri May 1 01:58:48 2015 UTC,"Ngata and Wilfork are the most common comparisons.  Obviously lofty, but that is his ceiling at least."
Browns,34gwcx,droidworkerbee,2,Fri May 1 02:32:16 2015 UTC,More Wilfork than Ngata.
Browns,34gwcx,Brokewood,1 point,Fri May 1 09:47:26 2015 UTC,I'm not that high high on Shelton.   I'd firmly put him at Dan Williams.
Browns,34gwcx,subhuman1,1 point,Fri May 1 02:47:44 2015 UTC,He'll be a solid contributor if we use him as a one gap type at off tackle. The comparisons to Ngata are wishful thinking though. If we expect him to 2 gap/anchor at NT...everyone here is going to be in for a rude awakening.
Browns,34gwcx,RyanTcone,13,Fri May 1 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"My dad and I watched until our 2nd pick so I can't speak for any of the players selected later, but one thing he pointed out was that of ALL the players selected Shelton was the only player the panel had absolutely nothing negative to say about. Not a single criticism, simply praise.  I was of the opinion that this needed to be a WR/DL pick and when I saw Devante Parker get passed on at 11 my heart jumped, but after listening to Danny talk and hearing everything about him I'm a huge fan.  Go Browns!  Edit: I'm a Canadian and my dad is simply a ""football"" fan, he's not a Browns fan with any reason to fish for positive things to say about a player so to me that says something."

Browns,34gwcx,Schaftenheimen,8,Fri May 1 02:03:43 2015 UTC,"He also led the entire NCAA in sacks for the first 3 or 4 weeks of the season. As a fucking nose tackle. He doesn't have straight line speed, but he has quicks and explosion to go with being really big, and really strong.   The last NT to get drafted out of Washington, Alameda Ta'amu, wasn't as good as Shelton, and then he got picked by Pittsburgh. Yikes. You guys are a team I can get behind, unlike Pittsburgh. Can't wait to see him occupy double teams for years for you guys."

Browns,34gwcx,hvcatcher,19,Fri May 1 19:20:30 2015 UTC,Husky fan stopping in to say that you just got an amazing player.  Have you seen the barrel roll .gif yet?  Danny's more than just that play though.  He stuffs runs up the middle but is quick enough to chase down backs trying to run outside.  He collapses the pocket on passing downs like a monster; Hau'oli Kikaha owes him a lot of sacks.  He doesn't take plays off.  And he might have been the best student on the football team last year too.    Bottom line is you guys got a monster and I'm gonna be watching quite a few Browns games next year.
Browns,34gwcx,sil0,9,Fri May 1 01:52:21 2015 UTC,The best part is that it worked! Holy crap.

Browns,34gwcx,kilo20,7,Fri May 1 02:26:58 2015 UTC,Apparently it was something he and the coach wanted to try for fun that game.  I don't think it's a regular move of his.

Double teams take him out of the game to easily and all his combine stats rank really low. They also said late in games he has a tendency to give up.  Not they can't be wrong obviously but I trust them a lot more than most.

First of all they do not have the contrast stitching (brown stitching on white jersey for example) and the CLEVELAND position is not the same as the official. The official has CLEVELAND lined up with the shoulder stripes. It may take some time before they can perfect the Chinese knockoff version to match the official.  http://kfdown.a.aliimg.com/kf/HTB1JC6JHFXXXXb6XVXXq6xXFXXXD.jpg

Browns,34kl4s,holdemtexas,5,Fri May 1 23:48:27 2015 UTC,"Titans just picked DBG. I'm so happy. He was the only guy in the draft I didn't want us to get. He has bust written all over him. He's also not as good as he appears. Even the announcers pointed out, he doesn't play to his size, smaller corners push him around and for a guy at 6'5"", he has a horrible vertical leap."
Browns,34kl4s,Beezer12WashingBird,1 point,Fri May 1 23:54:50 2015 UTC,His leap can't be fixed but muscling around small CB's can
Browns,34kl4s,GonnaTossItAway,3,Sat May 2 00:42:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I really don't think we're going for a wr. I could see a te because they block and catch passes. Is that Max Williams any good at blocking?
Browns,34kl4s,TheFranchise36,2,Sat May 2 00:01:04 2015 UTC,I don't think trading up is going to be necessary.
Browns,34kl4s,Beezer12WashingBird,2,Fri May 1 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"Browns take a wr in the 2nd, what could go wrong! Believe in the process."
Browns,34kl4s,TheFranchise36,5,Fri May 1 23:52:23 2015 UTC,Your process or Ray farmers process? Because I don't think that's in his.

Browns,34h1b8,cancrdancr,44,Fri May 1 02:08:57 2015 UTC,After seeing what we got with Bitonio I absolutely trust this pick from our front office. He looks really good.
Browns,34h1b8,egg_s,10,Fri May 1 02:19:26 2015 UTC,Best oline in the NFL....and Mitchell Schwartz.
Browns,34h1b8,Deadleggg,4,Fri May 1 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"Well, the entire pro bowl line can't be from one team. We have to share some of the spotlight."
Browns,34h1b8,Nottah,1 point,Fri May 1 17:02:52 2015 UTC,Truth.
Browns,34h1b8,Deadleggg,22,Fri May 1 19:52:29 2015 UTC,Mack replacement?
Browns,34h1b8,The_Milk_man,37,Fri May 1 02:10:39 2015 UTC,He'll probably play G this year but he could move to C if Mack leaves
Browns,34h1b8,BMC4,15,Fri May 1 02:15:14 2015 UTC,Versatile guy that can play all across the line.  Start him out at right guard and let him learn the NFL game next to Mack then gives us leverage if Mack decides he wants to leave.  Nice solid pick.  I think we need to target a WR in the second round but this was a solid first round.
Browns,34h1b8,cmhdave73,7,Fri May 1 02:21:17 2015 UTC,I'm also interested to see if Schwartz improves with Erving next to him. I thought we would go tackle and move Schwartz inside but maybe he just needs someone better than Greco next to him
Browns,34h1b8,DrBasedGod,1 point,Fri May 1 02:47:24 2015 UTC,Like who? There is a pretty big talent drop off from the top wrs. Who is worth taking now?
Browns,34h1b8,djroomba322,6,Fri May 1 03:03:19 2015 UTC,is jaelen strong still on the boards?
Browns,34h1b8,Rectalcactus,3,Fri May 1 03:40:34 2015 UTC,Yep!  We have GOT to land him IMO.  I'd be so pumped.
Browns,34h1b8,themitey1,2,Fri May 1 05:31:49 2015 UTC,Yes
Browns,34h1b8,Abiv23,9,Fri May 1 04:33:36 2015 UTC,"Don't mean to some like a homer, but I'd be happy with Devin Smith. This team has no deep ball threat. He has the speed, size, vertical and hands to be that.  Lining up him, Bowe, and whatever TE ends up starting would be a goal line passing threat we haven't had since Braylon/Winslow."
Browns,34h1b8,SMK77,5,Fri May 1 03:39:39 2015 UTC,"This is the guy who makes a lot of sense, his speed is what our WR corps needs most after signing Bowe and Hartline. I also really like Jalen Strong from AZ."
Browns,34h1b8,Carpetron,1 point,Fri May 1 05:58:47 2015 UTC,There is a huge drop off between Cooper/White and Parker but not nearly as big a drop-off between Parker and Jaelen Strong or Devin Smith.  There were two clear-cut top pick WRs which we were not going to go after (again Farmer doesn't believe we need elite WRs to win) and then a bunch of guys grouped up in that second tier.
Browns,34h1b8,cmhdave73,3,Fri May 1 13:47:33 2015 UTC,Yeah this is a good fit for us
Browns,34h1b8,Dean_Craig_Pelton,1 point,Fri May 1 02:19:43 2015 UTC,I think this pick means Mack is leaving
Browns,34h1b8,SuperPoop,8,Fri May 1 03:00:49 2015 UTC,Replacement in a year. Viable starter rg now. Has played well at every position on the line for florida state.HUGE Pick up! Probably dont have to get another offensive lineman in this draft now
Browns,34h1b8,workPRODUCTIVITY-0,1 point,Fri May 1 02:19:35 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go that far just yet. A late round project OT is never a bad thing
Browns,34h1b8,Piece_of_Toast,7,Fri May 1 12:05:32 2015 UTC,Mack backup. Hell play elsewhere  And still be a pro bowler
Browns,34h1b8,ent4rent,20,Fri May 1 02:25:25 2015 UTC,I am pleased with our first round selections this year. Big bodies make big differences
Browns,34h1b8,Kujata,54,Fri May 1 02:18:06 2015 UTC,"Great First Round, really impressed with these picks"
Browns,34h1b8,Hoyef,-87,Fri May 1 02:11:53 2015 UTC,Didn't need oline
Browns,34h1b8,Mike_Shanahan,54,Fri May 1 02:18:54 2015 UTC,"Always need OLine, look at what happened after Mack went down"
Browns,34h1b8,smwell22,-54,Fri May 1 02:19:55 2015 UTC,You shouldn't build oline depth if you have needs.
Browns,34h1b8,Mike_Shanahan,24,Fri May 1 02:20:58 2015 UTC,"What other positions do we have a glaring need? The oline was awful after Mack got hurt last year. It's not like we need a receiver that badly,  and we're good everywhere else. This whole draft is just going to be depth"
Browns,34h1b8,mibikin,-38,Fri May 1 02:23:30 2015 UTC,Another defense palayer and WR.
Browns,34h1b8,Mike_Shanahan,12,Fri May 1 02:24:54 2015 UTC,palayer
Browns,34h1b8,RyanTcone,13,Fri May 1 02:46:26 2015 UTC,Just about sums it up doesn't it?
Browns,34h1b8,Marzman315,-11,Fri May 1 03:17:10 2015 UTC,Tcone
Browns,34h1b8,Mike_Shanahan,14,Fri May 1 02:47:40 2015 UTC,"Refers to an area of Winnipeg, subdivision named ""Transcona"". As kids we often jokingly referred to it as ""tcona/tcone"" so I incorporated it into my username.  What's your excuse?"
Browns,34h1b8,RyanTcone,-2,Fri May 1 02:54:12 2015 UTC,I am Russian.
Browns,34h1b8,Mike_Shanahan,6,Fri May 1 13:11:56 2015 UTC,"I've been telling people since before last year's draft, Farmer will not draft a WR in the first round. It's as likely as an NFL team drafting a punter first overall. Farmer has said as much. He said he doesn't value WRs enough to pick one up in the first round 2 years ago, and then last year he said he's following Seattle's plan for success which does not rely on a feature WR. Seattle's plan almost completely ignores WRs."
Browns,34h1b8,holdemtexas,6,Fri May 1 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"I'm actually perfectly OK with this. You don't need a stud receiver in this league and any more, its 50/50 that they'll cause more headaches than they're worth. It seems most 1st round receivers either need a babysitter or will take themselves out. And even the ones that do hit like a Calvin Johnson or Andre Johnson do not equal wins while the Patriots, Seahawks and Colts just keep a revolving door of smart and veteran receivers."
Browns,34h1b8,CBusin,2,Fri May 1 03:20:36 2015 UTC,Good luck on your PSATs next year!
Browns,34h1b8,Easy-A,-8,Fri May 1 03:54:48 2015 UTC,Here's what we should've done.  Traded Haden and Thomas for future firsts in 16 and 17.  Traded down in this year's draft and picked up extra firsts in 16.  Tanked HARD this season.  Draft a QB top 3 next year.  Problems solved.
Browns,34h1b8,tomchaney479,0,Fri May 1 03:00:33 2015 UTC,Sarcasim?
Browns,34h1b8,sil0,6,Fri May 1 04:12:00 2015 UTC,OLine is a need is what I'm saying....  He will play guard this year while being a viable backup center if Mack goes down and/or bolts.
Browns,34h1b8,smwell22,18,Fri May 1 02:28:18 2015 UTC,"Look at what a dominant OLINE made our offense look like last year.  You get Mack back and upgrade your right side with this pick.  WR can be picked up throughout the draft, and besides there's not a 1 left on the board.  Our offensive line is looking to be great next year, and we upgraded our DL which was a huge hole.  Dominate in the trenches and it makes everyone else suddenly look a lot better."
Browns,34h1b8,iCandid,16,Fri May 1 02:27:38 2015 UTC,Did you watch the right side last year? And the team went to shit when Mack went down…
Browns,34h1b8,DocAuch,10,Fri May 1 02:20:27 2015 UTC,"Mack can still opt out, need a plan b in case it bites us in the ass"
Browns,34h1b8,joe_incognito,-25,Fri May 1 02:22:18 2015 UTC,"What if I told you, we will have a draft next year. Should have picked a WR to improve the team and try to keep Mack."
Browns,34h1b8,Mike_Shanahan,14,Fri May 1 02:27:28 2015 UTC,What if I told you not all centers are ready to go day one like Mack was.  A possible replacement was a good pick.
Browns,34h1b8,miked1be,-8,Fri May 1 02:40:28 2015 UTC,Well then he shouldn't have been drafted at 19 close to where Mack was. This was a reach and no need.
Browns,34h1b8,huber14,11,Fri May 1 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"You're right we should totally compare draft position in one season vs draft position in a completely different season,  amazing logic."
Browns,34h1b8,miked1be,1 point,Fri May 1 02:54:16 2015 UTC,Exactly.   HAY GUISE THE REDSKINS REACHED BY TAKING A GUARD #5 OVERALL  That's the same logic as half of ESPN was using about Gurley and Gordon.
Browns,34h1b8,Doyle524,11,Fri May 1 07:02:04 2015 UTC,"What if I told you oline depth hurt us a lot more than receiver talent last year. Also, if you're replacing a guy who might be making protection calls in the future a full season to learn is a good thing."
Browns,34h1b8,joe_incognito,2,Fri May 1 02:41:17 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to wonder if you really are thee Mike Shanahan. You obviously don't know shit about football and apparently didn't watch all the games after Mack's injury. How we won 1 game after he went down, was amazing."
Browns,34h1b8,Nottah,0,Fri May 1 17:07:37 2015 UTC,We also won most of our games before by playing the little sisters of the poor.
Browns,34h1b8,Mike_Shanahan,1 point,Fri May 1 18:26:28 2015 UTC,I think this is an admission that Mack is gone after this year. Center is an important position and it's best to plan ahead.
Browns,34h1b8,Shockworth,8,Fri May 1 04:32:51 2015 UTC,As long as we have Mitchell Schwartz starting we need to draft oline.
Browns,34h1b8,StarfishBlack,5,Fri May 1 02:20:22 2015 UTC,"Schwartz was fine,  he'd be better with a decent guard next to him."
Browns,34h1b8,miked1be,6,Fri May 1 02:41:56 2015 UTC,Schwartz was above average last year actually
Browns,34h1b8,Mike_Shanahan,6,Fri May 1 02:22:56 2015 UTC,I think it's Greco who was bad
Browns,34h1b8,jswolfie316,7,Fri May 1 02:24:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, neither was bad.  Just not as good as the left side."
Browns,34h1b8,topper_mango,5,Fri May 1 02:42:55 2015 UTC,Well nobody's left side is better.
Browns,34h1b8,Deadleggg,1 point,Fri May 1 03:23:37 2015 UTC,And now Schwartz can move to guard and Greco can be a backup.
Browns,34h1b8,Ihateloops,2,Fri May 1 07:43:32 2015 UTC,"Mack, Greco and Schwartz can all be gone after next season. Oline was a huge need. Cohesion is a huge deal with offensive line. You can replace one, maybe two players a year without a problem but not 3."
Browns,34h1b8,shicken684,2,Fri May 1 12:47:39 2015 UTC,You never don't need o-line.
Browns,34h1b8,Deadleggg,0,Fri May 1 14:40:24 2015 UTC,well that's just not true
Browns,34h1b8,Mike_Shanahan,12,Fri May 1 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"It threw me off, but I get it completely. I mean our entire season was ruined because we had no center and Mack can leave after next season. This guy is apparently a good guard too. If Mack does decide to stay he won't be negotiating with leverage as his replacement will already be on the team. This is an upgrade to a starting position and a replacement for another."
Browns,34h1b8,GPTrixie,2,Fri May 1 02:35:41 2015 UTC,"right! This gives us depth. Apparently he's really versatile. I mean, what if Joe Thomas goes down? now what? This is a great insurance policy and makes our whole line better."
Browns,34h1b8,usurper7,2,Fri May 1 05:11:24 2015 UTC,I really hope you knocked on wood.
Browns,34h1b8,SirOctavious,2,Fri May 1 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"I beat the door down, don't worry."

Browns,34h1b8,Norka19,5,Fri May 1 02:59:37 2015 UTC,Well I only had one upvote I could give but I tried.
Browns,34h1b8,miked1be,12,Fri May 1 03:34:44 2015 UTC,Because I made a pun in drafting two 300+ lbs players in the first round means I don't like the picks? Omg I just your user name is...
Browns,34h1b8,Norka19,8,Fri May 1 02:48:36 2015 UTC,Calm down. Geeze some people on our sub are immature.
Browns,34h1b8,misterstevew,10,Fri May 1 02:57:45 2015 UTC,I want to respond but I'm not even sure what to say to you
Browns,34h1b8,CdotW,15,Fri May 1 03:05:25 2015 UTC,I believe in playing to your strength and offensive line is a great strength to have. Any chance we have the league's top line when healthy?
Browns,34h1b8,suphater,6,Fri May 1 03:20:27 2015 UTC,I hope so.
Browns,34h1b8,Beezer12WashingBird,5,Fri May 1 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"We were already in the top 5, I have to believe starting Cam over Greco or Schwartz improves it to the best in the league, and even if one of the starters does get injured, we have a Schwartz or a Greco that can fill in at a high level."
Browns,34h1b8,Doyle524,4,Fri May 1 02:40:51 2015 UTC,Definitely. No more messing around with Ryan Semour and Nick MacDonald
Browns,34h1b8,Chiranthodendron,2,Fri May 1 02:33:32 2015 UTC,I don't know who you could even put ahead of us besides the Eagles and Cowboys.
Browns,34h1b8,FL14,6,Fri May 1 02:39:40 2015 UTC,Thomas Bitonio Mack Erving Schwartz all 1st or 2nd round picks
Browns,34h1b8,patagonian_pegasus,3,Fri May 1 07:06:16 2015 UTC,"As of right now, I'm calling them the best 5 picks we've made in the top 2 rounds since we came back."
Browns,34h1b8,Doyle524,2,Fri May 1 02:47:22 2015 UTC,Haden?
Browns,34h1b8,MonarchStarcrack,2,Fri May 1 13:16:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, fine, 5 out of 6."
Browns,34h1b8,Doyle524,2,Fri May 1 03:56:45 2015 UTC,5 out of 6 ain't bad!
Browns,34h1b8,MonarchStarcrack,2,Fri May 1 07:11:04 2015 UTC,And a much needed course correction on the way we as a franchise have handled the draft (Jeff Faine being the only offensive lineman taken earlier than the sixth round in the first eight drafts after expansion).
Browns,34h1b8,topper_mango,1 point,Fri May 1 13:11:09 2015 UTC,"Yep. Of course we did get based Pontbriand in the 5th in 2002, but he was never a lineman per se."
Browns,34h1b8,Doyle524,7,Fri May 1 13:18:18 2015 UTC,I was so nervous going into the draft with all the speculation over Mariota and whatnot but after tonight I am completely ecstatic with the way Farmer and the boys executed this thing. Super conservative and very well thought out. We could have one of the best defensive fronts and shored up some potential loose ends on the line. Only thing I can think of is the Crow and West blasting into the secondary through wide open lanes. Caw Caw Caw!!!!
Browns,34h1b8,thisshitsuxz,7,Fri May 1 14:03:28 2015 UTC,Looks like Ray is playing it safe in the first round. Wasn't expecting a wr in round one. Guess I was right.
Browns,34h1b8,Beezer12WashingBird,6,Fri May 1 18:22:10 2015 UTC,freaking awesome. finally a 1st round i can believe in. let the talent flow through you cleveland......... no more bullshit
Browns,34h1b8,foxtrot-uniform,5,Fri May 1 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with this. It's a quietly solid first round. Erving will slot in well at RG and beat up motherfuckers trying to get to Manziel this season. If Mack leaves, he's a safety valve. This is perfect. Not as good as Dupree, but definitely a safe, safe pick."
Browns,34h1b8,JohnnyFire,1 point,Fri May 1 04:26:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. Solely as a G or solely as a C, it probably doesn't make a lot of sense. But the fact that he could play G now and fill in at C if Mack leaves combined makes him a valuable pick specifically for CLE."
Browns,34h1b8,meyer_33_09,1 point,Fri May 1 02:18:31 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if I wanted Dupree because he will be a beast or because I wanted to make sure the steelers didn't get him...
Browns,34h1b8,shicken684,2,Fri May 1 02:28:21 2015 UTC,"Dupree is very raw.  My only (and it's a very, very ill run hope here, because it's still Pittsburgh) hope is that in a wake of LeBeau leaving, the new defense won't be able to tap into Bud to his full potential."
Browns,34h1b8,JohnnyFire,6,Fri May 1 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"Fantastic picks by Farmer. I'm impressed he learned from last year and didn't try to rush anything, no moving up, just sit still and take the players that fall to you. As for everyone calling for a WR, I think WR is probably the deepest position this draft. Lots of studs left in the second round. We added two much needed big boys to our lines and I'm excited to see what they can do! GO BROWNS!"
Browns,34h1b8,caruto12,4,Fri May 1 03:04:32 2015 UTC,Went to Florida State for undergrad saw him play countless times. Dude can ball.
Browns,34h1b8,t3h_shammy,10,Fri May 1 12:52:29 2015 UTC,Just a guess: someone at center that can hopefully be groomed as a viable backup to Alex Mack or a replacement if he skips town next season.
Browns,34h1b8,largefarva68,3,Fri May 1 13:22:59 2015 UTC,Hopefully they start him at guard this year. I think he will wind up being a great guard.  I don't like the idea of drafting a backup at 19.
Browns,34h1b8,Doyle524,2,Fri May 1 03:12:21 2015 UTC,"Until a few years ago, the #1 pick usually ended up sitting most of the year."
Browns,34h1b8,Kenya151,4,Fri May 1 02:48:24 2015 UTC,"This is the pick I wanted.    I know it was a long time ago, but remember our offensive line when Mack was healthy last year?  Remember Tate and West and Crowell combining for 200 yards a game?  Remember Hoyer having entire quarters' worth of time to pick a receiver and throw?  Mack is healthy, Erving is going to start at RG and our offensive line will be the best in football.  If Mack or (god forbid) Joe Thomas goes down, we have a viable backup for both and we won't fall apart like last year.  No team has a dominant running game without dominant guards.  I am biased towards offensive linemen in general and guards in specific for this reason.  Bitonio definitely is a dominant guard and I think Erving can be too.  Continuity on the offensive line is probably the greatest asset a team can have on offense.  Think of how many reps the Patriots' line had together with Brady and the Colts' line had with Manning.  If we lock up Mack long-term and lock up or replace Schwartz, we could have the best offensive line in the NFL for a LONG time.  I'm so stoked for this pick."
Browns,34h1b8,OnThatChildish,8,Fri May 1 02:10:27 2015 UTC,Wasn't expecting this but the OL needs the be strong and our season faltered when we didn't have a good backup for Mack. He'll start somewhere on the line for us this year. Probably guard or RT
Browns,34h1b8,miked1be,3,Fri May 1 03:07:22 2015 UTC,Throwing him in as a guard or tackle?
Browns,34h1b8,topper_mango,7,Fri May 1 07:07:01 2015 UTC,I'm guessing guard for now or backup center/replacement if Mack walks next year.
Browns,34h1b8,NJMarky,3,Fri May 1 03:55:36 2015 UTC,Interior lineman I would guess.  Has issues in pass protection when playing tackle.  Didn't shoot up draft boards until he moved inside halfway through last season.
Browns,34h1b8,LongLiveEddieHouse,5,Fri May 1 02:17:51 2015 UTC,Was he projected for the first round? Is this a reach?
Browns,34h1b8,derrman,17,Fri May 1 02:15:29 2015 UTC,15-25 range on all the drafts I've seen

Browns,34h1b8,meyer_33_09,2,Fri May 1 02:21:12 2015 UTC,What's the consensus on what position we should target next? Anyone else think we need linebacker depth also?
Browns,34h1b8,Diadave,2,Fri May 1 02:20:35 2015 UTC,"definitely need LBs, but I think WR is a likely choice with the next pick."
Browns,34h1b8,CBusin,2,Fri May 1 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"I like that given how we went last year, they went safe and strong. Can't go too far wrong when you have huge humans."
Browns,34h1b8,Nightcinder,2,Fri May 1 02:09:06 2015 UTC,"I love this pick. Adds protection, depth, isn't a reach and also saves a FA/draft pick saved for next season should Mack opt out.  I really love both the picks tonight. They both can jump in immediately and have an impact, have great attitudes (unlike Gilbert and manziel). One thing I loved about the team last season, even when it was coming apart at the end of the year, they didnt slouch over and these two just add to that mentality."
Browns,34h1b8,Whizard72,7,Fri May 1 02:51:41 2015 UTC,Really wanted WR =\
Browns,34h1b8,FL14,2,Fri May 1 03:03:23 2015 UTC,Lets be clear on this pick... he was drafted for versatility at guard and C on a line that needs depth and talent.
Browns,34h1b8,newsballs,1 point,Fri May 1 03:00:11 2015 UTC,"Oh Man. our OLine this year:  Thomas - Bitonio - Mach - Erving - Schwarz.  If Mitch S. can get his stuff together, gonna be scary."
Browns,34h1b8,theduke282,2,Fri May 1 03:13:32 2015 UTC,I think I prefer: Thomas Bitonio Mack Greco Erving
Browns,34h1b8,oLuckYz,1 point,Fri May 1 02:18:15 2015 UTC,I think this means they are fairly certain Alex Mack is gone after this season.  Either way its hard to argue against bolstering the O-Line when you look at how we collapsed last year after Mack went down.
Browns,34h1b8,Beezer12WashingBird,-2,Fri May 1 04:10:14 2015 UTC,Can I get a WR puhhhhleaseeee
Browns,34h1b8,chagtown,17,Fri May 1 13:08:00 2015 UTC,Farmer had made it abundantly clear that he thinks wr are over valued.
Browns,34h1b8,Beezer12WashingBird,20,Fri May 1 21:29:09 2015 UTC,Farmer just told us we're going to run the ball up and down the field. Smash mouth football. Cleveland football

Browns,34h1b8,youwithme,0,Fri May 1 02:19:11 2015 UTC,Lol
Browns,34h1b8,Beezer12WashingBird,6,Fri May 1 02:21:19 2015 UTC,So strange tho considering how many great WRs we passed on last year.
Browns,34h1b8,youwithme,6,Fri May 1 02:25:10 2015 UTC,I'm not disagreeing with you. He just doesn't buy into it.
Browns,34h1b8,Beezer12WashingBird,5,Fri May 1 07:12:34 2015 UTC,Word. I'm cool with the picks. Still would like a WR soon tho
Browns,34h1b8,oLuckYz,3,Fri May 1 07:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think he should draft one, I'm curious to see who he gets in the undrafted pool too."
Browns,34h1b8,Greenlytrees,3,Fri May 1 02:21:02 2015 UTC,OK Ray. OK.
Browns,34h1b8,Beezer12WashingBird,-8,Fri May 1 02:24:04 2015 UTC,"Too early. Dudes obviously a good player but this just doesn't make sense to me.  I know Mack may opt out but if he doesn't we just spent #19 on a right guard.  With several good receivers on the board too.  I know it takes two to tango, but we couldn't even trade down a bit?  I doubt teams were falling over themselves to take him. I loved Shelton but idk about this one.  DV if you must, but that's just my take."
Browns,34h1b8,g35fan,6,Fri May 1 02:31:25 2015 UTC,It adds depth to our line. I don't know if you were watching last year but our running game went to shit last year with one injury to our line. Not sure what's hard to understand.
Browns,34h1b8,Greenlytrees,4,Fri May 1 02:37:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Super solid pickup. Browns got both Hartline and Bowe, no reason to draft a WR here."
Browns,34h1b8,Beezer12WashingBird,1 point,Fri May 1 02:27:20 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it's not about him, it's about where he was drafted.  I understand the need for linemen just fine."
Browns,34h1b8,Greenlytrees,8,Fri May 1 02:22:20 2015 UTC,After Bitonio being the steal of the draft last year I trust Ray's ability to judge line talent.
Browns,34h1b8,_chess_,1 point,Fri May 1 02:28:47 2015 UTC,"When did I question his talent?  We took bitonio in the 30s, not at 19."
Browns,34h1b8,joeybelle,5,Fri May 1 02:34:47 2015 UTC,Right. So if Farmer values Bitonio as a 2nd round pick then he must really think something of Irving if he's taking him @19.
Browns,34h1b8,Doyle524,2,Fri May 1 02:31:03 2015 UTC,"I totally agree man. 19 is expensive, especially with all those names left on the board. We need to pray that Dupree isn't the truth."
Browns,34h1b8,Beezer12WashingBird,0,Fri May 1 02:36:18 2015 UTC,"He went to Pittsburgh, of course he's gonna be the truth and terrorize Manziel for years to come. :("
Browns,34h1b8,1nurseman,0,Fri May 1 02:41:30 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying, Farmer saw something in the guy. But I guess you know more than he does."
Browns,34h1b8,TapedeckNinja,3,Fri May 1 02:49:01 2015 UTC,Mack got injured and our incredible season went into a free fall. Back up insurance PLUS possible solid guard play. We just made our top OL that much better
Browns,34h1b8,usurper7,3,Fri May 1 02:46:14 2015 UTC,"Erving was mocked to the Chiefs at #18 as often as not, so I don't think it really qualifies as a reach.  We also have to consider that Thomas, Mack, and Greco will all be on the wrong side of 30 by the time this season ends.  I would not be surprised at all if Erving is our starting RT by the time the season rolls around, moving Schwartz inside to RG or to a backup role (Greco is a really good RG, especially in the running game, so Schwartz may be the odd man out)."

He is a perfect fit for Defilippo's scheme.  He can line up outside to create mismatches in the red zone.  He can play traditional TE and actually can BLOCK (gasp).  He lined up as a FB on multiple occasions, and ran routes from the backfield too.  Sport science said if he was one-on-one with leonard williams he has the potential to hurdle him bu TWO FEET.  Not to mention he has a great set of hands.  I just don't know how you pass him up if he's there for you. Defilippo has explicitly said this is the kind of guy he wants in the Y F slot at TE."

Browns,34izkt,_MitchPlease,2,Fri May 1 22:58:17 2015 UTC,Wow after watching that I could see him and Manzeil playing well together.
Browns,34izkt,anacondra,6,Fri May 1 23:10:43 2015 UTC,"The next two picks I believe are going to be WR and OLB/DE. Preferrably a pure DE if one is valued high enough.  In the second, that's Jaelen Strong, Randy Gregory, Devin Smith, Owamagbe Odighizuwa, Preston Smith, and maybe even Eddie Goldman.  In the third, that's Sammie Coates, Trey Flowers, Nate Orchard, Marcus Hardison, Tyler Lockett, Ha'uoli Kikaha.  In terms of value and players I want, a combo of Strong and Kikaha would be pretty awesome (THE WASHINGTON POLYNESIAN DOUBLE COMBO BITCHES!) but Flowers or Orchard in the third might make more sense."
Browns,34izkt,JohnnyFire,4,Fri May 1 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling Randy Gregory is nowhere near the Browns board. The other guys I like a lot, especially Strong. Y'all convinced me he's the best fit at WR."
Browns,34izkt,TucanJamz,3,Fri May 1 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"I freaking love Kikaha's game, but I would hesitate to take him before Day 3. He has a bad history with knee injuries, and his athleticism isn't exactly eye popping and he is currently limited to passing downs. That said he is a high-motor guy who can get after the QB, and the AFCN has three top-14 QBs. If the doctors are comfortable with his medical history, I say take him.  Edit: Actually I would love if we could move down a little and pick him up in later half of the 3rd and nab an extra 5th or 6th."
Browns,34izkt,bgrueyw,2,Fri May 1 15:52:27 2015 UTC,I would love a Preston Smith / Tyler Lockett. But strong / Flowers sounds good too.
Browns,34izkt,MercilessMizzou,3,Fri May 1 15:44:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe not quite a day two question, but something that just popped into my head:  When we do draft a WR, should we focus on one to be a return specialist? Or do we possibly draft two WRs with one being better in the return game?  I ask this because Benjamin hasn't shown a ton as a WR and has been a bit of a liability as a returner. Our ""punt catcher"" retired this year leaving us with a bit of a gap here."
Browns,34izkt,Mustang1718,2,Fri May 1 18:25:08 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. Gilbert returned punts in college, but we do need a KR."

Browns,34izkt,VonJaeger,2,Fri May 1 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"2nd would love to see Goldman or Strong there. Harold or Collins maybe? Collins is SS who blows up the run with an alpha demeanor and has better than avg coverage skills too. Pure depth pick but let's face it---counting on Whitner to be an above avg safety in 2016 is wishful thinking. And if he gets hurt...we're fuked as we have near zero depth at SS/FS. Kendricks or Perryman would both add needed attitude and depth at ILB too. Would we dare double up on the OL or DL? (Phillips, Goldman, Davis for DL, Fisher or Collins for OL)?"
Browns,34izkt,Jhonopolis,2,Fri May 1 18:31:47 2015 UTC,"Personally? Jaelen Strong, Devin Smith, Preston Smith, Owa Odighizuwa, Nate Orchard is my top five for pick 43.   For the third round, take whatever position you didn't in the second.   Ideally, I'd love to have Devin Smith and Trey Flowers. I'd be really happy if that's how it went."

Browns,34gx39,Kujata,1 point,Fri May 1 19:52:44 2015 UTC,"The OL normally spreads out more when running a shotgun formation. The left tackle is there, just off to the left and back a yard or so."
Browns,34gx39,Doyle524,1 point,Fri May 1 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty solid move. It doesn't look like much, but he pushes up the left shoulder of the guard and gets him off balance, then stabs that right arm to brush past him to the inside. It shows he knows how to play with leverage and use that weight to his advantage. And his body lean... is awesome."

Browns,34h7fo,LosingMyEdge7,2,Fri May 1 03:16:16 2015 UTC,The lack of quality at those two positions specifically last year negated so much of our talent it was ridiculous. I can't wait to see what our linebackers can do when the opposing line is being eaten up by Shelton instead of getting to the second level right away. Or what we can do with a healthy Mack- Bitonio-Thomas when the right side doesn't collapse. Not to mention Erving's versatility will allow us to fill any future gaps in the line with the best player available instead of the best guard or center.

Browns,34jme9,Future_Timer,2,Fri May 1 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was wrong for Farmer to be ""confident"" with the tag. Farmer said go out and see what you can get, and we'll match it. I think it was a fair move for Mack and it will be unfortunate if he leaves because it shows he really just doesn't want to be in Cleveland."

Browns,34jme9,youwithme,3,Fri May 1 19:32:13 2015 UTC,Who says?  From what people are saying he'll probably opt out of his contract but could very well just end up signing a new one with the team.  This picture alone should give him some sort of benefit of the doubt.

Browns,34j2u9,Fred_Zeppelin,1 point,Fri May 1 16:07:41 2015 UTC,I heard multiple pundits saying Erving is better suited to play OC than OG. Does anyone know what skills a OG needs that an OC would not?
Browns,34j2u9,bgrueyw,1 point,Fri May 1 16:23:43 2015 UTC,OC? Offensive Coordinator?  I think he is versatile and can play C (Center) or G (Guard).
Browns,34j2u9,bmcclure937,2,Fri May 1 16:28:32 2015 UTC,The article said he was a tackle when he moved to Oline.
Browns,34j2u9,youwithme,2,Fri May 1 16:36:53 2015 UTC,Started at Tackle in college. Will (probably) not play OT in NFL.
Browns,34j2u9,bmcclure937,2,Fri May 1 16:54:18 2015 UTC,Just sayin he's def versitile
Browns,34j2u9,youwithme,2,Fri May 1 17:03:58 2015 UTC,"He's a four slot starter. The only position he can't play at a high level in the NFL is LT, he should be fine at RT if we decide to move Schwartz inside or keep Greco in the starting lineup. Logically, though, he'll probably replace Greco day 1 at RG."
Browns,34j2u9,Doyle524,2,Fri May 1 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"I used OC as an abbreviation for Offensive Center. I started it when I was putting players in a spreadsheet, it bothered me that every position but center was 2 letters.  I was looking for a more general answer as to what skills a good guard would have that a good center would lack, because many of the pundits I heard/read from say Erving will be a better NFL center than NFL guard."
Browns,34j2u9,bgrueyw,2,Fri May 1 18:54:41 2015 UTC,So what do you do for punters?
Browns,34j2u9,pg5042,1 point,Fri May 1 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"It was for Madden, and I never punt or kick field goals, so I didn't bother to include either position in the list."
Browns,34j2u9,bgrueyw,1 point,Sat May 2 03:09:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on the scheme. Most OG are expected to go one/one with just about any 4-3 tackle and hold there own. So you need a little more anchor. And in zone blocking the OG might need a bigger area of influence. Generally, you'll see OG being a little heavier than Centers. Its really scheme dependent though. And the OC and OL coach have their own preferences as well."

Browns,34ia7s,KevinMack25,6,Fri May 1 11:48:19 2015 UTC,"He seems to hold his own against a top opponent for the most part. At times he easily handle all of Beasley's moves. Other times, particularly at 2:50, Beasley is just too much. Overall I think Erving looked really good against the number 8 overall pick."
Browns,34ia7s,CursoryComb,1 point,Fri May 1 12:03:33 2015 UTC,"I can't be 100% but it looks much more like a communication issue than a technical issue there.  He stops that speed move several other times.    To me it looks like he's on the man side of the 6 man protection against a blitz.  His first kick step he's watching the blitz but then realizes maybe he needs to pick up the man and won't have help on the outside.  Its probably still his fault, but not a technique issue at least.   *Not that he doesn't get beat!  Also, if you look at 4:08 mark its the same type of rush and protection and his steps are completely different."
Browns,34ia7s,kpyle,1 point,Fri May 1 16:00:11 2015 UTC,Looks to me part of his problems were the fact that his QB was green as hell. He would have had good blocks if the QB would get rid of the ball or have any pocket awareness. Couple of the times the QB just had to step up in the pocket and Beasley would have been out of the play.
Browns,34ia7s,Daviroth,3,Fri May 1 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"The main takeaway I got from that video is that FSU is absolutely fucked now. That QB was awful.  Erving looked pretty good. He gets beat on speed around the outside when he does get beat, lost a couple of matchups because of miscommunication with a blocking back it seems as well. All-in-all I'd say he did a pretty good job against the athletic freak that is Beasley."
Browns,34ia7s,joe_incognito,1 point,Fri May 1 14:08:56 2015 UTC,"He gets too high some times, but his hands are really impressive. When he stayed lower in his stance and locked Beasley up he just tossed him around. And damn does Beasley remind me of Mingo a lot."

Browns,34ghf4,CAJASH,12,Fri May 1 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"I know this thread is to get us away from /r/NFL, but the Erving pick has received a ton of praise. I personally didn't know anything about him, but I found this:   FSU runs a lot of stretch zone and outside zone so the center not only has to cut off the play side defensive tackle, but also seal the 2nd level LB for the run play to work. This is another area where I think Erving excelled at. In a zone scheme, you really just want to take the DT where he wants to go, and if you can cross his face, that's really just a cherry on top. Well, Erving added quite a few cherries on top of his blocks while still putting himself in a position to wall off the LB at the next level.   The best part is that it described his pass blocking at being even better than his run blocking that is described here."

Browns,34ghf4,fear865,7,Fri May 1 02:20:06 2015 UTC,everyone on /r/nfl not getting the Erving pick just makes me more excited about it. i think it was an excellent move that you see other teams make but not us. he's versatile enough that he will start somewhere on our line and will have a year in our system under his belt if Mack leaves

I don't want Gordon anywhere near Cleveland, he's had his chances and fucked up multiple times...once? okay. Twice? Ehh, okay.   What's this now? The 879th time he's been popped for weed?

He also has the mobility to drop into coverage. He'll be a great NFL player, mark my words. There have only been two other Huskers the last ten years or so I swore would be great in the NFL; Suh (duh), and Lavonte David. Whoever picks Gregory will absolutely not regret it."

Browns,34jhs5,SmokeySmokes,3,Fri May 1 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"I doubt we get 7 more years out of Joe.  For one, he's more a technique guy than a road grader, so when his game goes, it will be all at once.

Browns,34iopk,dayflyer55,11,Fri May 1 14:11:26 2015 UTC,"He will probably play RG. That allows him or Greco (whoever loses the battle) to provide interior line depth since both players can probably play all three interior positions (we know Greco can, and he can do them all pretty solidly as well), it's just a matter of Erving being able to play or not.  If he works out half as well as Bitonio we will be in the running for the best line in the NFL, hell.. we were pushing for that without him. I hope Manziel is working on his pocket passing, because he is going to have all goddamn day to throw the ball and Crow/West need to get their CDL, because they are gonna have truck lanes to drive through."

Browns,34iopk,JohnnyFire,4,Fri May 1 15:10:04 2015 UTC,I would guess RG and backup C.  RT is just as likely I bet.  So let's say the right side and backup C.
Browns,34iopk,corenfa,3,Fri May 1 14:19:00 2015 UTC,Let him push Schwartz and Greco for their spot and put the best 5 out there you can.
Browns,34iopk,joe_incognito,4,Fri May 1 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"My guess is RT.  Schwartz isn't bad but every other player on the line is near the top of their position, and Schwartz is just average.  I guess we'll see how camp plays out.  The only thing I can say with certainty is that Erving won't be playing LT, but anything else is fair game."
Browns,34iopk,TapedeckNinja,3,Fri May 1 14:31:54 2015 UTC,Well he isn't playing lg either.  Bitonio is a gem.
Browns,34iopk,TapedeckNinja,8,Fri May 1 14:36:16 2015 UTC,This is true but Bitonio played outside in college and could potentially move to RT if the coaching staff thinks Erving at LG and Bitonio at RT is the best combination.
Browns,34iopk,bjs2,2,Fri May 1 14:45:30 2015 UTC,Now that's a really interesting take. I just wonder if they thought he would do a better job at RT than Schwartz last year why they didn't move him there and move Schwartz to LG.  But who the hell knows-  champagne problems on the O-Line right now.
Browns,34iopk,JohnnyFire,1 point,Fri May 1 15:37:14 2015 UTC,Anywhere. We'll figure out a spot for him
Browns,34iopk,battle_squid,1 point,Fri May 1 14:23:32 2015 UTC,RG.  My dream right now is that Donavon Smith somehow slips into the fourth and we add both (With Smith moving to RT). Why would Mack want to leave that O-Line? Solid on all sides.

Browns,34iopk,Philoburger,1 point,Fri May 1 16:03:53 2015 UTC,"Ideally, he is a solid backup for the first half of the season at least. Greco and Schwartz improve so there is no need to rush Erving. Remember, the dude has only played OL for like 2 years. He needs a lot of work/reps but his upside is real. I see him as a starter for us at C,RG or RT for many years."
Browns,34iopk,VonJaeger,1 point,Fri May 1 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"I really believe that Mack will take off and they really wanted him for his ability to be a center...and he will probably start at guard, but insurance policy for sure"
Browns,34iopk,TemujinRi,1 point,Fri May 1 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like they're going to have a three way competition at RT with Schwartz, Bowie, and Erving; I also think that they're going to have a competition at RG with Erving and Greco. It won't be a ""publicized"" competition, but they're certainly going to look at who is playing the best and that is going to be who starts.  I'm really curious on if Bowie can overtake Schwartz, honestly. We could be looking at two new starters on the right side."
Browns,34iopk,VonJaeger,1 point,Fri May 1 19:18:06 2015 UTC,"I'm also curious about Bowie. He won the starting job in Seattle the year they won the Superbowl,and only lost it due to injury. Coach Carroll said the only reason he was available for us to steal was he'd reported overweight after the injury.If he's hungry enough he can push Schwartz hard for that RT spot."
Browns,34iopk,topper_mango,1 point,Fri May 1 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"Bowie's an excellent run blocker. If he can work on his technique at pass blocking, he'll almost certainly start over Schwartz. There's a reason Seattle was extremely upset with Cleveland when we snagged him."

Browns,34h7jf,Taurath,17,Fri May 1 03:05:48 2015 UTC,"It really is though...  Hoyer looked great last year when we had Mack and our o-line was thuggin.  Also, look at Dallas's o-line last year.  They were amazing and made Romo look like an MVP candidate (he's not) and were the major reason for Demarco's absurd year."
Browns,34h7jf,--MG--,2,Fri May 1 03:26:32 2015 UTC,I mean Romo is a pretty damn good quarterback but I agree.  Winning in the trenches makes everyone else look a lot better and last year was clear evidence of that.
Browns,34h7jf,iCandid,1 point,Fri May 1 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah that kind of came off like he was discrediting Romo.....Dude can play QB and I'd kill to have him on our team.  That said...I'm happy with the Erving pickup. I wanted two lineman (O and D), and if not I wanted DL/WR...so I'm happy."
Browns,34h7jf,Koalaz,8,Fri May 1 23:23:09 2015 UTC,It better be.  Every other good AFC team I looked at averages a 3rd to 5th round pick for their OL starters and we average pick 23.
Browns,34h7jf,surlysci,14,Fri May 1 03:30:58 2015 UTC,I hate to say this because our line is awesome but that title still belongs to the Cowboys. Down vote me if you must I feel gross for saying it so I understand. Probably best O-line and D secondary in the AFC though.
Browns,34h7jf,LosingMyEdge7,10,Fri May 1 03:53:41 2015 UTC,"Eh, we can be the second best O-line and still be ok I think."
Browns,34h7jf,Bannakaffalatta1,8,Fri May 1 05:10:31 2015 UTC,Best O-Line*  *In the AFC
Browns,34h7jf,ARabidMonkee,2,Fri May 1 07:05:12 2015 UTC,Yep. Totally cool with that. I can't wait for the season to start.
Browns,34h7jf,Bannakaffalatta1,1 point,Fri May 1 12:34:18 2015 UTC,I got downvotes in /r/NFL for saying we have a top 3 offensive line in the league. Fuck them.
Browns,34h7jf,kpyle,2,Fri May 1 19:18:22 2015 UTC,The team that wins the battle in the trenches usually wins the game. We improved both lines today. I'm extremely happy with that first round.
Browns,34h7jf,Fakespeedbump,-1,Fri May 1 05:47:58 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think that's one of those things that sounds truer then it is. Last year side we've had a good offensive line for a long time and it's been for shit."
Browns,34h7jf,jvpewster,1 point,Fri May 1 14:49:35 2015 UTC,Because our defensive line has been getting absolutely manhandled. When your watching games this year at any level pay closer attention to what the lines are doing and who's getting the push more often. When the defensive line disrupts it creates opportunities for the guys behind them by forcing the quarterbacks into bad throws and running backs to make extra decisions etc.. When the offensive line protects those things don't happen. All the little things that happen in the trenches are so overlooked by the average fan but they create the opportunities and that adds up. Of course it's not always true because there's a thousand other factors at play but from what I've seen it happens more times than not.
Browns,34h7jf,Fakespeedbump,1 point,Fri May 1 15:14:21 2015 UTC,"That doesn't change the fact that from 2011-14 wet had a good offensive line and still been atrocious on offense, and that last year despite having a poor d line, or defense was still this tends saving grace. I'm not saying it's not a key component but it's just another piece to the puzzle"
Browns,34h7jf,jvpewster,1 point,Fri May 1 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"our line is good, and just got better, but its not Cowboys good.  its definitely on the QB now though, cant really do much better up front"
Browns,34h7jf,Mungina,2,Fri May 1 16:31:14 2015 UTC,Thomas > Smith (but it's close)  Bitonio = Martin  Mack > Frederick  Greco/Erving = Bernadeu (arguably leans toward Bernadeu)  Free > Schwartz (but Free is much older and pretty inconsistent)  I don't really think theirs is that much better and if it is it's not by too much.
Browns,34h7jf,Marzman315,0,Fri May 1 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"it doesn't matter splitting it up player by player.  their line out performed ours when healthy and their line certainly outperformed ours when mack went down.  as a unit they were flat out better, we might have had individually better players but that doesnt really matter when dallas played better as a unit."
Browns,34h1yc,The_sweat,35,Fri May 1 02:14:20 2015 UTC,I mean we all saw how bad the line got when Mack went down last year. Can't hurt to get a guy in the line that can switch to center with no problem.
Browns,34h1yc,Dr_Smexy,-19,Fri May 1 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"you don't build depth with a 1st round (19th overall pick) pick, you get an impact player. He's got a lot of talent, no doubt, but I'm pretty disappointed no WR AGAIN."
Browns,34h1yc,AthlonRob,18,Fri May 1 02:49:55 2015 UTC,What... he's going to be a starter lol. Much bigger day 1 improvement than Dorsett could provide.
Browns,34h1yc,TrueSol,7,Fri May 1 03:10:41 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think WR would have been a stretch at 19. There will be a lot of talented receivers in the second round. If we don't take one in the 2nd or 3rd, I will be pissed, but I think not going WR here at 19 was a good decision."
Browns,34h1yc,meyer_33_09,2,Fri May 1 02:57:45 2015 UTC,"You realize any WR we draft would be depth? Bowe and Hartline will start on the outsides, with Hawkins at the slot."
Browns,34h1yc,AKlep,5,Fri May 1 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"If we drafted one at 19, they no doubt beat out one of those guys. Probably Bowe."
Browns,34h1yc,24rubikscube,1 point,Fri May 1 03:57:38 2015 UTC,Bowe > Perriman. Easily.
Browns,34h1yc,Marzman315,1 point,Fri May 1 18:57:03 2015 UTC,That's not true at all. There's definitely doubt as to whether that WR would start. It's not a given that a rookie is gong to beat out the Chiefs' all time WR reception leader.
Browns,34h1yc,AKlep,1 point,Fri May 1 08:16:07 2015 UTC,"He's going to start, probably at guard, but he'll be able to play center no problem if the worst happens. Unlike last year where one guy never played the position and the other was some random FA pick up"
Browns,34h1yc,reddit_like_its_hot,14,Fri May 1 04:04:18 2015 UTC,"Smart pick, he can play all over the line, with Mack's future in question this is a great pick"
Browns,34h1yc,RylanTheWalrus,20,Fri May 1 02:20:28 2015 UTC,So we won't have to see Greco this year? Me likey

Browns,34h1yc,Nightcinder,2,Fri May 1 02:51:19 2015 UTC,"Schwartz is the guy who has been on the chopping block for a while now.  I think they'll push Bowie, Schwartz, and Erving at RT, and Greco and Erving at RG."

Browns,34h1yc,meyer_33_09,1 point,Fri May 1 03:26:38 2015 UTC,A lot of Eagles flairs. I unno. Maybe I was out looking for it. I saw a lot of praise as well.
Browns,34h1yc,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,6,Fri May 1 03:28:33 2015 UTC,"Everybody who thinks they know anything about football says Mack will be gone next year. If that is the case, this looks like a really smart pick."
Browns,34h1yc,LosingMyEdge7,7,Fri May 1 02:54:59 2015 UTC,And if Mack stays we just buffed up that right side considerably.
Browns,34h1yc,Dr_Smexy,11,Fri May 1 03:57:41 2015 UTC,No issues for me. Mack is probably gone after the season.
Browns,34h1yc,rcstro,15,Fri May 1 02:16:58 2015 UTC,Mack gets hurt again or leaves at the end of the year we have an awesome guy to fill in. Mack stays then he rocks it at the right guard. Shockingly pragmatic for us. I am pleased.
Browns,34h1yc,24rubikscube,10,Fri May 1 02:22:21 2015 UTC,I love how none of the ESPN analysts could understand this.
Browns,34h1yc,Flysniper,14,Fri May 1 02:33:43 2015 UTC,That's how you know it's a good pick.
Browns,34h1yc,foxtrot-uniform,2,Fri May 1 03:28:51 2015 UTC,I'd be open to trading him. He wants out anyway. We're not winning it all this year anyway. Get something while we can.   The only negative is we likely wouldn't get a whole lot. So I probably wouldn't.
Browns,34h1yc,SwiftBacon,5,Fri May 1 04:00:09 2015 UTC,Start at right guard this year. Then he can move over to center if Mack leaves next year.
Browns,34h1yc,djroomba322,12,Fri May 1 02:19:04 2015 UTC,shit we just got two picks right. somehow. im never the kool aid guy( check my comment history) but this is awesome
Browns,34h1yc,SwiftBacon,9,Fri May 1 02:17:31 2015 UTC,Definitely could use some depth at o-line. Plenty of good WRs in this draft
Browns,34h1yc,Nottah,-8,Fri May 1 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"You don't draft for depth in the first 20 picks.   He's probably the ""lets not fuck this up"" pick where he has the least likely chance of busting out."
Browns,34h1yc,djroomba322,11,Fri May 1 02:19:15 2015 UTC,"I meant just solid players, just so we don't have scrub replacements. I'm assuming he'll start"
Browns,34h1yc,Illinois_Jones,3,Fri May 1 02:21:53 2015 UTC,It worked out well for Dallas last year.
Browns,34h1yc,djroomba322,-1,Fri May 1 03:02:04 2015 UTC,Yeah and they had THREE impact elite weapons with a quality qb.  We have none of that.
Browns,34h1yc,themitey1,1 point,Fri May 1 08:30:07 2015 UTC,They had the best line in the league which made Romo and Murray look like mvps. Mack got hurt last year and look what happened to us
Browns,34h1yc,nofxsnap,0,Fri May 1 14:43:40 2015 UTC,We've had some of the best linemen in the NFL for years and we've been consistently the bottom.    You need impact players to make an impact.
Browns,34h1yc,Doyle524,1 point,Fri May 1 15:00:23 2015 UTC,"Most likely won't be depth.  He'll probably go to RG or RT.  Or, at the very least, preparing for Mack to take off after this season.  But I don't think that's why they drafted him.  RG or RT."
Browns,34h1yc,24rubikscube,7,Fri May 1 05:31:13 2015 UTC,We should have one of the best lines in the NFL.
Browns,34h1yc,Doyle524,1 point,Fri May 1 02:28:56 2015 UTC,"We already do, we just added a guy who should make it the best in the NFL."
Browns,34h1yc,ragar31,2,Fri May 1 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"When you have an O-line with this much talent, we better be top 10 in rushing. O-line's don't get better than this."
Browns,34h1yc,Beezer12WashingBird,2,Fri May 1 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"And with a Greco or a Schwartz on the bench, even an injury shouldn't slow us down."
Browns,34h1yc,WaffylesYay,3,Fri May 1 06:41:37 2015 UTC,"Good pick. They want to run the ball, and run it like they did before Mack got hurt. He will either start at right guard/tackle, or give good flexible depth. Sure a WR would have been nice, but the top 3 were already off the board.  No reason to reach on one."
Browns,34h1yc,TheGreatFace,2,Fri May 1 02:48:47 2015 UTC,Very interesting.

Browns,34h1yc,shuttl3s,-15,Fri May 1 02:17:05 2015 UTC,Who needs TDs anyway amirite?
Browns,34h1yc,Doyle524,9,Fri May 1 02:18:09 2015 UTC,Farmer has said he's following Seattle's plan for success. It doesn't rely on having top tier WRs. WRs just aren't that important to NFL success. Take a look at the WRs playing in the superbowl last year. I think you people play too much Madden. That's not how football works.
Browns,34h1yc,shuttl3s,0,Fri May 1 02:51:48 2015 UTC,Part of the reason our rushing D was performing badly was bc of injuries along with spending too much time on the field. They were spending too much time on the field bc Hoyer was the king of 3 and outs and our WR's could not get open to save their life.
Browns,34h1yc,Fred_Zeppelin,3,Fri May 1 02:56:36 2015 UTC,Who cares about passing offense when our run game is gonna be off the fucking charts?

Browns,34h1yc,youwithme,1 point,Fri May 1 03:35:42 2015 UTC,"Without a solid O-line, you won't score any TDs. It all starts up front."
Browns,34l2f3,dmintz,4,Sat May 2 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"Not a bad pick at all, we're going to start catching more passes in the backfield so he adds depth and a recording threat"
Browns,34l2f3,RylanTheWalrus,2,Sat May 2 02:30:01 2015 UTC,His rap game is on point.
Browns,34l2f3,farmerwouldsay,9,Sat May 2 02:55:17 2015 UTC,"Do we really need a WR this year in the 3rd round? Like who's left?   Johnson gives us HB depth and can, most importantly IMO, return kicks"
Browns,34l2f3,BMC4,4,Sat May 2 02:29:42 2015 UTC,"We need WR desperately, but you're right, there wasn't anyone available at this pick that wouldn't have been a huge risk. But I'm not sure I like taking RB here either."
Browns,34l2f3,meyer_33_09,1 point,Sat May 2 02:30:53 2015 UTC,"right obviously the board didn't dictate it at that point, but it just weird drafting a RB; even if he's great. We drafted one in the 3rd last year, plus crowell. Its a position most think isn't that important anymore and he just keeps grabbing them. I guess we are going to be a power running team. at least we have an identity."
Browns,34l2f3,LosingMyEdge7,3,Sat May 2 02:34:49 2015 UTC,Duke may be running routes as well. He looks like a third down back who could play several different positions on offense including wide receiver.
Browns,34l2f3,Nightcinder,1 point,Sat May 2 02:47:25 2015 UTC,"He's a scatback, who, if Twest or Crowell don't improve, could easily overtake one (or both) of them."
Browns,34l2f3,djroomba322,-16,Sat May 2 04:57:54 2015 UTC,This is a joke.  The reason no one is left is because they're all taken.  We had 3 fucking rounds to get something done and we couldn't get one fucking receiver?  Un-fucking-believable.
Browns,34l2f3,Beezer12WashingBird,11,Sat May 2 02:33:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's like we didn't draft a single player, Ray should have just texted a dick pick to Goodell for his pick every round."

Browns,34l2f3,Doyle524,3,Sat May 2 03:09:00 2015 UTC,"Fuck off back to your cave. We've knocked these picks out of the park. Every pick has been to remove pressure from the eventual starting QB, whether literally (Erving), by solidifying the run game (Erving and Duke), or by taking off pressure to score by forcing other teams to work harder to score (Shelton and Orchard)."
Browns,34l2f3,RylanTheWalrus,4,Sat May 2 02:37:31 2015 UTC,"How long are you gonna bum around this sub with a shit, almost troll-like attitude before you realize we don't fucking want you here?"
Browns,34l2f3,Zedress,3,Sat May 2 02:57:03 2015 UTC,We're going to run the fuck out of everyone.  It's not a surprise.
Browns,34l2f3,deputydon,1 point,Sat May 2 02:29:31 2015 UTC,"Duke already said he expects to be returning kicks, running the ball, catching out of the backfield and lining up in the slot. He's a weapon in quite a few ways. And with the exception of Shelton that filled a very specific need, its clear Farmer is going for guys that are versatile and can play multiple positions. Cooper, Erving, Orchard, and Johnson. All of them are versatile guys that fit our team well."
Browns,34insq,jswolfie316,3,Fri May 1 14:03:37 2015 UTC,I'm hoping we try to get Strong. But I can see reason behind several picks. I'm excited to see it.
Browns,34insq,Daviroth,2,Fri May 1 14:13:40 2015 UTC,"The idea is we get Smith, Strong or Williams. Strong is the best out of all of them.  Edit: Looking ahead it might be hard to grab Strong. Tennessee might look to upgrade their WR. Jags will try to grab a WR or RB, so lets hope they take Yeldon. Jets might want a WR also, Giants you never know. Rams are also in the market for a WR. Hoping that Farmer pulls the trigger and trades up to grab Strong, but who knows."
Browns,34insq,ndf1997,1 point,Fri May 1 14:27:35 2015 UTC,That's what I would like to see. Trade up the the first pick in the second round with the multitude of remaining picks we have. Grab Strong and move on to the third round.
Browns,34insq,Daviroth,1 point,Fri May 1 15:40:09 2015 UTC,Would you be willing to trade 2nd and both 4ths for Strong?
Browns,34insq,Vayporub,2,Fri May 1 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"Swap seconds with Titans plus our two fourths? I don't know, that's a lot."
Browns,34insq,Daviroth,1 point,Fri May 1 21:09:09 2015 UTC,"The cheapest we can get the Titans 2nd round pick is probably our 2nd, a 4th and a 5th."
Browns,34insq,Vayporub,1 point,Fri May 1 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"I hope we try to get Jaelen Strong. If not, get Devin Funchess. Not only is he a big bodied WR, but he's also a big bodied TE."
Browns,34insq,kuss51292,1 point,Fri May 1 14:27:41 2015 UTC,"My wants, in order: Jaelen Strong, Randy Gregory, Eric Rowe, Maxx Williams, Eric Kendricks, Denzel Perryman, or Dorial Green-Beckham.   WR, ILB, pass-rusher, Safety."
Browns,34insq,HWGBHWG,1 point,Fri May 1 14:36:19 2015 UTC,"These are the guys I think they have at the top of the board (and I wouldn't be surprised if we move up from #43 and/or end up with multiple picks in the second round):   Landon Collins Randy Gregory Owamagbe Odighizuwa Preston Smith Eli Harold   A lot of people have us targeting Strong or Williams, but I don't think either of those guys are likely and we'll be looking at DGB and Devin Smith late in the second round.  As much as I'd love to get an impact WR here, our defense would but totally nuts if we picked up Collins and one of the OLB/X guys."
Browns,34insq,TapedeckNinja,1 point,Fri May 1 14:59:04 2015 UTC,This.  My fingers are desperately crossed that Eli Harold lands in our lap.
Browns,34insq,cancerAIDSpuppies,1 point,Fri May 1 16:43:48 2015 UTC,"After sobering up this morning and looking at what we did in the first round I could not be happier. We got a true NT who is quick and a absolute beast. And we got a versatile CGT who will shore up our already amazing offensive line.m now with the rest of the draft I'd like to go after our weapons. We currently have Housler and Dray at TE. To me this years TE Draft class is weak. Williams is a late 2nd pick and Walford is a 3rd. kroft and James could possibly go late 2nd or 3rd depending on when the other 2 come off the board. With WR let's be honest we have Hartline, Hawkins, and Bowe. Hartline currently being our WR1. Currently the best WRs left on the board are Strong, DGB, and Smith. We need to go WR with our next pick then go TE in the later rounds. JFF has an amazing line to stand behind now let's get him a few more weapons and see what he does!  With the 2nd pick I like Strong or DGB with the 3rd pick I like Williams, Walford or Kroft"
Browns,34insq,_SilkyJohnson,1 point,Fri May 1 15:29:58 2015 UTC,We aren't drafting a QB until late 3rd at best
Browns,34insq,Nightcinder,1 point,Fri May 1 16:01:07 2015 UTC,I'll honestly be surprised if we draft a QB at all.  We'll be first out of the gate to snag someone as an UDFA to compete.  I just don't see us wasting a second day pick on someone who is at best a lateral move compared to what we already have.
Browns,34insq,cancerAIDSpuppies,1 point,Fri May 1 16:46:52 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Grayson or, to a lesser extent, Petty come in to replace Shaw (because I don't think the guy will ever be more than a warm body at the position)."
Browns,34insq,TapedeckNinja,1 point,Fri May 1 17:07:06 2015 UTC,Sure.  But you don't spend a third round pick to replace the 3rd or 4th guy on your depth chart.  Not when you could pick up very solid rotational/fringe starting guys at dline or LB there or possibly get a longer term solution at TE.  Grayson is intriguing but there's 3 or 4 prospects like him in every draft.
Browns,34insq,cancerAIDSpuppies,1 point,Fri May 1 17:46:02 2015 UTC,I'm guessing move up for Strong with 2nd and both 4ths.  3rd round quarterback? I think we also need to look for a kicker in the late rounds.
Browns,34insq,Vayporub,1 point,Fri May 1 16:47:46 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it'll end up being Devin smith. Which I'm totally fine with.

Browns,34gpem,SaintDemure,1 point,Fri May 1 02:25:52 2015 UTC,I think he's really going to struggle in Tennessee. I don't feel they were the best fit for MM.

Browns,34gpem,miked1be,3,Fri May 1 03:43:36 2015 UTC,At this point I think he's better than Mariota and no other picks in this or the next first round and possibly second.  Comparing Manziel to Mariota in this case is an intentional fallacy and nothing more.
Browns,34ha99,BMC4,8,Fri May 1 03:30:57 2015 UTC,"in other news, i just flipped on sportscenter for the first time in a long time. what are they doing? they are covering draftee fashion. not even as a joke. my god.  perhaps ill turn on espn again in another few years. eventually, it has to stop getting worse, right?"
Browns,34ha99,stampylives,5,Fri May 1 05:47:38 2015 UTC,they are covering draftee fashion   that being said i give Shelton and A+++ sticking to his roots.
Browns,34ha99,moodyfloyd,3,Fri May 1 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"i think we did great. I'd give Shelton an A as he will probably be an immediate impact player, and the Erving pick a B+. He might not start from the get go, but we have a good option if Mack opts out.   I'd love to see us get Jaelen Strong in Round 2, maybe even trade up to get him"
Browns,34ha99,farmerwouldsay,8,Fri May 1 03:38:59 2015 UTC,"Erving can play all over the line. He was who I was hoping we would take and I couldn't believe we actually did. I'm in the minority on this sub when it comes to WR, I don't see the point in spending a weekday pick on one until we are solid at QB."
Browns,34ha99,Daviroth,5,Fri May 1 03:42:38 2015 UTC,"I say we try to get Erving into RG. Let Greco (who is known for being good at all interior line positions) train as interior line depth. Greco is an above average RG in the league, as interior line depth he will be one of the best. If Erving works out half as well as Bitonio did we arguably will have the best line in the NFL."
Browns,34ha99,farmerwouldsay,1 point,Fri May 1 04:29:03 2015 UTC,I think that is a good idea. I really do see him being the ultimate utility guy and not necessarily being a starter but filling and subbing in anywhere when needed. That is a seriously underrated type of player to have on a roster.
Browns,34ha99,Daviroth,2,Fri May 1 04:34:58 2015 UTC,Greco would be great at it as well. He can play RG/LG/C all pretty well. If we didn't have swiss cheese for a backup RG he would've played C when Mack went down. Turns out we had swiss cheese for a backup C too.
Browns,34ha99,farmerwouldsay,2,Fri May 1 06:27:32 2015 UTC,"I like Greco a lot, plus he is a hometown guy (kind of). I'm just really pleased with the first round so far."
Browns,34ha99,Peninj,2,Fri May 1 06:32:35 2015 UTC,"While I agree, you need the utility lineman to play all the positions. I just don't think you draft that in the first round. If that's what he turns out to be...fine... but not a well spent pick.   I heard a rumor they were going to play him at right tackle and keep Greco at right guard and have Schwartz be utility man. Giving us a line of: Thomas, Bitonio, Mack, Greco, Erving... WOW, that looks nice."
Browns,34ha99,farmerwouldsay,1 point,Fri May 1 11:35:36 2015 UTC,"If that is the plan, then fine. Still doesn't change his value and there are a lot of team that would love a gut that can fill in anywhere on the line. Maybe it's a safe pick, but it's still a safe pick for $2mil a year."
Browns,34ha99,wakaOH05,1 point,Fri May 1 11:38:32 2015 UTC,You've got to admit though it's hard to mold a QB into a real threat without any tools to work with.

Browns,34ha99,wakaOH05,1 point,Fri May 1 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"Kaepernic, and Brady between Super Bowls come to mind at the moment. I also think Kaepernic is a good example for a comparable QB. Unknown, apparently super talented, but not much to work with team wise. [edit] err, not comparable to our QBs but the kind of situation seemed the most relatable.  I will always give in to the argument that a QB lives and dies by his line though. For sure."
Browns,34ha99,mceppy,3,Sat May 2 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"I will admit I haven't followed this draft as much as others. But when they were introducing all the players, when they got to Danny Shelton, I thought to myself, I really like that guy. Just a beast of a dude that's having a good time"
Browns,34ha99,MidsizeGorilla,3,Fri May 1 04:07:52 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but you guys did really well. I was sure your front office would make some stupid pick and get laughed at again, but this is what smart teams do. Build in the trenches. Good job Browns, for real"
Browns,34ha99,Fred_Zeppelin,3,Fri May 1 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"What letter grade would you give our first round draft picks?   A. Really. 32nd against the run, so Shelton was a must. Erving should upgrade the right side of the line.   Do you think either of our picks will be day 1 starters?   Yes, I expect both of them will be.   What should our Browns do on Day 2?   Like everyone else I'd like a WR, but I'm not holding my breath. I also wouldn't mind a tackle to compete with Schwartz, but not sure who. Another DL, or an OLB would also be nice.  Edit: forgot about a TE. We need one of those too."
Browns,34ha99,subhuman1,3,Fri May 1 14:00:42 2015 UTC,Solid B-B+. I love building from the inside out on both sides. But at the same time we probably picked both guys 5-10 picks sooner than they would have gone if we didn't have glaring needs.  Goldman is a better run stopper than Shelton. And Erving was projected LATE 1st round/early 2nd by many experts.    Solid first round with both picks having HIGH floors. After last year...I'm glad we played it safe.  NOW----2-11?  GRegory?

Browns,34iazw,ratcw73,6,Fri May 1 11:57:50 2015 UTC,"I fully expect us to move up from 43 while first round talent is still on the board.  We have the picks to move up, and there are much better players than Williams available in the next few picks."

Browns,34iazw,TapedeckNinja,1 point,Fri May 1 14:41:22 2015 UTC,"Well, my outside information - CBS' Dane Brugler - noted that the Browns had a formal meeting with Maxx Williams at the combine. Before Cameron was gone, and before Housler was signed, of course. We'll see how tonight goes, I guess."
Browns,34iazw,HWGBHWG,2,Fri May 1 15:22:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, and the rumor is that a lot of teams who sat down with Williams came away with concerns about his attitude.  We shall see."
Browns,34iazw,TapedeckNinja,1 point,Fri May 1 15:25:04 2015 UTC,"The knock is he has a ""me-first"" attitude, from what I've read. I think 90% of the NFL has a me-first attitude, so it's not something I'm too worried about. I'm more worried about him needing to put on 10-15 lbs"
Browns,34iazw,HWGBHWG,1 point,Fri May 1 16:28:32 2015 UTC,"If we trade up for Strong, I'd be elated. I think my second favorite outcome is Maxx and then a pure DE."

Browns,34f59u,eleven21,43,Thu Apr 30 17:41:38 2015 UTC,"I've had some brutal battles here too, but this will always be my home. I have arguments here, I fight wars in /r/NFL.  It's like I said yesterday, I'm just aggressively optimistic. Maybe I take things a little too seriously, but goddammit I love my team and seeing them treated like a laughingstock just makes me see red.  I fucking love you guys. Let's kill it tonight."
Browns,34f59u,Execrat0r,11,Thu Apr 30 17:52:22 2015 UTC,It's nice to see some other optimistic Browns fans like myself. Keep fighting the good fight! BROWNS!
Browns,34f59u,chubby_prince,8,Thu Apr 30 18:11:24 2015 UTC,Count me in your corner.  This year the Browns win it all.  Go BROWNS!
Browns,34f59u,demolitio4,2,Thu Apr 30 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"I'm optimistic as well. I won't say we'll win it all though, but I wouldn't say that regardless out of fear of jinxing it...lol.  I wouldn't necessarily say I'm optimistic, just level-headed compared to most who act like the world is burning. The FO has made mistakes, lots of them, but that doesn't mean we aren't getting better. To continuously get shit on by people that care more about the drama than the actual game on /r/nfl doesn't mean a thing to me. I'm hear to talk football and enjoy being around other fans.   I make jokes about the Browns in the real world every once in a while, but it gets old constantly hearing the same old shit and seeing supposed Browns fans say the same old shit just to get some approval from people that rather make jokes than talk football."
Browns,34f59u,SwiftBacon,5,Fri May 1 06:59:20 2015 UTC,Thank you! I hate seeing browns flairs making fun of the team for easy karma

Browns,34h4pz,huber14,1 point,Fri May 1 03:15:40 2015 UTC,"Especially in this division where power running is key. Every other team can rely on their rushing when they need to and that helps create more plays for QB. We started off strong in rushing last year until that fateful day and then our offense completely folded because we relied on play-actions a lot as well and that doesn't work out when they know you're struggling to run...lol.  I'm hoping our new offense is finally what we've been waiting for. Time to impose their will on their enemies. Run the ball even when they know it's coming because they can't stop you. When that comes, so does the passing game, especially with an inexperienced QB.   The Bengals OC, Hue Jackson, just said something similar and how running the ball is how you win. Jay Gruden relied on Dalton too much and it hurt them, but once Jackson took over and committed more and more to rushing, it made Dalton look better because it gave him options. Of course, they really lost a lot of faith in him to the point where they were mostly short dump passes, but that can work too.   Shit. I've been living in Cincinnati too long now when I can reference their shit here. But it's true, win in the trenches playing physical football and the rest will follow, and from there, we can build a good offense."

Browns,34j7zm,ClevelandFrowns,2,Fri May 1 16:45:04 2015 UTC,"When the Packers drafted 6-foot-1, 337 pound B.J. Raji in 2009, their GM Ted Thompson said, ""the good Lord just didn't make many people like this."" Two seasons later the Packers beat the Steelers in the Super Bowl with Raji anchoring the defense.  Last night, the Browns took 6-foot-2, 340 pound defensive tackle Danny Shelton out of the University of Washington and everyone should be able to set aside disagreements about who or what made people to agree that he, she or it just didn't make many like Shelton, either.  But anyway, this is as good as I've felt about a Browns first round since 2007. Wrote a bit about why. Thanks for reading."

Browns,34i0ta,-Ahab-,8,Fri May 1 09:27:55 2015 UTC,"Drafting a WR in the 1st or even 2nd or 3rd is like buying rims and a spoiler for your 4 cylinder Honda Civic. Until we have a solid QB, why invest heavily in a WR that could just go to waste in an anemic offense? Build the lines and get the running game going, and wait for a QB that can 100% run the offense, then build up his tools."
Browns,34i0ta,farmerwouldsay,4,Fri May 1 09:45:05 2015 UTC,"You do make a good argument. I've always been a ""Line makes the team"" kind of guy, but I was really disappointed we didn't come away with Parker."
Browns,34i0ta,farmerwouldsay,2,Fri May 1 09:59:06 2015 UTC,I just feel like this is the draft to get our foundation is shape and then next year go get our finishing touches.
Browns,34i0ta,Godszn,2,Fri May 1 10:07:30 2015 UTC,"I feel that if we get Strong today, then we got ourselves a QUALITY WR"
Browns,34i0ta,meyer_33_09,2,Fri May 1 11:12:02 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm pretty high on Strong and was a little surprised he dropped outside of the first round.
Browns,34i0ta,djroomba322,-1,Fri May 1 12:06:07 2015 UTC,"The main reason to draft a WR is to give your QB some help.  Right now we have no outside threat, no one that commands a double team.  That means that even average corners can live just fine on an island, the safeties can run blitz more and you'll see our run game get less and less opportunities for plays.  Since our QBs are notoriously poor, they won't be able to exploit this 1 on 1 coverage with average at best weapons, both WRs and TEs.    Getting receivers isn't buying rims and a spoiler on a civic.  We don't have a civic.  We have a car with a pretty good engine already in our previous offensive line.  You put a 16 year old in a car with shitty bald tires, your going to have to make him drive even more precisely when it starts raining or he's going to kill us all.    I'm fine with shelton.  Whatever.  Its fine.  But we already have so much invested in our oline.  The whole reason Mack would be leaving is because we're not competitive.  We can actually KEEP MACK if we try to win games.  Do I think Erving is going to be a good player?  Sure.  Do I think he's going to make a signicant impact way more than whoever he's replacing this year?  Not significantly.   Like I said before, its a safe pick.  Its a keep your jobs pick. Its almost impossible to screw up an offensive line pick in the first round.  If they go get a receiver or someone else, and they look bad, they're done."
Browns,34i0ta,themitey1,3,Fri May 1 11:56:51 2015 UTC,"If Erving is anywhere near as good as Bitonio, then it IS a significant upgrade over our RG or RT.  It's not like there aren't quality WR's left in the draft.  I'm VERY high on Strong, and will be ecstatic if we land him in the 2nd, who was also commonly projected to us at 19.  I also wouldn't be opposed to DGB, though a bit riskier due to Josh Gordon-like tendencies.  It's not all lost hope in WR weapons, my pessimistic redditor.  ;)"
Browns,34i0ta,djroomba322,0,Fri May 1 12:13:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're even disagreeing on this.  We have to get Strong or DGB.  Honestly we need Max Williams too. Dray and Barnidge are fine at what they do, but they aren't that heavy receiving threat which we dearly need at the position. And Housler is a project.  We have 8 picks and we definitely need to get at least 2 offensive weapons in the 2nd and 3rd at the latest, you would agree?"
Browns,34i0ta,themitey1,2,Fri May 1 12:33:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I would say at least 1.  I'm not as high on Max Williams as I used to be.  Mainly due to some articles like these:  http://dawgpounddaily.com/2015/04/08/te-maxx-williams-attitude-problem-nfl-draft-fall/  I could easily see him not being ""happy"" he's coming here, and then just not performing as well as he could.  I'm sure we will pick up a TE at some point this draft, just not the top one.  Or maybe we'll see what we can do to acquire Bennett from the Bears.  I could also see us moving up in the 2nd to maybe have 2 picks in the round.  There's a lot of options left is all I'm really saying.  :)"
Browns,34i0ta,Daviroth,2,Fri May 1 12:44:49 2015 UTC,"I'm super high on getting Bennett from the Bears. Dude can be really good, and there is no way he would cost us much to acquire either."
Browns,34i0ta,bgrueyw,1 point,Fri May 1 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"The biggest knock on Strong is that he has difficulty getting open. A raw route runner, and his 40 time is faster than his play speed right now. But because he is 6ft 3in with a 40 inch vertical, there are many plays in which he can be thrown open, but I'm not sure a WR like that  is someone you want with mediocre QBs."
Browns,34i0ta,TapedeckNinja,2,Fri May 1 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on how you graded each of the units on the Browns last year.  If you listened to the Farmer presser last night, he basically said: I didn't see us lose games because our receivers couldn't get the job done but I did see us lose games because we couldn't block effectively.  That's probably a bad paraphrase, but nonetheless, that's Farmer's reasoning for going OL over WR."
Browns,34i0ta,Daviroth,2,Fri May 1 13:25:04 2015 UTC,And he ain't wrong. That's a very fair assessment.
Browns,34i0ta,bowhunter6274,3,Fri May 1 14:01:00 2015 UTC,Here's where I'm at. We needed to address the poor run defense we had last year and Shelton can definitely make a difference up front.   Erving is an insurance pick in case Mack walks next year which I think is likely. He can also play RT if neded and that can be a very good thing.   Overall I'm happy.
Browns,34i0ta,d-a-f-f-y,3,Fri May 1 11:00:05 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with what we did in round one. I'd have been happy with a receiver in one slot, but if we stuck to our board, then it's OK. We got a guy who can help our rush defense be not one of the worst in the league. And we got a versatile offensive lineman. Already some speculation they took him not only to upgrade the right side of our line, but as an insurance policy against a Mack injury, or if he should opt out after the season."
Browns,34i0ta,Fakespeedbump,2,Fri May 1 11:12:33 2015 UTC,They didn't draft a receiver because the right one wasn't available when they were picking. There's no sense in reaching for a receiver when there's another guy that will help the team more (according to their evaluations). They're fully aware that they need a receiver but it just didn't work out this round. Hopefully one will fall into place in the second round.
Browns,34i0ta,djroomba322,-1,Fri May 1 10:51:37 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely no one that comes remotely close to Parker left in terms of raw talent.  There are a few guys who have similar bodies, but have much bigger question marks. I don't really see what everyone sees in Strong.  And don't get me started on Buckeye-colored glasses on Smith.    We have to get a receiver though.  And a TE.  We just have to.  We don't even have anyone of prototypical size that we're even developing right now.   We have 8 picks left, and we're not bringing 10 rookies in, so we need to move up and get some offensive talent and fast."
Browns,34i0ta,Fakespeedbump,1 point,Fri May 1 12:10:44 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing that we need a receiver, just saying that Parker didn't work out. Tough."
Browns,34i0ta,djroomba322,0,Fri May 1 12:18:51 2015 UTC,"Well, he did work out.  We passed on him.   And the Dolphins got him dropped into their laps."
Browns,34i0ta,Fakespeedbump,2,Fri May 1 12:20:42 2015 UTC,Oh I was referring to #19. I'm totally ok that we passed on Parker at #12. I think Shelton was an excellent decision.
Browns,34i0ta,Oskie5272,1 point,Fri May 1 12:33:11 2015 UTC,"What's your problem with Smith out of curiosity? There's concern about him not being able to run routes that aren't deep routes, but honestly we don't know if that's a very valid concern since that's not what he was asked to do. He lead the country in ypc and would provide the deep threat the team needs. I wouldn't take him in the first, but I'm completely fine with a second round pick"
Browns,34i0ta,topper_mango,2,Fri May 1 14:24:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Erving fills a bigger need on the team than any wide receiver.  For all we have invested in the line, we really have no quality depth.  To have someone who can play multiple positions at a (presumably) high level goes a long way toward avoiding what happened last season when Mack went down.  Erving is insurance at every position on the line, and an immediate upgrade over Greco and perhaps even Schwartz."
Browns,34i0ta,meyer_33_09,1 point,Fri May 1 12:30:02 2015 UTC,"Shelton was the right choice at 12, and the receivers available at 19 were a bit of a stretch in my opinion. There will be plenty of talented WRs available in the next round or two."
Browns,34l2fg,charbo187,11,Sat May 2 02:28:05 2015 UTC,"I picture this guy as Flip's wildcard. Lining up at receiver, back, tight end and whatever. Much like he did with Reece in Oakland"

Browns,34l2fg,holdemtexas,8,Sat May 2 03:12:02 2015 UTC,WRs just aren't important. I don't know why more people don't understand this. Too much Madden on the xbox maybe? Would you people be bitching if we didn't draft a punter in the 2nd round? WRs don't win you championships. How many superstar receivers were there in the last superbowl?  A great QB can make even bad receivers look like pro-bowlers. Having 3 hall of fame WRs at their peak isn't going to get you to the superbowl if your QB is Brandon Weeden.
Browns,34l2fg,Doyle524,5,Sat May 2 02:32:39 2015 UTC,A great defense and running game can make any team look like a playoff team. That's what we're going for. I'm pumped.
Browns,34l2fg,djroomba322,-7,Sat May 2 02:35:13 2015 UTC,"Are you fucking joking?  Like, you have to be kidding.  Wide receivers are incredibly important in a passing league.  I'm honestly not even sure what you're watching.    The pats didn't have a single guy over 400 yards rushing.  They had THREE receivers over 900 yards.  Receivers aren't important.  Right.   In a passing league where every team that made the fucking playoffs either had an elite or top tier receiving corps, receivers aren't important.  We're not trying to get 3 hall of fame receivers, we just need some good ones.  You know, ones you get in the 2nd and 3rd round.  Funny how the pats go from good to unbelievable when they get their 1 good receiver and go 18-1.  Funny huh?  Go be an apologize for this shit GM if that helps you sleep at night.  I can already see the narrative that's going to have to be rewritten in here to make up for his bullshit until he's finally fired and then you can all go ""but we said all along blah blah blah""."
Browns,34l2fg,CaptainSweater,5,Sat May 2 02:39:05 2015 UTC,The Pats have Tom Brady as their Quarterback. How is that a fair comparison? Why would they be run oriented with him on the team?
Browns,34l2fg,djroomba322,-4,Sat May 2 02:43:13 2015 UTC,"This dude says that receivers aren't important.  They obviously are.  Broncos have great weapons and won their division. The Bengals have great weapons and made the playoffs.  The steelers have great weaposn and made the playoffs.  The Ravens have great weaposn and made the playoffs.  Panthers do too.  And the colts.  And the cowboys.  And the lions.    Guess what.  Every single fucking playoff team had great wide receivers.  coincidence?   And you'll say ""But but but Seattle doesn't!"" Bull fucking shit.  Baldwin is good.  And do you know what they did?  THEY FUCKING WENT OUT AND GOT GRAHAM.  If your argument is you cant say a team has good receivers because they have a good quarterback, then it doesn't fucking matter what any player is until you get a QB so we do we give a fuck about any other player?"
Browns,34l2fg,Beezer12WashingBird,4,Sat May 2 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"I got it, hear me out. We should just only draft WRs. If we put 22 WRs on the field we will have the league's best receiving core. We have to win that way. Every good GM knows WR is the only position worth using. If only we could get Ozzie Newsome, he would understand. Do you think he would trade 20 WRs for himself. Hes a great GM he can't pass up a good trade, like that fool Ray Farmer would."
Browns,34l2fg,nytro330,4,Sat May 2 02:53:41 2015 UTC,"Who pissed in your cereal, seriously.   I'd understand being upset if we were running an air raid style offense or something where it's 70/30 pass/run. But we're not. Our offense is based around the ZBS and running the fuck out of the ball. As well as defense and controlling the pace of play through the trenches on both sides of the ball. Our receivers are not going to be called upon to do that much.   If receiver was our only hole, I'd agree. But dude, come the fuck on, our run defense was terrible. Our pass rush was terrible, our O-Line wasn't good at all when Mack went down. These lost us games. When Josh Gordon came back, guess what. We still fucking lost games. Our glaring defensive holes don't go away just because we put Dez Bryant out there. We went out and got Bowe and Hartline, who aren't anywhere near elite, but they'll suffice for now. Which draft pick do we change to fill a hole we already filled for the time being through free agency? Which wide receiver is going to come in the 2nd or 3rd round and change our offense better than a quick RB who can catch?   Also, our offense was always made to run 3 running backs. If Ben Tate wasn't a giant asshole last season we could've seen it in full motion. Now we also get desperately needed return help as well."
Browns,34l2fg,djroomba322,-3,Sat May 2 03:02:31 2015 UTC,"Josh Gordon came back and half assed his entire routes.  Did you watch the game? He didn't even fucking try.  That's one reason he was benched.    That is the fucking reason we need more goddamn receivers.   Like, are you for real?   Bowe is old and has bad hands. Hartline is a 2 who had PCL surgery and has lost a step.  I can't even believe I have to say this. I don't know, why don't we not DRAFT THE DEPTH OLINEMAN IN THE FIRST FUCKING ROUND?  Or I don't know, our THIRD FUCKING RUNNING BACK?  You just said it yourself.  Mack went down and our line got bad.  So what we had was good.  So you want to improve on a part of our team you already said is good instead of getting an impact weapon when we have zero.  Our offense this year isn't.  Our offense this year is based around a receiving TE said our OC.  Which we also still don't have.  Holy fuck."
Browns,34l2fg,nytro330,2,Sat May 2 03:04:25 2015 UTC,"We didn't draft for depth, we drafted him because   A) He can play all O-Line positions and can be an upgrade over Schwartz or Greco  B) When Mack packs his bags and leaves next year we aren't reaching or hitting the panic button to draft a center. The kid's talented and will fit extremely well here.   Again, you can't have it both ways. Which receiver do we take at 19 over Erving that isn't a reach? Perriman? The guy with drop issues? Do I really need to explain why his drop rate is an issue?"

Browns,34l2fg,SoulSerpent,1 point,Sat May 2 09:26:46 2015 UTC,There were about 0 top-tier receivers in the Super Bowl this year.
Browns,34l2fg,djroomba322,0,Sat May 2 13:08:51 2015 UTC,Yeah and there were no first round centers either.  Guess center is overrated.  And there was only 1 first round cb for both teams.  Guess cornerback is over rated too?  Richard Sherman was drafted in the 5th round.  So we should only draft CBs in the 5th round in your logic?
Browns,34l2fg,SoulSerpent,2,Sat May 2 13:53:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, by ""top-tier"" I didn't mean ""first-round picks."" I meant look at the receivers in the big game, and there aren't any CJs or Dez Bryants. By ""top-tier,"" I meant elite receivers, wherever they were taken in the draft. Both teams had pretty low-key receiving corps, with Brandon LaFell and Doug Baldwin being pretty much the most talented receivers there. Go back a few years, and very few teams are winning Super Bowls because of star wide outs. In other words, if you've got a solid team, you can do just fine with serviceable, but not great, receivers. That's all I'm saying.  You make a good point, though, that both the teams in the Owl this year had less than average centers (although Unger was pretty good in the run game). But right now, our O Line is kind of our ""thing."" We've got one of the best in the league, and everyone saw what a difference it was to our team when Mack went down. I've got no quibbles with the choice of Erving. If I'm disappointed, it's because the receivers I was rooting for had been taken already. With what was left, I think Erving is a good pick. He can immediately bolster the offensive line and he's great protection in the event that Mack gets re-injured or bolts. It puts us in a position to build out the remaining skill positions in future free agency and draft periods."
Browns,34l2fg,Beezer12WashingBird,3,Sat May 2 14:04:38 2015 UTC,"Hey guys he's right, everyone knows every good wide receiver is selected in the first 3 rounds. Let's grab our pitch forks and run this so-called ""General Manager"" Ray Farmer guy out of the league. I bet at a minimum we could keep him from the team for at least 4 weeks."
Browns,34l2fg,holdemtexas,3,Sat May 2 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"Are you fucking joking? Like, you have to be kidding.   Tell me, how did we do with the best WR in the game in 2013? How have the Lions done with having arguably the best WR since Jerry Rice? How many superstar receivers were there in the last few superbowls?  Once you answer those questions, then you'll know if I'm joking.   They had THREE receivers over 900 yards.   And yet, none of them superstars. A QB makes the receivers, not the other way around."

Browns,34l2fg,themitey1,4,Sat May 2 02:31:54 2015 UTC,Guys. Seriously. Get over it.  Ray Farmer literally told us last night that he didn't see WR as an urgent need.  Feel free to disagree with him but stop acting surprised when he passes on a receiver.

Browns,34hc1r,sil0,2,Fri May 1 03:51:02 2015 UTC,One thing to I'd highly suggest is to wrap each bottle in a plastic gallon bag before you wrap it in bubble wrap this way in case a bottle breaks that it's contained within the bag and doesn't damage the shipping box so that wont get returned to you. I learned that the hard way.

If I recall they took Shane Ray off the draft board when he got arrested.   Farmer also seems pretty committed to not drafting WRs for some reason. We might see one in the 2nd round but it won't be DGB.
Browns,34ha2b,egg_s,5,Fri May 1 03:30:41 2015 UTC,"It's a QB situation.  He wont start getting quality receivers until he has a quality QB. You don't trick out a Chevette with pipes and rims. Wait until we have a Bently, or at least a Pontiac, before we start trickin' it out."

Browns,34ikgh,themitey1,3,Fri May 1 13:55:04 2015 UTC,He can wave that though if its the right team
Browns,34ikgh,rufus418,2,Fri May 1 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"Heh, well I suppose it might be an option to him.  But we can't force it."
Browns,34ikgh,themitey1,3,Fri May 1 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"Outside of Mack having the no trade clause that /u/joe_incognito already brought up there is another problem. In order to convince Mack to not opt out we would have to promise to trade him to a team of his choosing and do it before the deadline. I would assume the teams of his choosing are not gonna be in a position to get us a QB of the future.   But I guess any first rounder helps, in the end I think it's a long shot. Mack would rather just opt out and take a deal anywhere he wants than trust that the Browns move him to a team he wants. It would require a lot of trust and respect from Mack, who (if he actually leaves) obviously doesn't have in the organization. In that way, it's a little far fetched."
Browns,34ikgh,Daviroth,1 point,Fri May 1 13:56:21 2015 UTC,"He tried to sign with the Dolphins last year (when they looked much worse then they do now), so I don't think he cares too much about winning. I know this sounds weird since he was trying to leave here, but maybe he wants stability.  I just pray that he'll like this season enough to stay. He won't get much more money anywhere else."
Browns,34ikgh,bearsdriving,2,Fri May 1 14:43:05 2015 UTC,I agree with you completely.

Browns,34ikgh,Nightcinder,1 point,Fri May 1 16:03:30 2015 UTC,And Mack has absolutely zero reason to help us out when he can just hit free agency (and assuming he bounces back from injury) get a fat contract on the team of his choosing.
Browns,34ikgh,joe_incognito,1 point,Fri May 1 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair. He ain't gonna make much more money than he is now. He has his fat contract right now, he miiiight get a million or two more a year but is already being paid as the top center in the league."
Browns,34ikgh,Daviroth,1 point,Fri May 1 14:10:09 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, he would leave to go win somewhere else.  So, if we succeed this year, he stays.  If we don't, he leaves.  I don't think it's about money."
Browns,34ikgh,themitey1,2,Fri May 1 14:52:30 2015 UTC,I see it that way too. Which is why he wouldn't want to be a trading piece for us to get a franchise QB in the top of the draft next year. Going to a team at the top of the draft is not winning.
Browns,34ikgh,Daviroth,-1,Fri May 1 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he explicitly added the opt out clause so he could choose where he goes next year.  Why in the world would he help us out for probably less money to a destination he doesn't want to go to?"
Browns,34ikgh,djroomba322,1 point,Fri May 1 14:09:48 2015 UTC,"We would have to be in the top 5 to get the qb of our choice in the 2016. If we have an average season, well probably have to give up a ton of future picks to move up and get the QB of the future."
Browns,34ikgh,kuss51292,1 point,Fri May 1 13:44:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think drafting Erving automatically means we should write-off Mack. Also, I haven't given up on Manziel just yet. JT is not known to shovel bullshit, so if JT says he's a different guy this year, I tend to believe him."

Browns,34f61d,msmouse05,3,Thu Apr 30 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"If he did actually tell him that, then they won't trade for him. Whatever source this is from could just be wrong."
Browns,34f61d,blackedout,3,Thu Apr 30 17:14:43 2015 UTC,Condon represented Tim Couch and a few more of the 22 IIRC. He really hates our organization.
Browns,34f61d,Daviroth,2,Thu Apr 30 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"Everyone says Bradford is telling that to any teams. He doesn't want to sign an extension because he will make a hell of a lot more money (from anyone) if he can stay on the field for 16 games, AND play well."
Browns,34f61d,alexunderwater,2,Thu Apr 30 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, it sounds like he doesn't want a contract extension from anyone because he knows it would be at a huge discount if he pans out and plays up to expectations.  He wants to have a year-long contract wherever he goes so he can prove his talent (and health) and get bigger money next year.  If he signs a 5 year deal now and ends up being the starter somewhere for that whole time, he'd be losing out on a bunch of money."
Browns,34f61d,droidworkerbee,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:40:22 2015 UTC,I understand this 100%.  It's the arguement I make when talking about Kevin Love on him opt in/out with the Cavs.  I'm just confused as to why people are talking about this when this is general knowledge.  Hes not resigning with anyone until after the year.  We all know we have no chance to resign him regardless.  This basic information should nip the rumor right in the butt.

That brewery is interesting, the owners are a husband and wife and I think her brother.  The husband and wife are literal rocket scientists that started brewing on the weekends, having our running/drinking club try it for like 2 years, then started selling it.  When I first saw it in a bar they were still just brewing on the weekends and they eventually couldn't keep up with demand and do it full time now.  A couple friends of mine are investors with them."
Browns,34ftwk,ccavana3,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:42:57 2015 UTC,That just gives me more reason to save it.  EDIT: Just finished the More Cowbell dbl IPA. Holy shit. So malty and heavier than I expected. I was expecting high hops. Absolutely fantastic.

Browns,34g12v,miked1be,3,Thu Apr 30 21:18:29 2015 UTC,I think it's more about him getting picked in a round he's more deserving of since by the supplemental draft his people are expecting him to be fully cleared instead of having a question mark above his head.  If they're expecting him to be convicted waiting for the supplemental draft won't help much unless they're talking about wanting to wait for the 2060 supplemental draft or perhaps afterlife supplemental draft.
Browns,34g12v,moodyfloyd,3,Thu Apr 30 21:54:21 2015 UTC,exactly. this will probably cost him millions of dollars.
Browns,34g12v,supaloco,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard it's more about the custody of the child he and the woman shared. The misconception could make him a steal.

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if NFL teams knew this and he was taken in the first few rounds."

Browns,34ee9c,Fred_Zeppelin,2,Thu Apr 30 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"At this point, I feel like TEN has to either pick Mariota or trade. Passing on him when they (reportedly) could garner quite a bounty of draft picks + players in return wouldn't make much sense."
Browns,34ee9c,ArcadeNineFire,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:11:49 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm not sure that even a guy like Leonard Williams is valuable enough for them to pass on the returns they could get by trading out of #2.
Browns,34ee9c,meyer_33_09,2,Thu Apr 30 15:58:55 2015 UTC,I'm going with 5% chance. I will say that 5% isn't Marcus Mariota.
Browns,34ee9c,n813,2,Thu Apr 30 20:11:28 2015 UTC,Seems like Chip is packaging his defense for sale. I'd poach the hell out of Fletcher Cox as well as several picks from him.
Browns,34ee9c,blackedout,2,Thu Apr 30 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"I really hope it is ZERO.... we have the ability to make our defense even more solid, shore up our OLine, and add a WR and a TE. I just really hope we don't walk home with Bradford"
Browns,34ee9c,_SilkyJohnson,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"I really, really don't think we are drafting a QB tonight but I could be surprised and then depressed. I'd put it at 25%"
Browns,34ee9c,Dean_Craig_Pelton,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:58:25 2015 UTC,Eh.  25% chance.  I feel like I'm high on that number too.
Browns,34ee9c,themitey1,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:50:03 2015 UTC,8%

Browns,34ee9c,msmouse05,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:54:22 2015 UTC,Hopefully it's 5%.
Browns,34ee9c,tahubob,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"20% for tonight, 95% by end of draft"
Browns,34ee9c,newsballs,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:03:51 2015 UTC,60% of the time it works every time.
Browns,34ee9c,TheMightyCupcake,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:10:25 2015 UTC,"30%.  And if we end up with a new QB tonight, 75% chance it's Bradford.  And unless he's re-signing, we better be getting a SHIT TON more than just him for a 1st rounder."
Browns,34ee9c,wardsac,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:33:36 2015 UTC,"66% - The Bradford rumor has gained a lot of traction in the last few days. I know that it is the day of the draft, and the BS train is full steam ahead, but sometimes these rumors are an indication of something in the works. I have a hard time believing that the Browns front office and coaching staff are sold on any of the QBs we have on our roster now to lead us into next season. That has to mean that you get a QB in the draft or via trade IF you think the right one is there for a price you are willing to pay. Is Bradford worth a #12 if he can come in and be a starter and stay healthy? Probably, but the health concerns are real and make it a big gamble.  I do think that if we end the draft without a QB we will look to make some type of other move after the draft to get another potential starter on our roster. I think McCown was insurance and is probably not slated to be our actual opening-day QB. But, of course, this is all speculation and my opinion.  BROWNS!"
Browns,34ee9c,File_Peter,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:36:45 2015 UTC,50/50 that we pick up Bryce Petty.  (Probably not a popular opinion.)
Browns,34ee9c,NoMagic,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:47:45 2015 UTC,"Really hope that doesn't happen tonight, means we'd spend a first rounder on him."
Browns,34ee9c,miked1be,-1,Thu Apr 30 14:48:42 2015 UTC,"Think of it as insurance. Why waste double the time getting a long-time starter in the mix if Johnny Addiction washes out?  No way Connor Shaw will develop into an NFL starter (as much as I really really like the guy) because of his obvious lack of arm strength, and the 2 free agents are nicely serviceable backups at best, but don't seem capable of taking it to the next level.  Putting all our money on Manziel, considering his personal situation, could waste years if he washes out of recovery."
Browns,34ee9c,NoMagic,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:02:11 2015 UTC,Huh?  You're saying you want Bryce Petty in the first round as insurance?
Browns,34ee9c,miked1be,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:21:12 2015 UTC,Yup.
Browns,34ee9c,NoMagic,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"If you are an OBR Insider, the Browns are as interested in trading up for MM as any other option they are really considering in the draft.  The catch is, its a complete non-starter to trade up with Tenn for what they are asking. 12 and 19 sure, but 3 firsts and a player? Nope.  Now if MM slides past #2 things will get interesting. If he is there at 4..."
Browns,34ee9c,Raunchyfarts,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"My gut says 0% but the draft is so crazy I'll give 15%.  My reasoning? Realistically there are only two QBs I think we would take a shot at, Bradford or Mariota. With the QB chart we have taking a project QB in any of the later rounds just doesn't seem to make much sense to me.  Why wouldn't we take Bradford? Because he's unwilling to sign an extension with any team but the eagles (his words). There's no future there with him and that doesn't strike me as the kind of move Farmer would make.  Why not Mariota? Pettine and Farmer have both said drafting him would be tantamount to giving up on JFF. And based on their actions this off season that doesn't seem to be the case.  I could be wrong but I just don't see a QB in our draft cards. That's not to say we won't make a move up the board but if we do it won't be for a QB."
Browns,34ee9c,poru01,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:42:48 2015 UTC,"Probably 0% chance but its the NFL draft so never say never. I'd go with less than a 15%. In other words, I wouldn't count on it."
Browns,34ee9c,npac85,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:05:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind if they took a guy later in the draft, like Shane Carden in 6/7th round. But I would be surprised (and annoyed) if they use a high pick on another QB."
Browns,34ee9c,meyer_33_09,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:06:04 2015 UTC,I'd say 70%. More likely Mariota
Browns,34ee9c,miked1be,5,Thu Apr 30 20:09:00 2015 UTC,I'm starting to think we have better chances of ending up with Bradford tonight over Mariota.
Browns,34ee9c,jsho4realyo,2,Thu Apr 30 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I have that same feeling. The chubb in Cleveland is hard for Bradford, apparently."
Browns,34ee9c,Daviroth,3,Thu Apr 30 13:52:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, if Bradford can stay healthy for 16 games we are a playoff team. I got a little more than a chubb."
Browns,34ee9c,MasterPooBlaster,2,Thu Apr 30 13:54:55 2015 UTC,Eh doubtful. We need a lot more than Bradford to be a playoff team.
Browns,34ee9c,Daviroth,2,Thu Apr 30 13:57:09 2015 UTC,Like what? We almost made the playoffs last year with Hoyer. Give us Bradford and Mack for a season we are DEFINITELY at the very least competing for a playoff spot in week 15-17.
Browns,34ee9c,MasterPooBlaster,2,Thu Apr 30 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"I just think we have way more holes than a injury prone QB can fill. We have an unproven running back group, a dismal WR group (better than last year, but still dismal), and chances are Mack is gone after this year. And that is just on offense."
Browns,34ee9c,Daviroth,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:59:36 2015 UTC,"We do have more holes. But QB is one of them and we almost made playoffs with a horrible QB. The team has only gotten better since then (other than losing 5 games a year Cameron). So tell me, this coming year, how we are not a playoff contending team with Bradford at the helm playing 16 games. Please.  The running backs did solid last year missing Mack for most of the year, not gonna be much of a worry I think.  The WRs did well enough and we now have a real #1 and real #2 receiver so they will only perform better.  Mack might leave next year, he might not. I'm talking about this year. Which, if we make playoffs and continue to pay him I don't think he would leave."
Browns,34ee9c,MasterPooBlaster,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:11:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking to get into an argument as I have bigger fish to fry today. I'm just saying in my objective opinion, adding Bradford we would still miss the playoffs. I see more holes that need filled in order to build a sustained winner."
Browns,34ee9c,Daviroth,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:14:16 2015 UTC,"What holes? The only ones you listed were unproven running backs (questionable and unproven is not bad), WR (which we won with last year and are only better), and speculation that we lose someone next year which we very easily could not."
Browns,34ee9c,youwithme,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:36:28 2015 UTC,I would be so weird if Sam Bradford was the first to give the Browns a playoff win since moving. Think about how weird that is. It's just weird.
Browns,34ee9c,Daviroth,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:46:54 2015 UTC,It's pretty weird. But I don't think anyone would be upset haha.

Browns,34ee9c,admiralkit,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:38:24 2015 UTC,"Less than 1%.  To draft a new QB in the first round of this year would be a massive indictment of the job they did last year.  Admittedly last year was a bit chaotic with a coaching search that resulted in the front office being cleared out yet again, but it still comes down to Farmer admitting he fucked up by pulling the trigger on drafting Johnny Manziel."
Browns,34ee9c,djroomba322,-1,Thu Apr 30 14:00:01 2015 UTC,95% we get a QB. And that's low.  But I'd say its more likely it is a mid to late round selection.

Browns,34ee9c,miked1be,2,Thu Apr 30 13:50:38 2015 UTC,"That's the way it sounds like things are moving.  Sounds like Ray took a flyer and offered 12 and 19 to the Jets Titans but they didn't bite and that's all he's willing to give up (maybe a mid rounder thrown in or something but that's the meat of the deal).  The trade talks with the Eagles may not even be for Bradford if they happen, could be for Kendricks, Cox or even Alonso since he played so well for Pettine in Buffalo.  Edit:  Wrong team"
Browns,34ee9c,meyer_33_09,2,Thu Apr 30 14:04:22 2015 UTC,"That's the ideal situation for Cleveland, in my opinion. But it's not really our MO. We tend to jump on QBs earlier than later."

Browns,34ep6l,rdpcatfan,3,Thu Apr 30 19:41:46 2015 UTC,"I'm very intrigued by trading #12 to the Eagles for BOTH Bradford and Kiko Alonso. If the Eagles need the Browns help, the Browns need to get 2 players they like. It then leaves them with flexibility to move around with 19 and 43 to get another good player in the 1st or early second.  I am also happy with them staying at 12 and 19, or moving around a little in the first round. I think they'd be hard pressed to do something I absolutely hate, because I think there's a lot of opportunities to make the team better.  One player I think thats been talked about but not widely believed to be a real option by most Browns fans is Todd Gurley. I think he would be a huge weapon if they got him."
Browns,34ep6l,SnakeLaFleur,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:26:45 2015 UTC,This doesn't seem possible. Why would the eagles make that trade? Will Mariota fall?
Browns,34ep6l,WaffylesYay,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"I guess they'd make it because if they really want Mariota, they don't need one of Bradford, Sanchez, and Tebow. The only one with trade value is Bradford. If they want that #12 pick as bait for Mariota, they'd have to include more.   Realistically, I don't see it happening.

Browns,34ejd5,Flables,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"Agholor at 19 is probably a bit early. Unless there is a run on 1st round receivers and the Browns panic. Remember Agholor was a consensus 2nd or 3rd round talent just a short while ago.   I'm not sure about a running back in the first round. In theory setting up an elite back field is very appealing for a team with nothing but sad questions at the qb position. At the same time, drafting a running back in the first round does not make much sense from a value/need standpoint. I probably would not want gurley in the first round though, big time injuries to college running backs rarely pan out in the long run in the nfl."
Browns,34ejd5,npac85,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:30:42 2015 UTC,i am slowly coming around to the possibility of a stud RB at 19. its beginning to look like any WR at 19 may be a reach but what do i know im not a scout.
Browns,34ejd5,moodyfloyd,11,Thu Apr 30 14:36:03 2015 UTC,I would be mad. RB is wayyyyy down on the list of needs. We may not get a WR at 19 but there are plenty of other options with higher needs that will be available. Like OL or safety.
Browns,34ejd5,average_white_male,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:42:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Not only is RB not very high on the our list of needs, but it's also an insanely risky pick."
Browns,34ejd5,meyer_33_09,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:07:22 2015 UTC,Disagree. Right now we have two RBs on the roster that would be back-ups on most teams. One is an UDFA who couldn't pass block to save his own life and caused our QBs to take horrendous damage because of it. The other shows POTENTIAL to be slightly above average. Neither scare anyone....anyone.   Beast mode part 2 would be a great pick at 19 imo.  All of a sudden DCs have to game plan for a major RB threat and they can't blitz 5-6-7 guys every down?
Browns,34ejd5,subhuman1,-1,Thu Apr 30 15:37:58 2015 UTC,Remember the last time we took a RB in the 1st rd? No RB is a guarantee and if we do draft MG III teams will still blitz every down because our passing game is currently a joke. Stretching the field with a wr gives holes to Crowell and West.
Browns,34ejd5,average_white_male,2,Thu Apr 30 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"Remember that time Jamarcus Russel was drafted? Yeah, no team should ever draft a QB #1."
Browns,34ejd5,Nightcinder,2,Thu Apr 30 17:21:02 2015 UTC,That's a bit of a stretch from me talking about recent Browns drafts and comparing it to the entire draft history. I just think taking a RB in the 1st round is not what our team needs when other holes could be addressed.
Browns,34ejd5,average_white_male,2,Thu Apr 30 17:59:31 2015 UTC,I'm not but I'm accepting the possible reality.
Browns,34ehro,miked1be,4,Thu Apr 30 14:14:28 2015 UTC,Anything more than 12 and 19 would be insane...

Browns,34ehro,djroomba322,0,Thu Apr 30 14:28:17 2015 UTC,"12 19 and a 3rd round pick should get it done.  If they want anything more than that, then its too much.  Once we get down to it, waffling over a 2nd or 3rd round pick in trying to acquire your franchise guy, just pay it and recoup something for Manziel in the future.  But to lose a franchise guy because you dont want to give up a 2nd or 3rd?   Certainly the titans are positing for position asking for three 1s, so I don't even buy that as a real offer."
Browns,34ehro,_SilkyJohnson,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:39:34 2015 UTC,I could be on board with next year's 2nd or 3rd along with both firsts as long as they're pretty confident in Mariota's ability but both firsts this year and a 2nd this year?  That would really hurt the rest of the team IMO.
Browns,34ehro,LosingMyEdge7,3,Thu Apr 30 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"The one that pisses me off the most is that 3 way trade with us, the titans and the eagles.

I truly feel that our best decision would be to build around the QBS that are on this roster now. hell I would rather take Gordon or Gurley with a 1st then have Bradford... let's the eagles give up their future .... not us"
Browns,34ehro,_SilkyJohnson,3,Thu Apr 30 15:04:47 2015 UTC,Someone should ask the Redskins how trading away their teams entire future for arguably a much better prospect than Mariotta worked out for them.

Also, pointing out that if we go the Mariotta route, it would be right IF Farmer thinks he's the best guy and it would be wrong IF it's just to get the best QB; seems contradictory, but is a really great nuanced way of saying that the motivation behind a pick matters.   You either do what you think is right or you do whatever the conventional wisdom thinks is right - those are two different kinds of people.  So, which one are you, Mr. Farmer?  I'm betting on the former.  EDIT: I don't mean Farmer should go for Mariotta, I just believe that Farmer will do what he thinks is right and I have a good deal of confidence that whatever that is, it will be good for the team."

Browns,34antu,Stowcenter93,9,Wed Apr 29 19:24:57 2015 UTC,I'm praying they did. And I'm praying Titans accept. This is highway robbery that is very low risk high reward!
Browns,34antu,the_flow_bro,14,Wed Apr 29 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"Do you mean low risk as in Mariota could be a bust and sets the franchise back again a few years because we passed on getting more key pieces with 12/19 and building around the guys we have? Cause then yes, very low risk...."
Browns,34antu,Jhonopolis,7,Wed Apr 29 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"You are going nowhere without a QB. End of story. If you ""build through the draft"" like so many fans want you make it even more impossible to get the franchise QB you need. If you think the price for a potential franchise QB is too high right now imagine what it will take if we are mediocre and only have our own pick in the early 20's. The years a Mariota bust will set you back are wasted even if we pass on him, you will still be going nowhere."
Browns,34antu,theband65,2,Wed Apr 29 18:01:31 2015 UTC,What about building up other parts of the Offense and wait until a more QB heavy draft so that he/she doesn't have to be the savior and can have other weapons to rely on? If we rush another project QB into an offense under construction then it'll be more of the same. Not to mention building the defense too
Browns,34antu,Jhonopolis,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:00:05 2015 UTC,"Like Trent Richardson, Braylon Edwards, Kellen Winslow Jr, Willie Green, Greg Little, Montario Hardesty, Brian Robiskie, Mohamad Massaquoi?  We have tried to take offensive weapons with 1st and 2nd rounders plenty of times, it never works (partially) because we have no one to get them the ball."
Browns,34antu,theband65,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"And do you really want me to go through the list of failed QBs? The picks you mentioned didn't work because they weren't that good. Trent had Luck, Edwards was good until his hands were paralyzed, winslow was injury prone, willie green you might have a point but he was also a nutcase, Greg little didn't have anyone to throw to but he also couldn't catch the ball, RObiskie was never a top prospect anyway and it probably wouldn't have mattered anyway. The point is that the Browns have drafted badly before this regime of farmer and pettine and one of the poorer decisions they made last draft was Manziel. He might wind up to be good who knows. But I just don't think it's a good idea to burn another 1st round pick on a guy like Mariota who in all likelihood will be a bust. Use the pick to draft less of a gamble. Your argument seems to be to keep throwing QB picks at the wall and hope that one of them sticks eventually."
Browns,34antu,Fred_Zeppelin,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:27:20 2015 UTC,"wait until a more QB heavy draft   How many years do you want to wait though? All these players you draft in the meantime are gone by the time you find your QB.  You have to find a QB first and then build around him. It doesn't matter how many picks you waste on duds, or how many years in a row you draft a QB, you have to keep trying until you hit on one.  Look at the Bengals, they are loaded with ""pieces"", but they have an average QB. They're going nowhere."
Browns,34antu,theband65,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:04:36 2015 UTC,Who says a QB draft is a generation away? I just meant a draft with more QBs that will fit your system rather than wasting a high risk pick on another QB. And unfortunately the bengals make the playoffs which is more than the browns right now.
Browns,34antu,the_flow_bro,2,Wed Apr 29 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"You can get plenty of franchise qb's that aren't in the first round. Wilson, Brady, etc. There are a lot of scenarios where trading away a bunch of picks for one guy doesn't work. RG3 being the most recent example that comes to mind"
Browns,34antu,Jhonopolis,2,Wed Apr 29 20:52:52 2015 UTC,"RG3 looked quite good before he got injured, i would say that has to do more with his style of play rather than anything regarding the trading of picks. Statistically you are still much more likely to get a franchise QB in the first round than you are later in the draft. Brady is certainly the outlier in this debate. Just look at the QB's in the playoffs last year.  Peyton Manning 1st round (#1 overall)  Cam Newton 1st round (#1 overall)  Alex Smith 1st round (#1 overall)  Andrew Luck 1st round (#1 overall)  Jay Cutler 1st round  Mark Sanchez 1st round  Ryan Tannehill 1st round  Drew Brees 2nd round (1st pick)  Andy Dalton 2nd round (3rd pick)  Colin Kaepernick 2nd round (4th pick)  Russell Wilson 3rd round  Tom Brady 6th round"
Browns,34antu,Back41DayOnly,2,Wed Apr 29 23:47:50 2015 UTC,Only if you draft the right one. Weeden was a first round QB and we all know how that one ended...
Browns,34antu,Jhonopolis,2,Thu Apr 30 00:21:56 2015 UTC,Like i said 1st round QBs are only about 50/50 but thats still a much higher proportion than anyone beyond the 2nd round.
Browns,34antu,Back41DayOnly,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:35:06 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. What are the rates of other positions taken in the first round that the Browns are in need of? It seems like receivers and running backs also have an unfavorable success rate.  I think that's why many of us are clamoring for safer positions of need to be bolstered with top end talent. If that's all taken care of, we can afford to miss on a QB or Receiver pick here or there."

Browns,34antu,bad_master,5,Wed Apr 29 17:35:30 2015 UTC,No. 12 and no. 19 for no. 2 is a trade of unprecedented value in our favor.
Browns,34antu,YouAreNOTMySuperviso,2,Wed Apr 29 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"In the abstract, yes. But the true value of any pick is what you do with it. I like Mariota well enough, but I don't think he specifically is worth the risk. And I can't fathom why we'd trade up for anyone else."
Browns,34antu,sir_sweatervest,3,Wed Apr 29 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"Cooper, maybe? To give johnny as many weapons as possible"
Browns,34antu,YouAreNOTMySuperviso,3,Wed Apr 29 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"When it comes to the draft I never say never, but that seems pretty unlikely to me. Farmer has shown that he doesn't consider WR a pressing need. One of Cooper, White, or Parker should be available at 12. If they're really worried, trading up to 5 or 6 would be sufficient rather than #2."
Browns,34antu,sir_sweatervest,2,Wed Apr 29 18:52:15 2015 UTC,It's definitely unlikely and downright stupid in my opinion. I'm just trying to see other scenarios going on in his head
Browns,34antu,blackedout,3,Wed Apr 29 20:47:32 2015 UTC,It depends on what our motive is?   Williams? Yes.  Hold it ransom for a stupid cost or specific player? Maybe.  For Marcus? No.
Browns,34antu,Stowcenter93,4,Wed Apr 29 21:49:03 2015 UTC,Disagree. I believe Mariota is easily worth it. But I understand that opinion and I don't think it's wrong.

Browns,34ccja,Execrat0r,3,Thu Apr 30 01:33:12 2015 UTC,Actually I thought the comments here were probably the most enlightening I've seen yet with Pettine literally saying that if they were to draft Mariota that would mean they've given up on Manziel. And I think the team has made it clear that they have not given up on him.  Not to say we wouldn't move up. But I would bet money now that it won't be for Mariota if we do.

Browns have had high interest in him for over a year, hard to think they just dropped it right now 3. Ray Farmer needs to do something big. Its rumored he thinks Marcus is best in draft.  4. they've tried to get Sam Bradford recently, proving they think we still need a quarterback   I'm not saying we should or shouldn't, I've just been noticing this pattern of an ""I don't want mariota circle jerk"".

Browns,34broe,StalinOut,8,Wed Apr 29 23:35:10 2015 UTC,Farmer's love for Mariota could be a smokescreen.

Browns,34broe,StalinOut,2,Wed Apr 29 23:47:24 2015 UTC,Exactly. All im trying to say is you guys shouldn't get to ahead of yourselves especially seeing are track record.
Browns,34broe,JohnStamosBRAH,2,Wed Apr 29 23:53:51 2015 UTC,Maybe that interest in him last year and Bradford this year were smokescreens.
Browns,34broe,Fred_Zeppelin,2,Thu Apr 30 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"I've just been noticing this pattern of an ""I don't want mariota circle jerk""   Indeed, and I can't help but think it has more to do with our history of drafting QBs than it does with Mariota himself."
Browns,34broe,miked1be,2,Thu Apr 30 14:24:19 2015 UTC,"Browns have had high interest in him for over a year, hard to think they just dropped it right now   You sure about that?  I just find it weird that a report from a ""source"" came out that Farmer has liked Mariota from the start right before he went out and drafted Manziel.  If he was really that interested in Mariota and possibly drafting him then drafting Manziel last season is kind of a weird move.  There was no actual quote from Farmer (that I've seen) saying he was his favorite QB and that he wanted to draft him, just Rapoport saying he had a source that Farmer liked Mariota.     they've tried to get Sam Bradford recently, proving they think we still need a quarterback   They're still unsure at the QB position so putting feelers out there for possible available QBs isn't a bad idea.    Just as you said, smokescreans, smokescreens everywhere.  Nothing means anything at this point."

Browns,34du1h,hendrix219,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:51:15 2015 UTC,"Well at least we have the cap space, but a first for just Bradford isn't really valuable to us with that injury history."
Browns,34du1h,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:25:24 2015 UTC,Well there is thinking we would be sending a defensive player too for the 12th pick. It's tough and going to be a very stressful day man...
Browns,34du1h,hendrix219,3,Thu Apr 30 12:52:57 2015 UTC,If you offer Bradford and Cox for 12 we better take that shit immediately. That's shoring up one hole on defense (although not the most prominent) and giving us a playoff capable QB. We grab a great run stopping NT with 19 and we are set.
Browns,34du1h,Daviroth,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:25:04 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a no brainier but I'm thinking if anyone's getting Cox it's Tennessee. It's more likely Bradford and kendricks. Something like that. No ones going to know anything for sure till the pick comes up
Browns,34du1h,hendrix219,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:17:19 2015 UTC,It's gonna be an exciting night.
Browns,34du1h,Daviroth,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:20:16 2015 UTC,Bradford for a first rounder is a bad deal.   BUT there are potential deals that aren't bad. Bradford to flip picks? Steal. Bradford + another player for 12? Potentially worth it.
Browns,34du1h,Daviroth,2,Thu Apr 30 13:23:37 2015 UTC,"He's definitely not.  Here's what's happening.  TEN wants 3 firsts from PHI for #2 but not Bradford.  PHI only as two firsts right now - this year's and next year's.  If PHI can get CLE to give up one of their firsts for Bradford, PHI will package the 2 firsts this year and a first next year to TEN for MM.  So, CLE is a pawn to help PHI and TEN get what they want.  Screw that, we should either offer a 3rd for Bradford or, offer a first and demand a second plus Bradford.  Nobody else is going to give up a first for Bradford, so why should CLE?"
Browns,34du1h,tomchaney479,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:10:41 2015 UTC,When Washington traded with St.Louis didn't they do three years worth of 1st rounders? Why can't Philadelphia do something similar and cut out the middle man.
Browns,34du1h,d-a-f-f-y,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"3 reasons: (1)  RG3 was a much higher rated prospect than MM, (2) CLE had a significant offer on the table that WAS had to overcome, and (3) WAS had one of the most inept front office/owners in pro sports.  If PHI wants help in acquiring MM from CLE, then they're going to have to pay us a STEEP price.  They want MM much more than we want Bradford.  Now is the perfect time to take advantage of a team like PHI."
Browns,34du1h,tomchaney479,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:22:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's a good idea, but if Chip is as desperate as it seems, I'd think he'd at least consider it. Especially since every report says we either haven't made an offer for #2, or that we have and it's not enough."
Browns,34du1h,d-a-f-f-y,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:28:11 2015 UTC,I agree he isn't worth it. He will almost certainly not last the whole year. I think we need to focus on off/def line and then wr/te
Browns,34du1h,bds310,4,Thu Apr 30 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"BRADFORD IS NOT WORTH A FIRST ROUND PICK.  If you are Philly and you want 19, Give us Bradford plus one of your all pro's and your second rounder. Thats my price. If Chip wants him that bad, he's got to make it a can't pass up deal. Im so tired of these attempts to go even stevens. If you want it, you pay for it. Its called supply and demand. The Browns (for once) are in the power seat, and if they screw this up ill be so damn mad. You smell blood, you go for the kill, thats how it works. If they aren't willing to make it an offer you can't refuse, THEN REFUSE IT."
Browns,34du1h,sginsc,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:44:08 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree. With the 12 and 19, we are definitely not in a position of desperation."
Browns,34du1h,redsfan8,2,Thu Apr 30 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"So trade for Bradford? Why not try for Brees then?  I'm still not over Manziel, IMO I don't think the Browns should be either."
Browns,34du1h,redsfan8,2,Thu Apr 30 11:56:45 2015 UTC,Trading for Bradford or Brees doesn't cut the cord on Manziel. He can learn from them.
Browns,34du1h,Daviroth,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:30:01 2015 UTC,"Valid, I just wish Brees was more in this equation rather than Bradford. Saints seem to be in a semi-firesale, probably could get him if we really had interest."
Browns,34du1h,eljeffe97,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:06:16 2015 UTC,"I read an article a while ago, that said any player (including Brees) on the Saints roster could be had for the right price. Considering they traded Graham, I wouldn't rule anything out."
Browns,34du1h,Daviroth,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I'm not over Manziel either but Bradford has proven he can play damn well at the NFL level. You don't pass up a sure thing for potential, that's just not how it works. It's not like we lose Manziel if we sign Bradford. Manziel is on this team for the next 3-4 years whether he likes it or not."
Browns,34du1h,eljeffe97,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:27:22 2015 UTC,Damn well is a strong phrase to describe Bradford.  Damn ehhhhh would be more accurate.
Browns,34du1h,Daviroth,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:08:01 2015 UTC,"Damn well might be a hyperbole you are right, but he has shown a lot more than any of the QBs we have on the roster. He has the talent and the ability, he just needs the team."
Browns,34du1h,eljeffe97,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  But I don't think we're that team.  I'd much rather keep our firsts or use it in another trade (maybe a wr at 4/5), and just let Mccown hold the reins this year.  Then see what Johnny can do or find a new guy next year."
Browns,34du1h,droidworkerbee,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:54:19 2015 UTC,"I'm perfectly content with doing that too. I've been a Johnny supporter for a while. But if we get a reasonable opportunity to get Bradford I think we should. If he can play for 16 games we are a playoff caliber team, pretty much instantly."
Browns,34du1h,nizule,2,Thu Apr 30 17:57:35 2015 UTC,If we also added another recieving weapon I could possibly agree here.  But giving Bradford Bowe Hartline and Hawkins probably won't turn out much better than just letting one of the guys on our roster a chance.
Browns,34du1h,droidworkerbee,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:46:05 2015 UTC,"I mean, 19 for Bradford didn't work before. If it does now, what does the Eagles' path to Mariota look like? 19 and 20 isn't enough, they'd at least need to give a 2016 1st."
Browns,34du1h,droidworkerbee,2,Thu Apr 30 10:27:50 2015 UTC,"They also supposedly have players to add in to a trade. Mychal Kendricks, Boykin, Mathis, etc."
Browns,34du1h,djroomba322,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:29:45 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily talking about Bradford, just in general. I'm only in favor if the price is right.

Browns,34du1h,Mike_Shanahan,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:29:28 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. I think my request if I'm Tenn is 19, 20, 2016 2nd, 2017 1st."

When the cards are all laid out on the table and decisions need to be made, its easier to see.  Not saying its going to happen, but I would have been way more surprised if it happened last month than this afternoon.  Esp since Ten could be looking for a better offer from someone like SD and Rivers etc."

Browns,34du1h,StalinOut,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:53:57 2015 UTC,"If I'm the Browns and do want Bradford, I'm going to squeeze the Eagles and make them give up Kiko Alonso as well. If the Eagles want Mariota bad enough, that'll be the price in my opinion. I think I'd be willing to give up 12 for Bradford and Alonso. Then you can move up from 19 or 43 to get another impact player in the first."
Browns,34du1h,buckeyegold,5,Thu Apr 30 11:46:52 2015 UTC,Bradford and Alonso for #12 is a fucking steal. I'd be so goddamn happy if we get that deal. That's amazing.
Browns,34du1h,Daviroth,3,Thu Apr 30 13:26:13 2015 UTC,"Let's think about this.   Eagles traded LeSean McCoy straight up for Kiko Alonso. They then traded Foles, a 2015 4th, and a 2016 2nd for Bradford and a 2015 5th.  If the Eagles turn around and trade Bradford and Alonso to the Browns for #12 this year, then they would probably have to send #12, #20 and a 2016 #1 to the Titans for the right to take Mariota.  That means the Eagles net trade is LeSean McCoy, Nick Foles, #20 and 4th rounder this year, 2016 1st and 2nd for Mariota and a 5th this year. That sounds like Chip Kelly is insane to me, but if he REALLY wants Mariota and would pay that price to get him, then I think the Browns should absolutely make Alonso a sticking point."
Browns,34du1h,nwilso9,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:55:40 2015 UTC,It's a ridiculous price you are right. But if Chip is certain Mariota is a franchise QB then it's all worth it. Franchise QBs are not easy to come by.
Browns,34du1h,bearsdriving,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:00:38 2015 UTC,"Will be interesting to see if the Browns/Eagles call the Titans bluff and the Titans end up taking Leonard Williams or something, how will the price of trading up to 4, 5, or 6 change and what the Eagles are willing to pay."
Browns,34du1h,StalinOut,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:06:57 2015 UTC,Tonight is going to be exciting to say the least.  Inb4 there are absolutely no first round trades.
Browns,34du1h,StalinOut,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:09:59 2015 UTC,"Ugh. As long as we get more than just Bradford for what I'm assuming is the 12th pick. We could make out like a bandit with 2nd and later picks depending on how desperate Philly is.   19 & 20 won't be enough for Tennessee straight from the Eagles so next years first will be gone from them. Maybe like others are suggesting, we'd get Alonso."

Browns,34aiup,themitey1,7,Wed Apr 29 16:39:48 2015 UTC,Colin Cowherd named someone in the Titans front office who has denied the Browns offered anything. I believe someone in the FO over Pat McManananmaman.

Browns,34aiup,chubby_prince,4,Wed Apr 29 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I just don't really see them wanting to spend enough to move to that spot.  It's going to take a king's ransom, so to speak, IMO and losing that many high draft picks could hamper the team too much to be worth it in the opinion of the FO.  I really think if we get a QB it'll more likely be a third round or so project guy or maybe some weird trade to get Bradford than it will be us trading up to get Mariota."
Browns,34aiup,miked1be,-1,Wed Apr 29 17:06:07 2015 UTC,"To the original point:  The reason that the lolbrowns sentiment is a thing is because we either A: Don't take someone and watch them succeed, or B: take someone and they fail.  The lolbrowns will go away as soon as we take someone and they do well.  It will go away in a heartbeat.  Hell, it was gone for most of the season last year as it was.  It won't take a king's ransom as we already have two first round picks and we don't have to mortage the entire future, and Manziel will have some future trade value to compensate.  But we could go back to Colt, or even Hoyer last year where we had an opportunity to surround them with weapons, and instead we tried to get cute with it.   I don't feel a 3rd round project guy is going to be worth it.  They'll end up being competitive for a starting spot early, since the caliber of our current QBs are not high currently.  And the last thing we need to do is create even more of a muddled mess.  Take a late round project, get us some OL depth in the 3rd and call it a day."
Browns,34aiup,djroomba322,0,Wed Apr 29 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"It won't take a king's ransom as we already have two first round picks and we don't have to mortage the entire future, and Manziel will have some future trade value to compensate.   Decent point about Manziel's future trade value.  But what about not building a team, bringing in a guy like Mariota that might be good right off the bat or might need time to adjust and throwing him in too early without a supporting cast because we used our top draft picks for this year and probably next to get him.  It's all a matter of what the worth is there in the opinion of the FO.  The Browns could pass on him to build the rest of the team, see him succeed, and have everyone make fun of us even though he may not have succeeded with the team we had in place at this time."
Browns,34aiup,miked1be,-1,Wed Apr 29 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point.  But the raiders showed that a team can not have weapons and have a ""good"" QB, and their perception has almost completely changed.  And Carr played alright, not even great.  I truly feel if we have a franchise guy then whatever perception of us is all washed away.    And honestly, I have never once personally cared for a second what another fan or member on a forum has ever thought of my team.  I really don't understand why it matters.  We should feel pride based on the results of our players, not what some forum idiot thinks, or what some talking head on ESPN thinks.  Especially coming from a fanbase that is deeply involved in the other side of the coin with the Cavs and LeBron.  Where people don't like us because we were spoiled brats and didn't value what we had.   Its all so pointless to even worry about.   The Browns should get Mariota if they feel he is a 10 year franchise guy.  If they do, they should get him. The options we have now are McCown and Manziel.  McCowns issues are obvious, and Manziel is still a wildcard with a very low chance it coming up an Ace.    I personally don't think we should trade up and should get weapons to surround whoever we have and I don't think Mariota looks all that great.  But if they do, go get him."
Browns,34aiup,djroomba322,3,Wed Apr 29 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"The Browns should get Mariota if they feel he is a 10 year franchise guy. If they do, they should get him.   I completely agree there but if our QB coach saw something he didn't like in him during that training time ""before he got hired"" then it would be tough to spend so much on a guy you're wary of.  I have no idea what they think of him though, if they feel like he can truly be a franchise guy then get him, if they're wary then don't reach out of desperation, that's how we end up with guys like Quinn.  Or maybe a guy like McCoy who could have prossibly been competitive with the right supporting cast and time to develop but he didn't have either."

Browns,34aiup,ThaddeusJP,3,Wed Apr 29 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand what you are saying, but for some reason I like it."
Browns,34aiup,chubby_prince,3,Wed Apr 29 18:21:52 2015 UTC,That would at least be a little better. I think it's ridiculous to trade the two first rounders either way.
Browns,34aiup,largefarva68,6,Wed Apr 29 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"I just don't see it. Smoke and mirrors. We have so many other needs in a very talented draft, why would we give up great position for a QB when reports are saying Johnny is turning it around?   I was never big on JFF, but this just doesn't make sense."
Browns,34aiup,chris4aker,5,Wed Apr 29 16:37:23 2015 UTC,Well in fairness Johnny is turning around his life. Not his ability as a QB.

Browns,34aiup,msmouse05,11,Wed Apr 29 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Tennessee hasn't accepted or rejected yet, hopefully they reject it and we don't counter."
Browns,34aiup,msmouse05,-6,Wed Apr 29 16:40:04 2015 UTC,How do they not accept it? It is highway robbery. We will probably throw in a 4th too.
Browns,34aiup,tigerdactyl,21,Wed Apr 29 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"That'd be more like us robbing them. Browns got 2 firsts from Bills to get Watkins. 2 1sts for a potential franchise QB, we'd be robbing them."
Browns,34aiup,Stowcenter93,3,Wed Apr 29 16:48:11 2015 UTC,2 firsts for a guy you believe will be your franchise QB is nothing. Now who knows if Mariota is actually that guy.
Browns,34aiup,Spartan_55,0,Wed Apr 29 17:16:00 2015 UTC,"""potential"" franchise QB.   You already have a ""potential"" QB on your roster. Don't trade your whole draft for 1 player when you have 5-6 holes."
Browns,34aiup,Stowcenter93,12,Wed Apr 29 16:49:38 2015 UTC,"You'd be giving up essentially 1 pick. Which, we haven't had any success in the past years anyway in the first round. This would be a god damn steal!"
Browns,34aiup,Deadleggg,4,Wed Apr 29 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"We haven't had any success because we keep drafting QB's and BS players, go safe get a big NT and OL even if they perform average for their draft position theyll be upgrades."
Browns,34aiup,Spartan_55,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"Look I understand what your saying, but to me, you keep drafting QBs until you get it right, because once you do, everything is going to change.  You can finally start building a winner then."
Browns,34aiup,topper_mango,4,Wed Apr 29 17:06:06 2015 UTC,The Ravens had years of winners with a stout defense until Flacco caught fire for 2 months. A strong defense and running game will be there. Pittsburgh built their decade plus of playoff runs with that mentality. Fuck this messiah search.
Browns,34aiup,Totesbannedx2,2,Wed Apr 29 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed an Elite Defense and Running Game with Average QB play will win more consistently. Plus with a great Def and Run game you can develop an Elite QB. Instead of continually drafting QB's. Its almost a zero percent chance that any QB will just be elite out of college. Andrew Luck had a great team, Ben Roethlisberger, Russell Wilson, etc."

Browns,34aiup,miked1be,-1,Wed Apr 29 17:18:33 2015 UTC,I agree. Mariota is as big a gamble as Johnny was. If we trade up it better be for a sure fire stud.
Browns,34aiup,miked1be,2,Wed Apr 29 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"I would say he's slightly less of a gamble because of his leadership, but the point still stands. He's no sure thing"
Browns,34aiup,Grandmawild,10,Wed Apr 29 18:55:31 2015 UTC,"Redskins used three firsts and a second to move to the 2nd overall pick, two firsts probably wouldn't do it."
Browns,34aiup,Grandmawild,-1,Wed Apr 29 16:45:01 2015 UTC,"RGIII was considered a lot more ""safe"" then Mariota."
Browns,34aiup,nofxsnap,8,Wed Apr 29 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"According to ""draft experts"".  We don't know what teams are offering/valuing.  Chip's crazy he could be offering up a huge deal for all we know."

Browns,34aiup,kuss51292,-1,Wed Apr 29 16:52:43 2015 UTC,Judging by everyone else I guess so?
Browns,34aiup,Dcowboys09,2,Wed Apr 29 17:33:36 2015 UTC,Yea I just think it'll take more than giving up 1 first rounder. I would guess they'd want next years too. Which is way too much for Mariota imo
Browns,34aiup,henf92,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:36:10 2015 UTC,I think we'd have to add at least a 2nd round pick to that (either this year or next) to make it work with the trade value chart.
Browns,34aiup,henf92,3,Wed Apr 29 20:06:52 2015 UTC,"Did you even bother to read the actual article that McManamon wrote? Do you understand that it's the GM's responsibility to know the market and vet all possible options? If they weren't talking to everyone you should be concerned.   Have you read this direct quote from Farmer?   ""I would go up if it was the right circumstance, and I would go back if it was the right circumstance. A lot of the scuttlebutt that you hear and the conjecture and the noise that's out there, it changes the complexion of trying to get a deal done. If everybody thinks that you want something, your price just went up.""    Or have you read this?    Another source close to the Browns said there have been no substantive talks with the Titans and that these discussions commonly take place as the draft approaches.  Sometimes it helps to actually read and research about a subject before posting conjecture and BS on the internet."
Browns,34aiup,TheTritium,5,Wed Apr 29 17:23:35 2015 UTC,I'm now hoping Chip out bargins the Browns.

Browns,34aiup,maxpowerway,6,Thu Apr 30 08:34:06 2015 UTC,Speculation until it happens. How do we know the Titans aren't planting this info to see what other teams might offer?
Browns,34aiup,sonicmerlin,3,Wed Apr 29 16:40:03 2015 UTC,My thought as well. This could be a perfect way for them to drum up some competition where there isn't much. Based on everything I've read 12 & 19 still don't even equal the value of 2 so we would have to add more value to the trade.
Browns,34aiup,maxpowerway,3,Wed Apr 29 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"The draft value chart is a farce. It is more of a supply/demand issue. Sometimes, you got to create extra demand to drive up the price. This is a good starting spot for Tennessee regarding negotiations. If other teams are interested, Tennessee is basically using the Browns to show the minimum of where the negotiations begin."
Browns,34aiup,QueefStain,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a farce, just a guideline."
Browns,34aiup,KegmanZulu,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"By that same token, whose guideline? Teams use several different methods and place little emphasis on the draft value chart. No one sits around and says, ""Well, according to the draft value chart, we need 800 more points before we can take this trade"" or ""We need to package 800 points worth of draft picks to be able to move up to pick Y, so we need to package picks A, B, and next year's C to be able to do it.""  It's BS. Trading draft picks is too fluid and dependent upon too many variables to quantify into a little chart. Teams make trades based on supply and demand, not the guidelines of a draft value chart."
Browns,34aiup,Putuinurplace,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:38:27 2015 UTC,A guideline is just a crude estimate.  A rule of thumb.  A stick in the mud (I made that last one up).
Browns,34aiup,Doyle524,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:13:00 2015 UTC,"The only time it's used is by reddit wannabe general managers and talking heads to justify why some ridiculous trade that never happens makes sense to them. If that's what you want to use as a guideline, by all means please do, but those that do look foolish."
Browns,34aiup,Putuinurplace,4,Thu Apr 30 10:51:16 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. Not only would this be a highly questionable move, but if true, then that suggests that the front office is completely unscrupulous in their dealing with the draft, which means same old Browns. I trust that Farmer wouldn't let something like this leak."
Browns,34aiup,sobz,5,Wed Apr 29 16:44:04 2015 UTC,Then we trade the number 2 pick to San Diego for Phillip Rivers.
Browns,34aiup,Dude4445,3,Wed Apr 29 16:45:49 2015 UTC,RT if u cri
Browns,34aiup,Back41DayOnly,10,Wed Apr 29 16:46:45 2015 UTC,I'm pretty positive if rivers was our qb we would win the division.

Browns,34aiup,Dean_Craig_Pelton,7,Thu Apr 30 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"Take this with a grain of salt, this could easily be coming from the Tennessee camp to try and artificially drive up the price if the eagles want to trade up. There's no way the browns make this trade until they know Winston is going no 1, 100%."
Browns,34aiup,Dustin65,3,Wed Apr 29 16:50:39 2015 UTC,This seems like an obvious play by the Titans to drive up the price on the #2 pick. They've wanted out of that spot for months and are getting desperate to move it.
Browns,34aiup,Dean_Craig_Pelton,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:00:20 2015 UTC,They wouldn't take Winston at 2 if for some reason he doesn't go 1st overall?
Browns,34aiup,buckeyegold,13,Wed Apr 29 22:13:38 2015 UTC,Just not mariota.
Browns,34aiup,Dean_Craig_Pelton,6,Wed Apr 29 16:36:01 2015 UTC,Who else then? Maybe the WR they secretly obsess over?? Please not another project QB
Browns,34aiup,patagonian_pegasus,18,Wed Apr 29 16:40:30 2015 UTC,It better be for fucking Leonard Williams
Browns,34aiup,theband65,2,Wed Apr 29 16:44:22 2015 UTC,Danny Shelton AND Jaelen Strong > Leonard Williams
Browns,34aiup,BrownsCavsIndians7,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:57:38 2015 UTC,Idk Shelton may be a bust and Leonard is a fucking beast and the drop off between Strong and the next group of WRs isn't that much. I'd happily make that deal.
Browns,34aiup,theband65,-3,Wed Apr 29 20:32:04 2015 UTC,They're not that smart
Browns,34aiup,miked1be,7,Wed Apr 29 16:47:01 2015 UTC,I think they might be

Browns,34aiup,msmouse05,5,Wed Apr 29 16:45:20 2015 UTC,Idk anyone else. I just have a feeling about Mariota that it'll be a failure and another waste of a draft pick. Bolster up the D-Line or something. Fill other needs. That being said I don't think they should get rid of the two firsts.
Browns,34aiup,themitey1,2,Wed Apr 29 16:42:40 2015 UTC,"We really need to stand pat and draft a someone on the defensive line, Mariota is not the answer."
Browns,34aiup,msmouse05,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:48:24 2015 UTC,Definitely not. At least not for this team
Browns,34aiup,rljohnson21,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:54:18 2015 UTC,"If they see someone like Williams as a Suh-like game changer I wouldn't be mad about trading up to get him for the right price.  Staying put isn't necessary in my mind, they just need to move up for the right guy at the right price."
Browns,34aiup,95_Browns,7,Wed Apr 29 16:54:57 2015 UTC,Is this legit? I find this hard to believe.
Browns,34aiup,msmouse05,-2,Wed Apr 29 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, from ESPN's Sportscenter Twitter. Offer was extended but hasn't been accepted or rejected yet.  Edit: Looks like now it was just discussion and who knows if anything former has been offered."
Browns,34aiup,95_Browns,4,Wed Apr 29 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"And then another source said that it was just a discussion, no offer or anything more than that.  That's from what that twitter came from, the article on ESPN."
Browns,34aiup,msmouse05,0,Wed Apr 29 16:43:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, keeps changing but sounds like it's nothing really."

Browns,34aiup,Doyle524,0,Wed Apr 29 17:38:39 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make any difference. The Sportscenter twitter account is not a reliable source. They might as well be TMZ at this point. Proliferating this nonsense just adds to the ""LOL Browns"" narrative. I just wish that people would take a minute to think before rushing to the internet to spread ESPNs agenda. The worst part is that all the information coming out now showing this tweet to be misleading at best will get a fraction of the attention the sensationalist tweet created."
Browns,34aiup,RAVENS17d,-1,Wed Apr 29 17:50:36 2015 UTC,"I specifically said where the information came from. It's not as if I said the information was confirmed from another source. Just said it's legit in that it's coming from ESPN. How terrible of me to assume they knew what they were doing, especially when it was coming from one of the ESPN Reporter who covers the Browns."
Browns,34aiup,BroncoBuckeye,3,Wed Apr 29 18:00:18 2015 UTC,The only thing I can think of that makes sense that I would agree with is us moving up and then trading it again to the Eagles for Bradford and picks or Chargers for Rivers and picks. Other than that maybe going to grab Amari Cooper but I don't think it's work losing both of our firsts to move up to 2nd over all just for a WR. I just really hope it's not to take Mariota.
Browns,34aiup,largefarva68,3,Wed Apr 29 16:46:39 2015 UTC,Annnnnnd The Titans just said they received no such offer.
Browns,34aiup,TaintCadet,3,Wed Apr 29 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"Do you guys think your possibly moving up to snatch Leonard Williams, instead of Mariota?"

Browns,34aiup,jvpewster,4,Wed Apr 29 18:01:15 2015 UTC,Please be wrong. This is just a terrible move. QB is NOT what we should be looking for in the 1st and especially not Mariota.
Browns,34aiup,topper_mango,3,Wed Apr 29 16:39:06 2015 UTC,Why especially not Mariota?
Browns,34aiup,jvpewster,6,Wed Apr 29 16:44:34 2015 UTC,Because the offense he ran in Oregon doesn't match up well with us.  I just see him being another great college QB to fail in the NFL.
Browns,34aiup,topper_mango,3,Wed Apr 29 16:49:18 2015 UTC,He's a smart QB with a good head on his shoulders and his decision making is fantastic. I think he will have success adjusting his game to the pro level.
Browns,34aiup,justinniedz1,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:54:42 2015 UTC,Yeah he definitely has the skillset that is needed if you want to adjust your game. But giving up this much for a guy that will need to adjust his game is kinda crazy.
Browns,34aiup,poru01,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:01:01 2015 UTC,We're essentially giving up the 19th pick to move up 10 spots. Way too much is hyperbole

Browns,34aiup,thatBlackGuy21,4,Wed Apr 29 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"Fuck it let's just get destroyed by the run again next year. We are in a perfect spot to take a great run stopper and help the worst run defense in the league, but no we have to make the big move every damn year."
Browns,34aiup,thatBlackGuy21,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd quite call our position perfect for a run stopper. There's a better than decent chance that Shelton would get picked before us and while at 12 Brown would be a reach, he could still be gone at 19. So it's a tricky balancing act to be sure."
Browns,34aiup,subhuman1,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"Shelton isn't even a great run stopper. Please, fans....stop with all of this about Shelton.  LOOK at how his stats are inflated playing against shit competition. 0.2 sacks a game against his conference. 1.4 sacks a game against their shit NC schedule. Tackles are about the same. Something like 4 per game versus 10 per game IIRC.  Guy is going to be a nice one gap type. You try him as an achor two gap NT in the NFL and you'll get an average or slightly above average style. Not really what you want out of a 12 overall.  Now, play Taylor at nose and let Shelton one gap at the off tackle and that has serious potential."
Browns,34aiup,Abiv23,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"To be fair sacks aren't necessarily indicative of run stopping. That said, you raise an interesting point. Interesting because it seems to fly in the face of most draft analysts I've read (whose opinions I'm more inclined to trust than my own opinion after attempting to watch film).  I'm curious though, who would you rate as the best NT in the draft who would fit that two gap mold? I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure which statistics to look at to determine which type is the better fit for a given player."

Browns,34aiup,Based_RNGesus,2,Wed Apr 29 16:43:00 2015 UTC,This seems like posturing to lower the cost for moving up (but not to #2) there are a lot of teams that want to trade down this year

Browns,34aiup,Doyle524,2,Wed Apr 29 16:52:50 2015 UTC,This sounds a lot like the Titan's trying to start a bidding war.
Browns,34aiup,TemujinRi,2,Wed Apr 29 16:56:40 2015 UTC,Its all nonsense and complete Bullshit. The Titan's source now denies the rumors. Good reporting McManamon. The draft can't get here soon enough.
Browns,34aiup,scsmith83,2,Wed Apr 29 16:58:38 2015 UTC,"Everyone just needs to remember that if we move up to #2 that doesn't mean we are taking Mariota. Leonard Williams is a very real possibility, hell even Cooper is (though I wouldn't jump all the way to #2 for him)."

We have a new offensive coordinator who has worked with Mariotta for months and has spoken very highly on him. Chip Kelly has also come out saying that Mariotta has the potential of winning many Super Bowls in the future.Drafts are crap shoots and sometimes you have to make a high risk move to get a high reward. In 2012 we had 2 first round draft picks (3 and 22) and got Brandon Weeden and Trent Richardson and last year we had two first rounders and got Manziel and Gilbert who as of right now are busts (not that I'm saying both will continue to be in the long run). But sometimes you just have to make a big move in the draft. We need a QB, and right now we have many veterans who can help teach Mariotta on how to be a successful Qb in Josh McCown, Brian Hartline, and Dwayne Bowe. Mariotta ran a 4.52 40 yard dash, a 36"" vertical and a 10'1"" broad jump which are basically receiver numbers. I will be a Browns fan until I die, but we need to change the way out organization runs or else we will continue to have rough years."

Browns,34aiup,ErroneousOnAllCounts,3,Thu Apr 30 06:09:43 2015 UTC,"Farmer makes moves on draft day. This is an expedition and effective smokescreen. If Chip wants Marcus (as do other teams), this information gets leaked. It overvalues our picks and gives the Titans leverage in their negotiation. Also, it just seems as if the Browns are putting out feelers (like the story about pick 5 yesterday).  No legs on this horse.   Edit: is it assumed that we want MM, and not Williams? Who says its for MM? Williams would be incredible on our Defense."
Browns,34aiup,x2skier,2,Wed Apr 29 16:52:11 2015 UTC,Ah man if we move up and snag Williams or Cooper or Beasley I'd be so stoked. I don't wanna do this for Mariota tho.
Browns,34aiup,Iamtrawk,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"What do you guys mainly take issue with? Trading two firsts to move up, taking (yet another) QB in the first round, or Mariota specifically?  I think we just should just stay where we are at and fill two needs with top 20 players in the draft, but I do think Mariota will be a special player."
Browns,34aiup,DaRedBeard,2,Wed Apr 29 16:48:33 2015 UTC,You don't trade away two extremely valuable picks when you have a ton of holes to fill.

Browns,34aiup,RyanG73,0,Wed Apr 29 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"One way or the other, tomorrow is going to be extremely exciting.  Grantlant did an interesting take on Winston, Mariota, Hundley, and Petty today.  The further along we get, the more on-board I am with moving up for Mariota if the opportunity presents itself."
Browns,34aiup,Phungasaur,0,Wed Apr 29 16:38:46 2015 UTC,There is no way Farmer can be this dumb. Mariota doesn't even know how to take a snap under center and thats 90% of what we do! Unless this is some draftday movie shit where we trade up to number two and then get even more picks trading down this is a massively stupid idea.
Browns,34aiup,jvpewster,0,Wed Apr 29 16:49:45 2015 UTC,19 & 12 for Tennessee's 2 and then trade manziel and a second round pick for somebody else's first rounder. Boom now we got Mariota and a NT.
Browns,34aiup,TweetPoster,-1,Wed Apr 29 17:47:39 2015 UTC,So essentially just giving up 1 first rounder? I'm okay with that!
Browns,34b055,TSR3K,5,Wed Apr 29 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"How much is Bennett worth? Because for the right price, I would entertain it."
Browns,34b055,kuss51292,4,Wed Apr 29 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"This time of year, draft picks do the talking."
Browns,34b055,blackedout,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:54:26 2015 UTC,For the right price I'd do it. But over paying for a tight end on the wrong side of 25 isn't the best idea when were atleast few years from truly competing.
Browns,34b055,callmeohio,2,Wed Apr 29 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"Age of decline for a TE is 29, which is their peak. Bennett is 28 this season and under contract until he hits 29. He is also leagues better than what Housler (who is only 1 year younger) has shown so far. He's big, strong, athletic, good hands, good blocking, etc.   I'd love to get him. He is making $5 mil for 2 years, but if you get him and draft a TE it would work, since it usually takes 2-3 years for a TE to hit their stride in the NFL."
Browns,34b055,bearsdriving,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:08:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Best to keep this picks or package them for something better than a 28 year old TE who, until last year, was pretty average.  By the time this team is competing, Bennett will be well into his 30s.  Incidentally, isn't he a free agent in a year, so we could just sign him then (if we really wanted him)?"
Browns,34b055,tomchaney479,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:49:15 2015 UTC,"The purpose of trading for him would be to extend him before he hits the open market. Because of age, I don't think that would be in our best interest. He's no Tony Gonzalez or Anthony Gates."
Browns,34b055,AKlep,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:08:50 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  And agreed that he's not an elite TE.  If the Browns are projected to win, say, 6 games next year, I could see Bennett maybe bumping that up to 7 wins.  Not sure that he's worth giving up a decent asset."
Browns,34b055,tomchaney479,3,Thu Apr 30 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"He is a huge upgrade over not only what we have now, but adding in blocking, he is over Cameron too. Here is the top 48 TE's according to PFF, notice Bennet up at 6 and Housler at 48. Here is a look at Cleveland's TEs last year for reference. I know PFF has their faults, but they quantify players much better than typical stat lines and the big difference should show where we are now and what is out there.  I'm all for it. He costs about $3M more than Housler, is under contract for 2 years, is on the right side of the TE age of decline, and who doesn't love a Black Unicorn?"
Browns,34b055,bearsdriving,3,Wed Apr 29 19:18:30 2015 UTC,I'd give up 115 for him. Maybe even 111.
Browns,34b055,droidworkerbee,2,Wed Apr 29 19:04:01 2015 UTC,"I would throw in a later pick to add him if we trade up to the Bears pick for someone who is dropping.    He's a legit TE in this league, could be a huge acquisition for an OC who likes his tight ends as pass catchers."
Browns,34b055,PrimeTimeHoyer,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:04:36 2015 UTC,I'm all for this! Bennett was on my fantasy team last year and produced even with turnover machine and malcontent Cutler at QB.
Browns,34b055,gleaming-the-cube,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"I'd give up some nice stuff for Bennett. Couple of draft picks or up to a 3rd if they throw in an extra 5 or 6 coming back to us. He is pretty good, and performed very well last year."

Browns,34b055,Deadleggg,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:59:28 2015 UTC,"The 2014 season accounts for nearly a third of his career receptions, yards, and touchdowns.  I'd be more interested had he been consistently good throughout his career.  Looks more like a one year wonder trying to cash in on a very good season."
Browns,34b055,topper_mango,7,Wed Apr 29 19:12:33 2015 UTC,"He spent his first 4 season behind Jason Witten on the depth chart. In 2014 he had 129 targets. His first 4 years, he had a total of 132. Those first four years represent only about 1/4 of his career receptions, yards and TDs.  The three years after that, when he's been TE1, he's has gotten consistently better each year in terms of yards and receptions/target. TDs are about the same and his receptions have grown a lot as his targets have gone up.  When he's spent more career time as a backup than a starter, it doesn't seem to weird to me that his third year of being a starter resulted in around 1/3 of his career stats."

Browns,34c0ov,DJ_GiantMidget,3,Thu Apr 30 03:21:22 2015 UTC,I would be ok with this. Really ok with this. I think he is the best player in this draft and a huge drop off after him.
Browns,34c0ov,DJ_GiantMidget,3,Thu Apr 30 03:27:32 2015 UTC,He's the only way I'd be ok with the trade

Browns,34c0ov,DocAuch,14,Wed Apr 29 23:21:33 2015 UTC,Fuck no on Cardale. Stop viewing everything through scarlet-colored glasses.
Browns,34c0ov,Masterdebater22,3,Wed Apr 29 23:57:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Everybody on this sub is wayyy too far up OSU's ass to realize that Cardale is very unlikely to be a successful NFL QB. Hell, Barrett probably starts for them this year anyway."
Browns,34c0ov,Savante37,9,Thu Apr 30 01:47:11 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate? It's not just this sub that thinks Jones is going to be an NFL stud. Find me a 2016 mock that doesn't have him in the top half of the first round.   I'm not in favor of ever thinking that far ahead (so much stuff could happen between now and then with both Jones and the Browns). But don't act like it's just homers thinking he's a future stud.
Browns,34c0ov,s1l3ntsh4d0w89,7,Thu Apr 30 02:12:15 2015 UTC,"No kidding. He's like Big Ben had a baby with Cam Newton. Physically, he's the entire complete package."
Browns,34c0ov,charbo187,2,Thu Apr 30 04:46:51 2015 UTC,no way barrett starts unless cardale gets hurt or struggles really bad.  dude won the sugar bowl and national championship game.  he is gonna be the starter.

Browns,34c0ov,djroomba322,5,Thu Apr 30 22:25:08 2015 UTC,"I hate this argument.  Even if Johnny is as worse than most people expect, we're still going to end up winning like 4 games, which will not put us with the pick of whatever QB we want.  And a team who needs a QB will take them, and we can't move up to get them.    Plus we wont have 2 first round picks next year.  So if we somehow DO move up, we're going to have to mortgage future first round picks to do so.  Right now we have the ammunition to get it done.  If they think Mariota is their guy, then go fucking get him.  If not, we're in another 3 year rebuild if Manziel isn't good."
Browns,34c0ov,24rubikscube,2,Thu Apr 30 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"If they don't believe in Johnny and they believe in Mariota, its really an easy trade.   I really think we're making the trade."
Browns,34c0ov,TucanJamz,2,Thu Apr 30 02:27:08 2015 UTC,"You make a pretty good point, and I respect that. But I don't think it's the right time to pull the trigger on a QB like Mariota. He'll have pretty much the same learning curve as Manziel, so what's the point of having either if we can't put a good team around them? I'm not calling for an OSU player, I'm all for the Browns grabbing their guy, but the timing isn't right this year in particular because they have a chance to really complete the roster in such a deep draft. A lot of good teams around the league like the Seahawks, Ravens, and the 49ers when they had their runs all have structured rosters where the QB is comfortable enough with the talent around him to be successful even if they're 2nd, 3rd round picks. I think the Browns have a chance to create something like that in this draft, so I don't think that we'd be looking at a 3 year rebuild if the Johnny Football experiment works. Or even if it doesn't work, they'd still have the guys to work in another QB."
Browns,34c0ov,djroomba322,-2,Thu Apr 30 00:19:53 2015 UTC,"He'll have pretty much the same learning curve as Manziel   Well, the big difference is he has NFL size which Manziel doesn't.  He's been a consistent hard worker for his entire life, and Manziel has been a hard worker for 3 days.  His mechanics and footwork, while not amazing is light years ahead of Manziel.  He's ran a gimmick system like Manziel, but he's shown to be a bit higher football IQ.  I personally am not interested in him, but I'm not the GM.  There is no doubt that Mariota is just a better version of Manziel in pretty much every way.  If the GM thinks he's the guy to build around they should get him, although i personally don't want him.   A lot of good teams around the league like the Seahawks, Ravens, and the 49ers when they had their runs all have structured rosters where the QB is comfortable enough with the talent around him to be successful even if they're 2nd, 3rd round picks.   Yes, but they all had great QBs too.  How many superbowls did the seahawks get to without Wilson?  How was that elite Baltimore team with Kyle fucking Boller?    Johnny Football experiment   This is the entire problem.  Good football = consistency.  Not experiments.  NFL games are too precious."
Browns,34c0ov,TucanJamz,3,Thu Apr 30 00:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, but the Seahawks had a similar problem that we had all the way leading up to getting Russel Wilson. They kept taking the best players they could, and tried to figure out the QB spot without selling the farm. They went 7-9 with Tavaris Jackson and Charlie Whitehurst at the helm the year before they got Wilson. That sounds to me a lot like where the Browns are right now.  I just think patience is the best thing with this."
Browns,34c0ov,24rubikscube,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:35:09 2015 UTC,They also desperately spent a ton of money on Matt Flynn. That's desperate. They kinda lucky.
Browns,34c0ov,TucanJamz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:22:25 2015 UTC,"I'd liken it to the McCown signing. Obviously though, with Matt Flynn you had more chips on the table, but they were using all avenues to figure the QB position out. Luck has a lot to do with it, but they maximize their luck by keeping their options open. If they sold the farm for one guy (Like an RGIII), they'd be stuck because they wouldn't've had the picks for guys like Bruce Irvin and Bobby Wagner and forced to give playing time to a guy that isn't getting the job done."
Browns,34c0ov,djroomba322,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"So your argument is they went 7-9 with bad QB play and a good team.  And now we went 7-9 with bad QB play and a good team.  Isn't that the exact argument of ""all we need is a QB"" and patience isn't something we can afford to do?  What if in our patience Mack leaves? And we have to be honest, Thomas is going to start running out of years."
Browns,34c0ov,TucanJamz,3,Thu Apr 30 00:37:27 2015 UTC,"You make great points and you're probably winning the argument right now, but with the progress this team has made last year with very slim offensive weapons at any skill position, the only case I can make is that the Browns are not far away from success even though the cupboard looks pretty empty."
Browns,34c0ov,djroomba322,-1,Thu Apr 30 00:43:16 2015 UTC,"Its not about winning an argument bro.  You make very valid points.  I personally feel probably closer to your opinion than I seem to.  I just feel we need a QB.  And until we solve that, we're not going to be a competitive team.    But yes, we can get a bunch of guys to help.  I would really like to get some impact playmakers because we don't seem to have a lot of those either, which means going QB could be even tougher with no weapons.  We'll find out in like... 22 hours!"
Browns,34c0ov,TucanJamz,2,Thu Apr 30 00:59:18 2015 UTC,"Totally, can't wait for the day when the Browns are competing for something other than draft picks."
Browns,34c0ov,AKlep,2,Thu Apr 30 01:02:46 2015 UTC,"If you think a QB is the missing piece to the puzzle, how do you feel about going after Rivers? Assuming that he is actually available."

Browns,34c0ov,Brokewood,2,Thu Apr 30 05:42:40 2015 UTC,"Even if Johnny is as worse than most people expect, we're still going to end up winning like 4 games   I don't know about that... He did record a whopping 2 passer rating against Cincy. If he's that terribad in all of his starts, we could be in for a #1 overall pick."
Browns,34c0ov,djroomba322,2,Thu Apr 30 01:46:22 2015 UTC,"I think if he's that bad, he won't be the QB all 16 games.  Plus we have enough talent on this team we will win 2-3 games on defense."
Browns,34c0ov,Cats_Boobs_Gameing,2,Thu Apr 30 01:47:52 2015 UTC,Shit this guy is right. IF money manziel aint good in the NFL( IDK if he is he only played 6 quarters) than we will have a shitty old qb ( McCown) and a bust young qb (JFF). HOw the fuck would we get a qb without givign up the farm? I think its now or never for the Browns
Browns,34c0ov,Marzman315,6,Thu Apr 30 01:56:05 2015 UTC,"Very upset. We have two high potential but low floor QBs that we spent a grand total of three first round picks on, our two principle needs, run defense and O-line depth, the two major causes for our dysfunction last season, go completely unaddressed. This would be a disaster as far as I'm concerned. We'll go absolutely nowhere."

Browns,34c0ov,DocAuch,2,Wed Apr 29 23:40:32 2015 UTC,Exactly. Go by the board.  Nothing was worse than someone telling me last year that the Browns should take Hyde and then tank the season to take Braxton.   Holy fuck I wish I could have hit that ignorant fool.
Browns,34c0ov,AKlep,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"The difference is Braxton projects to be a RB/WR in the NFL, while most early 2016 mocks have Jones as a top 15 pick. That doesn't mean that's where he'll be on big boards next year, but the cries for drafting him are more legitimate than cries for Hyde, Braxton, or really anyone else."
Browns,34c0ov,meyer_33_09,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:06:49 2015 UTC,I just have heard the Browns have interest in Devon smith. I don't necessarily want him but I do think he is talented. I'm just playing devils advocate. Farmer has done his job again with keeping everyone guessing again this year. That's a good thing ...??? Haha
Browns,34c0ov,TucanJamz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:32:48 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Smith is talented, but I don't think he is the player the Browns need right now."
Browns,34c0ov,livando1,3,Thu Apr 30 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"I'd be upset. I think the team has too many needs to go all in on offense like that. They have a lot of picks at the top of the draft, and I'd like to see them use as many as they can in such a deep draft. Out of the first two rounds I'd be perfectly content with coming away with a Danny Shelton/Breshad Perriman combo."
Browns,34c0ov,meyer_33_09,3,Wed Apr 29 23:16:51 2015 UTC,Upset. Continue building the defense and ride out the year with Johnny.
Browns,34c0ov,Oskie5272,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:42:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Fill all of the other holes and see what happens. If Johnny works out, great. If not, address QB next year."
Browns,34c0ov,fuckingbrowns,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"I'd rather them trade the 12 and a mid to late round to move up a couple spots and take one of the wrs, then go d line with the second pick. We could even move back up a couple spots to get Shelton. I'd be 100% ok with giving up 2 or 3 mid to late round picks to get these guys."
Browns,34c0ov,dontkillgamefish,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:03:29 2015 UTC,It all depends on whether or not we gave away next year's first.

Browns,34esvn,Spartan_55,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:37:35 2015 UTC,Haha nope just an opinion
Browns,34esvn,tomchaney479,3,Thu Apr 30 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"If nobody else is offering PHI a first for Bradford, why should the Browns?  Moreover, if PHI somehow gets MM, Bradford's value immediately goes down.    We're not here to help PHI get their guy.  If they're desperate enough to get MM, then they'll have to pay a steep price to deal with us and facilitate the trade.    Somewhat related, when the Cavs were about to sign Lebron, they needed to first clear Jarrett Jack's contract.  Boston ended up getting a Cavs first AND Tyler Zeller just for taking Jack.  That's how you drive a hard bargain when a team is desperate."
Browns,34esvn,SnakeLaFleur,2,Thu Apr 30 15:52:44 2015 UTC,"If trading a first round pick for Bradford, the key is what else is coming along with Bradford. I'd bet anything (except my son) that Bradford straight up for a 1st rounder isn't happening.  Personally, I'd be ok with Kiko Alonso coming over in such a trade, but thats just me..."
Browns,34esvn,Stowcenter93,2,Thu Apr 30 15:59:31 2015 UTC,Bradford and Kiko? I'd do that.
Browns,34esvn,Godszn,2,Thu Apr 30 15:44:26 2015 UTC,Honestly this is the weirdest part about the whole Mariota situation. He's basically Johnny Manziel but a bit taller and less off the field concerns. Why would we trade 3 1st rounders for that?
Browns,34esvn,tomchaney479,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm in favor of trading up, but I don't think you can overstate how different they are off the field.  One is a 10/10 in intangibles/ work ethic while the other (up to this point) is a 1/10.  If Manning/Brady had Manziel's off the field habits and work ethic, they probably wouldn't have made it in the NFL."
Browns,34esvn,whodeeya,0,Thu Apr 30 16:04:11 2015 UTC,Because Manziel's biggest problems are his height and off the field concerns.
Browns,34esvn,ohennwen,2,Thu Apr 30 16:16:48 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Stick with our project QB. My dream scenario tonight is us trading up to 3 to grab Leonard Williams, assuming the QBs go 1 and 2. A huge injection into our already capable defense would take so much pressure off of Johnny / McCown to do it all."
Browns,34b8n8,Abiv23,12,Wed Apr 29 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"So is today, like, ""Open Floodgates"" Day?  This isn't so much gloom and doom news, but it is really odd timing."
Browns,34b8n8,JohnnyFire,3,Wed Apr 29 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"Tomorrow when we draft Shelton and Peat or Parker and Goldman or whatever, all these dopes will be strutting around like they knew the Browns plan all along."

Browns,34b8n8,Nightcinder,0,Thu Apr 30 04:43:59 2015 UTC,My point is that everyone is straining themselves to conjure up some ridiculous trade scenario when most likely we'll just take a safe combination of BPA/Need.
Browns,34b8n8,Marzman315,2,Thu Apr 30 14:34:19 2015 UTC,I can easily see us trading up with the Redskins and nabbing Cooper or Fowler
Browns,34b8n8,Nightcinder,6,Thu Apr 30 14:35:32 2015 UTC,"The rumor mill has always said that we were prepared to take Watkins until the Bills offered up the 2015 first-round pick, that we were targeting Evans but he went right before our pick, and that we made offers to several teams to get back up to get OBJ.  Kind of poo-poos the whole ""Farmer won't draft a WR in the first round"" thing, but who knows how much of it is true."

Browns,349wy4,subhuman1,10,Wed Apr 29 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"I think this is a big part of it. If he sustains his success, pay the man. I'm reminded of the Indians not extending Justin Masterson and that looking like a genius move."
Browns,349wy4,droidworkerbee,3,Wed Apr 29 13:59:12 2015 UTC,"It is definitely a smart business decision. It's good that both parties are working towards it, too."
Browns,349wy4,rsipp512,6,Wed Apr 29 15:39:45 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to how much he is requesting. We have the cap space and safeties are cheap compared to corners.
Browns,349wy4,Mustang1718,4,Wed Apr 29 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"If he wants top safety money (e.g., Weddle), that's around $10MM.  I imagine the Browns don't want to pay him much more than they are Whitner ($6-7MM)."
Browns,349wy4,TapedeckNinja,5,Wed Apr 29 14:21:02 2015 UTC,"Which as of right now if completely fair. He should just sign a one-year prove-it deal. He comes in and plays at that level for a whole year he gets top money because he earned it. But he is coming off his breakout year with a major knee injury, he ain't getting top money yet."
Browns,349wy4,Daviroth,4,Wed Apr 29 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"He should just sign a one-year prove-it deal.   To be fair, injury is also the reason he wouldn't want this."
Browns,349wy4,schmittc,3,Wed Apr 29 14:51:20 2015 UTC,"I know he doesn't want to at all. But I'm sure the Browns have offered a one year prove-it deal OR a long term deal at like 5-6 mil. He either takes the lower money, the prove it deal, or plays a year on the tender contract and leaves the team."
Browns,349wy4,Daviroth,3,Wed Apr 29 15:02:25 2015 UTC,I don't see why we couldn't just offer an incentive laden contract. Lower on the guaranteed money than a star safety would pull but with performance options built in to still pay him big if he succeeds. Best of both worlds I'd think. Lock him up for another few years and still show goodwill towards him.
Browns,349wy4,poru01,2,Wed Apr 29 17:24:21 2015 UTC,THIS WOULD BE FUCKING IDEAL!! LET GIPSON HAVE TO PROVE HE CAN STAY HEALTHY AND PLAY AT A HIGH LEVEL. IF HE DOES THAN YOU GIVE HIM A BLANK CHECK AND HAVE HIM FILL IN THE NUMBERS.
Browns,349wy4,Cats_Boobs_Gameing,2,Thu Apr 30 02:01:11 2015 UTC,WHY ARE WE YELLING?
Browns,349wy4,professor_tappensac,2,Thu Apr 30 02:13:15 2015 UTC,I DONT KNOW WHAT WE ARE YELLING ABOUT
Browns,349wy4,Cats_Boobs_Gameing,3,Thu Apr 30 06:57:37 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. The Browns probably want to see he hasn't lost a step and that last year wasn't just a freak aberration. I'm sure if he starts the season like he did last year, doesnt get injured, and continues the coverage he was doing,  that he'll get a nice far contract after this season."
Browns,349wy4,normalism,3,Wed Apr 29 15:07:57 2015 UTC,And that is exactly why he's going to hold out.  Its in his best interest if the Browns aren't willing to negotiate.

Now she thinks that the Browns would trade up to get Mariota, and she has said that since January."

Browns,349w2f,moodyfloyd,8,Thu Apr 30 08:52:07 2015 UTC,"If they aren't involving the 2nd first from this year, it tells me they would be packaging our 2nd rounder and next year's first most likely at least. I call BS on this. I just can't see Farmer trading up for a WR after he passed on Watkins last year. I could see him taking one at 12 but not trading up for Cooper or White. Sit back and wait for Parker to fall in our laps at 12 hopefully."
Browns,349w2f,n813,4,Thu Apr 30 13:10:13 2015 UTC,"Remember...Farmer said that if Buffalo didn't offer that lucrative deal for the #4 pick that they would've stayed put at #4 and taken Watkins. I believe that Ray Farmer values WR's, even though last years draft suggested that he didn't."
Browns,349w2f,kuss51292,5,Wed Apr 29 13:40:02 2015 UTC,But does he value them enough to essentially make the same deal that Buffalo did but this time for Amare Cooper?
Browns,349w2f,n813,0,Wed Apr 29 14:25:39 2015 UTC,"There are more factors to consider here.  Did Farmer like his options enough at Buffalo's spot to justify making the move last year?  Does Farmer now not like his options as much at 12/19 and want to move up into a better talent pool because he thinks it's more worthwhile to be up in that spot this year than last?    Different players in a different year's draft, can't just say it's because he values a certain position group or not."
Browns,349w2f,miked1be,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:49:46 2015 UTC,Still stupid to waste picks on an offensive supporting cast when you don't have the star. We need a qb first before we worry about anything else.

That was a really bad draft class, so a similar move this year will be pricier, but if Winston/Mariota/Williams are off the board, I can see us getting up near the top 5 without having to give up multiple first-round picks.  Something like #12 + #43 + #111 might get it done, or maybe even #19 + #43 + #77."
Browns,349w2f,TapedeckNinja,3,Wed Apr 29 22:44:41 2015 UTC,I'd be okay with Cooper.
Browns,349w2f,Nightcinder,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"Not so sure I would want that.  We have serviceable WRs now- they're not great, nor elite, but good.  Pulling all our eggs into one basket to pull Cooper tells us that the other glaring holes (NT,  Pass rusher, maybe an OL) are less important to maintaining a winning season.  I mean:  we have these FA vets that can do the job, mentor a 2d or 3d round WR, and allow us to fill these other vital needs.  If we do get Cooper, we'll miss out on great talent.  I am ALL in on the Shelton Hype Train. I'd consider, albeit briefly, trying to move up say,..3 slots, just to get him- he's that good.  Man, a first round with Shelton and say,..Jaelen Strong or Devante Parker would be an A+ in my opinion."
Browns,349w2f,DocMichaels,2,Wed Apr 29 13:51:30 2015 UTC,"A couple counterpoints.  We are trying to keep the second first rounder, so we still would be picking twice in the first round, and who says we don't trade up from 19 to grab somebody?  My problem with Shelton is that he is not a 2-gap tackle, he is a one-gap/off tackle so he isn't the perfect fit everyone has been hoping for.  We would still get an elite-level talent at 19."
Browns,349w2f,Nightcinder,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:08:08 2015 UTC,"I'd be extremely surprised if we were able to wheel and deal AND keep the second pick.    Even the talking heads on NFLN and ESPN say we have trade potential, and their hot air almost assuredly involved trading 12 & 19."
Browns,349w2f,DocMichaels,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:11:13 2015 UTC,Why not get an elite WR to help Johnny out? The last consistent really good WR we've had was Webster Slaughter...
Browns,349w2f,24rubikscube,2,Wed Apr 29 14:18:00 2015 UTC,"Because, and this is just my view of play styles, we can have good-but-not-elite WR who are serviceable threats with competent QB play, fill holes that are more pressing, and have a second pick or second round WR come in and learn the ropes behind two FA vets.    WR by their nature are divas, especially top their ones.  Look at Josh Gordon.  His me first mentality really hindered us last year, and benefit us not at all, this year.  So, I guess I see talented good WR in the draft behind the ""top three"" that would benefit us more.    Drafting a very good DL, shores up our defense in a very good way.  32 of 32 against the run hurt. A lot! We need to be able to not lose games before we need to be able to win them, so to speak.  Someone else said it earlier that teams realized we couldn't defend the run, and proceeded to run all over us."
Browns,349w2f,DocMichaels,3,Wed Apr 29 15:54:14 2015 UTC,I have inside sources that I'm going this isn't going to happen. My source is that Booms says it will.
Browns,349w2f,misterowen,2,Wed Apr 29 16:09:34 2015 UTC,This isn't happening. Makes more sense to sit tight at 12 and hope for Kevin White.
Browns,349w2f,Fred_Zeppelin,4,Wed Apr 29 13:38:39 2015 UTC,"Like I said in another thread and got downvoted to hell, the Browns are likely to trade up, I think with the Raiders at 4. Everyone says bullshit because I don't think it's going to be as expensive as others believe, but according to NFL Network Analysts and ESPN, at least 4 teams in the top 10 would rather trade down for more picks. I honestly believe the Browns move up into the top 5 and only trade 1 of our 2 first round picks. (1-2 midround picks as well,)"
Browns,349w2f,TemujinRi,2,Wed Apr 29 15:35:37 2015 UTC,I kinda hope we do. We have enough depth now that it's time to get some playmakers. We have a million picks. I think we'll move up too.
Browns,349w2f,24rubikscube,2,Wed Apr 29 13:58:06 2015 UTC,Williams at 4 would make my day.
Browns,349w2f,Doyle524,2,Wed Apr 29 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"Mine too. He's the kind of firestarter that mixed with the already decent rotation would make our D beautiful. Beast D-line play frees up the Linebackers, allows Haden and Williams to man Press with Gipson roaming and making INTs and Whitner mostly out of coverage and leaving runners with snot bubbles.."
Browns,349w2f,TemujinRi,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:53:49 2015 UTC,I agree. I highly doubt we stay at 12.
Browns,349w2f,nizule,3,Thu Apr 30 14:19:38 2015 UTC,Chuck Boom's source is some bottom in Lakewood....( not that there's anything wrong w/ that)
Browns,349w2f,RP336,2,Wed Apr 29 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't make sense  to move up. We are not a wr away from being a good offense. We are a QB, wr, TE, and rg/rt away from being a good offense."
Browns,349w2f,shicken684,2,Wed Apr 29 15:13:16 2015 UTC,It makes sense to move up if the price is right.  You act like they're going to spend the farm to move up.  I think they'll make a nice value move somewhere.
Browns,349w2f,themitey1,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:44:23 2015 UTC,Trading up 2 or 3 spots for our two fourths might be worth while if someone like cooper falls to 9 or 10.  I just don't see it though.  This is seemingly a pretty deep draft and I'd much rather use those fourths and a third to move back into the second.  Trading up in the first is just so damn costly.
Browns,349w2f,shicken684,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:13:44 2015 UTC,"12, 19, 4th, and a 6th. We get the 5 and the 34.   We end up with 5, 34 and 37(and a pick in 3,4,5,6,7 too)"
Browns,349w2f,subhuman1,2,Wed Apr 29 15:18:31 2015 UTC,We are trying to keep 19.
Browns,349w2f,Nightcinder,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:08:58 2015 UTC,Not a bad scenario at all.  I don't really love the guys on the board at #19 in most mocks.  If we could nab Cooper at #5 and then get Armstead/Brown/Goldman at #34 and someone like Maxx Williams or even a guy like Gregory or Ray if they fall at #43 ... that'd be pretty sweet.
Browns,349w2f,TapedeckNinja,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:11:32 2015 UTC,Good. Cooper is one the top 5 studs in this draft. The only problem is that Jacksonville and Oakland at 3/4 might also want Cooper. Let's see what magic Farmer can work.
Browns,349w2f,nizule,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"Sigh.... fucking Booms. I hate that radio show. In fact, I hate everyone on that radio station besides Andy Baskin, Jeff Phelps and Ken Carman. That being said, I would be okay with trading up for Cooper, if the price is right."

Browns,34cdcl,kuss51292,8,Thu Apr 30 01:05:19 2015 UTC,Wilbon basically said the Browns will never draft a good QB and our interest in Marriota makes him believe that he will be a bust.
Browns,34cdcl,supaloco,8,Thu Apr 30 01:14:18 2015 UTC,Bomani Jones echoed this on ESPN radio. He said Mariotta's draft stock will sink because the Browns are even interested in him. Wtf.

Browns,347chh,sil0,0,Thu Apr 30 05:44:16 2015 UTC,"Let's see if Joe is still saying this after a year or two.  Lifestyle changes are hard to make and harder to stick to - it's not nearly as hard to commit to rehab and deal with your issues as it is to stick with it.  How many people do you know who signed up for the gym to lose some weight and 3 months later they're back where they were, sitting on the couch watching TV every night?  Old habits die hard.  Johnny has always had character issues and it only takes one moment of weakness for him to start spiraling back into the hole which he's trying to escape right now."

Browns,34arto,TemujinRi,2,Wed Apr 29 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's going to be too much, but I'm in the minority. Consistent reports have been at least 4 teams would rather move out of the top 10 and get more draft picks than take someone in the top 10. I believe Houston will make the first trade, trading Pick 16, DJ Swearinger and at least 1 other pick in the first 4 rounds this year to the Titans for pick 2. After that I think the Browns trade with the Raiders and draft Cooper @ 4. (Edit:) PSA NFL Network advertized a 1 on 1 with Coach Pettine today @ 4, so maybe we'll get a little insight into his thoughts going into tomorrow nights draft. I doubt it though, the mans poker face is solid.)"

Browns,349v6f,JohnnyFire,6,Wed Apr 29 13:27:02 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, the trade chart is based on the subjective value teams placed on picks in trades prior to the '80s when the Cowboys developed the chart. So its using valuation of picks from the '70s and '80s, but now young players on rookie contracts are worth more because the restrictive salary cap.   Over the Cap has a proposed new chart based on AV from PFR during the first 4 years of a player's career. According to the chart, pick 1.5 is worth 800 points, and pick 2.11(43rd overall pick) is worth 390 points. This means that 2nd round pick is just barely half as valuable as the 5th overall pick, but the old chart valued 5th overall at 3.6 times 43rd overall.  As an interesting aside according to rookie contract AV, in terms of average contract cost to performance value provided, the best picks in the draft are in order picks 33, 34, 35, 36, 65, 66, 37, 38, so top of the 2nd is best, and tip top of the 3rd is also really good."

Browns,3480c6,brickfrenzy,8,Wed Apr 29 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"Our 12th overall pick is the perfect spot for a team to move up for Todd Gurley (If he doesn't go top 10). The teams looking to move up could include the Chargers at 17, Cardinals at 24, or Cowboys at 27. The trade down scenario that I would like to see would be to trade down to one of these, and I will use the Cardinals for my example. I would like to get another second rounder and swap first rounders.  1st round: 19-Breshad Perriman                24-Malcom Brown/Eddie Goldman  2nd round: 43-ILB or Maxx Williams                55- Ali Marpet  OR  1st round: 19- Breshad Perriman                24-Cameron Erving  2nd round: 43- ILB or Maxx Williams                55- Michael Bennett  My ideal trade up scenarios would involve Mariota, Leonard Williams, or Amari Cooper, but I would not move up in any circumstance if it involved next year's first rounder.  Edit: I will probably get inundated with downvotes because I do like the potential of Perriman over Jaelan Strong or Agholor, but I couldn't care less."
Browns,3480c6,nizule,4,Wed Apr 29 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold on Perriman either, but certainly won't down vote you for this idea. I think there's merit to a scenario like you described.

Browns,3480c6,nizule,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:07:51 2015 UTC,It would probably be a deal that would happen while the Jets were on the clock to ensure a player the Browns would move up for is there.

Browns,3480c6,nizule,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would expect Mariota to go at #2 as well. However, if the Titans have their bluff called and no one pays their kings ransom I think they could end up keeping the pick and taking Leonard Williams. In that scenario though, I would expect someone to trade up to 4 or 5 and get Mariota. If that team happens to be the Browns, then my Jets/Wilkerson scenario goes out the window."
Browns,3480c6,SnakeLaFleur,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:43:41 2015 UTC,at first i thought to myself this would never happen- after looking at trade value chart the 12 and 19 are worth more than the #6 by about a late first rounder (31 or 32). It's plausible boys!!

Browns,3480c6,SnakeLaFleur,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"they would probably want more- the 2nd should do it, or maybe a 3 or 4. It all depends on how far apart the jets and wilk are on contract numbers, and we'd have to be willing to give him a top 3 DE3-4 contract."
Browns,3480c6,this_is_my_reddit_UN,6,Wed Apr 29 12:48:24 2015 UTC,Use 12 and 19 for best available players(no QB or RB) possible trade up to a late 1st round if a great player falls. The Pats love trading down.
Browns,3480c6,Spartan_55,3,Wed Apr 29 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"Personally I think trading up is fine for the right price, but if Mariota falls to 12 we gotta jump ship and get all we can from the Eagles. I'm also cool with trading down from 19. I believe that the more picks you have, the more likely you are to have success in the draft."
Browns,3480c6,felisrufus,2,Wed Apr 29 02:04:36 2015 UTC,Anything that involves us trading #12 back no farther than the #19 and getting another 1st round next year.

Browns,3480c6,TapedeckNinja,2,Wed Apr 29 11:29:35 2015 UTC,"Right now, this doesn't look like a particularly strong draft class at the top.  We might be able to trade up to get someone like Williams or Beasley for a pretty fair price (maybe #12 + #43 + a late pick).  I wouldn't hate that scenario.  Really, though, I'm just hoping they consolidate their picks and move around at need.  If we could get another pick or two in the first two rounds by trading away some or all of the seven picks we have in rounds 3-7, I'd be ecstatic.  How much could we get out of a third, two fourths, a fifth, two sixths, and a seventh?  Not to mention, we might consider parting with a fourth or fifth round pick from 2016 since we will have compensatory picks coming."
Browns,3480c6,droidworkerbee,2,Wed Apr 29 04:22:33 2015 UTC,"I think we will pick at 12 or 19, but not both, and not neither.  In a scenario where the following players are drafted 1-11 (not necessarily in this order): Winston, Mariota, Williams, Fowler, Cooper, White, Parker, Beasley, Shelton, Scherff, and Dupree, we deal to someone (Miami, Houston, Detroit) for Gurley, moving us back in the round and getting something. I think there is a chance we take him there but Farmer will listen to offers and might get a good one from say Houston (12 for 16, 82, and 152) or Detroit (12 and 115 for 23, 54, and 88).  I honestly don't see us moving up because most of the people I listed could help us, and there is a good chance one of them falls to us (if Gurley, Gregory, etc go before we pick)."
Browns,3480c6,shicken684,2,Wed Apr 29 11:13:34 2015 UTC,I'm hoping mariota falls to 12 and the Eagles pounce. Trade us pick 20 and thier first next year. I don't see it happening though.

Browns,3480c6,_SilkyJohnson,3,Wed Apr 29 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"I don't see White being there.

Somehow they kept it under the social media radar, but Crowell flew up to Baltimore this offseason to get some workouts in with West, and, in turn, West flew down to Atlanta.  That pact? Both Crowell and West want to rush for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns.  “That’s the plan,” Crowell said. “Both of us want the ball and I think both of us have what it takes to play in the NFL for a long time. I’m happy he’s with me. We plan on doing some big things.”   And Also:   We’re still more than four months away from an NFL regular season game, so Crowell will have time to become a master of the playbook. And, in the meantime, he dropped a little bombshell of his own: He’s been working on a touchdown celebration.  “You will see a dance this year,” Crowell said, with an emphatic roar of laughter."
Browns,345kpw,theband65,8,Tue Apr 28 14:07:51 2015 UTC,Hell yeah that was awesome to hear. I like both our backs and think we can have a solid running game with them. My only fear is that one or both of them hits a sophomore slump.
Browns,345kpw,moodyfloyd,7,Tue Apr 28 14:24:02 2015 UTC,that one or both of them hits a sophomore slump.   i think most of the time this happens when a player is so great their first year they get in their own head and think they don't have to put that extra effort in the second year. sounds like the exact opposite with our RB's.

Browns,345kpw,JohnStamosBRAH,2,Tue Apr 28 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't for his 'character issues' in college, he would've been rated much higher than West in last years draft, so I wouldn't be too surprised if he makes the jump."
Browns,345kpw,theband65,6,Tue Apr 28 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"I think the ""rookie wall"" for Crow was more about the entire offense going down the drain. Sure he wasn't breaking open plays on his own but he wasn't getting much help elsewhere. Also West had a killer game against the ravens on the last game of the year and if i recall correctly he was the only bright spot on offense that day. I'm not sure what my point is other than i hope both guys succeed."
Browns,345kpw,bearsdriving,4,Tue Apr 28 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"Crowell's problem wasn't breaking away, it was getting away after being touched.   Out of every RB who was in 25% of the time, he was the least elusive by far and conversely the 5th best at breakaways. He is classic boom or bust, which I think most people are assuming he improves on this season (his fantasy ADP certianly shows that).   The issue is with Crowell, who I love. He was raw as hell last year and his stats show it. Football Outsiders use stats called DVOA and Success Rate where DVOA is a measure of value of the player per play and Success Rate is whether the player got the yards needed or expected given the down and circumstance.  Andre Williams: -11.4 DVOA and 38% SR. A RB that puts up a lot of bad yards.  Matt Asiata: 1.0 DVOA but 52% SR. What a RB that moves the chains looks like.  Isaiah Crowell: -3.6 DVOA and 44% SR. What a boom or bust RB looks like.  Him being so raw makes it hard to see how he'll transition into this year, if he is bad at getting away or if he just needs time and practice. If he can work on that I think he could be great."

Imo, it would be ridiculous if we blow everything for Mariota only to put him in a 50/50 battle against Manziel for starting QB all through training camp and preseason. If we were to give up everything for Mariota, we better be spending all of our resources on him to make sure he's ready day 1."

Maybe that's part of what makes him interesting. No one deserved to be smacked around, but his now ex-wife doesn't sound like such a peach either.  Mostly what irks me is his man-love for Bernie Kosar. I want to break the radio every time he suggests that Bernie ought to be in the front office or something. Bernie was a good QB, but that does not mean he'd be good at anything else, and as it turns out, objectively, he's been pretty bad at everything else he's done since he retired from playing football. Why wreck it further by setting him up to fail in the front office, where, once he gets fired, as all front office people eventually do, the inevitable shit storm will brew even worse than when he got let go as the pre-season color commentator.  TL;DR Rizzo is interesting if not nice, I'm more annoyed by his blind love of Bernie Kosar."

Browns,345kc5,JohnnyFire,9,Tue Apr 28 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"Here is why I don't think the Browns should draft Shelton. First of a lot of experts have said that he is primarily a 2 down player, which is a bit concerning to me. Also Uncle Phil already said that he is moving back to is natural position at NT. Also i feel like Shelton ran a 5.64 40 time. Let's compare to people in the nfl now, Suh 4.98, Wilfork 5.08, Marcell Dareus 4.93, Poe 4.93, if we want to draft a potential pro-bowl caliber NT/DT i dont think Shelton is it"
Browns,345kc5,NebsLaw,15,Tue Apr 28 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"When Shelton has to run 40 yards to catch a running back I'll worry about his 40 time. What we need is a big strong bastard to swallow up linemen and disrupt running lanes, not a sack machine. We have decent pass rush talent already. Shelton is exactly that. Is he a bit overvalued at 12? Probably but I'd still be happy with the pick because it addresses our key need overall (run defense). And if he falls to 19 then the value is there as well. Taylor is too injury prone to rely on, and having Shelton allows frequent rotation."
Browns,345kc5,Marzman315,3,Tue Apr 28 14:30:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed, especially wrt Taylor's injury history."
Browns,345kc5,obijuan45,3,Tue Apr 28 14:37:03 2015 UTC,"This is the most concerning thing in all of this to me. Taylor isn't reliable to be a full-year starter anymore.  He's missed at least one game every year the past 3 seasons. Yes, his first year, he had a large number of tackles (59), 4 sacks and some solid defense, but since then, Phil has missed 20 out of 48 possible games. He's put up less than his total tackles in that first year (50), he's put up less sacks than in that first year (3)...maybe he does some good things as a teammate, but on the field, he isn't some kind of elite, irreplaceable talent for us. John Hughes is better. Billy Winn (in some situations) is better."

Browns,345kc5,ErroneousOnAllCounts,2,Wed Apr 29 12:30:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and more than likely based on how so many guys are climbing up the board (Gurley, Peat, Waynes, Perriman, Strong etc.) I expect Shelton to be available at 19 anyway. Maybe we trade back our 12 and get a pick at 16 or 17, which gives us a ton of picks to move back into the first later in the 20s"

Browns,345kc5,Marzman315,2,Tue Apr 28 16:49:54 2015 UTC,I don't have doubts about Shelton at all but his critics point out his ability to rush the passer. To which I say even if it were legitimate criticism it doesn't matter too much considering the role he'd be playing.
Browns,345kc5,obijuan45,5,Tue Apr 28 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"I think your view is valid, particularly the point about Uncle Phil. I still disagree. =) Shelton isn't running 40 yards downfield to make a tackle often. His 3-cone and 20yd-ss compare much more favorably to Wilfork, and the guy has a 30+ inch vertical despite weighing 339. He's explosive, eats blockers, immediately provides a presence that an interior running game must account for or get blown up, and lets our LBs avoid blockers more easily. I'd insta-draft him at 12 unless someone really slides. He's a steal at 19 I think."
Browns,345kc5,moodyfloyd,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"i just dont see how he drops to 19 though. if we use 19 to trade up to get him, either before or after 12, im all for it."

Browns,345kc5,brownsfantb,2,Wed Apr 29 00:15:26 2015 UTC,We don't really need a 3 down lineman. Shelton's job would be to make sure they don't get 4-5 (or 10-11) yards a carry on 1st and 2nd down to put them in a passing situation on 3rd down. The linemen on our roster right now are capable of playing in a 3rd and long situation.

Browns,345kc5,Marzman315,2,Wed Apr 29 10:14:23 2015 UTC,"I've said it a couple times but I'll bet the house that we get Kevin White. I think his low floor compared to Cooper and Parker will cause him to drop a touch and the Browns will either snatch him at twelve or trade up to nine or ten to take him. Bowe and Hartline eliminate the need for an immediate day one impact starter, and White can take his time and develop alongside Manziel (or whatever QB we select next year if you disagree with my opinion that Manziel will progress nicely this year, and that's perfectly fine) and gradually move up the depth chart as his development allows. He is an absolutely perfect pick for us at this point in time."
Browns,345kc5,poru01,2,Tue Apr 28 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"I would be stoked to see this happen. I just don't know that teams be able to look past his athleticism. I do think he'll be the second receiver to go, but this draft is stocked with enough talent on the defensive side, that's it's feasible I think for him to still fall to the Browns at 12 if there ends up being a run on defensive players."
Browns,345kc5,masterblaster009,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"Really? I can't put my finger on it but I'm just not a huge fan of his. I'd say he's worth it if he drops, but I wouldn't be happy trading up for him."
Browns,345kc5,poru01,2,Tue Apr 28 23:43:50 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I agree there. Honestly I'm fairly against trading up in general. There just aren't that many players who I see as being worth two starters (which I would consider any pick third round or higher to ideally be).
Browns,345om3,z722,10,Tue Apr 28 14:36:07 2015 UTC,"Smith is a pure burner who just runs straight-line routes. As a result, he's pretty damn raw.  It's nice to think highly of OSU guys but we have to keep in mind that he's more than likely not going to be a pure WR1; in fact, he'd probably end up being yet another guy who could line up in the slot since he doesn't have elite size. He could contribute, but I don't know if he's  any particularly better than any other specific player we could have in the 3rd (mainly, the potential Jaelen Stong fall, Nelson Agholor, or others.)  I wouldn't be opposed to it but I would way more like nabbing Smith in the third if we could."
Browns,345om3,JohnnyFire,3,Tue Apr 28 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"mainly, the potential Jaelen Stong fall, Nelson Agholor, or others.   neither of those will fall past the second and more than likely both go tail end of first."
Browns,345om3,moodyfloyd,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:09:03 2015 UTC,"So we assume.  I think the fall of Gregory and Ray is going to bump up some priorities at WR, yes, but it may also cause some bidding at the late half of the first to get the two, and possibly even some EDGE rushers and pure DE/pure LB prospects who may not have gone in the first otherwise. That would easily move the sticks on Strong/Agholor into the second, where we could trade up to grab them.  And obviously, I don't know. I just know I'd prefer aiming at those two. It isn't like I don't like Smith, it's just I would prefer one of them."

Browns,347far,TemujinRi,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:59:55 2015 UTC,I see him as a 25-35 pick talent in this draft. So we either reach a little at 19 or we pray he falls to 43.  Hard to argue with speed/talent like this at 43. At 19? Depends who else is there really.
Browns,347far,subhuman1,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:15:32 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree in thinking that Dorsett will be good in the league. However I don't think he's the type of receiver that we need. We have some little guys who are weapons in Hawkins and Gabriel, and I think we need a bigger guy. Manziel is a young QB and having a big target for him to throw to would help him a lot. Because of this I reeealllly want Devante Parker. If neither him, White, or Cooper are available I think they should pass on a receiver at 12 and get one at 19. And at 19 I would want Perriman, or Agholor since they are bigger than Dorsett. Not to say that I'd be angry if the Browns took him, but I think there might be 1 or 2 better options.

Bradford is in the final year of his contract, which will pay him $13 million this season.   Sam probably wouldn't sign in Cleveland, awesome. Let's move on?   The Browns' interest in Bradford is crucial for the Eagles, as they could try to flip the quarterback for one of the Browns' first-round picks (No. 12 or No. 19), and then use that pick in a package to land Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota.   So basically, this whole rumor is now on the backs of Eagles--flip-Bradford-for-Mariota supporters, and not Cleveland, is what I gather here.   While Bradford has not commented publicly on the idea of playing in Cleveland, it doesn't seem like he (or his agent) have the greatest relationship with the Browns.  Cabot writes:  When Mike Holmgren wanted to conduct a private workout with Bradford in 2010, he was turned down, a source said. Condon has not had good experiences with his quarterbacks in Cleveland, and likely doesn't want Bradford to end up here. What's more, there's still some tension between the Browns and Condon after Cleveland recently thought they had a deal with him for Jordan Cameron, who ultimately signed with Miami instead.  Would the Browns decide to simply ignore Bradford's reported hesitations about going to Cleveland, and simply make a deal for the quarterback they have interest in?   A: No."

Condon has not had good experiences with his quarterbacks in Cleveland, and likely doesn't want Bradford to end up here.   If we're to believe this is true, this is insane / frustratingly maddening.  Not a single person in a position of power, from the owner on down, remains from Holmgren's era, let alone the time BEFORE Holmgren.  So does that mean Condon has beef with the fans and / or the climate created by them?  I mean, I assume most of this is baseless garbage anyway."
Browns,3474x9,draino3112,2,Tue Apr 28 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"I mean, I assume most of this is baseless garbage anyway.   Except it's not crazy to think that she has a relationship with Condon and this info is coming from somewhere."
Browns,3474x9,bad_master,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:24:23 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the workout was turned down because Bradford knew he was going to be drafted #1 regardless. This might be a common thing. Looks like Winston has only worked out for the Bucs and Titans, and that's because there's 2 QBs at the top of this draft."
Browns,342z5g,cptcinnamonbun,12,Mon Apr 27 22:10:29 2015 UTC,"It's funny because a lot of what he says in the video is kind of the opposite of what he's shown in the NFL so far.    In the preseason Pettine said publicly that they were disappointed because West kind of took his foot off the accelerator because he knew he was already on the team and took that for granted Week 6 he was benched for taking snaps off and not trying to sell fake handoffs He didn't learn his lesson from week 6 because he was benched again in week 16 because of bad practice habits.    I think the dude is talented as hell and could be great, but the thing he touts in this video is actually his biggest hindrance to being great right now."
Browns,342z5g,bearsdriving,1 point,Tue Apr 28 10:42:47 2015 UTC,"I think Pettine is one smart mother fucker that understands coaching absolutely, and he has shown that he isn't afraid to Bench players if he thinks it will get results from them. I think he is managing this talented rookie running back by giving him a bop on the nose once in a while in order to keep him motivated and working hard. He wants a competition for RB1 between Crowell and West. To me you get that by Inspiring the guy who has a few struggles but doing his best (Crowell with fumble issues but electric runs) and by making the guy who is being consistent try and show that he is a beast (West with good YAC and making him fight for bigger plays). That would be my two cents on the matter. I do think that public comments and the like can have a huge impact on certain players to make them feel like they have to work harder to sort of prove the coach wrong."

Browns,343r5h,randyc87,3,Tue Apr 28 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered the ripple effect that Shane Ray just created. His stock dropping is going to create value in the picks before us, as well as shift how the picks will shake down. This is going to be bad news for us due to a classic case of opportunity cost.  I'll start with how this will possibly affect our shot at Danny Shelton as he seems to be our subreddit's realistic favorite. Shelton seems to be an interesting case as he seems to fit into both 3-4 and 4-3 schemes. A team that was hunting for a pass rusher might take a look at Shelton if they run a 4-3 (such as the Giants at #9) as he will be much less risky than Gregory or Ray. This puts us in a weird spot as other targets for us such as Mariota, Parker, or a top OT might go earlier with Ray and Gregory dropping. Do we take a shot on one of the pass rushers here as their value is starting to increase? Do we reach a bit on a secondary need like OT or to a lesser-quality WR? It gets murky here for us.  The other problem is that this draft is already seen as having a very shallow pool of elite talent. Gregory and Ray dropping makes this problem even worse. It means that other teams will be itching to trade up as well, which increases our cost to do so. Then if we do trade up, what do we go for? Cooper/White? Shelton? Mariota? Trade up even further for Williams? Trading down for us won't be that viable of an option as the elite talent will be gone around the top ~5-8 picks.  Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if we end up with Gregory or Ray on draft day if Shelton goes before us. Guys like Perriman scares me to death, and it is too much of a reach to take someone like Strong at #12.  TL;DR: Two high end pass rushers dropping is all-around shit for us and drops our chance of landing Shelton."

Not that I thought White or Cooper would fall to us at 12 (a man can dream can't he?), there was a possibility of the run on defensive linemen in which case we could have moved up from 12 to say 9 or 10 for potentially one of these guys, instead of a whole ransom of picks to get to 5-7.

Browns,342ved,RealFuryous,18,Tue Apr 28 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"If you think Cardale will be ready for the NFL next year you are crazy. He is going to need a year or two to sit before he even has a chance. All Cardale has on Mariota is size and arm strength. I don't understand this sub's infatuation with Cardale. He looked good, for three fucking games in which Zeke put the team on his shoulders."
Browns,342ved,Daviroth,6,Mon Apr 27 23:02:50 2015 UTC,"You're saying that Zeke is the reason Cardale succeeded. No, the reason that Zeke was able to ""put the team on his shoulders"" was because Cardale's howitzer arm forces defenses to respect the pass. That's synergy, brother. Otherwise, you're just saying that it's coincidence/luck that Zeke had the best games of his career when Cardale was his QB.  Cardale's floor could be Jamarcus, but his ceiling could be Roethlisberger and that's worth a solid look. Plus, that doesn't take into account Cook or Hackenberger. Cook is my favorite to go #1 overall next year, at the moment."
Browns,342ved,fuckingbrowns,2,Mon Apr 27 23:36:47 2015 UTC,"There was some synergy. But the defense also played outside of it's mind as well. I completely agree on his floor/ceiling although his floor could be lower than Jamarcus'. The only thing he did well was throwing the ball down the field (not that accurately either) and having a big body. He didn't read well, wasn't that accurate, and generally made a fair amount of mistakes. You are right that he has a lot of potential but he is a hell of a lot closer to his floor right now than his possible ceiling. If Cardale doesn't start this year (which I would put my money on JT and I would pick JT) he will not be a 1st round pick. Maybe a super late first rounder as a potential replacement for a star in the league, but he will not be a high first. He still has a lot of problems that JT doesn't. All Cardale has is his body, if he can develop as a QB he could be really good, but we have no indication that he will."
Browns,342ved,Daviroth,0,Tue Apr 28 02:00:18 2015 UTC,"although his floor could be lower than Jamarcus   That's a bold statement. The dude didn't work hard at all and ate his way out of the NFL. Johnny draws a closer comparison to Jamarcus at the moment.   He didn't read well, wasn't that accurate, and generally made a fair amount of mistakes.   He's in a 1-read offense. He showed elite pocket awareness and poise. The ability to step up into the pocket and deliver when under pressure is extremely valuable for an NFL QB, and Cardale did that consistently.   You are right that he has a lot of potential but he is a hell of a lot closer to his floor right now than his possible ceiling.   How so? If you're comparing him to Jamarcus, the last real boneheaded thing he did was the tweet about aint come to play school. Outside of that, what other off the field issues has he shown? I suppose he did beat the hell out of cancer kids in Madden, but there's nothing wrong with a killer instinct like that.   If Cardale doesn't start this year   His arm adds a dimension to the offense that Barrett simply cannot. We'll see what happens.   All Cardale has is his body   Only if you ignore pocket awareness and ability to pull through in the clutch."
Browns,342ved,fuckingbrowns,3,Tue Apr 28 02:16:50 2015 UTC,"Your right, that was probably too bold.  JT did way more than 1-read.  Cardale didn't show any ability to read a defense and was rather inaccurate. That's what I mean by closer to his floor rather than his ceiling.  JT is the highest scoring player in BIG history. Highest.. Ever. While playing with a defense that was giving him -5 help every game. JT is just a better QB than Cardale is, in just about every way. The only thing I'd give Cardale on JT is arm strength, and even then JT doesn't have a noodle he could throw pretty far. Cardale might have come in for 3 games and played pretty decently on an amazing team effort, but the team was in that position solely because of JT's back. He carried the team for weeeeeekkkksssss."
Browns,342ved,Daviroth,0,Tue Apr 28 02:43:34 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of JT as well. I think there's a very good chance that he can be a round 1 QB next year (if he plays and doesn't get hurt). He's intelligent and mobile, and he's all-around a safer quarterback to pick than Cardale, but Cardale's arm and build give him a higher ceiling. He looks like he can be the next Roethlisberger, and that's what's going to make him a top 10 pick, if not the first overall. Cardale did what Brax and JT couldn't do - he won the BIG Ten and the National Championship. I think the starting job is his to lose.  I'm predicting that Cardale wins the starting job, but that's a hell of a problem for Urban to have."

McCown is barely serviceable as a starter and might get wrecked as a starter but ANYTHING is better than JFF. Johnny needs time to mature and learn the game if he continues his pro career. Connor Shaw is a good backup team first guy. None of these guys are franchise QBs, IMHO... yet.  At the point you do have a franchise QB keep drafting them anyway to inflate their trade value on some OG Andy Reid shit.

Browns,343hdf,JohnnyFire,4,Tue Apr 28 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"Weird. Heard parts of a Pettine interview on the radio after work and he said that they weren't scratching off names based on off-field issues. He said something roughly along the lines of: ""It's weighing risk management, just like anything else.""  What I picked up was that the front office is taking ""Play like a Brown"" deadly serious. He was stressing that they are looking for guys who want to play football because they absolutely love the game rather than just doing it for a paycheck.   He said that one of the interview questions they have been asking was, ""If you get drafted by both the NFL and NBA, which do you choose and why?"" He then said that 4/5 said that they would honestly choose basketball because of the guaranteed contracts. The other guy ""stared at (Pettine) like he had five heads"" due to the obvious answer. No names mentioned on who said what.  The last thing I can think from the interview mentioned how the grades the scouts gave are much closer to what the coaches give the prospects compared to last year. Pettine mentioned that it felt ""like a test that you have many more answers for"" this year compared to last year. He was also extremely excited when they got Gilbert last year."
Browns,343hdf,Mustang1718,2,Tue Apr 28 02:35:56 2015 UTC,"I love this mentality. The only problem I see is that Gilbert and Manziel from last year didn't seem to be ""Playing like a Brown"" or have that ""love the game over everything else"" mentality. That shows me two possible things. Those guys really do have that mentality and just got caught up in everything last year and have the chance to bounce back, or the front office does an absolute shit job at sifting through these guys to find the ""passion for the game"" types"

Browns,343ojx,R101C,7,Tue Apr 28 01:27:05 2015 UTC,"My immediate reaction is that this isn't specific to the Browns. You yourself said that 31 teams turned a profit; with all the extra revenue, they all do. 32 rich as shit people get richer every year off of us, no matter what team we follow."
Browns,343ojx,droidworkerbee,2,Tue Apr 28 01:47:08 2015 UTC,"Yes. Pretty much this. There are a few teams where I feel like the owner is really invested as a fan, but for the most part, winning is second to profits. It's nice, but when the NFL as a league is printing money, winning isn't everything, it's just something. End of the day, we care more than the owner does about wins and losses, and yet, the more we care, the less likely we bail despite decades of mediocrity."
Browns,343ojx,Daviroth,8,Tue Apr 28 10:23:29 2015 UTC,"That's not how you build a winning team. Ludicrous statement. So you are saying selling 97% of tickets when having a better season than recently compared to 90% isn't a difference in the winning vs. losing category? If he had come in and had a winning record it would've been #1. Without a doubt. Or it was a talent acquisition move by a talent acquisition executive. Or both. We will literally never know. That doesn't say winning doesn't earn more money. DC, Chicago, and NY are DRASTICALLY LARGER MARKETS than Cleveland, apples and oranges. They have all had much more recent success than the Browns as well.   So why did he dump money into updating the stadium AND take seats (ie tickets) out of the stadium? Why would he fire a HC one year into his contract knowing he would have to pay two HCs for the coming years?   Overall, I think you believe people are saying there is no money in a losing team. That's not what people are saying. There is certainly lots of money in owning an NFL franchise completely regardless of record. However, winning games consistently results in more money. Businessmen always want more money. Therefore, winning makes more money.  Winning makes more money =/= Losing makes no money"

Browns,343ojx,CaptainSweater,2,Tue Apr 28 05:52:41 2015 UTC,"Leaving $26M on the table is a lot.  It's a relatively small impact vs the cost of a better team. Spending that $26M in cap space won't be made up for by filling an already near capacity stadium, so why bother. Just let Mack walk next contract (God I hope not).  I'm not saying winning doesn't earn a little more, but winning isn't necessary, and it may not be worth the risk of extra investment.  They are larger. They make drastically more. That's my point. It's more relevant to p/l than w/l is.  I'm not saying he wants to lose, or won't spend some money along the way. I'm sure he spends money in every business venture he has. Return on investment matters to him though. My point is look at it from the angle of a business man, not a fan."
Browns,343ojx,Daviroth,1 point,Tue Apr 28 10:29:27 2015 UTC,"The one thing I take issue with is the difference between Owner and Organization. Sure, Haslam sets the tone. But he is also the only person that can't be fired. Everybody else can be.   With that in mind, Jimmy might not necessarily be 100% about the w/l category, but there sure as shit are people in the Browns whose careers are. I can't imagine Mike Pettine giving a single fuck about merchandising sales. And I think you are kind of right about the players, but that's a super broad statement for a league with hundreds of athletes.   Over everything else, winning affects the overhead. Keep yourself relevant, and the cash will flow. Look at Green Bay and Pittsburgh. Neither are particularly glamorous cities, but with winning comes respect (desirability of free agents, etc) and profitability."
Browns,343ojx,themitey1,2,Tue Apr 28 12:27:12 2015 UTC,"I think Pettine lives and dies by the w/l as a reflection on him, so he may care more than most fans. Players like Whitner probably care as much as anyone. Dude's twitter account makes me want to hit a steelers fan on the street."
Browns,343ojx,themitey1,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:47:17 2015 UTC,"I was looking at it from the view of a business man instead of a fan. Haslam has no say in that salary cap number. That's all on Farmer, not spending that money doesn't result in more money for him. Spending all the money every season for a building team like ours is really stupid. It's dumb, plain and simple.   Like I said, there is lots of money in simply owning an NFL franchise regardless of win/loss record. However, there is certainly more money, and in a lot of cases, a shitton more money in consistently winning.  Good business is not milking something you buy for every cent while letting it wither away. Good business is putting forth a product that people desire for the lowest cost to you. The primary, and most important, cost for Haslam is salaries of the FO. We will never know if he spending big there or not as those salaries are rarely leaked. But we know Farmer stayed here instead of going to Miami. We all like Pettine so that's a good move. He has also invested serious amounts of money into renovations, new uniforms, etc.  If Haslam wanted to milk this franchise and squeeze every cent out as possible he would not be doing the things he has been doing. Farmer would have left for Miami because you would be able to tell if an owner was like that."
Browns,343ojx,ohheyeverybody,2,Tue Apr 28 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"Here's what I want to see.  Take a team like the Seahawks.  They are in a fairly big market.  They were crappy for many years.  Then compare the profits they made the years they were losing to the years they went to the Superbowl.  If the profits stayed the same, then you have a decent argument.  If the profits skyrocketed, then you're simply wrong.  I'm not sure if your graphs display that.  I'm having a hard time reading them.  Maybe I'm dumb lol.  Also, some other things on your points.  Your point about the cap space, I think you're off base on that.  I don't think teams can just USE the cap space they don't spend as profit.  So that point doesn't make sense.  Correct me if I'm wrong though.  All NFL teams almost always make money, as you agree with.  The NFL is profitable period.  But, being a smart businessman (or money grubbing) like Haslam, you want to maximize these profits.  Hence the winning argument.  No one is saying teams don't make money without winning.  I told you that before.  Some of these points you bring up argue as if you're trying to show how else they make money besides winning.  Of course they make money besides winning, else no one would want to own a team and the NFL wouldn't be as successful as they are.  Maximizing these profits is what we're talking about here.  Not just making money."

Browns,343ojx,ohheyeverybody,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:06:42 2015 UTC,"His cap space argument is that because Haslam isn't spending money, he's saving it. It doesn't count as a profit, it's just not a loss.   Personally, I think OP is just butthurt.  I'm right there with you when you mentioned the Seahawks and their revenue from previous years to their super bowl runs, and the person who also commented on your post has an article to prove it. They made a shit ton more money, and right there proves that OPs argument has no merit.   To me, it's as simple as saying that businessmen are in business to make money.  Shocking statement, I know. Bare with me though, it makes sense.   Haslam can make money doing whatever he wants to with this team. In the few years that he's taken over, the overall value of the Browns has increased by around 300 million dollars."
Browns,343ojx,Daviroth,2,Tue Apr 28 11:40:42 2015 UTC,"His cap space argument is stupid. Farmer is the one running the cap, not Haslam. Farmer doesn't benefit one bit from saving cap space."

Whether I think it's best for the team or not, I'm not going to pull that trigger until I get confirmation from the owner.  That's why the owners are present at a lot of the signings. They're invested. They want to be comfortable with what they're doing.  There's no gm in the NFL that has absolute control over the owners bank account. No owner is free with their money like that. There's a reason they're billionaires."

Browns,341ol8,fear865,2,Mon Apr 27 18:35:26 2015 UTC,526 row 15. You?
Browns,341ol8,fear865,2,Mon Apr 27 19:24:06 2015 UTC,349 row 30.
Browns,341ol8,Zer0k00l,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Can you help me with how to do this? I'm at the checkout with 2 deposits for seats, when do I get to actually choose seats?"
Browns,341ol8,Zer0k00l,2,Mon Apr 27 19:16:47 2015 UTC,That's where I was stuck too. Call the ticket office and work through them. Once you place the deposit they will tell you what's available. There is nothing open in the lower level or the Dawg Pound. The remaining season tickets open up to the public on Wednesday.
Browns,3428an,740Buckeye,6,Mon Apr 27 18:59:57 2015 UTC,"I love this guy. I hope if we do draft him he lives up the potential this story precedes. He seems like he's become one hell of a dude.  Also, he did his Pro Day in a Lava Lava. I assume that this means we will all be invited to his post-Super Bowl Day luau."
Browns,3428an,JohnnyFire,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:47:05 2015 UTC,Seeing as how I'm moving to Hawaii I approve of this
Browns,3428an,battle_squid,2,Mon Apr 27 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"Holy fucking shit...I want this guy in Cleveland.   I feel as if the way he's able to speak about such a tragic situation really offers an insight into his personality and character, this is the type of guy I want in a locker room."
Browns,3428an,ChairyCweed,6,Mon Apr 27 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good dude, but you can't draft based on stories. I know a lot of people think he is great, but I don't think he is."
Browns,3428an,24rubikscube,2,Mon Apr 27 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"He looked... fat. Like woefully unhealthy. It was only a combine pic, but that worries me. Character matters a lot though. Somebody that wants to be here is really refreshing as well."
Browns,3428an,ChairyCweed,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:20:21 2015 UTC,"No, but you can draft based upon maturity and potential leadership qualities."
Browns,3428an,battle_squid,3,Mon Apr 27 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"That's a bonus, but isn't a huge deal. If he is tied with somebody else, that's a tiebreaker. If I remember right, there was a report that said he wasn't our top DT. They could just be really high on somebody else, but it doesn't look good for him coming to Cleveland."
Browns,3428an,JohnnyFire,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"If Shelton isn't our top DT, I'd like to know who was.   He makes sense from the position of our picks, unless we're going to take a gamble on a guy like Arik Armstead and hope for the best."
Browns,3428an,battle_squid,2,Mon Apr 27 19:30:56 2015 UTC,"I would make the assumption Brown May be our top DT, purely based off his positional flexibility and marginally better pass rush, plus he's a mature family man"
Browns,3428an,JohnnyFire,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:33:23 2015 UTC,The problem with Brown is where do we take him?   Do we take a risk and hope that he'll be there in the 2nd or use our first rounders on him?
Browns,3428an,battle_squid,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"Shelton, you almost have to take at 12, or trade up from 19.  Brown, you can probably get at 19 and it would be considered a solid pick.  Goldman you can get at 19, probably want to wait to the second but he could be gone.  Phillips should be there at 43, and you might want to just as well wait to see if you can't grab him in the late second at that point.  ...at least in terms of the pure tackles, that is how I see it playing out."
Browns,3428an,Official_Wingman,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:52:27 2015 UTC,What he said
Browns,3428an,themitey1,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"Add in:  Leonard Williams...yeah, we're not getting Leonard Williams. You'd have to get at least at or ahead of the Redskins.  Arik Armstead you can easily get at 19 or in the second depending upon the pace of the round.  Carl Davis should be there in the second round but due to team needs might go a bit above the mark of 43, might need to trade up a bit.  Michael Bennett/Grady Jarrett/Marcus Hardinson/etc. might all be available in the 3rd."
Browns,3428an,tinkthe,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"I would say he'd be there at 19, in the second we'd be looking at Carl Davis or Phillips most likely"
Browns,3428an,FernsAreFine,2,Mon Apr 27 19:53:05 2015 UTC,"Seems like a great dude, but I don't want him at 12. That 40 time is scary slow and I don't see him being a 3 down player so I don't think he's worth the 12th pick. I'd be alright with taking him at 19 though. Personally, I want Parker at 12 and armstead at 19, but I'm no expert. As long as they go BPA I'll be happy"
Browns,344bcc,BorisTBurger,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:45:13 2015 UTC,"I like the second one better overall, except I hate the 19 pick. Harold is not top 20 talent by any stretch. I'd rather Peat, Flowers, Goldman, hell even Gurley."
Browns,344bcc,Marzman315,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:44:06 2015 UTC,"The way farmer picked last year, and from what he's said this year....its best available.  Hopefully there's a run on WRs so good players at other positions fall to us."
Browns,344bcc,Flables,0,Wed Apr 29 12:41:51 2015 UTC,Neither. None of the WR you have listed in 2nd one will be there. Need to get first round WR talent.
Browns,344bcc,cc3995,6,Tue Apr 28 05:22:01 2015 UTC,"Need to get first round WR talent?  Ehhh, debatable.  Want?  Sure!  I just don't think it's absolutely necessary when there are also other needs at other positions."
Browns,344bcc,themitey1,5,Tue Apr 28 05:48:39 2015 UTC,"I could see any of those 3 guys dropping into the 2nd. I'm sorry, but 6-7 wideouts aren't going in the 1st, which is what I'm taking away from your comment."
Browns,344bcc,ccavana3,0,Tue Apr 28 06:24:57 2015 UTC,"Could def see 6-7 going in the first. 5 went last year, some regard this class as better. Would guarantee 5 going in the first"
Browns,344bcc,cc3995,5,Tue Apr 28 06:29:51 2015 UTC,"I just don't see it happening when this is clearly a defensive draft. I'm not saying it won't happen, but I'd be very surprised if 7 went in the 1st."
Browns,344bcc,ccavana3,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:40:00 2015 UTC,I feel like this rush on receivers is fabricated. I don't think we'll see more than five go in the first round.
Browns,342aqd,CGracchus,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:16:37 2015 UTC,"Divided Sky Rye IPA by 4 Hands Brewing Co (St. Louis) Hop Lobster (Red Ale) by Springfield Brewing Co. (Springfield) Gunslinger Double IPA by Crown Valley Brewing (Ste. Genevieve) Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale by Boulevard (Kansas City) Belgian Golden Ale by Schlafly (St. Louis) Spring Batch Farmhouse Style Ale by Mother's Brewing Co.

Hope he enjoys the beers I sent him from the 216, 419, and 614, which he should be getting today.  :)"
Browns,34140t,JohnnyFire,8,Mon Apr 27 14:02:03 2015 UTC,But Ray Farmer hates WR and will never even consider drafting one. /s
Browns,34140t,HWGBHWG,3,Mon Apr 27 15:35:44 2015 UTC,"Isn't ray farmer known for being deceptive? Being seen having dinner with a WR 3 days before the draft is a pretty big tell.   And nobody said he wouldn't draft a WR, people say he doesn't think they're valuable enough to take in the first round."
Browns,34140t,holdemtexas,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:53:54 2015 UTC,people say he doesn't think they're valuable enough to take in the first round.   And he didn't even exactly say that either.
Browns,34140t,TopHatAbobo,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:18:17 2015 UTC,He said he's following the Seahawks plan for success. The Seahawks plan doesn't call for feature wideouts. It doesn't value WRs at all.
Browns,34140t,holdemtexas,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"I think they might be re-evaluating that strategy now, considering the Jimmy Graham trade. He's a TE, granted, but still an impact receiver."
Browns,34140t,ArcadeNineFire,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:24:31 2015 UTC,"Except Harvin (before they traded him for his tude) and Tate (before he left). I think Seattle prioritizes certain positions more than others and they may have a certain vision about what kind of receiver they want, but don't have any way of getting at the back end of the draft. Or they have a system that is a fit for players with niche skillsets.  Not to mention they were willing to part with one of the best (if not the best) interior offensive linemen in the league to get Jimmy Graham. I think they are starting to look for something to fall back on if Beastmode starts to slow down a little. Perhaps Seattle is changing the formula."
Browns,34140t,BeDoubleYou,5,Wed Apr 29 04:16:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not high on him, if it wasn't for his ridiculous 40 he'd be a late 2nd round pick or early 3rd because he is still raw. He seems like Greg Little to me: Big and can run but can't catch. His dropped catch-able passes is very high as is (although so is Kelvin Benjamins and I love him).  It just feels like has a balloon of hype that is all propped up by that crazy 40 time.   That said, I'd say the scouts are a tiny bit better at evaluating talent than me so I'm gonna go on if we get him it is because they think they can turn him into a top WR talent."
Browns,34140t,bearsdriving,2,Mon Apr 27 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"Also, to be fair. They have personal meetings and interviews with 1st round picks all the way to potential UDFAs. Just because Farmer had dinner with him doesn't mean we are instantly and obviously taking him in the first."
Browns,34140t,Daviroth,3,Mon Apr 27 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't like Perriman much either. Seems like a classic ""HE'S BIG AND FAST SO HE MUST BE GOOD"" case.  At first I thought he might be the Mike Evans to Bortles' Manziel, but even then, not buying that theory."
Browns,34140t,VonJaeger,2,Mon Apr 27 14:18:52 2015 UTC,"Things about Perriman you should know:   He's gone in about a month and a half from a fringe mid-second round talent to a lock for the first; Mayock, Kiper, and McShay have mocked him as high as the top 10 at times. Stands 6'2"", 212; so right between Cooper and White on size, and ran a faster 40 at his pro day than both. A big play threat, but ultimately unpolished as all fuck. He needs refinement on the pro level because he's got a lot of drops."
Browns,34140t,shicken684,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was a fringe second round talent. I think he's pretty solidly a second rounder who is getting overrated due to his tangibles.   Likewise, while I agree that he's unpolished, I think his hands get a bit more knocked on last year than they should be. He had a ton of drops but he also played with an awful QB and tried to make grabs that he really had no business going after.   I don't think he's worth a first rounder - at least, not until near the end of the round - but it's not like he was a nobody until his Pro Day. The guy was getting some fringe first round consideration even before then."
Browns,34140t,sba_17,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:15:39 2015 UTC,Do players that jump up the boards an entire round or two ever pay off? There are always a few that have an exceptional combine that cause a gm to throw caution out the window and take a huge risk.
Browns,34140t,spear1321,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:00:09 2015 UTC,"I think a good comparison is Jermaine Kearse - that being said, Kearse is a decently valuable tool if you're looking at a Seattle-style WR chart. We could pull something like that if we're constantly rotating between Hawk, Bowe, Hartline, and Perriman. If Perriman is able to smoke corners, then that could draw more attention to him instead of the others, like Hawk."
Browns,34140t,Daviroth,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:16:06 2015 UTC,I'd probably puke if we take this guy in the first round. How in the world can you justify taking a WR with bad hands high in the draft.  Their job is to CATCH the ball.
Browns,345akd,GizmoTJ,3,Tue Apr 28 12:31:42 2015 UTC,The four links you've posted over the past year have been to that website and you have never posted in this sub.

Browns,3419x4,scsmith83,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:20:13 2015 UTC,They're probably still in production and not shipping for another week or 2 if I had to guess. Any sooner than that would be a nice surprise.

Browns,33z0mx,Brokewood,2,Mon Apr 27 00:03:58 2015 UTC,My first thought is that it is a reference to our new massive scoreboard when I first saw it.  It could also be there to put more emphasis on the chest area rather than the shoulders by using that shape.

The only issue I have is the size. The last jersey I bought was the same mid-tier type jersey when Reebok still made them. I bought a medium and it fit great. I got medium again, but it fits fairly snug and I most likely can't wear a jacket or hoodie underneath it. I'm about 5'10"" and 195 lbs, fwiw.  edit: here's a poorly taken impromptu selfie"

Browns,33z0mx,RandomUser72,2,Mon Apr 27 02:56:10 2015 UTC,"As much as I like Joe, there's no way I could buy his jersey.  There's a reason.  Let's look at my previous jersey purchases:     Eric Metcalf jersey, purchased in October of 1994 (Metcalf was traded before the next season)  April 2003, bought a Kevin Johnson jersey (he got cut halfway through the season)   August 2009, Bought a Brady Quinn jersey thinking Anderson was a fluke and Brady would figure it out (he didn't, got himself traded at the end of the season) June 2013, Trent Richardson (traded September 2013, I wore that jersey once before it was obsolete)   So, it seems I have the power to make players go away just by buying their jersey.  I bought a Couch jersey and changed the name to Manziel, not sure if it will work, but we will soon find out. If it does work, he should be gone by November.   But, I no longer buy jerseys of players I like."

Browns,33ykta,Mike_Shanahan,5,Sun Apr 26 23:30:05 2015 UTC,JR will get a one game suspension no way he gets more than that. Maybe even less like 1 half. He missed the entire second half because of that ejection.
Browns,33ykta,RaDiFranc0515,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:38:00 2015 UTC,IMO he is getting 3.
Browns,33ykta,Mike_Shanahan,4,Sun Apr 26 23:49:33 2015 UTC,3-5 is my guess. Probably will depend on the severity of Crowder's injury too. He's been suspended twice before for fighting and malicious fouls. That could be considered too.
Browns,33ykta,Pyorrhea,6,Mon Apr 27 00:15:32 2015 UTC,Severity of the injury shouldn't matter. The knee thing was completely incidental. If severity of injuries mattered the Olynyk would get 5 games when likely he will get one or none.

Browns,33v830,24rubikscube,27,Sun Apr 26 00:36:25 2015 UTC,"And that's where the issue of Al dying figures in. Randy Lerner had no spine, and quickly succumbed to public pressure to replace guys after 3 years. So the team kept getting ""restarted"".  I don't question the basis of your argument, but I'd only apply it if we had a continuous GM/coach for any stretch of time longer than 5 years."
Browns,33v830,Peninj,9,Sun Apr 26 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"I think he made a lot of bad hires   1.) Butch Davis. His problem was he couldn't draft. Was more suited for college, and lost control of the team over time. Could coach, but horrendous after his first two years.   Should have been fired  2.) Savage/Crennel. They had a fair length regime. They had the '07 which was a flash in the pan. Savage couldn't draft worth a lick after his first pick. Traded picks too carelessly. Romeo on the otherhand was a mediocre at best head coach.  They did have a lot of bad luck. If we were ever cursed it was then. Winslow, Edwards, and Bentley should have had great careers.  Should have been fired. They left a mess.  3.) ManKok. The draft was a disaster, and looked like 99 Browns until the last five games. The GM ends up shining the team (yikes), and they bring in Holmgren, who doesn't fit with Mangini at all. That ends in fire. Mangini didn't get a fair chance. I don't think he was very good, but he's the first that id say qualified. This train wreck was Randy's fault 100%.  Shouldnt have been fired. Maybe.  4.) Heckert/Holmgren/Shurmur. I'd like to have seen them get one more year. They had unified plan. Haslam had to have his guys though. Weeden possibly doesn't get picked if there wasn't a rush to win now. Instead we blow it up and install back to another new defense and offense. Yay. Ha slams fault.  Shouldn't have been fired   5.) Banner/Lombardi/Chud. Colossal disaster. Banner and Lombardi never should have been hired. Chud got the raw end of the stick.   Chud shouldn't have been fired. Banner and Lombardi was a screw up hire.  6.) farmer/Pettine. I they'll get a fair chance.   A lot of the problems have been the poor hiring by the owners. Not knowing what to build a winning program. I'll give Lerner some credit in that he accepted reality in that he didn't know and hired someone to run the team."
Browns,33v830,24rubikscube,16,Sun Apr 26 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"4.) Heckert/Holmgren/Shurmur.  Shouldn't have been fired   I vehemently disagree. Shurmur was the worst coach I've seen incharge of the Browns. Ever. Palmer's teams were raw, but he did what he could with the talent there. He even ended up creating a positive that Davis capitalized on after Palmer was fired. Mangini's teams were well disciplined if nothing else. fewest penalties in the league.  Shurmur's teams? absolute shit. And not because of lack of talent. He was a terrible play caller, terrible clock management. Our offense was the Keystone Kops trying to get the right plays/players in.  There was not one redeemable feature of Pat.  That fat fucking walrus should have earned his millions and fucking took to the side line.  /rant   Chud shouldn't have been fired. Banner and Lombardi was a screw up hire.   eh... I don't know. Our team showed legitimate signs of quitting during the final stretch of the season. and with how toxic and corrupted that whole scenario was, clearing house completely was Haslam's best move, imo. Otherwise, the GM will always think that the HC is more important. At least in this way, Farmer and Pettine were both brought in at the same time(-ish). They also have a harmonious football philosophy, unlike Ban-bardi."
Browns,33v830,FrankGrimesPHD,5,Sun Apr 26 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely per Shurmur. He was easily the worst coach we've had since the return. I had no faith in him turning it around.    But it wasn't just him. I was so skeptical about Holmgren from the beginning, and was sorry that it played out the way it did. What made Lerner think he would be a good pick to run a team? Especially picking him the season after you had just signed Mangini, who you couldn't wait to get onto the Browns sideline after you basically had to fire Crennel. Holmgren was a colossal failure with GM duties in Seattle. He left that cupboard bare of talent. And over-reaching on McCoy (yes I know he was a 3rd rounder, still way too high) when he supposedly stood up and shouted, 'We are taking him here!' Jesus.... The jury is still out on Manziel, but in the NFL you can't have a starting QB who many of the fans can out throw. He made Chad Pennington look like he had a cannon. Smart, tough, a leader, yeah Colt was all those things, but he couldn't make NFL throws (still can't, which is why he wound up getting exposed again).   Lets just hope they give Pettine and Farmer the tools (and time) needed to succeed."
Browns,33v830,drucius,2,Sun Apr 26 12:41:24 2015 UTC,"I was all in on letting Shurmur go too. But at least everyone was all in and with the same plan. Most of our regimes were clusterfucks. Either way we didn't have a being in guys that wanted a 3-4 defense that didn't remotely fit our players. That was a dumb mistake by Haslam.   I didn't love Chud either. But I'll give him his due that one year isn't fair. Banner and Lombardi on the otherhand were a joke. I also was okay with cleaning house.

If my memory serves when Pettine was hired, Lobo and Banner were already 2/3rds out the door.  Farmer had already turned down Miami to stay in Cleveland (likely under the premise that Haslam had given him GM job knowing other two chuckleheads were gone)."
Browns,33v830,FrankGrimesPHD,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:35:38 2015 UTC,"Banner claims Pettine was his first choice. Plus if he was already 2/3 out the door, no way haslam lets him be involved in the head coach hire. I also have to believe Haslam wouldn't have picked pettine himself before the new GM.   Seems like Banner picked him before Haslam was 100% about banner leaving. Lombardi was a done deal before Banner.   I don't like banners attitude about things and he just looks like a sneaky weasel. But his moves were pretty good, and he didn't really do any terrible moves.   Just imagine if chud agreed to let gordon go. We could have had 3 first rounders last year. We could have ended up with one of the first round WR that are doing so good too."
Browns,33v830,TemujinRi,2,Mon Apr 27 15:56:04 2015 UTC,"I liked our 2009 draft.  We avoided paying a pre rookie wage scale contract to a top five mediocrity (Sanchez) and managed to find one of the few All-Pro caliber players (Mack) in that draft.  And while it would have been nice to hit on all three of our second rounders that year, I'd argue that we were picking from one of the worst talent pools in the history of the draft, and that two of our three picks (Robiskie and Massaquoi) were solid picks at a position of dire need, that, for whatever reason, failed to develop into quality starters.  The 2011 draft was a far greater disaster, trading out of the fifth slot and leaving multiple All Pro players (including Julio Jones and JJ Watt) on the board and coming away with Phil Taylor and not a single other player that's still on the roster today."
Browns,33v830,topper_mango,2,Sun Apr 26 15:22:03 2015 UTC,"Sheard was a good player, but we change systems every three or four years, so he didn't fit anymore.   We'd been better off keeping Jones.

Holmgren made some terrible moves and should have been gone. He was in over his head trying to get everything his way and screwed it up.  Chud was a joke. Really look back. We had no development. Same mistakes were being made all season. We gave up on the 2nd half every game. We didn't adjust, he even said on record that he doesn't think 2nd half adjustments matter.   We have Pettine now. He is a fan favorite. The team was more disciplined and cut back on dumb mistakes as the season went. They gave 100% all game every game. We ended with the best record we have had in a long time.   I'm 100% confident in saying Pettine is a better coach than chud. Regardless of how it went down, end of the day, letting chud go gave us the chance to get a better coach, and we got a much better coach.   Farmer I'm not 100% sold on, but time will tell. Pettine though is the man. Unless something terrible happens he will likely be hear for a while."

Browns,33t6k4,RandomUser72,3,Sat Apr 25 14:35:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm still iffy on Ray.  I thought it was obvious that they needed a WR since Gordon was in trouble.  Trading out of 4 for 2 more picks was awesome.  While it didn't let them get Sammy Watkins, there were plenty of other quality receivers in that draft, so getting an extra #1 for 2015 was a great deal.  I thought they should and would go for Mike Evans, then he went at #7 and the Browns then traded to move to #8.  At that point, I thought they were taking Odell Beckham Jr.  Then at 22, I still believed they were faking the Manziel hype and that it was obvious to them that the most NFL ready QB was Teddy, and they would snag him there.    But, I thought he played the Free Agent game very well.  I will wait and see how this draft goes before I damn him.  Currently, I'd like a mix, Heckert's drafting and Farmers FA peddling and management (without texting)."
Browns,33t6k4,CaptainSweater,6,Sat Apr 25 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"I thought it was obvious that they needed a WR since Gordon was in trouble.     I actually take this to be a strength more than anything else, tbh. Let's be clear, that's a hard spot to be in: he had to weigh the immediate needs against whatever he determined his long-term plan to be. Despite the (continued) need, he snagged Bitonio the next pick after the world learned of Gordon's suspension. That takes some fucking balls to stick to your plan in a town like Cleveland.   I agree that he still needs to prove himself, but I have faith that he's not just lucking in to smart decisions. Additional time on the job will only bolster his confidence and hopefully provide increasingly intelligent moves."
Browns,33t6k4,RandomUser72,2,Sat Apr 25 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"he snagged Bitonio the next pick after the world learned of Gordon's suspension   The Browns knew it was likely that he would be suspended for a good chunk of the year before the draft (they discussed the possibility of a 1-year suspension in February of 2014, 2 months before the draft, you're thinking of the press conference held on May 9th, they knew before then that it was official).  WR was already a need.  Their top 3 needs at the time were QB, OG, WR.  The world was informed of the season long supension of Gordon hours prior to the draft (May 8 2014 was the first day of the draft, and at 4pm the news of his suspension broke, draft started at 7pm, and even was discussed in the pre-draft show).  The Browns were informed at least 24 hours prior to the draft, that the punishment was official.  The next player they drafted was Gilbert, a CB.    At that time, we had Haden and Skrine as starters and 6 others for depth.  At WR we had Gordon and Hawkins and a hole from releasing Greg Little, then Travis Benjamin.  So, with Gordon being suspended, that meant we had Hawkins and Benjamin with 0 depth.  No 3 or 4 receiver sets, and those two would play every snap.  He did get a potentially great DB with Gilbert, but I'd say it's not balls that makes you pick up another backup to your pro-bowlers over a position with a dire need.    That's why they ended up going out and getting Miles Austin, Earl Bennet, and Nate Burleson.  They had to.  Those were the best players left in FA after the draft.  If they were not planning to draft a WR, why did they not make plays for Emmanuel Sanders, Jacoby Jones, Hakeem Nicks, or even Devin Hester (players that could have been a #1 or #2 WR on the Browns)?  I get the not going for DeSean Jackson, Golden Tate, Eric Decker, or Riley Cooper, those were all big money.  But those 4 I named first, all signed deals for under $15mil.  That would have been better than signing a guy to be the #1 when his previous season included 2 hamstring injuries, 50% reception rate (24 of 49) for 244 yards and 0 TDs in 11 games.    Signing him was fine, a good deal, but not to be the #1 receiver, that's just poor planning.  It just seemed like their plan was to draft a receiver to be the #2 behind Gordon, or take his spot if he got suspended, then they forgot the plan on draft day.  (*edited for easier reading)"
Browns,33t6k4,ArcaneNine,2,Sat Apr 25 18:18:23 2015 UTC,"Sanders is the only one on your list who is a legitimate receiver, and it looks like he took a sizable paycut to play for the Broncos and try for a championship. Honestly our offense just wasn't built to rely on the pass, so investing draft picks in top receivers wouldn't have improved our offense significantly I think. Look at Houston, Andre Johnson has been a great receiver for many years but his production doesn't have a huge impact on whether or not the team wins games. Grabbing a cornerback and guard high in the draft set us up for the future. I still believe that Gilbert can easily turn things around. Manziel was a mistake, but I think that pick isn't going to set us back more than 2 years at most."
Browns,33t6k4,RandomUser72,2,Mon Apr 27 02:11:22 2015 UTC,"Sanders is the only one on your list who is a legitimate receiver   If you are including who the Browns took (Austin, Bennet, and Burleson), then I agree.  I also agree that Gilbert can be who everyone thought he could and give Haden some competition for a Pro Bowl slot.  I'm saying it was a costly stretch to get him when we didn't need him and needed a lot of help in other areas.  Sure, you can say it sets us up for the future, but we had a young CB group (average age was 23), and we had only 2 recievers (28 and  24).  So you increase the future and skill of an area that doesn't need it and ignore an area that is missing players and has no future?  Hoyer wasn't great, but he was good enough to get us some wins.  Maybe with some more competent receivers (instead of FA leftovers), he could have done better (even though it seemed he got worse every week).  Confidence can do a lot for a player, and receivers that make a QB look good increase the QB's confidence, resulting in better play from him.  They got Miles Austin, named him the #1 receiver.  That happened, it shouldn't have.  I'm fine with grabbing Miles Austin for depth and experience, not to be the crutch because we have no #1 receiver."
Browns,33t6k4,ArcaneNine,2,Mon Apr 27 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"I think the organization had a good feeling that the suspension wouldn't really be for the entirety of the season. In that case the #1 receiver comes back later in the season, and we might be able to get by the first half of our schedule because it's among the easier schedules in the league. I don't think it was worth it at that time to make any knee-jerk reactions that wouldn't fit with the long-term plan of the franchise."

If you think we are going to be able to get a top 5 8 at their position player at 19 you should probably temper your expectations a little bit.  Top 8 is still pretty fucking amazing. We have like 4 top 8 at their position players on the team right now. You want to increase that by 50% with a #12 overall and #19 overall player? Good fucking luck mate.

Browns,33u3wf,Daviroth,3,Sat Apr 25 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"Haden, Bitonio, Thomas, and Mack are who I am assuming you are referring to when you say four because those immediately jump out in my mind.  All of which were drafted in the first two rounds.    We took a developmental CB and project QB last year in the first round.  We took one of the four that I am mentioning in the second last year.  We keep getting these early round draft picks who we need to pray hope make a splash instead of taking someone who's going to be solid.    Yes, I think we can add great value by keeping our picks and trusting Farmer to draft the best players on the board.  You're picking in the top 20 with 22 regular positions in a league that turns over fairly quickly.  It's not absurd to expect top 5 to top 8 talent with those picks."
Browns,33u3wf,Resident_Wizard,0,Sat Apr 25 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"It is 100% absurd to expect top 5 to top 8 talent with those picks. 100%. However, it is not absurd to get that talent with those picks. You cannot expect that extremely high level of talent acquisition, it is absurd. It could happen, but if it doesn't you cannot be upset about it; therefore you cannot expect it. Temper your expectations from expect, that is where you are making the error.   EDIT: To further disprove you point. You bring up Thomas, Mack, Haden, and Bitonio. Yeah they were all taken in the first two rounds. BUT IT TOOK US 8 YEARS TO GET THEM. You cannot expect top 8 talent with every single first round pick. That is ludicrous."

Browns,33u3wf,Resident_Wizard,6,Sat Apr 25 19:09:46 2015 UTC,Not being top 8 talent does not equate to missing on guys.
Browns,33u3wf,themitey1,0,Sat Apr 25 19:31:28 2015 UTC,I should clarify that I meant top 8 talent at their position.  And I do equate not being a top 8 talent at your position as not being worth the first round pick.

Browns,33u3wf,Resident_Wizard,0,Sat Apr 25 19:54:09 2015 UTC,"That is exactly my point and /u/themitey1 explains it well. Just because they aren't top 8 at their position doesn't mean we failed, it doesn't mean the player is a bust."

Browns,33u3wf,Resident_Wizard,0,Sat Apr 25 21:38:04 2015 UTC,So you are saying that there should be 32 brand new top 8 at their position players every single year? That is unheard of.
Browns,33u3wf,Daviroth,2,Sun Apr 26 00:03:01 2015 UTC,"Well, he said a ""shot""...so that's fair.   White, Cooper, Fowler, Ray at 12.  Shelton(as an OFF tackle), Peat, Collins, Beasley, Goldman, Gurley at #19.  I could see a viable ""shot"" at these players being in the top 8 at their positions in time"
Browns,33u3wf,subhuman1,-2,Sat Apr 25 19:14:19 2015 UTC,It's a pretty long shot.
Browns,33u3wf,Daviroth,3,Sat Apr 25 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"Define ""pretty long shot""?   Now, if we trade both 1sts for say a top 5 pick....what are those odds?

Browns,33u3wf,Daviroth,10,Sun Apr 26 16:23:12 2015 UTC,I don't think any of the other positions in this draft are worth trading up for. Danny Shelton and Jaelen Strong to me is worth more than just Leonard Williams or just Amari Cooper
Browns,33u3wf,Dustin65,4,Sat Apr 25 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"I'm content at staying at 12 and 19. I'd be okay giving up a third rounder to move up for Cooper, but he's the only player I'd want to move up to get in the first round.  I would not, however, be opposed to trading up from the second round or up from the third or fourth or whatever."
Browns,33u3wf,VonJaeger,3,Sat Apr 25 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"I don't believe in trading up for some ""magical"" player.

Browns,33u3wf,themitey1,2,Mon Apr 27 05:40:49 2015 UTC,I figure we may trade up a few spots from 12 or even 19 to grab a player we really want and give up a 3rd rounder or later in this or next years draft.

Browns,33tvmg,Kimchi__Pancakes,28,Sat Apr 25 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"I may be in the minority here, but I really can't fault him for any of the moves he has made since coming here. He got rid of the massively unpopular Holgrem/Shurmur as well as Heckert, a guy who many people had mixed feelings on.   There were rumors that Banner was forced on him and Lombardi was Banner's guy, but they were even more unpopular than Holgrem and Heckert. The coach they (B and L)  brought in (Chud) also seemed to really be a ""meh"" kind of guy. The job seemed too big for him, especially with Norv Turner, who just came from a head coaching job, and Ray Horton, who came here to boost his resume for a head coaching job. All aspects of the team regressed as the season progressed, especially with the front office failing to supply any sort of solutions to the on-field woes (McGahee was terrible). The firing of Chud seemed like it was too soon, but it ultimately made sense. If any other team besides the Browns did it the move would be viewed as smart.  The following coaching hiring process seemed really off. A lot of leaks came out and it was hard figuring out what was or was not real. The team had a horrible public image and it all seemed to come down to the guys the league forced Haslam to take. So after Pettine was brought in, firing Banner and Lombardi really seemed to make sense and was extremely popular with the fan base. Promoting from within seemed even more popular, it it inferred that not much of a shakeup would be coming. The ensuring draft was viewed, by both fans and draft pundits, as a huge success. We got a bunch of project players and traded to ensure more building could be done during the next (2015) draft. Josh Gordon's suspension was not the fault of Haslam.   While romanticized stories came out about the draft (football is entertainment and everyone wants a story), the team's performance on field was a roller coaster. The defense was behind the offense to start and they flipped sides by the end of the year, implying that the defense would improve even more in the following season while the offense needed retooling. Farmer had a texting a scandal that he took full responsibility for, but I think he made up for it with the underrated FA moves (Hartline, Bowe, Williams, Starks, and McCown were all brought in at a good price and should be upgrades or serviceable stopgap pieces.  IMO Haslam gets a lot more shit than he deserves, especially when people complain about his impatience and cite two moves that were extremely popular with the fans when they occurred. He may be ""hands on"" in the sense that he wants to learn about every aspect of the business, but if I invested $1,000,000,013.87 into something, I'd be ""hands on"" too. That's a lot of money to just let an organization ""do its thing""."
Browns,33tvmg,Chiranthodendron,2,Sat Apr 25 16:37:42 2015 UTC,I agree. He's definitely a business man. He knows more wins and happier fans mean more money.

Browns,33tvmg,tonyd1989,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:23:29 2015 UTC,"Winning does equal more money. The Browns would make substantially more for a winning franchise. I, for one, am not spending a bunch of money on  browns gear or anything until they start winning and I know more people like me. If they start winning people will come outta nowhere to support the team.. It won't be just the hardcore's that root for the browns, it'll be all the people who are casual fans as well. Young kids who are undecided on there team will start choosing the browns. Winning makes more money. Yes a losing team can be profitable, but a winning organization is even MORE profitable. If you think haslam, a businessman, doesn't want MORE money then you are a moron."

Haslam is a business man, not a fan. A fan would spend every penny of the salary cap to win. The browns have the 2nd highest cap space if I remember right."
Browns,33tvmg,VonJaeger,4,Mon Apr 27 23:43:17 2015 UTC,"Pros:   He definitely is an involved owner when it comes to the franchise, as opposed to Randy Lerner, who actively didn't even come to home games near the end.  He is modernizing the Browns a bit and is doing a lot to change the image of a team from a loser to a winner. He seems to have an earnest desire to bring a winning team to Cleveland. He came in and cleaned up Cleveland. Guys that had been skating by for years under Lerner were ousted, and he rid Berea of Holmgren and all of Holmgren's friends.  He does seem to have an eye for executive talent.   Cons:   The whole Pilot Flying J lawsuit made him look bad. Really bad. And as a result, made the Browns look bad. Is he a crook or not? He's a bit overeager, which has made him look brash and has made him apparently step on people's toes. People in Berea say that he doesn't, but the perception is that he does. His firing of Lombardi and Banner and Chud after one year immediately gave his Browns the ""dysfunctional"" label.  His new look Browns, while pleasing some, isn't for everyone.  He needs to learn when to take a step back and let the football people handle the football parts of the franchise.    Overall: I think Haslam's ownership got off on a very positive note with the way he cleared out Holmgren's guys, but the Pilot lawsuit, the year one firings, and the nonstop reports of dysfunction have left Haslam's ownership thus far on a bad footing. That being said, I think he desires to be a good owner and bring a great team to Cleveland, while some of the dysfunction within Berea is extremely overblown. You're naturally going to have some dysfunction when a new owner takes over, and that's not even including having rookie GMs and rookie HCs working with one another. I think Haslam can be a great owner if he realizes that sometimes, he needs to step back and let the qualified people do their jobs and stop having his hands into every honeypot. Haslam's desire to be involved in every aspect of his team is toxic - not because he's a toxic presence, but because it sets everyone on edge and because Haslam now has the reputation of being a loose gun. I think if Jimmy sits back, lets Farmer and Pettine handle on the field business, and mostly sticks to the business side of the franchise with Scheiner, then he'll be a pretty damn good owner."
Browns,33tvmg,tonyd1989,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:41:52 2015 UTC,"About chud and those guys... As I have heard from upper management when having this very discussion. One of the worst decisions to make in a failing business is no decision, to wait it out. He saw they were toxic and failing and ousted them instead of letting them run it into the ground even more."
Browns,33tvmg,VonJaeger,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree about firing Lombardi and Banner. That was a necessary move - firing Chud was a bad one, though. They lucked out in the end by getting an even better HC, but that's still a bad look.  Hell, while people who follow the team closely know how toxic Lombardi and Banner were, national media types seem to think that Haslam just has a fast trigger finger."
Browns,33tvmg,DocMichaels,9,Mon Apr 27 23:36:54 2015 UTC,"He's better than Randy Lerner, which is important to me: he CARES about the team, and his investment.

Browns,33tvmg,Peninj,2,Sat Apr 25 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"I suspect that Loggains isn't lying. Its a dumb move on his part to air this out, because he's unlikely to garner similar opportunities in the future with his inability to keep shit in house—we'll see how he does with the bears.   But assuming that it is true, that Haslam ordered the drafting of Manziel. It seems that from the public comments he's made about Manziel, he now acknowledges how much of mistake it may have been. Seems to me Haslam 'learned his lesson' and we can expect a much more demurred owner (during the draft) and he's more likely to go to Farmer and Pettine to provide them with what they want and need to make the team better. Rather than tell them what they need."

Its clear to me that his side of the ball didn't improve down the stretch (unlike the defense), and he may not have been using his guys to the best of their abilities.   I like the hiring of a young unproven guy in DeFilippo. He's going to work with Pettine to create a coherent TEAM, not just an offense and a defense which take the fields at different times. A full unit with complimentary strengths. A young guy who is going to be creative, hasn't gotten fixed in his ways of coaching, will utilize the talent to its fullest when designing his schemes/plays/game plans."

Browns,33tvmg,JayfishSF,3,Sun Apr 26 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"I think he's going to get much better over time. The real big knock against him is the fraud investigation into his firm, Pilot Flying J. As bad as that looked, given the amounts involved, I can't see how he was a part of it. The number the sales guys bilked from their customers was either $55M or $35M over a period of 5 years. That sounds like a lot, but this is a company that's gross revenue last year was $32B. That means at $35M, this was .0002 percent of their annual revenue. I personally think this was sales dudes lining their own pockets instead of a billionaire risking his entire family's fortune on an amount that wouldn't even move the needle on his business."
Browns,33tvmg,24rubikscube,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:18:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's very good, but negative opinions always get downvoted. The Banner/Chud regime was a colossal disaster. That should never happen. People think Banner was forced on him, but I don't believe that.   The Pilot J scandal is bad. Luckily it'll probably it'll get swept under the rug because he's rich and his family has political power. Wealthy people are more equal than us when it comes to the law.   The positives is I like Pettine a lot. I'm not sold on Farmer yet, but I'm not going to fault Haslam even if doesn't turn out. Farmer has a good resume.   I don't think Haslam drafted Manziel. I personally think Farmer did. So what ever direction Johnny's career goes I think credit/blame should be on Farmer."
Browns,33tvmg,JesteroftheApocalyps,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"I can't credit him for Pettine, as they interviewed Chip Kelly, Gary Kubiak, Adam Gase, and even Josh Fucking McDaniels, and they all turned it down. Luckily for Haslam (and us) we got Pettine. So it's not like that was some sort of executive master stroke. It was pure luck.  The Flying J thing is embarrassing for sure, but it will be swept under the rug and forgotten after a while.  Although the jury is still out on Farmer, all-in-all I think it was a good hire. He can draft pretty well. He just needs to let Pettine and his staff do their fucking job. Hopefully he's learned his lesson.  Renovating the stadium and rebranding a bit is O.K., but I don't really give a shit about that crap; I just want to see 9+ wins every season for the next 10 years, some playoff appearances, and hopefully a SB.   It does seem like Jimmy is trying too hard at times, but look at the dysfunctional dumpster fire he bought.

I think it was after the flag to the eye because I remember asking him if he was going to join the WWF since that was the rumor at the time."
