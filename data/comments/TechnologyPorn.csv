TechnologyPorn,3dyjlf,secretgspot,5,Tue Jul 21 07:11:40 2015 UTC,"Well, assuming this is a serious question the two basic reasons you can't do this is each chip needs a lot of interconnects for I/O and power, and also each chip needs to dissipate a lot of heat.  Assuming this wafer is 300mm diameter it has a total surface area of 70,000 mm2.  A quick check of wikipedia shows me sandy bridge CPUs (assuming these aren't xenons) range from 130mm2 for dual core models to 216 mm2 for quad core.  These look like they are quad core, so we'll assume 216.  So we'll round down, allow some room for the edges and assume there are 300 CPUs per wafer.  Now each CPU needs 1155 individual wire connections.  Maybe its less, but when they are normally packaged into individual CPUs that how many connections are on each CPU.  So, 1155 x 300 = 346,500 individual connections per wafer.  I'm sure you can see how this would be problematic.  In addition to this, each CPU needs about 65 w of power, at peak.  65 x 300 = 19.5 kW.  That is a serious amount of electricity... way more than the average house uses.  And, that is also close to the amount of heat that you'd need to dissipate. Cooling nearly 20kw out of something the size of a CD would require some serious engineering.  So yeah, a whole wafer of CPUs for your.... CPU is a neat idea, but I'm sure you can see why it isn't done this way."

They last a couple decades and output enough electricity to power a vacuum cleaner.  These suckers are big in space, and in a few russian lighthouses.  Basically the idea is you fill up a tube with stuff thats so radioactive it gets glowing hot for hundreds of years, and surround it with semiconductor junctions, and wrap those in black fins.  The fins radiate off heat as light/electromagnetic waves, which is helped by being black.  Since the fins are colder than the core, there is a flow of heat across the semiconductor junctions, which creates electricity because science."

TechnologyPorn,3bcje6,Derkek,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:43:23 2015 UTC,"They keep blowing up?  Unless there have been some incidents during design and testing, no Merlin engine has blown up during actual launches. There was one incident where a shroud broke apart, but even then most of the engine was intact and the other engines compensated and the mission was completed successfully.   After the  mission, most first stages have been left to fall into the ocean, as is practice for all other companies. Recently SpaceX has been attempting to land their first stages with the eventual goal of re-use. The engines do not ""keep blowing up whilst trying to do their fancy landing maneuvers."" Granted, the first two attempts to land on the drone ship have not been successful, but it's extremely experimental and they've been quite close to success each time. Those failures were due to running out of hydraulic fluid for the grid fins and a sticky engine throttle valve, not the engines randomly exploding."

Which somewhat makes sense.  A Falcon 9 contains 10 Merlin engines.  Each Falcon 9 costs $61,200,000 (including fuel).

When you touch a hot body the temperature on the surface you're touching drops very fast, then rises as heat from the rest of the body goes into the relatively cold zone around the touched points, raising theirs and your finger's temperature.

If SpaceX can perfect the self landing stages, then the Falcon Heavy will not only be the biggest, but also the most efficient by FAR.  Currently the Atlas V and Delta IV cost about $10,000 per pound of payload material.  The Falcon Heavy, if the self landing stages perform the way they are supposed to...  will cost about $500 per pound.  And the Falcon 9, will cost about $100 per pound.  (Both of these figures are for LEO).  But thats a really big deal!  And thats why I'm so excited for the launch this Sunday!  You can watch it live here if you'd like!"

TechnologyPorn,3azeg5,HoodieHollowDickieRP,20,Wed Jun 24 18:55:24 2015 UTC,"Here is a wikipedia entry on this particular mission.  Here is a video of the attempted landing.  Absolutely amazing to watch!  This is a really big deal, because if SpaceX perfects this technology, they will have created a ""fully"" reusable space craft.  This will drastically cut the price of bringing things to space.  The biggest cost of a rocket launch currently, is the fact that rockets are not reusable.  A rocket capable of landing itself softly, will be reusable, with slight maintenance.    SpaceX claims, that if this technology becomes reliable, the Falcon 9 could achieve prices of $500 per pound.    The next Falcon 9 Launch is scheduled for June 28th which is this Sunday!  This launch will be another Resupply mission to the ISS, CRS-7.  I would imagine that this would be the next attempt to land the first stage.  They're only experimenting with the first stage of the 3 stage Falcon 9 Rocket.  But they hope to one day have all 3 stages land themselves safely to be reused.    If the launch the Falcon 9 launched this Sunday has the grass hopper landing technology) (which I would image it does), then it would be the 3rd attempt at landing a stage used to take something to space.  If it lands succesfully, it would be the first time in history that a rocket stage successfully lands itself vertically."

TechnologyPorn,3azeg5,Kogster,3,Thu Jun 25 12:17:17 2015 UTC,"Currently, spaceX has prices as low as $2,500 per pound, and Boeing/Lockheed have prices as low as $10,000 per pound.  That's the importance of SpaceX.  The space market has been stuck, because there hasn't been any real competition.  Boeing built a beautiful, powerful, reliable rocket.  But they've had no reason to lower the price, because their main buyer is the government, and they'll pay whatever needs to be paid.  SpaceD is really opening the door to competition and thus lower prices.  Sources:  http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/astp.html_prt.htm    Today, it costs $10,000 to put a pound of payload in Earth orbit   http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/   a Falcon 9 launch costs an average of $57 million, which works out to less than $2,500 per pound to orbit. That’s significantly less than what other U.S. launch companies typically charge, and even the manufacturer of China’s low-cost Long March rocket (which the U.S. has banned importing) says it cannot beat SpaceX’s pricing.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_launch_market_competition   In early December 2013, SpaceX flew its first launch to a geosynchronous orbit providing additional credibility to its low prices which had been published since at least 2009. The low launch prices offered by SpaceX (less than $2,500 per pound to orbit for Falcon 9 v1.1 and $1,000 for Falcon Heavy),[1]   And they're reliable.  Just a few weeks ago the USAF finally cleared SpaceX to begin competing for defense contracts against the Boeing Lockheed United Launch Alliance.  This comes just in time for the launch of GPS III, the third generation of the GPS network.  Source:  http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/spacex-gets-air-force-certification-compete-military-launches-n364986   The U.S. Air Force on Tuesday said it has certified privately held SpaceX to launch U.S. military and spy satellites, ending a monopoly held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co., since its creation in 2006.   And THATS a big deal, because the USAF spends more on space than anyone else in the world... Including NASA.  Through both USAF and NASA the United States spends more on space than the rest of the world combined.  So the growing trust in SpaceX is certainly going to help grow the company, and grow the industry.  Especially with the mission to mars right around the corner!"

Sample collection was achieved with the use of aerogel, a low-density (0.02 gm/cc) inert microporous silica-based substance which will allow capture of high-relative-speed particles with minimal physical and chemical alteration. The aerogel is held by modular aluminum cells arranged in a grid pattern and deployed on the paddle. The useful collecting area of each side of the paddle is 1000 square centimeters.  The aerogel is simply exposed to space during sample collection periods and stowed in the sample vault at other times. One side of the aerogel (the A side, 3 cm thick) was used for collection of cometary samples and the other (B, 1 cm thick) side for interstellar dust. The appropriate side was oriented toward the expected particle flux and particles striking the aerogel were slowed down and trapped within. The number of particles is small, the impacts left tracks in the aerogel enabling the particles to be located."

TechnologyPorn,38dymx,RyanSmith,9,Wed Jun 3 16:19:09 2015 UTC,"When you need to test hardware designed to operate in the vast reaches of space, you start in a vacuum chamber.  NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland has many of them, but Vacuum Chamber 5 (VF-5) is special.  Supporting the testing of electric propulsion and power systems, VF-5 has the highest pumping speed of any electric propulsion test facility in the world, which is important in maintaining a continuous space-like environment.  The cryogenic panels at the top and back of the chamber house a helium-cooled panel that reaches near absolute zero temperatures (about -440 degrees Fahrenheit). The extreme cold of this panel freezes any air left in the chamber and quickly freezes the thruster exhaust, allowing the chamber to maintain a high vacuum environment. The outer chevrons are cooled with liquid nitrogen to shield the cryogenic panels from the room temperature surfaces of the tank.  Most electric propulsion devices, such as Hall Thrusters, use xenon as a propellant, which is very expensive. By capturing the used xenon as ice during testing, researchers are able to recover the propellant to reuse, saving NASA and test customers considerable costs.  The oil diffusion pumps along the bottom of the tank capped by circular covers use a low vapor pressure silicon oil to concentrate small amounts of gas to the point where it can be mechanically pumped from the chamber.  VF-5 will continue to provide a testing environment for Glenn’s advanced Solar Electric Propulsion technology needed for future astronaut expeditions into deep space, including to Mars.

Those cup-like structures on the plates are in fact acoustic absorbers, part of the fairing acoustic protection (FAP) system which lines the interior of the fairing. The FAP actually serves to protect the payload by dampening the sound created by the rocket during liftoff and ascent into the atmosphere.  The plates themselves just hold those acoustic absorbers - but they are not metal. They are actually made out of a foamed plastic mat, usually reticulated polyimide. They are only covered in a thin protective foil of polyester, which just prevents the penetration of particles.  Here's a better view of the FAP on the payload fairings that were on the Atlas V that launched Curiosity into space.

TechnologyPorn,31o1gy,Deceptichum,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yoyodyne:       Yoyodyne is the name of a number of companies, both fictional and real.  Yoyodyne was introduced as a fictional defense contractor in Thomas Pynchon's V. (1963) and featured prominently in his novel The Crying of Lot 49 (1966). Described in the latter book as ""a giant of the aerospace industry"", Yoyodyne was founded by World War II veteran Clayton ""Bloody"" Chiclitz. The company has a large manufacturing plant in the fictional town of San Narciso, California. The name is reminiscent of several real high-tech companies, including Teledyne and Teradyne, both of which were founded a few years before Pynchon wrote The Crying of Lot 49, and Rocketdyne, an aerospace company that manufactured, among other things, propulsion systems.  The ""dyne"" is the standard unit of force in the centimeter-gram-second system of units, derived from the Greek word dynamis meaning ""power"" or ""force"".

It was named after the British and Irish physicists John Douglas Cockcroft and Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton, who in 1932 used this circuit design to power their particle accelerator, performing the first artificial nuclear disintegration in history.  They used this voltage multiplier cascade for most of their research, which in 1951 won them the Nobel Prize in Physics for ""Transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles"". Less well known is the fact that the circuit was discovered much earlier, in 1919, by Heinrich Greinacher, a Swiss physicist. For this reason, this doubler cascade is sometimes also referred to as the Greinacher multiplier. Cockcroft-Walton circuits are still used in particle accelerators, but now also in many everyday electronic devices that require high voltages, such as x-ray machines, television sets, and photocopiers.

TechnologyPorn,2xv154,OompaOrangeFace,4,Thu Mar 5 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm so glad you asked. I'm actually giving a talk at this physics conference tomorrow about my interferometer, so I'll give you the short version.   Those ring laser gyroscopes that you posted work because light travels at a constant speed (in free space), so if two beams are counter-propagating around the same circular path and you rotate the whole apparatus, one of them will complete the round trip slightly faster, leading to a ""phase difference"" at the finish line. That phase difference can be detected by interfering the two lasers (hence the name ""interferometer"") on a detector, which will yield information about the rotational velocity of the gyroscope.   As it turns out, there are other phenomena that cause two counter-propogating laser beams to experience a phase difference that have nothing to do with physical movement. One of the more unexpected ones in magnetism; if you bounce two circularly polarized lasers off a magnetic surface, you get a phase difference which can be measured through interference. I turned mine into microscope, so I can do super-sensitive, micro-scale imaging of magnetic films and devices just by bouncing lasers off of them.   Pretty fun stuff!"

The same dataset could exclude inelastic dark matter as the explanation for the signal in DAMA/LIBRA under standard assumptions. The experiment, located in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy, is currently (2013‑2014) undergoing upgrades that will improve the CRESST detectors and shielding, making the experiment even more sensitive to evidence of dark matter."

Just wondering lol Whom is your target market? I'm guessing it'll just be your Average Joe, correct? In that case, do you think it'll be somewhat niche? Because I know I won't be using the 3D audio portion of this very often, just because I'm not in circmstances to warrant the use. But that's just me. Is the 3D capture more for personal use(like talking to people ala Bluetooth) or for capturing the sound of live events? Because I'm curious how you'd take a call on a bus with people all around you. You emphasis the importance of binaural recording, but aren't most professional recordings binaural anyways? A lot of songs and soundtracks are stereo to begin with. Of course, I guess this will come in most useful in live events, and the binaural recording will definitely make a difference compared to say a normal single iPhone mic. How good is the sound quality(for listening to pre-recorded audio like music)? How does it compare to other IEMs on the market? Because at $140, it seems like you're going to have to sacrifice sound quality in exchange for the ability to fit in the microphone and Bluetooth technology. How well does the recording work? Because while it may capture the sound, won't it still be affected by compressing, static, and other interferences? How long is the battery life? How do you charge it?   Thanks in advance for any answers, I find your invention quite fascinating."
TechnologyPorn,2wx8vm,OverweightPlatypus,6,Tue Feb 24 00:59:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, you're not the first one to ask this surprisingly. I hadn't noticed until some one else pointed it out. I contacted my web developer and he essentially said ""it brings more attention to the paragraph"" which I can't really argue with him on. I'm sure we'll change it, I just have bigger fish to fry right now.  I believe that 75% of our customers may never even use the binaural recorders. But that's okay, they may once and for me that's everything :-) That's why I made sure these would be great sound headphones as well. I believe our market can be everyone, but I know it will start with tech enthusiasts, teenagers and artists. The binaural mics will not be utilized for hands free calling, that would be a terrible phone call. They are to use with social media apps (snapchat, instagram, facebook) and the Hooke smartphone app. Correct, most professional recordings are binaural, but I want ALL recordings to be binaural, thusly I want ALL recordings to be professional. See where I'm going with this? No more pro-grade niche. The quality to compares to that of the Shure SE215s. Though ours are a dual driver where the shure se215 is a single driver. They're super isolating and utilize ambient pass through technology. This will slightly amplify whatever you are recording into the headphones so that it sounds and feels like you're not wearing earphones. I should be charging much more for these headphones. But that's not my goal, to make a ton of money. I just want people to discover binaural audio, and for everyone to try that, it has to be something they're able to afford to try. We are using a very specific bluetooth chip, one that only two other major companies are using. This chip allows very low latency HIGH quality recordings.

Right now our prototypes are clocking in about 8-10 hours, but we will know more on this once we receive a manufacturing sample in a few months.   That's actually pretty good. Is the battery pack noticeable(ie. is it bulky right behind the neck, or is a certain part heavier)? Have you tested for long-term use or weather degradation yet? How many years do you think the battery can last for before it starts losing its charge time(like how batteries start to degrade over time)? Also, how durable is it? Have you done testing on durability? Cause most IEMs I've had last about 6 months to a year, and those didn't have mics and in them."

TechnologyPorn,2ux5zj,techno156,13,Fri Feb 6 08:53:46 2015 UTC,"Server PSUs are generally pretty small in my experience. That doesn't mean they're not powerful.  There's really no reason for power supplies to be as big as they currently are.  It's just that the standard form factor was determined 20 years ago, and it's cheaper to make a power supply that big because you don't have to engineer heat flow and distribution very carefully, you don't have to use compact manufacturing, so you can use cheap phenolic single sided PC boards and cheap through hole parts and wave soldering.  A 1000 watt high end power supply could be made 1/3 the size of a standard supply or maybe even smaller, but it would cost more.  But OTOH it would almost certainly be more reliable."

TechnologyPorn,2ux5zj,billyalt,5,Sat Feb 7 04:17:41 2015 UTC,"Double-stacked fans are usually for redundancy rather than airflow or pressure, unless they're counter-rotating, in which case, it does increase pressure and airflow. The one /u/socialisthippie linked is definitely a counter-rotating one, probably 22k rpm ""intake"", 16k ""exhaust"", and over 70dB of noise.  EDIT: Oh, and PWM controlled with a thermal sensor installed at the intake, so they'll spin very slowly when they can."
TechnologyPorn,2ux5zj,ZeDestructor,3,Sat Feb 7 12:36:31 2015 UTC,I imagine it helps increase the amount of static pressure they are able to generate when there is only room for a couple very small fans.   I can't imagine the server engineers doing it if there weren't a very good reason. They do all sorts of airflow dynamics simulations to make sure stuff works as it should.  The reason you buy a prebuilt server from a brand name is because it's all very carefully engineered to work together with the enclosure and in a datacenter.   Does this mean you should do this in your computer at home? Absolutely not.

TechnologyPorn,2suopc,Maximio,6,Sun Jan 18 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"Cosmic radiation (high energy particles) will eventually destroy the ""pixels"" in the sensor when they hit them enough times.   All the cameras you see used for videos and still images are all replaced at relatively short intervals because of this. You can even see it in a lot of the videos shot on the ISS when they haven't done any postprocessing to remove the massive amounts of dead and stuck pixels in the images/video. It's quite easy to remove these artifacts (a lot of postprocessing software does this automatically), but I guess sometimes they forget to do it.  All space telescopes (including Hubble) has to have their sensors replaced as well. Even though they have massive shielding, and special sensors designed to cope with the radiation.

TechnologyPorn,2suopc,demux4555,1 point,Sun Jan 18 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"Also, this is not limited to cameras in space. Almost every CMOS sensor (as found in your regular DSLR) has some number of dead/stuck pixels. The camera's firmware accounts for them automatically by interpolating those missing pixels."
TechnologyPorn,2suopc,Compizfox,3,Sun Jan 18 23:50:01 2015 UTC,"No, unfortunately cameras do not 'automatically' interpolate dead pixels by themselves.   And the few cameras that has this feature, you have to enable it yourself, and it has to be calibrated as well.   Simply assuming a red, blue, similar ""stuck"" pixel is a dead/hot pixel would result in a lot of unwanted processing artifacts. Especially in high noise recordings (high ISO and low light), or when photographing subjects that actually have a lot of details that would mimic dead pixels.  Some cameras can do this in-camera, but other have to do it externally like this  If it was as simple as just turning on a feature in the cameras, they'd be doing this a long time ago on the Nikon dSLR cameras out in space to increase their life-span ten times.  EDIT: I think I misread your post, you probably meant dead pixels that originated during the production are already deactivated at the factory, and not that the camera is able to detect new dead pixels as it gets older."

Plum Brook Station (PBS) of article  Glenn Research Center:       The 6,400-acre (2,600 ha) Plum Brook field station near Sandusky, Ohio is also part of Glenn. It is located about 50 mi. from the main campus. It specializes in very large-scale tests which would be hazardous within the confines of the main campus.  The Spacecraft Propulsion Facility at Plum Brook Station (PBS) is the world's only facility capable of testing full-scale upper-stage launch vehicles and rocket engines under simulated high-altitude conditions. The PBS Space Power Facility (SPF) houses the world's largest space environment vacuum chamber. PBS also has cryogenic test facilities and a hypersonic wind tunnel.  In 2008 NASA agreed to pay $33.5 million to have its Plum Brook Reactor Facility decontaminated and decommissioned.

They always had exceptional design, but there would always be an unacceptable tradeoff (often battery life or unbelievably high cost for the specs). Add to that the bloatware loaded onto their machines (all manufacturers did this) and it's really not surprising they decided to leave the market.  Oh and their track pads absolutely sucked. Always. I know this was also a common problem amongst all manufacturers but if you drop $2000+ on a laptop, the track pad should at lest be usable!
