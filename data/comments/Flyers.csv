Took a buddy with me and flew into NYC from Arizona for my work. Arrived a few days early so we could take the train from Grand Central to the 30th street station. Had a hotel off Race street there in down town. Before the game, we walked all the way down Broad street to the Wells Fargo center. The whole day was so surreal and the energy of the city was just amazing. Once we got into the WFC we found that our seats were center ice, but WAAAAY up in the very last row. We could literally touch the ceiling. I remember it was the most intense event I've ever been to. The crowd was deafening. The goal horn was so much better in person than hearing it on TV. Every one in our section was super nice. Fit right in like a big family. High fives and cheers all around even after the game pouring into the streets. We partied up and down Race street that night and got to enjoy my first 3am WaWa roast beef sammich. So good. I fell in love with Philly that day. The next day we did the regular tourist type stuff and headed back to NYC to finish up the week for work. Since then I've hit up the Flyers every time they come to Phx and have been to a half dozen or so Coyotes games. Love live Hockey."

Flyers,3e24uj,Rustytire,2,Tue Jul 21 11:07:12 2015 UTC,"I'd really like to see this performed with age as well. Morin is reaching his third season after he's been drafted, but he's still a super young 20 years old.   It could quite be the fact that most kids are drafted at 17-18 now, and that'd make it a moot point."
Flyers,3e24uj,spilled_water,2,Tue Jul 21 12:49:37 2015 UTC,Missing one Mr. Roman Josi from the Draft +4 list. He's pretty good.
Flyers,3e24uj,tatrtalk,2,Tue Jul 21 13:26:30 2015 UTC,"I think the reasoning in this article is pretty flawed. Obviously time spent in development before joining the NHL impacts a player (I am not attempting to argue that), but I think they fail to look at things from the reverse angle.  The massive group of players in the 4+ group doesn't necessarily prove almost anything about their development time being excessive/stunting their growth. If a player isn't skilled enough (or as they classify it, ""bad""), then of course they wont get put in their 1st year, 2nd year, etc.   I agree with half of their analysis, but it's a two way street. Development time can impact a player's ultimate level of talent, but a player's level of talent also impacts how long they are kept in the development phase."
Flyers,3e24uj,-BilboFraggins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"Based on the evidence they showed, it tells me that the safest bet is 2-3 years after draft.  So basically next season, a couple of these guys should be ready for a full 82 game slate with the flyers."
Flyers,3e24uj,Flipadelphia26,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:17 2015 UTC,"The evidence they show counters my opinion a lot more than I would have expected. I feel than defensemen are better off slow-cooked. I feel like guys like Luke Schenn have had their development stunted by being thrust to the NHL level too quickly. However, this suggests that it is more upon the individual's talent than development.   Aaron Ekblad is great at hockey and will probably have an outstanding career. Playing him in the AHL probably wouldn't have benefitted him. I've always been of the opinion that guys like Morin and Sanheim will always benefit from playing at a lesser level professional league than the NHL. I'm not so sure now, though. Maybe we would be better off throwing Sanheim and Morin and Ghost into the fire next year together so they can grow together at the top level."
Flyers,3e24uj,OrangeAndBlack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:45 2015 UTC,they should start when they're ready and when the coaching staff/gm/scouts thinks they're ready. i dont think this is something you should even look into the average for. every player is different and you should treat them as such
Flyers,3e24uj,FlyersAndMusic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:18 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point of the exercise.  The writer starts with the question Hextall asked:   You guys want to do a project? Just go through the history of the game and young defensemen that have played at a young age and the path that they've gone on. It's dangerous. The history shows it. It's not just me saying things.    That's all ""thehaze"" is doing, attempting that project.  He's not prescribing some kind of unified theory."

If they thought we were going to take a forward and knew both they and CBJ were taking Provorov and Werenski it theoretically wouldn't affect who the Flyers would take.   The third rounder wasn't really to tempt them to not take Provorov; it was saying ""you're taking Forward-X anyway why not get this 3rd rounder as a bonus"". The Flyers weren't planning on taking a forward so it was all moot."

The winter classics of that time were CCM style. Especially if your winter classic has a fight strap it's def fake as they didn't retail authentics and the only way is to get an authentic is a team issue. The camo is legit though.

Flyers,3dyilm,Smokey_Jah,12,Mon Jul 20 17:32:59 2015 UTC,It's early in his tenure as Captain. He hasn't done as much with his captaincy as the others have yet. We'll wait until his captaincy time is over before we evaluate where he is.
Flyers,3dyilm,Blinsin,8,Mon Jul 20 17:38:31 2015 UTC,"It isn't too early to compare him to some other captains who did it for a similar amount of time.   Giroux has been captain for 3 seasons, it is reasonable to compare him to Pronger (1), Richards (3), Smith (1), Forsberg (1), Hatcher (1), Desjardins (3), Dineen (1), Tocchet (1), Sutter (2), Barber (2), Bridgeman (2), and Angotti (1).  It is too early to fully compare him to Primeau (5), Lindros (6), Poulin (6), Clarke (9), and Van Impe (5).  I think he is behind everyone in the second list, but ahead of everyone besides Desjardins in the first.   Giroux vs Richards is a very interesting comparison though."

Flyers,3dz5k6,incognitotho,7,Mon Jul 20 18:39:15 2015 UTC,"This should ease your worrying.  This is coming off the books after this season  Grossmann (500k salary retained) Gagner (3.2 mil) Schenn(3.6 mil) Medvedev (3 mil)  So that's 10.3 mil coming off the books after this season. Voracek will likely get a 4 mil raise which brings it to 6.3 mil. There are a couple other free agents coming off the books and couturier and baby schenn need to be re signed but they're RFA's so I don't expect it to break the bank  The season after however, Umberger, Streit, and Schultz come off the books freeing up 12.1 mil. That's 21.4 mil off by the end of next season. Subtract raises for Voracek, couturier, and schenn plus some misc signings and players hitting free agency, and we will have plenty of room"
Flyers,3dz5k6,FlyersAndMusic,2,Mon Jul 20 19:23:00 2015 UTC,Voracek will likely get a 4 mil raise which brings it to 6.3 mil.   No way Jake signs for 6 mil. If he repeats this year hell have teams lining up to sign him at 8 a year. He might take a hometown discount at 7.5 but no way he takes less than 7. BSH is saying 8 already. G gets paid 8.25. Jake deserves at least 7.5.
Flyers,3dz5k6,cslewisster,6,Tue Jul 21 01:16:25 2015 UTC,He meant we would have 6.3 million salary cap left after Voracek's 4 million dollar raise on top of his current contract.

Flyers,3dz5k6,FlyersAndMusic,2,Tue Jul 21 02:41:36 2015 UTC,"Doesn't that leave roughly 20 million to re-sign Voracek, Schenn, Couturier, and maybe a defenseman? That's not that tight of a spot. And that's assuming Hextall can't dump one of Amac, Vinny, or Umberger."

Flyers,3dyv4w,Rustytire,5,Mon Jul 20 17:27:18 2015 UTC,"The key nugget is this:   Assuming 30 shots a game are faced in these 30 games, this would mean that the Emery/Zepp duo would have allowed 96 goals. Neuvirth, in the same 900 shot random sample would likely allow only 77 goals. Given that 6 goals is worth a win in the standings, the swing from Emery-Zepp to Neuvirth is likely worth an extra 3 wins in the standings. So, right off the bat, the Flyers have improved themselves by 3 wins in the 30 games started by the backup goalie.   3 wins is 6 more points which would have taken the Flyers from 84 points to 90 last year.  This is an oversimplification, but 90 Points over the last several full seasons was good enough for a 21-15th finish in the League.  This while an improvement is still out of the playoffs."
Flyers,3dyv4w,CanadianCoffee,6,Mon Jul 20 17:39:43 2015 UTC,"It is still out of the playoffs, however, the team made improvements on the blue line and on offense in the offseason as well.

Flyers,3dyv4w,FlyersAndMusic,6,Mon Jul 20 18:33:46 2015 UTC,"New coach as well. I expect them to compete for a playoff spot this season. Doesn't mean they'll get one but barring injuries, I'd say this season is a failure if they don't at least compete for one"
Flyers,3dyv4w,CanadianCoffee,3,Mon Jul 20 19:13:27 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, it's very difficult to quantify what the team is going to look like right now.  That's not what I was attempting.  Since the off season began I've been trying to figure out what my own reasonable expectations are for this team are. I'm a fan and it's easy to let that get in the way of being objective about chances.  I think we can expect that the Flyers will be improved next year; however other than the addition by subtract of Grossman, the blue line has been largely unchanged (Really curious how Medvedev is going to adjust to the NHL defensively).  Given how improved the Metro and the East overall got so far, I don't think--defensively--we'll be improved to the point where a wildcard slot is likely (but certainly not impossible) with the team we have right now.  If I had to put money on where there Flyers finish, I'd target that range of 15-21, and split the difference at 18th.  We'll see!"

I was like ""Fuck yeah!"". Then, as I'm reaching for my wallet, the awesome old guy told the other dude to just give me the tickets. So he did. I got free tickets from the coolest old guy I've ever met. And to top it off someone gave my girlfriend a parking pass for free while I was in the box office. Great day. We lost, but it was still a great day."

Flyers,3drpyu,FlyersAndMusic,6,Sun Jul 19 02:28:39 2015 UTC,"The problem with shopping Lecavalier is there are at least a few better options avalible if you're looking to add a forward.  Here are a few with Lecavalier at the bottom for reference.

I'm not totally happy with the methodology as I think I'm probably ruling out some better options (Players who are slightly worse, but much cheaper and younger for example; also players who had a down year last year but should rebound--Like Semin perhaps) but at the very least I'd expect these 4 guys to be signed before Vinny is traded.  The best thing for all involved is to Lecavalier to come in and blow the socks off everyone by scoring at least 20 goals next year.  Then be traded.  Right now, I'm not optimistic."
Flyers,3drpyu,Rustytire,2,Sat Jul 18 23:31:09 2015 UTC,"What about the fact that he could be an asset to the locker room? If he's a ""leader"" on a team, could that be worth his contract? He's no Jagr but certainly an experienced player has to be worth something."
Flyers,3drpyu,leeagoldstein,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:20:42 2015 UTC,Maybe have ruined that impression here with Brube and his bad blood spilling out to the news? I don't get the feeling the Vinny is a well aged leader but rather a guy thats past his prime they can't admit it. I mean maybe that's the wrong impression but after the last few years its how I feel.
Flyers,3drpyu,cslewisster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:19:25 2015 UTC,"Expectations is a big factor too. People didn't know what to expect when Jagr came to town. Any production would have been positive, and he just happened to impart on valuable leadership. It was one year low risk high reward signing.  Lecavalier was signed to a large and long contract. It was expected that he could be at least a 2nd line scoring center who could contribute.. what.. 25-30 goals until a drop off a few years later? Remember that he was signed after they bought out Briere. People were hoping if he couldn't be a regular season scorer, he'd at least be a big time playoff scorer.  Media also has a role to play too. If there were more articles being written about how Lecavalier was holding after practice drills, the perception would be different. But the narrative writes itself. Aging former elite center signs long contract and doesn't mesh with new coach. Why write anything else?"
Flyers,3drpyu,spilled_water,2,Mon Jul 20 12:03:27 2015 UTC,Part of the issue is that Vinny had a terrible year partially because he was playing 3rd and 4th line wing instead of 1st or 2nd line Center. He had over 4 points last year and could potentially thrive on a team weak at centre. I still think he'd be a very good fit on Nashville or Arizona.
Flyers,3drpyu,DiabloCenturion,3,Sat Jul 18 23:37:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I think that if he were to play the position he is clearly more accustomed to, he would have been much more productive/useful.  I can't help but blame Berube for quite a bit of that, forcing Vinny to play a position he clearly wasn't doing well in instead of coming up with a combination to allow him to do better.  When you have a hammer, yeah, you can use a screwdriver to hammer a nail into place, but will it be as effective as using a real hammer?  Probably not."
Flyers,3drpyu,the-cat-killa,5,Sun Jul 19 01:37:17 2015 UTC,But if you have 6 screwdrivers and only need 4 one of those screwdrivers is going be used as a hammer and I'm pretty sure they all got a shot at screw driver and hammer except coot and g of course
Flyers,3drpyu,the-cat-killa,2,Sun Jul 19 13:39:06 2015 UTC,"True enough, true enough.  It was just frustrating to watch a team assemble a core so deep at C that the LW/RW were a little shaky.  As Vinny and to an extent, BSchenn have shown us, not all players can transition their game as strongly to another position.  Schenn, I think, can learn and improve--he's definitely young enough to.  Vinny, though... >.>"
Flyers,3drpyu,Rustytire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"Neither Schenn or vinny did good at wing. You could gamble and try to develop a younger schenn as a wing and he should be able to adapt being such a young player but it's definitely a gamble against his development. I still have confidence schenn could turn into a very good C 2 so I'm more inclined to build around g, couturier, and  schenn at center and fit the rest of the pieces from there. I like vinny and always loved watching him play when he was on Tampa he was awesome but the dude has definitely lost a step. Maybe condoning and the right training program will bring some of it back. If he can put up 20-25 goal type pace and not be a complete liability on defense I'd be good with him locked in the lineup though. Haxy would have to reward him with more ice time if that were the case."
Flyers,3drpyu,pooptits1,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, definitely.  We've seen that Schenn is much more comfortable at C, so I'd like to see Hakstol give Schenn that stability, instead of bouncing him all over.  I'm one of the fans that has faith that Brayden is going to emerge soon and start really making a name for himself.  Some players are able to excel in more than one position, others aren't, it's just the way it is.  Some of it is practice, some of it is natural skill--but if it's not working, I don't think berating the player and benching him constantly for not excelling in a new/different position is the key (i.e, Vinny).    Watching Vinny's decline has been depressing.  I was excited when the Flyers brought him on board (didn't like the contract, but hey, Vinny was a strong, competitive player).  Seeing him diminish like this is hard, you know?  And I can't even imagine how hard it is on him.  Part of it is age, sure, but I really think most of it has been that he's been pigeon-holed into a position he's just not good at.  I hope that they can work something out where he's in a spot he's comfortable with and where he's not a liability--those two things SHOULD coincide, I think."

Flyers,3dryk7,haunthorror,5,Sun Jul 19 04:50:57 2015 UTC,My guess is 16-17 season.
Flyers,3dryk7,infidelappel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:04:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't count on him being great any time soon. Big guys take longer to get good. Especially for a defense-men. Chara was pretty rough the first 10 years of his career, even pronger took a while to grow into the dominate force he became."
Flyers,3dryk7,Pepsibojangles,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:22 2015 UTC,"I agree.   He should spend at least a big portion of the season in the AHL, then compete in training camp 2016.  It still wouldn't be a bad thing if he spends 16/17 in the AHL as well.  Many Flyers fans will go crazy and label him as a bust if it happens, but it would not be that unusual of a development process."
Flyers,3dryk7,fly3rs18,10,Mon Jul 20 16:11:47 2015 UTC,I'd say I'm most excited about Sanheim...I think right now he's professionally at a noine and will be a top guy on our blue line within the next 2-3 years.

Flyers,3dryk7,Chabu350,19,Sun Jul 19 14:20:35 2015 UTC,I wanna see what Morin turns into. He's a huge person with a heavy shot and his skating has improved. I think his potential is thru the roof and he'll at least be a Tyler Myers-esque player.
Flyers,3dryk7,OrangeAndBlack,16,Sat Jul 18 22:11:57 2015 UTC,"Gostisbehere. I've watched him play one game, and I'm convinced every time he has the puck on his stick something exciting will happen.

Flyers,3dryk7,n_amato,14,Sat Jul 18 22:09:20 2015 UTC,While +/- is a terrible stat. Being a +11 in two games does say something.
Flyers,3dryk7,Blinsin,4,Sat Jul 18 23:05:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's only a good decent stat in extremes; like a -40 probably didn't have a great defensive season, but a +40 probably had a pretty good season all around."

Flyers,3dryk7,FlyersAndMusic,6,Sun Jul 19 02:24:22 2015 UTC,Hagg. I'm so excited for his well-rounded game.
Flyers,3dryk7,CanadianCoffee,9,Sun Jul 19 01:48:42 2015 UTC,"Most intriguing?  Konecny.  I wonder if his game will translate.  If it does, he could be a MSL type of player.  Most excited about?  Toss up between Sanheim and Cheese.  Both have #1 D potential."

Flyers,3dof78,Rustytire,16,Fri Jul 17 22:50:37 2015 UTC,"McDonald, Umberger and Lecavelier account for almost 20% of the cap. Ugh."
Flyers,3dof78,green-ketchup,11,Sat Jul 18 02:29:36 2015 UTC,I really want to know what Holmgren was thinking when he gave MacDonald that contract...
Flyers,3dof78,BattlingMink28,9,Sat Jul 18 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"This is just a guess on my part, but he was thinking that he wanted to contend for the Stanley Cup and his window was closing. To do that he needed defense.  Prospects weren't ready so therefore we needed to look to free agency.  MacDonald and the Islanders weren't able to come to agreement on an extension so Holmgren traded a 2nd and a 3rd pick to the Islanders for MacDonald.  Before MacDonald hit Free Agency, he was locked up at 5M for 6 years.  I think looking back Holmgren fell victim to the [Sunk Cost Fallacy].  Here's why (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs)   Holmgren wanted to contend for the Stanley Cup and his window was closing. To do that he needed defense.  I think this was true.  He needed to make a call between rebuilding or going with what he had.  What he had was a pretty big sunk cost in this team.  Remember, since the finals run of 2010 he had to think we just needed one more thing.  That first thing was Bryz.  Then Pronger got hurt and it became clear we needed someone to fill that gaping hole (we still do in fact).  Pronger was also pretty costly in terms of two first round draft picks.  Prospects weren't ready so therefore we needed to look to free agency. MacDonald and the Islanders weren't able to come to agreement on an extension so Holmgren traded a 2nd and a 3rd pick to the Islanders for MacDonald.  I went back and I think MacDonald might have been the best available free agent defenseman.  This isn't saying that we should have gotten him or that he was a good fit, just that he was the best available.  So you're Paul Holmgren, you've already decided that NOW IS THE TIME, and you've already rightly access that we need defense and that need will be filled via free agency.  MacDonald's your guy.  It costs you a 2nd and 3rd for him.  Before MacDonald hit Free Agency, he was locked up at 5M for 6 years.  A month goes by and if you don't sign him you're going to lose him.  You got this guy because you need him to win the Cup.  You already gave up two draft picks for him, so you pay him like a free agent D-man.  And that is $5M for 6 years.  One decision begets another and so on and so on.  I think looking back the right call would have been to start a rebuild a year earlier.  That means not signing MacDonald and not signing Lecavalier, but that's a pretty hard choice to make if you think we're close to wining the Cup after 40 years."

Flyers,3dof78,cslewisster,5,Fri Jul 17 23:41:42 2015 UTC,I'd think $3-4M at least.
Flyers,3dof78,BygmesterFinnegan,3,Fri Jul 17 23:47:47 2015 UTC,That also depends on what this year is like for him. Contract years players are notorious for breaking out. If that happens for him his price could very well rise significantly. He would be one hell of a sought after commodity. A shut down defensive specialist that can score.

Flyers,3dmdkf,Rustytire,16,Fri Jul 17 13:13:51 2015 UTC,He should be bought out. He is a waste of time and cap space. This article nails it bang on. I like Vinny. Like the article said hes a good guy he just isnt for new era of the NHL. Cut him loose. Move on.
Flyers,3dmdkf,cowpantz,23,Fri Jul 17 14:02:45 2015 UTC,If we buy him out he will be a slightly less waste of cap space for a longer period of time. We need the space in a couple years but can afford him for now so I don't think buying him out would be smart
Flyers,3dmdkf,longdongsilver3,13,Fri Jul 17 17:31:48 2015 UTC,I really enjoy reading his posts.  They seem pretty well thought out.
Flyers,3dmdkf,I_yell_at_toast,10,Fri Jul 17 14:02:45 2015 UTC,Meltzer is easily the best Flyers beat writer today. He is really level headed about everything he writes.
Flyers,3dmdkf,Blinsin,4,Fri Jul 17 14:42:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty excited when it was announced we were acquiring Lecavalier...but now I'm just really frustrated about the whole situation. I think it speaks a lot that Tampa bay buys him out and then they start finishing 2nd in the Atlantic division each year since and becoming contenders. He's just a waste of a roster spot that could easily be replaced with a young prospect. Do I think he could get 20 goals in a season still? Yeah, I think so but he's just too much of a liability so that 20 goals really doesn't mean anything in the end. I really think he's going to struggle in Hakstol's system and we probably won't see him much... waive that NTC Vinny, and finish your career on a better note hopefully"
Flyers,3dmdkf,flyersunion28,3,Fri Jul 17 15:20:24 2015 UTC,"I remember waking up and seeing that we signed Vinny and my only thought was ""I like him, but why did we get another center?.. and why did we sign him to such a long contract."" Since I was naive, I thought Holmgren knew what he was doing, but once again I'm stuck reading an article on how much of a bust he has become.   I hope we can move him to a team that has a need for him. We get cap relief and he gets to finish his career playing the game. Win-win"

Flyers,3dmbw6,Rustytire,6,Fri Jul 17 12:57:01 2015 UTC,I wonder if Schenn would been seen in a better light if JVR wasn't traded straight up for him.
Flyers,3dmbw6,infidelappel,5,Fri Jul 17 13:04:07 2015 UTC,Probably yes.
Flyers,3dmbw6,Suov,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"For sure. The thing is that expectations are key to every player. Basically, the flyers valued him as a 2nd overall pick (that's what JVR was). In the end, that 2nd overall pick ended up being some years of below average play and potentially a mid round pick if he's moved."
Flyers,3dmbw6,TheSunOfABeach,5,Fri Jul 17 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"Let's see how this year goes for him, he's only 25, I like him on the second pair with MDZ on his side. Before asking for a trade let's see how many of our prospects could be ready the following year and who else could leave to make some roster spots and bring some return.   I think Streit will get traded, probably at the trade deadline this year (with a year left on his contract he could be a good rental player, like Coburn was this year). Then we have Medvedev, let's see how he plays for us, I don't know a lot about this guy but he'll be 34 when the 2016-2017 season starts, trading him to a contender could be a solution too, with only 3M AAV he is a pretty cheap solution."
Flyers,3dmbw6,Frink94,6,Fri Jul 17 13:12:28 2015 UTC,"Schenn's in the last year of his deal and things being what they are impending prospect wise, I can't imagine we re-sign him.  With that in mind, if we can trade him for something (third or second rounder) we should--even with salary retained (because who cares for a few months).  That's why I think it's likely he's traded this year.  I agree that Streit is a prime trade target as well at the deadline--or at least I hope so.  Medvedev might be too, but 34 isn't that old for a blue liner and the 3M is only for a year.  I'm interested in seeing how he transitions from the KHL."
Flyers,3dmbw6,TheSunOfABeach,3,Fri Jul 17 13:19:55 2015 UTC,Isn't Medvedev 32?

Flyers,3dn2j9,bananafone7475,3,Fri Jul 17 16:38:10 2015 UTC,NFL contracts are not fully guaranteed. Therefore there's less cap implications depending on how the contract is structured. I'm sure you can cut them or buy them out but it's going to hurt the cap more than it would help.
Flyers,3dn2j9,recklessconsumption,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:51 2015 UTC,"Players can be bought out, but with big cap penalties depending on the structure, term, salary of the remaining contract. However, if the team AND the player mutually agree to terminate the contract, then there are no penalties."
Flyers,3dn2j9,Anthemz,3,Fri Jul 17 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"Or if you're Mike Richards and doing allegedly super shady stuff, then you can just have your contract terminated."
Flyers,3dn2j9,RLutz,3,Fri Jul 17 17:42:44 2015 UTC,I can't imagine this is going to hold up at the end of the day.  Ryan O'Reily just hit a Tim Horton's while drunk driving. He's still on the team.  The NHLPA is going to fight the Richards thing that tooth and nail.  Morality clauses probably shouldn't be get out of bad cap situation free cards.
Flyers,3dn2j9,Rustytire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:50:19 2015 UTC,"Admittedly I haven't been following the story that closely, but the rumor last I checked was that there were potential drug smuggling things and possibilities of not being able to cross the US/Canada border, which if that's the case, that's certainly grounds for contract termination.  The fact that it also happens to seriously alleviate cap woes is coincidental to having a player on the roster that can't go to a large percentage of your games."
Flyers,3dn2j9,RLutz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:53:40 2015 UTC,That's the only logical way i see the Kings winning.  If he has travel resrtictions then maybe they can pull it off.

Flyers,3dn2j9,jtn97,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:23:19 2015 UTC,"I saw Jackson getting out of a car outside of a club in Philly I worked door at, and they had a crew all with blunts in their mouths. Seemed legit. Too bad they got rid of him. We didn't get rid of Giroux for his ass-grabbing. I've always hated that ""you gotta be straight-laced and rep the organization"" mentality as long as you're not beating your wife and are showing up to play for real then I don't care how many blunts or asses you grab in your down time. I guess letting racists go would be cool with me too, but not because of the rep of the organization (cooper).  It's more of a, how can you put that shit aside, when you're supposed to view your team mates as your brothers but your own ignorance makes everyone on your team/around you feel uncomfortable deep down? That aint right and hurts the team in general. Idk. I don't get the eagles. Show-boating, blunts, and partying in your off time? BAD, keep it up we'll let you go. Racist on a team of more than one race? eh whatever were all professionals here."
Flyers,3dn2j9,illusorydoom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:15:10 2015 UTC,"Different teams different situation. Chip's building a locker room around an ideology. Maybe Cooper isn't actually a racist and that was a one time thing. Probably not but maybe. Jackson was known to disrespect the coaching staff and have a ""me first"" attitude. That doesn't fly in Kelly's locker room. He cuts Mathis too after Mathis turns down a new contract and requests more money and then goes on to skip practice when he doesn't get the money he wants. That's another me-first attitude that Kelly cut."
Flyers,3dn2j9,OrangeAndBlack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:17:44 2015 UTC,"I get that specific incident, but I still like Jackson. As for cooper? He's not even half as good as jackson, and I would take jackson's rebellious attitude and amazing play over coopers racism and shit play. I just think the NFL is way tougher on a lot of its players in what they do outside of the game and strict as shit compared to the NHL. There was a point where the flyers had to do a sobriety pledge because of all the partying but the organization seems more strict on player safety rather than what goes on off the ice with the NHL. I've seen a lot of NFL players basically ripped apart by the media and isolated by the entire league for some small things like that. In the end I guess it's a privilege to be in a league with big money but like I said if Ricky Williams smokes a blunt the night before the game the entire organization league loses it and talks about ""role models"" ""not being game ready"" blah blah. lol like the kids arent gonna smell weed and booze at the games they get to go to in the tailgating lots."

Flyers,3djkt7,SlapChopMyShamWow,21,Thu Jul 16 20:11:56 2015 UTC,I like the two years I wish it was less. Just outside what I'd have thought was comfortable. Wonder what he would have got in arbitration. I'm really thinking less than this
Flyers,3djkt7,cslewisster,17,Thu Jul 16 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"i agree. I think flyers overpaid him just a tad.  With that being said, I am glad to see him on our roster as a rent a player until our 5 rockstar defensemen are slaughtering Cindy on the ice."
Flyers,3djkt7,sportsdeck07,7,Thu Jul 16 20:22:34 2015 UTC,And he knows the situation we're in with our defence. He's our 2nd best D man and we don't have many other options other than to let him walk.
Flyers,3djkt7,IAmASkientist,5,Thu Jul 16 22:45:04 2015 UTC,"I think arbitration would have earned him around the same. He's still very young and coming off a bounceback year, that ain't cheap."
Flyers,3djkt7,SlapChopMyShamWow,8,Thu Jul 16 20:19:14 2015 UTC,"Also the risk of him getting too much and walking out as a UFA was very real.  He'd get 4.25-4.5 as a UFA for two years, I'd bet.  Hopefully Hakstol will use him properly and we will have a great deal on our hands for the next two years."
Flyers,3djkt7,fadetoblack1004,2,Thu Jul 16 21:13:14 2015 UTC,I thought Del Zotto would still have been a RFA? Anyway I really can't imagine a team paying him that on the open market. What comparables make you think he could have gotten that?
Flyers,3djkt7,cslewisster,3,Thu Jul 16 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"If a team walks away from an arbitration settled amount, the player becomes UFA.  A guy like Francois Beauchemin just got $4.5m per over 3 with decent D and .3 ppg, and he's practically ancient at 35.  MDZ put up 10g, 22a in 64 games, with a -5 on a pretty bad team, FB put up 11g, 12a in 64 games with a +23 on a way, way better team.  Ten more points in a totally mismanaged role, on a shitty team, ten years younger, and one less year on the contract.  $4.25 sounds about right."
Flyers,3djkt7,fadetoblack1004,0,Thu Jul 16 23:01:26 2015 UTC,I would have thought 3.25 through arbitration. Maybe they just didn't want to drag him through arbitration cause its not a nice process and they moved closer to his asking rather than drag him through the mud. They don't pull punches for arbitration and .5 mil per year isn't much in the grand scheme of things.
Flyers,3djkt7,cslewisster,3,Thu Jul 16 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly, id rather they pony up a couple hundred grand than risk bad blood given his history."

Flyers,3djkt7,gta0012,2,Thu Jul 16 20:46:59 2015 UTC,Oh sure. I mainly meant that I think we could have gotten him cheaper. The length of the contract is perfect.

Flyers,3djkt7,hockeyandcheapwine,4,Thu Jul 16 20:15:46 2015 UTC,Two years is perfect though. It'll give us him just until our D prospects are ready.
Flyers,3djkt7,cslewisster,2,Thu Jul 16 20:30:48 2015 UTC,Yep. I've got no problems with this.
Flyers,3djkt7,hockeyandcheapwine,20,Thu Jul 16 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of those numbers... But if he keeps up his performance from last season, it's a decent deal."
Flyers,3djkt7,lion27,8,Thu Jul 16 20:17:01 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with the two years, just the price is kind of higher than I wanted."
Flyers,3djkt7,defense87,5,Thu Jul 16 20:59:11 2015 UTC,But really if you think about it half a mill to keep him out of arbitration isn't that bad of a deal. If he agreed to this they probably we're really that much off from each others asking prices and dragging it through arbitration would have been bad for both parties.
Flyers,3djkt7,cslewisster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:33:18 2015 UTC,Keep in mind he's likely our top pair d man with streit. And he's gonna get paid for that position.

Flyers,3djkt7,mistergrime,5,Thu Jul 16 20:49:15 2015 UTC,When you put it that way it's hard to not like this deal
Flyers,3djkt7,CaptainButtGrabber,3,Fri Jul 17 00:14:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly putting it that way kind of makes me dislike the Nick Schultz deal. The fact that it cuts into the years that Couts, Schenn and Voracek need their extensions is baaaaddd for us."
Flyers,3djkt7,RainbowApple,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:06:25 2015 UTC,If we're not in a race at the deadline and he has another decent year Schultz will be easy to move for a pick
Flyers,3djkt7,the-cat-killa,2,Fri Jul 17 10:58:32 2015 UTC,"I really hope so. Realistically though, I see Schenn being moved over Schultz. Retain some salary making it a reasonable top 6 d man rental that can play top 4 on injury duty, could grab a solid 2nd rounder at least out of that. Move Schultz the year after that."
Flyers,3djkt7,RainbowApple,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:35 2015 UTC,Or the Schultz deal isn't good..
Flyers,3djkt7,Incepticons,5,Fri Jul 17 13:43:08 2015 UTC,"2 years at a reasonable salary. Would have been nice to lock him up a little longer, but it mitigates the risk and means he'll be up for a new contract when Provorov, Morin, Sanheim and Ghost Bear are (hopefully) all up.  Could be better, could be a whole lot worse. Welcome back MDZ!"
Flyers,3djkt7,biggulpshuh_alright,4,Thu Jul 16 20:17:00 2015 UTC,"If Del Zotto comes out like he did the 2nd half of the season, throwing hits and aggressive D with some beautiful goals, then I say he gets the A over Streit."

Flyers,3djkt7,Discourse_sotc,3,Thu Jul 16 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for around $3.25, but I think he earned his pay here. More importantly, the term is good. And I don't think Hexy makes that deal with the contracts we have expiring unless he has in ducks in a row."
Flyers,3djkt7,myxwar,3,Thu Jul 16 20:39:24 2015 UTC,It a tad high but im not complaining. He was one of our best Dman last year and will most likely be our best Dman this year. He will keep a top four spot warm until the youngsters are ready.
Flyers,3djkt7,Halfonion,3,Thu Jul 16 20:45:26 2015 UTC,"We have the space this year and he replaces Schenn's cap hit next year.  A little high, but also easier to trade if he doesn't pan out with shorter length."

Flyers,3djamj,mrmoustache8765,3,Thu Jul 16 22:05:54 2015 UTC,Gotta feel bad for the fact that he wanted to be a big part of a contender. It wasn't his fault that Holmgren threw a huge contract at him. I mean the reaction that we had to him was very much tied with that outrageous contract Homer threw at him. If we had a more reasonable contract you'd feel completely different about him.
Flyers,3djamj,cslewisster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:37:57 2015 UTC,It's a two way street. Yeah Homer was dumb to offer him that much but Bryz has some responsibility to live up to the contract he signed.
Flyers,3djamj,mrmoustache8765,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"Yup - Homer... Even though Snider came out and admitted he told Homer either he signs Bryz or he's fired... It's Homer....    http://articles.philly.com/2011-06-22/sports/29690025_1_salary-cap-ed-snider-ilya-bryzgalov  And I quote Snider -  ""It had to be done.  I was part of making it happen."" ...  Homer may have fucked the team up, but guys still don't seem to grasp the major moves, like the Bryz move failing, is what made Snider go ""Holy fuck, I gotta back off"".  Without that, Snider would still be trying to control the strings a la Jerry Jones."
Flyers,3djamj,tzoktzok,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:17:02 2015 UTC,"Fine, Snider whatever. My point is that Bryz shares some of the responsibility with the organization with how things turned out. When you sign a contract meant for an elite goalie then don't perform as such, you're gonna get shit on by the fans and in the media."
Flyers,3djamj,mrmoustache8765,0,Fri Jul 17 11:52:12 2015 UTC,"False on two accounts:  He and his agent thought he deserved a top goalie contract and top NHL player contract.  He wouldn't settle for less.  If it wasn't us, someone else would have made a similar mistake.  Sadly, it was us, and he benefited from playing for two good defensive systems.  He was downright atrocious in the playoffs before we acquired him and was even moreso terrible here.  It was easy to see him being a bad fit in Philly."
Flyers,3djamj,j42justin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:43:34 2015 UTC,Any reference for the bit about his agent and him not settling for less? That sounds like a stretch to me.

Flyers,3djamj,cslewisster,2,Sun Jul 19 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"Bryz wasn't a terrible goalie in philly, he didn't live up to expectations, or play even close to the level of his contract value, but he wasn't that bad. He was very inconsistent, but he was an average goalie. If he was on a 4 year 2m AAV deal he wouldn't have gotten as much hate as he did."

Flyers,3dkg69,DaytonaZ33,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:09:26 2015 UTC,I think it's just rare to have so many top notch defensive prospects about ready to step into the league at the same time on the same team. That why you never see this sort of thing.

Flyers,3dkg69,Leehblanc,6,Fri Jul 17 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"This isn't going to be a popular opinion, but...  I see one of the young guns being traded at some point, either for an older (30-ish) D-man to be their mentor, or for a forward.  Think about bringing Kimmo of 2010 onto the roster with those kids.  The things he could teach them about position, conditioning, work ethic, etc."
Flyers,3dkg69,bananafone7475,4,Fri Jul 17 12:58:24 2015 UTC,"And we seem to all be banking on all 5 of the big prospects to pan out to full time NHLers. Which is possible, but still a decent chance all 5 won't make that step."
Flyers,3dkg69,Leehblanc,2,Fri Jul 17 13:08:03 2015 UTC,"I think Prov, Ghost and Sandheim are locks.  I probably have to put Morin in that group too.  Hagg, Manning... they could be on the bubble.  It wouldn't surprise me if one of them is traded when their stock is high... again, for an older, calmer presence on the blue line."
Flyers,3dkg69,CanadianCoffee,2,Fri Jul 17 15:27:17 2015 UTC,"You're talking about Shea Weber, right? ;)"
Flyers,3dkg69,Flipadelphia26,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:07 2015 UTC,"Realistic.  Thinking all of Ghost, Hagg, Morin, Sanheim, Provorov are going to pan out and become NHL regulars, and or remain with the flyers is being extremely unrealistic.  Morin-Provorov Sanheim-"
Flyers,3dkg69,brivolvn7q,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"Realistically, none of the young guys make the team this year except as injury callups.  Next year, Morin and Ghost may play third pairing and get pp/sh time. If Provy makes the team he'll play ahead of both of them at even strength, prob paired with Streit. Sanheim is in the AHL and Hagg is the first callup / 7th defenseman.  The next year one of them is traded for forward help. Probably a big name winger. I can see it being Sanheim or Hagg, whichever one shows the most value the year before. At which point the top pairing is most likely Provy and Morin, Ghost is still playing third pair even strength but is quarterbacking the pp, and the other one that wasn't traded is playing second pair. This is a big year for the defensive group. Provy and Morin will make a ton of mistakes between them but they'll show flashes of brilliance as well. It's going to be a rough year as a fan of a team with four defensemen under 24, but it'll be worth it. This is the year that we find out if all four can play the nhl. One of them may be Ryan Parent, but they'll all get their shot just like he did.  This is the year where our defensive corps solidifies. They'll all make the team out of camp regardless of their struggles the previous year. Defensemen can make big jumps from their rookie year to their second season. Maybe one of them doesn't and he finds himself back on the Phantoms mid-season, but as a whole they'll be much better than they were the year before"
Flyers,3diw4k,CanadianCoffee,12,Thu Jul 16 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"He isn't going anywhere soon, at least another 2-3 years minimum.  He has 5 years left and it is a backloaded contract."

Flyers,3diw4k,iamalaskagrown,26,Thu Jul 16 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"I know that a voice of reason doesn't always fit in around passionate Flyers fans (because I am one myself) but all this talk about Andy Mac makes me feel compelled to make three points that are perhaps unpopular, but very correct.   Andy MacDonald isn't a horrible defenseman. He isn't a great one, and he is certainly overpaid, but he does have the skills to be on an NHL roster. He is good 3rd pairing guy, and on many teams a passable 2nd pairing guy. His contract IS garbage...but it is a sunk cost. (Google the term if you aren't familiar with it.) It is what it is. Unless the Flyers trade some good talent along with him, they aren't going to get to unload it this season. Get used to him being around and cheer for him to perform at his best. The team will need it. Andy Mac is apparently friends with Sidney Crosby. Get over it. I like to boo Crosby and I really like to boo the Penguins. However, Sidney Crosby isn't the devil, in fact, he is arguably the greatest hockey talent of his generation. MacDonald and Crosby grew up playing hockey together in Nova Scotia. No surprise that they went golfing this offseason together. It doesn't make Andy a bad Flyer.   <steps down from podium...dons asbestos fire suit> Flame away!"
Flyers,3diw4k,Anthemz,13,Thu Jul 16 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"MacDonald admitted that the weight of his contract hindered his confidence this past season. Last year was his first full season making 5,000,000 after only making 500,000 for 7 years in a row... that, plus the abysmal season and horrible coach we had last season, I am still able to give him a small benefit of the doubt. He's 28 years old, so he's not old by any means, so I am going to give him one more season here to prove me wrong. If he cashes in another season like last year then yes, I'll be pretty upset with his contract."
Flyers,3diw4k,TheSunOfABeach,5,Thu Jul 16 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"Let the guy play on the 3rd pair, he's not horrible, his contract is but that's not his fault. Maybe he'll profit from the new system and step his game a little, I don't expect him to become our top D-man, but he still can be usefull. With a contract that huge you can't just bench him, we have to try to make him fit."

Flyers,3diw4k,flyersfan114,3,Thu Jul 16 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"His advanced metrics place him around an average #6 defenseman / very good #7.

If he were getting 2mil a season on maybe a 3 year deal and didn't cost us a 2nd and a 3rd I assume most people wouldn't complain. But the reality is that we overpaid trading for him, overpaid on cap hit and gave way too much term. There's really no way to look past that until hextall can work some magic and trade his ass (fingers crossed!!!)."

Flyers,3diw4k,infidelappel,2,Fri Jul 17 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"True, he's a serviceable 3rd pair guy. But his contract makes him an albatross. I disagree that he's a 2nd pair guy on 'most teams.' His metrics have him pretty solidly in the #5-6 spot.  Yeah, we're stuck with it. Everybody would like him to live up to it - and that sure would help the organization - but let's be realistic: he's not getting any better than he always has been. Nobody really cares that he hung out with Crosby."

Flyers,3diw4k,MojoLoko,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:04:04 2015 UTC,"The only teams he could be a 2nd pairing on are the ones who are struggling to make the cap floor, his contract is worse than garbage, because you can at least move garbage on trash day, and if he's such good friends with crosby then trade him to pittsburgh for a 7th round pick. He can be best friends with letang on the top pairing and be a negative 40 player."

Lindros always had a Cooper/Bauer deal and Fedyk wore some ugly Winnwells. Also, rod always tucked in the right side of his jersey...like this picture."
Flyers,3dg8l9,the_llama26,2,Fri Jul 17 03:39:23 2015 UTC,What's the story behind it? Did they want to make a Lindros Flyers card before he actually played for the team?
Flyers,3dg8l9,ZachB10,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:21:29 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, card manufacturers were competing to be the first to issue Lindros' ""rookie"" card because he was the next generational player.  I think Score and Upper Deck both issued cards in before he was even drafted.  Score had him in his Junior uniform.  Upper Deck had him in his Canada Cup uniform.  But I guess some people consider the first card in NHL uniform to be a ""rookie"" card as well (or at least a more valuable card that would drive sales).  So when he was traded to the Flyers, some card companies used a picture of him from the press conference wearing the Flyers uniform, others (like Upper Deck in the card posted) pasted Lindros' face on another players body.  But no one knows whose body was used.  OP is saying that although many people think it's Recchi (or Fedyk -- because that would probably make manipulating the number easier), he thinks that it may be a goalie's body.  I don't remember this particular card, but I remember an ""in action"" shot of Lindros on the cover of the Hockey News or something right after he was traded (and before he played a game in uniform).  I remember being very confident at the time that it was Jeff Chychrun's body.  The world may never know...  EDIT:  In looking for the magazine cover, I came across this card of a jersey-less Lindros sitting in front of a dozen of so NHL jerseys.  I guess that's how desperate card companies were to have the first card of him with his NHL jersey in the picture."

Flyers,3dg8l9,PhillyT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:07:42 2015 UTC,"As far as I remember, it was either Brindamour or more likely Fedyk's body. Right around '93 or '94 I went to a practice at the old Cherry Hill practice arena to hang out and get autographs. Yuskevich broke his stick over his knee during the practice and they tossed it in the dumpster, but I grabbed it first. A guy traded me 2 of these Lindros cards and a few Lindros rookie cards from Fleer and some French Canadian brand for the broken stick because ""Yuskevich was his favorite player"".

Flyers,3df0ci,brivolvn7q,3,Thu Jul 16 13:49:15 2015 UTC,"The ticket drive has been successful, but what people aren't thinking about is the tourism.   It doesn't have any major sports (Maybe a college team & their arena team). That setup has worked well in OKC for the Thunder.   Also, Millions of people travel to Vegas every year. Having an option other than seeing a musical or magic act is an amazing thing, and the arena is just off the strip (Between NYNY & the Monte Carlo, so there isn't an excuse for it being hard to get to.   Honestly, I like the idea of a team being in Vegas.   I do think that the league will have to work with the Nevada gaming board to bar taking bets on the team,  otherwise I can see the headline a few years down the road, when players throw the game, or some other corruption charges."
Flyers,3df0ci,dademan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"Expanding to Canada is not a favorable business option because so much of the country watches the NHL anyway. There's little room for actual growth. What the NHL wants to do is go into areas where hockey is relatively unknown and turn a big city into a city of hockey fans. Nashville is a great example of this.   I'm not personally opposed to more Canadian teams, but that's the mentality. Don't expand to a market you already own."
Flyers,3df0ci,OccamsRaiser,3,Thu Jul 16 12:24:30 2015 UTC,"What the NHL wants to do is go into areas where hockey is relatively unknown and turn a big city into a city of hockey fans. Nashville is a great example of this.    Except this doesn't work very well, Nashville has a decent fan base but it is still one of the smallest markets in the NHL and not really a ""hockey city"".    A team in Quebec would instantly be more valuable than Nashville or a similar city."
Flyers,3df0ci,fly3rs18,2,Thu Jul 16 12:56:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the notion of Quebec being more valuable. The franchise would likely make more money, but where the NHL gets rich in the big picture is not by pandering to its current fans, but by growing the game for new fans."
Flyers,3df0ci,OccamsRaiser,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:12:11 2015 UTC,"I was referring to the value of the individual team, for example the Flyers are worth 625 million.    I think a team in Quebec would very quickly be worth more than Nashville or some other small market.   That money comes from local TV deals, ticket sales, merchandise, etc.   Quebec would instantly be a big success in those areas, whereas a team like Nashville or Columbus struggled when they first came in the league."

Flyers,3df0ci,vandebries,5,Thu Jul 16 20:32:46 2015 UTC,"The Las Vegas team could look something like Mike ribiero, Mike Richards, Ryan Malone, Jarret Stoll,"
Flyers,3df0ci,bestbiff,9,Thu Jul 16 00:00:13 2015 UTC,"Overall I don't think there should be an expansion at all. I realize it's too late to do anything about it at this point but an expansion just doesn't seem like a good idea right now. The league isn't healthy enough for it no matter how much we like to think it is. The NHL makes money and is constantly increasing profits but if you look at the teams you wouldn't think that. Teams like Edmonton, Florida, Buffalo, and Carolina all have been struggling. They have a combined 8 playoff appearances in the last 10 seasons. These are teams that most likely don't want to thin out the talent pool. On top of that they will have to give up the players they have for the expansion draft.   Also keep in mind that when a team enters the league (doesn't matter if it's Las Vegas, Seattle or Quebec City) it's going to suck. How long they suck is up to management but they will suck. We could have a situation like Nashville who have been pretty successful for a newer team. But more likely than not were going to have a team like Columbus or Atlanta/Winnipeg who either haven't won a playoff game or just recently won a playoff game after being in the league for 12+ years.   More importantly if you're a fan of any team in the NHL why would you want more teams in the league. More teams means lower chance of making the playoffs (especially now that the talent pool has been spread out). It also means having different draft spots. Imagine if we picked two spots up or down in 2006. Overall the NHL should put more focus on making the teams it has successful before adding more."
Flyers,3df0ci,zuken932,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"Teams like Edmonton, Florida, Buffalo, and Carolina all have been struggling. They have a combined 8 playoff appearances in the last 10 seasons.   There are some struggling markets, but there will always be struggling teams.  It doesn't change things if there are 30 or 32 teams, there will always be good teams and bad teams.   The NHL does need to work on the small markets.   I think Florida and Arizona should move.  But the teams you listed, such as Edmonton, are struggling because of poor management and poor development.   There is nothing the NHL can do about that, it is the team's problem.  Once they become a good team they will have a massive fan base, Buffalo too.  It is unrelated to potentially adding 2 teams.   More importantly if you're a fan of any team in the NHL why would you want more teams in the league. More teams means lower chance of making the playoffs (especially now that the talent pool has been spread out). It also means having different draft spots.   First off it would not change the playoff chances for the Eastern Conference.  It would just balance the west to the same as the east.   Either way this and the draft is not a good reason to be against expansion.   The goal is to grow the NHL as a whole and create a balanced league.     Also keep in mind that when a team enters the league (doesn't matter if it's Las Vegas, Seattle or Quebec City) it's going to suck. How long they suck is up to management but they will suck.    This is not necessarily true, and we should be the first ones to realize this as Flyers fans.  We were founded in 1967 and won our two cups in 74 and 75.  It is entirely possible for one of the new teams to succeed within the first few years, that is especially true in our free agent era.  If the team isn't afraid to spend to the cap then they can get some real talent.  Small market expansion teams like Columbus were not able to spend that money, and it caused they to struggle for many years.   I'd hope that Vegas/Seattle/Quebec would be able to spend."
Flyers,3df0ci,fly3rs18,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:13:26 2015 UTC,"Also the watering-down of talent. There are only so many NHL-quality players out there, and the quality of hockey is what we make of it. However, I do think that is why the NHLPA loves expansion: 40 new NHL jobs, 40 new AHL jobs."
Flyers,3df0ci,thespacebetweenus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"You also have to consider that when more players have a chance to play in the NHL/AHL then there will still be a certain percentage that break out and become NHL quality.   With how quick international scouting has grown in recent years, there is absolutely more talent to be discovered if given a good opportunity."
Flyers,3df0ci,fly3rs18,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:28:27 2015 UTC,"The counter I have to this is that the talent in the league has never been better. If you compare 4th lines now with 4th lines from 2000 it's not even close. There was a post in r/hockey saying the reason no one broke 100 points this season is the superstar forwards had much lower ATOI than years past. Teams are rolling four lines these days way more than they ever did simply because the 3rd and 4th lines are more than serviceable.  Plus with the financial troubles the khl is in, the nhl will have more foreign players coming to NA in the coming years.  In my opinion the league wouldn't be hurt by a ""watering down"" of talent as much as you might think"

Flyers,3df0ci,wasthatoutloud,0,Wed Jul 15 20:36:31 2015 UTC,"Currently there are 14 West teams and 16 East teams, unless we realigned (again) we will need two new Western Conference teams to balance out the numbers.  I'm down with SEA as they have shown they are good sports fans and are too big a city/market to have only two of the big four (they do have a great Soccer base too).    As for LV, I'm ok with it.  I know everyone is concerned with Las Vegas having a sports team as it is the betting capital of our country but they will get something sometime and I think hockey might be the best experiment for them.  Besides people who go to Las Vegas love to see live shows and I don't know anything better than watching hockey live in person.  Both markets have the potential to be revenue generators, and there is nothing more I think that we need is to have the Increase in cap space to allow teams to have greater flexibility.  This would help the Flyers as we know they have the revenue to be able to spend money."
Flyers,3df0ci,FlyersAndMusic,3,Thu Jul 16 07:10:53 2015 UTC,"im pretty sure the nhl has tons of employees well more qualified to predict the pros and cons of this. they did a ticket drive type thing and it sold very well and met their needs. it would balance the conferences which would be pretty cool. and, my selfish reason im for it, the expansion draft where we could possibly unload amac or umberger"

Flyers,3df0ci,fly3rs18,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"As long as tickets are being sold, it doesn't matter if it's a casino. Either way it's revenue for the team and for the league"
Flyers,3df0ci,willdesignforfood,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:00:12 2015 UTC,"The ""novelty"" only applies to people that live there or go there often.   Vegas constantly has new people who will still have that novelty.  Plus you will have tons of NHL fans traveling there to see their team play.  I would absolutely go to there to see a Flyers game, that would be awesome."
Flyers,3df0ci,OrangeAndBlack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"But when you're starting a new team you need to think more about the fundamentals of brand building. Traveling fans are a drop-in-the-bucket compared to a strong hometown fan base. You also don't want to be beholden to businesses buying up the tickets and the seats sitting empty. You'll end up in a similar situation the Panthers are in. Those tickets are often sold at steep discounts or given away for free which then devalue every other ticket sale. Why should I pay full price from the team when I can simply visit a Casino spend $20 at the slots and receive a free ticket to the game (I used to take advantage of some of the same marketing strategies employed by casinos when taking the bus down to Atlantic City). Las Vegas as an expansion city is very risky. Putting a team there is shortsighted and I don't think it is long term viable.  Also, you need to look at the ownership group. The Maloof family is involved. People forget about the Kings (NBA) they pumped money into the team in an attempt to move it to Seattle and when that fell through they cut and run. They also bought an WNBA team that eventually folded when they couldn't sell it.  Sure, the NHL is flush with cash right now from TV deals and I think expansion is a good idea, but Vegas in my eyes is a big risk and with the uncertainties surrounding Arizona, I think Vegas is a risk they don't need to take. Seattle, Quebec City, or even Milwaukee (if the Bucks get the new arena) would be better long term investment."

Flyers,3df0ci,TeamWitchwood,2,Thu Jul 16 06:23:23 2015 UTC,"I live in downtown Baltimore now, it is a bad idea to add a team here.  There is very very little hockey around here, it was difficult to find a pickup league to play in and a rink to use.   We play on a basketball court with a crappy fence for the boards since there are no real rinks around here.   When I lived near Philly there were multiple nice rinks within a few minutes of me.   There are also zero stores with hockey equipment, besides the crap at sports authority.  I need to go to DC or Philly to buy anything.  If they did get a team here then it would help to grow the sport, but I don't think it is worth it right now.   I think there are many better options that deserve it more than Baltimore."

And two, the native folks probably don't have much of a base of youth hockey as it's a desert.   Ok, neither does California, but they have a huge population base. Florida teams are a mixed bag- Tampa Bay has been as high as #8 and as low as #13 in attendance rankings in the last 4 years. Florida was dead last this past season. Arizona is perhaps worst, never getting higher than #28 in the last 4 years.  Seattle would clearly make more sense, except that they'd be fighting for Vancouver fans.  So why not Portland? Could share an arena with the Trailblazers. Or Quebec City? I can't believe these are the only two options."

A lot of soccer fans that I know [also being one myself] are also hockey fans, I think that the sports and their respective cultures seem to attract a lot of the same types of people. Seattle being a great soccer town could give us a good idea of how they'll do as a hockey town. Also having a built in rival in Vancouver will really help the team along as well."

I even see Laughton and Cousins on the phantoms this year, which makes sense imo. I see this year as a give the young guys another year to develop including Laughton and give the older guys a year to fit in and almost try out to be on this team in the future. I think the schenn bros, Medvedev, our 4th line, Gudas, lecavalier, Schultz, gagnier and even raffl are all on 'do they have a future with us' terms right now. The most we might see is Manning and Laughton maybe when injuries come around. But in contrast, I bet next year we'll be seeing 3-5 young guys crack the lineup. Maybe provorov, ghost, Morin, Laughton and Cousins."

Flyers,3d9h6k,_Slate,-11,Tue Jul 14 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"Coots was never supposed to be a defensive stud in the NHL, but was instead supposed to be an offensive powerhouse."
Flyers,3d9h6k,Chriscftb97,13,Tue Jul 14 15:29:10 2015 UTC,Not really. Virtually every scouting profile pimped his two way game and d zone face offs. A big part of his draft ranking slide was that people thought he wouldn't be offensively great in the NHL.
Flyers,3d9h6k,infidelappel,11,Tue Jul 14 15:39:03 2015 UTC,He also had Mono so people thought he wouldn't be as strong as he was.
Flyers,3d9h6k,Blinsin,3,Tue Jul 14 15:50:05 2015 UTC,"""I once thought I had mono for an entire year; it turned out I was just really bored."""
Flyers,3d9h6k,HI_Handbasket,-5,Tue Jul 14 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it wasn't projected that it would turn out like this. He had been project to be a top 3-5 pick with huge offensive upside for his whole draft year."
Flyers,3d9h6k,Chriscftb97,3,Tue Jul 14 15:41:13 2015 UTC,"Turn out like what, exactly? He's not done maturing.   And actually, it was. Most had him a 1C at best, but a 2 or 3C as realistic options. His draft year PPG were touted as a sign of potential but he was always given big offensive question marks. He's been pretty well as advertised: a defensively solid 3C who may yet grow into a 2C role with better usage."
Flyers,3d9h6k,infidelappel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:59:05 2015 UTC,Looking at scouting reports I guess you're right. He was touted as 1-2 line 2-way center with 60-70 point potential
Flyers,3d9h6k,Chriscftb97,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"Why would anyone draft a 3c in the first round, much less the top 10? I'm all for limiting expectations, but theres no reason to reimagine the past."
Flyers,3d9h6k,PhillyT,3,Tue Jul 14 16:48:07 2015 UTC,"He was a safe pick with upside. He had 1-2 potential, but the one thing everyone knew they'd at least be getting was a solid defensive middle center.   I'm not reimagining anything, just go back and read what was written about him in 2011.  http://www.inlouwetrust.com/2011/6/10/2212211/sean-couturier-not-done-yet-2011-nhl-entry-draft-prospect-profile  The common theme in all those quotes? Defensive play. Yes, there was big upside but he slid because nobody was sure he could bring the offense in the NHL, yet he was still taken high because at the very least he was projecting as a great 2-3C. Which he is still developing toward.   The revisionism comes from people pointing him with their disappointments claiming he was drafted to be a sure fire offensive Dynamo. That was be best case scenario, not the expectation."
Flyers,3d9h6k,infidelappel,3,Tue Jul 14 17:01:06 2015 UTC,Agree with everything you said. Except I wouldn't pigeon hole him as a 3c quite yet. He's had at least one horrible line mate every year and is still 22. I see him becoming a quality 2C with elite shutdown potential.
Flyers,3d9h6k,flyersfan114,5,Tue Jul 14 17:11:05 2015 UTC,I agree. He's still young as hell. People writing off his offensive game are typical shortsighted Flyers fans without patience.
Flyers,3d9h6k,infidelappel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:40:38 2015 UTC,I wish I could up vote this more than once.  If you look at elite defensive centers who have offensive game as well (Bergeron is the only one off the top of my head) didn't fully develop an offensive game until their 5th NHL season.
Flyers,3d9h6k,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:42:31 2015 UTC,"Well, Bergeron broke 70 points at age 20, so he's not the best comparison. But his usage was far more offensive than Coots. He still got two way assignments, but he also got first PP. He and Toews are also the best two-way centers of their generation (arguably).  And that's the thing - Coots may not be as good a two way player as Bergy or Toews. That's a high ceiling to demand that he hit.. And if we go by pure numbers, then no, he absolutely hasn't done as much offensively as those sorts of guys have at his age.  But he also hasn't been put in nearly the same positions to succeed, so it's impossible to say that he couldn't. In any case, assuming that what he's displayed at his young age is all he's got is absolutely silly."
Flyers,3d9h6k,infidelappel,2,Thu Jul 16 02:14:31 2015 UTC,"Calling him a 3C is semantics, he's the 2C who is forced into a more checking roll b/c the ""second"" line can't hold their own worth a damn and needed to be sheltered. He's got like the 2nd most ice time of any center."

Flyers,3d61lu,ClassicSwarley,4,Mon Jul 13 23:10:42 2015 UTC,My understanding is its a neutral party that hears both cases and looks at what both sides wants and with that information finds a fair compromise.
Flyers,3d61lu,Enter_Chandman,2,Mon Jul 13 23:23:44 2015 UTC,So it's not like baseball where each presents a number and their argument and the neutral party chooses one of the presented numbers with no compromise?
Flyers,3d61lu,rubbernub,2,Tue Jul 14 03:55:23 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I've never looked into it myself but was informed by some one and a few agreed with him so I went with it.
Flyers,3d61lu,Enter_Chandman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:36:38 2015 UTC,There is a compromise.   It is usually pretty fair and reasonable.

Flyers,3d61lu,zach2thefuture,6,Mon Jul 13 22:25:37 2015 UTC,That's a little too much in my opinion for a guy who has had a poor career until last year. I'd say a year or 2 for around 2mil
Flyers,3d61lu,10phillyphan,2,Tue Jul 14 02:44:21 2015 UTC,"Paul Holmgen, is that you?!"
Flyers,3d6i8o,r35h93,4,Mon Jul 13 22:20:08 2015 UTC,Does he play LW or C?
Flyers,3d6i8o,Thursdeh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:39:40 2015 UTC,"Center, but he'll probably be stuck on the wing. I'm expecting a season similar to Akeson's last year."
Flyers,3d6i8o,Chriscftb97,2,Tue Jul 14 00:17:01 2015 UTC,"That's harsh seeing as axe really didn't get a fair shot.  I knew penciling him in on the 4th line was basically writing him off, he isn't going to contribute in a checking role, and there wasn't space for him in the top 9"
Flyers,3d6i8o,PhillyT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's rough. I think Cousins will get pushed out in favour of other players."
Flyers,3d6i8o,Chriscftb97,3,Tue Jul 14 12:53:53 2015 UTC,"He also scored the first hat trick in Lehigh Valley Phantoms history.   I like him, but since we are so overloaded with Centers I don't think he will make it to our team. He isn't going to jump above Laughton on Center depth, and now with Konecny coming in I don't see him jumping a head of him also."
Flyers,3d6i8o,Blinsin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:02:12 2015 UTC,"Does he crack the flyers line up? I would expect to see him in and out, but don't think he will ever be more than a bottom 6 fwd"
Flyers,3d6i8o,Epoke28,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"I liked him with Rinaldo and White. He came close so much to getting a point and threw some of the cutest check attempts. I cross my fingers he gets more of a chance to put in some more NHL games, with the Flyers or not."
Flyers,3d75yg,Epoke28,5,Tue Jul 14 01:26:19 2015 UTC,In arbitration do they just bash the shit out of him to drop the price and then he over sells himself to pick it up?
Flyers,3d75yg,Juge88,14,Tue Jul 14 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think they run his stats through NHL '14 and let it spit out the salary he wants in the game and call it a night"
Flyers,3d75yg,fly3rs18,3,Tue Jul 14 02:04:41 2015 UTC,Hopefully no one plays the last game of the season on rookie.
Flyers,3d75yg,infidelappel,3,Tue Jul 14 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes. Players have been reduced nearly to tears in arbitration before. This is why most players and GMs prefer to avoid it."
Flyers,3d75yg,tzoktzok,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"True, but usually in cases where both parties seemingly are fine with arbitration, what happens is this - player A hears, and understands, the reasons for the offer from team B, but still believes the offer is under market value.  What usually happens is team B is going to tell the arbiter everything they told the player, and the player will talk about market value.  Where it gets really ugly is when the player disagrees with the teams assessment of the player and value.  Turns into a whole mess, with players, yes sometimes getting very heated and emotional.  By Hextall and even MDZ's camp not being aggressive, or heated in the press, or anything, but everyone calm and almost happy, I'm guessing MDZ agrees with the teams assessment of him, so MDZ is just going to argue the market rate of defense is higher, not that he's a 1A pairing and Hextall is a megalomaniac poopyhead.  So no one is really is really expecting this to go crazy."
Flyers,3d75yg,infidelappel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"Not true. There have been arbitration cases that went south that were quiet in the press before hand.   It's hard to tell how these things will go. In MDZ's case, he's been perceived as borderline unemployable for the NHL. To that end, I would imagine he's not going to be happy with a lot of the things said about him in arbitration if it goes there.  If anything, teams who seem to have good relationships with the player filing for arbitration are that much less willing to go all the way to arbitration because those relationships can be poisoned real fast.   It's more likely that arbitration was being used by MDZ, in this case, just to set a deadline to speed up negotiations and give them an end point. I'd be surprised if they wind up going to the actual hearing."
Flyers,3d75yg,Juge88,2,Tue Jul 14 20:55:13 2015 UTC,"They base some imaginary number he is worth off of previous stats and season in the NHL, then force the Flyers to pay it or let him become a UFA. I would imagine his bad year where nobody wanted him would be a big factor... maybe"
Flyers,3d75yg,fly3rs18,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:38:56 2015 UTC,Oh alright I wasn't sure. I just didnt want them telling him he's shit and him saying he's a top pair d.
Flyers,3d75yg,IAmASkientist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:42:39 2015 UTC,I just hope they don't make the Flyers give up too much or let him walk. They are already cap restrained and Del Zotto has to remember the time where he was almost done playing pro hockey until the Flyers gave his another chance.
Flyers,3d75yg,I_dig_geek_stuff,3,Tue Jul 14 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"We have 4.4 mil available right now, MDZ is not getting more than that.  We should be fine if we stick with the roster we have, saving a little space in case we need depth later on."
Flyers,3d75yg,infidelappel,3,Tue Jul 14 04:26:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think this reaches arbitration, both sides want to get the deal done and this is MDZs back-up"
Flyers,3d75yg,Centauris,3,Tue Jul 14 02:28:31 2015 UTC,I'd be happy with a 3x3 or 3x3.25 contract. It think that's fair given the sample size on MDZ
Flyers,3d75yg,infidelappel,4,Tue Jul 14 01:42:41 2015 UTC,"I would put him at about 2.75 or 3. At that price more years the better, but it's still risky since the sample size is small"
Flyers,3d75yg,dejatoo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:49:14 2015 UTC,I thought arbitration awards were for a single year.
Flyers,3d75yg,bestbiff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:35:27 2015 UTC,they are.
Flyers,3d75yg,PhillyT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:53:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, but they still have until that date to come to an agreement which can be multiple years"

Flyers,3d50ic,Epoke28,13,Mon Jul 13 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"If he can prove he belongs in the team in camp, I say we met him play a couple. I'm just really excited to see him haha"
Flyers,3d50ic,Flyingchairs,8,Mon Jul 13 16:49:15 2015 UTC,"He can play 7 before getting sent back, correct? I still think another year in juniors would be ideal. He can't get worse down there, right? By then the blue line may be a little less crowded and will also have Ghost,  Morin and Hagg looking to move up. Sanheim in another 2 years probably?"
Flyers,3d50ic,MojoLoko,9,Mon Jul 13 16:55:14 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that it's 10 games to decide whether a player is returned to juniors or not.
Flyers,3d50ic,Flyingchairs,0,Mon Jul 13 17:19:01 2015 UTC,Someone find this out haha
Flyers,3d50ic,flanneled_man,8,Mon Jul 13 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"It's essentially a nine game trial period.  Once junior players appear in their 10th game, the contract would kick in."
Flyers,3d50ic,n_amato,0,Mon Jul 13 17:35:23 2015 UTC,According to this article in 2011 it looks like it's 10 games

Flyers,3d50ic,IAmASkientist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:45:35 2015 UTC,I think you're right. I jumped the gun too quickly
Flyers,3d50ic,cslewisster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:49:33 2015 UTC,"I think Sanheim makes the team before Morin. Once he puts on some weight, he will be ready"
Flyers,3d50ic,FlyersAndMusic,3,Mon Jul 13 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"According to reports, Sanheim is 198 pounds. I find that so hard to believe. He looks closer to 160. I think Morin has to improve more, but he will be playing pro hockey, so I think he will develop quickly"
Flyers,3d50ic,fly3rs18,3,Mon Jul 13 17:50:44 2015 UTC,I think sanheim goes back to junior if he doesn't make it this season. Next year he's eligible for the phantoms. I could be wrong though
Flyers,3d50ic,FlyersAndMusic,4,Mon Jul 13 18:10:01 2015 UTC,Sanheim isn't making the team. It would blow my mind if he isn't in juniors this year. Best chance to make it would probably be Ghost
Flyers,3d50ic,Thursdeh,3,Mon Jul 13 18:52:14 2015 UTC,Ghost doesn't have much of a shot. He missed almost all of last season and still has to learn to play in his own end at the pro level.
Flyers,3d50ic,JFlyers00,2,Mon Jul 13 20:37:30 2015 UTC,"Ghost's injury last year has set him back, he's going to need time in the Phantoms first - might get the call in the second half of the season"
Flyers,3d50ic,JFlyers00,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:03:06 2015 UTC,Man I can't wait to see him play. BSH's reports on his offensive ability have me getting hard just thinking about it.

Flyers,3d6sdg,Red6hoser,30,Mon Jul 13 23:51:34 2015 UTC,Pronger
Flyers,3d6sdg,freewheelinCW,3,Tue Jul 14 00:23:15 2015 UTC,I'm sad we don't have him to mentor our prospect defensemen. Him and Timonen molding those guys into young versions of themselves would be amazing.
Flyers,3d6sdg,annoyinglyclever,5,Tue Jul 14 14:29:09 2015 UTC,I feel like one of the puzzle pieces we're really missing especially in Kimmo's absence is a real defensive leader.

Flyers,3d6sdg,jfooman,3,Tue Jul 14 04:49:03 2015 UTC,"Probably. While Lindros carried many of those mid-90s teams, the late 90s and early 00s had really well rounded teams that could have used a superstar in Forsberg. One thing Forsberg had over Lindros is longevity. It's not hard to imaging Forsberg being on that 2004 Lindros-less squad that was a game away from facing an 8th seed in the finals.  (There was a thread in /r/nfl about what you are still salty about, and I'm definitely still salty about 2004.)"

Flyers,3d6sdg,Blinsin,14,Tue Jul 14 00:42:06 2015 UTC,Going with organizational need here.  John LeClair to play on G and Jake's left wing.

Flyers,3d6sdg,king_ian_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:35:24 2015 UTC,"He would be an absolutely perfect fit.

Flyers,3d6sdg,hawks27,2,Tue Jul 14 00:53:04 2015 UTC,It is mostly because of the age of most people here.  It is mostly 90s/00s references since that is when most people here grew up watching the Flyers.     But Clarke was still probably the best player in Flyers history.
Flyers,3d6sdg,fly3rs18,0,Tue Jul 14 02:04:17 2015 UTC,It's a thread on injecting a player into the lineup to provide the most immediate benefit.  The game has changed too radically for any player from that or previous eras to step right in and play to their strengths right off the bat. He would likely need a lot of time to simply adjust.
Flyers,3d6sdg,_Slate,6,Tue Jul 14 15:08:50 2015 UTC,Either Bill Barber (Possibly LeClair) or Mark Howe for me.

Flyers,3d4fz1,Jbonner259,0,Mon Jul 13 20:57:34 2015 UTC,I still believe it. He came in to be part of Laviolette's system. Berube's system is completely different. Hakstol's is going to be different as well.
Flyers,3d4fz1,I_Am_Prisoner,15,Tue Jul 14 20:49:09 2015 UTC,I like how NHL.com references war-on-ice.com for Vinny's remaining year and cap hit...like they don't have that data readily available.
Flyers,3d4fz1,Rustytire,9,Mon Jul 13 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"This is especially amusing given that Bettman doesn't see the value in the NHL publishing their own salary information:   Bettman doesn’t believe that market extends beyond the reporters seeking that information for stories; and that fans care less about what happens in the GM’s office than they are about what happens in the rink.  “I don’t think it’s a resource we need to provide because I’m not sure fans are as focused on what players make as they are about their performance on the ice,” he said.   http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/bettman--nhl-won-t-publish-player-salaries--not-sure-fans-care-220652209.html"
Flyers,3d4fz1,Epoke28,-2,Mon Jul 13 15:03:31 2015 UTC,That's funny because salary and on-ice play are supposed to be one in the same
Flyers,3d4fz1,TheSunOfABeach,4,Mon Jul 13 15:14:26 2015 UTC,"I think contract terms are still taboo subjects, except for certain teams.

Flyers,3d4fz1,Epoke28,9,Mon Jul 13 13:31:12 2015 UTC,"I keep reading these same articles and it drives me crazy. Why are they buggin Vinny about whether he wants to play? Of course he does. He's a hockey player! Do they honestly think he will ever reply by saying ""I'd rather just sit out and get no playing time. I have nothing to offer..""  Now that I said my peace about the media, I do think he will have more opportunity under Hakstol, but I think this year for all players will be based a lot on how they do in training camp."
Flyers,3d4fz1,Epoke28,5,Mon Jul 13 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I feel like college coaches are used to being fluid with their changes.  A ton of things happen in college you shouldn't have to worry about in PRO's (athletes taking time to do schoolwork, university discipline, coaches disciplining). You might think that doesn't happen but I just left a college team and you would be surprised the stupid reasons kids have to sit out."
Flyers,3d4fz1,infidelappel,4,Mon Jul 13 15:18:46 2015 UTC,That's why I think he may have more opportunity to slip into the line up... or more opportunity to slip out

Flyers,3d4fz1,joshtry,2,Mon Jul 13 23:14:02 2015 UTC,Do you think under the new coach Vinny can thrive or do you think he is just not a fit on the team I think he can be a 3 line wing or 2wing and power play specialist if given the right circumstances
Flyers,3d4fz1,PeachesAndSkeet,5,Mon Jul 13 13:42:35 2015 UTC,"I think he can be sheltered with limited minutes on the right wing.  I just don't know where he can fit right now. His back is shot.  He still has some hands, but he clearly doesn't have the speed to play defense on a checking line.  Last season he made everyone he played with worse.  I hope to be proven wrong, but I think at best he's going to muddle through the season on the 4th line rather than thrive."
Flyers,3d4fz1,infidelappel,2,Mon Jul 13 15:12:45 2015 UTC,"""Muddling through the season on the 4th line"" is the best prediction I've seen so far. I can't imagine anything else happening, really"
Flyers,3d4fz1,PhillyT,6,Tue Jul 14 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"I think he maybe will be able to find an effective role under Hakstol, not necessarily thrive. He doesn't have the same legs under him he used to but could put up a decent number of goals used right. That still is a big maybe and I would probably rather just see him moved."
Flyers,3d4fz1,maniacrenz,6,Mon Jul 13 13:57:22 2015 UTC,I hope so.  He has been a great player all his career and I feel badly how he is being handled here.  Sucks to end on a bad note.
Flyers,3d4fz1,PhillyT,4,Mon Jul 13 14:52:37 2015 UTC,Part of how he's been handled is that he simply isn't very good anymore.   Berube was a clown shoes dummy but Vinny has had his chances.

Flyers,3d4lje,MegaGrubby,9,Mon Jul 13 14:48:33 2015 UTC,One goon messing up doesn't mean all goons can't coach.
Flyers,3d4lje,infidelappel,4,Mon Jul 13 15:36:53 2015 UTC,Seriously. Same thing about everyone that bitches about bringing former players back into the organization. Just because they played with the team before doesn't mean they won't be good at the job. Look at Hextall.
Flyers,3d4lje,bananafone7475,5,Mon Jul 13 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"Yup. People who say ""no more former Flyers"" are dumb. Just because they played or worked here and moved on doesn't make them unqualified.  If the Flyers never brought players back, that would mean no Bernie Parent. No Mark Recchi. No Ron Hextall."

Riley Cote/Craig Berube we don't.  edit: To elaborate...you take a player who during their entire career could not figure out how to score goals/gain more minutes of play time. You then ask them to coach others. Players have problems scoring goals/getting better. Coach says, ""Players aren't scoring. Plain and simple. They need to fix that"". The reality is...the coach was never able to figure it out and therefore cannot fix their team."
Flyers,3d4lje,MegaGrubby,11,Mon Jul 13 16:50:19 2015 UTC,Strategy is different from ability. Wayne Gretzky scored a ton of goals but was not a good coach.
Flyers,3d4lje,willdesignforfood,-4,Mon Jul 13 17:08:58 2015 UTC,Successful goon coach?
Flyers,3d4lje,MegaGrubby,6,Mon Jul 13 17:11:59 2015 UTC,You're missing the point. My point is strategy can absolutely be taught. Just because your role in the NHL was more to fight and defend your team doesn't mean you're stupid and can't strategize/motivate. But just saying that scorers are the only ones qualified to become a coach is a dumb argument.
Flyers,3d4lje,willdesignforfood,4,Mon Jul 13 17:26:54 2015 UTC,Exactly. Lavy played like 12 NHL games total. I think of him as a good coach. Not a great coach but a good one.
Flyers,3d4lje,jarpaulson,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:56:51 2015 UTC,"There are guys who haven't played much who are successful...Lavy, Hitch, Keenan. They all had to prove that they could be good coaches. I agree, you don't need to be a scorer.   I'd just like to see 1 example where a goon had success coaching. Cote's bypassing a lot of other coaches who are working hard to prove their abilities.   Sometimes I feel like Flyers GMs are trying to get extremely lucky instead of following traditionally successful methods."
Flyers,3d4lje,MegaGrubby,3,Mon Jul 13 17:57:02 2015 UTC,Dale Hunter worked well in his season with the Caps and he a great coaching career in junior.   Some of the greatest coaches all time were plugs. Bowman. Hitch. Babs. Quenneville was mediocre at best (and had a lot of PIMs.).   Your argument that it takes talent or the knowledge of scoring to coach is stupid. And Cote hasn't been handed anything. He's been assisting for the Phantoms for six years. What shortcut is he being given?
Flyers,3d4lje,infidelappel,-2,Mon Jul 13 18:34:39 2015 UTC,AHL coach is pretty top tier in coaching...
Flyers,3d4lje,MegaGrubby,2,Mon Jul 13 20:25:21 2015 UTC,Laviolette never figured out how to be a good goal scorer in pro. Neither did Babcock. Or Hitchcock. Or Bowman.   The best coaches aren't the best players. Goons aren't goons because they're not smart or don't know hockey. They're just not talented.   And talent has nothing to do with coaching because you can't teach it.
Flyers,3d4lje,infidelappel,2,Mon Jul 13 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Joel Quenneville.    He played 13 seasons in the NHL, 803 games.  He scored 190 points in his career, that is an average of ~20 points per 82 game season.  Now he has 3 rings and is one of the best coaches in the NHL."
Flyers,3d4lje,fly3rs18,2,Mon Jul 13 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"Goons are usually pretty good coaches actually.

Flyers,3d1daz,TeamRick,12,Sun Jul 12 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"I'm with you man. I'm feeling pretty good about next year at this point. Of course, some more moves could still be made. It only gets better from here. I can't wait for the season to start to see how everything plays out."
Flyers,3d1daz,ii386,2,Sun Jul 12 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"Although last season did not go according to plan, there is never a dull season with our flyers!"
Flyers,3d1daz,j42justin,4,Sun Jul 12 22:26:58 2015 UTC,There are going to be growing pains for all the young Dmen.  I'd also expect the same for Medvedev.  None of these videos show him playing defense.
Flyers,3d1daz,GirouxIs4TheChildren,3,Sun Jul 12 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"I'm usually with you on a lot of things but to be fair there isn't too many videos of players on d in general. Especially from the khl. He might be ok, personal ally idk"
Flyers,3d1daz,j42justin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just wondering why the dman is always ahead of the rest of the team."
Flyers,3d1daz,j42justin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:52:49 2015 UTC,Haha yeah that is true but that could definitely help the flyers move forward in a more speed oriented game. Grossmann was a pylon at time and with a quick puck moving defenseman could help tremendously in the transitional game
Flyers,3d1daz,GirouxIs4TheChildren,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:00:03 2015 UTC,"Speed will help, but I'm interested to see how Medvedev looks in the smaller rink."

Flyers,3d1daz,colink28,2,Sun Jul 12 23:32:17 2015 UTC,I just pray Matt Read can go back to his 20 goal scoring days cause his 6 goals last year really hurt us.
Flyers,3d1daz,colink28,2,Sun Jul 12 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"20 would be gravy, but honestly with picking up Gagner we'll really only need 10-15 from him this year. His shooting percentage certainly needs to improve this year"
Flyers,3d1daz,infidelappel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:56:11 2015 UTC,hoping we can revitalize his career as was del zotto's
Flyers,3d1daz,colink28,2,Sun Jul 12 23:58:34 2015 UTC,"If all that goes perfect, then yeah, we could probably make some noise in the playoffs. But you'd need Laughton to step up in his first full season, Simmonds to not regress at all, Read to bounce back big, Couturier and Schenn to take that big step we've all been waiting for, and Gagner to impress.  That's a lot of pieces that need to click."
Flyers,3d1daz,greedyiguana,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:57:29 2015 UTC,With the right personnel it is definitely achievable. Hextall has really turned this organization around right before it was headed towards an iceberg. I love how he has a strict condition plan in the off season for players
Flyers,3d1daz,RiflemanLax,2,Sun Jul 12 20:05:28 2015 UTC,"Not one word yet in the thread about Mason, who is the most under rated player on the team. Hands down if we are going to be even a bubble team, Mason will need to be healthy, and he will need to play at a consistent level of play all year. Yes it would be great for B. Schenn to take some strides as well as Couturier (who is already an great 2 way guy). But overall we need Mason to be THE guy. Expect big season from G, Jake and Simmer."
Flyers,3d1daz,LGF6704,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I mean, when the flyers go on hot streaks and pick up momentum they are a scary team to play. Proved last year with our record against playoff teams. We just have to beat the weaker teams and string wins together. The consistency and poor starts is what this team has always lacked. I love the coaching direction we went and I believe it will pay dividends."
Flyers,3d1daz,flyersfan114,2,Sun Jul 12 22:05:12 2015 UTC,"In all honesty I do believe in Mason, if he is healthy we really have a legitimate chance."
Flyers,3d1daz,LGF6704,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:50:30 2015 UTC,"How is he at all underrated?   Mason gets fellated all day every day around here. Not saying he doesn't deserve to be, but he sure isn't underrated."
Flyers,3d1daz,LGF6704,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:45:22 2015 UTC,"Underrated was not the best word I agree, but from a non bias point on view and by the numbers you would be crazy not to see him at in the top 7-10 goalies in the league right now. And the city if philly has not had that in a WHILE"
Flyers,3d1daz,LGF6704,2,Mon Jul 13 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"honestly, our big problem last year was playing shit versus shit teams.  if we can fix that, then I don't see why we couldn't make the playoffs, let alone make a decent dent"

Flyers,3d0b67,descend27,2,Sun Jul 12 15:31:00 2015 UTC,I never understood the idea of a second team. Like what do you mean?! I bleed orange and black. If I happen to be watching a game and the Flyers aren't in it I just cheer for some good hockey and never for another team's success.

Flyers,3d0b67,flyersunion28,6,Sun Jul 12 14:45:40 2015 UTC,Nashville.  They've come so far on such a small budget plus they work their tails off.

Flyers,3d0b67,ZebZ,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:59:04 2015 UTC,"I know we went to Jacks a couple times, the big place on the strip. Then there was some joint right near the Grand Ole Opry that was really good, it was on that diners, dumps, and dives show or whatever.  BUT! If anyone ever goes to Nashville, TN, you have to go to Hattie B's Hot Chicken. It's probably the best chicken I've ever had and once drove 200 miles out of my way just to eat there."

Flyers,3d0b67,KimmoTargaryen,4,Sun Jul 12 16:45:28 2015 UTC,"I like Carolina as well. Moved to NC in 2009. Didn't go to a Canes game until earlier this year, but they blew me away with the fan experience. Cheap tickets, everyone that I talked to,  Canes fan or ushers or whatever, was friendly and helpful. I sat Mar where the canes earned up and so many times the Canes players threw pucks or sticks over the glass to little kids in Canes gear. Awesome experience.

This logic was: ""I was born in Reston, VA, so I should follow the home team"". I then Realised I loved philly more, and considering how all of my maternal family are from PA/Clayton NJ, they're flyers fans, so they looked the better team (bloods thicker than water).

Flyers,3d0b67,michaelmanfredi,2,Sun Jul 12 18:41:28 2015 UTC,"I like the Bruins simply because they have a franchise culture similar to ours.

Flyers,3d0lno,infidelappel,6,Sun Jul 12 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, noticed that. Plus the fact that he's trying to convince people that just because Provorov was signed a couple weeks after the draft that he's somehow a lock for the roster this season."
Flyers,3d0lno,infidelappel,3,Sun Jul 12 16:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's all goofy.    And I mean, he's not entirely wrong - Goulbourne's 45 points in junior are certainly better than Rinaldo topping out at 30, but as an overage player with skilled line mates that still doesn't mean much in a league where any real scoring talent is probably gonna get at least double that.   So sure, he will probably be more useful than Rinaldo at actual hockey, but not by very much at all. Not by enough to be excited about it, at least."

Flyers,3d0lno,SkidmarkInMyUndies,7,Tue Jul 14 06:05:45 2015 UTC,"I don't read Panaccio often but fuck is this article dumb. Apart from the basic factual errors that could be cleared up with a simple Google search (like Rinaldo wearing 0 thing and Goulbourne and Leier played on the same World Junior team which they didn't). He was right about Goulbourne playing on the top line in Kelowna (at least until Draisaitl showed up) but using that to come to the conclusion that he has a big offensive upside is pretty ridiculous. Usually when you see an overager who averages less than .75 points per game while playing on the first line and power play of one of the best teams in the entire CHL you don't think ""Offense!"".  Goulbourne biggest attribute is his defense. He's got good speed and a good work ethic to go along with hockey smarts. He worked to round out his game after being drafted and while he can still fight he isn't simply a goon. One big difference between him in Rinaldo, last season Goulbourne only had 18 minor penalties. In Rinaldo's last season in junior he had over 80 minor penalties."

Schenn being our 2c might work, but you start to limit coots to 3rd line time like we did last season would be detrimental to his offensive development.  Especially since we know he won't userp anyone on the 1st power play.

Flyers,3cq0c4,Halfonion,2,Fri Jul 10 15:16:05 2015 UTC,He's had superstar caliber years for the past couple years.
Flyers,3cq0c4,infidelappel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"He did have a good strike shortend year in 2012 but id hardly call any year except for last a ""superstar year"". Im not against locking him up long term with big money this offseason but i dont think its out of the relam of possibilties that he fails to replicate the season like he just had."
Flyers,3cq0c4,Halfonion,3,Fri Jul 10 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"It's always possible. Giroux's production dropped from his 90 point season, too.   But Jake was great in the last three seasons and over that time has one of the highest points per game ratios among all wingers in the entire league."

Flyers,3cpgqw,IAmASkientist,2,Thu Jul 9 20:45:34 2015 UTC,Coots is a better center I don't understand what they mean by rushing.
Flyers,3cpgqw,creto15,2,Fri Jul 10 11:46:18 2015 UTC,"I've read some stuff where given the choice between moving Coots or Laughton to LW/RW, a lot of people think Coots should get kicked to winger. Not sure I agree, we'll see. Interesting to see how the Hakstol lineup starts the season."
Flyers,3cpgqw,feelingnodefeat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:32:04 2015 UTC,Definitely don't agree since his entire viable skill set is based on his defensive abilities at center. He's also great at faceoffs
Flyers,3cpgqw,dejatoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:57:14 2015 UTC,"Coots is a really solid center. I'd keep him there. Personally I really hope Vinny remembers his future hall of fame ways and starts playing really well under hakstol, but I seriously doubt that will happen. If it did tho you could have him center the 3rd line and maybe move coots up to center the 2nd line and move schenn to the wing. Schenn, coots, Simmonds as the 2nd line would be pretty cool. Have read, vinny, Gagner on the 3rd. That all depends on vinny not being completely worthless..."

Flyers,3cq5qy,Epoke28,2,Thu Jul 9 21:53:25 2015 UTC,"Not entirely related to the article, but the bit about him not being an over analyzer got me thinking.  Anyone know how much him and his staff were using advanced analytical statistics at UND?  Or if he is in general a guy that takes stock in those, or is he more old school?"
Flyers,3cq5qy,DrunkMoses,2,Fri Jul 10 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"Here is a nice article with a little info about him. I'm not really sure on his coaching style, but I'm excited. I think Hextall likes him for the way he successfully develops young players since the Flyers are now on a 'mini rebuild' in a way"
Flyers,3cq5qy,Juge88,3,Fri Jul 10 14:16:16 2015 UTC,He could pick it up. He had 20 goals season before last and he pretty much took all of last year off. Hopefully his back is healed and he comes out like he has something to prove.
Flyers,3cq5qy,Juge88,4,Thu Jul 9 22:12:00 2015 UTC,"True. The biggest issues with Vinny are the giant contract and the fact that he just really doesn't fit into the Flyers lineup very well at all. I do agree though, he can produce if given the chance"
Flyers,3cq5qy,Leehblanc,6,Thu Jul 9 22:22:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I still don't think he'll live up to the contract but doesn't Hakstol play a system similar to Lavy?
Flyers,3cq5qy,thr4sher,3,Thu Jul 9 22:24:28 2015 UTC,"Hakstol likes to play fast, but from what I know he adapts his style to the strengths of his players in NCAA. NHL doesn't change out so often, so I would imagine he would be looking to run a system similar to Tampa/NY/Washington. Quicker, physical hockey. Exactly what the Flyers need. The biggest issue, I think, is whether Vinny can play a fast paced game anymore. Wasn't that what he got 'benched' for?"
Flyers,3cp9sm,Chriscftb97,11,Thu Jul 9 17:56:34 2015 UTC,What a great pickup by Hexy. Our overseas scouting has been really good for as long as I can remember.

Flyers,3cp9sm,drunken_gramps,9,Thu Jul 9 18:16:11 2015 UTC,"I really like Belle.  Last year he single-handedly killed 30 seconds of a powerplay by battling along the boards.  The dude is a work horse, has great hockey sense and is pretty damn good.  Sucks he was always in a line with Rino, but I think he is a big reason why the 4th line was actually getting good chances at the end of last year.  He isn't the sniper, but he has great passing and I think will really help someone like Ganger or Coots in front of the net by feeding the puck."
Flyers,3cp9sm,scootypuffjr33,3,Thu Jul 9 18:03:49 2015 UTC,"He'll never play on lines with Gagner or Coots though, he's strictly a 4th liner. He does what he's supposed to very well though as a 4th liner."
Flyers,3cp9sm,fly3rs18,3,Thu Jul 9 19:09:19 2015 UTC,"He can be more than a 4th liner.  If we need to shuffle the lineups then he should absolutely get a shot.  He could be a very good defensive presence on a like with someone like Gagner or Schenn.  He has the speed and intelligence, as long as he can pass well and not turn it over then he could definitely play in a 3rd line role."
Flyers,3cp9sm,drunken_gramps,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:27:03 2015 UTC,He got 3rd line time last year right?
Flyers,3cp9sm,wafflecopter05,4,Thu Jul 9 20:42:27 2015 UTC,"Pebbles is such a fuckin workhorse. Not the most talented guy, but he's got drive. I always think back to that PK last year when he singlehandedly kept the puck in our offensive for like 20 seconds."

Also, never button the bottom button on a suit jacket/blazer, and always match the color of your belt with the color of your shoes. Another thing a lot of people don't know: You know the ""extra"" button that exists on the cuff of dress shirts? The one that it it seems like is there in case you have massive wrists? It's not there to adjust for your arm size, it's actually there to give you space in case you're wearing a watch.

Flyers,3ckjj8,Thursdeh,9,Wed Jul 8 17:14:10 2015 UTC,That's the scariest part. He could easily add another 40-50 pounds onto his frame.
Flyers,3ckjj8,lion27,6,Wed Jul 8 17:15:12 2015 UTC,I'll bet that he tops out around 250 lbs.
Flyers,3ckjj8,_Slate,7,Wed Jul 8 18:07:08 2015 UTC,geez youre right. chara is 2 inches taller and 255 pounds. i guess they just look lanky because theyre tall but geez they weight 50 pounds more than an average player?  morin is at 225 right now. absolute beast but could put on even more weight. guy is just going to be able to push players around
Flyers,3ckjj8,FlyersAndMusic,2,Wed Jul 8 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"I don't want him getting up to 255, I'd rather he stay more around 230.   Speed and quickness is much more important in the NHL today.   His reach combined with above average skating has the potential to be really tough to beat."
Flyers,3ckjj8,fly3rs18,6,Wed Jul 8 19:45:50 2015 UTC,"230 on that frame is about what you're looking at here. He weighs 225 right now. He's skinny still, and bumping his weight up another 30 pounds will help him with his strength and injury prevention.  Put a little meat on those bones."

Flyers,3ckw4y,Chriscftb97,5,Wed Jul 8 18:29:36 2015 UTC,In his one game he played only 9:25. His Corsi For in that time was 12. He was paired mostly with Oliver Lauridsen and played a little more than half those minutes skating behind Zac Rinaldo.  No one is saying he's going to be a stud but if he could turn into a Martin Marincin type guy for our 3rd pairing in the future that would be great. I would like to see him as a 6th/7th type guy this season and let him earn playing time the same way Brandon Manning did at the end of last season. But that would mean having to move 2 defenseman from the already crowded blue line.
Flyers,3ckw4y,hawks27,3,Wed Jul 8 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"I do love Alt, but I think that he's very expendable. Especially if Vasiliev ever comes to NA."
Flyers,3ckw4y,hawks27,3,Wed Jul 8 19:30:24 2015 UTC,One thing that Alt has that makes him less expendable is the fact he's right handed. The only other big RH defenseman in the organization are Freidman and Willcox and they're both further away from the NHL than Alt.  I've been a big proponent of Vasiliev for a while but I still don't think he can skate or handle puck as well as Alt. Vasiliev isn't deficient in those areas but just not as good. Hopefully he has a good year playing a full season with Novgorod.
Flyers,3ckw4y,fly3rs18,5,Wed Jul 8 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"He is very overlooked with our other D prospects.  He still has solid NHL potential, likely a very good 3rd pair or maybe up to the 2nd.   I'd rather see him in the NHL this year than Manning as a midseason call up"
Flyers,3ckw4y,Thursdeh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:49:28 2015 UTC,"I expect around trade deadline we move Luke, and at that time the one to come up in my eyes is going to be Ghost, if not it should be Alt."
Flyers,3ckw4y,PhillyT,2,Wed Jul 8 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"He went to the same high school as Ryan McDonagh,  and played quarterback on the high school football team with Seantrel Henderson at left tackle.   Henderson was the number one high-school prospect when he was recruited to play for Miami.   In the 2014 draft the eagles traded picks with the bills to select Beau Allen in the 7th round, Beau played nose tackle in the same league as Mark Alt and Seantrel.   In the same round the bills used the eagles pick to select Seantrel Henderson who became their starting right tackle."

You guys did a fantastic job not sounding awkward (like many podcasts usually do) and being very casual yet professional in your conversations. Added plus for knowing what you're talking about.  Definitely looking forward to hearing more.

We thought this was a good way to reach out to other fans and hopefully produce something enjoyable.  Again, any feedback or questions/comments are welcome.

Flyers,3chljs,Flipadelphia26,4,Wed Jul 8 10:45:01 2015 UTC,8x8 is my guess. 7.5 minimum after seeing what ROR and Tarasenko got. Considering G got 8x8.56 or whatever it doesn't seem all that off either.
Flyers,3chljs,infidelappel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:32:09 2015 UTC,I think Jake gets more than Giroux based on cap inflation. I think Jake gets 8/$9M.

Flyers,3cgwwi,lion27,12,Tue Jul 7 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"I think Mason realizes that but some reporter probably asked if he feels his job is threatened by Neuvirth. Honestly though I appreciate what Emery did but he just didnt have the side to side speed anymore, and Zepp while pulled a decent streak is just a decent AHL goalie. It will be nice to have a reliable backup in Neuvirth as you said."
Flyers,3cgwwi,DairyDude999,16,Tue Jul 7 20:58:19 2015 UTC,the side to side speed anymore   That Rangers series where Mason was injured and Emery was in is giving me war flashbacks
Flyers,3cgwwi,BuiltFjordTough,13,Tue Jul 7 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yep. I still say we win that series with a healthy Mason the entire time. They exploited the shit out his side to side movement in every game he played, and Mason outplayed Lundqvist in every game he played.  We wouldn't have gotten far that year anyway, but still.

I love that he wants to play 60-65 games, awesome. But we all know he doesn't tend to stay healthy for that many games to start in so it makes sense to have a backup that can take the reigns and play at a high level. Second, I don't think Mase means what he says in a spiteful way, although it comes off that way in a 140 character tweet. I'm sure he loves the signing because it takes a bit of pressure off of him, while retaining the knowledge that he is the undisputed number one in Philadelphia."
Flyers,3cgwwi,Banana_blanket,10,Wed Jul 8 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"Probably responding to some stupid-ass question from a reporter.  Mase has the starting job locked down, it'll just be nice to have a backup that is solid enough to win more than half his starts and post a SV% over 90%.  Ray was 19-23 with a 89.5 sv% and a 3.016 GAA.  Subpar.  Neuvirth was 11-28 (22 losses on the Sabres, who were garbage) with a 91.6 sv%, and a 2.914 GAA."
Flyers,3cgwwi,fadetoblack1004,2,Tue Jul 7 22:23:59 2015 UTC,He was talking to Missanelli on 97.5 earlier today and talked about it. Not a bad interview actually but this guy just cherry picked a line without any context.
Flyers,3cgwwi,I_like_terddles,3,Wed Jul 8 01:53:50 2015 UTC,Mase should take like 50-55. Less strain on him. I want him solid if we happen to make a playoff spot. He was mostly a stud vs the rangers
Flyers,3cgwwi,pooptits1,2,Wed Jul 8 01:38:48 2015 UTC,Neuvirth if i remember was a starter over holtby briefly? Was great in spurts but never did well with a giant workload? I think thats what i rmember from his caps years.
Flyers,3cgwwi,xTuna74x,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"He was the starter over Holtby for a while but I wouldn't look too much into that. The Caps have been great at developing goalies (Neuvrith, Varly, Holtby, Grubauer have all been the product of the Caps) but for a while they would just go on great runs but not be able to hold down the starting job in the long run (Holtby included)."
Flyers,3cgwwi,About900babies,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:19:52 2015 UTC,Yeah i'm not looking into it i'm just trying to remember if that was him or Grubauer. I've seen a ton of Hershey goalies so it gets confusing sometimes. All i was trying to say is coming in for a 10 game stretch Neuv can do well.

Flyers,3cgbg7,ateURdog,3,Tue Jul 7 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"I would be overjoyed with the same contract as Tarasenko, I think that's totally reasonable for what Jake brings. Voracek hitting his prime right now-ish makes that contract a really fair deal"
Flyers,3cgbg7,joshtry,3,Tue Jul 7 18:58:38 2015 UTC,Honestly wouldn't be surprised if he gets 8.5. He's elite and with cap inflation wouldn't be surprising to see him get more than G
Flyers,3cgbg7,dejatoo,3,Tue Jul 7 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If I had to guess I would put him anywhere from 7.5-8.5 for 8 years. 7.5-8 if he's being team friendly, over 8 if he guns for market value hard. Realistically I'm hoping 8x8."
Flyers,3cgbg7,infidelappel,6,Tue Jul 7 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's what Voracek is worth. Around 7.5 maybe even 8, not sure on the 8 year part, I'd lock him for as long as Giroux's contract is up. I'd propose 8M*6."
Flyers,3cgbg7,TheSunOfABeach,3,Tue Jul 7 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"No way Jake goes for 6 unless the money goes up to 8.5. He's going to seek max years, and I don't blame him. He's out-produced both ROR and Tarasenko, so why would he accept a shorter deal than either?"
Flyers,3cgbg7,infidelappel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:15:33 2015 UTC,"I'd pay 8.5 for 6 years, throw a ntc/nmc in it. But more than 6 years is too much imo."

Flyers,3cgbg7,chvd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:01:47 2015 UTC,In 8 years he'll be 32 so it's unlikely he will steeply decline.   If we can lock  up a mac until he's 33 than we should be able to do the same for our best winger
Flyers,3cgbg7,PhillyT,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:36:20 2015 UTC,"ROR's deal is a bad comparison, his base salary each year is $1 mil and everything else is performance-based. The $7.5 mil cap hit only means something to the GM, not the player."
Flyers,3cgbg7,OccamsRaiser,3,Tue Jul 7 22:22:25 2015 UTC,"It's not performance-based, it's signing bonuses. He gets that money."
Flyers,3cgbg7,infidelappel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:12:56 2015 UTC,My mistake. What's the reasoning for structuring the contract like this?
Flyers,3cgbg7,OccamsRaiser,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:26:04 2015 UTC,Having the majority of his salary in signing bonuses instead of salary lets him avoid losing the bulk of it to escrow.  It also makes him harder to buy out.
Flyers,3cgbg7,infidelappel,0,Wed Jul 8 00:14:20 2015 UTC,48?
Flyers,3cgbg7,MelGibsonDerp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:11:38 2015 UTC,"if you are talking about 8M*6 meaning 48, that is shorthand for a 6 year contract for 8M average annual value"
Flyers,3cgbg7,andrewc1117,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah that cap hit would be good.  An 8 year contract means we'd be paying him like a key player until he's 33.  Jake is amazing but I personally hope that we are no longer relying on him to be a key player for us by the time he's 33.  Id probably be happiest with a 6 year deal.  Then at age 31 he'd either move on to another team for big money and term to be a key player there for a couple years before becoming a bad contract, or possibly take a smaller term and/or cap hit to remain a core player for this team for a few more years.  Or maybe he'll still be tearing it up at age 33, who the hell knows.  Either way I'd be happiest with a 6 year deal at 7-7.5mil."
Flyers,3cgbg7,Jakeusson,2,Tue Jul 7 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"No way in hell does he agree to fewer years and less money than ROR and Tarasenko, both of whom he has outscored by a decent margin.  Jake is going to get 8 years. There's no reason whatsoever he should accept less - unless you want to crank the money up to $8.5m per.  With ROR and Tarasenko - both lesser players, production-wise - getting $7.5m x 7/8, Jake is going to get at the very least 8x$7.5m. Probably closer to $8m, unless he's being incredibly team friendly in negotiations. But either way he's going for 8 years."
Flyers,3cgbg7,infidelappel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:15:10 2015 UTC,"I would not be. I love Jake, but we can't assume he'll consistently put up the numbers he did this year. His pace was almost unreal at times. We can't rule out the likely possibility that he won't do it again. I want to see one more similar year before giving him the big bucks."
Flyers,3cgbg7,Bond31,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:08 2015 UTC,"If you put Jake on the open market next year, I think he quite easily commands a $9M+ AAV. I'd be ecstatic if we signed him to $7.5, but I don't think it's realistic."
Flyers,3cgbg7,mistergrime,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:17:12 2015 UTC,"I'd expect something very similar, possibly a little more. He's put in time."
Flyers,3cgbg7,bestbiff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:24:35 2015 UTC,Tarasenko is getting that money because he is NOW St. Louis's franchise player. I wouldn't be surprised if Jake doesn't get something similar. It's definitely a risk since he has only had really 1 big year. Big contracts are the reason the Flyers are crippled currently so there is probably going to be hesitation in the risk that it could be history repeating itself. Let's also look at the fact that he has been playing with Giroux who isn't by any means going to hurt his scoring chances.
Flyers,3cgbg7,Epoke28,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"I love jake but big contracts scare me, especially based on production in a contract year. I wouldn't want it to be longer than 4 years if we're paying him 8 mill. I could go longer of its closer to 6.5. Dude had a great scoring season and has looked good for a while, but nothing cripples a team more than a bad contract, and he hasn't proven to be a top 10 scorer in the league long term."

Flyers,3cc8xu,HI_Handbasket,3,Mon Jul 6 20:29:30 2015 UTC,ties don't if I remember right. In football if you go 8-7-1 your winning % is the same as if you went 8-7.   Now OTLs are where it gets weird.   Edit: maybe do the percentage of points we got verse a team verse what was available.
Flyers,3cc8xu,HI_Handbasket,2,Mon Jul 6 21:09:53 2015 UTC,To figure out that percentage you'd also have to figure out how many wins were OT wins in a 3 point game vs a 2pt game win.  Yet another reason that having games worth different points values is dumb.
Flyers,3cc8xu,Snatchateer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"I started comparing total points available to each team, but we need to know how many overtime losses each opponent had against the Flyers."
Flyers,3cc8xu,intensebeet,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"Ties count as half a win.  A team can't finish 8-7, so that comparison doesn't work.  An 8-7 team has a 0.533 winning percentage (repeating, of course, Mr. Jenkins) while a 8-7-1 team has a 0.531 w.p. (0.53125 exactly.)"
Flyers,3cc8xu,Snatchateer,7,Tue Jul 7 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"So Bruins, Devils, Canadiens, and Avalanche are the only teams to have a winning record against us"
Flyers,3cc8xu,Derk444,3,Mon Jul 6 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"Ducks, Sharks, CBJ and Rangers have winning records against the Flyers too once you add in OT losses."
Flyers,3cc8xu,Blinsin,4,Mon Jul 6 21:57:15 2015 UTC,Well that was silly of me to exclude
Flyers,3cc8xu,fly3rs18,5,Tue Jul 7 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"HA! Suck it, Pittsburgh!"
Flyers,3cc8xu,Prsck,3,Mon Jul 6 21:10:35 2015 UTC,We have the second highest winning percentage in the history of the league. Only behind the habs.
Flyers,3cc8xu,intensebeet,7,Mon Jul 6 21:56:07 2015 UTC,30-8-3-3 against the Thrashers.  I miss having Nitty playing against them.  In his career he was 17-0 with a 1.76 GAA and .940 save % against Atlanta.
Flyers,3cc8xu,h0phead,5,Tue Jul 7 00:57:27 2015 UTC,Pesky Rangers
Flyers,3cc8xu,BobtheDestructor,3,Tue Jul 7 02:39:16 2015 UTC,The encouraging thing here is we're only below a 50% win rate against 8 teams. Thanks for gathering all the data!
Flyers,3cc8xu,desj16,3,Mon Jul 6 20:41:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is a dumb question, but where did you pull this info from? I'm curious if this could be automated somehow..."
Flyers,3cc8xu,HI_Handbasket,3,Tue Jul 7 01:52:27 2015 UTC,It all come from this website
Flyers,3cc8xu,luckytaurus,3,Tue Jul 7 03:12:55 2015 UTC,Why not more cups?
Flyers,3cc8xu,Shotgun_Sentinel,2,Tue Jul 7 05:06:11 2015 UTC,Are the Capitals missing from this?
Flyers,3cc8xu,JOG_FORREST_JOG,3,Mon Jul 6 22:19:33 2015 UTC,"So somehow I totally missed them... Thanks for pointing it out, it's fixed now."
Flyers,3cc8xu,AlonsoFerrari8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:32:42 2015 UTC,A co-worker and I have a running lunch bet.  He's bought me a lot of lunches over the years.
Flyers,3cceth,r35h93,14,Mon Jul 6 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly I see this season pretty similar to last year , we're a better team. However the Caps, CBJ, Pens all got better. I see out division like so:    Metro    Capitals #1   Rangers #2   Penguins  #3   Blue Jackets #4   Flyers   Devils   Hurricanes        Atlantic    Tampa Bay #1   Montreal #2   Detriot #3   Florida #5   Boston   Ottawa   Buffalo   Toronto      Best case we're a wild card team. Which Us, CBJ, Panthers, Boston, Ottawa and Pittsburgh will most likely be the teams fighting for those 2 spots. It'll be interesting for sure, especially since we have so many question marks about our team this year."
Flyers,3cceth,Thursdeh,15,Mon Jul 6 20:46:16 2015 UTC,It all comes down to coaching. If Berube was as useless as we all believe and Hakstol really is that much better then in my eyes our team will be noticeably better this year.
Flyers,3cceth,Rustytire,6,Mon Jul 6 20:51:23 2015 UTC,"While Hakstol is an improvement, I don't think coaching can magically give us top paring defense (very low chance Prov. makes the team) and a topline leftwing.  My expectation is we'll finish roughly where we did last year--and that's ok.  We're clearly building toward the future (FINALLY) and while it's a few years off that's ok as long as we keep building towards the future."
Flyers,3cceth,fly3rs18,3,Mon Jul 6 22:54:22 2015 UTC,"I am looking forward to Hakstol and I think he will do well, but he is going to hit some growing pains early along the way.  It is a big transition to make."
Flyers,3cceth,Heatinmyharbl,2,Tue Jul 7 01:01:11 2015 UTC,"I see us struggling for the first third or half of the season. I see them making a really strong push during the second half of the season though - Giroux 2014 style.   That and Hakstol's teams always turn it on during the second half of the season. I think if Mase and Voracek's play don't drop off at all and/or improve, we squeeze in with a wild card slot this year. I've said this before though and I'll say it again: there is no way we win unless Mase goes SSJ3 for the entire playoffs, but we can make it."
Flyers,3cceth,viidenmetrinmolo,3,Tue Jul 7 06:57:16 2015 UTC,I could see Coots having a really big season now that he's probably going to get something else than defensive zone starts against the oppositions top line.
Flyers,3cceth,Chriscftb97,8,Tue Jul 7 11:09:15 2015 UTC,"Pssst, you forgot the Islanders"
Flyers,3cceth,fly3rs18,4,Mon Jul 6 21:07:55 2015 UTC,who?
Flyers,3cceth,MegaGrubby,3,Mon Jul 6 21:26:49 2015 UTC,Dammit. Well everyone forgets the Islanders so its all good. Well up until last year...
Flyers,3cceth,fateislosthope,2,Mon Jul 6 21:56:06 2015 UTC,It was pretty hard to forget about them in the early 80s too...
Flyers,3cceth,bestbiff,3,Tue Jul 7 14:58:35 2015 UTC,"Brandon Saad is an excellent young player who will be a star. And CBJ had a ton of injuries including BOB that decimated their season. But...fuck it ill say it. The team is also full of overachieving players that I dont think will ever hit their previous potential including Dubinski, Foglino, Clarkson, Hartnell. They are all overpaid coming off their breakout season and are all basically the same ""hard working grinding player"". They have Johansen and Saad who have real offensive talent but besides that they are kind of like the typical past flyers roster. Loaded full of hardworking 3rd line guys that just dont have the offensive talent to take it anywhere far.   Maybe I am way off but having 4 players that are all basically the same making AVG 5 million for the foreseeable future of 4-5 years is going to bite them in the ass one day. They have all peaked at the right time and got overpaid contracts."
Flyers,3cceth,fateislosthope,2,Mon Jul 6 23:13:45 2015 UTC,How those guys coming off career seasons follow up will make or break them. Foligno averaged under 40 points for seven seasons and then last year he's around a ppg...
Flyers,3cceth,PhillyT,3,Mon Jul 6 23:48:09 2015 UTC,I think we already saw Clarkson fall to earth.  Dubinski is 30 years old and his season career  high is 34 points and he's carrying a cap hit over 5 mill.   I guess Hartnell and Foligno have the best shot at maintaining but honestly Hartnell is the best player out of all of them and he's the lowest cap hit.
Flyers,3cceth,bestbiff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:23:35 2015 UTC,"To top it off,  besides dubinsky and filing they are pretty 1 dimensional players who can't be trusted in their own zone.   If one of the kids gets injured it might be hard for them to carry the team"
Flyers,3cceth,PhillyT,2,Tue Jul 7 17:18:34 2015 UTC,"Rangers didn't get better and everyone else mostly did. I see them slipping. Caps, islanders, penguins, rangers, jackets, flyers, devs, canes."
Flyers,3cceth,PhillyT,2,Mon Jul 6 23:44:39 2015 UTC,"I see something like this 1-caps, 2 pens, 3-rags, wc1-isles 1-habs, 2-lightning, 3-detroit, wc2-flyers!"
Flyers,3cceth,FranktheShank1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:32:15 2015 UTC,Detroit is one or two injured players away from missing the playoffs.   And I don't think Boston is a serious threat anymore.   They have traded away core pieces and replaced them with plugs.  They don't have a deep enough prospect pool to replenish what they lost.
Flyers,3cceth,OrangeAndBlack,5,Tue Jul 7 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"keep in mind OT is 3 on 3 now.  We win a lot of matchups in OT.  also, we sucked in the 3rd period all season.  Maybe Hacksaw can figure that out sooner rather than later"
Flyers,3cceth,fateislosthope,2,Mon Jul 6 23:52:29 2015 UTC,The change to OT will realistically only add about 3-5 points at most.
Flyers,3cceth,_Slate,2,Tue Jul 7 11:15:02 2015 UTC,Probably what we're we 3-9 last year you figure if we can split half of those were a 6 pt gain. But I think the combo of G-Jake-steit/mdz will be worth it just in entertainment value alone.
Flyers,3cceth,infidelappel,2,Tue Jul 7 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"Raffl - Giroux - Voracek  Read - Coots - Schenn  Gagner - Laughton - Simmonds  White - Bellemare - VandeVelde  Lecavalier  ...  Del Zotto - Medvedev  Schultz - Streit  Provorov - MacD/Gudas  ...  Mason  Neuvirth  I'm assuming that one more defender will be moved, most likely Schenn, while Provorov cracks the lineup. There are lots of possible changes that can be made to the lines, especially with a new coach, but I'd imagine they'll lineup somewhere close to this. The real issue they have is that they are loaded to the teeth on RW so we may see some shuffling around of Simmonds/Gagner/Read while Schenn stays put.   It's hard to imagine that this team isn't at least on the bubble. It may be preferable, even though it will be painful, to be sellers at the deadline and move Streit."
Flyers,3cceth,_Slate,6,Tue Jul 7 00:14:57 2015 UTC,"I really don't see Provorov making it. He's going to have to SEVERELY beat on every other D man in camp to prove he should stay. With Hexy's overall philosophy, the log jam of bodies, and the senselessness of spending an ELC year on an iffy team, the delta between him and everyone else would have to be enormous. Which isn't to say I don't think he's better than at least a few guys currently on this roster, just that to get more than 9 games he's gonna have to be dominant. I don't see Hexy keeping him up unless he proves to be a clear cut top 4. No sense having him play third pair on this team when he could go play huge minutes in junior."
Flyers,3cceth,infidelappel,0,Tue Jul 7 03:52:01 2015 UTC,"One of the d-men has to come up this year at the very least, unless you want to deal with multiple rookies on the blueline in one large swath.   If not Provorov, then Ghost at the very least."
Flyers,3cceth,fateislosthope,5,Tue Jul 7 04:04:40 2015 UTC,After missing a whole year? Not likely.   I'll wait and deal with having rookies. Not having more than one rookie at a time is a silly reason to rush anyone.
Flyers,3cceth,_Slate,3,Tue Jul 7 04:06:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't bet on Ghost after the injury. Outside chance Provorov makes it, if he doesn't no one does."
Flyers,3cceth,fateislosthope,2,Tue Jul 7 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"Probably not at the start of the season, but I'll bet he'll see some significant time with the team in the latter half."
Flyers,3cceth,PhillyT,2,Tue Jul 7 14:56:41 2015 UTC,I hope so but I think hexy is playing it safe I got to go see him play last year and it's hard not to get lost just watching him skate around even without the puck.
Flyers,3cceth,MegaGrubby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:31:39 2015 UTC,"You could throw sanheims name into the ring because there is a chance that hexy feels like he doesn't belong in juniors anymore,  but I don't think that  is best for his development.  The rest of the 5 horsemen have shown in the past year that they should have some time in the lower leaves before they can be given big minutes in the NHL.  It's not even entirely an issue of development as much as not knowing exactly where they are."
Flyers,3cceth,_Slate,5,Tue Jul 7 17:22:42 2015 UTC,No way Read is 2nd liner (if he plays like last year). He may be riding the pine.
Flyers,3cceth,MegaGrubby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to give Read the past year as a one-off, with a short leash, as he had averaged about 0.29 GPG over 189 games prior to this season.   As I mentioned, the biggest issue with the team is an the of primary RW. Even though Gagner mentioned that he has played both sides, IIRC he was most effective and is more comfortable on the right.  I'm honestly not really sure how well Simmonds plays on the left side. If someone can comment on that it would be appreciated."
Flyers,3cceth,PhillyT,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:15:33 2015 UTC,I think Read credited his drop in performance to his new child and health problems (ankle?). I'm not sure that either was as big as his drop in performance.
Flyers,3cceth,willdesignforfood,2,Tue Jul 7 16:37:54 2015 UTC,"High ankle sprain,  and I believe it was the reason.   He was basically 10 goals short of replicating his previous few seasons,  and scoring was extremely low in the league as a whole last year.   That being said,  I don't want him on the second line either if he tops out at 40 ish points."
Flyers,3cceth,fateislosthope,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:25:10 2015 UTC,The last 5 games of the season you could see a ton of improvement from Read. You could tell something was up injury-wise all season. His skating was noticeably better/faster and he was creating chances. If he's healthy and back to his normal self he'll put some pucks in the net.
Flyers,3cceth,Stevepac9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:39:54 2015 UTC,"2nd or 3rd line don't really matter which one is higher on the depth chart.   It all depends on the coaches preference for ice time. Some coaches will try to roll all top 3 lines pretty evenly with even 4th line getting time, some will ride 1 and barely play 4th line.   People put too much stock into ""depth chart status"" because ice time fluctuations happen all year long with one line getting time due to play or match ups. If the third line is clicking and making chances they could play  more than the others. The only important piece to the depth chart is the line chemistry. Once you get a solid line it is irrelevant if they are the 2nd or 3rd."
Flyers,3cceth,dejatoo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:07:07 2015 UTC,Are you assuming Umberger is dealt?
Flyers,3cceth,DCJodon,2,Tue Jul 7 01:12:32 2015 UTC,Hopefully he just sits in the press box all season
Flyers,3cceth,_Slate,2,Tue Jul 7 04:45:11 2015 UTC,I'm honestly OK with this. I'd rather have that contract sit out than degrade his linemates/team.
Flyers,3cceth,DCJodon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:23:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I completely forgot about him. Hopefully Hextall finds a way to deal him.  edit: If not, at least he can be bought out rather painlessly after this season."
Flyers,3cceth,Hali_Stallions,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:16:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't pair our best D prospect with our worst defender.
Flyers,3cceth,thr4sher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:23:54 2015 UTC,"Button's an imbecile, but that aside ya the Flyers should be a bit better than last year."
Flyers,3cceth,fateislosthope,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:07:58 2015 UTC,honestly i think we have a way better team than most people give us credit for. hexy has made some really good moves and if one or two of our D prospects are ready to move up we would be in better shape. If hexy can convince Vinny to mutually terminate his contract and then use his buyout on McDonald we would have a ton of cap space to play with. Maybe pick up a winger in a trade that we currently cant afford to sign. Could be a good season. Just remember that the last time we made it to the finals we just barely made the playoffs. Anything can happen =)
