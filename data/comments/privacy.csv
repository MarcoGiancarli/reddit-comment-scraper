So Facebook knows your phone number and who has that phone number in their contacts before you even register. And when you do register, it can now link that previously unknown phone number to a person and show you all those people who you're phone number is connected.

privacy,3dzax7,cryptografreak,8,Mon Jul 20 20:35:52 2015 UTC,"Taking Zoho (suggested in sibling comment) as an example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoho_Corporation firstly you need to trust the organization to have good internal controls to protect against employees reading your mail (not that they would know or care to anyway). Then you'd need to trust the host countries (US and India) of workers not to compel them to bulk copy the email across ""just because"". It's reasonably believable the NSA or India would pull a Muscular on Zoho, too. If you host with a 3rd party mail provider, you're probably better using their @domain because @your-domain would provide a helpful pointer to anyone who cared enough to intercept just your mail (and Zoho totally wouldn't notice or care if that happened, but they would if @zoho was intercepted).  Hosting your own mail server either boils down to trusting a data center, or trusting your own home security and securing of mail server (which I think is what your question initially mentioned). A reputable hosting provider in a non-colonialist country is probably good enough for that."

I'm sorry to say the short answer is: it's complicated.  colonialist means exactly that - brutish, has spare resources to invest in military schemes. France falls within this, and afaik has laws that enable it to carry out mass surveillance. Smaller European nations may have less appetite and/or less resources to carry out unorthodox surveillance schemes. YMMV.

They'll need to send someone to your home (physically or digitally) to pick it up.  Personally I have several domains for various purposes for some of them I have also a web/mail hotel. I've had my mail like this for the last 10-15 years - I would never use a cloud service for something that important. I use mostly one.com - it's cheap and ok. They let you have unlimited emails (not aliases but actual emails) at no extra cost.

privacy,3dzax7,damonganto,5,Mon Jul 20 22:55:06 2015 UTC,"Having your mail ports open on your home internet connection isn't a big deal if your mail server is configured properly. But if you are just getting started and have never setup a mail server before (or just don't have time) check out Mail-in-a-Box.   Running a mail server from home is a good way to tinker and learn server administration and mail. In that case i say go for it. But I wouldn't do it for my production email. It can be a pain in the ass especially if you are providing email for other people besides yourself. Plus, adding fault tolerances and proper back ups to the equation can get pricey. Also, if you run your server from home and wish to stay out of everyones Spam Appliance or Junk Mail then you will want reverse DNS. Not all residential internet services have reverse DNS. Like with Comcast you have to go with Comcast Business and have a static IP in order to get reverse DNS, which is much more costly.  But again, if you want to run your own mail server just to tinker that's may not be a concern.   If you don't want to go with a smarthost like Zoho or Gandi and want to RYO that's commendable. You can safely run it on a VPS as long as you setup whole disk encryption. Vultr.com is an awesome VPS that lets you install from uploaded ISOs. Therefore you can upload a CentOS or OpenBSD ISO and setup whole disk encryption from the start. That way, even if someone has physical access to the server or starts up the system in Single User Mode they will still have to enter in a password for the encrypted disk. After you get everything installed the first thing you will want to do is secure the server: Install fail2ban/Denyhost, Aide, secure the ssh port with MFA and stuff like that. Simply because a VPSs IP block is going to be a much bigger target due to the high amount of unsecured servers. For example as soon as you boot up your VPS tail -f /var/logs/secure ( or auth.log) and just watch it for an hour and see how many brute force attempts you will see on port 22. But this is all stuff that I find fun, it's a good learning experience. There are tons of tutorials out there on how to harden a *nix server.   I highly recommend Vultr. I moved all of my VPSs from Digital Ocean to Vultr recently. I love that they have allow ISOs, I use OpenBSD a lot and with Digital Ocean that wasn't an option. They have an awesome API setup, MFA, and accept Bitcoin. I love bitcoin and I love supporting it, so that was a big plus for me."

The context you're giving me is that you wish to know how to reduce your EM signature.  Without making comment on a specific scenario, you'd be wanting a three tiered approach:   a Faraday Cage of sorts, perhaps a multi layered one. This is to block RF and similar signals. Do not use any wireless components - bluetooth, wifi, mouse/keyboard, etc. This is to reduce your ""footprint"". Using high quality filters on your power lines (aimed at radio noise rather than surge diversion) to help reduce noise being sent back down the line. A full online UPS (one that runs all the time, not a standby type one) may also be of use here. Some kind of wide-band RF noise source inside the ""cage"".

As for health risks, EM radiation is ""non ionizing"" (as opposed to nuclear radiation). #3 will certainly increase the amount of it inside the cage, but simply having the cage may or may not change much - you might trap locally generated RF inside with you, but external RF is blocked from entering. Either way, RF power decreases in an exponential manner, so unless you're pushing LOTS of power, it's unlikely to be an issue (but I am not an expert). For comparison, the occupation exposure limit for me working around radio components is significantly higher (by a factor of 100,000 or more) than a typical computer is likely to be able to output.

It's pretty old school and I'm sure they came up with something evolved (check Snowden's stuff...). To protect from that, people protected themselves by working in a Faraday cage environment. If you look at the PITA bread recent attack it's kind of the same principle with a much shorter range. I'm not sure foil is enough, even useful at all. You have to go full isolation from the outside.  About the radiation I think, and that's an opinion, that it's not so dangerous for most people, even in this type of closed environment. If you're worried about TEMPEST and working in a Faraday cage I don't think you're the kind of people to use WiFi inthere and radiations from one PC won't be harmful.

For a CRT the screen persistence has to be reversed (so sort of inverse filter), an LCD less so.  I'm think his device needed the target display to be in a darkened room.

If you post, use two different machine translation services to translate your post to a foreign language and back to English to mask writing patterns. Ensure no plugins are installed (Flash exploits have been used to unmask TOR users) and use something like uMatrix to block Javascript, frames, and the like.

privacy,3dyq4d,n0ko,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"I was researching about this in the last weeks.  I came to the conclusion that these approaches which use your login password to encrypt the emails, specially if you're using a webmail service, are not good. It's not difficult to the provider to change the login page in a way to capture your password without notice. This already happened with Hushmail.  Probably Mailbox.org (Germany) and Neomailbox  (Switzerland) are a little better in this aspect, because they use inbound encryption on demand (you just need your public key), so, if someone, for whatever reason, sends an unecrypted email  they automatically encrypt it with your public key, which can be unecrypted only with your private key, and being you're the only in possess of this key, no one will be capable of catch the emails at your side, unless they store an unecrypted copy of the email. Of course, someone can try to catch the sender. For outbond emails, you at least can encrypt it for who has a PGP key. But just remember they won't encrypt the emails you send, this is posible only if your contact has a PGP key.  Mailbox.org has as interesting feature: you can send or receive emails using the secure.mailbox.org domain. So, if someone sends an email to you or if you send an email to an email which has a server using an insecure conection, the email will be returned.  Just a reminder: they have a strange antispam policy. Instead of sending mails classified as spam to a spam folder, they just return the mail automatically to the sender. This is interesting, but if you get a bad luck day and get some spam in your inbox, you won't be capable of reporting that email as spam. They don't have this option. Neomailbox allows some granularity configurations, but nothing beyond this. My fear is about random newsletters or social network spamming saying some friend wants add you as a friend to that network (I'm looking to you, LinkedIn!).  These tables are interesting: https://www.privacytools.io/#email http://www.prxbx.com/email/  Anyway, these things are countermeasures. The only way of having a truly secure email is if everyone encrypt it on their side. Maybe the Whiteout app can help for who doesn't have good skillings in the use of PGP.  Disclaimer: I still didn't test any of these options. I'm still researching about this and only will do the transiction when the time permits. Currently I use FastMail and Outlook."

privacy,3dwp5c,sparkleselite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:36:17 2015 UTC,"The point of OTR is that it's designed to protect you even in a case where the transmission medium is unsecured. So for example, both Pidgin and Adium are chat clients that support OTR. You can use Adium to connect to your Facebook account, and then have an OTR protected conversation over Facebook. Even though someone has access to the whole message stream, it's not enough information to decrypt the contents. And even content is decrypted, there's no guarantee you actually wrote what they found .   Anyway, what I would recommend depends on what, how, and with whom you're communicating. Here are some suggestions:   cryptocat. Secure messenger that's easy to use. Share a ""room key"" by voice beforehand, and you can have a secure conversation over their network. Open source, and often scrutinized.  textsecure/signal (different names on android/ios, respectively). Strong OTR encryption built into an easy to use text messaging client. Open source, often scrutinized, recommended by the EFF.  pidgin/Adium. Chat clients that handle any chat system you can think of. Open source, widely used. Not as well scrutinized, but uses the same library as the above so likely very secure.  GPG. Encrypt any arbitrary text or file so that only the recipient can decrypt them, and so they can verify it came from you. Uses key pairs for identity management, which is a bit hard to wrap your head around. I like it best in an easy to use email plugin, like mailvelope for Gmail. Open source, very scrutinized, and very likely unbreakable without very significant resources.  a VPN. sets up an encrypted ""tunnel"" for all your communications.

Like someone said in a coment in an article about a privacy-focused phone (Blackphone) on Ars Technica.  http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/06/exclusive-a-review-of-the-blackphone-the-android-for-the-paranoid/?comments=1&post=27127867  Windows Phone has a basic problem: it doesn't have encryption. Android has encryption. iOS has encryption. BlackBerry has encryption. This is a shame. In the opposite, it seems to have one of the best policy updates, including fixing for eventual security bugs, an area where Android totally sucks except for Nexus devices.  Well, the only application I know for secure communications with a version for Windows Phone is Linphone, which uses SIP and offers the option for calls encrypted with ZRTP (also for some reason the encryption isn't enabled by default, you need to go to settings). But it only encrypt calls, not messages.  About Telegram: stay away from it. The cryptography behind it is not good, it seems they are just looking to provide a false sensation of security.  http://www.cryptofails.com/post/70546720222/telegrams-cryptanalysis-contest  http://unhandledexpression.com/2013/12/17/telegram-stand-back-we-know-maths/  www.alexrad.me/discourse/a-264-attack-on-telegram-and-why-a-super-villain-doesnt-need-it-to-read-your-telegram-chats.html  thoughtcrime.org/blog/telegram-crypto-challenge/  And don't get an ilusion about e-mail. E-mail is a federated thing. You can use Tutanota and send encrypted emails to non-Tutanota users (don't expect people to get a Tutanota address), but these non-Tutanota users won't like to do the extra-effort of viewing the encrypted e-mail with you sent  to they. Also, when they'll send or reply an e-mail to you, they'll do this without encryption, so in the end of history, the effort to encrypt will be useless. And personally I don't like the Tutanota approach about encryption, I don't see how this differs from the Hushmail one (they can change the login page for some targets and get the passwords of these targets without notice). The same goes to ProtonMail. http://www.wired.com/2007/11/hushmail-to-war/  What I can suggest to you is to avoiding Facebook, and do your part on your side. Even if the rest of people don't do anything about this, it won't be your fault. Leave the most sensible things to do directly, person-to-person, instead of using Facebook or e-mail."

Also, as RMS mentioned many times, any phone can spy on you at any time using the camera(s) and microphone. It can also send your GPS location somewhere without your knowledge. And it can do all of this outside of the control of the OS and even if the phone is ""off.""  Even I possibly get spied on with my phone, even though my OS is comprised entirely of libre software, and I followed the guide on torproject.org to harden my phone. The firmwares and bootloader on my phone are still proprietary, and cannot be trusted.  And on my computer, which is also comprised entirely of libre software using Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, has a CPU made by Intel, and several other chips that I do not have the schematics for. The UEFI on my computer is also proprietary. How do I know nobody is stealing the encryption keys to my hard drive when I type it in, or from RAM directly?  Regardless, I have done as much as possible for now to protect myself, and I only use proprietary software, such as games, offline if possible on a seperate OS.  You cannot use proprietary software of any kind and expect it to respect your privacy. Not even proprietary graphics card drivers, which could be taking screenshots and sending it somewhere. Nothing I can prove, so that's why I keep saying ""could"" and ""is possible/probably.""  Windows has known backdoors in Windows Update, which can automatically install software on your computer at any time. Windows 10 Home edition forces this on the user, and you cannot prove that disabling the option on Pro and/or previous versions of Windows can disable this functionality. And SIM cards have been known to collect data on people, as they are actually small computers.

Those are the best tools we have for secure communication on phones. Ask the people you communicate with the most to install that as well. For Android this is easy as TextSecure replaces their SMS app, sending regular SMS to those without TextSecure and encrypted messages to those who do.

I can get a SIM and device anonymously, I can use the cellular networks ""fairly"" anonymously then as my info has never been attached to the IMEI unless someone is snooping and recording names etc in an effort to ID me specifically. I can communicate with end to end encryption apps anonymously, but I can't set up the phone anonymously as far as I know as I need a Google account and I can't get one anonymously as they don't allow TOR sign ups etc and they won't allow log ins from multiple countries for use.   I get locked out of my own Gmail when in different countries unless I use paper codes for 2FA since I don't use the same device everywhere so 2FA SMS is out.

You can definitely run Android without Google apps, but it will require tinkering to some extent. You will be able to sideload apps from the play store with a program on the PC, then put them on your phone and install the .apk file to your phone like this. This is actually not a problem at all and pretty convenient - you can even automatically check for updates for all of your apps with this tool.  Some apps will not work without the Google framework installed to Android, because they are programmed in a way that they are dependent on it. This includes all the Google apps (Google Maps, Hangouts, Gmail, and so on). Of course, there are apps that work quite well and do not require Google Frameworks.

TextSecure still serves the SMS app, ie. it receives unencrypted texts and if you message someone who has TextSecure it upgrades to encrypted and sends it over data.

The wider a group of people are clustered, the more data this tracker has and the quicker it will be able to filter out the signal from the noise. However, a wider cluster of people will also have a smaller common denominator to advertise to. In this case, all users of TrackMeNot and AdNauseam and such will likely be put into a cluster together, and eventually the current algorithm will be able to find out that these people click on the buttons to buy tinfoil hats slightly more often than the rest, and this results in ads to buy tinfoil hats. Perhaps these privacy-minded people are also more interested in computer games, but let's say that is then all of the common denominator of this cluster.  In reality, among these people there can be sub-clusters and sub-sub-clusters, all the way down to a single person (and these clusters may overlap in any way). However, the smaller these clusters get, the less data is available on their searches, and the harder it will get to filter out the noise / the less accurate their profile will be.  So the conclusion is that adding noise with an add-on such as this would cluster you together with people using the same add-on (and the same settings on how much bandwidth it uses and such). But to find out more than the common denominator of this initial cluster it will require more data if more noise is added. If everyone were to use the same noise-generating add-on, then the ability of trackers to produce an accurate profile is definitely impeded. But even if not everyone is, being in a cluster together with you guys is good enough for me!"

The incinerator of human history is fierce.  A huge portion of organizational systems throughout our past that people thought were 100% permanent and immortal have utterly vanished from the face of the earth.  The track record of websites is actually far worse.  Yes, things are getting better, and there's good reason to believe the data will be preserved.  Archival sites make this even more likely.  Still, every site and every data storage method have multiple points of vulnerability and failure, and archives don't capture everything.

The point of the security in FLOSS is that you can read and compile it yourself if you don't trust the source. Reading the source is only half the work. You probably do fly in open source airplanes. The Linux kernel is on all kinds of stuff from TVs to routers to maybe even that plane.

If the site still does not work, see if the other two are likely to be related and required to work.  Given the name, redditstatic.com is likely to be related to reddit.com so you could maybe Temporarily allow redditstatic.com  to see if it helps.  If it does you could make the change permanent.   As you know google-analytics.com is related to user tracking you can safely ignore it.

It can be more reliable than a dedicated server at a reduced cost depending on your provider and how it is managed.  It sounds like you already know what a VPN is, but just in case, a VPN is a Virtual Private Network. In modern practice a VPN is an encrypted tunnel that connects your computer to other computers or a router. VPNs can be used to protect your internet traffic from surveillance and can assist in making your online presence somewhat anonymous. However, VPN is not a complete online security tool and in order to be effective should be used along with several other tools, like a secured web browser, and safe browsing behavior, such as disabling the use of flash and invasive scripts."

privacy,3doubt,xiongchiamiov,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:05:57 2015 UTC,"So I've scanned through the first one, on attacking Tor with website fingerprinting. They do not propose a new fingerprinting technique but an augmentation to existing techniques. They assume the traffic is sniffed at the ISP and try to determine whether the user visits one of a list of monitored websites.  Nothing is said about the website fingerprinting technique itself, though, but they augment existing techniques by tackling two problems: Updating the training set for classifying whether a packet belongs to a monitored website (since this set includes also a lot of non-monitored sites), and splitting Tor packets to make each part belong to only one website.  Keeping the training set updated is done by taking samples of websites and dropping the oldest samples. Some websites are sampled more often than others, depending on how often they change.  Splitting Tor packets between websites is done first with the timestamp of packets. If they are further than t seconds apart they are assumed to be different webpages. Next, a machine learning classifier, trained on website fragments, determines whether or not a packet contains multiple pages. Tests determine that a Time-k-Nearest-Neighbour technique is most effective. Finally, a machine learning technique, trained on website fragments, splits a packet in pieces. Tests determine that a k-Nearest-Neighbour technique is most effective, but even that doesn't work very well.  Finally, they also conclude that they are not able to filter out noise, such as when people are listening to streaming music over Tor."

privacy,3dmyt3,Showtime54,5,Fri Jul 17 18:01:13 2015 UTC,Can you provide a few tips on safety regarding F-Droid?   Treat updates to apps installed from F-Droid with the utmost suspicion as all their signing keys are stored online and could be used to push out updates for any app if they get compromised or someone with access goes rogue. In contrast to Play where each developer holds their own private key and so even if compromised (or Google is compelled) they can't push out updates to arbitrary apps.  This and being slow to update is why TextSecure isn't available on F-Droid. Whisper Systems have said they're working on an alternative to both Play and F-Droid but there's been no update on that yet.
privacy,3dmyt3,oxychromaticdynamite,4,Fri Jul 17 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for not being very clear.   /u/cathalgarvey is correct that using F-Droid is not inherently risky. The problem is installing random apps onto your phone. To use F-Droid you have to allow ""Unknown sources"" to be installed on the phone and maybe even have Root access but i'm not sure.  For the average user (which is myself and the vast majority of people) this is a huge security risk. I know I'm not competant enough to compile my own Android apps and am basically trusting that I'm not installing something dangerous.  Also /u/Showtime54  being open source does not automatically make an application more secure or safe.   Moxie does a good job of explaining why TextSecure is through the play store here.   The point is that TextSecure is primarily aimed at people who don't and shouldn't have to worry about all of this nonsense. They just get to install an app and have secure messaging. Everyone who is more advanced can build the app from source on their own."

privacy,3dk77g,EncryptedOrgasms,3,Thu Jul 16 22:54:30 2015 UTC,"Overall I'd say Ricochet, but let me explain my reasoning.  Content Protection  All of the applications you listed do end-to-end encryption.  Metadata Protecion  RetroShare should protect metadata from passive observers but has not been well reviewed.  BitMessage protects metadata by sending every message to everyone, but this is not thought to be scalable, and BitMessage's protocol has never been formally analyzed or audited.  Ricochet uses TOR, which has had intense review, to protect metadata.  While hidden services are in an unmaintained state and operation onymous was quite a scare, breaking a hidden service would require lots of effort.  Perfect security is impossible, we should focus on forcing agencies to have to spend some time and effort to break into something, as opposed to being able to collect information through passive surveillance.  Then they would have to focus on the real targets, which is something I can get behind.  Review  OTR (Pidgin-OTR) and PGP (gpg) have been well reviewed. They don't protect metadata, but if you are more concerned with unknown vulnerabilities in software that hasn't been well studied, I'd look here.  Other thoughts  I would avoid TOX for now.  While direct P2P is probably ideal for extremely low latency needs (video chat), the development community has had issues.  A lead developer stole donated funds and there was a very unprofessional fallout from that.  Also, there's been no review of the code yet to my knowledge.  Going forward  None of these applications are multi-device (synced history), and few are cross platform.  I'm currently developing a chat application on I2P that allows for multi-device use and has a focus on mobile clients, something I think is needed for any real adoption."

I currently have a 30gb Truecrypt container stored there. The beauty of Dropbox is that only changed parts of the container are uploaded onto the dropbox servers, not all 30gb. The only other cloud service I know of that can do this is Hubic (last checked ~2 years ago, maybe that changed).  Regarding encryption, there are several options:  You can use containers (eg. Truecrypt), encrypt every file individually (eg. AxCrypt) or use one of the cloud encryption tools (eg. Boxcryptor, CryptSync). I wouldn't create a container for each and every file. Instead use one (or a few) containers or encrypt files individually. But given what you want to do (store files in the cloud and work with them) I would use a cloud encryption tool like Boxcryptor.   Does encrypting a file change its storage size? If I have a 50KB word document and encrypt it, will the size increase?    In Boxcryptor it does, probably in other tools, too.   Will my computer run much slower if every file is individually encrypted versus if all of my files are in one container?   I guess this depends on the used hardware. But there should be no problem with a relative up to date pc, especially not if you are encrypting some small files like Word docs.   Once I upload one container to some backup service, can I open up the container in the service and delete any old files that have since been updated?    What do you mean by opening in the service? On the website of the service? I don't think that's possible unless you find an encryption method that's integrated into their web service.   The thought of using something like encryption on my files – or even my entire hard drive – freaks me out a little bit because if you forget one password, everything is gone, but I think that’s probably worth the risk too.    Backups are very important whether you encrypt your files or not.

With hard drive encryption, this isn't an issue. So does that mean a login password is good enough?

You don't notice that on your end, but when you change those files and save them, only those chunks of the file that changed are uploaded again, not the rest.  3) VeraCrypt is basically TrueCrypt, with some minor improvements and ongoing development put into it. TrueCrypt has been extensively audited and checked for problems, and none have been found. Both tools are open source, meaning that people who know their way around code can relatively easily go check out the code and look at the differences.  Generally I'd say if you're willing to trust TrueCrypt, you can trust VeraCrypt as well.  4) Harddrive encryption. The most ""convenient"" ways to do this on Windows and Mac are closed source solutions developed by Microsoft (BitLocker) and Apple (FileVault) respectively. Both of those encrypt stuff using your login password, so yes, having a strong one helps, and as long as the machine is powered off, the harddrive is as secure as the solution used to encrypt it.   Since closed source encryption solutions are generally not as trusted as open source ones however, many people are unwilling to trust BitLocker and FileVault. Windows machines can use TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt for system encryption.  4) Regarding login passwords: I'm not aware of anything that makes login passwords inherently less secure or easy to break than others, and I suppose you can take solace in the fact that if something major does go wrong with those, Microsoft/Apple would be in deep shit.  5) Encrypted data ""looks"" like jumbled, random data if you just look at it.

How do you do this for free? In the past, I read that the only way to increase storage was by connecting your dropbox to things like your mail account and social media accounts (which doesn't seem very safe). Is it possible to have multiple dropbox accounts?    When you upload big files, dropbox splits them into ""chunks"" and uploads those. You don't notice that on your end, but when you change those files and save them, only those chunks of the file that changed are uploaded again, not the rest.   This makes sense. I was just wondering how dropbox can tell which parts of an encrypted container need changing. Are you saying that if I want to upload something to dropbox, I just need to upload containers as I please and dropbox will do the rest? For example, lets say I upload a container with document A and document B. A week later, I upload the same container again, except this time there's a document C and document A has been altered. Will the first container simply be replaced/updated with this new version that now has a document C and changes to document A? Does this only apply if you're uploading the same container again? (if you make an entirely new container, even with the same documents inside, will that just create two copies within dropbox?) - sorry if this is confusing!   Regarding login passwords: I'm not aware of anything that makes login passwords inherently less secure or easy to break than others, and I suppose you can take solace in the fact that if something major does go wrong with those, Microsoft/Apple would be in deep shit.   This is something I've been confused about. Everyone on this sub seems to say that login passwords are extremely unsecure. I know that a big reason they aren't secure is because you can remove the hard drive and put it in another computer, but even if that was theoretically impossible, everyone still seems to say that those login passwords aren't secure. I never understood why - aren't they as secure as any other password system? Even the password protect system Microsoft uses for word documents (you can now add a password to word documents) is apparently very unsecure. So long as you use a good password, isn't it as secure as any other password protected system? Even if Microsoft could gain access to password protected word documents, why would they ruin their entire business by doing that, thus blacklisting themselves?  Thank you so much!"
privacy,3dkvmz,filthylee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:47:35 2015 UTC,"1) Dropbox promos. One I recall was when they introduced their auto camera upload feature - you got permanent bonus space up to a couple gigs for every photo you uploaded using that feature. I haven't used Dropbox in a long time though, so I don't know if they still do these kinds of promos. The big chunks of free bonus space are however definitely not something you can get on demand, as far as I'm aware.   Regarding multiple db accounts: I think you can have multiple accounts, but you can't use more than one simultaneously on any device.  2) Yes, you can just upload containers as you please - chunking happens in the background. If you create an encrypted container, the entire container (and any chunks it may be divided into) are newly created random data. When you open the container, add or change a file, save it, and upload the container, dropbox will only reupload the chunks that changed due to that one file being changed. So if any chunks were removed or changed due to what you did with the files in them, dropbox will sync them accordingly.  If you make a new container, new random data will be created, and the container will look entirely different than the old one - so the new container will have to be fully uploaded again.  As an example: you create container A with 100mb size. On your first sync, db will upload 100mb worth of chunks. If you then go and add 10mb worth of files to the container, only the chunks affected by those changes (ideally close to 10mb, depending on chunk size and some other stuff) will be reuploaded and overwritten on the server - the other chunks haven't changed, so no action is necessary.  If you then create a new container B with 50mb, that container will have no chunks in common with container A,  so all 50mb will have to be uploaded.  3) Regarding login passwords. As I said - there may be something I'm not aware of, but I'd say it always depends on what you want those passwords to protect. If you want your login password to protect your unencrypted data from someone who has physical access to the drive then yeah, its not gonna be particularly useful, but if you just want to keep some nasty sibling away from your facebook account, even a cryptographically unsound implementation would likely generally do the trick.  In the cases of Windows and Mac, the implementation of those passwords and login screens is closed source afaik, and thus considered inherently insecure/untrustworthy by many - but thats pretty much all I can come up with. If someone else can shed more light on this, I'd be curious as well.  Regarding Word passwords: getting encryption wrong is incredibly easy, even for big corporations, and especially when the system in question isn't particularly important - such as Word document encryption - because then you don't even really have any particular incentive to actually put any effort into it.  Its a somewhat different thing for more critical systems like BitLocker, which many companies rely on to keep their stuff secure - but the big question mark of a closed source implementation remains.  As a quick example on why closed source cryptography has a pretty bad rap: there is a concept in IT security known as security through obscurity - basically the equivalent of hiding the key to your house under your doormat. That solution is perfectly secure, but only as long as nobody knows the key is hidden under your doormat - once they do, its effectively useless.  The same concept can be applied to cryptography, which is one reason why closed source implementations tend to be inherently distrusted. You may know for sure that the door is locked right now, but you can never be sure that there isn't some key hidden under some doormat somewhere."
privacy,3dkvmz,filthylee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"What do you think about google drive? Does that sync as well? I love the privacy dropbox offers (they got an amazing privacy rating this year in comparison to google products), but I don't know how easy it will be for me to get extra space. If you can have multiple accounts though, it might not matter. I was just swayed slightly by google drives 15G of free space.    Regarding multiple db accounts: I think you can have multiple accounts, but you can't use more than one simultaneously on any device   I'll check this out   As an example: you create container A with 100mb size. On your first sync, db will upload 100mb worth of chunks. If you then go and add 10mb worth of files to the container, only the chunks affected by those changes (ideally close to 10mb, depending on chunk size and some other stuff) will be reuploaded and overwritten on the server - the other chunks haven't changed, so no action is necessary.  If you then create a new container B with 50mb, that container will have no chunks in common with container A, so all 50mb will have to be uploaded.   Alright. Let me see if I know how this works (I'm sorry for being so naïve - I don't know much about encryption, and I want to make 100% sure that I'm understanding this correctly).   Lets say I make an encrypted container with veracrypt and put my documents in. Does the container appear on my desktop, like a folder? Can I update the container? I know you can probably add new files in, but can you add a new version of the same file to the container and have the old version replaced? Can you name containers?  And you're saying that once you put a container in dropbox, you can't just add a document to the container in dropbox. You have to add it to the container on your desktop, and then put the entire container in dropbox again, but it won't be an additional container (it'll simply 'replace' the older version of the same container with new changes).   What can you put into an encrypted container anyways?    If you want your login password to protect your unencrypted data from someone who has physical access to the drive then yeah, its not gonna be particularly useful   But if my hard drive is encrypted, does that mean the password is effectively safe enough to protect me from anyone who has physical access to my computer? How do I protect myself from hackers - I have Norton installed.    In the cases of Windows and Mac, the implementation of those passwords and login screens is closed source afaik, and thus considered inherently insecure/untrustworthy by many    So basically, people are worried that windows will look at your login password and abuse it? Is that the only risk, or are there other threats as well? Why would windows or mac ruin their reputation by doing this?    Regarding Word passwords: getting encryption wrong is incredibly easy, even for big corporations, and especially when the system in question isn't particularly important - such as Word document encryption - because then you don't even really have any particular incentive to actually put any effort into it.   So you're basically saying that the reason word document password protection is unsafe isn't because the passwords themselves are somehow easy to crack, but because the encryption system used could have flaws/holes in it?   Is bitlocker better than veracrypt?

privacy,3dkvmz,TheMeerkat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:25:35 2015 UTC,"1) I've never used Google Drive, so I can't really comment on what it can or can't do. What I can say is that Google products are problematic when it comes to privacy, because Google is everywhere on the web.  If you have one of their services running on your machine at all times (such as Drive, or even a Gmail account that syncs regularly), that makes it significantly easier for them to profile your activity, since they don't have to guess who you are from your browsing habits.  2) Can't really comment on Dropbox privacy since I haven't used it for ages and don't know what they've done since then, but Dropbox remains problematic if you store unencrypted data which, technically, anyone on their end could look at. Other services (like SpiderOak or Wuala, both mentioned in this thread) encrypt your data locally before sending it to their servers, so the only thing they ever see is encrypted random data. This is privacy by policy (""We won't look at your data, honest"" -  dropbox) vs privacy by design (""We can't look at your data""- SpiderOak/Wuala).  3) VeraCrypt containers are regular files that can be called whatever you want. Once you ""mount"" the container through VeraCrypt, you get a new drive that basically acts like a thumbstick when you plug it in, meaning you can put whatever you want on there, and replace/change/remove files just like on a normal drive/thumbstick.  You could just give it a shot - VC leads you through the steps quite nicely.  Once you put the container into db/any other sync client, it behaves like I explained in the previous post. Chunking happens in the background, and you can use it just like a regular thumbstick.   And you're saying that once you put a container in dropbox, you can't just add a document to the container in dropbox. You have to add it to the container on your desktop, and then put the entire container in dropbox again, but it won't be an additional container (it'll simply 'replace' the older version of the same container with new changes).   Regarding this: no. You put the container file into db, then mount the container using VC. You get the new drive that you can use as you please, and chunking/uploading etc happens in the background with no need to worry about it. The encrypted data will always lie in the encrypted file in your db folder, even if you get that new 'thumbdrive' on, say, J:\ or whichever other letter was assigned to it.   But if my hard drive is encrypted, does that mean the password is effectively safe enough to protect me from anyone who has physical access to my computer? How do I protect myself from hackers - I have Norton installed.   Yes, an encrypted drive and strong password mean that someone with physical access to your machine will have to go through some troubles to get access. Better passwords are obviously harder to crack - if you use the name of your dog as a password, all the encryption in the world won't help if someone simply guesses it.  ""How do I protect myself from hackers"" is kind of a rabbit hole question, but generally having antivirus and a two-way firewall running (depending on the product Norton does both, I think) is a good start.   So basically, people are worried that windows will look at your login password and abuse it? Is that the only risk, or are there other threats as well? Why would windows or mac ruin their reputation by doing this?   No - as you say the data they'd get from spying arguably wouldn't outweigh the hit to their reputation they'd take if it went public. Besides, I think their privacy policy has a thing or two to say about it as well.  The problem here is that Microsofts implementations are closed source, so nobody knows if theres any keys under any doormats somewhere, or if there are any exploits that might make the system susceptible to tampering or intrusion.    So you're basically saying that the reason word document password protection is unsafe isn't because the passwords themselves are somehow easy to crack, but because the encryption system used could have flaws/holes in it?   Might be both - passwords are often easy to crack because the crypto has holes or flaws in it. For example there are cryptographic mechanisms that slow down brute force guessing of the password by slowing down login attempts. So in a system that doesn't have those mechanisms, someone may be able to guess a hypothetical 10000 passwords per second, whereas those mechanisms could slow it down to one password per second or less. Implementing that stuff is effort, implementing it without flaws even moreso - in non-critical systems like Word encryption, I'd be surprised if they actually put that amount of effort into it.   Is bitlocker better than veracrypt?   BitLocker is closed source - nobody knows if its good because nobody knows the implementation (outside Microsoft), VeraCrypt is open source and has for the most part been audited by experts with no serious flaws found.

privacy,3dkvmz,clearly-enhanced,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:23:20 2015 UTC,"Two options come to mind:  Option 1  Try Wuala. On paper it is a very secure storage enviornment with local file encryption and a zero-knowledge policy. It offers backup capabilities and delta-sync functionality, so only modified bits will be synced. There is no free version, so you'll have to pay for the service. I think 100 Gb of storage cost 9,99 € / month.   It has a few downsides. It is not open-source (like 99% of all sync programs), it's Java-based, Wuala does not offer multi-factor authentication, active development seems to have come to a standstill.   You could also try Tresorit. Tresorit will encrypt your files locally and store them in the cloud. It uses AES256 encryption and offers two-factor authentication. It is easy to use and there is a free version out there for you two test - it is limited to 3 Gb of storage space, though. It is not a backup service though. Tresorit is a sync program, so all changes you made will be synced across all devices. They're woking on a Webdav-based storage solution, though.   Another backup service, which i haven't used yet, is Carbonite. I hear great things about it from people I trust, but I can't talk about it in great detal. You should look into it, though.  Option 2  You can always use a service like Dropbox or Google Drive and encrypt your files locally with a software named ""BoxCryptor"". Local file encryption is a KEY feature for any type of backup or sync software and it's a shame that so few companies offer it. With BoxCryptor, however, you can do just that and it's free to use. It is easy to set up, works great in combination with any sync program you choose and it offers great security (i.e. useage of AES and RSA standards)."

Pretty much all should have the former, but it's not a guarantee of confidentiality because you can't ever trust the Provider itself and transfer encryption means the data is decrypted again upon arrival on their servers.  For the special kind of encryption happening before data is sent: You have that with at least tutanota (it's their selling point really). But I would not put too much trust in that either, because the encryption is performed by a javascript-blob that is served to you by the site; they do develop that code in the open (it's on github, I think), but in the end the code your browser receives doesn't have to be the same as on github.  If you want security (meaning confidentiality and integrity) you will have to encrypt locally via GPG. In which case those fancy interfaces of tutanota etc won't be of much use, because you will have to interface with POP3/IMAP/SMTP.   Knowing about legal compliance events. Negative statements in case of non-disclosure agreements,   Hard to tell for most of these rather new providers.

He's saying that, on Microsoft email accounts, there's no way to revoke access from a computer where you logged in and choose to remember the login, even if you change your password afterwards.  It has more practical implications. If you logged in a laptop in a permanent way and that laptop is stolen, if the thief manages to access the account, he can surely access the email account even if you try to change the password from another computer. Or if someone manages to hack into your account, that person will have a persistent access to that account and there's nothing you can do to kick her out."

privacy,3dg85s,falseEpaulets,2,Fri Jul 17 08:23:06 2015 UTC,"If you're truly concerned about privacy, you should host your own email server. It requires a little bit of technical experience, but it's nothing that you can't handle after a few Google searches. You could host it on a server of your own or you could rent a VPS."
privacy,3dg85s,bacondev,2,Thu Jul 16 06:40:03 2015 UTC,I'm considering doing this. Doesn't it require a huge amount of ongoing work to maintain?
privacy,3dg85s,kqjwfrbkj,9,Thu Jul 16 06:55:48 2015 UTC,"Maintenance? No, it's not really too bad. It'd be helpful to know your way around in the event of an attack (e.g. email bomb, abuse of an open mail relay, etc.), but if you're hosting a server just for yourself or a few others, the chance of receiving an attack like that is nearly nil. For the most part, it only calls for a decent time investment to set up. After that, things are usually fairly smooth.  Before I continue, I'll provide a few definitions of some acronyms (some of which are important but I don't use here).   MUA: a mail user agent; the software with which most users are familiar, use to compose emails, etc. MTA: a mail transfer agent; software that sends email to a recipient, receives email from a sender, and relays the email messages to an MDA. MSA: a mail submission agent; software that accepts messages from an MUA and sending them to an MTA. MRA: a mail retrieval agent; software that retrieves messages from a server and sends them to an MDA; different from an MTA in that it acts as a client instead of a server. MDA: a mail delivery agent; software that accepts messages from an MTA and places the messages in the users' mailboxes. MAA: a mail access agent; software that bridges the MUA with mailboxes. SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol; an Internet standard for sending and (seldom in practice) receiving electronic mail. IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol; an Internet standard for receiving electronic mail. POP: Post Office Protocol; an Internet standard for receiving electronic mail. The most recent version of this is POP3. IP address: Internet Protocol address; a number assigned to a device connected to a computer that serves as an address DNS: Domain Name System; an naming system for resources connected to the Internet; most commonly maps domains to IP addresses. TLS: Transport Layer Security; a cryptographic protocol for encrypting communications over a network. SSL: Secure Sockets Layer; another cryptographic protocol for encrypting communications over a network.   Additionally, I'll provide a relatively simplistic overview of how an email is transmitted from a sender to a recipient. For convenience, I have applied special formatting to the critical steps.   The sender writes a message in their MUA. The sender submits the message to their MSA. (Optional) The sender's MSA authenticates them. The sender's MSA ascertains that they are authorized to send mail. The sender's MSA might rewrite some headers. The sender's MSA submits the message to their MTA. The sender's MSA reports a successful submission to their MUA. The sender's MTA ascertains that both the sender and recipient are both valid and permitted. The sender's MTA ascertains that the content is both valid and permitted. (Optional) The sender's MTA applies content filters. (Optional) The sender's MTA rewrites some headers. The sender's MTA conforms to a number of standardized protocols to send a email to the recipient's MTA. The recipient's MTA sends an acknowledgement of the transmission to the sender's MTA. The recipient's MTA ascertains that both the sender and recipient are both valid and permitted. The recipient's MTA ascertains that the content is both valid and permitted. (Optional) The recipient's MTA apples content filters. (Optional) The recipient's MTA rewrites some headers. The recipient's MTA submits the message to their MDA. (Optional) The recipient's MDA cross-references filters or rules for the message. The recipient's MDA stores the message in their mailbox. The recipient's MAA detects a new message. The recipient's MAA signal their MUA of the new message. The recipient's MUA gets the message from their MAA and possibly uses an MRA as an intermediate step. The recipient's MUA presents the message.   Moving forward, the main thing to consider is that if something is going awry on your server, you won't receive messages. If your physical server can't be contacted, the message will be returned as undeliverable. If your MTA isn't functioning, the sender's MTA might or might not (depending on the implementation and configuration) periodically retry sending the email until your MTA acknowledges reception. If your MDA isn't functioning, your mailbox won't actually receive the messages.  Next, we have three things to consider. First, it's healthy to periodically check on the status of the server, especially if you haven't received any mail recently. Admittedly, your MUA would probably notify you in the event of a connection issue. Second, when selecting a server, try to ensure the most uptime as possible. The last thing you want is to have regular struggles with your server. Lastly, we need to account for the possibility of spam and viruses.  Lastly, use TLS for all of your email activity. Sending and receiving emails in an unencrypted manner largely defeats the purpose of hosting your own email server.  In conclusion, if you're truly interested in setting up an email server, Ars Technica ran a series of articles with an introductory-level tutorial on how to do so. Admittedly, I have not followed this tutorial, but skimming through it, I think it covers all of the bases very well.   ""How to run your own e-mail server with your own domain, part 1"" ""Taking e-mail back, part 2: Arming your server with Postfix and Dovecot"" ""Taking e-mail back, part 3: Fortifying your box against spammers"" ""Taking e-mail back, part 4: The finale, with webmail & everything after""   I don't know what level of technical expertise you have, so I apologize if any of that seemed a bit over-explained or condescending.  If you have any questions, feel free to let me know. Additionally, you can check out /r/sysadmin, /r/AskNetsec, Server Fault, or of course Google or Wikipedia."

The main things you need to worry about is uptime (so you can receive mails), handling spam (especially reducing false positives), and making sure your server doesn't get on any spam blocklists (because your emails won't arrive then).  Setting it up is easy, but is does take a bit of maintenance to do it.  Source: sysadmin who does this for a living."

My home server has poor uptime, but that should improve as I sort out the kinks with the other programs I have running.

If I just configure my VPN, will that prevent my sent mail being marked as spam?   Assuming that you are routing your email traffic through the VPN and that the VPN isn't blacklisted, yes, that would work. However, you have to bear in mind that you're adding another point possible failure by doing. Additionally, you'd be adding some latency to all of the transmissions.  I would highly discourage using your home to host your email server. First, a typical home far less reliable than a data center in terms of uptime. Second, a home-based server is more difficult to set up and manage. Third, it would be much easier for police to seize your mailbox. Obviously, you can do whatever you want, but I figured that I should at least express the downsides to it—not to imply that there aren't upsides."

Then have some logic that checks to see if any of your messages to a person are being delivered.  If not, notify the sender and give them the opportunity to revert to unencrypted messages.   And that's just what I came up with in 30 seconds.  The point is that excuses as to why something is difficult doesn't mean that a user-unfriendly feature is suddenly user friendly.    As it stands, this flaw alone means that this app is not for normal use.  Which is fine for niche product.  Do we want secure messages to be a niche?"

I'm pretty sure that if it was a non-Mac product, (i.e. an Android) the product would be blamed, but Apple has some kind of special magic that gets people to conclude that the problem is not that iPhone sometimes assumes you have data coverage when you don't, but rather than they should have got a data plan no matter how much it cost.

The former is a fork of textsecure from when their messaging was based on sending through SMS. This also brings the issue of trust of the new devs.  SMS limits you to certain characters and isn't always convenient since people may be in different continents. This will cost them money for each SMS message. Whereas textsecure is generally more convenient since it is cheaper on data and lighter.  Also there was a reason to keep it on Play store but I can't remember why. It is also a huge exaggeration to call users of Play store a part of a botnet.  tl;dr - they are similar (SMSsecure is a fork of textsecure) but work in different ways.

Regardless of motherboard, get the most recent version of the BIOS, install it (after verifying its integrity, e.g., via MD5 checksumming), and then grab a copy of your installed BIOS from the motherboard routinely and compare it against the pristine copy (which you're hopefully storing somewhere safe).  Do the same for all drives.  Also all video cards and NICs.  Do all your work out of Whonix or similar.  Excel spreadsheets can be worked with via LibreOffice or similar.  Disable all radios on the PC.  Preferably, buy a motherboard without onboard bluetooth or wifi.  Only connect to the network when absolutely necessary.  Keep the computer physically disconnected from the network when not actively using it.    Physically unplug the computer's power when it's not in active use.  Any networking should be done via VPN, and from behind a strong firewall and NIDS/NIPS.  Do not use Flash, Java, or Javascript.  When web browsing (which should be kept to a minimum), use only the TBB, with the security slider set on ""high"".  Never use any form of ""cloud"" service.  Do not use the computer near a window, or in view of one.  Preferably use it in a windowless interior room (basement if possible).  Do not connect your cellphone or any other device that has not been previously secured and verified to your computer.  Install a ""dummy"" OS.  E.g., Windows 10.

I have used them before.  Now the technical stuff:  A VPN encrypts all traffic between you and the VPN server. If you are the only person using that VPN server, the websites and servers you connect to will be able to uniquely identify you. But if lots of people are sharing a VPN server then your traffic looks the same as all the others, which is where the claim of anonymity comes from. Anyone who is monitoring the incoming and outgoing traffic of that VPN server could identify you pretty quickly though.  Tor encrypts all traffic between you and the first node, then it sends that to two other nodes before going on to the website you want. This provides better anonymity because someone would have to monitor the first node and the last node to follow your traffic. This is very hard to do.  A socks5 proxy does not encrypt traffic between you and the proxy server. If you're concerned about being monitored by your school, workplace, or government, socks5 won't protect you. What it WILL do is hide your IP address from the web servers you visit, which makes it a good choice for people who only want to hide from anti-piracy lawyers.  It is possible to use PuTTY or another SSH client to create an encrypted tunnel between you and a remote SSH server, and then PuTTY can open a private socks5 proxy on your computer. Then all traffic between you and the SSH server is encrypted. This is probably why there is confusion online about whether socks5 proxies are encrypted."

Yes, I know, both are practically the same thing right now, but the reason GPG is preferred is summed up by that: choice, especially in the context of how you choose to protect yourself. CAs at their best are set-up to be ""here's a key with some settings we've configured, done."""

But if you just want to be safe against your hacker ex-boyfriend or mass surveillance S/MIME might be better because it's easier and wider implemented to clients - and there's no danger of your mum misconfiguring it and attaching the private key to all outgoing mails..."

Simple reason? They don't need to worry about that, but those of us that want to can still communicate with them privately.   there's no danger of your mum misconfiguring it and attaching the private key to all outgoing mails...   There isn't really a chance of that now. All the major key management programs make you bend over backwards just to look at your own private key."

privacy,3desfk,average_human_man,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"PGP and S/MIME use the same encryption algorithms. The difference is in how you verify that a stranger's key really belongs to them. In PGP you have the 'web of trust' where people sign their friends keys, and if a stranger's key has been signed by someone you trust then you can reasonably be sure that their key is trustworthy too. In S/MIME the keys are signed by a commercial certificate authority in the same way as SSL keys we use for websites."
privacy,3df8vt,ishi86,2,Wed Jul 15 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you are asking for, so I'll make assumptions and then answer the assumptions. Correct me if I make the wrong assumption.  There are two broad types of data that can be encrypted: Data in Transit and Data at Rest.  Examples of Data in Transit:   Emails Chat Web Browsing (Data from Web Server to Web Browser)   Examples of Data at Rest:   Files on a Harddrive Files on a USB Pictures on a Phone   Encrypted Data in Transit requires two parties to agree on how to keep it private. There is a ""handshake"" of sorts that exchanges this agreement.  Encrypted Data at Rest requires only one party to know the secret pass.  With your example of https, we have two parties. 1) The web server that serves the web site and has the https certificate and 2) the visitor who uses a web browser to call out to the web site to send the web site data over the internet to the visitor.  The web server and the web browser make a ""handshake"" using the https certificate. If the web server does not have an https certificate, you can't have an encrypted channel.  It's just not set up.  Here's where your question does not make sense. You ask ""What is something that can be similar...but on the browser level not the webpage level?""  The browser and the webpage are on the same level. They're both used to communicate encrypted over https.  So I'll give two answers that fit two different scenarios.  1) If you are worried about cached web sites stored on your own computer being discovered by other people, then you can use Full disk encryption.  Look at LUKS for Linux and Veracrypt for Windows.  2) If you are worried about securing your web traffic in a similar way to https but with sites that don't have https against someone who would snoop on the network level (i.e. ISP or someone at the cafe, etc.), you can use a VPN.  You said ""not a tor client or a proxy"" so perhaps you don't want to use a VPN.  A VPN will create an encrypted tunnel between you and the VPN. This protects internet traffic from being sniffed locally on your WiFi network and from your ISP, but anything past your VPN to a website that does not have an https certificate can be seen. At that point, though, they only see the IP of your VPN.  Assuming your VPN doesn't keep logs or doesn't set up a sniffer, your fine.  Does this answer your question?"

Identity mixer is not about managing accounts, its about proving attributes about yourself in a privacy friendly way. Suppose I want to watch an age 12+ restricted movie and some authority certified that I am over 12. Using identity mixer I can watch that movie while the service provider only learns I'm at least 12 years old. When I watch another 12+ movie, the service provider doesn't know whether I'm a new 12+ year old visitor or a returning one. Use cases like this are not possible with SQRL.

For the layman, there's an inverse relationship between frequency/speed and range. IE: 10Ghz will be faster and shorter range than 500mhz. (Yes yes, I'm simplifying, but I'm talking to a crowd here, give me a break...)  The difference is then range and speed. By going from 2.4Ghz to 900Mhz, we're going from a (theoretical) speed of 54Mbps to a (practical) range of ~10Mbps. That also means more distance though, being able to go from a couple dozen feet (very close) to upwards of two miles in a good environment (much further). Again, there's a lot more to it than that, but that's the short verion.  Aside from pure hardware, the devil's in the (soft) details. Proxyham has the capability to self-destruct when tampered with, using accelerometers to know when things are moving or being 'attacked'. It can use frequency hopping to avoid simple scanners and channel sniffing. It utilizes IPSec to coomunicate transparently from the node (workstation) to the Proxyham itself. We're still working out the kinks you'd expect to see with something like this, but excited to release what we have at Defcon to the open source community."

I suppose I should have been more specific: Now that the concept is out, it's open for other people to tinker with. There isn't any one definitive Piratebox, people build to their needs.  While someone could very well go out and make a Pi-based version to suit a budget, another can build his with strong tamper seals. A third person could add software to mask it's presence along with integrated TOR routing and so on. It can become a very specialized tool with a lot of variance, making countermeasures more difficult to produce.   He specifically mentioned the open source community, so I'm hopeful the concept won't die with his work. Don't get me wrong, it's still a major setback without working code and a list of basic components, but I feel there are a lot of people that are smarter than I that'll be able to make up the lost progress without too much difficulty.

That is different from intelligence gathering though, at least how I define it, as everyone 'gathers intelligence', even me and you individually, it's just the methods we use to get it are morally sound, eg reading a book. It's also kind of a chicken and an egg things in that if one nation is spying so is the other one to protect themselves, so if one doesn't stop neither is the other, so who goes first? What incentive do they have to stop first? This is even more difficult when you're talking about 10's of nations as opposed to two. Either way that doesn't make it morally right though."

Using an apparently minimally-supervised contractor to move a large amount of your most secure internal documents is a breach in and of itself.  The NSA admitted putting a number of security procedures in place after the breach, all of which are the kind of things you would expect an organization like the NSA to have had in the first place. One of those was preventing people doing work like Snowden's from working completely on their own.   I think most people will see that headline the way I read it: somehow NSA exposed the info to the internet, where reporters found it.   The NSA exposed the information to an unsupervised contractor, who put it on the internet.

I'm the first one to be an advocate for open source, but history has shown, because something is open source does not automatically mean it's secure. It means vulnerabilities may be fixed faster.

From Wikipedia:  ""The OpenType font format includes features for associating multiple glyphs to a single character, used for ligature substitution. Typesetting software may or may not implement this feature, even if it is explicitly present in the font's metadata.""  So, I guess some programs don't support rendering them, but no special software is required to use ligatures in a typeface.  Note:  I'm only really familiar with a few web-based typefaces that are built around ligatures and have never really tried to see if they render properly outside of design software and web browsers.

Online surveillance of kids by parents, if taken overboard, is an abusive behavior (a lot of current software for computer surveillance makes it easy to be really intrusive, and a lot of parents don't understand what privacy means on the Internet). The non-abusive way to do this is to bring up things like 'internet porn is not representative of actual relationships' and 'this will be on the Internet in twenty years' - and to make sure that your kids trust you well enough that they'd be willing and able to go to you with any concerns.

To the OP: if you're technically literate, consider installing Little Snitch as well. It's a personal firewall for OS X, and it works fairly well, but can be confusing if you're not very technical. It's also very annoying up front, since you have to whitelist a large number of connections right away.  You should turn on FileVault.

privacy,3cvkvy,Libertyreign,10,Sat Jul 11 15:01:40 2015 UTC,"Cory Doctrow explains the same issue in a really interesting way in Little Brother, which is well worth a read if you're interested in digital privacy-    Say you have a new disease, called Super-AIDS. Only one in a million people gets Super-AIDS. You develop a test for Super-AIDS that's 99 percent accurate. I mean, 99 percent of the time, it gives the correct result -- true if the subject is infected, and false if the subject is healthy. You give the test to a million people.  One in a million people have Super-AIDS. One in a hundred people that you test will generate a ""false positive"" -- the test will say he has Super-AIDS even though he doesn't. That's what ""99 percent accurate"" means: one percent wrong.  What's one percent of one million?  1,000,000/100 = 10,000  One in a million people has Super-AIDS. If you test a million random people, you'll probably only find one case of real Super-AIDS. But your test won't identify one person as having Super-AIDS. It will identify 10,000 people as having it.  Your 99 percent accurate test will perform with 99.99 percent inaccuracy.  That's the paradox of the false positive. When you try to find something really rare, your test's accuracy has to match the rarity of the thing you're looking for. If you're trying to point at a single pixel on your screen, a sharp pencil is a good pointer: the pencil-tip is a lot smaller (more accurate) than the pixels. But a pencil-tip is no good at pointing at a single atom in your screen. For that, you need a pointer -- a test -- that's one atom wide or less at the tip.  This is the paradox of the false positive, and here's how it applies to terrorism:  Terrorists are really rare. In a city of twenty million like New York, there might be one or two terrorists. Maybe ten of them at the outside. 10/20,000,000 = 0.00005 percent. One twenty-thousandth of a percent.  That's pretty rare all right. Now, say you've got some software that can sift through all the bank-records, or toll-pass records, or public transit records, or phone-call records in the city and catch terrorists 99 percent of the time.  In a pool of twenty million people, a 99 percent accurate test will identify two hundred thousand people as being terrorists. But only ten of them are terrorists. To catch ten bad guys, you have to haul in and investigate two hundred thousand innocent people.  Guess what? Terrorism tests aren't anywhere close to 99 percent accurate. More like 60 percent accurate. Even 40 percent accurate, sometimes."
