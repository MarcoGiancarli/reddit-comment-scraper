batman,3e0ieg,foolishfoolyfool,58,Tue Jul 21 00:42:47 2015 UTC,Joker is without question the most fantastic villain of all time  At least in my world
batman,3e0ieg,Rather_Unique1994,18,Tue Jul 21 01:49:36 2015 UTC,"The Joker and Darth Vader fight for first place in my book, but as an adult I appreciate the Joker more."
batman,3e0ieg,JayhawkRacer,11,Tue Jul 21 02:41:21 2015 UTC,"never been a star wars guy.   Batman, Gotham, and it's supervillians have always fascinated me, from childhood all the way to my adulthood now. I've definitely learned how to appreciate characters like the Joker in a deeper, more, eh..... mature way"
batman,3e0ieg,Rather_Unique1994,6,Tue Jul 21 04:18:22 2015 UTC,"Batman for me, is the reference in terms of awesome and diverse villains.  Spiderman wasn't all bad either but Batman is way ahead."
batman,3e0ieg,AverageDude,2,Tue Jul 21 09:18:03 2015 UTC,Spidey has some great villains. But yeah overall Batman has the better ones. But Norman Osborn though. Even when he isn't the Goblin he's just evil. It takes a lot to be a great villain in both personas.
batman,3e0ieg,runnerofshadows,17,Tue Jul 21 12:02:50 2015 UTC,Joker and Randall Flagg for me.
batman,3e0ieg,SgtWasabi,12,Tue Jul 21 16:37:58 2015 UTC,Darth Vader isn't even really a villain.  He changed sides in the end...What kind of villain joins the opposition?  Shenanigans.
batman,3e0ieg,Cal-Drogo,10,Tue Jul 21 14:14:07 2015 UTC,Excuse me?
batman,3e0ieg,vaderdarthvader,15,Tue Jul 21 16:05:55 2015 UTC,Those two are up there. But occasionally Norman Osborn will come close. As well as Dr. Doom.
batman,3e0ieg,runnerofshadows,4,Tue Jul 21 12:01:44 2015 UTC,"What's great about him is that he is technically nothing special, he has no super powers or specially honed skills. Yet he is capable of almost anything simply because he is entirely unpredictable. Then there is the fact that as far as symbolism is concerned, he portrays the exact opposite of every Batman stands for. And his continued existence takes advantage of Batman's greatest strength and greatest weakness, his unwillingness to kill."
batman,3e0ieg,KicksButtson,8,Tue Jul 21 09:57:47 2015 UTC,He's pretty damn smart and has talent as a chemist to make all his Joker gadgets/toxins.
batman,3e0ieg,runnerofshadows,6,Tue Jul 21 12:05:12 2015 UTC,"Depends what ""origin"" you're following.  This sounds like the Killing Joke origin."
batman,3e0ieg,Cal-Drogo,6,Tue Jul 21 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"Magneto would be up here for me but ""villain"" is debatable with him."
batman,3e0ieg,GoldandBlue,6,Tue Jul 21 06:13:00 2015 UTC,Same with Dr. Doom.  Honestly Magneto and Doom are basically anti-heroes some of the time. - especially if Nazis/Red Skull shows up. Because Magneto is Jewish and Doom is Romani
batman,3dy7s6,DaveTheSculptor,210,Mon Jul 20 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"I really hate how Nolan adapted ""normal"" villains like Bane and Joker but didn't bring classic Batman villains like Brainiac to the big screen. Brainiac could have really tied Batman back to his Kryptonian heritage.   Nah, kidding. Very nice work."
batman,3dy7s6,clayton_japes,72,Mon Jul 20 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"HAHA, i figured it'd be kind of a weird place to post it but /r/superman is just such a wasteland."
batman,3dy7s6,clayton_japes,79,Mon Jul 20 15:17:56 2015 UTC,/r/dccomics is pretty healthy. you could put it there too.
batman,3dy7s6,The_Underhanded,46,Mon Jul 20 15:22:24 2015 UTC,that actually makes alot more sense
batman,3dy7s6,ProstetnicVogon,15,Mon Jul 20 15:22:55 2015 UTC,"You should post DC related stuff there. And honestly, I think Batman fans should all head there too, seeing as how most DC stuff is directly related to Batman."

batman,3dy7s6,N67nightmare,5,Tue Jul 21 03:19:50 2015 UTC,classic Batman villains like Brainiac   ...but   could have really tied Batman back to his Kryptonian heritage.    ....I'm confused
batman,3dy7s6,pferdie,7,Tue Jul 21 15:26:41 2015 UTC,"You sure did!  I was actually waiting for the counter-troll of ""Actually, Brainiac mind controlled Batman using nanites so he could take control of Wayne Aerospace and build a rocket in the Superman: TAS episode Knight Time.""  But it never came..."
batman,3dy7s6,Bob49459,39,Mon Jul 20 17:14:22 2015 UTC,"Ha, I love that episode. Superman revealed his greatest power: sounding like kevin conroy."
batman,3dy7s6,pferdie,5,Mon Jul 20 17:23:49 2015 UTC,"It's not quite what one might be looking for, but James Marsters (Spike from Buffy) played Brainiac on Smallville."
batman,3dy7s6,WestenM,2,Mon Jul 20 17:47:05 2015 UTC,James Marsters also did audiobooks for The Dresden Files.
batman,3dy7s6,silverleafnightshade,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:10 2015 UTC,He's a pretty cool dude in general.
batman,3dy7s6,Portugeezer,18,Mon Jul 20 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not an audio book guy, but I love hearing excerpts of his readings of that series, Marsters is fantastic"

batman,3dy7s6,skizmcniz,4,Tue Jul 21 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"No, it counts.  He was a live action Brainiac.  He just wasn't all fancied up like you wanted.  That in no way means he doesn't count.  It's okay to say it wasn't what you wanted.  Seriously.  It's fine.  Nobody would have cared.    But you went and did something silly instead."
batman,3dy7s6,Deakul,-7,Mon Jul 20 15:56:05 2015 UTC,"God Mom, calm down."
batman,3dy7s6,skizmcniz,16,Tue Jul 21 06:07:18 2015 UTC,I think most of us are trying to forget Smallville.
batman,3dy7s6,Deakul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:58:54 2015 UTC,Speak for yourself. I fucking loved Smallville.
batman,3dy7s6,Nickl140,3,Mon Jul 20 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"I like some bits of it, whenever Oliver Queen was around was always a good time.  The Justice League moments were usually alright I suppose.  And season 1 and 2 were good, otherwise, I could do without ever seeing it again.  Especially Lana and her stupid face."
batman,3dy7s6,LoweNorman,0,Mon Jul 20 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"Lana was definitely the low point of the series, but some of the stuff with her and Lex were great. She got annoying fast, but it wasn't enough to make me look down on the series as a whole."
batman,3dy7s6,andamonium,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"It was her coupled with the constant love triangles and sappy CW/WB drama that dragged the series down for me.  It was almost like it was embarrassed to be a comic book show sometimes.  I haven't actually finished the series myself, I stopped around Season 6 or 7 I think."
batman,3dy7s6,metafaze,3,Mon Jul 20 21:58:19 2015 UTC,I think they dragged stuff out too much. They had about 5 seasons of solid material (being a little generous) that was stretched to 10 seasons. But when it did have the payoff moments those episodes were always a lot of fun to watch.
batman,3dy7s6,Portugeezer,28,Mon Jul 20 22:02:01 2015 UTC,and there's this

batman,3dy7s6,blackdraka,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:27 2015 UTC,I'm kinda expecting them to make Brainiac less human to differentiate him from Ulton.  Maybe only have the more human looking version pop out in the final battle.

batman,3dyk8c,DarkStarXero,12,Mon Jul 20 17:35:08 2015 UTC,Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth is one you should check out.
batman,3dyk8c,epikninja123,5,Mon Jul 20 19:09:41 2015 UTC,Came today this
batman,3dyk8c,nowthatsaname,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"All three are considered to be among the best ever written.  TKJ is, without question, the definitive Joker comic.  As for TDKR, I know a lot of people love it, but the art-style stopped me from getting into it."
batman,3dyk8c,Skyrekon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:31 2015 UTC,I think you and I are the only people who think that about TDKR. It's slightly better in the 3rd section but I'm reluctantly pushing thru it.
batman,3dyk8c,shanghainoodle777,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:51 2015 UTC,"I was the same at first. The art really threw me off and stopped me from reading it for a long time, but it grew on me as I read it."
batman,3dyk8c,apbattman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:19 2015 UTC,"Not an uncommon opinion, actually. I feel the same way.  Miller was a great writer, but as an artist he always lacked something for me. He's a broad strokes kind of guy with art, all jagged, dark lines."
batman,3dyk8c,Neveronlyadream,0,Tue Jul 21 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"There are definitely some panels and pages I love, but overall not a huge fan of his art."
batman,3dyk8c,apbattman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:48:23 2015 UTC,"Funny, other than Bill Watterson, Miller is my favorite illustrator, and probably the biggest influence on my own illustrations.  His style is perfect.  I'm the guy who pretty much despises the classic superhero comic style at this point.  I can't get into Marvel at all because I hate the art(or lack of, most of it is so unoriginal and lifeless), and most DC is the same way :("
batman,3dyk8c,eschwa22,5,Tue Jul 21 12:35:33 2015 UTC,What do you think of Capullo?
batman,3dyk8c,apbattman,5,Tue Jul 21 14:43:22 2015 UTC,I dig his B/W work.
batman,3dyk8c,eschwa22,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:03 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of Miller's art and would love to see yoru Miller-esque art as well.
batman,3dyk8c,Doubleeight3XL,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:20 2015 UTC,There are some glorious one page shots of batman that look iconic and beautiful but there are so many sections in it where it's messy and really ugly.  I cam see where you are coming from
batman,3dyk8c,TheFinalJourney,3,Mon Jul 20 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"The art has stopped me from checking it out yet, and I don't know if that's fair. My first round of Batman comics is about to be over soon when I finish hush, so I think I'll end up picking it up at some point. Or maybe trying to find it at a library. But the art just looks so messy."
batman,3dyk8c,KJ_Jeller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:13 2015 UTC,But the art just looks so messy   Thats the best part.  Miller's art has style and energy.  It makes reading most other comics feel so static and dull.
batman,3dyk8c,eschwa22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"If the art puts you off, watch the two part animated film.  You lose some things, but for the most part, its one of the closest adaptions made by DC."

I got interested in the graphic novels recently and ordered TDKR, and Year One on Amazon, they should be here tomorrow.

batman,3dyk8c,cougarboost2517,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:01 2015 UTC,I also ordered the death of the family.
batman,3dyk8c,RufusStJames,4,Mon Jul 20 19:40:53 2015 UTC,Death of the Family was really well done.
batman,3dyk8c,Rather_Unique1994,3,Mon Jul 20 21:57:57 2015 UTC,Haha I got them on Amazon as well. Batman Arkham Knight and the new BvS trailer brought me to buy them.
batman,3dyk8c,Fallout22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:03 2015 UTC,"Same, I started the Arkham games a few months ago (already finished the first 2, I'm halfway through Knight) and have been on a huge Batman craze. I also downloaded the entire Animated Series, amazing stuff. I figured I would continue with the graphic novels."
batman,3dyk8c,Ezra611,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:28:15 2015 UTC,Also give the Knightfall series a go.
batman,3dyk8c,Fallout22,2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the Knightfall series arc was really good, but not necessarily a 1st timers choice."
batman,3dyk8c,mucielagohombre,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think its great for getting into the lore, but it is a little heavy."
batman,3dyk8c,RedWagGT,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:35 2015 UTC,Too bad it's forever and a day long
batman,3dyk8c,thestrugglesreal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:26:10 2015 UTC,Personal opinion you should add Hush to you new collection. Nice Start!
batman,3dyk8c,euchrid3,3,Mon Jul 20 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll say it. I've read a metric shit ton of Batman since I started reading comics and while I'll attest to the validity of most ""best Batman stories"" from 80s Miller to millennial Morrison, Snyder's reinvention to 90s Holiday epics, I think the Killing Joke is the most overrated mediocre story of the bunch. Honestly if it wasn't for the fact that Moore wrote it, people wouldn't hold it in nearly as high regard.  I can't place my finger on exactly what it is about the story that bothered me most; perhaps it's that DC wouldn't let Moore really go all the way whether it was Gordon getting raped (instead she's just photographed and mentally scarred) to her being killed (so her being paralyzed had some cool outcomes like oracle but let's not act like it held any kind of weight compared to Jason's death-which of course had its own problems down the road).  Maybe it's the fact that the pacing feels rushed due to how short it is. At any rate it's just mediocre imo.  /rant   All this being said, most of the best of Batman lists you'll find have good suggestions other than this. Id definitely suggest Black Mirror, Long Halloween/Dark Victory, and the first 3 Snyder new 52 books for sure. Down the road you could add Morrisons run which has its ups and downs but incorporates a lot of integral developments."
batman,3dyk8c,plaidchuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's good, but not essential. It reads like an effort to shock and gross out the reader. Even Moore has distanced himself from it in recent years. I get very frustrated that so many people make it so central to Batgirl's character, when she's not even the main character."
batman,3dyk8c,thestrugglesreal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:17 2015 UTC,imo TKJ gets praised for the sympathetic backstory to the joker and the idea that batman was involved in creating his greatest villain. Other than that it's a standard joker kidnaps someone in the bat family story.
batman,3dyk8c,plaidchuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:22 2015 UTC,See the backstory is the weakest part to me. The man the joker was before was so boring and his being turned into a villain with toxic sludge is so cliche it ruins the image of grandeur I have of the Joker as this epic pervasive enigma.
batman,3dyk8c,shanedalton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair the toxic sludge story was from the kane era so it wasn't even a new idea.   Anywho I basically agree but I think that's what connected with people, and it started the trend of batmans rogues being normal people turned villains via some tragic event.  I don't think moore is the be all end all period honestly. I think Watchmen is incredibly dated now. yes I know superheroes in the real world would be a bunch of flawed sex perverts, hence why they don't exist in the real world."
batman,3dyk8c,jsims20,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"I like Killing Joke, but honestly, I feel that The Man Who Laughs is a much better Joker story.  Hell, I've told Brubaker that personally."
batman,3dyk8c,xAggie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:50 2015 UTC,Definitely a great place to start!  I hope you enjoy (:

batman,3dxk6n,rokthemonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"I came to the conclusion of eye/""the letter I"" as well, homophones.  But envelope makes more sense of ""one letter""."
batman,3dxk6n,BatmanisBW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:08 2015 UTC,You can make the argument that that two E's are sandwiching the Y and thus the Y is the only letter in the word.

batman,3e0ymx,KillerPalm,2,Tue Jul 21 07:59:18 2015 UTC,It's an awful portrayal of batman but I do still quite like it - just have to remind yourself that it's a non-canon piece
batman,3e0ymx,etre-est-savoury,5,Tue Jul 21 08:36:04 2015 UTC,This can not be beaten by any other comic.
batman,3e0ymx,McDave1609,3,Tue Jul 21 18:19:44 2015 UTC,"Right in the middle of Grant Morrison's run there was a four issue story about some hunchback pyromaniac or something that I remember hating. Just boring and lame.  EDIT: also, this isn't comics, but in 2005 there were three or four novels about batman published by different authors and they were all terrible. Bad characterization and lame plots."
batman,3e0ymx,PowerRangersLOL,4,Tue Jul 21 02:58:15 2015 UTC,Grotesk.  That story was lame.  I think they published it to break up Morrison's storyline and make it seem like time had passed after Talia's escape and the next time we see her and Damian.
batman,3e0ymx,Beter_DeLeon,12,Tue Jul 21 04:02:14 2015 UTC,Fortunate Son and Kevin Smith written stories seem to blow. Fortunate Son above all else.

batman,3e0ymx,aco620,0,Tue Jul 21 13:19:28 2015 UTC,"Christian Bale (who is a fantastic actor and was great in the previous movies) as Batman in TDKR.    The suit looks hammy, at this point his voice is practically a parody of itself, and it's just a poor representation of Batman IMO. The Batman I know doesn't give up. He doesn't abandon his city. He doesn't retire in his prime. In the film most of his fighting looks cheesy and poorly choreographed. He barely uses gadgets and the few he does use are limp dick and do nothing. Batman isn't even in the movie for a large chunk of it. Most of his fighting is right out in the open which reduces him to a cheesy looking hero as opposed to being something to be feared, striking from the shadows.    And Batman succumbs to a classic movie cliche. Hero get's his ass kicked by villain, comes back weaker than before, and proceeds to win against the same villain in the exact same fight. It's a cop out and there was nothing creative about it.    All this really isn't Bale's fault in the slightest, he just happened to be the man in the suit."
batman,3e0ymx,The_Naked_Snake,3,Tue Jul 21 04:44:07 2015 UTC,"I think halfway through TDK I started hating his ""Batman voice"" and if you watched Terminator Salvation, he uses that voice at times. I would almost bet the director or someone higher up wanted him to use it."
batman,3e0ymx,darrylchilds,3,Tue Jul 21 05:43:21 2015 UTC,"This is why I dislike the Nolan films as ""Batman movies."" After Begins, they don't really feel like Batman films. They have Batman in them, but he doesn't act like Batman. I love them as movies, but not as Batman movies. The bad thing about this is that casual fans don't realize this and think this is the best representation there is. I've actually had people argue with me about how perfect Bale's Batman was."

batman,3e0ymx,ICReality,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"That's definitely true. I should have explained more though. To me (and to many others I would assume), there are certain core traits (intelligence, detective skills, etc.) which make Batman who he is. In the couple of times I've been argued with, I had casually mentioned that I thought Nolan's films didn't give Batman all of these necessary traits and suffered from it. The other people didn't seem to care that this character was lacking those traits. That's what annoyed me. But hey, like you said, it's just an opinion."
batman,3e0ymx,CobaltMoon98,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:51 2015 UTC,"These comments seem like people who are fans of the movies and animated series. In the comics Batman retires on several occasions. Although it's slightly different, in the current new 52 Bruce Wayne isn't Batman. Commissioner Gordon is Batman. I think sometimes when people watch movies they become blinded by their contempt for the movie. TDKR Batman fits the theme of the movie."

batman,3dv019,non_troppo,6,Sun Jul 19 22:39:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say he was an alright Superman. Like I felt like he nailed the persona pretty well, unlike Cavill in Man of Steel who kind comes across as being like a sociopathic brick in a cape.  What Superman Returns needed was a script that wasn't shit. It had a great director, a pretty great cast, it had a good budget... but that script was just fucking awful.  Honestly? I think if you took Man of Steel's script, but everything else from Superman Returns, you could have had the best Superman movie since 2.  MoS had a pretty... alright script. It was servicable. It just didn't work out well due to poor direction (Snyder's ridiculously hit or miss. He can give you 300 or he can give you Suckerpunch), a mostly poor cast (though I do love Michael Shannon), boring, bland, dead visuals that make everything look completely uninteresting, and a score that makes the whole thing feel more like it wants to be Passion of the Christ than anything."
batman,3dv019,Lord_Vargo-Hoat,5,Sun Jul 19 23:43:57 2015 UTC,Amy Adams is a pretty big reason I don't like MoS. Not a good Lois at all.

batman,3dv019,Baramos_,6,Mon Jul 20 01:23:52 2015 UTC,Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis were good casting choices for their roles. They really messed up with that franchise. They could have done solo features for both characters and possibly salvaged some of that damage.

batman,3dv019,starhawks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:29:02 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's a movie about Green Lantern - a hero who conjures amazingly intricate manifestations with the power of his imagination. Did people think they were going to use scale models painted green or something?  If a live-action movie is predominantly CG, it's going to get complaints because it's too hard to suspend disbelief no matter what. The only way around that is to have the whole movies colour palette dark and gritty to hide the obvious CG (see: MoS), but that wouldn't work in a Green Lantern origins story because he's all about light and hope and whatnot.  Don't get me wrong, I was hugely disappointed with Green Lantern as a movie, but the CG wasn't near the top of my list of complaints."

A good sequel could have saved it, and the sequel they were obviously setting up would have meant a lot more Sinestro, which was the best part of the first one.  I really think they should consider allowing it to be canon, make a sequel, and even if they can't get Ryan or they think he'd be too strongly associated with the competitor's Deadpool, they could introduce John Stewart, Kyle, or even Guy and have all this compatible with Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, Justice League, etc."

batman,3e0jyd,theClutchologist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to think this isn't the case, but something from the trailer makes me think it is possible. At one point Ben says ""20 years in Gotham and how many good guys are left? How many of them stayed good?"". The ""Stayed good"" part implies that some of his allies went rogue or worse at some point. Maybe it's Jason, maybe not"
batman,3e0jyd,gambit700,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:44:20 2015 UTC,Well I'm hoping that Scott Eastwood is actually cast as Dick Grayson in Suicide Squad. His role is still being kept under wraps and that makes me think he's someone important. He was first thought to be Steve Trevor but that was actually denied by the studio I think. I for one love the idea of a Dick Grayson working undercover with the Suicide Squad as a spy for Batman. Or maybe he's already retired Nightwing and is working for the government in some sort of capacity. I have nothing to base this theory on aside from Scott Eastwood looks the part and his role hasn't been identified yet.
batman,3e0jyd,Iam10-32,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"People who think Jason Todd will be in Suicide Squad seem to be in a minority, by far. They saw a torture scene in the phonecam trailer and jumped to conclusions. Perhaps a popular conclusion at the time.  It was kind of settled with the full trailer."
batman,3e0jyd,ARTIFICIAL_SAPIENCE,3,Tue Jul 21 01:08:59 2015 UTC,There's some theory I heard recently that Jared Leto's Joker is Jason Todd.  idk...

batman,3dv9v4,Krypton-115,22,Sun Jul 19 21:30:23 2015 UTC,what I like about him as a villain is that he simply is a hardcore Batman. Makes him sort of a villain to Batman but not a villain to others.

He still shoots people.  And maybe this has changed since I last read some Red Hood stuff, but last I checked it wasn't unheard of for him to kill people still.  How exactly does Batman tolerate this guy on his staff?"

batman,3dv9v4,Krypton-115,75,Tue Jul 21 08:39:42 2015 UTC,"Hate is an understatement.   I've always been on Jason Todd's side, Batman's moral compass is all sorts of fucked up."
batman,3dv9v4,AVeryWittyUsername,53,Sun Jul 19 21:21:01 2015 UTC,"I'd kill, but I'll also defend Batman not killing. I can give the why's and I get it, but I personally would."
batman,3dv9v4,AVeryWittyUsername,46,Sun Jul 19 21:30:43 2015 UTC,"Most of the time not killing makes sense, but not for people like Joker. He clearly can't be contained forever, and he kills all the time. Why is his life more valuable than every one of his inevitable victims?"
batman,3dv9v4,dakak36,56,Sun Jul 19 21:38:32 2015 UTC,"One thing you have to keep in mind is that this is a comic, and that in real life the Joker wouldn't keep escaping from jail and that the writers don't want to kill the joker because they want him around as a character.  Batman is also meant to be an incorruptible force of good and the Joker an unsalvageable force of evil, so for either cross the line to the other side in any capacity goes against the main themes of the series."
batman,3dv9v4,N67nightmare,10,Sun Jul 19 21:58:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's the opposite. Batman is a very corruptible force of justice, or so he thinks. Under the red hood put it best that the moment he takes a life, that's it. He doesn't trust himself not to become something maybe worse than the joker.  The joker knows what he does is wrong, but Batman would kill in the name of justice, which can be infinite more dangerous. Where does it stop? With psychopaths? Any supervillain? Muggers? And what if he expands to foreign dictators and despots, since they deserve death far more than those petty thieves he killed a week ago... hell, a nuke would take care of them and their supporters, even if a few innocents would be lost too.  This is what Batman fears, becoming something far worse than what he fights. Personally I think he'd become something worse than he is, although not a world countering monster. Bruce is a good man, even if he tries to deny it and even if he makes the wrong choice sometimes. Plus, there's always his ultimate contigency plan: the justice league."
batman,3dv9v4,runnerofshadows,5,Mon Jul 20 18:15:48 2015 UTC,And it's because of this that he tries to stop Superman in the Injustice universe - because he knows the path Supes was taking would lead to the sort of dictatorship that happened.
batman,3dv9v4,silverleafnightshade,43,Mon Jul 20 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"Because Batman is mentally ill.  The death of his parents led to a hugely solitary childhood.  All he did was sit and remember how his parents died.  Eventually, he developed a huge psychological aversion to killing.  He basically brainwashed himself.  All he wants to do is kill people like the Joker but he never can.  He has a massive mental block stopping him.  All that business about morality is just a way to justify not doing what he knows needs to be done.  Over the years, Batman has become darker because the knowledge that the Joker's kills are his fault is pushing him farther and farther over the edge.  Batman is, and always has been, mentally ill."
batman,3dv9v4,antieverything,6,Mon Jul 20 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"Ever since the Morrison run he's been written as a man who has more or less conquered his demons. I loved the comics where Batman and Bruce Wayne are seperate, sometimes clashing, personalities but the logic nowadays is that since he's had so much time to devote to disciplining his body and mind through rigorous training and meditation, he has been able to overcome his emotional trauma."
batman,3dv9v4,AVeryWittyUsername,7,Mon Jul 20 04:12:33 2015 UTC,"If course he's a bit loco. He dresses like a Bat and scares people in his spare time.   That's another thing I've had a problem with, especially in the new Arkham game, everyone finds out that this loon has a tank that can practically wreck the city by itself and nobody questions it. Gotham is way too cool with having Batman roaming around, at the end of the day he is a man that can decide to destroy everything if he has a bad day. I'm sure Bruce has done more bad than good for Gotham."
batman,3dv9v4,Neveronlyadream,14,Mon Jul 20 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"I get that. Remember that line about Caesar in The Dark Knight?  Gotham is a hellhole. People are scared. The police are corrupt and ineffective. People see the Batman and decide he can take care of what needs taking care of, so they don't question him because they think they could never be in his line of fire.  It's the same problem with Superman and a lot of other superheroes. But people get complacent and they just let it happen because it benefits them at the time. It's not as unrealistic as you'd think."
batman,3dv9v4,AnamTuirseach,11,Mon Jul 20 02:21:05 2015 UTC,"Well there is also the fact that it isn't his choice to make. Why would Gotham let Joker be committed? After all he has done and how often he escapes custody, you would expect that they'd decide he was worth execution. (Assuming Gotham is in New Jersey then as of 2007 you would need a legislative exception, but still, you'd kill the mass murderer rather than let him escape to continue his murder spree.)"
batman,3dv9v4,Neveronlyadream,16,Sun Jul 19 22:35:04 2015 UTC,"This has always been my question. I get Batman not killing. He's worried about the whole slippery slope thing. That's fine.  But why has no judge or jury ever decided that Joker needed to be executed? Time after time he gets out of Arkham where he's supposed to be rehabilitated and causes havoc. They can't possibly be so progressive, naive, and liberal that they still think he can be reformed.  In the end, it's not Batman's job to kill the Joker. It's Gotham's and Gotham has been dropping the ball for decades."
batman,3dv9v4,sonofaresiii,9,Mon Jul 20 02:18:40 2015 UTC,"Real answer? Because he's deemed insane. You don't convict the mentally ill if they've been deemed incapable of the mental capacity to understand the consequences of their actions.  So the death penalty has never been on the table. Joker always gets committed.  In fact, there was one arc where, I think it was a new DA who wanted to make a splash-- who insisted they not seek an insanity defense (backroom deal or something).  The Joker was convicted and given the death sentence... and they almost went through with it, until the last minute when Batman proved the Joker's innocence of the crime and he was sent back to Arkham"
batman,3dv9v4,Neveronlyadream,5,Mon Jul 20 04:49:57 2015 UTC,"Fair, but an insanity defense is really hard to pull off. You have to prove that the defendant didn't know the difference between right and wrong. Which doesn't really apply to the Joker. He's not psychotic, he's not delusional. He just doesn't care.  I think that was an issue of the writers not understanding how the law works, because there's no way Joker would ever be considered insane in that instance. It's like the difference between Jeffrey Dahmer and John Hinckley Jr. The former could be considered insane, a necrophiliac, cannibal serial killer. But he was in prison because he was well aware of his actions. The latter was put into an institution because he was so delusional, he thought he could win Jodie Foster's love."
batman,3dv9v4,sonofaresiii,4,Mon Jul 20 04:55:48 2015 UTC,"Fair, but an insanity defense is really hard to pull off.   Absolutely. And the joker is really insane.   Which doesn't really apply to the Joker.  I think that was an issue of the writers not understanding how the law works,   Maybe in the beginning, but I've seen issues where they've brought in therapists who evaluate him to determine whether he's sane. They've all deemed his completely insane and needing treatment at Arkham."
batman,3dv9v4,Neveronlyadream,3,Mon Jul 20 05:03:29 2015 UTC,"I guess. But I don't buy it. Everything the Joker does, he does intentionally to hurt. He's aware of his actions and their consequences.  Is he insane? Medically, absolutely. Legally, probably not. There's no doubt he's insane, but in a court of law, his lawyer would have to prove that he wasn't aware that his actions were bad or wrong. Legitimately unaware. And it would never work. There's no judge or jury in Gotham that would let that slip by."
batman,3dv9v4,platoprime,4,Mon Jul 20 05:10:40 2015 UTC,"Bottom line, he can't be killed for the sake of needing more stories."
batman,3dv9v4,Neveronlyadream,6,Mon Jul 20 03:50:24 2015 UTC,That's the real truth; they can't replace the joker so they don't kill the joker.
batman,3dv9v4,machukellow,4,Mon Jul 20 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. Obviously.  I'd just once like to see it brought up in-story though. We rarely ever even hear of Joker on trial. The only time that's coming to me is in Kingdom Come.  All they'd have to say is that Gotham doesn't have the death penalty. Or that Joker intimidated the best lawyer in the city to represent him. Something that stops us from wondering why he never gets the death penalty."
batman,3dv9v4,runnerofshadows,3,Mon Jul 20 04:38:41 2015 UTC,"I am 100% behind you. It is not Batman's responsibility or place to kill. In order to stay on the side of the law, he needs to let the system at least attempt to do its job, whether it fails or not."
batman,3dv9v4,rokudaimehokage,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:24 2015 UTC,"That and Joker has to be extremely lucky. You'd think with all the falls, times he's been shot at, etc. he would have died by now."
batman,3dv9v4,BroncoBuckeye,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:24 2015 UTC,You'd think the courts would demand his execution at some point.
batman,3dv9v4,XMenOrangesTangerine,2,Mon Jul 20 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"This is why I like Superman. Killing is never his first course if action, but if he needs to, he will."

batman,3dv9v4,Krypton-115,3,Mon Jul 20 02:05:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd definitely be what's considered an anti-hero.

Apparently, Bruce fired Dickbecause of cowardice. So in the Earth 31 universe I assume Grayson never became Nightwing. Even in the talk with Gordon he tells him, you know I haven't. ..when Jim mentions Dick. It is odd how Miller dislikes Dick, but it makes sense for him to praise Jason. He loves violence,honestly I feel Miller could of written Red Hood so well if he wasn't as crazy as he is now."

That's what I loved about Conroy. He uses his Bruce Wayne voice when talking to us (the player). Also when talking to Alfred, he uses a firm and loud voice (different from the narrating voice)."
batman,3dvatk,HotBreadKitchen,10,Mon Jul 20 12:08:01 2015 UTC,"The way Conroy changes his voice between Bruce and Batman is subtle, but way more effective than bale's voice."
batman,3dvatk,RadicalFire,4,Mon Jul 20 14:45:47 2015 UTC,I also liked how in the DCAU as Bruce became more consumed by Batman he used the Bat-Voice more and more until it's the only voice he uses in Beyond for the most part.
batman,3dvatk,runnerofshadows,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:41 2015 UTC,Oh you're right! In TNBA he uses the Bruce voice less and in Beyond he uses that Batman voice all the time. I believe the deep Batman voice is his natural voice and the Bruce Wayne Voice was altered. Thanks for bringing up that point.
batman,3dvatk,RadicalFire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:39 2015 UTC,"I think Bale should never be a voice actor full-time unless its for a very simple project. Nothing as demanding as voicing Batman.  In saying that, i did love his voice in Begins. I like 99% of the ""artistic"" choices Nolan makes but the voice (in TDK) isn't one of them. Though, myself and like millions of other people overlooked that cause his movies were fantastic."

batman,3dvatk,runnerofshadows,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:44 2015 UTC,I did not make that connection until just now. I wonder if we can fit Aaron Paul in somewhere - maybe as Jim Jr.?
batman,3dvatk,YodaFan465,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:28 2015 UTC,Imagine if they had Bryan Cranston as Gordon too. It'd be almost the reverse of Breaking Bad - with Paul being the sociopathic villain.
batman,3dvatk,runnerofshadows,5,Mon Jul 20 19:27:07 2015 UTC,I thought Jonathan Banks wasn't a great Gordon -- a little too dispassionate for my taste. I'd much prefer Bryan Cranston to come back and finally act alongside Conroy and Hamill! Not to mention he said he'd love to reprise the role for another good story.
batman,3dvatk,alperisrisen,2,Tue Jul 21 00:53:42 2015 UTC,I'd love it if they could afford Bryan Cranston as Gordon again. He was the best part of Year one. Other than that go TAS actors all the way.

batman,3dw8f2,runnerofshadows,5,Mon Jul 20 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"That always bothers me, that Alfred and Bruce refer to each other by name when people can clearly hear them, or at least hear Batman. In Arkham Knight they use the video communications though which allows anybody nearby to hear Alfred say ""Master Bruce"".   In fact there's one scene where Batman and Nightwing take on a bunch of Penguins men and at the end, in plain view of everyone they just fought, Nightwing calls him Bruce. It's like they forgot that they didn't actually kill these guys."

batman,3du71z,AVeryWittyUsername,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:20:09 2015 UTC,Those are my two least favorite. Tim is honestly just so random and their is very little reason for him to be Robin in the first place. Damien annoys the hell out of me. So did Jason but they used that to make a great story arc and new character.  The son of batman movie was also not good.
batman,3du71z,Conan1423,5,Sun Jul 19 23:38:18 2015 UTC,"You must not be reading the same characters. Tim witnessed the flying Grayson's deaths and figured out Batman and the original Robin's identities before convincing Alfred, Grayson(Nightwing at the time) and finally Batman that Batman always needs a Robin. Now I've no clue how much of that has been changed or rewritten cometely post New 52, but Tim was my favorite Robin for a long time. He didn't have to be Robin, wasn't driven by revenge (although his folks did go through the ringer before being killed separately), he simply felt he had a responsibility to use his skills for good and keep Batman from being too dark and cold. Damien, my current favorite Robin, is amazing. If you can't appreciate Wayne and Talia's son raised by Ras al Ghul to take over the world who decides he'd rather follow in Batman's footsteps, then I got nothing. To each their own."
batman,3du71z,swiftlikessharpthing,3,Sun Jul 19 23:54:12 2015 UTC,"You couldn't have said it better. Sure, Damian's a little shit sometimes, but he's a great character. As is Tim."

batman,3du71z,AVeryWittyUsername,2,Mon Jul 20 00:57:57 2015 UTC,I'm very aware of Tim's origin. Tim claims batman NEEDS a Robin to maintain his sanity but I don't believe that. I always thought batman should retire the Robin mantle after his Jason's death since he views it as his biggest failure. And Tim just being motivated to fight crime just because he wanted to his a little boring to me. With superheroes I like a good back story that makes is seen plausible why they became said hero. That's why Tim feels random and forced to me. Like the writers felt obligated to make another Robin when their was no need
batman,3du71z,Conan1423,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:49:58 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I'm much more in the Batman needs a Robin camp. And sorry if I came off some kinda way in the abovementioned post.

batman,3dz2uv,GuntherTime,0,Tue Jul 21 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"Part of this possibility, imo, is studios don't do the traditional stories. There are always new spins. Jason wanting to be a hero is again, just one version of the outcome where many are possible. See Jason being captured as the end of one chapter and how he comes out the start of another. Joker already proved he can turn people into Jokers. If Jason became a joker it wouldn't be out of admiration. It would be because he lost his mind."
batman,3dz2uv,theClutchologist,2,Tue Jul 21 03:42:50 2015 UTC,While true but joker has his own process of that. Beating someone with a crowbar and blowing them up is not one. When he did it to Robin and when he attempted it on Gordon he focuses on the mind alone the pain is minimal. Because he became the joker because of one bad day and so he creates a personal bad day to create another him.
batman,3dz2uv,GuntherTime,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:44 2015 UTC,Why is it assumed red hood will be in the dccu? Just because a robin is dead?

Other than that the only advantages to getting the PS4 version are the Scarecrow challenges and the extra skins.

Those voices were definitive for me (still are). There are some people who think of Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman, it kinda all depends on what you grew up on.   When Arkham Asylum came out and I found out Conroy and Hamill were doing their voices again, I was infinitely more excited to play the game.  I'll admit Conroy's performance in Arkham Knight feels a bit more stretched. Perhaps it's just that he's getting older, but personally I enjoyed it nonetheless."
batman,3dxvv1,N67nightmare,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"I think it was the voice direction, personally. A lot of moments felt stiff, but I blame that on them basically being narration (talking to alfred, actually narrating to tell the player what to do next). Some lines obviously just needed a retake, but others just floored me with how awesome they came out(that one interrogation was awesome, along with everything from the abandoned mall onward and that one moment with barbara that I'm sure you know what I mean had some of the most fear and panic Conroy's ever done as batman.) I feel like conroy did an over all more subtle approach with moments of extreme emotion , which fits the characterization in the arkham games.  Over all I feel like knight had the highest points and the lowest points of any game in the series across the board. Some scenes were amazing, others meh. Most of the gameplay was excellent, but then there was the over reliance on tank battles. A lot of the voice acting was amazing, some parts fell flat. Over all, it's probably my GOTY since it still  hit all the right buttons for me."

batman,3dx42n,TriForce64,3,Mon Jul 20 06:51:34 2015 UTC,"It's somewhat difficult to explain without spoilers, but I will say that the actual game mechanics are good while the story has left some a little lukewarm.  Traversal (grappling,gliding) has never been better, and it is actually really fun to just cruise around the skies.   The combat feels sharp and quick, and Batman punches guys who are on the ground now so no more losing the combo with an accidental punch as a guy goes down. In my opinion they stepped the enemy types up in an unsatisfactory way, and it makes combat less fun initially, but once you learn the types it's fine. If you hate the shock baton guys from AC/AO then prepare yourself because there's plenty of electricity in this one.   The Batmobile took a bit of getting used to, and the default control scheme was not my cup of tea but it can be changed to suit different tates. Sometimes it can feel a little loose but also a little ""sticky"" at times but with practice it becomes really fun to blast around the city and drift corners.   You will absolutely have to cut the car some slack in relation to the way the ""shock buffer"" works, because you'll be hitting/running over guys left and right while still needing to believe that they're just incapacitated. That's obviously just a necessity of the game design and there wasn't really a way around it, but it is a little goofy at times.   Tank/battle mode is smooth and easily maneuverable, though the armament can feel a little lacking, and the main gun is pretty slow while the secondary gun doesn't do much damage.   Overall I think the bones of the game are good, but the larger omissions are still glaring. The lack of the traditional challenge mode has really put a ding in the replayability, and the dual play feature isn't as widely implemented as many would like.   I think it's absolutely worth playing/buying/owning, and there are worse games out there that you could be playing. I really think time will tell if this ends up as the final game or if we'll see if Warner Brothers Montreal try to continue the franchise."

You mean there's a bad learning curve? I hadn't considered that, but I could definitely see that. Either way, it is really nice that they varied enemy types a lot more from the other games.  I also forgot to put it in my response, but I agree with you about the lack of a real challenge mode. That's one of my hopes for DLC.  Not that that should be DLC, but it's better than nothing."

batman,3dx42n,grntplmr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:02 2015 UTC,I give it an A.
batman,3dx42n,KTheOneTrueKing,0,Tue Jul 21 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"It is a very good game, but as a veteran of all previous games I found the core experience nice but not challenging (I play on hard) and on some point I stopped upgrading and just stacked upgrade points. To counter that, I did not like the way that the batmobile was forced into the gameplay and I found it cumbersome and just  waste of time.  The storyline is nice, but quite obvious if you know some of Batman's lore from the comics, still - its fun.  To sum it up, Arkham Knight is like a new flavor from Ben & Jerry's, Its very well made and enjoyable, but essentially they just added nuts & pretzels."
batman,3dx42n,Barnabas2109,0,Mon Jul 20 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it a lot, but I am a huge fan of the Arkham series as it is. I enjoy Origins a lot, too, and a lot of people didn't like it. So bear that in mind.  The combat is wonderful, and they even found ways to make the combat more dynamic from the other games, with more enemy types and move possibilities. One of my favorite things is that Batman can now pick up the blunt weapons that his enemies drop and use them for a bit. So you can be Batman with a bat, which is just the silliest but most fun thing ever. In any case, the combat was already really polished in City and Origins, so I was really impressed on how they punched it up. Plus, you get to fight with your allies, which is really fun.   There's a few new tricks in predator mode, too, and that's fun. But there's not as many predator encounters as I would have liked, and several of the predator encounters were in areas that were a lot harder to treat with stealth than the more traditional layouts of the other games. While this is a new challenge and that's great, it made me want just a few more spots where it was an enclosed room with inexplicable indoor gargoyles to make me feel really powerful. That's really a non-complaint.  The Batmobile takes some getting used to, but once you're there, it's a lot of fun. the races especially can be awesome Some people will tell you that they require you to use it too much, and I think that's a fair complaint, but it didn't detract from the experience for me. Tank battles are fun, if unvaried and numerous. Using the Batmobile in puzzles can be both frustrating and interesting. really, the Batmobile is a matter of preference for a lot of players. I liked it, others didn't.  There is a lack of boss battles, and most of the boss battles you have are tank fights. So that's annoying. But I'd really rather have a lack of boss battles than the terrible boss battles of Asylum. (There's actually a lot of irony in that the Scarecrow fights were one of the best parts of the first game, and they just kind of forget about them in Knight.)  Story-wise, I liked it. The ending especially. Pretty much everything  from the big reveal to the very end is explosive, and merges the story and gameplay well. There's also inclusion of some villains that you wouldn't expect, and that was cool. But, you might also feel a lack of other villains that you wish had shown up.  All-in-all, I really liked it. City is still probably the best of the series, but Knight is certainly worth it. I highly recommend it once you can actually play it."
batman,3dx42n,pferdie,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:35:28 2015 UTC,"I thought it was really good, but not amazing. I had some problems with it. It's not the way I wanted the series to end. But the overall experience is still worth it."

batman,3dqh4v,InkognitoV,38,Sat Jul 18 21:49:15 2015 UTC,Troy Baker is pretty much the same as Mark Hamill.  I didn't even know it wasn't Mark Hamill playing the games.
batman,3dqh4v,FartDrunkLove,55,Sat Jul 18 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"It was Mark Hamill in Arkham Asylum, Arkham City and Arkham Knight"
batman,3dqh4v,IvyLeagueZombies,23,Sat Jul 18 17:58:33 2015 UTC,Baker has only been Joker... I wanna say twice? Origins and Assault on Arkham.
batman,3dqh4v,cole1114,9,Sat Jul 18 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"His ability to mimic Mark Hamill's Joker is out of this world, though. That's some serious talent."
batman,3dqh4v,Singulaire,24,Sun Jul 19 03:34:53 2015 UTC,It was only Troy Baker in origins. And I could tell immediately it wasn't mark Hamill. Troy's voice was good for a young joker but it didn't have the same gruff that comes naturally to mark hamill
batman,3dqh4v,maxjp17,10,Sat Jul 18 20:36:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah they asked him to be as close to Hamill as they could, would love to see what would happen if he was allowed to do his own interpretation."
batman,3dqh4v,Stunsthename,8,Sat Jul 18 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"Thing is, it was a prequel to the other Arkham Games, and it would be kind of weird to have a completely different voice for the characters in the same universe."
batman,3dqh4v,DrArielicious,4,Sun Jul 19 01:20:15 2015 UTC,I know I just meant I'd like to see him do his own interpretation in something else.

batman,3dqh4v,GaySkull,31,Sat Jul 18 16:44:01 2015 UTC,I always thought Dimaggio would have done a much bettter Sionis. He sounded far too gangster. I need more controlled hysteria in my Jokers.
batman,3dqh4v,hobo_shinobi,5,Sat Jul 18 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"It might be because it's such a different sounding Joker,  DiMaggio is my second favorite only because I grew up with Hamill."

batman,3dqh4v,TemporalGrid,18,Sat Jul 18 15:24:35 2015 UTC,Can you go into more detail? I haven't heard that one.
batman,3dqh4v,Warbird_7,99,Sat Jul 18 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"Most people will think that Batman snapped Joker's neck during the fight, but Batman just cripples him: the Joker moves his head and, essentially, snaps his own neck to make it look like Batman killed him."
batman,3dqh4v,vjmurphy,67,Sat Jul 18 16:43:34 2015 UTC,It's a lot more obvious in the animated movie.
batman,3dqh4v,ZeroXNova,32,Sat Jul 18 16:50:49 2015 UTC,I blame the comic. If i'm correct there's a panel that literally looks like Batman snapped his neck as they're fighting. I think I had to look back over it several times because I was confused.
batman,3dqh4v,TheJoshider10,58,Sat Jul 18 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"It doesn't just look like it, Batman does do it, but only so far as to give Joker full-body paralysis. The Joker obviously sees this as a copout, and mocks batman for it until he bursts into joker laughter and twists his own neck to finish the job. https://i.imgur.com/ezXWSpE.jpg  It's a really dark and potent scene, it saddens me that so many readers apparently don't understand it."
batman,3dqh4v,GrimBrunn,15,Sat Jul 18 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"but only so far as to give Joker full-body paralysis.   This is my issue then. After seeing it in movies so much where it's pretty much an instant death, it didn't click that it can be used as anything other than an way to kill someone."
batman,3dqh4v,TheJoshider10,11,Sat Jul 18 18:18:06 2015 UTC,To be fair anyone other than the bat would have difficulty.
batman,3dqh4v,MrMumble,12,Sat Jul 18 19:21:35 2015 UTC,"The only reason I could see that those people are correct is that the style of Jokers speech bubble changes to a style similar to one Miller used for Batman. I think it could be interpreted either way.   Some days I read that passage one way, some days I'll read it the other. If I have to pick motivations, I'd like them to be multiple choice."
batman,3dqh4v,EpcotMaelstrom,52,Sat Jul 18 21:31:40 2015 UTC,"There is, but the joker was still talking with batman before he twisted his own neck to kill himself. I thought it very obvious when i read it."
batman,3dqh4v,darkwingduck97,8,Sat Jul 18 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"That's why I was confused. The panel didn't seem to match up with events so I was like ""huh"" and looked over it to see if he did snap his neck or not. Still looks that way even after looking back at it to be fair."
batman,3dqh4v,TheJoshider10,12,Sat Jul 18 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"It's VERY obvious in the comic. That panel haunted my dreams for a week, truly amazing. The point is that Batman wanted to kill him. So The Joker effectively won."
batman,3dqh4v,Cosmodious,5,Sat Jul 18 20:45:09 2015 UTC,I thought TDK was going nuts and imagined a conversation with the jokers corpse
batman,3dqh4v,Tedwardy,2,Sat Jul 18 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"I remember this bit, but for the life of me thought it was Killing Joke, not TDKR..."
batman,3dqh4v,Audiovore,4,Sat Jul 18 19:29:03 2015 UTC,Is that even possible?
batman,3dqh4v,Core_i9,12,Sat Jul 18 19:28:11 2015 UTC,"Actually a lot of neck injuries that wouldn't kill/cripple end up exacerbated when the person, usually confused and in shock, moves around. Sitting up, standing or walking."
batman,3dqh4v,ImpossibleKintsugi,4,Sat Jul 18 19:58:42 2015 UTC,"Had to correct a friend about this too, wonder why it's such a common misconception. It seemed clear when I read it."
batman,3dqh4v,MrKimimaru,6,Sat Jul 18 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty forced. Or rather, then a lot of other incarnations are politicians as well.  I really don't care for this format, but if we want to define each one with one trait, then TDKR Joker should be something like ""the old foe"" or something like that.  Really, though, these definitions are just arbitrary and a tad silly."
batman,3dqh4v,A_Dog_Chasing_Cars,4,Sat Jul 18 22:31:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I know it's not that accurate but what do you expect when someone describes a character with one or two words? Two words isn't enough to describe the complexities of any character let alone a character as flawed and complex as the Joker

batman,3dqh4v,fzw,5,Sat Jul 18 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"""I can't believe you're an educator, Brian."""
batman,3dqh4v,loki1887,62,Sat Jul 18 19:08:24 2015 UTC,I actually like the Kevin Micheal Richardson joker
batman,3dqh4v,k0fi96,30,Sat Jul 18 15:32:54 2015 UTC,"I used to love that show and I don't think it gets enough credit on this sub. I always appreciate when they do something new with a character. I've seen Mark Hamill's Joker countless times, so why not see something completely different?"
batman,3dqh4v,PM_Me_Clavicle_Pics,11,Sat Jul 18 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"I hated The Batman because it immediately followed the best run of Batman comics ""for kids"" probably ever, where every villain had a reason, which both humanized them and created a defining context for the Joker because he was the one who didn't. In The Batman every villain from Mr. Freeze to Clayface was some wacked out psycho trying to steal a bunch of money in an inexplicably public fashion, all drawn in a really extreme art style that I'm sure some liked, but I did not. I only saw the comics but that was where my subscription ended because I just could not stand it."
batman,3dqh4v,Dharmasabitch,12,Sat Jul 18 19:31:01 2015 UTC,"I just liked that it tried something new. It seems like a lot of fans of comic books and superheroes prefer what they refer to as ""the true version"" of their favorite characters, but how can there be a single version if these stories have been told and retold for 75 years now? Innovation is what keeps the genre and its characters from becoming stagnant, and we can't be afraid to try new things. Otherwise, we'll never discover anything new."
batman,3dqh4v,PM_Me_Clavicle_Pics,4,Sat Jul 18 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"That's fair, but I'm not even sure if I would call BTAS and the following comics/shows from the same universe ""the true version"", at least they weren't always. For example, Harley Quinn was invented in that universe, and I'm pretty sure the main universe stole the backstory for Mr. Freeze from BTAS-era comics. I think there was plenty of innovation, it was just focused on humanizing villains and emphasizing Batman's tortured relationship with the concept of family. I just didn't see innovation that I liked in The Batman, but I recognize that maybe if I had given it more of a chance or grown up with it I would feel differently."
batman,3dqh4v,Dharmasabitch,18,Sat Jul 18 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, ""The Batman"" did absolutely nothing for me."
batman,3dqh4v,RickRussellTX,20,Sat Jul 18 15:46:10 2015 UTC,It was ok. As a follow-up to BATS and BB it looks even worse. The Riddler in The Batman was horribly dated. A 90s goth in a mid 00s show. I do think they did a good job having lesser used villians.
batman,3dqh4v,deviger,6,Sat Jul 18 16:19:13 2015 UTC,Killer croc was pretty cool in the show but at the end of the it is obvious the show was made to sell toys and judging by how many seasons it got they did a pretty good job at that
batman,3dqh4v,k0fi96,3,Sat Jul 18 17:53:22 2015 UTC,I only watched the first two seasons. I missed when they added Robin and Batgirl. I'm not really inclined to go back and watch more either.
batman,3dqh4v,deviger,2,Sat Jul 18 18:24:50 2015 UTC,The whole thing is hit or miss some episodes are really good and some are cringe worthy
batman,3dqh4v,k0fi96,11,Sat Jul 18 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"Batman The Brave And The Bold is definitely where it's at when you want a more ""current"" fix of Batman Animation.  There was a CG series that followed it shortly after. The less said about that the better..."
batman,3dqh4v,skipjimroo,12,Sat Jul 18 17:02:23 2015 UTC,However the Green Lantern CG show was awesome.
batman,3dqh4v,Peculiar_One,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:05:02 2015 UTC,I loved what I saw of it. Sadly it was only on for a couple of months in the UK before it was pulled!
batman,3dqh4v,skipjimroo,3,Sat Jul 18 17:11:54 2015 UTC,The entire series (1 season) was on Netflix. It's how I saw it.
batman,3dqh4v,Peculiar_One,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:20 2015 UTC,Got cancelled here pretty quick too. (US)
batman,3dqh4v,somekid66,8,Sat Jul 18 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"Wait...Beware the Batman was great, is that not the hive-mindset here? It had an identity problem, forsure (was it for kids or was it for adults?!) but it incorporated a ton of villains that never get any love outside the comics."
batman,3dqh4v,B34tsbyDave,5,Sat Jul 18 17:57:53 2015 UTC,I really liked Beware the Batman.
batman,3dqh4v,concretin,3,Sat Jul 18 19:06:30 2015 UTC,The CG Batman series is better than THE Batman.
batman,3dqh4v,Kevinmld,3,Sat Jul 18 20:40:04 2015 UTC,Beware Beware The Batman
batman,3dqh4v,deviger,11,Sat Jul 18 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"As someone who was born kind of late, that Batman and Joker was my first entry into the world of Batman. Absolutely loved that show as a kid."
batman,3dqh4v,HowieGaming,9,Sat Jul 18 16:33:11 2015 UTC,"Born late? Come on pal, you were just born."
batman,3dqh4v,Grimlock69,2,Sat Jul 18 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"Me too, but I know the man in real life and that is the only reason I watched the show."
batman,3dqh4v,Simplexis,76,Sat Jul 18 15:59:43 2015 UTC,"I always thought Brent Spiner's Joker was my least favorite interpretation of the Joker. That was the one character interpretation of Young Justice I actually thought felt wrong.  Even the ""demented hobo"" seemed a little more fitting.  Also, I think the Brave and the Bold Joker was a fun take on it. Very different from what we're used to, and I think he's a little underrated."
batman,3dqh4v,That_Batman,42,Sat Jul 18 15:41:31 2015 UTC,definitely. Young justice joker is just horrible
batman,3dqh4v,venomousbeetle,12,Sat Jul 18 15:43:40 2015 UTC,I really didnt like how he just came off as a tool.  too minor of a roll for such a great villain.  too easily shut down and outsmarted.
batman,3dqh4v,Corsair176,17,Sat Jul 18 20:30:43 2015 UTC,"I always thought Brent Spiner's Joker was my least favorite interpretation of the Joker.    I thought he did a yeoman's job, with a bit of the ultraviolence.   Brave and the Bold Joker was a fun take on it   It's the Joker with the tone and mannerisms of a nightclub comedian."
batman,3dqh4v,RickRussellTX,5,Sat Jul 18 15:47:48 2015 UTC,Brave and the bold joker managed to be a bit threatening and a killer despite the camp. Also got the only adaptation of emperor joker.
batman,3dqh4v,runnerofshadows,4,Sat Jul 18 18:45:33 2015 UTC,The fact that I didn't know it was Brent Spiner until now tells me something.
batman,3dqh4v,huanthewolfhound,3,Sat Jul 18 18:32:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think the fact young justice was so good makes that interpretation of the joker look even worse by comparison."
batman,3dqh4v,nodogfoodforvictor,2,Sat Jul 18 20:16:56 2015 UTC,"One part I did like is when he makes fun of Dr. Fate's super serious 'Wo-tan (or whatever it is), you are mine!' When he says to Robin, ""Wonder boy, you are mine!'"
batman,3dqh4v,Graxdon,3,Sun Jul 19 03:51:11 2015 UTC,"Had he been given a bigger part or better lines (especially his own episode or arc) I think he would have done much better. He was a subdued, subtle Joker that would have done well in a darker, deeper, more manipulative show.  The main problem was that his Joker was fundamentally different to the rest of the show. Young Justice was more of a high-energy, high-action feel."
batman,3dqh4v,HeirToGallifrey,19,Sat Jul 18 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"If we're getting into all the various voice actors, let's not forget...  Michael McKean: The Throwback"
batman,3dqh4v,basiamille,10,Sat Jul 18 17:20:04 2015 UTC,That nose!
batman,3dqh4v,FartDrunkLove,17,Sat Jul 18 17:50:27 2015 UTC,No love for Andrew Koenig's joker from Batman: Dead End?
batman,3dqh4v,TKJ,12,Sat Jul 18 16:28:07 2015 UTC,Pour one out for Boner. RIP in peace.
batman,3dqh4v,basiamille,10,Sat Jul 18 17:14:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was going to suggest him as ""the lost soul"" or something. Poor AK47."
batman,3dqh4v,drjoehumphrey,7,Sat Jul 18 17:35:38 2015 UTC,"Gone, not forgotten. (except by OP)"
batman,3dqh4v,Audiovore,30,Sat Jul 18 19:41:44 2015 UTC,What was Troy Baker from? Because it looks like the joker from the Arkham series but we all know that's Mark Hamill.
batman,3dqh4v,aneil2007,80,Sat Jul 18 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"Arkham Origins. Troy Baker nailed Hamil's version except he is younger, the game shows the first time he meets the Bat and how he comes to obsess over him."
batman,3dqh4v,richie-the-third,36,Sat Jul 18 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"Baker really did an amazing job on that. It was almost perfect, and genuinely felt just a tad younger."
batman,3dqh4v,mr-doc-prof-zark,11,Sat Jul 18 17:16:29 2015 UTC,He's done joker in other things right? I'm pretty sure he did joker in the arkham movie didn't he?
batman,3dqh4v,Grimlock69,6,Sat Jul 18 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"Just checked IMDB, seems you're correct!"
batman,3dqh4v,mr-doc-prof-zark,3,Sat Jul 18 18:14:49 2015 UTC,I thought he did since it's based on the games an he has the same character design
batman,3dqh4v,Grimlock69,10,Sat Jul 18 19:33:06 2015 UTC,Arkham Origins. Mark Hamill didn't do Joker's voice in that one.
batman,3dqh4v,JesterOnStilts,6,Sat Jul 18 16:00:54 2015 UTC,Arkham Origins.
batman,3dqh4v,AVestedInterest,5,Sat Jul 18 16:01:43 2015 UTC,Baker has done the voice in Arkham Origins and the Assault on Arkham movie.  edit: missed a letter
batman,3dqh4v,huanthewolfhound,9,Sat Jul 18 18:33:40 2015 UTC,Kinda disappointed that Creed Bratton as Creed Bratton as the Joker isn't listed here...
batman,3dqh4v,puffstepdaddy,8,Sat Jul 18 22:13:01 2015 UTC,Being nearly illegible is better...?
batman,3dqh4v,sectorfour,138,Sat Jul 18 17:27:16 2015 UTC,This is terrible
batman,3dqh4v,Wad_Squad,46,Sat Jul 18 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it needs to be, at least three times bigger and more needlessly complicated before we stop beating this karma train to death /s"
batman,3dqh4v,secretly_a_dolphin,38,Sat Jul 18 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"This whole ""Mark Hamill is the One True Joker"" circlejerk that reddit is on lately is so fucking dumb.   Edit: see below me for examples"
batman,3dqh4v,darkpassenger9,21,Sat Jul 18 20:14:52 2015 UTC,"For real. They're all just different takes on the character. Just because you have nostalgia for Hamill's, it was your first or whatever, it doesn't make his take ""truer"" than the others."
batman,3dqh4v,graciliano,3,Sat Jul 18 21:22:26 2015 UTC,"He's the ""true"" Joker in the sense that everyone thinks of him when they think of the Joker and that nearly everyone seems to agree he is the best one.  Whenever someone new plays the Joker he is the one they are compared to.  And I hate that people always use, ""nostalgia,"" to discredit other peoples' opinions. Is your favorite video game OoT or KOTOR? Well those games are overrated and you only think they're good because of nostalgia! And now I can't like Mark Hamill's Joker the best."
batman,3dqh4v,xFoeHammer,5,Sun Jul 19 00:51:30 2015 UTC,So why is the middle one just the Joker? Is he more widely accepted as the best Joker?
batman,3dqh4v,hellonium,16,Sat Jul 18 18:09:26 2015 UTC,"He is arguably the most the most popular version of the Joker, He has also been voicing the Joker for close to 3 decades now. Longer than anyone else's contribution to the character."
batman,3dqh4v,Fuzzy-Hat,6,Sat Jul 18 18:45:55 2015 UTC,"I think for most people Mark Hamill is who they think of when they think of the Joker. I think part of that is that he has been the Joker for one of the longest time periods, if not the THE longest time period."
batman,3dqh4v,ezaviar,14,Sat Jul 18 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"Call me a heathen, but the Joker from the Arkham Trilogy is my favourite. And Adam West's Batman is also my favourite."
batman,3dqh4v,Poet-Laureate,23,Sat Jul 18 16:39:10 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the games?  Then you like the most popular one lol mark did arkham and troy did origins.
batman,3dqh4v,heretoupvoteeveryone,3,Sat Jul 18 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"Is he the most popular. That surprises me. But yeah talking about Arkham Asylum, City and Knight. Not played Origins."
batman,3dqh4v,Poet-Laureate,9,Sat Jul 18 16:54:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah Mark Hamill did the Joker for The Arkham series (sans Origins). Mark Hamill has also done the joker in several other things, but he's most famous for his portrayal of the Joker in The Animated Series. He's definitely one of the most well known and loved Jokers."
batman,3dqh4v,Consul-Incitatus,6,Sat Jul 18 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"Oh believe me I've watched the Animated Series. I also knew that Mark Hamill did the Joker in AA, AC and AK, but to me it's a totally different and better portrayal. If that makes sense."
batman,3dqh4v,Poet-Laureate,10,Sat Jul 18 17:48:08 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. It's like they took the Joker from the animated series and just took the ratings off. It feels like this is how he was supposed to be in the cartoon but they had to censor it and they only got close a few times (Return of the Joker, Mask of the Phantasm)"
batman,3dqh4v,donredd,4,Sat Jul 18 17:58:32 2015 UTC,Mask of the phantasm is in my option the best batman movie ever made
batman,3dqh4v,Grimlock69,2,Sat Jul 18 18:14:21 2015 UTC,Yes exactly! Love it :)
batman,3dqh4v,Poet-Laureate,2,Sat Jul 18 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"It's probably because for most of the series (AA and AC) they had returned the core staff, more or less, from BTAS (Conroy, Hamill, Sorkin, Dini) and weren't limited to trying to fit within the confines of a kid's tv show."
batman,3dqh4v,wonder_lost,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"Oh I see what you mean. I totally get that, I think I would still have to pick animated series joker over Arkham joker, but Hamill's arkham joker does have a much darker and somewhat alluring side."
batman,3dqh4v,Consul-Incitatus,7,Sat Jul 18 19:32:48 2015 UTC,"call you a heathen because your favorite joker is Mark Hamill? i think we mostly might agree with you haha.. troy baker only did the voice in origins, mark hamill was the joker of asylum and city"
batman,3dqh4v,ramsesBS,5,Sat Jul 18 17:00:18 2015 UTC,"That is literally the most popular opinion, pretty much everyone likes Hamill the best"
batman,3dqh4v,AVeryWittyUsername,3,Sat Jul 18 18:21:13 2015 UTC,You forgot Larry Storch's Joker
batman,3dqh4v,youfuckmymother,3,Sat Jul 18 18:12:36 2015 UTC,I would say Jack Nicholsons joker was more of an artist than a gangster
batman,3dqh4v,DrDooooooom,3,Sat Jul 18 20:38:53 2015 UTC,What about Larry Storch as the Joker from Scooby Doo?! That's an important one
batman,3dqh4v,RocketBeaver,6,Sat Jul 18 21:11:41 2015 UTC,I don't understand how people often compare Mark Hamill's joker to that of the actors who are in movies. How do you compare voice acting to an entire embodiment of the joker? They are too very different things.
batman,3dqh4v,FourSidedTriangles,8,Sat Jul 18 19:16:37 2015 UTC,less is more
batman,3dqh4v,Jet__Fire,10,Sat Jul 18 16:12:07 2015 UTC,"I like how Troy Baker is the mimic. His Joker is a good imitation of Mark's performance, but is nothing compared to the real thing."
batman,3dqh4v,Velorium_Camper,17,Sat Jul 18 16:35:46 2015 UTC,"I bet he could do a good job if he were given the opportunity to explore the character on his own. Given that he's in the Arkham series, of course he's going to be copying Hamill's take on the character."
batman,3dqh4v,BrokenClockwerk,8,Sat Jul 18 16:57:14 2015 UTC,Troy's a fantastic actor so I have no doubt he could do a good Joker.
batman,3dqh4v,Velorium_Camper,4,Sat Jul 18 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"It's not only him doing a Hamill impression, for a quarter of the story Joker runs around pretending to be Black Mask."
batman,3dqh4v,loki1887,2,Sat Jul 18 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed arkham asylum and like city but the fact that knight and origins have joker as the main villain yet again pisses me off. Origins it was supposed to be black mask but nope, it's just joker lol. Then knight even with him being dead he is still the fucking main villain, he may have more lines than any other character."
batman,3dqh4v,Ironboy1998,2,Sat Jul 18 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"Damn, I always thought Hammil did the arkham games too."
batman,3dqh4v,slyfoxninja,18,Sat Jul 18 17:23:02 2015 UTC,He did. Except for Arkham Origins.
batman,3dqh4v,Jazzimusprime,2,Sat Jul 18 17:28:32 2015 UTC,Ok I was gonna say I swear I saw his name in the credits.
batman,3dqh4v,slyfoxninja,2,Sat Jul 18 17:30:06 2015 UTC,I guess he did a good job because I didn't spot the difference.
batman,3dqh4v,slyfoxninja,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"he does the rocksteady ones, baker is joker in origins"
batman,3dqh4v,HyperMegaMuffin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:10 2015 UTC,Poor Roger Stoneburger
batman,3dqh4v,dtsyk,3,Sat Jul 18 18:18:34 2015 UTC,"I personally thought Troy Baker was fantastic in Arkham Origins (the voice cast was the only thing I really cared for in that game), anyone of the same opinion or am I the only one?"
batman,3dqh4v,Nighteagle666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"He was great but it was just him emulating a younger Mark Hamill. I think if he was allowed to take the character and make it his own, we'd see something incredible."
batman,3dqh4v,ezaviar,2,Sat Jul 18 18:49:37 2015 UTC,John DiMaggio's joker was there best if not tied with Marks
batman,3dqh4v,handsolo85,2,Sat Jul 18 18:37:30 2015 UTC,Someone needs to do this for batman now
batman,3dqh4v,-Zoren-,2,Sat Jul 18 19:46:33 2015 UTC,The first one looks like David tennant

batman,3dqh4v,sharltocopes,2,Sat Jul 18 20:35:44 2015 UTC,What about Cameron Monaghan?
batman,3dqh4v,iRevo,2,Sat Jul 18 21:54:19 2015 UTC,Two words that could have stopped it all.   Andrea.   Beaumont.
batman,3dqh4v,gimmethemtacos,3,Sat Jul 18 22:09:00 2015 UTC,I love Brent Spiner and YJ in general but the Young Justice Joker's dialogue made me cringe something fierce and NOT in a good way.
batman,3dqh4v,GreenLanternCorps,2,Sat Jul 18 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"I love Jeff Bennett as a voice actor, but I don't like him as The Joker. I understand what Brave and the Bold was going for, but I just don't like him as The Joker."
batman,3dqh4v,ThatIckyGuy,2,Sat Jul 18 23:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they were doing a tribute to the [Dick Sprang] version while trying to find a Joker that hadn't been done and reflected the tongue-in-cheek style of the show.  Like you wrote, I understood, but I didn't enjoy it."
