VintageLadyBoners,3cxe90,UniversalFarrago,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"Ashley?  What a degeneration that name has taken. Every Ashley I've met has been a very sweet, but equally dumb, white girl."

VintageLadyBoners,3cxe90,UniversalFarrago,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:38 2015 UTC,Interesting. The name just sounds so feminine to me. Like calling a man Leslie.   I've never read Gone With the Wind. Is it any good?

VintageLadyBoners,3807s7,SaraFist,4,Sun May 31 21:52:49 2015 UTC,he seems so nonchalant about his steering wheel being broken off
VintageLadyBoners,3807s7,captaincardigan,2,Sun May 31 22:32:09 2015 UTC,He's about to chuck it overboard and steer with the sheer force of his will.
