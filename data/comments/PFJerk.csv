PFJerk,3e054b,symian1,13,Mon Jul 20 22:55:50 2015 UTC,FYI the tax bracket is higher for the better paying job. Would compare the after tax salary rather than the gross. You want to make the most accurate comparison possible.
PFJerk,3e054b,medikit,16,Mon Jul 20 23:22:35 2015 UTC,"Good point! If you get bumped into a higher tax bracket, you might end up making even LESS money!"
PFJerk,3e054b,incogito_ergo,8,Tue Jul 21 00:26:19 2015 UTC,Or at least definitely pay MORE taxes which is not very good personal finance.
PFJerk,3e054b,medikit,6,Tue Jul 21 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"I is tax attorney. Can confirm. Mo' money, mo' taxes."
PFJerk,3e054b,TheFalsePoet,5,Tue Jul 21 06:46:06 2015 UTC,What are the job prospects for careers relating to your degrees?
PFJerk,3e054b,CJ-Johnson,6,Mon Jul 20 23:13:30 2015 UTC,"Making various accounts to upvote himself, being the real powerhouse behind the President, Muppet erotica."
PFJerk,3e054b,mosdefin,5,Tue Jul 21 10:43:33 2015 UTC,It's best to go through life paralyzed with fear.  Try to agonize over this as long as possible before making a bad decision.
PFJerk,3e054b,dequeued,4,Tue Jul 21 07:59:06 2015 UTC,"How long will your commute be at the new job? If you are spending an hour in the car every day commuting, it is very likely that you will actually be making less money per hour."
PFJerk,3e054b,throwaway834324,4,Mon Jul 20 23:16:24 2015 UTC,"You should never switch jobs for more money. Your employer will appreciate all of your hard work, and is acting in your best interest even if it doesn't seem that way at the moment. Keep up the hard work and you will eventually be taken care of! Loyalty is always the best policy!  If that doesn't work, fire your boss and get a better one."
PFJerk,3e054b,incogito_ergo,3,Tue Jul 21 00:24:36 2015 UTC,"Personally you couldn't pay me enough to administer a hedge fund, but then again, I'm not very good with gardening."
PFJerk,3e054b,rem87062597,2,Tue Jul 21 05:20:25 2015 UTC,"However, I was also recently head-hunted for an Administrator position in a 132 billion dollar Hedge Fund.   Do you really want to move to Omaha, though? Gross."
PFJerk,3e054b,threeLetterMeyhem,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:07 2015 UTC,I make double that with only an Associate's in Puppetry. My uncles Bert and Ernie really helped me out.
PFJerk,3e054b,fuhrerhealth,2,Tue Jul 21 03:04:52 2015 UTC,Wait to cash out your company loyalty until after it vests

PFJerk,3dwmjn,Buckiller,6,Mon Jul 20 03:37:29 2015 UTC,I'm not sure you're in the right sub...
PFJerk,3dwmjn,jereader,5,Mon Jul 20 10:25:23 2015 UTC,Maybe this is subtle neo-jerking?
PFJerk,3dwmjn,Alarchy,4,Mon Jul 20 11:46:56 2015 UTC,Uber-subtle
PFJerk,3dwmjn,jereader,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:47:59 2015 UTC,The next big thing will be Uber with guarded vans!
PFJerk,3dwmjn,anonyymi,4,Mon Jul 20 13:06:55 2015 UTC,I'd make sure you buy a morning latte to speed up FIRE.  All that extra energy will make you work faster and therefore make more money.
PFJerk,3dwmjn,jcmolol,2,Mon Jul 20 13:30:49 2015 UTC,"Bingo. I've found myself doing exactly this!  Read in another /r/ thread about how the guy that brought donuts on Fridays was one of the only ones to avoid some company layoffs. Thinking about bringing everyone Starbucks on Fridays as another way of investing in my career. Great for my credit card and Starbucks star rewards too!  Thinking on it more, anyone know if i could put these coffee costs on my taxes as an itemized deduction?"
PFJerk,3dwmjn,incogito_ergo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:15:26 2015 UTC,"That's funny, I also found that making a lot more money is helping me retire sooner! I thought I was the only one!"
PFJerk,3dwmjn,Brobi_WanKenobi,3,Mon Jul 20 14:32:20 2015 UTC,"Weird, are you sure that's the best way to go? I've just been picking up free shit from Craigslist and then selling them after doing nothing like an asshole, and then depositing the earnings into my Vanguard mutual fund account. Pretty sure that's how you're supposed to do it."
PFJerk,3dwmjn,ItsYaBoyBeasley,2,Mon Jul 20 16:43:09 2015 UTC,You may want to post a breakdown of your budget for us to compliment how financially-solvent you are.

PFJerk,3dtifz,tturedditor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:29:42 2015 UTC,Buy the NBG ETF. Extremely oversold right now. I'm waiting for it to get back up to ~100 a share. I'll see you at the yacht club.
