The most recent research seems to show that inflammation is the biggest cause of cardiovascular disease, and we don't fully understand what causes systemic inflammation - some possible culprits being discussed and studied right now include high amounts of polyunsaturated fats (aka, the ""heart healthy, good fats"" like canola and soybean oil) or high amounts of fructose, but almost certainly not the saturated fat and cholesterol that was cited as the biggest problems in the 80's and 90's.

Elderly?...depressed   That depends on a lot of different variables, imho. If we (assuming you're in the US) had a single payer or otherwise universal healthcare system then at least some persons who fit the above categories could work because they could be medicated. For those who could thus work if properly treated, no, I don't think they should be able to receive monetary benefits.   For those that can't work even with proper medical attention, I am more than happy with having a basic (monetary) income system set up for them. That would include the moderate-to-severely autistic, the elderly, etc.   All that being said, I think the biggest problem with the  disability system is that people take advantage of it, and that's in large part because it's a monetary system rather than a system dealing primarily with in-kind benefits.   For example, I have attention deficit disorder.  Without my medication, my work product would severely suffer and I would not be nearly as productive as I am. It frustrates me to no end that people receive money in exchange for claiming ADD as a disability and abstaining from working full time. We should not be giving such people disability checks, we should be giving them treatment, whether medication or cognitive behavioral therapy. Giving them money just creates more problems, especially the problem of ""if you work X hours, you are no longer entitled to disability payments."" That's an absurd way to deal with disabilities. We should be gearing our disability programs to encourage people live normal, productive lives, not discourage them from working.   You yourself stated that the reason you were able to beat your period of depression were your parents' resources. My plan would be to give the same kind of medical resources to similarly afflicted persons so they can beat it, too, along with other necessities like food and housing if necessary.   TL;DR Monetary disability help should only be given to those who cannot be helped by modern medicine. Our social benefit programs for the disabled should be geared toward food, housing, and perhaps most importantly medicine.  Otherwise, we're creating incentives that do not help society or the disabled themselves."

Admittedly, it is low pay, and they have to stretch every dollar.  My point is that $15 for the most menial jobs may be minimal in New York or Chicago, but it would be excessive for Louisiana, where even young professionals make less.  The cost of living here doesn't justify it.  Small businesses can't afford it.  Here, $10 per hour would be a boom for people at the bottom.  $15 would not be sustainable.

It's hard to find sources for exactly what the total real life revenue/wage/overhead/profit ratios are, and because any information you would be likely to find would be self reported, the numbers are fuzzy at best, but consider the example of McDonalds in Denmark - the lowest paid employees there are unionized, so they earn $21 an hour, and the raw material to produce the food they sell is more expensive, yet McDonalds is still thriving there. They can afford to pay their Danish employees 260% what they claim to be able to pay their American counterparts, yet the average cost of the food they sell is only 12% higher.  The most important takeaway is that because employees are paid better there, the businesses that pay them are able to increase their sales.  Businesses want to be able to pay their employees more, because they want more customers and the best way for that to happen is for consumers to have higher wages, but they don't want to be the only business paying more.

And that's saying nothing of automation, which is poised to eliminate even more jobs than free trade ever could have.  Increasing minimum wage doesn't address these problems at all, but neither does allowing wages to stagnate and diminish.  We can't compete with starving children in SE Asia, or ""robot slaves"", unless we want to adopt a similar lifestyle.  Instead of trying to compete we have to push back to try to reverse the course of our economy.

Maine has that distinction.  Hillary Clinton as one of the 'sistas' is more than a bit far fetched. She grew up in a rock solid Republican household and in high school was a Goldwater Girl. At Wellesley College she had an epiphany and supported the anti-war campaign of Eugene McCarthy.  Even so, she also worked as a Washington, D.C., intern for Gerald Ford, Republican leader of the House, and she attended the 1968 Republican convention to work for New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller’s unsuccessful effort to get the GOP presidential nomination.  Another minor point, but worth mentioning, is that the percentage of blacks at Wellesley was probably lower when Hillary was there than Vermont is now.  As far as Democrats (the Democratic hierarchy) fearing an activist base a place to start might be Bill Clinton's ""free speech zones"" and the travel along to the heavy hand of the Obama administration's dealing with the Occupy Movement.  Make no mistake, the DNC has yet to find a response to the Sanders  Movement. Hillary doesn't need them. Sanders doesn't want them.

progressive,3dy076,imitationcheese,23,Mon Jul 20 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"I feel as if Sanders philosophy behind racial inequality is that there are certain prerequisites that need to be met before it can be achieved. Its less gung-ho than other progressive approaches to solving inequality, but this article almost makes Sanders and his supporters out to be racists, which is far from the truth.   Here's an honest question that I've been pondering which I'd love to hear a few opinions on: Realistically, how can we stop racism? It feels to me as if education and time are the only way to change people's beliefs, because you can't just tell a racist not to be so."
progressive,3dy076,redbingo,10,Mon Jul 20 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"I think the article is less focused on calling white progressives racist and more about saying that race issues are being pushed into the background in progressive discourse. There is a difference there. Sanders is definitely correct that racial and economic issues are closely connected, but that does not mean that they are one and the same, and addressing one issue may help alleviate some tension, but it's not the same as addressing the other. If a job program is created that helps reduce unemployment in black communities, that does not mean that the newly-employed people will cease to experience discrimination and racist acts. Time and education are necessary, sure, but the push behind a lot of the #blacklivesmatter activism is specifically for accountability within the criminal justice system. I guess it's less about ""stopping racism"" and more about stopping people with guns and badges from getting away with murder because the victim is an unarmed person of color. It is possible to use policy reform and legislature to address the effects of racism without ""stopping"" it. I am reminded of that MLK quote: ""It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important""   edit I think it's also worth emphasizing that not all people of color are poor or unemployed. The idea that economic reform policies alone will suffice to ameliorate racial inequality is starting to seem more backward, the more I think about it. That attitude just kind of reinforces negative stereotypes about what it means to be a person of color. Fighting poverty should certainly be a priority, always. I won't argue with that. That said, the experience of racism coming from the police, the neighborhood, the classroom, the media, and the workplace to a middle-class, college educated, working, suburban-dwelling black person is something that is completely erased from the ""racism comes from poverty"" narrative. Frankly, it is another form if ignorant racist victim-blaming to assert that poor black people are responsible for the discrimination experienced by working middle-class black people. I wholeheartedly endorse Sanders above any other candidate that has been running since I have been an eligible voter, but it is very frustrating to see supporters of his who consider themselves progressives resort to this kind of diminishing and alienating rhetoric. It is possible to be supportive and critical at the same time. Regardless of how things develop, I would like to see Sanders take the White House. That said, I hope that he and his campaign can step up and address this issue appropriately before that time comes."

progressive,3dy076,sailortitan,2,Mon Jul 20 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response.   I do agree that racial issues aren't being prioritized by any candidates right now, but I feel like that's due to the amount of tension around the issue right now. Sanders' presidency is already a longshot, and he has to tread lightly around racial issues at this point, especially if Biden announces candidacy. Based on his track record, I'd bet that Sanders will approach these issues when his career is not on the line.   The idea that economic reform policies alone will suffice to ameliorate racial inequality is starting to seem more backward, the more I think about it.    This idea started specifically as a solution to the inequality issues in black communities, primarily Ferguson, and eventually people forgot that it's specifically a way to lower racial inequality in low income, primarily black communities; not in general. Sanders talked about this in this NPR interview in June.   On a related note: I grew up in Berkeley, and always participated in equality events but never really realized how complex of an issue inequality is until the events that have occurred this last year, even though I've studied inequality my entire life. It's horrible, but it's motivating me more and more every day to make a difference in any way I can. It's insane to think that a few years ago I thought that racism wasn't a persisting issue; oh, how wrong I was."

They came out of the woodwork during Occupy Wall Street, and it ended up discrediting and watering down the movement until it died.  You put it really well and it describes almost exactly how I feel. Economic inequality is a problem nearly everyone acknowledges, and is potentially much easier fixed than racial inequality.  Racism is an innate feature in humans. It served a viable survival purpose for a very long time. We've evolved to stay alive. Being suspicious of others, particularly others who are different, goes a very long way toward keeping someone alive in unknown and uncivilized times.  The only way to combat it is with education and time. Shouting down who could essentially be our liberal 'savior' candidate, and additionally the one most likely to be sympathetic to the protestors' concerns, is childish and ineffective."
progressive,3dy076,KinglyWeevil,3,Mon Jul 20 19:50:14 2015 UTC,"What we have here is a group of people that feel, quite correctly mind you, that there is something wrong but they are too driven emotion to productively attack the issue. To an outsider, someone who agrees that there is a problem but is not personally affected by it enough to harbor such emotion, it comes across as if they are just trying make a scene and expect someone to just wave a magic wand and have the problems be solved.  This is, flat out, the wrong way to go about it. There is no singular solution nor is there an easy solution. As you said racism is an innate feature in humans. We are tribal people. But that's not all that's going on.   I'm not defending racism. I won't even begin to say that it's right by any stretch of the imagination. That said one problem I've seen with this group is that they fail to acknowledge that not all racism is equal. Not all racism can be attacked in the same way. Not all racism is rooted in the same cause. The second problem I see is that the community seeking racial equality has trouble admitting that there are significant problems occurring within their own community that need to be addressed in order to make any progress. Problems that are not inherent to skin color, rather a product of history, but problems that contribute to what we see today none the less.  Case in point - I would not be surprised if many, if not most, people out there who hold prejudice are not your typical confederate flag waving white supremacists. You know the people I'm talking about. The ones who spew vitriol that has no justification. Most people are not this. Most people hold relatively racist views due to life experiences.   I'm not going to sugar coat this. We see higher rates of crime among African Americans in this country. Many people allow their tribal instincts to kick in and immediately associate the skin color with the higher crime rate particularly if they have been a victim of such a crime. They fail to look deeper into the situation and realize that the crime rate is not a matter of skin color but rather economic status. Poverty drives these higher crime rates and African Americans suffer higher poverty rates due to the history that has taken place in this country that each and every one of us know all too well.  Is it right that people are prejudice against black people for this reason? Of course not. But on some distant level it is understandable that someone could draw such a conclusion from instinct. It's a survival mechanism. If you get mugged by a black while walking down the street at night you are probably going to be sketched the fuck out every time you walk by a black guy at night for the rest of your life.   Focusing on education and poverty reduction would do wonders to lift up the African American community, reduce crime within their own communities, and change the views of many people who look at them in a negative light. Even the police seeing as how police violence is such a hot topic lately. While I won't deny that skin color drives some of issues with the cops there is also no question that cops are more on edge in poverty stricken high crime areas which leads to rash judgment and mistakes.   From everything I've seen over the last couple years with all these issues going on this is the rational first step toward making legitimate progress. It's a realistic approach that we can actually expect to see results on rather than making a scene and just expecting people to stop being assholes all at once.   /end rant"

That's why we can't have Nordic style police forces and prison policies - the critics are absolutely right, it would not work here. Poverty breeds into society the idea that there is a ""system,"" that it does not care about you, and that you should therefore get everything out of it that you can. Take advantage of every loophole and just fuck it for all you're worth. (Which is, imo, just one of the facets of the 'Great Cultural Sickness' that's rampant in America right now).

And I think the rebranding of so-called ""Centrist""(though I would call them corporate) dems is devastatingly harmful to this country.  It seems, however, that you're agreeing that the real problem is the Corporate stranglehold over the Democratic Party.  ""Gradualism"" --or whatever stupid thing they want to call it--has done fuckall for ""everyday Americans"" for as long as this policy of appeasing the rich has been around.

In time and context, centrist democrats are still going to be left of centre on most issues. Hillary is still going to be reliably left on very public issues while still maintaining the corporate status quo in an administration I would imagine would be very similar to Obama's.   But part of why this is standard is the progressive in-fighting we're seeing here. So many leftist elements would rather fight each other for superiority of their agenda within the progressive movement than unite against a conservative front both within the democratic party and in the country as a whole. Liberal republicans have been almost wholesale expelled from the GOP, and so the left wing of the Republican party is now the right wing of the Democratic one.   You've got Sanders, a surging progressive champion who's not perfect, but is someone progressive elements appear to be coalescing around, and this man is being attacked by other progressives because his rhetoric is perceived to have an insufficient focus on racial equality as opposed to economic equality. The disunity of otherwise agreeable factions has now allowed the centrist element to retain control.  But it could be worse. Torpedoing the Sanders primary campaign is par for the course. If progressive action comes out against Hilary in the general and Democratic supports falls though and a republican (ANY republican) gets elected, it's game over for universal healthcare, national parks, social security, voting rights, and any other institution progressives have fought to achieve in this country that the united GOP house, senate, and white house want to destroy, all because the left in this country had no perspective."

You can clearly feel her deep frustration, and that of the whole black community, at repeatedly seeing mostly half-hearted efforts to address a problem very real to them -- meager attempts to mitigate a serious problem, rather than bold ones that attack it head-first. Sander's got it right from the macro perspective: economic inequality will definitely alleviate the systematic, structural violence against black people in America; but he absolutely needs to address the micro perspective as well, if he hopes to gather the massive support he needs to be elected President.

I for one think that precisely because Bernie is the minorities' greatest ally in this campaign, that they do well in making sure that he, more than any other candidate, is aware that he needs to directly address the racism problem, rather than bundle it as a consequence of the disproportionate correlation between the black and low-income populations.  When you are dealing with a disease, you obviously need to prevent further manifestation of its effects, but you cannot ignore the need to treat the symptoms that are currently manifesting. People dealing with systematic oppression day in and day out, and suffering the deaths and of their loved ones, don't want to hear about an eventual amelioration of the overall situation. They want solutions that can give them some relief now. I don't think you can blame them for that. In this respect, the MLK quote that /u/cool-friend mentioned above, really nails it:   It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important.   Hopefully it won't take further disruptive action to make him rethink his communication strategy to include both the prevention and the cure aspects of the race problem.

Instead of our the US government supporting and working with the racist South African regime, we should have been supporting the ANC and the freedom fighters to overthrow the minority white government.

If that means they support dictatorships, or apartheid regimes like SA, then thats what the US has done. Often they instigate the dictatorships taking over. It has nothing to do with supporting democracy or human rights etc. Its all about the economy and the advantages to be made by US companies.   So this should be a surprise to absolutely no one out there in the world."

It has nothing to do with supporting democracy or human rights etc. Its all about the economy...   Aside from that ""following orders"" point, I completely agree. The US would prefer some neo-liberal ""democracy"" to rule, but you're right: It's not about any of the moralistic rhetoric that is the PR propaganda. As we've proven many times, the US government has no problem working with brutal dictatorships or fascists.  We've seen this recently when the Bahraini dictatorship shot unarmed pro-democracy protesters and admitted to widespread torture. Obama had no problem at all supporting the Bahraini dictator and supplying him with the weapons to commit his crimes."

I wish the ""Bastion of Freedom and Democracy(tm)"" that the US purports to be, is what it actually pursued with regards to foreign policy. (I wish my Canadian government did the same). The US is a bold and noble experiment in what sort of a political system we can achieve as humans. I hate to see that tarnished completely by the ignoble application of the foreign policy that is actually pursued as Real Politik. While economics are of course highly important, I think moral economics are just as important and moreover should be entirely possible for the US. If they simply required other nations who want to trade with them to act in a given way, a lot would reshape their behaviour and politics accordingly given how important a trading partner/market the US is for almost every other nation in the world."

Hillary cannot talk about the policies, even though she is an expert on them, because she is easily the worst campaigner that I have ever seen in my entire life.  I mean, really out of touch.  She is embracing positions that the mainstream of the party adopted in 1998.

Her campaign is a permanent stumble from miscalculation to misunderstanding to misstatement while wandering the minefields of the misleading mud slinging from the right.

Republicans believe in self sufficiency while Democrats believe the government should solve most problems.  There needs to be a balance between these philosophical views.   Bernie Sanders is strong on second amendment,  as am I.   He is also in favor of single payer health care.

The upshot is basically that it's Hillary's nomination to lose, that Sanders's gains are not Hillary's losses (meaning that most Democrats are not defecting to Sanders), and that outside of white, liberal Democrats, Sanders isn't really polling all that well.  While his gains are not an ""anyone but Hillary"" vote (meaning they're actually people who like Bernie Sanders, not people who hate Hillary), they're also still pretty small in comparison to Clinton's numbers.  And outside the Northeast, they may not get much higher.  And the fact that he's apparently not really drawing much from Hillary's numbers means that he's that much less likely to pull enough away to out-do her in the primaries."

I agree with you that there are more progressives out there willing to come out of the shadows, as it were, but I think the greater chunk of non-participation comes down to LOTS of every day folks believing that both parties mostly serve the interests of the elite (and they're right).  Most conservatives I know rail against the banks and the cronyism and oligarchy, but somehow get it twisted around that government is the problem, instead of the fat cats we elect into government (foxes guarding the hen house).  Bernie speaks plainly and right to those concerns, with the result that, as several articles have already pointed out, most Americans agree with his ""fringe"" ideas.  He even got Jesse Ventura's endorsement, FFS, who was a Reform Party governor (center-right populism).  TL;DR:  Bernie is truly representative of ""the people,"" and I think you'll find nominally conservative folks willing to vote for him on specific populist issues."

Hillary's favorable rating drops as her unfavorable rating rises   so, both voters who view her favorably and unfavorably generally change their minds at about the same rate. however,   Bernie's favorable rating rises as his unfavorable rating stays pretty much the same   which tells me that he isn't changing the minds of people who view him unfavorably (i.e. economically-minded liberals) at anywhere near the same rate as he's getting NEW people to view him favorably.  let me know if that was more clear."

They New York Times, for example, featured pretty much every Republican candidate, even joke candidates like Trump, while completely ignoring Sanders. It's almost as if Hillary is - as Mr. Silvers notes - already ""coronated"" as the Democrat candidate.   Additionally, Clinton has lots of credibility issues, flip-flopping on a number of issues from gay marriage (she was against it in 2004 and for it in 2013?), the Keystone XL pipeline, and others while she's noticably ""business friendly"" by supporting the TPP and lunching with Wall Street bankers. Sanders, on the other hand, has been preaching the same gospel since being in office, which speaks volumes about his honesty.

I'm guessing that the person who ended up shooting and killing the attacker was an MP or security at the installation.  The Marines who were killed were almost certainly unarmed by law. In the end a good person with a gun stopped the shooter by shooting them with a gun.  This shows the opposite of what you are saying, it supports the idea that guns save lives and stop mass shooters. If no good person with a gun had confronted and shot him, the shooter likely would have killed many more people.  He was stopped by a gun.  Now, guns aren't force fields, you can still be killed even if highly trained and armed, of course. But if no one was armed, more people would have died. If more good people (such as the 4 marines who died) were able to be armed legally, they might have been able to stop the shooter even faster, saving more lives.  So, guns can protect civilians if they get attacked, that isn't a myth. It isn't a 100% certainty that a gun will protect a civilian who is attacked, but nothing in life is certain. With a gun, any individual has a much better chance of defending themselves from this sort of attack than if they don't have a gun."

I imagine they hold a rose-colored view of the power of the ""free market"" as some sort of equalizing force for social justice, equality, opportunity. The reality being the fact that there is so much inequality and disparate control of the means of production, etc. that without considerable regulation, revision of taxation, etc. there will continue to be a growing chasm between the .1% and everyone else.  When used effectively, the ""free market"" can be a powerful tool, but it is only one tool and has considerable limitations (particularly externalized costs like pollution, worker's rights, etc). What we have is a huge gap between what the citizens want, and what the government and politicians are providing. This is the coined as the ""democratic divide"" and it is growing as money in politics becomes more prolific.  It is why a vote for Hillary or a vote for Bush is different, but not nearly as different as the U.S. needs it to be. It is much cheaper to hedge your bets by purchasing two political parties and tamp down dissent. It is one of the great problems with U.S. ""democracy"".  Support Sanders in the primary! Vote for Hillary if the establishment crams her down our throat and you live in a state that is less than 5 points ahead in the polls on election day, otherwise go Green.

progressive,3d49fm,spaceghoti,42,Mon Jul 13 12:02:57 2015 UTC,"Context for those who didn't recall WHICH awful thing a GOP candidate said:  But Jeb Bush — who is still attempting to justify his ludicrous claim that he can double our rate of economic growth — says that Americans “need to work longer hours and through their productivity gain more income for their families.""  My two cents (which I am sure many of you already know):  Increases in productivity doesn't mean more money for workers. It just goes to the wealthy. It has been going on for decades already. That was the real redistribution of wealth."
progressive,3d49fm,MikeTangoKilo,12,Mon Jul 13 13:14:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest shock to me is that the right is trying to create a ""productivity crisis"" when American productivity is top notch in the developed world. Work/Life balance? Total shit. Benefits? Complete shit. Job security? Garbage. Management is getting shit tons out of the worker, the worker, as per the Reagan consensus, is getting shit on."
progressive,3d49fm,ScottMaximus23,18,Mon Jul 13 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"From the bbc:   ""We have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows,"" Mr Bush told the editors of the New Hampshire Union Leader in an interview that was broadcast online. ""It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That's the only way we're going to get out of this rut that we're in.""   But then...    ""You work three jobs?"" then-President Bush asked a divorced mother of three in Nebraska during a town hall forum. ""Uniquely American, isn't it? I mean, that is fantastic that you're doing that. Get any sleep?""   And then...    ""Only Washington Democrats could be out-of-touch enough to criticise giving more Americans the ability to work, earn a paycheque, and make ends meet,"" a Bush campaign aide said.   So it seems to me he is talking about low participation with that quote. But then he's jovial about a woman who needs to work 3 jobs, but then demonstrates an attitude that astounds me. ""What? The problem can't be that people aren't paid enough for their work! That would imply that there's something wrong with America! That can't be, it must be that people are lazy.""   So while his original comment might have truly been directed to those that aren't working full hours, his attitude about those that are is based on the idea that working hard will always get you ahead. So out of touch with reality. And again, he spins it so that you can't take up the contrary position without implying that you are unpatriotic.   Edit: and what really infuriates me is that the attitude that these low-participattion workers are lazy blocks them from seeing the truth: that these low wages don't create the incentive for people to work.  EDIT2: The middle quote was from W when president; I misread the BBC article.  But I still think this is what Jeb thinks of the situation."

Says who?  The article then goes on to ""provide context"" to Bush's quote by quoting Romney and Paul, but never Bush.  This is literally begging the question.  Why are Romney and Paul the context for Bush's quote?  The context is the context because that's the context.  So again, if they had the chance to use his own words again him, why not?

Unfortunately, the deck (in this case the government) has been stacked to favor corporations. Now instead of playing the pair of sevens, it’s expected that a person should give up a seven so business/the 1% - whatever you want to call them, can complete their straight and that’s not how it is suppose to work.

It was already crystal clear by 2008 that NCLB was an attack at largely democrat-supporting teacher unions (if that ever wasn't clear), a give away to the testing/educational publishing corporations, and--on top of all that--not working by its own dubious metrics.  Obama ran on reform, and I hoped we'd see major, positive, changes in educational policy.   To his credit, and unlike some other campaign rhetoric meant to appeal to progressives, Obama always did claim to like charter schools. He also never backed away from testing and accountability spinspeak, so my hope for reform wasn't really based on anything more than a belief that Obama, being a Dem, would approach this much differently than Bush, even if the rhetoric sounded similar. Turns out I was wrong.  Obama used the poor economy to push his ""Race to the Top"" devil's bargain on states. With tax receipts falling and cuts needed across the board at the state level, Obama dangled the carrot of free money in front of the states, if only they ""reformed."" The reform, of course, was to implement more testing, to link testing to teacher evaluations, and to increase access to charters. The money was paltry in the grand scheme, 5 billion over two years for the entire country, but states went for it. Worse, Obama made the funds a competition, forcing states to do their best (worst) in order to just have a chance at any funds.  Needing the money, state after state passed ridiculous reform laws, often with little debate. There were deadlines to be met, and states needed to show they were committed to standardized testing, gathering data, and changing teacher evaluations. The ""race"" hit poor states and districts the hardest as they were the ones that needed the funds most. The ""choice"" was face draconian cuts to staff and schools (layoffs, closings, larger class sizes, etc), or make a few changes in the state code not immediately felt by anyone. There was no choice, this was no real competition, it was extortion to get controversial, anti-labor policy pushed through. It worked.  I'm not convinced Obama or Duncan realize what they're doing and have done. I think they probably believe their policies are simply controversial because any change would be. They are people who never attended public schools, whose children don't and will never attend public schools, and whose only exposure to public schools are the horror stories perpetuated by the reactionary right who believe public education is akin to Stalinist indoctrination.   The truth is that our public school system is an amazing success story. It's far from perfect, but it truly does provide opportunity in nearly all American communities, even the poorest. Public schools have led to so many positive outcomes on a social level its hard to even imagine what our country would look like without them. Integration, tolerance, food for needy kids, front line access to psychological and support services to people who otherwise wouldn't have access, supporting diversity (do you really honestly believe we'd have national support for things like gay rights if kids were left to religious or home schooling?), vocational opportunities, and the list can go on and on. But, Obama, Duncan, and all the conservative anti-public education camp focus on the disparities between the richest districts and the poorest, the ""achievement gap.""  They think unfortunate gaps in performance amongst ethnic groups indicative of a school system that's failing, rather than looking at the larger societal failure where ethnicities are segregated in the very neighborhoods they grow up in, and even how much they make for a living. Schools are castigated for not curing a problem they alone can't possibly fix. And while schools help and give aid to the situation, because they aren't a pancea, they get blamed for all the societal ills. This is what Obama and Duncan don't understand, schools are what we need to appreciate and build on, not reform because they aren't silver bullet fixes that cure all problems of capitalism.  You either appreciate the amazing job universal free k-12 education has done over the past century, or miss the point. We aren't Finland, they never had our problems and aren't our size, so it's nearly worthless to compare test scores amongst countries. And when you focus on standardized test scores, you're leaving out 90% of school's real function.  Obama and Duncan don't get this, and their policies have been deeply reactionary because of it. By focusing on data from tests, they've belittled and disregarded the much grander role public schools actually perform.   I was so happy when Obama took office, promising to reform NCLB. I knew he didn't really ""get it""--his talk of accountability made that clear--but he couldn't be worse than Bush, whose policies were so clearly motivated to destroy teachers' unions. It turns out he's been at least as bad, and probably worse."

We can't make the line people we agree with and people we don't so we have to ask ourselves what the distinction should be.  I don't want to give my money to any company that discriminates against homosexuals and my ability to do that is greatly diminished if organizers fear publishing the names of business will lead them to financial damages based on the actions of others.

And I disagree that him having made $2000 instead of $2 million for speaker's fees in 2014 somehow makes him more honorable than Hillary Clinton.  Speaker's fees are a good example of charging what the market will bear. It's not crooked, dishonest, dishonorable, or otherwise sleazy to ask a high speaker's fee. If an organization will pay it (and the speaker is willing to speak to that group) then let them charge whatever they want."

Really, what does charging a lot for a speaking engagement say about the candidate except that they (and others) believe whatever they have to say is worth that amount?  Sports teams pay successful athletes millions of dollars a year to play, while others don't make as much.  Is there a moral argument to be made for baseball players to be paid lots of money?  I don't think so, not really.  It's not like that money is coming out of the public trust.  Same with movie actors.  Robert Downey, Jr., got a lot more for Iron Man than Terrence Howard.  Is that a bad thing?  If so, why?  Why should speakers-- any speakers-- not be allowed to charge whatever they wants?  If an organization doesn't want to pay it, they can either ask for a deal or find another speaker.  This is something I've wondered about long before anyone compared Sanders to Clinton.  Why is it ""bad"" that Hillary Clinton-- or anyone else-- makes a lot of money as a public speaker?  Of the ways to argue in favor of Sanders and (presumably) against Clinton, this one seems most bizarre, because it's not hurting anyone and it's not immoral.  So as far as I can see, all it says is that one potential candidate is more in demand as a public speaker than another."

A person who makes millions from speaking engagements lives a different life than a person working 9-5 for $40k a year. It's not outside the realm of possibilities that the millionaire would not understand the world in the same way as the working stiff. Like Jeb said the other day ""people need to work harder"", well I'm sure that sounds reasonable to a rich person but a guy working 3 jobs to make ends meet might be a little pissed when told he isn't working hard enough. There is nothing morally wrong with having a silver spoon in your mouth but don't expect those without spoons to trust your judgement on the best way to acquire your first spoon."
progressive,3con4k,aknutty,3,Fri Jul 10 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, you're conflating two things here.  First, I agree with you that having a government made up of wealthy people seems like a bad thing.  And perhaps it is, although I'd be fairly quick to point out that most of our presidents have been far wealthier than the average US citizen.  That aside, I think how a person makes their money is as important as whether or not they have it.  Barack Obama is a millionaire, but he made his money literally through the sales of his books.  Jeb Bush comes from family money.  The Clintons-- both of them-- came from middle class families.  So this comment:   There is nothing morally wrong with having a silver spoon in your mouth but don't expect those without spoons to trust your judgement on the best way to acquire your first spoon.   Is actually a little misplaced if you're discussing Hillary Clinton.  Yes, she has millions of dollars now, but she hasn't always.  The ""silver spoon in the mouth"" analogy is not really all that apt in her case.  If you and others think Bernie Sanders is the answer to all our problems, that's fine.  If you want to promote him as a decent guy and a champion of the middle class, that's fine, too.  I happen to agree with some of that sentiment.  What I disagree with is the way things like this are being brought up.  Bernie Sanders's lack of financial assets that Clinton has is not a significant point in his favor, it's being brought up to try to make him look moral and selfless, and Hillary Clinton look greedy and selfish."

Yeah, he's not a former president like Bush (to whom i am no doubt alluding) but that doesn't mean one cannot gleam the stark contrast in the differences in character between the two based on the datum of what order of magnitude of money they charge for a speaking engagement.

These people grew up in an era of unprecedented (and unsustainable growth). The writing was on the wall in the late 70's and was readily apparent by the 80's, but people wanted Reagan's ""morning in America"" instead of facing the hard reality of the situation facing the nation.  Our parents chose the flashy, comfortable lie and some never looked back. Now, we are forced to live in a world of staggering wealth disparity, the kind not seen in the US since the Great Depression. This is not some unforeseen consequence that just happened to us, it is the direct result of the dismantling of what the Greatest Generation created by the Baby Boomers.  The concerted, systematic effort by those in power to reduce their tax burdens, dismantle regulations designed to protect the citizenry, ""plunder the coffers"" via out of control debt spending on frivolous corporate handouts while our infrastructure crumbles, and propagate the ""greed is good"" culture to a mind numbing degree has destroyed the gains of true economic progressives.

The fact that people think racism doesn't exist today, and that slavery doesn't have an economic effect on contemporary America is concerning, and this would be some gesture against that.  In addition, Sanders supported Jackson's campaign in 1988, which promised a policy of paying reparations for slavery. This policy is rather unpopular, but I believe it is the right thing to do, to compensate black people for the stolen labor of their ancestors. There is also precedent for this, as Reagan of all people gave compensation to the heirs of Japanese Internment sufferers."
progressive,3cmtp7,SweetNyan,0,Thu Jul 9 11:59:53 2015 UTC,"If we can award people reparations because of their ancestors, why can't we punish the children of Nazi's? I've never quite understood the reparations argument. If society isn't doing anything to help poor people, then I at least understand the want to help, but if there is valid welfare programs and education funding in place, then what's the point of reparations? Isn't a welfare state enough ""reparations"" to right previous wrongs?"
progressive,3cmtp7,fishgoblub,3,Thu Jul 9 15:31:35 2015 UTC,"Its not the same. Think of it like this. You benefited; were able to go to school, live in a nice neighborhood, etc. because of your father. Your father benefited because of his father, and so on. The proceeds (or at least PART of the proceeds) of their labor were given to them. They were able to receive (part of) the value of their labor. But for descendants of slaves, the product of their ancestors labor was stolen from them directly. Their descendants weren't able to benefit, because their work had been stolen, and none of the value was given to them.  A better analogy is this. Nazi Germany stole a great many paintings from people. Imagine if your great grandmother's painting had been stolen. Would it not be just for the painting to be returned? Would it not continue to be just for the painting to be returned, even a century later? Or how about if you worked hard and bought some jewelry, would it not be just for those jewels to be returned? In the same vein, it is just for the product of slave's labor to be returned to those it was stolen from.  No one is being punished here, we're simply righting the crime that was done centuries ago. In an ideal world, slavery reparations would have been paid out upon emancipation.  In addition, I'm not presuming this will right poverty or help those who are poor. Its simply a mark of justice for those who had their labor stolen from them."
progressive,3cmtp7,SweetNyan,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. I should have been more clear: I'm not saying that reparations are like punishing the children of Nazi's. I'm saying that I disagree with the notion that justice is served when righting a wrong based on someone's ancestors, unless it's actually your parents (then I suppose I see the argument for that, but am not 100% convinced). And I don't really agree with the use of emotional arguments that you used in order to come to the conclusion that reparations=justice. Maybe I'm not getting your point, though.  Justice would be taking from the slave owners and giving to the slaves. I agree that reparations would have ideally been paid upon emancipation, but neither one of those parties are still living. Saying that a wrong was righted because several generations later received payment for their slave ancestors doesn't seems like to a solution. If we're really wanting equivalent justice (and revenge essentially) then enslaving slave owners to the ancestors of former slaves is the only thing that's actually justice if justice can be exacted on ancestors, if we're taking your argument unqualified.  Also, I agree with your central argument that wealth inequality is a problem (when you were talking about ""part of the proceeds of their labor""). So things like a large estate tax would ensure that there is revenue for welfare (for example). I think that's more justice than reparations, which would be a one-time payment and it really wouldn't be justice in the long term, only helping one generation of ancestors."

It won't right the wrong of slavery any more than repairing a broken window catches the criminal who broke it, but it is returning what was stolen, which is an important part.  A welfare state is a great solution for poverty, but it has nothing to do with what I'm talking about, and benefits those who didn't descend from slaves too, which is irrelevant to the discussion.

This is a problem endemic to the system, not simply a matter of making more room for full time employees in the workforce.  It would be beneficial if politicians tried to address the core of a problem, rather than just generating sound bites regarding oversimplified symptoms of something much more complicated.  That said, this headline is quote-mining. I think it's clear what Bush meant, but the Democrats were eager to generate sound bites of their own."

progressive,3cmfoy,energylife,3,Thu Jul 9 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"In a statement, a Bush aide clarified that he was referring to the underemployed and part-time workers: “Under President Obama, we have the lowest workforce participation rate since 1977, and too many Americans are falling behind. Only Washington Democrats could be out-of-touch enough to criticize giving more Americans the ability to work, earn a paycheck, and make ends meet.”   “For several years now, they have been recklessly degrading the value of work, the incentive to work, and the rewards of work. We have seen them cut the definition of a full-time job from 40 to 30 hours, slashing the ability of paycheck earners to make ends meet,"" he said. ""We have seen them create welfare programs and tax rules that punish people with lost benefits and higher taxes for moving up those first few rungs of the economic ladder.”  A 2014 Gallup poll found that already many Americans employed full-time report working, on average, 47 hours a week, while nearly 4 in 10 say they work at least 50 hours a week.    So, the Gallup poll seems to contradict what Bush is saying. I will give you some anecdotal evidence from my 10,039 people town. I know about a dozen people who have a full-time, 40-hour a week job that also have a part-time job to make ends meet.   I don't know how the statistics gatherers count things, but if these people I know are being counted on their part-time job then it makes it appear there are a lot more underemployed people.  I assume Home Depot reports my colleague as a 25-hour a week employee. Does anyone cross check to see if those part-times have jobs elsewhere?  Another colleague had three 20-25 hr a week jobs until recently because that's all he could get in town. He now works 50 hrs a week at my place of employment and 20 hrs at another place. So, Target reports he's a part-timer and would be considered underemployed.  What I'm getting at is I think it's more about salary than hours worked. Millions of Americans don't get paid enough so they have to seek work elsewhere in a part-time job to supplement their full-time job."

This is not just wide-eyed naivete of a Sanders supporter, it is empirically verifiable, as evidenced by the efforts of the Clinton camp to cordon off journalists in order to control the message and thus craft the image. On the other hand, there have been no similar reports of Sanders doing the same thing and his slightly rumpled look speaks more about his passion-over-image ethos which many find attractive.

Obama spent all his (an extension of the Kennedy network's capital) making sure ACA passed.   I love Sanders, I really do. Perfect candidate. But let's be real here. If he ever got in office, he'd be a lame duck. He has virtually zero political capital and there's no way he's going to bully the GOP controlled house/congress into getting anything done.   On the other hand, like it or not, Clinton probably has the most political capital and political clout than anyone not just in the U.S, but in the world. Even with a non-functioning congress, she will still be able to get things (some things, anyways) done. And to me, that's really what matters. I'll vote for Sanders in the Primary but I'm voting for Clinton in the presidential election because she's clearly going to win the primary."

Sanders can be the reason people work together and finally get rid of the corporate shills in office and vote in people who will work for the masses. Without a leader nothing will get done, nobody will do anything. Sanders is a true leader."
progressive,3cjn63,SinkHoleDeMayo,3,Thu Jul 9 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but you clearly don't get it.   ""Getting it"" requires being a realist, a pragmatist. To be able to see the world for what it really is and think critically about it.   It's not the person with the most power that gets shit done   I'm sorry, but you're living in a fantasy land if you think the people with the most power in Washington aren't the ones getting it done. This isn't some opinion, but a fact of life. There's precedent; see the Carter presidency. The guy got in on hopes and dreams but had zero political capital and essentially kept the oval office chair warm for 4 years. He is considered a lame duck president for precisely the reasons I laid out above. Zero political capital. He even admits this himself.   it's the person who can inspire and motivate people to do something. Does one man win a war alone? No.   So you think he's going to inspire a GOP controlled congress to vote a certain way with passionate speeches or something? Without congress approving said changes and sending those bills to his desk, Bernie Sanders can't do a single thing to change anything. Again, you're living in a fantasy land if you believe Washington somehow works differently. The president is not a king or dictator, he has to work with congress to get things done. In most ways, he has less power than congress.  Which is another point that should be laid out: You can enact more change by voting out the neocon congressmen than you can by electing your perfect presidential candidate. That's why it's important to vote during the midterms.   Sanders can be the reason people work together and finally get rid of the corporate shills in office and vote in people who will work for the masses.   It's interesting to think you can vote out corporate shills. As long as lobbying is legal, corporate money will always be at play. It's like trying to ignore third base in baseball. You can't just ignore it. It's part of the game. To remove it, you would have to change the game itself, you would have to change the system. Bernie is not immune to corporate sponsors either.

We don't even choose who we vote for.  This is how it works:  We vote for whoever we want during the caucus. That tells our legislators how we want them to vote when they select a candidate to run for president. Then all the democrats get together at the national convention and select the person who will run on the democratic ticket.  Follow all that? Okay.  The politicians are in no way beholden to us. They are not required to vote for the candidate we ask them to vote for. It has already been demonstrated that politicians don't care what we think anyway. Politicians are owned by corporate interests that pay their reelection campaigns and generally pad political coffers.  To sum up: politicians select the candidate; politicians don't care what the people want; and politicians do the bidding of monied interests.  Okay, so when the actual presidential election comes along, Bernie won't even be a choice. The Money controls  the selection of the democratic candidate, not us.

progressive,3cjn63,bobodod,3,Thu Jul 9 14:14:44 2015 UTC,"It never was. The American Revolution was fought by a capitalist class locked out from political participation in a British parliament dominated by titled peers & their close class relations in the landed gentry. This was an era when the House of Lords still dominated British politics, and the Prime Minister (a relatively recent invention) was expected to be a Peer of the Realm.   The story of modern Britain has been the story of wealth, social prestige, and political power shifting from the titled nobility to the captains of industry. The American Revolution fits nicely within that story arc; the Sons of Liberty didn't have anything against tea or the nation that imported it - they were opposed to the Crown taxing their tea without giving wealthy colonial merchants any say.   I'm not one to discount Enlightenment ideals, but America was quite literally born of capitalism, and of merchant parentage. I see it as the natural & somewhat inevitable course of history rather than a damning indictment of American history.  The ends may end up justifying the means."

The problem is that Sanders is not really all that well known outside of the Northeast (and the Internet).  It's also that the Republicans will be able to play clips of Bernie Sanders saying he's a socialist with spooky music and scare an awful lot of people away from him just on that basis.  The problem is not that progressive ideas are unpopular, it's that the people who oppose them are winning the shit out of the messaging war and forcing progressives to play by their rules.  Remember how ""job creator"" became a phrase that wasn't instantly laughed at?  Between ""scary socialism"" and wedge issues like immigration, gun control / rights, health care, gay marriage, and abortion rights, the Republicans can manage to drive enough people to actively vote against their self interest.  Bernie Sanders doesn't have a chance unless the Republicans are stupid and end up nominating Rick Santorum or Ted Cruz.  Like it or not, Hillary is almost certainly the nominee.  She's polling well against the entire GOP field, and is nationally known not only because of her connection to Bill, but also her own formidable political background.  EDIT: Someone will probably pop up to tell me I'm a cynic and ""we don't need anyone posting these kinds of things anymore, we see them at least once in every thread.  Well, you see 'em because every ""Bernie Sanders can win"" thread seems to miss the point.  It's not that his ideas are unpopular, and it's not even that the man himself is unlikable.  It's-- unfortunately-- the fact that it will be all too easy for the GOP to tar him with a word that still is scary to a lot of people, even though they have no idea what socialism (and certainly not Sanders's brand of democratic socialism) actually is."

The problem is that neither party gives them what they want.  Democrats give a watered down version that people don't know whether to trust.  While Republicans mislead them with lies that explain why they are held back economically (Big Government! Washington Liberals!)  Regular folks want straight talkers who don't hold back, and who give them explanations of why America isn't working for them, not carefully parsed talking points.

The 1994 Federal Assault Weapon Ban had no effect on reducing gun ownership.

progressive,3cg0wb,R_B_Kazenzakis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:40:39 2015 UTC,"Correct. The fact that X is correlated with Y does not imply that X causes Y.   However, we're talking about a situation where someone is claiming that X causes Y, despite there being, at best, no correlation between X and Y, and at worst, the correlation being the reverse of what is claimed; X causing the inverse of Y.   The proposed theory is that more guns causes more crime. But, there isn't even a correlation of these factors, let alone a causal link, at least not when we look at the US as a whole. It might be true in certain, narrowly-defined contexts, but as a general rule, applied to the nation as a whole, it's patently false.   Consider two states, each with populations of 1 million.  Alpha and Bravo. Alpha has a carry rate of 3%, Bravo has a carry rate of 1%. The total population has a carry rate of 2%. There are a total of 20,000 guns being carried in our little nation. In 1993, Alpha has 20 murders, and Bravo has 12; a total of 32.   In 2015, the populations of the states are the same. Alpha now has a carry rate of 6%, and Bravo has a carry rate of 2%.  The total population has a carry rate of 4%. There are a total of 40,000 guns in the nation. Alpha has 5 murders and Bravo has 3, for a total of 8.  The authors of this study looked at data very much like this. Using their methodology, we could claim that because Alpha has both more guns and more crime than Bravo in both 1993 and 2015, more guns means more crime.  Hopefully, you can see the glaring flaw in their methodology.  They completely ignored the massive surge in gun ownership rates and carry rates over the past 22 years, and they completely ignored the massive drop in violent crime rates in both violent crime and gun crime rates over the same time period. When we actually consider those rates, we can only conclude that there is no correlation between number of guns and number of crimes, which is directly opposite OP's claim in the title.   The actual violent crime rate in the US has dropped from ~2200 incidences per 100,000 people to ~400 incidences per 100,000. The number of licensed concealed carriers - people actually carrying guns in public, not just leaving them locked in their safes - has increased from fewer than 1 million to more than 15 million. There probably isn't justification to claim that there is a causal link between the increasing number of guns and the decreasing number of crimes, but there is no rational basis to claim ""Instead, we found the opposite"".  As a broad generality, that counter-claim is patently absurd. That claim is only valid in certain extremely narrow contexts.   The only broad conclusion we can draw from the data on US carry rates is ""gun rate is not directly correlated with crime rate"".  Any subsequent conclusion to the contrary is necessarily false."

There isn't even a loose correlation between guns and crimes. That theory fails just as often as it succeeds, which means it's simply invalid.   There is a strong correlation between poverty rate and violent crime. There is a strong correlation between education rates and violent crime. Progressives tend to be on the correct side of each of these issues, and regressive Republicans are in the wrong. They're in the wrong on a wide variety of issues that would tend to increase violent crime rates and decrease public satisfaction.   Broadly adopting a pro-gun-control policy buys us a hell of a lot of opposition, and even if we're successful in enacting it, there's no strong evidence saying it will have any significant effect on violence.

Almost none of the proposed gun-control legislation of the last few years possesses much beyond the appeal-to-emotion, which is a travesty and yet it's often passed off as 'reasonable and 'common sense' because folks are SO desperately emotional due to how spooky some of these shootings are. We have to have the discipline to not pander to emotion and legislate off emotion.

This whole bullshit of ""Obama's gonna get your guns!"" is just another baseless claim perpetuated by the Right... and that fearmongering works!    Because it has happened.

progressive,3cg0wb,rivalarrival,-2,Wed Jul 8 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you that gun control has largely been dropped as a progressive issue. And, I agree that the ""Obama's gonna get your guns"" is overblown bullshit. But, there is an uncomfortable element of truth in that bullshit, and that's his support for Universal Background Checks.   The problem with UBCs is obvious when we substitute cars for guns. While it's illegal to provide cars to unlicensed drivers, the law only applies so long as the state can prove the car owner knew the ""buyer"" was unlicensed at the time of transfer. If he claims he didn't know, he can't be prosecuted.   So, you've got a neighbor with a number of friends and relatives who have gotten DUIs and had their licenses suspended, but he lets them drive his cars whenever they want. If they get caught, they go to jail, he keeps doing his thing.   UBCs try to address this by requiring car sellers to have their cars formally registered to the new driver before they are allowed to use them. So, your irresponsible neighbor supposedly has to go down to the DMV and register his car with the new driver. Failure to do so is its own crime, so he can now be prosecuted for transferring the car.   So far so good.   Now, you're hosting a birthday party at your home. You've got a couple dozen friends and family over. Your spouse asks you to run an errand. Maybe you've got to pick up a kid from soccer practice; maybe you've got to run to the grocery store. Either way, your car is blocked by three other cars in your driveway. Your friend just arrived and parked on the street, you tell him your predicament, and he tosses you his keys.   With UBC laws applied to cars, you and your friend just committed a felony. If you're stopped, both you and your friend will have your licenses suspended.   Forget the paranoia about gun registration. The fact that trading guns with my shooting buddies will be criminalized is why UBCs will never be tolerated by gun owners.   Fortunately, there is an alternative. We don't need to create a new duty for gun sellers. We simply need to make it feasible to enforce the existing prohibition against selling to criminals. The current law says you can't sell to felons. But, this law was created before the advent of NICS, the background check system we're currently using. This law was interpreted by the courts to mean ""It's unlawful to knowingly sell to felons."" This had to be done because there was no reasonable means for sellers to conduct background checks, and it would be a miscarriage of justice to prosecute a seller who was fooled by a felon. Because he's got no feasible means of doing it, we can't make it a duty for him to verify a buyer's status.   The answer, then, is simple: We simply need to make background checks available. When we do that, we can make it a duty for sellers to verify a buyer's status. But, we can only prosecute if we can prove that the seller did not fulfill this duty. We can only prosecute if the buyer is, in fact, a prohibited person. If he could have passed a background check at the time of transfer, the seller is presumed to have performed his duty.   tl;dr: With this alternative available, the only reason to continue supporting UBCs is for the chilling effect it creates for responsible gun ownership. The only reason to support Manchin-Toomey and comparable UBC plans is to enact back-door registration and/or criminalize inoffensive activities. Being aware of this alternative, I do see support for UBCs as an attack on responsible gun ownership."

Clinton's strategy is incremental progress, rather than promising everyone the world from the word go. Less sexy, more effective.  Clinton has infinitely more foreign policy experience, given that she was a celebrated Secretary of State for five years (not without controversy, but her tenure was still an extreme net positive). Her work was largely seen as damage control in the post-Bush era.  She's stronger on civil rights for women and minorities. Yes, even for gay people. Sanders may have been more unambiguously vocal in his support at an earlier stage, but he's never made civil rights a priority on the level that Clinton has. She's reached out to every major activist organization, making herself accountable. Sanders seems reluctant to do that.  And perhaps most importantly, Clinton has 20 years of experience dealing with Republican obstructionism. She might not aim as high, but she'll actually get more shit done.

He was a different kind of candidate, young and without a significant voting record. Iowa is in Feb 2016, and we now live in a world where FB and Twitter are much more present, people get a more of their news online.

Of course there will be people saying stupid things about the idea -that's normal- but there will be far fewer avenues to attack an idea that supports children than one which supports unemployed adults.

There's no ""common sense"" consensus, by any means, that 'assault weapons' or 'high capacity' magazines should be banned.  That's an outrageous notion that is clueless regarding the reality of the gun-rights debate in this nation.  Either he doesn't know that, and is therefore unacceptably ignorant, or he does know it but is simply pandering to his audience for applause/votes like a typical d-bag politician (that he's not supposed to be like, being as that a major part of his appeal is that he's 'different').    He agrees that there's 'no reason' to own 'assault weapons'?  Why do most police agencies carry them in their patrol cars these days?  Not just in SWAT vans for severe emergencies, but in the same patrol car that's in your neighbor's driveway while the officer takes that stolen-bicycle report.  Those officers, who are the ACTUAL experts on what kinds of threats that our criminal community poses to our communities right here inside our communities (not over in Afghanistan), deem them absolutely appropriate. Is there some magic shield running through our neighborhoods (like some kind of gerrymandering line) that separates that criminal community  from the rest of us?  No - there's not. So THAT is why it's nowhere near the truth that there's 'no reason' to own them. Talk to actual experts.  Not a one of them will agree with these ignorant notions.  5 minutes of research will reveal that.  Sanders has 5 minutes.  He's either not using them yet engaging the topic anyway, with ignorance, or he knows this and is simply pandering to his base.  Either way: yet another Politician.    I would vote for him over any other candidate out there because of his stance on just about everything, but he will lose my vote due to this position on guns.

If someone is willing to give away $5/mo on some charity, then why not give that to an organization that can probably distribute it way better, in my opinion, than the local church?

progressive,3buq1c,AnonymousChicken,10,Thu Jul 2 19:55:25 2015 UTC,"Let's suppose for a moment that he was able to win the nomination (which the Democrats will never let happen short of a miracle).  We can assume that the Republicans will probably end up running a relative moderate compared to their far right.  They won't let Cruz or Huckabee make it into the general.  The base may be ginned up for folks like that, but the fact is that the party leadership is cannier, they'll probably push for Bush.  An outside bet would put Rubio or Paul as options, but Bush is the safe bet in the long run.  He's a recognized name, he's not thought of by the general public as a raving psycho, and he has an established political record that doesn't make him look like he's totally incapable of compromise.  So, in all likelihood, if Sanders somehow got the nomination (which he likely won't) he'd be running against Bush.  Sanders's biggest weakness isn't his ideas, it's not his presentation of those ideas.  It's the fact that he has described himself as a democratic socialist.  Like it or not (and I personally like Sanders quite a bit) the term ""socialist"" is enough by itself to give the Republicans a foothold against him.  They'll wield that term like a bat, and there are enough people-- right and center-- who have a viscerally negative reaction to the idea of ""socialism"" that they will vote against Sanders if there's someone who's not a frothing lunatic that they can vote for.  Sadly, I don't think Bernie Sanders stands a chance, precisely because of the very things that I like most about him.  And even more sadly, I'm not willing to waste my vote trying to ""make a point"" by not voting Hillary if Sanders doesn't get the nomination, because the alternative to a Democrat in the White House is a Republican, and particularly with this Congress and all the recent rulings and executive orders that they would like to rip apart, that would hurt the US far more than having another centrist Democrat in the White House.  And you can downvote this post if you want (just like people are downvoting the other posts here that are less than just ""Bernie Sanders Fuck Yeah!"", but what a real progressive movement needs is discussion about why these ideas are popular, but why candidates who push them vocally tend to fail, or tend to walk them back after they're elected.  Downvoting criticism and alternative viewpoints instead of talking about them is just burying your head in the sand."

This is basically a repost of every other ""Sanders can't win the general"" post that gets tacked onto all of the posts about him.   Now, if you're truly sorry that he won't be the winner and he's someone you would vote for, why not stop repeating this already exhausted narrative and actually talk to people about what you perceive his weaknesses to be. Talk to people about his 12 policy points, explain what democratic socialism is and how it isn't communism and doesn't reject capitalism.

Time and time again, candidates make wild promises, get elected on the basis of those promises, and then don't deliver because, as it turns out, those things aren't nearly as easy to deliver on as their facile promises led idealists to believe.  At this point, Bernie Sanders has made some pretty tall promises, and frankly, I don't think he can keep a single one.  That's not to say that I don't think he wants to keep them-- I absolutely believe that he does-- but he can't.  And he's been in the federal government long enough to know that he can't keep them.  **EDIT: And downvoting me is childish.

I'm not seeing anyone else throwing up anything less wild. I know that Sanders at least believes what he says and will fight tooth and nail to implement them- I can't really trust Clinton to even try to implement her promises considering the number of times she was caught lying in the 2008 election. She'll push fracking, the NSA, and put in some token reforms on Wal St. and student loans that will ultimately mean nothing in the long run. She has no big ideas- she's basically a female Obama.  Despite what the polls are saying over year before the general election, I don't think Clinton can win the general election. She'll draw the committed democrats, but can she pull independents to the polls? That's the important question. She's been falling with independents recently and I think her numbers will only continue to drop. She's not inspiring, she's not charismatic. She doesn't draw people to her. Why would independents care about voting for another Obama? Why should they show up to the polls to support her? She's the establishment candidate that they rejected by not joining the party in the first place.  Only 12 states really matter in the election and many of them have been trending red lately. If she's against Bush, she'll probably lose Florida. She'll lose Ohio, Indiana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and West Virginia, Iowa, and Wisconsin. She'll win Nevada, Colorado, and Minnesota. Pennsylvania is a toss up. She won't have enough electoral votes. The DNC chose a poor candidate (and let's admit it, they chose her as their nominee years ago).   ""Socialist"" is pretty much the only smear the GOP has against Sanders, but they've been prepping to fight Clinton for over a decade. The general election is going to be brutal for her because she is so vulnerable in so many areas of her public and personal life. Sanders has promise to run a clean fair campaign- can the GOP even run a smear campaign against a man who openly compliments some of them individually and won't attack someone's character? They'll look like even bigger assholes. I think you're very wrong about which candidate is more vulnerable in the general election.  Sanders also has the appeal of an outsider. Numerous times I've seen people on Reddit say they're libertarians, moderate Republicans, Green Party, non-partisan and they will vote for Sanders or they're not showing up at the polls. Sanders' idea have appeal across some political and ideological perspectives. He also gives people the assurance that he believes in his words and he will follow through with them to the best of his ability.   If this has made no impact on you at all, then just listen to this: saying he can't win is a repost that adds nothing to the conversation. It's been stated numerous times whenever an article is posted about him. You don't think he can win. You're giving the same reasons everyone else gives. It's about as useful as when people post ""This."" or ""I agree"". If you have new information, then by all means, tell us.

And if I'm giving similar reasons to everyone else, it's because they're real reasons that Sanders will probably fail to get the nomination.  If he does, great, it'll be because I and a whole bunch of other people voted for him in the primaries.  I'll vote for the guy despite his pie in the sky rhetoric, he clearly believes it and that's worth giving him a shot at winning in the general.  But it's almost certain that he won't get that shot.

Hillary would keep gitmo open, support the tpp, be a foreign policy hawk, do nothing to reform the police or broken windows policing, do nothing to reign in wall street, do nothing to stop mass deportations, etc etc. She didn't even support gay marriage until very recently.

The recent landmark decisions by the SCOTUS should be enough to emphasize the importance of that branch of the government.  The most significant thing President Obama has done in his tenure in office is to appoint Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor to the bench of the SCOTUS.  The next president will likely have a chance to appoint several justices.  Scalia, Ginsburg, and Kennedy are probably nearing retirement.  That's one reliable conservative, one reliable liberal, and one centrist who often is the deciding vote.

With the continuous movement toward lunacy they're on, nominating a moderate candidate could split their vote even more or alienate the far-right enough to give Bernie a victory.  If the republicans go too far right, they alternate those more moderate voters who I think could stomach voting for Bernie. He had plenty of support in Vermont from Republicans and for good reason.

My point is that it's weird to say ""I get to decide which laws to uphold and which to break, because I have a higher moral code.""  That's what Cruz is saying here.  And that's what people who support marijuana legalization are saying.  Why do we get to cherry-pick when to use states' rights as a shield?  I'd just like to have a stronger reason for both. Because right now it seems a bit hypocritical from both ends.  Edit: I suppose a not insignificant distinction is that it's the supreme fucking court making a decision about a current issue.

However, denying a group equal rights based on religious belief is in fundamental opposition to secular democracy.   edit: It was always my impression that the constitution gave the federal government the power to regulate interstate commerce, which is where they've traditionally derived their power for drug enforcement, although i'm not sure if there have ever been any supreme court rulings specifically on the federal intrastate regulation of drug sales.  edit 2: Apparently there was a case before the supreme court about 10 years ago in which they ruled that the federal government is allowed to prosecute people growing small amounts of marijuana because it's possible that it would affect interstate commerce. I'm generally not a fan of Clarence Thomas, but I completely agree with his dissenting opinion:   If the Federal Government can regulate growing a half-dozen cannabis plants for personal consumption (not because it is interstate commerce, but because it is inextricably bound up with interstate commerce), then Congress' Article I powers – as expanded by the Necessary and Proper Clause – have no meaningful limits. Whether Congress aims at the possession of drugs, guns, or any number of other items, it may continue to ""appropria[te] state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce."""

There's not much legal repercussions if the state just refuses to prosecute. It's a victimless crime.

The argument that the civil war could have been avoided by buying up all the slaves and setting them free is disingenuous - the millions of slaves owned by the southern states were not so much a unit of labor that had economic value; but rather an institution defining the south's culture.

progressive,3bjegn,ustrinanongrata,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"Rambling incoming as someone who used to watch TV pretty much as a hobby but now does not:  Honestly, I think the problem is just the format of network television. If something doesn't perform well enough for its screentime immediately, it's taking up valuable airtime that can be filled with something more profitable. So things get canned early, before stories have a chance to pay off or shine. That means you either get shows that don't get to complete their stories, or shows that were created to keep adding on on the fly with no overall plans for payoff. That hits at anything sequential pretty hard, so you're left with shows that you don't have to follow every episode to get. But unless those shows are good, there's nothing to keep large audiences coming back week after week, religiously. So they suffer as well. When they're expensive to make, it's no longer worth it. Even reality shows suffer in the long run, even though they cost less. The Honey Boo Boos and Duggars of TV are mostly on cable where they have a bit of buffer room, and those shows are even cheaper to produce.  Pretty much it's a flawed setup and the second a viable alternative model with a lot of accessibility came around, they were finished."

It conveniently forgets to mention that in the majority opinion, they placed the blame on botched executions not on the government, but on abolitionist groups for making accessible drugs so hard to find.   Remember to keep in mind that by making these drugs less available, you are making states choose between either eliminating the death penalty, or reinstating more traditional methods of capital punishment.   I agree with the dissenting opinion that this drug should be eliminated. I agree that it is excessively painful, but not only that, expensive and unnecessary. On the other hand, death by firing squad or hanging, at least compared to how the plantiff describes lethal injection, is far less painful.  I also find it difficult to that the death penalty will ever be eliminated by the supreme court. I've always viewed the 8th amendment as basically saying ""don't torture people."" This is probably closer to what the founders meant. Washington himself signed death sentences for people, and though he argued for its restriction, he did not argue for its abolition.   Lastly, I can't see us getting rid of the death penalty any time soon after the Boston bomber case. If he had been tried under Massachusetts law, the max penalty would have been life in prison. The people of that jury who live in that state chose the death penalty. I think in certain cases similar to that one the majority of people will still support the death penalty. Not even the high number of death row exonerations will temper that thirst for bloody justice, particularly in extreme cases."

In short it envisioned the US in control of a mid-east country and dropping in full-blown US consumerism. A McDonalds on one corner, a Bank of America on the next, and a Walmart in between.  The idea was that the people of this imagined country would be enthralled by all of the accoutrements of western life. And, of course, there would be oil to finance the neon and glitter. The controlling nation (presumably us) would have a cultural, economic, and military foothold in the middle of the middle east. The beauty and prosperity instilled upon this reborn country would act as an example to all of its neighbors prompting them to mimic this transformation.  It's not hard to envision that such a tale of win-win-win would have the likes of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld drooling at the opportunity to try such a scheme. Instead we've seen, if that was the intention for Iraq, good plan or not, it certainly went brown and runny very, very fast.   I've looked long and hard for this Day One plan and it has vanished, at least from the web. The US put a bounty of $25 million on Saddam Hussein. It went unclaimed.

Arsonists hit at least 3 Southern congregations in the last 7 days   On Monday, someone set fire to College Hills Seventh Day Adventist Church in Tennessee, according to local WATE. The arsonist placed bales of hay outside the church doors and lit them ablaze, fire officials told the station. They also burned the church van.  On Tuesday, God’s Power Church of Christ in Georgia was intentionally set on fire, authorities told ABC News. Electronics and other equipment were also stolen in the early morning fire. Authorities told reporters there is “no evidence” of a hate crime.  On Wednesday, Briar Creek Baptist Church in North Carolina burned in the middle of the night, causing $250,000 in damage, NBC News reports. Authorities are investigating whether the intentional blaze was a hate crime. It took 75 firefighters to bring it under control.  On Friday, Glover Grove Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina, was virtually destroyed in an overnight blaze, the Aiken Standard reports. While the cause of the fire is still under investigation, the FBI has been called in."

I am a Progressive but am actually unplugging from those people and that movement.  Recently I made the mistake of disagreeing with the hivemind on a recent controversy that they are by and large seriously ill-informed about.  In my efforts to educate them, I went against their status quo for the first time and received the most strenuous abuse / epithets possible for the crime of peacefully disagreeing and laying out rational arguments / evidence.  I finally understand why ""liberal"" is considered by many to be a dirty word in the United States.  Many are just nasty bigots in their own right.

I am a history buff with Confederate ancestors and at one time I did some Civil War reenacting.  I have read countless books on this subject in the last 30 years.  I am familiar with its historical context.  I did not argue with them when they said this flag should be taken down from government buildings.  The problem I had was that they then made the claim that the Confederate flag should be taken down everywhere - at reenactments, in computer games, or just in some random guy's backyard or on his Lynnyrd Skynnrd T-shirt.   It should never be displayed, they said, because it's automatically hate speech, racist, and white supremacist.  Therefore anyone even owning one, even for historical purposes, just wants to hurt the feelings of all black people / oppress them into bondage / exterminate them just like white supremacist BowlCut Dipshit did in that church.    So no matter what context the owner of the flag was using it in, it was always racist and he is a racist.  Period.  They said that alot when trying to make their opinion come off like some royal proclamation.    Except that plenty of Southerners just display this flag as a symbol of pride in their ancestors and have no enmity toward blacks whatsoever.  At one point in the '80's it was just a silly generic symbol of southern pride - no different than a mascot at a football game.  Hell, there was a tv show (Dukes of Hazzard) that featured this flag on the protagonists car.  It was borderline meaningless.  But in 2015, it means you're looking to shoot up some black folks just because Captain Nutball did and HE HELD A FLAG IN A PICTURE, OMG!!!!  There's a lot more to it but the upshot is that they wanted to tell me what to think about the flag that my Great Great Grandfather fought under... even though I know EXACTLY what it meant to him because he made it VERY clear that he only fought to protect his home and hated slavery as well as the Confederate government.  But the SJW's kept insisting that he was just a racist piece of shit - and that I too was a horrible racist as I tried to explain that this flag means many different things to different people.  That the context and the heart of the person owning it are pretty important in determining if that person is indeed a 'racist'.   So here I am, having promoted awareness of all these unarmed black people being shot by racist police... but none of that counts because of a piece of cloth that I own and do not even display.  And I am on the outs with all of them after all that effort I spent trying to convince conservative family and friends that there's horrible systematic racism in America.

So they had to find a Black Conservative who would be high enough in the judiciary to fit. Probably the only person to fit in was Thomas: he had been elected to the Court of Appeals the year before precisely by Bush from some government position.

progressive,3basvz,Decolater,7,Sat Jun 27 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, so lets go with this.  Thomas says:   ...that human dignity is innate and suggests instead that it comes from the Government.   Let's accept that it is innate.  Should the government be able to take it away?  If the Constitution does not grant dignity, does the Constitution prevent the state from putting laws and regulations in place that impact that innate dignity?  Case in point.  Should I be prevented from having my name on the death certificate?  Should I be prevented from being an equal parent to my children?  Those are two very basic human dignity issues where the state has enacted laws that deny me that dignity.  So if Thomas is correct, that the Constitution does not give me dignity, he should also accept that the Constitution prevents the state from taking away my human dignity.  He gets around this by claiming that it cannot be taken away.  Therefore, any thing that the state wants to do, that is not expressly forbidden by the Constitution, is a-okay.    Since the state does not give me dignity, and my dignity cannot be taken away (read his quote), then all laws are okay that put restrictions on one particular class of persons.  I do not get this line of thinking as it runs counter to John Locke's concept of natural law.  Basically our constitution was formed around Locke's thinking that no one (government) should interfere with another's life, health, liberty, or possessions.  So for Thomas and the other three to accept the prohibition on marriage is constitutionally okay, ignores the fact that not only is dignity impacted by the state, but the state is interfering with another's liberty and possessions.  I just don't get it."
progressive,3basvz,FaustTheBird,3,Sat Jun 27 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Thank you for actually taking the time to reason this out like a good citizen instead of jumping immediately on the equivocation bandwagon like the top 5 comment threads!  This article is a complete sensationalization of what appears to be an attempt at solid legal thinking. I'll play the devil's advocate here, as I'm interested in understanding this myself.  The Supreme Court's job in a case like this is to determine if a law is in violation of the terms set forth in the Constitution. ONE of the arguments against DOMA was that it negatively impacted the human dignity of those individuals denied the capacity to marry. In this excerpt, Justice Thomas is arguing that no law could affect human dignity because human dignity is not a legal concept in Constitutional law. Nowhere in the Constitution or its amendments can we find the term ""dignity"". Therefore, as a legal argument, a law cannot be declared unconstitutional due to the concept. In this sense, slavery was not unconstitutional due to an argument from human dignity, but possibly for other reasons. In the same sense, the imprisonment of those of Japanese descent in the US during WWII was not unconstitutional based on human dignity but possibly for other reasons.  This is important because if the Supreme Court writes an opinion that states that the government can take away dignity by legislating, it dehumanizes people. A slave could still be dignified. A slave could stare an owner down with dignity by choice, despite the consequences. An individual wrongly imprisoned still retains their humanity and their human dignity. To say otherwise would be to create a potentially dangerous legal fiction where something inherent in an individual's character and completely within the control of that individual is now recognized to be something that can be taken.  This particular dissent may have been enough to argue for dismissal of one of the causes of action against DOMA. I don't believe it was sufficient to dismiss the entire complaint. But I think I can see a charitable way to read this particular part of Thomas's dissent."
progressive,3basvz,Decolater,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"If Thomas' argument is this:   Nowhere in the Constitution or its amendments can we find the term ""dignity"". Therefore, as a legal argument, a law cannot be declared unconstitutional due to the concept.    Then it is faulty.  I understand it, but I disagree.  Let's start at the Declaration of Independence:   We hold these truths to be self-evident ...endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.   This brings forth ""unalienable Rights"" which are defined as:   Natural rights are those not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable (i.e., rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws)   If we understand that to be true, then any law that interferes with my natural rights interferes with my unalienable Rights.  The fact that Jefferson removed Locke's ""property"" and replaced it with ""happiness"" means that the Epicurus meaning of happiness was what he was going for and not the protection of possessions obtained by one's labor.  Jefferson, being a learned man, had to understand the difference between Locke and Epicurus.  He had to have been aware of how Epicurus spoke about happiness:   “the end of all our actions is to be free from pain and fear, and once this is obtained the tempest of the soul is quelled.”    So you have ""unalienable Rights,"" ""happiness,"" and ""promote for the general Welfare"" in the two documents that we based our laws on.  And Thomas is going to conclude that ""Nowhere in the Constitution or its amendments can we find the term ""dignity""?  Now let's look at the start of the Declaration of Independence:   We hold these truths to be self-evident,   Thomas, not understanding Jefferson or the term ""self evident"" would not be surprising.  The fact that we had to add to the Constitution a Bill of Rights acknowledges the fact that even back then the basic principle of the government not impinging on life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness needed to be spelled out.  Which then adds to the belief that if it aint specifically in there - the words - it aint gonna make it unconstitutional.  The term ""welfare"" is in there.  The basic olden day definition is:   Exemption from misfortune, sickness, calamity or evil; the enjoyment of health and the common blessings of life; prosperity; happiness; applied to persons.   To promote for the general welfare must have been understood to have the meaning defined above.  I am going to claim bullshit regarding the argument that the word ""welfare"" is used in the context of states and not persons as some contend.  Life and Liberty are distinct to humans, so welfare must also be for the person as well.  So there you have my argument that dignity should not be impinged by the state as it interferes with a citizen's general welfare which our laws are supposed to promote or be limited.  DOMA did just that for no other reason then some other citizens think it is wrong for two men or two women to marry.  Thomas is wrong."
progressive,3basvz,cantdressherself,2,Sun Jun 28 12:47:49 2015 UTC,"Great response!  AFAIK, the Declaration of Independence is not a foundational legal document and does not constitute legal precedent nor provide an cause for action by any court.  Having said that, I do believe that the US recognizes natural and unalienable rights as a legal construct, but I don't believe that marriage is so construed, as marriage appears to be considered a legal construct. Further, that legal construct is entirely regulated by states. You can't get a marriage license from the federal government. So, DOMA seems to be an overreaching of federal power, as it redefined marriage at a federal level which had traditionally been defined purely by each individual state as they saw fit. It also allowed states to ignore each others marriage licenses if the couple was homosexual.  I believe that the unconstitutionality of DOMA could be demonstrated without arguing for a loss of dignity as a cause of judicial action. And if it is possible to do so, I believe it should be done that way for what I believe the charitable reading of this excerpt of Thomas's dissension seems to point to: the federal government does not interact with human dignity, and probably should not.  However, I disagree with Thomas's position that DOMA is not unconstitutional, and I agree with your final position that Thomas is wrong. I'm just not convinced that he's wrong specifically because of the conjecture that marriage licenses confer dignity and denial of marriage licenses strips dignity."

""Moral, ethical, legal, and political discussions use the concept of dignity to express the idea that a being has an innate right to be valued, respected, and to receive ethical treatment. In the modern context dignity can function as an extension of the Enlightenment-era concepts of inherent, inalienable rights.""  So Thomas believes all humans have an inherent right to be valued and respected and that they retain those rights even when enslaved or when gays are denied their right to marry, but he doesn't think we ought to do anything about it.  Hence he is confused."

I would press this a little further and argue that Thomas is using rose-tinted glasses to view slavery through a Kunta Kinte or Uncle Tom's Cabin lense; some slaves were so thoroughly degraded by the institution of slavery, they betrayed their fellow slaves who sought to rebel (as in Gabriel's rebellion) or sought to escape (Harriet Tubman threatened to shoot any slave who turned back on the Underground Railroad).

All while massively increasing the profits of said companies and handing them a guaranteed monopoly.   Anyone who actually read the bill knows it is a lobbyists wet dream, a wolf in sheep's clothing.  We need a true modern healthcare system like so many other countries, not this corporate fascists excuse for healthcare.    The pope re-frames our responsibility towards reversing climate change as a ""moral issue"" and comes out staunchly in support for all of the established science on climate.   As nice as that is, religion of all forms is a blight upon the world, and a few statements from the current Pope doesn't forgive 1000 years of (not to mention the continued practice in many places of) rape, torture, slavery, pedophilia, colonialism, scientific denial, child abuse, and exploitation.  I would hardly consider this a victory.  Also why the fuck do we care that a religion is endorsing the scientifically obvious fact?  The bigger news is when the scientists announce it, the Pope and all other religious institutions feelings are irrelevant (even in realistic terms they are far from meaningful).    Now, the Supreme Court declares laws banning same-sex marriage as unconstitutional in all 50 states.   Ok, I'll grant you that is a SMALL victory, but outlawing bigotry never eradicates it, and there are still many others being downtrodden and exploited every day that have far less powerful lobbies to represent them (the poor, hungry, homeless etc.)"

It is people like these that do give everyone a bad name-- but they are out there, and so when these internet memes claim only 2% defraud the system.  I think if you include the people selling them or not bein honest about other income sources, I would guess it's closer to 15-20% and I understand, poor people are poor and they got to make it somehow.  I can't say that if I was on assistance and someone (like a friend, Boyfriend, or relative) was paying a bill or two to help me out, I would probably keep that to myself, but technically the State wants to figure that in to your budget and that would lower your benefit amount.

If you work in a position where you know what they receive, and how they're using it / abusing it, then you should also be reporting it.

No other source of money other than selling his food stamps which are close to $600 a month.   Note-- I said alcoholic.  He drinks a pint to a 5th every day or he gets so sick he needs to go to the hospital.  Notice I said he didn't have any income.  How do you think he is getting his  daily smokes and drink?   Sells them to his neighbors that are also getting their apartment for free, but don't get food stamps.   They take more of his benefits than he likes though, so he has told me his family has been short on food at the end of hte month every month for the past 5 months and he also has to use a food pantry.    He wouldn't have to use the food pantry if he didn't sell his fucking food stamps.  He's the worst one.   Dumping out pop for the returnable can to buy cigarettes.   I have known him for 20+ years and he didn't use to be like this, but now he is pretty much just a degenerate and a scum-bag.   I have offered to watch his kids that are 11, 13 for a few weeks in order for him to detox and go in to rehab, but he refuses.   He shouldn't have his kids with him, but their mom is much worse amazingly and there are no other suitable relatives.   I'm not calling to have those kids put in the system, that's someone elses job.   CPS has been to the house 4 times this year from the School and others calling.

Now, the GOP has a field of 20 already and it really is hard to pick out which one makes me the most nauseated at the thought that they've filled out the paperwork and paid the fees to make them eligible to run for POTUS. No matter how statistically insignificant... they all are technically one step closer to the office of POTUS.   The GOP primaries has been turned into a get-rich-quick scheme and boy does it draw out the loons all looking for a free book tour and to cash in on that PAC money that they get to shove in their pocket at the end of the day.

I differ from classical liberals in the way that I believe it's the governments responsibility to provide all citizens with their basic necessities and I believe in regulated economies albeit with a core capitalist market. Next off I'm a progressive because I want change. Simple as that. The middle class has lost it's voice due to the top 1% getting whatever they want(I blame you saint Reagan) and that needs to change.

We need to remove this power from them. Making them say progressives diminishes their tirades.  It's harder to rail against people who are moving forward than the bogeyman liberal caricature they use now.  Progressive is more positive word, it's simply harder to denigrate.   ""Fucking Progressives want to change everything"" sounds a lot stupider than ""Liberals are destroy your values.""  We don't want to change everything but progress is inevitable and we clearly favor it. Making progress a negative concept is less possible on a grand scale. Without progress, we wouldn't be typing phones right now, be to get around as easily, to access information more readily, or even turn on lights.  Progress is almost always positive.

Moreover, the Act elsewhere defines “State” so as to exclude the federal government from that definition. Thus the petitioners (those attacking the Act) argue the language is plain, and that subsidies are not available for the residents of those states, about 2/3rds of all states, who rather than establishing their own exchanges, instead let their citizens rely on the federally established Exchange for their insurance plans. Since it is generally agreed that among the many (and often conflicting) canons of statutory construction, the clear plain meaning of what a law says holds a preferred place, the argument that subsidies are unavailable to those who purchase insurance on the federal exchange is, without more, a strong one"

Those are all reasons why the incentives for these CEOs might be misaligned which is perfectly valid but does not address the underlying question in my post. If you think the CEO of a company is overpaid or is not being incentivized properly, then you have the option to not buy shares of the company. As long as their are people who want to buy those shares, they are tacitly agreeing to the compensation of the CEOs."

To me that's a good enough to look at all of the things that are wrong.  1 The well being of the country should not be based on the stock market.  2 Most people don't have the resources to invest in the market and most of those that do are looking for a quick high return.  3 When you're making that kind of money it's not about the money any longer. It's ego, or winning, or something else. Businesses might as well issue chips after a certain amount.  4 Personally I believe the best (and easiest) answer would be to go back to something more in line with FDR's solution - 94% tax on income over what today would be $250,000. The fat cats could still get satisfaction from their gross earnings and the country would have the funds to devote to infrastructure, cancer research, or any number of other benefits enjoyed by other nations looking for long term good."

If they didn't have such good benefits which I apparently can't get anywhere else, like healthcare that's $200 a month for a family and I never pay more than $1000 per year, max, I'd quit, and so would a lot of other guys.   I'm just pissed they sent an email at all. Had no email gone out, I'd think nothing of getting the same sized bonus as always. Instead they now have a bunch of pissed off employees.

The essence of the problem with CEO compensation is that the owners of our public corporations, primarily institutional investors, who own more than 70% of the stock, have very little incentive either to make long-term investments in companies or actively serve on their boards of directors. This means that the owners of our public corporations are seldom actively involved in corporate governance or in closely monitoring executive compensation. If they are unhappy with a company they usually just sell their stock. Instead the burden falls almost entirely on the directors, who are effectively self-elected, since institutional investors seldom oppose the board’s slate of directors. The outside directors of most of our corporations also seldom have large ownership stakes in the companies they serve.   source: https://hbr.org/2009/06/why-high-ceo-pay-is-bad-business/"

progressive,3b2sqh,xjr562i,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"I dislike the way people use the word ""conspiracist"" or ""conspiracy theory"". First, the word conspiracy has a literal meaning that we should use. Second, the vast majority of crimes are literal conspiracies -- hardly surprising considering that crimes committed by one person have to be pretty simplistic crimes.  But third, just this week on Reddit I read an article which featured a document that the term ""conspiracy theorist"" was invented by the Vietnam-era CIA as a term to mindlessly smear someone/group and to cause their views/claims to be dismissed. In other words, the term that we routinely use was created as propaganda as a way of dismissing or obscuring things the government did not want talked about.  But to your point: I don't know why you should not be sure. Forget Clinton repealing the Glass-Steagall Act that directly lead to Bush's housing bubble and financial implosion; I also remember Bill Clinton signing the law which abolished the American people's right to cash payments if they were poor (aka ""welfare""), a right enjoyed since FDR invented it in the Great Depression.   The rich people who fund both the Democratic and Republican parties, who de facto control our government and who explicitly control our economy, disagree on some things. But on other things they have very similar ideas. It shouldn't be surprising that they have the politicians they bankroll push agendas to enact policies reflecting those ideas.  No conspiracy ""theory"" there -- simple greed and self-interest explains that.   ""In politics, nothing happens by accident.

That said, it's fascinating to me that his whole point was that not accepting saying the word doesn't accomplish ending racism, and everybody just went straight to not accepting the word.  I've been really disappointed in the bulk of the coverage which has focused 100% on the phrasing rather than the point he was making."

progressive,3ato53,IHappentobeBlack,9,Tue Jun 23 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"Also Stiglitz's white paper for The Roosevelt Institute: ""Reforming Taxation to Promote Growth and Equity""    This white paper outlines concrete policy measures that can restore equitable and sustainable economic growth in the United States, in the context of the country’s recurring budgetary crises. Effective policies are within our grasp, because these budgetary crises are the result of political and not economic failings. Tax reform in particular offers a path toward both resolving budgetary impasses and making the kinds of public investments that will strengthen the fundamentals of the economy. The most obvious reform is an increase in the top marginal income tax rates – this would both raise needed revenues and soften America’s extreme and harmful inequality. But there are also a variety of other effective possible reforms related to corporate taxation, the estate and inheritance tax, environmental taxes, and ensuring that the government gets full value when it sells public assets. This white paper describes the gravity of the economic situation in the United States, but also shows that there is a way out.   The current economic situation in the United States is grave, with extreme inequality, persistently high unemployment, and GDP growth far below potential, to name just a few problems. But the barriers to a solution are political, not economic. Reforms to corporate and personal income taxes will be essential in restoring economic vitality. Examples include implementing financial transaction taxes; increasing corporate tax rates while incentivizing investment in the U.S. and closing loopholes; increasing taxes on rent-seeking; reforming estate and inheritance taxes; and making personal income taxes more progressive. All reforms must be made with the understanding that deficit reduction in and of itself is not a worthy goal. Rather, taxation must be reformed to help grow the economy, improve distribution, and encourage socially beneficial behavior on the part of firms and individuals."

The Bush II tax cuts are a perfect example: the middle class got nothing while the wealthy had their taxes cut so much that now rich CEOs pay a lower tax rate than the middle class, thanks to special tax treatments on things like capital gains, dividends, hedge fund income, etc.  The result is the GOP only caters to the 1 percenters and shafts everyone else in the process.

She is a shoe-in statistics-wise but she has a pretty rough history to be honest. The democratic party has become the party of the young while the GOP is the party of the old. She's been unhelpful and even against young-people things in the past. Hillary is anti gaming industry (she's one of those that believes violent games are to blame for everything), she very quickly dropped her attempt at national healthcare legislation when she was bought off by insurance lobbyists (back when Bill was Pres.), and she's been involved in numerous scandals ranging from crazy stuff about having people whacked to more legitimate Nixon-esque scandals that had her subpoenaed and even fingerprinted.   But I think what actually bothers young liberals like myself though is just her personality. There's something very fake about her, very contrived and intentional. Frankly she just comes off as this house-of-cards like caricature. The whole DC power-couple thing just stinks a little too much of oligarchy for a lot of people's tastes.

How can I say that with such confidence when I advocate what you would probably describe as jackbooted government oppression? I recognise that there is more to freedom than a theoretical, on-paper right to do something. Freedom is also limited by the availability of resources, and money, and time, to mention just a few things.   For example, let's say you work two jobs in order to barely support yourself day-to-day. You have next to no free time and certainly no spare energy. You work like this or you go hungry and homeless. Would you consider yourself free to pursue an education, or make things, or pursue a business opportunity such as a startup, even if these things were given to you free of charge? Would you even be able to pursue basic stuff like maintaining your home, cooking and eating healthily, or simply spending time outdoors? No. None of these are options you can take.   Compare that to a situation in which you make the same income from investments. Almost your entire day is free to study, or pursue whatever work and business you desire, or just sit around gazing at clouds.   In both cases, you have the theoretical freedom to pursue any of the things I've mentioned, and a great many more. But only in one can you actually do so. I'm all about maximising actual, practical freedom. You, on the other hand, don't give a fuck about that. I suspect it's a result of the authoritarian-follower mindset that, hilariously, is never far from the surface in right-libertarians; the important thing to you is that you're granted permission to do something, rather than the reality of going out and doing it."

What you described is pretty much government run economy where even working two jobs doesn't make you enough money, because government has devalued the money through unlimited printing and borrowing and having trillions in deficits!   But freedom is freedom. In freedom you won't have government, you'd be free to make your own choice, start a business with no strings attached, you can open up a stand and sell lemonade, sell food, sell drinks, sell icecream whatever you want no strings attached! That easy!  How wealthy and successful you are depends on you, your hard work or your intelligence or your ingenuity determines that!   Freedom is freedom, for example working at a sweat shop is freedom! People chose to work there, even young kids as young as 10yo because the alternatives are: child sex prostitution or death!   How you build society is you build it up in time, you can't start from scratch and have USA style economy. USA needed basically 100 years of the most freedom on earth compared to other countries to build all the wealth and prosperity!   The USA didn't start with factories and shops everywhere, it started with hard working farmers who worked as much as 16 hours a day, and as they kept on working and working and expanding their business and this is over their lifetime they could go from 16 hours to 14 to 12 to 10 hours, eventually down to the 8 hours we have now!  But you have to have freedom to reach a level of prosperity and wealth!  THE PROBLEM WITH FREEDOM IS THAT IT CREATES SO MUCH WEALTH, SO MUCH PROSPERITY, PEOPLE BECOME DECADENT AND IGNORANT, THEY FORGET WHAT MADE THEM WEALTHY, WHAT MADE THEM PROSPEROUS AND DECIDE TO BASICALLY GIVE THEMSELVES FREE GOODIES BY USING GOVERNMENT AND THIS LEADS TO MISERY AND FAMINE.

Like if you have 5 apples and government takes 3, you have less apples. No source required for that! That is taxation! Basic explanation!  Now can you stay fed for longer with 5 or 2 apples? Its pretty simple! Every apple the government takes from you, you are shorter on apples.   The more apples that remain in the private sector the better off everyone will be. Government doesn't know when you need to eat and what type of food you want, you may want 1 apple, you may want 2 oranges, you may want 3 potatoes. Only you know you, only you know what you want/need!   Another example: If you have 10 apples, government can't decide what is most efficient use for you to be fed, some will be full with 1 apple, others with 2 apples, some may need 5 apples.   Now apply this simple concept with money, government has no idea how to best and most efficiently spent money, thus distorting the market. They take from the market, market now has less, this means less production, less jobs, higher prices, etc... Even if government spreads the ""apples"" they don't know what is the best way to spread them and at what time!"

progressive,3an7ca,Bing_bot,-3,Sun Jun 21 22:02:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know the cuts he'd make, but you can easily cut major government programs and sections to balance the budget.  You can cut 300 billion in the defense budget easily, if its over say period of 4 years its going to transition smoothly, you can cut subsidies which amount for up to 100 billion, you can cut medicaid and medicare for over 100 billion just by reducing waste, reducing redundant bureaucracy and putting more importance on private healthcare!   You can reduce the social security by at least 50 billion by removing people on the list who are worth a lot. You can remove every person who is worth more than 500k and reduce the social security for everyone who is more than 250k and you can save at least 50 billion.  You can remove all the foreign aid which amounts close to 50 billion as well, you can shut down the ""embassies""(fortresses) in many of the countries that are as big as whole city blocks, for example the embassy in Iraq is bigger than the Vatican, the new embassy in Britain is bigger than the royal palace, there are so many of these new ""embassies"" that are gigantic. You sell or at least stop using them and start using smaller houses in over 40 difference countries that have these new ""embassies"" and you can probably save at least 1-2 billion.  You can cut programs like robotic squirrels and studying aquarium fish how they mate and those and save over 50 million.   So right there you have over 652 billions saved. And lower taxes across the board would mean more money stays in the private sector, which means more production, more expansion, more hiring, etc... which would translate into more taxes in the medium and long term.  You might have immediate a lot less taxes, but over time as the money stays in business and people's hands, you will get more investments, more production, more commerce, etc... and that ends up in more taxes."

Spending less, decreasing the number of publicly provided benefits and spending less as a society are all important as well.   If you compare any country that has lower taxes to ones that have significantly higher, you'll see that their growth in the long run is far greater.   For example, Sweden hasn't seen much economic growth at all and, by comparison to the United States, it's GDP per capita is similar to that of the poorest states in the U.S. Most of its growth happened in the last 200 years. If you look back to the 1700's at Sweden, you'd see its quality of life was similar to that of modern day Ghana. It's infant mortality rate was atrociously high. It's emigration rate (out of the country) was growing incredibly fast because there was an incredibly poor economy. The average length of life wasn't even 50 years old.   What happened to bring it from among the worst in the world to among the greatest? Was it adding more socialist policies? No. Growing the economy resulted from an incredible drop in government involvement in society. It wasn't until the 80's that more collectivist policies were implemented and Sweden slowed its growth.   http://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/how-laissez-faire-made-sweden-rich  But compare that countries like Cuba or Russia where growth has been limited to little to none.   Hong Kong in fact compared to Beijing is another great example. Hong Kong people are happier, taxes are lower, length of life is longer, etc.   Literally no examples like this for large government."

It's not like spending less all of a sudden would fuel the economy to grow faster in a couple years. It's more like running a marathon is done better if you keep a healthy pace rather than trying to sprint halfway through. Fiscal conservatives want steady, but natural growth in an economy. Less of a volatile market, which if you ask anyone who owns their small business how their projections of demand are doing or an investment analyst how sure they are of their projections, they'll tell you it's like stabbing in the dark. Nearly impossible in today's market.   Creating more volatility is playing russian roulette with our economy."

Being able to accept other's views as valid - especially about something as abstract as a flag - is an important part of being able to engage in dialogue about them.

The swastika also known as the gammadion cross, cross cramponnée, or manji is a sacred and auspicious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism!  It continues to be commonly used as a religious symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism and in various cultures and religions it can mean fertility, serenity, it has been used as a symbol for the sun, etc...  Hitler took the symbol, just like how he took the eagle from the Romans which meant strength and wisdom.  Which proves that using the swastika is NOT even one bit offensive! People actually use it today, Japan, Mongolia, various people in the Philippines and all over Eastern Asia!   Again you are ignorant, uninformed and that is why you believe the Swastika is somehow magically a bad symbol. Its a symbol and it represents anything and everything to whoever.   That is why the symbol is not bad, the swastika is not bad, the eagle is not bad, its socialism and fascism and Hitler that are bad. His ideology was socialism and he was a terrible person.  But he didn't go after the Jews in general, he went after the rich guys, just like most socialists rally and it just so happened that most Jews were rich in Germany, in fact records show there were a lot of Jews serving in Hitlers army!

And indeed in all the writings of Jefferson Davis, he only begins to mention ""States Rights"" after the war started, meaning the issue of slavery - which had been boiling in the Senate and House for decades - was the main, and primary, interest of the South. Indeed, were it merely about the rights of states to supersede the Federal Government (something the Supreme Court had already ruled unconstitutional in 1804 under Chief Justice John Marshall), then they would have had no problem with the legislation passed in Michigan, Illinois, Vermont, New York and Pennsylvania intended to obstruct the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.  That law, a compromise to keep the Southern States from seceding in 1850, was forged by Stephen Douglass in an effort to mollify the ambitions of the racist, slave-owning Southern plantation owners who he hoped would propel him into the White House eventually. Its passage says not one thing about State's Rights and everything about slavery. It was Southern anger at Northern recalcitrance, as well as the election of the Republican candidate which precipitated the South's secession; slavery was the beginning, middle and end of the issue.  And what a useless argument about State's Rights anyway; though written into the Confederate State's constitution, in practice it turned out disastrous for the Confederacy as the war ground on; states refused to integrate their decimated units to bolster Confederacy units, states asserted their right not to help support the central government, and states refusal to pay for feeding the troops from other states led to Confederate troops ravaging their own countryside."

Yes, that is correct. State's rights is the right of the states to sanction slavery. That is what they meant by ""state's rights"" and exactly that wording is in their articles of secession.   were it merely about the rights of states to supersede the Federal Government   That is exactly what they were about. That is what nullification means. It means that they believed the states may nullify rulings of the SCOTUS that they disagree with. We have seen exactly that same language in recent years emanating from the GOP base, the so-called Tea Party.   Its passage says not one thing about State's Rights and everything about slavery.

This is a result of deregulation (repeal of the Glass-Steagel act, for example), and technological factors.   The influence that these ultra-rich people have is partly the cause of the 100-year peak in income inequality, with a tiny, tiny fraction of the population controlling more than 90% of the capital in this country. These people tend not to want to spend public money on the public good - infrastructure, environmental protection, health-care for the masses, the social safety net. And they clearly don't care to keep jobs in this country when it costs them money. Sending jobs overseas to locations of cheap, unregulated labor. As a result, the country is in quite a mess, with massive poverty rates and destruction of the middle class.   To my mind, rebalancing these inequalities is the job of the government. No other institution has the power to do it. Clearly, to you, the ""rights"" of corporations trump the public good.

That would only address accidents of which they are pretty damn rare for firearms. The CDC statistics for 2010-2014 put the rate of accidental death by firearm as a fraction of % for injury related death. That puts in the mid hundreds for the entire US. As for accidental injuries requiring hospitalization it less than non-traffic related pedal bike injuries.   There is no compelling public safety interest served by a training requirement. It just one of those things that seems to make sense but once you actually scrutinize it the idea just doesn't anymore.  Also the reason you can require licensing is because there is a compelling public safety interest, with cars accounting for about 10% of injury death, the use of public roads, and the fact that it isn't an enumerated right."

There's nothing about driving in the constitution, which is why it is a privilege, not a right. America has historically been a frontier filled with people who don't like other people telling them what to do. Guns have historically been a part of people defending themselves and their property in places where the government couldn't reach even if it wanted to. In some cases, private gun owners have actually shown to use them exactly how the second amendment was intended in the constitution, and topple corrupt local governments. In more recent times the majority of gun owners tend to be hobbyists or people who are insecure about their penis size, and compensate with their other rifle. Neither group seems to be a threat to national security, and I don't see anything wrong with allowing people to put more money into our economy.

Many claim it's all liberals but anyone who's ever commented for gun control knows that's not true.  Since this link is about US gun violence I suspect gun advocates will be drawn to the blood in the water. That's good because I'd like to address at least most of you.  You're delusional.  As protection against an overreaching government you're bringing a gun to a weapons of mass destruction fight. There are good ways to fight against the government. Getting into a gun fight is not one of them. If you like to cite the Bundy standoff as a success story think again. Bundy is still on the hook for over a million dollars in unpaid fees and penalties. His 'militia' has scattered. And several law enforcement agencies, from the FBI down, are still working out charges.  As protection against unarmed criminals there are more accounts of accidental shootings than there are successful instances of deterrence. The exact numbers are unknown because the NRA has waged war against any effort to gather statistics.  As protection against armed criminals the delusion is greatest. An armed criminal is not going to announce his intent. His weapon - greater than his gun - is surprise. The idea that you can draw an fire your weapon before a bad guy can fire his weapon defies reason. If a bad guy sticks a gun in your back you're going to lose you wallet, your car, AND your gun. Bad guys don't walk down the middle of the street and hollar, Draw"".  All it takes is a look at gun safety regulations in every other country on this planet to recognize the insanity which permeates our own country.  I refuse to believe Americans are more stupid and more violent than people anywhere else. Paranoid, yes. Susceptible to fear mongering by the gun industry, yes. Victims of the millions spent by the NRA to lobby (bribe) our elected officials, yes.  It's well passed time Americans woke up and addressed the pros and cons of gun ownership and reasonable restrictions."

Guns have proliferated to widespread ownership and availability essentially over the last 20-30 years, and in some ways even less time. When you honestly look at how much extra violence guns enable, and look at hard social problems like racism, it really is low hanging fruit.

Hillary is going to say some placating stuff to be done with it, Sanders is fairly pro-gun, and Obama doesn't want to mess up the party. The reason for that is essentially all because of the political power of a single political organization's change in focus over a few decades, and ascension to decisive political power in the last 20. That said, support for at least some gun control is insanely high in the US. I just think it is completely absurd to say gun control is a non-starter compared to something like racism in Charleston.

The black homicide rate is around 6.5 per 100,000 in the U.S. Since most murders are committed by guns in the U.S. these are decent proxy figures for gun homicides. Gun control seeking to bring homicide rates to Western European levels will have disproportionate racial effect (41% of whites own guns vs 19% of blacks), and as such you'd be disproportionately punishing the population which is already with the target homicide levels. I think ending the drug war (the true root cause of an overwhelming amount of black violence) would be infinitely more effective at lowering gun violence than absolutely any form of gun restriction / prohibition."

I'm trying to parse the data in ways that yields the most truth about the way things are.

And finally loose ""gun control"" can not reasonably be thought of as enabling wantonly killing sprees, otherwise Mexico would be much much safer.

progressive,3a998q,thecrazing,2,Thu Jun 18 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"Eh.  I'm not a super fan of being generous and understanding with the AP choosing its headlines, especially in a context like this.  As in, just because a regular person's jump is understandable doesn't mean a jump on the AP's part is condonable.  My point is, it's not a jump in this case. There are concrete statements.    edit: Except I'm an idiot and the 'hate crime' in the headline is DoremusJessup's, and the AP's headline doesn't say hate crime."
progressive,3a998q,thecrazing,5,Thu Jun 18 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"If you accept the premise that the actor's own statements about his motivation while committing the act aren't reason enough to think you can likely make a statement yourself about his motivation, your argument is entirely consistent.  I'll happily concede that.  I don't accept it, though, so that's the crossroads we find ourselves at."
progressive,3a998q,Randally2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"I would also mention that I didn't disregard it entirely as a hate crime, either.  I simply said that even if the racial aspects are tangental, the local authorities made the right decision in defining it as a hate crime because doing so would result in better support, connections, and resources, to catch the shooter."
