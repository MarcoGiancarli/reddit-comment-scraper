He's said in multiple interviews that he is actually a blues musician and writes a hundred blues songs for every pop song he writes.

guitarcirclejerk,3e3p6c,mikehunt1254,4,Tue Jul 21 18:42:41 2015 UTC,I think he had feels but they just weren't able to reach us because he was limited by the lack of good equipment back then. Nobody made any guitars worth playing in the sixties but that's all they had.   There was no such thing as vintage because the toanwood we enjoy in our modern guitars were mere saplings back then. If only he hadn't died so young he may have started to sound decent somewhere around the 90s when the really good guitars and amps started to be mass produced. It's really a shame.

guitarcirclejerk,3czdjh,Penjat,10,Sun Jul 12 05:52:14 2015 UTC,A guitar chord is something that plugs into your amp. Make sure you get a short monster cord so you dont loze any toan.

Only on pull offs. Otherwise, if you're playing a tele, you wouldn't really notice much of a difference. You will lose some feels, yes. As a general rule, toobs can do whatever the player can do, only better.   Yes. On Sweet Child, and Welcome to the Stairway from their first album.

Go get a 4 year degree instead from a normal brick and mortar university. More people have made careers in music starting as a band in college than ever from any of the institutes you name. Also, unless you want to be a middle school band director, don't study music as a major there, go with it as minor if you must. I suggest accounting as a major... its easy, its boring and people will pay you tons of money to do it 40 hours a week and you can do whatever the fuck you want with the money (buy more Tele's) and the other 128 hours in your week as you will have the cash to do so."

guitarcirclejerk,3ckc1a,JimiCage,3,Wed Jul 8 20:15:06 2015 UTC,There is a scientific explanation:  When he plays with such feelz his body creates a specific blend of metabolites which seep through his skin into the fedora.  Putting those metabolites back into direct contact with his skin later (by putting on the funky hat) creates a two-way bio-chemical feedback interaction with the ultimate effect of bringing out his feelz without having to wait for his body to secrete the juices of full on funk toanz.
