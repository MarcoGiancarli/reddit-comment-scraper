comicbookmovies,3e349v,Jhonopolis,19,Tue Jul 21 18:49:49 2015 UTC,Yeah. I think she's too big of a star now for her to be a side character.
comicbookmovies,3e349v,bchn,11,Tue Jul 21 23:04:43 2015 UTC,Mystique has been in every X-Men movie (besides the wolverine movies). She is WAY over used. The X-Men universe has hundreds (maybe thousands) of characters to use but the movies just keep using the same ones over and over.

comicbookmovies,3e1fj7,ShinbrigGoku,2,Tue Jul 21 06:19:10 2015 UTC,I don't think so either.  The post credit scenes are one of the reasons for Marvel's success and have become symbols for their long reaching approach.  DC is already doing a lot to copy the Marvel strategy.  Copying that too would amount to an admission that they have no strategy of their own.
comicbookmovies,3e1fj7,YouBWrong,7,Tue Jul 21 13:23:06 2015 UTC,"Man of Steel didn't, because Nolan didn't like it. I imagine they'll probably stick all their easter eggs in the movies themselves, though. I wouldn't hate lost credits stuff, but it'd be cool to see them separate themselves."
comicbookmovies,3e1fj7,5aucy,5,Tue Jul 21 11:54:39 2015 UTC,Iirc Snyder wanted to out one in at the end of MoS but Nolan intervened saying that it would no longer be a film if he did that.
comicbookmovies,3e1fj7,vidiyan2857,3,Tue Jul 21 10:08:36 2015 UTC,Snyder also said that the post-credits scene he was gonna film for MoS was Bruce Wayne getting kryptonite delivered to Wayne Manor but the issue with post credit scenes is that you are forced to commit to an idea for a future movie many years in advance.

That would be there trademark.  I don't know how practical that would be.  Personally I think we put to much stock in.the Marvels post credit scenes. They were brilliant for the first couple but there hasn't been a good one since - captain America 1 maybe?
comicbookmovies,3e1fj7,gelectrox,6,Tue Jul 21 13:20:02 2015 UTC,Winter Soldier... But Ant-Man's after credits scene was too good.

Superman with a full beard, like he had in Man of Steel. The rumor I heard is that Superman is going to go into some sort of exile at the end of the movie, in order to make a triumphant return in Justice League.  It'd be interesting if Justice League picks up with Superman in sort of a Kingdom Come place, working alone on a farm away from the rest of the world. Then Wonder Woman shows up, and calls him back into the field."

comicbookmovies,3e1fj7,BuckNekkid18,2,Tue Jul 21 12:36:32 2015 UTC,"I mean all the references we have seen in the trailers as well, there are a great many. Plus the confirmed cameos (I disregard the rumored ones) like King Shark, these are things that can be used later on after planting the seeds within the film. Batman in Suicide Squad, Joker writing on the Robin suit, the Robin suit itself, Waller referencing Superman and MoS in the SS trailer, the Riddler ? in the BvS trailer, hell, Snyder said Wonder Woman was the gateway to Justice League so her presence has a bit of the same affect as an after-credits sequence. There doesn't seem to be a need for after-credit sequences when they are planting so many connective tissues organically in the films.  They could do it all they want, but with all the effort they've put into establishing this connectivity and shared-universe quality in the films themselves, it just seems unnecessary. Unless of course these references play out horribly in film and just sound and look better in promotional things, but I doubt that."
comicbookmovies,3e1fj7,TheTinyTim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"After watching BvS and SS trailers and reckoning how connected they feel, I don't think they need post credit scenes. I am pretty sure Aquaman will show up in WW movie too."

comicbookmovies,3e2kpu,speculumfight,13,Tue Jul 21 13:51:26 2015 UTC,"I'm glad they are taking a different tone with their movies (or at least it looks it so far). It'll be good to have some variety. As much as Marvel has been wonderful, and they've covered many genres... they mostly still fall back to Action-Comedy. And again, not saying it's a bad thing, I really enjoy their movies to the point where I go to every single one on opening weekend.... BUT sometimes I'm in the mood for something more intense, or darker... with maybe greater stakes. The DK Trilogy, and MoS were great changes of pace for me... and I'm super hyped for BvS's intensity.   If DC just did the same bit (action-comedy, instead of action-drama), they'd just come off as an ""also ran"", instead of paving their own way."
comicbookmovies,3e2kpu,jasonhaven,5,Tue Jul 21 14:11:43 2015 UTC,"Marvel could benefit from some 'darker' or more 'intense' movies, not everyone but AoU would have benefited for sure due to it. Other than the Netflix series they seem to be afraid of being intense.  I prefer Marvel but it's looking like DC maybe the movies I will like better, more weighted, doesn't seem like it's made to sell action figures. It's why I enjoy X-Men is with Fox (depsite some missteps)."

Yup     In the end, Superman's forced to take the life of Zod to stop him from killing an innocent. Right in that moment, director Zack Snyder understood that Superman wasn't always going to be able to do the right thing; that sometimes, he would have to pay the price.

Superman is officially not a character that I care about in these films anymore.  In the best of the comics I could care about him because he was nuanced and fucking good.  He cared.

According to del Toro, that decision came down to a scheduling conflict with Pacific Rim 2, which he’s in pre-production on ahead of a 2017 release. “Warners liked the script, they were very enthusiastic and wanted to green-light it but they wanted it to coincide with the shoot of Pacific Rim 2,” he said. “I was put in a very difficult place facing a difficult choice, and I chose to do Pacific Rim 2.”"

Whether or not the actual movies were any good or not is a different matter, but his performances are usually at least reasonable.  Anyway, that is a scenario that would make a movie that isn't horrible. Is it really beyond your understanding that those two things can happen? You said you literally can't comprehend it, but it's not really a difficult concept to understand."
comicbookmovies,3dw0fn,lmo2th,-5,Mon Jul 20 07:06:09 2015 UTC,His acting was pretty poor in GI Joe to the point where much of the cinema I was in actually cheered when he died in the sequel. Another good example of him tanking in a serious action role is Jupiter Ascending where he put in a horrible performance and that sort of action/fantasy role is the closest thing he's done in the past to what he will need for Gambit.   What roles has he done that give you faith in regards to his portrayal of Gambit?

comicbookmovies,3dww79,Comixus,10,Mon Jul 20 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"Here's what I want: the first movie focuses on Peter in high school - maybe he's at a new school and is trying to fit in. He meets a fellow outsider named Harry Osborne and they hit it off (the movie builds them up as friends and no version of Goblin shows up until at least the third movie). Peter has a crush on Betty Brandt, but gets shut down/tongue tied/sabotaged by Flash Thompson whenever he tries to talk to her. Meanwhile, Aunt May has been trying to get him to meet her neighbor's niece throughout the movie, but Peter is convinced she'll be hideous. In one post credits scene, Aunt May is finally going to make the introduction and we get the classic ""face it tiger, you just hit the jackpot"" line shot from outside so we don't see Mary Jane's face. Give him MJ as a real girlfriend in the second movie; no one's going to like whoever they get as Gwen as much they liked Emma Stone."

comicbookmovies,3dwi35,wowy-lied,3,Mon Jul 20 11:51:28 2015 UTC,"I have an explanation that probably won't make you like the part any more, but it's the only way I can rationalize that moment.  When he went subatomic, he briefly returned to his ""normal"" level of smallness, kind of like when he traveled through the keyhole. He only went subatomic for a second, then on the other side of the armor, when he returned to his standard tiny form, he had already started a chain reaction that would continue to shrink him down to below the subatomic level. Everything he broke in the armor was before this process began.  I think going subatomic was supposed to be this rubber band effect, that even if you only turned that small for a second, you would be snapped back to infinite smallness. I'm not even sure if that's what they were going for, but it's the only explanation that makes sense to me."
comicbookmovies,3dwi35,trey_davis,7,Mon Jul 20 03:39:44 2015 UTC,"I thought what was happening was that ""going subatomic"" was a process.

It could have been writing or editing, but if they can force in MCU references, they can spend a minute to tighten the plot device that will be  used to conclude the movie.

comicbookmovies,3ds62a,DST3,11,Sun Jul 19 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"The damaged robin costume in the glass case with the writing makes that theory really hard to believe. Did batman just find a robin costume with no dead robin inside? Im not saying it's not possible, they could whip something up, but the costume with Jokers writing (whether it's Jason Joker or original Joker) makes the theory just convoluted enough that I doubt it's true. They only have so much time in these movies, Joker killing Jason is a perfect easy plot point."
comicbookmovies,3ds62a,Randomass7654,4,Sun Jul 19 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"I think filmmakers are too aware of the source material and of fans' reaction to the source material to make that kind of change.

comicbookmovies,3ds62a,themaadhatter,7,Sun Jul 19 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I understand removing and changing plot points and characters to fit a movies run time and overal plot structure. This is a change that would be not only needless but make fitting into a movie far more difficult. ""Jason was a Robin, Joker killed Jason, Batman is sad"" is simple enough that anyone will understand it. ""Joker tortures Jason enough that he goes crazy, Jason escapes/is let go/is rescued, Joker is killed/arrested/in hiding, Jason becomes the new Joker for some reason"" and then all the details between would just be a mess."
comicbookmovies,3ds62a,Randomass7654,3,Sun Jul 19 04:17:34 2015 UTC,Agreed on all points. I don't think we'll ever see a silver screen portrayal of an actual Joker identity reveal much less something like that.

comicbookmovies,3ds62a,Neveronlyadream,5,Sun Jul 19 02:53:05 2015 UTC,"And did Jason kill the Joker mid torture, and adopt the Joker persona quickly enough to write on his own costume? Did Joker write on the costume, but Jason lived and escaped/was let.go, then the Joker got killed by someone else and after Jason comes back as a new Joker? Are there two Jokers? I can come up with ways to make the theory work, it's not impossible, they all just sound really stupid and super complicated."
comicbookmovies,3ds62a,Randomass7654,2,Sun Jul 19 04:11:52 2015 UTC,"It's a theory that can work. It just takes a little imagination.  My problem with it is exactly what you said, trying to explain it makes it super complicated or stupid. Plus there's zero evidence for it being true."

Mid-Credit: Pretty sure we all knew that she would eventually become Wasp. Sure it's confirmation but it was something I was expecting anyways so was underwhelmed. This was like Rhody in IM looking at the MK2 armour and saying ""next time baby"". Suit looks good though.   After-Credit: It looks like a scene from CW, which is cool and confirms his involvement in that movie, but doesn't give me that same feeling as seeing Thor's hammer at the end of IM2, the Infinity Stone with The Collector at the end of Thor2, or Thanos at the end of any of the Avengers movies."
comicbookmovies,3dram3,Try_Another_Please,-11,Mon Jul 20 19:31:32 2015 UTC,I'm not badmouthing you when I say this but I think we are just spoiled at this point. Post credit scenes are just bonus scenes for kicks. The fact that we expect so much that they can disappoint us at all is kind of a problem in my eyes. I know they've had crazy ones but they are just little jokes or teases they do for fun.   At a certain point we have to just enjoy this stuff. I mean teasing the hero who just got an origin joining a huge avengers teams up movie and a fan favorite hero appearing for the first time is what disappoints now? What a great world for comic fans.
comicbookmovies,3dram3,Dr_Midnite,0,Mon Jul 20 20:57:01 2015 UTC,"The thing is Marvel set the precedent for these scenes. They were designed to generate hype for the next movie in the line up. IM2 -> Thor -> Avengers -> Avengers Infinity War as an example. It's only recently that they have gone more silly with their after credit scenes. IM3, GoTG. Even Thor 2 and CA:WS had good after credit scenes IMO.   So when I see a scene with Wasp I think that could have been in the movie, towards the end to bookend her arc in the movie. Hearing that Falcon is going to get Ant-Man in CA:CW is all well and good but again it's not really doing anything for me.   I guess I just expect a lot from Marvel right now since they have some new properties coming up, Black Panther, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel. Even though these movies are years out a tease of any one of these would have been better for me. I know they did the Spider-Man one a bit but that was probably a line they just added at the last min."

comicbookmovies,3domic,IIIISuperDudeIIII,3,Sat Jul 18 14:29:45 2015 UTC,"The Bizarro theory has come about after the Comic-Con trailer, because the glimmers of what we've seen from the film sound far more like Bizarro than Doomsday. Someone has General Zod's body (we're assuming it's Luthor), and turning Zod into a botched Kryptonian clone sounds far more likely than turning him into Doomsday. Also, there's that shot towards the end of the trailer where Batman is in front of the lightning then grapples away as heat vision is fired has him -- it has Bats OUT of his battle armour, which I take as a suggestion that it's a different scene to the Batman/Superman showdown. From this, I believe that it's is the final action sequence in the film, where Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and potentially Aquaman, join forces to take down an as-of-yet unknown enemy. Doomsday has never had heat vision, and you've already got Zod's body that HAD the capabilities for heat vision, so more fuel to the Bizarro theory."
comicbookmovies,3domic,staypuffed14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:56:21 2015 UTC,"My only problem with this is why would it take all 3 of them to take on a less intelligent version of superman? Superman him self was able to defeat Zob, a military leader by him self so I doubt a less intelligent version would be harder. My personal bet Is that the showdown will be against either lex and doomsday or lex and metallo"
comicbookmovies,3domic,matticans7pointO,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"But that's not Bizarro. That's re-animated Zod, or it's Doomsday with heat vision. It's not Bizarro.  It actually makes a lot of sense to give Doomsday heat vision, since the Doomsday creatures were Kryptonian to begin with."
comicbookmovies,3domic,IIIISuperDudeIIII,3,Sun Jul 19 06:34:58 2015 UTC,"This isn't the comics. Different universes and different continuities often have different origins for some characters. It's entirely possible that a reanimated Zod could be the DC cinematic universe's version of Bizarro. It would be reasonably similar to the New 52 version of Bizarro, so it's not like it's unprecedented."
comicbookmovies,3domic,lmo2th,-2,Mon Jul 20 06:58:28 2015 UTC,This isn't the comics. Different universes and different continuities often have different origins for some characters.    So why are people jumping all over me when I say that Doomsday could easily have heat vision?
comicbookmovies,3domic,IIIISuperDudeIIII,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:19 2015 UTC,I'd think Doomsday would be saved for a later movie. He's a much bigger threat than Bizarro (I think).
comicbookmovies,3domic,junglemonkey47,-4,Sat Jul 18 22:30:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the entire point of Bizarro is that he comes from The Bizarro Universe, which is home to all the alternate Bizarro versions of all the main DCU characters. He wasn't/can't be created in a lab or from Zod's DNA, so even if the character resembled Bizarro, it wouldn't BE the actual Bizarro.  Plus, Bizarro is a humorous character and unless they're punking us severely, this doesn't look like a humorous movie to me. Does it to you?"
comicbookmovies,3domic,IIIISuperDudeIIII,3,Sat Jul 18 22:51:16 2015 UTC,"He wasn't/can't be created in a lab   You obviously haven't read Forever Evil.  In that, Lex Luthor spends five years working on Project B-0, a project that aims to create a clone of Superman. He comes out as a botched clone, and Luthor plans on destroying him and cooking up another one, but as the story progresses the two form a very strong bond.  Now, this is the New 52 interpretation of the character, not the classic version in which he's from the Bizarro Universe, but they could very well take this route with the character. I think it'd be awesome."
comicbookmovies,3domic,staypuffed14,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:51:06 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that the botched clone isn't ""Bizarro"" any more than Doomsday is Bizarro.  Neither are Bizarro.  I wouldn't be surprised if Luthor makes a Zod clone. That makes sense.  But the script leaks/reviews all have said ""Doomsday"" and the Doomsday creature was originally Kryptonian in origin (in fact, the soldier classes of Krypton, of which Zod was a member, were all engineered with the capability to turn into Doomsday creatures, if I remember correctly)"
comicbookmovies,3domic,IIIISuperDudeIIII,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:38:30 2015 UTC,"Here's my post on why I think so.  Doomsday never got confirmed and he's always been an alien, IIRC.  This one is an Earth movie.  I could see Braniac leading into a Doomsday intro with the Justice League movies though. Snyder name dropped Braniac as a villain for the future, and he could use Doomsday like Lex uses Bizarro.  Lex and Braniac do team up, I'd love to see that."
comicbookmovies,3domic,HaveaManhattan,0,Sun Jul 19 18:31:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I would probably rather not call it ""Bizarro"" however.  I think the kneeling Superman is Alex's dream sequence.  A re-animated Zod or the Doomsday creature could easily have heat vision."

comicbookmovies,3dmhdg,ActualButt,2,Sat Jul 18 11:04:10 2015 UTC,"You should listen to the interview of his biographer, if you think that.   One of the things that's a defining element of Wonder Woman is that if a man binds her in chains, she loses all of her Amazonian strength. So in almost every episode of the early comics, the ones that Marston wrote [Marston stopped writing Wonder Woman in 1947], she's chained up or she's roped up ... and she has to break free of these chains. ... That's [what] Marston would always say — ""in order to signify her emancipation from men."" But those chains are a really important part of the feminist and suffrage struggles of the 1910s that Marston had a front-row seat for.  This 1912 drawing by Lou Rogers printed in Judge magazine shows how women used chains in the aftermath of the Civil War as a symbol of how they had not been fully emancipated.  [During the suffrage movement], women chained themselves to the gate outside the White House in protest. There were suffrage parades, women would march in chains — they imported that iconography from the abolitionist campaigns of the 19th century that women had been involved in. ...  Chains become a really important symbol. Women in the wake of emancipation in the aftermath of the Civil War really turn to the imagery of chains and enslavement and the language of enslavement to talk about the ways in which they have not yet been fully emancipated."

You get none of that with a couple shots of WW sitting with some people and urging peace. Plus, they want to follow a certain theme for the ad and they only have a couple minutes. A peace loving WW doesn't fit in there. That doesn't mean it won't fit into the movie.  Also having one of the lead female roles standing between the two lead male roles urging them not to fight would send feminists everywhere into an uproar."

comicbookmovies,3dmhdg,YouBWrong,15,Fri Jul 17 15:52:10 2015 UTC,Then you should probably read it again:   He said his new comic book would present a more peaceful Wonder Woman – in line with Marston’s idea that female superheroes should represent woman’s more conciliatory nature   How else would you interpret that?
comicbookmovies,3dmhdg,boobdood,14,Fri Jul 17 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"Well, firstly that ""women's more conciliatory nature"" was Marston's idea, not Morrison's. And it's also saying that Morrison's take is more in line with that just by happenstance, not that he's saying he agrees with it. Just that if you're going to put a female character into this universe prominently, what's the point of just making her just like every other male character?"
comicbookmovies,3dmhdg,ActualButt,12,Fri Jul 17 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of different ways to interpret that.  You chose the most extreme one.  If you've ever read Morrison's work you know that he's a good writer.  I seriously doubt that he meant what you think he means.  There's not much to go on from that article, but he could mean that Wonder Woman is one of those heroes who explores other avenues before resorting to violence as a last resort.  Personally I prefer that approach to someone who, gifted with superior physical strength always uses that advantage first.  It makes heroes into muscle bound, numb skulls."
comicbookmovies,3dmhdg,YouBWrong,11,Fri Jul 17 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"Most WW comics I read, violence isn't her first option either though, this isn't really all that ground breaking. For all we know, that's her stance in BvS as well"
comicbookmovies,3dmhdg,TheMurderCapitalist,7,Fri Jul 17 16:59:15 2015 UTC,"Of course it's not ground breaking.  It's Morrison's understanding of what the character's creator intended.  Morrison also didn't say he knows what she's going to be like in BvS, just what he hoped they wouldn't do."

comicbookmovies,3dmhdg,HamburgerJames,16,Fri Jul 17 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"So, just because Batman is a brooding loner, he can't have one dalliance with one woman?  Anyway, you can forget about the loner thing. The Bat-Family is bigger than Flash's rogues gallery. And Damian was a great character.  WW will be great in BvS? There's no way to tell that at this point. Stop with the Morrison hate and be reasonable. He's right. A violence focused WW is counter to what's great about the character. She's a diplomat first. An emissary of a more advanced culture. She can brawl, sure, but she's not here to fight, she's here to help."

In referencing silver age comics I was suggesting that Morrison wasn't really any more absurd than a slew of other interpretations that have been published - and while being versed in those decades doesn't necessarily preclude an individual will love Morrison's work - they're usually more likely to recognize allegory if not the literary and historical references he infuses into his work.

I don't consider the Silver Age stuff to be in any kind of continuity with the character I've been reading about for the last 20 some-odd years. It's fine if Morrison wants to do his own weird take on Batman (that's essentially what he has done), I just don't see why that version has to usurp the story I had been reading for so long. Jezebel Jett, Zurr En Ahr, Bat-Mite, the sort of weird outlandish presentation of Damien as Bruce's son just seem complete incongruous with the tone of the somewhat more grounded take on the character I've enjoyed for so long. That stuff doesn't improve the story, it just makes it weirder and less believable."

Also, the entire storyline was supposed to cross in and out of the line of absurdity. I'd never do the explanation justice, but I suggest you Google his ideas on his run as they make for an inclination as to why things like that freely happen to his Batman.   Even if you don't want to take the time out to google, you could just conclude that the absurdity of Batman creating a back up personality is at home in the comic book world Bruce exists. Nothing is absurd as long as the story is written well and the characters develop better and, in Morrison's run, I feel they did."

comicbookmovies,3dizx9,2kthebusybee,3,Thu Jul 16 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"I'd rather X-Men be seprate. It's big enough to be on it's own and considering Marvel only release 2-3 movies a year, it'll mean less movies for most characters if they have to make X-Men movies as well as Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, GOTG etc."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,pottyaboutpotter1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:39:26 2015 UTC,"They don't need to add them. But Fox, Sony, and Universal haven't done great jobs in the movies they've made. Only a few of them have been worth watching. Plus if the rights returned to Marvel, they would have access to many great characters that will never get used because of how the rights were written."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,2kthebusybee,3,Fri Jul 17 08:37:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want Fox to lose X-Men. They started well with X-Men and X-Men 2, stumbled with Last Stand and Origins but managed to find their feet again with First Class, The Wolverine and DOFP. 2 bad films out of 7 isn't that bad honestly. In fact it's pretty good."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,pottyaboutpotter1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:10:39 2015 UTC,"But every movie has been a Wolverine movie. All of his stand-alones were pretty awful, and wasted their characters. First Class was a great first step back towards the heart of this series. The Wolverine wasn't good. It was borderline acceptable, but wasn't good.   I just want a break from that. Days was such an excellent movie, that I am okay with leaving this series there. If Apocalypse sucks, then I think I'm done, and these images do not inspire me as a fan.   I don't really want Marvel to have them either, though. Because that means new actors and story regurgitations for all, and I just don't want that.   I'm just a fatigued Xman fan, that just wants a good movie and solid uses of its characters without Wolverine butting his ass into the frame. Jean Grey, Cyclops, Iceman, Colossus. Storm. All wasted on sub par portrayals. I hope this movie can redeem them."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,IcedThatGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:52:03 2015 UTC,"The easiest thing since Wolverine is so popular would be to keep him out of the proper x-men films from now on, and only have him show up in solo movies, x-force, and deadpool movies."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,runnerofshadows,3,Sat Jul 18 09:26:00 2015 UTC,No please God no. I don't want unnecessary jokes at inappropriate times to be shoved in everywhere; and then at some stage have somebody clearly die on-screen but then is later magically alive; and then have the bad guy killed at the end of every movie in a way that means if he ever appeared again it would just be stupid meaning that no sort of rivalry is ever allowed to develop or even a constant struggle/theme referenced; all the while no hero or villain is ever allowed wreck shit like Wolverine because blood isn't child-friendly.  No thanks. I like my X-Men universe just the way it is.
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,ClashOfTheAsh,2,Fri Jul 17 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I like most MCU movies but the whole formula they use is really getting tiring and they keep repeating these flaws of meaningless fake-out deaths and weak villains movie after movie. The last two X-Men movies, especially DoFP, have much better storytelling and character focus."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,HugoStiglit,-2,Fri Jul 17 03:30:14 2015 UTC,"But those two excellent movies are not the norm. They have churned out a lot of shit films.  I just want good movies, and sure, Marvel has a few hurdles in their storytelling they should revise, but they have the better track record of 'good film to bad' ratio.   The Xmen films are getting tired. As much fun as he is, I am sick of Wolverine, and want better character explorations. If this movie tanks and marvel retains the rights, I'm fine with it. If this movie hits and its as good as Days of Future Past, I'm good with that. But, I am a fatigued Xmen fan, and I am ready to hang up my fandom after this. 'Days' was the best note to hit for a finale, to me, and I can live with that and ignore a bad follow up. But my biggest disappointment after it all would be that Cyclops, Collosus, Storm and Iceman was never given a good on-screen portrayal.  Also, I don't think I would enjoy Marvels take simply because they would have to recast and re-do everyone's story and, again, I'm just tired of these films and that story. So... I guess I don't know what I want, as a fan."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,IcedThatGuy,2,Fri Jul 17 11:46:14 2015 UTC,"True, Fox has made bad movies in the past, but they've been improving noticeably ever since First Class. Plus, they seem to be giving Wolverine a more minor role in the main series and focusing on other characters; he was in First Class for like 2 seconds, in DoFP he wasn't even really the focus (that would be Charles, who was a magnificently fleshed out and vulnerable protagonist), and he seems to have a very very minor role in Apocalypse.  I like Marvel Studios quite a bit, and have liked a majority of their movies, but I think the X-Men are in better hands at Fox at the mo. Not to mention Marvel already has an almost exhausting amount of films slated for the next five years, so I feel like adding X-Men to that list would just burn me and a lot of people out. I like that we're getting more variety by having them owned by Fox, who have a very different visual style from the MCU. I think the X-Men are in good hands right now."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,HugoStiglit,2,Fri Jul 17 18:51:56 2015 UTC,I think Wolverine isn't even in Deadpool. So that could be something.
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,runnerofshadows,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:34:21 2015 UTC,"Well this is a terrible argument, do you read any of the comics that all these movies are based on they're pretty similar to the mcu as far as those ""complaints"" go."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,TKG8,3,Fri Jul 17 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Just because these flaws are present in the comics does not mean the movies are excused for having them. These deaths in the MCU no longer have any real dramatic impact because the characters keep coming back; it's weak storytelling in the comics, and it's weak in the movies. They're sacrificing legitimate drama for familiarity and funny quips, and that's holding most of their movies back from becoming truly great."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,HugoStiglit,2,Fri Jul 17 18:56:06 2015 UTC,It's also more avoidable in movies - since the movies don't have to go on forever like the comic books.

comicbookmovies,3dizx9,pottyaboutpotter1,2,Fri Jul 17 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"None of them were clearly dead and then ""magically alive"" though. It was just the fake death tool used too many times. And Coulson actually died and has a pretty fucked up reason why he's back.  To be honest only Pepper's fake death was egregious for me. I think everything else works"
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,BLUNTforDANVERS,2,Fri Jul 17 07:40:39 2015 UTC,"About the deaths, I think that this Cracked video explains it well  https://youtu.be/BWpQeJNxiNQ  I don't know how you think they were well handled though. Loki's one was particularly badly done."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,ClashOfTheAsh,0,Fri Jul 17 10:37:58 2015 UTC,"He is the god of trickery and mischief with the power of illusions. It made sense that he would play off his brothers love by faking his death and tricking his way to the throne. I don't understand how that was poorly done.  The only character in this entire series that has died and came back was Coulson, and that actually works impressively well when you look at the big picture of what happened."
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,IcedThatGuy,2,Fri Jul 17 11:35:42 2015 UTC,It works once maybe twice and then it's stupid. When Quicksilver died I felt nothing for him because I was thinking that Scarlett Witch will probably do something to revive him and I still think he probably will come back. It's like how Game of Thrones decided not to do a lot of the characters who died in the books and were revived because they wanted Jon Snow's death to have more of an impact (if he's actually dead then the series can fuck themselves!).  It would be perfectly acceptable if these characters were just left to die off screen but we actually watched all of them die only for it to mean nothing. It means that all of Avengers fights just feel like there's nothing at stake.
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,ClashOfTheAsh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:04:33 2015 UTC,"""It means that all of Avengers fights just feel like there's nothing at stake.""  I get what you are saying, and you are right. It is such a flaw, especially with Age of Ultron. The situation doesn't feel 'heavy' enough, especially around the ending. I believe it is because of the obviously toned down grit of the film. The original trailers definitely implied a heavier, darker tone, but Disney supposedly wanted it to be lighter fare, which is what we got. I think Quiksilver's death would have been heavier had we spent more time with him, and, again, supposedly the film was meant to be longer"
comicbookmovies,3dizx9,IcedThatGuy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:48:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, X-Men are better off in a separate movie universe. Besides, I don't want the superhero genre to get too homogenized by Marvel Studios, and Days Of Future Past was way better than all of the MCU movies imo. X-Men are doing great on their own."

Then again, it's clear that Fox is hastily doing Damage Control to fix what's been done with this film, since they didn't even like the first cut apparently, and the reason this isn't coming out in 3-D is because the money that was supposed to go to the 3-D conversion was spent on reshoots that we're supposed to have been finished a while back."

I actually think they should have had a bigger actor playing him.  I had pictured something like this: http://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/Apocalypse-Desert-X-Men-Days-of-Future-Past.jpg  The suit itself doesn't need to be elaborate.  I just want my big grey dude that has some presence in the scene.  He needs to pull the attention from everyone else and be intimidating enough to be named Apocalypse.  His lips are iconic and in every iteration of him as well.  That would have been easy to do.  As well as white contacts(possible to do in post, but if he is on covers of magazines already I doubt they'll change too much).  Also, maybe we'll see adjustments, but his voice is too normal.  Ultron was the same way.  I was expecting a deep, menacing, booming, attention grabbing voice and instead it was just straight up James Spader.  And he spent the majority of the movie making jokes.  I really hope Apocalypse at least acts like Apocalypse."

comicbookmovies,3dl1u2,marmiteisdisgusting,9,Sat Jul 18 13:56:43 2015 UTC,"After reading about the delays and the problems that this movie faced, I became a pretty big supporter for it. Since Ant-Man isn't exactly as well known as The Hulk or Iron Man or Captain America, I was always telling my friends how excited I was for this movie in hopes that even one would want to actually see it with me. Well, I was accompanied by 4 individuals who had never heard of Ant-Man before I brought him up and we all enjoyed it.  It was exactly what I had hoped it would be: a warm, light action comedy following a relatable main character who is put into a world that they really weren't ready for but soon grew to embrace and excel in. Definitely a well-down origin story.  I felt the villain was well done, and Corey Stoll is a phenomenal villain actor. He's just got the Luthorian bald, slightly mental mastermind image going for him that was taken full advantage of in this movie.  Evangeline Lilly holds a chewie spot in my heart (not too soft, but not too hard either) for her performance in the Hobbit Trilogy. I loved her as Tauriel, but I fucking hated that love-story and that's a-whole-nother story in itself. In this role, however, I think she killed it. She smiled at the stupid jokes Rudd flawlessly executed right along with the audience and it felt like, at times, I felt exactly as she did about the situation.  Michael Douglas can do no wrong in my book. I love almost every role he does, and this was no exception. His head slam in the beginning was fucking fantastic and there's really no one who can play off the tormented genius like a man of Douglas's pedigree. Oh, and I really liked that scene where Pym and Cross are talking in Pym's house and Pym says he saw too much of himself in Cross. It reminded me a lot of Pym and Ultron's conversations, which I like to believe was a nice nod to the actual origins of Ultron.  It's good to know that Hydra is still working behind the scenes and any time I see someone in SHIELD that I think is a complete and utter ass-hat, they're actually a Hydra agent.  I really enjoyed the immersion into the MCU that this movie utilized. The last scene from AoU was one of the settings in a crucial plot point in this movie; that's always a nice nod. The ""dropping cities from the sky"" reference made me cackle. Pym flipping out over being compared to Iron Man. Oh, and I definitely fangirled over the ""jumping, swinging, and climbing sides of buildings"" line that was so nicely placed. It's nice to see a clear connection to the universe after seeing Thor on a completely different planet, Iron Man on a barge and in a barn in the middle of nowhere, and Captain America being in DC, but with almost no mention of any other Avenger except for a throwaway line about Stark's involvement on the engines for a helicarrier. I mean, come on! These characters are your prize horses! Let's see some references!  The mid-credits scene made me happy because that chewie spot in my heart gets to be teased a little more in the future, but now with clear bresticle-apt suits involved in the mix. And that post-credits scene (the one where I was the only one in the theater who stayed for willingly; I made my friends stay. They were pissed until it started playing and Bucky popped up! GAH!) made me so very, very happy.  TL;DR Pym particles. Pym particles for days."

I'm excited to see Lang interact with Rogers and Stark.  There is so much connective tissue to the greater MCU, references to older films and seeds for future ones, but it also stands alone as a great family romp.  Kids are gonna love Ant-Man."
comicbookmovies,3dl1u2,mastyrwerk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:30:42 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoyed this movie way more than Age of Ultron. At first I was wary of Paul Rudd - only because I don't know much about Ant-Man's solo comics - but he won me over in his very first scene. For once in a long while, Marvel didn't under utilize their villain. Corey Stoll was absolutely phenomenal. I do think that Evangeline Lily could've had more of a hand in the action towards the end though. Granted, she does have a moment where she can shoot Stoll but I think some more scenes with her kicking ass could've been put in. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but a while back I believe there was an article in this sub that said Peyton Reed would use some of (if not all) the footage that Edgar Wright used (which was mostly fight scenes). If that is the case, I think they blended the two very neatly/cohesively. I'd give it an 8/10, mostly because it reminded me a lot of the first Iron Man movie with minor changes."
comicbookmovies,3dl1u2,beware_thought_crime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:15 2015 UTC,"I had a good time. It's far from a perfect movie, but it does everything I expect out of a MCU movie and I'm happy with my time/money spent.   I like how integrated it felt to the rest of the universe. The other MCU movies can feel like they're referencing the other movies, not taking place in the same world.  I liked how it had it's own tone, with Michael Peña's awesome stories, and a few nods to Edgar Wright's trademark fastcut montages. I liked the unique addition of the ""burglar ex-con dad"" character of Lang to the MCU. I loved the action scenes and the pacing.  The character of Darren Cross didn't get enough screentime, but did a good job with his limited time to develop. It was nice to have a villain that wasn't a personal nemesis to the hero(Lang). I don't think they even met until the climax of the movie.  The post-credit scene with the Wasp was great, but the Civil War scene felt a bit out of place. It felt less like a ""stinger"" and more like a partial scene from the middle of the movie tacked in. It's going to be redundant once Civil War comes out.

I think the main criticism I'd level at the movie is that it has too many main characters. Douglas, Lilly, and Rudd are all good in it, but most of the movie is really dealing with advancing the plots and relationships of Douglas and Lilly. Rudd starts the movie as a good, clever man who loves his daughter and pretty much ends the movie as that same likable but generic guy."
comicbookmovies,3dl1u2,Bedurndurn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:29:20 2015 UTC,That's Lang's character. He's sort of childish but with a heart of gold and he never lets being a hero change his personality or take him away from his down to earth roots.

I'm sure they'll have a totally non-forced line of dialogue to explain their character's visual departures, I just think its lame and unnecessary and wouldn't be the case if these two actors weren't as famous."

comicbookmovies,3dilrd,megatom0,2,Thu Jul 16 17:41:18 2015 UTC,Well Psylocke and Storm look really great. I think Apocalypse is actually better than I thought it would be. To me he is one of those characters that would be really hard to adapt to a live action film. I mean I can't complain when they actually haave Apocalypse in a big blue cyborg suit. Considering how toned down all the other costumes have been this is a nice change.
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,Ignitus1,2,Thu Jul 16 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"I just want a reboot so we can get some real costumes.  The black leather was ok in 2000 but 15 years later with the comic movie culture being so established, I think its high time we see these characters as they were meant to be."
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,FreeWestPapua,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:48:28 2015 UTC,At least wolverine with that fuckin mask
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,seanbear,2,Fri Jul 17 09:33:09 2015 UTC,One of the new movie's three love stories   I'm sure everyone is looking forward to those.
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,alphawimp731,2,Thu Jul 16 21:22:19 2015 UTC,Apocalypse looks like Arnold Shwarneggar's Mr. Freeze from Batman and Robin. It's gonna be really really hard to make me take him seriously in the film.
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,BryanDowling93,3,Thu Jul 16 17:42:34 2015 UTC,Oscar Isaac will at least give a better and more serious performance than Arnold. Isaac can maybe make Apocalypse seem more menacing than he actually is if he knocks it out of the park.

comicbookmovies,3dilrd,burnzy138,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:36 2015 UTC,I just wish Apocalypse was taller than Storm...  And the blue lines across the lips thing is sort of his trademark. Didn't the guy in the post credits DOFP scene have the lips? Why not now? Weird.
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,Justice_Prince,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:12:36 2015 UTC,I remember them saying that Xavier would be bald in this one.  I wonder if he'll lose his hair during it instead then.

comicbookmovies,3dilrd,ShotgunRon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:17:56 2015 UTC,"All costumes looks good except for Apocalypse's. Infact his head gear and armor looks okay even. I'm just not feeling that face and overall stature. I do hope they work their post-production magic on it to transform him into something terrifying. Apocalypse, first and foremost, is utterly terrifying.  On a related note, imagine if Michael Wilkinson (costume designer of Watchmen, Batman v Superman) worked on the costumes for this film."

comicbookmovies,3dilrd,jhowlett,4,Thu Jul 16 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"I think thats kind of the idea with Apocalypse.  He ends up some how brainwashing some of the mutants to be his ""horseman""."
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,Justice_Prince,3,Thu Jul 16 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"I believe they've said that his Hoursemen are Angel, Storm, Psylocke, and Magneto."
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,j4syth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"Really? I get Archangel being one of them as that's kind of a major thing in the comics, but adding Storm and Magneto, two insanely powerful mutants to that list along with Psylocke to counter Xavier makes Apocalypse's team a little OP. I had it in my head that the horsemen would end up being the army guys from DOFP (Ink, Toad ect.)."
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,TheAesir,2,Thu Jul 16 21:49:58 2015 UTC,Apocalypse always has a pretty stout team. Here are the various former members:  Death   Archangel (Warren K. Worthington III) Caliban  Gambit (Remy LeBeau)  Wolverine (James Howlett)   Famine    Ahab (Roderick Campbell) Autumn Rolfson  Sunfire (Shiro Yoshida)   Pestilence    Caliban Plague Polaris (Lorna Dane)   War    Deathbird Gazer  Hulk (Bruce Banner)  Abraham Kieros
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,Justice_Prince,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:32:54 2015 UTC,"I was kinda expecting the lineup to be Death: Archangle, War: Wolverine, Famine: Autumn Rolfson, Pestilance: Plague.  I think they wanted to limit the cast of this movie somewhat so they moved some of their big characters over to the bad side rather then introduce new baddies.  Also it seems like Wolverine might not be in this movie at all which I'm not complaining about.  I wonder what the lineup will be though.  Figuring Angel will probably be Death because he's the character most associated with it, Magneto is always waging war against the humans so he'll probably be War, I guess they could tie Storms weather powers to Famine.  I'm not sure what connection Psylocke would have to Pestilence, but that's the one left to her."
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,TheAesir,2,Fri Jul 17 01:44:23 2015 UTC,"Magneto as pestilence makes more sense, basically replacing Polaris"
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,Justice_Prince,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:30:31 2015 UTC,"I guess that could be true.  I would also see Psylocke as War, but it's kinda the more prominent position, and I don't see Magneto going into one of the bottom two slots."
comicbookmovies,3dilrd,jasonhaven,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:48:38 2015 UTC,It's the easiest way to go about it in a movie's limited timeframe. It allows them to have a villain supporting cast while also fleshing out those characters stories.

comicbookmovies,3dkkds,Atrocitusrex,6,Fri Jul 17 00:46:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Marston was a polygamist psychologist who wrote Wonder Woman with very blatant overtones of submission and bondage.   The only hope for peace is to teach people who are full of pep and unbound force to enjoy being bound... Only when the control of self by others is more pleasant than the unbound assertion of self in human relationships can we hope for a stable, peaceful human society... Giving to others, being controlled by them, submitting to other people cannot possibly be enjoyable without a strong erotic element.   I think Morrison is seeing what he wants to see. I'd have more respect for his viewpoint if he hadn't decided to bring the unbalanced Marston into this. If he wants to play that game, she should still completely lose her powers if a man managed to bind her so her bracelets are together."
comicbookmovies,3dkkds,Neveronlyadream,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:28:30 2015 UTC,"He wasn't ""unbalanced"" at all. You're applying your own judgemental values to him."
comicbookmovies,3dkkds,IIIISuperDudeIIII,4,Fri Jul 17 06:07:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you'd be correct in saying Morrison is jumping to conclusions way too soon. But also, I do think we won't get to explore all the different sides of Diana (unfortunately) in a team up film, especially in which she's not the primary focus. I hope that she's not one dimensional and it's shown at least a little that she is an multi faceted character and not just a sword swinging warrior, but I don't think we delve into that much until the solo honestly."
comicbookmovies,3dkkds,rebelinthought12345,3,Fri Jul 17 01:12:39 2015 UTC,We won't really be able to see who Wonder Woman really is until her solo film
comicbookmovies,3dkkds,TheEvenDarkerKnight,2,Fri Jul 17 05:57:16 2015 UTC,"Well, to this i'll say that Gail Simone said that Diana was one of the movie's highlights which means, to me, that she won't be featured prominently, but where she is is great and important. Also, it means to me that she will be represented in the ways that Morrison is concerned about and not just a snarling She-Hulk.  I could be wrong, but I don't think I am because Zack is showing a large affinity for the lore so far and has great admiration for women. That, to me, tells me that we have a great chance to see multiple facets of Wonder Woman which sounds wonderful.   On that note, though, would it be bad to not see Wonder Woman be the nurse? I think that could be more of an interesting development for her personal story and may seem extraneous in a team-up film where she is not the central character. The point of a solo is to develop her, at any rate."
comicbookmovies,3dkkds,TheTinyTim,4,Fri Jul 17 01:51:20 2015 UTC,He's not talking about Gal Gadots WW here. He's talking about HIS Wonder Woman in the Earth One book coming out
comicbookmovies,3dkkds,ThomsYorkieBars,2,Fri Jul 17 04:07:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this article has taken the quote out of context. I read the interview and it was solely him talking about how he's sick of the warrior Amazon trope. Most Wonder Woman material now represents her as a fighter not the traditional peace advocate she had been. Morrison was just commenting on that, not belittling the film adaption."
comicbookmovies,3dkkds,BrogetaDSJ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:02:33 2015 UTC,"I think this makes a bit more sense with another recent interview given here wherein he voices his boredom with superheroes becoming (again) co-opted by the military entertainment complex and the overall state approval/involvement you see in CBMs and comics now adays.   I think there's room for both, I really want to read his WW Earth One because it sounds like a refereshing change of pace from the Azzarillo run (a real highlight of the New 52).  But he's right WW and the Amazons were drapped in very masculine sensibilities and ways of doing.   Given the direction of the DCCU I've got a feeling we'll see more Azzarello-esque WW then say Marsdon, Perez, or Simone. Hopefully we get a nice balance."

comicbookmovies,3diykw,luckyleftyo4,3,Thu Jul 16 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"I could argue the opposite, even though Ozzy kills millions of people it does bring about peace and it does save billions. Dr. Manhattan leaves, not just because he's so far from humanity, but because there isn't any need for him (well and they think he's to blame). Rorschach dies in order to keep the peace, because if everyone in the world was privy to what happened in Antarctica it would all be nullified. Everyone else keeps quiet about it for the aforementioned reason. It's funny that the entire movie is dark, but the ending is the brightest point. It's always darkest right before the dawn."

Edit: I might add that I'm hoping and praying they adapt my favorite story arc (Blackest Night) into a scifi-bordering-on-horror film."

comicbookmovies,3ddv9e,musicisfree91,17,Wed Jul 15 14:32:53 2015 UTC,"I feel a bit vindicated seeing that MoS's destruction will be portrayed this way in DOJ, from the people on the ground's perspective (or at least Batman's). The shot of Affleck running into the dust made me remember 9/11 in a big way, but at the same time told a lot about what kind of character Bruce Wayne is gonna be, all in a few seconds of the trailer. I was already excited after the 1st trailer, but this one gives me high hopes that the story is going to be great as well.  Knowing that there'd be a sequel, I assumed that MoS's destruction would play a big role in the next movie. I can understand the view that a movie should be able to stand on it's own merit, but I also kinda respect the fact that MoS was meant to be the lynch-pin for establishing the DC franchise"
comicbookmovies,3ddv9e,Gonzzzo,14,Wed Jul 15 18:29:45 2015 UTC,To me (and it's just my opinion) there was no need for justification for the destruction seen in MoS. It was the comics brought to life on the big screen. That is the level of devastation often seen in the comics when Superman fights a heavy-hitter.
comicbookmovies,3ddv9e,Gonzzzo,7,Wed Jul 15 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's the same way I felt about it too. My only complaint with the big final fight was that it ultimately was just watching two invincible guys hitting each other for 10-15 minutes. If the badass lady, or another badguy, had stuck around to spice up the fight (or anything to inject more ""story"" into it) I don't think people would of complained as much  It's film with many flaws, but I really liked Pacific Rim for that reason. Theres only a few big fight scenes, but things (story-wise) are actually happening within the fight themselves. The climax of Pacific Rim is kinda similar to MoS in that it's 1 fight that leads directly into another bigger, final fight, but in PR it's done in a way that keeps you invested through the whole thing --- I dunno if that makes sense, I've never really tried explaining it before. I just feel like Guerillmo del Toro has a way of making fight-sequences feel like they're a part of the overall story that you don't see very often. I really liked MoS, but at some point in the final battle I thought ""Okay, when/how is Superman gonna finally kill Zod???"""
comicbookmovies,3ddv9e,0fficiallytr,6,Wed Jul 15 18:52:52 2015 UTC,I saw the MoS final battle way different. Yeah they were fighting physically but I saw it as an emotional struggle more than anything; and a statement that Zod was going to destroy supermans world at all costs. It was a struggle that lead up to the conclusion but even though there was no other way out that conclusion still was hard to watch in a good way. I felt what he felt because the final fight lasted so long and was such a struggle. Imo at least
comicbookmovies,3ddv9e,HeadCrusher3000,3,Thu Jul 16 00:05:51 2015 UTC,"""two invincible guys hitting each other for10-15 min."" That was fucking awesome! But im an action movie guy. That fight scene was what it should have been. What would happen if two invincible, god like guys were beating the shit outa each other downtown? Absolute chaos. The world is ready  for a real DBZ movie."
comicbookmovies,3ddv9e,adrift98,4,Thu Jul 16 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree only because Nolan, and now Snyder, have created a very serious, very real universe for Batman and Superman. It's what sets DC's current movie universe apart from Marvel's more tongue-in-cheek fantasy universe."
comicbookmovies,3ddv9e,adrift98,8,Wed Jul 15 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"Tongue in cheek is why Avengers got away with having an army from space invade and do very little damage and pose a much smaller threat comparatively. In a more serious setting if two such beings exist, the battle and that level of devastation in MoS is what you would expect to see.  Edit: clarification of point."

comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,thoughts-from-alex,5,Wed Jul 15 13:55:36 2015 UTC,"addressing the consequences of Superman killing all of Metropolis (seriously, the city is levelled)    It ... is, but 99% of this is not done by Superman. Here is where 99% of the damage takes place. ; )   Supes is in the building Zod heatvisions down, Supes is near the parking lot that Zod kicks a tanker into ... he does get thrown through a couple buildings before getting thrown into space."
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,Mikeahya,6,Wed Jul 15 15:44:23 2015 UTC,"I think the only time Superman causes major damage that might injure people is when he and Zod run into each other by the side of a building, causing lots of rubble to fall. And Zod was even half of the cause of that. I would have liked to see Superman try to directly save more people, even if he failed because Zod kept sucker punching him or something."
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,RedBarrel,4,Wed Jul 15 16:30:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe one scene wouldn't have hurt, true. But I still think the savagery of this invasion, the scale of destruction - is supposed to contextualize this. We've seen Clark helping people all throughout the movie. And we know how fucking stretched he is, how he barely keeps up with the Kryptonians, races to the Indian Ocean, ends up passed out on a beach ... it's all meant to seem really, really fast, unrelenting."
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,Mikeahya,-3,Wed Jul 15 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"I feel more or less okay with blaming Superman for not stopping it, despite probably being able to, and therefore think he's kinda responsible.  (Of course, a more interesting question is less about the in-plot explanation, and more why Zak Snyder decided to show quite so much destruction in the movie, when it probably wasn't quite necessary and was definitely over the top.)"
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,Mikeahya,3,Wed Jul 15 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"On the latter, my guesses are :    It's a film. It's a story that uses visual imagery to tell a tale. It doesn't have to be true to life even in a film that adopts a kind of 'realism filter'.   Snyder himself : “I wanted the movie to have a mythological feeling,” he explained. “In ancient mythology, mass deaths are used to symbolize disasters. In other countries like Greece and Japan, myths were recounted through the generations, party to answer unanswerable questions about death and violence. In America, we don’t have the legacy of ancient mythology. Superman is probably the closest we get. It’s a way of recounting the myth.”  I suspect they didn't show him saving civilians because A) Maybe it interrupted the flow of the cut B) The rest of the movie contextualizes Clark saving people all the time, so we don't need to doubt him C) In-Universe, he is not just new at this : it's his first day, a week after learning to fly, and he's fighting a savage, relentless enemy in the middle of an alien invasion who doesn't let him sneak off to work at a soup kitchen and D) The filmmakers didn't wanna cop too heavily from Superman II."
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,Mikeahya,-3,Wed Jul 15 16:39:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen that mythology quote myself. I'm not quite sure how I feel about it - I understand what he's getting at, but I don't quite agree. He's right to link superheroes with the idea of modern myths, but I still feel like the destruction was taken too far? Difficult to say.  I addressed some of the other points you made in the comment above, if you're interested."
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,Mikeahya,3,Wed Jul 15 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I quoted it to give the answer context, but I'm not speaking for Snyder, and I'm not totally sure where he's coming from. But I didn't have a problem with the destruction.   Uh, I mean I don't want to say 'You're wrong!' We all have opinions. ; )  I like the movie - a lot - and for whatever damn reason I get the angle they were going for and the majority of it worked for me. That doesn't mean I don't bite my lip during the tornado scene, which - though I can buy into it - is probably the poorest scene in the movie by a mile.   On your point - yes, they made it up, but that works both ways. And they wrote it in such a way where I can read it as : The thing Kal needs to do to save humans is get in-between them and the Kryptonians. He does that. Over and over again.   I've always likened it to a bunch of drunk 7-foot wrestlers barging into your house and screaming ""We're gonna kill your family!"" They lunge at em, but you step in. You're thrown through a coffee table and a couple walls but you fight em off, though it's almost beyond your means. If you had not done that, they would've attacked grandma. So : were you the bad guy ?   But people are overprotective of Superman. There are biblical passages where Jesus Christ gets angry and flips over tables, yet when Clark Kent wrecks someone's truck it's heresy ?! It's so bizarre that Superman is never, ever allowed to do the same : to be human. He has to be a certain kind of human - and more infallible than a real-world messiah.  If Snyder continued on without addressing the important character checkboxes, then I'll end up looking silly arguing on behalf of the film. But I don't think he will. I think he's gonna bring some good Superman in this next film.   One thing I would say is ... I don't think some people understand the tremendous shadow Richard Donner's 78 film must've cast over the production of the new one. It's subjective, but I can see it ... and I think it accounts for choices like the tornado scene, or anything where the filmmakers have tried to say 'We're doing it differently'. I imagine it was a tough gig.   That's a long post, forgive me. ; p"
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,Mikeahya,0,Wed Jul 15 17:54:00 2015 UTC,"Lot of good points there. I will admit that I am probably overly harsh on Man of Steel - it's just that, for whatever reason, all the different aspects of it together don't really work for me. There are definitely bits I do like (the music, the way it looks, the acting, the scenes where Clark learns to fly) and I just feel like certain changes of emphasis and difference in focus would have yielded a better movie. Or, at least, one that better suited my preferences!  I think I probably would have been okay with the destruction if it had just been toned down a bit. Your metaphor about grandma is more or less dead on - except, you know, it's more like the whole street gets trashed, rather than a coffee table and a couple of walls. Everything just felt a little bit OTT to me."
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,lmo2th,3,Wed Jul 15 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"Ya know, it's a fuckin weird film, man ... audacious, a little self-serious, the way it looks and sounds, some parts are whisper-quiet and everything else is BOOM. I understand people not getting it.   I dunno ... like I get people saying 'I didn't like A' or 'Didn't like B'. But for me, the movie is fucking thrilling, and a couple minor plot points down take away from that. Like the lyrics to 'Smells like Teen Spirit' are almost completely nonsensical, ya know? But that song is about loud distorted instruments and drums - as is MoS. ; p   Ultimately, it's got some of the greatest Superman scenes put to film, imo. Like this : what the fuck is that shit ?!

comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,drakesfolly,3,Thu Jul 16 08:48:25 2015 UTC,"It was the first fight he'd ever been in, the first time he had ever used his powers significantly, and he was fighting an experienced military general who actively tried to cause as much destruction as possible. You can't really hold him responsible for not being able to stop that. It's pretty impressive that he managed to stop it at all, let alone without a lot of destruction.  The amount of destruction seemed like the logical consequence of having someone with that much power trying their hardest to destroy as much as possible."
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,punchbricks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"The thing is, though, it's all made up. And I don't mean that in a dismissive sense, I mean it more in the case of ""These were all a series of choices made by Zak Snyder and David Goyer. They decided that this amount of destruction should happen, and they could have easily decided to have less happen. Why did they make this choice?"".   I mean, you said how he was fighting an experienced military general - but I can counter that with ""Clark had been living with and using his powers to varying extents for his entire life. Zod is still adjusting to those powers. The start of the film established that Clark took years to adjust, and went through a lot of pain to get a handle on them. Before he could control them, he was essentially unable to do anything with them. Surely Zod should have similarly struggled, and Clark should have beaten him much more easily?""  Then maybe you can say that Zod was an adult, so it was easier for him, or Zod has his extensive military training, so it was easier for him, or even that Zod caused as much destruction as he did because he didn't know what he was doing and was still adjusting. It's all a little bit up in the air and open to interpretation, because it is all made up.   The destruction isn't a logical consequence, it's something Snyder/Goyer decided to include. Sure, you can make the argument that you'd get that much destruction in real life if that happened, but you can also easily point out that this wouldn't happen in real life.   My own personal problem with the destruction is that I don't feel it has any place in a Superman movie. It was gratuitous and over the top; thematically, it felt out of place to me. It speaks of something of a misunderstanding of Superman that we didn't get, say, scenes of him trying to contain the fight, or protect some innocent bystanders, or this, or that, or, or, or... etc.   And the lack of those scenes - and the inclusion of the destruction - were choices made by Snyder/Goyer. Which is why I have reservations about their depiction of Superman (but I'm pleased that they're addressing it and making it a central part of the narrative; had they simply ignored the ending, and rebuilt Metropolis as if nothing had happened, I think I'd have been more dissatisfied.)  That got really long, didn't it? Whenever I end up talking about Man of Steel, I just go on and on and on... Thanks for your comment!"
comicbookmovies,3ddqqh,Greyhound272,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"Why did they make this choice?   Because doing otherwise either goes completely against the villain's motivation, or makes him completely incompetent. Neither of which a re good options.   using his powers to varying extents for his entire life   He had almost never used them. He made an active effort not to.   went through a lot of pain to get a handle on them   Not to use them though. Just to keep them under wraps and not let them overwhelm him.   Surely Zod should have similarly struggled, and Clark should have beaten him much more easily?   Zod wasn't trying to not use his powers, which is what Clark struggled with. He very much wanted to use them to their most destructive capacity.   The destruction isn't a logical consequence, it's something Snyder/Goyer decided to include   They decided to include it because it is the logical consequence. God-like powers + trying to destroy as much a possible = lots of things getting destroyed.   I don't feel it has any place in a Superman movie. It was gratuitous and over the top   Gratuitous and over the top is pretty much the foundation of a Superman movie.   Superman that we didn't get, say, scenes of him trying to contain the fight, or protect some innocent bystanders, or this, or that, or, or, or... etc   It's as if it was his first outing and he was still learning or something. That's kind of the entire point of an origin story, he isn't the perfect boy scout right off the bat. He has to learn that.   And the lack of those scenes - and the inclusion of the destruction - were choices made by Snyder/Goyer   For glaringly obvious reasons: he had never done anything like that before. He wasn't going to be doing a 10/10 save everyone job because he had absolutely no idea what he was doing. If the movie featured Superman as being active for several years and understanding his role, then that complaint would make sense. But on his first outing, first fight and first time using his powers it doesn't hold."

The point is that they were still tweaking the coloring and effects of the Negative Zone when that first trailer came out.

comicbookmovies,3dab7k,HugoStiglit,-3,Tue Jul 14 21:04:17 2015 UTC,So do you have any theories as to why they changed the orange to green?
comicbookmovies,3dab7k,RedBarrel,2,Tue Jul 14 21:12:58 2015 UTC,"Yes; the green looks better. The effects and color grading for the N-Zone looked very rough in the first trailer, so in the time between that one's release and the release of this current one they've had a lot of time to tweak it and likely decided that green looks better than orange and made it look more otherworldly.

comicbookmovies,3dab7k,FerPalacios93,-6,Tue Jul 14 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"The trailer (which usually is supposed to show good scenes for hype) has laughably bad dialogue.  Why is Doom wrapped in Reynolds Wrap? That voice coming out of The Thing is not good. Oh, and the studio cut the 3D conversion which means they don't think it'll raise enough money in 3D to cover the costs.  This movie is going to be a shit show, I'm willing to bet. That said, there are people out there who liked The Amazing Spider-Man 2, so there no accounting for bad taste. We can only hope it's bad enough that it's turned over to Marvel like the Spider-man franchise."

comicbookmovies,3d8ebe,DasScarecrow,9,Tue Jul 14 13:53:54 2015 UTC,"From the get-go, Harley Quinn has been very popular, first in the tv show and later in the comics. Her recent solo book has been doing extremely well, consistently being one of DC's best sellers, without even having to rely on Batman or Joker cameos. The character just seems to strike a great balance of appealing to both male and female audiences without alienating either one. She also a good balance of evil, quirky and fascinating that makes her better as a continuous presence than the Joker, who is much better in smaller doses."

However after watching the Trailer I am completely convinced I am going to be satisfied with Harley and I am warming up to the Joker. As long as their acting allows me to lose myself into their character's and distracts me from their appearance I will be ok.....I think lol

comicbookmovies,3d8ebe,plymouthpower,4,Tue Jul 14 10:16:35 2015 UTC,It's probably cause of the director. Notice how Batman stands out like a sore thumb with his true comic book look while the others look dirty and gritty as fuck.  I get that they probs discussed it so there is some continuity but it just seems the character designs were made for the director. We might get a more traditional joker when/if Snyder gets his hands on it.  Hopefully since Batman is old as fuck (relatively) we get to see awesome flashbacks of traditional Harley in her traditional costume and we get purple suit Joker.  I sorta like it if it's true that they trainsition into something so fuckin trashy looking over the decades. But either way I'm forced to give it a chance.
comicbookmovies,3d8ebe,HotBreadKitchen,3,Tue Jul 14 10:30:44 2015 UTC,"Well, we do see Joker in a purple trenchcoat briefly in the ad. But I don't think we'll see traditional Harley. Her look is too far from the original"

You can barely compare the power of two characters because they differ so much per issue.

I think it is two different scenes cut together for trailer. But I digress, to answer your question, I have no idea..."

comicbookmovies,3d5322,kebabish,7,Mon Jul 13 18:35:07 2015 UTC,Theres also a theory floating around that superman gets hit as he flies through the beam disrupting it - thats why Zod is drawing that wave pattern as hes following superman trying to zap him.
comicbookmovies,3d5322,AvatarIII,7,Mon Jul 13 18:41:57 2015 UTC,"makes sense too, but if I remember rightly, at that moment in the movie, Zod is not fighting Supes, he just got the heat beam power and is just kind of flailing trying to get it under control, in fact Supes is kind of just sitting there.  clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWyTY6T_h90"

When Zod is sweeping from left to right, he's crossing the corner of the building. You can see the corner of a pillar to his right. At that point he looks down quickly which causes the break in damage in the BvS image."

comicbookmovies,3d5322,spectrem,2,Mon Jul 13 19:23:55 2015 UTC,I think it's because it should continue traveling almost towards the camera but they probably wanted to keep the attention focused on the building.
comicbookmovies,3d5322,j4syth,6,Tue Jul 14 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"This is so great. The thing that bugged me most about Man of Steel the first time I saw it was the sheer amount of destruction. I was acutely aware that people were dying and that pulled me out of the otherwise awesome fight scene. The fact that there were no repercussions for Superman was also a problem for me.  I left MoS feeling lukewarm about it because I wanted to love it as much as I loved The Dark Knight trilogy but couldn't. But this clip shows us that DC reaaally has their act together in terms of continuity and connectedness of their films, maybe even better than Marvel does, and has the potential with BvS to launch perfectly into the rest of their film universe.   I think that after BvS comes out, people will look back on MoS in a different light, and have better feelings about it after they see that Batman had the same problem with Superman's actions that a lot of the film's audience had."

I'm a fan of semi-serial movies, as you can deal with different themes and concepts without having to compromise time for any one idea, but there's something that rings very true about the idea that movie should serve it's story and not that of others"
comicbookmovies,3d5322,IIIISuperDudeIIII,6,Tue Jul 14 03:31:17 2015 UTC,"These movies are just big budget, long episodes of a larger story arc."
comicbookmovies,3d5322,EtherBoo,3,Tue Jul 14 03:11:27 2015 UTC,Which makes sense. Considering how successful well written episodic TV has been lately and claims that the best writing is now on TV rather than film; borrowing some elements from TV and adopting it for film isn't necessarily a terrible idea.  People are going to have to stop thinking as movies as a singular event and part of a bigger series.  This could be kind of a revitalization of the old serials my dad used to tell me about (before there was TV).  We might start to see this leak into other film series not based on epic books (like LOTR).

Either Civil War or Batman v Superman.   General audience seem to REALLY love Iron Man. IM3 grossed over a billion and some would argue that Avengers did so well thanks to the presence of Iron Man. BUT then again, there is BATMAN and SUPERMAN. Two of the most iconic characters ever.   My Predictions:   Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Captain America: Civil War X-Men: Apocalypse Suicide Squad Doctor Strange Deadpool Gambit The Sinister Six   Update: lol. Just noticed my predictions are exactly the same as in the article"

comicbookmovies,3d84zf,plymouthpower,0,Tue Jul 14 09:22:10 2015 UTC,I'm guessing Suicide Squad will be M or MA15+. I don't think WB/DC are THAT confident for an R-rated film yet.

comicbookmovies,3d84zf,jasonhaven,7,Wed Jul 15 12:44:29 2015 UTC,"Civil War or BvS. If I had to pick, I'd guess Civil War. No one in it except Spider-Man are as big as Batman or Superman, but with so many other heroes, a huge established fan base, and a release date closer to summer break, I think it could win.  On the other hand... They don't have Batman and Superman.  The last Iron Man movie made more than any Batman movie, the lowest grossing Spider-Man movie and the last Captain America movie made more than any Superman movie, and the side characters are mostly already established. Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Falcon have already had multiple appearances. Will they offset the appeal of the new Wonder Woman? I don't know."
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,RedBarrel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:17:29 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't for Spider-Man, I'd say BvS, but he's their ace in the hole."
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,BatBro52,2,Tue Jul 14 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"I think Civil War will be better reviewed, but Batman v Superman will bring in bigger numbers. It's the first time they share a movie screen, and they're two of the biggest fictional characters of all time."
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,jasonhaven,2,Wed Jul 15 12:45:22 2015 UTC,"I've not read the article yet, but my guess would be:  1) Batman v Superman  2) Captain America: Civil War  3) Xmen Apocalypse  4 & 5) Suicide Squad and Doctor Strange (could go either way between these two).  6) Deadpool  7) Gambit  It's hard to guess how successful a film will be without seeing a trailer to at least get a taste of a film. I think the top three are locked in that order, I can't see BvS not being number 1 of 2016. CA: civil war is practically an avengers film so success is guaranteed, and Xmen is coming off the back of Days of Future Past (the best Xmen film yet) so i expect Apocalypse to surpass it.   Suicide Squad and Doctor Strange could go either way, my bet would on SS doing better because it's coming off the back of BvS and also features Batman & Joker. However SS looks like it might earn an R rating, in which case it will move below Doctor Strange.   Deadpool will also make less at the box office due to the R Rating. But given its the lowest budget film on the list it may very well have the highest profit to budget ratio.   The release dates for all are the key here, it's why Civil War & Xmen can't top BvS, they are released two weeks apart. BvS, Deadpool, Suicide Squad, Doctor Strange have no comic book movie competion at all, each getting their own month."
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,brg9327,5,Wed Jul 15 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"Captain America: Civil War - it's going in the most established, almost all of the characters will have been introduced at least once previously, it's acting as more of a direct sequel to Age of Ultron."
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,plymouthpower,11,Tue Jul 14 09:30:42 2015 UTC,There's just one problem. You're fighting agains 2 of the worlds top 3 superheroes of all time
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,JohnTheWriter,2,Tue Jul 14 09:49:54 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a close contest. One other clear advantage that I would give to Batman v Superman is it is slated to debut earlier. I noticed in the article that the dates were different from our sidebar here and it had Civil War opening close to a month after Dawn of Justice.   EDIT: I checked it and it's only a week prior to the date here and Dawn of Justice is the same date, but it's still a week and something tells me that going first here is better."
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,plymouthpower,-2,Tue Jul 14 10:08:00 2015 UTC,"There were a lot of people very critical of Man of Steel and do not care for Zack Snyder, so there are so points off for that. It has the same dark look, and may not seem as family friendly as Civil War. Cap 2 was a box office and critical success, appeals to a younger generation that's now growing up with Marvel. This is the same team behind that movie. It has one of the best known (albeit not very well written) story lines in the Marvel Universe. It deals with privacy issues mirroring what we all face today.  Batman vs Superman looks to be more ""destruction porn"" which may have more fatigue than just Superhero movies. Is that release Spring Break for many? I'm not sure if that helps or hurts.  Anyway, I predict Civil War on top. If it's on par with Cap2, expect good word of mouth that will give it some legs. I also want to say that the MCU has more international appeal than DC does at the moment, if we're talking worldwide estimates."
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,n00bvin,4,Wed Jul 15 01:38:33 2015 UTC,You could also argue that people have already seen enough Avengers but are excited to see Batman and Superman on screen for the first time in live action.

A decent movie that can appeal to a younger crowd will win almost every time. People talk about fatigue, but kids are growing up with these movies - there is no such thing as fatigue for them. B vs S doesn't look kid friendly at all it looks dark and has a dead body in the trailer.  Which one do you think I'd take my 12 year daughter too? Don't underestimate this."
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,n00bvin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:43:22 2015 UTC,Good point. I think it's going to hurt BvS but it's going to hurt Suicide Squad A LOT more.
comicbookmovies,3d84zf,BatBro52,2,Wed Jul 15 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"Which people responded luke-warmly to at best. I don't believe in fatigue, but it could be really possible that people just don't feel the need to come out and see nearly every Avenger again plus Spidey who has had a stream of poorly performing movies (relatively) recently. Look at Ultron's figures, they're huge, but didn't surpass the first Avengers so this may happen again with Civil War which is pretty similar in the ""ensemble film"" idea as well.Then again, having them against each other could ignite interest, it really all depends upon how it is marketed.  BvS, though, they have the trinity which appeals to just about everyone plus most people have responded really well to the new trailer, especially those that were skeptical before, that's a whole lot of something. And if early news is anything to go by, WB is pulling out the stops marketing this one with a whole line of Wonder Woman products on top of the typical guy ones to reach both genders. And, ya know, if nothing else, WB knows how to market the shit out of a franchise hitter like this. Look at every Harry Potter, yeah those had built-in fans, but so did 50 Shades and Twilight and the HP films have crushed them in the legacy category.  This is really anyone's game and amounts mostly to what audience tastes are when these releases roll around."

comicbookmovies,3d84zf,cocainelady,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"Civil War.  BvS has a lot of hype, but Marvel just makes much better movies than DC does.  After the opening weekend, there will be a drop off for BvS."
comicbookmovies,3dcg1c,Ikouze,10,Wed Jul 15 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"Filming started in late 2013 after the release of ""Man of Steel"". BvS completed filming in late 2014. The reason as to why it took so long was probably due to the scheduling of some of the cast members. Plus they hired Chris Terrio to rewrite David S. Goyer's original script which may have taken some time.   Looking at the trailers for BvS, you can see a lot of CGI. One thing Zack Snyder is known for is his love of CGI. He's bit of a perfectionist in the CGI department, which may also be part of the reason for the delay.  But I'm glad they took this year. I rather wait for a well polished film than a half-assed rushed mess.    As for Suicide Squad. Well, finding people to play in a film with relatively unknown characters in a fairly new cinematic universe (that is expected to rival the MCU titan) is quite hard. There were some people who signed up but then dropped out. Filming only started in like December of 2014 and it's still filming. Post-production work will take a couple of months.   Zack Snyder and David Ayer aren't the type of directors who rush their work. WB has invested a lot of money into the DC cinematic universe. I'm sure they want the directors to produce the best possible films to ensure that the DC cinematic universe has the best chance of surviving."
comicbookmovies,3dcg1c,gerafera,2,Wed Jul 15 06:11:30 2015 UTC,"Also, Ben Affleck had a wrist/arm injury or something like that, it took a couple weeks to heal."
comicbookmovies,3dcg1c,Techno_Bacon,7,Fri Jul 17 06:05:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think superhero fatigue will happen if the films coming out continue to be of good quality. The notable wide-release box office failures since 1978's Superman in the superhero genre include movies with uncommon leads like Howard the Duck and just plain bad movies like Batman & Robin. I don't think DC will have any issues, especially considering their much different tone from the MCU films."
comicbookmovies,3dcg1c,matthewxknight,4,Wed Jul 15 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"and if they diversify the offerings. Comic books are a lot more than the movies we've got so far, there really is a comic for every type of reader. That, to me, is why GotG was so huge and why Suicide Squad has the chance to be the same. The ones I worry about are future MCU films if they don't allow them to really spread their wings.  Green Lantern Corps. is pretty different as a concept which is great, so is Wonder Woman, and Flash, and definitely Cyborg. I don't worry about the upcoming universe because WB has made a point about saying that they don't want it to feel same-y which to me is what will save the comic movie market."
comicbookmovies,3dcg1c,TheTinyTim,2,Wed Jul 15 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. DC seems to be focusing more on building a shared universe of diverse characters, whereas Marvel seems to be putting all its focus on how they mash everything together into one thing that feels and plays out in the same manner. It's gonna go a long way for DC. I think they'd even do well to branch into untouched genres (an adapted Blackest Night could very well be an awesom scifi-horror film) and make sure that while these characters are a part of a shared universe and a team (Justice League), they are still very much individuals with their own unique problems happening exclusively to them)."
comicbookmovies,3dcg1c,matthewxknight,3,Wed Jul 15 14:00:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I like a fair bit of the MCU (with the number of films they have, I doubt everyone likes every film), but I think that it could be a potential issue for them in the future if they lock themselves in creatively. True, they have begun expanding their genre coverage with Winter Soldier, Guardians and Antman, but I still see the same base formula working through their films that prevents them from fully committing to the genre they are emulating. Winter Soldier has a great deal of political thriller elements, and is my favorite MCU film, but to me felt like the Marvel formula held it back from really becoming a knockout. It had a lot going for it, but fell just short of maximizing all those elements.  My hope is that DC really commits itself to the multi-genre storytelling method because that is what makes the Justice League and Avengers-scale team-ups so great. You are bringing all these very different universes together to fight in a coherent way against one force. Plus, I feel like it gives each corner of the consecutive universes a perspective of sorts. If the Avengers and Justice League team-ups are the world as it is, a Batman story in Gotham is more like that world through Batman's perspective and adds to the characterization of the hero (or villain). The worlds they inhabit are reflections of the heroes' struggles and values; when you rob them of that then you rob them of a great deal of characterization and appeal."
comicbookmovies,3dcg1c,TheTinyTim,3,Wed Jul 15 20:04:21 2015 UTC,I don't see any problem with the way it currently is.
comicbookmovies,3dcg1c,Techno_Bacon,2,Wed Jul 15 07:35:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine as it is; remember, DC stumbled with its movie plans when GREEN LANTERN Failed; originally, that was to to kick off their shared universe. To not adjust from that and rush out movies would have been horrible for DC. I'm fine with the schedule it is at now; to rush it would mean cutting corners, and I think that'd be a short term gain trading in on a long-term future."

The first actual connected universe film was 2010, Iron Man 2.  If we're simply going by when the first film in the universe was released then DC have been doing it since 2013."

comicbookmovies,3d9pxn,cbrunet,9,Tue Jul 14 16:29:09 2015 UTC,"On a side note I wish polygon could talk about anything in the DCU without being very clear that they're trying to hate it. Every story they do from trailer launches to the batmobile reveal drips with a negative tone. I believe they joked about the batmobile shooting marilyn manson cds out of its guns. Get it, because it had a darker tone than the marvel movies! Clever. Ben in particular really wants to sound uninterested. Even after the awesome new trailer they're coverage is ""well this might not suck"". Could you just try to go into a single story with out going head first into a painful bias. You don't have to sing it's praises, but as a DC fan and someone who is looking forward to these movies it's super off putting. I don't want to go to your site when it just feels like you're trying to suck the wind out of my sails. I've never seen a site want a movie to fail more."
comicbookmovies,3d9pxn,Randomass7654,3,Wed Jul 15 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Everyone I've talked to and every article I've read seem(s) to think that they're edgy by mocking WB's/DC's ""grimdark"" aesthetic. IMO it's not just off-putting, it's disrespectful to the artists that put their time and effort into something people can enjoy. I don't understand why people keep trying to compare apples to oranges. These are two different studios, let them explore their own respective creative endeavors."
comicbookmovies,3d9pxn,beware_thought_crime,3,Wed Jul 15 08:41:37 2015 UTC,"I guess choosing to present your heroes in a mature fashion is ""grimdark"" these days. The worst part is that this is when DC at it's best. Stories like The Long Holloween or Lex Luthor: Man of Steel don't have many laughs. They don't quip and wink at the camera. But then again I've always found DC's harshes critics are people who have never actually read a book and are just going of stuff from the 70's."
comicbookmovies,3d9pxn,Randomass7654,15,Wed Jul 15 10:35:02 2015 UTC,"They wanted the people who push out hundreds of there dollars to get into these things to have something to show for it, even if it's only for a limited time.

comicbookmovies,3d9pxn,BoonDockSaint_x,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:00:18 2015 UTC,"I get that, but they actually expected it not to get pirated?  That seems completely ludicrous to me.

comicbookmovies,3d9pxn,BoonDockSaint_x,8,Tue Jul 14 16:47:14 2015 UTC,Yes. They expect the people they are giving a early gift to keep it exclusive. Give a run down of the trailer if you want but don't ruin exclusives for the people there. Soon the people paying hundreds of dollars aren't going to be getting those things.
comicbookmovies,3d9pxn,sigismond0,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think you can provide exclusive content, but if you don't give anything to the millions at home people will pirate the shit out of it.  A better approach may have been to have two trailers, one for us plebs and another for the folks in Hall H with some extended cuts or actual scenes or something, just a little bit extra.  That gives the people attending something a bit extra, while giving little reason to pirate when most of the stuff is available in much better quality."
comicbookmovies,3d9pxn,Planeis,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:06 2015 UTC,"giving little reason to pirate when most of the stuff is available in much better quality.   And you think that will actually stop anybody?  Anybody who goes out of their way to watch a pirated Comic Con trailer doesn't care whether or not it's the only trailer for that film.  They'll watch it no matter what.  And let's be honest, any Reddit thread or blog post containing the public trailer is going to contain at least a link to the pirated exclusive trailer.  Anybody who casually stumbles across it won't suddenly change their behavior just because they can go see the official version elsewhere."
comicbookmovies,3d9pxn,Luis_Ignacio,9,Tue Jul 14 18:38:45 2015 UTC,Oh boo hoo. All the fans at SdCC need to get over it. No one goes to car shows and complains that pictures of the cars go online. Go for fun. Go to meet people. Go to see interviews and get autographs. The expectation by SDCC attendees that TRAILERS in this day and age are going to remain secret is patently absurd.

comicbookmovies,3d7vz5,youngeric86,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:24:54 2015 UTC,More likely a movie about Logan's main teammates being dead and him never wanting to hurt another person again.   Then shit hits the fan.

Plus a large part of OML is that it's an elseworlds tale so unless they find some way to change history it becomes at the very least the perceived outcome of the whole franchise. All the movies conclude with Logan going crazy and killing his friends. Even if you find a way to make it work after stripping out all the characters they lack rights too, it's very hard to imagine anything other than a movie that matches in name only."

For anyone who hasn't read this, it's an Elseworlds story where the Justice Society are costumed government agents during WWII.  Here's a picture of that version of Batman.  What makes it more interesting is that in ""Liberty Files,"" its version of Superman is actually evil and tries to take over the world, similar to what movie Superman seems to be doing in those desert scenes. Pretty interesting."

Or it could be a scene set in Kahndaq, home of Black Adam. That's a long shot though. There were reumours that Lois goes to Kahndaq to report on a story and somehow Superman ends up getting involved."
comicbookmovies,3d4nyp,SokrPotato,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's probably a dream sequence. I can't think of any other reason for Batman fighting soldiers sporting Superman logos in the desert. If they are just radicals who support Supes, he'd put a stop to them himself. There's no way Superman would support it. If they use the Superman logo as a symbol of hope, then I don't see why Batman would go to a desert to fight them. He'd be too focused on taking down Superman. And I don't see Superman flying Batman to the desert to fight with his minions. So ya, probably a dream."
comicbookmovies,3d4nyp,thefifthring,2,Tue Jul 14 07:35:31 2015 UTC,"I wondered if it could be a member of Batman Inc, but its clearly Affleck in this pic and i doubt they would introduce two armies of major superheroes seeing as Superman already seems to have some kind of fighting force already.  as for the neck break, Superman robot? they appear in some of the comics as his assistants or something. this would explain why Batman has no issues 'killing' them."
comicbookmovies,3d4nyp,EnergyDrinkerr,2,Tue Jul 14 04:17:37 2015 UTC,I get the impression this Batman seems to be a lot more rage filled than the previous movie incarnations. I hope I'm right and we get a batman to be feared.

comicbookmovies,3d680w,SutterCane,10,Tue Jul 14 01:10:53 2015 UTC,DC did that when the BvS trailer was leaked and used sarcastic humor.

comicbookmovies,3d680w,SutterCane,11,Tue Jul 14 01:21:20 2015 UTC,Yeah because it was meant to be exclusive and not come out 13 months ahead of its release date. This isn't comparable to the AoU trailer which was coming like two days later and was scheduled to come out.
comicbookmovies,3d680w,TronVin,0,Tue Jul 14 01:33:29 2015 UTC,13 months early? What?

comicbookmovies,3d680w,LochNessMonocle,2,Mon Jul 13 21:55:30 2015 UTC,It's probs just to save face so they don't look like idiots when it leaks. By seeming all corporate the facade of the leak is still intact.
comicbookmovies,3d680w,TheTinyTim,2,Tue Jul 14 00:51:30 2015 UTC,Why does it need to be leaked anyway?  Just release them on the web after it goes live at the event.  I'll never understand why they are so possessive over this.  It's not like people WON'T be going to Comic Con if the trailer isn't exclusive to them.  Not everyone can afford to go.

comicbookmovies,3d6b2w,Arandmoor,8,Mon Jul 13 22:39:37 2015 UTC,Plus this is a reasonably low budget ('around $50 million') so it's almost an indie film compared to say BvS or Avengers

Furthermore, the people clamoring for Deadpool and Suicide Squad footage are merely an extension of that same fan base, no average moviegoer is even aware of these film's existence at this point.   Just about every piece of information dispersed at Comic-Con is relayed back to those who couldn't attend in one way or another.

Hype is hype. It's not like they're showing dailies to an experienced group of filmmakers who understand some effects aren't finished. The people in Hall H are fans just like the we who would watch it on YouTube are. So the rational that they don't want the entire public seeing the same footage that they give to people actually there I think is bullshit. There's no difference in your audience."

comicbookmovies,3d3sxn,j4syth,4,Mon Jul 13 09:13:39 2015 UTC,This is my thought as well. They probably filmed an R movie with the ability to cut it down to PG-13 given the success of Deadpool. If Deadpool is a hit (which I truly believe it could be one of the best box office successes to ever come out of February) then they will go with the R roll confident that it will succeed.

If it was meant to look good, it would. Hell, look at everything else in the trailer? It's pure eye candy.   I think it's meant to look bad because we are meant to know that it's a wig. Plus, with the EW pic that circulated months ago, we know he'll be bald at some point."
comicbookmovies,3d2xtg,TheTinyTim,6,Mon Jul 13 12:26:04 2015 UTC,I think the issue a lot of people are having is theyre used to the Clancy Brown voiced Lex from the DCAU. Eisenberg is reminding me more of Hackmans take on the character from the old Superman movies
comicbookmovies,3d2xtg,Shazaamism327,5,Mon Jul 13 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"This. A lot of people (myself included) are used to it, which is why a lot of us wanted Bryan Cranston to be Lex. I have faith in Jesse Eisenburg, though."

comicbookmovies,3d70qg,ruthlessrellik,13,Tue Jul 14 00:44:42 2015 UTC,No.
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,IIIISuperDudeIIII,5,Tue Jul 14 03:16:00 2015 UTC,It seems like they are rushing but they are actually just leaking the shit out of the movies super early to draw interest from the fringe fan base. Those fans are most likely reading up on those b characters and getting more invested in the movies.   I think its a great plan. Plus the movies aren't coming out until 2016 that's still a ways off.
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,brownbottleflu,-4,Tue Jul 14 03:23:51 2015 UTC,My thing is the fact that they both come out within the same summer. Marvel has been introducing people slowly over the course of 7 years. I feel like DC is introducing everyone over the course of 5 months.
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,JackyMehoff,6,Tue Jul 14 04:20:12 2015 UTC,"Marvels first summer had Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk back to back. I'm really happy DC is going a different route than Marvel. If they did the same thing as Marvel, people would be giving them shit for copying them."
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,brownbottleflu,2,Tue Jul 14 05:23:28 2015 UTC,I welcome these movies. They've actually been a long time coming.
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,WildEndeavor,4,Tue Jul 14 04:50:30 2015 UTC,No
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,RedBarrel,5,Tue Jul 14 05:43:48 2015 UTC,"We don't really know.  It can definitely seem like it. Doing a big battle/team up movie for their second movie with a lot of characters in it not having been introduced yet, planning out like ten movies after only releasing one... But we've only seen one other studio do something like this so far, Marvel, so every thing that DC does right now just seems fast compared to the way Marvel did it. Some say DC is playing catch-up, some say that Marvel tested the waters so DC can move ahead more confidently. We really won't know until the movies start coming out more regularly, but in my personal opinion, they are not rushing it. They did delay Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice by almost a year, after all."
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,trout17,2,Tue Jul 14 01:05:25 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand how DC can be seen as rushing anything. The MCU phase one was 6movies in 4 years compared to DC doing 5 in 4 years. MCU phase 2 was 6 movies in 3 years compared to DC 6 movies planned for 2 years. So they are barely rushing it and those dates could get pushed(which means they could be taking more time comparably).      MoS was arguably a more successful start than MCU's Iron Man, box office wise and critically(although that's more arguable). So it would seem DC is off to a great start, if not better and yet so many still doubt their plans, they tested the water and it felt fine.   Lol forget MOS, that's like forgetting half of the MCU, none of them are that bad."
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,JeremyIsSpecial,2,Tue Jul 14 03:48:14 2015 UTC,Green Lantern was supposed to be a jumping off point   Are you sure about that?  As far as I know it was just a film that was in development hell for a long time and finally got made and was not meant to be anything other than a Green Lantern film.
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,JeremyIsSpecial,2,Tue Jul 14 04:07:50 2015 UTC,Man of Steel began filming less than two months after Green Lantern was released.  Surely the script was written long before Green Lantern came out.
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,JeremyIsSpecial,0,Tue Jul 14 03:54:51 2015 UTC,They changed direction.   They hired Zack Snyder in October of 2010 and the film was produced by Christopher Nolan.  There is no reason to think that Man of Steel was ever going to be anything other than what it ended up being.
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,JeremyIsSpecial,4,Tue Jul 14 04:48:15 2015 UTC,I don't think so.  They are building towards a Justice league movie quite slowly.  There is no reason to think that these movies are rushed.
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,BoonDockSaint_x,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:52:58 2015 UTC,"One character introduce in there first major character.  In there second they have secondary/cameo roles (if rumours are to be believed and actors are to be trusted) by a few of there major characters(aquaman, cyborg) and 2 new major characters have large roles( Batman, Wonderwoman)  Suicide Squad is a team movie. Much like Guardians of the Galaxy a lot of unknown characters. Unlike Guardians it's likely two or so of them will die. Of those that don't die the real important ones (Harley,Joker,Deathstroke) don't need much exposition. Guardians did it with a bunch in a team movie. They can as well."
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,Gianbianchi,-3,Tue Jul 14 05:03:01 2015 UTC,Yes.
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,infamousLOUIS,-3,Tue Jul 14 05:07:12 2015 UTC,"Marvel created individual origin films for Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America. I watched almost every single Marvel film in theater. Many of their origin films suck. I try to rewatch some of them, but I lose interest. The only two (Disney) Marvel films I enjoy are Guardians and Winter Soldier. I cannot wait until DC films start coming out so I can stop throwing my money at Disney, they're too cookie cutter and predictable. I do like spiderman but I didn't want him in the shared universe as the Avengers only because they replaced him. I'm looking forward to Fantastic 4, but I'm going to sit out Antman because the trailer showed that it was just going to be jokes on jokes and little depth. Like I know how the rest of their films are going to pan out basically up to Thanos. Fox on the other hand has a better marketing and strategy, so I still get my marvel fix :)"
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,plymouthpower,2,Tue Jul 14 03:36:37 2015 UTC,"So what I'm getting from you is that if it's too similar to a comic book, you're not into it. You like stuff that is based off of something concrete, but the plot and story elements of the movie can just be uniquely crafted by the writers/directors. Correct?"
comicbookmovies,3d70qg,infamousLOUIS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:48:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I suppose you can say that. I like my films to have elements from the comic book but I don't mind if directors do a spin to the story because after all this is a film not a book.

I, and so many other people, have waited for deadpool to get a proper movie since that abortion of a movie came out 6 years ago. Every time I read about Ryan Reynolds being a fan of deadpool I always had a nagging voice in my head questioning whether or not he was just playing it up to comic book fans, but holy shit I have little doubt in my mind that he really gets the character now. I'm so glad this doesn't seem as monkey cheese as it could have been. So happy. So fucking happy right now."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,ReelBIgFisk,37,Sun Jul 12 06:44:53 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck this is everything I wanted and more. No ADHD, 4th wall breaking, random ""chimichangas"" BS - just a fucking funny script and a stellar job from Ryan Reynolds."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,TheDemon333,52,Sun Jul 12 04:17:28 2015 UTC,"He will be breaking the fourth wall. He does it at least twice in the trailer, and Ryan has confirmed he will throughout the movie.  I agree with no random Chimichangas, though."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,redjc99,23,Sun Jul 12 04:31:15 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified. Its great when used sparingly, but incredibly annoying when constant."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,TheDemon333,13,Sun Jul 12 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"I agree. Hopefully they don't over do it, and when they do use it I hope the other characters are confused.   I always thought that 21/22 Jump Street did a great job of breaking the 4th wall, and that's how I'd like most of Deadpool's 4th wall breaking to be.  Sidenote: I loved the Green Lantern bash he did.  Edit: I forgot about the term ""meta"", and that's what 21/22 Jump Street is. I think a Deadpool movie should be meta more often than it breaks the 4th Wall. Of course, break the 4th wall, but don't do it every 5min."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,redjc99,17,Sun Jul 12 04:46:00 2015 UTC,The Jump Street movies never broke the 4th wall. They were just meta.
comicbookmovies,3czd68,vidiyan2857,9,Sun Jul 12 06:50:05 2015 UTC,"Right, sorry. I feel like that meta tone, with a little bit of 4th wall breaking would be perfect for Deadpool. The Green Lantern line was a great example.   Another thing that would be cool is if he talked about Firefly with Vanessa, and called some characters the names of other characters that the actors have played. I.e. calling Weasel his character's name from Silicon Valley by accident. Then Weasel is confused."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,redjc99,12,Sun Jul 12 07:54:10 2015 UTC,Well...he is Deadpool. Being annoying is what he's known for.
comicbookmovies,3czd68,TheDemon333,7,Sun Jul 12 04:46:19 2015 UTC,"Hopefully that's annoying to the bad guys, not annoying to the reader/viewer..."

comicbookmovies,3czd68,redjc99,4,Sun Jul 12 05:55:33 2015 UTC,"Cue the music, and you could argue that the Green Lantern line and the ""I'm touching myself tonight"" line broke it. To me, it seemed like he was talking to the audience when he said he's touching himself."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,le_canuck,4,Sun Jul 12 07:50:33 2015 UTC,The Green Lantern line is more meta humour than fourth wall breaking.
comicbookmovies,3czd68,redjc99,2,Sun Jul 12 14:07:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I said at least twice. I'm counting the ""I'm touching myself tonight"" line as 4th wall breaking, because I'm pretty sure he's telling the audience."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,le_canuck,2,Sun Jul 12 18:28:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I was just disagreeing with other people who were saying that the GL line is breaking the fourth wall"

comicbookmovies,3czd68,Timetmannetje,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:54:47 2015 UTC,Deadpool said 'Fuck Liefeld' right before the 'comes great irresponsibility' That could count as 4th wall breaking depending on the context of that line.
comicbookmovies,3czd68,Ikouze,8,Mon Jul 13 10:06:33 2015 UTC,I saw Colossus. Is this in the same universe as the X-men movies?
comicbookmovies,3czd68,SpudzMakenzy,4,Sun Jul 12 13:51:22 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, but the easy answer is no.  That trilogy is over and that time line is erased by Days of Future Past.  Even though DoFP had some continuity with the original characters and that ending in the future where Wolverine and Xavior met and all the original cast came back, from this point all the X Men movies are essentially a hard reboot of the universe.  Now those characters will be showing up at completely different points in time with Apocalypse taking place in the 80's featuring Cyclops, Jean, Storm, Nightcrawler and others, and Deadpool taking place in the modern day with Colossus.   So this Colossus is still owned by Fox, still a mutant, still part of the X Men, but otherwise basically has nothing to do with the Colossus you've seen before and is not played by the same actor."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,Dirtywatter,-7,Mon Jul 13 07:43:11 2015 UTC,Yep. Deadpool is a mutant
comicbookmovies,3czd68,gmarvin,4,Sun Jul 12 14:24:12 2015 UTC,"Mutate, not mutant."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,LexLugerChantSample,-2,Sun Jul 12 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"Well yeah they're from the same company but so is Quicksilver, who is two different characters in the AoU and DoFP movies. So Ikouze is asking if the Colossus in this is the same one in the X Men Trilogy."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,Doordoor123,3,Sun Jul 12 14:36:00 2015 UTC,He's probably there for Deadpool to break the fourth wall and make fun of X-men movies. Makes sense since both are made by the same company and the previous Deadpool in Wolverine Origins was awful.
comicbookmovies,3czd68,iampattym,2,Sun Jul 12 15:06:42 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Fix plans to have all of its properties share a universe. I forget where but when they asked Ryan how deadpool fits into the Xmen universe he responded something like ""very carefully""."
comicbookmovies,3czd68,neoblackdragon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:05:28 2015 UTC,Deadpool and X-men are done by fox.  Quicksilver while a Marvel character is co-owned by Fox and Disney.  Deadpool should be in the same continuity as X-men but probably some caveats.

I'd much rather have a movie where we see Robin (and supposedly Gordon) get killed unexpectedly than a movie where we're told that he's already dead or only get a flashback. I feel like that would make for a better experience. Show vs Tell, y'know?  Then again he might not be dead at all and Joker vandalized an old suit... but a Robin is probably dead.  edit: I kinda retract my comment cause we don't know when Suicide Squad takes place. Joker's in that and killing Robin would be a great way to introduce a new interpretation of the character."

comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,oldmangonzo,5,Sun Jul 12 13:53:03 2015 UTC,"I can see the merit in what you say, but to be honest I'd be far more in favour of a Wonder Woman fight against a ""turned bad through misguided trust of Lex"" Superman, than I would be Batman vs Superman. It would possibly make sense for Batman to assist Wonder Woman in this case.   At least the former would make more sense as a legitimate fight. I'm still struggling to see how they can pull the latter off properly, given the powers we now know Superman has from Man of Steel.   The only way to have the two good characters fight would be for Superman to pull their punches or for Superman to be significantly underpowered. If that's the case, what's the point of an actual fight on screen?   If they are seriously going for the ""drama"" angle (which they sort of indicated but then botched in Man of Steel) then I hope they play up the intellectual side of the argument more than the fight.  Now, I've just noticed that the above does sound all negative - I should add that this trailer is a significant improvement on the teaser, and I'm definitely looking forward to 2016! As much as Man of Steel was an average-at-best movie, it's good that it's laid the groundwork for the rest of the DC roster to make their silver screen debuts in the shared universe.  Batman v Superman and Civil War in a period of a few months! This is going to be great.  It's a great time to be a fan of comic books and comic book movies. If we can just get rid of the childish DC vs Marvel factionalism, this will be another golden age."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,stuartrmarshall,6,Sat Jul 11 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"I liked Man of Steel a lot (probably my favorite Comic Book Movie), but I'm not bringing it up to start that argument. I bring it up, because even though we disagree on the film, if you're anything like most of its critics I've encountered, then I believe you'll agree with me that Superman needs good press. He needs to walk out of this upcoming film looking fully redeemed, and fully the symbol of hope he is. Making him an outright villain/antagonist of the film, as opposed to just someone with ideological differences from Batman, would not help his image amongst the ""Superman wasn't heroic in Man of Steel crowd.""  Frankly, I think Batman has to be portrayed as the aggressor, as it fits his generally accepted image anyway, and doesn't further push the un-heroic Superman complaint.  Also, there is a rumored, leaked synopsis floating around that matches this trailer to a ""T"" and includes a climax with Doomsday. Its too similar to be coincidence at this point, imo."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,oldmangonzo,2,Sat Jul 11 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm actually not in disagreement with you on that point.   Yes, I disliked parts of Man of Steel (I'd still give it a pass though: B- perhaps? [edit: I initially said ""C+"", but on reflection that's too harsh] About on the same level as Iron Man 2 and Thor 1) but I absolutely agree that Superman needs to come out at the end of the film as a fully redeemed hero.  Even in the situation where he is initially misled by Luthor, I'd have that as the middle act of the film, with Superman realising the error and being a full participant in the final act.   I never meant to imply that he'd be an outright villain. If anything, I was thinking something along the lines of Hawkeye in Avengers, albeit without the direct mind control and more with manipulation by Luthor.   It would be terrible if he was the villain for the entire movie, and I'd be concerned if the Trinity were still fighting each other in the final act of the movie.    I do genuinely believe that the Superman character will benefit from having the other members of the DC roster to play off. I think Cavill has a good performance in him, and giving him ""equals"" to bounce off could really make what is distinctive about his character shine."

comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,megatom0,4,Sat Jul 11 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"We still need to see a suicide squad trailer. This trailer though made me a lot more hopeful. It felt like they were getting the characters right. Scenes like Bruce running into the debris to help people, and the scene with Clark and Ma Kent felt very genuine to all versions of those characters."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,Kaladinar,9,Sat Jul 11 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"Let's not jump to conclusions, but there's the potential for that."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,apocalypsenowandthen,2,Sat Jul 11 23:36:40 2015 UTC,Not really. MoS had a pretty compelling trailer as well and look how that turned. I've learnt my lesson not to get too excited for a Zack Snyder movie.
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,intraspeculator,2,Sat Jul 11 22:09:46 2015 UTC,"MoS had one of the best trailers Ive ever seen, and it was horrendous. That being said, i'm hopeful about Ben Affleck's involvement. Zach Snyder is an amazing visualisist with no grasp of human emotion. Affleck has been on a roll the last few years. Its possible it might be good."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,stuartrmarshall,-1,Sat Jul 11 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"This movie does certainly have hope for being a significant improvement on Man of Steel, and the expanded cast will certainly help there. The trailer is well constructed and will definitely help to build up hype. Greatest comic book movie of all time though? Impossible to judge - what in this trailer suggests that this might be the case? That it contains Batman and Superman? Both characters have been in excellent and awful movies before.   By biggest concern remains - how do you have a fight between two good characters with wildly different power sets, that isn't just a tension-free combination of punches and explosions? That won't be satisfying. The Avengers tried that with Iron Man and Thor, and it didn't exactly work out well. A better model is where one of the characters is controlled (Age of Ultron), and I assume in this case Superman will be the ""bad"" guy.  Perhaps they are going to go down the route of making it Batman and Wonder Woman vs Superman? That would be interesting. Perhaps Superman slowly turns bad due to Lex Luthor, and Batman / Wonder Woman have to bring him back to the good side.  Could work."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,IIIISuperDudeIIII,2,Sun Jul 12 07:42:11 2015 UTC,Did you even watch the trailer?
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,stuartrmarshall,6,Tue Jul 14 09:51:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the trailer (as you'd expect) is a carefully constructed edit of multiple scenes. There's no clear way you can actually state the intent or allegiance of all the characters from the trailer alone, as they've made the necessary edits to leave some ambiguity as to scene order, and who is talking to who.  In short, I'm not clear on what you're trying to say with your one line reply.   The Superman-as-misled-antagonist (for the middle ""fight"" act) is admittedly unlikely, but not ruled out by the trailer.  Yes, I watched the trailer."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,IIIISuperDudeIIII,-4,Sat Jul 11 21:53:34 2015 UTC,Then you obviously haven't read the script synopsis released a few months ago.
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,stuartrmarshall,4,Sun Jul 12 02:25:53 2015 UTC,"No, deliberately so.   I'll accept that this may add more information, although it would be an odd strategy for them to release an official in-detail description so far out, and any leak should of course be treated with caution.  I'll take your word for it then that Superman is not ""working"" for Luthor, although it would be interesting to see Luthor play both sides."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,IIIISuperDudeIIII,-1,Sun Jul 12 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"It wasn't official. It was a leak. Someone had read the script and divulged plot details. Now, seeing this trailer, it appears that that description was spot-on and legit. And it had nothing to do with Superman being controlled, and the fight between Batman/Superman is the second act. The third act is the Trinity fighting the monster that Lex creates based on Zod's body/technology (some are calling it Doomsday)."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,stuartrmarshall,3,Sun Jul 12 03:16:22 2015 UTC,"Good, sounds like a sensible structure then. Thanks for the reply."

comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,spikewolf123,-2,Sun Jul 12 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"This is a concern I share as well it's the reason why a movie with a ""god"" character isn't interesting as they can't die or be hurt. I have a feeling with it being Snyder he'll have a 300esque fight where Superman is like the soldiers and Batman is the onslaught of more powerful creatures or in his case suits and weaponry, plus with the kryptonite in that trailer I assume that'll be used to bring superman down to Batman's level but it'll probably end with them both being friends and teaming up to fight Luthor or something to that extent. I think Snyder will do something though to keep the tension in stories he hasn't written he seems to do it well."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,notasci,3,Sun Jul 12 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"it's the reason why a movie with a ""god"" character isn't interesting as they can't die or be hurt.   A well-written movie with a ""god"" character can be written. Just because the danger isn't physical doesn't mean there isn't danger; the battle comes in different ways (psychologically, primarily) for such characters. That's what the good Superman comics do, that's what a good Superman movie does. The tension isn't ""Will Supes die?"" it's ""Will Supes be able to save this guy?"" In my opinion, at least."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,stuartrmarshall,-2,Sun Jul 12 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I did remember the presence of Kryptonite in the trailer (after I wrote this), and perhaps that lends more to Batman working with Lex Luthor. Personally, I hope that it's the case, as I don't see it as being a satisfying resolution to a philosophical difference between two lead heroes.  A quick fight (again, along the lines of Iron Man and Hulk in Age of Ultron) in the middle of the movie could work really well, especially if there are consequences to both of them for the fighting (and any damage of casualties caused by it).   One thing that I really disliked about Man of Steel is the Superman vs Zod fight. At no point in that fight (until the very end, in a forced scene whose resolution I'm fine with, but for which the setup was ham-fisted) did I get a sense that either character could harm the other. There was never any sense of some one being hurt or possibly defeated, nor was there any sense of that there could be any kind of resolution between the characters as a consequence of realising what they were doing around them.  I was reminded of the concluding sword fight in Pirates of the Caribbean between Sparrow and Barbadossa, when both were at the time immortal and unable to be killed by swords. That fight at least had the benefit of being played for a laughs (a little), and for the swashbuckling nature of the swordplay.  I'm going to follow your lead though, and be optimistic that Snyder will learn what failed in Man of Steel, and construct something worth watching. Better to be optimistic than pessimistic. :)"
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,iampattym,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:08:15 2015 UTC,Well one thing they did in TDKR part 2 the cartoon was focus on how batman was evening the odds and turning things to his favor. This not only keeps the fight interesting but also showcases Bruce's intelligence and ingenuity.
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,stuartrmarshall,0,Sun Jul 12 04:55:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, that could work, I agree. I'm not entirely sure how it would work in a medium such as film to a general audience, without it appearing like Batman is pulling contrived plot points out of the air, but we'll know the answer to that by March 2016!  Genuinely excited to see DC make a solid contribution to their shared universe, and if we can get the DCCU up to the same standards as the MCU, then we're in for a hell of a few years of great movie watching.  Disclaimer: I haven't read TDKR in detail. I'm a DC fan, but not a specific fan of Batman or Superman. That said, I have read some of their stories, and have watched all of their films."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,spikewolf123,-1,Sat Jul 11 22:21:55 2015 UTC,I know what you mean with the immortal characters Pirates of the Caribbean pulled it off because it's not serious which worked in it's favour but because DC is serious films or as much as they can be it'll be difficult. In Man of Steel I had the same feeling you did in the final fight I think if they weren't afraid to bump up the rating it could have been more realistic. In terms of threat for this I think they'll be playing off the fact batmans mortal and just human and but making superman the villain it'll work. After seeing most of Snyders work he's a good director when he's a fan and when he hasn't written so I think an optimistic view is the way to go from this aha
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,stuartrmarshall,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"Well, the tone of the DCCU will be interesting to observe, as it evolves over time.   I'm not generally in favour of this division between ""serious DCCU"" and ""non-serious MCU"". The MCU has plenty of examples of taking on topical issues (as I assume from everything people say, they are conflating ""serious"" with ""realistic"" or ""dramatic""), and the DCCU will flounder if they limit itself to one tone.   MoS wasn't particularly realistic or dramatic (the criticisms of it being ""grimdark"" are significantly over-stated in my mind, there were other issues with the movie that stopped it from being a runaway success).   I hope BvS doesn't go for too realistic, because at the end of the day the whole point of the DC heroes is that they are largely demi-Gods sharing mythical lives. If they go for too realistic and too serious, then they are effectively hamstringing themselves given the very nature of their characters.  Synder does have talent though, so I remain optimistic he'll find the right balance in BvS."

Wonder Woman looks great, but still nervous about whether or not Gal Gadot can handle the role acting-wise.  I liked it except for one thing: Ma Kent.  What the shit is with dialogue like this: ""You don't owe them anything.""  Are you freaking kidding me? What is it with Clark Kent in this universe and him having terrible parent figures? Both of them have told him absolutely horrifying advice when it involves him being a super hero and saving people.  I hope the trailer is just misinterpreting it, but come on! The one thing you have to get right about Superman is Ma and Pa Kent! They're essentially the ones who shape his moral compass. They're who help make him Superman.  Ugh.

comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,Coppin-it-washin-it,3,Sat Jul 11 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he does it because he was raised by parents who taught him that was the right thing to do.  ""What was I supposed to do? Just let them die?"" ... ""Maybe.""  ""You don't owe this world anything.""  Seeing Superman form his own worldview will be cool, but these are very different from his usual parents. I'm okay with it, they never were interesting to me and this makes Superman's decisions more his own. He chooses to serve humanity himself."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,megatom0,5,Sat Jul 11 21:35:49 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean and I somewhat agree with that. However, Pa Kent's advice you mentioned about the kids on the bus was a scene that, to me at least, showed that despite the fact that Clark has these amazing abilities, he needs to protect himself by acting human. At the time, his dad didn't know that Supes couldn't be killed by conventional weapons. They didn't know he was literally bulletproof. And Pa Kent's insistence that Clark be as human as possible is an important building block for Clark as Superman.   As far as Ma Kent saying that he didn't owe the world anything was probably something as simple as a mother's frustration. Every mother has it when their child is going through things that they themselves cannot fix. Obviously the world being divided on whether he is Jesus or Satan is out of her control. On top of the fact that he owes them literally nothing else, because he, in fact, saved the planet and the entire human race after he had to prove himself to them that he was on their side as an Earthling.   IDK I feel like it can be read as terrible advice from his parents, but if you really look into it, it all makes sense and are things a lot of real parents would do. They aren't perfect people with perfect answers to every situation. They raised an alien as a human boy and did a good job of doing so."
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,JangoSky,3,Sat Jul 11 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"I dunno the Ma Kent thing felt right to me. It seems like something a mother would be compelled to say ""you don't have to do this, you can stay safe"" is more of what I got from it.

comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,kracov,3,Sat Jul 11 19:48:58 2015 UTC,I didn't think moderately shaped older balding guys counted as looking tough. I'm just saying they're just as far from buff-n-tuff Lex from the Justice League animated series as his skinny tech genius version is. I wouldn't be afraid of any of them physically.
comicbookmovies,3cxt3g,matthewxknight,3,Sat Jul 11 19:56:27 2015 UTC,Okay but scrawny hippie hair Lex is less tougher looking still.

The kid of Iceman and Jubilee or something as Spidergirl.  Maybe Gambit in his last days as Hawkeye.  Unless they are going with the blob, he's not carving his way out of anyone.  Mut a twistel metal-as-fuck cave Colossus could be a good substitute for Hulk.    But with the way they've fucked with the timeline already, I don't see how they do this without some deus ex machina at the end where that future gets erased.

comicbookmovies,3cz3l1,tony1grendel,4,Sun Jul 12 13:16:16 2015 UTC,This is one of those stories that non-comic fans know of but haven't read. They still get stoked over it. Same goes for The Dark Knight Returns.  The thing about Old Man Logan is though it can't happen with the characters FOX has. They might use the name but they can't actually do a proper Old Man Logan film with the rights they have.

If so, it's a shame they didn't bring back Josh Helman*. Although Colossus would already suggest they have no plans of connecting this to the regular X-Verse.    *EDIT: My bad, Helman was Stryker in the 70's. Makes sense to cast a new actor regardless."

comicbookmovies,3cy6il,Tself,2,Sun Jul 12 20:29:26 2015 UTC,"This might just be wishful thinking, but a lot of this feels like the magazine cover release of Quicksilver from Days of Future Past.

comicbookmovies,3cy6il,BearZeBubus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe but I am not sure as of yet. This is really something that talks about the character (damage tattoo), and Quicksilver was just in one scene and he was not developed at all, comparing him to the Avengers QS who had a really good foundation.   So this is kind of two different things in the way the Joker will most likely be a main character eventually."

comicbookmovies,3cy2r6,deadpa,4,Sat Jul 11 22:10:32 2015 UTC,They have superman patches on their sleeves.. It seems like the desert bunker that superman goes in and the soldiers kneel. Bats with goggles and a trench coat on looks really weird.

I think she'll put Supes in his place, but I have no idea how powerful they'll make her in the cinematic universe.  That explosion looks OP.  As for that crowd worshiping Supes in South or Central America, it appears to be some festival during Day of the Dead.  I'm really curious as to whether or not the people in the flood stayed there on purpose.  Part of me thinks that they may have decided not to evacuate in order to get the Man of Steel to rescue them.  But that's one of the things I'm most excited about for the film.  Seeing the different perspectives on Clark.  Washington, third world countries, foreign superpower and corporate entities.  I hope they really dig into it.  Have to wonder if the Superman army is just a bunch of volunteers that created their own little gang of sorts under Clark without him even knowing.  I'm especially excited to see where Momoa's Aquaman shows up, and how they portray his powers.  Maybe by the end of the film him, Bats, and Diana have grouped up in order to get Clark to see reason.  Maybe he starts to do stuff for the government or Lex because the people want him to, and the three lure him to that island with all the ruins.  Maybe Bats does, then Wonder Woman and Aquashorts show up?  I could literally spend hours talking about this film.  Sorry for the lengthy post!"

comicbookmovies,3czp4b,rhodetolove,9,Sun Jul 12 06:22:41 2015 UTC,I guess it's to build hype for the DC cinematic universe.
comicbookmovies,3czp4b,gerafera,7,Sun Jul 12 06:31:39 2015 UTC,"Because its the Comic con before these movies come out, duh /s. But more seriously, BVS was originally going to come out this year, before the writing was pushed back. They've been ahead of schedule on this movie on many levels. They're just taking their time and not rushing anything cough Green Lantern cough cough"
comicbookmovies,3czp4b,NerdJ,2,Sun Jul 12 10:27:17 2015 UTC,because Dawn of justice was delayed by nearly a year. It was supposed to be a 2015 film and likely probably still could have been.
comicbookmovies,3czp4b,shatonamime,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:14:10 2015 UTC,I think I read they pushed it back because of all of the hype. The entire DCCU is riding on the success of this one movie so they wanted to have as much time as they could to edit it and make it just right.
comicbookmovies,3czp4b,WhosJoeDaddy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:28:22 2015 UTC,"Well, going up against Avengers 2 would have hurt them if they went for the spring release.  Summer had some other big titles that would have potentially killed their efforts as well (Jurassic World, Terminator, etc.).  Winter is a wash with Star Wars taking over the season.  Their only choice was to push it back to 2016.  They have to play second fiddle at this point because they are mostly unproven so far with this new franchise reboot.  The studios are grabbing placeholders for future movie releases to scare off other threats far enough in advance."
comicbookmovies,3czp4b,notacyborg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:15:53 2015 UTC,"It was going to be released in a few days on july 17th. It really, likely, should have been. Where is it's competition for this friday? Don't say ant-man, that took the date after WB freed it up."
comicbookmovies,3czp4b,shatonamime,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:51:50 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I'm reading they may have needed a couple of extra weeks to tighten up the film and it would have pushed them into August territory if that were the case.  You don't want to release in August.  That month is generally reserved for new properties because the expectation isn't as high.  Plus, if you look at what has already come out this summer there are loads of movies people have spent cash on and I'm sure by now they are a bit worn out/broke.  Ant-Man is a property that Marvel doesn't really expect to be a top-grosser (which is why they are pushing it so hard with ads) so it's perfectly fine to release on the 17th.  Releasing in the spring will probably be their best option anyway since it's the start of the summer blockbuster season.  They're just lucky Captain America will have a 3-ish week lead on them because those sales will have died down by then."
comicbookmovies,3czp4b,notacyborg,2,Tue Jul 14 13:22:22 2015 UTC,"In addition to all the aforementioned answers, another reason is they have less experience and less margin for error compared to Marvel.   WB has to get these movies right. They're up against an absolute behemoth in Marvel Studios, which has been arguably the most successful film studio of the last 8 years.  As video game studios are now learning, once you put out a bad product, it stays bad forever. Fans may not like the delay, but you're better off taking your time and making sure you're releasing a quality product that history will look upon kindly.   Marvel can release movies more quickly too because making superhero movies is literally all they do. (Whereas WB finances other types of movies.)   Remember too that when Marvel Studios first started out, they were going at a relatively slow pace of ~1 film per year, as compared to their current 2 per year and soon-to-be 3 per year. As they've gained experience and financial backing, they're able to release films on a quicker and quicker timetable."
comicbookmovies,3czp4b,the_infinite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:26:52 2015 UTC,"Because DC is making up for lost time in the arms race for the box office. Plus SDCC is the prime spot to release things, and this is the last one before BvS and delaying the Suicide Squad trailer until 2016 SDCC would be too late. Plus, generally DC movies and Warner Bros. genre movies have a higher special effects budget than Marvel movies, necessitating a longer post-shooting production cycle."
comicbookmovies,3cy6b4,IanMazgelis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, but Bizarro makes sense to me, you may be on to something.  First, Cavill can do both roles, so no new hire and it can stay a surprise, and second, he's a hollow avatar for the corrupt Lex, who makes a monster to fight for him, while the Noble Bruce fights himself.  The batplane leaving the city might be bruce leaving a post Zod Metropolis still burning.  But the thing that escapes from Lex Corp might be Bizarro, and it takes WW's help for Supes to beat him.  Also, that tactical nuke could be a force field of some sort as well.  You're right - possible clever editing."
comicbookmovies,3cy6b4,HaveaManhattan,2,Sat Jul 11 23:57:09 2015 UTC,"I do think they'll be going for Bizarro, but I don't think Cavil will be playing him.  They have Zod's body, and maybe some kryptonian embyros so if anything he's be a clone of Zod.  Look wise though he might mutate to look more like Doomsday, or The Hulk.  One of the key things to remember though is that Kryptonite has the reverse effect of Bizarro so that might be why it takes more then just Superman to take him down."

comicbookmovies,3cy3ta,therealjew,5,Sat Jul 11 21:47:57 2015 UTC,Im hoping thats just his prison outfit
comicbookmovies,3cy3ta,Vcom561,5,Sun Jul 12 03:54:21 2015 UTC,It might be. Doesn't he wear a suit in the promo pictures?

comicbookmovies,3cy3ta,Neveronlyadream,3,Sun Jul 12 06:41:51 2015 UTC,"A few leaked on set pictures of him show him in what looks like the white suit from Dark Knight Returns, but it's hard to make out exactly what he's wearing.

comicbookmovies,3cy3ta,sp33drAc3r1591,4,Sat Jul 11 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"hahahaha! I dont know what school you went to, that had people look like that... They should hire someone who cares for the characters and what they look like... Joker from burton's film and Joker from Nolan's film are completely different, but somewhat similar in style...  Making a Joker walk around shirtless and have ridiculous tattoo's for god knows what reason is ridiculous.  Have you read the emails that are from sony execs in regards to spiderman? Just because they are hired doesnt mean they know whats good for the movie.  The reason they able to make these movies, is because of Nerds like us.."
comicbookmovies,3cy3ta,milo_van_patton,-11,Sat Jul 11 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"From the fan reaction in the leaked video it sounded to me like Joker got the loudest reaction from the audience.  Hate it all you want.  You're in an annoying vocal minority and it looks like they're going ahead with the new look whether you like it or not.  All that pissing and whining and nerds on their period but they still didnt change a thing.  Didnt fire Jared Leto and recast Mark Hamill in a purple tux.  Nope.  They're going ahead with it even though you said ""hot topic"" a million times.  They dont care what you think because they are creative professionals and you are not."
comicbookmovies,3cy3ta,JeremyIsSpecial,11,Sat Jul 11 22:47:30 2015 UTC,Joker got the loudest reaction from the audience.   That's because people love the Joker.  It's possible to have a nuanced view instead of being completely happy or completely disappointed.
comicbookmovies,3cy3ta,sp33drAc3r1591,7,Sat Jul 11 23:06:22 2015 UTC,"I was happy they cast Jared Leto, I like the casting.. I dont know why you keep bringing up Mark Hamill in a purple tux... Why would they fire Leto? You are just talking to talk now.. No one is complaining who they cast for the role, they are complaining about what he looks like.  I am sorry, but if they dont take the time to design the characters properly, then I have no faith in the script that was written..   And once again just because they are professionals doesnt mean they know it all, example again Sony Execs with Spiderman... Well, they will care what we think when the movie comes out..."
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,Im_a_limo_driver,44,Sat Jul 11 04:47:31 2015 UTC,Would be an amazing way for Mark Hamil to fully retire from his Joker voice
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,darcy010,9,Sat Jul 11 05:05:55 2015 UTC,I believe Hamill has said in the past he would un-retire for this role specifically!
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,TheTinyTim,13,Sat Jul 11 12:25:19 2015 UTC,except I don't want him to retire... He IS the joker. I can't even imagine who could replace him.
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,iampattym,22,Sat Jul 11 05:46:01 2015 UTC,Troy Baker and John DiMaggio have both been great. Baker's is a pretty close straight up replacement too.

comicbookmovies,3cvskv,doyleb3620,11,Sat Jul 11 05:04:59 2015 UTC,"They'll probably leave it to interpretation, similar to the comic."
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,redjc99,18,Sat Jul 11 05:05:34 2015 UTC,I don't think they ever intended for people to think that might have happened.
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,JeremyIsSpecial,10,Sat Jul 11 05:12:20 2015 UTC,I don't think so.  If he did they would have made it obvious.  I don't even think they meant for it to be ambiguous.    I can't even remember people talking about this before Grant Morrison was on Kevin Smiths Batman podcast.  It's nothing more than an interesting fan theory.
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,JeremyIsSpecial,6,Sat Jul 11 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"Just to be fair, i don't think it should be regarded as just some fan theory when a credible grant morrison talks about it. He makes good points and moore never intended for killing joke to be canon, that was a DC decision."
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,JackTrig,14,Sat Jul 11 05:48:53 2015 UTC,I don't really think Grant Morrison's opinion about what happened is somehow more valid than the average Batman reader.  He does not have any special insight into what Alan Moore intended with the last page.
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,JeremyIsSpecial,12,Sat Jul 11 07:00:02 2015 UTC,"And, besides, Morrison and Moore hate each other. I'm a fan of both, but neither should be considered an expert voice on the others work."
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,BackstageYeti,2,Sat Jul 11 07:04:23 2015 UTC,"The original script for the comic has been released, and nowhere does it say to make it look like Batman kills The Joker."
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,timdiggity,2,Sat Jul 11 07:20:39 2015 UTC,"And this is Alan Moore we're discussing here. The man's a great writer, but he's an ass and he's not shy about correcting people when they've misinterpreted his intentions. If he meant the Joker to be dead, he probably would have said so by now."
comicbookmovies,3cvskv,Neveronlyadream,0,Sat Jul 11 09:01:03 2015 UTC,Why would they have had to make it obvious?

Specifically, the whole ""lets shoot Barbara Gordon, strip her naked, take pictures of her, then rain them down on her bound and gagged father in an attempt to turn him insane""?

comicbookmovies,3cvskv,ethos1983,10,Sat Jul 11 07:42:18 2015 UTC,"It certainly needs to happen, if DC comics is going to keep making any mature comics and not just revert to only making comics for kids."

comicbookmovies,3cvskv,CleverZerg,2,Sat Jul 11 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"I'm actually a little nervous about this, and not because I think the recent DC films have blown (they've been here or there to me), but because this is a very difficult book to animate live-action.   Think about it, part of the quality of TKJ was the way each panel hit fast and hard with very distinct purpose to the story, a quality that is difficult to translate to film. That scene of Barbara being shot? You can't just shoot (no pun intended) that scene as a typical shooting scene with someone shot. In the graphic novel, it is the power of the panels that drives the shock and horror of that scene.  I love TKJ so I'm thrilled that they're making this, but I'm also worried about how difficult it could be to adapt. This is a story that is truly difficult to translate page to screen. A lot of Batman stories have a cinematic quality to them, but this one almost thrives on its intimacy on the page."

The whole ""we cant group together cause we have too much ego"" and the fact that they do as much damage as the villians (except ultron, he destroyed a country)."
comicbookmovies,3d0i7k,DeathFeind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"I like marvel films cause they're funny and entertaining. But they lack... a certain 'depth' of some sort.  DC, I feel, is more mature and realistic. It addresses issues the Marvel has failed to address. For example, the issue of a god-like being (in Marvel's case, it is Thor) showing up on Earth. I'm sure if Thor (a pagan God) showed up on Earth, there would be some sort of religious/political turmoil. But Marvel didn't do that. They just moved on and I don't mind that. I'm glad they did. I want to see Avengers make witty one-liners, fight in slow-motion etc.   I like that DC is going for the more grounded/realistic approach to their cinematic universe. It would be really interesting to see Superheroes from a different perspective."

comicbookmovies,3cxust,mrplow8,-1,Sun Jul 12 00:33:46 2015 UTC,Really excited that it seems like the rumors were untrue and this movie will focus on Batman and Superman.  I hated the thought of that being the beginning of the movie and then halfway through they have to team up to take down some other villain.
comicbookmovies,3cxust,BaltimoreProud,4,Sat Jul 11 19:31:11 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they're going to team up to take down Doomsday at the end of the movie. The scene with Zod's dead body in LexCorp matches a rumor that Lex makes Doomsday from his corpse.   I'm pretty sure that's who Wonder Woman is fighting, in fact. I think this is just a really good trailer in that it doesn't give much away, and in fact, misleads the audience."
comicbookmovies,3cxust,oldmangonzo,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"That would really irritate me if they did that.  A villain like Doomsday is too big to have him only be used in the final part of a movie.  It would be like how Raimi used Venom in Spider-Man III.  Teasing Doomsday, or him ""waking up"" in a post-credit's scene would be PERFECT for me.  Throwing him in to the 3rd act of BvS would be a huge mistake.  I'm hoping the fighting we see Wonder Woman doing in the trailer is against Superman.  Affleck said in the EW article that Bruce and Diana know about each other's superhero identities so it would make sense for her to team up with him against Clark."
comicbookmovies,3cxust,BaltimoreProud,4,Sat Jul 11 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I actually think Doomsday is far too thin of a character to carry more than a single act of a film. He is completely different than Venom in that sense. I would gladly pay to watch a movie where Venom/Eddie Brock is the main character, just like I gladly bought the Venom: Lethal Protector comic books, whereas Doomsday is perfect for a single climactic fight.  And don't get me wrong, I like Doomsday, but a movie where he is the main antagonist wouldn't really work, imo. Plus, I want the good guys working together by the end. One common thread in Superman/ Batman fights (in comics) is that Batman needs to keep the fight brief, or otherwise he has no chance."

comicbookmovies,3ct5ir,honduranblood24,13,Sat Jul 11 18:28:04 2015 UTC,"I know this may be tough to do, but if you had to rank it amongst the other MCU universe movies where would you place it?  Follow-up, does Ant-Man fit in with the rest of the movies or is it more of a standalone entry like Guardians was (for now at least)?"
comicbookmovies,3ct5ir,nicosuave666,10,Fri Jul 10 16:01:27 2015 UTC,I would rank it near the top. Top 3 for sure. It was really funny and it had a good balance of action and drama as well.   Yes Ant-Man fits in with the rest of the movies.

comicbookmovies,3ct5ir,erurie,3,Fri Jul 10 16:55:49 2015 UTC,I can't be certain but to me it felt like less McKay. There were certain parts where you felt his influence on the movie but it followed a more comic book dialog.

comicbookmovies,3ct5ir,HeadCrusher3000,2,Fri Jul 10 17:09:12 2015 UTC,Michael Douglas was great! He always brings a lot to the table in any role. Really liked him. Can't speak to how his character differs from the comics as I have never really read Ant-Man. Wasp... well I'll leave that one alone

comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,TheMurderCapitalist,8,Sat Jul 11 03:37:57 2015 UTC,"True, but Daredevil is a tv show, which is a little different. Kids should be able to see any Marvel movie without being utterly horrified."
comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,SuddenlyFrogs,5,Sat Jul 11 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yep. Personally I like DC more, but sometimes I want to watch something darker and more serious, like True Detective, and sometimes I want to watch something more lighthearted, like Psych. Those are obviously more extreme examples, but they illustrate the same point: they're completely tonally different but I love both."
comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,DownbeatDinosaur,5,Sat Jul 11 05:10:28 2015 UTC,I personally thought The Winter Soldier had the perfect amount of grit for the MCU.

comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,S0ckHeaven,4,Sat Jul 11 15:22:45 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the amount as much as the quality. Darcy in the Thor movies and Ultron were so unfunny it hurts to hear them say one-liners. Guardians of the Galaxy had tons of comedy, but i t was really funny so I didn't mind.  I wouldn't mind if the movies all became as serious as Winter Soldier since I don't think that crosses the line, but if they want to go for funny they have to actually be funny."
comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,RedBarrel,4,Sat Jul 11 13:33:05 2015 UTC,"I wish every Marvel movie was like the Winter Soilder. Nearly every movie they make now is riddled with comedy. It's not a bad thing, but when you have too much of it like how IM3 and Age of Ultron had, it takes away from the movie. TWS was the perfect blend of seriousness and light jokes and it turned out to be Marvel's best movie to date."

comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,the_tylerd91,3,Sat Jul 11 20:12:31 2015 UTC,My opinion on humor in the MCU is based on a character by character basis. Characters like Spider-Man and Iron Man are good basis for comedy whereas I feel characters like Captain America and Thor work better as straight men
comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,killerbekilled92,4,Sat Jul 11 15:06:45 2015 UTC,"I think that they can keep the humor that people love from them, but for the love of God place it better than it was in Ultron.

comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,TheTinyTim,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"They were still being active, fighting the robots and in that case driving somewhere. It's like in the first one, where they talked about another mission while shooting aliens. They're still taking the situation seriously enough, they're just so professional they can help as much as possible and also have a chat.  That's just how I interpreted it, though. I guess if even Iron Man and Thor aren't fucking around, you'd think the non-powered people would be like that too, so I get where you're coming from."
comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,RedBarrel,6,Sat Jul 11 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"I realized that MCU movies aren't  quite my cup of tea (for the most part) manly because of the humor. Not just the humor, but the placement of the humor. For me personally, when there's a joke in the middle of a huge fight between the big bad, it takes me out of the moment which reminds me the hero isn't in any real danger. Now just because I don't like it doesn't mean that the movies suck, and people who like it are dumb or that ""DCU is way better!"". It obviously works and the vast majority of people like it. That's the awesome thing about now having a MCU and a DCU, there will be something for everyone!"
comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,matticans7pointO,2,Sat Jul 11 04:49:51 2015 UTC,"I thought all the Phase 1 movies (including the Avengers) handled the comedy perfectly. It was in short bursts, placed at the right spots in the movie, and didn't take away from the serious parts of the movies.   Then the sequels happened. Minus Cap 2, I found them all very underwhelming, mainly because of the increased amount of comedy. (Though it was also probably due to changing all the directors besides Jon Faverau, and even he bailed after Iron Man 2). It's especially odd considering the sequels focused on the darkest corners of the Marvel storylines. Ultron was the butt of the joke in his own movie, Tony Stark's alcoholism was played for laughs and then never mentioned again, and Kat Dennings (who I can't fucking stand) had more screen time than Christopher Eccleston, who was the main villain (supposedly)!  Guardians, on the other hand, worked because of the heightened amount of comedy. If it had taken itself too seriously, I don't think nearly as many people would have seen it. I've heard that Ant-Man strikes a similar balance, so that makes me more optimistic for it.  The real question is, how is Spider-Man going to be tone-wise? They've been calling it a John Hughes movie, though that may just be synonymous with ""high school movie"" at this point."
comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,protomenfan200x,2,Sat Jul 11 12:58:08 2015 UTC,"I feel some of RDJ's lines in AoU were a bit forced. ""Went all banksy..."" etc. But other than that, they balance it pretty well."
comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,OrinCurry,2,Sat Jul 11 19:52:06 2015 UTC,"It's pretty appropriate. It's equal to the amount found in the comics, similar style. People forget that these movies are still for kids, the comic books they are based off of are for kids too. Just because adults (myself included) like to enjoy them too doesn't mean everything should be hardcore. I'd rather the movie was still PG-13, because as soon as you go to R, a good chunk of money is lost. I want the studios to keep making money and keep making films, it's the closest representation of comics in film so far (other than Watchmen). I'm very pleased so far."
comicbookmovies,3cvhyp,plymouthpower,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:06:49 2015 UTC,Comedy is necessary for entertainment. Even the Expendables was a comedy movie using relics from all sorts of action movies. Blowing up stuff and being serious isnt as entertaining. Even Daredevil has foggy nelson as the comic relief.

But honestly, I don't think ""best on-screen Batman"" is a very high bar to reach.  I've enjoyed all of the Batman movies (some more than others), but I don't think they've really cast a great Batman/Bruce Wayne yet.  They're much better at casting Superman."

Edit: just to be clear I'm not saying he's a bad writer or can't pull it off I'm just cautious after how the GL film turned out. I was mostly excited for that film because he was saying all the right things/made it appear he had a lot of control.
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,Level27invisible,19,Fri Jul 10 02:05:52 2015 UTC,"Green Lantern the animated series, not Green Lantern the abortion of a movie that starred Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively. The cartoon is actually very good, as opposed to the movie, which is the opposite."

comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,Gioezc,12,Fri Jul 10 00:39:33 2015 UTC,Death in the Family. One of Batman's most tragic stories.
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,IanMazgelis,4,Fri Jul 10 00:42:49 2015 UTC,The only good part of death in the family is the bit when Jason dies. The rest is kind of shitty imo with the joker ambassador and stuff.
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,vidiyan2857,6,Fri Jul 10 01:45:18 2015 UTC,"Well most of the time when a film ""adapts"" a comic book it takes the one thing people remember from it, and then just makes a film with that.  See: Man of Steel ""adapting"" Birthright: The S means hope, The Dark Knight Rises ""adapting"" Knightfall: Bane breaks Batman's back"
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,IanMazgelis,7,Fri Jul 10 01:54:21 2015 UTC,Well just the bit with Jason dying isn't a very interesting film.  If they were to do under the red hood however....
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,vidiyan2857,3,Fri Jul 10 01:56:05 2015 UTC,"This is what I want too. I would love it if Jason is already dead and that is why Batman is supposedly in ""seclusion"" in BvS. Then after Superman brings him out of semi-retirement, do Under the Hood. You get the establishment of two previous Robins in this film and potentially one current Robin, the Joker, and Ra's Al Ghul in one movie.   Plus, you can do cameos from all the other villains as well. Seems like the best choice IMO."
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,ABTYF,3,Fri Jul 10 04:10:52 2015 UTC,We could get Ra's if they would adapt Tower of Babel? Then the movie would also we more tied to rest of the movies with so many JL characters
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,JohnTheWriter,2,Fri Jul 10 10:06:44 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I would love to see Tower of Babel adapted for a movie!  Though I think that I'd rather they establish the universe first, maybe put out a few years worth of movies before they venture into something like that.  Batman's ""betrayal"" could potentially have repercussions across the entire DCU, so if they're going to be setting up other teams and characters outside of the JL, I'd like to see them do that first."
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,MrsMxy,2,Fri Jul 10 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"After the trailer today, I'd say you were spot on."
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,turp119,2,Sat Jul 11 21:27:30 2015 UTC,"But you can do an interesting movie about Jason dying. It would work in the context of Under the Red Hood, but it doesn't need it."

comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,Gioezc,3,Fri Jul 10 00:45:36 2015 UTC,I'm not AS big of a fan of Court of Owls as some people are but I think it would work well as a movie compared to other long form Batman storylines.
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,ectomimedbison,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:39:41 2015 UTC,Definitely. Yeah I can't argue with your opinion. You're not a big of the fan that's cool. The whole Court of Owls thing just reminds me of Hydra. A movie where the Court of Owls is to Batman as Hydra was to Captain America in Winter Soldier would be so awesome. Obviously they have their differences but in the best of ways.
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,Gioezc,3,Fri Jul 10 01:48:18 2015 UTC,I like the story quite a bit I'm just not quite the slavish defender of it that a lot of people are. But yeah it's very Hydra and Batman works well against a conspiracy. Plus you don't have to do Night of the Owls in full but maybe show Nightwing and Robin and get a sense of the larger Batfamily. It's a good movie idea for the same reason it was a great first arc for the New 52.
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,ectomimedbison,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:56:45 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think Nightwing or Robin were a major part of the Court of Owls story arch. They rarely showed up. A good story arch that would allow people to get to know the family would Death of the Family. Mind you it's a joker story but the members are a very important part of the story.
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,Gioezc,2,Fri Jul 10 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"Nightwing at least has a significant role, since Dick has a major confrontation with Bruce in the Batcave. Robin I think only appeared at the beginning of the arc and in the Night of the Owls crossover. Regardless, it's not about making a movie with the Family in major roles so much as establishing that they exist."
comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,ectomimedbison,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:13:42 2015 UTC,You're very right. They did appear in those scenes. You make a good point in that just establishing would be an important part.

comicbookmovies,3cqd3q,traceitalian,2,Fri Jul 10 02:16:35 2015 UTC,That's very true. I didn't remember that. They did help Batman in that whole situation. That would fit very well in establishing them.

I never wanted it, but I know a few did. You could argue they might try some ""Long Halloween"" elements, but TDK was already inspired by it and LH doesn't really explore Batman's character as well as other comics have. It still does and is phenomenal, but I think there are other ones that they could pursue.   I'm inclined to think that with Geoff Johns on board and the current direction of the DCCU, they will probably adapt elements of Snyder and Capullo's Batman run to keep with the New 52 and on stuff. I'm personally hoping that they try pulling from Court of Owls since that does a great job of exploring a jaded, but still cocky Batman and has a great cinematic quality to it already.  Either that, or they make their own story which would also rock! So long as they avoid using the Joker (which I know they won't)."

Josh Trank is a young director with only one previous low(er) budget film under his belt as-well (if rumours are to be believed) a wild card.  It varies wildly from the source material apparently.

The all-black starter costumes don't help.  Dr. Doom being a ""hacker"" also sounded lame, but now we know he eventually gets the mask and becomes a more typical Doom. Too bad it looks strange.  Super generic trailers! One had that Kanye West song that's in lots of trailers nowadays, and another had the ultra vague, psuedo-deep line, ""What's coming?"" ""The answers.""  All that said, I'll give it a chance. The cast is great and the promotion seems to have moved away from emphasizing how edgy and serious it is. Mostly.  Personally, I don't think the hate is because it's from Fox. The X-Men movies are, too, and I know lots of MCU fans who still love those movies."

Doom is a hacker of some kind, Sue is adopted, Johnny is black, they're all young adults instead of adults, and the cast has said things along the lines of ""we haven't been reading the comics,"" or ""it's not based on the comics"" or something like that. It's not MCU, so people are upset that they believe Fox to be squandering some of the best characters Marvel has.

comicbookmovies,3cq2lj,RogueLeaderJ,2,Fri Jul 10 14:35:48 2015 UTC,They're probably only making the movie so they don't lose the rights to it.  I hadn't even heard of the new Fantastic Four until a little bit ago when people were mad that Johnny was black.
comicbookmovies,3cq2lj,protomenfan200x,7,Fri Jul 10 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so much the movie itself as the fact that it's being made by Fox. The last two F4 movies were terrible, and the strange marketing campaign (in other words ""Don't speak about the movie or show any footage until 6 months before it comes out"") didn't give people confidence. And of course, there's the bunch that are griping that it doesn't look exactly like the comics, and thus it already sucks. People have been ready to hate this movie for a long time, despite the fact there's only been two trailers and some TV spots. I should just note that I'm excited for this movie. There hasn't been a real ""hard sci-fi"" superhero movie yet, and the idea of Reed Richards by way of David Cronenberg sounds so cool.   And for those upset about how divergent the movie looks from the comics, take a look back at the first year of the series. Lee and Kirby originally wrote the characters as Trank seems to be interpreting them: normal people 'blessed' with freakish powers, who decide to use those abilities to take on strange and unearthly threats. It's evident from the more serious tone that the Man and the King were trying to do a more grounded, 'realistic' science fiction-based series, as a departure from the traditional superheroes of the Golden Age.  Of course, things got crazy once the costumes and more colorful villains were introduced, but the 'real world' vibe still permeates throughout the rest of Kirby and Lee's run. Take those early issues and combine them with the super-science and millenial-vibe of Ultimate Fantastic Four, and I think you'll find something similar to Trank's approach."

It's, first and foremost, a family drama. That's where the magic is, the family drama."
comicbookmovies,3cq2lj,antifanboydevon,2,Fri Jul 10 15:04:32 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of blame to pass around. Comic book fans are hesitant to embrace it because its not ""proper"" MCU. Casuals are hesitant because the last two movies were poorly received and underperformed at the box office.   The shoot was full of rumors about the director showing up on set drunk, on drugs or just flat out not caring. This was compounded with that Fox reportedly didn't have much faith in the movie to begin with. Which was set off Trank to begin with.   On top of all that NO ONE in the cast seems excited about it. I can't find a single interview prior/during/post shooting where the main cast outside of Michael B Jordan MAYBE seemed like they were having or had a fun experience filming. And poor Mr. Jordan has to continuously field questions concerning racism.   There just seems to be a swirl of negative energy surrounding this film and I believe its affecting how people are reacting to it.   How can I be expected to get up for a movie that no one at Fox or even the people directly involved seem to care about?"
comicbookmovies,3cq2lj,Vendevende,2,Fri Jul 10 15:23:42 2015 UTC,The director is a complete lowlife and has repeatedly disassociated his movies from the source material (hacker shit???)

The previous films were abortions and leave a sour taste.  It's not part of the MCU.
comicbookmovies,3cq2lj,shawarma_llama,2,Fri Jul 10 23:55:39 2015 UTC,"Because it looks like Fox just made a cheap, insincere movie using the Fantastic Four characters in a bid to hold onto the FF property rights and keep them away from Marvel/Disney for another 2-5 years.

I'm betting they want to try and build up their own cinematic universe with the FF and X-men. The X-men being separate I'm kinda OK with, because they've done a nice job with it so far. But I do hate how we're not getting Marvel's first family on the big screen. Just people that share their names and powers. Can we at least get the originals right before making movies about alternate versions of them?"
comicbookmovies,3cq2lj,Justice_Prince,4,Thu Jul 9 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"Really Fox would be idiots not to make this movie right now.

After Avengers came out, and the Disney buy out they were finally in a position to afford a buy back of the right, but they had no reason to given that the right were about to expire.  So really whether this move is a success, or it flops it's a win/win for Fox.  If it does well then they can make another.  If it flops then they can sell back the rights, and make what they hoped the net profit of what they hoped this movie, and it's hypothetical sequel would have made.  My guess is half a billion."

comicbookmovies,3cq2lj,BackslidingAlt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:40:28 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you a bit about what I expect out of F4 based on what I like from the comics and you can tell me if this movie should make me excited.  I want to see Reed Richards as a brilliant mind in the Universe, beyond Tony Stark more Professor X level brilliant. I want to see a Sue who is more than a match for him with the two providing a stable marriage as a basis for realistic heroics. Johnny is a playful but incredibly loyal wildcard and Ben as the begrudging naysayer who holds the moral tension for the team.  Together, They form a bright and shiny team. Like glistening. They are unity in diversity, 4 distinct Aristotelian personalities in concert greater than the sum of their parts. They are morally impregnable driven to both know and to do the right thing in all circumstances.  Sound boring? No. Because instead of easy internal demon storylines ripped from ghosts of failed comic movies past, F4 had huge, gritty, unspeakably evil villains to play with. Global domination is among the better outcomes F4 could deal with. More often it is total global destruction with only these four standing in the gap between hell and all of us.  F4 is relateable, not because it is realistic (it's not) but because they struggle externally with the things all persons struggle with internally. And they do so as astronauts, over a consistent theme of hope, science, exploration, discovery. A nostalgic theme from my youth, one I believe the world is ready to return to."
comicbookmovies,3cq2lj,timalexander,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:00:50 2015 UTC,"With all the talk about F4 crossing over with X-Men, it feels like they're about to tie up some great villains with something that just seems forced.  F4 have never been a team I've particularly liked, so take my views with a grain of salt. But the four team members and all their villains fit much better into the MCU then they do in their own universe, or in the X-verse (I dunno if they is what we're calling it, but it felt right).  In the MCU, the events that lead to them getting powers could be a great way to go with Phase 4. Infinity War has happened, people's views on the Avengers / SHIELD / heroes are mixed. These 4 random humans gain these powers and decided to be their own group, with PR and branding upfront. Reed as a scientist makes him fit in a world with Stark, Pym, Banner, etc.  It would also be nice if they ever got around to doing Maximum Carnage, for Reed to be the one to provide the Sonic Gun, and for Johnny to maybe take the place of Firestar in that story.    If they stay in their own universe, I doubt we will see more than 2 or 3 movies. This could be where my bias comes in, but I don't think you have enough great stand alone stories that will translate properly to film. Rise of the Silver Surfer is great evidence of people not knowing what to do once you want to expand outside of F4vDoom formula.    X-Men is, and always will be its own thing. While it would be great to see what Marvel could do with mutants in the MCU, it's widely accepted that the X-Verse is so big, it almost makes sense that it's separate from the goings on of the Avengers. Crossing the F4 with the X-Men just doesn't make a lot of sense. I'm sure there are stories where they've teamed up or fought or whatever...But 4 super powered people are just a drop in the bucket of the X-Verse. I'd be worried they'd make a convoluted story to make it even worth it.  TL;DR: MCU is a great fit for the F4. On their own, there's not enough there for it's own movie-verse. Crossed with X-Men is a maybe, but it will probably feel forced."

It's not like Bruce Wayne wakes up one morning and is suddenly a principled, gritty crime-fighter. We're seeing young Bruce slowly develop some of the traits he'll use as Batman. I don't see why the Gotham universe can't image Joker developing some of his tics in a similar way.  Plus, while the ""Batman created Joker"" theme is big in many Batman portrayals, Gotham seems to be twisting on that theme - the balance and order in Gotham came from the powerful people, both light (Thomas and Martha Wayne) and dark (Falcone). It was already hinted last season that the death of the Waynes released a lot of the chaos that's now overtaking Gotham, and with Falcone out of the picture too, it's very likely we see the city start really evolving into the chaotic mess of colorful characters that defines Batman's era."

I guess I'm OK with the Gotham universe doing what they need to do to get Joker involved, though. It's either no Joker entirely or whatever they plan to do with him. Worse case scenario, if their version of Joker isn't compelling, we can all stop watching and go back to the universes with Jokers we like!"

Everything of relevance in X3 is undone before or during DoFP and Origins is just a shoddy retelling of X2 flashbacks.

comicbookmovies,3cnix9,jasonhaven,13,Thu Jul 9 11:17:56 2015 UTC,Snyder said he intentionally cast Affleck because he was larger than Cavill and wanted Supes to physically look up to Batman despite being so much more powerful. He thought it was a nice dynamic.

Does it say something about power and strength, or does it just seem cool because it's opposite of what one would expect?    The obvious approach--making superman look overpowered compared to Batman by making him physically beefier--would make Batman's resilience and perseverance in the fight seem even more impressive.    Frank Miller, however, took a different approach when he decided to depict both heroes as equally absurdly beefy in The Dark Knight Returns...I can best guess that this was to establish the sense in which the two characters were truly foils, or two sides of the same coin.  Perhaps Snyder's choice to make Batman look physically more imposing highlights the amount of physical effort (i.e. lifting, training) that Bruce has to go through to even stand a chance, and conversely making Superman's strength seem ""effortless""?    Maybe?  I guess I'm trying to give Snyder some credit here, since my own definite bias is that he creates visually thrilling but tonally and thematically confused work.  I hear early buzz that this movie has a great script...so here's hoping.  Edit: This was quite sincere.  I was hoping someone could help me see why this is a nice dynamic.  I honestly don't get the choice and wanted some elaboration.  No hard feelings to anyone."
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,davonian,8,Thu Jul 9 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"I like the dynamic, because size and bulk has nothing to do with Superman's strength.  It proposes a really cool dichotomy.  Batman can tower over Superman and try to intimidate him, but he's way outmatched in strength.  I want a shot where Batman walks right up to him, like, chest to chest.  Stares down at him, then Supes slowly hovers off the ground to reverse the difference."
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,5aucy,2,Thu Jul 9 17:51:48 2015 UTC,That could potentially be very effective.
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,davonian,3,Thu Jul 9 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"Idk if it's nice or not, those were his words not mine lol so no hard feelings there.  To me, I see the dynamic as since this is an older Batman, this is reflective of his age and experience in the field. He is tougher, grittier, and less refined than the Blue Boyscout who is, for most intents and purposes, a naive idealist. His size, simple costume, and clean-shaven appearance indicate that. Having them physically different establishes the foils even more so between the two. Superman is young and inexperienced, while Batman is old and jaded. Their battle is a sort of battle between how they see the world needs to be saved.  So my interpretation was that these differences in appearance are more so to exemplify their personality and perspective differences than anything else. I could be completely off-base, but I like interpreting it this way so I'll continue to do so lol"
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,TheTinyTim,2,Thu Jul 9 20:33:28 2015 UTC,Exactly how I see it.    Bruce being taller and Clark having to look up to him is both literal and figurative. Don't forget that at the end of the day Batman is gonna be the one teaching Superman all the tricks of the job.
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,Canvaverbalist,2,Fri Jul 10 02:04:52 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it is always assumed that Superman can crush Batman. He can, because Superman is basically a God. BUT if you look at the two of them, and Batman is the bigger one, Batman is the one with more experience, Batman is the bigger badass, then maybe you aren't so sure if Superman is going to wipe the floor with Batman. In my opinion that's the dynamic that the height difference creates."
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,Chesapeake_Gentleman,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"I think it also puts forth that Batman is the ultimate human, he's the best we have, here he is... He's big, fast, smart, skilled, etc... and yet... nothing compared to alien boy."

comicbookmovies,3cnix9,IanMazgelis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:51:57 2015 UTC,If the origin of the armor is true then Batmans armor may have been used in a previous battle with Superman but another person was wearing it at the time.
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,neoblackdragon,5,Thu Jul 9 20:49:24 2015 UTC,"Details I appreciated:   The way the cape is fastened on Batman's tank suit (or whatever you call it). It looks very practical and he could easily detach it if he needed to. Superman now has a gold-ish belt in his costume, and a similar gold color in the background of his ""S"" logo on his chest. The Greek(?) writing circling Wonder Woman's shield. All the battle damage on Batman's gear, and unless I'm mistaken and it's scratches on the display case, it looks like WW has some battle damage on her uniform as well."

comicbookmovies,3cnix9,sergemeister,0,Thu Jul 9 16:32:55 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be too sure. Remember the impact that Hot Wheels had on Green Lantern? They shoehorned a whole commercial for Hot Wheels in there.
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,kbean826,0,Thu Jul 9 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the issue with this scene.  This seems like a perfect thing for a guy who'd be about Hal Jordan's age to think of in a moment of panic.  Is it a commercial?  Sure, but it's also pretty in character."
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,sergemeister,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:31:40 2015 UTC,My only point was that it (the Hot Wheels car) could still be used in the film.

comicbookmovies,3cnix9,kbean826,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:18:41 2015 UTC,Exactly.
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,ducducguz,3,Fri Jul 10 02:11:17 2015 UTC,"Superman pulls apart the metal suit to reveal the Batman beneath.  In the aftermath of the battle, the remnants of the suit are seemingly lost, but have actually been found by engineer John Henry Irons.  John Henry quit his tech job, protesting the company's exploitation of the poor in the reconstruction of Metropolis.  But he is a man of action, and unable to stand by while innocent people are in trouble.  He reconstructs the armored suit, replacing the black cape with a red one, in honor of his hero, Superman.  This is how John Henry Irons becomes Steel.  At least, the armor reminds me of Steel's armor, minus the red cape."
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,kbean826,2,Thu Jul 9 20:02:11 2015 UTC,We're going back to the cowl that is solid to the shoulders?  I feel like this was appropriately and excellently done away with in Dark Knight?
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,neoblackdragon,5,Thu Jul 9 19:22:28 2015 UTC,The reason that was done was so the actor could actually move his head around.   The new Cowl allows the actor the same amount of movement plus connects to the shoulders. Basically the cowl is less solid then it looks. This aided by the fact the cowl doesn't look glossy. This probably allowed them far more room to work on the material.  The Armors suit works similar to the Dark Knight cowl though by being detached.
comicbookmovies,3cnix9,kbean826,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:47:38 2015 UTC,I hadn't seen that it allows for movement.  Photos?

Which I believe is the best choice as it prevents the writers of the shows getting handicapped by what by what's happening on the big screen, and vice versa.   It's worked (sort of) for marvel, due to having some tv shows made by Netflix (very cinematic, high quality shows). Also the characters they are focusing on are street level characters, and are lower in stature. That wouldn't be the case for DC, since the Flash is a key DC character."

comicbookmovies,3ckji2,redjc99,8,Wed Jul 8 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"Hoodie guy is Ed Skrein as Ajax, the villain.  The shot of Reynolds without scars is almost certainly from a scene taking place in the past - pre-Weapon X and maybe even pre-cancer Wade."
comicbookmovies,3ckji2,zeronationarmy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"Okay. I went to the IMDB page, and saw it was Ajax. I don't know his character, though. Looks kind of henchman-y to me.   That's what I was thinking. Is that Copycat(I always forget how to spell the actress' name...) with him? The angle makes her look different."
comicbookmovies,3ckji2,redjc99,8,Wed Jul 8 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well, I don't want to give too much away, but Ajax was one of the few Weapon X ""successes"" tasked with keeping the ""failures"" (such as Deadpool) in line. He's the main villain of the movie. He has super strength, and if memory serves, deadened nerve endings, so he can take a lot of punishment.  Yep, that's Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, though I don't think she'll be Copycat in this movie (like, no powers or anything, but still the love interest). And I agree, she looks quite different in that pic!"

comicbookmovies,3cia3y,BiDo_Boss,3,Wed Jul 8 03:32:49 2015 UTC,"Remember as well, though, that GL was coming off of TDK trilogy and Harry Potter so the whole air at WB was pretty dark. Green Lantern suffered more from tonal issues than anything else which ultimately falls on shoddy writing. If these guys are writing, I am confident it will be fine.  Additionally, DC will have had a few years to tinker with the flavor before diving in. My thoughts are that that is why they put the Flash movie where it is, so they have ample time to work out the project. This is a shared universe now, so rather than starting it ala Green Lantern, which is a difficult property anyway, they are just continuing it with the Flash which puts less pressure on the film to carry certain things.  And, you know, WB has been making some of the biggest movies for decades, I have a fair degree of faith in their projects even if they have had missteps in the past, every studio has. Even Disney Animation, with all their might, nearly went bankrupt in the 80s before Little Mermaid."

IMO the best way for a Spawn movie to stand out would be for it to be Medieval or Dark Age Spawn. Take the story away from the modern era so it doesn't get tied up in the current superhero offerings (Avengers, Justice League, X-Men). Also the older time period allows for much more brutality with axes, and swords.   You can do more practical effects (think Game of Thrones, Vikings) and add mysticism to the entire story. This also has the benefit of establishing that anyone can become Spawn and then allows you to make more movies with diverse settings. You could do Ancient China, WWI, Wild West and more.   To my knowledge there hasn't been a medieval comic book, superhero/antihero story. That time period is ripe with story opportunities and I think the supernatural aspects will play better than a modern story."

If Judge Dredd can get a reboot, why not Spawn.  I do think there needs to be a bigger fan base and a willing but great director takes the project. Maybe picked up by DC for production value, but Spawn is pretty relevant.    I'm not sure we really want a Spawn reboot if McFarlane is involved.   TM is crazy. Who turns down an offer from DC and Marvel. DC is taking Vertigo comics to a new level. I mean even crappy looking stories like iZombie has a tv show.

Spawn is a very dated character, and the stories people know him by are also clearly dated and no longer relevant to pop culture. Lifetime is absolutely irrelevant."
comicbookmovies,3ce1ty,YoureASoldierBodie,2,Tue Jul 7 15:16:55 2015 UTC,"What?  Spawn was one of the first comic book movies that started the current live action comic book movie trend. Amoung the list of Batman, Blade, and Judge Dredd (all before 2000 when cgi was fresh). Without it, there would be no MCU (imo*). Society would watch the first iron man and think its only for kids, the realized that kids cant watch it due to violence causing lower sales. Otherwise the avengers would remain animated. Those movies say yes to adults watching adult comic movies.   As for the relevance of the story of Spawn, a battle between heaven and hell with a punisher like character is always relevant."

comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,WilliamMcCarty,27,Mon Jul 6 07:59:31 2015 UTC,Yea his kills in comics are definitely more gruesome then this one. I mean in Man of Steel he even pleaded with Zod not to do this and to stop at which point Zod responded with never. There was literally nothing else Superman could have done to stop Zod in that moment. I also don't like when people say the death didn't affect him. Did they miss the part where he let out a room vibrating yell after looking at what he just did? Killing Zod clearly had a strong affect on him.

What happened in MoS is the kind of stuff that would likely happen if super-powered aliens tried to take over the planet, if not worse. And it would have been lights out for the entire planet if it wasn't for Superman. I'm not sure how people would have liked him to handle zod, but that was as realistic as it could get without being over the top. If they went a tamer route then the same people who bitched about the killing and the collateral damage would have been the same people bitching about how boring the movie was.

Now we saw that the Krytonians had hacked all of our broadcasting systems, and they had taught themselves ever language on Earth.  It's safe to assume they had to hack out databases too.  Initially the Kryptonians only knew that the scoutship had been activated.  I'd argue that it was her article as well that informed them that Kal-El was on the planet.

For that matter, the Lois Lane in this movie is not the Lois Lane that would pursue any story no matter how much it put her life in danger. She wandered off in the snow and tracked down the superhuman she met there. That's it. Any journalist or even non-journalist would try to find out about the superhuman that saved them from a robot."
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,kracov,-2,Tue Jul 7 02:30:24 2015 UTC,"http://www.comicbookmovie.com/superman/news/?a=82124  2) Lois Lane surviving a Kryptonian Laser blast that kills Kryptonians:   Earlier in the film, Superman enters the 18,000 year old Kryptonian vessel. He gets hit with a Kyrptonian laser whiplash that cuts open Superman's arm and he starts bleeding. Lois Lane, on the next scene, also gets hit by the same Kryptonian laser whiplash straight to the abdomen. The force of the blast was so strong, it knocked Lois against a wall, but she survives the blast as Superman saves her and destroys the droid. Later in the film, Lois gets a hold of a Kryptonian gun that shoots out the same beam that kills off super powered-godly Kryptonians with just 1 blast - Kryptonians that can withstand multiple missile attacks mind you, are no match for this laser... yet Lois Lane is. Lois Lane = Wonder Woman.   3) Kryptonians chasing Lois Lane around the Spacecraft:  Continuing above, when Jor-El converts Zod's spacecraft's atmoshpere into Earth's so Superman may regain his superpowers, and so that Lois can escape blasting her Kryptonian captives with above mentioned laser like a highly trained Agent, why were Zod's men chasing Lois around the ship like they had no superpowers. Clearly if Superman got his powers back, shouldn't the other Kryptonians?  4) Black Hole sucks in Zod's Ship and everything else but Lois Lane:   The Black Hole created by Superman's pod was so strong that it completely engulfed Zod's giant ship, while at the same time sucking in vehicles and other debris including all the Kryptonians trapped in it's vortex... except for one Lois Lane. She manages to fall freely away under the Black Hole waiting to be saved as everything else gets sucked all around her. Lois Lane = Wonder Woman part 2.   5) Zod's purpose of taking Lois Lane prisoner:   While in detainment, Lois was just locked up and served nothing else in the film. Lois later apologizes to Superman that Zod probed her mind in which she blames herself for the Kent's farmhouse being demolished, to which Superman retorted that it's not her fault and that his mind was probed too, so she shouldn't blame herself. If the writers had left out Superman being probed then Zod's action of taking Lois hostage would have had a purpose in the story, but the the writers didn't. So in other words, that whole scene of Lois' kidnapping was made to serve simply as a plot device by the writer in the story for Lois to meet Jor-El in order to conceive the idea to stop Zod and the World Engine."
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,onedrummer2401,3,Mon Jul 6 18:40:25 2015 UTC,"2) She didn't get shot with a beam weapon. The drone/droid/thingie used a prehensile limb of some kind, and it did almost kill her. Had superman not been there, she would have died.  Also, IIRC, it didn't cut superman. Just his shirt.  3) It wasn't the atmosphere that sapped supe's powers. It was something else in the ship. Everybody assumes it was the atmosphere, however if it were the world engine would have simply crushed superman in it's tentacle once he got a lungful of cloud because his powers would have been kaput.  4) Squared-Cubed law saved her ass. She fell off the plane far enough away that the singularity couldn't eat her.  5) Lois Lane's purpose on the ship was never information. She was a hostage to get him up to the ship so they could nullify his powers. Once he had been zapped with their ship's kryptonite ray, her purpose had been served."

This is the same atmosphere that make him and other Kryptonians basically gods on Earth, and yet he wants to make themselves like earthlings. It's just not a good plan for world domination.   9) Superman breaking Zod's neck as the only option:   ""Why did Superman kill Zod?"" That is the WRONG question to be asking. The real question is, did Superman even have to kill Zod in the first place? All it takes is for either: A) The family on the corner to move out of the way by going forward instead of continually inching to the right. B) Remember that Superman had Zod in a headlock in other words he had full control of subduing Zod which is the purpose of a headlock, so simply tilting Zod's head any other direction but right should do. Or Superman can basically just flying Zod in any other direction away from the family; tossing him works too - that's all they were doing to each other just the scene before that. In other words, breaking Zod's neck could have even been avoided.    13) Martha Kent too trusting of Lois before doubting:   Upon first meeting Lois asking about Clark, Martha basically invites her in and gives away her son's secret when she tells Lois about Jonathan's death and his grave. But then later, when Clark stops by, Martha asks him if he thinks Lois could be trusted."
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,kracov,4,Mon Jul 6 20:45:04 2015 UTC,"Zod says in the movie that he'd never stop trying to kill them. Even if Supes tossed him or tilted his head up, he'd eventually get another opportunity to kill that family or another one."
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,JeweliusCaesar,0,Mon Jul 6 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's what the Joker does, too.  But you're right, Zod is an unstoppable being that is hard to contain.

I've watched that scene a dozen times, and she doesn't give away shit. Clark does...at the grave. And this is after she's already seen his face in the scout ship, and put two and two together when she interviewed Clark's old schoolmate at the IHOP, so she kind of already knows.  9) Yes. He had to kill Zod. Zod had to die. Superman knew full well at that point that humanity had nothing that could contain him or Zod. No prison that would work. No way to remove Zod's powers. And Zod had just finished promising him that he would basically going on a rampage if superman didn't do something.  Zod has agency. He has a will of his own. He's not a Dragonball Z character who will change sides just because Goku and him had a good fight and they're friends now."

My issues with Man of Steel aside (I personally hated it, but not gonna fight someone who genuinely enjoyed it), I must say - when I think of a Superman/Batman pairing, I wish it were the optimistic/pessimistic dynamic from the Donner/Nolan characterizations, not what BvS seems to be."

Maybe it's because the first film is a over ten years older than I am but I never got the appeal.  That said, I wanted to see Man of Steel when it came out and really enjoyed it when I did. I felt like this was the film that showed Superman as both a saviour but also as someone who can be beaten down and actually has to make the hard choices.  I get traditionalists weren't too pleased but the ending with Zod was one of the best moments in the film for me. It showed him in a situation where he had to make the hard choice, where he had to decide whether to finally kill off the last remnant of his home to protect his new one or let it be destroyed.  Are there parts wrong with the film? Of course but for me, it was the film that finally made me like Superman and I didn't expect it to do that when I first watched it."

comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,300FeetPerSecond,-2,Mon Jul 6 22:33:24 2015 UTC,Neither of them kill. Most DC heroes don't. I was shocked by it when I first saw it but after discussion with some people it made more sense to me.
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,TheMurderCapitalist,6,Mon Jul 6 23:24:23 2015 UTC,"Not true. That is a misconception. Superman has killed a number of times, including some of his first appearances. It is a last resort and it is never something he feels good about.   Superman is not Batman.  As this article goes into detail about, he has even killed Zod, in the comics, in a more brutal fashion than the movie. (Kryptonite)   In Superman #22 by John Byrne, the character was faced with Zod and two of his cohorts, who had extinguished all life in a parallel universe that included a version of Earth. Superman, who had been called in by that world's Supergirl to help, ultimately executed the Kryptonian criminals using Kryptonite (which did not affect him because he was from a different universe and Kryptonite was slightly different -- something that would be used again in Infinite Crisis and other stories dealing with Superboy Prime). The Kryptonians had been previously rendered powerless by gold Kryptonite, and while they threatened -- as Zod did in the movie -- that they would never stop, that they would find a way to travel to Superman's world and kill everyone there as well -- they gave up their bluster and pleaded for mercy when Superman produced the Kryptonite. As you can see in the panel at top, Superman was unmoved, putting them to death for their crimes against humanity.      Most DC heroes don't.   Also untrue, DC heroes do a lot of killing."
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,300FeetPerSecond,-2,Mon Jul 6 23:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it doesn't happen, I'm just saying killing isn't his thing and is usually totally against others doing it. He completely shunned Wonder Woman prior to Infinite Crisis for snapping Max Lord's neck. To say DC heroes do a lot of killing is just not true. When it does happen it's usually a last resort, there are tonnes of consequences and they take shit from just about every other hero if it does."
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,TheMurderCapitalist,3,Mon Jul 6 23:41:58 2015 UTC,"Once GLs got the ability to kill Yellow Lanterns.. then just plain kill. They started to do a lot of killing.  Hawkman has a penchant for killing things.  Green Arrow kills people in The Longbow Hunters, IIRC in Year One as well.  Martian Manhunter does some killing in John Ostrander's run.  Pretty sure there's some killing in Kingdom Come - not so solid on that one.  I know there's more, and a lot of these there wasn't any backlash about it. The no killing thing originally came from the Comics Authority & being geared towards kids. There's a lot more killing than people want to admit in comics."

Kingdom Come isn't even in continuity, you might as well cite Red Son as well. Ollie is usually pretty against killing which is why they changed his character in Arrow to quit being a straight up murderer. J'onn being an empath, I can't see him killing all that much either but again, I'm not versed on his history as much. Supes, WW, GL, Flash don't kill unless its a specific story where them living with the backlash is meant to be a huge plot point"

Being that I can't pinpoint one off the top of my head, you could be right. However, after the Sinestro Corps War they were given the ability to kill, beyond just Yellow Lanterns. Hal kills Volthoom in the Wrath of the First Lantern when he becomes the Greatest Black Lantern - killing continues, though he does not do it often and that was a large plot point when he had no choice.   You're right, a lot of killing was strong. I guess my point was that even though they may be exceptions, there are a lot of them and they are typically justified (Like John Stewart snapping a fellow GLs neck to keep enemies from getting to Oa).  I guess the real point I wanted to make and I made the mistake of getting a bit argumentative was that killing happens a lot more than some people tend to think."

comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,CalProsper,3,Tue Jul 7 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"My take on the whole ""Superman doesn't kill"" thing is that he isn't really Superman yet in the movie. This is an origin story about Kal trying to find his place on earth. So he isn't the good, pure Superman that we know yet. That will come later. He's still pretty human. He still has emotions that he has to keep in check."

comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,kracov,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:05:40 2015 UTC,"The criticism, that's worth discussing, isn't about Supes killing Zod it's about what immediately follows, or more to the point what is lacking immediately after. Jurgens doesn't address that, and the interviewer doesn't even ask.   And the whole ""he kills in the comics"" therefore it's not a big deal is such an empty statement. The polar opposite of ""he doesn't kill in the comics,"" both quotes are true for different iterations of the character, but neither is a basis or argument for or against the MoS movie, which should be discussed on it's own merits/faults."

The tone was uncomfortably moody, the plot was absolutely filled with holes, the action, while cool, dragged on waaaaay too long to be enjoyable, and the product placement was the absolute worst I've seen besides the tansformers films. I couldn't care less about Superman killing Zod, he honestly should've done it to begin with rather than wrestle him through every building in Metropolis.  Edit: Downvotes for not liking Man of Steel. Never change /r/comicbookmovies, maybe one day you'll be as circlejerky as  /r/movies."

Superman is not about killing every superpowered villain he comes across.  He's a symbol of hope and peace, so for him to even kill is contrary to who he is and what he represents."
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,bliffer,-4,Mon Jul 6 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"My problem is that he did kill Zod, but only after he arbitrarily put one particular group of people at risk, Superman took no mind in the many people killed by their Dragonball Z esque battle.   I don't mind a Superman that kills, as long as it makes sense."
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,Arandmoor,0,Mon Jul 6 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah the film didn't have a constant tone, the krypton stuff had a Snyder like atmosphere while the ones on earth had a dreary dark tone like the Nolan films. Tbh Snyder should have gone focusing on a more Watchmen like tone that way it would be colourful and visually interesting to see. Thankfully Batman v Supermans tone is different to a Watchmen vibe."
comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,leif777,0,Mon Jul 6 20:29:04 2015 UTC,"I'm more concerned with why they did it. To show why Superman doesn't kill. You don't need to kill someone to think killing is wrong.  He screamed, so they clearly wanted to show that he wished there was some other way. So then why is he acting the same as always in the next scene? It makes it seem like he got over it. We never see anything indicating he didn't want to kill (because the filmmakers didn't give him that character trait until after the killing), so our expectation for action movie heroes to kill the villain made any emotion indicated by his scream seem as temporary as the next scene did.  Why bring Superman so low in the first movie? He should be an established great hero so that when he's put in a situation where he has to resort to breaking his personal rules it has emotional weight. I know this was a novice Superman, but we're left with an incomplete character arc. We only see the final, fully developed character for like two minutes at the end. Superman killing isn't dramatic if Superman isn't against killing.  With all that said, in the context of the story it makes perfect sense that Superman killed Zod. Whether or not he could have saved that family some other way, it was really obvious that Superman realized Zod would not stop attacking innocent people until he was dead. So even if Superman did find another way it would have been pointless. I'm tired of hearing that complaint.  All things considered, the killing needed to be built up, followed up, or removed. Luckily, BvS seems like it will have a lot of follow up."

comicbookmovies,3ca2o6,50ShadesofYay,-1,Tue Jul 7 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"Sups had no choice. I agree with that. The problem is that the script shouldn't have lead him down that road. It was the writers choices that backed him into a corner and IMO lacked an understanding of the character. They got a lot wrong. Jor El was wrong, the entire concept of Krypton was way off and their Jonathan Kent missed the point. All the building blocks of the story were put on a different foundation and Sups grew up in a different house and he wasn't the Superman we knew anymore at the end of the movie."

If that's how you feel then that is exactly where the script should have led him. You don't spoon-feed characters victory. They have to earn it by overcoming adversity.   The continual game of oneups-manship between events in the story and the difficulty faced by the main characters is called ""escalation"". You never de-escalate, and if you can't push things farther, you're not trying hard enough.  You know...unelss you're looking to write a movie that either doesn't sell tickets or kills a franchise. I mean, look at Return of Superman. What you're asking for is basically what they did, and that movie sucked."

Clark is like reading a philosophy book (either Socrates or Plato), i mean that image of the bullies pushing down superman on the ground with that specific book in his head is waaaay too on the nose in my opinion. If they had just shown clark maybe like up late at night reading, and then cut to that scene without him holding the book would have been just as effective and not too blatant. but then again there is the whole church scene with the priest and the christ symbolism... whatever i still love Man of Steel.

Luthor and Wayne are similar characters on the surface, genius billionairs who will engineer a solution to this problem, but we all know who is the inherently corrupt one.  So after the two agree to disagree but split their kryptonite stores, Luthor builds a Frankenstein monster that serves as an avatar of the man who made him and Wayne builds his armor, because Batman doesn't need an avatar, he does the dirty work himself. Also, it's an easy one off villain and Cavill can do double work, making it one of the last possible surprises in this news age.  Wonder Woman is the variable that will get the conflict to stop(and probably already knows Aquaman).  While Cyborg - maybe an injured soldier from the Metropolis battle, turns into the government's first Super-solution."

Joker is legitimately a narcissistic psychopath complete with mood disorders, possible dissociative identity disorder, and OCD. He's obsessed with Batman to the point of staging elaborate plans, heists, and slaughters people JUST to get Batman's attention with no actual regard for profits, escape, or to prove his superiority.

He's was left emotionally crippled and was with more than a few physical, emotional, and psychological issues as a result of the Weapon X programme, but he seems to have grown from that over the years to the point where even he pokes fun at it, however morbid that might be. What makes most people question his sanity however is that he is entirely self aware. He's is always consiously of the medium that he is appearing in be it comics, games, or movies. This separates him from most of his contemporaries as to everyone else he appears to either be mentally unstable, constantly and consistently talking about utterly inane topics or to unseen third parties.   Because of this many of them consider him to still be mentally fractured from the Weapon X experiments, when in actuality he's probably has a better frame of mind than anyone in the marvel universe."

I hope someone corrects me if I'm wrong, but the whole thing about Mysterio is that you have to accept that some of his tricks are inexplicable.  The basic premise is that he's a gifted and resourceful illusionist but that you'll never figure out how he does some stuff.  That's maybe okay in a comic book, but in a movie people are used to having mysteries explained to them.  If they don't get it explained they feel like the story wasn't wrapped up.  He is a great villain though and if they were making a movie just for me I'd love to see him.  It could be a darker story than most and visually interesting."

Spider-Man, motivated by grief and the rage from the symbiote, he tracks down Mysterio and murders him with his bare hands.

comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Melanismdotcom,33,Sat Jul 4 15:06:04 2015 UTC,"Back when I saw the movie it pissed me off because at a certain point it just seemed way too excessive. But thinking back on it, especially after reading a lot of Justice League graphic novels and watching a lot of that animated movies and TV shows, I'm a little less critical about the destruction. Nothing we've seen in Man of Steel ending is any worse than the destruction I saw in the comics and in the animated movies/shows.   However, if the destruction in Man of Steel doesn't play an integral role in Batman v. Superman, I'll probably start seeing problems. For continuity's sake it has to be the foundation for the movie because, realistically, the world would not be okay with it.   Avengers has been addressing that same thing except they've been doing a really shitty job at it. Whenever they do it just feels like they're just mentioning it in passing and then just cast it aside to stuff an Avenger on screen with a joke.  I have faith though. And good God I'm excited."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,thissiteisbroken,25,Sat Jul 4 15:48:28 2015 UTC,"Here's my thinking. I have no real problem with big scale destruction in these movies. It's a spectacle, and it makes a lot of sense given that we're pretty much just watching a bunch of gods fight each other in heavily populated areas. There are gonna be casualties. But MoS' handling of it was exceedingly terrible, in my opinion. I hated that movie for a few reasons, but one of the main ones was that they destroyed half of Metropolis, rained down a satellite that probably cost about a billion dollars, and at the end all we got was some dude warning Superman about the future and then some girl going ""he's so hawt.""   I think BvS will be a lot better. I'm excited for what that movie can be. I hope it's awesome. And like you said, if it deals more heavily with the consequences of the first film then a lot of my grievances will be dealt with. But man, oh man, that last twenty minutes of Man of Steel were crazy.   I also agree and disagree with your point about the Avengers movies. They deal with the consequences over the course of a few movies and TV shows, like Daredevil and AoS. The movies themselves don't do a great job of dealing with those consequences, but you also have to keep in mind that A. They have to be less than four hours long and B. The Avengers films are really targeted at all age groups. I would say that DC is going for an older audience, and should be more mature about their handling of massive destruction  events.   Edit: whoever is going through and down voting all of my comments. Stop that.   Edit edit: well all my comments are in the negative now, when they were in the positive. This happens all the time in this subreddit. I don't think I'll come round here much any more."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,17,Sat Jul 4 16:27:19 2015 UTC,I'd say the fallout of Avengers has been addressed very well. Especially in Cap 2 and Daredevil since it started the plots of both basically. Its been years in the MCU after all. I don't want to sit and listen to a two hour discussion of how the last movie ended. The impact it had on the world is clearly visible and that works for me.
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Try_Another_Please,9,Sat Jul 4 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"No, totally. The MCU deals with the consequences very well, but if we're looking at individual movies, the Avengers and AoU don't really touch on the implications too much. I didn't think it was fair to compare the MCU to one movie in the DCCU (is there an actual name for it?) since it isn't as well established yet."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,2,Sat Jul 4 20:26:57 2015 UTC,Well the Avengers doesn't sure but that's because it was the end of the movie. Due to the shared universe format AOU isn't going to much either. Several movies already dealt with the personal and worldly impact of New York before Ultron and it seems the next several movies (and AOS) will deal with the impact of the Sokovia incident.
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Try_Another_Please,4,Sat Jul 4 20:37:13 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was saying. I'm not knocking the Marvel movies, I'm just saying it's not fair to compare the way one movie (Man of Steel) handles its consequences against a series of movies (the MCU)."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,7,Sat Jul 4 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"Think about it- The villians always use humans as a shield or tool against the heroes.  Even if Supes had taken Zod to antarctica to battle, Zod would have zoomed back to Metropolis to exploit Supes' weakness for humans.  These battles are difficult and avoiding casualties makes it much more difficult for the hero.  What does Batman want? He wants Supes to go to jail for saving the world (and as a result, the world avoids total enslavement by Zod)? When a team of policemen raid a place, there can be casualties and gunfire will be exchanged.  If a child is shot in the process, does that mean the police should be imprisoned for their actions? If we jail all our heroes for unfortunate accidents, there will be no more heroes, except for Batman, according to his own logic."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,kracov,6,Sat Jul 4 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly what your point is. Like I said, I understand the carnage and that there will be casualties. I wasn't blaming Supes for it. It makes sense that the villain would try to exploit the hero's weaknesses. A battle in Metropolis isn't bad, nor is the destruction, if you handle it right. But in the Avengers many of the shots in the Battle of New York were of the Avengers attempting to save people. In MoS it mostly felt like destruction porn."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,2,Sat Jul 4 17:43:12 2015 UTC,To be fair that's because the individual avengers are weaker than Supes. A one on one fight is very different than two armies (one of them 6 people so it's a stretch I know). There are countless moving pieces and chaos so they have time to hide ro save people. Zod and Supes were the only ones. Zod is laser focused on Clark and nothing is there to distract him. Anyone Clark picks up will just be killed by zod when he hits him.
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Try_Another_Please,3,Sat Jul 4 20:03:26 2015 UTC,"That's not totally true. I mean, yeah anyone he picks up would be killed by Zod, but there are many other ways he could save people. But I know he can't save everyone. I'm not saying that. I get that a fight between two nearly invincible beings will result in tons of dead bystanders. They just didn't deal with it all that well in the movie."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,5,Sat Jul 4 20:23:53 2015 UTC,I just mean if he gets anywhere near anybody they will die.That's why he tried to go to space and then got thrown back. Say he catches debris over someone. Now when Zod hits him over the head with that debris it's going to kill the person. He goes one way a building collapse follows him. If he were in control or on equal footing it'd be different. But he wasn't. He was losing a good deal of the time and he's never done this before. I just don't see a reasonable way that he;s going to go near civilians. It would what Zod wanted.
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Try_Another_Please,0,Sat Jul 4 20:35:35 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. But again, that wasn't the point of my original comment. I'm not trying to argue that Superman was in the wrong or that the destruction was unnecessary. Just that it wasn't handled, by the director or the writers, in a graceful way. By which I mean that there was little to no acknowledgement that half of Metropolis was destroyed. Who is to blame? What do we do with Superman now? It's all good for Mr. Snyder to come out and defend it now, but none of what he said in this interview is anything I could have gleaned from the movie. And they'll be dealing with it in BvS, but that doesn't automatically go back and make MoS less of a mess."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,4,Sat Jul 4 20:40:12 2015 UTC,I guess I just don't think the immediate end of the movie has to be touched upon in great detail in the movie in all cases. The battle is the end. Time would have to pass before any of those questions could answered and I think DOJ is a better place to allow that. Long term fallout fits better in a sequel sometimes which seems to be exactly what they are doing. MOS was never going to be the only movie in telling this story and I think it's better to allow it to breathe. Clearly the impact is planned to be huge with batman and the others involved.
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:47:56 2015 UTC,"All that really needed to happen is one little scene showing that bad things happened, and this is going to cause some issues in further movies.  It could be something as simple as Clark back with Ma Kent listening to the news and hearing people on the news bitching about how much destruction there was and a politician going on about how they can't trust this Superman guy to defend them and they need to find out who he is and get him in line.  Or something like have Clark go to the Bugle (like he did) and then give him his first assignment to go interview politician X who is sponsoring a bill to bring in Superman as a government agent, or politician Y who wants to throw him into custody due to all the damage...  Anything like that - just subtle hints like we saw/heard in the trailer for BvS that show the bigger picture.  As it was, it ended pretty consequence free and now it'll back-track for the sequel."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,craiye,0,Sun Jul 5 05:00:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the movie has to do an in-depth analysis of what happened. But if you want something to be well rounded, any story, then actions happen and they have consequences. Be they mentioned in big ways or little. Even a subtle nod would have been ok. Anything. But we didn't get any of that. The last scene of MoS was fucking dumb."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,2,Sat Jul 4 21:00:00 2015 UTC,"Superman was trying to save people by defeating general zod.  This guy has the same powers, how do you balance fighting that guy and trying to also save humans?  Especially since the scene where he was going to voip that family indicates Zod probably may very well just outright kill the people Superman was trying to save."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,chickenburgerr,2,Sat Jul 4 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"You're completely missing my point. I agree with you. It isn't the destruction or the fight itself I have a problem with. Just like I said. I'm not arguing that Superman could have done anything to prevent said destruction. I'm saying that  we saw none of the consequences of, like, three buildings full of people being wrecked. Not even a real acknowledgement. That's not a good handling of something like that. If you're gonna try to act all dark and mature in your movies, you have to deal with the implications of huge events like that. Otherwise it's spectacle for spectacle's sake."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,3,Sat Jul 4 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"It's Zack Snyder.  It's a differently styled comic book movie. I guess he wanted something darker and end-of-the-world events that would make the audience WORRY about. In a way, this particular movie is better than other CB movies in that it tries an original styling.  I don't want every CB movie to be where the hero has to save everybody every time.  Each CB movie should have something new or original, and ZS tried that and I think it worked well even though Supes should be a symbol of hope.  Remember the Batman sequels in the 90's? They were trash, in part because it was too much cheesy comic book dialogue, plot, action, and characters.  With The Dark Knight the director aimed for something different- darker, more serious, and it had characters that deviated from the past Batman movies a little bit.  It was a huge success because of it.  I'll still like Superman 1 better than MoS, but MoS is still a great movie that evolved from past mistakes pretty well."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,kracov,-1,Sat Jul 4 20:47:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree strongly that MoS is any kind of good movie, but that's subjective. What exactly was ZS trying that was new? I'll never understand this sub's love of him. He's done some good stuff, but ""mature"" isn't something I would call any of his movies. His artistic style is great, don't get me wrong. But I thought that MoS had a lot of problems.   Also, I think calling MoS ""great"" is... a bit of an exaggeration, in my opinion."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,4,Sat Jul 4 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe he was trying a little too hard with MoS, and wanted something action-packed because of Superman Returns.  He had big shoes to fill.  I call MoS great because... well, look at the past DC movies.  Most of them (about a dozen) were gigantic failures.  When I say new styling I mean the comic book character being a little more self-focused than the typical CB movie hero, and near the end many people had to become their own heroes or save themselves."

Brandon Routh ain't the greatest actor, but he fit the role. Hell, I like Henry Cavill as Supes a lot. And I agree that he tried to put so much action in because people hated Superman Returns so much. I think a balance needs to be struck. Which is why Batman is such a perfect character to bring into a sequel. If he can pull it off, BvS will be amazing."

comicbookmovies,3c3wus,time_lord_victorious,5,Sun Jul 5 07:45:35 2015 UTC,"The big difference to me is that the avengers deal with the destruction while it's happening.  They don't need to talk about it afterwards, although they do use it for plot seeds and background, because the Avengers deal with it while it's happening.  The end of both Avengers 1 & 2 is all about then saving people while the destruction is happening, there's talking about how to minimize it while it's happening.  Superman destroys metropolis and never seems to take a moment to wonder if maybe this fight should happen elsewhere, or if he should hold that building up, etc etc.  I still liked the movie, but I think it could have used a couple of those little moments to show he's a hero, and to show that being a hero costs him something other than existential angst."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Jason207,6,Sat Jul 4 21:29:26 2015 UTC,"but he's not a hero yet. This was really his first go at the saving game, and he had no clue in hell how to do anything. I have little problem with the destruction itself for that reason, it is more or less the handling of it after the fact that I find problematic.  Remember also, though, the Avengers enemies were not entirely after the Avengers but rather wanton destruction. Their job in that case is to get the people away from them, putting them in between the enemy and people to do so. Zod's mission, beyond the world engine, was attacking Superman so for Supes to grab civilians makes no sense, Zod would just kill them.  Zod was not attacking people, he was simply using the world engine to annihilate Earth and humanity; he was letting the engine kill people for him. Superman stopped the engine, now there is no more destruction beyond Zod himself who is royally pissed at Superman for stopping his plot. Superman going after Zod was the means of being ""heroic"" in that sense."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,TheTinyTim,3,Sat Jul 4 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"But Zod was trying to destroy Earth, or at least terraform it to Kryptonian standards. He didn't care about Superman until Metropolis was already pretty much destroyed by the World Builder machine."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Tellatale,2,Sun Jul 5 01:34:52 2015 UTC,"fair enough. I mostly reconcile this with the idea that the DC universe is going to approach Superman as an evolving character over the films. The biggest critique people have of the character is that he is stale and boring, this is DC's way of bringing depth to his character.  This is answering the question (I hope) of why is he so set in his morals? What drove him to being the ""big, blue boyscout""? What made him stand resolutely for truth, justice, and the American Way? I see this movie as intentionally not fully Superman in the sense that they wanted to show this growth of character of the course of the series.  I could be simply optimistic and reaching, but it reconciles it in my mind and keeps me content lol"
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,TheTinyTim,2,Sun Jul 5 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"I think that they could have tacked on another few minutes to address the calamity and round out the film better, but there are also different rules for cinema with these universes."

comicbookmovies,3c3wus,KingofCraigland,14,Sat Jul 4 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"With regard to your Avengers comment, how so?   In AoU, they refuse to leave a single civilian behind. Tony even considers financial implications of the battles mid battle. Daredevil's inciting incident is the rebuilding of Manhattan after the Battle of New York. Politically, Winter Soldier is in response to Avengers and Thor 2, with project insight being excused as a response to global threats like those previously seen. Hell, the entire driving force of Civil War (traditionally) is a super hero related disaster resulting in public outrage against wanton destruction.  Meanwhile in the span of two minutes in Man of Steel we go from Supes killing zod amongst the rubble of a flattened city to flirty dick jokes like nothing even happened. Supes and Zods fight went into space, then straight back to Metropolis. Could've punched zod to anywhere in North America, but nope, straight back to Metropolis.   People rip on Marvel but honestly so much of the stories deal with the aftermath, and consequences, of super heroics."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,C1ank,4,Sun Jul 5 02:47:06 2015 UTC,"The thing about the MCU that feels somewhat ""off"" is that the public reaction  feels too light. If aliens were to really invade NYC, it would fundamentally change people's social, political and religious lives.   Owlsely, in Daredevil, couldn't just make a flippant comment about how there needs to be new buildings made. He, along with every other person on the planet, would be losing their minds, knowing that hostile aliens are trying to kill us. It would become the only issue that matters. People wouldn't be worrying about drug dealers in Hell's Kitchen. They would be trying to figure out how to stop Dark Elves from destroying half of London.   Now keep in mind, that doesn't stop me from loving these movies. It just makes them feel less realistic. Which is fine, but clearly different from what DC is shooting for."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,doyleb3620,5,Fri Jul 10 19:16:39 2015 UTC,"Fair points. I suppose the argument can be made that weird shit has been happening in the MCU for decades. Captain America fought a mutated Nazi, Ant Man was supposedly active decades prior, Inhumans have been screwing around for millennia, Kree and Asgardians keep messing with Earth. Perhaps, while there's very likely shock and surprise, there's just slightly less than there would be in our world. ""Yeah, aliens are a huge shock, but remember chapter twelve of your high school history book where Cap punched a tank?"" I guess they live in a weirder world, and even if the general public rarely interacts with the weird, it would still linger in the collective consciousness.   I think Civil War is really going to be where they cast focus on the public opinion of all the recent crazyness in the MCU, and I've heard Ant Man addresses it in part."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,C1ank,4,Sat Jul 4 20:34:52 2015 UTC,Daredevil seems to be where they address it. Though not their problem to try and fix but it makes sense story and timeline wise
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,nerfAvari,2,Sat Jul 4 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"Back when I saw the movie it pissed me off because at a certain point it just seemed way too excessive.   For me, it felt redundant (though we might just be assigning different words for the same feeling). We saw nothing in the Superman vs. Zod final fight that we hadn't already seen between Superman and Zod's minions. Had that first fight been shorter, the latter could have lasted as long as it did and not feel like they were just covering the same ground.  (though really, I wish that they hadn't been so evenly matched; Superman should have had more raw power, given that he'd been on Earth his entire life, but Zod should have been physically weaker but martially and tactically superior.)"
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,EVula,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:56:46 2015 UTC,There's a greater distance from reality with comics and cartoons though. The movie almost almost turned into a horror film because the scale of destruction was so great.

Superman, I'll probably start seeing problems. For continuity's sake it has to be the foundation for the movie because, realistically, the world would not be okay with it.   Did you see the trailer for Batman v Superman? Obviously what happened in Metropolis will play an enormous role.  That statue of Superman that the camera is slowly approaching? Look around it. It's built on an enormous plot of flat land, that's ground zero from Zod's World Engine, you can see the other building from Metropolis circling around it. And around Superman there are multiple stone monoliths around him, if you look closely it's covered in names.  That statue of Superman with FALSE GOD written over it is a memorial for everyone who died during Zod's attack on Earth.   Superman saved the entire world, literally. He'll be seen as a godlike savior, and as a demon who's doomed the world. That's what BvS is promising."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,whatudontlikefalafel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:51:39 2015 UTC,"The problem is that there's a major double standard.  First, it's apples and oranges.  Comparing them on any scale other than personal preference is a waste since they're trying to do different things in different ways.  Second, everyone compares MoS to an Avengers universe that is 11 movies in, yet simultaneously knocks DC for moving too fast without solo films.  Iron Man was good, but Marvel movies were just mostly OK until Avengers.  Avengers was awesome, but a lot of it was more in concept than execution.  When crossovers are commonplace, I think people will see it differently."

comicbookmovies,3c3wus,RedBarrel,3,Mon Jul 6 15:32:52 2015 UTC,He's saying it's strange how people doubt Snyder is even conscious of it. He uses gratuitous violence to disgust as much as he uses it to impress.
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,whatudontlikefalafel,14,Sat Jul 4 23:33:58 2015 UTC,"But he misses the point of the criticisim, it isn't just the destruction. It's the fact that the film dosen't comment on the destrution, it's the latter part that's the important piece."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,mrmazzz,6,Sun Jul 5 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"It doesn't comment on it, and Superman does little to prevent it.  Of course, we know Superman is just learning the extent of his powers, and he's grappling with someone of equal power to himself. So he should be unable to prevent the destruction. But in that case, like you said, the film needs to comment on it.  Basically, if you claim we were supposed to feel the weight of the destruction, and it wasn't simply pyrotechnics, then you're saying the movie was about Superman failing. And that's supported by the fact that Superman has to break his one rule, but killing Zod. He failed to prevent destruction, and he failed to live up to his ideals. That has the potential to be an amazing story, but the movie never seems to present it as failing.  I'm in the camp that hated Man of Steel. To me, the worst, most stomach-churning moment, was when Superman and Lois Lane kissed in the center of destruction. They are at ground zero of death and devastation far exceeding 9/11, likely surrounded by thousands of corpses obscured by the dust, and take the chance to kiss. At best, it's weird. So it's hard for me to believe Snyder when he claims this was all intentional and not simply tone deaf.  Despite that, I'm still really interested to see Batman/Superman. I don't think Snyder's comments are believable as a defense of Man of Steel, but I do think they're encouraging for the future. Superman failing to protect the earth is a great impetus for Batman to come after him, and ultimately a great impetus for the formation of the Justice League. It gives us a good answer for the question ""why do we need the Justice League if Superman is so powerful?"" He's not powerful enough."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,FranchiseTag,3,Mon Jul 6 05:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I like MoS, mostly because I'm a longtime fan of Superman, and everything he said (and has done so far) on the destruction follows the comics. That includes the destruction and killing Zod.   But where he deviated from the comics (the Lois & Clark bit, product placement, and Jonathan Kent's death) were the weak parts of the film. And the bleakness until the very, very end didn't help much.  The fight scene felt exactly like Superman vs. Doomsday brought to life, and the destruction was par course for comics (one early 2000's story had Kansas get destroyed. One city is nothing.)  EDIT: I'm stoked for BvS because it looks like Snyder is once again copying late 80's superman: killing zod is where the ""no kill rule"" comes from in the post-crisis world. For the uninitiated, Superman, unlike Batman, doesn't have a pathological aversion to killing. His purity comes from killing someone no one else would see an issue with killing and realizing that it's wrong for him, even if it's justifiable. The destruction stuff has been covered a lot, but I imagine it'll be both impetus for Superman to grow as a hero and for people to oppose him."
comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Patius,-3,Sat Jul 4 19:23:48 2015 UTC,"I think the problem was the storytelling ultimately. I trust that Snyder really did mean to craft a movie about Superman failing to live up to his ideals, everything in the film up until his failure would indicate that. The issue is that it all just ends too abruptly for those tremors to be felt by the audience. Yes, Supes was torn up about having to kill Zod, that was addressed nicely, but everything else was not addressed, and saying a future film does that is admitting that your story was not good enough to do it the first time."

comicbookmovies,3c3wus,Frozen_Canadian,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:48:00 2015 UTC,"Supes was putting forth all his effort to survive that fight. If he was distracted by saving innocents, he would have lost from the way the battle was going. Zach Snyder solved the problem Superman usually runs into, where he comes off as invincible and there's no actual skin in the game or he loses/gets knocked down because of something stupid. You can't solve the problem convincingly and keep everyone alive when dealing a battle where Superman's life is at stake."

comicbookmovies,3c2wet,Gr8bellsoffire,-2,Sat Jul 4 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"A good run?  They've made what like 8 movies and only the last two are okay.    Take their best two and put them against any marvel movie and rate them together.   Xmen might only beat thor2 and ironman3.  But for a majority of them they would lose in a head to head comparison.  Marvel has made also like what 8 movies?  And I can only think of two that weren't that awesome.  So marvel is the exact opposite of fox, in terms of success.   I would argue further that xmen would almost assuredly be better in the hands of marvel. Think of the story lines that could happen with that."
comicbookmovies,3c2wet,salisburymistake,2,Mon Jul 6 16:28:38 2015 UTC,"A good run as in box office, not quality. Every film in the X-Men franchise has made money, and the combined profits of all 7 films amount to over 2 billion dollars for Fox. And yes, that includes the objectively shitty Wolverine: Origins.  Compare that with Sony's Spider-man. Five films and a total profit of $2.9 billion. It's made more money over the course of fewer films than the X-Men did for Fox. So why then would Fox not follow Sony's lead and share the X-Men with Marvel? There are more factors to consider. Though Spidey comes with his own additional side characters and villains, the X-Men universe is by its very nature much, much bigger. How much of that universe would Fox have to share with Marvel, and what percentage of the resulting profit should they expect in return?  From a fan's perspective, it's a no-brainer; Marvel Studios knows how to adapt their material better than anyone else out there. But both sides would have a ton of shit to consider and work through before they ever got close to making a deal. At this point I do think there are people at Fox running the numbers, but it will probably take a few big misses like Sony had with the last 2 Spidey movies before they'd seriously pursue it."

comicbookmovies,3bzr7k,batguano1,3,Fri Jul 3 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"Looks fun. It's tracking for a 65M opening weekend which is pretty good for an Ant-Man movie, so I think the movie will be fine and do well. It's getting good reviews anyways"
comicbookmovies,3bzr7k,Frozen_Canadian,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:08:01 2015 UTC,Reviews already?
comicbookmovies,3bzr7k,batguano1,2,Fri Jul 3 19:45:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry, by reviews I mean Twitter reactions after press screenings as of now but for the most part they've enjoyed it. A few people said bleh but that's bound to happen"
comicbookmovies,3bzr7k,Frozen_Canadian,2,Fri Jul 3 19:49:52 2015 UTC,Oh ok makes sense. Also James Gunn said its his favorite MCU movie since the first Iron Man so there's that
comicbookmovies,3bzr7k,batguano1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah at first I was gonna say ""oh he's a Marvel director so yeah he loved it of course"" but Gunn actually replied to the people saying that stuff that he's been vocal to Marvel movies he didn't like that much so hey, there's that. Gunn was spot on with Daredevil as well"

comicbookmovies,3bzr7k,frank_13v,4,Sat Jul 4 04:18:34 2015 UTC,I have this inexplicable hunch that more than three people will see this movie.
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,filmfanatic5,15,Thu Jul 2 15:09:42 2015 UTC,Didn't we get like 3000 set pictures and stills already?
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,BuckNekkid18,19,Thu Jul 2 15:11:13 2015 UTC,Not official ones. Those were generally snaps taken by lurkers.
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,icykid298,-1,Thu Jul 2 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"No that was from Suicide Squad lol,but seriously though we should have a teaser for the movie coming out soon...  Lol I was kidding everyone down voted me haha."
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,BuckNekkid18,5,Thu Jul 2 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"I just checked some CBM websites, Deadpool did have a ton of lurkers taking set pictures, and I bet we will get some footage at comic-con and a teaser in August or September."
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,YoureASoldierBodie,9,Thu Jul 2 16:21:47 2015 UTC,Looks like he's got a semi-on
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,BuckNekkid18,12,Thu Jul 2 16:01:20 2015 UTC,Deadbulge
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,the_longest_shadow,6,Thu Jul 2 16:22:26 2015 UTC,Dude's hung like a beer can. =/
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,BuckNekkid18,3,Thu Jul 2 21:57:42 2015 UTC,There's a reason why he's with Blake Lively.
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,Dylancd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:44:07 2015 UTC,Killing is hard work.
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,damn_this_is_hard,11,Fri Jul 3 06:32:34 2015 UTC,God damn I'm pumped for this movie
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,IIIISuperDudeIIII,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"Looks like Deadpool is too, right guys? Right? He's got a chub!"
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,samcowlam,4,Fri Jul 3 21:41:05 2015 UTC,I'm still interested to see how the white eyes are gonna hold up in live action
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,Vaderzer0,7,Thu Jul 2 22:46:04 2015 UTC,I would say this is a shot right after the little trailer they made to get the movie off the ground..?
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,Dig-Up-The-Dead,3,Thu Jul 2 16:03:15 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they re-shot that part for the actual movie.
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,Vaderzer0,6,Thu Jul 2 17:05:12 2015 UTC,Well yeah that's kinda what I'm getting at.  Would be pretty cool
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,ERMAHGERSHREDDERT,3,Thu Jul 2 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"I'll never get tired of seeing this costume, it's just plain perfect, and combined with the enthusiasm and passion Ryan Reynolds has for this movie, I'm really excited for how it's gonna turn out."
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,televisionceo,5,Fri Jul 3 05:54:46 2015 UTC,This costume is so fucking awesome
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,keytothehous,2,Thu Jul 2 16:18:52 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that noticed the bulge right away?
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,Wombat_H,4,Fri Jul 3 01:33:58 2015 UTC,One of the best page to screen adaptations ever.
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,dasut,9,Thu Jul 2 15:47:24 2015 UTC,I respect how early you're calling it.
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,Wombat_H,3,Fri Jul 3 02:56:41 2015 UTC,"I mean of the costume, not the movie."
comicbookmovies,3bvojh,dasut,3,Fri Jul 3 03:00:02 2015 UTC,"So you're saying the movie won't be a good adaptation? Wow, you really like to go out on these limbs.   /s"
