LadyGaga,3dj0bm,markmarius,15,Thu Jul 16 17:39:20 2015 UTC,"Without being too obvious or full of itself, I really think Gypsy succinctly sums up everything about Lady Gaga as a whole. It's a feel good song you can dance to, but is also very community-orientated while still being completely independent. I love it. It's so hopeful (and my opinion is the correct ending song to ArtPop)."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,jedwardclark,11,Thu Jul 16 20:11:32 2015 UTC,"I consider Gypsy to be the finale and Applause to be the encore. Both are such a great way to end the album for different reasons. Since this is a thread about Gypsy I just love how Gaga's attitude toward love is one of being patient (""I don't wanna be alone forever but I can be tonight"") and in the end is rewarded with said love. It takes us through a journey where we as listeners can appreciate the complexities of love and how for the right person it can wait. It's heartwarming to understand that we can't always get the person we love at the time but when they're worth it, you work for it."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,AlfalfaKnight,6,Thu Jul 16 20:25:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't like this song, until I saw her perform it with Kermit during the Muppet's Holiday Spectacular. Her and that frog made me cry that night."

LadyGaga,3dj0bm,Natur3spirit33,3,Wed Jul 22 05:54:36 2015 UTC,"It was one of my favorite songs on the album. I was surprised that it didn't get more attention. I saw a video of her singing it acoustically, and in my opinion it made it even better."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,CatieMay,6,Fri Jul 17 05:19:46 2015 UTC,I think it's the best song she's written since bad romance. it has such a powerful sense of wanderlust and love for the world. the melodic and lyrical content are certainly unparalleled.
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,eternalexodus,3,Thu Jul 16 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"Well let's not forget Born this way, you & I, TEOG"
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,eternalexodus,2,Thu Jul 16 23:27:11 2015 UTC,I didn't. I just think gypsy is better.
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,intrpidbhaviors,4,Sat Jul 18 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"Gypsy is a very beautiful song. I feel like Gaga has done something wonderful by creating a song that describes what we see of her - the world traveler who has become a part of our lives, and that includes people from all over the world. I would have to agree that Gypsy is the finale and Applause the encore; I never realized that before, but I do agree with that statement a lot."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,mime454,2,Thu Jul 16 21:15:55 2015 UTC,It's on my cardio playlist and when I'm alone it's one of the few songs I sing along to. I love it. Favorite song on the album.
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,LadyoftheDam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"It's one of my least favorite songs on the album.  Which doesn't really mean much.  It's clearly a good song, and I like it all right, but it's just not my favorite.  The Edge of Glory was my least favorite on Born This Way.  I really can't tell you why.  But I can definitely see its appeal.  Especially as an energizing song."

LadyGaga,3dj0bm,pezqru,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:47 2015 UTC,"I really do not, as a Gaga fan, understand why people love Gypsy so much. It is one of those songs that mean a lot to her because it is intrinsically about her journey, but its not one of those songs that are necessarily relateable. i also feel like the word gypsy is a super weird descriptor for what she means to say.   ITT: say good things about Gypsy"
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,9070811,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"To me, it feels like a sister song to Marry the Night."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,u1tr4me0w,-7,Thu Jul 16 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"I think it sounds like a Disney song, it's very catchy in that sense but in a way it can come across a little cliche. And honestly, I refuse to listen to the song most times because of the fact that its name is a racial epithet. I just find it ironic that Lady Gaga touts herself as so liberal and open-minded and then named her song after a racial slur......."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,u1tr4me0w,6,Thu Jul 16 20:41:17 2015 UTC,"In America it's really not considered very offensive, especially in the context which she's using it."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,u1tr4me0w,-2,Fri Jul 17 01:01:43 2015 UTC,"It's not offensive in America but it is in Europe and the song is posited as an international ballad, so I would think she would want to be sensitive to international concepts."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,u1tr4me0w,3,Fri Jul 17 15:00:22 2015 UTC,"Or maybe people could get over themselves, and realize that words can't hurt them."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,Vhantaar,0,Fri Jul 17 16:34:12 2015 UTC,"That's easy to say when the words don't apply to you, not that they apply to me, either. I figure it's not my place to decide so I'll stay away from the controversial words, Gaga obviously chose otherwise."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,u1tr4me0w,2,Sat Jul 18 01:42:24 2015 UTC,"I'm gay, people say offensive things about a group that I belong to all the time, but the truth is that it can only hurt me if I let it, and I'm above it; so honestly whatever. And disregarding that conversation, the important thing is intent and she's obviously using the word in the non offensive sense."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,nnuminex,0,Sat Jul 18 02:09:34 2015 UTC,"I know she is, but I figure that we should just distance ourselves from words that have such harrowing histories. If she called a song ""Faggot"" but wrote it about her love of gay people, it would be received will all sorts of mixed reviews from the gay community. I figure if we just don't use those words, we can't be possibly hurting anyone in a group, so in this case I think naming a song ""gypsy"" was a bad choice."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,mistAreads,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:14:40 2015 UTC,How about you let the affected people decide what's offensive to them?

LadyGaga,3dj0bm,u1tr4me0w,5,Fri Jul 17 07:21:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think that's what her intention was
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,Karandr,2,Thu Jul 16 21:47:37 2015 UTC,"Well she was referring to the authentic gypsy, the man without a home who's constantly travelling. The east European gypsies are something else"
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,u1tr4me0w,0,Thu Jul 16 23:25:10 2015 UTC,"The name ""gypsy"" is a misnomer - they are the Roma people. The name ""gypsy"" comes from the mistaken concept that they are E""gyp""tian. This is also where the word ""gyp"" comes from, as in to be given a bad deal. Also, the reason Roma people live like that is because they have been kicked out of every country. They were originally kicked out of India as a lower caste, eventually made it to Europe, where they are still forced to live on the fringes of society. It's like saying the N-word but then saying ""But I'm talking about the black people in the south working on plantations!"" It's not a nice word, and the concept has been romanticized to the point that people forget that it is not a lifestyle that was meant to be happy."
LadyGaga,3dj0bm,Jordanjm,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:02:09 2015 UTC,And how ironic is it that expressing this opinion as a Lady Gaga fan gets you downvoted? Little Monsters position themselves as open minded and progressive but can't even entertain the idea that Gaga may have made a mistake. The amount of futile arguments I've had over Gypsy -- which I love as a song -- is painful. I've given up.

LadyGaga,3d1sy4,camboa,12,Sun Jul 12 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"Shooting all her scenes at once seems to be an indicator to me that her role in the series is going to be minor or limited. When the first promo pics came out I assumed she was going to be a main character.   I've felt though that the AHS series is really losing momentum, especially with the last season. Seems like it's relying on the obscene just for the sake of doing it, rather than it being meaningful to the story. If the ratings are low I have a feeling people will blame her, which would be quite unfair. But she might also be capable of saving it, so who knows.  But dammit- this would have been perfect if both Gaga and Jessica Lange were working side by side. I wish she hadn't left, I think we would've gotten an awesome cover from the both of them."
LadyGaga,3d1sy4,Baziliy,3,Mon Jul 13 00:07:30 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree. I think AHS has been so underwhelming as of late, however, I think if anything, the acting on the show is incredible with Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, and Kathy Bates (and let's not forget Dandy this past year!).""  It seems like people can distinguish between bad acting and bad story-telling.  I get my hopes up every year thinking this season will be better but I can't say I am too excited even with Gaga.  It does sound like she's going to be a small character. Maybe it will be similar to what Stevie Nicks did in Coven."
LadyGaga,3d1sy4,Skylarella,2,Mon Jul 13 06:46:12 2015 UTC,Glee was the same. All the good stuff was crammed in at the beginning and then it just died.
