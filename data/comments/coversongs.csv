coversongs,3e4cg7,niconoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:23:09 2015 UTC,He's on tour right now. I'd highly recommend going to a show if you can.  He's definitely much better in person.

coversongs,3e101k,InternetSam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:23 2015 UTC,Solid advice. I haven't taken any sort of vocal instruction so I appreciate every little thing!
coversongs,3dxqqm,KantusThiss,5,Mon Jul 20 12:07:08 2015 UTC,Great version of an all-time classic by Paul Simon. Love the Jerry Douglas dobro playing on this track.
