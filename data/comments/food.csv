At the risk of sounding like a dumbass, I'll give my uninformed opinion.  A .750ml bottle of Goose around here is $30, or $25 if it's on sale. I think it tastes great, I actually enjoy it. I can drink it straight. Absolutely no hangovers. It's one of my favorite alcohols.  But I consider it to be expensive... I started looking for alternatives. So I found a 2 liter bottle of Svedka for $18 dollars..... I think, ""Shit, I'm getting more than twice as much for only half the price"".  Big mistake. Tastes like absolute shit no matter if its straight or if you mix it. And it gives me killller hangovers. Like ""worst hangover of my life"" type shit after the first night. I now have a revulsion for Svedka, won't drink more than 3 shots worth in a single night. It's taken me 2 and a half months to down half the bottle.  Is Grey Goose ""high end Vodka""? Probably not. ""High End"" should probably be reserved for some $100+ per bottle type shit with a quality that matches its pricetag. But Grey Goose is undoubtedly premium.... Well worth the $25 per bottle, and I'll never go back.  I don't know why people call it over-marketed garbage. I don't recall seeing a single Goose advert outside of a rap song. I drink it cause I enjoy it.   Kirkland and Pinnacle   Genuinely curious. Do we actually have definitive proof that Kirkland, Pinnacle, and Goose are literally bottled from a single identical source? Like, 100% identical from factory to store, no ifs-ands-or-buts? I'd love to get the same drink for a cheaper price.  quick edit: It seems to me like Grey Goose is like the Floyd Mayweather of Vodka. It's one of the best but people just use it as an easy target for attacks.   another quick edit: The comparisons here, the accolades, the user comments, all seem to at least indicate that Pinnacle and Kirkland are NOT the same thing..."

Cut boneless pork chops into cubes, marinated them with McCormick grill mates Montreal Chicken seasoning, just dry rub them and let it sit for about 30mins   Batter - I eyeballed it... 3/4 cup of flour, teaspoon of salt, 1/3 cup of corn starch, 1 cup of water more or less until the consistency I liked (watery pancake batter). Let it sat for about 30 mins along side the pork while I prepped the veggies.   Deep fry em in a small pot until golden, Med-high heat. Batter and toss em in! 3 different batches due to pot size, slight pain in the ass but I couldn't stop eating them right off the fryer!!! Let it sit while moving onto the wok.  Heat (some deep fry) oil in wok, toss the veggies in. Med-high heat. I used onions, celery, and red peppers. Seasoned (eyeballed) with pinch of salt, sugar, msg, and stir fried until onions are golden. Turn off stove, toss in the fried pork and add 1 sauce packet.  Very tasty 8/10 would eat again.   Next morning microwaved 7/10 fuck yeah.  Now what do I do with the deep fry oil..."

Break up/add more colors, add more central height  -2. Cheese too heavy, weighs down greens, mix 66% into the salad and then stack remaining 33% on top  -3. Great color! Move main scallop inch to the left, then move everything as is to the center, leaning a few asparagus up vertically  -4.  Off centered purée is a good call, but slice the roulade so that you can shingle in a tight semi-circle in center, scattering/leaning cauliflower around/against. Pool up the sauce only in the negative space since it's so thin.  -5.  Rookie mistake here-ice cream sandwich should have been freezer packed in dry ice and mailed directly to me. Shame: such potential.  Keep at it, and brush your damn teeth."

Tbsp Sriracha. Tbsp of honey. Tbsp of sugar.     Turn off the heat, finish by adding cilantro and whole basil leaves. Squeeze in a fresh lime or two, mix and plate.

food,3dxqry,corif,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:46 2015 UTC,"Can you explain the cornstarch thing a little further for those who suck at cooking? Like, do i add it in with the sauce? How much water?"
food,3dxqry,ThelVluffin,2,Mon Jul 20 17:34:24 2015 UTC,Cornstarch is commonly used as a thickener for sauces and soups. You can also use flour but flour tends to make things taste grainy if you mess up how much you put in.  With cornstarch if you're thickening a saucepan of liquid like this you'd use about a teaspoon to half a tablespoon of it. Put it in a paper cup or glass. Then add water to it and mix until combined. You want to add enough water that after mixing it looks like and has the consistency of milk. Then just whisk it into the sauce until combined well. After cooking for a few more minutes the sauce will thicken up.  As a warning though. If you don't add enough water and pour it in as a paste you very well might end up with dumplings instead of a thickening agent.
food,3dxqry,Wookiemom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:59:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, glad to explain.  You add chicken to the veggies. You add the mix of sauces. Now sometimes the sauces start scorching, particularly if the heat is high and/or honey is being used - so you add some water. Now the whole dish appears watery. So, you take 1 teaspoon of cornstarch in a cup, add about 1/4th cup water to form a slurry and introduce it to the skillet. Continue cooking and stirring for a few mins and sauce will thicken."

food,3e09sj,bruhleesi,6,Mon Jul 20 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"RECIPE  Adapted from here.  Ingredients:  PIE FILLING   7 cups blueberries 1 cup maple syrup* 3-5 tbsp quick-cook tapioca** 1 tbsp lemon juice 1/4 tsp nutmeg 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp salt 4 pats of butter (like 4 tbsp)   *I have tried reducing the maple syrup to about 3/4 cup and adding 1/4 cup brown sugar instead and it's fab. But I’m from the South and I put brown sugar in EVERYTHING.   **I don’t like my pie fillings to be at all runny, so I err on the side of more tapioca to make it extra firm.  BUTTER PIE CRUST    3 1/2 cups flour 3 sticks butter 1/3 cup ice water (freezing cold water without actual ice in it) 1/4 cup white sugar 1 tbsp white or cider vinegar 1 tsp salt   FINISHING TOUCHES   3-5 tbsp heavy cream Extra white sugar   What to do:  First, make your crust.  Pulse 3 1/2 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor. Add 1 diced stick cold butter, process until combined. Add 2 more diced sticks cold butter. Pulse three times or until the mixture resembles coarse meal.   Add 1 tablespoon white or cider vinegar. Then, gradually pour in 1/3 cup ice water, pulsing about four times until combined.   Turn out onto a clean, floured surface and press into a cohesive dough without overworking (you should see bits of butter).   Wrap in plastic wrap and press into a 1-inch-thick disk. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before rolling out.  Then make your filling.  Simmer 3 cups blueberries with 1/2 cup maple syrup until the mixture reduces by half. About 20 minutes.   Pour into a big mixing bowl bowl. Stir in:    the rest of the blueberries the rest of the maple syrup tapioca lemon juice salt, cinnamon, nutmeg   Cool completely, then pour into pie shell. Dot with 4 pats of butter.  Make it into a pie!  Divide the chilled dough in half. Roll 1 piece into a 12-inch, 1/8-inch-thick circle on a floured surface (refrigerate the other piece).  Roll the dough onto a rolling pin, then unroll it into a 9-inch pie plate, letting it hang over the edge. Add the pie filling.  Roll out the other piece of dough and place over the filling. Press the crust edges together and trim, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Roll up or pinch the overhang to seal.  Make slashes in the top of the crust and chill for 30 minutes (both you and pie). This is where you preheat your oven to 400 degrees.  Place a foil-lined baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Wrap an oiled, wide band of foil around the pie edge to protect the crust from burning.  Bake the pie for 30 minutes. Remove the foil band, brush the crust with heavy cream and sprinkle with sugar.   Bake again until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool before slicing. Cry.  Enjoy!  EDIT: Forgot to say--I am a college student and I have made this same pie without a food processor/blender or rolling pin! In a pinch you can just mix the dough together by hand and roll it out your hands. Might not be as smooth or pretty but will work for people who do not have access to certain tools!"

Look at a whipped,  yet unbroken ganache here.  Either way the texture of the ganache looks very much like it has been broken by water -- I would recommend to the OP that he/she can avoid that by being very careful to not allow any into the chocolate as you are preparing the ganache and if it does end up breaking many times adding a tiny bit more chocolate while stiring it out can make it reform."

I used 2 medium onions, half a jar of olives, several pinches of various spices, and about half a bulb of garlic.  Recipe:   My favorite crust recipe - I can make this in the time it takes my oven to pre-heat (~12mins) I like to pre-bake my crust for about 10 mins, the topping will be thick and wet and it can end up soggy if you don't Boil water and start to cook 12 lasagna sheets. Sautee any toppings you want - in this case 2 medium onions, 3 tbs crushed garlic, 1/2 jar stuffed olives (~15), and any spices to taste (basil, oregano, salt) Add 1 32oz/1liter can crushed tomatoes and simmer Around now you should be removing the crust from the oven, and draining the softened lasagna sheets. Spread a layer of sauce on the crust, then alternate 3 layers of 4 lasagna sheets each. I put the middle layer perpendicular to the others, and spread cheese and sauce in between, with more sauce towards the bottom and more cheese towards the top. Return the pizza to the 450 oven for 10-15 mins, until cheese is golden and crust looks done.   Pics!"

Mom was a feminist and a vegan. Needless to say, my brother and I very rarely had red meat at home, and if we did eat animal protein it was usually eggs and we had to do it in private.   Sometimes dad would slip a couple hard boiled pre-birds in the drawer under the bathroom sink. I could eat the eggs without mom knowing as I was getting ready for school by popping the shells off while taking a shower, or while running the sink, cracking the jacket, chewing the beak-jello, then flushing the evidence. She was always listening though.   She told us all she would leave us if she caught anyone ""feeding on the lives of less fortunate beings,"" and if we argued she would claim chauvinistic oppression. Dad always took her side because he had no balls. It was a lot for a six year old to absorb.

food,3du4tr,VoraciousGhost,19,Mon Jul 20 01:29:11 2015 UTC,"Technically you are correct, but in America 'au jus' is simply that style of gravy, with no regard for its direct translation. Nobody would ever ask for extra jus in English, packets of mix don't say jus gravy, etc."
food,3du4tr,pillzberryDROboy,-8,Sun Jul 19 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"Nobody would ever ask for extra jus in English   Uh… yes, I would. I guess this is a deeply American thing because hearing people say ""with au jus"" sounds very wrong, like they're not a native English speaker. (I know it's French, but still.)"
food,3du4tr,bean327,11,Sun Jul 19 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"I was being a bit hyperbolic when I said nobody, but really that is definitely not a common thing. Walk into any grocery store across the country and you'll see with shelves lined with things like this or this or this. Au jus almost never actually refers to it's own juice, it's just a distinct type of light sauce that is prepared separately from the meat. Most menus will even say in the description served with au jus. It's basically just a loan word at this point, with it's own distinct meaning, unless you are specifically using it in reference to it's original preparation style in a recipe or at a classical restaurant or something. You'd probably come across rather pretentious if you asked for an extra side of jus the majority of the time."

It's a lot like that final scene in Shindler's List; 1 more person.  Just one more.  sigh  What matters is knowing now.  I already waste as little as possible at home, and I accept that there will always be something I'll miss reusing and pitch; no one is perfect.  I've never cared about odd shapes, though.  I'm also enough of a jerk that buying the last at the farmer's market has never been a problem for me.

INGREDIENTS   2 cups (10oz) all-purpose flour 2 tsp baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup (3.5oz) granulated sugar 2 large eggs 1 tsp ground nutmeg 1/2 cup whole milk 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted & cooled 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 2 quarts vegetable oil Confectioners sugar (for topping!)   EQUIPMENT   Candy thermometer Large saucepan/dutch oven   STEPS   Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk sugar, eggs, and nutmeg in another bowl until smooth. Then add milk, butter and vanilla until combined. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture with a wooden spoon until smooth. Heat oil to 350 degree F.  Scoop out small ping-pong ball sized portion of doughnut batter with a spoon and use a second spoon to scrape batter carefully into the hot oil (I used a cookie scoop instead of the 2 spoons method). Cook about 4-5 doughnut holes at a time, it takes about 3-6 mins for them to be done. The outside of each doughnut will be a nice golden color. You can roll them carefully around in the hot oil for an even cook. Remove carefully with metal spoon and place onto a baking sheet lined with lots of paper towels. Sprinkle confectioners sugar over the doughnuts while they are still warm. You can also make your own glaze or whatever :)   When hot/warm they taste like doughnuts. When cooled they taste like mini-cakes. So this is a win/win recipe for me!"

food,3dsd70,B11111,3,Sun Jul 19 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"The reason for stit bought preshredded cheese turning hard and not melting well lies in one of the last ingredients listed on the bag. If you look closely you will find that they put flour or some kind of startch on the shredded cheese. It prevents the cheese from sticking to each other in the bag but it also prevents the cheese from melting well.   I suggest using block cheese any time you need shredded  heese. You know exactly what you really getting when buy blocks of cheese not bagged cheese. It may be a little more effort and add a few minutes to your cook time, but it will be well worth the extra effort."
food,3dsd70,hogthehedge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:50:34 2015 UTC,I've found it's also cheaper to buy blocks and shred as needed. Plus you get a mini work out every time you need cheese (which is all the time).
food,3dsd70,MidgeMuffin,2,Sun Jul 19 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you that shredding your own cheese is the best, the pre-shredded variety works just fine in biscuits. I use it quite frequently when short on time or I'm just feeling too tired. It doesn't taste as freshly ""cheesy"", but it melts just fine into a nice gooey, stringy cheese. Now there are brands that are just crap (walmart and target come to mind), but I generally buy the Publix brand or Sargento, when it's on sale, and have had no problems.   ETA: if you're looking for cheese for pizza or on top of a lasagna, absolutely shred/slice off a block of fresh cheese."

food,3dsd70,Galactic_kitten,32,Sun Jul 19 04:10:11 2015 UTC,I didn't exactly use the proportions required by the recipe. I did it mostly by eye and it ended up being somewhere like 60/40 peanut butter to powder sugar because peanut butter is already a little on the sweet side. I used fondue chips for the chocolate and something that was important for the presentation is to make sure to shake the pans after adding each ingredient to level it out. That's how I needed up getting a flat look and not the weird bulge you see in the image on the recipe's site. Minor differences but it adds up.  Edit: other things that popped into mind: be sure to use regular milk chocolate for fondue (most grocery stores near me on stocked dark chocolate) and it's much easier to handle the melted chocolate and peanut butter mixtures by double-broiling. You'll thank yourself especially during the cleanup time.

food,3dsd70,foreheadb88,2,Sun Jul 19 07:41:02 2015 UTC,the chocolate to PB ratio is a little off.
food,3dsd70,toddhaspants,2,Sun Jul 19 11:04:13 2015 UTC,The true test op is when you peel them off the paper cup do they leave the chocolate on the cup and just peel off.   If you have mastered this then all will praise you.
food,3dsd70,Auspants,2,Sun Jul 19 12:49:41 2015 UTC,I think we need to taste them
food,3dsd70,ItsaLiquortrap,2,Sun Jul 19 13:30:51 2015 UTC,Needs more filling. But I definitely want to learn to make my own.
food,3dsd70,ZombiedWomble,2,Sun Jul 19 13:35:40 2015 UTC,I've made them once too.  Used peanut butter and crumbled graham crackers in the PB - adds texture to the PB.  But thats a tad too much chocolate to PB ratio.  I generally just do PB on the bottom and chocolate on the top.  Then freeze them.  Then they don't melt as fast.  These are a constant request.  http://www.blueeyedbakers.com/home/2012/4/24/crunchy-peanut-butter-cups.html
food,3dsd70,Rin_aonir,2,Sun Jul 19 14:37:20 2015 UTC,"In my professional opinion, too much chocolate, not enough peanut butter. Also, question: was the peanut butter homemade or did you purchase it? If it was purchased peanut butter, what brand did you use? They look pretty yummy :)"

I wouldnt be surprised if the industrial Reese process involves: 1) thin walled hollow chocolate shell 2) peanut filling 3) thin top    Or maybe just 1 & 2 with 3 as a pour.    That could be how they get such a thin wall on their cup."
