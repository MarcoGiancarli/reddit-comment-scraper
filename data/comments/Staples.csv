Idk about your store, but our cpc is STRESSFUL! Lots of customers needing their huge orders done NOW when you're already backed up... 3.

No matter how busy a store is however you will always have asshole, entitled customers as well and now have to bend over backwards for BDP/Contract customers more than ever (MORE account shit on solution builder as well). If offered a decent raise and have other associates who do help to take the burden off (show people to self serve, help retrieve orders, shipcenter, etc.) then you should be okay.

Trust me my friend you do not want this, but this is what my store was forced to do cause of all the ink, frieght, tech work, and Plano grams the piled up cause of the problems you mentioned."
Staples,3e1m3i,Raindawgify,5,Tue Jul 21 07:22:58 2015 UTC,"Every store is in this situation.  I just laugh when my GM starts bitching about PoGs and pull lists not getting done. They know everything can't get done during the day with customer traffic, but they keep scheduling more people during Prime Time, and less at closing. To admit this would mean admitting they did not plan correctly, so instead they get on everyone's case, saying we are not doing our jobs, when in reality, it was they who did not do theirs, planning.  Bottom line, if Staples wants to do Prime Time (and extend the hours for prime time during peak BTS) they need either an early morning team (5-10?) or an overnight crew to come in and knock out tasks.  My GM (and DM) refuse to do this, saying that staffing an off hours crew takes away staff from Prime Time.  So, until I can split myself in 2 to get everything done, I will do what I can and make customers my priority. It is good to reaffirm it is not just me in this situation by reading this type of post though.  I do not mind the work, I can tolerate the bitching. What really used to bring me down was the feeling that it was my fault, and it isn't, nor is it yours.  If Staples wants to use bare minimum scheduling as a way to save money, they need to deal with the consequences."
Staples,3e1m3i,ccap17,3,Tue Jul 21 09:42:53 2015 UTC,"Planogram responsibility does not fall onto the MTS it falls onto the TS.  You should not be forced to have to worry about them.

Staples,3e1m3i,markevens,3,Tue Jul 21 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"Our GM and SM are not afraid at all. They openly tell the DM everything in conference calls and emails. The DM just replies with, ""Stop making excuses"". Literally, that is what is being handed down right now at a district level."
Staples,3e1m3i,Avengedx,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"Then your DM is too scared to pass word up the chain.    This is a perfect example of how horrible communication is in Staples and why the upper management are so disconnected from what affect their policy changes have on the store level.    If upper management never understands how bad some of their decisions have on the operation of the store, they won't know there is anything wrong or try to correct it."

Unless your GM is a hard ass I would just act like prime time doesn't exist. That's what we do. And that's what you have to do to get tasks done. Prime Time is only a thing when we are expecting a visit.   And anyway...you can still do small tasks during PT. A pull list I would consider a small task that can be done during PT. When you shoot the list you are on the floor walking around, no reason you can't assist customers. When you work the list you are generally on the floor walking around, no reason you can't assist customers."

Staples,3e0ae9,Kal-ElofKrypton,10,Mon Jul 20 23:59:41 2015 UTC,"Staples is not a professional environment. They have not treated me like a professional. So when I quit, its going to be a resignation letter effective immediately along with my polos and name tag. If things were different I would absolutely give them the courtesy of two weeks. But I've seen more associates get shafted during their two weeks than not. The last person to give notice was taken off the schedule completely, and it really seemed to amuse the scheduling asm. Two other good associates were scheduled beyond their two weeks, so they went down as no shows even though they gave a clear date. And that's not even getting into the way the corporate shits on the store associates, or that I get paid like absolute crap. So no, they won't be getting my two weeks notice and I'm never going to look back. There are 100 other retail chains that you can go work for and be treated like crap, and some of them might even pay you something worth your time."

Ran into that when I worked at a grocery store; one of the cashiers thought she was the hottest shit ever because her mom worked there forever and then she started working there as soon as she could and was there forever.  ...just to make you guys cry, starting pay for cashiers there was $14, and some of the people who had been there a long time were making $17 or $18.

If you hate everyone and never want to be in a Staples ever again not even to shop then have some fun.  Do a ZB Walk scan all the holes except the aisle with Writing Instruments don't scan any holes in that entire aisle.  Then scan tags with product, especially the pencils, composition books, 1 subject notebooks anything on the BTS shippers that have large quantities and high price items like chairs, shredders, printers, routers over $99.  When you're done the number should be in the double digits and the research near impossible. Fax the front page to your DM then take your shirt and fold it neatly, place it on your GM's desk with the paperwork from the walk and a post-it saying ""Good luck, I can do no more of this bidness"". Or if you wanted to be really cruel you could transfer a crap ton of SKUs to another store with out physically shipping them.  Just create and authorize the transfers in the AS400.  Do BTS stuff if you do high ticket items they'll probably catch it, but the BTS stuff may go unnoticed binders, notebooks, pencils etc, just transfer large quantities to several other stores."

Staples,3e0ae9,StaplesSnitch,4,Wed Jul 22 00:37:50 2015 UTC,They will. I then told them since they are terminating me prior to my two weeks that I would like unemployment. They then suspended me with pay until the final day. Had I known this I would have given four weeks notice.
Staples,3e0ae9,venturer95,2,Tue Jul 21 00:09:14 2015 UTC,"Unless you have the worst management team, doubtful. Normal managers will just schedule you as normal for those weeks. Most stores have the schedule written 2 weeks out anyway."
Staples,3e0ae9,staplesfisticuffs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:36 2015 UTC,"You're getting answers all over the place because each store's pretty different. Even though you've only been there for 3 months, you should have a decent idea of how mature your management team is.  Most stores are pretty desperate for labor to ensure other employees don't go over 25, so unless they're stupidly spiteful to the point where they're going to screw themselves over, they won't do that."
Staples,3e0ae9,toothpick21,2,Tue Jul 21 03:33:34 2015 UTC,I've always though that if someone was really pissed off and wanted to screw a store royally all they have to do is unplug every network cable in the electrical room. Has to be about 50 cables plugged in to all the networking crap. Imagine the headache trying to understand the help desk telling you where to plug them in at.   to take it a step further someone could cut them all AND unplug them. Then you'd have to splice them or run new cables.   And that is why that room is LOCKED.
Staples,3e0ae9,StaplesSnitch,2,Tue Jul 21 04:31:21 2015 UTC,I planned on doing some fun closing announcements. Tell the customers how we really feel when they still haven't checked out after closing.

You could have asked for more or simply not taken the job because the pay wasn't what you wanted.  I get that we all wish we were making more. Hell, I know I do. But don't act like Staples is so terrible because they are paying you so little. You accepted the pay when you took the job. You could have turned down the offer, or accpeted it while you keep looking for something that pays more. Either way....you agreed to the pay."
Staples,3e0ae9,exile0514,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:49 2015 UTC,Except that just about every major retailer/food chain offers the same shitty pay. Finding a well paying job part-time doesn't exist anymore.

Of course I was a Guest Service Team Lead and there were only 2 or 3 managers above me. But they always encouraged us to have fun. Held ""pep rallies"" and stuff. They even gave me my own desk in the mangers offices and encouraged me to put pictures up and stuff. I didn't even need a dang desk.   JC Penny wasn't to bad. I worked on the sales support team, basically checking in .com orders, doing price changes, helping with freight. It was fun but paid crappy. Didn't have to deal with customers.  any retail can be crappy depending on who the mangers are and how they run their store."

Staples,3dzo63,ccap17,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"I used to work in a grocery store. (And will again soon, as I am about to leave Staples) There we had a receiver. His job included checking in vendors that come into the store to stock their products, process damages, manage the receiving area, process returns, make inventory adjustments. Most work is on computer that is located in receiving. You also have a phone to answer as well. There isn't much customer interaction at all. You start your day at either 5am or whenever the store opens, depending on if the store has 3rd shift or not."

Staples,3dzo63,FaxForRA,2,Mon Jul 20 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"I would imagine pretty much all major department stores are like this, but there's an entire crew of people that make up the IS position at Macys/Bloomingdales.  See if your nearest Macys (Or bloomingdales, if you have one near you. They pay better) has an open position for either Merchandising Lead or, if you ever held a Supervisor or SMM position, Merchandising Team Manager (MTM). Basically, they use guns all day, job starts real early in the morning, the smallest amount of customer interaction possible, and it's not a super high stress job so long as you're good and the people around you don't suck. Macys also makes use of RFID tagging, which makes inventory easier and easier the more it gets implemented (You literally wave a gun around and it auto-counts tags within proximity, no scanning required).   Most Macys also have a fulfillment lead position as well, which is basically BOPIS + Shipping duties.   There's also a ""Visual"" team, which is basically planograms and making the store look attractive to customers. Pays well for base level employees, and is a job any IS would kick ass at.   But yeah, lots of opportunity there for someone who's had experience as an IS. And, like I said, if there's a Bloomingdales in your area look there first. They hire at 2-3$ an hour more than Macys will, the training is better, and the people around you will be better. Smaller team, so you'll have more responsibility thrown at you, but it's nothing compared to an IS job lol.  Instead of just checking the website for open jobs (If you're interested), I'd suggest going into the stores and speaking to the HR Manager (Yes, these stores have an HR Manager in each store) to see if they have any positions open that your skills might fit into. They can always open up a position if they find someone who they think would do great."

Staples,3dw3kq,Stahplease,5,Mon Jul 20 00:45:28 2015 UTC,"Document it in writing and present it to your GM as a genuine concern for the operations of the store, not as an attack targeting your ASM. If you do this, I don't see how it would come across as whining, and you'll have a paper trail to show you tried.  That being said, if your GM is what I like to call a ""people pleaser"" towards everyone, then you may just be blowing smoke in their ears.  During our last LP audit, they asked why we weren't using and stickering our EasyTech Boxes during Tech Book-Ins. I said I've told the guys to use them, multiple times, over the past year, to which the LP auditor said to bring it to the attention of our GM immediately if someone continues to forget, and he should take care of it.  Problem is, he didn't even know we were supposed to use them for Book-Ins! Go figure!"
Staples,3dw3kq,kirashi3,4,Mon Jul 20 01:55:05 2015 UTC,"Using and snickering our Easy Tech Boxes? Book-ins? As a Certifed Technican for almost a year, I have no clue as to what your talking about?"
Staples,3dw3kq,bopisalert,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:03:22 2015 UTC,"Edited for spelling mistakes; stickering not snickering.  In Canada, we have EasyTech green pizza boxes with staples logo, website, and quick bullet points of the services we offer. We're supposed to use them to hold things like laptop power adapters, hard drives, USB sticks, DVDs, etc that our clients bring in with their booked in computers.  Wasn't sure if stores outside of Canada did this or not."
Staples,3dw3kq,kirashi3,3,Mon Jul 20 02:26:49 2015 UTC,"No pizza boxes in the US, we do have to fill out asset tags (labels) with the customers name and order number and stick them to the computer and any other accessory that comes in. Also are supposed to record accessories in OMS."

Staples,3dw3kq,Kal-ElofKrypton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:00:51 2015 UTC,"That'd be going against every ounce of passive aggressiveness I have in me. But really, how do I just a lowly OS associate say these things to my direct boss without feeling like I'll have a host of bitterness directed at me for essentially calling her out? That's why I went to my gm first, whom I'm much more comfortable around."
Staples,3dw3kq,DewSchnozzle,3,Mon Jul 20 02:13:14 2015 UTC,"I am with /u/Kal-ElofKrypton on this.  This is a lowly retail job. It is places like this where you work out the little kinks in life.  So you piss someone off for calling them out diplomatically? So what? That reaction is on them, not you. Don't be a doormat. Staples is not life."
Staples,3dw3kq,Kal-ElofKrypton,3,Mon Jul 20 11:33:59 2015 UTC,Do it. You gotta move beyond the hangups you have and be real with people. You're on the same team and your teammate needs to step up. Who cares if the teammate is the quarterback?

Staples,3dw3kq,bopisalert,2,Mon Jul 20 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"If you make something in the cage or a computer that is supposed to be in lock up disappear for a couple hours, that might rattle them enough to get them to be more dilligent with things that are supposed to be locked up.  As for trash, that was always handled by associates at my old store."
Staples,3dw3kq,Tyler11223344,3,Mon Jul 20 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"Well, us associates handle the trash, but our back doors require unlocking by management to take it to the dumpster. Which means the last 3 nights, she's failed to allow/ask anyone to take it out. I'm not necessarily saying she has to be the one doing garbage. It's the lack of even having anyone do it."
Staples,3dw3kq,elentirion,3,Mon Jul 20 01:26:36 2015 UTC,"Alarming the computers is the Certified Easy Tech's job, The BOPIS/.com pickup cage is always unlocked so a manager doesn't have to be called everytime there is a pickup (I believe they lock it at the end of the day) and the trash have you asked to take it out or are you waiting for her to ask?"
Staples,3dw3kq,Tyler11223344,3,Mon Jul 20 02:00:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, I and other associates have offered to take the garbage out and been told ""we'll take care of it tomorrow."" As for the computers, at close at then end of the night when we're a short staffed store, we close with no tech just the MOD who also covers tech the last hour, thus the responsibility falls on her."
Staples,3dw3kq,staplesfisticuffs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:11:16 2015 UTC,The BOPIS cage isn't supposed to be locked 24/7? In my store we always have to call a MOD to get one out
Staples,3dw3kq,rons_moustache,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:48:01 2015 UTC,"It is.  Either their store is running shortcuts or is operating under a different SOP.  At stores in my district, they set the lock to a lower level and have a key available for associates to use under controlled circumstances.  That gets the area around the MOD requirement and was approved by LP and DM both."
Staples,3dw3kq,sAnitySCREAMS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:46 2015 UTC,"Oh okay. I figured having it unlocked might be a bit of a risk, but it would make sense in terms of saving manager time too, so both seemed equally likely"
Staples,3dw3kq,rons_moustache,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:14:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my store we have a locked cabinet, one side for BOPIS and one side for Ship to Store. There's a key for cashiers to use that we keep in a register drawer, and one of the tech keys work for it as well."

I'd rather disarm a potential situation then let something along the lines of that happen. If you can't get anything done with that then you should contact ethicslink.   Also, just a friendly tip Ron. Slow down on the staples kool-aid. You have to sip it, not chug it."

Staples,3dv5lm,FaxForRA,5,Sun Jul 19 21:47:01 2015 UTC,"I think that was the main issue. We were out of black, and almost out of red, blue, and light blue. Tons of orange, baby shit green, and pink left."

Staples,3dwahe,TechMaster212,13,Mon Jul 20 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"Speaking for myself I really dislike the whole ""it's a tech thing"" or ""it's a OS thing"" or ""that's not my side"" BS. IMO that's why so many stores look like crap. My store doesn't have an OS associate. It's just me, the IS. And my job isn't strictly OS. Inventory is all over the store. There are 4 techs in my store. And our paychecks say Staples on them, not payed by Easy Tech or Office Supplies.   Part of being a team is taking care of the whole store when something needs taken care of. Not passing by a problem because it's ""not my side"". ""not my side"" is simply an excuse.   Our GM's do very little to get this through to everyone. Your side is everything within the 4 walls of your store. If you see a problem that you can fix...fix it. If you can't fix it right then, tell someone that can or make a mental note to come back to it.   Same with freight...it kills me when the techs are just cherry picking their own freight. Do you know how fast you can get the truck done if everyone worked everything....?"
Staples,3dwahe,toothpick21,2,Mon Jul 20 02:14:52 2015 UTC,I only said it cause I almost never work load unless I volunteer cause I'm the only tech who can work a pull list and find most of the crap so I get slated for nights before a ZB and Saturday for onsite jobs.

Staples,3dwahe,toothpick21,2,Mon Jul 20 02:18:56 2015 UTC,You can even have a cashier tag them between customers.
Staples,3dwahe,___what___,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:43 2015 UTC,"This. I'm so sick of people giving me things to do when I'm busy and telling me it's because it's not their job; it's just simply my duty and not theirs. Well, maybe if you had more of a team mentality, shit would get done much quicker!"
Staples,3dwahe,toothpick21,5,Mon Jul 20 19:17:00 2015 UTC,"EAS tags are worthless anyway. 99% of the time when someone beeps it's just a ""oh your good"" and waving them on. And then if you do call them back...it's not like you can search them.   The only real deterrent are the alpha boxes. Even still they get taken, but not half as much."
Staples,3dwahe,kirashi3,3,Mon Jul 20 02:01:57 2015 UTC,"Hey now! EAS tags are totally useful! How else do you think we prank long time associates who think they know the store like the back of their hand? :)  Mind you, I accidentally EAS tagged myself one time... Let's not tell that embarrassing story..."
Staples,3dwahe,toothpick21,3,Mon Jul 20 02:15:32 2015 UTC,"We don't even have EAS tags anymore. I'm not sure you can still order them..maybe you can, I don't know.   Our ASM threw them out because he agreed they are worthless. And also a huge time waster. Putting them on ink or flash drives is just a waste of payroll. Finally he threw them out and I agreed."
Staples,3dwahe,kirashi3,3,Mon Jul 20 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"We still use them, and can order them, but they're only a deterrent of course. Anyone beeping out the door gets waved on, and even if they voluntarily come back in, we can't legally search or detain them.  I do love the customers who either have some sane logic or have worked retail before. They come back in with their product and receipt already out of the bag and de-magnetize it themselves after show the cashier proof they paid. It's hilarious because every time I simply cannot resist saying ""You're hired! Come in tomorrow for your first shift!"""
Staples,3dwahe,toothpick21,3,Mon Jul 20 02:23:51 2015 UTC,My store has them and if we don't use them when our managers decide to do an audit then they write everyone up.
Staples,3dwahe,FormerSCIA,3,Mon Jul 20 02:24:07 2015 UTC,is it actually on the MPP audit?   This is fascinating. I'll have to look at an audit when I get a chance.  If EAS tags are on the audit I wonder what we are marking down...pass or fail. Considering we don't have any EAS tags in our store.
Staples,3dwahe,staplesfisticuffs,3,Mon Jul 20 02:29:16 2015 UTC,I believe it is or they assume it under the question are there any things not covered by this audit that are not done or some crap

Staples,3dwahe,SarinaSlytherin,3,Mon Jul 20 22:39:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't worry too much about the unboxed flash drives being stolen. The vendor owns all the shrink on the BTS flash drive displays that don't follow normal MPP guidelines (as in not boxed).  If the vendor isn't worried about them being stolen and is going to credit us for all the shrink, why should we bend over backwards putting EOS tags on them?"

Why should we pay people to read reddit on their phones all day, and post about our paying customers in the most personally embarrassing way ever?  Put down the phone and open your eyes.  Its an office supplies store, not a school supplies store.  The 30%-50% of the stores' skus that are promo status are BTS only - you can tell this by looking at that little 'p' next to the SKU on the tag!!  When you get off your high horse, you'll help customers and see that, no, school supplies aren't office supplies.  The school supplies that Staples sells year round are the same school supplies sold in every drug store in every town in America."

Staples,3dum1r,eternistarr,9,Sun Jul 19 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair if you're only got one day either your availability is shit or management is taking the easy way to get rid of you.  When I was a GM it was very common practice, so much so that HR even joked about it during training.  Costs too much and it isn't easy to fire people, but cut their hours until they give up and leave?  Standard practice.  We'd also do it to people who got brought on with open availability but a month or two after hiring suddenly they were unable to work certain shifts.  Firing is a PITA, cutting hours is easy."
Staples,3dum1r,Mickoneil,5,Sun Jul 19 17:27:08 2015 UTC,I had a manager that would do just this.
Staples,3dum1r,SirRandomheart,4,Sun Jul 19 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"Yup. And it's not just Staples either. I've heard it at almost every retailer I've worked at. ""so and so sucks, we are just going cut their hours until they quit""."
Staples,3dum1r,toothpick21,6,Mon Jul 20 01:19:26 2015 UTC,Doubtful. Happened to other associates as well. It happens every now and then where I get 5 hours or 11 hours and then suddenly back to 24-26 for weeks.  I really do believe what they said about the district manager yelling at them for our store being over on hours.  I don't think it has anything to do with management. Surprisingly the store manager and two MODs are lovely people and we get along well.  I have open availability and have never called out or missed a shift. I always clock in 10 minutes before sched. Never been late either. Perfect attendance since I started and at all my past jobs.
Staples,3dum1r,Mickoneil,4,Sun Jul 19 17:43:27 2015 UTC,Sounds like you're better than they compensate you for.  True it was difficult to find the job but use the time you're not working to do better than Staples.

Staples,3dum1r,staplesfisticuffs,0,Mon Jul 20 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"This isn't true. Some stores just have so many associates, they have to give hours to everyone somehow. Friend of mine is a sales manager at a different store and his best sales person is cut to one shift for this week."
Staples,3dum1r,Mickoneil,0,Mon Jul 20 16:34:51 2015 UTC,"If stores are overstaffed, even subconsciously will almost all schedulers give more hours to those they want to keep vs those they can do without.  Overstaffed stores are about the best example of this, and if good managers want to keep good employees, they'll make the decision to short the bad ones.  Giving 3 good employees equal hours is tough and shorts all of them on hours; its easier to keep the better two and lower the risk of them leaving for more hours."
Staples,3dum1r,staplesfisticuffs,0,Mon Jul 20 17:16:41 2015 UTC,"Right, but not everyone strategically thinks like this. My point is you're saying it's universally either shit availability or management's trying to get rid of you. There are a lot of other reasons."

You're flat out misconstruing my words to make me sound like a bad guy.  Thanks for quoting what I did say though, it does make the straw man easier to see.  I'll admit you're right about one week not being enough context to narrow it to an either or, but I had to assume that its a bigger issue than one week - he or she missed his or her whole monthly personal budget."

The warehouse people just grab a tote and put stuff in it, not caring what other garbage might also be in it. I guess, who can blame them.   But when they pack a laptop on the pallet intentionally to crush it (like laying it flat, and then stacking 2 Lazy Boy chairs on top of it, yes that's happened) or putting a paper towel box on the bottom of the pallet and then stacking case paper, furniture, and heavy grey totes on top of it making the whole pallet unstable (yup that's also happened) then it kind of makes you want to screw them over somehow like they have screwed us (at the store) over so many times."

Not too long before I was canned, I could swear they sent out a bulletin saying to keep the totes clean since it wasn't the job of the warehouse to do it. I remember this because my response to it was pretty much along the lines of, ""I've already been keeping my totes clean, and also cleaning out the mess that the other stores left"".

Staples,3dqwlt,FaxForRA,7,Sat Jul 18 20:19:31 2015 UTC,They may have thought it wouldn't matter and gave your hours to other people.
Staples,3dqwlt,FaxForRA,5,Sat Jul 18 17:24:22 2015 UTC,"Never attribute to malice ....  EDIT: And also seriously, other associates could wait two weeks to divide my hours? Me quitting is already a boon to them... Also my store was hiering seasonal for BTS. Presumably, it was more desirable to add seasonal employees than raise hours temporarily for other employees if staples is still hiering."
Staples,3dqwlt,FaxForRA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"Oh man, it was cooler when you left it at the half quote.  Anyway, I agree it shouldn't have been done (The way you explained it) but you never said what your manager said when you asked about the cut in hours and when you explained to him/her your need for the hours, so all we're doing is guessing.  Oh and it's ""hiring"" not ""hiering""."
Staples,3dqwlt,Synnerrs,2,Sat Jul 18 20:30:30 2015 UTC,"hahah. Gotta love the mystery. I have actually taken alot of reddits comments in stride, and I recognize that ""Staples"" collectively may not be 100% to blame, and that each invidual store has unique management teams. I dont think that absovles staples.  I have not talked to my manager about hour cuts. Management gave me no reason, juts informed me when I walked into a shift I was not scedualed for that I typically was set for.   Thanks for the spelling fix.   I am probably going to borrow money and dip into savings. I will live."
Staples,3dqwlt,killer_chair,5,Sat Jul 18 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"When I quit, I put 2 weeks in, and the next week I had four 8am-10am shifts in a row. Needless to say I didn't waste the gas."
Staples,3dqwlt,dr_xadium,5,Sat Jul 18 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"Just another anecedote ... but still. Maybe staples should internally clarify that cutting hours is retailation , and that quitting with two weeks notice should be encouraged by not retaliating in anyway."
Staples,3dqwlt,chug_norris55,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:07:08 2015 UTC,That's pretty messed up. At our store (and what I thought was a company rule) we do not give less than a four hour shift.
Staples,3dqwlt,FrailRain,5,Sat Jul 18 20:53:12 2015 UTC,I will say I gave two weeks and was treated well. My hours stayed the same and I was not mistreated at all. Difference is we had really good management at my store.
Staples,3dqwlt,staplesfisticuffs,3,Sat Jul 18 21:01:44 2015 UTC,"I gave 2 weeks notice at my old store before moving out of state. Moved back home with the possibility of a better job. Better job fell through and went back to staples. Never lost hours, never heard bad things (at least to my face). It definitely sounds like bad management or they divided your hours amongst the other associates"
Staples,3dqwlt,Meowzipan,-2,Sat Jul 18 17:45:01 2015 UTC,"I understand the ""not burning bridges thing"" , and im glad it worked out for you. Also,  I understand the individual management situations may be different.   Maybe the right question to ask is why do some people think / act as through Staples wants them to take actions, that staples doesn't.  IE. People refusing to matches prices that are valid price matches b/c ""its too good a deal"". Individuals assume they know what ""Staples"" wants.  Also, it possible that this was not some kind of blind loyalty to Staples, but that my management was just especially cruel."
Staples,3dqwlt,Meowzipan,3,Sat Jul 18 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"It's a management thing. I gave my two weeks, got my normal hours, and got a glowing review for my next employer. Don't blame a company for an individual management's decision."
Staples,3dqwlt,Meowzipan,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:21:29 2015 UTC,Should Staples be responisble to some degree for the decisions of its managment? Shouldn't Staples provide training and policy on dealing with events like employees quiting?
Staples,3dqwlt,Mickoneil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"Well sure, but unless people like yourself report them for retaliating, how is the company supposed to know it's happening/enforce policy? Are you even sure there isn't a policy in place? You've even said you haven't bothered saying anything about it. So let's say there is a policy... what good is it if the people who are supposed to follow it aren't called out for failing to follow through on it?"
Staples,3dqwlt,Atramontik,3,Mon Jul 20 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"Can who ever is downvoting me explain why?  Do I not understand two weeks notice? Should I give two weeks notice an expect to not work for two weeks, while simontantouesly making myself available to Staples just in case?  Do you think posts about Staples misbehavoir don't belong in this subreddit?"
Staples,3dqwlt,Atramontik,6,Sat Jul 18 16:29:00 2015 UTC,"I will say it here again. It's not Staples' fault, it's your management. You think this doesn't happen anywhere else in the corporate world?"
Staples,3dqwlt,BubbleWrapLampShade,-4,Sat Jul 18 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"It honestly sounds like an excuse to me.   First, weather it happens anywhere else in the ""corperate world"" is 100% completely irrevelant to if its morally right or wrong.  Don't blame the intangible ""Staples"". The sentiment that ""Staples"" doesn't demand or encourage dont sway me. Staples is responsible for training management and has an HR dept. Managers should look to Staples Policy for advise.  And Utlimately, I think we should hold Staples responsible for the actions of its employees. Not irrationally so. Im not saying throw OTIS in jail for Bidness (He's a giver not a taker).  But that, we should insist on Staples taking every possible action to train, encourage, and treat its employees correctly.   I think people too often use this ""dont blame to company"" sentiment to avoid holding companies responsible for their actions - a lot of times, but not nessasirly in this case , actions they unofficially encourage. Clearly, there will not be alot of ""holding staples responsible"" for what happend to me."
Staples,3dqwlt,staplesfisticuffs,3,Sat Jul 18 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it can me morally wrong, depending on how useful you are. With the amount of hours being dumped into DLP for BTS, you've got to be as useful as a pecker flavored lollipop for them to cut your hours.  HR, whether you believe it or not, is to protect Staples, not you. It sucks, but oh well.  I can't argue with you on the third part, except Staples is a publicly traded company. We are always doing things for the stockholders, not what you think is always ""right.""  I've been in well managed and crappy managed stores. There is a world of difference in both. It will be the case wherever you go in the future. I hope the best of luck in the future. Go forth and conquer..."
Staples,3dqwlt,bossmt_2,2,Sat Jul 18 21:49:55 2015 UTC,"At will employeement. I understand what your saying about keeping useful employees on. However, presumably, they were gunna give those hours - as they have consistantly for 5 years, until I put in two weeks. I dont think this is related to a sudden change in my usefulness.  You could say they were worried about an employee who quit giving no fucks and causing problems when there is not threat of job on the line, but that kind of invalidates the whole ethic of two weeks notice... They need it to order there life before I go. Presumably to them, I dont ? If they dont need it, lets play no games. Announce it to use as new hires. Quit whenever you want, we will lay you off with out notice. Lets be fair. I should just make myself available to them for two weeks instead of starting a new job?  I think your views on protecting staples / the stock holders is short sided. Protecting Staples could include fair labour practices that keep a team of motivate employees who dont bitch on reddit or create negative images of the company which could impact sales. Admittedly, these are not top priority for any company that I know of.  I think you are far too accepting of ill in the world. Just kind of, its here so live happily with it. ""Bidness as Usual"". I think that kind of mentality prevents any kind of organized resistance or postive change on these issues.  I also understand the realism of your comment. Nobody really gives a shit about staples misusing my two weeks notice. This wont be the last time I, or any other worker is mistreated. But, I think we can start by not accepting it as ""bidness as usual"" and ""not staples fault""  EDIT: And I see you were seriously not kidding about ""say it again"" in your original comment. You are a big peddler of the absolve ""Staples"" of any bad actions of its management.  Seriously man. We need a throat to choke. We have to remain rational in realizing ""Staples"" didn't do EVERYTHING its managers did, but hiding behind the ""no one is staples"" defense just doesn't cut it. Staples needs to activley ensure it has good management, training and fair labour practices in play. Accept it all is just so unempowering and so convient for ""Staples"" and bad for us."
Staples,3dqwlt,Raindawgify,-4,Sat Jul 18 22:08:51 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to absolve anyone. If you are upset, the front door is there for you, has always been, and will be there for anyone else in the future."
Staples,3dqwlt,toothpick21,3,Sun Jul 19 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, I wasn't trying to personally attack you.   I think that attitude about 'front door is open' doesn't reflect economic asymetery between a retail worker and an employer, which is why we do not have laize faire capitalism. Not to say that this two weeks must be regulated, only the quit anytime thing is just fundamentally ignorant of the realities of working retail.   Also, why would you tell somebody who already quit ""The door is there for you"" , it just seems a little to late. If I dont like the way my employer treated me as I quit , I can quit???"
Staples,3dqwlt,ienom,5,Sun Jul 19 01:37:47 2015 UTC,"Seriously the people on this subreddit seem like a bunch of dyed in the wool sycophants.  They're loyal to a job in which they feel appreciated about how many dozens of pennies above minimum wage they're paid.  I've got friends who have stayed with the company >10 years and are pretty much jaded away from having any future outside of mid-box retail.  Look how much this stupid fucking ""bidness"" joke has been recycled.  Its like idiots in a pro wrestling audience cheering when a good guy says how great local sports team is."
Staples,3dqwlt,Bill_Money,2,Sat Jul 18 17:19:25 2015 UTC,I gave two weeks notice because I wasn't a prick and didn't want to fuck up the rest of my co-workers by just missing shifts.
Staples,3dqwlt,aforsberg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:50:52 2015 UTC,"Well.  To me, the whole ""two weeks notice"" thing is supposed to be proffessionalism between people doing business. There is supposed to be a symetery and partnership, an equility to the gesture.   If Staples doesn't want to partake in the ""two weeks notice"", which they haven't said, the should make it clear.  I think they should train middle management not to retailiate against workers in any circumstance and let HR take care of problems.   I don't think you are a 'prick' if you refuse to honor an informal argreement Staples wont honor. Then again, Staples hasn't really said they wont and situation varies.  What troubles me the most is about your sentiment, is not that you wanted to honor the informal agreement, but that you talk about doing things for your coworkers.  Alot of people here seem to justify there suffering as ""for their coworkers"".  Management always seems to suck in these comments, but ""coworkers"" are awesome. Your coworkers might be suffering, but you shouldnt suffer with them to to marginally ease there suffering for Staples benefit. If you woudn't have done something, don't do it for your coworkers. Let Staples see the consequences of its actions in turn over and customer complaints. You are subsidzing Staples by collecting your pay in ""thank you's"" from coworkers.   Granted this no longer applys to you so specifically, but other people, and you, don't subsidize your employers by working for your coworkers feelings.  Seriously man. I'd understand. I wont make show up b/c ""Copy Center has call holding"""
Staples,3dqwlt,aforsberg,3,Sat Jul 18 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"I liked my store. My manager, unlike yours, did not change the schedule after I told him I was leaving. Yours simply was a prick."
Staples,3dqwlt,trombonetom13,2,Sun Jul 19 01:22:52 2015 UTC,"I can absolutely respect that. And I understand store management varies. Actually, one of the things that made the biggest impression on me working at a large corperation was the hetrogenity of it. I expected all interactions to be strongly scripted along a policy to ensure unformity ... in EVERYTHING.   It feels like every taco bell is exactly the same. I see know the is a lot of variability under the surface of companies like Staples. And there variablity can be amazing, and it can be terrible."
Staples,3dqwlt,staplesmanager,2,Sun Jul 19 01:41:02 2015 UTC,"I never thought about it that way, that I'm making myself suffer to marginally ease the suffering of my co-workers for Staples' benefit, but damn, I think that's what I'm doing. My entire mindset lately is how much I want to move on, but I hate to leave my co-workers in the lurch. In my store we have a couple of workers that are WAY ""above and beyond"" and I'm usually the same way...we're kind of the unofficial team that runs the place while we have these huge holes in management at our store, and we really, really count on each other. The other member of our team was in a position that was eliminated at our store, and we're still suffering from her leaving the company. And this was, what, 9 months ago? And we still feel the ripples of not having her. Myself and the others in my ""team"" are the same (not tooting my own horn here - you don't even necessarily have to be a rock star to be one of the best workers in my store...full of fucking idiots) and if any of us left...my store is barely held together with rubber bands and tape as it is, anything to tip the scales is gonna be pretty fucking drastic.  I've been hanging on for the sake of my team. But while they benefit from having me as a teammate, Staples has taken an even greater benefit because, well gee whiz, let's not rush to fill these management and keyholder positions because they're doing all right without 'em!  So we're basically fucking ourselves by working harder and being loyal to one another.  Shit.  You've really opened my eyes with that one. Thanks."
Staples,3dqwlt,Basic85,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:22:56 2015 UTC,"So the compromise would be to give two weeks' notice like a reasonable, responsible adult. If they then retaliate like this, mention it to them, possibly consult with HR.. and if that doesn't fix, then go to the phase of quitting sooner. Don't immediately jump to the part of dumping on other people."
Staples,3dqwlt,staplesfisticuffs,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:06 2015 UTC,"I understand what your saying seriously. But I have to say.. One of the things that helped me culp most with Staples actions over they last few years has been laughing at that ""bidness"" joke.   Maybe its opimum for the staples masses. Maybe it stops us from addressing the workplace problems. We rationalize misbehavior as ineviteable ""bidness"". But, Damn it feels good."
Staples,3dqwlt,Dumb_Nuts,2,Sat Jul 18 19:10:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote you personally, but I'm assuming most people are because you're attributing your experience at your store to all of Staples.   If instead of ""PSA don't give notice"" type of post that implies this happens all the time and tells people who may be at good stores not to do it, if you said ""Gave 2 weeks, GM cuts hours, what a jerk"" it would have been different ton of post and therefor a different post.   In the end it's some combination of your management team being a jerk and probably you not being indispensable. I gave my 2 days and got every day. They rearranged my schedule to get in one more day. Granted I am full time, so I have more built in protections, but it doesn't change what happened with me. And what I've seen happen with other associates. I can't think of a single time at my store someone has had their hours cut because of them quitting.   My other guess is you were negatively affected by BTS. Many stores had to cut a lot of hours as part of the pre-BTS pullback. I'm guessing you fell prey to that.   In all honesty you had something shitty happen, you should be upset. But your post's overall tone is one of Staples being the bad guy, when in reality it's your management team. And I'm assuming any downvotes you receive, that's a big reason why."

You always want to be first or last on return days, that way there's either no returns on the truck or enough room for the driver to have the returns on one side of the truck and your product on the other, last is always best because usually there's extra spaces so you can add extra pallets you didn't request space for.

Staples,3dqt1b,Bill_Money,2,Sat Jul 18 22:49:57 2015 UTC,"While this is not only Staples policy, but also required by the software EULA, how many of our customers are smart enough to have kept the discs?  Unfortunately it's either violate policy and find a disc elsewhere or tell the customer no and not make any money plus piss them off.  We use my MSDN RTM disc images all the time at my store, but only ever with a valid product key from the machine or COA. Your COA is too worn to read the key but it still clearly says Windows 7? Too bad. Should have taken a picture."

I was going to do the price match even though I was suspicious, but ended up just calling my manager to make sure.   Apparently, Lowes is clearancing out a whole bunch of cleaning supplies and we got an email saying not to honor it earlier that morning. The lady threw a fit and said she drove 45 miles to get to our store for the price match..."

Staples,3dpf2x,katyrzana,2,Sat Jul 18 05:13:40 2015 UTC,"It'd just be nice if they put tape PERPENDICULAR to the the tape across the top, so that when they overloaded the box and then taped it shut with one shitty crooked line of tape and then threw it in a heaping pile, it didn't explode. Oh god there's so many levels of wtf with them. Tape guns are elusive mystery machines they can't work. Box taping is too advanced. Sorting toner/ink is beyond comprehension and can't be done. Stacking is impossible. Not hiding heaps of ink behind pallets for me to find so they don't have to sort them. Generally giving a shit. I fucking give up, I swear…"

Manager forced him to actually finish one of the ink recycling boxes for once, instead of just piling cartridges on the floor around it, like a black plastic pyramid. He apparent never used a tape gun before, and would pull off an arm's length strip, that would then stick to his chest and get tangled to hell. After entertaining myself watching him peel that off his fool self, I kindly showed him how to use the tape gun properly on another box, and he tried to emulate... Tried... Managed to ball-tap himself when the tape gun ran out of tape on him. I even ran to the back for a new roll for him, and when I get back up front, he's sealing the box WITH TECH RECYCLING STICKERS!!!  I've never laughed so hard at someone else's expense.

I'm not even joking or exaggerating when I say this: We had huge color printed/laminated directions and pictures posted on the wall showing exactly how to stack them so they would be stable and safe (and the signs strongly encouraged asking for help if for some reason they needed more clarification).   Despite the signs, I was always having to fix it so that it could be sent out on the returns trucks without issue (I was the Inventory Specialist, so of course that fell to me).  I constantly asked my CSM and GM to coach the Cashiers on it since it was one of their closing duties (at least at my store, anyway) and correcting their mistakes and/or laziness took time away from my own work, but that never happened of course.  Sorry for the rant, lol, it was one of those things that really bugged me."
Staples,3dpf2x,Hylian_Heroine,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:41:29 2015 UTC,"First they would have to attempt to stack the ink boxes.

Staples,3dncpu,venturer95,2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"I find it very hard to believe an easy tech associate would start at $.09 over minimum wage with a $.01 credit for experience.  That's not eve how the staples pay scale works.  Oops, just saw it said $.9.... I'm guessing that means $.90, which would make more sense.  Just for a breakdown:  Level 1:  sales associate Level 2: inventory associate and CPC associate Level 3:  easy tech associate/certified technician Level 5:  mobility and tech sales specialist, CPC expert, team supervisor  So yes, to the person who said something before, the inventory associate would be paid less than an easy tech associate.  That doesn't mean you can't ask for a raise to go to the position - I would, but I would not be surprised if one was not given.    Also, moving to IS would mean your max pay rate is lower, so you may eventually cap.    If you prefer task oriented work to sales, however, it may be a good switch.  Minimum wage in my state/city is $7.35.  My store was able to start level 1 associates at $8.65/hr with experience, that is $1.30 over min.  I could hire level 2s at $9.00, and level 3s at $9.60 though occasionally got away with $10.  If you feel you are underpaid for your efforts I would recommend building a case for a raise - what do you do or provide that is beyond the scope of your current job description?  How do you rank in sales efforts vs the store, vs the district?"

Staples,3dncpu,somewhatobnoxious,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:04:51 2015 UTC,I think that was me... Last year that was an excel spreadsheet posted that would tell you the pay scales for each level and even what positions your store can accommodate. But it doesn't seem to be that way this year. I know the pay scales were on the FY2014 Wage Change Summary Report (sent to managers along with raises from the reviews). But that's only accessible to managers. Anyway it'll vary from store to store sometimes (it's called marketing region & salary plan I believe).

As other's have said,  they do not want the stores they have now, why would they want more?    The merger is also why they are trying to push out so many people out through bad evals, PiPS and plain hostility. They are going to have a shit ton of people to layoff when the merger happens, so they want to shed as many people as possible now without having to pay severance or unemployment costs.

Stales presence in Texas has been dismal from my understanding with entire districts closing from poor sales. If that's the case and your store does well I would imagine your store would stay open. As far as labor models my guess is that there would be a few months to a year observing how the OD la or model works and comparing Customer Satisfaction, productivity and profitability between the 2 models. (Un)Fortunately profitability being key. I would imagine you'd be fine for a minimum of 3 months after the purchase is approved, but like I said it's too soon to tell.

Staples,3djnkh,kirashi3,5,Fri Jul 17 20:55:35 2015 UTC,Its 30 days but only if they have active virus software when it leaves the store.
Staples,3djnkh,eternistarr,4,Thu Jul 16 21:09:03 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely a guarantee on service, but it does NOT apply to virus removal if they refuse to put an anti-virus on."

Staples,3djnkh,cherlin,3,Fri Jul 17 01:23:11 2015 UTC,This. Basically the customer is entitled to a rework if we did the vr poorly and left viruses on the machine. They are not entitled to as many virus removals as they can fit in 30 days simply because they are fools.

Staples,3djnkh,Mickoneil,2,Fri Jul 17 06:12:29 2015 UTC,"That 30 day period is for situations where, say, you install a new hard drive and the new HDD happens to be faulty. Something the customer had no control over.   Back in the days of returnable diags toward tech services, we'd handle these customers by telling them they can pay the difference toward Peace of Mind and we'll do the virus removal again, plus they'll get the POM benefits. We always made sure to be very, very clear when working with customers opting for ""just the virus removal"" that if they come back in so much as an hour with viruses on their machine that we can see were newly installed, we're not touching it without being paid.   Works a little bit differently now with diag/repair and nonrefundable diags and whatnot."
Staples,3djnkh,Doominated,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:24:04 2015 UTC,"It works kind of like double jeopardy in that case.

Staples,3djilo,xFAFF,3,Thu Jul 16 20:03:39 2015 UTC,Strictly 25 and NO more. During BTS you can get a little more. I believe 30.
Staples,3djilo,GoodFoBidness,2,Thu Jul 16 20:09:58 2015 UTC,So is it a rare occasion to get 25 hours or are you pretty much always guaranteed to get 25?
Staples,3djilo,dissqrl,2,Thu Jul 16 20:15:11 2015 UTC,Depends on the store.  In the year I've worked there with a 100% open availability and being very vocal about maximum hours being very important to me - I've gotten max hours maybe 30% of the time.  If you want regular hours tell them you work two jobs and make up whatever schedule you want. Everyone that works 1 job gets fucked.
Staples,3djilo,venturer95,2,Thu Jul 16 21:43:22 2015 UTC,"Generally, the more departments you're willing to cross-train in, the more hours you'll get.  I'm both EasyTech and Copy & Print and average 21 hours per week, occasionally covering Office Supplies or Furniture."
Staples,3djilo,Scofflaw60,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:50:28 2015 UTC,"Generally stores will schedule associates around 23 hours at a maximum, that way it can accommodate anytime someone needs to stay late.   It's not that we don't want you to work as many hours as you'd like, but per federal law Full Time is defined as 30 hours per week, so Staples has a policy stating part timers work 25 hours a week max, and lift that on very few occasions to allow them to average out below 30."
Staples,3djilo,venturer95,2,Fri Jul 17 04:24:57 2015 UTC,.....The words of a company mouthpiece...
Staples,3djilo,mgibilterra,2,Fri Jul 17 22:52:56 2015 UTC,"It's also true. I understood the policy when I was part time, so can everyone else.   Yeah, it'd be great if everyone could work 37.5 hours a week every week. I would love to support my associates by letting them get that income. But I can't give them that option. It's the hand we're dealt. And at the end of the day, there is a very solid reason for it."

If your numbers suck you will have your job threatened daily. You will get called to work the register then yelled at that someone is in printers or laptops. Every pc or printer sale you will be asked if you got squaretrade. They will call you to the front for computer intake all the while asking who is covering electronics. Morons will ask for the $179.00 laptop and ask if it will do everything but say they know nothing about them and are you going to show them how to use it. Idiots will call you on the phone asking you how to fix their computers or how to replace their ink cartridges in their printers. Every third mental midget that comes in will look at your ugly ass black shirt with the green collar and name tag and ask if you work there. If your at a tier 4 store shoplifters will steal you blind because they know there is not enough employees in the store to watch for them. At night you will go home and swear you are going to get another job, then you'll go back the next day."

During back-to-school you'll spend all your time telling people where the plastic 2 pocket folders are and composition notebooks among a myriad of other office supply items.

Staples,3djilo,venturer95,2,Fri Jul 17 02:04:41 2015 UTC,Working as a tech associate is like warm apple pie......
Staples,3djilo,Scofflaw60,2,Fri Jul 17 02:23:06 2015 UTC,"You'll be primarily on the sales floor assisting customers, selling electronics and will be responsible for suggesting products to accompany them (we call it attachments) including SquareTrade warranties, EasyTech service plans, paper and ink with printers, software and accessories with PCs, and so on along those lines.   Roughly 95% of your time will be on the floor assisting or at least available to customers, whereas the other tiny bit is either hooking up customers' PCs to the Matrix (our network for computer diagnostics/repair performed remotely by technicians in our Kentucky office). You will also be responsible for stocking the technology area of the store and making sure that area is kept tidy, presented properly and compliant with corporate's floorplan/layout (called planograms).  Any other tasks will be solely based on what your store management will delegate to you, and I would hope they'll be up front about what their expectations are. You will always be expected to assist other departments as best you can. As I used to say, ""My paycheck doesn't say Staples Copy & Print, it says Staples, so I'm here to help the rest of the store too."" When I was CP associate i would help out elsewhere often, cover cashier shifts, work the floor when CP was slow on mornings (called it merch mondays, lol), pretty much everything. If you make yourself valuable as such your management will really appreciate it and you'll find yourself in line for a good review. Stick with it and there is room for advancement too, if that's what you're interested in.  You'll find a lot of pessimism or optimism on here. I suggest if you're offered the job, take it. Talk to your store management about any concerns you may have. If you don't think the position will work after a while, you can always work a different department. Starting in tech will secure you a slightly better starting wage than cashier/office supplies, so there's that."

Staples,3djilo,Rodem,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:00:47 2015 UTC,I think pay in NJ is stable for most stores but depending on the tier the store is will determine your max hours. Im in cpc in a jersey store and the part timers get between 20 and 25 average with one or two going over but not often. Im in a tier 3 store so we may not have the hours to give but it depends on how the management divides them based on how many people to the department

Staples,3dfato,GoodFoBidness,5,Wed Jul 15 21:07:27 2015 UTC,I'd ask what he/she needed it for. But with it being July it's most likely for reviews. You have to sign off on them so the uppers know the GM gave them to everyone. Even if that's the case you're leaving so I don't think they would really care if your GM gave you a review. Still shady

Higher end product and fewer ghetto customers. The company is not publicly traded so every decision is not done simply to please stock holders. One of the best things that has happened since I've worked there is the company saw that the CEO was doing a poor job and actually kicked him to the curb. My tech knowledge has made me irreplaceable in my store as I am now the go to guy for anything computer related.

Somehow, I wound up volunteering for our Cisco VoiP phone upgrade. 4 AM start, all I had to do was basically be in the building to let the contractor install shit. I started talking to him because, well, fuck awkward silence. He told me to go on Dice.com and post my resume.  About 2 weeks later I had interviews for 2 tech jobs. Nailed both interviews, had the option of a 35K salaried help desk job around the corner from my house or a 37K hourly field service job going all around New Jersey with Macys/Bloomingdales.  Took the field service job, never been happier. The technology situation, at least in my region, is phenomenal. I was given a Surface Pro 3 day one at my job. Sales/Store managers have Surface Pro 2's. We use iPods/iPads as registers. Our POS registers have 8 gigs of RAM. We DON'T just throw things at walls and hope they stick; We've got projects that've been going on for over a year and a half that have been nothing but problems that we have teams working every day toward getting to work.

Staples,3deder,SuperGenericMoniker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:25:00 2015 UTC,"Lol, I went from Staples to Office Depot. It's the same, but different. At OD we have specific locations for all stock, and all of the stock management is performed through an iPod touch wrapped in case with a scanner on it. From that i can see a picture of the item, where it is located in tops, and what stores in my area have it, as well as the numbers and hours of those stores. Even better I can order items for customers from it, and check them out on the floor.  Management at least in my store is much better, and less evil than it was at staples. I also get a 5% commission for tech services and protection plans. Hours for part timers can range from 20-30 hours a week, and management is much less strict about you going over the 30 hour limit.

However the only reason I have a holster and why it is only practical for me is because as the IS, I carry an RF gun with me all 8 hours. I don't see holsters being worth it for everyone elsenwho is sharing a gun though."
Staples,3dd4ec,iais,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:36 2015 UTC,"You can't order new straps but you can order a holster for it in the AS400, however it's $15 and a GM may not think it's worth ordering."
Staples,3dd4ec,FaxForRA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:39:17 2015 UTC,They seem very worth it to me and I don't handle it as often. I think they're essential for an IA who has it with them 8 hours a day 5 days a week.
Staples,3dd4ec,FormerSCIA,2,Thu Jul 16 10:38:31 2015 UTC,As an IS I use the holster but I only ordered one for me and I keep it in my locker.  People loose stuff in my store.

Staples,3dcjsr,TechThrowAway20,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:56:52 2015 UTC,"I worked at Publix in the grocery department. Now I'm an MTS at Staples.  Anyway, they both have their ups and downs.  At Staples in the tech department you're going to be under a lot of pressure to meet sales figures, keep customers happy and do tasking (set up displays, do load, ect:)  At Publix it was extremely fast paced, the shifts went by so fast I didn't feel like I had worked.  But it was all load load load load load.    Basically there are ups and downs to both, your experience is going to be mostly dependent on your co-workers and managers. In my personal experience, I will say that Staples offers more opportunities to move up, but then again it's more obvious to management when you prove yourself in sales than when you prove you can throw load really fast."

It was stressful as fuck there, but it came down to having a really intense, demanding direct supervisor in my department.  It's so hard to say with questions like this because it's really impacted by coworkers and bosses. Customers are more influenced based off your store ecosystem; the district I'm in gets different customer bases at basically every store.  But most of Staples right now is pretty understaffed. However, because of how tight scheduling is, you probably can't get called that often to be asked to cover."

Staples,3dbn3m,TheSerialVapist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:18:27 2015 UTC,As of June the apple accessories are to have 5x3 tags from sign solutions on them. The fact cards were to be discarded.

Staples,3dbkjz,playnotwork,2,Wed Jul 15 00:27:05 2015 UTC,IS is the same as IA they just renamed the position.
Staples,3daxco,easytech109,8,Tue Jul 14 21:24:56 2015 UTC,"Zero Balance walk is the scan you do for In Stock For The Customer aka IS4TC.  It's a scan the IS does 3 times a week Mon, Wed and Fri before 10am.  The days and due time can change depending on your district but the company standard is what I listed.  If it's not done by 10am it's fine it just has to be done before 5pm or it will auto generate the report.  What you do is scan all the holes on the floor and fill the ones that show quantities.  If they can't be found then you make adjustments.  You also have to make sure all the actual outs have out of stock tags.  The goal of the scan is to give a snapshot of what the store looks like before most customers come in to shop.  Our customers primarily shop between 11-3 hence ""Prime-time"" so the scan before 10am shows if your floor was ready for business.  That's why scanning well into prime-time defeats the purpose but if you have to scan then scan. What you should do is go onto the Hub and type IS4TC in the search and you'll get a really detailed how-to that you can print and use as a guide. It has everything you need to know about the ZB walk.  If you need to you can PM me with other questions."
Staples,3daxco,FaxForRA,3,Tue Jul 14 22:51:42 2015 UTC,k how about cycle count
Staples,3daxco,FaxForRA,3,Wed Jul 15 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"Cycle Counts are daily inventories that are typically done on Easy-tech products and stamps.  Every month the CC calender comes out and each week you'll see what needs to be scanned and on what day.  It's always Mon-Fri, during BTS it's Tue-Fri. The scans have to be done during the week they are scheduled but not always on the day they're scheduled.  When you scan you will scan every item in that category for example: If you're counting laptops you have to scan all the demos, damages, BOPIS and in-transit.  Online ship-to-store don't get scanned because they're not in your inventory.  If after a scan and adjustments you have an item that has a variance of +/- $100 you have to print it's history and keep it with the final report.  On the Hub you'll find a how-to for this as well."
Staples,3daxco,BubbleWrapLampShade,3,Wed Jul 15 01:09:27 2015 UTC,"That was a great reply, thanks for explaining that. I often help our IA do her cycle counts and I ask how I can make her ZB better (smaller? I don't know what that number means) but she doesn't have a very firm grasp on the job yet, herself, so having an understanding of why and how it's done is really helpful, thanks."
Staples,3daxco,FaxForRA,5,Wed Jul 15 00:25:42 2015 UTC,My pleasure. I got great help when I first started as an IS a few years ago so I never pass on a chance to answer questions about the position.

Staples,3daxco,Meowzipan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"New way is to scan 3 nonconsecutive days. It doesn't have to be Mon, Wed, Fri anymore. I guess it's for reporting reasons because It's just a way to get around days you think might be bad.  To expand on this, you also have to aim for a .8 for your score. This means that your nightly associates and IS are doing their jobs correctly, maintaining stock and helping to drive conversion and DPT by having our shelves filled. There are a lot of factors that can change this score, like planograms, returns, clearance, etc."
Staples,3daxco,FaxForRA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"Technically it's still Mon, Wed, Fri that's why after 5pm on those days the report prints if you don't do a scan.  That let's you know that as a company it's expected on those days. They did make some changes but I don't believe they're permanent, they were done to drop the numbers that, at the time, where all over the place."
Staples,3daxco,toothpick21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:09:01 2015 UTC,Can't expand on what FaxForRA said (BTW..that is an awesome name).   But here's a question while we are talking about the ZB....  We sometimes have chairs (1 on hand) and greeting cards show up on the Outs Not Scanned section. Do ya'll go back in key in these sku's before you complete the ZB?   Sometimes I'll have 10 greeting card sku's. That's 10 items I would have scanned if they had tags on them. But we don't tag greeting cards. So I manually key the skus in off the previous ZB before I complete it. I think this gives me a more accurate ZB number.   Before BTS hit us I would have only 15-25 Outs Not Scanned.
Staples,3daxco,FaxForRA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:43:34 2015 UTC,"For the greeting cards hand keying them is fine, we don't sell that much at my store so I let it ride.  As for the chairs, the guideline is you scan or place out of stock tags on displays that have inventory accessible to the customer.  So you don't have to scan Chairs, Bookcases, Laptops, Tablets etc., and you shouldn't put out-of-stock tags on them, but you should scan and tag Shredders and Printers.  The reason for this is the company wants to know what the customer sees when they come into the store are they looking at a lot of empty shelves and hooks?  The RF gun during a scan is the eyes of a customer catching every empty space.  Laptops always looks full because they can't see the stock.  That being said I put out of stock tags on everything except the Laptops/Desktops and Tablets getting those outs help lower that number.  Your outs not scanned is great at 15-25 you probably average 20 which I think is good, you'll plus some up others will be displays and some just items in the wrong place.  That's how my old store was but this new store is a nightmare if I go a week with someone else doing the scan I came back and they'll be 80 outs not scanned LOL.  I stopped getting mad, now I just have the managers get all my RTW/RTV and sort my totes while I fix it."
Staples,3daxco,toothpick21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:13:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. When I do the outs not scanned if I see a laptop/desktop or a tablet on it I will put the out of stock tag on it so I scan it next time. Mondays my number will be in the .70's by friday I can have it down to the low .50's. I've never had it below that because there is no recovery at night and I always have plus ins on the outs not scanned.   When I go on vaca and come back we are in the 1.5-2.0 range. I saw a report one of the mgrs shot while I was gone and it was something like 114 outs not scanned. But that's nothing compared to the IS before me. I don't think he ever worked the report. When I took over we were consistently in the 4.0-6.0 range. Took about 3 weeks to get it under control.
Staples,3daxco,stonegardener,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:36:54 2015 UTC,"now I just have the managers get all my RTW/RTV and sort my totes while I fix it. Ok, let the op know how that happens in real life.

Staples,3daxco,FaxForRA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:11:04 2015 UTC,"Lol, no sarcasm, I'm serious.  If I'm on vacation for a week and they have someone do the ZB Walk with no adjustments to the Outs Not Scanned, I'm not coming back to fix that on top of my other work.  My GM is the first to print the RTW/RTVs and go hunt them down, once the Walk is researched and the numbers are all back to normal (Usually takes 3 scans, so a week) I go back to doing RTW/RTV.  Besides RTW/RTV isn't most of my job, I still do the Cycle Counts, damages, BOPIS, PO receiving etc.  I'm in a Tier 2 store so maybe in the Tier 4 stores the IS doesn't get help but usually in the upper tiers you get help."

I mean, we're more expensive than Best Buy. If we were just allowed to lower our tech service prices to cheaper than Best Buy, we would make a ton more tech $ even with the lower prices, due to people actually bringing devices here.    Edit: Now I'm curious, and I kinda want to work at a different store's Tech Department for a week, cause based on a lot of the stuff in this subreddit, our store's isn't really doing the same as other places"
Staples,3d6utk,Tyler11223344,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"Staples doesn't do that well in tech repairs because: 1. people don't think ""Staples"" when they need they're computer fixed. 2. We don't advertise our EasyTech business outside of the store. 3. People aren't buying computers like they used to. A lot of people just use their phones and tablets. 4. We live in a ""throw-a-way"" society when it comes to technology. Especially since everyone loves to buy crappy computers. How often does someone want to buy a $500+ computer from us? Hardly ever. They would rather throw it away and buy a new one. 5. People are learning how to use google and youtube at an alarming rate. lol. 6. How many times have you heard ""My college kid is a computer wiz"" ""My neighbor's kid is a computer whiz"" ""I'll just have my tech department at work fix it for free"" ""I'm in the IT field, I can fix it myself"""
Staples,3d6utk,rons_moustache,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:27:27 2015 UTC,"You're right on all of those points, which is why I say if we were to lower prices to reasonable, non scammy, and cheaper than Best Buy, rates, we would have business. I don't know about where you live, but the Best Buy near me still has hordes of people bringing in stuff for repairs. Not to mention, if we charged $50 instead of $160, people would be more inclined to get their stuff repaired instead of throwing it away. The reason for the throw it away society mindset is because most places gouge customers for tech work."
Staples,3d6utk,Tyler11223344,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"The big thing is it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. You don't sell so you don't get hours, and because you don't have hours you don't have the staff to sell or really do much when you do sell, lowering satisfaction, lowering repeat business, and further reducing sales.  That said, it sounds like your store's kinda got its head up its ass. You can do plenty of things to get around charging for a diag and repair, like if it turns out you need to wipe it, you can charge for an OS re-install for $99 (assuming they have the discs, otherwise they get to pay for that parts order). Etc."
Staples,3d6utk,staplesfisticuffs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:48:44 2015 UTC,I actually tried to do that once. Got chewed out for taking a computer without charging for a Diag and Repair. Then they charged the guy the extra $70
Staples,3d6utk,Tyler11223344,3,Tue Jul 14 18:59:14 2015 UTC,"I actually chewed out one of my fellow Tech associates for charging a guy a Diag charge when the fix was going to take 20 minutes and the customer config charge for an easy to fix unable to locate profile issue.  My SSM came to talk to me when she heard about me making the complaint and asked me why it was an issue if it brought more money into the building. I looked at her weird and said ""There's doing business and helping the customer and making money at the same time, and there's biting the hand that feeds. Charging the guy a diag charge on something that can be fixed in 20 minutes with a custom config charge is easier than pissing a customer off and losing his business in the long run."""

Staples,3d6utk,Tyler11223344,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:18:12 2015 UTC,"The easiest way that I would explain things when people came in saying ""Oh I think I have viruses"" is that the $70 Diag charge gets bundled into the virus removal charge, so when we go to ring up the virus removal charge, you only have the pay the difference between the Diag and the virus removal because you already paid the $70.  My last store's GM was anal retentive about not refunding the $70 then applying it towards the Virus Removal. So not only did they pay the $70 for the diag, but they'd have to pay the full price of a virus removal, then when they came to pick up the computer, they'd get the refund of the diag. Scummy as shit because he didn't want seeing refund charges on the tills. Had more customers complain about it when he wasn't there."

It's scores have been great from what I've seen and I haven't seen performance issues on any decent PC. I really like some of their new products and they appear to have some other great technologies in the works. While not entirely different than old McAfee, Intel definitely has had a nice impact. People said the same sort of things when I was a huge fan of Kaspersky(and how can you not be unless you're worried about some crazy Russian conspiracy) a few years back."
Staples,3d7e7t,FormerSCIA,2,Tue Jul 14 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"I hate Kaspersky. Their support is incompetent and made me look like a fool in front of my customer.  I convinced her to go with Kaspersky over her ISP provided AV (which is usually some third party crap company) and my tech forgot to properly activate it, which he does a lot. Anyhow, she called Kaspersky support after having had the PC for a matter of hours, and they told her it had a virus and to bring it back in.  If they can't even figure out whether their software is activated or not, I don't have any respect for them. Plus, since it was solely my recommendation she based it off of, I look like a fucking idiot.  So yea, Kaspersky is a manu/company that has let me down, and therefore I no longer make any effort to sell it over Norton. I have no time for manufacturers that aren't able to back me up in my work. I should be able to find something based on specs, say hey, this will work, and then it works for them.  Instead, it's this game of juggling which Asus craptop is less likely to fail, trying to get them to upgrade, or trying to get them to buy the EasyCare so I don't have to hear them come back bitching in 6 months."

Is it saying, Internet Explorer has stopped working, that kind of crash? Can you successfully use IE when in safe mode? Or does it do the same stuff? I'm just trying to see if something might be conflicting with it in this one. I'd also try temporarily uninstalling any AV we put on there too, sometimes they can interfere with things like this.

If Its an 8.1 machine, which Im going to guess it is, you won't be able to run it though (At least I haven't found a working version for 8.1, haven't checked in some time though).  I would also try removing AV, unless when you did a clean install it wouldn't work immediately after you did the clean install, then probably not the AV.   If a computer isn't working immediately after a clean install, meaning just Windows, not the image from Dell (it could be bad) that's a bit of a red flag."

If it passes, let them know there's nothing wrong with the hardware. Reinstall Windows from scratch. (Personally I'd be charging the customer but I'm not sure how USA's total support works.) Test everything, in front of the customer if you have to. Don't take hours, 20 minutes will do. If they still complain, tell them there is nothing you can fix as nothing is broken.  Let them call corporate, and when you get your hot alert, have everything documented down to the nines. Submit said documentation back to corporate, and make sure to keep copies. If they still come down and tell you guys to do whatever it takes to make the customer happy, I'd be walking out.  This plan only works if you have tech savvy management who actually have a backbone. No one actually has to walk out, but I've had many cases in my store where something absurd is cause by a customer, and yet we're told it's our job to fix it.

Corporate doesn't always catch onto things like this. It took them a week or two to fix an issue we had where you'd basically get a Starbucks coffee maker for free. It was marked down to a certain price, then people would bring in a coupon that rendered it priceless by then. Several hundred dollars lost in just one day"

Staples,3d3axe,palehorse864,3,Mon Jul 13 14:21:43 2015 UTC,No thats not what happened. My manger gave me my last check in the form of paper before the pay period because I guess they pushed it through. I had no idea that later on I'd receive a direct deposit check the next week. This was not something that happened in the same day otherwise I wouldve waited to cash the check.
Staples,3d3axe,kirashi3,3,Mon Jul 13 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"So, you cashed a check, not knowing direct deposit was coming, and then Staples direct deposited money on its own afterward? I'm not sure what the proper thing for this situation is, but I just wanted to help clarify."
Staples,3d3axe,staplesfisticuffs,3,Tue Jul 14 02:43:58 2015 UTC,"That's an error on Staples part in this situation. They were full aware of giving you the paper cheque before direct deposit went through, and it's not your problem that they forgot to stop the direct deposit.  Could they come and ask for it back? Yes. Is it considered theft? That completely depends on if you ask Staples, your bank, or a neutral third party. I'm not telling you to take it and run, but if they ask, I'd play it off that you've already spent both the cheques and couldn't correct their mistake even if you wanted to. Emphasis on making it known it was their fault they double payed you."

I agree that I am being paid in part for my technical knowledge which I had when I was hired and that it is all part of the package they hired. I don't mind that and I proudly say that I have several people a day that come into my store to ask me technology questions because they have heard that I will be honest and will give good advice. It's a part of the job I love.   The part of the training that I got through, talked about training customers on software and being an expert on any software that we sell. I don't believe that it is my job to be an ""expert"" on anything that I am not interested in unless Staples plans to pay me to learn it and provide the proper avenue for that training.   I have yet to see a training in talent track that would give me any confidence whatsoever to walk a customer through a product. It is only focused on the ""features"" that would help a customer purchase it and not any actual functionality. Now add any of the software titles like Quickbooks, Photoshop, Paintshop, Office, etc....   If Staples wants to pay me to become MOS certified I will be all over it, but based on the ""training"" we are given now, I will look like a fool in front of the customer which is people that I have to live with in my community. I have no idea how to use most of the software we sell and have no desire to look like a fool, so if my choice is to fake it through with the customer or not do it, the choice is easy"

As our resident technician (was/still am tech supervisor as well) I have numbers for returns, because our MODs never seem to be available up front when we need them for this. (Don't get me wrong; this is mostly because they help out around the store because of our low hours)  the unfortunate side of this is they seem to think I have full Keyholder status, and ask me to do things that a Keyholder would do, even though I don't have keys.

Staples,3d17f1,WhateverItTakes10x,4,Mon Jul 13 05:12:43 2015 UTC,"Same. We could try to schedule someone on the floor, but it's usually the IS (me) who is busy covering everything.

But between all of the tasks that need to be done with no payroll, he's usually doing a plano while I'm doing light tasking on the floor or covering everyone's breaks. Half of my shift is pretty much on register. Our payroll is so bad that often the fourth person IS our GM.  For the record, too, our CSAT is always platinum. With radios and our customer service, theft is still up. Our loss prevention mentioned that tier 4 stores do notice a spike in theft compared to tier 3 stores. And besides, the most we're allowed to do is ask customers that are shady if we can help them find anything. If they say, ""No"" all we can do is keep an eye on them as they wander back into the store while we get stuck with either customers that DO want help or registers. And since there's no one in office supplies, there are plenty of nooks and crannies for thieves to do their deed. The payroll is atrocious, and it's clear that whoever thinks that tier 4 stores should be run like this are in a vacuum or have never had experience at the store level."

If I'm falling behind on a task, I can typically ask him to pick up another task for me like the odd cycle count or an extra ZB other than the one a month they're required by policy to do. I have never really had a manager quite like him. If he leaves the company, I'm probably not going to stick around."

Staples,3d1ymy,kirashi3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"Our recycling program in Canada is actually made easier when customers bring us the original boxes. They fit into the bigger cardboard box we have in the back better, and when it's full we simply UPS it out the door."

Staples,3d19z9,HimekoTachibana,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"We only get tags for items that we have in stock so the tags differ store to store depending on what the AS/400 says. If your store has it in stock but mine doesn't, I wouldn't get the tag since I wouldn't have any product to tag. It's crazy because my store gets random clearance tags for furniture but we didn't know where the heck they were until Inventory. AKA $100 bookcases for only $20, etc."

I'm done.....Matrix is now officially going to be part of my selling pitch for everything. I'm just going to be honest with the customers, we have a group of people in another state that will connect to your computer and run our tools in order to clean it up. Once you pay I have no control over what happens to your computer and if it isn't done properly, I have a phone number you can call to complain."

Staples,3d1qpz,kirashi3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:39:30 2015 UTC,tldr purely matrix based orders that are taken in by noon day 1 need to be ready for pickup by 5pm day 2 or it's free.   I've got a whole PowerPoint printout that I can pull info from if you want but it's mostly marketing fluff. Lots of correlation implying causation and the like.
Staples,3d1qpz,staplesfisticuffs,2,Tue Jul 14 07:47:44 2015 UTC,"Nah it's ok about sending me the marketing thing. I could send you ours from Canada, but you'd throw up when you saw the expected timeframe for a setup.  Without data transfer: 30-45 minutes of associate time. Ready by close same day if booked in before noon. With data transfer: 120-300 minutes of associate time. Also ready by close same day if booked in before noon.  No where does it mention how much data is to be transferred. Most people only have 5GB-150GB of data, so this is attainable. I'm still waiting for that one f?cker to come in with 750GB of photography and random junk, only to be joyfully told ""Yes sir, your setup will be done by close today or it's free!""  Guess who gets the brunt of it for that? Or for not having a setup done because someone didn't know or forgot to note down their password. :) love it."

Staples,3d1neq,Tyler11223344,0,Sun Jul 12 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"It's because those dates are expected to be very busy business wise and they need all of their employees available to work.

It always cracks me up the people who apply for retail jobs and get hired but then want off at the most inopportune times (i.e. back to school, black friday, etc.)  I don't know if Staples has a policy written that states what you are looking for...you know the one that states you are at least 18, no longer a kid, translating into still being able to go on family vacations.    You say that 2 write ups are too many for you...simple solution then...don't go."

Staples,3d1neq,hermanhansel920,-3,Tue Jul 14 02:15:17 2015 UTC,"Call HR, tell them you do understand that staples has vacation blackouts ... but explains that your parents unaware of the rules, and your parents bought expensive tickets and made plans for a family vacation and ask them to help you to make an exception for you. also you can give Staples 2 weeks notice, leave on good terms and then reapply for the job when you come back (a little risky)"
Staples,3d1neq,WhateverItTakes10x,3,Sun Jul 12 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"So going over the managers head is just going to piss him/her off and probably won't help anyway. Second, using ""my parents"" as an excuse seems really immature. I mean we are all adults here aren't we? Don't blame your parents and use them as an excuse. Third, just because you leave and are re-hirable doesn't mean they have to rehire you. Pulling shit like that will not make them want to rehire you. Bad advice all around. Sorry."

Furthermore, it shows you care more about a price than you do about a person remaining gainfully employed. So fucking ignorant.

If I was the grey shirt I would tell her ""I agree with you, but I just tried that for another customer about 2 hours ago and it didn't work the register wouldn't allow the price adjustment, I called our Help-desk and they said they couldn't change the register functions.  Sorry, I need my job so I can't just hand you the item or scan something else, I'd get fired"".  They leave without a fuss, It never fails.

A lot of the staples orders that were placed for that item are being voided because of the invalid price matching (at least, that's what I was told by xchannel).

Give that whining bitch her 5 page copy job for free, because she had to wait 2 whole minutes. Make sure to periodically sit on your ass in the office to kill some time and keep your sanity. Delegate stupid shit to someone else. If they page you to the front, call the phone and ask what the hell they want, because half the time it's permission to mark down something by a dollar because the tag was old. Get as much hard work done in the morning as you can, before it gets busy. Be thankful for the nice customers you get.. Don't let the assholes ruin your day (difficult, I know.) Take 10 minutes to sit down and think about what you need to accomplish for the week, and make a plan. Find out what's most important to your GM/DM, and focus on that.

I can't just stop that to have one of them refresh a POG or set an endcap.

Staples,3czekc,staplesfisticuffs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:37:23 2015 UTC,"""Delegating"" at Staples is almost laughable.  Usually there is no one to delegate to.   PoGs are a joke, the system usually only give 25% of the actual amount of time needed to do the PoG right. Any task that an OS is assigned is constantly interrupted by customers needing help, being called to ship center and back up cashier.  I shoot pull lists before I leave, then give them to the managers.  The Ops manager will delegate them out and collect them, and most of the time they make the adjustments. If the SM is closing, it is not even worth shooting pull lists at all because he waits until 8pm to hand them out (if at all), then basically throws them away with no adjustments.  It is good that you have a GM that used to have your job, they can help you assign priorities. My current GM was a SM and has no clue about anything on the Ops side so he is constantly all over my OM and me for not helping in tech more, while at the same time bitching things are not done in OS (when the DM points them out)."

Staples,3czr5n,staplesthrowaway666,3,Sun Jul 12 07:59:51 2015 UTC,"It's actually fairly typical to terminate an employee who has put in his/her two weeks (the reasoning is that the employee probably would slack off and his/her productivity might drop). Suppose op does have a new job lined up, it takes time for unemployment bennies to kick in so Staples won't be out anything financially. Besides, unemployment is far less than a regularl wage, so I think it costs Staples less anyway.  EDIT: Also, some states make it difficult to get unemployment if you are terminated with cause as opposed to being laid off."
Staples,3czr5n,cmyers84,3,Sun Jul 12 10:25:02 2015 UTC,"Only he said ""6 days in to my 2 weeks notice period"", so that seems odd.  If you put your two weeks notice in and they don't want you to stay, for the reasons you stated, you're asked to leave at that moment and it's still considered resigning and you can be rehired.  The fact that the OP was allowed to stay for the two weeks notice then terminated, means something was out of the norm.  There's a chance they were going to be fired anyway so the two weeks wouldn't have mattered but if they told them to resign on the spot then they couldn't terminate them and list them as not rehireable."
Staples,3czr5n,FaxForRA,3,Sun Jul 12 14:38:40 2015 UTC,Stores hours got cut and seeing that I was leaving they saw it more viable to cut me as and give whatever hours leftover to the other employees. Yes I did give notice to leave for a new job however I did plan on working the full 2 weeks. To my suprise I came into work to find I wasnt on next weeks revised schedule. My dm called my gm because I wasnt on the brand new schedule. She found out it was my last day and that was that.

The other file box is where we put the store copy after the Verizon corporate ones have been sent out.

Staples,3ctyj7,temotos,2,Fri Jul 10 20:04:35 2015 UTC,"At our store they always come to the store first, and if I'm not mistaken they have the associates address on them and we're supposed to send them back out in the mail to the associates address, but I've never seen that happen, when it doesn't show up on the day it's supposed to people usually just come pick it up at the store."

Staples,3ctyj7,BigRichie2897,4,Fri Jul 10 23:37:18 2015 UTC,"Did not give notice due to the new job saying start asap along with being treated like dog shit at this store.  It showed it was being mailed.  As for the state Labor laws I work in Michigan and every other place I have quit, whether notice or not I have always gotten a check."
Staples,3ctyj7,kloops,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:38:43 2015 UTC,I wonder if other retail store employees hate their company as much as staples employees hate staples.
Staples,3ctyj7,Kodiack,2,Sat Jul 11 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"Nope!  I've worked a few jobs over the years. On the store-based retail side, I've worked at two different Target stores and at Staples.  One gig at Target was mediocre. Another gig at Target was great, and my coworkers were a joy to see every day. And then there was Staples. Staples sucked.  Staples was the absolute worst job I've ever worked in my life, bar none. I even spent eight months footing calls for Comcast through Support.com. That job got bad near the end, but I'd still sooner work for Comcast than even think about applying at Staples again.  One piece of advice that I've given to many Staples employees that shared similar complaints was to just get out. Staples does not treat their employees nicely, and if someone's a tech, then they have no place at Staples. They would be better off working at McDonald's, Walmart, or really anywhere else, and then building up some clients on the side.  Staples was hell for my sanity. When I quit Staples, I left without a job offer because I simply could not find any motivation while working at Staples. Fortunately, I landed the gig at Support.com very shortly after, and was paid >50% more per hour, had a full-time position, and consistent hours.  Fortunately, the Staples store that I worked for has since closed down, so at least I have that to be thankful for."
Staples,3ctyj7,staplesfisticuffs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think, as is the case for any retail or chain, it comes down very largely to the local management and your coworkers.  I transferred from one store to another and the difference was night and day. There are still some pretty shitty things about working here, but overall I don't come in thinking about quitting that day every shift."

Staples,3cswni,FaxForRA,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"The store hours are 9-7 Mon-Fri and 10-7 on Sat that must have made it easy to make the schedule.  Two questions one: Did they say why it's closing , rent, low performance, etc. and did you used to get happy endings at the Massage Envy?"
Staples,3cu5yj,temotos,6,Fri Jul 10 20:19:52 2015 UTC,"The biggest change is that everything you sell doesn't exist until you make it. Customers rarely understand that.  Don't have the particular laptop in stock the customer is looking for? Well you got a bunch of alternatives. Pens? An entire aisle to choose from. 100,000 color copies? Nope, those are being made just for you which means yes, its expensive and no, it won't be done in a couple hrs.  My advice: become friendly with the owner of your local liquor distribution establishment and hopefully you'll get a good discount."
Staples,3cu5yj,Bokchoi75,5,Fri Jul 10 20:36:32 2015 UTC,"It is the most stressful yet can be the most rewarding department. Keep calm, dont bend on copywritten stuff, learn time management fast and know that drinking will become a favorite past time if you dont know how to handle crowds or take things personally. You can only satisfy so many people meaning people will leave mad and upset and angry. Pick your battles, make money and use the systems in place.   There should be a small raise for changing departments but it may only be 10 to 20 cents. If youre in a good cpc, star points are plenty."
Staples,3cu5yj,ShenanigansAllDay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:21:54 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that the biggest profit comes from cpc so using the system will result in good times.

I said it before and I'll keep saying it, CPC customers are by far, the rudest, angriest, craziest people to walk in the store.  This is a verifiable fact and you will bare witness to it."
Staples,3cu5yj,FaxForRA,3,Sat Jul 11 00:00:28 2015 UTC,"It's completely different from front end. You have a whole bunch of new equipment and programs to learn, on top of register."
Staples,3cu5yj,haze_gray,2,Fri Jul 10 20:30:19 2015 UTC,a crap load of star points if your CPC is any good. Seems like the folks over there always get the most out of anyone.
Staples,3cu5yj,toothpick21,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:41:12 2015 UTC,Too bad the dept sets you up to fail so there's no chance majority of stores even meeting those goals anymore
Staples,3cu5yj,magic_is_might,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:57:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's changed recently, I don't know. I avoid the copy center at all costs. I do know that my CPC supervisor bought herself and her son's Christmas with all her star points last year. Something like 5 grand she had. And they won some contest early in the year where they all got 1000 points (or some other absurd number).   I'm the IS - I've worked here for over a year and I just now have 220 points. 165 of those came from winning the safety bingo. When I found out I won I said ""yes!! I can get more than a skateboard screw now!"".   In all honesty....star points don't mean shit to me. I really don't care if I ever get any and I never log in to the website.  Star points don't pay my bills."
Staples,3cu5yj,toothpick21,2,Sat Jul 11 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the store.  In my former store the cpc supervisor and her second in command were treated like rockstars because they were amazing.  That said they still got the insane, going to bitch because I can customers.  Like everyone before has said plan to drink, pick your battles, DO NOT BUDGE ON COPYRIGHT...if it looks like it is then 99.99% of the time it is copyrighted.  That said it is the most rewarding part of the store because most of your customers are normal and you will get the ones who you help that are so grateful and appreciative of what you did for them that it makes it all worth the bullshit.  Also if your store hits its cpc goals you will rake in starpoints like a fiend."
Staples,3cu5yj,Sorebaby,2,Sat Jul 11 12:58:16 2015 UTC,"As a former CPC associate and Office Depot CPD Supervisor, I can say you are in for a wild ride. Besides what everyone else has said about batshit crazy customers... STAY ON TOP OF SUPPLIES. Especially if your CPC manager is not there every day. If you notice you opened the last ream of a specialty paper, leave a note to order more. we had a chart we could write in when we knew something was low or needed to be ordered. The supplies come on the truck with the rest of the store merch so they get lost easily and/or could take a while to come in.   Be consistent and stick with policy. You will get a lot of ""they did it for me at the other store why can't you???"" and those are the stores we hate. No I can't copy your driver's license in color, type up your resume for you, or fix your thumbnail of a logo in photoshop for free. GIVE QUOTES AND PROOFS. EVERY. TIME. This way nobody is surprised at anything. You reduce waste and wasted time if you don't have to throw out 200 copies because the customer didn't have the money for it or didn't like the way they came out. Copy Hold all day 'erry day.  The general public has no idea about what goes on in CPC. They won't understand why their flyers came out looking purpleish gray when ""it looks blue on the computer."" Just be patient, not many people know what you know. Even some graphic designers will not be able to get the concept of full bleed printing. Also remember that the department is not your personal small business. Do not be upset when things go wrong or people get pissed and yell at you for something that is out of your control (network outage, out of engineering paper, no replacement fuser module). I have done many a return on copies because the customer either changed their mind or they were promised an impossible completion time. The dept is so profitable that the small stuff like that doesn't matter.   All of this being said, it really is a very rewarding department. For all of the crazies you get, you will get that one customer you love working with who will make it worth it. it's actually all worth it when you guess the correct amount of paper for the bypass tray. I've had customers bring me donuts, cupcakes, bottles of wine, etc. Because of the amount of time spent on certain jobs you will get to know lots of different people. There are a few out there who really do appreciate how much work goes into CPC.  Sorry... I didn't realize I had so much to say about it, but good luck and godspeed my future copy wizard!   tl;dr Know your stock and stay organised. Be patient with the idiots they really don't understand how CPC works, don't take anything personally. For every 10 bad customers you have 1 amazing one."
Staples,3cu5yj,musclemoose,2,Mon Jul 13 19:17:39 2015 UTC,"First, have fun!  CPC is a great time if you have fun with it.  Remember, it's just paper...don't stress!  I went to home office and taught the business services team the basics of CPC and my first thing I told them was, it gets stressful and people like to yell at you....  Multitasking is key.  Never be not doing something.  Today a lady came in for business cards for a dog place.  Helped her a bit, got her proof, told her come back in an hour or two.  Same time, I went on SPP and made a digital sample of custom dog bones with her logo.  No, she didn't buy them...but maybe she will next time, who knows?  Second, under promise, over deliver.  ""When are you using this?""  Give yourself time.  Don't let people tell you they need it in an unreasonable amount of time.  Remember (in your head) your lack of planning isn't my priority.  I'd rather call a customer saying I'm done a day early than call them begging for more time.  Utilize your DCS.  To the hub to the hub to the hub hub hub!  1-100-1000.  Yup, make friends with your hub!  Even though it's not your business, it's your business!  Upswell, suggestive sell and be a print professional.  Don't just push color because it's more expensive, push it because it increases understanding by 78%.  Don't push mount/lam cause your ticket price goes up.  Suggest it because it adds a nice finished look and easier to display.  I don't worry about increasing sales, I worry about taking care of what my customers need.  If I worry about my customers, the sales will follow.  Yeah, star points rock!  I'm at 17,400.  Be over budget!  Remember charge your worth.  Quick edits is amazing!  If they want you to deal with non-print ready files and make edits, you can...for a small fee.  Remember to leverage your promos.  I sold $5000 worth of lunch custom lunch boxes a few weeks back by pushing my 20% off SPP coupon.  Use the WIKIs and communities.  Great source of info and fun!"
Staples,3cu5yj,Dumbwaiterboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:18:14 2015 UTC,This is A++ advice right here
Staples,3cu5yj,Pyroechidna1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:10 2015 UTC,"Expect needy customers and yes this is a stressful and time consuming part of the store. If your associates and supervisor are supportive and good communicators, everything will be fine albeit busy. You'll still get dragged to backup cashier but most of your emphasis will be on processing orders, encouraging customers to sign up for BDP (or to interact with an Account Manager, find out about this ASAP from your fellow CPC), and staying updated on your training. Advice would be to relax and set reasonable deadlines for any project and watch out for etsy and copyright issues. Usually you will also get a payraise (a slight one but still) if they code you correctly and if coded as CPC, you will earn a fair bit of Star Points if your CPC is doing fine"

Staples,3crb7z,GoodFoBidness,3,Fri Jul 10 04:43:20 2015 UTC,Nothing. But that's ok IMO. As long as you ask them to fill it out and bring it back and as long as you don't force it on people.
Staples,3crb7z,chi7891,3,Fri Jul 10 13:17:33 2015 UTC,"Stores in my district have a goal card where you track how many actual sign ups you get (meaning they fill out the form for you to enter in then), and also track digital receipts, surveys circled, Omni orders, and Square Trades. Completely on the honor system, but it's pretty easy to tell if someone's faking it.  Also when you enter a rewards card info, you have to put your employee ID, but I don't think it actually tracks anything that way."

One of the cashiers at my store regularly gets 40-60 in a shift, and she only works 9-3. I finally got a chance to see what she's doing, and she basically asks them if they have a card, and if they say no she grabs one, scans it and asks them to fill it out."

You don't get credit for sign ups unless they're entered at the store.  The way she's doing it, she's getting the customer to fill it out right there, and if people aren't interested they'll just say no thanks. ""Assume the sale"" kinda thing."

Then I get led to the training computer and handed hundreds of rewards signups... I did like 300 in one day but now that our store is adequately caught up, typically they go for about 20 a day. Also I prefer using CPC's Solution Builder to sign people up for rewards; especially if they are just right there"

Staples,3cq4fl,venturer95,3,Fri Jul 10 15:22:57 2015 UTC,"""The APWU protested the Staples-USPS deal in April in 2014 and called for a boycott of Staples stores and the company’s Quill.com website. The union represents 200,000 USPS workers, about half the total number of post office employees, and their average wage was $25 an hour. A sales associate at Staples earns about $8.50 an hour.  The USPS figured it could cut its costs by using what it called 'retail partner labor' instead of USPS employees, and that is true. The USPS could save about two-thirds of its labor costs by using Staples employees.""  Of course. Why pay someone $25 an hour when you can pay some high school student minimum wage to do the exact same job, all while getting rewards, digital receipts, More Accounts, ESP, tech, BDPs, etc.."
Staples,3cq4fl,StaplesArbitor,5,Thu Jul 9 23:46:10 2015 UTC,"It is worth noting though, that unlike any other organization related to the government, only the postal service has to basically pre-pay into the potential retirement funds of their employees on a regular basis.

Always frame it as we have an option for them, but it's paid, if you're willing to actually help with it. As an example, we have a tutorial sku that we use for any generic help-customer-for-longer-than-5-minutes activity.   I tend to just say ""I understand these devices can be a bit confusing at first, so I would suggest you continue using it some more. If it all clicks, as I suspect it will, fantastic, and if not, you'll have plenty of questions we can go over! We offer tutorials for a small fee and I can personally assist you with any difficulties you may be encountering with your device so you can fully enjoy it.""  Generally I find they drop the issue if they don't want to pay or they're totally gung ho for it. Those tutorials may not be the most efficient use of time, but they really can help you build a relationship with the customer.  My rule is based on two factors for whether to charge or not:   Is it less than 5 or 6 minutes to fix? I always do this with the caveat ""I'll have to charge next time"" though, as it makes them a bit more cautious I find. If so, is it something the customer could've done if I told them the problem?  (IE: Mistyped information, etc. Obviously they can't install a whole computer or something, so we charge for that as that's part of my skillset I'm employed for. It's kind of like an (honest) mechanic wouldn't charge you for dirty windows if it was as simple as a wash (though he probably wouldn't wash them himself), but if you needed your wipers replaced, that's fair game.)   They can be really temperamental. I don't know, if I suck at selling, I can at least say with confidence that it's extremely rare I have anyone get mad at me for something that isn't a Staples policy or something someone else did (IE: sold them MSO365 when they only needed H&S for one comp, and never explained it was a sub).  Except fat old contankerous bastard guy. He's old, only has a few good years left, and as far as I can tell, is determined to ensure nobody else enjoys them in his stead.

Protip: If they're calling you, they're not smart enough you can help them over the phone.    As for the ""rhetorical questions to test"" thing. No kidding. I had a guy ask me one time (like my second shift in) ""I might buy a new comp, since I think I have a virus, but if I didn't, what parts would I have to remove to be absolutely sure it's gone?""  ""Well, in a standard configuration, your hard disk and MAAAAAYYYYYBBBEEEE your motherboard"" (I said that because there's all of 7 infections out there for the mobo bios)   ""I can see you can sell but you don't know shit. Get me someone who actually knows what they're talking about.""  Get friend in black easytech shirt  Repeats exactly what I said  ""Exactly! This guy had points at me no bloody idea what he was talking about!""  Hehehehe, just one more weakness for the brain hemorrhage I guess."

Staples,3covi6,TechMaster212,3,Thu Jul 9 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why Staples sucks and is failing as a company. They want that $15 so fucking bad they don't give a shit about the business they are potentially losing and it has cost them the very customers the business was founded to provide for: the business customer. Every CopySAT we would see the complaints: ""Had to stand in line while the associate faxed for someone for $2. Then they had to run 5 BW copies. Then they had to fax for $4. Then run another 10 BW copies. All I wanted to do was pickup my $1000 dollar CPC order."" Then when Joe $1000 dollar order doesn't come back ever again you gotta explain to the corporate big shots why you're sales are down."

Staples,3covi6,OldOnliner,0,Fri Jul 10 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"He's right. It's fine when nobody is there, but otherwise you're letting opportunity knock and you keep the door shut.   One printer with full inks gets us several hours of margins on a tutorial. That's a basic example."
Staples,3covi6,s_webermanjensen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:55:55 2015 UTC,That's not what it's for.    Change your inks for you?  Clean your printhead so you can use that ink or buy new ones? Need your wireless turned on? Need to reboot that Kindle/iPad/Droid?  Need to know if that cable works?    None of this stuff takes any longer than getting someone their toner/ink or an external drive. Or helping someone showroom in the networking or PCs.   WAKE UP! EVERY customer is an opportunity!
Staples,3covi6,OldOnliner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:36:03 2015 UTC,"I'm talking margins here. One printer with 4 inks will get you the same amount of profit that several hours of tutorials will.

I would get away with it because no one would believe I would say ""go fuck yourself"" to a customer, but I'm afraid I would pick the wrong person like it could be a reporter with a hidden camera doing a piece on retail customer service and they catch it all on video, Lol that would be bad."

Calling out or just stop showing up. You don't realize you're putting stress on your fellow employees and will probably taint their opinion of you after you leave. Staples themselves put a lot of the callout stuff on themselves. SOme people don't see the justification to work through being sick or skipping a quickly planned event. I get it.

Of course. So we started the process of removing him, and he came in a day later to ""give notice"", fuck you man."

They already have a schedule for everyone else to cover what needs to happen, so it doesn't really matter when someone comes in to do trainings.  However, it sounds like the managers aren't really on top of... managing, so you may need to just politely remind them about things. As said, call to ask when your next shift should be. Document when you worked, even if they didn't give you official papers. Most of the time it'll just be ""when did you work"" ""two days, first 1-6 and the other 11 to 4"" or whatever, and they'll say ok and put punches in for you.

Staples,3comxr,xFAFF,6,Thu Jul 9 15:11:36 2015 UTC,I started working at Staples as a tech with no time in OS.  I reviewed no formal training and have just learnt as I went. Nothing is that difficult and nobody expects you to know everything. And at the end of the day it's easy tech at Staples don't stress out about it.
Staples,3comxr,DwightArmy,2,Thu Jul 9 20:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but my DM has been nailing my GMs ass lately on sales and Square Trade specifically. Even from the register I can hear my GM explaining to the Techs what our DM expects, and my GM is really easy to get along with and is great at giving us some spirit and motivation, but I feel like Tech is just 120% hell and there won't be 5 minutes without me being reminded to bring in X amount in sales, X percent in attachment, etc.. I wanna be happy with what I do, but I don't wanna be lethargic and look like I dont care and risk being laid off or demoted (honestly I'd rather be demoted than laid off)."
Staples,3comxr,venturer95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:21:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've got a great GM to start with.. As a manager who is often coaching in tech, the way I see it, I want my techs to be confident in offering and suggesting all the products and services we have, but I'm never going to have a problem if y'all say the customer declined. Just offer, make sure you're doing so in a professional and knowledgeable manner, and you're all good. If you're constantly getting declines, ask a manager or your tech supervisor to float around and observe so they can help your technique.  SquareTrade w/ Accidental is really easy to sell on laptops under $300 because it's only $99, I always reference an example like spilling a cup of coffee on it.  The Squaretrade Printer kit (with the cables and wipes) is pretty easy to sell too since for the price of a single USB cable, you get a USB cable, ethernet cable, and 2 year protection plan. Can't really beat that. Oh, and if you're nice, price match the .com price on the 6ft USB cables, $5.99.  Until you're working on computers, it's all about selling and knowing what you sell. When intaking tech work, the OMS guides you through everything and questions to ask, so since you seem to have appropriate tech knowledge already you should be fine.  You'll find tons of people here willing to help you out and answer any questions, too :)"
Staples,3comxr,Mattpat139,6,Fri Jul 10 15:50:30 2015 UTC,Watch a lot of Techquickie on youtube I watched that for several hours straight when i started and now there are very few things i don't know
Staples,3comxr,Mattpat139,3,Thu Jul 9 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Its really just all the old couples who come in that are very very computer illiterate and to top it off, very rude and think they know more than we do.  Example: guy told me how he recently got a bad virus (it was CryptoLocker) and was very animated about it, how he has MalwareBytes, AVG, some others. Said the virus was telling him he had hundreds of viruses but he had to pay them, so he called them and at this point my brain shut off because I couldn't bare to listen to Mr.Virus Expert. I tried to explain to him what the virus was, how to stay safe, and he could bring his computer in and we could check it for free to ensure it was completely clear (like he said it was... after using 6 security programs...). He would cut over me everytime I tried to explain, and basically tell me I was wrong and how hes completely fine now, with the biggest smile on his face as though he just conquered the world. Now, I was cashier at the time so my patience was thin because I had a line forming. But people like him... just... why... how...."
Staples,3comxr,elentirion,3,Thu Jul 9 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"the thing is, I know I'm suppose to be nice and always smiling but when I'm explaining something like wiping a hard drive, or viruses, it's OK to be serious. people are bringing in 500$+ machines containing their livelihood family photos and accounting info. It's a shame the vast majority of people still see pcs as big complicated and hard to break, when its the exact opposite. Also, when you hand a pc back to a customer remind them a PC's like a car, you gotta bring it in for maintenance a few times a year and not all of your problems are going to be solved cheaply."

Staples,3comxr,OldWeirdPro,3,Fri Jul 10 02:43:07 2015 UTC,"If you're familiar with what product your store carries, talk to your other experienced tech's and ask about certain things that most people are interested in. Make sure you know the basic differences between the hardware that comes in the machines that we sell (ie Core i7 v Core i3 and 8GB vs 4GB of RAM and what it would mean for the customer's use). There is plenty of reading material for the tech services and square trade (which you're probably already familiar with as a cashier), but make sure you know it if you aren't certain that you do. There is a lot of training material around Apple usually and a fair amount around Microsoft products such as Office.  Otherwise, I would say that it is learning as you go, but if you pay attention, you'll learn it quickly. One of my tech's came in from OS and not because he knew a ton about computers. He knew a fair amount and he was really comfortable with offering our services and he sells quite well (the best in fact)."
Staples,3comxr,StaplesArbitor,2,Thu Jul 9 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"Ive sold computers and electronics at my other jobs, but I feel like between Matrix and the very high expectations Staples holds, its bogging me down. I have anxiety and take medication, which my GM knows (I feel comfortable with my management), and I feel like just throwing me into tech without any training at all or being told much how it works, how our services work, and how Matrix works, isn't entirely fair. Im already being scheduled for a few 7 hour shifts, and I don't feel I can do it.. I'd feel more comfortable doing a 4 or 5 so I can get the hang of things and not be on my own. I dont wanna let my manager down. I have no idea what to do."

I already told my manager I'd accept the hours but I've been thinking more and more and I'm regretting it so much"
Staples,3comxr,venturer95,2,Thu Jul 9 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, you should have a huge amount of tech and product training drop immediately in Talent Track once you are profiled as a tech. Take a deep breath and remain calm. You do not have to know everything about everything. First, learn how to do an intake. Second, learn how to connect to Matrix. Third, try to learn 3 important benefits (not features) about the products you sell most (laptops, printers, routers, etc.)  It might be difficult to get scheduled hours to do your training. Stay on your GM/AM to get it done, scheduled or not. When the store is slow ask for time to train. At my store we rarely had the opportunity to schedule time just for training. Take the initiative.  And seriously, don't sweat it. Be real with customers, talk with them and you will figure out what's most important and how to present it. Good luck!"
Staples,3comxr,operacarmen,2,Thu Jul 9 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"Thats the thing, I'll be under ""Office Supplies"" instead of Tech... so I hope I still can get those trainings? Maybe if I have some extra hours I can pick up during the week I can ask my GM to come in just to do that?"
Staples,3comxr,Pwnednub,2,Thu Jul 9 16:34:59 2015 UTC,"Even if you stay coded into OS, you can ask him to ""push"" the training libraries into your Talent Track. I'd advise that, as some of the training, while cheesy, can be helpful, especially things like the Surface and Ipad training. By the end of those, I could quote the stats in a heartbeat, and it made me come off far more confident to the customers."

Staples,3cm5f5,staplesfisticuffs,3,Thu Jul 9 00:55:00 2015 UTC,"Anyone from home office or HR that can speak to this? Was the 25 hour thing done for another reason, but timed so as to shift blame to Obama?"
Staples,3cm5f5,staplesfisticuffs,10,Thu Jul 9 00:13:48 2015 UTC,"So what happened was that after the ACA went into effect, part timers were allowed to work however, so long as their overall weekly average was less than 30. So if you took a week off, other weeks you could work longer. There's an out for companies that they don't have to offer ACA compliant plans if the employee meets certain criterion, which worked for them.  Then Obama specifically called Staples out as one of the companies using loopholes to dodge the ACA and allow their employees to access health care. Staples then maintained that it's always been policy to only give part time workers 20-25 hours a week, and that they've always enforced it. This is obviously not fucking true, as any part time worker can pull up their pay stubs from last year on Associate Connect and show significantly more hours than 25 hours... most part time workers who had Staples as their main job at my store were working anywhere between 30-40 hours before they started enforcing the 30 hours or less rule, let alone the 25.  But yeah. Corporate word kicked in almost immediately after Obama called the company out, and the managers get in deep shit if anyone goes over 25. Initially, the manager in charge of scheduling was scheduling people for 24 hours, but no one ever gets to clock out on time because our store's nuts, so they were still going over. Additionally, it doesn't allow for any schedule shifting to cover call-outs. So this manager then got forced into scheduling workers for 22.5 hours, and everyone's encouraged to find a way to fit in the extra hours somewhere.  This is all of course complete bullshit. Either the manager gets stuck scheduling people for shitty 4 or 5 hour shifts where people have to come in often for really short shifts (we're in a city with public transit, most people have a commute of at least 30 minutes to an hour) or 3 shifts that are almost 8 hours. If someone calls out and the only other people in the department are already at 22, well.. that department gets to go fuck itself.  And this company continually reduces what they offer part timers while asking for more and more, and asking us to push for more. ""Buying environment, not selling environment"" my ass. Credit cards, over-priced protection plans that now offer less, reduction in rewards, and pushing email receipts that are absolutely going to spam the shit out of customers... meanwhile in order to up online orders stock in store is slowly, mysteriously taking longer and longer to come back. Oh we don't have it, let's just order from the website and it'll arrive for you fast and free!  ..... yes I'm bitter about this. I like my coworkers so much, they're all great people (few exceptions now that we're having to scrape the bottom of the barrel) and don't deserve this treatment. If outside investors knew just how much short term cost cutting Staples did without any thought to how it impacts the future, stock would drop so fucking fast."
Staples,3cm5f5,eternistarr,3,Thu Jul 9 01:01:52 2015 UTC,This is completely true by my accounts. I remember one of our cashiers was always scheduled over 25 hours. I even remember the GM saying how they just can't average 37 hours (or whatever the number is).   I came to work the morning after Obama slammed Staples and read the press release. Next thing you know it's no part timers are ever to be scheduled over 25 hours. Absolutely never ever.   Ya know what?.....I was hired as a part timer....and I worked 10 weeks straight over 25 hours. I literally just looked at my paychecks and counted them. This was just last year too.

Staples,3cm3mg,copycenterhoe,6,Wed Jul 8 23:44:22 2015 UTC,"Hi there, lamination master here.  Accushield lamination is a 1.5mil hot lam applied to the printed side of a banner, and then trimmed flush. This means that Accushield will add scratch, water, and UV resistance to the printed edge, but is not designed to make a banner permanently waterproof. It is generally applied to inkjet printed scrim vinyl at DCSs.  If your customer wants a long term solution, the third party options are best. If your customer needs a banner that will be outdoors in a protected area (say, under a porch) but might still be rained on occasionally, Accushield is a great option!   I would estimate that a accushield banner on scrim would meet your customers requirements, as long as they take care of it between uses."
Staples,3cm3mg,alex10819,2,Wed Jul 8 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! We have an example of an accushield banner in the store, and played around with putting water/scratching/etc yesterday and it appeared to be waterproof, but i wasn't sure how it would hold up in actual rain. It's going to be at the top of a, I want to say tent? Something like this She doesn't have time to wait for third party, and I would hate for her to have to order a temporary banner for a few weeks to wait for a third party banner to show up."
Staples,3cm3mg,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:20:21 2015 UTC,"Waterproof, yes. Fadeproof, not really...but a HUGE improvement over unaccushielded. I wouldn't use one that wasn't accushield treated outside! Go for it. However, if she uses a lot of red in her colors, it will fade if in the sun-I don't care what you treat it with, red fades. Steer her towards blues. You need outdoor scrim and accushield. Don't forget the grommets! Better to do more than less. Heck, I'd do 4 on top and bottom for a 9 footer."
Staples,3cm3mg,Bokchoi75,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:52:46 2015 UTC,"The Accushield definitely makes it more durable and is well worth it if the customer is putting their banner outside. I did have some issues with the accushield and damage via UPS, if the banner gets squished the creases look 10 times worse than a non-accushield banner but thats a whole different issue."
Staples,3cm3mg,WorktheMoo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:59:04 2015 UTC,"As long as all the specifications in Solution Builder are correct and you do add accushield in the oversized finishing tab, nothing else different about any other order that would be sent to DCS. If concerned about the timing, you can give them a quick call to make sure it would make it on that time and also remember, the DCS can dropship to the customer's location (customer just needs to prepay for the order)."
Staples,3cm0u3,Staplesatthebeach,4,Wed Jul 8 23:22:26 2015 UTC,You cannot price match .com items. They are store specific.
Staples,3cm0u3,Fonzie9,4,Wed Jul 8 23:41:38 2015 UTC,"To elaborate, if it's in clearance in store, that is ONLY in THAT store-not online, and not even in other stores sometimes. They can't even go to another store where it's not clearance and price match it. Clearance prices are specific to YOUR store and not guaranteed elsewhere.... the idea is to sell through the merchandise in a certain store/stores and get it out, not firesale the particular item (usually seen when something goes online only). You're lucky if the manager even lets you return/rebuy..."
Staples,3cm0u3,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,2,Wed Jul 8 23:56:12 2015 UTC,Id say you're very lucky they do that. The point of clearance or final price is just get it out of the building.
Staples,3cm0u3,thestaplescollective,2,Thu Jul 9 00:02:13 2015 UTC,"Clearance only applies to in-store and you will notice that on your clearance signs, it will say ""stock is limited"". You should not be price matching any online orders with in-store clearance prices."
Staples,3cm0u3,exile0514,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:15:01 2015 UTC,"Sometimes an item is on clearance in the store because it won't be sold in stores or that particular store.  You'll often see the same item as ""Online Only"" on the website.  If they buy it online they pay the online price.  It happens a lot with printers usually when you have the display left, so it's just the store stock that's clearance if they want to make an exception then by all means do so but make sure you can get some attachments and they know about the survey if one prints."
Staples,3cm0u3,FaxForRA,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:06:37 2015 UTC,"Your manager is not correct. We don't price match clearance prices for the reason that our clearance prices are intended to help sell through physical stock in a store, but it doesn't mean we won't sell it elsewhere (.com). It's priced low so we clear space for new product in store, but the store's clearance price would not apply to any online stock because it's not clearance online.

I get so tired of customers thinking they are entitled just because I happen to be wearing a uniform at a retail store. We are also HUMAN!!! I get so tired of people walking in and just immediately talking down to me or another associate because they feel like they are the most important person in the store at that moment.   I actually had a guy who got mad at me when I tried to explain to him that I could not just let him walk out of the store with a similar product off the shelf without a return and exchange of the old product that was incorrect. He had bought some ink refills for a pen or something. He was so against the idea of me exchanging them through the system that he was going to just give me the extra dollar it would have cost for the new product. The customer is almost never right, but they are still living under the old saying...."

You should have read through the policy and procedure as part of the onsite training.    Essentially you need to document work order #, Customer name, date service performed, car millage out, car millage in.  It is a common misconception that the millage entry in OMS is where you get your millage pay from.    A manager should submit all onsite millage once a week.    That said, I know things don't go the way they are supposed to at Staples, but Staples will pay your onsite millage.    Before I left, I turned in nearly 2 years of millage that was unpaid.  Of course this couldn't just be entered into the ariba but it was submitted to some other dept.   It took about 2 months, but in the end I got about $1,000 in back millage pay."

The GM said to do it every Saturday (he never worked weekends) and the weekend manager said they couldn't do it (I learned later they just never learned how).    So when push came to shove and the DM came to question me why I had that many miles racked up and never submitted, the blame was on management, not me."

This is why payroll hours are cut but the amount of tasks and MAP initiatives go up. This is the reason DMs and RVPs will come in and trash your store knowing that you do not have the payroll to keep things to standard. Everyone at corporate is trying to secure their position and show that they are valuable. This is why you get in in items that are immediately put on RTW status. This is why you get PoGs on how to set up the maintenance closet. This why we were told to empty the overstocks.

It wasn't until about 2 months ago that I found out there was such a thing as a cycle count calendar. You don't actually need it. You can print your weekly counts from the gun on Mondays.   The only reason I found out about it is because the LP guy came in and told us to print it and write down our adjustments on it so we can have an understanding of what we are keying out to find trends. I was like ""uhhh cycle count calendar??""."

As long as you're not bringing any drama into work and there's no favoritism going on, who cares? I had a supervisor date a copy center associate, granted they were dating before he got promoted. Our GM knew. He didn't give two shits because they were professional and they both made money.  Just don't stress over it, but I'd say to keep it quiet if you do think there would be repercussions. But as long as everyone knows and is cool with it, there's no problem with it. I guess it all depends on the crew."

We kept is super low-key at work, just because we heard so many conflicting stories about relationships in the workplace.  The weird guy who does the zero-balance walks kept consistently creeping her out, so she left to go back to her waitressing job. It was all good after that.  My point is, even if someone had asked, I would just deny deny deny.  Then tell them, ""prove it"" if they persist."
Staples,3chacu,FaxForRA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:40:29 2015 UTC,It's really dependent on both your GM and your DM. As well as how many petty people there are in your store who might use reporting you for it as a way to retaliate against you or your partner.
Staples,3chacu,rons_moustache,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:13:59 2015 UTC,It's frowned on because if you break up and it's bad it could lead to a really negative work environment.  One or both of you could start being vindictive and that could lead to accusations real or false but just a headache that a GM would rather not have to deal with.  I disconnect personal and business but I do it at a non human level.  At another company I was a manager who was dating and living with a direct subordinate most people didn't know.  When she was pregnant with my child I was going to fire her for coming in late and being unprofessional to other co-workers.  I even asked another associate who knew we were dating if they wanted to file a formal complaint against her for what she did but they said no.  I told her when we started dating that she would not get special treatment but she didn't believe me and transferred to another department.  To this day she said she should have transferred before we got serious and she moved in with me.  Good luck to you I hope it works out just stay professional.

I once got a ""release"" from a customer's etsy designer who got the release from the copyright holder which gave the designer permission to use the copyrighted image for their own personal use and not etsy use. The customer was pissed that we wouldn't take the release.  Also, why the hell can no etsy design put bleed on the invites so they can be cut correctly?"

Sure, let's make engineering prints of pictures of your dog so you can make a collage on your wall - what do  you mean the picture quality sucks, it's an engineering print!

Staples,3cfh1i,markevens,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:21:14 2015 UTC,"Usually it's easy to tell. Disney characters, super heroes, children's cartoons. Pretty much, if you can name a company associated with the image. If it doesn't have a character or logo, it can be hard. Blue prints, professional photographs, even just drawings can sometimes be copyrighted. Our rule of thumb is that if you do a reverse Google search and don't find it, print it. If it shows up and one of the images links to a website where it has a copyright, don't print it."
Staples,3cfh1i,ShenanigansAllDay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"Best way to handle it is if trademarked characters than i refuse for that but if its nontrademarked images from etsy, get the creator of the file to email a release, have the customer sign a copywrite brochure and get a copy of their license and produce the job. It covers bases and makes the customer fustrated but they leave happy because its getting printed. I have several customers who do the printing thru me and send the prints to their customers instead of sending digital files to their customers."

I had a rough idea of what I'd be doing, and ditching my position at Staples is what gave me the motivation to finally strive for something better. Working at Staples was a depressing and degrading experience, and it was impossible to spark any sort of ambition when I held my job there.  I'd work pretty much anywhere else before I thought about Staples again. If you're working as a technician, then are you worth much more than you're being paid for. You deserve more respect as well. If you're not sure that you'd be successful running a business of your own, then find a job anywhere else in the meantime.

Unless your career goals are selling more market baskets.  Unfortunately for them, the number of Staples stores closing far exceeds the number being opened...a trend which will surely continue."

Staples,3c6jz1,markevens,5,Sun Jul 5 14:04:25 2015 UTC,"As someone who quit and started my own business, it is not nearly as easy as you make it out to be.    Sure, you can create an assumed business name, print some business cards, open a bank account and ""officially"" have a business, but that isn't really starting a business.    I built up my own clientele on the side for over a year before building my shop.  It is a LOT of work and the onsite-only tech world is full of unprofessional hacks you will be associated with.  It also never brought enough reliable work for me to quit staples and rely on that.   Opening my own shop was even more work, and even though I had most of the equipment to open the shop, it still took over $10,000 in capital to get the shop up and running.    That said, if someone is in position to do it, the go fucking do it.  It is a lot of work, but working for yourself is vastly more satisfying than working for staples.  Yes, it takes more work than it would at staples, but it is work I've been happy to do.    It isn't easy though.  Make no bones about that."

I mean, their brand new laptops and computers were fairly priced much less than Staples and so were their services, but still.  I've just felt not hopeful about it and given up.

Admittedly, I was hired as tech sales, but I just find I'm constantly being shit on for not selling well, and at the same time never given any advice to improve. It's always problems with this company, never solutions, and the relationship is completely take-take-take.  Hell, I did a 5 minute fix for a customer today. Absolutely dead simple just made a stupid typo type problem.  I was told I should've taken it in for our $80.00 diagnostic. I understand I'm hired to do good by Otis, but that's just obscene. I intend to start doing it though, let's see how our tech likes explaining someone paid $80 because of a small, small mistake, and it's non-refundable.  Ugggh. Honestly, it's the lack of support that kills me. Everyone has time to berate me or criticize me, but nobody finds the time to offer training or coaching. I'm always given ""I'm too busy."" ""That'll have to wait."" and I've never once been paid out for doing the epk's.  Sorry, but I read your situation and it seems a lot like what I'm encountering, with some minor details changed."
Staples,3c5z8r,s_webermanjensen,8,Sun Jul 5 04:19:35 2015 UTC,"We are told by managers, straight up, not to even turn a customers computer on. If they bring it in, you book a diagnostic, period, no help, no answers, nothing. So when I have situations like where someone's wifi wasn't working, and all it was was they just hit the wifi button on the KB and didnt realize it because they are a geriatric and don't udnerstand technology, a fix that took me literally 10 seconds, I was chewed out. This is ""wrong"" according to the managers, and is treated as pretty substantial infraction.    Charging them $50 and making them wait 2-3 business days is such good service in that situation right? Fuck this company. They actually think they are fooling people."
Staples,3c5z8r,s_webermanjensen,3,Sun Jul 5 04:40:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it just feels to me like there's no pretense of honesty in this work. Everything official says not to screw them, to make the customer happy, but that just doesn't carry down in practice.  I'm seriously considering leaving, but I can't go back to McDonald's. It's just not something I can mentally do - and there's nowhere I could feasibly get that allows me even the minor exercise of my talents with technology.  It's painful, I want to do well at the job on a Spongebob-type level, but I've been learning in a vacuum for 3 years and am clearly shit at it. It's kind of crushing."
Staples,3c5z8r,s_webermanjensen,2,Sun Jul 5 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"McDonalds is way easier mentally than this. There is no pressure, Just don't steal from the register or do anything else illegal and they never talk to you. You can fuck up people's food constantly and the managers laugh it off because they don't even need to pretend to have any sense of service since it's shitty fast food."

Staples,3c5z8r,s_webermanjensen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:09:55 2015 UTC,"Allegedly because they figured the holidays are slow and the guy who was supposed to do the deposit was lazy.  Coincidentally, he also happened to be the same guy who decided to take the deposit as his... holiday bonus?"
Staples,3c5z8r,staplesmanager,3,Tue Jul 7 05:32:36 2015 UTC,"That is ridiculous and one of the major problems being complained about on here. There is no consistency throughout the company, regions, and districts. Without good management and support from corporate, these types of complaints are a regular occurrence and it sucks how quickly this company is degrading. My management does a good job to let the techs run their own show, and they succeed in response. We are given hours behind the counter to get work done and make sure the customer is taken care of. I'm hoping Staples either gets rid of the tech counter entirely or finally realizes the majority of their stores are being handled terribly."
Staples,3c5z8r,staplesmanager,2,Sun Jul 5 05:24:57 2015 UTC,"What makes this more infuriating, is now regular customers, who used to be able to get quick fixes for free, because they were quick, now complain because I have to book them, so they complain. So it gets back to me as my fault, but it would also get back to me if I did the quick fix. It's lose lose for the staff, and they want nothing to do with it so they all leave. And of course, since now we all have to compete with sales, nobody ever has anyone's back. The turnover in my store is so high I'm now one of the most senior employees after only 2.5 years, but when I started, almost everyone had been there for 3+ years, only two of whom are still with the company."

Staples,3c5z8r,staplesmanager,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:54:21 2015 UTC,"Well, you shouldn't make them wait two days ideally, but you still shouldn't do it for free. The reality is that they need to get it done somewhere- if not you then they'll pay someone else to do it. Second of all, just because it's easy for you, doesn't mean it's easy for them. If they find the value fair, then do it. If you go to a mechanic, and you just need your wheels rotated....that's something easy to do...but you're gonna pay for it and don't expect the mechanic to to it for free"
Staples,3c5z8r,kirashi3,2,Mon Jul 6 12:24:20 2015 UTC,"It takes a matter of seconds, if I charged them money they would have come back fuming. And are you fucking high? A wheel rotation at least requires a modicum of time and equipment, hitting the wifi button is literally PUSHING A BUTTON."
Staples,3c5z8r,kirashi3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:06:29 2015 UTC,why would they come back fuming? tell them your tech can fix it but the cost will be 25$ and it'll be ready in a few hours. While you have their comp- fix the issue and then check out their computer and do a free diag on it and let them know what you found- if you found malware or spyware or failing hard drive or whatever. if you did- opportunity to upsell. if not- then their thing is fixed and they're happy knowing they also got a free diag on their pc . don't fix it in front of them.
Staples,3c5z8r,staplesmanager,0,Mon Jul 6 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"and again, either they'll spend a few hours on their own googling it, or they'll pay someone else to do it. if you both agree to the price, who cares if if takes you 10 seconds?"
Staples,3c5z8r,dr_xadium,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:50:44 2015 UTC,"Because it's a complete and total ripoff? I don;t agree to the price because I don;t agree with taking advantage of someone when you fucks tell us all that matters is offering them good service. Either drop the fucking pretence about giving a shit at all, or stop screwing your customers with overvalued, shit services.   It's a fix that requires no time investment and no skill whatsoever. I became a tech with no computer knowledge at all and I could still figure that shit out, this is the most basic of basic here, and if you really think it's okay to misrepresent it that way and use this as a springboard to start selling them things they don't need, you are 100% part of the problem with this company.   I don't know why you idiots watched Futureshop die and then decided you should adopt the worst elements of their business model, but if it didn't work for them, it's not going to for you. It's just going to drive customers online to Amazon or out of stores and into Walmart, because if our service gets as poor as theirs, we can no longer compete since they undercut on prices. Your mentality is a cancer."
Staples,3c5z8r,dr_xadium,2,Mon Jul 6 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate your frustration here, I will have to say this escalated quickly. I'm pretty close to our, or rather what's left of our Divisional Sales Manager. (Yes, he's alive and well. Just away from work.) In fact, he lives not five minutes from me, and I've flipped his quad by mistake before. We're good pals both inside and out of work.  I tell you this because he half broke down one day after being reamed out for poor sales numbers during one of the slowest weeks I have ever seen in my tenure at our store. He flat out said that he feels there's so much pressure on him dripping down the vines that he doesn't know what other contests, staff events, or customer promotions we can drum up to positively impact our numbers. And I feel for him, even when he has to be hard on those who don't meet their [removed: absurd] daily sales goals. I would wager a guess that /u/staplesmanager doesn't deserve being called derogatory terms, but I digress. This isn't why I posted here.  If your management treats your store like it was their home, but seems to poop everywhere instead of laying down a foundation of kitty litter, it's probably because those higher up the pipe ran out of kitty litter to give. Horrible analogy, but I hope you get what I'm saying.  Staples, like any other business, is here to make money. In order to make money you have to have a product or service that attracts customers. Once customers have made their purchase, you have to deliver excellent service in order to make them satisfied with their purchase. This is the breaking point where someone will decide between online or brick and mortar purchasing. If the service is poor, the only thing left is price, and we all know who has the better pricing..."
Staples,3c5z8r,staplesmanager,2,Tue Jul 7 02:37:25 2015 UTC,"i'm not a fan of much of what staples is doing, but your DSM is right- there is ton of pressure all the time, with the DM always asking ""so...i see you guys had a good week...what was different about it"" and you just want to stare at them and say...""uhhhh. we had actual customers come in?""   Which is why I don't believe in ""daily sales goals"". Honestly all it is is a chronic demotivator. rather I believe in ASP%. If you're having a slow week or slow month or slow period, but your ECP and ASP% are high up there, that's all you can do. If your sales are in the toilet but so is your ASP, then yeah- that's a huge major problem.   Also service- everyone has to be one point every.single.time. this is what drives repeat business, word of mouth, going above and beyond for the customer, and will make them deal with us rather than competitors or differentiators."
Staples,3c5z8r,kirashi3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:12:49 2015 UTC,"Even though I'm moving on in my career to follow my creative roots, I still root for managers (guessing based on username) like yourself and my own DSM on leave. We've got goals, we've got targets, but at the end of the day, we have to provide customers with excellent service and motivate our stores' team in a positive manner.  Like the famous Canadian Red Green has always said:   Remember, I'm pulling for you. We're all in this together."
Staples,3c5z8r,canadiansalesguy,2,Tue Jul 7 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"The new tech services initiative in our district is supposed to standardize both costs for services, and wait times, which are listed as 2-3 days as a standard practice. The services managers and supervisors are supposed to call with updates on tickets every 48 hours, even if they have no idea what they're talking about because they haven't been properly trained in tech services.  I'm all for making money, and personally am totally on board with the ""no touchy"" on the tech desk. This limits our liability for performing fixes ""off the books"" for whatever cost we see fit. Should we break something there's no documentation for a tech counter quick fix.  On the other hand, it's more than slightly [removed: idiotic] to charge $99 Care+ if the machine is older than 5-8 years, depending on hardware spec, and the customer thinks it's failing hardware. 67% of the time myself or whomever is the actual tech at the time talk the customer into a newer, up to date PC (or Mac).   We know it's more ethical for the customer when another part could fail shortly after replacing bad RAM. Don't read this wrong though: we definitely give them the choice of doing a Complete Care or motherboard replacement. Once they hear the cost compared to the benefits of a new PC, they've made up their own minds. (I've been with the company 5 years, and if I were to actually calculate all the repairs over that time, I'm willing to bet money I'd be close to my 67% ballpark figure.)  I use your value example almost every day, especially when people wonder with awestruck face just how it is we know what we know. You value our technical knowledge, which we gained with our own time at home or school, so you pay for it. Most customers totally get it after that, and those that don't... Well... They know where the door is and I know where to put my foot down."
Staples,3c5z8r,staplesmanager,2,Tue Jul 7 02:25:19 2015 UTC,"yeah if they are rocking an older computer with failed hdd, perse, we give them the option of the 300$ fix. [complete care, new hdd, backup, etc] or new computer with setup and data transfer, which they almost always get.  and while the ""literally 10 seconds"" fix does happen, usually that's rare. it's more like a 3 minute, or a 5 minute, or a 10 minute fix. and while they're tied up doing the fix, there's someone pissed off in ink not getting help. but these people come in and say that they want us to help them set up their email. or create an apple id. or install their microsoft office, or whatever, or they don't know how to do certain things on their device.   these are services we offer, and the money adds up. 20$ a day in free tech work results in 500$ in lost sales a month. That's significant for a lot of store, especially when again, the customer doesn't mind paying and sees value there."

Staples,3c5en5,bopisalert,6,Sat Jul 4 23:34:32 2015 UTC,"You can't be scheduled over 25. You can't average 30 or above. A manager Can push an associate past 25 if needed, but it is the manager's responsibility to ensure the associate does not exceed allowed hours. As long as you make them aware you are already at 27.5 hours, then you have nothing to worry about. You're just doing what you're told."
Staples,3c5en5,StaplesArbitor,5,Sat Jul 4 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"This question is always asked and the answer should always be - No you shouldn't get in trouble.  If you're scheduled or asked to work over 25 hours then how would you be in trouble.  If you just work as long as you feel like and an MOD says you need to clock out on time but you're like ""Fuck that, I'm about to make more $$$ happen in my bank account bitch!""  Then yeah you should be in trouble.  It's up to the GM to track the hours and ask the DM for permission to go over."

Staples,3c5en5,OldWeirdPro,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:40:04 2015 UTC,"Exceptions to the 25-hour limit can be made by the DM once they get approval from the RVP. Will you get in trouble? Not if you document with physical evidence that you were scheduled to work over 25 hours by management. No evidence? Yes, you can be disciplined. Make a copy of the schedule for your own sake. You can no longer trust anyone at Staples."

Staples,3c42oy,sAnitySCREAMS,3,Sun Jul 5 06:24:03 2015 UTC,"Happy? HAPPY?! You listen here as I tell you about MY Fourth of July.  It's the Fourth of July. I work in a town with TWO Staples. One of them is a Tier 3 Store. It's closed. I work at the Tier 4 Store. It's open. What the fuck? So, I go in at 1030. I'm short staffed because I have an EasyTech that thinks it's perfectly acceptable to tell me 4 days after I post the schedule he needs the 4th off. Does he try to work it out with other techs? No. Does my GM do anything no. Supper. Oh, another bad employee who was hired before I was promoted this store tried to swap shifts with my awesome OS associate who can do tags and she can't? Shit, no, let me phone him up and get him in here with me all day. F payroll, I guess.  First customer of the day pulls into the parking lot before open and starts shouting at me through the window to know what time we open. Oh boy.  Store opens, and it's me, the Manager starring as Cashier. OS Associate starring as OS/Furniture/EasyTech/Everything Else, and one CPC associate.  Woman is unhappy with how the product she bought is remanufactured and wants me to take a piece from a completely different product and just give it to her. Nope nope nope. She doesn't want to return her product or exchange it, or order the piece she wants from Staples.com. How dare I charge her that? So, she demands the corporate phone number. No doubt to explain how unreasonable I was by offering to exchange the item, or help her order and pay for what she wanted rather than basically damage another product by stealing an essential piece and giving it to her for free.  Super busy day, do regular amount of Saturday sales in the 11 - 5 window. Hate every customer that comes in that day and will be the reason I have to be there again next year even though the GM is salaried and his ass is supposed to be in the store because he is on a Salary and he doesn't come out of store Payroll like I do. F dis shit.  2PM a tech rolls into the store! Yay! Things looking better! 2:30... Where is the cashier who swapped with my OS associate? 2:40 ""Hey, I'm running late."" ""How late? When will you be here?"" ""3PM."" 3 PM rolls around. Cashier no show. 3:30 cashier walks in like it aint nothing.Totes cool to be late as fuck and whatevs. This is what happens when things are too lax at a store and then you get dropped into the middle of it and are expected to fix it without having full support of the GM, or whatevs.  Give cashier final warning because this most definitely not the first time something like this has happened. Cashier grabs her stuff and walks out without telling anyone, and we don't notice for 10 minutes. Shit. Fuck. Scramble to get the registers covered. Thank god my tech was ringing people up so we didn't have a super long line. We thought she went to the bathroom or something. Nope, car is gone, head set is abandoned at the register. Great, well, as least we won't have to pay the Unemployment claims.  Want to leave at 5PM when we close. Make sure everyone is ready to go. All associates give green light. Customer walks in at 4:50PM and makes camp in CPC center. Stays until 5:20PM. Cry. Cry so many. Just want to leave and begin my one week vacation. God hears my prayers. Says ""Fuck you."" Lightning strikes builder and the alarm goes off. All alarm panels tell me every fucking sensor is giving an alert. AFA is like ""lol oh well can't find a technician its' fourth of july bby u screwed.""  FFFFFFUUUUUUU.  Customer leaves and complains about alarm noise. Lightning strikes building again. Lose power.  Kill me. Please....  Send staff home and get ahold of Full Time Ops Sup from other store to come help me watch the store.  DM and LPM are both on Vacation. Call the guy listed on LPMs list of people to call in case of emergency. Voice mail. FFFFUUUUUU Call their boss and my previous LPM. He answers, and scrambles to a security guard to watch the store. On phone with SFLPM when suddenly leaks. Leaks everywhere in the fucking store. WTF I just had a roofer come out to fix all these leaks, but he showed up on my day off. I showed all key holders where all the leaks were so they could show the roofer. SHIET.  ""If we can't get ahold of guard and they can't get a technician out there to fix your alarm then you will have to stay at the store all night until the opening staff shows up in the morning. ""  OK, time to go lick the circuit breaker and end it all.  Guard finally shows to watch the store all night so I can leave. 9PM.  10:30AM to 9PM Fourth of July. No lunch break. Murder the FUCK out of my payroll. Yeah, fuck you payrolll, don't come round these parts no more.  Have to go back at 10AM Sunday to make sure power was restored by the power company and the store can open. Explain to opening staff what happened. Have to go back on Monday, on my week off, and make sure GM/Payroll put my hours in properly. Have to call HR/Payroll to have this associate from the other store properly clocked in at my store for helping me.  Cry. Cry and wish this demon would let go of me for one week at least. Still want to be promoted to GM. Staples Masochist maybe? Want my own store.   So, yeah, totally ""Happy"" Fourth of July.  At least my paycheck will look decent."

How MANY GM's have you personally worked for...25, 50, 75, 200 GM's?

Staples,3c3tby,WhateverItTakes10x,0,Sun Jul 5 04:39:40 2015 UTC,"First I did not say ALL managers, did not say MOST mangers, I said MANY mangers  (and i wrote MANY in caps to prevent the retarded comments), (it's like saying many politicians are dishonest) although now I think you are an idiot (and a retard) , i will not call you an idiot (and a retard), because I have standards, and I will try to fully respect you 2-you don't know me, you don't know my story, you don't know how many   managers i worked with, you can only ASSUME. 3-any manager at a DISHONEST ethicless organization such as Staples is  ""likely"" (not always) to be dishonest and a lair, Staples USED to be an honest ethical organization,  focusing on matching the customer needs and respecting it's employees, and only honest managers were able to keep their jobs. But now Staples is all about scamming customers into buying high margin services, and disrespecting/overworking/underpaying their employees, usually no honest employee can get promoted and usually no honest manager can keep his/her job for long. for example, honest employee can't get too many digital-receipts, EPP's, tech services ..etc (unless you are LYING TO YOURSELF by thinking you are helping the customers, not scamming/misleading/over-pressuring them) A staples manager has to be able to underpay and overwork his/her employees, keep them stressed and  on their toes, take advantage of them  and encourage them to produce NUMBERS dishonestly ...peace, love and respect <3 love you man (no homo)"

Staples,3c3tby,operacarmen,2,Mon Jul 6 07:11:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly,depends on the GM for how willing they are to work around your schedule. What I personally recommend though after seeing this with other students in CPC is to not go for Supervisor while in school unless you really need the money. The combined stress of school/supervisor will get to you, especially during finals (your finals + people's last minute poster projects/bindings) and this gets worse if you are given/made a keyholder. Especially since it looks like the store is short-staffed in CPC, chances are you may not get the backup you need (from other supervisors or associates because everyone sees CPC as a scary place). Most of the responsibilities are to manage your supplies, keep a track of your CopySat, numbers, try to push more jobs to DCS, etc (normal stuff you likely were doing anyway + a few managery stuff)"
Staples,3c3tby,WorktheMoo,2,Sun Jul 5 02:02:01 2015 UTC,"It's a full time position with more pay and more responsibility of course.  You'll be responsible for ordering CPC supplies, accountable for CPC numbers which you'll speak to in weekly conference calls.  If you were offered the position you should let your GM know about your plans for school.  If they already know this then your good.  Personally I think you're a very brave person for even contemplating working more hours in CPC those customers are crazy."

A tip I found out by reading the quick reference sheet (gasp!) for this model (my previous store had a new model of tellermate and that's where I learned this tip) is to hit the ""wrap"" button on the machine.

Bottom line is that even if you can do something, it doesn't mean you should... you know already that Staples isn't in the business of giving away free tablets, but you chose to work the system anyways. You are wrong here. LP may give you a slap on the wrist, considering the system took the coupons, but you will forever be questioned for your ethics.  We have an associate who did the same thing, multiple times last week, and we're working with LP and HR on a resolution. As a manager, it makes it difficult to trust this person now, and I risk losing a great employee, all over some shitty tablets that aren't worth a damn anyways. It sucks.  So if you get through this with your job, I'd start looking anyways, because you'll be in an awkward spot, and you will not be trusted.   These coupon deals happen a few times a year... it's a problem at corporate. LP doesn't talk to marketing, who doesn't talk to the interns who create the coupons, and we all lose.... so next time folks, if it's too good to be true, stay away from it!"
Staples,3c0pqt,Kal-ElofKrypton,2,Sat Jul 4 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your opinion, although that is certainly how LP will view it. When I buy something from Staples, I'm a customer. When I sell something, I'm an employee. That's the line I draw. If LP has a problem with the transaction that occurred, they should be talking to the associate who checked you out on the register, not the CUSTOMER who bought it. If this was approved by the GM, that is now the GMs responsibility for any fallout regarding the transaction."

This particular tablet was not status clearance online.  In fact this coupon required a manager over ride to work on the Toshiba tablet.  When the override popped up, our store contacted LP, they said no way and we confirmed same story with DM because it was not deemed clearance status online.  Think about it...how many items are clearance status in the store (furniture) but higher in price online.  Whoever keyed their numbers in to do the override should also be reprimanded...going to prove that common sense should be considered a super power."

The shit flows downhill but it never ends up in corporate."

Staples,3bz2vb,Kal-ElofKrypton,3,Fri Jul 3 09:46:53 2015 UTC,"When I was still with Staples, I always suggested Sophos with the TS options. Not necessarily because it was better than Kaspersky, but because it wasn't available on shelves and is, at the end of the day, a ""corporate grade"" antivirus that you can't just go and ""get"" from anywhere without a contract. It just had better selling points to mention to customers on the fence about everything. If customers were really curious about the options we had, I'd always mention Kaspersky had the ""internet security"" package related stuff that Sophos wouldn't.  Either way though, the antivirus you get really isn't the main selling point of the package (Assuming Virus Shield is like TS/POM/OGSophos), the service aspect is. It doesn't matter how good their antivirus is, nothing is going to stop the average computer illiterate customer from downloading ""Firefox"" off the ads that pop up when they search it lol. The fact that they get an Antivirus with the guarantee is a bonus, not a main selling point."

That email includes a link to send them a copy of your receipt so you don't need it - should you ever need to make a claim they'll have it on file for you.  That link takes you to a page with instructions on scanning and submitting said receipt.  However, IF they have a digital receipt, that email and web page tells you how to send them a copy via EMAIL.    I received this email on March 26, exactly 7 days after my purchase: Imgur"
Staples,3bxe4s,OldOnliner,0,Fri Jul 3 01:38:41 2015 UTC,You have to create an account the first time it isn't automatic you must go to SquareTrade.com/staples after you have an account as long as you use your rewards card at checkout they will auto register
Staples,3bxe4s,eternistarr,0,Fri Jul 3 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"Nothing about registering Square Trade is automatic except that Staples emails you if you have a rewards card. The email is a reminder to register your plan. Every single plan I've purchased Square Trade has required me to send a receipt and register manually.  Also, the 2 day guarantee is a fucking sham. They've had my Nexus 7 for 3 weeks now because ""Parts are on Backorder"" and refuse to cash out the device since ""repairs are being done""."
Staples,3bxe4s,im_sn0w,2,Fri Jul 3 03:51:08 2015 UTC,"The 2 say guarantee is for the cost of the plan, not the tablet. They will still fix it, but they should refund the plan price."

Staples,3bw7tj,StaplesDrone9595,8,Thu Jul 2 17:38:00 2015 UTC,Likely an external GM hire and they just wanted him to get acquainted with the store and Staples in general first.
Staples,3bw7tj,gravitykill,2,Thu Jul 2 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"almost certainly this. I seem to remember that managers have to be acquainted with the cell phone system.   no doubt it was weird, and looked weird, but that's staples for you..."

Staples,3bw7tj,figjam13,2,Fri Jul 3 03:30:14 2015 UTC,"Did you report it to a manager in store? If they haven't done anything, the next step is to report it to HR. Make it very clear it's unacceptable behavior when you talk to HR and it should get taken care of immediately."

Staples,3bz5ab,OldOnliner,5,Fri Jul 3 11:35:24 2015 UTC,"Intel and Nvidia have the only legitimate automatic programs that I can think of for driver identification and update.

Staples,3bz5ab,easytech10,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"dev.id.info was good for finding out what driver you needed for those ""unknown"" ones, you'd right click the properties of the unknown device in device manager , g to details and then hardware IDs and paste in the PCI vendor string (you could use pcidatabase.com but it took longer) (they look like PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_15A1&SUBSYS_15A11849&REV_05 ) and it would tell you want drivers to get and offer a download. Nowadays I wouldn't download from them unless it was an emergency (they have gotten shady) but googling the hardware ID can help you figure out the driver you need."

Staples,3bw49r,FaxForRA,6,Thu Jul 2 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"Not sure these days, but 4 years ago when I took it, it was comparable to the A+ cert test. Had to know some pretty in depth stuff, which pin outs on an IDE cable is the ground, bandwidth for different interfaces, etc."
Staples,3bw49r,gravitykill,2,Thu Jul 2 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"IDE cable?  That was a while ago, I took one 4 years ago and it was easy, no where near the A+ test it didn't even have the POST beep codes."

Staples,3bw49r,ManOfDrinks,6,Thu Jul 2 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"To echo what others have said. I took it 4 years ago and it was basically the A+ test. So pretty basic stuff overall. Really if you're younger you should probably brush up on things you wouldn't see too often anymore like IDE drives, SDRAM contact counts etc. mostly useless knowledge but it's on the test so I'd recommend reading up.  Specifics I remember are like  1) what is a worm? 2) what tcp port is commonly used for internet connectivity? 3) what common connections do printers use? 4) troubleshooting logic questions like the monitor is not displaying and image but it on, what steps would you take first?  It's a pretty basic test and is desperate need of an update. Most of what's in it IMO is useless in today's world."
Staples,3bw49r,Icantbebigwill,3,Thu Jul 2 21:20:20 2015 UTC,It's basically A+.It asked alot of questions about hardware but there was a few about things like virus removal and how to navigate windows.

A few acronyms in regards to hardware, and you'll also be asked something about different radio bands for dispatch radios which is fucking weird.  One of the questions asks about RAM requirements for a certain Windows version install, I forget which it was but it was one of the Vista editions. Definitely something to touch up on before you take it.  Easy stuff, not even A+ level. There was nothing about IDE on mine, nor was there anything about SATA or SCSI."

Staples,3bw49r,liquidpixel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"Check this out it goes like this: they'll ask some random questions you may or may not know the answer to. Either way it's fairly short and the REAL test is how fast can you Google search - I'm real serious about that, when you actually fix machines it can be helpful to just search for the fix to the problem so you don't have to resort to ""sorry needs a full restore"" or ""pay us in full for VR (when it's just one file)"". You can get a lot more tech sales when you ACTUALLY know tech, and you are much more knowledgeable when you can quickly deduce the problem WITH the solution.   TL; DR Take it with Google open in the next tab and you literally can't fail it"
Staples,3bw49r,chi7891,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:25:42 2015 UTC,The one I took last year was similar to the A+ test I think

Staples,3bvora,Kal-ElofKrypton,2,Thu Jul 2 20:53:12 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify a bit on fraternizing.... you can hang out and/or date people on the same level as you. There cannot be any authority one holds over the other.   Example  -  a Sales Manager at a T3 store has no one on the same level as them. They report to a GM, and everyone else in the store is subordinate to them.  In a T2 Store, that SM also has an Operations Manager, who is the only other person in the store on equal footing. The SM can only fraternize with the OM.   If you are a Tech Sup, you can hang out with your Ops and CPC sups, and Team Sup if you have one. GM'S can't hang out with anyone in their own store - only GM'S from other stores.  Hope that clears it up."

There are two major things that cause a store to close, rent and profit.  A lot of the stores that they closed were stores opened to block the expansion of competitors.  When we one the retail office battle they had no plan on what to do with all those leased properties.  That's what was told to my GM when my last store closed.  We were a stand alone in between two higher volume stores and we couldn't hit the 6 million mark.  A few years ago when they started the BOSS products they had a mock up of a Staples store on the HUB that looked like Target, it had aisles of food products and I remember thinking ""The name Staples is about to mean ""Staple items for everyday living"".  For low volume stores it all depends on the rent, that's why I say ""may have a problem"""

I will give my customers a 75 mile radius from my store to find one in stock (if the price is in store only, even if it crosses a state border)"
Staples,3btc9h,operacarmen,3,Thu Jul 2 14:37:38 2015 UTC,"Staples price–match guarantee:  How does Staples’ price–match guarantee work? If you find a lower price on a new identical item, just show us the lower price when you  buy the item at Staples and we will match the price, or within 14 days of your Staples purchase and we will give you the difference (see full  policy below for details).  Which competitors will Staples price match?  Staples retail stores will price match prices at brick–n–mortar retail stores and at Staples.com.  Staples.com will price match prices at select competitors' websites and Staples' retail stores. These select competitors are: Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Office Depot, Office Max, Quill, Medical Arts Press, Reliable, Sam's Club, Wal–mart, WB Mason and Xerox. Items must be sold and shipped by one of these competitors.  Which items does Staples price match? Almost everything we sell. The item must be identical, including model number, components and U.S. warranty. The item must be in stock and available for purchase at that price from an authorized U.S. reseller, whose authorization we reserve the right to verify. For wireless phones and other items with a service plan, only in–store purchases are eligible for price match. The plan, provider and other terms must be the same. Products and services purchased online at our Mobile Phone sales & service site are not eligible for price match.  Which items and services aren’t available for price match? We don’t price match to competitor or our own local or special events (e.g. grand opening, anniversary, clearance or liquidation sales).  We also don't price match: our Staples® EasyTechSM services.  We don't price match items sold on auction sites; taxes and typographical errors; and gift cards, gift checks, or merchandise credits.  How do Staples coupons and rebates contribute to the Staples price?  All coupons and rebates (including Easy Rebates, instant rebates or savings, and Staples or manufacturer mail–in rebates) are deducted from the price of the Staples product when calculating a price match.  Will Staples match a competitor's  price for a product where the competitor also offers and instant rebate, mail–in rebate, gift check or gift card, or free or discounted item?  If a competitor offers a product that comes with an instant rebate, mail–in rebate, gift check or gift card, or similar discounts, we will only match the price you pay at the point of purchase and will not take such discounts into account. If a competitor offers a product that comes with a free or discounted item and Staples does not carry the free or discounted item and Staples does not carry the free or discounted item, we will only match the price you pay at the point of purchase and will not take the free or discounted item into account.  Are delivery charges included in the price match?  It will depend on whether your Staples.com order received free shipping, and whether the competitor offers free shipping.  If your Staples.com order received free shipping and the competitor offers free shipping, we will price match the product without considering shipping charges. If your Staples.com order received for free shipping and the competitor does not offer free shipping, we will include an appropriate shipping charge in the competitor's price before price matching.  If your Staples.com order did not receive free shipping and the competitor offers free shipping but the product does not qualify for such free shipping, or the competitor does offer free shipping, we will include shipping charges on both products before price matching.  Are quantities limited on price–matched products?  We may limit the quantities of price–matched items, particularly if the other company does. In addition, we reserve the right to limit quantities sold to a customer.  Policy information is available by calling 1–800–333–3330. For a price match, see customer service desk in store or call 1–800–333–3330. This policy is subject to change without notice."

Staples,3btc9h,Stpls,2,Thu Jul 2 00:18:00 2015 UTC,The policy used to state that it had to be in stock and  nearby. In an effort to promote quick customer service I believe it is now just any company with a brick and mortar. You do not have to verify stock.

Staples,3btc9h,FaxForRA,9,Thu Jul 2 00:17:32 2015 UTC,"I did it didn't really answer that question. If I were to read it literally then I could price match products in Germany because the policy states ""Staples will price match items sold by ANY retailer who sells products in both retail stores and online under the same brand"" (capitalization mine).

Staples,3btqhi,venturer95,-1,Thu Jul 2 02:11:26 2015 UTC,"Im the tech Supp at my store, I have actually managed to give us a sizable boost in ESP by training all my associates to talk up the ST on cables.   My pitch is that I can pretty much guarentee that no matter what cable you buy, it will break within two years. Sadly that is just how it is. But if you purchase this warranty for $5, you will get a replacement or a refund within those two years. And as a staples rewards member, the warranty is already registered for you. So instead of paying $20 in a year for another new cable, let's just pay $5 now.  Because of how cheap the warranty is, customers eat it up and we get a lot of ST this way."

Staples,3br91w,easytechwtf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:16:54 2015 UTC,That nonsense has no place in stores. HDD replacement takes a maximum of 5 minutes. RAM replacement maybe 2 mins max including getting the computer open. Quick $30 to add to budget for the week. Software installs are something I've been doing in mass quantities lately and is helping me single-handedly do 150-200% to budget. I'm the only tech at my store and have to do sales/stocking/tech work/everything else and bring in around $2k per week tech sales. Mostly Diag/repair with 2yr VS+ makes it easy at $320 a computer. Classic shell is what I'm telling people who have windows 8 that I can put on to make it much easier for them to use their computer and explain it a bit and they practically throw their $30 at me. Then attach a tune up or something of the sort and you've got yourself a $60 service for a few mins of work and no Matrix bs.
Staples,3br91w,Bomerica,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"This all goes back to the premise that Staples does not want you to make budget or be profitable. All they want to do is close stores.

Staples,3bpd4u,chi7891,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:50:58 2015 UTC,Either there are no guidelines present (xx amount on PL means closure is likely) or they have no idea how to interpret it correctly and or don't check it often enough due to the other various metrics they have to keep track of on an hourly basis.
Staples,3bpd4u,fullmetalturtle,4,Wed Jul 1 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"Dude, it sucks your store is closing and I'm not picking on you, but if the GM was blindsided it's their fault, the data is there and takes 5 minutes to look at once a month.    You'd be amazed in talking with GMs how few are able to read/react to the P&L.  What's even worse is how many think that hitting top line sales budget or hitting sales comp means that everything is alright even though their Retail Scorecard shows their Operating Profit Rate is a negative number.  The root cause of this is that Staples is putting people in the GM role that have no business being in it.    Then throw in that the District Managers don't actually teach them anything beyond responding to the flavor of the week.  The guidelines are pretty damn simple, it is actually the same at every For Profit business.  You need to be profitable and preferably hitting your profit goal.  Your P&L has a line on the second page titled Operating Profit, it shows actual, budget, both for the period and year.  My main point:  Use the data, and if your GM isn't sharing the data, ask for it.  If he doesn't know the data then get out fast."

Except in some states where vacation time is considered a part of your wages and negotiated at hiring, you may have to pay back that time taken as it is accrued throughout the year and not fully earned until the end of the fiscal year.   For example, and just for the sake of argument, you may only have earned 3 days vacation at this point, but you can borrow two more days that would be accrued through the end of the year. If you took vacation now and then quit, you would have to pay back those two days."

Staples,3bnqnp,staplesthrowaway666,5,Tue Jun 30 19:47:56 2015 UTC,No as your employment is at Staples as a whole- not by individual store.
Staples,3bnqnp,Stpls,2,Tue Jun 30 18:27:08 2015 UTC,There will be times every so often that a store might borrow another associate (usually happens with CPC/EasyTech more often than other associate types) but usually that is for emergencies and not actual split employment. Also some stores are really finicky about transfers (or hold them up so it takes forever)
Staples,3bnqnp,WorktheMoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:15:42 2015 UTC,Can't work more than 25 hours or else Staples has to pay Obamacare tax. So no.

I still was held to 25 hours a week so it wasn't a benefit for me except that I remained with my current store's payroll and was paid out the full CPC bonus at the end of the fiscal year.  But the answer is no, you can't be hired twice (e.g. two paychecks, two emp ids, etc)"
Staples,3bnzfq,drdokatz,8,Tue Jun 30 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"Break it into three pieces and sell it that way, emphasizing each part based on what they tell you. If they're replacing their old machine because of damage, or mention grandkids or dorm roommates or any kind of travel in general, start with Square Trade. It used to be easier to sell ST when it included a replacement battery, because that's about a hundred bucks right there. (If they mention their homeowner's insurance, tout the ease of a ST claim, how there's no deductible, how the purchase is tied right to their awards account in case of lost receipts/misplaced product info, etc. [and this is a great time to tell them about Rewards, if they're not members] and how fast it is in comparison to a homeowner's claim.)  Virus Shield Plus - total no-brainer. Top-notch AV with a virus removal guarantee. Mention a few of the higher-priced AV on the shelf and mention how they don't get free VR with those. This is the first time I use real dollar amounts - I say exactly how much the boxed AV is, and how much a Diag&Repair is. Tell them about how much it pains you to see the same customers in two and three times a year for virus removal at $160 a pop, when VS+ could have saved them all that time and money and, possibly, their identity security.  Then I start talking about what a pain in the ass an 8 machine is to set-up - how sometimes updates can conflict with other updates, and the machine comes loaded with a bunch of crapware that's just hogging resources, it's just a nightmare. People will believe ANY bad thing you say about 8.1.  Right there is when I tell them that by buying all three as a bundle under our Total Support package, it'll save them 20%. They already have the rough numbers in their heads about how expensive it is to NOT get Total Support, so saving them money on the three services they've already been convinced are good things to have is just a bonus.   There are all sorts of things you can do to customize that - for example, we got a the unofficial green light from our GM that we'll count the Win 10 upgrade as a ""software installation"", and the data backup when they upgrade to 10 would fall under the data transfer part of the setup, but I'm sure those are not Staples-sanctioned actions.   I've had pretty good luck attaching TS on my laptop sales, when I actually get a real customer."
Staples,3bnzfq,BubbleWrapLampShade,2,Tue Jun 30 20:52:12 2015 UTC,Way to long of a pitch. Keep it short and simple.
Staples,3bnzfq,eternistarr,3,Tue Jun 30 23:47:04 2015 UTC,We are 70% attach rate on all 3 services combined ytd. The long pitch works.

Staples,3bnzfq,eternistarr,2,Tue Jun 30 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"When you are selling TS keep it short and simple, sneak it in customers will usually give you an in thought your conversation. So they bring up damage or failure so introduce square trade give them the price and tell them it covers what they were just talking about. Same with viruses most the time opportunity opens up for that as well. If not ask simple questions like is it going to be mobile or do you have antivirus in mind. The less options you give them the better off you will be. I've instructed my team to just sell sophos its the best of what we carry people who know little will take it and not worry people in the know will ask for other options at that time mention it. The more complicated and long you pitch gets will scare the person off. Also it helps to believe in our products. Believe it or not people want told what they want.  That's why we narrow PCs down to three and say you need this and this and this if they don't want it they will tell you no. But you always assume the sale and assume the whole sell worst they will say is no. Use the more account to your advantage so that you can attach everything that's needed. A good line I will use is yes its more up front now but its piece of mind that it will be completely covered for two years. Without it you could be back in a month paying twice as much."

Staples,3bnzfq,TechThrowAway20,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:22:40 2015 UTC,"This is the exact pitch I've always used.  If I can get them on one, I can almost always get them on all three. Simply with ""I mention this because if you get all three you get a discount, so instead of X being $Y, it's $Z."" At this point they're going ""Wow, I'm saving $80!"" when in reality you've upped them $200."
Staples,3bnzfq,crunkadocious,5,Wed Jul 1 03:39:30 2015 UTC,Focus on the tech support side. Leverage their lack of knowledge and the unfamiliarity of new computers.
Staples,3bnzfq,crunkadocious,4,Tue Jun 30 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"You can also score some points by showing that a new Norton or McAfee is already nearly 80 dollars a year. So that's 160 for two years, vs 159 for two years of virus shield. So then you just sell them on the square trade which saves them a % and nearly pays for itself!   Blech still makes me feel I'll just saying it on the internet."
Staples,3bnzfq,exile0514,3,Tue Jun 30 20:06:47 2015 UTC,"You notify the customer that they can elect to purchase squaretrade to protect their investment for 2 years for XX price with a money back guarantee 1-week repair or be stuck having to send the PC out to the manufacturer and could be without a computer for 2-3 weeks, out shipping costs and possibly get back a refurbished machine. That's it. That's all your job is required to do. I don't know why anyone would be willing to bend over backwards for a job that isn't commission based and is for the most part, scam based."
Staples,3bnzfq,easytech109,3,Wed Jul 1 00:50:53 2015 UTC,"Remember that during the first year they still have to go through manufacturer, warranty doesn't kick in until after.Better to be upfront now than have a pissed off customer in the future."
Staples,3bnzfq,exile0514,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:18:30 2015 UTC,Yea. Failure to mention this can really get your shit pushed in if a customer brings up your name and raises hell for your manager. Mention this when you're selling squaretrade and you'll never sell one. Plans is the reason why many electronic retail stores went out of buisness. Put it out there cut and dry and let them decide for themselves.
Staples,3bnzfq,easytechwtf,2,Wed Jul 1 01:27:25 2015 UTC,"If you sell VS+, Square Trade and a PC Setup you should have a coupon in your ad prep for 20% off all 3. This makes it to the point where almost one of them is free. I usually start by trying to sell the setup which is usually pretty easy because most people do not know how to transfer the data from one computer to the other and I make sure to also say that ""among many important things to get the computer up and running properly we create recovery disks for you, which used to be provided with computers but are not any longer and they help you if you need to bring the computer back to life (lol) if theres any problems."" between that and telling them we transfer their data for them no worries and install their software that is easy af. Then I move into the shield plus telling them that Kaspersky or whatever is $80 a year on the shelf and if they get the two year shield program they get kaspersky (or other) for 2 years and would be paying this much anyway but we install it and update it for you for free and also if any virus is able to get past kaspersky (or other) we can remove the virus free of charge which costs $160 so you use these methods to keep emphasizing that it pays for itself easy. Then you have them sold on the two of those and you say ""by the way since you were getting the setup and 2 years of virus shield plus we have a sale going on in which you get 20% off of each service if you get the squaretrade protection. (if they get all three (2 year basic ST, 2 year shield and setup) its $360 but with the 20% off its only $288 which means that they get the square trade for only $28 when it's regularly $100 and bam you've now sold all three services and significantly bumped up your numbers. Any questions or comments just let me know, also there are always going to be those dicks that come in and want the piece of shit celeron machines and will never buy any service or plan. Don't let that get to you. The best salesman in the world wouldn't make that happen."

Staples,3bn21k,ParanoidPerv,5,Tue Jun 30 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"On the hub, do a search for 2015 LP audit and print that out. There's a lot of things to keep track of, a good chunk of which the IS is responsible for. There are obviously some things you can't audit without permission/clearance (Cash Office, for one), but going through the check lists are an easy way to prep for an LP audit.  For safety audit, just use common sense. Boxes off of the floor and out of the way so they don't create tripping hazards. Minimize falling hazards. Ladders should be out of the way of walkways and locked down. Uboats should be off the floor if they're not being worked. Back room should be clean(ish) and have a good 36 inch opening throughout so you can navigate safely and easily. Make sure nothing is stored in the electrical room and nothing is clogging up hallways. Also, make sure the bailer is closed and the key removed. Lots of stuff like that.  Though I'm surprised. My store got a surprise LP audit and we still skated by with a few bad marks. How has your store failed three times?"
Staples,3bn21k,dark_not_evil,3,Tue Jun 30 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"Which audit? A loss prevention/safety audit?  If so things you can do as an associate are simple such as ensuring all product that needs to be alarmed (whether that's a box, spider wrap, or adhesive ""bug."" Make sure all display cases are properly locked and all doors are secured (no lockup doors left open this one's simple). You could also ask your managers what part of the audit was failed so you can help to bring your store up to standards. As far as safety, common sense like no boxes hanging over the edge of overhead storage, ladder chains closed when not in use, no wires on the floor as a tripping hazard."

Staples,3bldvm,CapeCodderGirl,3,Tue Jun 30 04:05:44 2015 UTC,"Nice topic.  If it were not for prime time and call outs / no shows, we would of had BTS set last week. We are about 97%, just a few shippers missing.  Our second BTS load was FUBAR. Pallets collapsed on the truck due to shitty loading.  (Hagerstown DC sucks btw).   Really tired of the BS. Can't task in prime time, only one OS on at night to close, and they are pulled away 75% of their shift to ring or help in ship center.  Sales have gone up, CSAT has improved, but we have not received the increase in hours that (should) accompany an increase in sales."

Staples,3bkblt,dr_xadium,2,Mon Jun 29 23:30:45 2015 UTC,I look all the time but never see one.  ASAT isn't about Staples© is about your local management — specifically the GM.   Many years ago it was slightly different and included a comment field. (Though it is possible my memory of those days is foggy.)

Staples,3bkdcq,Synnerrs,6,Tue Jun 30 00:03:07 2015 UTC,There is so much wasted space on the tech side. Cameras is one of them. We have 8 feet but sell 2 cameras. yes. 8 feet of camera plano but only 2 active cameras for it. makes no sense. It's literally just an empty shelf with 2 cardboard display boxes on it.   Hard drives is another wasted space. why the hell do we need the same hard drive on 3 shelves and 3 facings wide? That whole 16-20 feet of plastic boxes can be cut down to 4 feet extremely easily. I don't know what it is but every single office supply store I worked at (and I worked for all three companies) has sucked royally when it comes to technology.
Staples,3bkdcq,toothpick21,4,Tue Jun 30 03:34:38 2015 UTC,"that's because it's an office supply store, not a technology store."

For the longest time, our camera section had all the different cameras we used to be able to get online, so it wasn't so bad, but now there are only two we can even order so that shelf looks stupid. And while our hard drives section is huge and makes it look like we've got a lot of shit, we have yet to receive a single Seagate. Not a single one in the store, yet the whole section is nothing but Seagate boxes."

Before that I have no idea how long it was that someone wanted a camera.   The thing is....the average consumer is not using a digital camera, they are using their cell phone. And the professional photographer isn't coming in to Staples to buy/look for camera gear."

Ever since then, we've had more people than ever coming in looking for them. And what's worse is that we've sold a whopping 0 security cameras since we did the plano. It's even more useless and wasteful than it ever was before!  Realistically, we could do without 4 feet of GPS, 4 feet of PC gaming accessories that we're always out of, 8 feet of hard drive display boxes (which is half), 4 feet of Kindle displays (we have room to put them in line with the rest of tablets), and even more I'm sure. There's just so much wasted space that could be used much more wisely in my opinion."
Staples,3bkdcq,daveyjones0017,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"I won't discount the average smartphone camera now for everyday pictures, but what picks my brain is how Staples never carries any of the mid range to high end point and shoots.  I'm not asking for pro grade SLR's or Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens cameras, but models like Sonys famed RX100 (mark 1, 2, 3, or 4) or Panasonics LX100 would be wonderful once you show serious amateur photographers the difference between those and their iDevice.  We carried the Nikon ONE at ONE point (pun intended), and at our store I know we went through the 3 stock units in one summer (that's good volume for our stores camera sales). There's a reason I still go into FS (now BB) stores and that's to ogle over the mid to high end cameras."
Staples,3bitz1,AngryEMT,7,Mon Jun 29 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"It's due to the way it prompts you in the system. When you scan a computer or tablet its prompts ""custmr offrd office 365"" or something similar. It's kinda cryptic at first glance. You wanna select it and say yes, always say yes.  Edit: I did not answer your question. Last time I checked, if you hit no or cancel the customer will get a free copy of office. I would like someone else to confirm this as well. Maybe ask your manager to see what they were talking about.  If you are unsure always get your manager. In my opinion I think a manager should always be present when finishing a high ticket sale or computer sale."

Staples,3bitz1,TechMaster212,2,Tue Jun 30 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing crapbook refers to those $250 Asus netbooks that occasionally go on sale for about $180.

Staples,3bimbt,killer_chair,3,Mon Jun 29 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"XP 420 is a nice printer, but I would avoid pressurized ink systems and get something with a two cartridge system like a HP Envy or a low end officejet (61/62). The Price-per-page is awful but if you print real infrequently who cares, its worth being able to still print if you run out of color. If PPP is more important, back to pressurized, get one of the Epsons that use 252, or a HP with 950. Need more information for a good recommendation."
Staples,3bimbt,drdokatz,2,Mon Jun 29 15:17:06 2015 UTC,"What's the difference between pressurized and non-pressurized ink? Does it affect things like picture quality? Why is it cheaper per page? On a separate tangent, is Epson comparable to HP/Canon for photo/color quality? Is Brother even a contender in terms of its inkjets?"
Staples,3bimbt,Want_To_Talk,3,Mon Jun 29 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, also : pressurized ink means you can't run with an empty or missing cartridge, and with non pressurized the head is built into the cartridge.. Which means the machine tends to last longer but the price per page is usually worse... It costs more to put a head on each cartridge."
Staples,3bimbt,drdokatz,2,Tue Jun 30 03:19:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert I've just seen a lot of people and a lot of printers and broken printers... But here's my two cents. The amount of inks involved dictates the quality of the final print. So a 5 cartridge system is better than 4,and those cannons that have 6 cartridges total (black, photo black, gray, cyan magenta yellow) tend to produce the most accurate results with the most color ""pop"" where it is vibrant. But those are among the most expensive price per page. It depends on what you want out of your printer honestly. Printers and ink is generally a bad deal considering the price for what you get, but some are better than others. TLDR: 620 by Epson is better because of the photo black than the 420...but cannon is almost uncontested except for the Epson artisan series which is available online. HP is hardly competitive in photo printing anymore since the death of the photosmart . If anyone wants to chime in, please do. I'd love to hear some arguments otherwise."
Staples,3bimbt,drdokatz,2,Tue Jun 30 03:00:53 2015 UTC,No such  thing as a cheap good printer. You will get raped on ink cartridges. Actually any printer at staples will rape you on ink cartridges.
Staples,3bimbt,BallsInYourWalls,3,Mon Jun 29 15:46:21 2015 UTC,"It's an inverse relationship: and keep in mind, when you get a good quality printer for $100-$149, the manu is cutting something if it's cheaper.  Go for a brother laser if you print black and white, since it's dirt cheap to get refilled carts for, and if you need colour, go with a basic HP or Brother, but get the easycare for like $5, it'll probably come in handy."
Staples,3bimbt,s_webermanjensen,2,Mon Jun 29 17:56:07 2015 UTC,I love selling the HP 4630 and the 8630. Mostly the 8630. Cheap 4 in ones that do it all. They're on for the $15/25 SquareTrade ESPs. They're shite in durability (had a customer with one that broke in 3 months) but that's what the ESP is for.
Staples,3bimbt,chi7891,2,Mon Jun 29 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"They're usually on sale for 79 and 99, respectively."
Staples,3bimbt,chi7891,2,Mon Jun 29 22:34:43 2015 UTC,I've found the best cheep printers are brothers.   Ink costs are good too.  Monochrome laser is the best though for cost and reliability.
Staples,3bimbt,markevens,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:13:25 2015 UTC,"Pick up a cheap laser printer. I have an HP that was on sale a bit ago (the model number escapes me). As long as you don't need color, it comes with 1500+ pages and works like a charm."
Staples,3bimbt,Synnerrs,2,Mon Jun 29 15:25:40 2015 UTC,Color laser for the win. Rocking a Canon 7110C that works swimmingly (even if it is a little slow for a laser printer).

Staples,3bidam,zitro34,3,Mon Jun 29 13:51:43 2015 UTC,I do believe reviews will be delivered by the end of July (USA) and raises will be effective August 2.
Staples,3bidam,killer_chair,3,Mon Jun 29 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it differs from Canada/US but; (this might not be accurate, my idea is based on the data you can get from https://associateconnection.staples.com )  Here in Canada, the Yearly review/raise is on your date of hire anniversary. Again, this might be wrong.  After that, every (6?) months you get performance reviews which will grant a small raise depending on how you are rated by your GM/supervisors.  If you login to the website I've linked at the start of this, you'll be able to look on the left pane, lower section named "" Job Data "" with one of the links being "" Job Summary "".  You will see detailed information from the date of hire. you may some of the followings: Hire, Pay Rt Chg, Data Chg, Merit and, Job Data Change.  In your case, you should see the "" Job Data Change "" from when you became a tech. The amount you get extra for a tech may vary. I know here it's a 2$/hr extra that you get BUT, it's not in your actual wage, it's more of a bonus that is shown on your payslip and they can take it off at anytime.  All this might not be 100% correct, I'm going off from what I can see and understand.  Welcome to the Easytech!"

Cashiers or normal floor associates usually don't have a problem with this. Messenger bags are kind of cool though"
Staples,3bh7gs,WorktheMoo,6,Mon Jun 29 06:05:13 2015 UTC,This... this seems highly unprofessional. If I was a high profile customer coming in and all of the associates I spoke with had backpacks on I would be a little confused and put off.  My roommate work for AT&T and they are required to wear relatively small messenger bags; just big enough for a 14in tablet. It looks way more professional than sporting a multicolored JanSport.
Staples,3bh7gs,mr-octo_squid,5,Mon Jun 29 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"I did no wear one last year and I will not wear one this year. The back sweat is definitely not worth it and on top that it's a damn safety hazard. It's completely empty so catching it on something or having it slip off and get in the way is totally possible  Snagging it in something going up and down a ladder, catching it on a hook, picking up a box and catching your arm/hand in it. All great reasons to tell them to fuck off with the backpacks. On top of that it is unethical to resell them after sweating your ass off in it and wearing it. Why would a customer want to buy that? I also totally agree with the points of it looking unprofessional. I wear a backpack to and from work because I ride my bike and have shit to carry. When I get a ride to work and have my uniform on customers are more reluctant (not all) to ask for help because it looks like I'm off the clock. They are used to us in our good ole sleazy tech costumes so why confuse them? I can rant all day on this. I hate wearing the pin and stickers and looking like a bulletin board. That to me is whatever and thinks it's annoying but I'll do it. Backpacks though. That is where my line has been drawn. Excuse the lack of paragraphs."

Staples,3bfpd9,bopisalert,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:35:32 2015 UTC,But yet there is something about your life that you just cannot let go of Staples...that you have to keep coming back...trying to stir up crap...you just cannot let go.  What is it? Why is it that you have moved on to greener pastures but still like to play and roll around in the dung you call Staples?
Staples,3bfpd9,bopisalert,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:06:35 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks for downvoting me again because you do not agree with what I say. Second, I really do enjoy this forum and everyone on it and most have something to share about their experience there (usually negative) but it is something we all have in common. I hated the company, but I love its employees."
Staples,3bfpd9,FormerSCIA,2,Mon Jun 29 17:53:53 2015 UTC,I'd agree.

Staples,3bfpd9,UnnamedStaplesDrone,2,Sun Jun 28 21:44:42 2015 UTC,Why do you even work here? I say its for the great employee discount or perhaps the health benefits.

Staples,3bfpd9,BadForBidness,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:45:19 2015 UTC,I was being sarcastic. The discount is meh (I say that because Target is 10% and BJ's Wholesale is a free membership $50 value) but the part time health benefits are there so they can say they offer something.
Staples,3bfpd9,The_Moot,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:53:40 2015 UTC,Was an amazing discount.

Try to find out and then tell your boss you want to be scheduled at least minimum. If he doesn't, then report him to HR. If he does, then prepare to get a bunch of write ups till you're fired and then you can collect unemployment."

Staples,3bfohj,mr-octo_squid,5,Sun Jun 28 21:20:43 2015 UTC,They sent a box with the above mentioned items. I did not read the note inside. I have also not seen any MAPs on the issue. But I assume we are as we did for the Windows 8 launch.

Staples,3bfohj,intheclouds04,3,Sun Jun 28 22:26:05 2015 UTC,July 29th is the launch date. Personally looking forward to it. Much more friendly to those without a touchscreen device. Not looking forward to the hoards of people that will try and upgrade it on their own and expect us to fix it for free when it goes wrong.
Staples,3bfohj,FormerSCIA,2,Mon Jun 29 01:46:43 2015 UTC,I heard something about a talent track training for it. Supposed to be out shortly. We also may have a nice offering for the launch as well.

Staples,3bg14i,IJustWorkHereStaples,6,Sun Jun 28 22:14:29 2015 UTC,I'll admit this one isn't actually a scam. They use their Chase Ink Business cards because they get 5x points back at Office Supply stores (Staples).   Say they buy $1000 worth of gift cards. That's 5000 points. If you value it at 1 cent per point that's $50 right there. They then either use the $1000 as regular daily spend or find a way to turn it into cash. They then repeat the cycle over and over again until they rank thousands of points.  Then turn those points into free flights.
Staples,3bg14i,WelcomeToStaples,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:52:21 2015 UTC,"I assumed they aren't scammers, but every time these people come in  the store, our managers act like they have been poisoned or shot by them."

Your GM may have already been doing this, but some aren't quite that competent. Make sure you're getting paid."
Staples,3bdpmp,Doominated,4,Sun Jun 28 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"Meetings are paid, yes.  You should clock in when you arrive, out when you leave.  If you're in California, you should have had two breaks and a lunch Friday and Saturday both, since you worked a full 8 hours.  Tomorrow you may have a single break, no lunch.  However, labor laws vary by state, so if you're not in California it will very likely be different.  You should speak to the MOD or your direct supervisor to determine break/lunch schedules, they will know."
Staples,3bdpmp,elentirion,2,Sun Jun 28 06:33:56 2015 UTC,"I won't bother to even take the break tomorrow, it's only three hours.  Each normal day next week I'm working 6 hours. I'll punch in for those and get a single lunch each, right? NJ, not CA.  Would the MOD be able to get me clocked in for the hours from the two training days, or do I need to go to the GM for that?"
Staples,3bdpmp,elentirion,3,Sun Jun 28 06:40:06 2015 UTC,"Not up to speed on NJ labor laws.  Here you'd get a single 15 minute break and a half-hour lunch for a 6 hour shift.  As for clocking in the hours, it depends.  Ops Sup, SM, and GM have access to that.  I don't think IS or department sups do outside of special circumstances."
Staples,3bdpmp,throwaway81916,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:44:22 2015 UTC,Yep in NJ you'll get a 15 minute break for a 4-6 hr shift 6 hour shift and longer you get 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute unpaid lunch. Though I never end up taking any of my breaks except for the unpaid lunch because it gets busy.
Staples,3bdpmp,staplesthrowaway666,4,Mon Jun 29 00:27:31 2015 UTC,Welcome to the unorganized cluckerfuck called Staples.
Staples,3bdkus,TheLonelyPotato-,3,Sun Jun 28 05:18:30 2015 UTC,Easiest way is to have a list of your sku and then you call the store give them the SKU the ring it up and you give the customers credit card over the phone.
Staples,3bdkus,eternistarr,2,Sun Jun 28 05:25:22 2015 UTC,Is that what we're supposed to do? That just seems like something that would be frowned upon.  Or what if the customer doesn't want us to read it over the phone?
Staples,3bdkus,eternistarr,3,Sun Jun 28 05:27:52 2015 UTC,Its what we have always done. Most of the time people will call in and schedule an onsite so when you get there that's how they pay. I've never had a customer have a problem with it and its been two years now. Its justifiable because you're holding the card so as far as the store or corporate is concerned it shouldn't be a problem. Just offer a digital receipt so they get a receipt and offer to mail them a hard copy.
Staples,3bdkus,eternistarr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:31:21 2015 UTC,"We dont have customers calling in for onsites as of yet, as I said, its still really new in our area. Both of the appointments I have scheduled have been customer walk ins.   We don't have digital receipts in Canada yet, as far as I know.   I'll let my GM know that's the most common way. She's as lost as i am."
Staples,3bdkus,Jake1433,2,Sun Jun 28 05:35:09 2015 UTC,Hopefully you will get the training and that will help.
Staples,3bdkus,kirashi3,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:38:45 2015 UTC,Yep. That's the correct procedure. The training lady told us to do it that way and I've done it on my first two on-sites so far.
Staples,3bdkus,aforsberg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:40:28 2015 UTC,Just an FYI. Any chip and pin credit card that is manually keyed over the phone or in store can be charge backed by customers. Banks hold the retailer it was used at liable unless the card is a traditional swipe card. So watch yourself.
Staples,3bdkus,GoodFoBidness,2,Mon Jun 29 01:30:25 2015 UTC,"My general attitude is that I will never use my personal car for anything work-related. They aren't paying my insurance. There is no obligation on your part to do so.  That said, I used to often take calls from onsite technicians looking for an MOD to ring them out over the phone for the stuff the customer wanted."
Staples,3bdkus,aforsberg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:29:03 2015 UTC,"They aren't paying my insurance. There is no obligation on your part to do so.   Can you explain how we aren't obligated?  Honestly I think I'm about done with onsites but I'm convinced they will fire me if I stop doing them. in other words, I feel pretty obligated.  That said this ""I dont do onsites you dont pay my insurance"" line was used by another associate to seemingly great effect."
Staples,3bdkus,agarwaen117,2,Sun Jun 28 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"If another associate wants to lend me their car or (better yet) we get a company car, I'd be thrilled to do onsites. The fact that Staples reimburses you for miles only accounts for the cost of gas, not maintenance or insurance costs. (as far as I know.) I've gotten out of doing onsites every single time I've been asked by saying that I'd do it if someone lends me their car, but either way I'm not comfortable doing it.  In terms of insurance, I know that there are cases here in the US where your personal insurance will not cover you for incidents that happen while you use the car for business purposes.  I don't know if there's any actual rule in the Staples handbook, but I know that the job description I got hired for said nothing about onsites. You could ""in theory"" get your license suspended, and that would make it impossible for you to do onsites. You cannot legally be fired for something like that."
Staples,3bdkus,elentirion,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"You have to tell the insurance company that you will be using the vehicle for business purposes, and it will be covered (you'll also pay more)  That is in the training, iirc."
Staples,3bdkus,Zenkre,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:55:23 2015 UTC,"UPCs work as well, but SKUs are less cumbersome.  Here in the US, what eternistarr stated is exactly how we're supposed to do it.  We also try to get them to pay up front, and if they cancel within 24 hours of the COT itself there is a cancellation charge."
Staples,3bdkus,eternistarr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:26:38 2015 UTC,"All that information is on the new on-site learners guide. Give it a read, it explains that you call the store prior to any ""overtime"" or extra purchases, ring the SKUs over the phone with an MOD and when you get back to the store, scan and email the receipt to the customer.  Is there no public transit where you work? Here in Toronto I do the on-sites and take transit everywhere and get fare refunded after. Simples."
Staples,3bdkus,Zenkre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:17:48 2015 UTC,We have 0 public transit in our area so not even an option. I feel the same way about not being fully compensated for the on sites. However my position hangs on if we keep our numbers high so I'll take the tech and do the job but it really isn't right of staples.
Staples,3bdkus,kirashi3,2,Sun Jun 28 19:30:39 2015 UTC,You are under no obligation to do on-sites as I am pretty sure its voluntary and not part of any current job description. But you should get payed your $2 tech premium for going out.
Staples,3bdkus,Zenkre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:20:02 2015 UTC,Is there official documentation for Staples Canada regarding the premium pay for on Sites?
Staples,3bgjgs,BadForBidness,18,Mon Jun 29 01:00:50 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for everyone, but I hope you realize that people post on here to vent right? If your friends/family come to you venting about their job do you call them whiny bitches who suck at their job too? Just because someone makes a post that could potentially be perceived as whiny to a total stranger completely unaffiliated with the poster and completely unaware of the preconditions that led to the post, doesnt mean that that person sucks at their job not does it mean that the poster hates their job and/or the company. I thought this was fairly obvious, but evidently it is not. Complaints are not always related to poor performance, sometimes they are legitimate complaints and even a person who is a poor performer could raise an issue that should be taken seriously. Your personal anecdotal experience does not dictate reality, so I would caution against assuming a bunch of total strangers are lazy whiners simply because that is your own experience. If this is your attitude then please do not become a manager or if you are a manager perhaps you should consider an occupation that does not require you to understand people or human behavior. People in retail need managers who are able to understand why people do the things they do, not discount them without bothering to understand the root cause of their behavior."
Staples,3bgjgs,DaBidnessman,-7,Mon Jun 29 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"So not valid. You are blind (and I'm honestly not trying to be offensive when I say that) if you don't think people on here are posting blantant HATERED, and using that exact word, ""hate"" for the company. You can easily pull it up on your phone or computer to see for yourself, as I won't waste time giving you a couple thousands or at least hundreds of links to this. There's a difference between posting suggestions for a company as well compared to the,""oh just fuck everyone in corporate"" attitude that many post their complaints based on. I appreciate you trying to speak for everyone or rather not speak for everyone, but that's just total bullshit that most people aren't just flaming this subreddit with non-sensical hate based on their expierences at a store or two."

Staples,3bgjgs,chi7891,8,Mon Jun 29 03:08:06 2015 UTC,"You call the ones that attempt to point out valid issues, maybe not in the most professional way, they have a ""douchebaggery lazy fuckface attitude"" yet fail to see where they are coming from. You attempt to explain to us how most corporation's CEO/Owners are ""douche bags"" and expect us to kiss their feet. You fail to realize not all of us come from a ""douchebaggery lazy fuckface attitude"", but attempt to do our best, and fail because Staples, as a company, fails to keep up in technology and ethics that other companies, despite still paying minimum wage and is retail, holds on to. And yet you have the audacity to insult everyone here for not being grateful enough.  What am I talking about? What do other companies hold on to that we fail to even scratch the surface? Let's start with our registers. Any other stores and restaurants allow the customer to swipe ahead of time. Chipole, Wal-mart, Target, Best buy, McDonalds, etc. all allow the customer to swipe their cards first. This alone, simply cuts down on checkout time. Not even mentioning having to tell customers to ""swipe again please because the machine wasn't ready yet"". Or the fact that Staple alone chases down on digital receipts. Forcing associates to lie about receiving a digital receipt, while any other company simply allows the CUSTOMER to CHOOSE what form of a receipt they wanted. The malls I have went to all ask the customer if they want to provide their email if they are a new customer, otherwise has a choice of digital or hard copy of the receipt.   The other day, I went to Wal-mart and forgot my wallet. The cashier simply put my transaction ON HOLD and continued to ring out customers behind me while I went to my car to retrieve my wallet. What can we do? VOID the whole transaction? (That needs a manager override) or item correct EACH SINGLE ITEM? Our registers take a while for the digital receipts to even pop up AFTER you hit the button for it.   And most of us will always complain about wages. That will always be there, in any company that pays minimum. But the fact of the matter is when a company like Wal-mart raises their wage to $9.00, and shortly other companies follow suit. Where is staples in all this? Where is our call to a raise? Are we not big enough of a store to do so? Or is it our employees not worth it?   And when we complain about corporate, it's not because it's the usual crap we complain about. It's because ONLINE RETURNS require us to CALL for a price with no cross-channels. It's because we don't even have cross-channels in the first place and have to wait on hold like a REGULAR CUSTOMER. Now apply this return to a full line, how does that even make sense? Or about that $50 dollar coupon that could be applied on items on the kiosk and have a customer walk out with a free tablet. Or the prices online being $0, $9,999,999, or a Logitech mice that was free online due to corporate's error? And when we accidentally let those items be purchased, we are the ones being blamed.   Or what about training, or the lack of it? I won't even start with the position of IS and the ridiculousness of this position, since some of these issues are in my store alone.    TL;DR Don't blatantly insult people by assuming what their work ethnics are when you are biased yourself and only can see your store and people around you. That simply makes you an ignorant fool who is oblivious to Staples' failure as a company to provide basic tools for its' store employees and still expect results."
Staples,3bgjgs,chi7891,-1,Mon Jun 29 16:17:28 2015 UTC,"But by you defending those who I've, ""blatantly insulted"" you're contributing to the fact the stereotype I'm talking about does exist in a large sense, and for that I applaud you. Also, let me make this clear, I appreciate the fact you're using logic and giving me reasons behind why you dislike what the company, and THANK YOU for actually talking about the company as a whole and not just basing your point on one or two store's atmosphere's. I know that everyone thinks I'm just a dick for what my original post says, and if what I typed makes me a dick, then oh well. Do I agree with the shady digital receipts? Not at all, believe it or not I actually strongly criticized and spoke out against the company's policy for the way it approached things. I do believe there is a more ethical approach to digital receipts compared to how it's being done now. Regarding the hold problem with registers, we can put transactions on hold... You press copy hold. Staples IS already and has stated their minimum wage is going up to $9. The on-line returns are a pain in the ass, but I suppose they want every dollar to be accounted for, and can you blame them? Well I think the answer to that is it depends what kind of person you are. If I was running a company I know I'd sure like to have a process that guarantees every penny is accounted for, even if it takes a little extra time. Obviously it's a pain in the ass especially when you're super busy but to an extent it makes sense. The registers are outdated and their bringing new ones in to most stores as well. Amazon in-particular also has faulty pricing on a lot of items as well, and every company is going to have it's fair share of fuck up's when it comes to promo give aways or pricing. The training to me is more of a, ""learn as you go"" type pace, rather than watch videos (I think we should really stop using talent track so much), and to your last point, as I've already stated before. The only people who will be, ""blatantly insulted"" are those who are the lazy employee, it wouldn't make sense if a hard working employee would disagree with most of my points. I've worked at about 10 different stores in different regions, yet I STILL try my hardest not to think I know it all because ultimately I don't, and never could, every store is different. And EVERYONE is biased in their own way, that's the point of opinions... As for being an, ""ignorant fool"" I'd rather be bliss in ignorance than miserable and have an attitude that the company's a, ""failure"" so I mine as well do nothing. I appreciate your post, because, for the most part, you brought up a lot of valid points. So thanks!"
Staples,3bgjgs,Pooseh,7,Mon Jun 29 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"Staples was a good company back in the day, and it could be good again. The major problem is the upper management got lazy and greedy.    Yes, a lot of companies have lazy, greedy bastards for leaders. But on the other hand, there are many out there that are changing the status quo and treating employees well.   Ron is extremely overpaid for the job he does and the level he performs at. Bottom line is that he is rewarded for failure.  On top of that, the company is extremely top heavy. There are to many senior executive VPs, EVP's, etc, etc.   There is NO need to have both Demos and Otis. There is no need for chief ""culture"" exec John Burke. There are (to) many redundant positions.  To support all the fat in the upper echelons they keep the stores lean."

Yes... But there's also winners out there.. Maybe we're a smaller percentage, and we get our share of hecklers (looking at you /u/operacarmen), but I'm going to keep winning.

Staples,3b9mqz,staplesmanager,-1,Thu Jul 2 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on a few factors- how good/valuable of an employee you are, how badly do they need staff, how far in advanced your other schedule is made, and how set in stone is your other job hours. For example we have a girl who works Mon, Thursday, Friday evening at her other job every week, every month, and so we schedule her accordingly. We have another guy who works at at a place that gives him three weeks schedule advance,  so we work around that. But if your job only gives you a week or so warning on your schedule- not gonna happen"

Staples,3b4y0h,TechThrowAway20,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:47:19 2015 UTC,"But they don't in this company. If you sell well they just put more pressure on you you keep improving, and when you inevitably fail to do so you get a PCR, whilst simultaneously not even offering raises, rewards, bonuses or even full time work."
Staples,3b4y0h,Joshelplex,0,Sun Jul 5 03:04:38 2015 UTC,"No staples won't.  But if you consistently do well you may get noticed by others who will pay is what I'm saying, or even get the metrics to prove how well you do and show that to potential employers.  I got a job offer when I wasn't even looking for one, and it was because one of the vendors at my store saw how well I did and put in a good word."
Staples,3b4y0h,TechThrowAway20,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:05:59 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly common. And for most, sales is not the career, it's the starting point, so the fact there is no upwards mobility at all means there is no incentive at all to do your job well, since if you were a good salesperson, you'd go to a company with benefits or rewards or basically anything to offer at all, and if you want a non-sales job, you just have to leave since support staff are all ""redundant"" now and lost their jobs"

It doesn't sound like your managers are doing a very good job, so of course folks won't care. That's one of the challenging parts of being a manager, but it seems like most people promoted to manager are so hopelessly clueless about dealing with people."
Staples,3b4y0h,DaBidnessman,2,Fri Jun 26 01:25:26 2015 UTC,"It isn't about the company, or the incentive. It is about yourself. You work hard because you take pride in yourself, in your performance, and in how you represent yourself to others. If you are in a job where you don't feel any desire to carry yourself in that regard, then that isn't the company for you.   I started in this company as a poorly paid part-time office supply worker, but I poured everything into it because I feel that regardless of what the job is, if you accept it then you should give it your absolute best, or move on. In just a couple years, I have went full-time and been promoted twice. It is still a lot of stress, and things aren't always fair, but at the end of the day, I like what I do, and I like doing it well. The company has rewarded me thus far for giving it my best, and so long as the job is still there, I will continue to give it my all."
Staples,3b4y0h,StaplesArbitor,5,Fri Jun 26 09:12:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. Why give it your all when the company doesn't value it. Only put in the work they pay you to do. I wouldn't work off the clock at my store, I wouldn't skip breaks and I wouldn't try hard. Staples wanted to pay minimum wage, cool then they get minimum effort. It's a two way street.  The whole ""give it your best"" is BS. You can out it 110% and at the end of the day what happens? Your still stuck with a shit job, with a shit company. Companies want the best talent? Earn it, its not free. You get what you pay for."
Staples,3b4y0h,staplesthrowaway666,2,Fri Jun 26 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"There isn't a point. Workers should be compensated on a base line first, then extra as their efforts produce profits. There's not even a point working as an ET, really, since you're more than likely not gaining any real skills. The only skill I walked away with from Staples is the patience of a goddamn zen master followed closely by a (not curbed) rather unhealthy liking for a few (4+) gin and tonics after work. Or, on weekends, before work."
Staples,3b4y0h,mooninitespwnj00,2,Fri Jun 26 08:29:59 2015 UTC,Because it's your job and they pay you to sell. You're being paid because it's work and work isn't considered pleasant. Suck it up and do it or get a different job
Staples,3b4y0h,Spidertech500,0,Fri Jun 26 00:40:02 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly rather sell than sit at the register.  Anything but the register. I can't stand the crazy coupon ladies, the foreign guys who try to barter, the general assholes, EVERY GOD DAMN PERSON WALKING UP THE WRONG COUNTER WITHOUT A REGISTER, and having to put on a fake smile all day.  I have no issues with meeting a customer on the floor and helping them buy what they need. I love helping the sweet old lady find the printer that's right for her or taking in a PC and just connecting it to matrix after giving it a good dusting.  I guess I'm a bit of a workaholic at times too.  I can't stand the wait between customers, I always need to be doing something.

According to my sales pitch, none of the printers in our store have ever been returned, they're just that reliable (Except Samsung. We don't carry the toner for ink attaches, so every single Samsung laser ever bought has been returned). Ink cartridges get a random-number-of-the-day pages between 300-600 pages, and XL get a random-number-of-the-day pages between 700-800. Also, printers will literally explode after the manufacturer's warranty, so you should buy ST."
Staples,3b22rb,Want_To_Talk,2,Fri Jun 26 04:13:46 2015 UTC,Lol I try to be truthful... And printers are the easiest to sell with ST because of the printer protection kit with the usb cable and misc stuff. For the cost of a nice cable get a 2 year plan.

Staples,3asfqe,TEEHEE_NYC87,2,Tue Jun 23 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"It seems staples likes to hire anyone but abuses their decent workers the most.  There are a couple 60+ year olds at my store that are ""getting a sip of water"" or taking a dump more than they are at their check-stands. Heaven forbid there be more than 1 customer in line while they ""get a sip of water"" for the 90th time this shift.  I feel somewhat bad that an elderly person has to work as a cashier, but honestly it's shit that I have to deal with them being terrible at their job. I guarantee if any of our younger cashiers were ""getting a sip of water"" half as much as our near-deads they would be fired.  Oh you have a fully available schedule? Here's a million 4 hour shifts at random times of day randomly selected each week. Good thing you're such a team player so everyone else can have exactly what they want.  People whos primary job it is to do load have kids so they want to work at specific times which happen to be not when the truck is there? That's cool. Just stop doing tech work and do load for 3 days in a row. Also why is tech turnaround so high, work on it."

Our regular manager, who gets things done and encourages people just the right amount towards things like ST and email receipts, left for vacation. Now we have this substitute prick who literally cannot stop shoving ST down people's throat. Someone came in looking for a tablet the other day, and he insisted cramming chargers, ST, cases, screen protectors and everything in the book on this poor customer who was just looking at them. He told her to follow me to cases while following behind, essentially forcing her to follow me in the aisle, and then proceeded to mouth 'Squaretrade' and 'More Account' to me over and over, before he left and did it over the radio. It's been 3 days of this, and I'm ready to quit… Fuck you Mike."

Staples,3ar9kq,bopisalert,4,Mon Jun 22 21:33:03 2015 UTC,"If this is a Tech Observation form, then it is simply a written form of coaching... It helps your managers to look back, see what they've been coaching you on, and track progress. It's not meant to be punitive, but if you find yourself being coached on the same things over and over again, then I would expect it to lead to note to files, etc.   They are actually a really good tool for a manager who doesn't know how to coach, in order to learn how to do it. I used to use them quite a bit, but now coaching is natural to me, and I do it constantly."
Staples,3ar9kq,Kal-ElofKrypton,5,Mon Jun 22 23:47:07 2015 UTC,This. Observation forms were huge for us last year. Good evidence (positive or negative) for review time as well! But mostly just a coaching tool.

Staples,3ap7di,TheAssThief,3,Mon Jun 22 11:17:40 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend against photo paper, however, heated lamination likes to leave bubbles on glossy paper."
Staples,3ap7di,avarweth,2,Mon Jun 22 12:01:58 2015 UTC,"Roughly .39 cents per colour print, and another .30 cents I believe for the photo paper for each print, so .69 cents per print, unless you have both of them on the same sheet. Cutting them out would be free, and laminating it would cost 2.49 I believe. this is standard pricing, so you would have to come back to get it. There is also a 2$ document servicing fee, so you're looking at roughly 7$ for standard or roughly 10$ if the associate can do it on the spot for you."

There was an email out syaing not to leave shit in the totes, but sometimes what I see in from the warehouse is just madness.. of course it's very possible the warehouse has 3 workers, all treated like shit, making 50 cents more an hour than us, and simply don't give a rats ass ..

Staples,3amppe,WizzBangSince1994,2,Mon Jun 22 02:57:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Think of it this way, if Staples treats the customer facing employees who actually sale stuff like garbage, imagine how they treat the guys who work behind the scenes and don't directly affect profits."
Staples,3amppe,staplesthrowaway666,2,Mon Jun 22 04:40:27 2015 UTC,They're passively aggressively telling people to empty their fucking totes of trash before sending them back.  Edit: I never understand how people would stack their totes on the pallet with trash still inside. It takes 2 seconds to grab the trash and put it in the fucking trash can.
Staples,3amppe,Synnerrs,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:47:34 2015 UTC,I used to always empty the trash from our totes before sending it back  because I didn't want to be part of the problem. It's been getting progressively worse and worse and now I just stopped giving a fuck and I put as much shit in there as I can. Sometimes I'll just fill the top tote of our return pallet with shit so they have to empty it to be able to use it.

Staples,3amppe,TEEHEE_NYC87,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:19:28 2015 UTC,"There has always been a disconnect between the warehouse and the stores. Just like there is between corporate and every other department. After 16 years you just do what ever the hell you want to make your own job easier. Because that is what they are telling stores to do....everything that will make their own jobs easier.   Heavy boxes are supposed to be stacked on the bottom right? So why do I consistently receive pallets with paper boxes on top of the pallet, oh and what's at the bottom?...a couple laptops wedged in there. The other day I received a pallet that had shrink wrap on it so tightly it crushed 2 chair boxes, with 2 laptops between those next to grey totes, laptop boxes were crushed.   So yeah...you get a little garbage in the totes and you cry? Laugh out loud"

Staples,3am53j,staplesxp,6,Sun Jun 21 16:36:18 2015 UTC,"At no point in all my years working in Staples stores did a single customer ask if we had toys, you know what they ask for, office supplies and on occasion small hand tools like screwdrivers and hammers.  You know what none of the stores I worked in or visited carried - hand tools like screwdrivers and hammers.  You know what they do carry - these stupid toys.  The issue is this type of product is not at all, in any way shape or form, necessary, yet it takes up 16 feet of floor real estate and is either stolen or ripped out of the package and played with, just to be discarded on the floor.  Find me a substantial need for this to be in the store, show me the numbers that justify it's existence and I will pull this post and apologize."
Staples,3am53j,staplesxp,2,Sun Jun 21 17:45:00 2015 UTC,"Fair questions. Part of staying relevant as a b&m retailer as core office supplies and tech continue to decline is bringing in new (or expanding old) product categories that are growing in the market and are purchased by our existing customers. This is why cleaning and breakroom and mail and ship are so successful. These product fall into the teaching and education category -- the market is growing and our existing customers align with the average customer in this category. This was one of the successful ""new"" categories that was expanded in OS reflow."
Staples,3am53j,easytech109,2,Sun Jun 21 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"This is not an item we need to expand into.  The Teaching and Education category is one of, if not, the worst laid out planograms that Staples has, so much is crammed into such a small space that it's products tend to dominate the clearance section as most go unnoticed by customer and associates alike.  Take some time and walk into a store and look at it, it's difficult to shop, from the stickers and borders to the reference books, poster boards and the Artskills products on that stupid carousel that barely fits next to the tri-fold boards,  it's a nightmare.  If done right it would at least expand into half of this board game/toy crap, then you just have the educational toys minus this BS, and what the Hell is the Melissa & Doug toys for, I thought that was the educational toy section? There is nothing to justify the existence of a Rescue Bot toy in my store and I would argue any other Staples store as well.  There is more justification to sell milk, juice and bread, then that silly toy."

Staples,3ajefx,staplesthrowaway666,2,Mon Jun 22 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"From my one experience with a store closing (it was a different company) you tend not to know until the day of. You just show up one day and there is a letter posting saying the decision has been made to close your location. The management might know things are not going well, but might shrug it off as not being bad enough, which could be true. Your store might be doing well, but if the land is more valueable or there is a newer Depot nearby on a cheaper lot, yours might be choosen for those reasons. With my store it came with such a surprise that when the DM had a surprise visit to deliver the news, the manager broke down crying, and liquidators immediately took over. From a business standpoint, they try to keep you in the dark as much as possible to try and not hurt morale and cause theft."
Staples,3ajefx,WhateverItTakes10x,3,Sat Jun 20 19:59:13 2015 UTC,"With Staples there is a checklist that goes into place very similar to the 8 week checklist for Physical Inventory.  It will not be a wham your store is closing.  It will be a process of events that will occur.  There will be window signs to be hung, it will begin printing out on receipts that the store is closing.  It will not be you walking in one day at Staples to a building with the lights turned off and no personnel to be found."
Staples,3ajefx,staplesthrowaway666,-1,Sun Jun 21 01:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, but the checklist comes after the decision is made. I'm just saying most liekly they will not have any warning until the decision is made to liquidate."

I know some stores that close have different methods of announcing it, whether it be huge clearance sales until its announced, immensely cut hours, stressed managers.

Staples,3ajefx,bopisalert,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:29:30 2015 UTC,"When it comes to store closings, usually the decision is made high high up.

Staples,3ah7ug,venturer95,5,Sat Jun 20 03:52:20 2015 UTC,"The only major incident I can recall: Used to have a customer who made custom teddy bears by hand. She made one for a roughly 90 year old customer who collected ties from every major event in his life (prom, wedding, shit like that etc.). USPS lost the package. The person she made the teddy bear for called the store repeatedly threatening lawsuits, threatening physical violence etc against whoever he got on the phone. USPS ended up refunding the woman, who then refunded the guy. Then the package eventually got delivered about 2 months after it was shipped.  Thats the only major USPS incident I can recall. Every other case I would just give them the 1800ASKUSPS number and tell them we have nothing to do with the packages, we are simply an authorized provider, we don't have anything do with it once it leaves the building. Lots of customers would try and argue but there is literally no further info we could provide them they couldn't get themselves via tracking it online so most would eventually just call the number and leave us alone."

Staples,3agtc3,Bokchoi75,9,Sat Jun 20 15:10:13 2015 UTC,Any aisle in office supplies is horrible. The sheer amount of 100% fictional products that people come in looking for is crazy. I remember one time a store I was working at got a 3 on CSAT because the customer was upset we didn't carry a product that he made up and at the price point he set in his delusional world.

Plus, I ALWAYS get the ""it's so expensive"" comment. FUCK YOU. I don't care. Don't buy a printer if you can't afford to refill it, and don't bother me if you are too stupid to find out where to do that.  Which brings me to my next point: Where can I buy this cheaper/refill this?  OK, since you asked so nicely, I will tell you how to go somewhere else and not help keep me employed; ROFL, no. We don't suggest doing that because the carts are prone to failure and they can damage a printer (I know, BS, but fuck it, it's not my job to be smart for them when it doesn't make us money). Seriously, the nerve."

You can spend 10-15 minutes straightening everything, and then, after about 30 minutes, it look's like a tornado has went through the aisle with binders strewn about everywhere.  Just makes it worse with back to school, because I already know people are going to be flinging binders all over the place and asking me ""which size binder do I need"" (I have no clue, maybe you should have thought about that before coming into the store. . .)?  A close second is the dated planners section (which most of you guys referenced), because it is always a mess there and impossible to keep organized (kind of like the binder wall)."

Always very annoying to organize and always very annoying to deal with customers shopping there. People would always come in looking for filofax despite it not being carried for years. One of my worst customers was upset about us not carrying something in that section.  Easy Tech... feels like every aisle. And the thing that gets to me is shrinkage. I'm the one that does the pull list most of the time and having to take hits on products constantly just isn't good.
Staples,3agtc3,toothpick21,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"Fucking ink. Holy shit. I'm going to really go into this. First off a customer walks in with their brand fucking new phone and on a piece of paper has written down the fucking name/model number of the printer. They than ask you while they have their phone in their hand ""can you help me find this ink?"" Obviously like the good little drone I am I have to help him/her despite having a shit ton of tech I need to work on. I look her up the ink cartridge and I tell him/her what she needs and I direct to the ink Isle.  Little I know this customer cant fucking read and asks me to help them to the isle. I find them their ink and now I have to sit through them complaining how expensive ink is. While this is happening I get this sudden urge to tell them ""if its too expensive for you don't buy. You wont achieve anything by complaining to me"". Obviously I'd never say that but I can dream.  TL;DR Customers have the ability to look up the ink they need and then need to be guided to the isle because they can't read."
Staples,3agtc3,exile0514,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:54:13 2015 UTC,Dated for obvious reasons. Writing instruments for those customers that need a pen refill but can only describe what their pen looks like or have a bag full of pens they need refills for. Plastics because it almost always means I have to dig through the overhead because the box on the shelf is a little scratched. Telephones because it's ALWAYS an old lady who asks my personal recommendation and instructions on how to set it up (this might be simple for some of you techs but for the most part my whole store has no idea about home phones). Tablet and mobile accessories because I get to stand there and help the customer pick out a design they like... I could keep going but I'll probably end up pointing out the annoying customers for every damn POG.
Staples,3agtc3,staplesslave,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:02:50 2015 UTC,"Planners is a pain for sure. My go to response is ""if you don't see it there we don't have it"". I don't even go to that aisle.

Most stores have either a small amount consumer grade desks and chairs, chairs exclusively, or both of the previous + demo models of professional grade office furniture that must be ordered online and delivered. If I were in your position I'd be looking for a new job in anticipation of a layoff. You shouldn't have any issue collecting unemployment if you do get laid off tho, so it depends on how much cash you need to survive."

Overall, our dpt dropped and we lost thousands in desk sales and a few esp dollars.  Sorry nobody wanted purple plastic ladels or green fuzzy socks..."
Staples,3ah9xy,dan2872,6,Sun Jun 21 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"It's too soon to say. I would imagine when the companies combine and share secrets there will be things such as labor models that the company will look at and determine ""this works so well."" Stales presence in Texas has been dismal from my understanding with entire districts closing from poor sales. If that's the case and your store does well I would imagine your store would stay open. As far as labor models my guess is that there would be a few months to a year observing how the OD la or model works and comparing Customer Satisfaction, productivity and profitability between the 2 models. (Un)Fortunately profitability being key.  I would imagine you'd be fine for a minimum of 3 months after the purchase is approved, but like I said it's too soon to tell. The companies are still at a point where they can't share informarion. Anything that has been learned has been through observation.

Staples,3aekpw,drdokatz,2,Wed Jun 24 16:17:48 2015 UTC,Honestly keeping the clearence section in my store looking half decent is a full time job in itself. Especially because I always have double the amount of clearance as space: And some things simply will never sell. We have had some VHS tapes back there for like...my entire career. Can't we manually mark stuff down further just to make room? Better to take a loss than waste valuable space.
Staples,3aekpw,FaxForRA,2,Fri Jun 19 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"Is there HP toner on clearance?  Bottom left that section has the yellow background or your clearance is near the toner aisle, it's odd either way."

Just one of my many stories from one year working at staples: crazy lady comes in yelling and cursing that she paid for an on site job to install a printer and we never showed. She has a torn up, crumbled receipt from 8 months ago and low behold she did pay for it with an unimaginable number of coupons. After lots of yelling and condescension from her (her work order had already been closed and had no comments), we find her actual paper order and find out she cancelled and would call again for a reschedule. She never did. I gladly reschedule her, apologizing fully for any trouble we might have caused her, for the next day. She confirms it. She likes that it will be the next day. She leaves still making comments. About an hour later the birch calls us cursing why we didn't go yet. :/ I explain it's tomorrow, not today! She cancels and says she will call again. That was my first month working there, she never came back."

Staples,3ad8wr,theefancyone,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:51:25 2015 UTC,"We had a pretty rough one today to. Some guy comes in with some staples brights green paper exclaiming that it has faded and wanted to exchange it for pink and yellow. I tell him no problem and ask for a receipt. Says that he paid for it using a gift card and didn't have a rewards card, so I tell him that I could try doing a non-receipted return. The paper comes up 0.00 because of the promotion going on with the brights paper. I tell my GM and he says that we could do an even exchange as long as the paper had the same cost (in the RF gun) and he'd be willing to shrink the pink/yellow down and the green up. I go over the paper wall and pull down 5 pink and 2 yellow and bring it up front. The guy tells me that it's the wrong pink and that he'd be right back. He comes back into the store with the Fushia colored paper he had a sample print done on. I tell him that unfortunately we're out of stock, but I could check other stores in the area so that he could do the same thing there. Well, at this point my GM walks out because I've spent like 5-10 minutes talking with this guy and I'm getting no where. The guy tells my GM that he wants us to order the Fushia paper because he got it here before and that's the color he needs. My GM tells him that we can't order the paper because of inventory reasons (and the fact that we basically have to avoid using the register due to his paper being worthless to us). The guy starts going off asking my GM if telling the customer ""no"" was part of our protocol, bla bla this and that. Well, my GM finally says that he's done everything that he can to help him and that his only option would be to take the pink that we have here in the store, purchase the Fushia paper from .com full price, or go to another store in the area to get the paper he wants and leaves to go ring up some people that started to build up in the checkout area (we're a small T4 store). I ask the guy if he would still like to take some yellow paper and could exchange that at the very least and he agrees and I help load it up into this paper box he brought it in. While I'm loading it up, he goes over to the register that my GM is ringing people up in and starts interrupting his conversation by calling him the ""no"" man and about wanting his name and boss's phone number to call and complain. At this point, my GM is furious and tells the guy that he needs to leave the store because he's interrupting business transactions he's doing with other customers. The guy marches back over to me, asks me for his bosses number and I told him that he needed to leave and to take his paper with him because the manager clearly told him to leave the store. The guy says ""fuck you"" pretty loudly at me and storms out of the store.  Some people are just really fucking retarded and are beyond helping. I didn't even let his shenanigans bother me one bit because I realized that he had the IQ of a gerbil from the begining. The thing that I found funny was the fact that I pulled some back-stocked paper off the shelf (the ones that aren't exposed to the fluorescent lighting) and it was the exact same color as the ones we returned. His paper wasn't even faded."

Staples,3a9dyp,iMurshaq,10,Thu Jun 18 07:12:45 2015 UTC,"I feel where you're coming from. I was fired on the 5th after working at my old store for 3 1/2 years and being Inventory Specialist for about half of that time.  They told me it was because of poor performance (admittedly Prime Time was killing me, but I would even be blamed for freight not finished over the weekend, even though I was off on weekends).  If you ask me, however, I think it's pretty strange that they just so happened to fire me a week after I went to HR after my GM called me a b*tch   I told him at the morning meeting that I had trouble getting all my work done with Prime Time, and that ""I'll do what I can in the time I'm given"" (because, you know, we have such a wonderful ""Open Door Policy"" where you supposedly can bring up any issues at any time... Or so I thought).  A few minutes later, I was in the front office alone and he came in and said that his meetings weren't to be used for, ""Your personal b*tch sessions"". So I went to HR about it, and the rest is history.  Here's to hoping we both find better jobs at better companies. I may miss the money, but I sure as hell don't miss the stress, nor the condescending/delusional  management and corporate."
Staples,3a9dyp,Hylian_Heroine,10,Thu Jun 18 08:04:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like retaliation, which is against the law. Also, if you did not have previous write ups for performance to document a pattern of bad performance then the termination was unwarranted. I'd say it's time to get a lawyer."
Staples,3a9dyp,BigRichie2897,7,Thu Jun 18 14:08:50 2015 UTC,miss the money? staples was paying pennies for the amount of work you put in.
Staples,3a9dyp,staplesslave,4,Thu Jun 18 08:16:29 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, I agree with you 100%. I meant the money in general.  Before I was fired, I was the breadwinner in my relationship (I worked full-time and had the bigger paycheck between us two, so that's just how it was). As someone who considers herself financially independent, having to lean on my husband for everything from my car payment to even small things is tough for me. That being said, no matter how tough it is financially, even he thinks it's for the best in the end.  No more literally worrying myself to the point I was physically sick every morning before work started, anxious at what would happen that day. No more driving 45 minutes (one way) to a job that I hated. No more sweating to death so that the ""CEO/Dear Leader/Weasel-Faced Bastard"" Ron Sargent could make 1000x more than I did last year as he just breathed and counted his money (while I only got paid a portion of what I was 'worth'). No more getting chewed out for having heat exhaustion and being told that I needed to lose weight by my GM. No more having my health privacy violated by my GM. No more doing the work of 2-3 people, and having condescending management belittling me at every step. All while trying to conform to the next ""big bidness"" scheme handed down from corporate's high horses, as the stress ate me and my coworkers alive. No more coming home and feeling as though I had been run over by a freight train, with feet hurting so much I could barely walk after I got home (I was required to wear steel-toe boots by my GM after my foot got run over by a pallet of paper back in December 2014 while unloading truck. Unfortunately the ones I could afford weren't at all comfortable).  Maybe getting away from all that stress will help my health, physically, mentally, and emotionally. I may be worried about money, but at least I don't feel like I did while working there.  And frankly, I'd sooner become a hobo than work at a Staples again. I would add the ""unless MAJOR changes happened"" caveat to that, but we all know that'd never happen. They'd rather watch the ship sink if it meant there'd be more money in their pockets.  Sorry for the rant, it's just a lot to get off my chest.  TL;DR: Staples sucks, don't work for them. If you do, for the love of all that's holy, don't become an Inventory Specialist. Document and record everything derogatory said to you, the more details the better, because management can't be trusted. And always, ALWAYS, be on the lookout for a better job. Never stop looking for a greener pasture."

Staples,3a9dyp,FaxForRA,2,Thu Jun 18 09:14:45 2015 UTC,"Your IS helped in getting you fired even if they didn't do it on purpose.  Cases of water are considered ""Break Packs"", they're like cases of paper.  If the case breaks then you sell the bottles as singles and the system automatically zeros out the case SKU and pluses up the single SKU.  The IS should never CODE 16 (Damaged) the cases of water if they wanted to let you have it.  They should have used CODE 13 (Supplies) instead, then put it in the break-room fridge."

Staples,3aadiy,Yellow-Curry,3,Thu Jun 18 14:21:45 2015 UTC,"I dunno what y'all are privy to, but here's what I can say since you already know about vistaprint. Vista is going away really soon. Funny thing about that is I seem to be getting more and more vista errors the closer we get to there(yesterday I uploaded a business card off a pdf and got a giant picture of a peacock across my screen. I shit you not. I even have a screenshot.) The site is getting a complete overhaul with consolidations so that we won't need 4 different websites and one of the things we've made painfully clear to the designers is that the current pni and vista platforms have problems. What they came back to us with is that we're going to be designing better tools for the website because of how much of a pain design.staples(like actual resizing and cropping!) is and we'll be labelling pickup and delivery far more clearly(because a lot of customers call in with ""why won't it let me select a store"" whem they get to checkout). Vaguely I've also heard backroom talk on the best way to handle the transition on a company level. I dunno how much I can say on an open forum like reddit though."
Staples,3aadiy,nachoiskerka,5,Fri Jun 19 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"We are losing vista completely, nothing is getting saved from it. Expect nightmares and headaches. The new system will route the instant orders to the ecl like the calendars and invites do now.   If you release vendor orders before getting them paid, you wont be able to do that anymore. It has to go thru an eticket.   Customers will be able to pay online for instore order pickups."

Staples,3aadiy,WorktheMoo,2,Thu Jun 18 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"Basically it is supposed to be a site overhaul that will eventually put all our orders in one area (eventually down the line) but short-term, makes us independent from Vistaprint. Main reason people will be upset is the orders that we will no longer have due to those templates being owned by Vistaprint and not us. We were merely renting them (if you'd like to think of it that way). Upside is the orders being paid for so when getting flooded by BC orders that won't get picked up, at least you got something out of it. Also with the call, we didn't hear about the webinar/teleconference until 23 hours prior to the actual thing where I am so I wouldn't be surprised about similar lack of communications every where else"
Staples,3aadiy,ShenanigansAllDay,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:44:43 2015 UTC,"I missed part of it because i had to help my cpc with something but i wouldnt be surprised if its a DCS or a couple of them taking the load on.

Staples,3aadiy,dissqrl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"I was told our contract with Vista expired and, rather than renewing, we bought out (or otherwise came to control) one of their competitors.  No customer data will be retained, as far as business cards and stuff, and any templates not owned by Staples will go away.  Based on that information, I'd assume it's company-wide."

He was truthful about programs that have launched that were failures because we were either to late (mobile) or to early (connected home & 3D TV).  He was also critical of the loss of our selling culture (but no one wanted to point out that vibe killed it).  He comes across sincere in his desire for the company to succeed and for associates to be successful.  He is very direct and blunt, which tracks with many of the horror stories I've seen on here/heard from others.  I don't think he is the ass/tool that he gets portrayed as.

Response ""GM told me to just come in on some other day since he scheduled me wrong and I'm working my other job right now""  ......  Don't forget the days the store opened Late because he scribbled a 7 over the 8 on my schedule. I have no problem making sure there is coverage and doing my part. Just fucking tell me.   /rant"

Staples,3a73mr,playnotwork,4,Wed Jun 17 20:02:50 2015 UTC,I'm unsure as to whether this is the GM's fault for forgetting the availability binder exists or the associates' faults for not just bucking up and working what's on the paper.
Staples,3a73mr,FaxForRA,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:29:07 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with availability, and everything to do with hour caps and no ""safety net"" when people call out. My GM knows her shit, and our schedule in the front office looks similar (though not quite this marked up)."
Staples,3a73mr,asc6,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:35:26 2015 UTC,"It is a combination of staying under 25, appeasing everyone's availability (since they work 2 jobs to be able to support themselves) fucktards who just don't show up or gm switching shit to cover shifts since people quit with no two weeks notice.

Staples,3a7zqv,Kal-ElofKrypton,2,Wed Jun 17 23:07:40 2015 UTC,You're supposed to use the hard plastic blue tags with white lettering. They came in a box to be used with all your BTS transformers. The 2x3 tags go into a clear pocket on the back of the blue tags.

Staples,3a9qgx,haze_gray,5,Thu Jun 18 17:50:25 2015 UTC,"Depending on your financial situation, if you're not married, and the dad isn't in the picture, it may be advantageous to apply for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (also known as TANF or Cash Assistance). Lots of low-income single mothers do this in situations where the father isn't in the picture. Additionally, if you meet income and other requirements, you actually can start receiving TANF while you are pregnant.  It's definitely not the most glamorous program, and there are a lot of requirements you need to meet (including seeking court-ordered child support, which they'll help you with). However, for certain low-income single mothers, TANF can have advantages over just seeking child support outside of the TANF program. You still get most-all of your TANF money EVEN if the father doesn't pay in a given month. This isn't true of court-ordered support obtained outside the TANF program. In some states, TANF can help with employment and training opportunities, and help you get federally-funded childcare. Also, if you're afraid to seek support for fear of the father hurting you or the child, TANF can usually waive this requirement, offer you supportive services, and you'd still get the TANF money. TANF also comes with automatic medical insurance for you and your child.  If you think you can get a bigger support order (I.e. - if the father has/still has a really good job), then TANF probably isn't for you, BUT it's still worth it to apply if for no other reason than to get an idea of your options (caseworkers will let you know about these during the TANF interview process).  Another option to look into is a program called Diversion Cash Assistance, which some states participate in. This is similar to TANF, but doesn't have nearly as many requirements. In a working single pregnant woman's situation, it could potentially give you some money to help pay your bills if you have to take a few months off from work for unpaid maternity leave.  There are a lot of rules, and they vary vastly by state, so I'd recommend checking with your local Welfare/Assistance Office to find if there's a program that's right for you. Even if there isn't a government program that can help, experienced caseworkers usually know about potential private organizations that can help."

Anytime I edit a timecard is someone thought they clocked back in for lunch and timestamp didn't actually record it or someone clocked in twice because they thought the first one didn't go through. If you really think managers are messing with your timecard keep record of what time you clock in during the week and check it with time manager to see if it matches up. I just know at my store no one would clock someone for a break if they didn't take it

I know this because LP and my DM told me, naming you specifically and that my post on behind the button triggered your investigation. Everyone involved (except you of course) thought my criticism was valid, presented in an objective way, and did not know why you got so worked up over it to personally investigate my diag and try to pin something on me.  Honestly, I'm surprised you got so worked up over it too, normally you are pretty cool and level headed.  Maybe you were having a bad week or something.   They said Staples needed people like me (I'm good at both fixing things and have great customer relations), that no punishment was to come of it, that everyone involved thought it was a waste of time and resources, and were annoyed that they had to take time out of their already busy schedule to deal with what they saw as an act of pettiness.    Of course LP told me not to use unauthorized software, but with a wink-wink-nudge-nudge-keep-doing-what-your-doing undertone because at the end of the day my tech dept was very profitable and getting outstanding TSATs.  If it ain't broke don't fix it, and definitely don't try to break it."

In my job (Retail Field Services), I'd say it's the fix anywhere from 45-55% of the time. In a job where we use tons of different software, hardware, and peripherals.   Also, for what it's worth for those working in ET for barely nothing, I  had an interview about 8 months back for a helpdesk job for an IT company, and in the interview I was asked to troubleshoot a few hypothetical scenarios that the interviewer (Also the helpdesk lead) came up with. One of the scenarios was literally solved by turning the computer off and back on. The guy interviewing me said that, of the half dozen or so people they'd interviewed before me, NONE of them had gotten that one right.  The job was for 35 grand salaried and really, really great benefits (day one, too). I wound up getting a slightly better offer somewhere else, but yeah.   Also, most helpdesk techs HAVE to read off a script before doing anything else. It ensures that nothing gets missed, solves a very high chunk of issues, and takes you what, 2-3 minutes more to just go through with what they need to check off on? It's not that big of a deal."

Best targets are people who come in clearly for a small business;  buying multiple office chairs, a ton of file folders and cabinets etc etc. Or people buying electronics. Lots of people buying computers won't bite, but you don't need everyone to. Yoy just need like, 1 in 25 offers to bite and you are still golden.

You will begin at the call center and most likely stay there for a month or two through training and starting. From there you can be assigned a schedule for either early morning, late morning, or afternoon.  If you have the talent you can be offered the opportunity to work from home, however you will still report to the call center regularly.  Its a developing department, so things can change drastically with little information. However it is improving and becoming more stable.  Daily routine can change, I myself can touch between 50 and 100 systems per day however I can generally resolve between 24-35 jobs at moderate pace. Most often you will be responsible for 8-16 jobs at a time.  You are monitored and audited on nearly every job, including the ability to check phone calls. You generally cannot work outside the Job aid and follow a process.  Unapproved tool users are generally quickly chastised.  Now that the 'Bad' sounding things are out of the way. Its fairly stable now though the hours can be odd. Workflow can adjust rapidly each week and hours are adjusted to match so somedays you might not work a full 8 but others you may work 12.  It becomes repetitive and routine very quickly, but can be an enjoyable job with great people and management."

No, actually the best move is to close unnecessary stores but the change into Ecommerce as a primary focus is a 5 year plan in the least with completion in 10 years at most.

Most people who enter stores are the older generation now a day, which is not a booming market. Instead majority of those who are active in the economy are younger and prefer an online market.  Staples shifting into a more profitable business plan, I don't see that as a weaker form. I would see serving a minority market as inadequate."

None of these things can be done well online.  They cannot be replaced by an online marketplace, at least until we have matter-energy transports and can just beam inventory into a home. Businesspeople still have needs that have to be met offline. As a chain we give lip service to being all about meeting their needs but we have played ""me-too"" on so many levels and cut our staff down to the bone so badly we can't even fulfil that mandate. The online version of Staples will be just another .com. It will not be the best at what it does. It will not be a premier destination. It will not fill that niche, not the way it is now.  If they want to win that game, they will need same day delivery in all major metropolitan markets, and amazon is poised to get there first. Once they do it's game over.

I do understand what you are saying, but I would agree that a bad wage for what you do will ultimately end up with poor job satisfaction. Currency is the equivalent of our trade value now; if you aren't valued, you can't trade for other goods whether it be groceries, transportation, housing or entertainment. I think a lot of people see their retail job as a means to get by rather than something they are passionate about.  Personally, if wage wasn't an issue, I would like to see a company who does more to grow their employees and work with their team rather than have such a large barrier between the front lines and the higher ups. They keep restructuring to create better efficiency in their stores, but in doing so they have really laid off a lot of their talent. I just don't think they are fostering a work force that cares about their job or their work often because they don't feel like their management really cares about them. A lot of people are good at certain metrics or certain tasks, but as soon as you don't keep up with the newest hot item AND your other metrics, you are lectured about your performance. So, to summarize, if I felt like my company was really a team that cared about their employees as much as they care about the bottom line, I would enjoy it a lot more. However, it is a business and I know that staying in business is the highest priority. I just wish they didn't step on their associates to make more happen."

Staples,3a36ly,TEEHEE_NYC87,2,Tue Jun 16 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"What I dislike is the constant force-feeding of numbers (I'm tech sales) without any coaching to improve.  Like, it's nice you have the time to spent 13 or 15 minutes chewing me out for my dry sales, but what I'd love is if we could spend that time trying to: 1: What went wrong? 2: How should we fix it?  Everyone hates someone who has problems but no solutions to propose, and that's what gets me down. Everyone brings me the problems, but nobody gives any quarter for solutions.  I'm a person who hates being bad at their work. There's also some things I simply do not understand about it and I have no idea what the deal is. IE: I sell like piss. I understand the vagaries of personal hygiene and speaking with people politely. I have a coworker who probably doesn't even know what a shower is, and yet, somehow, people buy like crazy from her.   I'd absolutely love to know what it is that makes that happen.  So, anyhow, in summation, I hate the issues surrounding my job that are outside of my power to fix. I want to do well, but I can't seem to figure it out. I can't get coaching to do it, but I get pissed on for doing poorly. Basically, I'm bad at it but I get no help to improve and plenty of criticism for not being good at it. I'd rather the effort be spent on helping me get better.  Really, my only other gripe is I tend to handle a lot of the part-timers, myself included, but they're all millenials who obviously don't give two shits about if they get fired or not. So I spend a lot of time breaking up huddles or otherwise trying to keep things productive. I also have to cover a lot of call-outs for people being wasted as shit, which I'm frequently lied to so I do (Oh, they're on vacation. They're sick. They're out of the city.) I wouldn't cover them if they were just getting drunk. I'm not spending my time to accommodate that."

I've tried everything to try and improve my sales aside from shady stuff, but I really just can't ever get it going on a consistent basis. I'll have my weeks were I get on a nice run, but more often than not I'm struggling to meet my store individual minimum.   There are things that I do well that has earned enough of the respect of some of the managers where they let it slid to a certain extent, but I hate thinking about how badly I'm doing and how I might be letting my team down. My supervisor has advised me from time to time, but for the most part my SSM just tells me that I've got to sell more and that's it. No real advice and what not. I could go to some of my coworkers that sell more to get advice, but the ones I work with most either sell at the same rate I do or do sketchy things to get sales."

It was easy and stress free coming off a really bad work experience then got so messy lawyers were involved. Over time I started to hate it. They were not accommodating of my university schedule, fast tracked me into a department I knew nothing about and had no interest in (tech) and the recent changes with how sales performance is gauged has made this place hell.  I hate this two faced approach where they keep pretending that they care about the customer, but if I make a customer happy without them buying anything, I'm penalized. I don't even care that much about the customers, and if they would just drop the ""we care"" front and straight up tell us that it actually is, in fact, only about sales, I;d hate it a lot less, because at least I wouldn't feel dishonest when I'm forced to parrot the company line to shoppers"

Hope they get back to you and avoid a lot of shrink. IF they had an order for another PC the email or phone should work.. Make sure to tell them they got a worse PC and maybe they'll come back. Your GM may have to give a giftcard or something to both for the mixup, but it would be much better than the current situation."
Staples,3a2hc7,risunokairu,3,Tue Jun 16 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"Is it a work order PC something on the bench or just an online order shipped to the store because I think most of the replies are for an online order shipped to the store.  A work order PC at the bench should have a lot of information to contact the customer who, when they dropped it off, probably wasn't thinking about taking someone else's, so more then likely they gave real info.  Now it sucks because someone has the other customers PC with their info on it but either way it's not your fault and that's something the GM gets paid to handle.  But if it's an online order refund the customer it belonged too and order another one then keep the other one as a gift because it was paid for by the customer you can't reach, maybe not that last part, but this ends the same way, let the GM handle it that's what they're paid to do."

Staples,3a2ui3,lolstaplesanon,3,Tue Jun 16 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, this! Have them run the offline install. Setup account with customer on pickup (takes less than 5 minutes). I've done this dozens of times and it is the most foolproof method.   For all of you suggesting creating Microsoft accounts...bad idea. Two things happen: 1. Customer forgets info, and you are constantly being called to look it up, or 2. You piss off the customer who didn't want another email address.   Offline install, register at pickup. Easy peasy."

If you're like 99% of other Easytechs you break policy all the time with the flash drive of portable programs you likely have on your key ring, why care about it now with office.  There are 2 easy options here.   Don't install Office and tell the customers you can't. Create a microsoft account for the customer with the password ""Staples123"" and put that information in the closing notes, save it to their desktop and make sure office.com will keep them signed in.   Why re-invent the wheel?  http://postimg.org/image/b33h67f1d/ There is the link. Read where they need to be present in order to create the MS account.  Don't blame the Matrix agents, blame the associate who performed the intake improperly. And then tell your GM to go write them up for failing to execute the PC Intake Process properly rather than yell at you.  drops the mic"
Staples,3a2ui3,lolstaplesanon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:42:45 2015 UTC,It's a security risk for customers to give us all that info. Just explain that to them. I have had very little push back from customers that it's for their safety we don't do it.
Staples,3a2ui3,ienom,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:35:55 2015 UTC,"When I register Office, I just create a Microsoft account for the customer with an outlook.com email address comprised of the first three letters of their first name and the first three letters of their last name and the last 4 digits of their telephone number. I use May 2nd 1986 as the birthday because that is the date that Staples was born. Password is their first name with a capital, an exclamation point, their last name and their zip code. I use the store telephone number and no alternate email address. I have made a template WordPad document on the diag PC where I can easily print out the information. It advises the customer that we had to create an account on their behalf, however they can log in and change this information. I also note that this account information is only related to their Microsoft Office account. Otherwise if they just wanted us to install Office and they already had a Microsoft account linked to the computer I would just do it with them when they picked it up. Reason I usually make an account for the customer is because it can take a while to do it at the bench, and for some reason 90% of the time I also end up having to call the activation telephone number. I always want it to be easiest as possible for the customer, our client base is 75% elderly the other 25% is either a business contact, or a cheap low life (were pretty close to some ghettos). Both of which can be extreme arrogant. Most of them come to pick up their computers with only 5 minutes to spare for some ""thing"" they need to do. This doesn't usually leave me enough time to show them everything we performed, nevermind trying to set up a MS account and activate office. On the off chance the techs didn't create an account and they do leave without creating an account they will almost for sure be calling me as soon as they get home because they can't use office and ""we didn't do our job"".. almost always ends in refunding the customer the full setup fee.

This is the most likely cause for a missing check.  If the expense report is missing or has an incorrect date, odometer reading pre-trip, odomoter reading post-trip, or OMS work order number, it may be rejected.  By clicking on ""Approval Flow"" in Ariba under the submitted expense report, you'll be able to see if it was rejected for any reason.  If it was rejected: supply the appropriate information, and resubmit.  However, if this is not the case, I believe that the contact information for Ariba should also be available through that site's dashboard.  Barring that, you could try submitting an e-ticket."

""You can get SquareTrade for an extra $40!"" (with one combo, I can't remember what though.) Be enthusiastic about it, even if you're spouting BS.  However, don't spout BS. Telling a customer that the C55-B5270 (which, if memory serves, has a Pentium) is going to handle their AutoCAD is bad. Very bad. Like, hot alert because the customer was wrongfully sold a shit computer bad. Which is bad.  For attachments, don't lie or be misinformed. If you're not sure, ""Give me just a moment, I'm going to go check <x fact>."" The customer will (theoretically) appreciate the time that you take to properly inform them and will hopefully be more open to attachments.  Market basket is sometimes ridiculously easy, and sometimes it just doesn't happen. Take the ones you can get, and don't struggle to sell a router to the guy whose router is 2 months old. Some customers simply don't need or want a mouse, and that's okay because there's always a customer that does want it. On that note, don't be robotic about your sales. Work it into the conversation; there is no one formula to introduce Virus Shield or Squaretrade. (Although an excellent opener for either is a previous issue with the area the service covers. ""Oh, you're looking for a new computer because your old one is virus-ridden? Here, let me show you Virus Shield.""  I often sell Virus Shield by emphasizing the cost of a Diag/Repair versus a Virus Shield. On new and existing PCs, it's simple. $160 for two years, or $160 for one time. It's sometimes tougher to sell on existing PCs, just because they've already paid $160 and it seems (to me at least) like a scam. Oh well. Convince yourself that the initial Diag/Repair on existing Virus Shield is not a bad thing and you're golden.  The customer will not believe you unless you believe yourself.  Anyways, market basket: not every customer needs to be walked over to routers. Some have mice in a drawer, or an Office 2010 disk they like. Don't push these; you might lose the entire sale (or at least the attachments) if you make them mad.  Hopefully this helps, and if not, oh well. I've only been selling (and working) for about a year now, so if I can do it (admittedly with a ton of prior tech knowledge) then you probably can as well. Try to have fun with it, and don't let the failures get you down. I know more than anyone in my store that failure sucks, and I suck at failing. Nonetheless, it's the successes that count. Get right back up after every punch and keep going.  Edit: SPACING SPACING SPACING."

Staples,39xfmo,easytechwtf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"I prioritize my work by doing it in order of what has the longest gaps in between steps. LONG SORRY  For example:  On my bench, I come in at noon (working til 8) and find I have the following tickets:  1) Virus removal  2) Total setup (ignore my terminology, I haven't been with staples in 4 years)  3) Windows password reset  4) Power supply install  5) Software upgrade  6) Unknown problem, computer won't start  So my triage sense goes like this.    Start the virus removal, boot the system up and begin scanning for viruses, to see what I am dealing with. (10-15min to get going) Plug in the unknown problem, start with everything plugged in and turn the machine on... Nothing happens (5 min) Put the software upgrade on the bench, turn on, and see if i need to back up and config files/etc for the software (for example, you can import your old settings from Dragon Naturally dictate to the newer version, so the person won't need to redo all the training in order to use the voice activation software.  This saves the client 10-20 hours, and will make them damned happy) (10-15min) Total Setup goes on the bench and starts the boot up process (10 min)   At this point, at the store I used to work at, this would fill my bench up (assuming i was using a keyboard and monitor for each station, and they weren't laptops... but I'll just assume my bench is full at this point)   Go back to the unknown problem, test the power supply (we'll say it passes).  Start unplugging unnecessary devices (say a video card, 1 hard drive, optical drive, and 3 sticks of ram) 15-20 minutes Switch over to the virus removal and see the progress, we'll assume that's is a run of the mill virus, and not some serious rootkit BS.  At this point, i'll call the customer, and most likely leave them a message regarding the options for their PC (I don't always do a full wipe and reinstall, because I'm able to get rid of most basic viruses through the use of regular tools).  Give them the option of a total wipe and default reconfiguration of their computer, a straight virus removal, and ask them whether they want their files backed up or anything else saved, 15 minutes Finish off the software upgrade pc, take off the bench, and notify the customer (15 minutes) Grab the power supply install, throw it up on the bench Switch back over to the setup, get everything configured, and the system doing updates. 30 minutes Back to the PSU swap, unplug all the components of the old power supply, and plug the new unit in (without installing it in the chassis), and test to see everything works.  I'll assume it does.  Install the PSU, tie the wires up neatly, and call the customer (30-45 min).  This system is taken off the bench. Grab the windows password reset, and put it on the bench. Check the virus removal and setup, see how they're doing, and take a 15 minute break.   At this point, we'd likely start our afternoon rush, so i'd be double-dutying tech bench and floor support.   Do the password reset (go and replace the sticky keys exe with the cmd prompt, change the password, and replace the sticky keys with the original file again), call the customer and let them know the system is ready. 15 minutes.   So I have the virus removal, and the setup left on the bench at this point.  The setup should be finished at this point.  Call customer for pickup 15 minutes  so after this, it's just managing what comes in.  At the end of the day, anything that still takes a while to run (such as file backups, hard drive repairs, etc) will get run overnight - much to the dismay of my GM (i had to tell her, it saves like 3-4 hours of one bench computer spot, and convince her it was worthwhile, but it's worth the fight in my mind)"
Staples,39xfmo,john_dune,2,Mon Jun 15 17:58:39 2015 UTC,"My GM was talking to a customer one time who had their kid change their windows password, and wouldn't tell the parent the new password.   So she was trying to convince this woman that she needed to have a total repair done and the computer would be wiped, and she'd lose all her data (cause the password encrypted everything, and without it you couldn't recover any data, naturally).  I interrupted my GM, and told this woman that my GM was misinformed, and took her aside, and told her that I could fix the password for a 15 minute charge ($25), it would take me 15 minutes and that everything was safe and not lost.    I thought the woman was going to break down crying right there.  Afterwords, I talked to my GM and told her in no short words to not give technical advice to customers, because she had no idea what she was talking about, and that she should come grab me at the first sign of a technical question.  Needless to say, not long after that the GM found every excuse in the book to fire me because she didn't like me (well, that and I caught her being racist against jews ((which my background is)), but that's a whole different story, and i digress)"

Staples,39xfmo,kirashi3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:27:28 2015 UTC,"I'm based in the US but for a while I've been the only tech. Got promoted to tech supervisor about a month ago and haven't had another tech in until this week finally to start training. As a full timer with no other help in tech I do end up spending a lot of time up at the bench or over in the aisle with computers talking to customers. During prime time im told to stay away from the bench as much as possible and try to do so but sometimes i have so many things I have going on there that it's not possible.  Question 1:  Is there any other EasyTech out there that work alone?  Answer: Yes, myself and many others are or have been without other techs for extended periods of time. Normally only smaller stores but my smaller store makes up for it by being in a prime location with tons of people coming in for computers or to have them serviced.   Question 2: What do you do when you start in the morning?  Answer: Usually scheduled 4 days out of the week at 9-5 and Saturday 1-8 for tag night because i'm the only one who knows how to do tech tags that isn't a manager that is busy doing managerial things come that time. When I open (9am) the first thing I do is make sure all the computers are on matrix being worked on and check the notes in the OMS to see if they've added anything and reconnect any that may have gotten knocked off for some reason. Next I check the work on the ones that are complete and close them out and print pickup paperwork if there's nothing further to be done and wait a little while to call them because its still very early and they may be asleep and mad if i wake them up. After I check all the computers and have an idea of what's going on there I head out to the floor and am a presence for the customers to see because we are very understaffed and always hear them complaining there is no one to help them because we never have enough store hours to have someone in office supplies. We usually just have a cashier who has to stay up front, a tech (me), copy center worker and a manager (2 if were lucky). Office supply people are in about 3 days a week so I try to make my rounds around the store and be available for anyone. If there's small freight left I always have it in shopping carts and i push that out and finish it up while helping customers. Then prime time rolls around (11-3 for us here) and I put any freight stuff away other than maybe a basket worth or something and do it that way but I make sure to help customers as much as possible during PT.   Question 3: What do you do before and after lunch?  Answer: I never know when I'm going to get a lunch unfortunately because I'm so busy there's no telling what time it'll be for example yesterday I didn't make it to lunch until 4:00 and I leave at 5:00. So I don't do anything special before or after lunch I just continue my day as is but 3:00-5:00 is when I spend the most time behind the tech bench working on whatever is there to make sure it gets done. I'm off Tuesdays and another day of the week that usually changes based on when they least need me (assistant manager knows enough about tech to hold it down while i'm gone from a sales and tech intake standpoint). So I have to plan ahead of time on what I have to get done when I have a day off the next day and make sure to get everything done.  Question 4: What do you do before the end of your shift?  Answer: Before the end of my shift I make sure everything that needs to be is connected to matrix and check the notes again to make sure they didn't leave a note about not being able to connect or something. I also check their power plans just to be sure that they're not going to go to sleep if i have something else going on on them. I'm not required to do recover on the nights that I don't close which is most nights but I like to do a quick one anyway because tech dept will look like shit otherwise.   All that is filled with customers dragging me here and there and computers coming in and all the standard stuff but tried to answer those specific questions. Also try to manage my mid and top stock as much as possible but since I've been the only one for awhile now I don't have much opportunity to. Another side note is that I come in 2 hours before we open on sunday's and works hard as I can to get all the big tech freight done and get the small stuff sorted out of the totes and into 2 (usually) shopping carts to be ready to go right after prime time. If you have any other questions feel free to reply and I'll do my best to answer. Best of luck to ya!"
Staples,39xfmo,easytechwtf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:32:41 2015 UTC,"I'm the only easy tech at our store. Our supervisor got arrested and stopped showing up and HR said we couldn't fire him until his conviction (sounds like BS to me). I close, so I told my GM to have other people do my freight. I'll work on/verify any computers that are marked as done by the Matrix or require manual work. I then do pull lists and block the rest of the night to close. I tell my GM to make sure that the MOD checks messages in OMS to make sure that PCs are always connected to Matrix so that they're mostly done by the time I come in."
Staples,39vw0l,IJustWorkHereStaples,10,Mon Jun 15 05:47:32 2015 UTC,"I've worked for multiple retail companies, all of whom used RGIS to do their inventory counts.  I've found, if your store is 100% prepared for inventory, that RGIS is mostly effective - if you've labeled every demo as ""DO NOT INVENTORY"" and written the SKU on every box with number of items in the box in the mids/tops, they can handle that.  If you've gone through your huge inventory section pre-count and scanned yourself to make sure every item has a scannable barcode, they're pretty much fine.  But of course... this is Staples.  They don't allot the hours needed to properly prepare for inventory (or anything, really).  If it were me, I'd allow the IA overtime for the two/three weeks prior to inventory, and let the person who knows the inventory best get ready.  This, of course, would cost money up front in paying the IA, but would relieve days of post-counts by usually 3 managers (GM and the moderating GM, plus at least one AM).  Of course, in Staples' mind, the GM's are salaried so they're not costing more to make the two of them work their tails off after the count.  Especially when they have the one AM work so much extra to fix inventory that, by the end of the week, the AM is out of hours and the GM has to work open-to-close a couple days.    There is so much screwed up with Staples processes, but inventory prep might be the worst.  I've seen other companies do so much better using the same crappy third party counters, so the breakdown isn't the inventory company.  It's the preparedness of the store they are counting in."
Staples,39vw0l,YouHadMeAtDucks,3,Mon Jun 15 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"VERY well said. Your prep is huge when talking inventory. Having DNI signs, and using sku labels on your demo machines and having an ET walk with the person doing the Electronics count helps too. They will always fuck shit up, but if you have done a truly good prep, it makes it so much easier."
Staples,39vw0l,rons_moustache,2,Mon Jun 15 15:16:12 2015 UTC,"So in reality the GMs and AMs fix the errors? If so, them why do they have our whole staff (besides cpc) fixing this shit.

Staples,39vw0l,elentirion,5,Mon Jun 15 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"As IA, you're biased.  As that store's associate, or possibly any store nearby's associate, you'd be biased.  That's what it comes down to.  Yes, you may know where everything is in the store, but you deal with it every day.  The reasoning is that an impartial third party comes in and counts, making it fair on everyone.  Now, that the third party workers are so inept at their jobs doesn't factor into things even though it should.  In my area at least, there are two available companies.  Neither is much better than the other, and it's a horrible selection to choose from.  The alternative would be shuttling competent Staples employees in from elsewhere, but that would probably cost more money (transport, housing, food)."

Staples,39vw0l,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,2,Mon Jun 15 13:26:32 2015 UTC,Whoever we had was just as bad as RGIS. Had them redo a few sections during the red flag area double checking that night. Accuracy doesn't seem to count at all!
Staples,39vw0l,playnotwork,3,Tue Jun 16 11:02:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but as far as the inventory goes, they're just supposed to come in and count. It's not their job to assume anything or to sort through anything. All of the sorting, marking differences between SKUs, tagging demo units, doing pre-counts on clearance (if there are no UPCs), etc. should have been done prior to the third party getting there.  HOWEVER, I will agree with you that they screw the pooch on regular occasion. Our store spent a good two weeks preparing, and had everything as ready as probably any other store in the company, and third party still f****d up. It happens. But you can prevent 70% of it by preparing for it properly."

If the cards do not have an EMV Chip the issuer will be responsible for any fraud. At least at my store we don't have the EMV readers, I'll assume this means that we will be getting them soon before October."
Staples,39ukyb,bopisalert,2,Mon Jun 15 00:17:12 2015 UTC,"Canadian here. We've had EMV cards for over 4 years and what you say is true. We still let our customers perform payment, but help them ... Um... Get it in. Their card, I mean. In the machine. It's up to them to process the transaction though, however incompetent they may be in following the prompts. (Our machines ask you to ""OK?""

Staples,39ukyb,T00l_shed,2,Mon Jun 15 03:27:28 2015 UTC,"According to a new regulation which BTW the credit card companies are fighting, if the card doesn't have a chip the credit card company is responsible for all fraud which I believe would include merchant fraud charging the customers card without permisson. This starts in October. Technically today we are supposed to verify the signature on the back of the card, if there is no signature on the card, we are to decline it as again technically cards without a signature are void. That being said, if its not signed most merchants will just ask for ID to verify but technically we are not supposed to."

Its 50 cents per page and accounts for all the hand work of pulling/reinserting staples, sticky notes, hand collating etc. Its supposed to only be used by production centers but no one ever said anything when we used them at my store.  I'd always tell the customer, its litigation, its 50 cents per page and its a minimum of 24 hrs (or 48, or 72 etc) depending on how much stuff they were dropping off, but never less than 24 hrs. If its done earlier we can call them and let them know. I would also let them know if they remove all the staples and post-its and just hand me a stack of paper with no extra work involved I can fire it through while they wait since the auto feeder will do all the work. If they want to stand there and get everything in a neat little pile it saves you time, if they want you run it at 50 cents a page it makes you more money and it puts the decision on the customer."
Staples,39vgi3,ShenanigansAllDay,2,Mon Jun 15 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"Corporate wants us charging for everything so just tell the customers there are extra charges for everything and most of the time, they will do it themselves. Or if im backed up, i tell then itll be an extra 5 or 10 bucks for me to organize their mess. Again, they do it themselves in most cases.   Just remember that you control what you do and have to control turn arounds so work within your means and over estimate times so you can keep things under control."
Staples,39vgi3,frostybarnacle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"I would charge a hand staple x 2 for each one. One for removing, one for restapling.

Staples,39u9cj,KawaiiJohnny1988,2,Sun Jun 14 20:48:31 2015 UTC,"A 5 at my old store and a 13 at my new store when I took over the walk.  Before I did I told the person who was doing it, they weren't shooting a real number because I could tell, and they complained to the Assistant Manager who told me I shouldn't accuse them of anything, I told the GM and they said for now let it pass then it got so bad we decided I would do it and before I could fix the floor and shoot a real number our DM took a counter from the aisle and started counting the holes which didn't match the last walk and I got in trouble for it cuz as the IS I'm responsible for the number no matter who does it.  So I had to do the ZB walk without fixing the issues and the 13 was what I shot it took 2 weeks to get it down to a 1.10 and then another to average a .86"

They should have came down on the GM instead, for letting it get so bad."
Staples,39u9cj,rons_moustache,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:55:21 2015 UTC,"One of my old GM's would shoot it pretty regularly, but I don't think he did it because it was the rule but more so out of necessity because our IS at the time was always late, called out, or just not responsible enough to do the job in general.  So basically our GM, Ops Manager, or me would shoot 1/2 of the ZB's depending who was opening."

Staples,39u9cj,WorshipGuyFieri,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:04:05 2015 UTC,"It's basically a percentage. If you shoot a .5, then .5% of all your skus are either empty when they shouldn't be, have an out of stock tag when there shouldn't be, or weren't scanned during the ZB walk. Company policy is below a .8. When my old GM was around and 3rd party COMPLETELY fucked up our OS reflow (all items thrown into totes and never re-stocked and planos were almost 50% incorrect) we shot N/A which basically means that your shit is so bad you look like your out of bidness (which we did).

Staples,39rk17,Keleris,2,Sun Jun 14 04:29:06 2015 UTC,"I read that one too but then in their ""About Us"" page I read this - ""Reed Smith represents many of the world's leading companies in complex litigation and other high-stakes disputes, cross-border and other strategic transactions, and crucial regulatory matters. With lawyers from coast-to-coast in the United States, as well as in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, Reed Smith is known for its experience across a broad array of industry sectors. Reed Smith counsels 13 of the world's 15 largest commercial and savings banks; 25 of the world's 35 largest oil and gas companies; and the world's three largest pharmaceutical distribution and wholesale companies.""  So it's not a news agency it's an advocate for large corporations and the writing is more of a legal opinion in opposition of the current Maryland Tax Court ruling.  Reeds Smiths opinion could be used in the appeal but at this moment the article I linked to is fair and accurate because it's what happened.  It does not take a stand on whether the courts ruling was just or not, it does what news should do, state the facts as they are without personal opinion either way.  The outcome of the case is yet to be determined.  So in essence it is not a ""better source"" it is a biased source."

Staples,39pd2y,FaxForRA,7,Sat Jun 13 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"I would go with just B) it's the emails for marketing and you can sell that information to third party advertisers.  The saving paper part is the BS they say because ""We want to sell your information"" sounds sinister."
Staples,39pd2y,elentirion,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:40:54 2015 UTC,"Not all locations accept that format, just as a heads up.  Most do, but not all.  Found this out because I try to do the same thing."

It should be an option on the card reader if they want one like most places do. It's such a ""signature experience"" when you have to spend 10 minutes a transaction asking a billion questions,  in reality the customer wants to get in and get out."
Staples,39pd2y,aint_got_time4_dat,5,Sun Jun 14 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"I agree! signature experience is supposed to include a speedy check out but having slow registers, digital receipts where you are having to verify member info, then verify email Again even though they just verified it in the member details. Sucks! Add it to the card reader for God sake. And digital receipts don't save paper, because of all the people who get one, 99% of them want a paper one too."
Staples,39pd2y,jtshadow92,3,Sat Jun 13 16:52:01 2015 UTC,THIS!!!!!!!! My boss will literally stand there and watch me and pick at every single thing I do at register.

Staples,39pd2y,elentirion,5,Mon Jun 15 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"Well yes to save paper/money but also to get out the option for customers to subscribe to Staples emails. No it doesn't automatically enroll you in marketing blasts.  And your managers are probably freaking out about it because DMs are screaming at GMs to get everyone to send digital receipts, and RVPs are screaming at DMs, and etc.  *not literally screaming but you get the idea"
Staples,39pd2y,venturer95,3,Mon Jun 15 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't automatically enroll you in marketing blasts.   If that's the case, things have changed recently.  Had to personally unsubscribe from them twice from the same account before they stopped coming."

Staples,39pd2y,BubbleWrapLampShade,4,Sun Jun 14 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"Something to know...  If you have rewards number on a receipt with Square Trade, it will use the rewards information to register the plan. Customer will get email from ST about a week after the transaction. That email will also say something to the effect if they click here they can have ST store the receipt too so they needn't worry about losing it. Here's the neat part... IF they got a digital copy of said receipt, they can simply email per instructions on that linked page.  No scanning, photographing or anything is needed except forwarding already digital copy."
Staples,39pd2y,metalrader,4,Sun Jun 14 14:00:01 2015 UTC,"If they wanted to save paper they wouldn't print out five feet of bullshit after every receipt. It hasn't been really bad since the Katy Perry promotion, but it can still get pretty fucking ridiculous. The worst one, ironically, is the little tiny one that tells you to sign up for text coupons. I don't think I've ever actually given that little stupid one to a single customer, ever, and even if someone gets one with their receipt I can't imagine a single person even paying attention to it, especially if they had a rebate with their purchase."

Staples,39pd2y,assilym24,3,Sat Jun 13 23:12:54 2015 UTC,My understanding was that digital receipts act as a failsafe for the company to maintain an online presence once the physical stores sink. Kiosk sales promotions and lots of stores having sales on items they aren't very well stocked on are evidence to the concept imo.

I like to think I help them out big time and make the store look good. I usually do about 5-10 surveys a month for them. Even more than that during game release season.

At my store (before I left) they were right next to the doors to the warehouse, and we started finding packaging of high ticket items in them.    This was obviously someone breaking down load stealing.  For a customer to steal them, they would have to get through a lock box or into high ticket, then transport the packaging to a location that was in the line of sight of our register 1, which ALWAYS had someone at it.    It made for more sense that an employee stole high ticket items before (or during) load breakdown and stash the packaging just outside the wearhouse.    Oh, and after word spread around the store of that discovery, the packaging stopped showing up there.

It was a huge pain in the ass and we have to constantly fill our toner.

I got my check yesterday, looked at the pay stub and realized that I had only received pay for 25.00 hours. On the dot. I opened up MyTimeManager again and found that not only did they just adjust my time to knock it down to 25, but completely rearranged my schedule to shifts that I didn't even work. No clue why they did that, but it happened. And, since it was last pay period, it automatically approved the punches because I couldn't deny them."
Staples,39lazr,EJWygal1989,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:13:19 2015 UTC,"The schedule in MyTimeManager isn't always correct, so you can ignore that, but the hours cut down is a massive red flag. I don't stand for that kind of dishonestly from my fellow managers, so sorry you had that issue.  Have you made your GM aware of this? Please feel free to message me directly if you need any advice in resolving this.  Also, word of advice from a former part-timer.. check your timecard after you clock out for the last time each week, and print it out. Any discrepancies in your final pay, and you have a record of the correct info."

That tends to stop that behavior right quick, otherwise the store gets compensated for the time.  My longest one was six hours or so.  Four computers, a few printers, services for each, and I'd only brought so many flash drives.  Took a while.  Worst one was my fault, sadly.  Same customer, the printer we'd set up on another onsite lost network connection.  No control panel though, so needed to run through the PC to reconnect.  Done.  Add a static IP...except I switched a critical number around and assigned a static IP outside the network possibilities.  Took me forever to figure out how to reset the network settings from the printer, then reconnect it to the network.  Then triple-check the IP address settings I was putting in this time around."

I did probably 50+ in my 2 and a half years (Was pretty much never the only COT at my stores, surprisingly) and I never walked away feeling like I could've died. Onsites were probably the most purely enjoyable aspect of working at Staples. In fact, I'd say they were the reason I specifically wanted a Field Services job when I started looking for a real IT job.  Had some pretty sweet onsites come to think of it. Multiple $100 tip trips, built a couple connections with other technicians that realized they could get help for a third the price of a contracted solo guy, had a tendency to have really great heart to heart conversations with people about life, always had fun with the older people I would go out to. One dude thought he was supposed to insert the setup DVD into the part of the printer that  stamped images onto blank DVDs, took everything I had to not laugh at him.  My first on-site ever was probably my worst, come to think of it. I had been working at Staples for like, 3 or 4 months, and legit did not know how to set up a printer wirelessly. Also did not have a car. My Ops manager DROVE ME TO THIS ONSITE. Old mean woman, probably 80ish. Didn't really know what she wanted. I tried setting it up wirelessly, gave up, set it up wired instead. She asked me if I could take out her shredder trash and I thought it would be an easy way to get a tip. Got nothing :(  Best part is, about 2 years later, as a team supervisor I get asked to cover for our COT's onsite cuz he called out. Very last onsite I would ever do... It was back at that same person's house. Except this time the husband was there, who was one of the nicest people I'd ever met. Got tipped $25 IIRC for about 35 minutes of work and 2 hours of sitting around talking :)"

Staples,39iqlb,EasyTechJanitor,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"Last week I did an onsite. I called the lady shortly before departing to confirm appointment and to get an idea as to what is wrong with her computer.   She sounds older and definitely technology illiterate. She states that when she turns on her computer, nothing happens. She just sees a rainbow. So I am thinking anywhere between the windows 8 splash screen to fried video. I ask her if her keyboard/mouse are wireless. She sounds confused and says ""I think they are wired"" after I ask her 'do they physically connect to the computer?'  I head out not really knowing what to expect. She was charged for trip ($100) and Diag & Repair ($160).   I arrived at her house and she is just a sweet old lady. Nice as ever. I take a quick look. The 'rainbow' was the windows 8 splash screen. However the cursor was unresponsive. I replace the batteries on her wireless mouse and I the problem is resolved.  I run a quick intake scan and no flags come up. I start to feel a bit guilty. $260 to change batteries is a bit steep. I tell her I need to grab some paperwork out of my car. In reality, I'm just looking for a way to call my GM and see if we can give this lady a break.  My GM says no break initially. I argue with him a bit and he finally concedes and agrees to knock off the trip fee. $160 to change this poor old ladies batteries. I was there for 18 minutes total. Such a fucking fraud. Good business that cares about the customer would have waived the D&R and at most charge for the trip  That was the last straw. Fuck this company. The next day I went and got a job back in the restaurant business. Not sure if I can finish out my 2 weeks. I am on lunch at the moment and its taking every bit of will power not to walk out.  I am also debating scooping some numbers of customers I built relationships with to help establish my own consult/repair company.

It's always foolish not to tough it out for 2 measly weeks to leave peacefully. I'm glad you had the integrity to give her back some of the money. I would've also installed classic shell so it took her straight to the desktop and wouldn't take her to the metro screen if she clicked the start menu so she wouldn't be so confused but all in all sounds like you did a good job.

Staples,39hdpx,RoughHands,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:00:43 2015 UTC,"Flash drives. I absolutely hate when those come up on the cycle count. So many, in so many places, so much shrink."
Staples,39hdpx,Versklavt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah. Flash drives were definetely the worst. After that is without a doubt, pc games. The shrink was just horrendous."
Staples,39hdpx,johnnnymfgroh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"My worst money-wise Cycles are always Toner. I swear the warehouse can't send the right amount. And they're like $60-100+ each! In terms of most annoying, I'd go with Mobile chargers. By this point I know ALL of them, but there are so many."
Staples,39hdpx,ShipmasterTK,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:22:56 2015 UTC,"Flash Drives, Input Devices, HP Ink, Cell Phone Chargers, and Headphones are probably the most time-consuming."
Staples,39hdpx,Captain_T,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:11:07 2015 UTC,"Toner and Ink were always frustrating because of how quickly the miscounting, mis-shipping, and occasional theft would add up. Coming up a few thousand dollars short of where you should be is never fun.  Flash drives were always relatively easy. I've always been the unfortunate one to do lockup totes at the stores I worked at, so I kept that shit perfectly organized. And we stayed on top of our promo shippers for tech, so that always helps."
Staples,39hdpx,Doominated,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"The worst I've every had as far as write offs was when I got to the store I'm at now they hadn't done any counts for like a month or something, so I scanned HP ink and wrote off over $3,000 I almost passed out and the assistant manager at the time said ""Yea that's about right we're high shrink"".  I thought the next scan would be lower - not by much $2,600 and it stayed around that amount for a while until I started saying it had to be internal theft.  My GM thought it was the warehouse so he put in some tickets but nothing happened, It's now down to about -$500.  I still think it was internal theft because the huge losses stopped after I told everyone I would do HP ink counts everyday to isolate when the losses occur but the worst count for me to do is the Mobile Phone Chargers, this store has sooo many and they're everywhere, registers, endcaps, aisles, shippers, high ticket, clearance it takes forever. with write offs are in the $200 range."
Staples,39hdpx,FaxForRA,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:44:30 2015 UTC,Worst as in loss? Toner (3k I think). Worst as in to do? Every little tiny cable in the store. Took all day.
Staples,39hdpx,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:06:28 2015 UTC,"at my store hands down is input devices, mainly because we have more computer mice than we have room to actually put on the shelf... so i am taking the plano apart to scan each one"
Staples,39hdpx,gimzi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"SHIPPING BOXES!!! I know these are not that bad on their own, this is definitely specific to my store, but not only have people just put them WHEREVER so it is the worlds worst easter egg hunt, but most of them are in top stock and I am not particularly strong and they were piled UNREASONABLY high (and not all the same kind in a pile, naturally) and there was no good way to move them around x.x"
Staples,39hdpx,katyrzana,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:48:41 2015 UTC,"I had to do pretty much all the cycle counts for my entire store last year for inventory, having never did a cycle count before.   Paper was the worst. The confusing shit with the 10 of SKU 513099 is one SKU of 513096 and that business put me over the edge. Plus counting every... single... ream and every... single... pack of photo and specialty paper. It took me and one other person like all day."
Staples,39fwe4,lasean951,8,Thu Jun 11 13:22:14 2015 UTC,IS is hell. Copy center is hell while standing on your head in dog crap.

Staples,39fwe4,Nelo1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:42:59 2015 UTC,IS can flee. CPC cannot. Same level of stress either way. Run away!

Staples,39fwe4,FaxForRA,2,Fri Jun 12 01:26:43 2015 UTC,"Same here, its always so chaotic in cpc and not a day goes by without yelling angry customers. No thanks."
Staples,39fwe4,sleasytechpro,3,Fri Jun 12 03:26:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't as with the restructure they did a few months ago, your going from a potential position with keys / numbers to a non keys numbers position. IA is much more powerful. However it depends on your stores tier."
Staples,39fwe4,47hourweeks,3,Thu Jun 11 13:40:07 2015 UTC,"If they like CPC, I think moving into a position that handles numbers, is very important to the stores success in sales, and is actually considered a supervisor position (IS still wears 'Sales Associate' lol) would probably stand to better benefit them if they hope to move up higher into a sales manager position. IS is great for operations and getting to know every inch of the store, but it doesn't offer the same sales experience that CPC can.  I would rather be the IS, too, but some people may find CPC more enjoyable."
Staples,39fwe4,rawrzaurs,3,Thu Jun 11 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"Literally the two worst positions in the entire spectrum of retail  Two different real-life versions of hell, both equally as bad."
Staples,39fwe4,Doominated,3,Thu Jun 11 21:56:47 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy IS and have a supportive store with lower theft/more useful associates, stay there On the other hand, CPC can be enjoyable but you get customers who are plain needy as fuck. Prepare to hold hands, wipe asses and hate your fax machine. Some CPC supervisors are MOD/keyholders. Best Copy is like previously stated, very busy and can receive little support from other associates if they are not trained. CPC can be fun and you will meet people who are genuinely sweet with heartwarming stories but also people who are cheap. Also every CPC stat gets micromanaged and watched like crazy  If you have a CPC that does have many cross trained individuals and management who also can help out, I would recommend it (makes resume look pretty). If your GM/management are scared of helping out in CPC and leave you to drown (have seen it), stay away. Consider if not a Best Copy how the equipment look because if not, it will be painful."
Staples,39fwe4,WorktheMoo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:11:21 2015 UTC,"Don't do it, copy center is horrible! I have been trained in cpc and often get pulled to cover lunches, when someone is a no show, or on vacation. I have been offered the supervisor spot in my store and a surrounding store and told my GM and DM I would quit before I took it."
Staples,39fwe4,thefuckers,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. My store does about $6 million though we are down a little this year. My GM is more than willing to let me try out CPC and see if it something I like. I used to be an easytech so I know every aspect of the store except CPC. I can handle shipping but then again, who can't?   Anyway, the old CPC sup left to become an account manager? Or something like that and she is still hanging around the store and I talk to her a good bit. Today I asked her about how CPC really is and she had said that she loved it and misses it a little. I really want to give it a shot and I want to like it. I have nothing to lose because nobody in my store is qualified to take my position or the CPC sup."
Staples,39fwe4,kalli2011,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:21:52 2015 UTC,"Do whatever you can to stay away from CPC. Being a copy center supervisor myself, it's hell. Customers are horrible to you. Everything they're saying is true. Just say no to CPC and save yourself the trouble."
Staples,39glhl,jlum12,3,Thu Jun 11 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"You're not ""missing"" rewards. You're trying to game the system and people like you are the reason the Rewards program gets worse and worse every year."
Staples,39glhl,risunokairu,3,Thu Jun 11 20:00:26 2015 UTC,Since its considered dishonest I suggest you don't and play it the right way before you're not allowed a rewards card. Best thing to do is shop at staples more and move up a tier to get 20 recycles a month.
Staples,39glhl,eternistarr,-2,Thu Jun 11 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"How is it dishonest? He wants 2 accounts for 2 people that live at 2 separate addresses. If it were 2 people at the same address, I'd totally agree, but what I see here is fine. Let's say him and his partner lived apart for weeks on end due to work. Perfectly reasonable."
Staples,39glhl,kirashi3,2,Fri Jun 12 01:58:50 2015 UTC,Do you buy ink with both accounts? Rewards on recycled cartridges are only earned if you have purchased $30 in ink with that card in the past 180 days. That could be why you weren't receiving rewards prior.   You could call up Staples rewards and ask that they separate the accounts of you're both buying and recycling ink on both accounts. Just explain that the one is supposed to have a different address.
Staples,39eluy,easytech109,3,Thu Jun 11 05:27:47 2015 UTC,You can sell it without the diag and repair. But pc has to be in working order. Customer can't file a claim in the first 31 days.
Staples,39eluy,Kal-ElofKrypton,2,Thu Jun 11 10:01:36 2015 UTC,"There was a change to that policy - when the prices of existing dropped and battery was no longer covered, they eliminated the window"
Staples,39eluy,dan2872,2,Thu Jun 11 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, shit, the battery is no longer covered? How long has that been the case? I use that as the biggest selling point, had no idea I was giving out bad info."
Staples,39eluy,BubbleWrapLampShade,3,Thu Jun 11 13:47:33 2015 UTC,"A year or so ago they dropped the prices from $99/$159 to $59/$99 (then raised them to the current ($70/110).  This was right around when Total Support was coming into full swing. I had to go to an MTS meeting and we met with a guy from Square Trade. He explained that the prices dropped to be more desirable, but the battery coverage got cut to cover the price drop.   It still exists on the New PC SquareTrade, but if you ever have a customer need to get the battery you are best calling the associate line yourself; all of my customers who called got the run around about how Square Trade doesn't cover batteries, I had to get each elevated at which point somebody went, ""Oh, I see that our Staples coverage DOES include batteries!"""

Staples,39d0ne,mr-octo_squid,4,Thu Jun 11 03:59:56 2015 UTC,"You can overkill it, like so many customers do. Best thing I can think of is to just wait for a sale on some Kaspersky and buy with your normal discount.   But honestly, your money would be better spent on a premium version of Malwarebytes Anti Malware."
Staples,39d0ne,kaiten408,2,Thu Jun 11 04:06:48 2015 UTC,You must work at the fucking unicorn store if you have customers that overkill on antivirus.
Staples,39d0ne,mr-octo_squid,5,Thu Jun 11 07:43:54 2015 UTC,You know the idiots that leave every anti virus program they've ever installed on their computers. Then there was the guy running like 5 anti-spyware/malware programs in addition to his AVG Internet Security and was wondering why he computer was running slow. SMH. I suppose it's better than having nothing.
Staples,39d0ne,47hourweeks,2,Thu Jun 11 15:19:45 2015 UTC,"Lol, luckily I have yet to have one of those come in. did he still have viruses? did he try the ""Your lying! I cannot have viruses! I never have viruses! I want to talk to you manager!"" -.-"
Staples,39d0ne,kaiten408,2,Thu Jun 11 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"Well not a tech, but Malwarebytes and ESET are the best because Eset  has protection for even VM's on a computer. Additionally unlike kaspersky Eset doesn't have a shit firewall."
Staples,39d0ne,47hourweeks,0,Thu Jun 11 14:10:30 2015 UTC,I've never been a big fan of 3rd party firewalls. The built in one has served me well for years. I hated using ESET in the ETTB so i've never tried it on my home computer. How does the non-ETTB version compare to the regular?
Staples,39d0ne,kirashi3,2,Thu Jun 11 15:21:39 2015 UTC,I don't touch the easytech stuff  but the consumer version is great
Staples,39d0ne,elentirion,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:01:32 2015 UTC,First party firewalls are more fun anyways. Why watch a burning wall when you can gas that sucker up yourself?
Staples,39d0ne,yemman,2,Fri Jun 12 01:48:56 2015 UTC,Typical 10% discount.  What I typically do is wait for the Black Friday sale when we have the AV for a penny after rebate and get it then.
Staples,39d0ne,kaiten408,0,Thu Jun 11 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"mse is junk now and MS even admits it, might as well not use anything."
Staples,39d0ne,yemman,2,Fri Jun 12 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go that far. True it's not as useful as malwarebytes, but it's still better than Norton or McAfee in my opinion."
Staples,39d0ne,cmyers84,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:57:26 2015 UTC,"better than norton and mcafee only because it doesn't bog down your ram and cpu as much. having Norton or Mcafee is worse than not having anything. I wish I still had the email M$ sent out saying to no longer use MSE. It was basically like ""yeah we're pretty much not gonna support this anymore, here's a list of third party AVs you can get"".  You wouldn't believe the sleazy sites I visit with no AV, adblock and noscript for firefox. I never get viruses, because these AV companies trick you into thinking they are good but really they only work like .0001% of the time."
Staples,39d0ne,elentirion,2,Fri Jun 12 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"If I recall, every once in a while we'd get free copies of anti-virus software from different companies. The last I remember was Kaspersky."

Staples,397o6q,kloops,12,Tue Jun 9 21:11:20 2015 UTC,"Once I had a customer come up to me asking for Stanley Bostitch staples for their stapler. Show them the staples section and let them know we don't have Stanley Bostitch brand but maybe one of the other staples we carry would work. I was told we do indeed carry them and the customer bought them just last week. Go ask the inventory associate who had been with Staples for around a decade at that point. He confirms to the customer we no longer carry those. She says she got them just last week. Inventory guy goes and looks on the AS400, the last time we sold one was about 30 months prior.  A few days later on the weekend a guy comes in asking for Stanley Bostitch staples. I explain that no we haven't sold them in about 2 and a half years and its funny he is asking because a woman was inquiring about the same product a few days earlier and thats why I know we don't have them. Woman comes walking up and goes ""oh, that was me, we were hoping we'd get lucky and you'd have them in stock"".  Retail: making people lose faith in humanity, 1 customer at a time."
Staples,397o6q,Bokchoi75,5,Tue Jun 9 23:31:27 2015 UTC,"I love it when you tell them ""sorry but we don't carry that"" and they reply ""oh yes you do! Someone said they got it here!"". And I'm like... Bitch, I WORK HERE, I THINK I WOULD KNOW. How are you going to tell ME. Should I pull it out of my ass for you?"
Staples,397o6q,rons_moustache,2,Wed Jun 10 12:09:03 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, you just gotta go hard and tell them: ""I have worked this section of the store almost daily for x years.

If not vary that by ""We don't have it, I've worked this section almost daily for a number of years and it is not something you can purchase here. You can try online, as sometimes inventory has been shifted there, but you will no longer be able to find this item at Staples."""

Staples,397a0u,haze_gray,26,Tue Jun 9 20:04:48 2015 UTC,"The below is from a post a few days ago....  Hopefully this gets upvoted...but likely won't. Your AC is not broken. Whoever says it is, or claims the home office won't fix it, or their GM doesn't want the cost on their P&L is lying. If your AC legitimately is broken facilities would know and have someone out to fix it. In my experience, within 1 business day. The setpoints for the AC in stores is high enough that it likely just isn't coming on. Most stores I've been in the set point is 74 degrees, meaning the AC won't come on if it's below that. If it gets above that (likely) the AC will turn on until it gets it down to 74. Please, guys stop about the GM. We're not evil beings that want you to sweat and be miserable. We have 0 control over the AC. A company called Novar manages the system and facilities and corporate dictate what the set points are at. If your stores AC ""is broken"" its not the GMs fault. I had a senior manager from HR in my store last year during BTS. They left very quickly because it was unbearable. She told our supe to call facilities and name drop her and they'd fix it. So we did. Within 6 hours, Novar called the store. I had them lower the setpoints to 64 degrees. That lasted for about a week. The same thing happened when we got our carpets cleaned. The humidity was unbearable so we called facilities, within 1 hour Novar called us (after 10pm I may add) and set everything to full blast with a setpoint of 64. That also lasted about a week. Once facilities sees a store off the normal setpoint, they ""fix the glitch"" and we go back to sweating. tl;dr Your AC isn't broken, your GM isn't preventing anyone from fixing it, corporate just has the temps set too high"
Staples,397a0u,Railman3,8,Tue Jun 9 22:28:45 2015 UTC,"I see this is down voted, but Railman3 is 100% correct. Almost all stores have the Novar system which is universally set at 74 degrees. Sucks, but it's a money-saver from corporate. Complain and it gets changed for a week, maybe two. I had a very similar experience. Ours was legitimately broken and was fixed within a few days of placing a ticket."
Staples,397a0u,venturer95,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:15:49 2015 UTC,Why thank you.
Staples,397a0u,Railman3,3,Wed Jun 10 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"Also what usually happens is the sensors around the store (white boxes on the steel poles and walls) will break, and not allow for that area to be measured for temperature. This will keep the AC from turning on or at least functioning properly. They won't fix these unless multiple are broken. Also, larger areas are harder to cool than smaller rooms like offices. That's why your GMs office might be cooler (duh.)   TLDR: Temperature sensors around the store are probably broken, get those fixed."
Staples,397a0u,rons_moustache,2,Tue Jun 9 23:55:52 2015 UTC,The GM office and cash office in my store are the 2 hottest places in the building. Lockup is always nice and cool though.
Staples,397a0u,joebacca121,2,Wed Jun 10 14:39:59 2015 UTC,Facilities will typically call if they're not getting temperature readings. We cracked one off a steel pole and they called within 24 hrs saying they couldn't get a reading and it was fixed within 2 business days.
Staples,397a0u,Railman3,4,Wed Jun 10 15:42:32 2015 UTC,"Go to staples.com, contact us, store complaints, and have at it."
Staples,397a0u,UnnamedStaplesDrone,4,Tue Jun 9 23:08:17 2015 UTC,A little trick I used.. wet a paper towel in hot water.. wrap the sensors.. AC should kick on when sensors heat up.. and just reverse in winter for extra heat.. cold water on sensors.. don't saturate the sensor.. just enough water to wet paper towel!
Staples,397a0u,youridiotbox,3,Wed Jun 10 02:49:11 2015 UTC,You could make an anon account on FB and do it there. Social media is good for response too.  Say it was far too hot and your daughter showed signs of heatstroke after leaving the store. I dunno. Get a bit creative.

Staples,393qen,The_Moot,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:24:57 2015 UTC,Canadian here. I can't fucking stand our A/C. Our summer days are between 18 and 35 degrees Celsius. Our AC keeps the store at no warmer than 18 degrees and we're fucking freezing. Last summer we just left the doors open to heat the store up but our GM made us close them because the AC electricity was expensive and would have to work harder if we let the store heat up. The temp is regulated elsewhere and we're freezing out asses off.
Staples,393qen,jimmer109,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"So in Canada, where it's cold, Staples keeps it really cold... and here in the States, they keep it hotter than Hell.... this is Vulcan-level logic."

Staples,3915jn,kirashi3,4,Tue Jun 9 02:17:55 2015 UTC,"Awesome GM! We've got a similar story (with a totally newer iMac) where a customers iMac HDD was wearing out, and because it was an older iMac they decided to get a MacBook Pro Retina with their data transferred.  We destroyed their old HDD and the customer told us to keep it for training new associates on OSX as it could run Mavericks at the time, and I think it can upgrade to Yosemite too.  Our GM agreed to keep it for training, but once a year it mysteriously migrates to the top of the recycling pallet in the back for a single day... ahem"

Staples,392s83,BubbleWrapLampShade,11,Mon Jun 8 21:01:19 2015 UTC,I find it to be an odd pairing. Anyone intelligent enough to use Newegg does not need our services. This will slowly disappear.

Staples,392s83,alex10819,0,Tue Jun 9 02:30:12 2015 UTC,A bit like when we had Amazon lockers in store for a while. That was just weird.
Staples,392s83,TEEHEE_NYC87,4,Tue Jun 9 05:40:56 2015 UTC,"It'll work similarly to how the sales of our services work on Dell's site. Customer buys computer and likely a set up on newegg, they bring in their computer and paperwork. We make an OMS work order and ring it through the POS using the 16 digit code on their paperwork from newegg as a coupon code that will net the cost to $0."
Staples,392s83,joebacca121,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:02:30 2015 UTC,"If the coupon code marks it down to $0, does that mean we will get 0 tech dollars of credit as a store for the service?  Because, if so, that sucks. I know we didn't make the sale, but as cert techs, we are often informally judged by how many dollars are coming in to the Bench, not how much work we're actually doing. So like, we get the screws put to us a little bit on weeks when we have a lot of TS redemption work behind the bench, because managers see the number of Tech Dollars, and think we don't need to be spending that much time back there."
Staples,392s83,badfordabidness,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"I would imagine you'd still get credit,  similar to if a customer uses rewards coupons, you still get full credit for the sale of St or services."

Staples,392n9i,imnoteasytech,6,Mon Jun 8 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"I worked at a store for about 4 years, ran it for about 9 months. Sometimes felt like a team, sometimes not. Always had 1 or 2 associates who just wanted to do what they liked doing, so the stuff they didn't like doing always fell on me to do. But even then I liked them. Always liked them. Just never felt like a real team all the time."
Staples,392n9i,OldWeirdPro,2,Mon Jun 8 20:35:46 2015 UTC,Same. All of our full-time associates worked really well together. It was the part timers who don't get paid enough to care that didn't play along with the team.
Staples,392n9i,haze_gray,3,Mon Jun 8 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"I dunno, in my store once again our ""team"" is having 4 greyshirts all on duty at the same time talking useless strategy. Most of the day we had 1 or 2 greyshirts for each customer in the store. Most ridiculous waste of money I've ever seen."
Staples,392n9i,Scofflaw60,3,Tue Jun 9 01:00:15 2015 UTC,"Kinda the same with my store. At times, we would have 3 greyshirts and a keyholder all at the same time, with only me (EasyTech) and a OS associate. So basically it was all chiefs and 2 Indians, and believe me, the chiefs did not want to do any work whatsoever."
Staples,392n9i,staplesthrowaway666,4,Tue Jun 9 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"Teamwork takes time. I have a great team now.. Sure, we've had a few rogues here and there, but mostly, we get solid people."
Staples,392n9i,Kal-ElofKrypton,3,Mon Jun 8 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"I have worked at two stores, and both times I've known my tech department to feel very much like a team. I've had associates that I'm comfortable handing customers off to when I'm needed elsewhere, and I've had associates I trust with my reputation when I ask them to cover for me-- and they do the same."
Staples,392n9i,aforsberg,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"I was fortunate enough to have a really, really solid tech team for the majority of my 2 and a half years at staples  At one point in time, we had myself, my current roommate who had prior PC repair shop experience, someone with A+/Net+/Sec+ certs, another tech with A+, a tech lead that had been with the company 7 years, and a sales manager that focused on the tech areas of the store and had been around for 7 years, previously being a tech lead himself. This was also back when Mobile was with wireless advocates, and we had the #1 phone sales person in the region full time in our store. And we were ALL working 40-45 hours a week.  Of course, I fucked things up by moving to Wireless Advocates (My DM basically begged my GM to do it because my sales #'s were through the roof coming off Q4), then the A+ certified tech quit and moved to mexico, then the triple certified one took the full time supervisor spot when that became a thing. Not to mention our Sales manager was now the ""Sales and Service Manager"" and was expected to live and die within the gates of Copy Center. It was a very sad crash and burn of a beautiful tech bench team. Literally none of us work with Staples anymore.  When I moved stores the next year I wound up in another pretty good tech team in a different district. Full time cert tech (literally the only tech I've ever met through Staples I will admit is better than me), a guy that was working on his certs and was really into the detailed side of things, someone who was part time and also worked a level 2 help desk spot, another guy who kinda knew his stuff, enough to take the ""grunt"" work off our hands at least, and we did a good job of training the sales people to get things on Matrix. And my GM really believed that a strong tech bench and tech sales team is what pushes a store ahead (Every other Friday he'd actually put on a black shirt and work as one of them, which was pretty cool). I moved to the store as a TS at the time, so I didn't get too involved at first, just kinda ran back there for 10 minutes at a time to keep things moving whenever the full timer wasn't there. Eventually got more involved because me and the Tech Supe wanted to swap positions, but I got a real job pretty soon afterward.  I miss the days of non stop bench work sometimes. I have a ""team"" I work with at my current job, but it's 9 of us covering 27 stores all over the state. ""Teamwork"" is only seen in emergencies unfortunately."
Staples,392n9i,Doominated,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"This one is rough. I feel like I do have a good team, but I also feel like there's about four individuals I wouldn't trust with anything other than a few hours here or there a week to fill in some gaps or lift heavy stuff. NCNSs are common with my workplace, too, and like you, a lot of our workers have quit without notice or very little notice.  But on the other end of the spectrum are people I'm willing to go above and beyond to help. My store manager and ASM are fantastic. Our techs are outstanding and can deliver a great deal of services despite limitations on software and the fact that we are now reliant on the matrix. We're cross trained so that we can fill in as needed and we all pull extra weight when needed. I'm the IS at my store and my managers will often times help out here or there to help me- which is why I've been with the company for as long as I have. Got freight to do? They'll pull the RTV/Ws. Damages piling up? They'll do the cycle count for that day. It's a team effort, and to be honest, if even one of them left, I don't know how long I would stick around.

Staples,38ykom,Doominated,7,Mon Jun 8 01:40:21 2015 UTC,IMHO that is part of the problem. Our strategy for the last several years has been to generate sales no matter what. All of those laptop coupons and high pressure sales goals have only frustrated our traditional customers and brought in race to the bottom resellers.  Income spikes in the short term but there are no free lunches what we are actually doing is trading the company's good name away for that income.  So here we are today where the house of cards has begun to collapse and profit fell 39%.

The other idea is that it'll be pretty.  Our POG is the same as before, slightly compressed. They gave us new acrylics for the large HP inks. There's a stand in between the HP and Epson inks for a display printer. Some sort of weekly promo, I presume. The top stocks are replaced with pegs going up the whole wall, all empty boxes. The brands match up with the ink brands below. In front of the inks are large cardboard logos for the brands in question.

(Sometimes she's both opening and closing MOD.)  She receives and puts out most of our freight and often is in the store up to 15 hours a day, a lot of which is unofficial.  I'm not sure what motivates her to come in and work when she's not being paid, but her work ethic is amazing and she's basically my Staples Hero.  As far as ""rank,"" I'm not 100% certain, but I've been told IS/IA is Level 3, equivalent to my position (mobility & tech sales associate).

You do get extremely overworked because no one really knows how to adequately do the position. I pressed to get a key and had to go to district key leader classes. They take the loss prevention to such a high level that there can't be too many keys around, as each lock in the whole store has to get changed if you lose your key. Going from Tech to IA was considered a promotion, but as this was 5 years ago I know the levels are different now. Just remember your manager most likely cares about the shoot (DM can see in the A/S 400 i believe), the amount of damages(affects GMs bonus), and cleanliness of the cage(my GM got ripped for it once). Those are the top priorities to a lot of people."

Staples,38uf2l,FaxForRA,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"So as a current IS/IA (I believe it's actually Inventory Associate, Specialist just sounds fancier)  I can tell you the position varies wildly from store to store and tier level.  I've worked in a tier 3 and tier 2 as an IA and I did the same thing in both except in the tier 2 I have someone do the damage RTW/RTV, I still do the good product RTW/RTV. and one of my managers maintains the BOPIS.  My job is the ZB walk which sometimes we do on the weekends in which case my Team Supervisor does it cuz I don't do weekends, Cycle Counts, PO Receiving (Purchase Orders), receive truck, breakdown and sort the tote pallets ( I don't break down the other pallets OS does that).  I'll do planograms, transfer request and I'm the last person to touch the register.  I get to work at 7p and I leave at 3p period.  The IA usually answers to the GM or OPS manager but they are considered key holders.  I have the same keys as management and biometrics (fingerprint reader) for high ticket, but my alarm codes only work at the receiving door.  Some IA wear grey shirts and open stores I wear red and have no desire to add that responsibility to my plate.  When I took the position I came from easytech and I had four days training ZB walk and Cycle Counts that's it, no one else in my store new the position, so I reached out to two IAs in my district and they were great I would call them and they would walk me through everything one even came down and spent a day with me showing me how to process the damages I also found great resources on the HUB by just searching topics like RTW/RTV , SPO (Special Order-online returns), etc.  I put together a binder with all these resources so I could go to them when needed. If you have a good working relationship with your GM then you should be more assertive about your needs so you can get the job done but if you don't get along then it will suck"
Staples,38uf2l,Wannabanana17,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"My GM and I came to an understanding that if things aren't done right in our store, watch out. I will have their ass first. The most ironic thing is when I was first promoted, a few of the more experienced/older employees asked the GM to send me to a nearby store to work with their IA and learn how to do the job. My GM denied that idea. I never even heard of ""SPO"" until today. I am in a tier 3 store, where I am doing everything in my supposed job description. Ironically I am normally the first called to the register since I believe we are understaffed as well as all other employees are older and take forever to take the register. Could you outline how to do ""special order online returns""? on the hub or is that not allowed on this website. Our Team Supervisor does planograms, despite most of our planograms aren't done, if so, done incorrectly."
Staples,38uf2l,FaxForRA,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"I've been with the company for seven years, and during that time, IA (now IS since the ""restructure"") was probably my most challenging position.   I was an IA in a tier four store. My responsibilities included (but were not limited to) zero balance walk three times a week, damage return processing, good product returns every Tuesday, cycle counts daily, pull lists, freight receiving, PO receiving, opening and closing the store, preparing deposits, backup cashier/break coverage, and MOD.   The job was stressful nearly every day. I had copy and tech experience so I was usually their back up as well. From what I have seen, IA or IS is probably the busiest position in the store. I've been a tech associate, IA, Team Supervisor, Tech Supervisor, and an Operations Supervisor. By far, IA had me running around the most.   Nobody else in the building is cross-trained on the responsibilities of the IA. The IA is usually cross trained most everywhere else. It can be enjoyable for someone with a strong work ethic, but it can lead to you feeling undervalued for the work you put in. If you enjoy the hard work, keep at it. You can move up. Knowing how to do everything in the store gives you an advantage when another restructure happens. You can slide into other roles if need be. It has worked for me and I'm sure it can work for others.   As far as help on SPO returns:  If the associate used SORT when processing the return, you should get a SPO downloaded to your good product returns the following Tuesday. Usually you'll have several weeks to complete it. The order will usually have a generic dotcom sku, so if you don't know what it is, you'll have to research the transaction and order number to figure it out.   When processing the return you'll need an RA. Usually from Ingram Micro. Their email address is available on the product disposition screen in AS400. Email them with all the information you have (ie order number, product name, model number, staples sku, whether it's new or opened, etc). In a few days they will give you an RA.   Process the return like any good product return, then hit F6 to enter your RA. Continue as normal. Done.   Sorry for the long blocky paragraphs. Not the best at my formatting. Feel free to PM me with any other questions you may have on how to do your job. Odds are I know the answer or could get it."

Staples,38tnb8,Endeavorly,8,Sat Jun 6 18:44:44 2015 UTC,"We had a guy come in to fix ours. The next day, it was effin freezing. AC was running full blast, which was kind of bad too, but better than sweating and everyone smelling of ass.   Someone complained, and then another AC guy came again and now the AC doesnt work again."
Staples,38tnb8,UnnamedStaplesDrone,6,Sat Jun 6 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this gets upvoted...but likely won't.   Your AC is not broken. Whoever says it is, or claims the home office won't fix it, or their GM doesn't want the cost on their P&L is lying. If your AC legitimately is broken facilities would know and have someone out to fix it. In my experience, within 1 business day. The setpoints for the AC in stores is high enough that it likely just isn't coming on. Most stores I've been in the set point is 74 degrees, meaning the AC won't come on if it's below that. If it gets above that (likely) the AC will turn on until it gets it down to 74. Please, guys stop about the GM. We're not evil beings that want you to sweat and be miserable. We have 0 control over the AC. A company called Novar manages the system and facilities and corporate dictate what the set points are at. If your stores AC ""is broken"" its not the GMs fault.   I had a senior manager from HR in my store last year during BTS. They left very quickly because it was unbearable. She told our supe to call facilities and name drop her and they'd fix it. So we did. Within 6 hours, Novar called the store. I had them lower the setpoints to 64 degrees. That lasted for about a week. The same thing happened when we got our carpets cleaned. The humidity was unbearable so we called facilities, within 1 hour Novar called us (after 10pm I may add) and set everything to full blast with a setpoint of 64. That also lasted about a week.   Once facilities sees a store off the normal setpoint, they ""fix the glitch"" and we go back to sweating.  tl;dr Your AC isn't broken, your GM isn't preventing anyone from fixing it, corporate just has the temps set too high"
Staples,38tnb8,Railman3,6,Sun Jun 7 13:59:20 2015 UTC,"Our ac wasn't fixed either. No matter how much we complained.  You know how it got fixed? Coworkers called corporate, pretending to be customers and bitched about it. It was fixed within the week.  See how much the company actually cares about the employees...."
Staples,38tnb8,magic_is_might,3,Sat Jun 6 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"Store I worked at never had AC.  If it was on it would be ~ 80 degrees at best.  Another benefit to the matrix, the call center was always nice and cool."

We only got them, and the AC fixed, because we put a ticket in and complained to building management.  If you're part of a mall then complain to the mall management if you're a stand alone store your management should submit a ticket in the Helpdesk for a building repair.  Either way your GM should be handling it, you should have the customers complain to her/him."
Staples,38tnb8,FaxForRA,2,Sat Jun 6 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"Is there no one higher up that could be complained to? Like HR or something? Because simply put, none of my managers, including my GM, seem to particuarly give a fuck about trying to fix it. They all have a fan in their office, after all. It's been rediculously hot for two months, god knows how long it's actually been broken for in the colder months when no one cared."
Staples,38tnb8,FaxForRA,2,Sat Jun 6 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"If you go to HR they will ask the GM if it's hot and if they say no then that ends it.  You would need most of the other associates to say it's really bad and the GM does nothing, then it becomes a complaint about how your GM treats the associates.  You could direct customers to the Store Complaints section of the Contact Us page on the website that might help, but I find it odd that all the associates and a bunch of customers are complaining and the GM does nothing because they have a fan, there's something missing from this story It just seems off."
Staples,38tnb8,FaxForRA,2,Sat Jun 6 20:45:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry that it seems 'off', but it is what it is. My GM is hardly ever around and constantly taking vacations, getting injured on said vacations, and taking days off. I think our operations superviser (whatever the title is, I honestly dont pay attention or remember) MIGHT have said something about sending in a ticket for it to be fixed, but I haven't heard anything about it since. Also it isn't necessary all of the associates complaining. I don't know how our cpc employees feel, but our tech guys just shrug it off. It's mostly the red shirts that get bothered by it. And it's not like customers making off-hand comments or being snotty because it's too hot that are all directed towards the cashier is gonna reach the GM. A lot of our other red shirt employees that whine to me about it being hot are also too pussy to go mention it to our GM when he is in. I just wanted to know if there was anything I could do to reach above incompetent management to see if the damn thing could get fixed."
Staples,38tnb8,venturer95,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:25:31 2015 UTC,"Sadly I don't think there's much you can do without the help of your fellow associates.  It's possible that it's hot in certain areas,  In my store the OS department would be cooler then the front end where the tech bench, CPC and registers are.  It just depended on which part of the AC was working in the building.  I feel bad for you but you have to build consensus with the rest of the team or it just looks like only you're hot.  If you have the cases of Poland Springs water they can be code 13 (written off for store use) and you can put them in the break room. That builds good will with the team and then more people might agree with you openly."

A moron can twist a cable and punch a machine down on plastic, so this is stuff you're always safe buying.  It's a bit hard for me to offer a $20 screen protector to a customer now, when not only is it only for 2 at a 300% markup, but we don't even offer installation."

Alot of people are not comfortable buying online, or simply don't know what to buy, that plus the convenience factor of being able to walk out of a store with the product you need will mean that there is a markup.

You'll have good days, you'll have bad days, just like any normal job. Being effective, that's a different story as it again depends on your store, management level up to district and regional.

Staples,38time,Cujo117,6,Sat Jun 6 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on what position you got hired for.  As an example if you're an EasyTech, get rid of the idea that you will just do tech work you will be a salesperson, that department generates profit from selling warranties and tech repair services not selling hardware.  All in all it's like most retail jobs where you have to get along with a wide range of personalities so if you're a people person you'll be fine but if you find yourself being annoyed by most people around you then you probably shouldn't be in retail.   I personally don't care about Staples the company but I do care about how people look at my work, I can't have people say I didn't do a good job at anything so for me I take what I do seriously because it's a small reflection of me.  Don't bring your outside problems to work leave that shit outside.  I hate when people come to work in a stank mood because of some personal bullshit, stay your grumpy ass at home.  I've had personal tragedy happen and no one at work knows cuz I leave that shit at the door.  If someone does or says something to you that you didn't like then address it immediately and IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER, don't go around telling everyone else except the person who did it.  It's low end retail so you'll have a lot of work and little time to do it don't be seen as the one whose always on break, talking and not working.  Learn as much as you can in the all the different areas of the store, the more you learn the more valuable you are, the more they give you what little hours there is to give.

Staples,38time,FaxForRA,4,Sat Jun 6 20:05:02 2015 UTC,You can stay enthusiastic by continuing you're job search & just take the money (how very little you are being paid) for now.  Also learn it & love it: Bidness.

Staples,38time,EasyTech2014,3,Mon Jun 8 04:20:36 2015 UTC,One thing that is true is that you have to learn how to get into a sales mindset.  You might have to be a little flexible on your morals and realize that sometimes omission is the best course of action. at least if you want to be viewed favorably by management.  If you can sell something full price today with the warranties do it even if you know its going to be on sale tomorrow. If you do know its going to be on sale tomorrow you can try to leverage that to get the sale anyway if you think they will walk.   You don't necessarily have to be completely amoral although sometimes those types make the best sales people. The truth is you have to sell yourself before you can sell anything.  If you can make yourself likeable to the person they will be more willing buy whatever you suggest to them. Hard selling does not work people have to feel good about what they are purchasing so you have to dress everything as a positive.  At the end of the day at staples the biggest thing is results.  How much stress and pressure you feel will completely relate to how well your results are.
Staples,38time,Kenshin220,3,Sat Jun 6 18:52:59 2015 UTC,Stretch and build up flexibility. Gonna need to learn to grab your ankles at a moment's notice when corporate decides to collectively fuck everyone over even more.
Staples,38time,FreightApe,3,Sun Jun 7 00:26:22 2015 UTC,"The thing that keeps me going has always been that I work for myself first. By that I mean that if I lie, provide poor service or treat a customer poorly, I damage my own personal brand first and foremost. I look incompetent or lazy, and then Staples (or any other organization) looks poor for hiring me. I enjoy selling the most tech and ESP in the store despite being rather new to company. I practice and read up on selling, product information and company resources any chance I can get. Why? Because being a go to guy will get you far in more than just Staples.   Having the hunger for knowledge and putting in the effort to do the best job possible will make you valuable elsewhere. Use the retail environment ( as terrible as it can be) to teach you valuable skills that other places can't. Learn to identify things you learn on the job that can help your resume. Retail is stressful but you can definitely make the most out of it."
Staples,38time,FormerSCIA,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"You need to not care about what you might think is good for the store (employees or customers) and simply accept that every corporate decision is made by people who have no idea what is going on at the store level.  What  you can care about is helping people and having good working relationships with your co-workers.    Being able to put smiles on my customer's and co-worker's faces and not get bent out of shape over the stupid flavor of the month things home office wanted is what helped me survive.    Until I left that is.  That is the only real way to succeed at staples, is moving on."
Staples,38rjf7,YUNOBUYECP,5,Sat Jun 6 05:00:06 2015 UTC,"Hello from Canada,  So I currently work as a cashier, but often times I will jump in and help with technology questions if a Tech isn't available. My store is very solid and so is the team. The people in tech try to coach me in cash on how to better sell ECPs and I try to observe their techniques from afar. I try to do my best at nabbing any ECP-able items that slips by tech, but I am still a cashier so take what I say with a grain of salt.  My first advice would be to check out this post: Reddit post on ECP methods / selling tips  My first bit of advice is don't use ""Can I help you?"" Introduce yourself as if they weren't just another sale. ""Hi I'm ____, I am the technology sales associate do you have any questions?""   As for getting more information than FB, email and youtube. Sometimes that is all that people will use it for. Try asking:  ""So is there a reason you are buying a computer today?"" ""Oh my old one broke,"" easy peasy ecp right there. Also try to narrow down the reason and focus on it, as it will be a selling point that will be memorable to the customer.  ""What is this computer going to be used for: personal, shared, office?"" Is this person in school>ask for major, working>ask for type of workload, shared>how many people; will kids need it for games?  Not too sure on the best way to sell setups. Gauge the person and see if they are tech savy and go over reasons or benefits.  Try to look at it as if you are looking to find a computer for a friend or yourself. Planning > Purchase > Problem > Solution Either use assurance or uncertainty to lead the customer. However the best way to convey a sale is to use personal experience and have think long and hard about things at a glance a customer might miss. Laptop break it down on what can break: Screen, keyboard, track pad, wifi capabilities, CPU, Ram, motherboard, GPU, battery. Does the customer know why it broke on their old one?  And if you really want to know how to REALLY sell go to a tech store like another higher tier'd staples or a best buy and pretend to buy a laptop. The internet, like inspired selling crap, can only give you readable words; but nothing compares to real world experience.  Hopefully I helped out at least a little. Best of luck, With regards from Cash."
Staples,38rjf7,john_dune,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:55:17 2015 UTC,"There's two ways to sell setups:  1) convenience factor.  Did you know we protect your computer with the latest and greatest in antivirus? We install the programs you use so you don't have to? Java,  flash, all those programs that make the Internet run smoothly? Oh,  you liked Firefox as your browser? We can do that.  ITunes? VLC?   Have a ""we can do that"" attitude,  customers appreciate that.   2) expertise factor. Our guys are experts in this stuff,  do it every day and know what works and doesn't? Want to bring your old version of corel wordperfect over? We know it's not compatible, so here, let me recommend Microsoft office for you... Don't want to spend an extra $150 on that software,  well there's this great free program called libre office that doesn't do quite as much as office, but guess what? With the setup I will install it for free!   Learn how to frame your customers into groups like tech aware, or tech cavemen.  Then you can learn how to approach things.   Learn the benefits of your packages over the competitors... Here in Canada you used to get a 1 time free battery replacement within the warranty period of the laptop. Our competitors at best buy didn't offer that.  How much does that go for? Well a new brand name battery is in the range of 70-100 dollars. That's more than half the price of the warranty and you get quality parts.   Source for advice: tech that worked at a c-class store in sales but consistently outsold techs in the big money maker stores.  I also started stealing customers because of my honest and no bull approach."
Staples,38rjf7,acid2nick,3,Sat Jun 6 16:53:11 2015 UTC,"If you want to be good at sales you have to be good at making a connection with customers. The whole point of conversation with a customer is to gain their trust.  Try to make it seem like you're giving them ""inside information"". Listening to a salesman brag about every product like each one is the best is a bad example. Tell the customer how they should stay away from Toshiba or from a particular product because YOU don't think it's quality made.   Be knowledgable about your products. Try not to come off as a car salesman only looking to improve his sales numbers. Act like you're trying to sell a computer to your sibling- casually explaining what each computer costs/does. Explain to them the standard for products (i.e. 4GB of ram, 500GB hard drives).  Also don't manage their pocket books. An example would be not offering them protection plans because they're $99 or not offering a $500 computer.  When you mention prices, try to play them off as a low number. Like quickly saying, ""Yeah the protection plan's just $99."" Similar to mentioning how a chocolate bar is just $2, play it off as the price being no big deal.   In tech especially, before you ask about problems they're having with their computer, ask for their name, then introduce yourself with a handshake and a smile. This automatically makes you come off as more trustworthy. When closing the sale in tech, give them the folder (with your business card and work order) say: ""I'll be the tech working on your computer, if you have any questions tech-related I'm here to answer your questions, I'm more than happy to help ya."" While smiling and making them feel at ease.  While making a tech sale, always try to present their problem as serious and if they want their computer to work, they NEED you. Their computer is just like a car, if it breaks down it needs professional maintenance that we can provide.   You need to give off the impression that you're genuinely there to assist them, not achieve a sales goal."
Staples,38rjf7,KaizokuDan,2,Sat Jun 6 07:43:37 2015 UTC,"Perfect response. People are looking for a connection with an associate, and will be twice as likely to buy extra products if they like and trust you. If they think they're talking to a corporate drone, they'll buy what they came for. If they think they're talking to someone who gives a crap about them and knows the product, they'll trust you when you say ""I'd definitely recommend getting protection on that, as well."""
Staples,38rjf7,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:35:08 2015 UTC,"Along with saying, ""It's just $99"" I will usually follow it up with, ""So, basically, for less than $50 a year for two years blah blah blah."" It quickly takes the sting out of the initial price."
Staples,38rjf7,Mattpat139,2,Sun Jun 7 15:04:40 2015 UTC,"some questions ""whos going to be using it"" ""how often will you be using it for intensive programs""  on the topic of esp I find that if you break down the price by year or even month it really warms them up to it because they see the margin of the money they get back."
Staples,38rjf7,easytechwtf,2,Sat Jun 6 12:06:36 2015 UTC,You are a mother fucking genius! just over $4 a month sounds way better than $100 for two years.
Staples,38rjf7,BubbleWrapLampShade,2,Sun Jun 7 05:35:35 2015 UTC,"As far as the ""I have a tech friend to do that"" part of it - I overcome those objections by pointing to my bench and telling them, very honestly, ""About half my business comes from people bringing their machines to me after their tech friend 'fixed' it. Here we have more resources to get the job done right, and there's more accountability. And you never have to worry if you're bugging us.""  I will sometimes mention other specific stories, like the woman who wanted a refund on her VS+ because her son, the tech!, told her Sophos was a bad program and it was slowing down her system. She got her $99 back but was in a month later to spend $159 to have a virus removed (the one that was actually slowing down her system, though her son blamed Sophos) and re-purchased the VS+ again afterwards, anyway.  Lot of good advice in this thread - best I can add is stop overthinking things and try to relax. It'll come in time."

Staples,38pwoo,InforMedic,5,Fri Jun 5 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"Working at Staples no matter what position your in, your going to go into a business model that was so successful for Circuit-City.  :) But if you accept it, like I did, then we have to play the game. I'm the top seller of ESP in my store and yes, I'm one of them old guys pushing 60 and working in retail.  I used to make more money in a few hours than I make now in a week working at Staples. You just never know what kind of curve balls this world is going to throw at you, but no matter where you go, you go into it knowing theres a company game plan and you have to play it ( or fake it real real good) or the job shouldnt be accepted. We had a guy not long ago that was totally and thoroughly convinced that all of the services offered by Staples were all nothing more than a blatant rip-off. He truly believed that. He lasted about a month. Things like Virus SHield and even Square Trade are not always a bad deal especially for the tech challenged. And the tech challenged makes up most of the business. To survive this, you have to be able to see all sides of it. I lead the way in sales, but I dont overdo anything else. I know how little they're paying me and I try not to be a total fool about working my ass off. That will never happen either. On the other side of that coin with the demanding of the 25 hour rule, for me, that was a very strong indicator just how much Staples cares about their associates. They dont. Not at all. In the end, you either play the game just good enough to get your next 25 hours or you quit and go elsewhere."
Staples,38pwoo,Scofflaw60,9,Sat Jun 6 03:49:21 2015 UTC,"As a manager, those of us that are in it for the long haul really want to succeed. I have skills and education, but somehow, I'm here, and I'm going to make the best of it, and get as far as I can with Staples while I'm here.  That being said, there's no reason your managers need to act like dicks. We all have our moments, but there's no need for name calling or belittling. I have a good enough relationship with my team that they know I love them, but I'll kick their asses when they need it too. You have to balance that... and because of that, they let me off the hook when I'm in a bad mood.  And success? We're over 7% esp for the year, top 25% in the company for tech, and in the top 30 stores in the company for Market Basket.   Being an ass won't get you far... and when I am an ass, I apologize for it profusely.   I always say the biggest problem we have at Staples is leadership. We don't teach it and we don't practice it. And overall, it shows in the results. The company continues to make poor decisions that only benefit the top of the food chain, and store and district level managers are forced to be ass wipers for all the children we hire....   We are so much better than this.    Finally, for you personally, I think you're in the wrong business. I don't hire guys like you. I need people who can do it all."
Staples,38pwoo,Kal-ElofKrypton,5,Fri Jun 5 22:45:15 2015 UTC,"I don't hire guys like you.   Good, actually. Hopefully you are informative about the actual job though. When I applied, I was told my job would be tech support and a sleight sales focus. Knowing my system admin background and lack of sales experience, why try to hide the actual job?  And I'm very glad to hear you have compassion. Maybe it's just me, but wouldn't happier employees WANT to help out their bosses and company? How is negativity helpful? That's like calling an obese person fat and they eat too much. It doesn't work. The fact you care reflects that they care. I'd want to work for you because I would want you to succeed and be part of a actual, feeling truthfully, team."

If you interact with computers for 8 years, it doesn't help with selling too much. You can easily lose or never even develop those type of people skills.  Your managers sold you the wrong bill of goods. I'd encourage you to go back to real IT work, where it seems your passion is."

I know staples Canada and US are different but up here we have ""brainsharks"" on everything, sales, tech, services you name it. And if you're not willing to research in order to improve your knowledge then you wont succeed.   And sure we can be overpriced but if you build rapport with someone and convey value then sales just come through the roof.   So if you don't want to get fired, have a sit down with your sups/managers, let them know you want a do over of sorts and maybe that will help. but if you don't care about the job (and for that wage.. well w/e) then you'll never sell."

If someone wants to know why they shouldn't buy the cheapest laptop we have, I'll gladly tell them, based on my 10+ years experience.  If they walk because of my honesty, then they weren't ready to buy with understanding. Thankfully, most of my clients do come round when they understand why the $500 i3/A8 laptop is worth so much more than the celeron/E1/A4 based machine, and thank me for it when they come in for a tune up or other shopping months later.  The ones who don't listen and then proceed to overuse the cheap laptop they purchased come back to ""make it faster"" only to realize it'd have been better to just buy the better machine to start with.... Or they rip my he off about how we sold them a piece of crap.   Which is perfect if I sold it, because I always use polite and easy to understand car analogies relating to towing boats and RVs with station wagons or minivans. remember folks, ""just because you can doesn't mean you should"" applies in all activities carried out during your lifetime"

Staples,38pwoo,Otis_Waistline,6,Sat Jun 6 01:59:55 2015 UTC,"Your managers treat you that way because they are probably what I call ""lifers"". They are likely people who have no marketable skills, an Aspergerian level of social dysfunction and no education so they are likely to be 60 year olds working retail. Because of this, they like to denigrate others to make themselves feel important, especially over little trivial things that dont really matter. Who cares if someone doesnt know the price of something off the top of their head--we have computers to look it up in seconds. Your managers care so much because that is their life, and that is what they will be doing in 20 years. I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I hope you do get fired. I hope this because it would provide an impetus to find a job paying more that will adequately make use of the skills you suggested you posses. Staples will not help your resume, so do not worry so much. A real job would not care about your work in retail, and retail managers are not allowed (by law and/or policy) to discuss former employees except to say whether he or she is eligible for rehire. And you are correct, practically any other company will pay you just as much, if not more with only a fraction of the stress."

Staples,38pwoo,KaizokuDan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:45:43 2015 UTC,"Personally I hate the idea of selling things like Virus Shield, but if the person is going to bring the computer into me once every week with a new slew of viruses, then I'll do it since it makes my job a little easier than explaining the whole $160, or if you'd like to spend $100 more, then you can do this. I have had customers throw money at me as well and I'll rack the ESP up with them, and happily so. Yes, I was told that I was going to be a tech (I'm the only Certified Tech in my store), and not much of a sales person, but now I've been cross trained for Office Supplies, and I am in training for CPC, so I feel like I'm being helpful. My GM is great, and makes me want to work, along with my supervisor in tech, although my AM is a bit of a dick sometimes."
Staples,38pwoo,rawrzaurs,2,Fri Jun 5 23:18:12 2015 UTC,why do you hate the idea? I think of Virus Shield as a stupidity tax. These are the people who will get malware on a brand new machine trying to download chrome from www.hotdeals.com/chrome and then come back to the store and try to return it or blame you for selling them a bad PC. So fuck em and take their $$$.

Staples seems intent on keeping all part timers under 25 hours so they do not approach the 30 hour average that would make them full time and available for benefits. A lot of companies are apparently trying to skim this same rule and it is making retail workplaces miserable to work in."
Staples,38r9na,Talonias,0,Sun Jun 7 03:52:07 2015 UTC,"I believe it is DM discretion, so no definitive answer.. For example by word of my DM, my store's CPC (a Tier 1 CPC with over $1M sales mind you) they just upped it to 30 for the next week or two just because we're shortstaffed and jobs are coming in nonstop.   So in other words your GM (who will probably just check with your DM) could provide better insight on this. The best answer I can give though is SOON. :)"

On top of losing overstock space, the DCs are sending more freight than ever (not even BTS yet), with no where to put it all.  The consolidation of DCs has been nothing but problems, trucks have been days late, not mere hours. The loads have been falling over. I have had more damages right off the truck than ever, as well as being shorted product by the DC.  Prime time is not affecting CSAT or sales, just productivity.  Three people have changed their availability to not include closing hours because of all the work that is now dumped on closers because day people do nothing but ""prime time"". Now they are crying because they are getting fewer hours, but for the moment we are short on closers until they decide getting more hours is worth closing or we hire people for closing."

Some would argue that that isn't your problem, but I think that it is taking advantage of poor, uneducated people.

If you're looking for steady, full-time employment I think the tech supervisor position would be a good way to build your resume while you look for a future with a more financially stable company. However, if you are a student and/or considering going back to school for a degree then I would advise against it as the added stress and responsibility would not justify the potential decrease in time devoted to classes."
Staples,38h7p0,DaBidnessman,7,Thu Jun 4 06:06:52 2015 UTC,"To be honest, unless you're looking to get out or you need part time... you should absolutely take the job. It's the only way you'll get a raise thats more than fucking .10c. If they don't offer you a raise, feel free to tell them to fuck off. I got a (paltry!) $2 raise when I took a supe position. That was a bullshit raise for what I was taking on but that + full time made a huge difference in my life. And department head looks better on your resume if you're looking to get out. And you WILL get important skills out of it. And being able to say you manage other employees helps a ton to get out.   It's a lot of added responsibility though, in most stores you'll be closing MOD. To me, every promotion was worth it but your mileage will very a lot based on what you want out of the job and your GM+DM. I hope you make the right decision for yourself :)"

Remember their either in the exact same boat as you (underpaid, underappreciated, part time tech associates) or people who don't work for a good GM.  My advice...look at your GM and management staff. They will make your time as an MTS either good or bad. Sounds like your SM puts up numbers which is good.

Both my GM and DM were very, very hardnosed about it, saying an SSM should know better than to need three days off in a week during August. I explained that since the third day was on a second week, I could still work 45 hours both weeks and only have two off days per week. I had to keep pressing them and finally tell my GM that I would not be able to work those days even if scheduled, and they finally relented and gave me the three days off. The rest of my time at Staples, they acted as if they had done me a huge favor.  I've seen cashiers get a single day request in August get denied, the blackout period is no joke to most higher-ups."

Staples,38dpfx,endorphin__dolphin,5,Wed Jun 3 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"They're credit accounts customers can open through the stores. When it comes to personal accounts, if the customer spends certain amounts then they can obtain 0% APR for 6($299), 12($399), or 18($599) months. Then after that the APR skyrockets to usually around 27.99%. Also if the customer makes a purchase of $150 or more in the first 45 days then they receive a $50 billing credit on the account. The best thing to do is go in and speak with a manager or someone who knows about them and can explain them in depth to you because there are also business more accounts that are a little more in depth."
Staples,38dpfx,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:36:19 2015 UTC,thank you!!
Staples,38dpfx,ILikeOldTymeStuff,2,Wed Jun 3 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"If you don't understand how store credit cards work, the easy answer is this: they get $50 back as a statement credit (that doesn't mean they get $50 off their purchase - it comes back as basically a credit on their first or second statement) IF they spend $150 within 45 days.  Anyone who is going to be swayed by your pin won't care about deferred financing or the APR, I've found. Just get them to apply.   I keep printouts of the application with me at all times with my employee ID written on it in case they bring it back when I'm not there (gotta get them Star Points ducets) and if a customer asks a question I'm not comfortable with asking I just point to the T&C on the app."

I used to work for a department store that was crazy when it came to getting credit apps every week.  I even got written up for not meeting my goals (I told them that while I did ask every customer, I believed in a person's right to say ""no"" and once they did, I wouldn't pester them about it further. I was told that, in their own words, ""by not pursuing it further with customers you're denying customers the benefits of the card and choosing for them when it came to wanting the credit card."" Most. Idiotic. Thing. Ever.)  With everything that has been going on with the company, and with how they've gotten more and more ridiculous, I just have the sinking feeling that Staples will get just as pushy."
Staples,38azsl,elentirion,2,Wed Jun 3 03:49:56 2015 UTC,"While I think you're right on that, to be fair target does the same thing with their cards and are(or at least were) required to walk every customer through the questions, like ""Are you saving 5% on your order"" and then going through a spiel to explain it.   The whole card thing does have uses though. It saves to some of the online billing systems like copy and print so customers just pay without reentering information and companies who use it don't have to be annoying and try and get a purchase order if they have a card on file that goes directly to their billing so they don't have to call some accounting department and get a new card when they realize staples doesn't take purchase orders(infact that stopped being a thing when credit card purchases online became prevalent... 14 or so years ago?)"
Staples,38azsl,katyrzana,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:02:53 2015 UTC,"In Canada we still take purchase orders and have open account customers all the time.  WCB is the worst for this too: they'll send through the request for quote on a clients order, to which we'll send the actual quote for.

Staples,38ax23,ILiveAtStaples,2,Wed Jun 3 01:36:26 2015 UTC,"The only blueprints that we do copies of are ones that our main customers bring in, mainly because we know they have the rights to the blueprints and it is for their company. As for birthday cards, we absolutely don't print any of those.   As far as I know, we still can't do birthday cards because though they may be under fair-use for the designer who made them, Staples is not allowed to print and make money off of the production of such items that contain copyrighted images."
Staples,38ax23,Tek2674,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"True, that's awkward. As for the customers - if it's for their company, they must have some sort of rights to reprint it then...  I thought you were referring to rando's coming in and doing it."
Staples,38ax23,nachoiskerka,2,Wed Jun 3 02:32:44 2015 UTC,"When I was working CPC I would refuse trademark and copyright stuff all day as long. Problem was when the customers started bitching management would come over and do it for them because they don't want that dreaded call from corporate about not taking care of the customers even if it violates federal law.  The most annoying thing is when you get the store 5 miles down the road that doesn't care and runs everything and then the customer comes into your location and you refuse. I'd call the store first and try reaching out to them on a personal level before going to corporate. It could just be a case of poorly trained employees or part timers who don't care.  The way I used to look at it was the people who brought in copyright stuff usually had really obnoxious and time intensive jobs and were generally pain in the ass customers so by refusing their job on copyright grounds it saved alot of time in the long run. No dealing with the college kids who wanted you to copy 100 pages out of a hard cover book one at a time, or the person who wants their Frozen birthday cards 4 on a page but all they bring in is a Word document with the text and a crappy picture of Elsa.  The only thing I never fought people on was obituaries out of the paper because I'm not a complete bastard."

Staples,38ax23,nachoiskerka,0,Wed Jun 3 02:47:58 2015 UTC,"That's a thing? I know with fair use if someone got something off google then you're allowed to as long as you're technically not reselling. For example, my brother's girlfriendis having a kid and is having a Disney themed baby shower, so I made a finding nemo banner for her. Now, because I'm not using it for resale and I designed the larger item, it's fair use because I made the design and am not profitting off it under the same law that protects pastiches, parodies and personal use(the same law that protects you in court if you tape a radio broadcast and make a mixtape or sample something from a song that doesn't obscure the original song's meaning).  Things like that are okay, provided it's all personal use. Timmy can have the incredible hulk birthday invitation, Suzie can have a big hero 6 baymax notebook, because neither of these are commercial uses(the same reason museum gift shops can sell mona lisa mugs and the like) Now, if you see someone using spongebob's house as a backdrop on his business card or Superman's S on a brochure, then yoy can refuse him. But noncommercial use is 100% protected."
Staples,38ax23,nachoiskerka,6,Wed Jun 3 04:43:01 2015 UTC,"Not quite how that works, Staples would be profiting off of the sale and production of those copyrighted items, therefore it does NOT fall under ""Fair use"". If an individual prints Hulk invitations from his computer at home and does not sell them he has every right to use them. However, as Staples would be making money from printing that invitation for him we are not allowed to print it unless he has expressed written permission from the original owner. Additionally, even being done from home it isn't considered ""Fair Use"". Fair use relates to parody such as Weird Al's songs, or the ""Dumb Starbucks"" store/museuam."
Staples,38ax23,nachoiskerka,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:48:52 2015 UTC,"Technically speaking... If one were to use paper and ink purchased from a store to print these cards, that store is indirectly profiting from the sale of the ink and paper, so wouldn't that still be illegal?  I'd love to be making a killing as a copyright lawyer right about now."
Staples,38ax23,kpanda333,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:42:56 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, and I used to believe that is how it was too, but I believe you are incorrect.  When a customer asks Staples to reproduce something, staples is acting as an agent of the customer. If the customer asks for us to reproduce something for educational purposes, then that transfers to us and our purpose is educational as well (even though we obviously are doing it for profit).  In the training, it states we can copy 10% material for a teacher. If what you were saying was correct, we would have been printing the material only because we want profit, and therefore fair use doctrine would fail."
Staples,38ax23,nachoiskerka,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:54:35 2015 UTC,"But we don't technically sell designs. We sell printing as a service. Whether we sold them a white card or a collage of disney characters, it's the same price. If we designed it, then yes we'd be selling their items, but if you didn't charge a design fee then what are you really charging for?  Edit:if this is weird to you still, let me help you out; once there was a case where a museum was taken to court because they were selling art on their coffee mugs in their gift shop and was a commercial use according to the prosecution. But the museum won. Why? Because they weren't selling the art as a brand when they sold the mug. No one was buying the mug because the painting was on it but because it was a symbol of the museum and the painting was inside the museum.   A more recent news story from around 2011 was Amazon's music locker, which allowed users to upload their music and take it with them wherever they had an internet conncection. They went ahead and made the service without the licenses for any of the music, and came up with the argument that what they were selling wasn't a streaming service or outside of copyright law because even though you could stream your music from it, you were buying a hard drive from amazon, not a steaming or music service. That argument has and still holds today unchallenged."
Staples,38ax23,kpanda333,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:04:23 2015 UTC,"However, at the same time, the customer would not be purchasing anything at all if it weren't for the designs they wanted (such as Disney Birthday cards). The point still stands however, and Fair use does not relate whatsoever to the topic of someone making Disney invitations and using them for parties. To put it simply ""Examples of fair use include commentary, search engines, criticism, parody, news reporting, research, teaching, library archiving and scholarship"". So educational purposes are acceptable (such as a parody of Mountain Dew logo used for school), however Fair Use absolutely does not apply to someone making Hulk cards and using them for their party.  Not sure how Amazon was able to get off with that (probably good lawyers), and with the museum I believe there is a bit of a different line in that the sales also help keep the museum alive rather than having people actually make a huge profit off of the sales of the mug."
Staples,38ax23,paperfairy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"But that's still on the customer still. It'd be like if you recorded a covers album and out it on Itunes. A record company can't sue apple because all it did was host the songs despite being the seller, but it can get it pulled off the site for not getting paid. Trust me when I say that copyright is a very large grey area that is wholly inconsistent on art and music.  To have an actual copyright case one has to satisfy 4 major areas:Use(Commercial vs. Private and non profit and etc),  Amount(What percentage of the work is being used and how much of the work is the product. This protects collages and mashup works, but could apply here), Intent(does the work obscure the original meaning, for example quoting stephen king's Carrie on your mothers day card), and market effect(is one card going to affect market value or is the brand going to be inherently damaged).  Now, that last one is a tough one, because while the card as an isolated incident does cost money, it doesn't inherently damage the brand any more than shoplifting a comic or sneaking into a movie. With a large scale printing that's continuous, you'd see someone getting sued, but as an isolated incident you're not destroying the value of something by making a print(no one is going to not buy Rapunzel bed sheets because someone made a Rapunzel banner), you're only creating a single incident. And cynnically, it would cost so much money to sue over a print or a poster that no one would ever sue you over a single run print of something, especially not for personal use. Companies would lose so much money it's be ridiculous. That's why commercial vs. Personal is such an inherent distinction: if you use Mario on your brochure, you're selling a link to nintendo and their credibility for your business. When you print a mario banner, you're not reselling a corporate connection or claiming mario as something to help you resell something as a customer.   That is why no one is ever going to get sued for custom print items for personal use: runs are too small to show a trend that damages the brand and meanwhile we're protected because we're not selling copyrighted images, just a service to make something with them. Its the same reason nobody rejects things for delivery prints with any of our other production companies through the internet."

I have had customers who have come into the store and demand to know why they got an email even after they had told the person at the register they did not want one.   my whole point it that something is wrong if it says they requested it when they did not.

When they first rolled it out I was getting calls in tech all the time from customers saying, ""I got an email from you that said I requested a receipt, but I didn't request it - is the email safe to open?"" which I can't even be mad at, because at least I'm getting my tech customers trained in email safety.   These days, at the register, I've streamlined it by saying, ""Is that still the email you want to use for your digital receipts and Rewards? Then click yes right there...do you also want a paper copy?"" Asking if they want a paper copy reinforces that they should expect a digital receipt in the email they just said ""yes"" to.  The only time I really got into hot water was when I sent the email receipt (like above) and it turned out the email the customer used was a shared email with the person he was buying a gift for, so that kinda sucked, but otherwise it's not such a hassle anymore."

If you make slightly MORE than that, you can get cheap, GOOD coverage for as low as $30/month through healthcare.gov (you have to wait til open enrollment though).   However, if you make anything LESS than that amount (which I suspect most staples PT associates do), you might be screwed. Some states chose to expand Medicaid so that all folks under the 138% line now get FREE insurance. However, some other states chose NOT to expand Medicaid. In those states, you're probably screwed unless you (a) are elderly or disabled, (b) are a child under 18, or (c) are a parent who has EXTREMELY low income."

Staples,381irx,BulletzQS,3,Mon Jun 1 04:20:16 2015 UTC,Carbonite and Sophos... only thing I could recommend
Staples,381irx,mr-octo_squid,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:51:17 2015 UTC,Even Carbonite has some issues if the user isn't tech savvy. Encrypted files ended up replacing the original ones and get backed up. Most users don't go back to the file version history and restore the old (original) ones. -- Just in case you see this come in!
Staples,381irx,mr-octo_squid,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"That is if the system has already caught cryptolocker with Carbonite installed. What I am saying here is wipe the damn thing, recommend sophos and carbonite so this doesnt happen again. If the computer starts acting up again then they can bring the computer in and we will restore off of a previous version of carbonite. Carbonite retains older versions of files, it does not just overwrite its users backup."
Staples,381irx,FormerSCIA,2,Wed Jun 3 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"There isn't an easy solution. They can wait and hope the keys get released or pay the ransom(clearly not something that would be recommended, but there have been some success stories). Some time back the authorities recovered a few of the distribution or encryption key servers and that allowed people to recover their files. You can wait and hope, or cut your losses and restore."
Staples,381irx,Nottheguyouthink,2,Mon Jun 1 04:30:39 2015 UTC,"Basically, there's a few programs based on live C&C servers Kaspersky captured, but if it's a newer or more advanced version (such as cryptowall) there's no fix.  Basically, if you can get authorization, you can try those decryption tools, but if those don't work, data is gone.  Period. The virus can be removed easily enough but the damage is permanent. Next time, recommend a hard drive for backup, or Staples cloud services. That's basically how it's done."

Staples,381irx,shadowstewie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"Wipe and reload. Pray they have backups. If they dont, make sure they get one now.  A Cryptolocker computer is borked.   Some people have stated they have had lucking paying the ransom but i would not bother.  Just wipe and reload."
Staples,37yx4g,playnotwork,7,Sun May 31 16:08:00 2015 UTC,Wait. So all that space... it's not even for live ink? It's for fucking CARDBOARD??? Where is overstock... I... okay. I'm fine. I don't get paid to get angry. I get paid to PrimeTime™ it up.

To my understanding some stores with a top/midstock above their ink will be filling it with dummy boxes... Someone from a store that actually is part of this initiative could probably chime in and know more than me"
Staples,37yx4g,venturer95,5,Sun May 31 17:17:45 2015 UTC,"Ink wall expands 8 feet, goes 6 inches higher, and has pegs that will hold more ink. This I'm for.  Filling the mid and topstock with empty boxes, annoying.   Losing an entire perimeter wall in a fairly small store and not allowed to use topstock in any non-perimiter wall? Ridiculous."

Yeah we'll get it sometime, except it's physically impossible with my store's floorplan. Our ink pegs go up about 2 feet from the ceiling with no top/midstock. Most likely when they get around to our CPC and Front End remodel that's a year overdue, they'll probably move our ink wall to a perimeter wall on the high ceiling area of our sales floor.  My building used to be two separate businesses so the floorplan is completely crazy."

Staples,37yx4g,FormerSCIA,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"I think it would make more sense to have certain numbers of ink stored in the mids above the ink wall (in some sort of lockbox/cage). That way you could quickly perform certain pulls to fill holes (heavy task -> light task, hello good bidness). You would still keep the pricey and thief preferred inks/toners in high ticket, which in turn would have more room for arranging product and maintaining an efficient HT room."
Staples,37zkx1,BadForBidness,9,Sun May 31 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"Whenever we had a reseller. We would crack the box to whatever computer they were buying. We would then start it up, if they stuck around that long. As soon as the seal is broken, they don't want it.   Word spread, and soon we didn't have hardly any resellers."
Staples,37zkx1,haze_gray,7,Sun May 31 19:42:17 2015 UTC,If they're nice and aren't causing a problem I don't have an issue with them. It's when they start being assholes about stacking coupons and ringing multiple transactions that I'll shut them down.
Staples,37zkx1,vitamintrees,3,Sun May 31 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"I've run all mine off, and will continue to do so. I also don't allow non-receipted returns on dated goods, stylus', etc... I'm not paying you to steal from me..  I've turned in a few resellers. They've since learned not to come back here..  Eventually, I'll get moved to another store and have to do it all over again."
Staples,37zkx1,Kal-ElofKrypton,3,Sun May 31 20:24:21 2015 UTC,"I have a reseller that comes in to my store.  Buys a bunch of OS clearance, typically things no one buys. Never uses a coupon, never returns. He's great.  The people who come in buying that hot deal laptop/ipad? Yeah, they're not lasting long in any store I run. I'll sell through the product to real customers."
Staples,37zkx1,Railman3,2,Mon Jun 1 02:53:03 2015 UTC,"In the past few years with comps slipping, i cant see turning away any customer. I just make sure to offer all services and products quickly. If they try and use multiple coupons from different rewards accounts or stack price match with a coupon, I politely explain the policy. They generally will be in and out and not make too much of a fuss because they don't want to be noticed."
Staples,37zkx1,kdean512,2,Sun May 31 22:25:45 2015 UTC,"Depends. Of the resellers that I know, two are the jerks that press you about applying as many coupons as possible. But there is one that just buys a lot of stuff. There have even been a couple times when he's bought an ESP with the items he's purchased."
Staples,37zkx1,TEEHEE_NYC87,2,Sun May 31 22:43:52 2015 UTC,"My old store would build good relationships with some of our resellers, if we could.  There were a couple that would never admit to being resellers, but some would.   The deal would be they buy esp to raise our numbers, then after a month return it where it won't ding our store.    He would also purchase $50+ ESP on $5-$10 items and would trigger additional deals, then when the he returned the ESP a month later, the discounts made the items nearly free for him.    And before you bitch and moan, we all knew this was bad in the long run.  Home office never cared about the long run though, only numbers.  Even the DM let is slide because it made him look good to his bosses.    The other thing was that Sunday morning we could set aside items we knew would draw resellers, and tell the one's who wouldn't make deals with us that they were all reserved, then our boy would come in and buy them all."
Staples,37zkx1,markevens,3,Mon Jun 8 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"I turn them away and if they bitch I point them to the staples policy of retaining the right to turn away resellers if they continue to bitch I give them my name, the store number, and and the staples corporate phone number. They are scum and should get a real job instead of fucking hard working people out of really good deals."

It hurts esp but at the end of the day we aren't in business to sell ESP. We are here to make a profit.  If they are paying full price great,  if they stack coupons,  try to bully my people into price matching and stacking coupons, use nothing but cash cards etc, I will pass their info along and if the prove to be costing us money corporate will nuke their rewards and ask them not to come back."
Staples,37zkx1,cobaltmk33,1 point,Sun May 31 19:59:32 2015 UTC,"I personally did not have an issue as I'm not directly responsible as the managers are for profit of the store, but when corporate showed us the numbers of the resellers, I was upset. We would have a guy come in and buy $20,000 net sales and the clearance loss would be around $23,000. That was in Q1 of 2015. I used to be alright with them, but now I notice their awful, very pushy attitudes, how they always think you're lying about the inventory, and things like that. I despise them now."

Now that I'm not an ET I could care less about ESP but I get these two guys who want people to hunt through the mids looking for certain SKUs that shit pisses me off, we don't have time for that crap.  I shut one of them down quick just last week he had my porter going through mids and I walked over and told my porter to go back to work, the guy tried to introduce himself to me and shake my hand, I left him hanging, and said have a nice day.  He asked if I had a scan gun to check a SKU, I looked him in the eyes, put my RF gun in it's holster and said ""No I don't have a scan gun for you and I don't have any SKUs, and no one has time to do your shopping,  Have a nice day"".  He just said ""Oh that's how it is OK"" in a low voice and walked away, he asked my Team Supervisor for something she said we didn't have it and then he checked out.  At my old store we had a guy who would by all our clearance, this guy I liked, he bought 10 totes worth of clearance once.  My GM would go through the totes with him and he would clean us out that's when they're useful."
Staples,37zkx1,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,1 point,Sun May 31 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. You wanna buy everything off the shelf? Sure. You want me to dig through mids LOOKING for stuff for you to buy? Forget it. Had a lady play games asking me prices on all the stuff she could see in tops until I caught her at the game. Told her I would gladly get down what she actually intended to buy but I wasn't playing ""scan ALL the things"" with her. Bleh. Next time I saw her she knew exactly what she wanted and accepted my ""that's all there is up here"" without asking me to look more. Sometimes you can win."
Staples,37z9t2,jscheunemann,8,Sun May 31 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"That much loss is multiple people not doing their jobs, and multiple people being in on the theft.  Yes, your store is fucked."

So we have 6 physical registers present, we don't actually have a Reg. 5 even though it's on our list because it used to be a register dedicated to CPC self serve. Before P@SS."

Staples,37z9t2,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,5,Sun May 31 17:54:16 2015 UTC,I've seen some stores that are operating legitimately but due to their volume and the way load is handled they write off $1k+ / week. Now MOST of the items are later accounted for but some either never show up or were possibly a warehouse mistake. The safe is inexcusable.
Staples,37z9t2,1ManTeamOf2,4,Sun May 31 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"Holy crap... $1800 is the entire count of my safe excluding the till bags... That's an inexcusable loss, they're going to be pouring through the CCTV archives.   We recently had about $2000-$3000 in tech theft thanks to the classic ""put it in a printer box trick."" Someone had an alpha key, put tons of product in an HP box, dumped the printer and left the box near furniture for an accomplice to pick up later. Perfect scheme because the first person didn't actually steal anything, and the second guy could play dumb."
Staples,37z9t2,venturer95,1 point,Sun May 31 20:55:26 2015 UTC,"That seems like a lot of time for customer to be left alone or at least not noticed by anyone else. However, I don't know what the status of your store is like. We lose small items frequently, but rarely have large issues like that."
Staples,37z9t2,rawrzaurs,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:07:40 2015 UTC,"When you only have 1 cashier who can't leave the register, only 1 cpc associate who is trying to keep their head above water with orders and cannot leave, 1 ET trying to juggle selling stocking and ET work, and only 1 supervisor to roam the store, it leaves most of the store unwatched."
Staples,37z9t2,markevens,4,Mon Jun 8 17:00:22 2015 UTC,"If nothings on camera then oh well, that $16,000 tech loss is bidness.  The $1,800 safe loss is another story, there are processes that if they aren't followed would be grounds for termination, especially if a loss of this magnitude if found.  I hope you're a store without cameras, maybe this would get cameras put in.  There's no way your IS didn't know about this, he/she had to have told the GM if they didn't they're in on it and that would be dumb for them because they Cycle Count tech every week.  I know stores who had tech losses like that and no one got fired, investigation went on for months but nothing happened cuz it wasn't on camera.  Staples LP bidness."

We cater to the average office user/web surfer.

Staples,37wgjn,Tyler11223344,2,Sun May 31 03:07:18 2015 UTC,Number of transactions divided by number of visits.

Staples,37wgjn,Tyler11223344,7,Sun May 31 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"My pleasure. Some other metrics you'll hear about are DPT which is dollars per transaction, and ROV which is return on visit. ROV is a combination of conversion and DPT but I'm not sure how it's calculated. Another thing you'll hear is ""comping"" or hoping for a ""positive comp."" This is simply your sales this day this year,  versus the sales the same day last year. For example, if this year you had $2000 in sales and last year you did $1000, you be a positive 100% comp"

Staples,37xfaq,atleastitpaysdabills,3,Sun May 31 05:06:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, VIBE is a set of behaviors that they want you exhibit as your working in the store. How do you know what they want you to do each week? Well they have videos on a site called brainshark that are titled with the date and vibe, example the latest currently is May 31st VIBE (some people would refer to it as BrainShark because thats the site they are located on) Basically these videos have any VIBE behaviors they want and they talk about the sales coming up for that week to keep you informed. Personally I don't worry too much about the VIBE behaviors part of it, only the promotions I need to know. But to answer your question, coversion means you convert a potential customer (someone who comes thru the door) to an actual customer (someone who actually buys something). Perhaps someone else has more time to explain other behaviors to you but I hope this helps."
Staples,37xfaq,bopisalert,1 point,Sun May 31 05:24:13 2015 UTC,"Any little bit helps my friend and thank you for answering so quickly, but my question is geared more towards how do they are doing the math for all these, where do our comp goals come from, how is conversion, ROV, etc actually figured out... realistically I'm more interested in the math then the definitions."
Staples,37xfaq,elentirion,2,Sun May 31 05:38:33 2015 UTC,"Conversion is the number of customers that walk in the door compared against the number of transactions.  ROV (Return on Visits, I think) is the number of customers walking through the door compared against how much they spend.  Simple division and multiplication, I think.  Projected numbers are based on the previous year at least, more likely multiple previous years.  Holidays and notable events are supposedly accounted for when calculating the projected numbers."
Staples,37xfaq,supergmregion11,1 point,Sun May 31 06:28:02 2015 UTC,to get rov you multiply conv and dpt so for example .64x30.00=19.20 and that's it as for the reason behind goal it truly is a monkey with a dart board and numbers no I am serious one time otis wanted everyone to hit a certain conversion why because he wanted that's why.  however it does look at historical data then adjust comp goals.
Staples,37xfaq,Railman3,2,Sun May 31 06:28:02 2015 UTC,You can also divide sales by visits. I've seen it both ways
Staples,37xfaq,shredergenetix,1 point,Sun May 31 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"If you look above the entrance and exit doors of your store maybe 5 - 6ft above the top you'll see this rectangular looking thing (I think it's rectangular) I have heard it being called as a ticker, and everytime someone walks through the entrance and exit, it adds to a counter. So at the end of the day you have 2 numbers, people who came in versus number of transactions that day. I have not actually seen the numbers but I would assume its number of people came in divided by transactions. (I'm not very good at math like this so please correct me if I am wrong) So lets say 600 people came in and there were 300 total transactions that day you would take 600/300 and get 1/2 or 50% and that would be your conversion rate. Managers also have a breakdown between different times of day for conversion rates. If you are that curious about it, ask your sales manager he is the one who explained it to me."
Staples,37xfaq,EmailForRA,1 point,Sun May 31 06:41:39 2015 UTC,flip the numbers and this is perfect. transactions divided by people.
Staples,37xfaq,figjam13,1 point,Sun May 31 06:55:45 2015 UTC,"Personally I have never done the vibe trainings I'm my 2 years at staples, but from what I understand there are certain phrases that are supposed to be used and behaviors we are supposed to have because we are automatons that need to be programmed. Luckily the navy did a good enough job on programming me to not require such reprogramming... Just be polite even when the customer is a total douche bag and you will be fine"
Staples,37xfaq,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Sun May 31 14:33:25 2015 UTC,"Conversion drives me up a fucking wall. Any time one of us steps out for a smoke, our GM harps on us to buy something so we don't screw up the conversion. But he also pushes us to offer carry-out for everyone and we have some customers trained to ask for carry-out even when they don't really need it, like it's just a service we're supposed to provide. It's not unusual for me to do 10 carry-outs or more in a 5-hour shift between regular customers and tech pick-up customers. Oh, and then there are the people that come in and ask for us to go carry in an item from their car (to return, for recycle or for ET service), so that's another in-and-out for the customer, and an extra out-then-in from the employee. That's why I think conversion is a stupid metric."
Staples,37xfaq,taradashlee,1 point,Sun May 31 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"Well if your door is set up like most, the going out or exit door doesn't affect the count too much. We all enter the exit door and are careful about the carts coming in so as not to affect the count."
Staples,37xfaq,rons_moustache,1 point,Sun May 31 20:28:17 2015 UTC,Not all stores have a separate exit. A lot of stores have only one set of doors for both.
Staples,37xfaq,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:03:03 2015 UTC,We only have the one door. I assume it takes the number of times the door opened and divides it by two to get our base visitor count.
Staples,37xfaq,taradashlee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:30:23 2015 UTC,"Basically you want people to enter to buy but it cannot be at 100% because there are people who don't buy such as kids with a family ect. So for example how Vibe works into conversion. You want, let's say 70% for your store and a family of 4 walks in, 2 adults, 2 kids.   Vibe example like building the basket would have you try and get them to buy more than one item. So if they come in and buy 1 pack of pencils that sucks for conversion because the counter sees only 1 transaction for 4 people so you should try and get erasers or paper or whatnot included so hopefully everyone gets something.   ROV then complicates this further as they want everyone to buy a certain amount per person. So now that same family comes in and buys a surface for 1000, they have returned on visit (basically like being worth more) but still only bought one thing and then you can get into market-basket here and ESP and more jargon that someone made up.   All and all the best way to get the numbers is to try and get every single person to buy something and somehow the Vibe gods respond well.   There are also two goals to hit each day for sales, Vibe and Last years numbers through as 400. So if vibe says ya need 4k and as400 says 3k and you hit 3.5 k your probably going to get a green, probably yellow day.   Hope this helps."
Staples,37xfaq,staplesbidness56,1 point,Sun May 31 20:34:13 2015 UTC,Basic terms... There's a counter above the door counting how many visits each day. Register counts sales dollars and number of transactions. Conversion = transactions ÷ visits DPT = sales $ ÷ transactions ROV = sales $ ÷ visits
Staples,37xfaq,HimekoTachibana,2,Mon Jun 1 12:42:57 2015 UTC,"That counter for my store isn't for the amount of visitors, it's how many people walked by and set off the alarm."

Everyone has ups and downs and if you've never had issues before, your management team will be aware of that.  It can really mitigate customer complaints if you've been a model employee and are just having a rough patch.  If you're worried, though, it wouldn't hurt to speak with your GM.  ""I know some customers have complained about their on-sites recently.  I've never had problems like this before.  What's something I could have done differently/do you have any advice?"" is probably a pretty safe route to take.  It demonstrates you're aware of the issues and striving to fix them."

Staples,37vjlf,BubbleWrapLampShade,2,Sat May 30 19:44:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 2 year is gone - you have to look up the original order number to see which machine it was installed on in the first place. When you look her up in the system it'll show you that info, then you just look it up local on the OMS."
Staples,37vjlf,eternistarr,1 point,Sat May 30 22:29:03 2015 UTC,"That's why you don't do a renewal and just make a new one. Yes you have to reinstall sophos but its much easier. Just install sophos on top of the old one no need to remove it, put in the new code and its done"
Staples,37vjlf,eternistarr,2,Sat May 30 20:03:26 2015 UTC,"I would have, had the computer been in the store.. or even the same state. She has several plans for her kid's pcs - who are away at college."
Staples,37sfvl,GoodFoBidness,16,Sat May 30 00:43:45 2015 UTC,"This drove me to quitting. So many call outs. When I wasn't getting called in, I was balls deep in a shift trying to play Easy Tech, MOD, Cashier, and whatever work corporate tried to trickle on down from Willy Wonka's factory of fuckery."
Staples,37sfvl,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE,10,Sat May 30 00:59:02 2015 UTC,"You know what's great about not working for Staples?  If I get a call from the management team where I work and I'm off the clock, they have to add 15 minutes of pay to my clock for the week.   If that call lasts more than 15 minutes, they have to add three hours.  Fuck staples."

Staples,37sfvl,Doominated,6,Tue Jun 2 00:06:40 2015 UTC,"Just because someone calls you doesn't mean you have to answer it. I would just let them know that they are not to contact you about work related business when you are off the clock. You shouldnt be asked to teach a tech associate anything unless you are clocked in, maybe you should keep track of your time and bill your GM for the time spent over the phone =P"
Staples,37sfvl,DaBidnessman,7,Sat May 30 02:29:44 2015 UTC,"Tried this once, they just laughed in my face... till I told some higher ups"
Staples,37sfvl,Raindawgify,1 point,Sat May 30 13:16:08 2015 UTC,"I was mostly being facetious, because intelligent people would get the point and stop expecting you to train people while you are not scheduled to work. Judging from your response, I assume that unfortunately you are working with people who are not quite so cognitively inclined."
Staples,37sfvl,DaBidnessman,3,Thu Jun 4 06:02:44 2015 UTC,"Let me put it in the words of a coworker of mine. When you are off the clock you are not obligated to answer the phone. Besides Staples is not compensating you for the time you take to answer the call/text.   There are two techs at our store, myself included. We have an agreement were we won't contact the other unless it's absolutely necessary. Simply choose to not answer there's really nothing they can do. They tried to contact you but you were unavailable. Plain and simple!"
Staples,37sfvl,TankeBuster,2,Sat May 30 03:04:30 2015 UTC,Time for a new job
Staples,37sfvl,Bill_Money,2,Sat May 30 01:31:19 2015 UTC,"I don't get those kind of calls as often anymore (availability changes), but I know the pain. Whenever I'd get a call or text asking me to either come in that day, an hour or so before that persons shift began, I'd about flip shit. I'd still go in sometimes, but I eventually stopped going in because I got fed up with the leniency management has towards call outs. People would call out right before their shift or a few hours, knowing that management would find someone to cover for them and they wouldn't get in trouble. Sometimes people wouldn't come in at all, thinking they didn't work until later in the day or they had the day off. We had an associate who missed atleast one day a week because of ""car problems"", ""over slept"", ""forgot he opened"", ""oh I had a doctors appointment today"" (never called or notified anyone, he'd just come into the store and act surprised he was scheduled. Never asked anyone ahead of time what his shifts were) and yet he kept his hours.  Yet when I request for a day off 3-4 weeks a head of time, maybe two, I get chewed out and told to find someone to cover. I understand it's my responsibility to find coverage, but it makes me think, why should I even bother to request a day off when I can just not show up and act dumb founded or call out a few hours ahead of time? Ffs."
Staples,37sfvl,InfinityFrenchToast,0,Sat May 30 02:32:37 2015 UTC,"What pissed me off was the calls to cover shifts because some employee had gotten drunk off his rocker the previous night and was throwing up on the grass. Same with the constant hung-over employees I have to try and get work done with. I'm basically the PT supervisor. Not a PT supervisor, but I work most of the same shifts as the part timers and have seniority, so I'm usually left to try and break up huddles and figure shit out.  I am not here to cover childish irresponsibility. I don't like being lied to so that I cover people partying over the weekend and getting pissed drunk."
Staples,37sfvl,InfinityFrenchToast,1 point,Sat May 30 04:51:44 2015 UTC,"I try to keep calm when I'm asked to stay a little late until the next person comes in because they had to get someone to cover a shift, since the original person isn't coming in for some stupid reason. If it's legit, like a family member is in the hospital or you've got something medical going on or family related, I'm cool with it. But being a dumbass? No. We had an associate who asked me to cover his shift for him because he wanted to go and get hammered that night and I looked him dead in the eyes and told him ""No, find someone else, or don't go get hammered."" He tried to argue with me and call me immature, and I just shrugged it off and said ""If you aren't responsible enough to come into work and choose to go waste your money on alcohol instead, I'll be more than glad to take your hours."" He instead got shit faced when he got off work, and came in the next day completely hung over..."
Staples,37sfvl,NiBlade,3,Sat May 30 05:09:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know, maybe I'm too high-strung, but I just don't like when people don't take shit that should be taken seriously seriously.  It's a job. It might be a shitty job, but it's a job. They are not paying you to fuck around all day, unless your job is a hooker. Get off the goddamn cellphones, stop getting wasted before your shift, show up on time, call in as early as you know you can't make it, and for Christ's sake, show a little responsibility.   I don't mind talking with my coworkers, but I try and do work as I do it. With them, I'm constantly breaking it up around the tills. I used to work with an associate who would extend a 15 minute break to 45, and the manager never noticed because it was a dead shift. Still pissed me off, as I had to wait an hour later to get mine. Tattling wasn't worth the effort though.  This is part of the reason I hate people. They're either stupid, lazy, or ignorant, and frequently a fair combination of those. My father told me off for saying people are scum, but I really do not like them. Society is severely overrated."

Retail turns people into beasts, but I have to admit my general interactions with them are usually lacklustre too. People mostly get in my way or act as an annoyance. I know that sounds anti-social, but honestly, it's a better life than pretending you like them and encouraging their company."

But I understand they aren't going away, and I'm just out of touch.  Also, there's no policy specifically regarding them. But I'd rather see conservative looking gauges than your hole-y ears flopping around..  I hired a guy who had small ones, and it wasn't a huge issue. He kept them looking good, and small."
Staples,37t16u,Kal-ElofKrypton,1 point,Sat May 30 12:28:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for clearing that for me. I wanted to make sure it wasn't in the policy. I wouldn't want some random new boss or boss's boss bitching at me about it. I have them for personal interest in body piercings but I wouldn't dare go over 3/4 g(size bigger than what i have). It's just plain nasty and stupid. I don't want to greet customers with literally two asses in my face(I say it cause of the smell it creates inside the ear, which is worse with bigger piercings)"
Staples,37t16u,Bokchoi75,4,Sat May 30 16:07:30 2015 UTC,"I was a CPC supervisor and I have 1/2 inch. I'd recommend wearing solid instead of tunnels, looks a bit more professional. Honestly though in this day and age it doesn't really matter. People might look down on you for 30 seconds for having them but as soon as you prove you know your shit it becomes a whatever."
Staples,37t16u,BadForBidness,2,Sat May 30 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"True true, because the first 30 seconds will either be them judging character, or they'll just judge you on the gauges, in which case, they would have found some other physical flaw to judge you on anyway."

Staples,37t16u,BadForBidness,1 point,Sat May 30 04:18:59 2015 UTC,I was thinking about getting red as well. I just felt like it look foolish or funny but if you agreed i'll see if I also get red
Staples,37t16u,BadForBidness,2,Sat May 30 04:38:07 2015 UTC,"I know if my managers interview someone who they think is dressed or groomed inappropriately at the time of interview, they simply won't hire that person. They've told me as much. So if you made it through the interview, they didn't comment on the gauges, and they hired you, I'd say you're in the clear.  Since it's only an entry-level part-time position, it probably won't be a big deal. But be forewarned, if you live in a conservative area, no matter how cool your management staff is, the customers WILL treat you differently, and you'll have to live with that. I've lost sales and pissed off customers before simply because of the color of my skin. It feels terrible, knowing there's nothing you could have done to make that customer happy or save the sale for the store. It's not right and it's not fair. But you are a salesman now, and you're judged on your sales, so you'll just have to be that much more effective with the customers who don't despise you because of the way you look. Sometimes I see fellow EasyTechs slacking, or refusing to increase their body of knowledge, or not going the extra mile to help the customer. I don't have that luxury. I'm at a disadvantage. I know I'm going to lose 5% of customers right out of the gate because they don't like my race. So I need to make damn well sure that I go the extra mile for every single one of the other 95% of my customers. To be successful, you'll have to do the same thing.  /endrant"
Staples,37t16u,BadForBidness,1 point,Sun May 31 21:50:18 2015 UTC,"My area is very mixed and also very old.  So there's every single type of person here, although there is still racism around. Last job I was, I'd get bothered when ever someone made a racist comment or joke towards someone else. It wasn't harsh but it wasn't called for either. I'm white Hispanic so I don't really stand out much which saves me from the racism in any case, although my accent isn't very southern, like everyone around here.  The interview went very smooth for me, infact I was so well dressed for the interview, while waiting an old couple(very nice people) came up to me asking for help because they though i worked there. I laughed and said not yet but I'd be glad to still help them. Turns out what they were looking for was right next to me but they ran out of them so I had to explain that they are out of stock for the moment."

Staples,37t16u,DaBidnessman,2,Sat May 30 03:57:04 2015 UTC,"The reason I ask, to clairfy, is, I've worked with associates who have gauges and for the most part, it seems that most managers (including myself) don't seem to care if their going to be cashiers, or just doing OS, but when it comes to positions requiring building rapport with customers such as CPC or Tech, usually you're dealing with older customers who managers realize might not necessarily take to kindly to piercing's and therefor not take that associate seriously. (Do I think it's right that these people stereotype based on things like this? No. Does it happen? Every.Fucking.Day, I worked with someone who had tattoos {which i get are different then gauges but you get what I mean} , and half his tech onsites involved him being lectured on how he looks unprofessional.)"

I quit last October and it was the best decision I've ever made. I'm now working at a smaller retail location in an assistant manager position and its such a more positive experience. The people in corporate actively listen to the staff/management at their locations, they let us make decisions that we feel are better for our location because they recognize different stores have different clientele. The best part is despite taking a paycut I'm pulling in more money on a weekly basis because the benefits are so much better than what Staples offers. I still visit this reddit every day and while I laugh at a lot of stuff and am thankful that I don't have to deal with it any longer, it also makes me sad to see a company fall into such shambles in such a short amount of time."
Staples,37spcv,Bokchoi75,1 point,Sat May 30 02:55:25 2015 UTC,"Congrats on finding a job that suites your happiness, honestly money may be a big part of life but happiness is without a doubt a more key aspect. I do agree that the years I've had at Staples were greatly superior when I first started, I use to get as a tech around $50,000 by myself in tech dollars per year, now it's hard for teams in not my store but many others to even achieve $50,000 as a collective team per year. I think their biggest problem in tech is Staples is overcharging for services that many customers can take to another competitor cough best buy* and get four times the benefits at half the cost. But maybe, (I'm a hopeful little guy) just MAYBE Staples will realize before bankruptcy, that they need to go back to their old ways. A man can hope can't he?"
Staples,37spcv,Bokchoi75,6,Sat May 30 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"I think you really hit the nail on the head about Staples problems when you mention cost vs benefits.  I worked in the CPC and all day long it was dealing with people complaining about the price of faxing or the price of color copies. The company took a turn for the worse when they decided that it was more important to nickle and dime every single customer that walks through the door than being a place for a business to come in to get the items they need to keep their business running.  The big focus in CPC was BDP and getting the account manager leads to generate more business for the store. Every time a CopySAT came out there were multiple business customers bitching about the fact that they spent 10 minutes in line for a pickup while the staff was forced to deal with a customer at the fax for $1.59 or make 15 copies of someones immigration documents. Of course if you tell the fax customer its self serve and they need to do it themselves or you tell that random customer who needs 15 copies it will be an hour and they ask for a manager you'll get bitched out for an hour about how thats bad for bidness and you're a horrible employee, but when you get a legitimate complaint from a customer spending thousands of dollars a month it gets brushed off as ""oh boohoo they don't want to wait 5 minutes"".  Losing focus on the customers you should make a priority is bad for business but good for bidness I guess."
Staples,37spcv,staplesmanager,0,Sat May 30 03:20:24 2015 UTC,"Losing focus on CPC is a huge problem I personally see in the company as a whole, and really hope they start to realize that. CPC focus is good for bidness."

When you're forced out because you make too much money, and they hire someone who can do your job for less money then your attitude might change. I don't think Staples is an abysmal place to work, but my personal experience is that you do not get promoted unless you are a straight white male, so that has left more than a little distaste for the company. And having worked for other companies, actually most of the things that people complain about Staples on reddit are unique to Staples and don't typically happen as frequently at other companies. Of course, this is all personal experience so it may or may not be generalizable."
Staples,37spcv,venturer95,1 point,Sat May 30 02:26:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it is all personal experience, because as you comment on the straight male part I have to chuckle a bit because my superior is actually homosexual. I make the pay cap because I refused to work for anything less than that, and in the area I'm in I have close ties with my DM, and RM, (actually have had them over for holidays and what not before) but Reddit has taught me Staples is definitely a different experience in different locations."
Staples,37spcv,Bill_Money,2,Sat May 30 02:40:40 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you are. A coworker I had came from a region where everyone loved the DM, and the DM would help out when she visited the stores. Like, she would check out customers and stuff kind of help. But in my district, the DM had a history of racially inappropriate language, encouraging favoritism, misogyny and was otherwise just a very angry, miserable person."
Staples,37spcv,Kal-ElofKrypton,0,Sat May 30 02:46:28 2015 UTC,"And to comment on that, I do also believe that a huge problem is the fact that the HR of this company is there simply to protect management rather than associates.

At first it was just a job for a few months before college, then it was a job on the weekends during college as a part time CP Associate, and now I'm a graduate, working full time as a Team Supervisor. My best friend who I met at my first store also started this way and is moving up as well (Congrats to the company's newest Mobility & Tech Supervisor!). I think it's all a matter of the team you have at your store. If people get along, keep each other happy, the management team really supports everyone, the store will succeed and people will be more likely to stay. Sure, higher ups are out of touch but that'll be true anywhere, retail or not.   I'm also quite proud, like you, to be part of the management team at my store. I also am never ashamed to say where I work and what I do, because people know I'm happy doing it! Do I want to work retail forever? Nah. Is it a good start for me? Absolutely!

Should be no more than 15 min in customers house each trip. You get double the onsite miles because its 2 trips. Works really good for older people or physicaly disabled people who can't leave their house. We use it if the cot gets to a regular onsite and finds out it will take longer than 2 hours to fix. So these days it would be $159 d&r + $50 tech valet = $209 total bill. Credit for onsite, matrix use, and tech $ makes everyone happy."

Staples,37gf6y,dasruski,9,Wed May 27 13:08:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly at my store, we have really focused on printer attachments. Our laptop market is garbage, and trying to push Kiosk is next to impossible when Kiosk for laptops is garbage. Unless you want 1 of our 1000 refurbished windows 7 machines, it's tough to find what the customer wants. Anything moderately high end? forget about it.   Printers and Ink are our bread and butter, so we focus on those (80% inc attachment). It is a lot easier for our store to get a $1000 printer sale with ink/paper/warranty then it is to get a $1000 laptop sale, and there are a lot more profits in printers and ink. Laptop sales are still important, but I suggest really learning your shit about the printers and ink, and focusing on that."
Staples,37gf6y,cherlin,2,Wed May 27 14:43:56 2015 UTC,Oh I've got our printers down. last week we had over 90% attachment rate.
Staples,37gf6y,Kal-ElofKrypton,4,Wed May 27 19:29:12 2015 UTC,"Flip your laptop table POG so that the customer sees the higher priced laptops first. It makes it easier to sell a mid range machine with attachments. If they see the $300 special first, they have cemented that price in their heads. Tech is down. The industry is down. We sell significantly less computers, and that's been dropping the last 3 years. You can do nearly everything on your phone now, except productivity. Know all the weird tech things we sell.. Sugarsync, SSD'S, tech bench AV, etc and get what you can. Don't just rely on the main package."

Staples,37gf6y,easytech109,3,Wed May 27 20:34:22 2015 UTC,Really selling computers in the stores has become more about minimizing losses on computers anyway we can rather than making money.
Staples,37gf6y,BigRichie2897,3,Wed May 27 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"If the company cared about profit they wouldn't send out so many coupons for $100s off of computers. They only care about showing sales to Wall Street so the stock doesn't sink. Even though they are losing money and profit, if they show sales sales sales, the board yells bonus bonus bonus. It's ass backwards and short sited, but honestly at this point it's pretty obvious that Ron and team are just trying to grab every last penny they can before the water gets too high, then they'll take their golden parachute and flee onto their yachts."

It doesn't help that tech sales overall are down in all regions and our area is full of welfare sponges and meth addicts.   The good news? If they managed to steal and pawn enough crap then they might actually be able to afford the tax on the cheap-o laptop they bought and the version of MS Office they stole, not knowing it has to be activated at the register."
Staples,37gf6y,PeopleKillMe,2,Thu May 28 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"Some competitors' extended service contracts are imminently more affordable for consumers - Walmart, for example, has laptop service plans (which include accidental damage from handling coverage) that start at $16.99.  They're usually about a tenth of the item's price.  It's not as hard to get customers to agree to pay $59 to cover their $500 laptop as it is to get them to buy a comparable plan for $199.

Staples,37e4c3,Wannabanana17,1 point,Wed May 27 22:14:06 2015 UTC,The full size balers are the ones that are longer then the pallet and depending on when you make it wider then it.  This was a mid size it's always the length of the pallet but sometimes it's wider.  They make smaller then mid-size balers and I've seen the bales on the return trucks you can put two on a single pallet.  At the store I'm at now we have a full size and I don't care how big it is it will only count as one return space.
Staples,37e4c3,Synnerrs,2,Wed May 27 22:26:56 2015 UTC,They are very heavy but I'm a strong fellow and so are the other two guys.  It took a few seconds but I wouldn't suggest others try it even though I'm thinking of a double stack.

Staples,37f0a9,palehorse864,1 point,Wed May 27 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"That sucks. Any time I have to look up a SKU for a customer, I whip out the smart phone and take a picture. Customer needs ink but only knows the printer model number? I could waste 5 minutes looking through the book, or I could use Google Now voice to look it up as I walk them to the ink wall. I generally have the results by the time I reach it. Is a customer tying up the register looking for a coupon they know they saw online? ""Okay Google, Staples Coupons.""   I could work without my phone, but things wouldn't get done as quickly or efficiently."
Staples,37f0a9,NiBlade,1 point,Thu May 28 22:26:41 2015 UTC,"For me, it's a catch-22.  I handle basically everything that needs handling in either tech or furniture. Because of that, I don't bring my phone on the floor (even if permitted) because corporate is not going to compensate me in the fairly likely event it might break as I'm carrying out a chair or something.  The other side of that is that many of the associates are younger (high school) - admittedly, I'm only in my 20s, but I understand what is expected in a workplace. They don't. Texting, making calls, and otherwise using their phones when there's productive stuff to be doing are regular and rampant, and so management has done their best to crack down on it as far as policy allows.  We only recently got a policy handed down that allows the use of phones for ""customer service purposes"", but it's really just a new vector the younger associates can use to excuse it if they get caught.  I just run to our citrix terminal if I need to look up ink, and I've got most of the common ones memorized, so it's not too hard.  Frankly, I'm blatantly opposed to associates using their personal phones on the floor, but that's mostly because they don't understand appropriate use in my store and I don't want to accommodate them any further."
Staples,37f0a9,YourMomWasEasy,1 point,Fri May 29 01:33:04 2015 UTC,"I can understand not wanting to damage your phone, especially when you do all that. I generally put mine in my pants pocket with the screen facing my thigh, and in a protective hard case, so it's usually only at risk of falling on the corner of a kiosk or something when I'm using it for something.  It's a good idea to be careful about that though.   I understand more about issues with phones due to the age group. We have young folks who are mature enough to stick to business for the most part, so it isn't a problem, but I can also understand how it would be a problem in other stores. Btw, Millenial is kind of a broad term. I'm technically a millenial in some respects since I graduated High School in 2000, but millenials could also be kids 15 years old or younger (born in the new millenium), so I was wondering what you meant for a second there. :)  I can usually help with ink if it's one on our floor, but our customers surprise me with some old ones from time to time. We usually have the ink, it just takes a bit of research."
Staples,37f0a9,magicturdd,1 point,Fri May 29 01:58:50 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  It's really strange some of the stuff they go looking for, but it irks me (and not doubt the customers) when Staples shifts separate cartridges online and to hell with anything but the combo packs. Also awkward for ASP, of course.  IE: A lot of Epson 200+(numberwise) cartridges we only carry the separate black and then the multi-colour pack in store. Pretty awkward when shipping is $15 for anything under $45 (even in the local area).  Plus, as far as phones are concerned my friends and I have very few taboo topics we crack jokes about. It'd probably be best I not risk such a text arriving when the customer may well see it."

Your responsibilities increase a ton. You'll be in charge of a lot of paperwork. You'll be expected to complete zero balance walks (and drops) every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. You'll need to process the open POs. Damages. Cycle Counts. Negative Onhands. Freight. Code 41. Expired products. You'll need to keep up with truck schedules (we're heading into back to school). RTVs and RTWs must be done every week. If something is special order return, you'll need to call the vendors and cross channel for RMAs. You'll also have to ship them out, so learning your way around campus ship is important. If your cashiers are as backed up as mine get, then chances are they're not sorting your recycled ink, which means you'll be doing that. There's more, of course, but those are the biggies. Additionally, if you're in a tier 4 store, you'll also become an MoD- a grey shirt on some days. You'll need to be prepared to open the store, read emails, write down metrics, authorize certain returns (which, by the way, hammer it into your associates' heads that they need to print an extra copy of the receipt on dot com returns- you'll need that order number), and disarm customer conflicts. And like I said, if you were a COT before, you may be expected to fill in as a tech sometimes."

You go from just focusing on half the store to the entire store and most people won't know what you do so they don't help.  You'll often feel like the other associates are in the way because they will be.  Coming from tech makes it worse they'll still ask you to do tech work and help tech customers and they whole time you're talking to a customer about laptops and SquareTrade you're thinking ""Holy Balls!!!  Why the fuck did you call me out here for this shit I have two pallets of totes in the back to sort a damn flash storage cycle count to finish and I just got a BOPIS! Fuck you Staples!!!""  It's a grind but it's the only position I would do in a Staples store, it's Mon-Fri 6-2 or 7-3 whatever as long as you're there to receive truck and do your ZB walks which are typically Mon, Wed, Fri before 9am or 10am.  The rest of the schedule you decide, I know some IAs that work Sundays and take a day off during the week and some that like to close at least once a week.  I am neither of those I do Mon-Fri 6-2 or 7-3 depending on truck.  I'm not hunted down for tech and ESP numbers I'm rarely ever on register and Prime Time doesn't apply to me, I also take lunch and breaks when I want.

Staples,37en9i,Bill_Money,2,Wed May 27 02:50:56 2015 UTC,At my store I would say yes. Mainly because of what dark_not_evil said. The managers here seem to do a good job of supporting our current IA. The biggest thing that would make me hesitate is that at times you are expected to be something like a manager without actually having the title. And at times that really makes a big difference.

Staples,37eeot,staplestwerkteam,7,Wed May 27 00:47:59 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that you focus on doing your job.  There will be changes, you will hear a lot of speculation in your store.  You will read a lot of negativity on reddit.  I seriously doubt ""they"" will clean house UNLESS it is absolutely necessary.  You can think negative and negative things will happen OR you can think positive and go after positive results for yourself.  Given the little details it is purely speculation at this time.  My question would be, why is your GM leaving?  How are your EPP/Tech numbers? How is your IS4C scores? Shrink? Attainment to budget, etc.?"
Staples,37eeot,WhateverItTakes10x,3,Wed May 27 00:51:23 2015 UTC,Is4tc is shit. Absolute shit. The IA doesn't give a fuck and he's affecting everything. My tech dollars and esp. I've hit 7% last few weeks tech dollars struggle. Not sure on shrink. My gm said he found things out about the merger and gm caps that his own business will support him better than the stress of staples.
Staples,37eeot,FaxForRA,4,Wed May 27 01:04:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah about that IA comment, being an IA I can tell you that the IS4TC number is largely affected by pull lists, pack outs and blocking,  which should be done by all the other associates.  The IA can't be the only one doing those things we wouldn't be able to do anything else - RTW/RTV, damages, cycle counts, BOPIS, stockroom organization etc etc.  If pull lists and blocking are done every night (which you can never do with the one person that's always closing in each dept.) then the ZB number should be low but if it's not then the number is high.  Your stores problem may arise when the IA scans a high number then doesn't complete the research, that's not good he should be completing the research and putting pressure on management to see that pull list and blocking is done as much as possible.  As for cleaning house supervisors usually aren't part of that, make sure you keep a good ESP and some high tech dollars and you should be fine."
Staples,37eeot,FaxForRA,3,Wed May 27 01:35:29 2015 UTC,I don't mean to knock IA. My old IA from my old store was a beast. Got everything done. My IA has been in his role since March and still can't finish a zb or cycle in a timely manner. It's not that no one has shown him cause the team sup (old IA) and gm have both on multiple occasions have shown him how to do rtv/rtw he just walks around the store talking about how he just wants to smoke weed and how he hates all the managers.

If it's a positive number, then your store is profitable, and will likely stay open. The higher the number, the better, but average can be anywhere from 5% to 10%.. The highest in my district is around 20%."

Staples,37eeot,NiBlade,2,Wed May 27 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly depends on what your next GM is like also. In my 4 years there have been 3 different GMs in my store. The transition between the first and the second was the roughest.   The entire management crew turned over about 3 months into his time at the store. Although the biggest reason for that was the whole ""reinvention"" thing where they were cutting manager and full time positions like crazy. A lot of associates were also fired both for legitimate and illegitimate reasons. Those who remained slowly started leaving as well just because they didn't really like the new GM.   Recently that GM was promoted and we've had a new GM for about 3 months now. The transition has been different so far. No mass firings, not many people leaving because they don't like the GM either (not that I've heard anyone complain about him). Its been stable to this point, despite what my SSM keeps saying about changes happening and a lot of people being let go."
Staples,37ct28,HahaBidness,5,Tue May 26 18:07:37 2015 UTC,"If your MOD didn't get approval for you to go over hours then the violation falls on the GM/MOD, not the associate.

Staples,37ct28,venturer95,2,Sun May 31 03:25:43 2015 UTC,"Right, Part Time employees cannot work over 25 hours a week due to federal laws. Healthcare reform last year changed the definition of full time from 40 hours a week to 30, and most large businesses sensibly decided to cut back part time hours instead of treat all retail employees as full time. Sucks for part-timers, but unfortunately makes sense. Staples sticks to a 25 hour policy so that once or twice a year they can lift the limit during peak traffic (Back to School and Holiday seasons) and associates will average out below 30 hours."

They will be punished for going over written up or termination. Has nothing to do with the gm only if they get permission will it not come back on the employee. My gm is very straight forward with us and we have had more than a few conversations about this 25hour crap
Staples,37ct28,FormerSCIA,1 point,Tue May 26 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"The only time that seems appropriate is if someone is dicking around, lollygagging when punching out, working for an extended period without permission, ect. That is general time-stealing and is only made worse by the fact that there is strict metric for part time labor/hours. We are always responsible for our own time. If you're staying past your scheduled hours without permission then that's a problem, even when you disregard the part time limit.   Edit: The short is that if you're scheduled over the limit or are cleared by management (hopefully the GM) to go over your limit, that's not your problem. You did your job, and met an urgent business need."

You shouldn't be the one to deal with any problems arising from the extra hours. Your GM will probably get some flak from the DM unless they spoke about the situation. Regardless it's not your problem. It's up to the management team to ensure people are showing up, taking rests/lunches, and punching out at the correct times and in a fluid manner."

I don't want to sound insulting but the particular DCS that my store used had such a horrible track record that I flat out refused to send jobs to them.  Also: I totally know where you are coming from with an account manager. If you think you got it bad with account manager requests the stores have it worse because odds are if they are asking you for that 5000 copy job same day they have already promised it to their customer and then it becomes the stores problem to get it done after you say no.

Retail CopySAT was lower, because stores would put shit in wrong, then blame us for fucking up.  Mistakes definitely happened, but we generally caught them before they went out the door.   The easiest thing you can do to prevent a lot of fuckups is to put a short version of your job specs in the special instructions. Just writing ""Print 4/4 on 28lb paper, trim bleeds 5x7"" or some such helps us make sure that what the ECL ticket says is correct, and also is a nice double check for us when we proof it.  With new changes that have been rolling out though, Final QC is no longer a thing, because that's ""waste."" The new system involves one operator printing, finishing, and shipping an order, whereas the old system had a manager or specialist checking off on every order before it was shipped."

Print is a huge world, and it's not fair to throw someone into it with 30 hours of video training.  We got a lot of things where stores would put tabs in the wrong place (solution designer helped with this some), or would send in files that werent' sized right, then wonder why we didn't magically know to fix them.   A lot of stores would upload like 5-20 files that they wanted combined  with tabs between them, but wouldn't tell us where they wanted the tabs, what order the files should be in, etc. We'd call them up to ask, and get a part timer who had no clue. Part timer would say they'd call their supervisor, and we wouldn't hear anything. At that point, the order goes on hold over night, until we can try again the next morning... and the CPC sup would always be mad at us for this, somehow.   Then there's the thing where the ECL used to automatically add ""head to head"" or ""head to toe"" when you selected Duplex, but not actually ask you which one you wanted. So orders would get fucked up because our ticket says ""duplex head to head"" and the customer wanted it head to toe. Ooops.  There were lots of issues with due dates... stores accidentally clicking the wrong due date, then being upset when we didn't magically know they actually needed their order in 3 days, not a week."

Staples,379mf7,Yellow-Curry,5,Tue May 26 00:32:12 2015 UTC,"Anything that comes from an account manager. Sorry if you're an account manager, but damn. It's like when someone becomes a Staples Account Manager, the part of their brain that determines whether a request is logical or not just shuts off. I've seriously had AMs call at 8:30PM and demand we ship 5000 copies to their customer same day, or 1000 spiral bound books the next day.   Also, those stupid holiday cards. At some points stores started running out of paper, so we were having 50+ orders of those routed to us every day. Literally heaps of the stupid things. Use your DCS more when you can. I know DMs love to spout shit about ""training customers"", but if you can get your high volume customers used to waiting a couple days for their order to come in, it'll save you so much stress.  Plus, it's a guaranteed 70% margin for your CPC on most generic things.  Additionally important to not sucking - the print side of Staples swings way farther and wider than the stores ever see. If a customer comes in wanting a large run of something specialty, odds are it can be done. 4 color raised ink business cards on linen stock? Expensive, but doable. Brochures with a die cut shape? Sure thing. 5000 laminations in a week? You'll have to try harder. The art is in knowing who to reach out to when a customer needs magic worked, because Staples is so fucking disorganized, a retail CPCS will have a hard time just getting a quote for these things, and won't have the tools to have it set up right.  Most importantly, is just learning to let customer bullshit roll off your back, and learning to find solutions that are win-win for you and the customer.  It depends on the store. There are stores that are full of associates who have been CPC for years and know what they're doing, and we might decline one a month. There are stores full of new hires with no fucking clue or print exerience, who refuse to read the decline notes, and have the same order declined back to them 3-4 times before they realize that no, we can't print their customers Greeting Card Builder '95 file. I am a lover of shenanigans. I am a HUGE fan of leaving tons of tiny Nick Cages inside printing equipment. They'll be finding Nick Cage pictures there for years after I'm gone."

Staples,379mf7,venturer95,2,Tue May 26 12:12:44 2015 UTC,"It would be expensive, but should be doable.  Die cutting would be done by a third party, and can be pretty expensive for short runs of custom dies, since an actual die has to be created.   Basically what you need though is a vector file of the die line (ie, the shape you want to cut, at its actual size), and a file that is set up to bleed past the die line.  You would probably want to quote it through SourceExpress, as there's no way to charge correctly through the ECL. They'd need to be printed, scored, die cut, then hand folded."
Staples,379mf7,flypanam,1 point,Tue May 26 13:19:04 2015 UTC,"I've heard that you are in like a backroom of a regular retail store, is that true, and do you ever have to deal with walk-in customers on the retail side sometimes? How many MPS's do you all have? We occasionally get an order from a few customers that consist of several hundred pouch laminations, do you all stand in front of a small little laminator putting pages in pouches and laminating all day or do you have a different process for orders likes this? How do I submit an order of like 2000 post cards or like 1500 business cards for you all to make. I haven't found a way to send those kinds of orders to you all since we got solution builder and our customers love the our matte over the vista print matte. Every time I send something to the DCS for wideformat laminating I always get 5mil laminate not the 3 mil that I request and give the pricing to the customer for. Do you all carry 3mil or do you only have 5mil. I just don't like it when I do part of an order in store and a large chunk done at the DCS and the DCS laminator thickness makes the whole order a little inconsistent.  On a normal week day, how many people are working in the DCS? What machines are you annoyed at most/hate working with? We hate our folding machine because it is tedious to re-align. How wide can your wide format laminate, and what is the largest PML you can do"
Staples,379mf7,flypanam,1 point,Tue May 26 04:11:59 2015 UTC,"Half true. Production Centers (or HUBs) are in the back of stores. DCSs are standalone units, because they weren't originally tied to retail. DCSs were originally created to corner the contract print market, and were tied to retail later. Some redundant PCs were merged in, but some still exist, like St Petersburg, FL and Strongsville, OH. Even then the PC in the back is completely separate from the store, and customers never see it. We have 5-6 computers on the floor, but they aren't really MPSs. We each have a network login on a roaming profile, so we can login anywhere, with Creative Suite and our other tools present. Most DCS/PCs just have pouch laminators, but the Atlanta DCS has a high speed roll laminator that can automatically cut to size. If you route a job to your DCS for like 200 pouches, they'll send it to Atlanta for production, since they can knock that out in under an hour. I haven't used solution builder, it rolled out like a month after I left the store. If you select 110lb cardstock, but in the special instructions put 12pt BCIM Matte, you should be able to get that paper.  This drove me nuts when I was in the store too. We only carry 5mil. Our colored papers/cardstocks are a different brand too, so they often don't match up either.  Most DCSs run 3 shifts, with 5-8 people on per shift. Depends on the DCS and the time, really. Third shift has the most operators. I liked my folding machine in the store more than the one at the DCS. That thing was a total shitlord, but it would do glossy paper without a problem.  I really hated out big BW printers. 30 feet long, and they loved to jam. Most DCSs have a 60 inch WF laminator. The boards are 40x60 I believe, but you'd want to call and check."

Staples,37a081,eternistarr,2,Tue May 26 03:30:16 2015 UTC,"Well, it is a joke at times but not all stores suck at the safety bingo and associate of the month awards. I made it a point when I moved to the TS position that associate recognition/appreciate was important to me, and I started safety bingo back up and my Ops Manager (new to my store) and I selected Associate of the Month as well as discretionary points for one person in each department."
Staples,37a081,venturer95,3,Tue May 26 15:21:04 2015 UTC,"Bless you. Seriously, it means a lot when it's kept up on - when it's left to stagnate (we went without an Employee of the Month for over a year) it starts to feel really bull-shitty when you get 10 points here and there when the GM remembers to do it."
Staples,37a081,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Tue May 26 22:38:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there is no point. I don't get the star points at all. My manager usually gives them out to a random person at the end of the month, or doesn't give them out at all! To make matters even better, the amount of points you need to actually get ANYTHING is absurd. It's just another Staples program that will fade out within a few months. Just like the daily e-tips. And the Inspired Selling Passports."
Staples,37a081,AppleTree90,1 point,Tue May 26 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"You guys are still doing the Inspire selling passports? Lucky. The program relaunched in Canada as Inspired Selling Plus last August, and I didn't see anyone above my pay grade even bring it up until mid October 2014 even though I had asked for the training booklets.  We ""started"" getting associates to watch the videos, in fragments because there's no hours, and I don't think we ever started using the passports officially.  I truly miss when there was enough time and hours given by HQ to have employee training duo tangs with checklists AND then also have enough staff to cover the floor while they do the training."
Staples,37a081,kirashi3,2,Wed May 27 02:44:44 2015 UTC,"hahah that thing was such a crock of shit, my GM made this big deal about it, took over a whole corkboard in our breakroom to display the ""passports"" and then nothing happened with it ever again. I wonder if they're still there lol"
Staples,37a081,dr_xadium,1 point,Wed May 27 11:18:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right. We've got the 10 step posters up in my tech room, but they haven't been looked at since being put up. Like your passport cork board.  I'm all for the program, but if store management can't launch it right, mostly due to a lack of staff and hours for floor coverage, it can't be good for bidness. I'd gladly take on the role of National Sales Trainer for Staples. Microsoft has one, HP has one, heck even Apples own Stores get visited by a team from Cupertino to make sure they're up on training."
Staples,37a081,kirashi3,1 point,Wed May 27 19:25:05 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, agreed. We also have a whole corkboard in our breakroom dedicated to them. In fact, they stayed there, collecting dust until I personally threw them out about a month ago. Haha, most of their owners have long since quit. I asked my manager if he was keeping them for some special reason. Nope. Shortly after that, I found several boxes of businesses cards belonging to employees that haven't worked for Staples in more than 2 years. Needless to say, I am the only one who cleans around here... sigh."
Staples,37a081,AppleTree90,2,Thu May 28 07:20:35 2015 UTC,"No, we're not still doing them. I started working at Staples just after the passport thing, but from what I hear from the two coworkers who have been there longer than me, our GM made a HUGE deal out of them for about 2 weeks. And then that was it. And I'm at a Canadian Staples as well! Inspired Selling Plus has been brought up once or twice in our store. So seldom that I honestly forgot that it was a thing... Agreed though, we too have about 0 hours dedicated to training. Really unfortunate."
Staples,37a081,AppleTree90,1 point,Thu May 28 07:15:00 2015 UTC,"About three weeks before I finally left our store met some sales metric because an office max closed nearby (actual email said ""Staples Competitor Closing – Sales Lift Goal Award Notification"" as the subject).  Nobody in the store had heard about it before we got the award but i got 2757 points from it."
Staples,37a081,president_beef,1 point,Tue May 26 04:47:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah all worthless. I haven't seen any star points in about a year. Used to give them to ET for ESP sales and have monthly ""events"". One example was an associate would get a certain amount of star points for selling HP printers. They got rid of both and went with that $1 SPIFF for selling ESP. And now they've gotten rid of that so there's bonus of any kind. Well not for us anyway, I'm sure the higher ups still see bonuses."

Staples,37a081,sldsld08,0,Sun May 31 04:45:43 2015 UTC,"Your AM and GM have 50 every month to give out ""just because"" and then 50 for associate of the month and Safety Bingo points, which can get up to like 175 or something.  So they're obviously not keeping up with it.   I don't really earn them anymore because I really have no way to, but as a cashier I built up to around 350 and got a bunch of movie tickets, and they were all from my GM.  Start randomly recognizing people for doing a good job. Peer to peer recognitions automatically enter you and the person you recognize into a contest (I won 30 points from one once), and it's kinda fun and might get the ball rolling for your GM and AM to get their shit together with Stars.   Yeah, it's kind of a stupid program, but it's better than nothing."
Staples,37a081,Downstockforwhat,2,Tue May 26 02:42:37 2015 UTC,Wait.. so Stars has been around for I guess 2 years now and you used to be a cashier during that time and are an Assistant/Sales/Ops Manager now? Do tell..

Staples,377g1f,awaynamethrow,6,Mon May 25 16:58:32 2015 UTC,Yep. Part Time Employees will receive time and a half and Full Time Employees will receive double time and a half if they are scheduled. Full Timers will still receive normal pay for the day if they are not scheduled as well.
Staples,377g1f,shadowstewie,3,Mon May 25 17:39:17 2015 UTC,There is no double time and a half. Just time and a half for full timers too.
Staples,377g1f,Kal-ElofKrypton,3,Mon May 25 17:54:04 2015 UTC,sort of double time in a half when you consider full timers get payed 7.5 hours of work on top of any pay they get for the day.

Staples,377mrp,Doominated,1 point,Mon May 25 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"If you want, research around to find what the proper checksum for the legitimate .ISO file is, then run a checksum calculator on the .ISO you download, and make sure they match. This should give you about 99.9% certainty that you've got an unaltered file.  Also, definitely check uploader rep and comments, as the previous commenter said. If you don't want to go to all the trouble of checking checksums, that's the next best way to be reasonably certain you've got the right file.  Also, if you want to save your OEM disc to a flash drive instead of a disc, I think Microsoft makes a utility that will allow you to make a bootable flash drive with the ISO. Google around for it, or you can download Rufus, which isn't Microsoft sanctioned, but accomplishes the same thing."

We actually have a ""paycheck box"" in the managers office that the GM puts everyone's in. We just pick it up after our shifts.  We had the option for direct deposit, but I didn't want to go that route. I prefer having a physical check. I just remote deposit it when I get home."
Staples,3765ss,mr-octo_squid,-4,Wed May 27 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"it comes to the store Wednesday or Thursday and put in the cash office. Your check doesn't get mailed to you home, it goes to the store.  Edit: So Every single Friday I have at least 5 associates in my store (CA) whom get paper checks, I myself go into the cash office and grab their checks for them. Maybe different states do it different? But at least at my store, we get them shipped to us via Ups in a cardboard envelope that goes straight into our cash office."
Staples,3765ss,cherlin,2,Mon May 25 05:25:04 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect information.  As WhateverItTakes10x says below, the checks are mailed directly to your home.  To my knowledge the checks are mailed Thursday which means that they may not arrive on Friday.  They may arrive Saturday, or even Monday."
Staples,3765ss,SuperGenericMoniker,0,Mon May 25 12:41:48 2015 UTC,"It must be different in different states. In California at least we receive checks via UPS to the store on Thursday. They are cut and shipped on Wednesday, and overnight-ed to the store. Then they go straight into our cash office and we distribute them on Friday. I know this because I literally hand out checks to people every single Friday.   I suppose it is possible different states do it differently?"
Staples,3765ss,cherlin,1 point,Mon May 25 16:25:46 2015 UTC,"I assumed that would be the case, obviously my manager has no experience with paper checks.. Would you happen to have either a cooperate number or a website I could reference?"
Staples,3765ss,WhateverItTakes10x,4,Mon May 25 06:10:23 2015 UTC,Actually the checks DO get mailed to the associate's listed address.  We have had 3-4 associates not have checking accounts and their checks were mailed to their house UNLESS there was a holiday THEN it would go to the store.
Staples,3765ss,dissqrl,1 point,Mon May 25 06:17:29 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  I received paper checks (which, except for the first one, were mailed to my house) till a mix-up caused multiple associates to get checks with the same number.  A stop payment was put on the checks and I went overdraft as a result.  I switched immediately to direct deposit."
Staples,3747rk,DirectFire,10,Sun May 24 18:52:56 2015 UTC,"Come on corporate! Stop reprinting tags that don't change. The only reason you need to do this is if you shorten a sale, which is misleading when I tell a customer they sales good through a date, only to put a tag over it with the same sale because it ends earlier now.  With all the printing for every store for all the signs I figure they could get electronic signs set to current planograms. An investment for sure, but one that would save tons of labor ink, and paper."
Staples,3747rk,gtnover,5,Sun May 24 20:29:07 2015 UTC,we need guns like they have at walmart where it prints out a individual tag instead of using a whole sheet of paper for a couple of tags.

Staples,375e0w,staplesmanager,2,Mon May 25 23:29:38 2015 UTC,I'm over in Ontario. District 7. We're one of the first stores to be testing it out. So far no problems.
Staples,371ska,168XXXX,4,Sun May 24 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"Tags are like phone calls. People may pay attention to the ones pertaining to their departments, but when it's all said and done, tags are everybody's job. When the store is closed and tags are being worked, everyone should be involved in the process. Even cashiers who don't know the store can be handed a stack of tags for a particular area (like furniture pad, pens, etc) and learn the sections while putting tags out. There is no excuse to just stand their wasting payroll while a couple workers shoulder the burden. I'd have a calm conversation with your manager, point out the situation, and express the desire for everyone to be contributing. If he/she is rational, they will agree, and convey to the team the fact that all associates must contribute. If not, well, hang in there bud."
Staples,371ska,StaplesArbitor,1 point,Sun May 24 01:57:01 2015 UTC,"Our cashiers just kinda sit either in the office or around the front end and text all night. They're dutiful to their returns and damages/ink/whatever else, but then that's it for them.  As mentioned above, the closing manager really doesn't want anything to do with it, either. Any time I mention problems, be they in the department, the floor, or among other people ( who are legitimately just NOT doing their job; I don't like to whine to management about every little thing ), I get kind of shrugged off or an 'ok'."
Staples,371ska,lolnefarious,1 point,Sun May 24 02:15:59 2015 UTC,What time do you guys start your signage?  I'm a T4 store and we typically start pulling signs from 5 - 6.  We close at seven and are rarely in past 715.
Staples,371ska,venturer95,1 point,Sun May 24 02:55:58 2015 UTC,"We started pulling at about 7 - 7:30, we didn't actually leave the store until about 9:25 ( we close at 9 )"

Staples,371ska,figjam13,1 point,Sun May 24 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind, however, we were not finished. Had to do more tags today."
Staples,371ska,yemman,3,Sun May 24 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"The quickest solution is to bring it up with your closing supervisor.  If they are not willing or are a part of the problem, just move up the chain of command.  Just remember, you're a team.  Sometimes its not about throwing people under the bus.  Instead focus on letting them know it's taking longer because they aren't helping.  I know that sounds like a cop out answer, but it's as much about the culture of your store as it is anything else."
Staples,371ska,Kal-ElofKrypton,3,Sun May 24 01:55:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty much my closing manager hits on people and joins in the texting parade. It's pretty depressing. I've mentioned it to the GM ( who is usually pretty good about this sort of stuff ), but nothing's happened, unsurprisingly.  Personally, not having a life to go back to, I just kinda take my time."
Staples,371ska,Kal-ElofKrypton,3,Sun May 24 02:13:27 2015 UTC,In my store the one person closing os does the os signs and the one person closing easy tech does the easy tech.. although I seem to be the only person in easy tech that can complete the signs on Saturday night. I always seem to have to do the tags on Sunday when I don't close Saturday hell last week I took the whole weekend off and came in to close on Monday and surprise there were 3 aisles and the printer signs that didn't get put up.
Staples,371ska,yemman,2,Sun May 24 03:01:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, pretty much this. I hate to be ""that guy"" but I literally couldn't even finish tonight because they wanted to leave and we had so much shit left over, largely because I was finding tags from -April- still hanging around and had to double check every department."
Staples,371ska,gimzi,3,Sun May 24 03:18:45 2015 UTC,"dude you are like me mirrored. I didn't work tonight, but when I did, the OS folks and the CPC people wouldnt let me get me get my tags out because they wanted to go home or to the bar or whatever. I hardly work saturday anymore because that would push me over 25 hours but I'd bet my entire net worth (which includes some rare pistols) that I'll have a stack of sales tags tomorrow. I'll be lucky if they are sorted, and I'll be super fucking lucky if they pulled the ones that expired tonight."
Staples,371ska,PeopleKillMe,3,Sun May 24 03:51:42 2015 UTC,"Follow your leader. Text away! When tags don't get done and they are doing price overrides for 3 days, it'll fall back on him/her."
Staples,371ska,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE,2,Sun May 24 03:03:57 2015 UTC,"The thing is, is that they don't give a shit. This is a store where the moment anyone uses the radio, they're usually mocked behind their backs and groans of ""UGH"" come from coworkers, especially management.  When asked for managers, they're more keen on telling us to deal with them than coming out themselves. ""Just tell them I said this"", etc. As far as prices go, if customers find old tags, we do pull them but it's kind of an 'eh throw it out' deal, AFAIK."

Staples,371ska,trombonetom13,2,Sun May 24 03:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was like that on weekends, especially before they got rid of the Team Sups. You can say what you want about how it was ""bad bidness"" to get rid of the team sups but all the full time supervisor did at my store on the weekends was stand around and make $2 more an hour than me to sit around for an hour around the time clock while I was putting out sales tags and such. It pissed me off and I was glad when she got cut back to part time and got a paycut.  Yeah but the staples way seems to be ""whomever will actually put in work, fuck em let em, if they are lazy, fuck em let em we're not gonna fire them"". I am not lazy because I was not brought up that way, and it makes time pass by faster. Also I thought it might get me more hours/more pay. Goddamn if I wasn't wrong."
Staples,371vo1,gtnover,6,Sun May 24 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"I just tell the customer that the device is no built by Staples and the warranty must be called in. Point out the number on the box. Then I say something along the lines of ""We can't offer warranty assistance in-store"" and thats it.  If the bird brain customer still can't fathom it then they get a long winded explanation of how warranty/RMA processes work including interaction with someone you probably wont be able to understand and expensive shipping to a repair facility."
Staples,371vo1,im_sn0w,2,Sun May 24 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"Well if you don't know who manufactured it, and staples appears to be the manufacturer, you can't really say it's not built by staples. This is why I want more info on who actually builds it. It still works to explain the separation between the people who build it and the store. But are they really bird brain for going to staples when staples is the manufacturer and it has a manufacturer warranty for a year? This really isn't clear cut and I'm going to explain it to everyone who buys one from here on out."

Staples,371vo1,john_dune,2,Sun May 24 06:02:21 2015 UTC,"In that case, I tell them this:  ""While staples purchases a product and bring it in, we can only replace it under the terms of the people we purchase the products from, they only provide us with 14 days/30 days from date of our sale, so after that you have to deal directly with the manufacturer.  If you were to use us to deal with it, we would have to charge you for shipping it out to the depot for repairs, whereas if you contact the company, many offer free shipping to the authorized owner of the product, and that itself will save you $20 (on a small item)/$50 (on something like a monitor).""  This usually pacifies them a little bit."
Staples,371vo1,FaxForRA,4,Sun May 24 12:03:24 2015 UTC,"Don't try so hard just explain the policy while letting them know you'll try to help.  If you tell them you'll see what you can do they'll listen.  After you explain the return policy and how SquareTrade would have helped them you can get them the number from the back of the shredder or the Staples customer service number from the website.  Just remember it's not that they don't understand how the warranty works it's they don't like the process.  It's a Staples brand shredder so to them it should be handled in the stores and if they complain to customer service your GM will get a call saying ""Handle your bidness take care of the customer"".  If it's within 30 days you can still do a return, just say ""I'm going to try and do an exchange we're really not supposed to do this but if you get the SquareTrade I think I can run the transaction through the register, that way you're guaranteed a refund for two years.""  If they say yes great you have a SquareTrade sale.  If they say no then try the transaction at the register, stop half way and say it wouldn't go through, then say ""Wait I think I can...let me see if this works...""  Then just start the return again stop half way and say ""No, that didn't work and there's no override prompt so you'll have to call the warranty number sorry I tried""  By now they'l think you really wanted to help them and they'll thank you for trying.  You have to make it look like you wanted to do it for them but the system wouldn't let you."
Staples,371vo1,F1T2T5S6,3,Sun May 24 13:19:37 2015 UTC,the number is on the back of the shredders
Staples,371vo1,JoshyyB,3,Sun May 24 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"Geeze, this literally sounds like deja vu!  Had a customer come in with a 15-cut shredder today that just stopped shredding (most likely due to a gear coming lose), and came in looking to exchange it for a new one in the store.  Obviously this is a no-go and we tried our best to help her (because she did have squaretrade, who she called and was directed to call the Staples hotline because it was still under the 1 year warranty), but the Staples hotline wasn't open because it wasn't a business day.  Additionally, to make matters worse, the guy from Squaretrade told her that she could come in and just exchange it for a new one in the store (""Fuck you Squaretrade Matt"" for providing the wrong information).  Without saying too much, she was pissed (and I wholeheartedly expect a red alert resulting in us having to oblige with her demand for a new shredder, and that she is never going to get Squaretrade ever again)."
Staples,371vo1,JoshyyB,2,Sun May 24 13:38:34 2015 UTC,"So the higher ups in the company make it policy not to do this. However anytime a customer complains, they get their way.  My customer did not buy square trade. Their shredder was purchased almost a year ago. They contacted the number on the back of the shredder, and shipped theirs out and received a new shredder that didn't work out of the box.   I explained this is the importance of square trade. I called my gm and I was told to coupon out the amount she paid towards a new shredder.  She didn't have a receipt and when I explained I needed it, but before I could say I can help her look it up, she freaked out and said she shouldn't need it. I explained I don't know if she paid 2 dollars after coupons or 200 so I wouldn't know how much to credit her without it.   She says it shouldn't matter, she should be reimbursed for the expired coupons too.  I drew the line there and said no. I will only give you what you paid for. They said they would come back when my gm is in.  If she credits them back the full amount (100 when they only paid 80) then why would anyone ever buy square trade."
Staples,371vo1,sleasytechpro,2,Sun May 24 13:50:55 2015 UTC,"Seriously, there is just such a large disconnect between higher-ups in the company and the retail level associates/managers that it really astounds me.  Customers can literally just complain about anything, and basically corporate just gets on their hands and knee's and obliges without even understanding the entire situation.    Additionally, this is why I love it when people don't buy Squaretrade, and their device breaks.  Like someone came in with a computer 9 months after purchasing it and the video card went out, and they demanded a new computer (obviously I felt bad for the guy because that's a crappy circumstance, but he couldn't get it through his head that an extended warranty would have covered him).  Or, even better yet, every time you sell an Apple product and they don't get Apple Care, I cringe a little bit.  Mainly because I know that they are going to call back in a week or a month and ask me questions about it.  It's at this point that I say to either call an Apple store (because I know that they won't assist them after 30 days and tell them that they should have bought Apple Care), or just explain to them that they can still come in and purchase Apple Care which guarantee's them the service they require (obviously assuming it's still under the 60 days of the original purchase)."
Staples,371vo1,JoshyyB,3,Sun May 24 14:02:57 2015 UTC,Apple care + must be purchased at checkout same time as the original purchase.
Staples,371vo1,kirashi3,1 point,Sun May 24 14:44:07 2015 UTC,I thought the training said that it can be purchased within 60 days of the purchase (they just have to go to Apple Care and purchase it)?
Staples,371vo1,exile0514,2,Sun May 24 21:40:06 2015 UTC,"Correct. They must either visit an actual Apple Store and have their iPad inspected by an actual Apple employee, or call into AppleCare and purchase it over the phone. Even calling in Apple may ask the customer to ship the iPad in to an Apple repair centre for inspection, so the best course is to buy it at the store."
Staples,371vo1,ienom,2,Sun May 24 21:51:54 2015 UTC,"Say: ""The shredder will only be able to be returned/exchanged within 14 days with us and after that, you will have to go through the manufacturer for any issues or technical support""   Then tell them about squaretrade and if they decline that, than that's their problem and their is nothing I will do in store unless corporate gives me a call."
Staples,371vo1,jammnpenguin,2,Sun May 24 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"I just advise the customer that, while we are Staples, the Staples repair facility handles all warranty claims with our products. We do not have the capacity to repair shredders in store and our repair facility makes the determination rather the product is repaired or replaced at no charge to you. Then you can point them to the number on the box"
Staples,371vo1,staplesmanager,1 point,Sun May 24 17:56:13 2015 UTC,"Simple. Offer Square Trade. Explain that after 14 days they would not be able to return it to the store as we only handle discrepancies on a retail (sales) level. In the event that they encounter an issue with the product within the one year warranty, they will either have to call the number on the box (which they will toss out) it all 1800 STAPLES and get in touch with the warranty department."

Staples,370nun,lultech,4,Sat May 23 19:37:56 2015 UTC,That's isn't right at all. There should be communication between the head tech and at least one other person so that when they are not there the other person can handle things. Just going oh well she's not here is very bad customer service.
Staples,370nun,eternistarr,1 point,Sat May 23 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"There are a few people other than her and myself that still care about this store that have tried to intervene (most of our regulars request this person specifically) but every time we try we're shutdown. The excuse is always that the numbers aren't high enough to warrant it even if there are loads of pcs back there. She's run OT multiple times trying to keep up with everything. I've seen a few occasions where they've gone to the SSM or GM for help and they've simply said ""figure it out"". I was under the impression the techs were to check on matrix PCs both in the morning, and at night. That's never done because we aren't allowed. I don't want to go to the GM or the SSM about my concern because I don't want to put my already low hours job on the line, or get involved in a phasing, but if this keeps going we're going to lose our customer base, and morale in this store is so low it's absolutely ridiculous."
Staples,370nun,eternistarr,1 point,Sat May 23 20:47:28 2015 UTC,They should be checked on first thing then every few hours. PCs don't magically get finished because matrix is now involved yes it helps some but they are not a solution to remove techs completely it can't be and never will be. I suppose if you can't get them to help go higher like your dm. Have your customers fill out the survey since it sounds like PCs are not getting done very quick.
Staples,370nun,elentirion,2,Sun May 24 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"Everyone in the department and every manager/supervisor should be able to perform an intake and pickup.  Every one of them should be hooking up new intakes to Matrix as they come in.  Each opener (at least) should be checking the work orders to see if Matrix needs something such as a reconnect.

The problem with most of these guys is they are young, inexperienced, but think they know everything. There's been a few times where data backups have been done incorrectly (on my day off) leading to things like outlook or quickbooks not being backed up, which is a big flub. With most of them its not their skill level that's the problem, but their lack of willingness to learn. It's an ego thing.  Just to kind of try to tell the other side of the story here."

Staples,370nun,Bokchoi75,1 point,Mon May 25 02:15:04 2015 UTC,Managers need to be held accountable for all the stupid shit they do. If I was the tech person getting phone calls being bitched out because a computer wasn't done due to the manager not doing it (and not letting anyone else do it either) I'd simple page the manager and let them explain their idiocy to the customer.
Staples,370nun,Bokchoi75,1 point,Sat May 23 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"Like I said, our SSM doesn't touch tech, there is no alternative technician and the GM fully supports it.

The only person ever held accountable is the head tech, it's gotten to the point where she has to literally call customers and tell them when she'll be back to finish their PC and hope for the best. (I usually catch those calls when I'm working her day off -_-)"
Staples,370nun,gimzi,1 point,Sat May 23 22:46:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. Every time a customer is bitching because something isn't done she should just tell the customer that she is the only person allowed to work on the computers per management and that the managers and other tech associates do not touch them. Then page the manager over to deal with the angry customer. Takes the customers anger away from her and onto the management team who now have to explain their stupidity to the customer.

Staples,36y762,chug_norris55,6,Sat May 23 03:28:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, you will get applicants, but likely not many that are better than the people you are already firing (or harassing to the point of making them quit). Staples has a bad name at the moment. You will not attract quality talent with the black cloud surrounding the Staples name, nor the fact that not even stores that made their CSAT and sales budgets received full bonuses in the last three years.   They don't care. Just like CompUSA, just like Circuit City, they are intentionally driving the company into the ground so they can post good results this quarter and get bonuses.   At the end of the death march, pieces of shit like this will likely short the stock in addition to getting golden parachutes while the workers get fucked in the ass.    If you continue to talk to people the way you do ( and I think you know exactly what I mean here), statistically you will eventually pick the wrong person, on the wrong day, to harass. And you may come to deeply regret it.    Except the sociopaths running businesses into the ground get away with it, time after time because the rest of us aren't inherently violent and lack the resolve to actually do anything.   Take for example the normalized abuses such as those experienced during the heyday of Carnegie Steel - where people regularly died in the workplace as a direct result of incredibly dangerous conditions that management refused to correct in incredibly profitable steel mills. Only after the pinkertons were hired to attack the Homestead strikers with rifles, firing blindly into a crowd and killing 9 people, only 1 man tried to kill Frick.   So no, there won't be violence. It's arguable as to whether we need it, but ultimately that's a largely theoretical question because we as the masses don't believe in its use, regardless of how many people have died, how many people will inevitably die. Put another way, we value their lives more than our own.  And they know this. And will continue."

You can also just call another employee over, as the store's IA I get called for most customer issues and no where on my name tag does it say manager, but the customer assumes I have that authority because I was called over.

The three of us who want out are two techs and one OS. The two techs are the only two true techs in the store. The OS is one of the best OS closers we have and does signs regularly. If the three of us left, the store would be pretty crippled.   If something like this happened, I'd fall back onto my full time job in a heartbeat. I'm just waiting for that one thing to put me over the edge. I'm working 60hr work weeks between my full time job and Staples right now.

I have yet to see a way for an associate that is truly being wronged to get help. If the GM is a good person they can sometimes remedy the situation but more often than not they are part of the issue.

Staples,36xn2x,BubbleWrapLampShade,3,Fri May 22 23:37:05 2015 UTC,Whenever your manager edits your time you see a message about it when you punch in.  Just check in Time Manager to see what was changed.  At the end of the week just check your time card in Time Manager to see the the hours you worked for each day and print it from there.
Staples,36xn2x,FaxForRA,3,Fri May 22 23:49:19 2015 UTC,"Will that show the edits, as well? I've never done that before."
Staples,36xn2x,FaxForRA,1 point,Sat May 23 00:19:21 2015 UTC,"I believe so.  In Time Manager there's a section to approve manager edits, if you don't approve them in a certain amount of time the edits auto approve and nothing shows in that section.  Those type of edits include if you forget to punch in/out and they have to add it for you, this is where most edits happen and time can be lost.  For example if you stay an hour late one day and don't punch out you should let your manager know ASAP and have them punch you out.  If you forget they're just going to punch you for the time you were scheduled and you loose an hour.  It's really important to always remember to punch in and out and then check your time card in Time Manager to see each day you worked and the accumulated hours you have"
Staples,36xn2x,0wlitch,1 point,Sat May 23 00:41:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure about this, but it's possible managers have an option to turn that message off. I recently received a message saying my time card was edited after I punched out instead of punching in one day, and my manager fixed it, but I had a long list of edits the week before that I didn't get messages for on two other separate occasions.  To see edits, you can go to My time Manager >> My Time Card >> Audits >> all I believe."
Staples,36xn2x,FaxForRA,2,Sat May 23 01:55:10 2015 UTC,That's why it's important to check the time card at the end of the week so you know the total hours worked for each day and the weeks total.  If there are any missing punches like a punch in and no punch out then they can't release the payroll until it's fixed.  So if you print out the end of week totals and all the punches are accounted for then there should be no reason for any adjustments and the hours should match up.

Staples,36xn2x,MakeBidnessHappen,2,Sat May 23 05:46:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly what it's called because I'm not at work, but there should be a tab labeled ""Audits"" or something similar below the actual timesheet. (I know you also have to select 'All' from a dropdown menu too once on the Audits page.) On there it details every change that was made to your card, including both punches you made and edits from management. The employee ID for each edit are also listed for you, so you can see which manager made the change and talk to them about it if they made a mistake."

So they kept her up on register.  I've never seen someone be so adamant about wanting to be over in CPC like this girl. It was downright annoying. Almost every shift I worked with her, she would creep over to CPC and try to look over my shoulder at what I was doing so she could ""learn"" because no one would train her.  One of my last days there, she came into CPC and caught me looking at the Staples Stars site and told me how she really wanted points. She then told me, ""Oh man... I want some cool stuff. That's the main reason I want to be over in CPC.""  It took me a year and a half to save up enough to get the keyboard and two gift cards I got.  I totally understand your frustration though.

The moment you are handing out cards, you have tainted the sample and it is grounds for termination, it's actually covered specifically in the Ethics training.

Staples,36s6ym,Synnerrs,1 point,Thu May 21 23:04:11 2015 UTC,This isn't official company documentation so you don't have to sign it. Sounds like it's a way for your GM to terminate anyone at any time for poor number.

I only work weekends, so I suspect it dropped during the week; there was a big stack of them sitting in the office with every other associate's signature on them. I wasn't asked to sign one, but I presume it's because they assumed everyone had signed one by now.  I did notice that our template was slightly different. The language about ""up to, and including termination"" and ""black-and-white"" was gone. I heard third-hand that my GM had some objections when it was pushed on him by the DM, so I think one of them might have edited the ""commitment"" to be a bit more palatable.  I get a full-time Paycheck from my other job that nets me about 10 times as much as my Staples paycheck (not including the platinum Union healthcare plan or other perks of the other job). So if stupid stuff like this continues, I'll walk. Honestly, having my weekends (and paid holidays and personal days) to myself rather than giving them to Staples would probably save me a lot of stress."

When you purchase something (anything with a cc) the funds to into an escrow account set up by your credit card company (pending). Once a retailer finalised your purchase with you ( in this case, you pick up your bopis) your cc company releases the funds to the vendor. However, if the retailer does not provide a good or service to you, yet the funds have gone into escrow (pending) then the retailer will not have access to the pending funds and they will be released back to you by your credit card company once they go idle (3 to 7 business days depending).  Staples has no control over releasing your pending funds back to you. If it is pending it means we have never so much as seen your money. Call your credit card company, but know this is not staples fault at all, and the funds never left your posession, only went into escrow."
Staples,36uhv4,cherlin,-1,Fri May 22 14:32:12 2015 UTC,I'm aware that Staples doesn't have my money but perhaps if they would wait to charge my card until they have confirmed they have the product on hand then this wouldn't be an issue.

This way the big shots can walk through the store with their rose colored glasses and think everything is fine. Then when things aren't going well they can blame the associates, cause when they were in the store everything looked good. They have no idea about how the stores actually run, they want to know numbers because that's all they know, numbers, from some report that landed on their desk that same morning. They don't want to hear real, honest feedback, cause that means they aren't doing something right and it makes them look bad. When they travel first class to corporate and Otis or Ron ask them why sales are down and things are so bad, they say "" I was in these stores recently and the stores were clean and looked good, so payroll must not be the issue, we must have bad managers and associates"". It's so laughable, I can't wait until this company folds and all these lies and cover ups come crashing down and all these district and regional assholes are laid off. Of course I'm sure they will all get nice fat severance packages.

Staples,36ra0j,ccap17,4,Fri May 22 02:13:59 2015 UTC,"Story time! (wall of text).  When I was a brand new tech for Staples I got to experience my first visit with our DM and I believe our regional VP Matt Navaro.  Iv'e never seen managers so stressed out before and of course I was not prepped properly than the general advice of stay busy and get to all customers.  Well that day was my lucky day and I had just walked out of the tech room and look who stops me.  Da man himself Matt Navaro.  I could tell both DM and GM were nervous as all hell as Matt Navro seemed excited to drill the new employee.  He had me ""role-play"" an entire take in process.  Overall I did quite well looking back and he said I liked how I explained certain upgrades in terms easily understandable.  He did have one suggestion though. He said if a customer is having internet speed issues I should show them and explain how we can correct that issue.  After he read my puzzled look on my face he guided me to our networking section.  He then started his glorious rant on how we could upgrade their existing router and how it would greatly increase there speed and how we could send out a technician blah.. blah.. blah...  He seemed quite impressed with himself and of course the yes men,  DM and GM, nodded as if they were impressed.  He then noticed my face as I did not looked so impressed.  He followed up with ""any questions?"" I said ""no,  I do have some suggestions though.""  He seemed somewhat excited and curious and nodded.  I replied with, ""What you just said makes every day harder for my entire department and especially me because the information you gave out is incorrect.""  My DM and GM's jaw dropped. I then explained that there are many factors to internet speed that we (Staples) could not and most likely will never be able to address.  I then went on to explain what a router actually does for a customer and how their IP is mainly responsible for their speed.  I then told him that it was promises like that leads to customers scolding me days later because their internet speeds are still terrible and that now they want a full return on all the work. GM proceeds to bail out of that situation and points to a customer a few aisles over and asked me to help them real quick.  Needless to say I never worked another day when we had another visit.  In fact a few times my days were switched if the DM decided to surprise him.  Many of my associates gave me a pat on the back.  It was a good day. My advice is know your stuff.  The numbers are important and so on but knowing exactly what is killing your business is even more so.  Know what those numbers are.  For example,  know exactly the amount or percentage of computers that have to be altered or worked on to even connect to the matrix.  Know how many times each computer has to be reconnected or cleaned up for the matrix.  Note how long each of these task take.  Not saying blast him with all these numbers when he walks through the door but just be prepared in case he does decide to look down his nose at you.  If it's Dick Nuff visiting then I wouldn't worry about being drilled about numbers he doesn't seem to waste his time with lowely associates.  Enjoy!"
Staples,36ra0j,shiny_red_ball,3,Thu May 21 19:09:18 2015 UTC,Neff still surrounds himself with the retinue and the DM/GM.  Still doesn't talk to the associates.  Not that I'm surprised.
Staples,36ra0j,elentirion,3,Fri May 22 05:39:51 2015 UTC,"Tell them the truth, don't put up a fake front like most GMs/DMs will tell you. That's it. They won't care about you and numbers, you are expendable to them."
Staples,36ra0j,kaiten408,2,Thu May 21 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"Basically know how to make yourself look good to your bosses or they're gonna fucking chew you out. If you don't have something to point to as doing well in your store that's cause for alarm from a managers point of view, like you don't even know how your own store is doing? Just makes them wonder what else you aren't paying attention to."
Staples,36ra0j,vitamintrees,1 point,Thu May 21 15:51:57 2015 UTC,Its been a while since I've been in store during a visit. Usually I just say hello and if they ask me about the numbers then I'll give them an answer (our managers always prepare us for this). But aside from that its not like I go out of my way to show them I know the numbers. I just go about my bidness.
Staples,36ra0j,TEEHEE_NYC87,1 point,Thu May 21 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"Know your weaknesses (but say ""opportunities"" instead) and have a plan to correct them.  Know your strengths, and what you've done to get there.   Any issues found should be noted and have someone (if possible) start correcting them while they're still in the building.  You're likely in my district, maybe even my store.  Good luck!"
Staples,36ra0j,Railman3,1 point,Thu May 21 22:18:49 2015 UTC,"Visits are, sadly, a predetermined show. If they weren't, they wouldn't announce them days in advance. It's a tongue in cheek thing, they don't want to see how things really are, and in turn we look the other way because they let us know they're coming. DMs and other corporate figures come in with a specific plan in mind, and they will manipulate things to justify whatever they want to talk about.  For instance, when the big guys come to visit, if you're part time the odds are high that they'll spend less than a minute talking to you. They'll ask you a question depending on what they want from the conversation. If they're not interested in you, they might ask you something easy like ""Hey, how's sales today?""... but let's say your store's digital receipt numbers are down and that's something they came in WANTING to talk about, they'll ask ""Hey, how many digi-receipts have you gotten today?""  When you inevitably say you don't know, they'll turn to the manager next to them and say ""How can you expect to get results when your associates don't know basics about digital receipts?""  The sad truth is that if they want to humiliate you, they're going to do it to prove a point to your manager, and it doesn't matter what you know. My DM tore into one of my best associates to humiliate me, because he went through my Keys to Lockup and found one in which the girl had written something incorrectly. He called her over and asked her if she knew how to use the key to lockup, and when she said yes he showed her, looked at me and said ""So you have a team that can't read, and you expect to get sales results?""  Your best bet when corporate comes is that they're not visiting because they think there's a problem, because they will use associates to embarrass the management, and some managers will come in and berate that same poor associate for embarrassing them after the DM leaves.   It's a terrible game."
Staples,36sk31,dissqrl,7,Thu May 21 19:52:12 2015 UTC,The print pro training is just a fancy title provided by sitting through hours of computer training with no real world experience. Its also around 20 hrs of training if I remember correctly so good luck having a GM dedicate that much training time to a person who only occasionally covers a department unless your store is really under in hours.  If you are actually interested in becoming a better CPC associate even if its only for the occasional cover I'd recommend buying a little notebook you can carry with you and make notes of jobs that come in that you don't feel comfortable running and then meeting up with the CPC supervisor and filling in the notes on how to complete the task correctly. One of the guys I used to work with had a notebook full of cheat sheets on things like booklets and tabs even after working in the CPC for almost a decade.  Best advice I can give: 99% of customers want their job NOW. 5% of customers actually need their job NOW. If someone comes in with a job you don't feel capable or comfortable completing correctly tell the customer that you are still training in this part of the store and ask if they are able to pick it up later so that you can work with a fully trained associate to ensure its done 100% correct. Most customers will actually be appreciative of you looking out for the quality of their product and agree to get it later giving you time to learn how to do it.

Staples,36nkmr,staplesxp,7,Wed May 20 23:07:39 2015 UTC,A lot of stores weren't keeping up with them properly. Apparently it also helped a lot with Physical Inventories. They were finding that stores had too much inactive/clearance product in the mids/tops and even product that could have easily filled the shelf but associates weren't getting on the tall ladders to pull the boxes down.  I also heard that we are going to be allowed to utilize them for BTS when all of that product comes in so that the back rooms aren't flooded with product.
Staples,36nkmr,csslash,2,Wed May 20 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"I think this came down to personnel not keeping up with where things were. When I used to work for Office Depot, our mid and top stocks were organised by SKU. Each aisle was organised by the first number of the sku so that when you were doing the outs list/pull list, you were able to find where things were and were able to pull down stuff for clearance and everything.   The two stores I worked in were TERRIBLE when it came to even the mid stocks. You had to go hunting all over the place just to find something. And if you found it, chances were it was in an aisle 10 down from where the home location is on the shelf. It made it easier to keep the aisles clean and the top stock clean, too. However, our DMs were not afraid to burn payroll an do overnights on a regular basis to get top stocks filled. I did one the week after Christmas and we had 2 associates and a supervisor and whacked out our entire OS side and tech side in one week with 8.5 hour days."

So our mids are getting jammed with overstock on certain aisles. I can't imagine what BTS is gonna be like with no tops. I'll be gone by then though so I guess I have no need to worry about that.
Staples,36nkmr,BROdo_Baggins,3,Thu May 21 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, they have not figured out that less space available for storing product = DCs need to send less.   If killing overheads actually leads to getting less product I will like this. If they are going to keep sending the same amount of freight then there will be problems company wide.  As far as not keeping up with overheads being the reason for killing them - it all leads back to payroll.  If stores actually received sufficient payroll the overheads would be maintainable. When the only people in OS are scheduled 11-3 for prime time and no OS at night, overheads do not get maintained."
Staples,36nkmr,ccap17,2,Thu May 21 05:36:58 2015 UTC,"At my location they did start sending less of some stuff.  Too little, in fact: we'd get one or two of an item in that we happen to sell dozens of."
Staples,36nkmr,elentirion,1 point,Thu May 21 06:37:41 2015 UTC,"True. Luckily, at a T2 we usually have OS coverage with open/mid/close but I only work weekends to throw load so I don't really have to deal with it much."
Staples,36nkmr,BROdo_Baggins,1 point,Thu May 21 05:46:13 2015 UTC,"It may just be my location, but this made all of the floor employees jobs much harder. It has now become a game of either cram stuff behind other things or risk putting it in the top stock hoping no one will notice. Needless to say this has made the key outs on night pull lists go way up. No one can find things when they are buried deep below 5 boxes of other items that we had to open."
Staples,36nkmr,HoboHunter657,1 point,Thu May 21 06:55:32 2015 UTC,Ha I'd like to see them try with my store we have pretty much zero storage anywhere else in the store. Our receiving area can barely fit the pallets they send us
Staples,36nkmr,figjam13,1 point,Sun May 24 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"We've reduced inventory in stores to lower expenses -- not only is there less need for top stocks due to the reduced amount of inventory, but also makes it more likely inventory is in a sellable position."
Staples,36nkmr,staplesxp,4,Wed May 20 23:05:04 2015 UTC,Because NOT having product to sell is good for bidness? We do e tickets every week to increase our on hands for high selling product.. LAME!
Staples,36nkmr,Kal-ElofKrypton,0,Wed May 20 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"Personally I like it. I wanted to do it a year ago before it was even a company wide thought. I personally think the company as a whole has keyed in or will key in (from going negative on hand) a TON just from this top-stock thing. There are plenty of things in tops that were mislabeled or hidden behind another box, or just forgotten about. I HATE top-stock. It just causes too many Inventory nightmares. (Also I have gone to some of the other stores in my district that have the same issues as I described so it isn't just my store)"
Staples,36nkmr,sassundface,2,Thu May 21 04:41:16 2015 UTC,So district are you a DM for?

Staples,36og1p,The_Moot,3,Wed May 20 22:57:35 2015 UTC,I've reset my ink wall before and it took three hours in the middle of the day. I had one tech on so I had him take the customers but if you do 4ft at a time and set the tags first then you can do it smoothly. maybe 15 minutes a 4ft and a few minutes to help someone find their hp ink
Staples,36og1p,1ManTeamOf2,3,Wed May 20 23:50:08 2015 UTC,What amazes me is Staples will send in a 3rd party for a 15 minute reset of hard drive boxes or surface signs but leave us trying to do a 2 day job with no hours or people to do it.

Staples,36og1p,figjam13,1 point,Fri May 22 22:30:46 2015 UTC,1 section at a time takes about 2 days if you are the only person working on it.. I've done it twice in my year and a half its not so bad although that was back when I would get 10 hr shifts so it may take longer
Staples,36og1p,BubbleWrapLampShade,0,Sun May 24 02:31:47 2015 UTC,"Go over to aisle 1 and grab some kneepads - I ended up doing a LOT of kneeling last time and barked up my knees pretty bad.  Are you resetting it tags first or product first? I've done it both ways and found that it was easier to pull the tags (in a 4ft section, like /u/The_Moot said), set it with the product on hooks without tags, then shooting the tags. That way you don't have to worry about having the wrong tag on something and having to adjust the price at the register."
Staples,36og1p,Ajka359,1 point,Thu May 21 00:57:57 2015 UTC,You know you can just put in the planogram number in to sign solutions and it'll print all the new tags in order for you...right?
Staples,36og1p,drdokatz,1 point,Thu May 21 06:43:39 2015 UTC,This always yields missing a large number of the tags for me.

Staples,36oimd,TheSerialVapist,2,Wed May 20 22:07:22 2015 UTC,There is an operations supervisor and a bench manager/supervisor but I've never heard of that. Ask them what their job code is and you can tell from that like mobility and tech sales supervisor is like 000974 or something close to that.
Staples,36oimd,1ManTeamOf2,2,Wed May 20 23:48:38 2015 UTC,I was a former Tech Center (Bench) Supervisor before the promotion to Tech Sales Supervisor. Usually only Rev band T1 or T2 stores get this position & not all T2 have this position

Staples,36lik6,GoodFoBidness,3,Wed May 20 07:17:44 2015 UTC,"I worked for a company with a union, but chose not to be represented by them. I didn't pay dues toward them, but I was still entitled to several benefits that they provided.   Granted, I wasn't at an upper management level there, but Staples has very little balance as to how it treats employees. There were several instances in my store alone that would never fly if any sort of union was in place helping the employees."
Staples,36lik6,KaizokuDan,1 point,Sat May 23 10:23:06 2015 UTC,"This video actually makes me want to join a union at Staples. Any entity that is afraid of a union, is so because they know this workers would benefit with one. They wouldn't have to use scare tactics to fight unions if they had legitimate reasons.   This level of misinformation is on par with Fox News."
Staples,36lik6,thegeekist,-5,Tue Jun 16 07:23:21 2015 UTC,"I have never been a big supporter of unions, they are a business, just as Walmart and Staples are. Instead of inducing customers to open their wallets at the register, a unions goal is to syphon money out of as many paychecks as possible.   Up until a few years ago Staples rarely fired anyone. The only exception was for ethics violations and/or theft.  Now they seem to be making up for that tenfold, but mostly at the manager level, which would not be covered by a union.   I do think there now needs to be a counterbalance to how corp. treats stores, but a union would probably just take money out of everyone's checks and do little for it."
Staples,36lik6,ccap17,17,Wed May 20 10:55:54 2015 UTC,"After working at Staples and a few other non-union businesses and now working at a place where the union syphons money out of my paycheck. I have come to a realization that I will never work for a non-union company again.  The union that represents me is the reason I have payed time off,  health isurance, and other worker's rights.  I don't get crucified for taking time off and there is no such thing as black out dates.  I no longer fear for my job and I make way more money now than I did working for Staples-like places.  Having worked on both sides I feel that this ""anti-union"" sentiment is unwarranted and unjustified."
Staples,36lik6,shiny_red_ball,5,Wed May 20 15:17:35 2015 UTC,"I am glad it worked out for you. What I should have said is that in my experience with unions, I did not see any value over a non union workplace for what I paid in dues. That was awhile ago and things were different.    I do not know if a union would help associates at Staples at this point.  It would be on a store by store basis, and they would likely just close the location if a union vote was passed. If things keep going the way they are, that just may be put to the test. More and more people I know are becoming discontent with how corp. shits all over people in the field while rewarding home office people for doing the minimum."
Staples,36lik6,ccap17,3,Wed May 20 15:42:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't even have to pay dues to be represented by my union (they're legally bound to represent all employees regardless of union membership), but I gladly do so."

Staples,36dzgz,i__i__i__i__i__hah,-2,Wed May 20 03:51:49 2015 UTC,"Nah. Old people just drive in and look. Customers who haven't relegated themselves to living in 1980 or before use the net to shop, first, then go get something. Your website doesn't work so well for that sort of shopping.  A lot of your stock is overpriced, and the selection of computers/electronics is not really that good. There are a lot of things, but most of it is way more expensive than the Targets/KMarts/BestBuy (even CostCo and BJ's are selling office electronics/PCs) you're competing against. You have a lot of items online, but hell, no one wants to bother going to the store to check if the item is actually in-stock there.  If the website did realtime stock checks and then let you buy something and pick it up I think it would help. I think there is a trend towards using the net to find and buy things from brick and mortars that offer quick pickup. MicroCenter is the killer for you guys around here. 18 minutes from order to being able to walk in and take something home.  But this is my two cents."
Staples,36dzgz,Windryy,6,Mon May 18 17:24:52 2015 UTC,"You dont work for staples, right?  There is a buy online, pickup in store option. When you are looking at a item on the website there is a button below ""add to cart"" that says ""pick up"".  So people can still shop online and then get the item that day. The problem is that most of the items people want we dont have in the store and have to order it anyway."
Staples,36dzgz,i__i__i__i__i__hah,2,Mon May 18 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"I fully agree on the stocking issue. Microcenter is killing you guys in northern NJ.  For the website, I just looked and it's changed a lot since my last visit. I stopped checking there long ago. It's an improvement over the what I last used.  I'd give advice, but both of us know that some corporate knucklehead is going to decide what they think everyone wants regardless of anyone's suggestions or reality.  All I can say is keep your head down, smile, and work well until you can find a happier position. Take care."

Alternately, you can just check the skus on the gun (it will show their status) and when you find one with F or C, put the laptop's sku into the register like it's a sale and see if you can apply the coupon. If it works, you have a winner.  Not the most elegant of solutions but without getting into the AS/400 under manager numbers yourself, I can't really think of a better way to do it."

Staples,36d8fu,dr_xadium,7,Mon May 18 13:55:00 2015 UTC,They do that on purpose so you fail your metrics and they don't have to pay out bonuses.
Staples,36d8fu,ccap17,6,Mon May 18 16:00:03 2015 UTC,"Retail sucks in general, but Staples has become very shady towards customers and associates over the last seven years since the recession.   Without a doubt they have rigged CSATS, sales budgets and evals to limit the amount of raises and bonuses."
Staples,36d8fu,DaBidnessman,3,Mon May 18 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"Do you know the reason they only care about 5's? When I was working at Staples, shortly after my position was eliminated I interviewed for a management position with Office Depot (lol) and much of the processes are the same, only Office Depot is much much much much better. The reason that they only care about 5's is because there is a steep drop in the likelihood of a customer returning for a 4 vs a 5 on a CSAT measure. I think it would be better for Staples to tell everyone the reasons for certain metrics rather than ""just because"". CSAT should be disregarded entirely for any and all samples less than 30, because the assumptions for a normally distributed population are not met. Of course, try getting a manger to understand that."
Staples,36d8fu,FormerSCIA,4,Mon May 18 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"At my previous employer they had a more local solution to this. Poor surveys could be dealt with by management in the system directly, unless it was a complaint to corporate directly or got escalated for not being resolved.   We basically made sure to stress that if the visit was great then all 5s was the best way for the company to see that. I had great success with it in my department when getting people into the habit of offering it to client when we nailed everything. People who are very happy usually don't think to look for a survey or a place to give feedback, other than then initial thanks they offer. Those who are upset seek these things out and make life a living hell. Truth is we're not being fair to ourselves as stores without making sure to offer it every time an interaction goes great."
Staples,36d8fu,OfficialHaunt3r,3,Tue May 19 00:03:47 2015 UTC,Thats the kind of situation where you try to force them into a digital receipt. Nobody does the survey with digital receipts.

Staples,36bvkh,TEEHEE_NYC87,6,Mon May 18 03:14:40 2015 UTC,I understand. Just today before we opened my GM called everyone who was working over to have a talk. In the end he told us that it's okay to break policy as long as the customer leaves happy. Like what?
Staples,36bvkh,staplesbitch,6,Mon May 18 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah in the first store I worked the GM would routinely undercut what little authority we had to say no in order to appease a pissy customer. Copy Center would tell customers ""no we can't do the job now we have to process this queue"" and then the GM tells the customer ""Sure we can!"" and clusterfuck begins. Anything for the Customer. But if I as an associate return a tablet I bought the day before with an ESP (it was in great condition I just wasn't happy with it), I get bitched out for it because i'm fucking over store numbers. In other words, I, the EMPLOYEE, was worth LESS in his eyes than a Customer that didn't even want to wait in line. It was soul-crushing."
Staples,36bvkh,dr_xadium,1 point,Mon May 18 05:13:45 2015 UTC,"My managers know I have USB drives and memory cards coming out my butthole from 5 years of purchases, and yet they still try to get me to buy more with a camera, tablet, or computer purchase to boost ASP.  It's to the point now that I just grab the products I want myself, even when not officially working, and all myself to the till. Obviously a cashier rings me out, because it's very fraudulent and against policy to ring yourself out, but it's how it has to be with Ravens around."
Staples,36bvkh,kirashi3,2,Wed May 20 23:58:46 2015 UTC,"Now, I can't even get 50% on clearance, which made it worth.  I have literally no reason to buy anything extra because it's cheaper elsewhere. Screen protectors, cases, etc, ebay for $4.00. You want me to buy it at Staples? Sure. Get it to me for that price.  I absolutely HATE the imposition that because I work here I have to use my wallet to prop up our numbers that tracking associate purchases makes. They can not bring up the email dialog on an associate purchase, why can't they purge it from the numbers?  Seriously. I bought an SP3 - I got a mSD since the Chinese write fraudulent capacities into firmware, but I got 4 screen protectors (matte), a carbon fibre skin, a second power brick, a bluetooth mouse, a 6' mDP-HDMI cable, a pouch, and a miracast dongle for $40. It'd have been $20 just for the 2 screen protectors if I went the Staples route.  Oh, also, protip: If you need a pen case for an SP3, if you hollow out a big permanent marker, it works fantastically. Just put the pen in there and keep the cap."
Staples,36bvkh,kirashi3,6,Thu May 21 03:31:13 2015 UTC,"That's beyond human comprehension.  I recall reading a billion articles online about customer service, and a huge common vein throughout is don't treat your people worse than the customer, because you lose your people and can't serve your customer.  This must be crushing your morale under a boot. Oh well, make like the peasant from Stronghold Crusader:  ""You may have crushed my soul, but you will never have my boots."""

Staples,36bvkh,magicturdd,2,Mon May 18 09:50:41 2015 UTC,"The rationale is that keeping a customer happy is likely to get you a sale today as well as in the future due to their repeat business and word of mouth. That being said, a single customer taking up 6-8 hours of your time is likely costing you sales from other customers who are neglected. I had a customer like this once when I worked at Staples and my GM was getting really aggravated with her and she threatened to never come back again, and he said in a very positive tone ""good! Quite frankly, we don't need your business. Have a good day"". Sadly, he is no longer with the company due to political reasons."

Staples,36a7cu,aforsberg,1 point,Sun May 17 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, what sucks so bad about their marketing?  The tough times I've had were cases like where we offered a free PNY Power Pack with an ink purchase of a certain magnitude, but we never got any of the PNY gizmos in. Ever. Either that or stupid entitled customers insisting that rebates are misleading."
Staples,36a7cu,StaplesArbitor,2,Sun May 17 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"Well between the $1,000,000+ misprinting on our online ads, and the amount of bad tags recently paired with items not ringing right (example: bogo itunes cards, free mice, free whiteboards, etc), there's been a lot of frustration there. Pair that with tags showing the wrong processors, ram, or touchscreen facts, and the printers showing fax functions when they don't have a fax feature, and you end up with angry customers and fed-up workers.   It's a problem that has increased in frequency the past several months."

Staples,36by5i,1_two_3,3,Mon May 18 03:59:53 2015 UTC,"The reasoning, however silly, is that Staples is already compensating you fairly to do a good job, and therefore customers should not be encouraged to give you tips or additional compensation.  Additionally, this could bias you in your work - a little discount there, more attention there, etc. etc. Which they wish to avoid.  That's the explanation I've been given everywhere I've worked regarding tips."

Staples,36by5i,DaBidnessman,2,Wed May 20 19:43:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand the confusion. If an associate accepts a tip from a customer, and the associate takes it the only way anyone would find out about it (thereby getting the associate in any sort of trouble) would be if the associate said something. If he/she accepted the tip, and kept quiet then there would not really be any way of knowing. Yes, accepting tips is technically against policy, but you have to get caught first."

When I was in CPC people brought me and my employees food/coffee all the time and no one cared, and that definitely still happens for my CPC."

The only difference between the two is the copay and the laser eye surgery allowance. If you only go once a year you will end up paying less if you go with option one.

The ACA changed the definition of full-time work from 40 to 30 hours a week. PT hours are limited to 25 weekly in order to account for BTS and Holiday, and other times when associates are expected to go over, so they average out below 30.  Many businesses are doing the same thing, nothing special. I may say, that the full time benefits aren't half bad, though."

I only needed dental and vision, and I got what I needed out if it and I paid about $10 a week. Very few places offer part time benefits, or they classify ""part time"" as working an average of 30 hours a week, so if anything you could stay at Staples one or two days a week simply for the part time benefits and then work a better job (i.e. anything else) for the actual income."

In fact, it would cost more money to repeal the Affordable Care Act than it would to keep it in place, so in the long run it saves money. It's better for the country than the system we had before, and much better than any alternative proposed by any other political party (i.e. nothing).

Staples,3689p8,TEEHEE_NYC87,3,Sun May 17 03:46:03 2015 UTC,Honestly I would lie to them and just say that whatever is on the floor is whatever we have. Who the fuck do they think they are to just go around and clean your store out like that? There is a reseller that comes to our store quite a bit and we never sell him everything of whatever he asks for (usually Kindle Fires). We just tell him we have one or two and he usually takes whatever he can get.  Another thing you can do is just use delay tactics. See if they leave.

Staples,3689p8,FormerSCIA,2,Sun May 17 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"I believe that you can only use 5 rewards coupons at once. So they would only be able to us the maximum amount by combining the highest 5 rewards. As for the trade-ins... they don't get any money for them. Now, they do get discounts on certain printers if they trade in their old printer, but that's merely a marketing ploy to get people to buy new printers/protectin plans/ink/paper with us. We don't really do it to make money on the traded-in printers, so who cares if they're gutted.  The only real thing you could have done is told them that they can only use the highest 5 rewards coupons and refused to sell them any items that you would consider a ""good"" deal or epson printers (the one's they are gutting) if you have enough reason to believe they're resellers.

Anybody telling you you ""have"" to go through a specific entry/exit is just trying to boost conversion unethically."
Staples,3678ex,Doominated,2,Sun May 17 02:00:59 2015 UTC,I don't understand how a company can measure on conversion while simultaneously encouraging employees to offer carry-out assistance.
Staples,3678ex,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Sun May 17 14:55:24 2015 UTC,"Conversion is based on how many times the door opens, not how many people walk through.  This way when a family of people come in it doesn't negatively hit numbers."

Staples,3678ex,TEEHEE_NYC87,2,Sun May 17 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"Same here - we have our main door, which counts as exit and entry, and the door by receiving."
Staples,3678ex,BubbleWrapLampShade,4,Sun May 17 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"This actually came down from corporate and is not just an isolated incidence of one store ( or a few) trying to manipulate conversion.  When they rolled VIBE out and installed the customer counters our LP person claimed associate entering and exiting and going in and out for carry outs and carriages was all accounted for. Whole families coming in to shop for BTS was also accounted for, supposedly.   I understand the importance of what the conversion metric, but changing the entrance and exit path of associates is simply manipulating a report to make the store look better. It is not actually adding sales or margin.   If my manager really wanted to screw the system he would simply put a sign up  ""Entrance door out of order, please enter through the exit"".   Yeah, that one customer stayed 13 hours and bought $18,000 worth of stuff."
Staples,3678ex,ccap17,2,Sun May 17 07:00:19 2015 UTC,"My store is doing this also.  My GM says it's just to count customers for conversion.  I, personally, don't have a problem with it, but I don't think it's right to tell people what to do off the clock."

Staples,3678ex,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Sun May 17 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"This actually isnt really a rule so much as it is a scheme by your managers to manipulate metrics. Depending on your store's volume, it might bite them in the butt, because all of the associates at my old store went in through the exit door (there was the main entrance with a small lobby, a door to the right and the door to the left was the exit). Nobody asked them to do this, it was just the quickest way to get to the time clock. However, on particularly slow days our store would have magical conversion numbers of over 100% and LP did investigate and I think I recall the DM telling everyone to go through the entrance. There are many stores that only have one entrance though, so it couldnt possibly be a rule because that would require associates in those stores to enter/exit through fire exits."

Staples,366voz,BigRichie2897,2,Sat May 16 20:11:03 2015 UTC,That'd be a great thought if most customers didn't use the free ship to store option who place online orders. Most c&p goes for in store checkup anyways.
Staples,366voz,nachoiskerka,3,Sat May 16 22:58:35 2015 UTC,I couldn't tell you why people do this so often. Maybe they think it gets to the store faster because we get trucks all the time? The only viable reason I can think to ship to store is if you won't be home to sign for something valuable.
Staples,366voz,aforsberg,1 point,Sun May 17 01:04:33 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what some people ask me. Always have to tell them that it takes the same amount of time to get to the store as it would to get to their home/office.   As for shipping to the store, I think part of it (in my area anyway) is that sometimes its more secure. I know from experience that sometimes having something delievered to an apartment building isn't all that great if you have ""bad"" neighbors. Once had my package stolen and recently had one delivered to the wrong apartment. While the person who got it did give it to me they had opened the box, for whatever reason."
Staples,366voz,TEEHEE_NYC87,0,Sun May 17 02:43:38 2015 UTC,Actually its because if a store has it instock they can technically pick it up. Plus its convenient if they have a c&p order.

It really doesn't help very much. They real key is just not call it ""ordering online,"" as that scares customers off. Refer to it as ""seeing if they have it at the warehouse,"" and tell them they can likely get it as early as tomorrow, either directly to them or the store. And ultimately, no Daily Deals are going to save your kiosk #s if your entire team isn't on board. It's not about the daily deals at all. It's about finding what your customer needs (which is almost certainly nothing from that page). So just don't let customers leave empty handed without seeing if you can order something for them."

Staples,3655s9,aforsberg,7,Sat May 16 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"What one of my managers taught us is to return each item on a separate transaction.  Can use the same cash card for as long as it will go through, but the system will stop it pretty quick.  It will take more time, having to input the ID multiple times, but is worth it."
Staples,3655s9,elentirion,5,Sat May 16 07:26:59 2015 UTC,This is what we did at my old store. It usually worked pretty well. Once I actually got a call from a neighboring store that some customer had tried to do a non receipted return but the pos denied it. Turned out to be the guy who had just left my store trying to do the same thing at the staples down the road.
Staples,3655s9,joebacca121,5,Sat May 16 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the part of our return policy which states ""staples reserves the right to refuse any return.""  When a ""customer"" comes on with the above-mentioned items, I will go through the EJ and AS400 with them waiting and finally say ""hmm, looks like we haven't sold these items in the last x weeks/months. Unfortunately I'll need a receipt to finish this return."" Usually that's enough for them to shuffle their stuff together walk out the door.   On a rare occasion when they don't seem to be blatant tweakers, I will give the benefit of the doubt and do a non-receipted return, but their story has to add up. They can't've bought the item in a town which I know has no Staples, for example."
Staples,3655s9,Wannabanana17,3,Sat May 16 14:01:57 2015 UTC,"Seeing how we offer print and digital receipts now, these is no reason why they shouldn't have a receipt. We will usually refuse the return if we see planners, tablet cases, windows 8 software, or prismacolor stuff in it.  They should make it no receipt, no return and maybe have a restocking fee since a lot of the big stores around us charge it(and because we have to deal with crap that has no or damaged packaging).   I've seen some managers go through 4 different MOP for someone trying to return a pack of paperclips because they didn't want a corporate complaint about returns. :("
Staples,3655s9,Yellow-Curry,2,Sat May 16 06:35:24 2015 UTC,"Same here. We've had a rash of some fairly sketchy returns. A lot of times its just some random crap that just so happens to add up to the cost of Beats headphones. We've had landline phones flying off the shelves... that is thieves stealing them then having someone else come into the store and do non-receipt returns on them. Its tough to say what we could really do.  One thing my managers do sometimes is just use delay tactics. Some of these people just get impatient with the wait and end up leaving. But even then some just don't mind sticking around and getting their cash cards or shiny new item.   One thing I personally like to do is tell the customer that I could find the purchase with their rewards card. If I can't I just deny them, but of course that doesn't work if they ask for a manager.   In the end I think might just be best to get rid of the no receipt return. Yes it hurts the customers that legitimately lose their receipts, but in the end you've just got to put a stop to this sort of thing.  Then again I've also seen some other shady practices WITH receipt returns. One thing that seems to be ""gaining popularity"" is buying an item in a state with lower tax and returning it in a state with higher tax. If I'm not mistaken it actually adjusts the return to the tax of the state its being returned to. Which means they get more back. Anyway just some of my late night ramblings."
Staples,3655s9,TEEHEE_NYC87,1 point,Sat May 16 06:37:08 2015 UTC,"You in the States offer digital receipts. If they oblige, they can't lose them. Furthermore, don't lose receipts.  I always put my receipts in a folder until the return period is up (generally longer, depending on my faith in the manufacturer). Never lost one yet.   Our customers are badly trained. We need to train them to be good, responsible customers again. The people who bring a cartridge with them. The people who say please and thank you. The ones that keep their receipts. The ones who don't contradict us on stock when we clearly know better."

Unless you are personally going to go tote thru tote looking for an item the customer asked for and you said it be there never say that. What if you weren't there and they asked for it because you said it be on the truck now you Co worker is getting yelled at for your mistake and now you look like an ass to your team and the customer. 2nd why not just kiosk it. They would be guaranteed to get it either next day or beginning of next week depending on the time and day and that way no need to wait for a truck cause it seems on this subreddit crews are generally slow to kill a truck. And finally online is still iffy with bopis. It's getting better but I'll get a handful of bopis orders I really don't have.
Staples,364ryn,staplestwerkteam,0,Sat May 16 03:33:24 2015 UTC,the point is that i know we get them every week and i will go looking through the ink totes for a specific cartridge i was just wondering why it takes so long for inventory to update.

That's the last thing I want to hear my people say. If you tell them we will get it on truck and we don't, we have to clean up your mess.  As for why it takes so long to update, maybe your managers/IS aren't keying in the truck. Maybe, like everything else with Staples, it's going to take a while even after being keyed in. There are just too many variables to accurately tell you what is causing the lag.  TL;DR - Stop telling customers you will get stuff on truck; and don't tell customers that they can do something that you personally do not have the control over."
Staples,364ryn,joebacca121,2,Sat May 16 04:23:52 2015 UTC,"We typically say we might get it on the next truck, but we don't know what the wearhouse send us until we put everything away and that takes a day or two. We tell them they can check back a day or two after the truck comes in to see if it came in, but we never outright promise something will be on the next truck because we simply don't know."
Staples,364ryn,swaggitystaples67,2,Sat May 16 04:32:11 2015 UTC,Even if you know youre gunna get something i still wouldnt promise that youll be getting it anyway.

Staples,35z8ya,STAPLES_LOSS_PREVENT,2,Thu May 14 22:40:41 2015 UTC,Opposite of my luck today haha. I do have a question regarding your process for mid-stocking ink. Do you guys box all ink that can't go out on the wall? Is it only certain SKUs that sell the quickest? I am very open to ideas as I am in a store that is understaffed and any insight that would help me streamline our ink process would be amazing.

There is an in-store Diag and Repair redemption hiding somewhere if you need to use it. I can't recall the folder it's in.

Staples,35ylkh,eternistarr,1 point,Thu May 14 17:49:15 2015 UTC,There is no gray area you do it every time if it needs it or not. If its open then its no longer new and diag and repair is required. As far as older customers as long as ts hasn't lappsed there is a SKU in oms for a year upgrade that doesn't require the diag and repair
Staples,35wfr0,FormerSCIA,4,Thu May 14 02:03:27 2015 UTC,"That first tip about focus stood out to me. We're an office supply store. We also sell scrubs, medical supplies, party supplies, hallmark cards, way too much food that expires before it can be relevant, Leapfrog (?!), and from the looks of the last couple trucks BOARD GAMES AND ACTION FIGURES. I also remember the Health and Wellness set which was fucking nonsense as well.  Staples is ignoring the VERY FIRST tip of this video that they posted. They instead opt to just kind of see what sticks. I could bring up the other points as well, but it's late and I have Staples to at tomorrow."
Staples,35wfr0,dark_not_evil,1 point,Thu May 14 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"I only got to tips one and two before I had to comment. Tip one is exactly this. There's nothing being kept simple about carrying all these different ranges of products that only last in the stores for a couple of months before they get clearanced out and we move onto the next thing. And then there's tip two, stay focused. This company never stays focused on anything. It's always a different thing each month. I remember at the beginning of the year the whole ""shoot a pull list of only promo items twice a day and email the results to your DM"" was a big thing and now it's non-existent."

Bonus idea: In the Staples survey, 45 percent of employees would use the breakroom more if it had furniture to encourage relaxation. At Drive Local, employees enjoy massaging chairs to reduce stress and fuel creativity during quick breaks, or while working on laptop or tablet.  Bonus idea: A big-screen serves multiple functions: a meeting display for work and a sports-airing TV during special events or off-hours.

Our break room has no kitchen area per-se though, just a microwave, refrigerator, and tons of lockers & a computer.

Staples,35y3ru,elentirion,1 point,Thu May 14 22:09:23 2015 UTC,"Squaretrade, being the guarantor, has the ability to customize coverage per retailer to a degree.  Take a look at the terms and conditions for the Amazon plans, run a comparison between the two.  They'll be different than the ones Staples offers, so asking here probably won't get you the answers you're looking for."
Staples,35y3ru,FormerSCIA,1 point,Thu May 14 14:20:47 2015 UTC,"I think what he is saying is that the ST for $800 tier and $1100 tier are priced the same. Think the $0-99 printer ST tier and the $100-199 tier being priced the same. I would imagine that the higher tier plan would provide a higher dollar amount of coverage. However, I am unsure if you would have a claims issue for having an incorrect plan for your product. Square Trade would be the only one to answer this as their offerings and terms and conditions do vary from retailer to retailer."

Staples,35tphx,Nottheguyouthink,5,Wed May 13 12:53:09 2015 UTC,"I have worked as easy tech for 2 1/2 years and left at the beginning of this year. I think it the attitude of the store really depends on management. We changed GMs while I was there. Both were great guys but the second was more driven and yet more chill. So even though he would ask more of us he would also be super chill and hang out at the front of the store with us when we're slow. Corporate or HO or whatever name people that are not in store every day seem to be disconnected from what the customer wants and what the employees want. Thus all the rants from our end and complaints from customers. Staples could be cool but I feel like they keep inventing new ways to suck and it's all coming from corporate.  To answer your question, management almost always came down on the side of the employee and I was never reprimanded in front of the customer for doing something dumb."
Staples,35tphx,M4R731,5,Wed May 13 13:53:44 2015 UTC,"All of my coworkers were awesome for the first 1.5 years I was there. Most people were longtime veteran employees. Everything went smoothly and our store did well. We had at least 1 person working every department at all times.  Right around the time they tried pushing that VIBE crap, turnover skyrocketed. Within 3 months, only ~4 people remained of our ""original"" team. Most of the vets quit. Hours were slashed, quotas were jacked to impossible numbers. We were lucky to have 3 people working during the busiest hours. We went through like a dozen and a half people within a few months because it was unbearable to work in that environment. All for minimum wage.  So to answer your question... My store was awesome and I enjoyed working there. Then corporate shit themselves and made it an unnecessary stressful work environment that no one want to deal with."
Staples,35tphx,magic_is_might,3,Wed May 13 18:03:14 2015 UTC,"I feel almost the same after almost 5 years here. Back when new hires got duo tangs with training documents, EPK training to be completed within X hours on the job, and when we had enough staff available to actually make every sale without customers walking out... Those were the days.  Understandable that retail has changed drastically over this time, shifting to online distribution and more show rooming, with a lot more stress on the brick and mortar stores to hold their own. I think that customer service and labor/custom services are really the way to make money these days, but that's next to impossible when there's no one on the floor to assist customers, and when my Technician is literally the ONLY one qualified to even book in a computer properly. (Everyone can do it, but it seems people always forget an email, password, date of birth, or something else...)"

Staples,35tphx,haze_gray,3,Wed May 13 13:22:20 2015 UTC,"Customers treated me like shit in the CPC for the year and a half I worked there. When I would do all the design work and shit my supervisor would leave for me, they would get all the accolades on how awesome of a job THEY did. If something was ever fucked up, they said I was incompetent, even when I didn't do the order.   The pay wasn't worth the harassment, but I couldn't find a job that fit my schedule for a year and a half. I worked for the government but my position was axed. I was making $18/hr, full time + overtime, + benefits. They asked if I wanted to apply for another department, but I ended up going back to school instead. At Staples I made $9.10/hr, only got the annual raise, 30 hours a week for the first month I was there, then cut down to 24, and they had me cover ET and OS as well, since we had people quit or no call no show all the time.   It didn't help that we went through 3 GMs during that time, and didn't even have a GM for 5 months. The other managers would just sit in the office or break room checking Facebook, expecting the skeleton crew to make more happen.  To all new hires"
Staples,35tphx,Flexinstaph,2,Thu May 14 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"I had a coworker who was in the store for 5 years, and she has had 12 GM's. I was there for two years and averaged a new GM ever 5-6 months.

It's not really the people, because I guarantee most people here have met some really cool people working at Staples, it's the culture the company encourages. Lying, cheating and backstabbing take precedence over integrity, intelligence and hard work and there is a massive disconnect between corporate and retail stores, and you can see this through idiotic initiatives or programs like VIBE."
Staples,35tphx,DaBidnessman,2,Mon May 18 08:22:26 2015 UTC,"put it this way......i worked at staples for 7 years. it started out as just a job. when i first started, we had the best managers everyone was friends and we were always together. yet the store was always spotless and ran perfect the sales numbers were good. i had the time of my life there. i started in the copy center. then moved to easytech (BM..lol). eventually i became expert to mobile consultant and then to team sup. i started to look at staples as a career path. the first time they changed managers, we clashed on everything, then as she was leaving we stopped clashing and she promoted me to team sup (somehow i was able to squeeze 15/hr out of them..lol). the most recent gm i worked with drove me to quit opened my eyes to what staples is becoming. He was there to clean house. After being demoted because ""he wasnt impressed"" was the final straw. i started looking for new jobs avidly like ive never done before. now im employed elsewhere as an analyst for networks. staples was a great resume builder and i loved the people i worked with. but over time it has become a horrible place for a career. i was stripped of full time and benefits and was forced to work part time until i found better. sorry for rambling but staples is a great stepping stone dont get me wrong"
Staples,35tphx,aldog3788,3,Fri May 22 12:46:22 2015 UTC,"In ((my opinion)), Staples became so much worse: Now we have extremely low ethics, unrealistic and unreasonable expectations of the staff. Really a bad culture and low moral. the most things I hate about Staples: 1-Sales expectation: misleading customers into buying high-margin over-priced addons, trying to sell cell phones to customers who are shopping for pens and ink 2-they don't appreciate the staff and hard working people 3-promoting the wrong people 4-mistreating people  5-cutting the staff / hours and overworking employees (in the name of multitasking) 6-putting too much pressure and stress on the employees, a few employees and managers I know are seeing Cardiologists, Gastroenterologists or psychiatrists and can't sleep well at night over work stress and can't have quality time with family"

But we're fortunate to have both our DM, LP, several GMs, Account Managers, etc all come up through the ranks.

As a company we've gone from a more friendly vending machine type store. ""you want this hard drive here? ok here you go. have a nice day"" to more aggressively sales driven ""you want this hard drive here, i would recommend you get the one with double the storage space. Also can I get you both a regular ECP and a 2 year Data ECP for only 9.00$ and 39.99$?"" , and that expectation that my staff go for broke and push these every time, I have definitely seen a drop in morale, for sure.   I get why we do it- to stay competitive in the marketplace, but in my opinion, without an increase in monetary and hours-allotment incentive to compensate for the constant pressure and go-for-broke attitude, doesn't make much sense.

Staples,35se72,peznez,7,Wed May 13 02:48:58 2015 UTC,"They need to keep hours down, presumably for obamacare, and they do this by cutting hours and hiring tons of people. Mostly high school kids and drug adicts since they are told to hire everyone who applies basically. My store just lost me because I worked one day a week there to help pay the bills, and they cant guarantee me even one day. They replaced me with at least one high school kid and a few other people who dont seem to know technology. At least the HS kid knows tech, though he may know just enough to get him in trouble.) He reminds me of when I was new. He thinks it's a real tech job still! It won't take long. After he takes the MATRIX training I'm sure he'll realize he's overqualified to be a glorified teamviewer-connect-button-presser."
Staples,35se72,CaptainNeedleMouse,3,Wed May 13 04:02:26 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly surprised that you were even hitting 26 hours, as Staples policy states that a part time associate can only work up to 25 hours per week. My guess would be that your GM got bitched at by your RVP or DM because they were allowing associates to surpass the 25 hour limit, so your management team hired associates to take some of those hours. There are weeks that I'm not even scheduled 17 hours, so I know how you feel."
Staples,35se72,EJWygal1989,2,Wed May 13 02:59:07 2015 UTC,"GMs are starting to cut people below 25 hours and then hire more people so they have backup in-case people call off or go on vacation.

Staples,35sddo,easytech109,4,Wed May 13 02:48:10 2015 UTC,Depends on the GM and what they score on the pre-hire assessment. Our store won't even give someone a second glance if they score below a green.

Just because a hole had product in it in the morning, doesn't mean its not going to be empty by the evening.  It really takes the whole team working together to get a good score. no directed pulls done before closing means the IS will walk into a bunch of holes in the morning.

ALL skus must be researched and have notation on it. This is the ZB, one of the main things an IS does."
Staples,35qjqw,shadowstewie,1 point,Wed May 13 08:04:00 2015 UTC,Since the local stores were threatened if the score goes over a .8 and told not to bother shooting it.... .12 is the lowest in our store (not legit).  Highest before that was 3.9 and the IA was climbing the walls. Staples would rather see good numbers on paper than accurates ones now apparently.

I don't even think we can sell a password reset service... Windows 8.1 can be reset using a system recovery disk. There are workarounds using a boot disk and replacing the accessibility icon with a command prompt. At startup when you click on the accessibility it brings up a root command prompt that you can net user... This doesn't work well with 8.1 that has a live account. (password is linked to live and isn't ""local"") Works really well with 7 and less... ;} Scary well actually... These kind of hacks are why encrypted partitions were invented."
Staples,35lfa9,LinuxVersion,5,Mon May 11 15:01:17 2015 UTC,"I believe you can still open up a command prompt when booting into the easytech flash drive PE (generally I use Shift+F10 on a windows 7 or 8 install DVD / USB to get to a command prompt). Then from the command prompt type:  cd c:\Windows\  move System32\Utilman.exe System32\Utilman.exe.old  xcopy System32\cmd.exe System32\Utilman.exe   (the reason I dont cd to system32 is because you will get an invalid subsystem error on 64 bit machines because the PE is 32 bits and the xcopy.exe in the current folder is always preferred to the one in the path)  I'm generally doing a diag & repair when I reset passwords so I would let the matrix take care of it from the PE. Once you boot back into normal mode and are at the login screen, press the windows key + U to execute the accessibility utility manager (utilman.exe) which is now a command prompt. In the command prompt type:   net user   (this will show a list of users, since the spelling can sometimes be different from the name displayed at the login screen) Then:  net user <username> *   At this point it will ask for a password and to retype the password, just press enter a couple times to get back to the prompt an the password will be cleared.  You can also unlock the administrator account by typing:  net user administrator /active:yes   then set the password  net user administrator *   The reason you would want to do this is if the user gets the ""user profile cannot be loaded / is corrupt / user profile service cannot be started"" when they try to login and its the only user account on the computer OR if the only user account is a Microsoft account because you cant change those passwords with any tool locally (you need to account password reset from live.com). This way you can activate the administrator account and perform a system restore from there to roll back the account corruption, when you are done:  net user administrator /active:no   *A word of warning* In windows 8+ choosing ""shut down"" by default puts the computer into a type of hibernation to reduce boot up times, you must choose restart to avoid this before moving files around or else when the system resumes you can get corrupted files, this also applies to xp, vista, 7 systems that are hibernated as well!  When you are finished you can delete utilman.exe in ssytem32 and rename the Utilman.exe.old back to utilman.exe, or sonce you may be running SFC /scannnow from a command prompt anyway, you can choose to let that detect the 'corrupted' Utilman and replace it with the SxS copy.  Im working on an unofficial extender for the easytech toolbox which will document this functionality and provide extra tools in the PE (like a desktop with a taskbar)."

This is a unique tool though and will not work on other computers.   There are ways you can reset the password on older operating systems by using a System repair disk which you should have in the store (Windows 8 does not require one, but may be nice to have media to install Windows 8 around). Learn about that here and here  If for whatever reason you don't have system recovery disks in store you can download them and burn them yourself for free."

Lady, seriously, easy is subjective. Unless that's your target market, product is not manufactured for fucking idiots, ok? It's like a processor die - there's a finite level to which you can make something easy, and unfortunately if you're too stupid and fall below that threshold, well, sorry. They tried. I propose we call this the ""Staples constant"" as the easiest possible use a product can be designed for and still work.  One thing I really hate is being blamed because people are too stupid. Like this right here is classic.  I don't know about Staples US, but Staples Canada has green recycle bins at the front of every store for leaving toner, batteries, etc. Anyhow, this one lady came in asking if we still had the toner her husband had recycled, as he took out the whole assembly (drum+tn) and dropped it off. We were kind enough to find it and give it to her, and you know what she says as she's leaving?  ""Why wouldn't you stop someone from doing this?""  BECAUSE IT'S ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE STORE FROM TECH AND IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE YOU DON'T SEND A COMPLETE FUCKING RETARD TO DROP IT OFF?  Naturally, once it filters through the internal monologue, it comes out as ""Oh, well, we're often busy and since it's drop-off, we don't generally catch people as they do it.""  My manager was there too, and we just gave one another a look, like, ""Is she actually fucking serious? She's actually trying to blame us for this?""

Staples,35icnb,kirashi3,2,Mon May 11 20:58:56 2015 UTC,"Fellow Canadian here, and I feel for you, and all people in service jobs. If our service was not up to par, or we f'd up, then by all means, let me hear about it.  Just because you bought the laptop here does not mean we are responsible for the manufacturers warranties, let alone looking up your proof of purchase. I really don't mean to sound like a banshee, but there's a reason we recommend you register your warranty online, assuming you listen to our recommendation to get the warranty in the first place.  not here to argue the rights and wrongs of warranties; just here to note that you take equal chances not buying the extra coverage as you do buying it."
Staples,35icnb,deepsixz,3,Mon May 11 21:38:22 2015 UTC,"Too many oldies as I call them.  The days are gone where mom&pop shops took care of you. You sold that for lower prices and megacorporations. As it stands, we don't make the product. We test a few for quality, and then buy up a few thousand to be distributed to the stores - this is the reason we sell warranties as an extra service, because we are a vendor.  Selling something does not mean you endorse it as 100% functional 100% of the time. Go to the manufacturer, because in theory, at least, they do.  People don't like me for it, but I talk over customers if I have to if they say no to the warranty to make it abidingly clear what that means.  Pisses me off though: ""We cover the unit during our 14 day return policy for non-accidental damage, however, without the easycare, after this 14 day period you will have to take it to the manufacturer for warranty support, it will not be serviced for free through Staples as the manufacturer provides the warranty, and only under very explicit terms.""  ""Well, what if it failed after 15 days?""  Seriously? Morally, I'm sure we'd make an exception and take it back.... ""Sir, while I'm sure we'd deal with it within reasonable expectations, all I can legally guarantee you is 14 days. Anything else is at the discretion of management.""  Though, I do take issue with the last part of what you said - Warranties can be worthwhile for the right people, certainly, but Staples is not in the warranty game because it's 50/50. You're far less likely to have issues with the laptop during term than you are to need the warranty.  I tell people what they need to know, and leave it to their discretion. I'm abidingly careful, so I don't buy them. That said, many people certainly would do well to get it. It's their choice, and all I can offer if it breaks (technically I can't) is a ""I told you so, it was a possibility."" [Now fuck off to the Manufacturer with your premium $329.00 laptop]"
Staples,35icnb,TEEHEE_NYC87,1 point,Tue May 12 00:44:51 2015 UTC,"Very, very well said. I like your thought process and professional way of stating that a store resells the product and the manufacture is fully responsible for it after the return policy.  I might adapt it by adding something like ""we have an 14 day period in which we will gladly take back a product deemed to be experiencing a manufactures defect. We do this both for your convenience and to help keep prices low for customers not unlike yourself.""  That way at least it appears more positive to the customer that we're on their side, providing a convenient option for them. At least, it sounds that way.  And LOL to those people who come in claiming their cheap technology product is shitty - I try to educate to each and every customer that there's a reason manufacturers make uber inexpensive stuff alongside their highly priced machines. Am I going to force you to buy something more than you need? No. I have morals and I'm not on commission. I'm here to get you the best product your money can afford, ensuring its setup correctly for your needs, and to be here if [read: when] it breaks down. If I had my way, PC manufacturers would go the way of Apple and start with the base model $600 F150 pickup truck laptop as their point of entry. No used Dodge Neons sold here. Move along."

We had a store in our district that was consistently top-notch - great numbers across the board - every period.  One time, when our DM was visiting I said, ""I've been doing this like ten years. I should call #### and find out what they're doing to be so consistently good. Surely these guys can teach us something.""   He replied, ""Don't. It's not something you'd ever do, or even want to do.""

Staples,35if25,Bill_Money,1 point,Mon May 11 00:15:26 2015 UTC,My understanding was best Buy was a bit more open to this because they handled their margins differently-- if you got the attachments to make their margin up they didn't give a crap on the loss leading piece of electronics and discounted it by the price of the plan. But you had to get the accessories.
Staples,35if25,dr_xadium,2,Mon May 11 16:27:02 2015 UTC,"While yes you need to get accessories, services, or PSP (warranty) in-boarding is still heavily frowned upon. It is illegal in most states which could result in termination. A price discrepancy report does exist for Best Buy as well."
Staples,35if25,Bill_Money,1 point,Mon May 11 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"I might be able to speak a little more to this. The process of in boarding GSPP (ESP) was against SOP. Now as in any company there were people who did it. If you had a PC sup or CSM that was fine with in boarding the GSPP/tech support, they required you to get accessories, mobile, ect. Best Buy definitely had more options with how they handled the sales and fulfillment aspects of ESP. Most fulfillment is done in house and nearly all repairs are done at Geek Squad facilities.   tl;dr Not an approved tactic, but if a CSM (SSM) could see an overall profit for the P&L then they could allow it."

However if you need a price match, you will be unable to do it as price matching out of the store needs to happen via Phone ordering but your discount does not work via phone. So if you need a price match you need to do it via the kiosk and pay in store."

For some reason they didn't consider the impact that might have on a stores return rate and sales goals until later.  Now the instruction is to submit it via some form on the Hub, where your credit card used to order it has to match the employees name (no discounts for the majority of employees as they are underage to even have a credit card) or to phone in the order and hope they get it right on the invoice."

You can do an in-store order and pay at the register/apply your discount though, which is just as good really."
Staples,35ia1e,Weareoutofstock,1 point,Mon May 11 05:05:57 2015 UTC,Ahh another UK stapler. Order the chair in store via Endless Aisle. I believe you'll have to lower the price manually on the order screen on JDA to include the discount. So if it is £100 you'll have to manually reduce the price to either £70 or £90(depending on whether it is Staples brand). If you order it on JDA for £100 then try to use discount at the till I don't think it will ship the order.

Staples,35fljk,Kal-ElofKrypton,4,Sun May 10 23:16:28 2015 UTC,A rough rule of thumb for SquareTrade is they will just reimburse anything under $300. Its just not worth the repair costs and return shipping for 99% of electronics under that price. They'd lose more money than they would just sending you a Visa card.  Sometimes if the item is large enough they won't even bother having you ship it to them.  I had no problem pushing SquareTrade because I use it and believe in it for most stuff.
Staples,35fljk,StapleApe,2,Sun May 10 02:58:45 2015 UTC,Squaretrade is a great company.  They will bend over backward to help you and they hope this motivates  you to purchase square trade on everything you buy.

Staples,35em32,karonna,5,Tue May 12 23:05:24 2015 UTC,I think it's fucked up the GM is graded on ASAT. They need to make a separate one for GMs and Corporate. But we all know they really don't give a shit about what we think. The egos are huge with the higher-ups.
Staples,35em32,rons_moustache,5,Sat May 9 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"The problem with the ASAT survey is that the GM is held accountable for low scores. I love my GM, as does everyone else in the store, so we don't want to get him in trouble with low scored, but at the same time many of us don't like where the company is going and this is our only opportunity to say something that corporate might see. It sucks because nothing will change if we all always give fives because then we seem ok with everything, but we obviously don't want our GM to be fired or moved and then we get a complete a-hole to replace him. It's a catch 22 and it's exactly how corporate designed it."
Staples,35em32,joebacca121,8,Sat May 9 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"I gave 5s, because I love my GM and staples doesn't give a fuck about my opinion, but they WILL ride my GM hard if they get a bad ASAT."
Staples,35em32,katyrzana,3,Sat May 9 17:17:56 2015 UTC,This is truth.
Staples,35em32,Kal-ElofKrypton,2,Sat May 9 18:42:48 2015 UTC,"For the ""does your immediate manager care about you and your wellbeing?"" I gave a 5. But does Staples help me reach career goals? Fuck no. Do I still want to work there in a year if I have my way? Probs not no. Is it a good work environment? Gave it a 4 because most of the time yes. Because during the early summer time when they refuse to turn on the AC is brutal."

It was not there this year.  I never saw what the results were but judging by what people in my store said, everyone tanked corp.  The trouble with ASAT (and CSAT) is that corp can skew the data anyway they want before it is relayed back to the stores."
Staples,35em32,ccap17,1 point,Sat May 9 18:54:47 2015 UTC,It's easier to give all 5's just to not have to get yelled at by the GM for my store because they really don't allow us to have a voice or support coworkers. Morale for associates are less when he is around.

Staples,35e9sl,jammnpenguin,1 point,Sat May 9 14:38:39 2015 UTC,Let them complain. I've never once heard of anything negative happening from one of those complaints.
Staples,35e9sl,aforsberg,1 point,Sun May 10 19:17:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe not directly to you. But once a complaint comes in from Office of the President an email goes out to the DM & GM to be made aware of the issue and in worse cases, contact the customer to rectify the problem. If it's consistent, there can be write ups depending on the situation and person(s) involved.   But on a realistic level, how often to people want us to install a screen protector? Almost no one buys them, at least in my store. Anytime the shelf is empty, it's shrink."
Staples,35e9sl,jammnpenguin,3,Mon May 11 01:35:24 2015 UTC,"I just tell them that i don't mind doing it but I can't get my own screen protectors on without bubbles and dust, and that if they really want me to do it I will.   It's worked for me so far. I think it's better doing it this way, since they'll be much happier making the decision on their own rather than being told no."
Staples,35e9sl,ThrowItWayFarAwayy,2,Sat May 9 21:35:21 2015 UTC,"Same here - I often show them my own phone's screen protector so they can see what I mean. If they can live with my quality, then I'll do it. At least they know that, yes, it's kinda tricky to do and, yes, you can still use your device even if the screen protector has flaws."
Staples,35e9sl,BubbleWrapLampShade,2,Sun May 10 03:00:54 2015 UTC,"We do it all the time. If there's no one available who can do it we tell the customer if they want their screen protector not to look horrible they can come back another day.

I had to move about 6 rows of light plastic storage boxes from one end of the store to the other's top stock and it was probably the most i've sweat in a while. It varies by store because my other store was quite cool, this one is muggy as hell.  Even so, beats some other jobs i've had working outside in the summer heat."

Alternatively, buy just ONE of the Apple OEM Lightning to MicroUSB adapters (they're hardshell and tiny, so I trust the structural integrity) and then use just one of the many MicroUSB cables y'all undoubtedly have.  My philosophy is this: I spent $950 on my iPhone 6s and another $100 on AppleCare+.

Customer called me up on the phone, yelled at me for five minutes for selling him a lemon (I wasn't even the salesman; my shift had just started). Despite my efforts, he was very vague about what was wrong with the machine (""IT JUST WON'T WORK!!!""). I told him to come in and we'd exchange it for him, or refund if that's what he really wanted.  He came into my tech counter and proceeded to yell at me for another couple minutes as I opened the Toshiba box to verify the laptop was still in saleable condition. I ask him if he could tell me what was wrong with the machine. He practically grabs the laptop out of my hand, and starts trying to yank/rip it open by the hinge-end. After I have a minor heart attack (it was the i7 model that he was destroying in front of my eyes), I calmly pick up the laptop, flip it 180 degrees so the non-hinge side is facing him, open it up with one finger, and tap the power button as lightly as possible.  The ""I'm-such-a-f**king-moron"" look on his face was priceless. To his credit, he was apologetic after that, instead of doubling down on the assholery like I'd imagine some might do."

If corp is going to punish over complaints because of that policy, then they need to make it clear that's OK to do.  That said, I'd rather quit than offer phone support.

Staples,357izl,staplesthrowaway666,8,Fri May 8 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"If Staples makes you work continuously (because we all KNOW we ALWAYS get our breaks, miright?) in temperatures over 85 degrees, here's a how-to guide for what you should do.  (1) Formally complain to your manager, making sure to use the words ""this could cause death or serious harm to my health."" if needed, send a certified letter to Framingham outlining the conditions, and how they are dangerous to associate life and health.   (2) if you're a tech associate and have access to a non-client owned computer or device behind the bench (sometimes I bring my OTG-compatible tablet with me to work to demo Windows 10 for curious customers, for example), plug an Extech RHT10 in and log away.  (3) Go to www.osha.gov. Submit proof that your certified letter was received by corporate. Notate your manager's response to your complaint. Submit data from the Extech detailing the logged heat and humidity levels in the workplace. The burden of proof on the employee is really high for heat issues, but with this much documentation, at least Framingham may have to deal with a couple minor headaches.  And if OSHA doesn't run with it, you can always go to your local media outlets."
Staples,357izl,badfordabidness,2,Thu May 7 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"You make it seem like the GMs have control over this.  Novar controls our setpoints. (74.5 degrees in my store) and you sweat your balls off. You can complain, Novar will call, lower setpoints, then corporate sees it, changes it back, and you complain again. Over and over."
Staples,357izl,Railman3,0,Fri May 8 01:59:19 2015 UTC,"I know GMs don't have control over it. I have an awesome GM who would never treat his associates inhumanely if it were up to him. From your many posts on this sub, I can tell you are a similarly great GM. That said, if you file an OSHA complaint, they'll probably want to see that you said something to a more immediate manager or supervisor before going to Framingham with the issue. ALSO sending a Certified Letter to Framingham gives a complainant the added benefit of (1) making it impossible for Framingham to hide behind plausible deniability AND (2) making it much harder to use that plausible deniability to scapegoat a GM who probably did nothing wrong. In other words, corporate can't be like ""This is an isolated incident caused by a rogue GM that we were unaware of."" if OSHA comes calling or the media picks up the story.  OSHA is a long shot, but remember that this administration hasn't been making particularly sterling comments about Staples as of late. If they hear tell that a company that the President has already lambasted for not providing health care to its associates is then proceeding to force those health care-less associates to work under unsafe, inhumanely conditions... Well, that'd be an awful tempting narrative to adopt."

It asked if something was on display, she said no, but it's been on display for months. They also said we had no fact tags out on the laptops, though you can see them in the photos they took. It's gonna make us look bad when we actually aren't because people don't know what they're looking at."
Staples,353fzf,joebacca121,5,Wed May 6 23:39:28 2015 UTC,We had one. The app always asks you to take a picture of something.  In this case it was the BOPIS sign at the front of the store or the tech counter.  One of the questions was if there was a manager in a gray button up shirt available at the front of the store. She answered no.  Our SSM was LITERALLY IN THE FUCKING PICTURE SHE TOOK STANDING AT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE COUNTER!
Staples,353fzf,StapleApe,7,Thu May 7 03:23:34 2015 UTC,"This is not going to go well at all. All the higher ups will see is the answers the customers gave and they won't see the pictures that prove the answer was wrong and will think we are failing at our jobs and rather than increase payroll so we can have staff to take care of this stuff (and take care of more than one customer at once) they will force GMs to be on daily conference calls to discuss how this will be changed and we will have to journal everything and email the DM hourly with info on how things are going. All this will do is worsen the problem because rather than actually providing customer service or tasking, managers will be off the floor talking on the phone about why nobody is on the floor to help customers. Sometimes I really hate the way this company is run (as opposed to the mild hatred I always have for the way the company is run)."

Staples,353fzf,OldOnliner,6,Thu May 7 01:28:38 2015 UTC,"This is all going to be moot once every item in retail stores is RFID tagged and employees don't exist. Walk into store -> pick up item -> walk out of store -> automatically charged on card. Don't know something? Walk up to computer screen with a picture of an associate, ask it a question. Basically, it's Google for dumbasses.  It's fucking hilarious how short sighted corporate fat-cats are. Instead of teaching everybody how to run the store, they throw everybody into the mix without any proper training and then piss on them when they fuck up.

He looked it up online and got it price matched down to $4.99. See? http://www.staples.com/product_837524  Discrepancies abound, and price matches out the wazoo."
Staples,350zf3,aforsberg,2,Wed May 6 17:32:53 2015 UTC,"Staples brand cables are always marked up in stores. All of them. Much cheaper on .com. I imagine the thought process is if you need one enough to not want to wait for it, you'll pay the premium.  What I would do with cables is show someone to their cable. If they were particularly nice or pleasant people I would mutter under my breath for them to hold on a second, punch the SKU into my phone, then let the cashier know the customer was price matching it to the .com price. I'd also do this if they saw the price and said it was too much for a cable (it fucking is) then give them the .com price.  If they were assholes I'd let them walk out or pay full price."

Staples,34zqkm,exile0514,1 point,Tue May 5 23:13:41 2015 UTC,How would they be able to circumvent it? You return the faulty one through the till as defective and resell it thus it shows on the receipt as being exchanged for a defective one.

Staples,34zqkm,Weareoutofstock,2,Wed May 6 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you have a do a full refund, then a full re-ring if the customer uses any sort of coupon.

Staples,34z9g0,elentirion,4,Wed May 6 05:00:08 2015 UTC,"Staples doesn't cover you.  Your personal insurance is primary, Staples will only cover up to $500 (or the cost of the deductible) if you as an employee are determined to be not at fault.  Complete details are found in the COT Training, on a page you and your manager are supposed to sign.  TankeBuster is right though, it varies with insurance companies.  Mine covers me and my car (though not items contained within) as long as it isn't being used for work more than 50% of the time.  A coworker's wouldn't cover him or it at all if he was using it for work purposes."
Staples,34z9g0,kirashi3,1 point,Wed May 6 05:47:41 2015 UTC,"You can refuse the work because it cannot be proven or deemed to be safe.

Staples,34z9g0,TankeBuster,2,Thu May 7 02:26:40 2015 UTC,I actually was asked to start doing onsites and it will vary with your insurance company. So first off call them and be honest as possible but be sure to tell them your just enquiring. Tell them in detail what you will be doing and in my case they would not cover me in case of an accident. Now Staples does offer insurance for onsite employees but it relies heavily on your insurance. I don't remember the details so ask your GM to find the appropriate documents.   And of course check with your state's driving laws.
Staples,34z9g0,Raindawgify,2,Tue May 5 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"Got in an accident on an onsite, GM just laughed at me, this was ages ago"
Staples,34z9g0,kirashi3,1 point,Tue May 5 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"As I live in Canada, I cannot speak for your state or province. Here on the west coast however, we have this single and wonderful insurance company that EVERYONE in the province has to go through by law.  You can buy your insurance from any broker of your choosing, but the base insurance costs are almost always the same rates.  Anywho, most people DO NOT have Commercial Insurance for work purposes on their vehicles, unless their job directly requires that or it's their own business. The personal pleasure insurance most people have specifically states it is for a single vehicle ""driven for pleasure purposes, and can be driven to and from work within 15kms of your home.""   It under NO CIRCUMSTANCES covers you for accidents you'd get into driving FOR work related purposes. There technically is a clause that states you CAN drive FOR work related purposes no more than 6 days in a calendar month, but there's no way for you to prove its been under that 6 days, and something about insurance companies not wanting to pay you out makes me wary that they'd choose to claim you drive for work everyday, thus voiding your policy."
Staples,34z9g0,badfordabidness,2,Thu May 7 02:31:46 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to ICBC? Because if so, I much prefer that way of doing things to the way we do auto insurance down here in the states.

Then again, my cousin is an ICBC broker in Surrey, so I might be a bit biased..."

I thinking having one company running the show is better from a stability sense because they're the only one responsible for the policies.  Independent insurance brokers might give you better rates, but at least with ICBC everyone has the same policies available to them."

The way vacation works at Staples (and most other places, for that matter) you earn vacation hours throughout the year. So by the end of the year, a part time employee will earn 25 hours of vacation. Since you're a new hire and you're still within your 90 days, you unfortunately don't have any vacation hours. This doesn't mean you can't go on your trip, however, because you can just ask for that time off. Usually, if your GM isn't a dick, (s)he won't mind. The only downside is you won't be paid.

Staples,34vvwr,ienom,4,Tue May 5 00:09:22 2015 UTC,This has to be the 3rd time this year that they sent mobile signage with '¢' instead of '$'. Is it really that hard to punch a number into a template?

Staples,34wrle,sassundface,3,Tue May 5 04:58:14 2015 UTC,"The dates is one thing, that's considered our mistake since customers shouldn't have dated signage available to them. Plus, we should be ensuring it comes down.  Items in the wrong place is another deal - I know you've put things back on a random shelf before if you realized you didn't want it into shopping at a store. Customers could also do that to try and defraud us, hence the UPC restriction."
Staples,34wrle,katyrzana,3,Tue May 5 07:51:41 2015 UTC,"If the skus don't match I will NOT honor it (except in circumstances where someone has stupidly filled a whole spot with the wrong SKU so theres no chance it was a customer mistake). If the dates don't match, that is OUR fault. You can't expect the customer to read the tiny dates next to the giant price tag, honestly. Not just because customers are morons; most reasonable people just read the price."
Staples,34wrle,BubbleWrapLampShade,2,Tue May 5 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"True, and yet we expect them to notice when the big price on the tag is actually the price after rebate. I get yelled at over rebate offers almost as much as I get yelled at over the price of ink."
Staples,34wrle,katyrzana,2,Tue May 5 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't understand why we don't put rebate in BIG OLE letters. Usually if I explain to a customer that its a rebate they're ok with it, but probably 1/3rd of the time they say nevermind to purchasing it. And probably 1/15 or so scream at me about it and how it's false advertising and I need to price match it down to that price immediately x.x"
Staples,34wrle,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Tue May 5 21:25:17 2015 UTC,"We have a huge immigrant population here and in many of their home countries they've simply never encountered a rebate before.

In my head I'm thinking, ""Because we're hoping you forget to do it!"" but instead I just shrug, like, ""Welcome to corporate retail."""
Staples,34wrle,katyrzana,2,Tue May 5 21:41:59 2015 UTC,Well rebates are pretty fucking stupid so I don't blame them x.x but the predatory reasoning is very understandable when you realize the company is simply betting on customers forgetting or not being able to figure out a rebate

Staples,34wrle,Weareoutofstock,1 point,Wed May 6 23:52:28 2015 UTC,"If the sku's match then yes you match the shelf price. If the sku's don't match I generally stick to the rule of 3. If there are one or two products in the wrong spot I won't match it, if there are 3 or more I will as the chances of 3 identical products all ending up being under the wrong price tag on the same day is pretty slim so it is the fault of the close down team."
Staples,34wrle,habanerojelly,0,Tue May 5 21:26:01 2015 UTC,"A price tag is an offer, not a contract. Either party is able to attempt to negotiate or change their mind up until the transaction has been completed. Human error and computer error happen with price tags and it is not a violation of any law to withdraw an offer when you realize there has been a mistake. Most retailers will honor a price tag because of customer service reasons.  What you are not allowed to do is be deceptive. You can't intentionally lead customers to believe that an offer is real when you have no intention of honoring it.   I should note that there may be state or local laws that very from mine but I don't know of any."

Guy came in once to buy five cases of paper. Got an associate to load them on a boat to move them around. Also got a bunch of other stuff. Left without his merchandise because no one would match the price he gets on the paper when he orders through staples.com. Yea, ink and toner recycling needs a registration system of some kind, but to pin all your hopes and dreams on coupons seems wrong when you are (in theory) an office supply store trying to get small to medium business clients."
Staples,34qhm5,habanerojelly,1 point,Mon May 4 12:06:58 2015 UTC,Y'all wouldn't match Staples.com? on the same SKU?   Or did you mean Staples Advantage.
Staples,34qhm5,venturer95,2,Mon May 4 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"That was part off the problem. I believe he may have been a Staples Advantage customer but all he could tell us was""he ordered from the website"" and didn't know more about about it and didn't know of any card. He never mentioned a sales rep which I think is part of that program.  He had a big project that ate up his paper supply and needed more right away. He figured why not just stop by the store and grab it while he was out, but it was more than he expected. Staples.com shows the same price we had so there was nothing to price match.  With so many different programs and websites (staples.com, Staples Advantage, Staples Rewards, Copy Center Business Discount, and others) customers might be part of all, some or none. Streamline all this, one account searched by company name, show me their prices, normal orders (so I can get them the same paper or toner they always get) and other discounts they are entitled to. They need to be able to send anyone from the office with minimal information and get what they are entitled to regardless of who knows what office number they are listed with or what program they are part of."

Staples,34pmd1,venturer95,8,Sun May 3 12:18:05 2015 UTC,"(beware, this is longer than OP's post)  I readily admit I am not the best GM in the world with associate recognition. I'm one of those ""my team knows how I feel about them"" kind of guys.   I'll get bogged down in a project, with a customer, etc that may prevent me from noticing someone in person. However a few things my store does....  However, we're great at communicating with each other (maybe even too much) via text message. On my phone I typically have 3+ group messages with different departments and groups of people, including my keyholders. This allows us to all be plugged in to whats going on. For example, the tech associates consistently send their big sales in to the group text, and all associates (managers as well) can offer their kudos and a text message ""high five"".  Another is, while your associates work for you, you have to work for them as well. This means doing things that drive engagement and show them you care. This can be as simple as cleaning the breakroom, bathroom, or helping to throw some load for a little or performing a carryout while you're working on your stuff.  As a manager or keyholder, don't blindly preach the company gospel. While yes it is important to drive kiosk sales, offer more acounts, go after digital receipts, as a manager make something the company comes up with something that your associates want to do for you, not for big bidness Staples. I preach that the associates aren't working for Ron, Demos, & Otis. They're working for the people that are under this roof, the person that closes after your open, or opens after you close. Don't harbor any resentment that should be directed above the GM, to the GM.  My ASAT was very bad, in fact in the 60's. This is because questions that do not reflect the management team are used to calculate ASAT into 1 nice neat score.  While, in fact if you dig deeper into the questions relating to the management staff, they're all in the 90's. I'd like to say that my associates are pretty happy with me as a GM. Some of them are active posters on this Sub.  So while ASAT launches in the next 24 hours, giving bad scores on ""company questions"" will still hurt your GM, can't win.  With respect to driving engagement, the biggest things are to remember your associates are human beings and not drones. Thank them every day when they leave if you see them. Always use your star points. Not picking an AOM since April of '14? Thats horrible. Every keyholder in my store gets 3 votes to decide AOM. 1st place gets 3 points, 2nd gets 2, 3rd gets 1 point. After all 5 have voted if there's a tie, those 2 associates are voted on again with 1st place getting 2, 2nd getting 1 point. Make it a big deal when announcing the AOM. If I can ever do it at a store meeting, I'll wait all month to announce it at the meeting.  As an Ops Supervisor, you're typically the first line of management. It is important for you to realize that to the GM, you're a member of management and will be treated differently. For example you'll usually feel slighted because you wont get AOM, or a lot of star points thrown your way (I go out of my way to get my supes star points) in a typical store because ""thats why I made him the supe, I know he's great"". That is an actual quote about me from a former GM....great GM but not the best with associate engagement. You need to be the voice of the associates to the GM/SM/OM and the voice of the management team to the associates. Also, if you're not already, try to get the GM to schedule an ""off the floor"" managers meeting where you can let the 5th keyholder run the store and the 3 managers and yourself discuss these things. Maybe once a week? Its tough for my store, but if you can do it then next time you cover the floor so the 5th key can sit in.  5 great keyholders can really drive engagement, you just all need to be on the same page.   Wish you luck!"
Staples,34pmd1,Railman3,2,Sun May 3 15:42:11 2015 UTC,"I don't care so much about recognition - I care when my managers will task with me. Get down in the trenches when you can, work side-by-side, do the things that you ask of your team...that's what impresses me."

If you ever visit eastern PA let me know.  I've been considering pitching texting groups to my GM, do you use GroupMe or just all exchange numbers?  In regards to ASAT, our scores were top notch (around 95% if I recall) until last year which was the first ASAT under our new GM. They plummeted to 40% in 2014. I'm going around telling everyone that I'd love it if they are able to answer every question positively, and if there's any reason they can't I want them to let me know so I can make any changes that may be needed.   I'm on the same page as far as just saying thanks, I make sure I say thank you as my associates leave and especially mention I appreciated anything great they may have done that day. If only I had access to Manager Discretionary points as a Team Sup... I would give them out if I could. I use Peer-to-Peer almost weekly though, just like my predecessor. I like your process for choosing AOM, I'll have to run it by my GM.  And as Team Sup here I'm very much treated like a manager and not ""just a supervisor."" I know it's pretty much an in-between position, but I seem to be pretty successful in being my associates' link to management, they know 2 months ago I was in the same boat as a part-time associate, but they also (for the most part) respect the fact that I'm now an MOD and therefore I need to coordinate store tasks, but at the same time I'm pretty hands off, I let them do what they need to do and I roam the floor & engage customers. As far as AOM, I got my second AOM in March, then on the 15th I was promoted.. so I expect it will be my last and I'm ok with that. I was in line for CPC supervisor when the position opened up, but our TS moved away and my GM offered the position to me, so in a way I ""skipped a step."" I was known for being the only CPC associate to know anything or care about the rest of the store, so I guess I had that going for me lol.  Haha, management meeting, that's a funny idea xD At least that's never happened here in my 2 months as part of management. But, another idea to pitch, perhaps."
Staples,34pmd1,elentirion,1 point,Mon May 4 01:31:21 2015 UTC,Fwiw don't let them fool you they were never real scores before the fall asat.  There were only like 5 people who took it when it was good.  Under the previous gm they were strong.
Staples,34pmd1,CaptainNeedleMouse,3,Mon May 4 10:19:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's been said in another thread, but if you're looking at numbers-based stuff people have had Supervisors/Managers buy them a cheap lunch in the past.  Maybe a costco pizza they can share, something like that.  Inexpensive but rewarding.  If it's not numbers-based, unfortunately I can't help much.  Maybe buying some of those snack-sized candies and handing them out when you observe someone doing something well?"
Staples,34pmd1,CaptainNeedleMouse,1 point,Sun May 3 15:27:32 2015 UTC,I often buy drinks for my team when I get my (unfortunately daily) soda or two :)  Perhaps I can pull something from our associate fund to keep that on a more regular basis.

Staples,34pmd1,Cujo117,2,Sun May 3 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"Didn't promise I'd be original! That said I don't think any stores are doing anything for associates anymore. Not even star points anymore. With all the crap the dms are coming up with to make things harder and dealing with scheduling and finding high school kids who havent become disilusioned, to replace the seasoned techs, ditto for CPC, cutting managment staff in half and doubling the 18h/wk associates, and you have a recipie for driving your GMs insane.   That said they should still do their job, what you describe technically falls under training iirc. Good luck fixing that though...I wish I had real advice for you."
Staples,34pmd1,Cujo117,1 point,Sun May 3 13:14:27 2015 UTC,"No worries, not everyone has a magic fix.. Honestly this is a shot in the dark.. I know we have ""SuperGM"" Railman3 on here as well as a few other seasoned managers that may have some wisdom to share.   The part that sucks is my GM didn't even give out star points until our DM started ""yelling"" at everyone that we needed to use up our allotted points each month. Said GM's vacation was this week so that's when my awesome Ops mgr actually did all that.   I suppose we just have to do the best we can with that we have. And honestly, not to be cheesy but the more satisfied our associates are, the more likely they are to provide better service to customers, which makes the store better as a whole. But to me, the root of it all is our team."
Staples,34pmd1,splsone,1 point,Sun May 3 13:40:21 2015 UTC,"This is true. And this is why our awesome team fell apart with all of the changes over the last couple years...literally like 2 associates and 2 managers left that aren't newcomers, and half of the newcomers are freaking druggies cause the GMs are being told ""hire hire hire NOW!"""

EBay and Staples both have gift card deals pretty often where you can get, for example, 50$ gift cards for 40$, 100 for 80/85, etc. I used to take advantage of that stuff a lot, because it was like getting an extra 15-20% discount on everything."

I live in a rural area where most customers are not tech literate. They used to love Rewards when it was a flat 5% back, expiration dates rolled around every 3-6 months, and they got them in the mail.  Now there are $5 minimum issuance increments (in case noone did the math, that'd require a $250 pre-tax spend before a new sign-up got anything), three different earnings tiers, one-and-a-half month expiration periods, and a whole bunch of pi**ed off geriatric customers coming in to complain that they never got their Rewards (which are being issued via the website, unknown to these customers).  C'mon, Staples. Your associates are not lawyers. Cashiers don't have the time to spend explaining 50 pages of fine print to each customer at the register. Hell, I actually was pre-law in college, and even I feel ridiculous giving customers the Rewards spiel these days.

My SSM used to be one of those volunteers, and represented in Staples in such a capacity. When he left to be SSM of another store, he handed that responsibility off to me. I've only done one so far, attendance was pretty dismal, and it's only one day every other month.

The way I think of it is not every customer is singularly specially entitled. 90 other people paid me extra to do it for them, so it's not fair to them if I let you enjoy the same for free.  I do the same at my tech counter. I charge for tech help. Anyone who begs for it free is prompted with ""I charge for this service, and it would not be fair to other customers who have paid if I offered it to you for free.""

I left because I couldn't deal will all the stupid people (customers and coworkers).

I figured if those were the kinds of people the district liked to have in leadership positions, then it certainly wasn't the place for me =D  That being said, I don't regret my time there because I met some very lovely coworkers and worked with a few excellent General Managers so I learned a lot.

You cannot just blame Staples and say, ""They're just greedy..."" because the truth is companies go into business to make money just like you (no matter where you work) do so as well....to make money...not lose money.  We are responsible for what happens to us.  I applaud those who have went out and got a second and even a 3rd job to help supplement their incomes.

Staples,34igg8,BigRichie2897,3,Sat May 2 03:20:24 2015 UTC,The truth of the matter is under Obama we have went to a Nation of part time employees   If you think Staples cut hours because of Obamacare I have a bridge to sell you.
Staples,34igg8,WhateverItTakes10x,0,Sat May 2 03:33:21 2015 UTC,Do you still have any of that ocean front property in Arizona?
Staples,34igg8,Railman3,-4,Sat May 2 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"Cut hours?  The company policy has always been 20-25 hours for part time associates dating back to at least 2003.  The issue is that no one followed said policy yet there was a Map communication that came out at the beginning of 2014 stating the policy would be in full effect and disciplinary actions would take place for those who did not abide by policy.  I remember the days of PT associates easily working 30-35 hours per week.  As long as the average stayed under what was then 32 hours considered full time life was good.  Then Obama dropped the full time hours down to 30 and Staples, just like many other companies, did what many complain about.  Just goes to show that those who voted for Obama are getting what they want but sadly they are finding out that what they wanted is costing them in other areas of their life."
Staples,34igg8,WhateverItTakes10x,2,Sat May 2 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"As a PT associate I did 6 days/48 hours a week for 8 months, making sub $8/hr.  Lets not distort reality here. No one cared about PT hours prior to that MAP communication. We all new that part timers were ""standard 20 hours"" but no one blinked looking at a 35 hr/wk associate."
Staples,34igg8,rodentdp,2,Sun May 3 16:00:53 2015 UTC,Thank you for echoing the point I wrote about above being that I remember when PT associates were able to easily work 30-35 hours per week and no fuss was made about it and I'm going to call BS on the 6 days per week/48 hours per week for 8 months.  Prove it.
Staples,34igg8,Railman3,1 point,Sun May 3 19:40:39 2015 UTC,"Happened to me as well. Maybe not 48 hours, but regularly 39-42 hours a week, 6 days a week. Not a day went by where I wasn't called in on my day off, or asked to come in early or stay late...the joys of working in copy center and having worked in every department in the store meant I was constantly asked to pick up the slack. It was almost a blessing when the mandatory 25 hour rule came into effect.  Then they promoted me to Part Time Team Supervisor, and laid me off three months later, which was the best thing that company every did for me."
Staples,34igg8,WhateverItTakes10x,1 point,Sun May 3 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"Imgur  That paystub was for after I had already been with the company 2+ years and had become the ""Office Equipment Specialist"".  Work all day Sunday (alone, obviously) Then 5 shifts throughout the week. Those shifts were shorter then because I was still in school.  If you've been with the company long enough, you'll see associate connection doesn't put paystubs from 05-07 on there, but in the year between high school and college I took off I did indeed work 6 eight hour shifts, believe it as you may."

Staples,34hzqf,staplesdepotmax,2,Fri May 1 11:23:59 2015 UTC,"Second View (Sorry for the poor pano stitching) There are around 30 unsorted mixed totes of ink, some with toner and some with random USB drives underneath everything. HP and Epson are on the wall completely unsorted (blocked off by the boxes and the cart of random Canon/Lexmark/Dell Ink), some of the larger HP boxes are above (random order as well), and most are either on an unsorted (again) unseen cart in the far back right corner behind everything or unopened in their original (unmarked) cardboard boxes above on the top right. Toner is an entirely different beast. Every day there's never time allotted for me (the only BM person right now) to organize this, and pulling ink is a straight up nightmare. This is about 2.5 weeks built up since I busted ass to clear just the totes out of there. Also, we have only enough acryllics for 1/3 of the ink to go out, so many times it sits in a basket like this for days (no one ever bothers to try and put it out and help)."

They're usually pretty happy to sit down and click out a few 5s and this way I get their CSAT before they have the chance to go home and blame us because of some other random thing that just happened to start with their computer after we worked on it. (I don't know if this is a common phenomenon across the board, but at my store I seem to get a lot of, ""You removed a virus yesterday and today my printer won't print blue!"" kind of shit. Fine, give me your lunatic hot alert later because you don't believe me when I say that nothing I could have done would possibly make your printer stop printing in blue, but at least I got a good CSAT right now.)

Staples,34cesc,KrackKills,4,Thu Apr 30 01:52:11 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, doing pc to pc transfer can take longer, depending on the machine, it takes about 5 mins to pull a hard drive in most models, so no extra charge, but some laptops (looking at you hp and asus) have weird builds that I would consider charging an extra 30 for. But thats once in a blue moon"
Staples,34cesc,Raindawgify,3,Thu Apr 30 03:05:49 2015 UTC,If you have to take apart the whole machine like on some dell laptops we consider a custom config charge as well but frankly it's rare .

Staples,34cesc,PeopleKillMe,3,Thu Apr 30 02:37:24 2015 UTC,I brought this up because my manager was arguing with me that if i removed a hard disk it's technically more than a data transfer. He wants me to charge at lease 69.99 + 39.99 (internal component install). It makes sense enough i guess.
Staples,34cesc,operacarmen,4,Thu Apr 30 09:05:01 2015 UTC,Well ... your manager is a greedy Jerk
Staples,34cesc,operacarmen,5,Thu Apr 30 02:52:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call him greedy, i don't blame him really. The DM is up his ass because our tech numbers are so low. We get like 1200 a week on average nowadays with a goal of 2500 a week. Problem is we aren't in control of people having PC problems, and best buy is so close, and they actually advertise so... I just think its lame that a store that is hurting for tech will 9 times out of 10 charge charge more than another store that hits budget. Defeats the whole purpose of being a chain (where prices are set, services are the same, etc)."
Staples,34cesc,drdokatz,0,Thu Apr 30 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that Sales managers are under great pressure to perform ""numbers"" .... however Greed and high prices = customer will refuse the sale OR customer will never come back = less sales and less numbers  ...

After that we had to set up CPC, the Tech Bench area and unpack and put away every tote by 7am so the store could open. So glad i never have to do that again...it was pretty rough.

Our Sales and Service Manager took our IS and 2 other part-timers pretty much out of uniform for 2 months to help move the store. Some product went to warehouse but most moved. We had help of a third party but it was pretty much a 4-man crew and a project manager. It was definitely stressful for everyone involved.

That or someone whos very uncreative with their Christmas presents!

GM shut him down.  According to the large quantity orders (or cross channel, can't remember which) phone number we're not supposed to allow more than 5 per customer.

Essentially a tip for the store, he didn't even want the pamphlets. He threw $10 at us because he knows it's not a good situation for us to be in, and he doesn't want to get turned away.

I mean its not like it comes out of your pay (Staples basically cannot pay most of their associates any less legally). Let corporate worry about them. If someone wanted all the stock of an item, I'd sell it unless a manager says otherwise. My training said nothing about refusing a sale for any customer. Lots of companies get resalers going into them, and most are doing fine. Staples issues have nothing to do with resalers ""robbing"" the store."
Staples,34902r,UnnamedStaplesDrone,4,Thu Apr 30 08:15:57 2015 UTC,"I don't worry about them personally, or on behalf of Staples. But I work in a small store that only ever has 1-2 of each laptop at any given time. It was pretty hard to help customers when I would be cleaned out after one of those one hundred dollar off coupons show up. I would rather sell a computer with no attachments to someone who will actually use the computer than to someone who will turn around and try to sell the computer for a quick profit. Because we are small, I know a lot of our customers by name. Some of them are in here 3-4 times a month. That's why I worry about resellers."

Staples,343s64,CaptainNeedleMouse,9,Tue Apr 28 02:53:43 2015 UTC,"As a Cert tech I generally follow the following scheme:  In person customers > Phone Customers > Load > ""Fixing"" computers. I know at least one of our cert techs refuses to ever help with load.  No management has ever specifically told me this though.  Rando manager last month told me I was responsible for down-stocking printers, desks, and shredders at the end of the night after a year of knowing nothing about this.  None of my other managers have ever asked this of me, and had no idea wtf when I asked them.  Training is bad. Managers are bad. Staples. Make bad happen."
Staples,343s64,GoodFoBidness,4,Tue Apr 28 02:07:47 2015 UTC,"I worked with GMs who took this route toward stocking those items and GMs who preferred to have it shot and done on the pull list.  I have to say, having it down separate from the list at the end of the night is much more effective.  On topic - The associate who was doing packout may have been drowning in customers on the sales floor while you were with that 1 customer letting the phone ring. Intakes can take a while, but they definitely DON'T require you to be talking and forward facing the customer 100% of the time. Excusing yourself for a minute to talk a call is something that's definitely doable. If the intake situation is something so perplexing and difficult to figure out that you have to sit there and spend a ton of time with the customer, you should be bringing them in for a diagnostic anyway.  I hated when intakes took more than 10 minutes. Unless you're setting up follow up visits, talking about other services/products, or they're a potentially huge sale amount, it just doesn't take that long. People that take an hour to do an intake are, honestly, usually not very good techs.  Not saying you took an hour or that you're not good. Just ranting about people that over complicate something that's pretty simple I suppose."

Staples,343s64,GoodForBidness,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"Your right, I hardly do any freight because there is always something to do, I don't just stand around and sit on my ass. There is always a customer to be called, OMS notes to be updated, a computer that matrix says they ""can't connect to"" even though I'm on the Matrix screen with functioning internet or a call for an Easy Tech to ring  This of course is going to change with primetime because I'm not going to be allowed to do any of that from 11-2. So just like today when I helped with freight because I was required to be on the floor. During primetime if there is freight to be done and no customers to be helped, I will do freight. Just like he never hooks computers up to the matrix, he has other things he's responsible for."

Inversely, GFBidness has the right answer. Customers who spent gas to come in come first, then calls, then load. Sir Freightsalot over there should put down the keyboards and go get the phone in this instance. You're making money for the store at the moment, so you can't get the call.

Staples,343vj6,Moopsyy,18,Tue Apr 28 02:23:15 2015 UTC,Have you considered fellating your customers?
Staples,343vj6,GoodFoBidness,7,Tue Apr 28 02:32:06 2015 UTC,The only way around these CSAT ruiners is to tell every customer that gets a survey that anything less than a 5 means we didnt do our jobs. from my experience this lets the customer know its about the job the associate did not the products. you will still get some dumb ones but should reduce them. Also rebates is a big one and i ALWAYS tell a customer that an item has a rebate before i ring it up(at least the obvious ones like paper). That way if they say nevermind or something i can show them an alternative that doesnt have it thats slightly cheaper.
Staples,343vj6,viperdude,2,Tue Apr 28 03:41:40 2015 UTC,"tell every customer that gets a survey that anything less than a 5 means we didnt do our jobs   This right here.

Staples,343vj6,elentirion,2,Tue Apr 28 05:25:05 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd love to make joke comments.. I know the feeling.  Honestly, look at your percentages for your CSAT. Look at the walk to product percentage, speed of checkout, etc. Try having only the happy customers do the surveys or something crazy like that. There are a lot of specifics that you can go into, and in all honesty that really isn't your job, this is more your GM's. Essentially GM's are suppose to oversee the Copy Center, Assistant oversees the sales in Tech, you as team supe or operations manager (whatever we're called this time) need to focus on MPP, safety, LP audits, and operations like POGs and promo playbook. Unless I'm really getting abused.  But look at the metrics on your next monthly CSAT and see where you can improve from that. Mid month is a pain to go by, easier to see the full metric. I can't wait to see how much our CSAT drops and my GM flips out because we were 100% mid month."
Staples,343vj6,Cujo117,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:47:49 2015 UTC,"Walk to product should increase thanks to prime time being back again, and if the GM and SSM aren't on the floor during prime time assisting customers, that is an issue. Speak up to them if they are sitting in the office doing nothing."

It doesn't always happen that way, of course, but that might be the beef your GM had with you, that you didn't see the sale through. Had the cashier not mentioned Square Trade, those ESP dollars would have walked out and it would have been your ""fault"". That's how my GM sees it, anyway."
Staples,341ufs,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:11:16 2015 UTC,If I had time to ring them out I would there are only 3 easy techs that work at my store. The other two are out often.

Staples,341ufs,BubbleWrapLampShade,3,Mon Apr 27 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your manager should have been praising the cashier for stepping up to the plate instead of berating you for not getting your name on the plan, that's for sure - because at the end of the day, a plan was sold, period.  In my store, when a cashier mentions Square Trade at checkout, if the customer says yes that they want it, the cashiers ask, ""Did anyone help you with your purchase today?"" and when the customer says, ""Actually, BubbleWrap was very helpful..."" then, boom, the plan goes under my name. (We don't do it that way when we're doing spiffs, of course, but in general it's more helpful for our tech's numbers to get the plans under our names than the cashiers to get them under theirs, because they're not held as accountable to the ESP dollars.)"

Truck driver needs an easy way to enter his expenses into a spreadsheet while on the road? Here you go, this has Excel and a keyboard. Student or author that wants something portable for working on-the-go? Throw your work in the cloud and pick it up anywhere. Parent wants something cheap for their kids/elderly parents where they can't get into too much trouble messing anything up? This is perfect. Want something with the size and functionality of a tablet but also want a keyboard? This is both.  It has an SD card slot for a limited amount of expandable storage, a micro-HDMI port and an insane battery life.  I didn't think there was a setting in the BIOS to be able to boot from USB so I don't know about the Linux thing (I have two Raspberry Pis, though, so I wasn't really looking).  Of the three I have, one lives in my basement hooked up to the kids' television with an external hard drive full of their movies on it, one I use in my tech toolkit and one basically belongs to my 6-year-old who uses it for Minecraft with no issues.  So many of my customers come in thinking they have to buy these big laptops just to check their Facebook and look up recipes and shit, and that's not the case. So I steer them toward this machine, which also includes Office 365 for a year for free...so since we've saved all this money today, why don't we go take a look at some cases and screen protectors and, hey, this machine has two USB ports so let's get you a wireless mouse while we're at it, and the microHDMI to HDMI cord is really nice to have, better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it, am I right, etc. etc. etc.  I'm honest about the limitations of the machine, I'm honest about issues that I've had with mine (the trackpad, in particular, has issues on all three of mine) but I'm also honest about the need that this machine fulfills. Next thing you know, my craptop market basket is blowing everything else out of the water and, oh, yeah, we have a special protection plan going that's exclusive to this machine at a discounted rate.  Then I sit back and watch the Star Points roll in!*  *sarcasm.  It really is a badass little machine.

It's astounding how many come back that just don't boot. Why did we stop using Nexicore? They weren't perfect but at least had far fewer fuckups.
Staples,340vu4,Otis_Waistline,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:38:27 2015 UTC,Just how often do you send out computers for depot repairs? It has been a long time since I have seen a store nearby do that. Typically we talk the customers in to a new PC with Total Support
Staples,340vu4,Kralin,2,Tue Apr 28 02:35:11 2015 UTC,Its usually 1 per week to two weeks. Most of the time it is a customer who already has Total Support that we send out (having SquareTrade reimburse them).
Staples,340vu4,Otis_Waistline,2,Tue Apr 28 10:15:38 2015 UTC,How is that reimbursement thru square trade working for ya. Any problems with st kicking them back? Sounds like a good way to boost et sales after selling the ts.
Staples,340vu4,prothios,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, the only time we have had an issue is when the customer has unknowingly exceeded the $500 limit for reimbursement. Have you or anyone else had issues?"
Staples,340vu4,Otis_Waistline,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:18:10 2015 UTC,"ST is great about reimbursement. I've only ever had one problem with ST and it was because there was no company consensus about Surfaces. We sold Total Support on them which included laptop hardware protection, which covers everything in the box minus battery. Tablet protection only covers the tablet itself, not the charger or anything else in the box.  With a lot if running shit up the chain I got them to reimburse my customer's broken charger. A few weeks later there was a MAP sent out that Surfaces are only to be sold tablet ST.  Other than they they've been completely hassle free."

Staples,340vu4,Otis_Waistline,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:19:33 2015 UTC,I'd always lay this out for the customer as options. You have two choices. Have us fix it and get reimbursed or send it to them and pay nothing. Always sounds better with choices.

Staples,33uz8r,SmileyVV,3,Sun Apr 26 04:50:00 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's $29! Check if you have recent SKU changes.

Once I touch that device, they'll assume it's my fault."

Staples,33uz8r,douglasr007,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:42:15 2015 UTC,Too bad. I'm not their mistake for not being able to manage time schedules. I say it with a firm tone and make them understand that an order needs to be done right and to our standards before we can say it's done. I usually tell them I would rather give a realistic time line than a false hope for getting something done. It just saves trouble and CPC training mentions that.
Staples,33uz8r,katyrzana,6,Thu Apr 30 21:15:14 2015 UTC,"Up in Canada we have a tutorial sku we charge, it's a dollar a minute. You bet it's good money if they go for it, and if they don't, well, we don't have to worry about the problem.  I've had a lot of people who have no place using a computer - they don't even get the most basic of the basics. They essentially know what a power button is and to press it to make it turn on, and that's about it.  I will offer some advice should there be any newer or naive associates here: If you need someone gone, reach for the wallet (figuratively). We had a lady coming in almost constantly for free tech help until we charged her $45 for 45 minutes. Never seen her since. Offer free help once and you will never hear the end of it.  Mind you, many of us have families, so I'm sure we're intimately familiar with that problem."

Staples,33uz8r,katyrzana,2,Sun Apr 26 18:46:41 2015 UTC,"Rush fee is really $5 for what I keep seeing online.  For the sake of CPC, don't state a rush fee. We don't offer a rush service anymore for a reason. We only ""rush"" shipping and designs. It's realistic to state they are other people orders and turn around time is 24 hours at least. If they complain, I state it's that I want to make sure the quality is to my and the copy print's standards. I would rather have the product done right then done now."
Staples,33uz8r,The_Moot,2,Sun Apr 26 19:58:08 2015 UTC,"The rush fee online is volume based (sorta, not sure how it works). $5 is the minimum.

Would you like to speak to a manager?""  When they keep having to explain that to a few irate customers they will probably let you keep them up at the register. As a supervisor I always kept them up there but I wouldnt give it out to every single person, but if they asked for it then yes. It's posted on Staples.com, it's not like it's a trade secret or the recipe for Coca-cola. One of the bigger issues with Staples management is they micromanage unimportant things, but are actively un-involved in things that actually matter. Also, managers are not to discipline associates in public. He should have called you into the office or pulled you aside privately and calmly and cordially explained the reason. Under no circumstances should managers attempt to bully or humiliate associates over the headsets."
Staples,33w4ge,DaBidnessman,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:03:59 2015 UTC,"After he called me out on the headset he ended up calling me in the office, but was all nice about it at that point. Maybe he felt bad, but there was no apology so I still felt kinda shitty about it.   This happens a lot and not just to me. He's not a shitty manager by any means, totally a nice guy, but he's got a temper and it's not very fun to be around lol."

Staples,33w4ge,DaBidnessman,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:35:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know that that is accurate. I was a manager at my store and that was never communicated to me in any way, shape, form or fashion either explicitly or implicitly. That type of attitude sounds more like a character flaw or mental insecurity rather than company policy."
Staples,33w4ge,devlan2003,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:42:15 2015 UTC,"It's still inappropriate, and any member of management should know better."
Staples,33w4ge,KrackKills,3,Thu Apr 30 09:01:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and if you refuse to apply a coupon for a customer and they make a big stink to the manager, hell probably give in and apply it for them anyways making you look like the schmuck.  Quite the pickle."
Staples,33w4ge,KrackKills,3,Thu Apr 30 08:31:20 2015 UTC,"Lol exactly, it actually happened today literally an hour after he yelled at me. 20% off office supplies coupon apparently doesn't apply to calculators, he applied it anyways.

Staples,33w4ge,fernando_69,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm saying. Customers like me because I try my best to make them happy so they walk out of the store thinking, ""I'll definitely be back here."" It's not even a selfish thing. I don't actually give a fuck whether or not they come back, but it's my job to provide good customer service. So I'm doing my job."
Staples,33w4ge,IckyChris,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:04:38 2015 UTC,"Some customers just won't make the sale without a coupon. Discount business is better than no business.  In my experience anyways customers given a coupon will buy something extra that is more than the price of the discount just because they got a bit extra or will come back for the extra service.   Honestly, people that don't understand that coupons don't lose money as much as they buy confidence and good will shouldn't be managers."
Staples,33w4ge,fernando_69,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:45:52 2015 UTC,"That's what confuses me the most: You WANT people to buy things here; your REASONING for coupons is ""it gets customers in the door."" But if they're in the door and we refuse to honor a coupon because they forgot it, there's a good chance they'll just walk out without making a purchase.   On the other hand, if we honor the coupon because it's, wait for it, good customer service, they're going to buy the item, AND likely be a repeat customer."
Staples,33w4ge,fernando_69,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:04:42 2015 UTC,"I have a customer who chronically ""forgets"" her coupons. I've started hiding my phone when she comes in the door. I think if you own a business and know you are going to travel to Staples, and you are planning to make a purchase, take 10 seconds of your own time to check the website on your own phone to see if there's a coupon."
Staples,33w4ge,fernando_69,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:49:27 2015 UTC,"Good point. I generally tell them to try to pull it up on their phone, but it's usually the older women who simply forget and don't have a smartphone. That's when I make an exception. It's harmless, at least to me"
Staples,33w4ge,joebacca121,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"Its margin erosion.  While I am all for applying any applicable coupons, they are intended to drive incremental sales and visits.   When a customer is at the register, they've made their purchase decision. Arbitrarily applying a % off coupon that they were not aware of is bad for bidness. Applying it because they mention it, is good customer service.  A best practice would be for your sales floor associates to be aware of and leverage any additional coupons or savings that a customer is  eligible for, to drive additional sales.   15% off any one item? Leverage that coupon by informing them that the money saved will help to offset or cover the cost of the Squaretrade, additional ink, etc.   And while people say they're building loyal customers, improving CSAT, etc. the fact is that the results simply do not show that. Company wide CSAT is low (multiple things contribute to this) and most stores are negatively comping year over year.  When doing this, make it a point to let the customer know about the CSAT survey, encourage them to provide feedback, etc."
Staples,33w4ge,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE,2,Mon Apr 27 04:28:33 2015 UTC,"That's definitely what I do. If a customer mentions a coupon, OR is wanting to not make a purchase because the price is too high, I give them the coupon, and always tell them about the survey. They're always appreciative so I figured I was just providing good service  Edit: I just started really pushing the survey in this past month, so at the end of the month we'll see if my theory is correct or not lol"

Staples,33vwef,venturer95,5,Sun Apr 26 04:35:44 2015 UTC,I would've signed off the register and asked the GM to finish the transaction. No way I'm taking on that liability.
Staples,33vwef,AIO12,2,Sun Apr 26 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"I worked at a different retail giant and our corporate policy was to accept bills no matter how fake they look. Apparently it was insured (whether federally or however). But accusing a customer of counterfeit money when it's not can lead to issues way bigger than losing $100. We tend to think that's a lot of money, especially those of us at tier 4. But id be willing to bet Staples is willing to trade $100 over a potential frivolous lawsuit 100 times out of 100."
Staples,33vwef,bopisalert,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"Then why make us even check? If a thief passes off a $100 and we checked it and accepted it anyway, they would just try it at other staples and keep coming back sending different people. The goverment does not compensate for fake bills so I would think it would be a private insurance policy."
Staples,33vwef,kaiten408,3,Wed Apr 29 04:40:38 2015 UTC,Your GM is a fucking idiot
Staples,33vwef,DaBidnessman,2,Sun Apr 26 19:07:44 2015 UTC,I might just end up doing that. I'm worried it's going to come down on me.
Staples,33vwef,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE,2,Sun Apr 26 03:33:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with the reporting to ethicslink. Do you also have counterfeit detection pens? We never scanned any bills, but we had dozens of those pens."
Staples,33vwef,joebacca121,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:40:46 2015 UTC,We've got those too.
Staples,33vwef,venturer95,0,Sun Apr 26 05:07:03 2015 UTC,Definitely use the pen. We ditched the shitty machine.
Staples,33vwef,venturer95,3,Sun Apr 26 05:12:17 2015 UTC,"The pen is easier to get past though. All the pen does is ensure the correct type of paper was used to make the bill. The pen cannot stop someone who bleached a $5 bill and reprinted a $50 bill on it. The machine checks for multiple anti-counterfeiting measures including a UV stripe, magnetic ink, and a watermark with the denomination of the bill on it.  Still, though, I've found the best way to determine a bill's authenticity is to hold it up to the light and check for the watermark."
Staples,33vwef,venturer95,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:17:33 2015 UTC,"If I report it to ethicslink, will he know it was me? Will I get in trouble?"
Staples,33vwef,elentirion,2,Mon Apr 27 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"It will send an anonymous email to your GM regarding the issue and i think it CCs the regional HR rep or whatever that position is. However it'd be safe your GM will assume it is you. Better bet would be to call HR directly, and request anonymity."
Staples,33vwef,venturer95,2,Sun Apr 26 14:40:08 2015 UTC,"But will they explain to him what I called about? Even if it were anonymous, he'd probably put 2 and 2 together because I doubt he forgot what happened. I might call anyways because these few incidents I've described are just a few of the many things that have been really bothering me.  edit: plus everyone in my store jokes and brags that it's an ""HR free zone"". Which it's okay sometimes because they usually mean just, like, we all make slightly inapproprate jokes, but it makes me a bit uncomfortable thinking maybe I'd be looked at like a snitch for calling"
Staples,33vwef,venturer95,2,Mon Apr 27 00:10:57 2015 UTC,"Well unfortunately it is risky in this case. Even though there is a strict non-retaliation policy... people can be idiots in the workplace. It's your call, I'd say. If you have friends in management at other stores by chance, you might want to speak with them.  Although, to be honest, even if some random manager from a random store (waves) reported the issue, they'd have to say how they came across the information. I have actually reported an issue to EthicsLink before so if you want some advice feel free to reach out by message."
Staples,33vwef,venturer95,3,Mon Apr 27 01:06:32 2015 UTC,"I've only had to do this once (and not with Staples) but i hand the bill back and say ""I'm afraid this is a counterfeit bill. You should probably trace your purchases to see where it came from. Do you have an alternate method of payment?""   I'd ask your GM why he/she told you to accept it, even though it failed all tests. Or, ask an assistant manager/supervisor to check with the GM for you if you're not comfortable. As a sup I'd never accept bills that fail the scanner, and will always back my associates when they need to refuse. Thankfully, haven't had to yet."
Staples,33vwef,UnnamedStaplesDrone,3,Mon Apr 27 01:17:00 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'm worried about with that response is if the customer gets upset, then I'd have to call my GM where he'd end up telling me to accept it anyway. He's always so quick to just simply please to customer.   Once this lady had a coupon, but it wouldn't work so we price matched the item down to 0 so it ended up being free (the coupon was for buy one get one free I believe), but she ended up returning the item and she was pissed because the register wasn't going to give her any money back, for obvious reasons.   My GM went and literally gave her 20$ out of the safe. Just so she'd shut up and leave. I dunno anymore man"
Staples,33vwef,Spaalone,5,Sun Apr 26 06:01:41 2015 UTC,"That's bad business.  The customer didn't pay for the product, wouldn't have paid for the product, but the GM gives the customer the money anyways?  In any case, in my area the MOD is supposed to check all bills larger than a $20.  Sometimes it happens sometimes it doesn't, but at that point it is the MOD's responsibility.  If the MOD was there with you and told you to accept it, it's them.  If they weren't, then they need to be."
Staples,33vwef,BROdo_Baggins,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:11:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she was complaining that the coupon shouldn't have taken the 20$ off one item but should've taken it off the whole bill. Sorry, our registers don't work like that lol. :/"
Staples,33vwef,BROdo_Baggins,1 point,Sun Apr 26 08:00:36 2015 UTC,"Okay... now that really worries me... You mean the $20 courtesy coupon or a $20 bill? If the latter, that's a big problem. It's one thing to price override it down to nothing in lieu of a coupon, no big deal, but flat out taking money out of the safe because she wanted money for a product she got for free? I'm all for satisfied customers, but I draw the line there, I would never break in to someone mad that they're not getting refunded for something they got for free, that's insane!"

Staples,33vwef,Scofflaw60,3,Sun Apr 26 23:53:54 2015 UTC,"Well, there are courtesy coupons in the safe to be given at manager discretion, hopefully that's what he meant.   *edit to clarify: They're essentially statement coupons to be used to avoid hot alerts and make people happy."

They never made any sense to me. It's trading future sales for slightly better sales today.

The rebate should print regardless. So far we've not had anyone come in complaining it doesn't work."

Staples,33ty1y,TheSerialVapist,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:52:48 2015 UTC,As far as I know the offer is $30-$50 back in the form of rebate if you trade in. There is no instant savings. Rebate forms print once the recycle SKU is rang.

I told him, I knew he was being a jerk and that he could get out of here faster and piss him off by purchasing the warranties and then returning them within 14 days. It was awesome, he purchased the 2 year accidental plan on the laptop, got a case, some mice, a printer and a printer warranty, it was about $600 market basket and he was so happy with himself, I could barely keep from laughing at him. The next week, I came in and his ESP number was like -$213. I looked at him with a straight face and said ""What happened with the ESP"". He looked at me all frustrated and said something like that guy returned the laptop warranty, the mice, the printer and the printer warranty.

If they were -actually- asking you to scam people like this dude keeps spouting off, it would be different, but they just ask you to sell freaking protection plans and paper clips. It IS as easy as finding jobs, open up the newspaper or go to indeed.com. If we play the same cards /u/operacarmen is playing after he made fun of how little I potentially made, you could get paid more somewhere else.

This guy has the audacity (after I waited for him to get off his 3 minute phone conversation he started half way into this encounter) to look me in the eyes and say ""I don't care if you have to rip open a package on the shelf and shove this one in it and send it back, it will get returned.""

Staples,33psbk,nachoiskerka,2,Fri Apr 24 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Had something similar happen with a lady that brought in a printer. Granted she did have it in a box, but she had no receipt and said that her husband was the one that bought it with his card. She had it with her, but the printer was also bought at another store and it wasn't coming up on our system.   I decided to look at the printer and it wasn't broken at all. All that had happened was that the auto feed roller housing was opened and I told her that it wasn't broken and proceeded to close it. There was another customer close by and she said that I had fixed it, but the lady that was returning the printer just walked away without saying anything. It had been a few minutes after the lady returning the printer left and I had a conversation with the one that had seen me ""fix it"". I was telling her that I really don't understand how it is some people give up on things so easily and so on. Then the customer asks me where the owner of the printer had gone. I was about to say I didn't know when the lady reappeared and said ""She's here."" Thought she might have heard some of what we had said, but I guess not.  Anyway, my manager decided to give her a printer off the shelf without doing any sort of formal exchange for it. I was a bit pissed to say the least."

Staples,33oskg,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:01:21 2015 UTC,Half the associates swiveled the earpiece around so the speaker faces outward. No more uncomfortable bump poking your ear and you can still hear just fine
Staples,33oskg,good1god,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:40:25 2015 UTC,"I hate the ear piece. I've hated it since day one. It's hard enough to pay attention to some customers without hearing ""how many email receipts did you get this hour?"" Followed by all the responses from each associate.   I keep mine clipped to my back pocket and when I'm with a customer keep it turned down extremely low to the point where it's basically off. I pretty much just hear something come through that I can't make out. When I finish up with a customer I'll find the MOD and ask them if they needed me or if there was something concerning me. My GM and MODs  do not mind this. When ear piece people are with a customer they don't respond anyways. When I specifically request an associate and don't hear a response I assume they are with a customer or in the bathroom or something.   My biggest gripe with the ear piece is the shit ton of phone calls each day for ET. Having two conversions going through your ears at once is insane. So many times I see associates mid phone call rip out their ear piece mid call and leave it dangling to re attach later.   Our stores aren't huge. If there is a great joke about a customer to be had I'd do it 1 to 1 anyways ear piece or not. I am interacting with people on the floor or phone far too much for that to always be in my ear.   Overall I like the convenience of the walkie talkie but our stores are small enough to deal with things without them as well."

It just wasn't worth putting unnecessary wear and tear on my car for minimal reimbursement. If they ever really needed me to do an onsite more than 10 miles away they would give me a ride or have a volunteer ET drive and take me. If an ET drove me I would train them on how to do an onsite so if they opted to in the future they would have a better understanding on how to do it. They never forced anyone to volunteer to drive.

You or a manager/sup can also use MyTimeManager (I think) to go back and check your punches. If the punches are correct and your hours on the check are off then you'll have to escalate it. If you mis-punched you'll have to probably have to work that out with your manager. I think there's also a clause of some sort that says we are responsible for final punches. Edit: spelling."

Staples,33m924,joebacca121,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:47:33 2015 UTC,First thing you do is check your punches. Make sure they're correct and haven't been edited. After that submit a HR eticket. You usually get it within 2 or 3 days at the most.

Around a month ago an error caused me to lose a full day from my paycheck (YAY SQL ERRORS!) and my GM made a joke and then said that he'd contact the help desk and that I'd get a check with my missing hours in a week or so. I got it the next week."

I told my GM about it and he filed a ticket last week and said it should be fixed in my paycheck that I received yesterday. Well my paycheck came around and I had my usual pay plus the easter time and a half pay plus an extra 4 hours... 4, not 9. I don't understand. I told him and I guess he has to submit another ticket."

Staples,33lfl2,WhateverItTakes10x,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"I mean it's still against policy. Policies for cash are set for a reason, if somebody getting paid a higher rate for being management can't follow policy they shouldn't be working there anymore."

Staples,33lfl2,douglasr007,0,Thu Apr 23 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"Do you even know why the rules like that are set in place? To deter any chance of somebody wanting to rob the store. Not closing it shows anybody potentially scoping it out, or even just in the store with no prior intentions a level of leniency which makes your store now slightly more attractive to hit. When you leave the opportunity open you create the potential for crime to happen. If they had just closed the damn door while going into the safe like you're supposed to nobody would have taken a picture of anything."
Staples,33lfl2,WhateverItTakes10x,4,Thu Apr 23 19:27:33 2015 UTC,The area he is located in already requires a pass code to get to that point. They were both in a secure area when he took the picture. You throw around policy....if you go by policy why does he have a cell phone out taking pictures?
Staples,33lfl2,douglasr007,2,Thu Apr 23 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"Sadly, the passcode is the same at every store.  Second, the cashier office is in a padded door that is alarmed with CCTV (depending on the store).  Third, Staples policy is the only thing I'm explaining, it doesn't mean I think the policy is right or wrong, just what I know about it."
Staples,33lfl2,indrion,4,Thu Apr 23 19:57:46 2015 UTC,The pass code is not the same in every store. Also not every store has CCTV.
Staples,33lfl2,indrion,-1,Thu Apr 23 20:20:34 2015 UTC,Pass code to enter the Manager's section with the push in knobs? I've so far been to 6 stores in different areas that worked with the code. Best one was using the bathroom that was looked with the same combination.
Staples,33lfl2,thanksstaplesguy,-5,Thu Apr 23 20:32:15 2015 UTC,To get his slacking ass manager hopefully fired because she can't do her job correctly?  Unless you own the company you should be adhering to the rules they're setting.
Staples,33lfl2,indrion,4,Thu Apr 23 19:54:47 2015 UTC,Then why does he have his phone out?  Why is he on Staples reddit? Why did he break like 4 policies posting it? Don't argue policy because we all post here knowing we shouldn't.
Staples,33lfl2,WhateverItTakes10x,2,Thu Apr 23 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"When did I say he was in the right? You're being paid by corporate to do a job with the instructions set by corporate. If you're on the clock, you follow their rules.   Ever think that maybe the reason the door is supposed to be closed is something to do with their insurance terms? If your register needed to have a drop done and you get robbed chances are insurance will only cover up to X over what's supposed to be the maximum amount allowed in the drawer. If you're supposed to have the door open and you don't, then you get robbed, guess what happens?"

Staples,33lfl2,douglasr007,-3,Thu Apr 23 20:22:19 2015 UTC,I feel like 99% of staples workers are scumbag pieces of shit which is what drew me to quit. I was told to blatantly lie to customers about their computers and my managers knew nothing about computers. The store manager would insult customers on the floor from a distance over the walkies and tell us to rush old people out because they annoyed him.   I also feel like if you can't adhere to a simple corporate policy you have no business being in management or even sales. You're being paid to do a job with instructions set by corporate. Yes the person taking a picture and being on the reddit is breaking policy too.

That doesn't change the fact that the op who shared the pic is a prick. Also, if he was the one who took the pic, he can be held accountable as well depending on how the GM feels.

I was wondering where the extra 4 hours came from. The week prior I filed a ticket with my GM because I wasn't paid for 7.5 hours I worked and they told me it would be tagged onto the next weeks pay (yesterday). So I was wondering if the 4 hours was them screwing the ticket up or something else... I'm so confused. I just want to be paid for the time I work haha.

Staples,33fb6r,easytech109,3,Wed Apr 22 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly if someone inquires about us working on a Mac I direct them to an apple store. Yeah they'll get charged a shit ton as per usual with Apple products, but they'll get their item fixed correctly."
Staples,33fb6r,Synnerrs,3,Wed Apr 22 02:56:03 2015 UTC,Honestly as someone who has a Mac it's not generally expensive. Sometimes even cheaper than our crazy prices!
Staples,33fb6r,asc6,2,Wed Apr 22 03:06:51 2015 UTC,"yeah, staples prices are nothing to be happy about.  There's plenty of quality independent shops in my city that will do stuff for 1/2 to 1/3 of what staples charges."
Staples,33fb6r,john_dune,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:02:07 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about our prices. I mean the overpriced dollar amount that Apple sets. It's manufacturer controlled pricing. Why get a 2000$ macbook when a 800-1000$ Windows laptop can do the same things if not more? Hell. I could build a sexy gaming rig for 2000$ that would destroy a similarly priced Mac.

Staples,33er4u,thisainteasy555,7,Tue Apr 21 22:47:43 2015 UTC,"I'm ET as well and I fill in for cashiers here and there when we're stuck - I wouldn't take that job permanently even with a raise over what I'm making now.  If you're not able to sell raincoats in a hurricane then you really shouldn't even think about trying to juggle your line while simultaneously getting email captures on digital receipts, pulling Rewards signups (just wait until you have some elderly person filling out the form, then holding up the line to call someone because they can't remember their new address, then at the end they tell you they don't want to put down their phone number or email because they don't want to be harassed - that happened today, I could have killed the dude), pitching SquareTrade, remembering the VIBE behaviors jerk-off motion AND dealing with those customers that come straight through the door and bark at you for guidance finding their item they didn't even start to look for...then you get the person at checkout that asks you to look up if they have any rewards available (""You ALWAYS do it at the register, what do you mean you can't do it? You ALWAYS do it!"") combined with the coupon monsters and the dot com pickups...  Cashiering is a pain in the fucking ASS. Maybe it's just because it's a different flavor of ass than I'm used to, but these past few days filling in as cashier has sucked donkey dicks. Every bathroom break is a broadcast, because you can't just sneak away, and there is only so long you can entertain yourself with the ad prep and cleaning the little bit around your station to stave off boredom...  Yeah, fuck being a cashier. I don't know how they do it."
Staples,33er4u,BubbleWrapLampShade,3,Tue Apr 21 23:00:06 2015 UTC,"Canadian here, I'm in the same position as OP. On slow days, it's social club among cashiers while tech are busting their buns filling, ZBW, cleaning etc. Except the cashiers make more than me cause they've been here longer. I think it's BS. In Canada, none of those problems except for email capture exist. We have AirMiles which takes care of itself, never heard of SquareTrade, never heard of VIBE, have simply scheduled coupons that never last more than a week and dot com pickups are handled by department.   I'd love to sit around and get paid to play with a laser all day."

Well, really he quit and working OS not ET was one of the ""conditions"" of him coming back, for similar reasons that you're looking to transfer departments.  Most of the time unless your wage is over the cap for a position you move to, you will retain it. However, since it is a retrograde move from Grade 3/2 to Grade 1, keeping it isn't guaranteed. Depends on your GM and your district's salary plan."
Staples,33er4u,venturer95,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:14:39 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation during my time with the company. I have a very strong tech background and have a CS degree. I was having a hard time finding a job and worked at Staples. I quickly grew tired of the pressure of ET sales and was absolutely terrible at it. About 6 months in our IA/IS had left. I inquired about the position and they granted it to me. I loved it. Sometimes it was hard to balance the job and help customers but I was so much happier. I spent about 2 years as IA and was promoted to TS. I've been gone from Staples for about a year and a half and have finally gotten my dream job as a sysadmin, but maybe check with your management what other options are available. I always hated being on register. It was way too repetitive and I felt like a robot repeating myself hundreds of times a day. Good luck!"

I've just found things go much smoother if people have the good sense to leave me be. I don't care for them and it's a waste of time.  At work my primary annoyance with it is the people who get haughty with me when I tell them a place they can go but it's not easy to their liking (plus, I'm not paid to drive/explain things on behalf of our competitors).

Staples,33bht2,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE,2,Tue Apr 21 05:46:21 2015 UTC,"Well, best-by date is what is used to determine food that is kept or coded out, so regardless, it's the same deal."
Staples,33bht2,rawrzaurs,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:08:19 2015 UTC,"Best-by can still be eaten after a certain period, it is referring to the quality of the product, not safety.

Staples,33bht2,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"I understand the difference between expired and best-by date! I just mean, as far as Staples' policy is concerned, once it is a certain point beyond the best-by date, it's coded as being expired."

Staples,33bht2,drdokatz,2,Tue Apr 21 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"Many many companies do this. Usually they get some sort of reimbursement as long as the product is destroyed as to not damage their brand reputation due to expired/past best-by product. I don't agree with it, but...It's not like Staples is unique in any way concerning this.  That said, managers that let people take it home or just put it in the breakroom are the real MVP."

Staples,33al47,mr-octo_squid,2,Tue Apr 21 04:50:22 2015 UTC,"I think its more to do with the amount this job pays. If staples paid a semi decent living wage, I think their would be less bitching. But I do agree with OP, I am a IT major and Staples was the only job I could get at the time, and I always had to deal with customers questions along the lines of ""Why the hell did you choose not to be able to support yourself"" and it tended to get quite annoying.

The sole fact being that most people see retail workers; no matter what chain; as being uneducated.   I work in a town with a rather high college base. many people assume I go to the local college; I don't. I am self-taught and have been working in IT for close to three years. I've built servers and systems that would make anyone with a smidge of technolust weep with joy. I now work at staples and I enjoy most of my days. More often then not I get customers that ask ""do you know anything about these? probably not right?"" while looking at flash drives or other tech items. At first I was insulted but I grew a thicker skin. Resistance to lame customers comes, just try to treat them like you would want your mother to be treated. Best of wishes."
Staples,33al47,NiBlade,4,Tue Apr 21 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"I can tell you right now that you're going to get more than a few replies insinuating that you're a bit full of yourself, and need to humble up a bit. Me personally, I'm just going to chalk this up to you being new.  I was in a very similar situation when I started working at Staples some 11 months ago. I was accepted into college at 17 years old, and skipped my senior year of high school to go to a top-25 University a year early. On top of that, I was in their honors program, and moved clear across the country (before I was legally an adult mind you) all by myself, on a practically full financial aid package. I graduated with a four-year degree two months after my 21st birthday, and had many job opportunities in the city where my school was based, which just happens to be the second-biggest city in America. I turned them all down to move back home to a town where there are almost zero job opportunities for college grads, outside of a couple very specific fields.   Why, you ask? The truth of it is I came home to watch my mother die, and to be there for my 15-year old sister to help her pick up the pieces when that inevitable nightmare finally came to pass. I worked odd jobs, not getting very many hours, until I landed at Staples. I got to spend some happy last days with my mother, and then I was suddenly the glue holding my family together. In the blink of an eye, I ended up having to be a parent practically to a 15-year old girl who had just lost the person she loved the most in the world. I was the one standing in the room smelling the burning flesh when they cremated my mother. I was the one standing up at the memorial service eulogizing her. I was the one who held my grandma as she practically passed out in the church on that hot July day.   I don't regret my decision to come home, not even a little bit. It was a choice, I made it, and I'm willing to deal with the fallout. Part of that fallout was having to ""settle"" for a job at Staples, and, over my year with the company, I've gotten a lot of customers making comments very similar to the one you're complaining about.  As a cashier, you have to put things in perspective, and pick your battles. Based on what you described, it didn't seem like the customer was trying to be offensive. Since when did ""You deserve better,"" become an insult? Sure it lacks tact, but meh, tact is overrated. You'll deal with a LOT worse, and that's the stuff you should bitch about.  Most of all, if little stuff like this ticks you off, you're going to end up hating almost all of your customers, and that's going to affect your customer service skills. Be patient and kind with your customers. I like to think of my customers as if they were my grandma. They're probably not going to be super tech-savvy, and they're probably going to put their foot in their mouths. My grandma's said some borderline racist things to me in the past. They weren't directed at me personally, and I don't think they were meant in a mean-spirited way, but as a man of color, I did cringe a bit. But it didn't stop me from loving her and being patient and kind with her. You gotta treat customers the same way. And if they're total jerks, you have to learn how to either kill them with kindness, or step up your sarcasm game to Sensei-level, so you can lightly poke fun at them without their even noticing you're doing it.  If you've reached this far in the post, well, might as well keep reading. I've definitely had some frustrating moments in my year with Staples. But I've had some great experiences too. In less than a year, I've gone from Cashier to EasyTech to Certified Technician (in-store & on-site). I've made a lot of great friends out of fellow employees - most of them don't have degrees, but I don't think I'm any better than them just because I do. I've had the privilege of helping people who genuinely had no idea what they were doing as far as technology is concerned. And, first and foremost, I've had the pleasure of working with a great crew that stood by me during a really difficult time in my life. My GM gave me all the time I needed (during BTS, as a new employee, no less) when my mother passed. I was allowed to literally leave while ringing with no backup cashier when I got the call from the hospital. My GM even comped our family some funeral pamphlets from Copy. I'm not so naive as to believe that corporate is responsible for this caringness. But individual GMs and employees do such a great job of making more happen with less, and making the customers' lives, and each others' lives so much better and easier every day. I've had another job (full-time, well-paying) for about two months now, but I still work weekends at Staples, not because I need the money, but because I enjoy it most days, and because I'm loyal to my GM, my coworkers, and my store. It's hard to find good COTs in the small town I live in, so I'm sticking around til they can train up a guy to take over for me.  I came into the company about a year ago, and, I'll admit it, a part of me, like you, thought that the job wasn't good enough for me. Now, I wonder if I was good enough for it.   /endrant"

Staples,33azwo,TEEHEE_NYC87,3,Tue Apr 21 03:38:14 2015 UTC,The sell sheet is just a part of the staples redundancy machine. Its a stack of paper the SSM or whatever he is can point out to the DM.

Especially for a known re seller I would personally ceremoniously pull one out and place it on a clipboard and with purpose fill it out with the customer just to annoy them. If they bitch say ""I have to or I get a write up."" And on second thought I am sure that the sell sheet is more to cover your own ass so you can ""prove"" to your managers ""I am offering"""

I walk outside tell them he is getting it, run through the upgrades. total support etc Ect. when I think I've got them to a full bag I tell them ""give me one sec let me check on that laptop."" I go grab it off the rack, thank my manager and walk it to a register to ring them out myself.

He nodded to associates as he passed but had zero real interaction with us. The DM and GM showed him a well staffed store on a non busy day. Associates cleaning and straighten isles, pouncing on customers as soon as they came in, answering phone calls the second the announcement started, we looked great. Best part? It was all fake as as hell. Otis didn't know why we had SO MANY staff on for such a dead day. AM told me later that in less than 24 hours he was in the phone with the DM and insisted that she get personally involved with making schedules for the district because he could tell there was a problem. It added another phone call each week and the emailing of schedule to DM before they could finalize in the system. If there are any GMs here, please, for the love of God, let the higher ups see what your store is really like. What do you expect to happen if you show of a perfect utopia of a store? What change for the better do you think that will bring? I'm willing to bet if Ron Sargent or Demos walked into any store in my district on a random day they would start crying at how bad it was.

Staples,335eez,GeforcerFX,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:51:40 2015 UTC,I noticed someone OCing once in my store and I brought it up casually asking if there was a policy to my SSM. Out COT heard me and freaked out asking if I called the cops.  My SSM and I had to explain that open carry meant he was just carrying it in a holster outside his shirt. Our COT thought he was just walking around with a gun in his hand. Much laughs were had.  I looked it up after this. Officially Staples has no policy on firearms. Once an anti gun organization ambushed a GM and got him to put a no guns sign on the door. It went viral when the organization posted it to Facebook and corporate made him take it down.  Defer to your local laws
Staples,335eez,StapleApe,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"Illegal in Florida. If I were in a different state, I wouldn't really do much about an OC handgun. I pocket conceal carry (even at work) and sometimes it can be a hastle to carry my bigger pistols in the waist band if I'm just running to a store real quick. I'm a huge second amendment person, but I'd probably still ask the person to leave it in their vehicle if they had a shotgun or rifle. At that point you're just trying to show off or cause a ruckus."
Staples,335eez,exile0514,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:14:06 2015 UTC,"A tall skinny guy with long hair came into our store with an open hip carry once. It was definitely a glock, probably 9mm or .45 caliber. I just kinda stayed behind the tech counter and played with my pocket knife until he left.   I don't understand why some people open carry in department stores. It makes everyone uneasy and at worst can seriously scare people. I can understand a concealed carry just fine.  One time a guy who was carrying a 6 shot mini shotgun shell snub nose revolver got talking about his weapon somehow and he decided to take it out of his coat and show it off to me and the manager while we were at the tech counter. He took a shell out of the revolver and gave me a good look at the size and shape. Sure, we were talking about guns but as a retail employee if the guy I'm trying to sell to wants to talk about guns, I'll talk about guns. I said ""Sir you really shouldn't be un-holstering a sidearm in the middle of our store."" and he just told me to relax, but he did put it away. Honestly he's an asshole if you ask me. How am I to know that he isn't about to turn that thing on me in an instant? I could literally see the shells fully loaded and we're in broad daylight 12:00PM at a STAPLES. Dude, go to a gun range or a show or something if you want to brag about your big gun. Fuck off with that noise. Call me paranoid but I'm not taking chances when someone is literally holding a firearm in their hands three feet away from me. What if he's a psychopath who decided in that moment that he doesn't like my face and this is the time to unleash hell?"
Staples,335eez,Donutfreak,-2,Tue Apr 21 04:03:23 2015 UTC,"We had some of those crazies in our store once. I told the MOD I would be in the stockroom until they left because they made me feel uncomfortable. There really is no need to carry a rifle into an Office Supplies store, as we were not located in rural Arkansas or near any hunting grounds. I don't have a fundamental opposition to it, it's just that the people who tend to want to open carry ""just because"" are typically the kind of person who will use the weapon irresponsibly if there was ever a need for it. I can understand people wanting it for protection, but as far as I know there aren't any Staples stores in downtown Baghdad."

For example, if you buy an item from us for $100 and we offer a $20 instant rebate, the net price is $80. If another company’s price is $80 or more, we will not match the price.  Another example: If you buy an item from us for $159 and you have a $30 coupon, the net price is $129. If another company’s price is $125, your price match would be $4 off our net price of $129. Dollars-off coupons will be proportionally deducted from the prices of items in your order.   Edit: Taken directly from the staples website."

Staples,3339uq,exile0514,4,Mon Apr 20 03:30:14 2015 UTC,"You either get a price match OR a coupon, never both and whichever is lower.   You can match a manufacture coupon WITH a price match OR coupon because we get reimbursed by the manufacturer for the value + handling (assuming your cash office person is any good).   So basically. Staples = $100. Amazon = $50. Staples coupon = $10 off item. Manufacturer coupon = $10.   Price would be Amazon($50) - Manufacturer($10) for total of $40. Staples coupon not valid. I believe the only exception is dollar amounts off total if the transaction has at least 1 item with no coupon or price match; however, I'm not sure if the coupon'd item counts as part of the minimum amount or not. At this point I leave it up to the register."
Staples,3339uq,dan2872,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:33:28 2015 UTC,"Mostly, but for your scenario it would be price match to $60, coupon for $10 off and then manufacturers."

I'm not sure who is responsible for constructing the surveys at Staples, but they are crafted specially to leave as little room as possible for criticism due to the basic questions they ask. Team Supervisors, Assistant Managers, GM's should all be rated because even they need coaching too, and many of them tend to be oblivious to their faults.

Computers and cars aren't really that far off; the only major difference is computers last on average 3 years while a well maintained car car last up to 30.  Keyword there is well maintained.  People understand they need to service their car.    You need to service a PC in the same manner.    People understand they must pay $$ to have an inspection done.    You need to have your PC infected the same way.    People understand that while you can tow a boat with a minivan, you're either misinformed (or in stubborn denial), or you like replacing the transmission every year.    You need to buy the right PC for the job in the same way. You want to Game? Spend $1500+ on your PC. Just want to email? Buy cheap and replace every year.    People understand warranties on cars because they're $10-20K investments.    You need to think of your PC as an investment too. Back in the day, it definitely could be cheaper to have your tech friend fix it. Now? Everything is so damn tiny that even I buy warranties on laptops. And I'm our stores backup tech and 10yr+ friend and family computer guy.    I could go on and write a book. Actually....

I don't know how many write-ups they're allowed for the same thing like this - I certainly didn't want to say a damn thing during one of my GM's rare moments of clarity over how fucked this company really is - but I know he's worried about it."
Staples,331n1n,BubbleWrapLampShade,2,Sat Apr 18 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"After your 3rd write up, you can be fired for whatever reason. My guess would be if someone ends up over 30 hours for the year or if you GM is being disobedient or has a shitty inventory."

Staples,331n1n,BallsInYourWalls,1 point,Sun Apr 19 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on how well the DM likes the GM. Mine was written up due to poor store conditions because he went to an aisle and there was a product that was not pushed to the edge of the shelf, but when you go to his favorite GM's store, there is dirt and dust everywhere and it's rarely ever faced as well but he hasn't been written up for it."
Staples,331n1n,DaBidnessman,5,Mon Apr 20 01:25:44 2015 UTC,This is why I'm really scarred despite my GM telling me it's ok. She has me and another associate schedule for 36 and 37.5 hours respectively. While I like the hours I've already broke this stupid 25 hour rule twice and part of me just doesn't care what the GM or the DM say.
Staples,331n1n,TankeBuster,5,Sun Apr 19 01:55:18 2015 UTC,"You can't get a write up for that, you're just following schedule. The write up is for people who have like 23 hours scheduled but get busy that week and end the pay period at 25.2 hours. Because as my gm has said, you're responsible for watching your hours. They don't care if every customer is stopping you along the way, you do not go over."

Staples,331n1n,NeoTheTech,0,Sat Apr 18 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yep. I don't know if it's company-wide or just my store, but I did hear whispers that it was being suspended for this week as part of ""Finish Strong"" or something like that. But starting next week, it's back in effect."
Staples,331n1n,badfordabidness,8,Sat Apr 18 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"Another gimmick? I have an idea for one that will help. Are you listening  Framingham?? How bout a ""staff adequately/don't screw employees"" initiative. Its very simple you staff your stores adequately and dont screw your employees. This will make employees care about  their jobs and improve customer satisfaction. Thats right Let's make more ""Customer/Employee Satisfaction"" happen."
Staples,331n1n,badfordabidness,2,Sat Apr 18 23:26:52 2015 UTC,"Amen! The thing about Obamacare (and I'm going to be very apolitical about this, as I'm required to by the Hatch Act) is that the Healthcare employer mandate kicks in when you hit 30+ hours a week, not 25+. Staples could and probably INTENDS to get us a LOT closer to a 30 hour AVERAGE by the end of the year. $20 says BTS rolls around and you'll see the 25 hour limit raised to 30 or 32 - whatever they can get away with under the guise of ""limited seasonal fluctuations in hours"" or whatever legal loophole they'll use.   But that just doesn't cut it for employees. Being in a unionized workplace (not at Staples, lol) has taught me that there are many, many work factors which have value to employees, and they aren't just limited to pay or even work conditions. The ability to take paid sick, personal, and vacation days whenever you need with no blackouts, for instance. The ability to have a regular, predictable work schedule and weekends (or at least every other weekend) off. The ability to work a 37.5 hour week every week, and know what days & shifts you'll be working months in advance, rather than being ""dynamically scheduled"" to work on a religious holiday like Easter with a week's notice. The ability to be able to have an hour lunch and two 15's every day, not just on paper, but in real life. The ability to have an organization that will back you up and prevent you from being fired for literally no effing reason under bullshit ""at will"" employment laws.  Flexing up employee hours to a small extent was acceptable back when this was a job you could reliably count on for 30 hours/wk, even during the slow months. But when new employees sign up for a 10-15/hour week job, and then get mandatorily flexed to 30 hours/week during BTS and Christmas seasons, they're going to be like ""WTF, I signed up for a fifteen hour a week job. I have another job with a set schedule and kids to take care of, I can't have you flexing me to 30 hrs/wk on a week's notice. I didn't sign up for this shit."" To which over-stressed GMs will probably trot out the tired ""fine, then go work at Wal-Mart"" trope.  PS: Has anyone noticed that Wal-Mart's new minimum wage policy means most of their employees are actually starting out at HIGHER pay rates than Staples FE/OS associates? (at least in states with a $7.25/hour statutory min wage).   PPS: Sorry I dropped the ""U"" word, Otis. I know they're bad for bidness, and that's why you indoctrinated all of us with so many training videos that borderline-violated worker intimidation laws. My apologies to da bidness, and your and Ron's bonuses."

Staples,32z58y,badfordabidness,0,Fri Apr 17 23:47:01 2015 UTC,"It seems like a pretty damn good deal to me on Android tablets.  On iPads, AppleCare+ all day. You already have the ""Find My iDevice"" app, and AppleCare+ includes phone and Apple Store support.  Those are also two of the more reasonably priced services Staples offers. $30 is a steal. Even the $99 AppleCare+ is a steal, when you consider it includes low-deductible AD ESP and no-deductible MF ESP. And it's for two years. My Tech Sales Supervisor tried to tell me it was for one year only the other day. RIGHT. AFTER. HE. DID. HIS. APPLE TRAININGS. I laughed in his f**king face.  Full Disclosure: My supervisor has commented on this feed. He knows who I am.  Fuller Disclosure: I make only a small fraction of my income from Staples, and have no reason to lie for the company's benefit, or my supervisor's. I probably make more money than anyone in my store except the GM, and could easily tell Staples to go screw itself at any time. So when I say I endorse tablet Total Support, it's because it's a good deal, not because it's good for da bidness. That is, until next year, when we've all become proficient at selling it, and corporate yells at us for selling it too much because it was ""never meant to be sold without a $99 MATRIX Premier Tablet Setup"" and has thus ruined the company's margins."

In the stores I've worked in, if you can demonstrate that you know your stuff, express an interest, and there's space to move you then you'll be moved.  Keep in mind however, that most of the EasyTech side is selling.  Except in rarer and rarer cases, we're no longer here to fix computers.  We're expected to hook the computers up to Matrix and then be back on the floor selling.  As a cashier, if you can consistently sell Squaretrade warranties, you'll attract more attention as a viable candidate for EasyTech."

Really? You couldn't have looked at the printer for all of 5 seconds to get the cartridge number? You have to literally call her while you're in the isle with me and put her on speaker so that I can ask her to open the printer?  Some people don't deserve to have nice equipment like this. Also it's almost impossible to explain to people why ink is expensive. Now a days I just say ""Look, printing is expensive unless you have a laser printer. Inkjet printers are at least 10x more expensive per page. Deal with it.""  When it comes to digital receipts the only reason we're pushing them is for advertising. Staples doesn't care about the paper they save, it's all about getting people back in the store. I literally don't let my customers have a paper copy of their receipt unless they specifically ask for one. I'll say ""Can I e-mail you your receipt today instead of wasting trees?"". That forces them to really think about whether or not they need a paper copy. Most people have this retarded aversion to technology and a ""Digital"" receipt will put them on edge. If I tell them they are literally killing forests by not accepting my ""e-Mail"" receipt, they are an asshole. It's really that simple. Managers on the other hand don't give a shit about how you do it, they just threaten to performance review everybody until we get better numbers. My store usually hovers around 25% digital simply because our cashiers are slightly stupid. It would be better if management actually trained people but here we go again on one of my rants..."

Staples,32v4od,CaptainNeedleMouse,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:34:04 2015 UTC,"Be on the floor when you're needed, be productive when you're not, it's that simple. Prime time is garbage and designed so people don't have to wait the extra 40 seconds for you to walk out of the warehouse. If you have nazi managers that INSIST on you doing absolutely fucking nothing then it's not your fault they can't run their business correctly -- they want to micromanage you THAT HARD then you should realize you have no control over any positive or negative outcome, therefore it's not worth it to worry -- as long as you've tried and done everything you could, let the pieces fall into place the best they can."
Staples,32v4od,liquidpixel,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:18:44 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, Prime Time...aka We know we don't give you enough staffing and its getting hard when we get all these comments from the customer that our store is understaffed. So we are going to try to trick the customers into thinking we give a damn by taking people off doing their jobs and putting them on the floor. Oh and we'll still expect you workers to get the work done even though we are cutting 4 hours from the time that you can do that.   They say during Primetime, associates should be free of distractions so they make help the customer. Well as a Tech, I need adequate staffing to happen so that I am free of distractions and therefore can help the customer with their computer."

The lowest paid employees in my warehouse right now are all full time, and make 13.00.  Once they start hiring seasonals through a temp agency the lowest will be 12.00.  That's more than most of the supervisors at Staples make.  And that's not including having much better health care options, at a much better price than Staples offered.  Plus other compensation bonuses/vesting stock options.

Staples,32n6jc,Bill_Money,3,Wed Apr 15 03:22:40 2015 UTC,I am putting in applications as we speak.
Staples,32n6jc,tswaves,5,Wed Apr 15 03:48:27 2015 UTC,"My supers belittle me, tell me I need to think, are condescending and once told me, ""You're just like my kid. It annoys me sometimes.""  I'm starting to feel abused. I know tough managers, but for $9/hr I am having my self-esteem ripped out.   ""You need to know this."" Every 10 minutes."
Staples,32n6jc,douglasr007,2,Wed Apr 15 04:21:40 2015 UTC,"and it makes me go ""How about you show me how it's done while you're over here at CPC for me instead of belittling me?""  If they go ""you're replaceable"" then I simply reply with ""So are you. Now stop trying to be narcissistic and just fucking help me since I try to help you out in any arguments with customers. I understand our goals."""
Staples,32n6jc,tswaves,3,Thu Apr 16 18:14:29 2015 UTC,I've started standing up and holding my integrity. I'm not going to feel worthless over $115 week.
Staples,32n6jc,douglasr007,3,Thu Apr 16 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"but I seriously put managers in their place when they do shit like that  Belittling other associates doesn't help the problem at all and you're just going to make people quit. I've done it to be my old managers and team supervisors. When they get off tangent about issues I told them, ""Why am I in the office? What was the exact reason?"" and it usually brings them back on track because we can complain all day and night about little things that have no effect to the present. I'm so glad I was able to transfer out of my old store. A little backbone goes a long way and I usually try to present a neutral manner to it since my criticism is more valid than bitching."
Staples,32n6jc,venturer95,3,Thu Apr 16 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"That kind of talking back shouldn't be tolerated.   Also, I can't tell you how many times I have to say ""I'm with a customer"" before people actually understand I'm busy, lol."

Staples,32n6jc,captaincook27,3,Wed Apr 15 03:59:47 2015 UTC,"Same! I can't be helping the cpc line, ups line, self serve area and answering the phone. The phone is my last priority because the customer isn't in the store. I'm gonna get through all the customers in store first and if the other associates don't want to hear the ""xxx has call holding"" then they need to suck it up and either help with customers or answer the damn phone."
Staples,32n6jc,DirtyNunchucks,3,Wed Apr 15 12:58:15 2015 UTC,"Haha, calling over the radio for an ET associate. I am the only ET associate when I work. :("
Staples,32n6jc,devlan2003,2,Wed Apr 15 16:32:16 2015 UTC,"I was the lead tech and right before I left staples last year my manager was constantly on me for not multitasking while talking to a customer at the bench.  He wanted me to work on computers while I was making sales/consulting/etc and he referred to it as ""idle hands"" if I didn't.  Not only does this appear incredibly rude to the customer but neither thing gets my full attention.  I wouldn't be surprised if they get these ideas from corporate but this was the last straw and I do not regret leaving."
Staples,32n6jc,DaBidnessman,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:59:26 2015 UTC,"That's something that you listen to, nod your head and then ignore. When I had to cover for the cashier there would often be a person at checkout, one needing to ask questions and then someone calling on the phone. I wasn't going to be rude and ignore people so I helped people in the order in which they appeared. If anyone ever asked why I didn't answer the phone I would just ask ""what were you doing? You can't answer the phone?"" because half the time they were just looking busy rather than actually being busy."
Staples,32n6jc,GoodForBidness,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:02:10 2015 UTC,My GM and AM both do similar things to me. They'll come up to the bench and ask the customer that they know im helping if they have been helped and then totally ignore the customer they KNOW needs help. So i have come to terms with the fact that i am forced to multitask. While doing intakes i will usually take phone calls and even help other customers with small stuff like ink. I have only rarely had the original customer get mad. Most customers are sympathetic when they see how FEW people we have staffed every day. The only time it becomes a problem is when someone needs help in printers (which is about every 5 effing minutes). And of course my OS team is about as technologically savvy as a box of rocks so they cant even answer the simplest question. What pisses me off the most is when my IA and OS team cant even help someone in shredders! (sorry for the rant).

In my store that involves helping multiple customers, keeping thieves away, connecting computers to the Matrix, cashiering, and picking up phones. If you fail at one while you do all of them at the same time you have failed at it all."
Staples,32n6jc,EZtechDream,2,Wed Apr 15 05:50:13 2015 UTC,"of course when you are not busy the machines you intake will connect to the matrix right away. If its busy and your manager is pressuring you to get them on the matrix (while your multitasking), its one of those computers that needs PE mode, the usb to ethernet adapter and an act of God to connect!"

I work there one day a week and am left working on computers that sat for 1-2 weeks with no progress, and deal with angry customers, and even the corporate complaints!

Staples,32m38y,UnnamedStaplesDrone,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:21:35 2015 UTC,Any idea what could have caused it? We've had nothing but great feedback from customers. Only thing I can think of is so many people having total support or some variant that aren't having as many issues as they used to.

Staples,32m38y,badfordabidness,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:02:40 2015 UTC,"No clue here really. It's a little funny though, our tsat is way up and our dollars are way down. We prefer the other way around with up to a 5 day turn around to work on a lot of computers."
Staples,32m38y,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:32:53 2015 UTC,Our TSAT is in the gutter. Which is frustrating because it's all 5's and 4's. We are only averaging 5-8 people taking the surveys so our percentages are super wonky.
Staples,32m38y,LinuxVersion,2,Thu Apr 16 02:33:12 2015 UTC,"IMHO, it's standard actuarial practice to not draw statistically significant conclusions when sample size (n) < 30. So if there are less than 30 in a particular month, the proper conclusion could only be drawn from a rolling or moving average. If we had a 90-day moving average on TSAT (or for that matter, CSAT), it'd be far easier to isolate problem areas, and these bogus spikes and dips wouldn't occur. I see our GM trying to look at the metrics from that angle, but really, Staples metrics are just inherently flawed in design.  Best practice would be to reach out to a random sample of customers each week, record responses by week (rather than by month), give three star ratings a weight of 1, four star ratings a weight of 2, and five star ratings a weight of 3, and then compile a 12-week moving percentage based off the above weights.  Example: In the last twelve weeks, there have been 50 recorded customer ratings for TSAT. Maximum attainable points would be 50 * 3 (all 5 star ratings), which would be 150 points. Let's say we got 30 5's and 20 4's. Under the old systems that'd be a score of 30/50 = 60% - the same as if we got 30 5's and 20 1's. Under my new system, we'd have a score of 130/150 = 85% ish. The hypothetical store that got 30 5's and 20 1's would meanwhile still get a 60%. Thus, the new metric clearly helps further differentiate between a good store and a bad store, which is kinda the whole fucking actual point of metrics anyway. And the moving-average method would also help to smoothe out the occasional outlier, which are statistically irrelevant anyway.   But... This is Staples. So fuck the whole idea of scientifically-sound metrics. After all, I've repeatedly heard a certain sales associate GUARANTEEING customers that adding a PPC Setup (and thus getting 20% off a combined cost of $400) would cost EXACTLY the same thing as buying SQ+VS for $300. Oh, and I've seen corporate flip out out of genuine surprise when a $100 off tablets Reg priced $499+ caused the price of a $300 iPad to drop to $200. So math isn't exactly this company's strong suit."

One of the major problems Staples has is that it promotes really young people to be managers, which is good from a business standpoint because they are typically too stupid to know that their pay is not commensurate with the demands of the job. However it can be incredibly frustrating to work with people who just barely graduated high school and think they're some big shot because they're a manager.   I've worked retail in between school summer breaks and while waiting to get into graduate programs and had a manager like that once. He didn't know I had a Masters degree in neuroscience, so he liked to talk to me like I was stupid because he was younger than me and was my supervisor. One day he got a little too pissy so I told him about my education and said ""I work in retail because I choose to, you work in retail because you have to--don't ever forget that"". His lil face sure did get red, but I lol'ed about it all day. Sometimes you just have to wait for a really good moment to tell someone to go fuck themselves =)  Yes, I know I can be cunty."

Staples,32i3gq,figjam13,2,Tue Apr 14 13:27:36 2015 UTC,"Almost 5 years with the company on the Tech Sales side of the store. Started as your regular Technology Sales Associate. Filled in on/off as Backup Technician for the $1 premium. Became full time Technician with a raise above the $1 premium plus FT benefits. Swiss Army Knife position between Sales and Technician keeping full time and benefits. Promoted to Technology Consultant and now ready to move on as I've stopped learning anything new and or useful.  Each promotion / yearly review has been positive, save for the last due to the way everything is changing in retail, and I truly love my job assisting people and small businesses being able to solve problems and find solutions. But I think it's time to move on to a more privatized company that pays what my expertise is worth, and gives me more free time without sapping my life energy away.  If anyone wants me to post actual wages I can, but I figured not because Canadian minimum wage starts at $10.25 an hour."

Not that things are going well before it. We've already had to out a bunch of missing items due to rampant theft.

Evidently these people don't know how to write 6 numbers on a box, because they mislabeled MANY boxes, and the quantities were nonsensical. That Arc hole puncher does not come 12 to a box. I didn't know who these people were so I asked the DM if they were new to Staples and she said no lol Oops.  So between GM's and Assistant managers who don't know how to write 6 numbers on a box, and inventory takers who don't know how to count our inventory was fun."

The store I started at closed in July and when we were doing our closing inventory, the guys we had were disastrous. We had to have them recount one section at least 3 times before we had their team manager recount it another 3 times because none of them could count.  It depends on the people they have doing the counting. The initial team they sent us didn't do a really good job and our GM told the manager ""Look, your guys can't count and you're not doing your job to the level that Staples is expecting. Get me another crew or I'm sending all of you home now."" So they pulled a crew off of another inventory up in Maine and drove them down. Got a bunch of decent ones from there and it was smooth sailing from that point.  Good thing I dodged inventory at my new store before I quit when I got married..."

Staples,32dl4w,TEEHEE_NYC87,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:12:20 2015 UTC,Just keep a close eye on how they are counting the items. If they instructions well then just point out to them when they may be counting items that are different from the SKU they scanned. Aside from that there really isn't much to it.

Staples,32eb1e,BadForBidness,3,Mon Apr 13 20:25:41 2015 UTC,"I once had a customer come and buy all of my store's inventory of popcorn tins for a church deal.  They needed more so I found a store that had enough to get them all set.  I called the manager to confirm they had the correct amount (was also 100% of their inventory) and he flipped out on me and told me if the customer bought them all he would have none for other customers.  This concept has to be the craziest thing I've ever heard.  If a person came in today and offered to buy my whole store I would gladly sell every single item.  We are only here to sell inventory, why on earth would we conserve it to ensure the next customer is satisfied.   That being said, if there's a quantity limit, I'm sure the GM partnered with the DM.  Ultimately, I know it was probably painful for the other customers but hopefully the GM and DM came up with a plan to refill quickly (borrow from another store, overnight from warehouse, something) and also staffed an associate to the kiosk to help other customers."

With that being said, I have found that they will use every weakness in the rules of retail to obtain the lowest price for a product, from trying to double dip on price matching and coupons, bullying associates and managers to force them to just override a price then suffer a customer complaint (which suck if you've ever had to deal with them....), to even outright lying or thievery to just get their way.   In my town there's a reseller who, while we've banned him from our store, somehow owns a small warehouse and has a small fleet of Cadillac suvs with his business name on them."

I assumed i wouldn't get the full story of reselling but this seemed like the place to ask as the employees are the ones who see this happen first hand.    Are there any examples of this behavior in particular that stand out to you that you or your friends have witnessed? If so could you describe them?   (sorry this last bit may not make much sense, but it explains why im asking.) I'm trying to derive an answer to a question, weather or not these individuals employ Social Engineering techniques, and if so whether they are basic subconscious acts or complex and specifically crafted SE to take advantage of Sales Staff / Managers."
Staples,32ce5d,vayneblade,10,Sun Apr 12 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"I can think of an example that happened very recently. If you frequent this sub, you'll have seen a post about a Starbucks Verisimo coffee maker that was causing some problems and a very large amount of traffic from resellers.  So around 30 or so minutes before we close, a woman and her husband come in and ask if we have any of the item, so I go looking and we didn't have any on the shelf, but I found several out back. So I bring one up and they're all happy and ask if I have any more. First red flag. (Its a coffee maker, who buys more than one?) So I say that we have a few more, and she immediately responds that she'll take them all. NOW I'm seriously suspicious, but I bring all four that we have up to our ring out to see where the hiccup is going to be.  So I start ringing them up (120$ a pop) and she says that they're cheaper on the website and I should price match them. So I find that it is true, they are on sale for only 60$ online and I am about to do the match at the register and she say ""Oh and I have a coupon to use.""  Oh, there's the trick. Having been in this business for almost ten years, I know what is allowed and what is not very well, so I respond that I can either do the price match or use her coupon, but not both. Note: The coupon was a 60$ off the Verisimo coffee maker and would have made the thing free basically.  She explodes. Claiming others stores do it, that she has authorization from corporate, and that she did it just the other day. Its usually pretty jarring to have such an unexpected amount of hostility thrown at your face but my position has lead me to have many of these interactions over the years so I was used to it. I responded that unfortunately it was against our policies to do both. She then asked asked if there was a manager, which I replied that I was the manager (I am, I promise). Then she tried to ask if there was a general manager higher than me they could talk to, which I said that I was the manager on that night. I then offered to call our Regional LP guy to check, which she said to do that and I did, and of course, I was right. He said one or the other, not both.  She decided to hop on her phone and try calling our customer service to see if they could reach someone higher up who would authorize the sale. While she was doing that, her very quiet husband and I got to talking (turns out we were both Ravens fans) and after a few minutes, the wife hangs up and tells the husband they were leaving in a very disgusted tone. As they were leaving, the husband shrugged and and off-handedly said that they were just going to get them for free and resell them. Then the wife turned and screamed that she was going to give us the worst yelp review ever.  So to sum up: Double dipping on deals, bullying, and threats. Yay, fun."
Staples,32ce5d,douglasr007,3,Sun Apr 12 17:47:10 2015 UTC,Yelp isn't for retail haha  Wow. People.
Staples,32ce5d,vayneblade,2,Sun Apr 12 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"Yup. My exact reaction after she left. To be honest, hardly the worst I've ever had. Like the guy who tried to choke me out because of a laptop price. Or the old guy who carried poop around in a bag around the store. Or the old lady who terrorizes my CPC and they tell horror stories about her the frighten the new associates. And many, MANY, more.  I should write a book....."

Staples,32ce5d,elentirion,-3,Mon Apr 13 01:44:22 2015 UTC,The policy in my store is that a price match changes the price and is then treated as if it was normal.    So they can still use a coupon if it on that specific product or a general x off one item and such.    To be fair that is a pretty ridiculous deal  If it was a normal customer pulling it off I would smile as I gave them the receipt for 0.00 because all coupons are before tax xD  In her case would have given her one of them at the 0.00 the others at 60 (the coupon probably limits itself to one per customer and even if it didn't we would still not let our entire stock go on copies of coupons.)   assuming she did not turn in to a rabid animal.
Staples,32ce5d,NiBlade,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:58:19 2015 UTC,interesting that this policy changes between stores. unfortunately its probably the source of a lot of hostility at other branches.  thanks for your input!

Staples,32ce5d,katyrzana,5,Sun Apr 12 20:34:13 2015 UTC,Most of the resellers I know are not shady. They just know how to use our system most effectively.    I have never seen one trying to pass off a fake card.    Most of the gift cards they have are staples branded visa gift cards from our rebates.    As far as I know it is hard to fake a gift card.  They are either bought and activated or they aren't.  Not much wiggle room  How ever they get them is not my concern.  If they work they are good.    If it is an actual credit card we check ID when we feel we need to.  But with a reseller I have seen many times it is sort of pointless to suspect that they are trying to pass off a fake card.    As far as social engineering goes they are not that good at it beyond knowing are policies and how lenient each stores managers are when it comes do discretionary decisions.    It is hard to not be noticed as a reseller when you buy a new computer every few weeks with no peripherals ever and also have a hand full of coupons and notes detailing the order of operations for our stores coupon system and such.    If any one is good at social engineering than well you don't know of it xD  If they are trying to berate and bully their way through the system they are not very good at there job.    I don't get commission I have no reason to begrudge them the sale.  If they are polite I have no reason to not give them the sale.  Our policies are very geared towards making the customer happy.  But it is also our policy that our employees don't have to suffer abuse.  Once a customer is difficult we call a manager and let them take it from there.  In my store our managers don't take kindly to abuse and will be strict on policy that is often relaxed normally.    Basically if a customer is being polite and the computer gives them the option to override the rejection of a coupon they will do it.    The only time I got really annoyed was when a guy bought a computer used coupons and such   Then in a separate transaction bought a kuregg at full price with a selection of kcups  The second transaction could have been part of the first and would have helped our numbers  Any questions?

Staples,3298kn,StapleApe,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:50:11 2015 UTC,"Staples titles are a fucking headache. Some positions I've never seen in my store.  EasyTech/Tech Center Expert is the Tech Center/Services Supervisor. Full time position. Is supposed to drive tech sales and supervise the certified techs. That's my current position except I have nobody to supervise and do 100% of the tech work by myself, which is why I'm quitting because I'm fed up with not only leading an understaffed department, but being the understaffed department.  Certified Tech is ""technically"" any EasyTech who's passed the certification test on the hub. There's a title change, but it's not a pay raise. Hell, we have a tech certified OS guy.  I think Tech Lead/Senior Tech is a slight pay increase for the most knowledgable in the department but I can't be sure of this as I've never actually met one or seen the job description. I can't get anyone hired who qualifies for certified tech, much less senior."

You are free to fill out an application and seek employment, but do not ask me for ""what you pay/the discount you guys get/arbitrary discounts"". That is offensive and I would not demand your perks because I don't work your job. Don't try to take mine. You haven't earned them.   Ink is like milk. Please, ask me before you open it. You wouldn't open milk in the store and not buy it - we can't resell open ink. It's damaged goods. I can help you find your ink, but please, if you open it, you're no better than the thieves are because you've basically stolen from us. Watch your children. As much as I enjoy stocking calculators because it occupies time, after getting it immaculate during BTS, I do not appreciate you letting your four year old run rampant and destroy my work.   Additionally, Staples can be a dangerous place for unsupervised children. I would like to emphasize I am NOT watching your child. I have work to do. I am not paid as a babysitter and that is not the job I applied for.  If you don't attend your children, I won't be, and they can fall off ladders, pull things down on themselves, and potentially cause themselves severe injury using normal workplace hazards.  You can read the sign that says ""No customers on ladder - ask associate for assistance."" your kids cannot. Basically, watch your children, because I'm not, and they CAN AND WILL INJURE THEMSELVES, perhaps severely.   If you do not speak an official language comfortably, please feel free to ask if we have anyone who can help you in your language. Many stores are relatively multilingual. If not, please have a child or someone fluent write down what you would like if it is a complex item, so that I can help you find it.

Small things when you hit rewards it pops up fast. But the major stuff, like when you hit total, is still painfully slow.   I still dont understand why Staples forces the customer to wait untill the end to be able to slide their card. Almost every other retailer lets them do it early.   Or why there has to be a separate option for rewards. At CVS they are able to scan the card at any time.  Why can't we?"
Staples,3243vi,Windryy,3,Fri Apr 10 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"We got our new registers just before Black Friday last year, and they can be fast if corporate allows them to be.

It's the script kiddies adding checks and prompts in that brief period between scanning and payment."

I should be able to buy a tablet/computer/printer without getting dirty looks and being attacked for not buying anything with them.  It is not my responsibility to support store metrics with my OWN wallet. I know where to get literally everything I need from the store at 85% less than I'd pay even with my discount considered.  Why in hell would I buy a TN 450 with the printer when it's $24.50 online? Why would I get cases and screen protectors and things when I can source them for $20?"

Why is having a few large sales better than many more small sales? Dont get me wrong. I understand the reason why these categories are being tracked, but judging an associate's numbers based off of this is just stupid. For example, I had a customer last week that was looking for a new printer. We finalized on the HP 8610, which was on sale for $99. He went for the replacement plan on it, hell, even bought an entire case of simply paper. He was telling me about how he's opening up a business across the street from us, so he'd be coming here to get more ink. So to try and save him some money ($8), and I showed him the 950/951 combo pack instead of buying everything individually.  My GM told me I should've sold the ink separate. Why? My ASP is going to take a hit because I could've sold it as 4 attachments instead of 1. That's just stupid.."

On his first computer sale, he got a class attach of 3 or 4 (ESP, Mouse, Bag, and a usb key i think).  Our GM says, ""well, that's not too bad, but what about the setup?""  Which I overheard, and interrupted ""He talked with the customers for almost 20 minutes, the guy happens to be an IT professional, and never would've gone for the setup.  He did a damn good job about getting what he did get, and was able to talk them into getting the ESP, mentioning all its good points.

My option would've been to sell a cheaper computer, but a cheaper computer would not have worked for what the customer needed to do. Do they care? No.  That's what I hate most about the metrics - Management is ridden hard for it, and that comes down the chain to the grunt workers. Management always acts like there is never a reason you couldn't get ASP and it pisses me off. There isn't always magically a cheaper computer they could get. There isn't always magically enough money. There isn't always a possibility of selling a 3 year ESP to some guy from Senegal who is here on vacation.  I've had probably three IT guys I've sold to and I've gotten in trouble over every single one because naturally they didn't buy the setups and already had plenty of the other gear, as any self-respecting IT guy would.

Staples,322jru,TheLonelyPotato-,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that managers at Staples are always the ones bitching about metrics, but typically are the absolute worst at meeting them themselves. Instead of criticizing the way an associate approaches a customer about a sale, why not demonstrate an effective strategy instead? A good manager will do this, because it is constructive criticism. A bad manager will only offer criticism without offering a constructive alternative that they themselves employ effectively. If your manager never appears on the list of people who sell ESP, or consistently ranks on the bottom, then anything they say regarding sales could probably be safely ignored or nod your head to placate them and then just disregard them later."
Staples,322jru,operacarmen,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is in reality, they can easily sell to the office supply side of the store without much difficulty, and every manager I've worked with has always been willing to take a customer themselves to that side of the store.  But it's a whole different ball game when it comes to the technology/furniture side of the store.  Any manager can easily list off exactly what an ESP, Setup or FPP will get you (sorry if i'm using older terms here, I haven't been employed with staples in 4 years).  They'll tell you that your covered for this, not covered for that, and that can be quite helpful.    But when it comes to technology related products, most managers knowledge is down right HORRIBLE.  You can tell this because the MOMENT a customer asks for help in these sections, they are passed off to a tech associate before you can even bat an eyelash.  I've only had 1 manager that was even interested in learning about the technology products, which was AMAZING, as I could impart my knowledge very readily into him, and he would retain it and be able to ask intelligent questions about it.  Working with him was great, as he would manage to get as many setups as some of our better part-time tech associates, but when he got to the finish line, he would find either the associate who had the least amount of setups, explain to him everything that they talked about, and let them finish it, or if the customers had more questions, he'd bring them to me (being the resident technician), and I'd seal the deal.  All my other managers would barely scratch the surface of any technology related products, instead if they're forced to take a customer to them, they'd do the ""read from the item card faster than the customer can ask you"" approach.    All in all, I think it mainly came down to interests, and a lot of managers really aren't interested in the nitty-gritty details of the products.  Either that, or they consider the work below them (which thankfully I've only met one or two managers that were that pompous).  I think most managers have forgotten most of their selling techniques to learn management techniques... which is horrible and bad for bidness."

One day, she gathered all the associates together to talk about counterfeit bills and said, in a very condescending tone ""you can easily spot a counterfeit $100 if the imprint of Thomas Jefferson's face is not the same on the front as it is on the back"". I said ""umm, that's not Thomas Jefferson. It's Benjamin Franklin, see under the face, where it says Benjamin Franklin"".  Interestingly enough, we became friends after that.

I do get a lot of the lower end traffic to sell to - so my ASP is terrible, and furthermore, the stress I have in each sale to try and meet metrics hurts my credibility. I'm sure I wear it on my face - I'm not good at hiding things.  I can talk to people and get them to open up, but I'm sure they tune into the tension long before that point. The odd time I'm having a good day and feel totally at home? I easily pull of great sales. The majority, however, is me trying to pull up metrics that keep falling lower.

The thing that attracted me to Staples in the first place was the company values, values which I have come to realize are made up and ignored at all levels of the company."
Staples,322jru,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,3,Fri Apr 10 04:35:18 2015 UTC,This. So much this. I was instilled those values when I came to the company and helped open my store. And just seeing them pissed away makes me so angry.

Staples,322jru,spuzmonj,3,Fri Apr 10 13:30:16 2015 UTC,"As a staples GM, allow me to respond to you point by point.  -Sales Goals  It's evident to me that your GM/SM haven't spoken with you much about the business we're in.  If they did, I am quite sure you would understand the importance and necessity of selling goals.  My store did almost $200,000 in laptop sales last year.  Care to guess how much profit that brought?  How about -$10,000.  That's right, we lose money on laptop sales.  We make up this profit loss by selling customers items they will benefit from that deliver profit.  Have you ever carried a laptop around without a bag/case?  What, do you just dangle the cord over your neck?  I buy Squaretrade on pretty much anything I can.  I have always gotten excellent service from them, including multiple Ecards for products that have been damaged or stopped working.    That being said the way that goals and expectations are delivered to associates is highly dependent on the GM. Keep in mind that if you, an associate, are feeling pressure - we, the management, are getting a crapload more pressure from above to deliver.  And guess what, we don't have 1 or 2 things to deliver on, we must deliver on everything.  That means we need to trust that you are going to deliver on your portion.    I cannot stress enough, if you - an associate - would just deliver a quality pitch to every customer every time our woes would be over.  But when associates choose which customers to ask and make decisions for the customer, Staples -and rightly you- lose.   You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.  -know when to task  Really?  You talk about the labor model like your GM has complete control.  We have a labor budget to meet and that unfortunately means we need to prioritize our labor based on our customer traffic.  There are slight changes GMs can make to scheduling that can increase effectiveness in stores - but that's really up to that GM and possibly their DM to determine and act upon.  That being said, when associates get assignments if they are handled with a sense of urgency they can move on to other things, quickly.    -associate dress code  I clearly hope you understand that dress code is mandated by corporate.  I have heard of districts doing pilots (tests) of various dress codes.  Believe me the company understands the need to evolve, but we also need to ensure that our customers can consistently identify associates in your store.  And that means also being able to identify associates in the next store, too.  If associates and teams truly created an environment of customer ""greeting"" (ie, GrOW) things like this could be more readily considered.  -store chemistry  Keep in mind the management is constantly having to change and adapt to new store structures.  We did this in 2013, and again in 2015.  We've had to change with the 25 hour pt max.  That means most stores right now are in adaptation phases.  When things are better figured out chemistry should become more apparent, but keep in mind that chemistry is also highly related to the GM and the environment he/she are trying to establish.  -get to know your associates  Not only do I agree with this, the company has mandated practices to improve ASAT that encourage behaviors that engage the GM with associates.    However, some of the things you are asking for are very unrealistic.   I work a 45+ hour week with a 1,5-2 hour commute daily.  I love my staples family but when I'm off I need to attend to my own family.  It's important that I do rapport and relationship building activities within the store but very unlikely I would go out for drinks with associates.   Likewise, you say ""buy a meal"". ""Give a gift card"".  Who's money are you spending?  You do realize that when GMs do things like that they spend out of pocket.  I have done things like that before for my team, but it's a very uhh... For lack of better words ""selfish"" thing for you to expect the GM to spend their money on you.    If you want to drive more store events, I highly recommend you find what contests are going on that help contribute to the store associate fund and drive success in those in your store.  Last year we earned enough to go on a store wide bowling outing, as well as several cakes/food dates throughout the year.  But it's entirely contingent on the store creating associate funds.  -stop nagging  Own your responsibilities.  Communicate when and why you can't own them.  Work with your GM or leadership to find better ways of managing your time and goals if you are struggling.  And keep in mind that for everything we nag you about we are being nagged 10x harder.  -tech associates getting to know products.  I encourage this behavior in my store - but only when it is not being abused.  If you feel this is an opportunity I would suggest working with your GM to find a way to do it that is beneficial to the team.  Maybe you spend 10-15 minutes learning/playing about a product but follow that up by suggesting that you do demonstrations at store rally meetings or that you work to educate your team and they can pick a different item and demonstrate it to educate you.  -home office should get associates opinions  I agree that forums to discuss things are critical to a companies continued success. Staples has a medium for this in the communities page.  However, I would recommend to you to go into your discussions with an understanding that you have very little ""big picture"" knowledge of staples and the industry as a whole.  It's quite good to comment and make suggestions but you must also realize that there is purpose behind many of the things we do."
Staples,322jru,DaBidnessman,2,Sat Apr 11 12:52:21 2015 UTC,Bravo! Let the Couch Quarterbacks have it! It always cracks me up how associates know better than the GM. If this were true the associate would be the one in management instead of being the grunt worker they are.

Staples,322jru,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,2,Mon Apr 13 02:33:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you but my store's margin in laptops is in the positive. My team... I firmly believe is the best team in the company because we are all hustlers and we have developed tactics in order to obtain a positive margin on laptops, tablets, desktops, printers, etc.  But aside from that I see your management position. Its clearly just that... a management position. I'm gonna assume that you haven't started at the bottom of the Staples food chain. I've had a couple managers throughout the years who have actually started as staples associates and worked their way up to where they are in the company today. They were the best managers to work with in my opinion because they can manage the upper level stress with the understanding of the stress that we are put under also. They GET IT. They have been in both colours of the shirts so they know what it is like.   I get that your under a lot of pressure from the machine. However for associates who don't see or are not communicated with the 'bigger picture' ... this is our bigger picture.  Of course, your replied is also slightly biased toward the stores you have worked in and perhaps your current store and market demographic. Much like how mine is."
Staples,322jru,suessydo112358,3,Sat Apr 11 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"How do you determine margin on laptops? What process do you go through to see your sales for the year and the gm% on categories?  I seriously doubt that you can answer these questions.   The only way your store is positive on laptop margin is if 1. You never sell sale laptops (only full price non sale items), and 2. You somehow sell all of your inventory prior to items being marked down.  In my nearly 10 years with staples I have never been in a store that did either.  Laptop margins are too thin because competition is too high.  That means laptops are a destination product that is advertised to bring footsteps into your door.  You are often better off giving a customer a $50 bill than selling them a laptop (but obviously I don't recommend that).  The only way to make up margin is through service and attachment sales.  Stop fighting this, there's no point.  If you don't want to sell services or accessories you are clearly not in the right business.   However, I am willing to bet that if you have a nice conversation with the customer and truly understand their needs you will not have to ""sell"" anything to reach your goals.  The customers will tell you that they need the items.  You will provide solutions to fit their needs.  Make that your aim and you will no longer feel anxiety about sales.  But you have to do it every time with every customer.  That means sometimes being uncomfortable until you get a rapport going.    I did not start at the ""bottom"" with staples, but that's because I started at the bottom with a competitor and had already worked my way up.  I did, however, start in an hourly position.  I completely agree that promoting within is the best way to have a successful store.  One of the issues with that is that people need to be in the right place, at the right time, with the right skill set.  If there aren't any good options, staples has to go external.  Unfortunately staples is a very complicated retail organization -especially given the resources management gets in the store level - and so many external hires just never fully understand the store operations or culture.  If you are curious as to the pressure being put on your GM or leadership team then I would encourage you to take your own advice.  Get to know your managers.  Check in when you come into work and find out what the agenda is.  Discover what the current ""push"" is for and be an active part of the solution. (Ie, sometimes we have a lot of pressure for esp, sometimes for tech, sometimes for market basket.  While all are important priorities shift continuously).    If you're unwilling to do that how can you truly expect your leadership team to provide you with the respect and community you clearly not only want but believe you deserve.   Best of luck."
Staples,322jru,techtechtechtech,2,Sat Apr 11 15:36:54 2015 UTC,Plot twist... Im a GM now.
Staples,322jru,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,2,Sat Apr 11 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"Bull.  I started ""at the bottom"" as a tech associate.  Your ideas, while may ""rally the troops"" and foster conversation (hence the length of this thread) will never get any traction behind them because of the lack of knowledge of the bidness you've demonstrated in your dissertation above.  You've exposed your lack of knowledge by suggesting your stores margin for laptops is ""in the positive"". You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about with a statement like that. Did you mean to say that you make positive margin on PC sales, as a result of your market basket mix of attachments? If you were a GM, you would know how to word it properly.   Also, you'd like to ""work with head office"". Is ""head office"" what Staples Canada calls Home Office? I'm curious. Either way, put your money where your mouth is and reach out to John Burke, Staples Chief Culture Officer. His email is John.Burke@staples.com and he's a really nice guy.   Better yet, why don't you do what I encourage everyone to do. Man up, and have a real face to face conversation with your GM, DM, or RVP. Your original post will reach approximately 0 people who will do anything about it. You may feel good at the end of the day after posting it, and some people will identify with it and give you some internet ego points, but you need to take your message to where it will matter.  It looks like you're in Staples Canada, it may be different there but some of your original post touches on store labor. In US retail, ~75% of stores are operating on the Minimum Staffing Labor Model. In a tier 3, that means 1.0 hour of labor for each department for every hour the store is open. Think about that for a minute, people working together? HA! You will very rarely get double coverage in a department for people to work together, and kiss your ""out of uniform associates for tasking"" idea right out the window.  I don't mean to be a negative Nancy here, just trying to temper the expectations. Reddit associates, contrary to popular belief, GMs don't sit in offices all day figuring out ways to make your lives miserable while they laugh and do nothing. We get an insurmountable amount of crap thrown on us daily, so much for my store in particular our GMxxxx email inbox fills up daily. We have barebones coverage and ALWAYS have more tasks that need to get done than associates to get them done with. Ask your GM to shed some light into the crap he/she has to deal with daily. Maybe you can tag along with the GM for a day and see all the nonsense we have to deal with, and you can choose what to do in what order since your so equipped to do so. I'd be willing to do that if one of my associates asked. I try to remain as transparent as possible.  Good luck, and I'd love to see you reach out to ""head office"" and post your results here."

I think Staples trains people like shit, but there are certain common sense fundamentals a person should know simply by examining the sort of work they do. Cash is: be friendly, quick, and efficient. Take money, give change, hi, bye.  It isn't a chance to recount your life story."
Staples,31yrh6,zerochaos56,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:38:16 2015 UTC,Are we talking real yoga pants or just leggings? Is the shirt tucked in? I'm thinking no.In my store the tights yoga wearing chicks didn't show ass unfortunately.
Staples,31yrh6,Donutfreak,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:31:03 2015 UTC,"Dress code states: Appropriate department polo tucked in with a black belt, black pants, and black shoes, unless you are wearing a maternity uniform which is worn untucked.  When I got promoted I couldn't wear black cargo pants anymore like I did in CPC (I miss my pockets...), so I bought 3 pairs of dress slacks for $20 online. Might want to look into Amazon if expense is an issue."

Staples,31yoxt,rons_moustache,3,Fri Apr 10 01:55:57 2015 UTC,They do not want complaint's to the President's office.  A lot of store staff are gun shy about saying NO to a customer in the current corporate climate.  My store sold them with P/G and coupon until cross channel said not to.  As Kal-El would say  - blame the interns at corporate for this one.
Staples,31yoxt,ccap17,2,Fri Apr 10 04:24:43 2015 UTC,"Our district has ""outlawed"" the word ""No"" in this case the answer we gave them was ""The price is 59.99 Instore and Online, It is just a matter of using a coupon or not."" Our store didn't have any go out of the door. We had Three and sold Three at the actual 59.99 price. Two with protection and all three were sold with extra pods. I do blame the Interns, and their supervisors, and then the supervisor's supervisors, ETC. Staples just lacks a good system of checks and balances in Corporate."
Staples,31yoxt,staplesdepotmax,2,Thu Apr 9 11:02:11 2015 UTC,Had to tell customers like 7 times nope its 60 bucks that's it well they stammer but coupon says 60 dollars off yeah that's sixty off the  $119 price so our store didn't sell a single one I guess half price still wasn't cheap enough for that piece of junk...
Staples,31yoxt,KawaiiJohnny1988,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:26:51 2015 UTC,At the end of this week at least pat yourself on the back that your store didn't give any for free! Apparently this is an accomplishment with how many the company lost so far this week.

Staples,31yoxt,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,0,Fri Apr 10 01:33:10 2015 UTC,Your store sent all of them? There should have been a note on the GPR RTW that said to send any units over three. Meaning if you had 7 you would keep 3 in the store and send 5 to the warehouse.

Staples,31yoxt,dan2872,0,Sat Apr 11 01:16:07 2015 UTC,"No. What was done was someone not following policy. They did a price match, then used the coupon.

Staples,31y1o6,RunsLikeAPussy,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:04:48 2015 UTC,"This company, at least from what I believe (key word believe, I'm not going to pretend that I'm certain of how all the corporate big wigs feel) is trying to operate with stores being the second priority to their online business, a store that is close to me, which happens to be one of the first store's the company ever opened, shut down with the closing of 300 or so stores a year or two ago. This store was in an EXTREMELY, and I emphasize the word EXTREMELY, wealthy, BUSY, LOW-COMPETITION, area, and was a flagship store for the company (also, this store had more items than any other store I've been to, example: They had tons of smartphones INSTORE rather than that d-fill garbage, Ipads instore, ipods instore, dozens of chairs and desks, not to mention a dedicated tech room, huge self serve copy area, and two manager's office's ) yet the company chose to close this store down. If you think about it, since their isn't much competition around here, that means most of their customer base in that region will be buying things online, which is much cheaper than having to pay associates to ring them out and what not as well as paying salaries to managers. Maybe there was a reason I wasn't aware of, but with their tech stats being a regular basis of at least 10% above their expected budget, to me, the surface picture seems that Staples Online> Staples Store's on Mr.Bidness's list of priorities. (And yes I understand this may only be one example but I'm sure there are many others that would further prove this point)"
Staples,31y1o6,staplesthrowaway666,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly disagree. While Staples might have lots of sales online, their profits there are pretty much non-existent.

Staples,31ybmz,BubbleWrapLampShade,3,Thu Apr 9 19:32:26 2015 UTC,Just more proof corporate has no clue what goes on in stores.    There is to much double talk of providing platinum service while completing all tasks on the bare minimum payroll provided.  If you want all associates to be customer focused you need to stop giving short deadlines on tasks.  If stores are missing RTV/RTW expiration windows then extend the windows.
Staples,31ybmz,ccap17,3,Thu Apr 9 11:36:46 2015 UTC,"(FYI - I'm a tech.) The other day I only had two computers on my bench that were all in the process of being taken care of automatically, my ink wall was full and my department was looking fly, so I snagged our IS and asked if there was anything I could do to help her out. She looked at me like she was on the verge of tears and handed me a stack of papers that had lists of product. She asked me if I could help her pull those products, one tote per page, because she was suddenly totally swamped - I'm assuming she was experiencing what OP described, having to do all of this in one day.   I helped her out and when we were clocking out later she said to me, ""It's literally impossible to get everything done by when they expect me to get it done.""  Now, this girl is by no means a powerhouse worker - she could be more efficient in a lot of ways, as far as I can see - but she is absolutely above average when it comes to other employees in the store with how hard she hustles and her patience and knowledge. And even SHE is freaking the fuck out about this."
Staples,31ybmz,BubbleWrapLampShade,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:40:16 2015 UTC,Our store delegates the pull lists to the individual departments so the   opening and closeing asosiates do the pull lists as asignd by MOD or department head  He does ZB returns damages and all the other IS stuff and will double check to make sure when a pull list is missing a lot.    he was complaining today that no one ever does the planograms for the inkwall because neither of the departments handdle it exclusively so dont feel responsible for it.     He is also a key holder who hides in a red shirt so can get shit done when ever he needs to and lets the mod stay on the floor instead of running around whenever anything needs to be fetched from lock up.    He also is damn chill ass brotha who likes when i bring him a muffin from my breakfast place
Staples,31ybmz,TheShroomer,2,Fri Apr 10 03:20:10 2015 UTC,"Wondering if they mean the weekly ones or the damaged ones? Weekly would be impossible to do for the month (since half the time I get surprise ones appearing three days before due date). Damaged ones, I can see this. Problem is, what day to do it. Truck day? Day after truck day? ZB days? Cycle count from hell day(s)? Running out of days. And only the mgrs have email access at my store so havent' seen this...."
Staples,31ybmz,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,2,Thu Apr 9 03:01:15 2015 UTC,I'm an IS at my store and I think that the e-mail from Home Office is to much. They want the weekly RTW/RTV done on Tuesday. The only way for me to get them done on time is IF i have another OS person their so i can be off the floor and do them. It depends if you have a system to get things done. I do all my cycle counts for the week on Monday after i shoot the ZB. Then Tuesday weekly RTW/RTV and then what ever is in my cage. If i don't have to much damages RTW then i'll wait a week to do them but ill ship out the RTV damages that have RA#. They want all this done and do more with less associates in the store. The weekly RTW/RTV doesn't have to be process until Friday because some other returns download on thursday also then what. The store will get a call asking why the weekly RTW/RTV wasn't done.
Staples,31y24t,S0viet_Bear,5,Thu Apr 9 01:24:25 2015 UTC,"Just a warning, a lot of people on this reddit are going to tell you to stay away from the job, because quite honestly there is a shit ton that sucks about Staples. However, for a highschool student (assuming you're actually 18...) it is a great job that pays better than other retail jobs. Oh by the way, it's all grunt work. Now onto the meat of the post:  1) Sales Associate: More than likely cashier/and or office supplies. This is the job I see most high-school age kids do. Pretty easy, not a lot of responsibility, it's the job that requires less thought of them all I'd say. 2) Tech Sales Associate: Definitely a step up, and pays a little bit better than Sales Associate typically. If you like Tech I'd recommend starting here, it's where I started and I couldn't see my self in any other position in Staples. 3) Copy Center: Meh, not my interest, however people always seem pretty happy to do the job. Get ready for multi-tasking to the max. 4) Certified Technician: They wouldn't start you at this position.  When I started I spent 5-6 months as just a sales associate, spent a lot of time shadowing my Tech Supervisor, and took the certification test (which is a pretty dumbed down old version of an A+ cert, will be mildly difficult if you're not an above-average user.) Technicians at Staples are far from what you are probably expecting, however. We probably do 30-40% of the actual work, a lot of it is outsourced to ""The Matrix"" which is a remote service.    You are over-qualified for each and every one of these positions, because they all suck equally as much. Find happiness in making friends with your co-workers. Let me know if you have any questions!"

Staples,31y24t,easytech109,3,Sun Apr 12 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"Sales associate: This is also known as office supplies. This is basically entry level for everybody is hired you will be cashiering and putting away truck. Tech sales associate: Basically a sales associate that sells tech. You will be doing among the same duties as a sales associate but have higher expectations such as having to sell a certain percentage of esp's and tech dollars. You get paid about .65c an hour more than office supplies. Copy and print: Probably the most stressful area in the store. You get paid the same as a sales associate and overall it sucks and is extremely difficult. Certified tech: The only person who is really certified nowadays is the tech supervisor as he does onsites. Staples has a thing called matrix where you just hook up computers and they do the work for you, there really are no more certified techs at staples. Overall it's not a bad place to work but it could be better. You will be limited to 25 hours per week and can't get more than that. You will most likely get hired in at the $7.25 to $7.70 an hour range."

Staples,31y24t,easytech109,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:01:35 2015 UTC,Esp is known as extended service plans. Tech dollars are how much our department brings in for virus removals and other services. If you are not good at selling these you will be moved to office supplies.
Staples,31y24t,easytech109,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:09:11 2015 UTC,Okay so that's the push to make people sell the plans. How much do they want you to sell? Is it on a store by store basis or are there flat metrics across the company?
Staples,31y24t,spuzmonj,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:12:18 2015 UTC,"Minimum goal for every store is 5%. Goal is 7%. This means that out of every 100 items you sell that qualifies for a plan you should be getting at least 5 plans, seven plans is better."
Staples,31y24t,BadForBidness,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"The percentage isn't based on items, it's based on dollars. So selling 5 plans for every 100 items could be more or less than 5%. More like $5 for every $100 sold."

Staples,31y24t,fallogic,7,Thu Apr 9 03:45:48 2015 UTC,"LET ME BE CLEAR, I am going to be very blunt with my explanations, here goes nothing. 1. Sales Associate (AKA Store's Bitch) - You'll spend 75% if not more ringing or just putting load away or grabbing coffee for the managers basically, you'll be involved very little if at all in any kind of tech sales, and it's (at least from what I've seen) usually the lowest paid position (starting wage in my area is usually between 8.25-8.70 2. Tech Sales Associate - Opportunity's for commission (occasionally) and getting hands on experience with sales (maybe not huge ones but hey it helps to prepare yourself for the real world if you ever want to do sales, you also get paid pretty well, it's usually the highest paying position in the store as an entry level associate. Be prepared to also stock shelves as this is a big part of the job, also ringing out customers. (besides certified tech) (Starting wage in my area usually between 8.95 and 9.30) 3. Copy Print Associate - If you hate having  to stock shelves this is the best position because you'll spend most of your time just doing copy center jobs,  it's the second highest payed entry level position in the store, and involves lots of communication with the rest of your team. (Average wage around me is 8.55-8.75) 4. Certified Tech - Ahhhh the good old pain in the ass but oddly satisfying position of fixing computers. Depending on management at your store, you may spend most of your time behind the tech bench fixing pc's and selling whatever services you can to customers that come to the bench to have work done. You're also responsible for the same responsibility of a tech sales associate. IMPORTANT: This position is usually not given right away as entry level because most managers want an employee who already knows what services Staples offers in the tech department to maximize their profits. Make sure you know your way around the inside of a PC as you'll be doing HDD removals, and also be comfortable with registry edits for removing viruses, and with ALL THESE POSITIONS, be comfortable with talking to customers. (If you'd like elaboration on a certain position I'd more than gladly give it to you) (Average wage in my area, this is the highest paying entry level position - 9.50-10.20)"

A question that I have now though is if I can apply for multiple positions. Judging from these responses I will either be going into sales associate or tech sales. Should I apply for both or can I only apply for one? Another thing is that I'm going to be off to college soon so how flexible are they with scheduling? Is it based off of your managers?

General sales associate is pretty much office supplies which, even though I'm an office supplies junkie I hate going into that part of the store. You know how on Walking Dead they can smell a human? You will enter an aisle full of seemingly-occupied shoppers but they'll all simultaneously raise their heads toward you and ask you for the most specific shit you could imagine...I learned, the hard way, that there are classifications of pens based on their shape. I mean the shape of the cylinder of the pen. Is it round? That's a class. Is it hex? That's a class. And then when you figure THAT part out, you get to whittle it down based on the nib and the ink flow and on and on.

Staples,31yane,hrmmmmmmmmmmm,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"Same, though I noticed something changed with how the computer handles electronic returns lately. Back in the day, the computer would let us do whatever we wanted, barring manager approval. Then they implemented the ""Past allowable return date"" after 30 days. Then it changed again to ""Past allowable return date"" after 14 days - effectively locking us out of the computer to return it at all. It's happened to a few electronic items now. It might be an isolated case, but I'm not sure."

Staples,31yane,cinadar,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:16:39 2015 UTC,"Usually it depends on the customer. By rights we have to process returns until the register says no. By that point the customer has called corporate, complained that we won't return their printer they bought 3 years ago, and be told to do it as a manual return from corporate. One time we had to return ink we don't even sell."
Staples,31yane,Cujo117,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:11:51 2015 UTC,"There are many variables.  What is the impact to sales if you return it? Loss of sales? Gain of sales due to upgrading/exchanging?  Whats the impact to customer service if you do/dont? Customer is happy, spends more money with you, or if you don't, tells everyone how bad your store is and ""vows never to return"". Maybe they take the CSAT or call the presidents office.  How valuable is that customer? Think Customer Lifetime Value here. Do they buy a lot of product from your store? Or do they not have a rewards card, indicating they probably aren't in your store often.  These are all things your keyholders SHOULD have running through their head in the 30 seconds it takes to determine whether or not to perform the return.  Being one of those ""14 days is the policy"" keyholders is rediculous. You may win that battle, but you'll lose the war in the long term. And if you're one of those ""but they didn't buy ESP, lets stick it to them!!"" kind of associates, you're going to have a bad time."

Most recently it was about 5 apple trainings due I think on april 3-5th. Had to run the floor, and tech for two hours during peak time so that two easy techs could finish the training, simply to be in compliance and get the DM off our backs. Meanwhile theres I'm sure lots of true training that someone should have to do, which will never be assigned or noticed.

Are you especially talented at anything you do? Ever get Associate of the month? Ever get recognized? How did your performance appraisals go? Are you damn good at selling protection plans? Staples was actually a great way for me to build my resume. Think about your sales, do you not try and offer a total solution for your customers?

Find out if your color printer is having a registration issue also.  It might be that the image being put on the page is off of its alignment.

Staples,31tqms,frostybarnacle,0,Wed Apr 8 04:47:56 2015 UTC,"They are probably throwing them away because the cards aren't aligning properly with the cutter and if they don't do a test print and image shift the card, then that will cause a lot of errors."

They see you and assume you are free to help them for however long it takes.    There is a skill with telling these people that you can't do their job immediately.  A lot of this is just body language and speaking with confidence.  You have to be nice and polite but be matter-of-fact leaving no doubt that there is no room for negotiation.     If it is noon and you think you can get their job done by 5pm, tell them that there are a lot of jobs ahead of them in line, but you can probably get their job done by 7 or 8.   No, it won't take you 7 hours to do their job, it will take 7 hours to do everyone else who came before them and also wanted to be put at the head of the line, and then get to their job.   Then you call them up at 5 with the job done and they are really happy."

Before I worked there, I wanted to get like 8 color pages printed, and the CPC lead said it would be ready the next day. Today, the line to the copy center was actually all the way to the front door. Anything that's more than just printing or a TINY edit, they try to send out to design services.  By the way, what do the tiers really mean?

Tier 2 has the same full timers but makes from 6-8 million tier 3 is 3.5-6 million and they have everything but an ops manager.

Either tells me people are just working to make a pay check or don't care due to lack of hours. Those that do care sell well and actually ask for hours to bring our numbers up.

Staples,31s1t1,WhateverItTakes10x,2,Tue Apr 7 19:39:56 2015 UTC,What is your position in the store? How many hours do you work cause if you're a lead then 32% of EPP numbers are laughable if you're there 35+ hours per week.
Staples,31s1t1,susysyay,2,Tue Apr 7 23:28:39 2015 UTC,"How does that line from Fortunate Son go...?  ""And when you ask 'em, ""How much should we give?"" Ooh, they only answer ""More! More! More!""  Never satisfied"
Staples,31s1t1,Cujo117,2,Wed Apr 8 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"The other thing to that they'll start to harp about is Margin. Or at least that's the new trend with my GM. Expect to push more market basket than ESP. Basically no matter what happens, it's never good enough. We had someone sell $6000 in one transaction for tech and esp. It wasn't good enough even though there were onsites, setups, and so much added on it. It still wasn't enough."
Staples,31s1t1,Cym4tic,2,Wed Apr 8 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"I feel ya, I've been working in my store for 12 months now, regularly top tech salesman. Got hired for $8.70/hr, still making $8.70/hr. GM won't give me a raise."

Staples,31s1t1,zerochaos56,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:12:12 2015 UTC,Are you bad at other things? I have a cashier that is awesome with plans but it's probably by far one off the worst all around associates I have worked with.
Staples,31s1t1,dan2872,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:27:02 2015 UTC,"I am the Tech Supervisor.   We have 1 Certified Tech, who works 12 hours a week.  The other 3 people, other than myself, in the department are a high school kid who just moved from Office Supplies, a part-time employee who is scheduled for 12 hours in CPC each week, and another part-time employee who the GM puts on register at least one shift a week. It's absurd.   When I started, we had 4 Certified Techs, who all worked 25 hours a week. Since then a Microsoft store has opened in the area, and 2 of them work there now. We also had a Costco open up down the block - which stole our Inventory Specialist, CPC Supervisor, and 2 other employees. ""Magically"" we all of a sudden don't have the budget to rehire that many techs - which is why we are double-department-duty. It's a joke.   As for our numbers: We consistently hit budget for ET. ESP has been admittedly awful since the switch to Virus Shield Plus. My GM keeps pointing out that another store in our region hasn't had any problem. It's true. They haven't. They also have 2 full-time Certified Techs, and a full roster of single-department employees.. oh, and the store is in an affluent neighborhood. But other than that, we're exactly the same store, right?   I asked my GM why the ESP plans are less expensive on Staples.com, and cover an additional year, and why we couldn't offer THOSE plans in store, and he just laughed off the question.   I thought we could price-match? I guess not."
Staples,31s1t1,dan2872,0,Wed Apr 8 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"1.) you can't match square trade and you know that.   2.) your esp shouldn't be dropping with the new virus shield program, if a diag and repair comes in its either $100 for our virus shield service or $104 with a $70 square trade too because of the 20% off. If you can't sell the square trade there I don't know what to say, plus we have awesome 3 year printer plans right now.   3.) I'm you in a T3 store, I pull about 55% of my store's ESP and likely about that in tech. I'm there for 40 hours a week, everyone else is 15-20, of course your esp is higher than your department. Btw, we have 1 full timer (me), no certified tech, and 4 part time techs, 2 of which are weekend only.  Hours are awful, that's not a unique experience. We rarely have overlap.  Something's off here, OP."

Staples,31qxkq,NeoTheTech,0,Thu Apr 9 04:56:15 2015 UTC,I never sold phones and I left the company 8 months ago. I still have my employee discount with Verizon. Take a pay stub to them or do an email verification with the CPC email. It's a 12% plan discount and 20% accessory discount.
Staples,31qxkq,G9Lamer,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:44:42 2015 UTC,Not the same discount. Sales maker discount is half off data and no device fee.

My SM just laughed at him and opened one of the boxes. As expected the printheads and ink were missing.  The guy made a lame argument that he never opened the box, but took them both and left.

Staples,31q244,dan2872,2,Tue Apr 7 17:02:31 2015 UTC,My understanding was that there are much more expensive printers that take this print head but it still doesn't make any sense for a $600 printer to come with an $800 printhead.   As it is Staples raised the price on the r2000 by $100 in the wake of all the resellers.

Lo and behold, he gives me an R2000 and tells me exactly what he did with it (though I already knew) but since I knew my store was done with those, I paid no mind.

Be prepared for 8 hours of your RSSM chanting ""upsell, upsell, upsell""   Also, a half hour will be dedicated to how UPS and USPS is not cpc responsibility anymore. You are supposed to page the single O/S associate to clear the shipping line when he is already with 3 other customers and has a three page list of tasks to do. It doesn't matter that there are two or three people in CPC, call O/S just so they get used to it.  Then when there is no O/S associate scheduled, you make the page anyway to make the shipping customers THINK someone is coming, then ignore them."

Be active, they are giving star points like candy.   Some of the integration of the systems will be a bitch, just like solution builder was at first, but keep in mind that some of the stuff they show will be a lot doing with $750k+ and million dollar stores.   If you've been with the company for awhile and know how things used to be, itll be more to soak up than those who havent been in the company that long. I was impressed with some of the dcs machines and what they want to do.   Keep in mind that you'll be asked to push harder in the sales but they are in love with the stores using the system to push the sales. Im 1 of like 20 stores(i think there was close to 200 supervisors) at the Wilmington symposium with dcs pen over 25% so the people from the dcs were loving me. Be realistic with the goal you set for yourself and work with your account manager to push the sales and adjust the quotes if you use the programs right.

However, he had walked out of the store he worked at where his school was.  He had been termed in the system and black listed due to job abandonment.  It took almost a month for our GM and HR, going back and forth, to un-blacklist him and allow him to be ""rehired.""  By then, he'd gotten another job because he couldn't wait and never came back anyway.  It's worth two weeks of difficulty not to put your hometown store in that postition."

Staples,31kyop,eternistarr,3,Mon Apr 6 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"Indeed. This is a red flag like no other for fraud.  Anyone who wants to buy a lot of a redeemable item (gift cards, stamps, etc) is a massive ""CAREFUL. GET MANAGER"" flag for me. I also call any time I'm given a cheque, as I've literally never had anyone try to use them legitimately.  Anyone who wants a lot of something is up to no good, generally. People who make bulk orders do that through advantage or online, imo.  Also, take my advice: Happy people truly are hiding something. If you think someone is playing games, tell them something in the negative and watch the reaction. Thieves aren't emotionally invested in the conversation and furthermore want to keep it going so they let it go over smoothly. I've never had a customer do that - it's always been a comment of sadness and some detectable facial distress.  Had I paid more attention to that, I would've have been taken for a very expensive item."

If you don't want to go that route, you should contact your states DOL, not Staples HR. Staples HR is there to protect staples from its employees, not the other way around.   Edit: Some states (perhaps even most) require you to contact your HR dept before filing an official complaint with the state, but still contact the DOL first just in case."
Staples,31lihp,TaeKurmulti,2,Mon Apr 6 05:06:19 2015 UTC,Dude they are firing gm's for doing this.  Staples HR may be there to protect staples from employees.  But this includes dropping the bomb on managers who are putting Staples in a place where it can be sued.
Staples,31lihp,staplesthrowaway666,2,Mon Apr 6 05:10:49 2015 UTC,"True, but contacting your dept of labor will help prevent repercussions. It's better to contact them first, then if you get fired it doesn't look like revenge.

It comes up that way anytime a edit is made so if you forget to punch in or out and they fix it, its an edit.   You cant assume that they are changing the time but there is always a chance that being the case. Screenshot and compile it til you have the proof you feel you need to prove it. Take pictures of all your punches and print them. Use your phone and do a photo montage of them so it can be noted when you come in and out so your hours can be tracked. If the math doesn't add up, you have the proof. You'll need this for several weeks in order for it to have any strength in a lawsuit"

Staples,31ldnz,cinadar,3,Mon Apr 6 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"You can't always get it right when it comes to preventing fraudulent transactions with visa gift cards. The best you can do is require debit or cash or always verify ID if credit is used. Also run the ID under the UV bill checker. Most if not all states have a UV component to their licenses and you should know what a real one looks like so you can compare. At that point if the sale is fraudulent but you've done all this, you've done your due diligence and so you can't really be held responsible."
Staples,31ldnz,joebacca121,3,Mon Apr 6 04:56:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't.  Biggest red flag for me is when a customer wants to do a bunch of different batches, especially with different cards. Or if it is declined and they say ""ok, let's do just two $200 cards"" or something. This is soooo often because the card is stolen and at or near the limit. If it gets declined and instead of going wtf, let me call the bank they just try to run less............................. 99.99% fraud."
Staples,31ldnz,katyrzana,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:35:52 2015 UTC,"I hear the ""ok, let's do just two $200 cards"" line every single time with these people. Their cards are clearly fakes/stole and their IDs are also fake."
Staples,31ldnz,WelcomeToStaples,2,Tue Apr 7 06:50:38 2015 UTC,"Well we have a certain religious group come in and try to by like 12 $200 Visa Gift cards. We limit Visa gift card transactions to 9 $200 giftcards. This is not uncommon of this group so we don't suspect fraud, however signatures on back of cards are matched and IDs required. If they ask its our store policy to verify IDs on transactions over $1000"
Staples,31ldnz,bopisalert,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:41:39 2015 UTC,I believe there is an official policy relating to gift card sales. Search on the Hub for specifics.
Staples,31ldnz,venturer95,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:48:30 2015 UTC,"$2,000 is the federal limit for selling gift cards to any one person in a calendar day. If anyone come in and wants any more than one $200 gift card we will ID if not paying in cash. If we think anything is sketchy about the situation we reserve the right to sell only one."
Staples,31ldnz,ienom,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"$2k is the limit on the purchase of gift cards in store. This includes taxes and whatever activation fees. This is per customer, per day. The whole crap some people try to pull with ""Oh, my husband/wife (whatever) is going to buy another set with the same card"" doesn't fly, either. There's guides on the Hub which you can look into to spot fake credit cards as well. Different companies (Visa/MasterCard/AmEx) have a bunch of things you can check on the card itself to tell if they're fake. If the card doesn't even swipe, I wouldn't accept it at all. Always check the ID and become familiar with your state and the surrounding ones just to be safe. Sometimes, they will try to switch cards around if one doesn't work. Generally speaking, if they pull out more than two cards, I'd be super uneasy about it.  In the worst case scenario - do what I've been told for years now and just call the credit card company to verify the card if you still feel uneasy about it. The people that are usually trying to pass one off on you will mostly bolt out of the door as soon as you say you're going to call it in. If it looks like they're going to (they start making excuses of how busy they are and have to leave ASAP, looking all over, fiddling with their phone erratically, or trying to make you feel like an ass about the whole ordeal) take note of the name and state on the ID/credit card used/and car details and get a hold of immediate stores in the area if they do leave."

I do not hate the company, I just disagree with virtually every policy decision they make. I love most of my coworkers, but to be honest I did not see things getting better. Labor hours will not just magically increase--they want people to get used to having 250 hours a week or less so that when they cut them even more it won't be noticed as much. I also will not miss the political aspect of my district. Promotions seemed to be based on a lot of butt kissing and shady, two-faced backstabbing rather than who can get the job done. Also, good luck if you are a person of color or LGBT because there are 0 LGBT managers in my district and only a handful of people of color. I'm not suggesting it was necessarily intentional, but it is what it is.   Also, the air conditioning sucks. Seriously corporate, you are running a sweat shop. There is no reason it should be cooler outside than it is in the store, especially in the South in the middle of summer."

Staples,31j1e1,mkinetic,2,Sun Apr 5 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"For our store being open today was bad for bidness, so we get the day off."
Staples,31j1e1,venturer95,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:09:28 2015 UTC,Our store is closed today. I thought all Staples stores were closed?
Staples,31kx4h,OnSiteTech,2,Mon Apr 6 01:37:53 2015 UTC,"I'd say biggest is make sure everyone is offering, every time. Especially the cashiers. They may need some education on where to offer it, and what to say to customers. It doesn't have to be a 20 minute spiel, telling customers ""it will cover more than the manufacturers warranty, lasts longer, and doesn't cost much"" is probably sufficient for cashiers who don't give a shit to memorize more and don't spend long with each customer. You may be able to train your techs well but if you don't get the cashiers on board you are never going to get great numbers, since they will ring up a LOT of tech items."
Staples,31kx4h,katyrzana,2,Mon Apr 6 01:49:54 2015 UTC,"My best piece of advice is to never offer the option of Total Support without the ESP on existing PCs. The difference on a 1-year plan is only $5, and $25 on 2-year plans. Just ALWAYS bundle the ESP with the Virus Shield Plus."
Staples,31kx4h,WorthingtonBotts,2,Mon Apr 6 12:57:24 2015 UTC,"Watch your back. I have been MTS in my store for 2 1/2 years, been with Staples over 4. My esp is twice the next persons and I was employee of the month for January and February. Then a visit from the RVP and DM. Never so much as spoke to either of them.  Now I am being targeted for the old push out the door. And no, it's not just perinoia for I have seen the actual note."

Your not going to get any raise or recognition that's worthwhile out of this. Other than making Staples more money and getting better metrics, just look for a better job. I honestly think a better job would pay off ten-fold over making the metrics just a little better. Just my two cents."

Staples,31kgbb,NeoTheTech,3,Mon Apr 6 00:52:42 2015 UTC,Yeah it just changes the message to say your closed but you can still hold while the call rings in an empty store.
Staples,31kgbb,bopisalert,2,Mon Apr 6 02:26:10 2015 UTC,"If you have one that has the automated answer system, you can set it to closed (and it will automatically do this for regular hours) so it will say ""We are currently closed"" and people wait through the hours before the phone rings. It still rings just in case though."

Staples,31ko38,OldWeirdPro,3,Mon Apr 6 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, we have this issue all the time.  Solution here is to use the public hotspot or tether our phone."
Staples,31ko38,NeoTheTech,2,Mon Apr 6 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"Find your easy tech network equipment. Unplug all the switches from power, give then a few seconds to cool off, then plug them back in.

That'll both create an unfirewalled wireless hotspot AND acts as a modem if you connect it to a customer PC using a microUSB cable. That's what I'd recommend doing. Or, see if your manager will pay for a VPN subscription for EasyTech out of petty cash (haven't tried this second method to see if it'd actually work, and pretty sure Salinger might throw a shitfit, sooooo grain of salt)."
Staples,31ko38,UnnamedStaplesDrone,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:27:07 2015 UTC,"We get this on our network, though on ethernet and wifi. For us its our firewall blocking certain ports, as it can make setting up outlook a pain in the ass."

I can't download Office on ethernet and the wireless is like 50KB/s at our store. It is beyond pitiful."
Staples,31ko38,kirashi3,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"300 ft extra Ethernet cable, some couplers and terminating ends, and we've got a store use router running I front of the firewall, with everything else behind it for store ops.  The decision was either violate policy (gee whiz, not like that doesn't happen a lot) or implement our own means to actually do the work our customers paid for."
Staples,31j16y,asc6,8,Sun Apr 5 15:52:57 2015 UTC,"Probably more of the same old bullshit.  Sell ESP and tech or you're fired. Be at >50% digital receipts or you're fired etc, etc...  Store is to be visit ready 100% of the time, and oh, yeah...more hours cuts.  More threats that anyone and everyone is replaceable and you are just a number.    Seems to be the pattern from my own experience with recent visits and what I have read here on Reddit and other sites.     It is kind of funny that McDonald's and Walmart are at least making an attempt to improve associate relations (although it is a lame attempt) while Staples just keeps trying to make associate relations worse."

Staples,31h41y,elentirion,-5,Sun Apr 5 01:09:36 2015 UTC,Corporate has no limits set on gift cards. Why would you not accept more than 5?
Staples,31h41y,Loco4Staples,13,Sun Apr 5 01:12:32 2015 UTC,The back of the card says no more than 5 cards can be used per transaction

Staples,31h41y,elentirion,10,Sun Apr 5 01:33:04 2015 UTC,"For those wondering. It was about 10-15 gift cards, some with only pennies on them, but still.   When the 4th reseller came in looking for a computer the MOD (who is the floating GM in the district) called him out and said ""we don't have any more computers you and your resellers cleaned us out today."" and the reseller let out a nervous laugh and acted like he didn't know what he was talking about. He left quickly."

Staples,31h41y,UnnamedStaplesDrone,2,Sun Apr 5 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"Don't we have the ""this item is intended for sale at Staples"" stickers. One right on the seal and maybe one on the label somewhere"

Staples,31h41y,jammnpenguin,2,Sun Apr 5 06:02:40 2015 UTC,Honesty I think its cool when people (not resellers) get the laptops for next to nothing. I have been with staples for over 1 year and I don't give a shit about esp. Yes I try to sell as much plans as possible but if the numbers are low well that sucks but I don't even care. I don't get any more money for selling them and my hours don't get cut at all. ( no one get cut hours for not selling enough plans). Why should I even care about esp?

Staples,31hk2j,banabon,3,Sun Apr 5 03:44:09 2015 UTC,"We're expecting a bit of CPC business and random people who didn't seem to get invited to family gatherings. Overall, it really isn't worth it to even be open at all. Apparently, they think it's good for bidness."
Staples,31hk2j,frostybarnacle,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:21:00 2015 UTC,I bet if we weren't open I would have lost hours due to 1 less business day in the week
Staples,31hk2j,Yellow-Curry,2,Sun Apr 5 04:30:30 2015 UTC,"I worked today and the CPC had ZERO church customers which surprised me.  At my old store we would have been slammed with Easter service print orders from a dozen different churches. My current store is closed tomorrow too, strangely enough. I don't think any of our sister stores are closing for the day."
Staples,31hk2j,NeoTheTech,2,Sun Apr 5 03:51:14 2015 UTC,"It should be slow throughout most the store, but CPC will be slammed. Will have people bitching about how it is ridiculous that we close early and that we can't print their 5 24x36 color posters for their school final project due on Monday at 8am. Had a customer last year who thought that since we couldn't have her huge order due as she waited as we closed the store that we could magically send the order to a closed store and make it print overnight for her.   When the store closes at 5, you will get the usual 4:50pm rush of crazy folks who won't leave."
Staples,31gn74,suessydo112358,10,Sat Apr 4 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"Ulimately, you're right, to an extent. You'll find a lot of issues at many other retailers, but I think they pale in comparison to Staples. The communication is just so divided between corporate and retail stores, they push so much useless work onto us (top stock removal...really?) continue to cut labor hours, raise prices, and manage to keep their same shitty expectations. I have never walked into a store with one associate managing an entire floor, but that is not entirely uncommon in our stores because of terrible labor hours and even worse, employee morale. They need to decide what THEY want, productive workers, or great customer satisfaction, because if they don't want to give the labor hours to do it, it just won't work.

Staples,31gn74,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE,4,Sat Apr 4 22:24:01 2015 UTC,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE was spouting the same sort of garbage some months back. It's funny to watch how quickly people become jaded to Staples.

Staples,31gn74,MAD_ESP_UPINHERE,-1,Sun Apr 5 13:16:01 2015 UTC,"i second the disconnect from corp to the field; but again i don't find that to be unique. i got a chance to meet several corp people while we were part of a pilot who weren't vp's or other senior types and they asked good questions, had solid ideas, and listened to what we were saying. I emailed an RVP last week about a new small business service to link up solar panel companies with other small businesses and not only did he respond, he forwarded my email to the merchant who works on that kind of stuff. If i am just the luckiest 0.01% of associates out there than sorry for gloating."
Staples,31gn74,Donutfreak,8,Sat Apr 4 22:40:40 2015 UTC,"What, are you working in the Framingham store or something? Here's the thing though: As a store level employee they will listen to you but it ultimately changes nothing.  The problem lies with the highest ranking members of the company letting incredibly stupid decisions make it down the chain. Why are we constantly wasting time on filling out sales worksheets that make us look like mouthbreathers to the customer? Why is the ETToolbox such a clusterfuck of scriptkittied nonsense? Why does the Matrix even exist considering they take longer on everything and 99% of the time leave work to be done anyway? Why does the store constantly berate its employees about loss prevention? In reality if the company actually cared there would be a security guard & cameras in every store. Why haven't they released a TRUE one click diagnostic software on the ETToolbox? Why is the OMS the worst piece of software ever invented? Every time I type a word in the notes it completely prevents me from typing until I add a new word like Sophos to the spellcheck filter. Why do none of the words I add actually stay in the filter for next time? Why do they lock out the diagnostic PC so heavily? Why is every Matrix agent allowed to leave notes that are so convoluted & useless that they might as well have smashed their face into the keyboard and called it good? Where is the quality control on that apparently incredibly valuable and important service that my DM is always breathing down my neck about? Why are we forced to check things in under a Matrix sku that can't be connected to by the Matrix and then berated for not having a high connection rate? Why are prices of ET services like Total Support completely wrong on the OMS order? I really want to talk shit about the OMS more, so I will. I have wasted thousands of company hours dealing with the OMS. It's a bottleneck on my workload. If I had a better system for that I wouldn't need to use the Matrix because I'd never have a build up of computers on the bench. I really want to sit face to face with the coders of that shit and rip them a new one. It always takes 10x longer or more than it should. Just recently they got rid of a bunch of fluff but there are still so many shitty check boxes and redundancies it's insane. If there was just one day where you actually got the training you need, none of that would be necessary. Why do we waste so much god damn paper on printing work orders? Why haven't we converted to an all digital system? Sure, we can still print it for people who don't have email, but eventually they better fucking give in because if you have a computer without an email address you might be literally retarded.   I actually know the answer to all of my ""whys"". It's bad for bidness. The opinions of our benefactors on what is profitable for Staples are almost always majorly flawed. If they made me CEO I could turn the company around in a year, guaranteed. I wouldn't do it alone of course, I would hire more young people. Look at the CEO of blockbuster, the guy was so daft he didn't realize what the internet even was before it was too late. Yes, Staples is a huge online retailer but the only reason for that is in-store Kiosk sales combined with the fact that having thousands of stores world wide is an excellent marketing strategy. You might say to yourself that this kid boasting about how he could turn the company around is full of shit, and maybe I am. Maybe I really couldn't save the company. In my opinion though, anybody but the people who are currently in power could save the company.  My disclaimer is that I am incredibly bias and I hope you take what I've said here with a grain of salt. I actually agree with you on many points and believe it or not I enjoy working at Staples sometimes. They're a good company with an excellent reputation in customer service. I don't take my job for granted. I just think things are going downhill and there isn't anything we can do to stop it."

Staples,31gn74,catherinecc,7,Mon Apr 6 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"Retail is hard ass work if you are doing it right; that's what the paycheck is for. Do just enough not to get fired and all you will be to ANY company is a part time, minimum wage stop gap before the next labor plan overhaul is put in place to try and cover losses and justify even more store closings.   Just more propaganda promising people that if they ""work harder"" they will be rewarded. In reality, everyone is disposable and the chance to progress is minimal, at best.   95%+ of the people working will remain the ""minimum wage stopgap.""  Sure, you have advanced, but let's not pretend there isn't even a little bit of observation bias that colour your opinions. But even excluding that, you're working at staples with a postgrad degree. Your future job prospects with this company are empty. Do you get paid enough to save money? Survive financial hardship for a month? Deal with your spouse's medical bills? Buy a house?  That said, you're right in one respect, it's not just staples, but retail in general.   But make no mistake. We are still utterly disposable shit. The new American working class is just a means for someone at corporate to get a bonus this quarter - and none of those people care that your company is on a death march because in this new economy, they'll be ok while most of us - and that includes you - will be treated as disposable."

We are merchants now. Not building anything worth buying, just reselling goods to consumers. Don't forget that the most profitable customers are business and government contracts, not consumers. So with margins already razor thin, and competition for retail market-share and customer mind-share , what else do we have to set ourselves apart other than effort? Don't get me wrong, it's tough, especially when you feel like your not getting the support you expect from the top down, but is having a defeatist attitude about what you do every day help? I do make enough to pay my bills, but thanks to student loans i have to work part time as a math tutor four days a week. Is that fair given how hard i work?...who really gives two shits if it's fair?"
Staples,31gn74,NiBlade,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"So with margins already razor thin, and competition for retail market-share and customer mind-share , what else do we have to set ourselves apart other than effort?   The truth is that there is nothing we can do and that we're just along for the ride. Corporate sets everything, and they aren't interested in job losses, or creating a good working environment, only ensuring that they continue getting paycheques.    but is having a defeatist attitude about what you do every day help?   I think there is significant value in genuine awareness. Maybe things would change once this generation accepts what their position is and what possibilities they ""enjoy"" under the ""status quo"" (which really isn't, but is part of a dedicated effort to drive down the cost of labour against inflation that started before many current employees were born)   Instead we continue with the ""status quo"" and have children that will be fed into this system who will be even worse off.   Or maybe we'd just all blow our brains out on the nearest wall. Who knows.  At the very least, we should leave this failing industry en masse and give our employers the exact sort of dedication and loyalty they give us.   Logically, this should have happened already, but because we're decent people we haven't begun treating them like they have treated us. But make no mistake, us caring for them and caring for our fellow employees is not only working against us, but also being used by someone only interested in a bonus this quarter."

Staples was great for me as far as working hard, being appreciated, getting promotions, etc.  It helped me build a resume and find a MUCH better job.  It sounds like you have some very interesting corporate connections, which is great.  In my store, though, we just got constantly shat on by corporate.  We all worked our tails off, but a random bigwig would show up, tell us our store looks like shit, complain about the music on the radio (yeah... seriously... as if we choose that!), and then beat the hell out of us for weeks on end.  We'd then spend a month going nuts about the things he pointed out and fix them all up... and then he'd flip out because our CSAT was dropping.  There's just no winning.  The disconnect is ridiculous.  They pay seriously meager wages, even for store management... MUCH lower than most other stores; more in line with like a dollar store.  We actually had several people leave for nearby fast food because they paid over $1/hr more.  But hey.... it's a job.  And with all the turn-over at Staples, it means it's easy to get promoted and pad your resume if that's what you're looking for."

It's meager pay but I agreed to it - I'll do my job as I agreed to as well.  That said:  You'll never see me jogging down the aisles so I can help more people because we are understaffed, though.

Staples,31bi3d,staplestwerkteam,6,Fri Apr 3 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"Most lifers are there because they've gotten stuck, or are afraid of change.   It's a dangerous game, management is actually more expendable than part timers to Staples, which is a scary business model. My DM was apparently put on final warning by Otis a few months ago, which prompted him to go do the same to several GMs, which prompted them to do the same to several SSMs."
Staples,31bi3d,KaizokuDan,3,Fri Apr 3 16:39:45 2015 UTC,"Staples is an intellectual purgatory. Lifers are there for a variety of reasons, but my personal experience with them is that most stay because they are too afraid of change, or as in the case of one of my coworkers too lazy to put out resumes, or they really don't have many other options.   I encouraged all of my coworkers to go back to school because retail is one of those industries where skills do not really translate well. So if you spend 10 years in retail and get fired, you can be a manager at a retail business or you can be a manager at a retail business. It's not like you can take your management experience and go into accounting or IT management. If you're an assistant manager (or supervisor) at Staples and suppose you get fired (or quit) and want to work for a different type of store like Old Navy or Ross, they probably won't hire you as a manager because you have no experience in that industry. In a way, retail management is kind of like a degree from DeVry, a lot of time and effort into something that really won't help you in the long run. But there are those who like retail, and god bless you people I wish you the best."

If you and I (a customer) are discussing a product I'm looking for or wanting more information about, the ringing phone at your service desk isn't supposed to mean that you abandon me.  If that's how it works, should I get my phone out and call the store to get your attention back?    I truly truly truly understand the complaints about many (most?) customers, but being in the customer role isn't what causes douchebaggery.

Staples,31999n,vayneblade,6,Fri Apr 3 02:53:42 2015 UTC,staples has really made me hate cheap asian customers.
Staples,31999n,UnnamedStaplesDrone,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:13:28 2015 UTC,"Or just cheap customers in general. Had a 30 something year old guy walk in with about $500 worth of Staples gift cards wanting to buy 2 laptops after his desktop was hacked and had a virus installed. He kept on haggling me about getting price matches on various models and no matter how many times I told him the restrictions on price match he kept blurting out ""try tigerdirect, compusa (which doesn't even exist as a website anymore), etc"". I just started to tune him out.   The great thing is that he keeps on asking about what we could do with his desktop. The tech had already told him what we could do and how much it would cost. Then he asks if we could do the virus removal on the desktop for free since he's buying so much stuff. We're talking about two laptops with nothing on them mind you. Oh and the final price of the laptops with his gift cards being around $200-250. His mom is part of a law firm which has a contract with Staples and all this guy is doing is schmoozing off of her and being an ultimate cheap ass. Couldn't wait to get rid of him. Of course he called the next day wanting to come back to find out about another laptop...-__-"
Staples,31999n,TEEHEE_NYC87,2,Fri Apr 3 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"I had a customer standing by the CS counter so I asked her if she needed help and she said ""well I have a question about routers but the cashier said he will help me, but he's with a customer right now."" So I politely said ""well, maybe, I could help you so you don't have to wait for him to finish. Plus, I am one of the techs, and even though our cashiers are knowledgeable, he may not be able to answer more complex questions and give you a more detailed description."" And as soon as I said that, she was like ""YOURE SMOTHERING ME! I'M LEAVING! YOU JUST TURNED ME OFF!""     They get pissed when you don't offer help, AND when you do? I hate our customers"

I enjoyed it, but the actual job in the store hasn't been any different than just a regular floor sales position. We got the laptop table reset, but we aren't one of the stores that got the new MS Match kiosk."
Staples,31a99n,jlaford,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"We got the kiosk in our store, but right now it's just playing a loop video, Match hasn't gone live on it yet.   My day-to-day has changed pretty drastically. I'm the go-to person for sales now, which means I try to hand-off into pretty much every computer safe. That, being at full time, and my general ownership of the tech pad are the only things that have really changed. My SSM and GM just basically take me more seriously now, not that they didn't before (they've always been great)  I'm really hoping they'll comp us Surface 3s if/when we start carrying them in May."
Staples,31a99n,Windryy,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"That would be amazing, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. The main thing that has changed for me is that I work full time now. They put me into full time back when the position opened up. They had moved me into the position within a few days after I agreed to take it. I already had pretty high sales numbers, and I tend to be highest in ESP most weeks and usually first or second in tech sales.  I took a lot of notes at the training, and I'm going to type them up to give to the other sales associates at my store so that everyone is in the loop, since we're responsible for the store's overall MS device sales and office attach rate. If you'd like I could send you the notes after I type them up."
Staples,31a99n,daikazoku,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:41:19 2015 UTC,Are you able to provide anymore information of the position? I haven't heard anything about it and it seems interesting.

Staples,3197aa,spikymetal,5,Fri Apr 3 00:19:42 2015 UTC,It's been like this in my region for months now. 25 is a hard cap on hours worked.  0.01 over = write up for GM. We're now told to not schedule over 20 hours for a week so as to allow for coverage of call outs etc. It's been working about as well as you'd expect (not at all). It took me 3 hours of phone calls and shuffling associates around times/departments this morning for me to find coverage for a single call out.
Staples,3197aa,joebacca121,2,Fri Apr 3 01:09:53 2015 UTC,Well this is a blast from the past for most of this forum.  It's been that way for a while.

Staples,3197aa,Spaalone,2,Fri Apr 3 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"My district never seemed to care about the 25 hour thing until this last week, didn't know it was because of Desanto. Being tier 2 and having two associates quit, and everybody already scheduled at 25 hours makes basic operational tasks nearly impossible lately.   Just be happy he doesn't live in your district. The visits are not fun :("
Staples,3197aa,DaBidnessman,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:42:07 2015 UTC,"We're a Tier 4, I'm quitting on Tuesday, one of our cashiers is leaving and the only other OS associate is actively looking for other jobs. Inventory is coming up in 6 weeks or so, nobody else really knows how to do pull lists and all the OS associates are new, so it could be worse for  your store :)"
Staples,3197aa,Spaalone,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"I've heard the horror stories of tier 4... my district has one who's GM just quit and that left the AM and MTS as the only keyholders. Aside from having the extra managers we basically have the staff of a tier 4 store. Only thing that would make things worse is actually being tier 4 and losing those extra keys...  Anyway, good luck to you. Where are you going after Staples?"
Staples,3197aa,DaBidnessman,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:04:59 2015 UTC,"Tier 4 is not as bad as people think if you have the right management. Unfortunately our store has an assistant who would rather play politics than get to work, and a tech supervisor who likes to look busy rather than be busy. I have a feeling more managers will be cut, because many Tier 2 & 3 stores will have more managers working than customers in the store--and when you really think about it, you don't need a Sales Manager or Operations manager when a team supervisor can do the same thing for less.   I will be going to work for my former employer. It was a lot less stressful, and ZERO politics. Staples is more work that it is worth, especially considering I'm still a student and applying to PhD programs. I don't have time for all the petty drama and self-important managers."
Staples,3197aa,Scofflaw60,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:16:29 2015 UTC,"I've said this for awhile now. I truly believe with the GM, SSM, Tech Sup and a Team Sup, our store as a Tier 3 is far overrun with management all trying to get their 40 hours in.  Lately meanwhile theres at any given time 2 or 3 customers in the whole store.  It just doesnt need that kind of manager saturation. Its beyond ridiculous."
Staples,3197aa,DaBidnessman,1 point,Fri Apr 3 10:45:58 2015 UTC,"If your managers are like mine, they're all trying to look busy rather than be busy and yet are absolutely befuddled that nothing gets done."
Staples,3197aa,Scofflaw60,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"They spend most of their time plotting a strategy. They beat the hell out of, and keep spinning the same tired old shit.  The store is about selling the crap. And they do little to nothing to help that cause. ( except for trying to come up with new ways to get me to do it )"
Staples,3197aa,DaBidnessman,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:54:28 2015 UTC,"Well part of management's job is to come up with a strategic game plan, however what I find is that many of them come up with ideas that are not based on any solid evidence or reasoning but are rather simply shots in the dark. A good manager will lead by example, mine has not sold a single ESP plan, but feels the need to give cashiers goals for ESP. This person has been with the company for more than a decade, and still hasn't figured out how to sell ESP? I fear for the future of my store if those are the kind of people the district managers want running stores."
Staples,3197aa,Scofflaw60,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:57:37 2015 UTC,Selling crap like the ESP takes a certain knack to do. Some just don't have that. Period. Manager or not.

They removed the ST prompts from the registers because an error, if not cleared correctly, would cause an issue that could lead to shrink. (If we think about this, we can assume that - printer is rung, ST prompt is accepted, printer and ST item corrected, ST still reports as sold but not paid. Maybe?) Did your opening MOD not notice that all of the POS systems were rebuilt overnight?"
Staples,3194sn,bigongst,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:25:43 2015 UTC,I was opening MOD yesterday and didn't notice anything different when I was opening the registers. I also don't ring very often anymore so I didn't see that the ST prompts went away.
