linuxmint,3e5j2a,zubie_wanders,2,Wed Jul 22 04:22:46 2015 UTC,e.g. if your flash drive path is /dev/sdb1   Force unmount  umount -f /dev/sdb1   Try to use dd to wipe usb   sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb1 bs=1k count=2048     Note: make sure you know the exact /dev path to your USB drive and type this correctly or you could end up wiping your hard disk. Also this might take awhile   See if it shows up in gparted and create a new partition.

linuxmint,3duz9s,wewewawa,7,Sun Jul 19 19:00:40 2015 UTC,I love mint for what it is but I do not wish all distros were like mint. I prefer Arch for my desktop because it fills my needs better. If everything was like mint I wouldn't be happy even though I think mint is a great distro.
linuxmint,3duz9s,dasonk,3,Sun Jul 19 20:00:04 2015 UTC,"I strongly agree with you. Mint is to me what Ubuntu was before Unity; something solid, compatible, reliable and good for lower end machines like old laptops and such.   I also use arch for my desktop needs, but use Mint for recovery or when people want to try Linux, that's what I show them."
linuxmint,3duz9s,Kochon,2,Sun Jul 19 22:07:22 2015 UTC,Definitely.  My dad recently asked about trying out Linux because he isn't a huge fan of Windows and doesn't want to keep paying for it if he doesn't have to.  I got his desktop dual booting Mint and Windows for the time being and I'm happy to see that 90% of the time I'm over there it's Mint that is up and running.  One day if he wants maybe he'll migrate to Arch but I highly doubt that.  Mint is pretty much exactly what he wants out of an OS.
linuxmint,3duz9s,dasonk,2,Sun Jul 19 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"I think the point that other distros need to take away is this one-sentence description of Mint 17.2: ""This is exactly the kind of user-focused release that solves small, everyday problems while leaving the rest of the system alone.""  To put it another way: While Fedora and Ubuntu have spent the last couple of years experimenting with tablet-focused releases that are a pain in the ass to adjust to because because they so thoroughly break the ""desktop"" metaphor that we're used to*, the folks behind Mint have been busy resolving issues that there user base is dealing with now, in order to make their distro more useful (and less annoying) in day-to-day usage.  * Which isn't to pass judgement on either the old or the new metaphor - just pointing out that there is a massive gap between them, and many people find it difficult to switch between them."

linuxmint,3duh9b,glesialo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:55:42 2015 UTC,so perhaps it's tied to the graphics driver? i'm using an AMD system but your problem sounds similar to mine. never had the issue on 17.1 though.

What hardware do you have installed, and are you regularly importing abnormal ppa's? What errors are you seeing?  As far as Mint vs Ubuntu updates, I would guess that you're going to see much the same experience. Mint 17-17.2 is based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and Ubuntu has level 1-5 updates installed by default. Any problems you are getting are likely upstream of Mint itself.  Debian might give you some relief, but since Ubuntu and Mint are Debian derivatives, it's just as likely that it won't.  If you could post some of the errors you're seeing, or what software you have installed we can probably give you some direct help, but until then it's just a guessing game really."

My current problem today is GRUB Bootloader still boots up fine at first, then I get to the screen where I'm prompted to enter my password to mount the encrypted volume. I enter the correct password and get the confirmation message of ""cryptsetup: sda3_crypt set up successfully"" then all hard disk activity stops, and the boot doesn't proceed any further.  I also tried using the advanced startup options to boot into recovery mode. Once again, I am prompted for my password to mount encrypted sda3, this time in the terminal command line. I enter the correct password, volume is mounted, and recovery mode proceeds briefly, then stops.

How to fix that, I'm not really sure.  My guess, since you've indicated that the problem occurs following a system update, is that something was borked between the old version and the new version of cryptsetup, which I don't have any experience in. Maybe post again asking for help with encrypted disks not mounting properly?"

It's interesting to see someone having the exact same problem with Ubuntu 14.04. I think that answers whether I would have better luck on Ubuntu. This still makes me more curious about Debian. From what I've heard, it's actually common for Ubuntu to release all kinds of updates that aren't tested well and will break a system. I've also heard that Debian is one of the most stable, reliable distros out there. Maybe I will give more thought to Debian after I resolve this issue."

I've tried to mount the encrypted partition with the 17.2 live usb that I installed with, and it gives an error message trying to mount it.

linuxmint,3d2afg,jollyn,3,Sun Jul 12 23:13:27 2015 UTC,That's one thing I really like about Linux. It's fully is customizable. That's what open source is really about. Something you don't like. You either can change things without to much fuss. Without changing the whole package/libraries arrangements. Or go hog wild and go as extreme you want for that prefect look and feel.

Now: some things, you must admit, are hard to get how you want on Linux - at least without quite a lot of knowledge. Moreover, some thing that just work, at least fairly well and most of the time, on other operating systems, require some or even a lot of fiddling on Linux. But, yes, when you get there, it is worth it.  Pretty much the only thing that is stopping me from putting my main desktop on Linux - and thus gaining the customisabiity, the speed, and the reduced malware and privacy worries - is that Linux office suites are (1) not that great, (2) are insufficiently compatible - despite some claims to the contrary - with Microsoft Office. That's a deal breaker for me. EDIT: My screenshots have icons for MS Office applications. Those are 2003 versions of Office programmes, and they run under Wine - and not perfectly but, admittedly, fairly well. So that's some mitigation for what I said a line or two above."

Never heard a fuss open them up at all, from anybody. Including Windows users.  There are a few exceptions. But, to get around any of them is use something like wine and Microsoft Office. Like you said earlier. Or even use a online Web-application Office Suite to fit your needs.  The key for me to use my Linux Office Suites.

There are no other outputs available at the moment on this device. Mini HDMI is available but I got rid of the cable I had for it as I thought I didn't need it.  2) I don't believe the issue is caused by the batteries, since moving the receiver over to my windows system causes the keyboard to work perfectly from across the room (Non LOS) rather than in a very narrow range like it does in linux. There's a chance it could be something to do with interference now that I'm thinking about it, since this area's pretty well saturated at this point, what with wireless internet, cell phones, and 2 logitech dongles to contend with.  3) the new build is linux mint only  4) All updates have been done, first thing I do after a new install, no extra drivers installed (none available)   5) None that would interfere with/conflict with the default setup as far as I'm aware.  6) I""m aware, that's why I chose this rather than mucking around with arch linux/redhat/debian, I've used all 3 for different purposes and I like Mint's ""simplicity"" making it easier for the system to ""get out of the way"" and let me do what I want with the system  7) Will do, as soon as I can find some time to tinker with the system, which will hopefully be some point this weekend or early next week"

You could try to purge the package (if it doesn't try to take many other packages with it) and reinstall it if you think it's just a minor downloading glitch."

linuxmint,3cc0ws,ThinkerB,2,Mon Jul 6 19:05:57 2015 UTC,"What model thinkpad? What hardware in it? Switchable graphics, perchance?  If so, install Bumblebee.  If not: does the fan turn on at all?"
linuxmint,3cc0ws,paulmccarkey,2,Mon Jul 6 20:49:37 2015 UTC,Follow up to this... Did it get hot before Linux Mint?
linuxmint,3cc0ws,xod1ak,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:53:10 2015 UTC,Always a good question!
linuxmint,3cc0ws,paulmccarkey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:55:43 2015 UTC,"No, it did not. How can I see if my fan is on?"
linuxmint,3cc0ws,xod1ak,2,Mon Jul 6 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"Well on most laptops, when it's running and fan is on you can feel the air coming out of the side or the bottom of the laptop.    I had an older HP Elitebook that would get hot every few months. I would look at the bottom and see the fan intake caked with dust. Just needed to shopvac / vacuum out the dust and it fixed it for a while.    Your situation might be more complicated. Make sure that fan is running first. Also install some kind of temperature monitor for the panel. Like lm sensors. (I might get pointing you to not the best one)  http://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/lm-sensors"

linuxmint,3c97pg,xo-metal,7,Mon Jul 6 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"I've used both but favor Xfce. To be honest, though, I hardly notice. 80%of my time is spent in a browser, and the rest in terminal or file manager. I could be using Unity or Open box and it wouldn't matter..."
linuxmint,3c97pg,merelyjim,4,Mon Jul 6 02:44:25 2015 UTC,Yeah. That's what I should do. I obsess over themes and window title bars for some reason. I probably need some sort of help. :)
linuxmint,3c97pg,merelyjim,4,Mon Jul 6 02:53:13 2015 UTC,Take a look at Openbox. It's almost a blank slate...  A few screenshots of what the guys did with CrunchBang will really hook you!  (I feel like I just handed a pyro some matches and gasoline and told him to have fun.)
linuxmint,3c97pg,dryh2o,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:07:41 2015 UTC,Oh boy. I'll give it a try in VM. Thanks.
linuxmint,3c97pg,IThoughtYouGNU,3,Mon Jul 6 11:32:30 2015 UTC,"I like them both. I used to use XFCE but a but when custom hotkeys (an inability to change ALT+F4) was frustrating me so I looked at Mate. I liked it. It feels similar to XFCE. I just want simple, clean and quick."
linuxmint,3c97pg,multia-z,2,Mon Jul 6 06:32:35 2015 UTC,Xfce.
linuxmint,3c97pg,archieboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:45:01 2015 UTC,mate..on debian or 17.2 but preferably LMDE.. I have both. JIC
linuxmint,3c97pg,xod1ak,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:58:41 2015 UTC,"I use mate. It was either that or cinammon, I never tried xfce for some reason.  I love mate--it's simple and snappy. Although I miss hot corners and the ability to snap windows on either half of the screen."
linuxmint,3c97pg,archieboy,2,Mon Jul 6 12:01:34 2015 UTC,Mate in Mint 17.2 has snapping to half screen. May depend on what Compiz settings you have enabled. But I just tried it out.

linuxmint,3c97pg,calexil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:40:29 2015 UTC,It works perfectly. Thanks for the tip!
linuxmint,3c97pg,ptyblog,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:52:36 2015 UTC,I like mate most because for me it feels more solid. i don't have any evidence it being better or more robust. it just feels solid for me. solid as in solid looking not more stable.
