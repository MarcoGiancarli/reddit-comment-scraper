DestinyFashion,3dldgw,GentlemenQuinn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's very unlikely.

DestinyFashion,3dk6ld,TravelerHD,2,Thu Jul 16 22:55:54 2015 UTC,"I second this. I've always liked primarily-white shaders with Sunbreakers, and Million Million fits the bill perfectly. More of an off-white than Chatterwhite, and a bit of depth to it thanks to the other colors."
DestinyFashion,3dk6ld,pyro-guy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:16 2015 UTC,Sunsetting and Aaru's Passage both look great with sunbreakers. Bonus badassery for using the Bond of the Exile warlock class item with it as well.

DestinyFashion,3dkdwr,QuantumVexation,2,Thu Jul 16 23:50:12 2015 UTC,"Yes! Totally agree with this. I was looking back at all my clips from the past 10 months and the gear really shows my character's progression. At this point, she really looks like a legend, with gear from her exploits in the Crucible, from braving the Vault of Glass, following in the footsteps of the proud Praxic Order, with a newfound interest in Osiris and his search for answers. Even the color of her armor is proof of her conquering the Prison of Elders. (I wish I could incorporate some CE armor but it doesn't really go with other sets, unfortunately)  Pre-launch, Bungie was talking about how they wanted your gear to tell a story and I really think they accomplished that goal.  EDIT: It doesn't look like I have any third-person footage pre-VoG, but here's my Warlock during an early Iron Banner, when she was still struggling to earn a name for herself."
DestinyFashion,3dkdwr,Ziikh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:14:47 2015 UTC,Looking at your early Iron Banner armour. Look just like me at the Level 28/29 era. It's nice to see such a similar path walked by others :D  Edit: and can I say you have excellent taste in weapons.
DestinyFashion,3dkdwr,Ziikh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:42:48 2015 UTC,"Oh hey you're the person who won the contest here! Nice!  Yeah, I love those weapons. VoC was my first raid primary (I looked back at my raid history the other day and it looks like I got it on my second run through the Vault). It's gotten me through every endgame activity, countless Nightfalls, and has pretty much always been in my primary slot since I got it. It's super powerful, versatile, and just really fun to use (plus there's just something about having a solar primary as a Sunsinger). I was overjoyed when I found out you could ascend gear in HoW. I missed using it in TDB and it was the first weapon I used Etheric Light on.   Found Verdict was my first raid weapon ever. I remember thinking it was cool but that I'd probably never use it much because I never used shotguns. Oh was I wrong. It was my preferred PvP special for a little while but still didn't see much use. After the PvE shotgun buff, it's been my go-to special for all activities. That thing tears through yellow-bar enemies like nothing else.  Gjallarhorn is Gjallarhorn. Not much else needs to be said haha"

These represent different material types (can't remember which is which though)  So our Warlock robes are made of a cloth substance, where as Titan armour is Plasteel Plating, or in other words a Metally Plastic substance. So I'm sure you'll notice your Warlock helmet looks similar to Titan armour, but it's more about finding a shader that looks good with robes and the cloth like substance they're made of."

To be honest, I was willing to pay $40 for the next expansion happily. I didn't even care for the emotes. The way they've addressed the whole thing though for those who feel like they're missing out on some of the extra stuff made me realize just how they look at us, as consumers and how they only care for the money.   I've stopped playing Destiny completely and I don't think I'll play it anymore, so I feel you. It all depends on how they try and fix this. I'm waiting on the Weekly Update to make my decision"

So bad news is we can't get it currently unless you want to run hundreds of ROC strikes in hopes of a lucky engram (it's the only way to get TDB vendor gear AFAIK). Good news is the New Monarchy gear in TTK looks to be modeled after TDB gear (for instance, the Titan gear has the fur like TDB Vendor set), so if we're lucky they'll sell the pelt chest."

Old favs -   Titan - Full VoG set - will ascend this once I have enough e-light - in The Hanged Man  Hunter - CE boots, VoG chest, VoG helm, IB gauntlets, Frumious cloak - in Revenant  Warlock - Voidfang vestments, VoG gauntlets and legs, either IB helm or VoG helm - in bittersteel  now it's something like this -   Titan - PoE arms and chest with ascended VoG legs and inmost light helmet with Revenant  Hunter - CE legs ascended, ToO Vest of the Exile, PoE gauntlets, Celestial nighthawk, Cloak of the exile (so happy it dropped for me, never taking it off) in The Hanged Man  Warlock - The Ram, PoE chest, VoG arms and boots (to be ascended) in Bittersteel"
