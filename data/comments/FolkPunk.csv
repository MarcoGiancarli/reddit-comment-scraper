FolkPunk,3e3q56,stephystarwars69,4,Tue Jul 21 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question for other people to answer for you, you know? I've been with my girlfriend since I was 16 (21 now) and my band started up when I was around 19. That's definitely caused some issues for both parties but I've always done my best to keep everyone happy. It is difficult because sometimes there is just no way to keep both parties happy, and that seems to be the situation you are in. If possible I'd try to find a way to compromise but if not, that's a a very personal call for someone else to make for you. I don't know if that helps at all, but hopefully everything works out for you!"
FolkPunk,3e151i,daysndaze,2,Tue Jul 21 03:52:05 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah! Hope to see you homies at the last leg of the tour!

FolkPunk,3dy7q7,PLKCeric,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:56 2015 UTC,"Heyyy, are you the one who wrote this?  Because that guide series is nice, I'm keeping it in mind while I try to struggle through the trenches of being in a ""local-level"" band.  Either way, this is a sick cover, good job, man."
FolkPunk,3dy7q7,Urplescurple,2,Tue Jul 21 04:25:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did write that- thanks! I'm glad bands are getting good use out of my past mistakes lol. And thanks for the kind words about the cover too!"
FolkPunk,3dy7q7,harmonyparkinglot,2,Tue Jul 21 13:13:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, man. I like this."

FolkPunk,3durl0,cocoscoffee,4,Sun Jul 19 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"Woah, I didn't know Jeffery Lewis still played. I would love to see this video!"
FolkPunk,3durl0,NotnekNotEver,3,Sun Jul 19 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"Ditto on both counts, I had no idea he was still out making music."
FolkPunk,3durl0,typhoidgrievous,2,Sun Jul 19 20:39:24 2015 UTC,I had no idea he was playing and was completely floored when I wandered over to merch and saw his comics. I didn't think I'd catch him this summer. Here is What would Pussy Riot do? Excuse the first missing lines...  He released this in May though it was about the L train on the nyc subway being shitty. He opened with it and it was perfect. haha   Enjoy!
FolkPunk,3du5nr,thraddest,2,Sun Jul 19 14:30:54 2015 UTC,I wouldn't consider Elliot Smith folk-punk but I still love his music.
