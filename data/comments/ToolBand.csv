ToolBand,3e0rw6,VegasSaint9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:45:43 2015 UTC,Yeah it does this on purpose. This is how they introduce you to new music to expand your channel with. I've discovered tons of new bands this way. If you don't like the stuff its playing for you then just down vote it.

ToolBand,3e0rw6,VegasSaint9,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:43 2015 UTC,"You can customize how Pandora treats your stations through the thumbs up and thumbs down.  When you thumbs up songs it tends to expand the characteristics to include what is in that song.    So if you want a really focused station that sticks to a pretty specific genre or sound, dont use the thumbs up very often and be really liberal with the thumbs down.  If instead you want a station to help you discover new artists you might like, use the thumbs up a lot and only thumbs down stuff you really dislike."

I'm hoping for at least a Spring 2016 album release date, and anything in between would be gold. I'm praying that we get some good news soon. I mean I feel like they may try to leave a trail of breadcrumbs, but at times its too vague. Like they show Joe Baressi and then Maynard says he still hasn't received music to write for back in like late May. Maynard is quick (apparently) so thats good, but they could still be working on the instrumentals of it all so far.  I'm curious how long they have actually been working on this album. It seems like between 2006-2010 not much, and maybe not too much until last year even. I'm sure they've had a lot of jams to sample from to make new music. I'm sure the album will be good, but I hope this one has been cooking for a while and they create the best they could at this stage. Just praying for any type of hint at a release sometime soon."

I like the simplicity of ""To be son to an angel, what have I done?"" You and any other Tool fans will know the rest immediately, anyone else can assume. Unless your mother is dead, in which case it might seem like you feel guilty about it.  If that's the case maybe split it up between two sentences. ""To be son to angel, what have I done."" and ""To be worthy, what have I done.""   Depending on your relationship with your mother, religious/spiritual background, etc the image could be just about anything. Angel motif seems like the obvious answer, but imho it's a little on the nose (literal). Try to find something personal to you and personal to her as well."

ToolBand,3dwpit,Zenarchist,3,Mon Jul 20 11:42:00 2015 UTC,"I asked /u/Zenarchist the same thing and he had a wealth of insight to share. Here's our conversation:   ME: Hi there! Sorry to bug you, but you seem like you know more than the average person does about Thelema and mystical things. I have a quick question regarding the Star of Babalon.. It's a really cool symbol and Tool has used it a lot in the past several years, but would it be a bad idea to get it as a tattoo? Just the heptagram part, not the other Thelemic symbols. I don't want to open the door to a whole myriad of bad vibrations I do not understand..  ZENARCHIST: The seal itself (with the Thelemic frills), is Crowley's homage to the Goddess Babalon, the highest archetype of woman. Gematrically, Babalon (BBLN is 156 -> 12 -> 3, the sphere of Binah, Wisdom. 77+((7+7)/7)+77 = 156, see above. And in the centre is a visica pisces, which (for obvious reasons) symoblizes a cunt. As Binah/Babalon is one of the Supernals (Keter, Chokmah, Binah) of the Tree of Life, it is not only the ultimate feminine archetype, but also that which is closes to the masculine archetype. In as such, the Binah can act like Jungs dun dunn daaaa Anima. It's a cool Sigil all up, but without the extra frills, it's just a heptagram (which is, in its own right/rite a fairly important symbol). It's not inherently a ""bad idea"" to get a symbol tattooed on to you, but it's a good idea to know what you are getting tattooed. Think of it like the Magick version of getting Chinese characters tattoos. You might think it means ""Triumphant Power"", but it might actually mean ""Piss and vomit"". Although, unlike Chinese characters - and only if you believe in Sigils as more than just cool graphics - it won't be foreign girls laughing at you, it could be, it might be foreign entities changing your will. Feel free to drop me a line if you have any more Questions, or if i didn't actually answer the one you already asked.  ME: Wow, you answered my question far better than I had expected. So my next question involves the meaning behind the heptagram. I've read a lot about it and it is a very widely used symbol, but the general idea I have found is that the symbol represents universal connectedness and the power of love (according to Kabbalistic teachings). Then again, some sources say it is linked to normalcy and the mundane. My question is, what does Tool's heptagram symbolize? They have it on shirts, posters, even on stage.. I assume they align it with the Kabbalistic representation, but then maybe it's more aligned to Thelema thanks to Danny and represents Babalon who symbolizes understanding (???). Sorry for the rambling, I would just really hate to open a can of worms that I do not comprehend all because of a stupid mistake I made. It's all just incredibly complex and leaves me with more questions than answers. Also, do you think you could point me in the direction of some good resources to learn about all this stuff? I've started with some Crowley but I'm not quite sure where to go from there, which is a real shame because all of this is so intriguing. Thanks again!  ZENARCHIST: That's a tough question that I can't really answer. Broadly, the heptagram means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Yes, it's the basis of Crowley's seal of BABALON, but it's also an important symbol in Enochian ritual, Alchemical works, and Theurgy. More broadly, the number 7 is significant in even more esoteric fields (numerology, astrology, kabbalah, druidism, etc). But I'm not sure it's any of those things. I could be very wrong about this, but I think it has more to do with cymatics. If you take a circular resonator and play a G through it, you'll get a perfect heptagram. Depending on the relationship in size to the resonator and wavelength of the frequency, you'll even get a little visica pisces forming in the centre (BBLN much?). If you are familiar with Freemasonry, you might know the importance of G. Danny isn't a Freemason, but his father was. Being familiar with Freemasonry, Danny knows that the G is Freemasonry doesn't stand for ""God"" (a common misconception), but Geometry. This Geometry is otherwise known as Sacred Geometry, and described the building blocks of the universe. TL;DR: TOOL's geometry is a sybol for Geometry. Go figure."

But here's this from /u/ToolArchive   While most of Maynard's lyrics including this one are syncretic and heavily layered, one of the best guesses people have come up for this particular lyric line is that it's alluding to the alchemical process, the transmutation of lead into gold (also found in The Grudge, ""transmutate these leaden grudges into gold""). The whole song, as mentioned by Danny, has a very ""evolutionary"" vibe to it, if I remember correctly he said it feels to him as if it promotes human evolution/transmutation/growth. The color stages of alchemical transmutation: Black - Nigredo White - Albedo Red - Rubedo Yellow - Citrinitas"

So you can end up with images that don't look altered very much, depending on how they originally looked. Other ones attempt to see shapes, and where they do, draw that shape over and over. So you end up with a lot of dogs/eyes/pagodas for example because the image set that algorithm was trained to ""see"" things on used a lot of images of those things as training material.  /r/deepdream by the way."

ToolBand,3djf4w,sin-eater82,2,Fri Jul 17 02:59:47 2015 UTC,"i should have worded that better. i think the ratio of music to vocals will be greater than previous records. (which i guess is kind of the same thing, seeing as they pretty much max out a CD's runtime).   it just seems like with each new album the musical passages get longer and the vocals are less of the anchor of the songs and in turn there are less of them.  i've never done the math or anything it's just how each album feels to me and i may be totally off base. we'll see i guess."
ToolBand,3djf4w,dullknives,2,Fri Jul 17 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha.  Yeah, I agree about that trend.  Although I feel that Lateralus may have had more instrumental only stuff than 10k days.  Though I have really looked into it.  The non-vocal parts of D/R/T alone really add up."
ToolBand,3djf4w,sin-eater82,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:56:41 2015 UTC,I feel like that's less of Maynards decision than it is Dannys. Most of the long instrumental parts are ethnic or tribal polyrhythmic drum passages that he's exploring.

ToolBand,3djf4w,HeIsntMe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:40:15 2015 UTC,You're listening to it in the wrong order!
ToolBand,3djf4w,jfinster,6,Fri Jul 17 04:41:17 2015 UTC,Maybe? You might just have different taste.  For me Ænima and Lateralus are their two greatest works so far.  Edit: I mean the albums.
ToolBand,3djf4w,Beezer-12,2,Sat Jul 18 00:35:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but 10,000 days is one of the most beautiful songs ever composed. IMO"
ToolBand,3djf4w,stthicket,3,Fri Jul 17 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that 10K is not amazing, because it truly is, but I'm saying that there's not as much passion as the previous albums. The tunes are very polished and ""commercial""."
ToolBand,3djf4w,spinblackcircles,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"See I just don't see anything commercial about Rosetta stoned or wings for Marie, even compared to earlier tool songs. The pot, vicarious and right in two are relatively commercial but the rest of the album is decidedly not."
ToolBand,3djf4w,Djs3634,-1,Fri Jul 17 05:31:55 2015 UTC,I'd say one of the tunes (vicarious) is very commercial.  I also thought right in two was  cheesy.
ToolBand,3djf4w,Demioch92,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:19:54 2015 UTC,"We all have a different favorite album and different favorite songs.

I'd rather them release an awesome record every 5-10 years than put out an annual shitbucket (with one or two jewels) like so many other bands do--fuck that noise. They have lives to live outside of Tool, and they live their lives. That's why they're able to put so much depth into their work, because they don't dilute it by being a music factory.  And you're going to say that 10K Days wasn't awesome. Ok, cool, that's your opinion. I thought it was and enjoy listening to it. Nothing compares to Lateralus and AEnima, IMO, but every artist has their magnum opi--doesn't mean the rest is crap. I don't like Opiate a whole lot; but I still respect it.  Be Patient."
ToolBand,3djf4w,the_classicist,5,Thu Jul 16 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"Dude, I love 10,000 Days. There's a lot of diversity between the songs. The guitar work is great. The drums are pretty amazing. I probably listened to it every day for a good  six months after it was released and still listen to it pretty regularly. That's why I remain so excited for the next record, to see where they're able to go next."

There are allways two sides and he knows his side very well. Your own willpower is only so much worth if the others is not, its going to fail.

ToolBand,3djm8t,aatigah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:50:46 2015 UTC,not sure of the exact source.
ToolBand,3djm8t,StopThrottle,2,Tue Jul 21 10:20:53 2015 UTC,"To be honest. I dont know why tool fans worship this guy. Sure he's talented but he is not the best rock singer, nor even best ""modern"" rock singer. His lyrics are good, but without the music leading him he wouldn't write great lyrics. He's great at what he does for the specific sound that makes up Tool. But I'd argue that Pete Loeffler of Chevelle is the better all around musician.  The genius behind the band has always been danny carey, he's the one who taught adam about playing polyrhythms, playing in odd times. Justin can do some melodic stuff on a bass but that isn't unheard of in the world of bass guitar guru-ship. Them as a ensemble is incredible, but take away one part (notably danny) and they aren't so special. Although that cant be said for every band, most bands have very replaceable members. Their genius is their ensemble. Maynard recognizes this which is why he stands back in the shadows. It's all about the music, and thats why most of us tool fans love em so much. Little to no rock star pretentious BS from these guys, just pure art and rock combined with emotion and musicianship."
ToolBand,3djm8t,StopThrottle,2,Sat Jul 18 04:15:38 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of very interesting ""prog rock"" bands out there with many very talented musicians. The reason why Maynard is so valuable is that he is able to put lyrics to match this complicated and long-winded set of sounds. Other singers in this position often succumb to using a low pitch semi-yell/growling voice which ends up muddying the final product. In addition, Maynard sings with lyrics with highly symbolic or interpretive effect to them which compliments the sounds and adds to the longevity of the song. This kind of relationship is rare in the music world is why they have had such a huge impact."

Since the fabric tails create two channels, I was also trying to represent kundalini energy rising (two channels, snaky movements, an uncoiling in the beginning, the chakras on the costume).

TOOL has always been great live even if Maynard does weird shit or you can't see him the whole show, the lighting, the cinematic presentation and the pure ambient experience makes the show worth it.    EDIT: So I noticed that they added one more TBA to day two of monstermashaz, not that The Crue is a band I would put on the roster if I had 3 wishes, but now I kinda want them as one, just so I can compare.

I saw them twice that tour, and the first time pretty much the exact same thing happened (Virginia Beach, VA).

At that point of my life I had joined the Australian Navy and was at Wagga Wagga NSW doing some training. Me and my friend couldn't get the next day off work and told our bosses ""we'll we're driving to this gig regardless or not if we get the day off"". (Ironically our leave was denied because it was too dangerous to work all day and drive 5 hours to a gig, watch for two hours then drive back for 5 hours) then start work again but they admitted they couldn't stop us.    So after work we jumped in the car with our girlfriends and drove 4 4-5 hours to Melbourne (in another state) where they were playing. Watched their set which was fucking amazing then proceeded to drive back home. Couldn't do any drugs but still had an amazing time none the less. The next day at work was... interesting."

I'm the same age, '01 was my senior year and despite hearing TOOL on MTV over the years, it hadn't quite clicked yet.. I was listening at a very young age and it wasn't until my later teens that I heard Undertow again and it clicked.  Anyway, I went to the second leg of the Lateralus tour, once at the Arco in Sacto and once in Fresno, both in '02. It was fan-fucking-tastic and although the rest of the shows have been somewhat of a blur, I've been to 8-9 shows since that first Lateralus trip. Holy fucking shit."

ToolBand,3d6eee,bodine77,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:50:26 2015 UTC,"Then clearly, being a ""digital outlet"" is not the issue.  See, Pandora would identify the similarities and differences and tell you what they like/dislike about each specific model."
ToolBand,3d6eee,bodine77,8,Tue Jul 14 03:20:00 2015 UTC,"It's different. If you listen to Pandora you can hope to hear Tool, but it's going to be mixed in amongst a bunch of other artists Pandora decides to play for you. If they were on Spotify, you could go in a queue up an entire Tool album and it wouldn't make you listen to anything else. With Pandora it's getting them exposure to potential new fans without allowing those new fans to have their entire catalog available to them at their whim for free."
ToolBand,3d6eee,Muramasan,-8,Mon Jul 13 22:57:23 2015 UTC,Spotify has a radio option as well where it just plays random bands and types of music.
ToolBand,3d6eee,fyndor,7,Mon Jul 13 23:01:36 2015 UTC,"But I think Spotify uses the same catalog of music for their radio feature. It's using an algorithm to select the playlist for you, but all the songs on that playlist come from the same catalog that's available to listen to on demand for free. So I believe Tool would have to allow Spotify to make their songs available on demand in order to get their songs on Spotify radio, and making them available on demand removes some incentive for you to buy the album."
ToolBand,3d6eee,gardner7001,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:47:53 2015 UTC,Yea but you don't have to use it where Pandora you do.
ToolBand,3d6eee,MrSaladFork,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:08:10 2015 UTC,That's not how they would see it and no I'm sure they get compensated the same as everyone.  Pandora is just a radio service.  They put their music on the radio.  If you want to listen to the entire album you need to buy the actual album artwork and all.  Right or wrong that is how they want to share their art.
ToolBand,3d6eee,jacktheBOSS,8,Tue Jul 14 04:48:38 2015 UTC,"Tool has been outspoken in the past on their resistance to digital music outlets.  I believe I read their objection to platforms like iTunes was that it encourages people to listen to music in pieces and not an album as a whole (beginning to end in the context of the art/packaging they've worked so hard to present their work in).  This is similar to the reason Led Zeppelin has not embraced all digital platforms.  I think in Maynard's AMA, someone asked him why he was against his music on iTunes.  He responded with something along the lines of ""I'm not against my music on iTunes, Puscifer is available on iTunes.  Don't confuse Tool's position with mine.  Tool as a whole does not want their music on iTunes.""  I may be adding or curtailing that- I read it a while ago and I'm too lazy too look up sources."

I've consumed so much Tool/Maynard information over the years it's hard to keep track of the source (I know, I'm sounding super reliable), but I know the information to be true.  Sorry if I got anyone's hopes up."

Part of their appeal to a lot of people, myself included, is that it's all about the art. They've never changed because music as a whole changed, they just make music how they picture their music and release it as an album, a full fledged album with a specific order of songs that adds to the album itself, with tangibility and with visuals."

ToolBand,3cybm0,Godfatha1,10,Sat Jul 11 21:53:44 2015 UTC,I always have a hard time listening to covers of Tool that aren't instrumental. No one seems to come close to what Maynard does vocally. It's not that he's a bad singer but it's almost not the right song for him to be singing. This applies to almost all their songs though.
ToolBand,3cybm0,wyntereign,3,Sat Jul 11 22:03:51 2015 UTC,"There's a tribute band called Dissectional. Their singer is fucking amazing.  I don't how they managed to find someone like that, but goddamn. Seen them twice, and 10/10 will go again."

ToolBand,3cybm0,AndrewMufasaaaa,2,Sat Jul 11 23:46:42 2015 UTC,I think this cover live by the same band is so much better.

When I found these covers my appreciation for them grew, even though I don't listen to them anymore. It's always nice when your fav band is appreciated. Also I didn't know that Tool is way more well-known in the US so for me it was like ""holy hit, they're fans too????? What a world!!!!1!!1"""

ToolBand,3cybm0,amplifyanarchy,2,Mon Jul 13 21:05:04 2015 UTC,I thought that was pretty good. I don't particularly like that they dumbed Danny's part down to a single drum...but that's ok. I was impressed that Ben could hit some of those notes....but it sounded like he got some of the words wrong...which kinda took me out of the moment. I'll have to go listen to the Sober cover now.

We are all kinds chefs, construction workers, students, teachers, and even corporate executives (yep my boss VP of a $2B year company even drops references once in a while).   When 10,000 days released I was an adult. I thought that this passion I had held from my childhood was something I held alone. But out of the woodwork they came. The fans were my friends, colleagues, and clients. People I would have never suspected and never would have asked were enthralled with the fact that their passion was alive again.   ""We are the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner. We make your bed. We guard you while you're asleep. We drive the ambulances. We direct your call.

ToolBand,3ct2lk,Audaciousdrea,6,Fri Jul 10 15:28:32 2015 UTC,One of my favorite tool songs hands down... the bassline in the song is phenomenal.
ToolBand,3ct2lk,moshspeggeti,3,Fri Jul 10 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"A great friend of mine in high school, well he was, I was a year graduated, and I talked about this song so many times when we had depression or just depression thoughts (both bipolar or major depressive depending the month..)  The last time I talked to him was smoking a bowl on a bench watching the full moon just light the pond in front. 'The moon tells me her secrets' we even listened to it while smoking.   This has been the only time someone ever corrected me on a tool lyric 'the capable of all that's inconceivable and all imaginable' part... The only person to ever do that. And in such a nice way ""I think it's actually this way but I like yours too"" And he was a hipster fleet foxes, decemberists...whatever other bands like that, animal collective, that I've never ever enjoyed listening to. Yet we had a bond from this music and more. We were going to move 2000 miles to go to a beautiful school together within a year or two.   He killed himself a few weeks later.   This song at those dark times is a neck to neck tie with the patient for me. Almost all tool songs connect to some emotion or feeling I have, but this one reflection will forever hold something so special. Even if I spiraled down and ended in a psych ward of a hospital..... It can't be beat.   Some 5-6 years later now I'm doing my best to get into that school, but it's been hard. In many ways.   Side-happy-note, that guitar screaming solo(s) in the last couple minutes are one of those goosebumps musical moments for me."
ToolBand,3ct2lk,DigitalDank19,6,Sat Jul 11 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"I remember always skipping this song because the first 4 minutes was the same thing, well the first time I listened through the whole thing, my jaw literally dropped."

I loved that song from the very first listen.. So relaxing and peaceful."

ToolBand,3co9p4,mdwvt,4,Thu Jul 9 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"This will probably make me unpopular here, but I've been disappointed the two times I saw Tool live.  The music was great, of course, and the light show was nice, but both times Maynard had pretty much no interaction with the audience.  I got the sense that he would rather not be there.  The first show, he came on stage, said ""Holy shit"" and that was it.  The rest of the show was just getting through the set, and no encore, of course.  The second show, which I had to stalk ticketmaster for to make sure I got to spend the $150 for tickets in order to make the wife happy (she's the uber-Maynard fan), he came onto the stage, didn't say anything to the crowd, did the whole show in silhouette.  They did a quick ten minute break, then came back on for two songs and left.  Pretty much just walked off the stage.  So while I enjoy the music, I'd never pay to see Tool live again.  Puscifer, on the other hand, was a mind-blowingly awesome experience and I will attend one of those shows any time I get the chance.  NIN, while I like some of the music, isn't really my thing, so I can't really compare.  I saw them once at a music festival (I'm from New Orleans, so it's not really hard to catch Trent when he's playing), and it probably wasn't the best venue to experience him, so I reserve judgment of NIN as a live act."
ToolBand,3co9p4,depcrestwood,2,Thu Jul 9 23:54:40 2015 UTC,"Damn that sounds shitty, maybe you just caught them on bad days, but I see what you're saying. Shelling out 150 dollars for tickets and being disappointed in your experience... that sucks."

My wife (for whom I can't count how many times she's seen them live) swears every other show she's been to has been amazing and Maynard was cool with the crowd.  So I probably just had bad luck.  Still, I won't be rushing to throw money at another show."
ToolBand,3co9p4,depcrestwood,3,Sat Jul 11 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that's aactually a really tough one for me...  I love both of them live and they both have AMAZING stage presence. I've seen both probably 1/2 a dozen times each and I'd see either of them many times again.   I think tool is now my favorite band and I definitely look forward to a new tool album before even thinking about new NIN but as far as live acts.....ugh that's a tough fucking call!"
ToolBand,3co9p4,codevii,3,Thu Jul 9 20:14:54 2015 UTC,Tool and NIN need to do a show together damnit. a freaking 6 hour event. I'd honestly pay $200 bucks to see that.

That being said when they finally hit the stage, Axl was perfectly coked (or whatever-ed) up.

ToolBand,3cp2ih,OMEGA5_,2,Thu Jul 9 19:53:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Maynard's mom passed near the same time as mine, so it's less about having a bottle of that brand and more about having that specific wine."
ToolBand,3cp2ih,randomdross,2,Thu Jul 9 20:10:02 2015 UTC,I figured it might be more sentimental rather than the wine. I'm sorry. Honestly I'd say your best bet is to call the shop in Jerome and see what they have. It will be spendy but you might get lucky.

The final product is very recognizable, fluent drumming, although to him it is much more: the official Tool website claims that Danny uses drumming as a ritual similar to occult rituals,[2] with purposes varying from spiritual exploration to ""a gateway [which] summoned a daemon he has contained...that has been delivering short parables similar to passages within The Book of Lies"". Another geometric reference from the website was the inclusion of Nothing in This Book Is True... by Bob Frissell on the band's recommended reading list, a book that deals with sacred geometry and the evolution of human consciousness."

Without studying the qabalah the book will appear insulting to the reader. Its liber number is 333 which is the number identified with the abyss and dispersion. There are 91 chapters each corresponding to the significance of the number within the cipher  The book itself is intended to be a full microcosm on the basics of magick , mysticism and the death of the adept reborn as a magister templi having transcended the abyss.  I picked it up for the first time 6 years ago. Adopted Thelema about a year later, and began communicating with my so called ""daemon"" or ""HGA""  since late 2011.  I would highly recommend studying hermetic qabalah, thelema, and the occult in general before jumping right into the book of lies. Otherwise it will read as complete jibberish and can be misleading.   Crowley wrote some chapters to intentionally decieve the reader on the principles of magick.  edit: changed Converted to adopted.

ToolBand,3cm1mh,0fxgvn,3,Thu Jul 9 02:51:28 2015 UTC,Easily danny. He is the most friendly and has been around longer than justin who would be the runner up.
ToolBand,3cm1mh,outcast151,3,Thu Jul 9 05:49:26 2015 UTC,Justin! He seems like a super cool dude. Plus I want to see that pedal board/setup up close or hear him talk about it.
ToolBand,3cm1mh,King_Paradox,7,Thu Jul 9 13:18:33 2015 UTC,"Paul D'Amour.    I'd ask him how it felt to have once been a member of the greatest band of all time. I'd ask him that in ten minutes intervals till he sobbed. While playing Lateralus in the background. On repeat. With a head full of LSD. And wall-to-wall pictures of Alex Grey. Maybe a Tim Leary album speaking overtop the instrumental transition tracks... ... ... Suddenly this has become a very fun day spent with Paul, as I pat him on the back whilst he weeps naked in fetal position, regretting decisions he can't unmake.    Good band indeed. Cheers."
ToolBand,3cm1mh,HelloImCarter,2,Thu Jul 9 05:02:36 2015 UTC,Best answer to any question ever! Ladies and gents.... We have a true TOOL fan here!!!
ToolBand,3cm1mh,toolfantillidie,2,Sat Jul 11 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"No one of them.. Social anxiety is a bitch. I probably couldn't even get up to one of them and say hello.  Plus, I feel like if I do manage it I would bring up the Tool subject quite soon, and they possibly don't like talking about the band.  And also my English is shit."
ToolBand,3cm1mh,Demioch92,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:25:46 2015 UTC,"dude, the band is a huge part of their lives. Of course they're going to want to talk about it."
ToolBand,3cm1mh,king_radical,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:32:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know.. I feel like Maynard himself would rather talk about wine, Puscifer and other stuff, and I don't know anything about either to start a conversation about these topics.  As for the other band members, I would have a better chance talking to them about the band than Maynard, but I still get the feeling they get a lot of questions about Tool on interviews and stuff and after a while it gets annoying.  Still, none of that matters when I don't even have the courage to talk to people. As I said I probably wouldn't even be able to start talking to them."
ToolBand,3cm1mh,Demioch92,2,Mon Jul 13 04:40:07 2015 UTC,"Adam no doubt, since I saw an interview where he is asked how tool was created and he answered "" I met maynard and... ehm.. tool"" totally owned me."

We talked about video games, movies, some art he was working on, and some reminiscing about old times with his friends (I was there as a guest of one of his friends).

ToolBand,3cm1mh,tell_me_im_funny,4,Thu Jul 9 01:22:55 2015 UTC,Why would one have no interest in the direct architects of such great music? They're not affiliated with the band for no reason. They most certainly have some amazing good stories to tell.
ToolBand,3cm1mh,ChiXiStigma,2,Thu Jul 9 06:03:56 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for anyone else, but my own path of fangirl obsession with bands was intense while I was a teenager. I needed to know every last public and private detail that was available. Then as I was getting a degree in music I started to realize that we're all just people, and my obsession with needing to know what brand of toilet paper Trent Reznor used faded fairly quickly. Now I'll pay attention if an artist I enjoy is talking about their art, but even then my interest is fleeting. More than anything what interests me is when artists get into the music theory side of things. I don't care so much about what the art meant to the artist. I care much more about what the art means to me."
ToolBand,3cm1mh,tell_me_im_funny,3,Thu Jul 9 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"I get all that, but hanging out with a member of a band is far different than glorifying them or putting them on a pedestal.  I agree with you tho. We're all just people. It always bothers me when people say 'NO thats not what the song means. Maynard said it means this' The song means different things to each person, and that's kinda the beauty of it."

However, I personally would not care to hang out with any of them. In all realty, famous people, while appreciating thier fans, do not care do be around them either. This especially true for Maynard. What  irony it must be for him. He completely hates even the idea of idolizing yet he is idolized by so many. He sees himself for what he is, a person. While everyone who wants to ""meet him"" sees him as a GOD! It must be irritating."

ToolBand,3c7eod,Andorion,6,Sun Jul 5 16:25:01 2015 UTC,so the kid blew off say half of each thumb. meaning he has a total of 9 fingers now. a 9 fingered kid was going to have a concert on 7/3/15. 9+7+3+15 = 34 weeks until release  ...or something like that
ToolBand,3c7eod,MatticusXII,5,Sun Jul 5 21:02:54 2015 UTC,9+7+3+2015 = 2034 weeks should be accurate
ToolBand,3c7eod,Puzzlio,7,Mon Jul 6 08:43:24 2015 UTC,Who's got no thumbs and appeared in a tool newspost?  THIS GU... Uh... Oh.
