KimmySchmidt,3e0v3v,the_eric,3,Tue Jul 21 02:26:05 2015 UTC,Had to look up what tf you were talking about.  Na.
KimmySchmidt,3dilhn,CuriousPeterSF,44,Thu Jul 16 15:50:42 2015 UTC,The Goddess of Emmy Noms for the Richly Deserving used up all her juju on Tatiana Maslany.
KimmySchmidt,3dilhn,PoopOnGod,8,Thu Jul 16 16:20:21 2015 UTC,"And although I love Ellie, I'm OK with this! It's been a long time coming."
KimmySchmidt,3dilhn,MyTherapistSays,20,Thu Jul 16 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"Lead Actress in a Comedy is one of the toughest categories.   And it doesn't matter anyway, since everyone's losing to Julia Louis Dreyfus."
KimmySchmidt,3dilhn,Downbound92,7,Thu Jul 16 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"Not necessary... Amy Schumer has a chance.  Also, it matters because a nod is a recognition. Gosh, they nominated Lily Tomlin instead!"
KimmySchmidt,3dilhn,Tschaet,2,Thu Jul 16 18:56:40 2015 UTC,They probably should too.  Veep is fucking hilarious and Julia kills that role.
KimmySchmidt,3dilhn,VanceWorley,13,Fri Jul 17 17:23:18 2015 UTC,I thought people came for Tina Fey (as a writer) and Ellie Kemper as the lead. Perhaps I was mistaken.  The field is not impossibly strong either. Other than JLD and the 2 Amys there are still 3 spots left!
KimmySchmidt,3dilhn,whiskeytango55,13,Thu Jul 16 16:54:25 2015 UTC,"Amy Schumer's riding a huge wave of buzz right now. Lily Tomlin is a legend who Emmy voters will just name-check.   Edie, Lisa, and Amy Poehler will be gone from the category next year. Ellie Kemper SHOULD get in next year."
KimmySchmidt,3dilhn,NYCHMR,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:41:37 2015 UTC,Fey didn't write. She got final say as showrunner though

KimmySchmidt,3djlsa,lunatic_minge,2,Thu Jul 16 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if Schumer doesn't get it this year with the amount of momentum she's built over the last year. She's had a tremendous amount of press. I want all the success possible for Ellie but I think she needs a bit more heat before it's going to happen over the current list of competitors. What a great problem to have, right?"
KimmySchmidt,3djlsa,andhernamewas_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:08 2015 UTC,"I am rooting for Amy Schumer to win.  Arguably, the show itself is in a more competitive category (comedy series) yet it got nominated.  I would definitely put Ellie Kemper ahead of Lisa Kudrow or Lily Tomlin. But that's just me."
KimmySchmidt,3djlsa,bit99,4,Thu Jul 16 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"I love Schumer, but I'm rooting for Poehler this year.  And next year hopefully Ellie can take Poehler's spot (since Parks and Rec is done)"
KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,fireflygal,18,Thu Jul 16 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"No, there's been many reasons pointed out as to why the universes can't coexist and the main one is that Jacqueline Voorhees and Jenna Maroney can't exist in the same universe."

Plus Hamm's character's name is a string of first names, not just ""Rev. Gary.""  The construction worker seems exactly the same, though."
KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,king_awesome,3,Thu Jul 16 11:23:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, from the Goddess herself."
KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,teaminus,2,Thu Jul 16 07:39:27 2015 UTC,"That's too bad, I think the idea of a Tina Fey universe, something like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would be hilarious and amazing."
KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,logicatch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"Me too and I don't see why Jane can't be different characters that look the same. Didn't Jenna have a doppelgänger at some point? I mean, they're comedies. It wouldn't take that much effort to connect the two."
KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,teaminus,3,Thu Jul 16 16:42:16 2015 UTC,Look alikes
KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,chakrablocker,5,Thu Jul 16 05:06:37 2015 UTC,I believe Tracy Morgan also exists in the Kimmy universe.

KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,marlboromansam,5,Thu Jul 16 05:45:35 2015 UTC,Tina Fey has answered the question explicitly. It's a no I'm afraid.

KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,LurkAddict,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:32:21 2015 UTC,"Even though she's said it's not, I think some interesting fan fiction could be made that desperately tries to put them in the same world.  I'm not creative enough come up with anything myself, but it could be funny to see how inventive someone could be trying to piece together every little detail.  And then write themselves out of a corner when the new season comes up and contradicts something in the fan fic.  I'm thinking in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way."
KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,RoosterAficionado,7,Thu Jul 16 13:48:01 2015 UTC,We see Reverend Gary in the Ludachristmas episode (Season 2 Ep 9) and at least one other time that I can't recall.  He's definitely a different person. You can tell on account of not being played by Jon Hamm even though there is a 30 Rock character who is played by Hamm.
KimmySchmidt,3dgrru,xxred_baronxx,6,Thu Jul 16 09:43:24 2015 UTC,"There's also that construction worker who catcalls Liz in ""When It Rains It Pours"" in 30 Rock, and then catcalls Kimmy and then asks out Titus in ""Kimmy Kisses A Boy!"""
KimmySchmidt,3d4b4p,hzlaugher,5,Mon Jul 13 12:20:09 2015 UTC,Only two other shows would ever do something like this: Community and 30 Rock.  Good damn company.

Both the parties agree on the following terms of settlement regarding their divorce.   Julian Vorhees and Jacqueline Vorhees being of sane and sober mind do hereby state the following statements are true:   TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF DIVORCE: Husband and wife with the mutual agreement of each other assent to the proper division of all their properties, houses, and factories. Husband agrees to pay the wife alimony of an outrageous sum (in hismind) and a barely sufficient sum (in her mind). Due to the mutual assent on the given terms and conditions, any adherence of the clause can lead to a strict action against any of the two.   CUSTODY OF CHILD: Both the husband and wife agree on the join custody of their child(ren) __________________________ (use additional page for additional children). Husband agrees to deposit an amount of ""too much money for that woman"" each month to support the child(ren). Wife agrees to deposit an amount of ""nothing for that no-good-two-timing-son-of-a-#@!"" each month to support the child(ren). Debt and expense payment are null and void as far as she's concerned.   Husband agrees to pay all the debts regarding the house loan and without holding the wife responsible for it.   1) PERSONAL PROPERTY: The personal property which included several homes, four companies (at least), and five vacation properties are to be equally allotted to both the parties. The division is to take place in following course:   Husband gets the houses that look the most like bachelor pads,keeps all the companies, with properties like furniture etc to be distributed equally between him and his mistress. Wife gets the homes that have the better gardens and relinquishes rsponsibility [sic] for the companies [sic] day-to-day operations without sacrificing any of her share in the profits."

I'm open to being wrong about this, but man, I think this seems highly likely.  edit: I've been hitting the pinot for the 4th and I know something is horribly wrong with the grammar of this post but I just can't figure out how to fix it right now so I am sorry my friends."

KimmySchmidt,3c3qxp,JIsrael180,2,Sun Jul 5 02:06:57 2015 UTC,"I am not sure a 43 year old can believably play the mother of a 30 year old ... She would have had to have given birth to her when she was 13 - which while possible, doesn't seem super likely ?  Her father is played by a 51 year old so he was at least an adult when she was born. Maybe Ellen Degeneres could play her mother? She has had Ellie guest host her show and actually does seem like she comes from the same part of the country as Kimmy's father.  Though Ellen is too known for being Ellen and I am not sure audiences could believe her as a heterosexual unloving mother. Oh! Duh! Lily Tomlin! Has the squinty eyes, and the ability to seem like a person who doesn't get along with her daughters :-)"
KimmySchmidt,3c3qxp,dngaay,3,Sun Jul 5 10:27:14 2015 UTC,"Makeup can always be used to make an actor look older. Plus Ellie looks pretty young for her age, so it wouldn't be too jarring to see"
KimmySchmidt,3c3qxp,dymphnawolf,2,Mon Jul 6 06:12:43 2015 UTC,"Plus we don't know how old she was when Kimmy was born, so with some makeup and maybe some gray hairs, they could have Amy play her mom and say she was a teenager when Kimmy was born. Honestly, I would be able to buy  it with this show. It seems to run on rule of funny than our earth logic"

KimmySchmidt,3avidy,autowikibot,4,Tue Jun 23 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"Titus Andronicus:       Titus Andronicus is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1588 and 1593, probably in collaboration with George Peele. It is thought to be Shakespeare's first tragedy, and is often seen as his attempt to emulate the violent and bloody revenge plays of his contemporaries, which were extremely popular with audiences throughout the sixteenth century.   The play is set during the latter days of the Roman Empire and tells the fictional story of Titus, a general in the Roman army, who is engaged in a cycle of revenge with Tamora, Queen of the Goths. It is Shakespeare's bloodiest and most violent work and traditionally was one of his least respected plays. Although it was extremely popular in its day, by the later seventeenth century it had fallen out of favour. In the Victorian era, it was disapproved of primarily because of what was considered to be a distasteful use of graphic violence, but from around the middle of the twentieth century its reputation began to improve.

The play is based on the life of the legendary Roman leader Caius Marcius Coriolanus. The tragedy is numbered as one of the last two tragedies written by Shakespeare along with Antony and Cleopatra.  Coriolanus is the name given to a Roman general after his more than adequate military success against various uprisings challenging the government of Rome. Following this success, Coriolanus becomes active in politics and seeks political leadership. His temperament is unsuited for popular leadership and he is quickly deposed, whereupon he aligns himself to set matters straight according to his own will. The alliances he forges to accomplish his own will result in his ultimate downfall and death.  Coriolanus is often staged in full theatre productions and has recently been featured as a full-length film under the same title with the leading role played by Ralph Fiennes.

Kee-me ran away!"" along with ""I didn't want to take credit for something an FBI psychic pig did"" are great lines."

Especially in gentrified areas, these kind of places pop up.

In this series, Kelly (Kimmy’s counterpart) was kidnapped and held in an igloo in Montreal for 10 years.  After being freed, she comes to Los Angeles, where she meets and rooms with Xanadu (Xanthippe’s counterpart), and the two come across hilarious situations as Kelly tries to catch up on everything she’s missed.  I personally helped film part of their first episode, and Missy and Lori are committed to providing viewers with the humor and fun you loved from the Netflix original.  Please check them out, and give them a thumbs up if you like what you see!

Titus and Jacqueline are confronting their past and the people that represent what they've been running away from (his wife, her parents) so it's only fitting that we see Mrs. Schmidt as well.

As for Titus I'll tell you a story, I'm black, my husband is Puerto Rican and in Manhattan if you are minority yellow cabs will NOT stop for you. I once waited nearly an hour to catch one late one night. But, my husband now serves in the military and took me out in uniform for our anniversary and cabs nearly collided to give us a ride. It took less than 1 minute on hailing. We were astounded (and happy because it was COLD) If he is in uniform or it comes out that he is military the treatment is night and day."

KimmySchmidt,35kco8,RLLRRR,5,Mon May 11 04:54:07 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a massive fan of the finale either, and it's hard to articulate why. The reverend's trial was a big character moment for Kimmy, and a serious thing. But the only reason Kimmy needed to step up was that the entire situation was played for laughs. I don't like that a serious problem was caused 100% by comedic reasons.   That said, I think a lot of the consequences of this ""filler"" (Jacqueline learning stuff about herself, Titus's wife finding him, Titus finding some stardom, Gretchen becoming disillusioned with the cult) are going to show up in Season 2. So I don't think they added nothing. Just weren't of the same quality that the rest of the season had."

KimmySchmidt,348234,CuriousPeterSF,7,Wed Apr 29 01:13:37 2015 UTC,But… I like House of Cards better…
KimmySchmidt,348234,VulcanCitizen,3,Thu Apr 30 00:18:28 2015 UTC,That's okay too! :-)  It is a darn good show. We will eventually get around to watch episode 2-12.
KimmySchmidt,348234,VulcanCitizen,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:22:27 2015 UTC,"House of Cards has 13 episode per season, like UKS.   So: 2-13"
KimmySchmidt,348234,JakeMakesSteaks,2,Fri May 1 00:55:20 2015 UTC,We watched episode 1 and 13 already.
KimmySchmidt,348234,mxt920,15,Fri May 1 04:38:25 2015 UTC,"And this is a victory for Kimmy Schmidt because.... why?  They're two completely different shows. It's like comparing Seinfeld to The Sopranos. Also, most TV shows' ratings drop after the first season so it isn't a fair comparison. It's not like they're competing for a better time slot or anything. This is Netflix."
KimmySchmidt,348234,NateY3K,39,Wed Apr 29 01:26:10 2015 UTC,"Because it is a victory for off-beat comedies. People always quote House of Cards as the example of Netflix original programming. Perhaps they will now have more shows like UKS in the lineup.  Frankly, this surprised even me. I always thought the viewership of UKS was far less than that of HoC."
KimmySchmidt,348234,suss2it,16,Wed Apr 29 01:32:32 2015 UTC,It also bodes well for the existence of future seasons.  :D
KimmySchmidt,348234,JakeMakesSteaks,4,Wed Apr 29 02:14:36 2015 UTC,I am quite confident there will be more than 2 seasons.  But if Tina Fey does another show with Ellie Kemper I will be fine with that too!
KimmySchmidt,348234,CashewGuy,8,Wed Apr 29 02:51:02 2015 UTC,"Frankly   I see what you did there.  I see House of Cards and Kimmy Schmidt two different parts of the Netflix spectrum. House of Cards is a drama, and a damn good one; whereas Kimmy Schmidt is a comedy, and a damn good one. The thing about House of Cards is that it takes quite a bit of patience to get in to, whereas Tina Fey's style of writing is one in that it's easy to pick up on.   My point being that it's difficult to compare the viewers of Kimmy Schmidt and House of Cards because they're very different in every way (except for the fact they're on Netflix). I bet the watchers of House of Cards who watched all 3 seasons are much more invested than even the avid Kimmy Schmidt watchers because, again, it takes more patience and willingness to go through 3 seasons of House of Cards than it is Kimmy Schmidt. I don't know how often I've repeated myself, but I still feel like I didn't make my point clear.   If you want to compare, say, Daredevil and House of Cards, I could get behind that because they require about the same amount of dedication to get ""hooked"" on to. But again, Kimmy Schmidt is on the spectrum of Netflix originals, but somewhere that isn't overlapping with the intense drama that House of Cards gives you."
KimmySchmidt,348234,thedolaon,5,Wed Apr 29 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I've watched both House of Cards and UKS and I'm more invested in the latter. Season 3 was just a big letdown for me, and I'm thinking season 2 would've actually been a good enough series finale."
KimmySchmidt,348234,rocketmonkeys,12,Wed Apr 29 05:06:48 2015 UTC,"See, I don't agree. I don't want another show like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. I don't want another show like House of Cards. I don't want another show like Orange is the New Black.   The thing I like most about Netflix is the variety. One of the reasons why some of the network and cable comedies fail is because they're trying way too hard to be like that other popular comedy. There's rarely any originality in comedies anymore and a lot of people are getting sick and tired of it. Was Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt trying to cash in on the success of some other comedy? No. How about Arrested Development? No.   Netflix is on a roll with many great shows and it needs to keep doing what it's been doing: Create quality dramas/comedies without looking at the past and make something exciting and fresh."
KimmySchmidt,348234,mxt920,4,Wed Apr 29 03:40:53 2015 UTC,"Not another UKS, but perhaps more quirky comedies, or other network rejects."
KimmySchmidt,348234,SurrealSage,2,Wed Apr 29 04:12:00 2015 UTC,Off-beat comedies have always been more popular than political dramas. I'd be more surprised if it wasn't more popular than House of Cards.
KimmySchmidt,348234,rocketmonkeys,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:45:39 2015 UTC,i'm always meeting people who have watched the show! its extremely popular!
KimmySchmidt,348234,marlboromansam,4,Sat May 2 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"They're polling 2500 viewers.  Out of 40 million.  I love the idea, but I'm not sure the numbers mean much.  Someone who knows statistics; correct me here."
KimmySchmidt,348234,rocketmonkeys,27,Wed Apr 29 01:29:46 2015 UTC,"Polls going into presidential elections generally have a sample size of 1,000 respondents and are excellent predictors, provided they are truly representative samples of the general population, so 2,500 is definitely a large enough sample.  The real question is whether it's representative.  They say specifically that they only measure computers, tablets, and phones, so this excludes anybody who watches on an AppleTV, a Roku, a PS4 or XBox, etc.  So we really don't know how much of a difference that would make in the overall numbers, if any."
KimmySchmidt,348234,fakeshits,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:13:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. So the best way to judge is, is there any information about viewership numbers based on platform? In other words, if we know those sources you listed as not being counted make up a small percentage (5-10%), we may be more willing to accept the representativeness than if it were a much greater share.  Either way, if we simply understand this to mean ""Kimmy Schmidt is more popular than House of Cards among computer, tablet, and phone viewers of Netflix"", that's still a pretty damn solid headline for the show in terms of its popularity."

After Fey and Carlock scripted Bankston's TV interview, they built a 32-second version of the song with Richmond ""the way we figured the Gregory Brothers would."" The actual Gregory Brothers came into the picture when it was time to create the title sequence. ""The main titles company said, 'We can get the Gregory Brothers to do your song.' We were like, 'Great!'"" Richmond says. ""They came in and they were able to make the video look so cool. Those guys are great.

KimmySchmidt,33ekca,banned_accounts,3,Sat Apr 25 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"I wrote before about how I thought it was supposed to be kind of ambiguous.  Like, it doesn't seem like his primary motivation was sexual, more just that he wanted to dominate and control a bunch of young naive women.  The show portrays / addresses, as one of it's primary thematic motifs, the many different ways that women are oppressed in society.  Sexual abuse and rape is a part of it but it's not the only or most important aspect of it, and so ""the bunker"" can function as a stand in for all the different ways women are 'captive' or not free or oppressed...  so if it were just a horrible nightmare of rape it would be a) not very funny ): and b) not as effective for a broadly appealing girl-power tina fey show...."
KimmySchmidt,33ekca,xieng5quaiViuGheceeg,2,Tue Apr 21 23:21:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe he kidnapped them for some bigger plan he abandoned andat the time thought they were all pliable. Like Kimmy may have had a bad home life so he thought she would be grateful, (he thought) Cyndee was soft and dumb  and Gretchen went with him willingly. Donna Maria might have been taken to be a sort of guardian, a maternal figure (maybe one of the girls cried for her mom). Kimmy did mention 'weird sex stuff' but that could have been among the ladies of the bunker.   I can see arguments for both sides, honestly."
KimmySchmidt,33ekca,dymphnawolf,0,Tue Apr 21 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"I always thought the ""weird sex stuff"" as between the girls or with Can Man. You really wouldn't describe being raped for 15 years as ""weird sex stuff"""
KimmySchmidt,33ekca,dymphnawolf,2,Tue Apr 21 22:31:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Kimmy and Cyndee (maybe Gretchen) were likely involved. And from what we saw of Cyndee down there, she was a bit weird."
KimmySchmidt,33ekca,CuriousPeterSF,2,Tue Apr 21 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Most likely, there will be no juicy details, because the backstory is not meant to be titillating. On the other hand, the message of the show is to survive and thrive. There is no need to water down the trauma. The central point is the strength that trauma.  But you can believe in anything, if that makes you enjoy the show better."

KimmySchmidt,333j0s,hammy3000,14,Sun Apr 19 04:25:13 2015 UTC,"I think the thing is that over the seven seasons of 30 Rock, Tina Fey, Robert Carlock, et al. got more comfortable with injecting the surreal and absurd. By the end, 30 Rock is just as crazy, if not crazier than Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Let me quote the first line of a season six episode synopsis from Wikipedia. ""The cast and writers celebrate Leap Day, which is a widely celebrated holiday complete with a Santa Claus-like mascot—a gilled creature named Leap Day William, who lives in the Mariana Trench and trades candy for children's tears."""
KimmySchmidt,333j0s,bondfool,2,Sun Apr 19 18:24:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't really enjoy season six all that much the first time or three through... but after a few month hiatus from endlessly looping through the show, I just put a few episodes on.  Netflix had me in the beginning of season 6, so that's where I am watching.  I am enjoying this season more than I ever did before.  I think Kimmy Schmidt has something to do with it.    The Tuxedo Begins is another ""out there"" episode from s6.  A nude Will Forte running through the streets of Manhattan is a great way to end any episode."
KimmySchmidt,333j0s,MattSchmie,10,Tue Apr 21 03:24:35 2015 UTC,"30 Rock is the same but less focussed, more characters, more angles.    Won't be as addictive and upbeat but has a longer burn.  It is easily one of the better comedies you could watch.    I think Unbreakable has a lot of advantages in its smaller scope, 30 Rock switches between characters so quickly you will miss a few jokes now and then, just through the sheer quantity.    Will give you an insight into how much of Unbreakable is Tina Fey's quite dark writing and how much is that special Ellie Kemper inspired optimism.  My favourite characters in 30 Rock, Kenneth and Liz Lemon, even Tracey Morgan, have a bit of Kimmy in their attitude. Good combination."
KimmySchmidt,333j0s,Werewomble,5,Sun Apr 19 05:40:18 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion, but I think 30 Rock is better.  I've seen the whole first season of Kimmy a couple times, I like it, and I'll catch the next seasons too, but overall I got way more laughs out of 30 Rock."
KimmySchmidt,333j0s,Erekai,2,Wed Apr 22 17:37:39 2015 UTC,Me too. Kimmy is great but 30 Rock has its hands in far more characters and their worlds - just way more to make fun of.

I'm watching the show for the THIRD time right now and every episode I pick up on new jokes and gags and it just gets better and better and better. If you liked the absurdity of UKS, 30 Rock absolutely needs to be at the top of your list. Hang in through the first season. Trust me."

KimmySchmidt,32qjuj,Dinahmoe,7,Wed Apr 15 22:56:28 2015 UTC,"I think Ellie is one of the funniest comedians out there.  But I wonder if she charms the audience into thinking that she is funny, she is naturally funny, or she does things that are funny. My views may be colored, because I am such a big fan.  Her style is very different from other funny people though."
KimmySchmidt,32qjuj,Dinahmoe,11,Wed Apr 15 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"She's not a comedian, she's an actress with a lot of energy. She has a great personality and it goes a long way. Much like J Law, she's fun and that comes across well. When she was on ellen, she said that's just the way she dances and people think it's funny, but she's kickin it! I'd watch both of them fold laundry. (that's a quote from Jennifer Ringley of jennicam, who seems to be back in the news)  http://ellentube.com/videos/0-3zinhhbe/"
KimmySchmidt,32qjuj,sneakyfilthnuts,3,Thu Apr 16 03:11:37 2015 UTC,yep. she has the 'It' factor that alot of people who make it in the industry have. the charisma. Many of the main characters in the show have 'it'.
KimmySchmidt,32qjuj,whiteblizzard182,3,Thu Apr 16 04:54:09 2015 UTC,I think she charms by just being naturally funny. The characters she has played portrays another side of Ellie Kemper!
KimmySchmidt,32qjuj,xieng5quaiViuGheceeg,3,Thu Apr 16 06:32:37 2015 UTC,She reminds me of Jim Carrey.
KimmySchmidt,32qjuj,T3Sh3,2,Fri Apr 17 06:09:02 2015 UTC,She's so much funnier than Zooey Deschanel. Ellie doesn't have to try that hard to come off as charming and adorable. Ellie Kemper all day!
