There was one situation with George A. Koval who remained uncaught for many years and was the only one (that we know of) to have top-level security clearance in the US. He was the ""only Soviet intelligence officer to penetrate the U.S. secret atomic facilities producing the plutonium, enriched uranium and polonium used to create the atomic bomb.""  He was born in the Sioux City, Iowa, USA and his parents were from Belarus.  They immigrated to the US after the Soviet Union merged.  He studied electrical engineering at the University of Iowa, but after the Great Depression he moved to the Soviet Union in 1932. He attended college at Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology and graduated in 1939 and gained a Soviet Citizenship.   He was a grade A student and caught attention of  Soviet Union’s Main Intelligence Directorate (Гла́вное разве́дывательное управле́ние), or using Roman letters: Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye (GRU).  Since he was born in the US, he already had a citizenship that was easy to get him back in. They sent him to the US using the name Delmar and he landed in San Francisco and moved to New York. By this time it's 1941 and he was drafted into the US Army.   Through a fake degree of Associate Degree in Chemistry from a community college in New York, he was selected to join the Army Specialized Training Program and studied electrical engineering with some other top candidates. These candidates were asked to join  Special Engineer Detachment, who became part of The Manhattan Project.  Throughout this time he sent recipes and various locations to the GRU until 1946 when he was honorably discharged from the Army after refusing a promotion due to (later revealed) worry about tighter security. In 1948, he told his friends he was going to travel to Europe. He went back to The Soviet Union and never returned back to the US.   Source"

AskHistorians,3e1cyf,IamKervin,10,Tue Jul 21 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"Coincidence. The British secret service played a large part in supplying and informing underground movements across the Reich, from France to Norway to Poland and most occupied nations inbetween. It was quite an feat of espionage, but regretably fears of facist infiltration meant that there was almost no cooperation between any of the bureaus, and that tight-lipped secrecy also meant that the newly formed special forces were uninformed.   There was a BBC documentary about the subject a number of years ago. Supposedly the first charges set by the commandos set off just as a British spy was walking to his rendezvous to collect improvised explosives. The account given by the man later in dispatches to London allegedly claimed he had to turn up his collar and calmly walk back the way he came, and that he had no sympathy for the men that ruined his careful months of planning."

Prior to the OSS, the U.S. found espionage to be distasteful and not gentlemanly so there are very limited records and were most likely very limited operations.

AskHistorians,3e22f0,grapp,233,Tue Jul 21 10:34:15 2015 UTC,"While I can't speak for 17th century British men, in the book Four Against the Arctic by David Roberts, the author chronicles the shipwreck of four Russian sailors in 1743 on a treeless island north of the Arctic circle where they survived for six years.  During an exploratory expedition onto the island of Svalbard, the four men set out from a merchant vessel to determine if an old hunting cabin was still on the island, near some walrus hunting grounds. They were equipped with a musket and 12 shots, a knife, an ax, a kettle, 20 pounds of flour, a tinderbox and a small amount of tinder, a pouch of tobacco, and four pipes. After finding that the cabin was intact they returned to shore to find that the ship was gone (it was thought to have been consumed in an ice flow or destroyed in a gale).  They immediately used their 12 shots to kill reindeer, an animal that freely populated the island. Now, however, without a weapon, they needed to find another way to hunt, preferably a bow and arrow. The problem in making a bow was that they needed animal sinew to make the bowstring and there was only one indigenous animal with strong enough sinew to use: the polar bear.  No trees grow on the island of Svalbard, so the men had to subsist on driftwood for fire. Fortunately for them, in one piece of the driftwood there was a large bolt with a hole through it which they used to fashion a hammer for blacksmithing. After finding two large nails, they smithed two spears and went hunting for a polar bear. One can only guess at the fight that ensued between them, but at the end the men got their sinew (and meat that apparently tastes a bit like hamburger).   They also had a member of their group suffer from scurvy, the only source of vitamin C on the island being lemongrass, which was fairly rare. Three of the members of the group would drink the reindeers' blood after killing them, thereby consuming the vitamin C in the blood, but the fourth one refused to, dying in the fifth year- presumably from scurvy.  They kept the same fire lit for the entire six years they were there. The way they did this was to make a candle-holder out of clay (similar to a lantern), tear strips of linen from their clothes, soak it in reindeer fat and use it like a candle. By the end, none of them had any linen on them; they were entirely garbed in animal skins.  That far north, the sun sets in November and doesn't lighten the sky again till March. Six years these Russian peasants lived this way, five months of night at a time, hunting reindeer by moonlight in winters that hovered around 0 degrees, wrapped in animal skins and staying warm when they were lucky enough to find driftwood. They also ended up killing ten more polar bears, although every time after the first it was in self-defense, when a bear would come sniffing around their hunting cabin, trying to break down the walls.  Interesting side note: the only reason this case was so well documented is because when the men were finally found and rescued, there was a trial in court because the merchant ship's owner believed there had been a mutiny and the ship was stolen."

At this time, there was a high rate of unemployment and these men did not often have marketable skills for urban life, so they ended up going to sea as common sailors with no experience in order to make a living, or to gain passage to the Americas where they could start a new life.  These men were most often displaced farmers due to the changing agricultural practices of the time which were part of the Enclosures.  These men, being basic farmers would have had common experience with animal husbandry, farming, basic leather working, cloth repair, carpentry, masonry, and other tasks found commonly on farms.

The ship soon after sank losing all hands aboard.

AskHistorians,3e1fv3,cordis_melum,112,Tue Jul 21 05:40:11 2015 UTC,"In his book, History of Madness, Michel Foucault attempts to provide a socio-historical account of how the notion of 'unreason' has shifted and become reconfigured over time in the Western European context. Foucault makes a complex and varied argument. One possible reading (and answer to your question) is that 'unreason' was, until around the 18th century, a particular form of knowledge or 'reason' that was legitimated and constituted within cultural and social contexts (e.g. mystics, seers, shamans, etc). Foucault argues that around the 18th century the notion of 'madness' began to emerge in conjunction with psychiatry and 'authoritative' or expert knowledges that subjected unreason to a sort of clinical gaze that constituted it as invalid and a sign of mental deficit in the subject, and so forth. The lines between unreason, reason, and madness became entangled with emerging forms of psychiatric and medical knowledge that focussed not on the body but on mental states, that is to say, the mind as an object of inquiry. Systems of categories and classifications emerged to provide a sort of knowledge-power infrastructure to support the development of what madness is and how we should deal with it. What we observe is that unreason becomes a subjugated form of knowledge - it becomes the purview of artists and specially sanctioned spiritual figures perhaps. Madness becomes a social problem, and one that can be dealt with through both old and emerging practices and techniques, such as cellular discipline (locking people up), interventions (psychiatric help), and medical procedures (such as lobotomies), to name a few. Foucault has nothing to say about the 21st century because, very sadly, he did not live to see it. I suspect he might be somewhat happy to see contemporary cultural forms and practices that could revalidate and revitalize 'other' types of reason, but perhaps also acknowledge the very real or 'non-constructed' biological realities of mental illness."

AskHistorians,3e1fv3,Capn_max,28,Tue Jul 21 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"While there were some people in the Bible who were described as hearing voices (e.g. the young Samuel), it is more common for them to describe either visions or a physical event in the real world.   Visions can be quite simple such as Jacob's vision of angels going up and down a ladder leading to heaven - in this case vision seems synonymous with dream, but with a layer of interpretation (bear in mind that dreams were held to be meaningful at least some of the time). These probably would not trigger a psychiatric interpretation in modern times - we all know that dreams are odd, and most people ascribe a certain amount of meaning to some of their dreams, even if it is only at the level of ""wish fulfilment"".   Other visions are more complex and structured - this seems particularly true of apocalyptic writing. However the resulting narratives are coherent and develop themes - in great contrast to the rambling text we often see from people with psychiatric problems.  Physical events are recounted in a way which doesn't leave much ambiguity: the author does not mean them to be confused with dreams, visions, voices or anything else. An example would be the meeting of angels with Abraham's family and Lot's family, with physical consequences in the real world.  Because of the difference between what is described in most of the Biblical texts and the experience of most psychiatric patients, I think it would be unwise to assume that they describe the same mental events. You have the option of saying that the Biblical event did not happen, or the description was greatly changed from the original event, but then you have to make a lot of assumptions to get back to what you think was the ""original"" event which you want to compare to modern psychiatric problems."

AskHistorians,3e1fv3,Igortheinvincible,5,Tue Jul 21 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"I think you'll find that most occurrences are more ""thus saith the Lord"", ie a prophet announcing a message  to the people.

This contrasts with most earlier books which were written (again, at least in something approaching their current form) centuries after the events, legendary or historical, that they purport to describe.

The stories of the patriarchs and the book of Ezekiel were composed around the time of the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE). While the former actually takes place in that time period and location, the latter describes events taking place in 20th century BCE Canaan.   There is no extra-Biblical evidence of figures like Ezekiel, but you wouldn't expect to find records of an eccentric priest from a minor religion in exile. The non-supernatural events described in the book are consistent with what we know about the exile, and the tone is consistent with other Jewish priestly texts from the period."

That is to say that to be mentally ill, you need to be acting inappropriate to how people within your society would act. This, if you are within a society where it is ""normal"" (relatively speaking and perhaps not the right choice of words) to hear voices then you are not mentally ill.    In some cultures today, hearing voices is not necessarily psychosis depending on a variety of factors. I will give a hypothetical example. A Pentecostal is in the ICU visiting a family member who has a grave illness and starts speaking in tongues and then collapses - are they having a stroke or merely expressing grief in a culturally appropriate manner for them?    I can't speak for the culture of the eras you have mentioned, I merely continue the common refrain that you cannot necessarily use modern definitions of mental illness on ancient texts because there is a lot of wiggle room."

AskHistorians,3e2rmy,Aqwis,18,Tue Jul 21 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, both double-story and single-story lowercases are found in printed typefaces.  Historically, the divergence arose in the 15th century Italy, when two forms of scripts arose, which are stilled used today--roman (upright) and italic (slanted). The first roman typeface was developed by Nicolas Jenson, which was based on Roman majuscules (hence the name) and Carolingian minuscules, a form of calligraphy ultimately derived from Roman cursive. The first italic typeface was Aldine, named after the printing press where it was invented. Its founder Aldus Manutius created it to squeeze more information into a smaller number of pages:   “We have printed, and are now publishing, the Satires of Juvenal and Persius in a very small format, so that they may more conveniently be held in the hand and learned by heart (not to speak of being read) by everyone""   The reason it has the single-story ""ɑ"" is because, as you said, because it was on the humanist cursive in vogue at the time, which did emulate the Greek form.  Of course, this is no longer the case. While we still have roman/book and italic formats for typefaces, designers mix and match features for many reasons. The reason you probably see a two-story ""a"" on your screen right now is because your default display font is probably set to either Arial or Times New Roman. However, you can change it to one that uses a single-story ""a"", such as Futura.  tl;dr: Change your font if you want the ""ɑ"".  EDIT: Department of Redundancy Department."

AskHistorians,3e11df,Dafuzz,116,Tue Jul 21 03:19:27 2015 UTC,"This is a simple matter of perspective. Literally.   When we look at the beginnings of sculpture, back in the Egyptian times, we get work that is very stiff and not very life like, like this. It's stiff, blocky and more representational of a human being rather than what an actual human being looks like.  But as much as that carving doesn't look like an actual human being, it is far closer than the Egyptian paintings, like this. We don't get any sense of depth perception in this painting. The legs on the human beings both seem to be on the same side and nothing appears further away or closer. That's because there is no vanishing point.  When you are working on a sculpture, you can move around the entire object. It is presented to your senses in 3 dimensions, height, width and depth. When you are good enough, you can start to see when those dimensions are off and when they need to be corrected. If we jump into the future, Greece was producing sculptures that looked like this. The sculptor doesn't have to worry about a vanishing point on a sculpture since it already in 3D. They can now worry about anatomical structures (even if this one is highly exaggerated).  Drawing and painting are very different though. You have to trick your audience into seeing the illusion of depth, since all you really have to work with is height and width. This was a much slower process. You can see the eventual progressions of depth in the Greek painting on their vases. You can see in this painting, unlike the Egyptian paintings that we get some sort of illusion of depth. People are now standing behind things. Our humans are still very flat, but painters are slowly getting the hang of it.  Jumping forward to the Middle Ages, skills are progressing to a point where the artists understand the need for depth, but they are not quite sure how to do it. Here is a good example. The painting seems ""off"" doesn't it? That's because there is no common vanishing point. The right side of the painting seem to be aligned with a vanishing point wanting to happen in the deep left of the picture. But the left side has vanishing points all over the place. Roof slants, walls and windows are places helter skelter. We're getting closer to realism though.   As far as humans go, painters are getting closer as well. Here is a young woman. Notice, we have a lot more details now than we did back with the Greeks. It's not just a side profile of the face, but now we can get it at an angle. To our eyes, things still look off. The size of her face to the size of her head is seriously out of proportion as is her head to her body. But, we have depth.  By the time the Renaissance rolled around, humans had pretty much cracked the code of proportion, depth and vanishing points. Da Vinci's famous Last Supper is one of the best uses of the Vanishing Point, drawing all of our attention to the center where Christ is. Michelangelo understood anatomy and proportion to give us convincing people in his paintings.  Now, as to why this took so long and why sculpture became real so much faster. Sculpture was easier to get the proportions right and didn't have to worry about using tricks to fool the audience. It was already in 3D and the only difficulty was getting the anatomy right. Painting relied on tricks that had to be not only learned, but passed down to the next apprentice. Since it was so much more difficult to master, it took a longer amount of time to get right, especially if a master was only teaching a few students at a time. One well timed infectious disease could wipe out several hundreds years of learning in a few short years, further delaying the process.   There is more to the process, including the political encouragements of painters in the Renaissance, but I can get to those later if anyone is interested.   EDIT Sources:  * Larson, J.

Symbolism was sometimes more important than realism, the latter not always being relevant at all in the message of the piece. One example: In Egyptian art, the more importance a figure had, the larger it was, perspective was not the goal.   Also, early Greek sculpture was not always super realistic, it developed as well from the Kore/Korai onward.

While not quite on par with the greatest works of the renaissance, there are a lot of surviving works from antiquity that demonstrate similar schools of artistic thought. This somewhat-famous fresco from Pompeii, the Portrait of Paquius Proculo, dated to shortly before the eruption of Vesuvius in the 1st Century CE, shows the further development of art than one would expect to find in the classical era. It has some similarities to features typical of renaissance art, such as semi-accurate proportions and attention to lighting. It also has a very basic simulation of depth, namely that one figure is placed in front of the other, but it does lack the very detailed backgrounds that really demonstrate true depth and perspective that is signature of many famous renaissance pieces. Additionally, while these figures are much more humanlike than Egyptian and Greek depictions of humans, their anatomical proportions are not quite perfect, most notably around the eyes.   But it is one example of pre-renaissance artwork that exhibits a higher quality than the very flat and stylized depictions of people that first come to mind when people think of classical art.

AskHistorians,3e11df,Grecco_Roman_Fire,23,Tue Jul 21 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"I have to question the linear manner in which you present realism as progress and painting as harder to master than realist sculpture. Sculpture required similar rigorous training that painters underwent and there are just as many tricks and secrets to making sculpture as there are to painting realistic figures. Just because you can look at something in the round does not mean you can recreate it. There are also examples of extremely realistic Egyptian sculpture that predate the Greek classical periode, but they were uncommon arguabley because of prevailing styles of the period. There are also some spectacularly realistic frescoes that have been unearthed in Pompeii, they survived only because they were interred in just the right conditions. One needs look no further than Gothic sculpture to see how style changed sculpture into what our tastes see as less realistic forms. A major reason that we see realistic sculpture from the ancient world but few paintings is that painting, and frescoes are ephemeral while bronze and stone are much more durable. Even with contemporary preservation and conservation painting struggle to last more than a few centuries.  It would be almost impossible to create a realistic work of sculpture without being able to draw in that manner. Look at Michelangelo's sketches and anatomy studies, no model could have posed for the months long process of carving marble by hand. The same would have been true in the classical era where bronze tools would have made the process even slower than the iron tools of the renaissance. The renaissance was literally and figuratively the rebirth of classical ideals, philosophy and aesthetics. The bones of Greek culture dug up and emulated before adding a then contemporary perspective. It is specifically rooted in the past, and derivative of classical works. The renaissance also happened differently in different places, French marble sculpture is very different from Italian works due in part to differing tastes, and in part to the lack of common instruction and technique. The temptation to see history as linear is powerful, as it reinforces contemporary western belief in our own progress. It helps us see ourselves as the cultural culmination of history, rather than as emulative of select aesthetics and philosophies. But art and object making is meandering and changeable with dead ends, and dropped styles that picked up and continued decades, or centuries later. George Kubler presents a great look at the changes in object making in his book ""The Shape of Time"", which outlines the non-linear progression of art and objects.  I am unfortunately on mobile for the day, thus no links but Google will quickly turn up images to support the art works I reference. My formatting also sucks for this reason."

When I move through the museums here in Italy, I'm always struck at the gradual progression that I see in how they painted the human figure as time went on.   I would argue that by their own standards, artists of the Middle Ages would think themselves quite proficient, ground breaking and their admirers would be impressed (or else they wouldn't get paid). By today's standards, the vanishing points are off, perspective may or may not exist and anatomy may be quite off to fairly close.   I see it in the same way we view video games.

The Senate has little hard power but much symbolic power as a legitimizing force: the princeps holds the varied authority of many Republican offices simultaneously (consular power, the tribune's veto, and proconsular authority over the provinces).   A transitional period with the Severans and the Crisis Emperors: the Emperor has authority from the army. The rich old men in the Senate are impotent, power goes to he who will flatter and pander to the troops. This model is extremely dangerous... starting with Pertinax, the army just starts murdering emperors who won't pander to them.  The Dominate: imperial authority comes from the gods (post-Constantine, God). The emperor is God's regent on Earth and is godlike himself and is not a normal man.

AskHistorians,3e2qeb,Wildfire9,18,Tue Jul 21 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"One of the major considerations in picking a launch site is how close to the equator you can put it. The angular momentum of the Earth adds a fair bit of oomph (that's the technical term) to the launching of a rocket, and the angular momentum increases as you get closer to the equator. To illustrate this, take a look at a spinning basketball (or any kind of ball) -- for the ball to complete one rotation, the areas near the midpoint have to travel much faster than the areas near the top or bottom of the ball. Similarly, as the Earth rotates, the areas near the equator spin faster than those at the poles.   Secondarily, the Cape is also on the east coast of Florida. Since rockets use the Earth's rotation to help boost them, they are generally launched on an eastward trajectory. That means that launches from Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center (adjacent to, but separate from, Cape Canaveral per se) will have an initial trajectory over the ocean, so if they fail any debris will fall into the ocean. (Also, the reusable parts of the now-retired space shuttle, the SRBs, could be recovered after their splashdown.)  Thirdly, the space launch complexes offer easy access to the Intracoastal Waterway, which means that a lot of large equipment can be floated to the site.   Interestingly, the Soviet Union's space program, facing similar considerations, wound up building their launch program at Baikonour, in what's now Kazakhstan. That's essentially a steppe/high desert environment, but it launches over land. The Soviet program (now Russian) also recovers cosmonauts on land, generally also in Kazakhstan. The cosmodrome there remained under Russian control when the Kazakhs declared their independence in 1991."

AskHistorians,3e2qeb,jschooltiger,3,Tue Jul 21 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"My understanding about the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) is that they were not only reusable but were reused multiple times. The only sets of SRBs that were lost were those from STS-4, the last test flight of the Shuttle; and those from STS-51-L, which was the ill-fated Challenger launch. The boosters from STS-4 had their landing parachutes fail, which caused the boosters to impact the ocean at high speed and sink; the boosters from the Challenger loss were destroyed in the explosion.   The SRBs normally float because air is trapped within the void space (where the propellant was) when they impact; the parachutes make sure they splash down nozzle-down. Ships can then recover them, cap the ends and tow them home.   I think that some SRBs were retired over time, but I'm not 100 percent sure about that and I don't have a source handy, so I will defer to someone else on that."

An opera would have had the words written by a special type of poet called a librettist, but in this case (as it's not an opera) Mozart was setting traditional words for a Requiem Mass. I don't think we know who wrote the words for the liturgy but they are very very old, and other composers set them to music. So the words are a Mass, like a prayer, they're not just pretty words. I'm taking a guess you weren't raised Catholic because you asked this question, but maybe you have some experience with Protestantism, and the only Protestant equivalent I can think of is maybe all the different settings of the Doxology if you know that? So in some churches it's sung to Duke Street, in others to Old 100th, and many other songs, but it's the same prayer, the tunes are just for style.   So a bit more general information about Mozart and his librettists for opera, which is probably closer to what you're actually asking about. Here's how you made an opera in the early Classical period: so someone who wanted an opera and would commission it, and they'd probably hire the poet first because the poetry was seen as more important than the music (though this is starting to evolve in that period). So the poet would write the libretto for an opera first, and then the composer was brought in to set the words. Sometimes this would happen years apart. Sometimes when the composer was writing the music he'd kick it back to the librettist and say such and such wasn't working and ask for edits, or just cut some of it out himself maybe, if the librettist was long gone. Or you could get a second librettist to edit the first one's work. But music was (allegedly!) the servant to poetry, so the poetry came first, and it was set by a proper poet.   Mozart was a more involved composer with his librettists than others, and towards the end would work with them while they were writing the poetry, as opposed to after. One of his most productive relationships was with a man named Lorenzo Da Ponte (who had a CRAZY life and came to live in America in the 19th century and founded the Italian department at Columbia, look him up), who was the librettist for three of Mozart's most beloved operas: Don Giovanni, The Marriage of Figaro and Così fan tutte.   Theoretically though... the composers (and the singers) would have been pretty proficient in the languages they were working with. Formal Italian and Latin would have been part of musical conservatory training for the singers and composers who went through that, conservatory training in the 18th c. was really pretty academically robust, and turned out some highly intelligent musicians. But as Mozart was a Boy Genius and didn't go to a conservatory, I would assume his father taught him his Latin and other languages he worked with."

In the 20th century there's lots of interesting composer-poet relationships, like Langston Hughes had a few operas (as a librettist), and they're interesting. Philip Glass, to be modern, also works with librettists, though sometimes he shares libretto credit with other authors."

Most libretti would have had so many fluent people looking over it before performance (librettist, composer, all the singers, many libretti were printed before the opera performance so the printer would have proofed it too, assuming it wasn't like an Italian opera in London) that I don't think any major error of dis-fluency could have made it past. For Italian operas of this period certainly several very educated Italians would have read it intensively. I mean all this would have been memorized by singers, and no fluent speaker is going to easily memorize grammatically incorrect poetry, that's just a real brain-melter. I've actually tried to memorize the phrase “Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?” several times and I just can't do it. So it would have been really hard to get bad grammar into permanence.   I'm sure if you go look a lot of the opera music manuscripts there's plenty of ""typos"" in the poetry from the copyist, but that's not very exciting.

AskHistorians,3e24j9,caffarelli,3,Tue Jul 21 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"Some, but not all, musicians learned Latin. For some, their positions included teaching Latin as part of their duties (J.S. Bach comes to mind), so I guess we can assume it was not incredibly rare to find some musicians capable of doing that (they were permitted to have somebody else do the teaching, too). Learning Latin was a requirement for academic education, and some musicians had contact with that kind of path. Some music treatises from the 17th-18th century were still in Latin, and pretty much all from before that were written in Latin (but I guess it's safe to assume not every musician would need to be in contact with those). Some musicians were ordained in the Catholic Church (like Vivaldi), so their education would include Latin.   If they were composing religious music with a Latin text, they would certainly be using the approved versions (already mentioned by Nebuchadnezzar-II). It would have been a very bad thing to present a composition with the wrong text. Imagine you are a graphic designer today and you deliver work with obvious dumb mistakes, you are not going to be in business for long with that kind of thing.  As /u/caffarelli mentioned, musicians would get somebody else to write the libretto, or would set some poet's work to music. Some musicians were able to speak/write more than one language. In many cases it was useful to be able to do that.   Musicians did travel back then, they would aspire to get prestigious positions and study under famous masters... If they were dealing with operas in Italian, it would not be rare to find them learning Italian (and they would probably interact with Italian singers, because there were Italian superstars in that world).   I don't know of any famous mistake in lyrics. I guess such a thing could happen, but that kind of mistake would be eventually fixed (preferably VERY soon). Music was not a hobby for these people, they were not having fun with their mates. They were aiming for the stars, trying to produce successful operas, trying to woo everybody with their new requiem commissioned by a rich family or religious organization... They had many reasons to get things right, and would try to fix mistakes quickly. I hope somebody can find an example of such an incident.

I'm thinking about Handel working in English but I'm not sure how bad his English was, he was supposed to be pretty gifted at languages. There's an essay in The Cambridge Companion to Handel (1997) that chronicles some dodgy Italian in his works (which were apparently compounded because he was working in England and no one could proof it and just cheerfully copied out any errors). But it just seems to be a combination of few cases of simple mistakes that no one was literate enough to fix through the natural course of opera making, and a few cases of ""curious choices"" that are sort of right but don't ring right to native speakers. Because Handel was probably very proficient in Italian. But I keep thinking if an Italian singer was handed a sheet of music that had some error-riddled macaroni-Italian copied out by an illiterate English scribe, s/he'd just automatically correct it for performance, but we'd never know because we'd only see the original manuscripts and pre-performance printed libretti.

AskHistorians,3e2r1u,ColonelGaraffi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:21 2015 UTC,"First, these sorts of identifications are not always dependable. Depending on the institution/author, an informed guess might be passed off as a confirmed ID. That happens a lot unfortunately.  But the process of identifying ancient works can, in general, be productive if enough information is available. Epigraphic evidence might be present on or near the work (though inscriptions often record info about the patron, not the piece itself). Maybe there are certain symbols or motifs associated with one subject or another. Maybe the artwork just resembles another confirmed piece whose subject is known. Copies weren't uncommon in the Greek and Roman worlds, so even fragments can be matched up with a sister piece. Perhaps the building in which the work was located gives clues: for example, one would expect to find a grand sculpture of Jupiter in a Roman temple of Jupiter. That can lead to a sort of chicken and egg problem if the temple hasn't been ID'd with certainty (if the temple is identified by the statues, and the statues are identified by the temple).  In the forum of ancient Pompeii, there's a large building called the ""Building of Eumachia"" which is poorly understood. Inside there's a statue of the patron, identified by an inscription. Outside, in the courtyard space, are three semi-circular statuary niches without any useful inscriptions. In 1820, the excavators found ""the upper part of a cornucopia, the foot of a life-sized statue, and an inscribed herm"" (Dobbins 1994, 652). So there's not a lot to go on here in terms of making an ID for what the statues were.   But Richardson has suggested that one of the statues in the central niche was of Concordia, in part because the architecture of the building corresponds to that of a near-contemporary shrine to Concordia Augusta in Rome. On this evidence, he even suggests there was a (now missing) statue of Livia in the central apse. Basically the idea is that Eumachia may have patronized the building to associate herself with the Imperial cult. There's no other statuary in the building that served this role, and these apses are very prominent at the end of the courtyard. There's a lot more detail to go into there, but my point is that in this case, historians have made a reasonably believable ID on the basis of only a few fragments of a statuary group."
AskHistorians,3e3a2b,RugbyTime,7,Tue Jul 21 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"After the victory over France, the British Army was in a relatively bad state. Even though large parts of the British expeditionary corps had been evacuated from Dunkirk, there was a severe lack of heavy weapons.   Germany was at a decisive disadvantage though.  Originally, Hitler had hoped that England would sue for peace after a successful defeat of France, so that he could then turn his focus on the Soviet Union and his plans for ""Lebensraum"" in the east without fighting at two fronts. When this didn't happen, plans for an invasion of England were hatched, but many of the German top brass didn't believe in any chances of success themselves. There are many factors that might have led to a disaster for the German invasion forces:    They lacked control of the sea where the Royal Navy still reigned supreme. Plans for Sealion called for every available u-boat and light ship to create minefields and somehow guard the invasion, but it is doubtful that this would have been enough. The Kriegsmarine had suffered casualties during the invasion of Norway, Bismarck and Tirpitz weren't ready yet.  The failure of the Luftwaffe to gain air superiority during the Battle of Britain meant that any invasion would have suffered from large losses from enemy bombardement, resupplying the invasion forces would have been an impossible task and the Royal Navy could then have cut off most of what the Germans would have been able to send across the channel. Hitlers orders for the Battle of Britain themselves went against what was originally planned for Seelöwe - a war of attrition against the RAF and the British war industry instead of destruction of the Royal Navy.  Shipping an adequate number of soldiers across the channel would have required every single transport ship the Germans could muster. Only a handful of these were purposefully designed invasion barges so it would have been very difficult to land anything as large as a tank.  The logistics following a successful invasion would have been a nightmare. Only with a successful capture of large harbors like Dover would there have been any chance of supplying the invasion with all the necessary materials. It is highly likely though that many of the important harbor facilities would have been demolished prior to occupation by the Germans so that it would have been hard to even supply a handful of divisions.    There are many more points that can be argued, but all in all, there was no chance that the German Army could have mounted any sort of successful invasion of Britain during the small window of time that was available between July 1940 and the deteriorating weather conditions starting from September which would have prevented most amphibious operations. From 1941 most of the German war effort was with Operation Barbarossa, the timeframe for an invasion was definitely over."

AskHistorians,3e3a2b,thefourthmaninaboat,5,Tue Jul 21 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"About a month ago, I took part in a wargame simulating Operation Sea Lion, my write-up of which can be found here. The outcome of this game was a likely German victory - the game ended with panzers at Maidstone, and a few scattered units between them and London. But this game doesn't accurately replicate the situation in 1940, which allowed such German successes. It also required the British players to make several major mistakes.  The main challenge for a German invasion of Britain was crossing the Channel. To be able to do this, and to keep crossing it for as long as the troops in Britain needed supplies, required three things: transports, naval superiority, and air superiority. The sealift capacity available to the Germans in 1940 was seriously deficient for any serious invasion. They had few large transports, and had to rely mainly on unpowered river barges. These were easy targets for British ships and aircraft. They were unseaworthy - had the landing fleet encountered a storm, or even just high winds, much of it would have been sunk. They were also irreplaceable parts of the German industrial infrastructure, necessary for moving large quantities of goods along Germany's inland waterways. Naval superiority was all but impossible for the Germans to achieve. In June 1940, the Royal Navy had just over half as many capital ships (cruisers to battleships) in home waters as the Kriegsmarine had ships period (24 capitals, including 7 battleships, against 41 total, most of which were repairing or working up).  These were accompanied by a ridiculous number of destroyers - the RN had a total of 10 flotillas spread along the South and East coasts, all able to respond to an invasion. Then you have light forces, such as minelayers, minesweepers, trawlers and gunboats, which would have been useless in a naval battle, but could reap a toll against the lumbering barge force. The comparatively poorly trained Kriegsmarine could not respond to this overwhelming preponderance of forces. In the game, we were able to prevent (an ahistorically weak) Home Fleet from coming south by maintaining the German capital ships as a threat to the Atlantic convoys. This was not an option available to the real Kriegsmarine, as the majority of their capital ships were either building (Bismarck, Tirpitz, Prinz Eugen) or in long-term repair (Scharnhorst, Lutzow). In the air, it was not entirely impossible for the Luftwaffe to gain air superiority over the south of England. However, they would not have been able to keep it. The RAF could, if it felt that it was unable to contest the skies over Kent and Sussex, retreat to airbases in the north of England. German raids against these bases would have had to have been unescorted, as their fighters could not reach that far. The RAF could use these bases to regain its strength, and then move south again once the invasion began. The Luftwaffe would have been hard-pressed to fulfil all the tasks required of it. Its bomber force had to hit the British air defence infrastructure (radars and airbases), act as flying artillery for the army, interdict British troop movements and harass the Royal Navy. Its fighters had to escort the bombers, and fly CAPs over the Channel and beachhead. The Luftwaffe did not have the strength to carry out all of these functions in the teeth of a strong RAF response, which would likely have been forthcoming.  On land, the Heer would have been facing a well-equipped force, in difficult terrain, with little supply available to it. The troops available to face an invasion were mostly those that had been preparing to land in France as part of the second BEF. They were well equipped, and armed with the best Britain had available. The dense British rail network allowed for quick movement of troops to face a potential landing. The terrain these troops would have been defending was almost ideal for a defense - the best landing beaches in Kent are in front of the Romney Marshes. Once you've crossed these, you reach the Royal Military Canal, which was dug to protect against a similar attack in the Napoleonic era. Behind that is a major escarpment, from which British and Empire troops could have poured fire onto any attempt to cross the canal. Much of the UK's south coast is cliffy, making landings impossible. While there is a long stretch of beach along the Sussex coast, this had no ports and few harbours, and so any German landing here would have to rely on the trickle of supplies landed across the beaches. Landing in Kent was necessary to capture a port - either Dover or Folkestone. But as pointed out earlier, any landing in Kent would be easy to contain, and prevent from reaching those ports."
AskHistorians,3e3a2b,Venmar,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:57 2015 UTC,"It's possible that Operation Sea Lion could have been Undertaken, but it is not clear whether or not it would have been successful in the long run. The Battle of Britain was essentially Germany attempting to take Aerial Superiority over the British to make said invasion feasible, since the German Navy could not stand up to the Royal Navy. The Germans were hoping that strong Aerial supremacy could prop up their Navy for long enough to open up the British Channel for a large invasion force to make its way across. The problem was, that even if this was achieved, it's unlikely that the German navy could keep the water lanes in the channel open long enough. Baring insane German naval maneuvering, the German navy would eventually lose control of the Channel and the German soldiers who landed in Britain would then lose all of the supplies and resources they would need.  The question basically lies in how feasible this was, which really wasn't. The Germans likely would have suffered large casualties simply trying to ferry all of their soldiers across the channel. Many of the boats they were rallying from across Europe for such a crossing were also designed either for Rivers or for short coastal distances, not a battlefield crossing over a channel. The German panzers would be the most important to ferry across yet they were obviously also the heaviest and most difficult to transport, British warships and bombers (what would remain) would likely focus on freighters carrying Panzers if they got a chance to attack the transport ships.   In the event that the Germans got across, they would have to establish a beachhead. The British (at least, especially Churchill) definitely made it clear that they would fight the Germans inch for inch in a land invasion. It is unlikely that the Germans would have been able to establish a beachhead wide and strong enough to deploy their Panzers in strength, and it is unlikely that they could have kept a beachhead open and supplied long enough by sea before the Royal Navy would snap its German counterpart.  Now I would still say that it was possible, but just unlikely even if the Germans took aerial supremacy. The Royal Navy was just simply too big and powerful, that even if it was strongmanned aside temporarily for a German crossing, it would eventually snap back and cut off what German troops did make it across from the sea. Land fighting itself would be fierce and the British were prepared to fight tooth and nail to resist a German invasion. After months of civilian bombing in the Battle of Britain, the UK would be in no mood to submit to the Germans, and they would find it hard to fight in Britain."
AskHistorians,3e2p7s,vertexoflife,14,Tue Jul 21 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"All evidence (as slim as it is) points to invention for propaganda. Copied from my previous post:    The TL;DR is no, primae noctis did not exist as any 'feudal right' or custom. There are a handful of mentions of it in medieval sources and they are polemical or literary, not historical. It's a myth that developed after the middle ages. 19th century French historians interested in creating negative portrayals of the 'dark ages' for their own political reasons created a custom out of it and gave it a latin name and thus made it 'real'.  The actual history of the development of the idea of primae noctis is actually more fascinating than the idea itself, it tells us a lot about how historians bring biases to their sources and opinions (the same can be said for the chastity belt). This is thoroughly explored in an astonishing investigation by Boureau:   Alain Boureau, The Lord's First Night: The Myth of the Droit de Cuissage (University of Chicago, 1998)     In France this is usually droit de cuissage (right of the thigh), in Anglo historiography it's Frenchified to droit de seigneur (right of the lord), these were translated in the 18th c into a retroactive medieval latin term primae noctis, or jus primae noctis. This is an indication of how sometimes historians have done their work: take modern concepts and convert them into medieval ideas.  It is not just a creation of post-medieval historians, although it served a different purpose to those writing about the 'barbaric dark ages' than those who refer to it in the medieval sources. This raises some complexity addressed best by Alain Boureau in The Lord's First Night: The Myth of the Droit de Cuissage which you can read in Google Books .  According to Boureau the first references to droit de cuissage (using our modern term) come in the 13th century and he situates them in:   the immense effort launched by the eleventh-century Gregorian reforms for the christianizing sexual mores [leading] to a sharpened observation where legitimate suspicions mingle with polemical invention.   To put it briefly, the appearance of droit de cuissage is always timed with complaints about   a. sexual mores of competing lay nobility, or   b. complaints about a 'barbaric' population in need of Christian reform, both polemical and both contexts containing often outrageous claims as part of polemic.  Again it shows up in other religio-political contexts. Here is a famous, oft-repeated citation by Scottish historian Hector Boece in the 16th century writing about 11th c King Michael III Canmore, the reforming Christian king who transformed the pagans and their laws, particularly that of one certain pagan King Erwin:   Ane othir law [King Ewin] maid, that wiffis of the comminis sal be fre to the nobillis; and the lord of the ground sall have the madinheid of all virginis dwelling on the same.   Except King Erwin did not exist and Boece was purposefully writing a nationalist, Christian triumphalist history for his times and audience. But that didn't stop later historians from repeating it and embedding it in other noble privileges and historiography.  Moreover, as counter-proof, references to droit de cuissage aren't found in medieval sources where might expect it, ones which give us broader pictures of the rights, privileges and exactions of nobility. This 'right' is a fairly harsh one, crossing significant moral and class lines, and we would expect to see it in, for instance, places that we see broader criticism of nobility like songs and poetry.  By the 17th century the idea had become part of the imagining of barbaric feudal society and it was redeployed in other non-medieval contexts for the same result. Only in the 19th century did we begin to see the image contested, but again for polemical reasons. Those arguing for its existence argued as part of complaints against the continuation of ancien regime in France, the targets of the French Revolution, those who argued against the existence were medievalists steadfastly beholden to that curious Victorian idea of the 'golden age' of the medieval period.

So, From 1740 onwards in the British Navy, rum was watered down and had citrus juices (and sometimes spices added) to make Grog. This was to lessen the potency of the spirit and to help combat diseases such as scurvy on the orders of Vice Admiral Edward Vernon. Traditional Navy Rum, from which grog is made is of the dark variety, so one can safely assume that the mariners of this time would be drinking a watered-down dark rum. I say safe to assume, as despite the depth that the Museum goes to with regards to the rum trade and maritime life, no mention is made of the colour of said rum - at least in the public displays.  Add to this the fact that the colour of rum (and most spirits for that matter) is due to aging in oak barrels (plain barrels for golden,  charred oak barrels for dark rum) - rum was transported and stored, at least in the warehouse that I now work at, in oak barrels - and it adds weight to the hypothesis.

Several cities - Serdica (now Sofia), Plovdiv, Thessaloniki down in Greece, etc - were important hubs in trade routes between the Middle East and Europe. These places and the roads that link them were established during Roman times; some coastal towns along the Black Sea are even ancient Greek colonies. Anyway, life in these cities was very diverse even early on. There were Slavs, Thracians, Greeks, Turks, Jews, and Roma living in the same place.  Apart from that, most people lived in villages and lived off the land. The average person generally didn't travel outside of the cluster of villages where they and their family resided. Culture generally revolved around the Orthodox church and, beginning in the 9th century, monasteries were established and literacy was spread throughout the region. Folk rituals and beliefs were a mix of pagan and Christian stories and characters.  In the beginning of the 11th century, the Byzantine Empire conquered the region and retained power for about 200 years. I don't think much changed in terms of what I described above - the Orthodox faith and economy was pretty much allowed to continue as before. Bulgaria emerged again in the late 12th century and there was a second push to develop a nationalist and cultural identity.   The real change, though, came in the late 14th century, when the Ottoman Empire came to power. The Ottomans set up a system somewhat like feudalism. Each town and its surrounding villages would be governed by a Turk, who oversaw the local economy and justice system. Churches were allowed to continue operating on a limited basis, and Christians become second-rate citizens. The difference this created in the life of the average Christian person was profound - culture became highly region-specific and the development of artistic expression stagnated. To this day, the relatively small Balkan countries host a remarkable number of dialects and diverse folk practices.   In my opinion, life was pretty similar for Southeastern and Western Europeans up until the 14th century. The Balkans just missed out on 500 years of cultural and economic development - the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution, etc. As a result, many Western Europeans perceived Balkan people to be uncivilized and heathen. There was an interesting moment in 1876 when an American reporter, Januarius MacGahan, went to Bulgaria to report on the April Uprising and the Ottoman massacre of Bulgarian civilians. He was surprised to find that Bulgarians had well-organized towns, public officials, a tax system, etc.  Anyway, that's my two cents. I hope someone else can pitch in to correct any inaccuracies in my history, or to offer some perspective on life in the Northeast of the continent. Things must have been pretty different for those in the Russian sphere of influence."

In short, ancient freedom as practised for example in the Roman Republic was about collective self-determination. Modern freedom, on the other hand, as practised in modern republics, is dependent upon safeguarding the liberty of the people through the constitution. In practice, this distinction is somewhat blurry as the Roman Republic had safeguards as well as a constitution- but what Constant is getting at is the scope of these in the modern republic.  Institutionally, as well, the Roman Senate is incomparable because the authority which they had was not codified. Such authority would be incompatible with the standard modern notion of republicanism."
AskHistorians,3e2vmb,GlassCaraffe,8,Tue Jul 21 15:18:14 2015 UTC,"Whatever else you want to say about the guy (and many have said much), McClellan WAS a damn fine organizer, and was a hands-on leader. What's more, the man understood the power of image and military dramaturgy. By this I mean that McClellan fully grasped the idea that the way a commander carried himself, and acted/spoke was almost as important as what he did on the battlefield. McClellan radiated confidence in all things, and this had a positive effect on his men. This disposition, along with the fact that McClellan had a reputation for picking the Army of the Potomac up, dusting it off, and drilling it into a outwardly impressive fighting force wasn't lost on his soldiers.   So as to paint a picture, try to imagine the humiliated, disorganized rabble that huddled around Washington, D.C. following the humiliating defeat at 1st Bull Run. McClellan came in as commander, and immediately started getting the Army of the Potomac into fine fighting shape. He posted good sentries along his camps' perimeters to keep the soldiers together, and on a military clock. He instituted sweeping reforms in terms of his army's schedule to make sure the days were filled with drill and strict military discipline. He took a personal hand in making sure that commissary supply lines were clear and logistic needs were seen to so that the army was well supplied. He rode around his camps regularly with his massive staff, all of them superbly dressed and mounted, and gave speeches, and personally checked in on the men. In short, he made the Army of the Potomac FEEL like an army, and made them feel like they had a man in charge who got things done (and rightly so: he had a huge hand in making them a fine fighting force).   This narrative was largely repeated after the loss at 2nd Bull Run, when McClellan again came in, and reorganized the soldiers and reestablished the same level of discipline the men had known before. This time around, the affection grew out of a familiarity they had with McClellan, and the sense that they had that he had transformed them into a formidable force once, and would do it again.   The thing of it was, McClellan was a lousy battlefield commander, as seen by his repeated habit of second-guessing himself, and by his overly-cautious nature. He was great at getting an army ready, but lousy at using it effectively. And while the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac were indeed loyal to the man, and held him in high regard, I think it says something that these same soldiers overwhelmingly went against him in the presidential election of '64. By then, it probably was obvious enough to the majority of soldiers that if the war was going to be seen through to its hoped-for end (for the Union, anyway), that Lincoln, not McClellan was the man for the job. Lincoln had showed the unwavering resolve to support the troops when it came right down to it (via his actions) whereas McClellan's support of the troops boiled down to good drilling, camp discipline, and speeches. The latter examples worked to instill loyalty and fondness for a time, but again, when it came to which man they wanted guiding their fortunes, the Army of the Potomac seemed to grasp the realities of the situation as we understand them today.

As for why it is spelled Syngman Rhee in English, there are a couple reasons. One is that his name is western. In East Asia during the past, people with a French, English, etc first name would sometimes invert their name order to conform to western style. Second, it is common for Asians living in the west to invert their name order to conform with the custom there. Rhee lived in the US for several decades and was well known to policymakers by the time he took power as Syngman Rhee. Third, since these names are written in characters, each person has a bit of leeway in how they prefer their name to appear in English. You mention Park Chung Hee above. But when he first visited the US in 1961, Americans officials were spelling it 'Pak Chung-hui' in documents, using the McCune–Reischauer conversion. It wasn't until he told them that he preferred Park Chung Hee that it becomes standardized in US documents and then the press, etc."

AskHistorians,3e13vf,ManicMarine,39,Tue Jul 21 03:41:12 2015 UTC,"Early on (for several hundred years), ancient Greek was written right to left, like Phoenician. Eventually, for reasons that are not entirely understood, it switched to left to right as you say.  But there was a transitional period which gives clues. Starting around the 6th century BCE, Greek was often written in alternating lines. So for example, the first line of an inscription would run left to right, then the next would run right to left, then snake back to left to right. Even the letters would be reversed in the alternating lines, much to the confusion of readers. An example in English looks like this. This script is called 'Boustrophedon' for 'as the ox turns,' because it resembles the furrowing of a field. Such a system was somewhat helpful to experienced scribes, who could continue writing on alternating lines without having to readjust.  During the Classical period, Boustrophedon fell out of style and left to right become the standard. Perhaps left to right was chosen arbitrarily, most likely by some informal standardization process (as neither perspective held supremacy in the Boustrophedon system)."

Do we gauge this with a game of ""who can we remove in history and make the most difference?"" — if so, then General Leslie Groves is the true ""father of the atomic bomb,"" for his presence was arguably the most important of all of theirs, much more so than Oppenheimer's.   The Manhattan Project involved the labor of some half-a-million people. That's nearly 1% of the entire US civilian labor force during World War II. Most of them did not know what they were building. If we constrain it to scientists, at Los Alamos there were several thousand, and there were another several thousand spread among other important lab sites, including UC Berkeley, University of Chicago, Oak Ridge, Hanford, and dozens of smaller sites (MIT, University of Virginia, Princeton, University of Toronto, UC Davis, Iowa State University, and many, many more).   Identifying individual ""fathers"" (aside from the gender issues — there were at least 20 women scientists and 50 women technicians at Los Alamos) is probably not the best way to think about the project. The atomic bomb was an immense undertaking on a scale that can be hard to fathom. Trying to identify one or two individuals can be a way to make the history more personal, but it runs the risk of thinking that this work was about individuals, rather than about the massive collective undertaking. This is why, if anyone, I would put Groves at the top of the list — he's the one that really launched the collective effort and worked to keep it running.

I'm most familiar with the example of East Germany, which I think is the most interesting example for several reasons; among the reasons, because it was the most economically successful of all the Eastern bloc states (which means it could draw upon a decent base of support), but also a contentious crossroads of east and west, which meant there were highly publicized moments of dissent.   In the case of East Germany, we find that despite the notorious mass exodus of East Germans to the west, it actually had some of the least amount of dissent of any country in the eastern bloc. The East Germans rose up only once before the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1953: after that, not a peep out of the East German populace until mid-1989, months before the wall fell. Studies have shown that East Germans generally tended to believe in socialism, but they were more critical about their lack of democratic rights. Many studies have been conducted about a phenomenon in East German society known as the ""niche society"". The niche society represented people's overall behavior towards the GDR state: people would outwardly show support (or they just remained silent in public) but in private they would voice their dissent. The continued exposure East Germans had to West German television signals also gave them a unique vantage point into the west, which allowed private dissent to grow. But a lot of East Germans were very proud of the welfare state they had built. In the 1989-1990 period, in the midst of revolution, polls conducted of East Germans showed that they still wanted to retain their socialist state but move to a multi-party system and have free elections. When you have a society that you have lived under for close to two generations, it will breed loyalty. Furthermore, today we can point to phenomena like Ostalgie (a fascination with old East German consumer goods that can be purchased in fares) and show that there are Germans who still pine for the old days. Given the continued economic inequality that has existed between East and West (East being on the lower end), it's no wonder some harken back.   Now, I am not suggesting life was rosy or wonderful under the GDR state. But what we see here in studying an example like East Germany, is that there were people, millions in fact, who believed in its cause, just as there were many others who questioned its foundations. But, I think the most interesting fact we can learn, is that most East Germans saw the flaws of their state, but they believed in its basic ideals.

AskHistorians,3e2div,AdolfHidekiStalin,5,Tue Jul 21 12:44:41 2015 UTC,"Depending on how one defines their terms, some of the anticlerical violence in the Spanish Civil War could fit.  But we would have to be very careful about our definitions.  So let's start.   The ""last 2000 years"" hurdle is an easy one, since the Spanish Civil War began in 1936. ""Terrorist"" is slightly more difficult.  The violence against noncombatants in the Republican zone has been termed the ""red terror"" (as opposed to the ""white terror"" in the Nationalist zone), but that is a political definition (and a politicized term).  The perpetrators would hardly have seen themselves as terrorists, as many were making a political point with their violence beyond trying to instill fear in their opposition.  Repugnant as they were, the copious murders in the Spanish Civil War were largely targeted ones (though some of the targets were entirely fictitious, like the Nationalist execution of people they deemed ""Jews"" that were neither racially nor religiously Jewish).   ""Terrorist attacks"" is an even more difficult term to apply to these cases, as the attacks on clergy don't comfortably fit the definition of a terrorist attack.  The attacks on clergy happened almost exclusively in areas controlled by the Republicans and were ongoing for a number of months.  They weren't done to influence policy in Nationalist Spain, but rather to eliminate perceived enemies.  They were deliberately targeted at clergy, often individually.  It is difficult to attach the label ""terrorist attack"" to these kinds of incidents, depending (again) on one's definitions. ""Atheism"" was certainly present amongst many of the culprits of anticlerical violence.  The issue would come in with the ""primarily motivated"" part of that phrase.  Few of the people who perpetrated these attacks left behind records of their motivations.  Certainly some were vehemently hostile to the Catholic Church (as it is difficult not to assign malice when     People stuck cigarettes in the corpses' mouths and mocked the mummies.  Some even performed impromptu dances with the withered corpses ... In the church of San Antonio de Florida in Madrid the mob played soccer with the patron saint's skull (The Spanish Civil War as a Religious Tragedy, Jose M. Sanchez, pg 44)   People's primary motivation would have to be sorted out on a case by case basis--and I have not seen a source that has done this kind of analysis.  For now, I think we would have to not categorize anticlerical violence as ""primarily motivated"" by atheism.  This is especially true due to the longstanding tradition of anticlericalism in Spain that is quite independent of atheism.  Sanchez addresses that quite well in the aforementioned Tragedy, and he also points to other motivations.  The Church was hardly pristine prior to the outbreak of hostilities, and both corruption and malfeasance on the part of a number of Church officials both high and low contributed to hostility towards Catholicism.  As Sanches explains,   The anticlerical fury was a visible indictment of Catholic attempts to channel the essence of Christianity into narrow parochial ends.  And worse, those Catholics who were not sacrificed to the fury condoned by their silence unchristian, inhuman reprisals against victims of circumstance, and they publicly lauded and supported a regime built in large part on oppression and special privilege.  They became the clergy and laity of the church of vengeance, and they lost the opportunity to form the truly Christian church of reconciliation (199)   So to summarize, one would have to be extremely careful in defining one's terms.  For the general use of the terms in question I would not personally say that the anticlerical violence of the Spanish Civil War would qualify as ""terrorist attacks primarily motivated by atheism.""    EDIT:  While I was writing my answer, OP posted the following:   I would consider atheism a primary motivation of a terrorist attack if the purpose was:  a) To destroy religion in the name of atheism b) To attract attention toward atheism so that it looks like it's fighting for the people c) To make people rebel toward religion   With those definitions, we might categorize the anticlerical violence in the affirmative.  Reference Andrés Nin, who said ""The working class has solved the problem of the Church very simply; it has not left a single one standing.""  (pg 46)  I still wouldn't classify it as such, but with those terms defined much of the anticlerical violence in Spain during the Civil War would fit the bill."

However I have a very hard time considering any violence done by the Revolutionaries as ""Atheist"" and even the Cult of the Supreme Being being purely Atheist. It must be noted that secular isn't atheistic, it's simple a world where religion isn't dominating or guiding the government.   Finally, the violence of the Revolutionaries is also hard to claim as atheistic since they're motivated by anger against a God or the Church but the privilege that was using religion as a protection.

I'm glad this was brought up (Ph.D grad student in modern Spanish history here). We have to be careful when we talk about the anticlerical violence example. Anticlericalism has a long history, not just in Spain, but in the rest of Europe. Anticlericalism was SOMETIMES motivated by a total hatred of religion, but more often than not, it tended to be directed mostly at Catholic hierarchy and institutions, and not necessarily at the theology itself. Most Spaniards tended to at least be nominally Catholic, and their frustrations with the Catholic Church were more material than theological. That being said, Spain has a long tradition of anticlerical violence, usually as a reaction to the increased influence the Catholic church may have had at a particular time period. Anticlericalism came from liberal, republican, and anarchist circles, and each faction varied in the extent of its hatred towards faith. Some (the anarchists) were ideologically atheistic, others merely politically angered at the catholic church's attempt to interfere with the establishment of a secular republic (Spain's second republic, 1931-1936)."

OP is asking about the year 1000; it's safe to assume that they are asking about the people who used the anno domini calendar, which in this case would apply to most of Latin Christendom. Since the concept of 'European' identity isn't really relevant to the period in question, I think we can take OP's use of the term as an anachronism and move onto the real meat of the question, i.e., did medieval people in Latin Christendom (particularly commoners) react to the year 1000, and was it celebrated?   For the record, people in western Europe did mark the passing of AD 1000 and ascribed to it special significance. The extent to which such reactions were part of widespread, popular movement is debated by historians, as there is a paucity of written material (particularly with respect to commoners, as is to be expected), but both Rudolfus Glaber (d.1047) and Thietmar of Merseburg (d. 1018) acknowledge that AD 1000 signaled an important change. Glaber in particular, who was likely writing under the tutelage of his abbot, William of Volpiano, might have championed the idea that that AD 1000 would usher in a millennial age, corresponding with a renewed church and a transformed world. This certainly would have been a break from the traditional Augustinian view of the eschaton, but such conservative interpretations were not necessarily as widespread as has been traditionally thought among the 'anti-terror- circles and there is other evidence to suggest that there were general anxieties and importance attached to the new millennium that were held by broad segments of the ecclesiastical and secular elite. Even the popularity of Pax Dei movements and other popular reforms around the year 1000 may correspond to a millenarian sentiment. Such arguments for a popular response to the millennium, however, are far from conclusive, but there certainly does appear to have been a growing concern about the apocalypse in the years surrounding AD 1000"

AskHistorians,3e1vqo,vesi-hiisi,6,Tue Jul 21 09:02:31 2015 UTC,"Generally, Roman Criminal law didn't recognize (public) imprisonment as a valid category of punishment. This is true for all times until late antiquity. Public prisons and an associated system of imprisonment as punishment as we know them today are largely a development of the 18th century. In ancient times, corporal or capital punishment dominated, and prisons only served to contain the accused until his sentence or the convicted until the execution of his punishment - the most famous example being of course Sokrates, who appears prominently in his talks with his friends and disciples in prison before his execution.   A prominent use for imprisonment (in Roman legalese this is termed in vincula publica duci, 'to bring into public shackles') was related to coercion. The consuls had the power to throw people in shackles to coerce them to comply with their orders. Cicero (de legibus III, 6) recounts how imprisonment or monetary punishment were possibilities for Roman magistrates to enfore their will, of course limited by the veto of other magistrates of the same or higher rank as well as the possibility of provocatio, that is calling upon the popular assembly to acquit. Acting against these limits, or otherwise illegally imprisoning a Roman citizen at the time of the legal scholar Paulus (Paul., Sent. 5, 26 1f.) would lead to execution for those of lower status and exile for those of higher status. This was no sentence, it was just one of the methods of coercion available to magistrates, which had its limits in the other magistrates and the popular assembly.   One of the main uses for imprisonment was too keep the convicted secured until his execution. Now this is not a prison sentence per se since it only served to ensure the eventual punishment in the form of execution by preventing the convicted from escaping justice. However, in practice, there was no limit on how long someone could be imprisoned awaiting his execution. Thus, in effect, this could see a capital punishment mutated into imprisonment for life de facto if not de jure - in essence, what Caesar proposed for the conspirators of Catilina (by proposing to prohibit anyone from prosecuting their case, thus keeping them in remand indefinitely).   De facto, imprisonment was also the consequence of the second most severe punishment (after capital punishment) the Roman justice system could impose, the damnation to work in the mines (usually for life, though there was the possibility of release after 10 years if the convicted had become 'unsuable' - though without restoration of his civic rights). The convicted did their work in chains and were confined to their barracks, so in essence it was imprisonment with hard work.   The same is true for the milder form of this punishment, to work on public works, such as streets, the cloaca, service in the public baths, bakeries and spinneries (mostly for women), usually for three or ten years only, which again in essence was imprisonment with light (in comparison to the mines) work. These two forms of punishment were de facto equivalent to imprisonment, thus it is not very surprising that Roman Criminal law never developed a system of prison sentences; members of the upper strata could be exiled and thus suffer an equivalent punishment, since often they were under military guard.     In essence, public imprisonment in Ancient Rome was limited to remand and 'death row'. Late antiquity is a bit of a different matter, since it seems that imprisonment became more popular among some governors, and the amount of imprisoned increased. Slaves and debtors were also increasingly held in public prisons (debtors normally were in private debtors prison). But I'm not too qualified to talk about that period - we've got others here who can, though.   One thing one has to keep in mind is that Roman criminal justice was different in many aspects from modern systems. There were no prosecuting attorneys, and it was mainly in the hands of the damaged party to prosecute the perpetrator - which in many cases led to lynching and vigilante justice. Private prisons were a thing (mainly for debtors and for slaves, though these were increasingly regulated and outlawed in the later empire, and probably not as prevalent as was believed for a long time among historians), and until Augustean times the pater familias had a high degree of jurisdiction over his family - up to and including capital punishment. Provincial governors had liberties in which punishments they handed out, but imprisonment as a sentence in itself was probably very rare and is only known from isolated cases (e.g., for forcing others to gamble, for fortune tellers and prophets that incite the population, for the insane)."
AskHistorians,3e1vqo,Astrogator,2,Tue Jul 21 12:21:23 2015 UTC,"How does exile fit into this? Weren't certain people exiled to specific places? In I, Claudius several people (including one of Augustus' daughters) were exiled to inhospitable islands or other unpleasant locations, is there any truth to that practice and was it more than just incidental?"
AskHistorians,3e1vqo,GothicEmperor,4,Tue Jul 21 14:04:12 2015 UTC,"We have to differentiate a bit here. Exile, or exilium, in the original Roman context referred to someone who 'sprang away' from Roman territory to live in another place and thus escape prosecution (commonly for capital punishment). This was usually followed by an act called interdictio tecto aqua igni, the forbidding of roof, water and fire, which formally excluded the exulant from the Roman community (also depriving him of citizenship) and threatened him with execution in the case of his return. This was an administrative act, not a legal sentence.   On the other hand, there was the relegatio. This was a form of punishment (by the magistrates of the pater familias) where the convicted kept his citizenship (without the interdictio), but was either ordered to stay at a certain place, most likely far away from Rome, or forbidden to enter certain parts of the Empire. Seldom used against Roman citizens under the Republic (Mommsen writes that it 'never occurred as a sentence in court'), but increasingly in the Empire. Against people of the lower classes, it manifested itself generally as an expulsion from the city or a region for an amount of time (possibly indefinite), while members of the higher strata were usually condemned to stay at a certain place away from the city (Mommsen remarks that this was necessarily so since only those of enough money could be expected to have even the means to stay somewhere far away for a long amount of time - since there were no public prisons). This was considered harsher than simply expulsion from the city, and for the same crime someone from the lower levels of society could expect to be condemned to working in the mines.   A harsh form of this kind of relegation was the relegation from all of Italia, under threat of capital punishment on return, which was usually used against aliens, but after Sulla against Roman citizens, too. Still, this wouldn't include all of the Empire - a relegatio from all of the Empire didn't exist.   Internment was another form of exile or confinement. This occured increasingly after Augustus. This could mean being confined to a certain house, to a region of a city, the city or village, under the threat of capital punishment on return. Augustus was known to confine people to cities in Italy, or in the Case of Ovid to Tomis on the Black Sea. Claudius, on the other hand, was known for confining people to the city of Rome itself:    quosdam novo exemplo relegavit, ut ultra lapidem tertium vetaret egredi ab urbe   'For some he imposed a new form of punishment, that he forbade them to go out of the city past the third Milestone.' [Sueton, Claudius, 23]  Most popular though were the countless small isles included in the Empire (like for Iulia, Augustus daughter), or the oases of Egypt, since it was comparatively easy to supervise the exiled there.   Tiberius introduced the deportatio into Roman criminal law as a form of punishment. This was a relegation to a certain place with internment (usually the isles or oases) with the threat of capital punishment on return as well as the loss of civic rights and the loss of all property, which fell to the fiscus. All of these forms of exile could be indefinite or, often, for a specified amount of time.   So the difference here is that exile was something someone did to escape justice, while relegatio or deportatio were administrative acts to confine a person to or exclude them from certain spaces, under threat of punishment (up to and including capital punishment).   While it was incidental against Roman citizens up to the times of Sulla, it was increasingly used in the early Empire and became a formalized part of the Roman system of punishment."

AskHistorians,3e317a,-doesnotcompute-,3,Tue Jul 21 15:58:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not a WWI specialist, but maybe I can help! Apparently it was part of the initial plan of a war versus France, but it was abandoned circa ten years before the start of WWI.  Italy was since 1882 a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. It was a defensive treaty, which explicitly considered the case France attacked Italy or Germany, and wasn't valid against the UK.  Over the years, the Triple Alliance suffered for dissatisfactions between the parts and was several times modified, while Italy got in better relations with the UK and France, the ancient colonial rival.  In 1902 a secret pact assured the neutrality of Italy in case of a war between France and Germany, even if France had attacked first under German provocation. Meanwhile, the relations with Austria precipitated. A clause in the Triple Alliance acknowledged the interests of both Austria-Hungary and Italy in the Balkans, so that an expansion of one power there would have to be recompensated to the other.  In 1914 the Habsburg ultimatum to Serbia happened with the consent of Germany, but without consulting Italy. That was seen as a violation of the pact and separated further the two allies. When Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, the Italian government chose neutrality for it was not a defensive war.  In the first draft of the Schlieffen Plan, Aufmarsch West I, apparently the Germans expected an isolated French-German war, with a possible help from Italians and Austro-Hungarians via the Italian border.  As time went by, relation within the Alliance worsened; even if the Italo-French pact was secret, Germany had expected Italian neutrality in case of a great war, especially if the UK had joined; so the German commanders prepared Aufmarsch West II, not including the Italian front.  Even after the outbreak of war, Germany and Austra-Hungary tried to convince Italy to mantain an (amicable) neutrality rather than to join the war to their side.   I don't know of the French-Italian border fortifications.  About the UK, I don't think the Italian intervention with the Central Powers would have stopped them. On the other way round: the fear of a British blockade on the Mediterranean Sea was one of the reasons Italy was recalcitrant to join the war with its allies.  Italian Wikipedia has quite detailed information about  Italian neutrality and Triple Alliance Treaties."
AskHistorians,3e317a,dyskolos,3,Tue Jul 21 17:06:43 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that a German invasion of France via its border with Italy was simply very unlikely due to the war aims of the Germany at the time. The entire mindset of the Schlieffen Plan was to take the shortest route to Paris, seize the French capital, and force the French to surrender so Germany could turn around and deal with Russia. An invasion via the Italian border was #1: Much, Much farther from Paris than the lowland invasion route, #2: Much rougher and more difficult terrain, a lot of the border was covered by the Alps, #3 The long march on Paris would take a long time and would be straining on German and Italian resources, and #4 An invasion of France via the Italian border would leave Germany's border with France and Belgium vulnerable. Germany would not have the manpower to invade through Italy, fight Russia, AND keep a large defense force at its border. France and Britain would likely counter-invade and threaten to capture major German cities like Hamburg and Frankfurt.  The main upside I can think of attacking via-Italy is #1: It is more likely that that Britain would stay out of the war, as the most immediate reason for Britains entry into the war was Germany's invasion of Belgium; in this situation it's unlikely Germany would invade Belgium, and #2 This would obviously imply Italy would be on Germany's side.   That said, it IS a very impractical idea, and Germany would have likely been better off launching an invasion out of Alsace-Lorraine in an invasion plan that did not include shortcutting through Belgium."

AskHistorians,3e317a,Venmar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"It would take much longer, yes. Another issue is the supply and logistical demands that a detour through Italy would take. Weapons, tools, and supplies would be made in Germany, and then have to be shipped down to Austria, through Italy, and then up to occupied French territory. Same thing with trained men. While Italy or Austria could offer to supply some of the German army, it would be a much tougher logistical situation. Additionally, while the railroad network is superb in Germany and Northern France, it wasn't as good in Southern France, Italy, or Austria. Whereas Germany could make up for destroyed railroads in Northern France due to the proximity and shortness of distance, having to makeup for destroyed railroads in Southern France would mean having to make over a million Germans + thousands of Italians manually march across France on foot, as in WW1 tanks and trucks were not yet perfected for troop transport. This means that German and Italian soldiers either #1 had to go on long forced marches, which would make them tired and exhausted, or #2 march slowly so as not to lose morale or strength, taking much more time which Germany was not interested in losing. Since there weren't enough horses to horse millions of troops, it would just be a tough march. Germany and Italy would likely win, baring the likeliness of the French simply fortifying in Southern France (which could be easier considering all the hills and mountains), a much better situation than RL for the French since trench warfare in Southern France would be more favorable for France as it'd be far away from Paris and France's industrial powerhouse in Northern France, but it would not be as fast of a victory as Germany would desire.  Definitely an interesting prospect though. If Italy hypothetically, for whatever reason, joined up with the Central Powers in WW1, they would likely invade through the Franco-Italian border, but likely with minimal German or Austrian help, as the Germans would practically and logically still want to go via Northern France."
AskHistorians,3dz37i,seventyforester,35,Mon Jul 20 18:23:05 2015 UTC,"This is a BIG question encompassing hundreds of years of history and numerous sects, all with their own theological outlook, but in essence it boils down to the question of who or what is a legitimate source of religious  authority and by extension where socio-political authority stems from in Islamic societies.   I'll limit my answer to discussing traditional, mainstream Sunni Islam and Twelver Shia Islam. Note that other Islamic sects and groups have beliefs which vary considerably from what I've written below.   In very general terms -   For believing Muslims the question of the succession isn't just an historical argument, it directly impacts the way they practice today - to use a crude analogy it has some similarities with Christian arguments over Papal authority versus Biblical Scriptural authority. Although theologically the differences between Sunni and Shia are less stark than those between Protestants and Catholics.   Sunni Muslims believe that religious authority comes directly from the Koran and from the example of the life of Mohammed (pbh). They do credit Sunni religious scholars and leaders with having some authority to interpret scripture, but in a much more limited capacity than that ascribed to their Shia counterparts by Shia Muslims.   Sunni Muslims recognise Abu Bakr as having been properly elected to succeed Mohammed (pbh) as a political and social leader. He is described as having been a close companion of Mohammed (pbh) during his life and as a model Muslim. His suitability to succeed, in Sunni belief, stems primarily from his ability and willingness to emulate Mohammed (pbh) and they assert that Mohammed (pbh) chose him as his successor.    Shia Muslims believe that human beings other than Mohammed can be a source of considerable legitimate religious authority, especially if they have some claim to kinship with Mohammed (pbh). They don't believe in any Prophets after Mohammed (pbh) but they recognise certain individuals as having the gift of divine revelation.   This also impacts their interpretation of Islamic scripture as they place more emphasis on those Sunnah and Hadiths which are attributed to Mohammed's close family and associates.   They view Ali as having been the legitimate successor not only because they assert he was chosen by Mohammed (pbh) but also because they believe that he and his descendent were divinely appointed by Allah.   The most prominent manifestation of this distinction in modern times is probably role of the Ayatollahs in Shia Iran, they exercise considerably more influence as interpreters of Islamic scripture and the perceived will of Allah than any equivalent Sunni clerics.

AskHistorians,3dz37i,intangible-tangerine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"I'll be a bit late to the party, and u/intangible-tangerine already answered the question well, but there's a few things I need to add.   Broadly speaking, we can divide the authority of Prophet Muhammad into two spheres. These spheres generally overlapped a lot in his lifetime. These two spheres were his authority as revelator and ultimate interpreter of the Qur'an and his authority as the political leader or ""sheikh"", if you will, of the fledgling Muslim neo-tribe (this term was used by Reza Aslan in his book No god but God to describe the Medinan state, and I am immensely fond of it) based on common religious identity rather than tribal affiliation. Upon Muhammad's death, these two spheres of authority were up in the air. All self-professed Muslims (except the Ahmadiyya and perhaps other fringe groups) believe that Muhammad was the final prophet, and that revelation ended with him.  Upon Muhammad's death, the Muslim community found itself divided about the question of authority. I won't delve too deeply into the political machinations at first, but the split was largely political. Abu Bakr, Umar, and Ali were the three contenders for the succession. It seems that Abu Bakr and Umar met with other tribal leaders in the Muslim community, and at this meeting Umar pledged his allegiance to Abu Bakr, as did many other leaders. Shi'a sources indicate that this clandestine meeting, known as the Saqifa Bani Saidah (named after the tent of the tribe to which it belonged, where the meeting took place) took place while Ali was attending Muhammad's funeral.  Abu Bakr inherited Muhammad's temporal authority as sheikh or leader of the Muslim neo-tribe. His role, as Khalifat RasulAllah, or the Deputy/Successor of the Messenger of God, was largely political. A significant minority of Muslims believed that the entire Saqifa was a sham, because according to them Muhammad had already appointed Ali as his successor at the Ghadir Khumm sermon during his pilgrimage - according to several traditions attested by both Sunnis and Shi'is, Muhammad called Ali up to a makeshift stage and proclaimed ""man kuntu Mawla, fa haza Aliyyun Mawla"" - he whose Mawla I am, Ali also his is mawla. The meaning of the word Mawla is debated - Sunnis insist that Muhammad was proclaiming Ali as his friend and ally (something Muhammad was fond of doing, as it seems that he and Ali were very close being first cousins and Muhammad having been raised by Ali's father Abu Talib as a son of his own), Shi'is claiming this was Muhammad's appointment of Ali as not only his successor in the sphere of political authority as the Khalifat RasulAllah of the Muslim neo-tribe, but ALSO as the successor to his spiritual authority without the status of Revelator. In other words - Muhammad was still the final prophet, but not the final interpreter of the Qur'an. In Shi'a eyes, it was Ali's job, after Muhammad's passing, to continue interpreting the Qur'an for the Muslims. So to answer the question... WHY does it matter? Well, it matters differently depending on which side you fall. To Sunnis, things shook out more or less as they were supposed to - Muhammad's temporal authority was passed down properly for at least the Rashidun Caliphate. From the perspective of Shi'as, however, the leadership of the Muslim community has almost always been in the wrong hands (unless you are an Nizari or Bohra Ismaili Shi'a and accept the Fatimid Caliphs). The entire history of the Shi'a has been the denial of rightful leadership to Ali and his descendants. To them, it is more than a political betrayal - remember, Ali in Shi'a eyes, is also the interpreter of the Qur'an. However, this interpretership did not die with Ali - it continued in Ali's sons, and grandsons, down the male line. Ali's role become generally more mystified and exalted and by the time of his great grandson Muhammad al-Baqir and great-great grandson Ja'far as-Sadiq became fully fledged as the role of Imamah as all the major branches of Shi'a understand it today. Not only has the Muslim community been led astray politically, but to the Shi'a, it has also been led astray spiritually."

AskHistorians,3e0kqe,bic213,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:01:45 2015 UTC,"Well Greek mythology has been popular to the media, and has many derivatives, as it keeps inspiring artists to create new stories.  It is popular as a fantasy setting these days, as also Tolkien's universe.  But the actual Greek mythology wasn't supposed to be a fantasy setting. Most of it was about giving explanations to various matters that couldn't be answered somehow else, and as a form of early 'science'. I say that, because most of what is included in the divinities of ancient Greek folklore, are personified natural forces or objects. For example Hesiod's creation story says that first Gaia (Earth) appeared, and that she gave birth to Uranus (Sky), and that then they got married and gave birth to Potamos (River), Oceanos (Ocean), Oros (Mountain)...  Interesting to know is that the Greek language is such, that most of each words will either be masculine or feminine. So Sky is masculine, and Earth is feminine, and that way its easy to come up with the rest of the details for attributing personalities to them.  For me, the part of Hesiod I wrote about, is about is seen as a form of primative natural history: It basically tells that the Sky came to existence by Earth (I assume Sky is the Atmosphere, as you know, without Earth's mass for there to be substantial gravity there would be no atmosphere), and that then the Earth and Atmosphere had intercourse (meaning the ingredients of these two were mixed and reacted with each other,) resulting to the creation of the Oceans, Rivers, etc."
AskHistorians,3e3aw6,calvinhobbesliker,4,Tue Jul 21 17:05:57 2015 UTC,"Let me say first that the ""good guy/bad guy thing"" is not very meaningful in history, especially when narrating wars. E.g. the Soviet Union first allied with Hitler in eating up Poland then fought the direst battle in the war against the Nazi; there was Dresden and there was Coventry. The list can go on forever: it's not the purpose of history to point out the baddies.  That said the arguments brought forth by KurtGodel7 are nothing else than Nazist apology, and quite false too.   The Ukraine famine, or holomodor, is a terrible mass starvation which in Ukraine and many other countries is today considered a crime against humanity. And it's one of the main reasons we today consider Stalin a terrible stateman, a cruel ruler, briefly a baddie. But again, the death toll is not a measure of a nation's badness; and the misdeeds of the Soviet government do not annihilate those of Nazis. No Ally was friendly to the Soviets until the German invasion of Russia. Heck, UK and France even made the Spanish Republicans lose because of the influence Stalin had! UK and France did not invite the Soviets to the Munich Agreement in 1938! And in 1939 Germany and the USSR signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of non aggression: yes, until 1941 and the operation Barbarossa, the Nazi were in amicable relation with the starver Stalin! The anti-German policy is the casus belli Nazis used to invade Czechoslovakia, Poland, and such. Now I don't know much of Poland in the 30's (except it was another authoritarian regime), and it is possible that something anti-teutonic happened), but it seems to me that KurtGodel7 is repeating the Nazi propaganda of war ""to save the endangered German minorities"". Remember also that it was Germany the expansionist nation who already gobbled up Austria, the Sudeten, Bohemia.    Lastly, to explain the Holocaust with the scarcity of food because of the British blockade is ridiculous. First, until 1942 the Axis was winning and it was the UK who was encircled and struggling with supplies. And the enslavement, exploitation and mass killing of Jews and Poles and Slaves was planned and executed well before time. Hell, the ""you made me do it"" is not an argument! And it's at best childish to think that the organised extermination of entire categories of people was just a severe measure to ensure the survival of the others. It does not account for the constant dehumanization, torture, theft, hatred and so on. Besides, Nazi Germany has not been the only country in history enduring a blockade.   To sum up, you have seen nazi propaganda at its best (i.e. worst). Nazi Germany was not the absolute evil, nor the only state to be responsible of cruel acts violating human rights and dignity, and Stalinist USSR was an equal. The fact is that it made a banner of it. Mass displacement, racism, planned extermination was theorized by Hitler and executed by his regime."

Before WW2 started, the Soviets had murdered more people than the Germans (e.g, the Ukraine famine).   This is the Genocide Olympics argument.  Just because one group killed less people than the other group doesn't mean that they are better.     A lot the Allies (UK, France, US, Czechoslovakia) were friendly to the Soviets, who were planning to conquer Germany.   Yes, they were so friendly that they spent a good two or so years fighting the Soviets during the Russian Civil War and proceeded to refuse to diplomatically recognize them.  This is at the same time that the Germans were secretly cooperating with helping to arm the Soviets, which doesn't even include the matter that the Germans helped Lenin get into Russia in the first place.  Germany was one of the first countries to recognize the Soviet Union, whereas the US didn't until nearly ten years later.    Poland had an anti-German foreign policy, edged on by false promises from the Entente (who didn't attack Germany after declaring war and didn't even declare war on Russia after she also invaded Poland). Poland also desired German territory, including East Prussia.   Germany also desired Polish territory, including Posen/Poznan and Oestprussen, and Silesia.  This was egged on by reactionary and fascist revanchists, including the German National People's Party and the Nazis.  Germany also worked with Poland to seize pieces of Czechoslovakian territory as well in 1938.   Once the war started, the British and other allies imposed a ford blockade of Germany. This prevented her from feeding all the people within her borders. Therefore, Germany decided to kill the ""lesser"" peoples (Jews, Poles, Slavs, etc.) in order to save the Germans from starving, since some people would have to die anyway. The Allies knew this would happen and thus are responsible for these deaths.   The Germans were persecuting the Jews and other foreigners well before hostilities began in 1939.  And they specifically went out of their way to build industrial death camps and used significant resources to massacre people.  Hardly ""starvation conditions.""   The Germans could not save these people by making peace, since they would have to unconditionally surrender, including to the Soviets.   The Germans surprise attacked the Soviets 2 years after initial hostilities.  This doesn't make any sense.   A bunch of people have been arguing with him on the thread, but I don't find most of their responses that effective, especially since a lot of them consist of ad hominems.

Under President Adams, the U.S. Navy covertly supplied the young Republic of Haiti; U.S. forces fought alongside Haitian soldiers in several small firefights. A few years later, the U.S. government offered quiet support to a number of revolutionary regimes across Spain's American colonies.   The progressive government of Benito Juarez received covert U.S. funding against the brief Imperial Mexico of Maximilian I throughout the Civil War, and U.S. troops participated in some skirmishes against Maximilian after the war.   In the runup to the Spanish-American War, the plight of the heroic Cubans was trumpeted in every major American newspaper - but after the war, it became plain to a public that didn't know it that the majority of the Cuban freedom fighters were black former slaves who'd been fighting to gain control of their lives from Spanish overseers.   (This is obviously not an exhaustive list.)   I imagine that what you're looking for, though, is a Cold War example. The showcase example there is Yugoslavia. In 1948, Yugoslavia's dictator (and WW2 partisan hero) Josip Tito broke with Stalin, and promptly applied for Marshall Plan aid. In order to prop up a socialist government without connections to the Warsaw Pact, Truman and his successors provided economic aid to and traded with Yugoslavia.   Throughout the 1950s, Yugoslavia received nearly $2 billion in U.S. economic and military aid, equal to about 1 percent of its annual GDP.

AskHistorians,3dytx9,Broadbeard25,11,Mon Jul 20 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"OK, so this is a complicated question because with Britain we have an incredible level of archaeological detail. I'll give a very simplified version and am happy to expand on anything you would like.  OK, so broadly speaking ""Celtic"" is a language group which incorporates the modern languages of Welsh, Irish, Cornish, Breton, Manx and Gaelic. Befire the Roman expansion however the Celtic languages spread from more-or-less eastern Spain all the way to Austria. Remember this is a language family and not a language, so think ""Romance"" rather than ""French"". In Britain, Celtic languages were spoken at least south of Scotland (will clarify soon) and possibly across the entire island. This language family is more or less correlated to the La Tene archaeological culture, so there seems to have been a real cultural complex spread across much of what is now northern and central Europe.  ""Gaul"" was the Roman word for the territory of more-or-less modern France with some expanded borders, and the Gauls were those who lived within. Immediately before Roman conquest, southern Britain was very tightly bound to Gaul, to the point that southeast England was considered ""Belgic"". Because of this, it exhibited an unusually high level of material development that made it really distinctive from the rest of the island. To be absurdly simplistic, we can divide Britain into four major zones: southern England,  in the ""Belgic"" zone, the decentralized and less materially rich zone of northern England, the still less materially rich zone going into Scotland, and then the densely populated and materially rich zone of northern Scotland and the islands. So even though much or all of the island was Celtic speaking there was a great deal of diversity in lifeways and culture.  The Picts emerge near the end of Late Antiquity and in the Early Middle Ages. they are a somewhat ""mysterious"" group in that establishing their cultural geneology and even their language is extremely difficult. They were probably the descendants of the Caledonians of the Roman times, but some have even suggested their language was non-Indo-European. They were certainly considered distinctive by Bede, who divided the peoples of Britain into fives groups of the Latins, Angles, Welsh, Scots and Picts.

AskHistorians,3dz930,PyroNecrophile,27,Mon Jul 20 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"I am going to preface this answer by stating that I am by no means an expert on either the history of violence or the history of childhood or the ways in which the two might intersect but I am an historian of gender with a growing interest in the history of emotions and I have a strong background in psychology and the social sciences. (My first degree was in psychology and my second in history).  The author in question, Lloyd deMause, is the chief proponent of a discipline known as ""psychohistory"" or the study of the psychological motivations of historical events. It is a controversial field of study and as of yet, no institution of higher learning has opened a department of psychohistory nor does any university offer either an undergraduate or postgraduate degree in the subject. This is important to note because it reveals something important about the wider academic reception of the field which remains both critical and often quite dismissive. Psychohistory is criticized because it is theoretically poorly defined. It relies on a number of social scientific methodologies but there is no clear indication of when a certain methodology should be more applicable than another. Moreover, deMause himself has been criticized because his work very rarely relies on credible research but I will come back to this in a moment.  One of the main issues that historians who choose to adopt a psychological approach to the study of the past must face is the fact that one cannot reliably or accurately impose contemporary psychological theory on the people of the past. The influence on behavior exerted by external factors including cultural norms, societal structure, economy, law, religion, and the natural world cannot be ignored and such influences would have had a significant impact upon the way in which a person, or an entire population of people, experienced and understood the world around them which would then have affected the way in which they interacted with that world from the level of impulse and motivation to actual behavior performance. The only truly empirical way of measuring psychological motivation in a past era would be to artificially recreate the environment of interest and then expose a group of people to that environment alone from birth onwards before measuring their attitudes and behaviors and obviously, this would be an ethical impossibility. Furthermore, though we historians have a pretty good grasp of ""how things were"", we still don't understand everything about the past and so recreating such an environment would not be entirely possible.  But, back to the topic of your question. One of the biggest red flags in the chapter linked is the complete absence of references to primary sources. DeMause did not analyze any materials contemporary to the periods he's discussing but instead simply cobbled together the work of others in such a way as to suggest complete agreement with his thesis and his views. Though others like Lawrence Stone and Edward Shorter have also perpetuated a grim view of historical childhood deMause relies quite a bit on shock value and employs vividly detailed descriptions of childhood atrocities to appeal to the reader's emotions. Perhaps he might be forgiven for taking this approach since he is not a scholastically trained historian. That is, he left a graduate program in political science to become a lay psychoanalyst before becoming intimately involved with the subject of psychohistory.  I would be cautious about accepting anything presented in The Origins of War in Child Abuse without some kind of serious scholarly corroboration, preferably from an historian who actually interrogates primary sources and whose academic peers do not refer to his or her work as ""outrageous and basically wrong"".1. Unfortunately, I don't have any suggestions for reading to offer you as I am not an historian of violence or childhood but perhaps another member of this sub might be able to step in and offer some recommendations.

I definitely took note of the shock value in his writing, and it just didn't have a ""scholarly"" feel to it. I noticed that alot of his sources were his own books, and I'm cautious about blindly accepting it as fact. However, regardless of some of his assumptions that he makes about history, it doesn't necessarily make the events historically inaccurate. I definitely hear the bias in his writing, and I'd prefer to read something less sensational and without opinions.  Unfortunately, I don't see many articles written about the topic, and this guy has lots and lots of literature, so I'm torn as to whether I weed through the psychological implications, but trust the historical events noted, or if I should take his work as untrustworthy.

His approach to studying history was guided by pre-conceived ideas about psychology and child abuse, which are themselves pretty passé now.  His use and interpretation of sources was often highly questionable, and it's clear to pretty much anyone who reads his stuff today that he'd gone looking for evidence of a pre-existing theory in the past.

AskHistorians,3e0to1,Funkit,6,Tue Jul 21 02:14:02 2015 UTC,"The end of the occupation of Austria had its genesis in post-Stalinist turn in Soviet diplomacy and it gelled well with both the new direction for foreign policy of the emerging Thaw and the security needs of the USSR.  From the end of the war up to 1955, Austria was an occupied nation much like Germany- divided up between American, French, British, and Soviet zones. Unlike Germany, there was a negotiated end to the military occupation in 1955 with the ratification of the Austrian State Treaty. The Austrian state pledged neutrality in European affairs, would not host foreign military bases, and would never seek a reunion with Germany. The Soviets agreed to these conditions because it ended an occupation that was a drain on the Warsaw Pact's defenses and publicly signaled a new turn in Soviet foreign policy after Stalin. More cynically, demilitarizing Austria also created something of a gap in NATO's continental-wide front via a neutral  Swiss-Austrian gap that bisected NATO's northern and southern theaters.   Many in the US State Department saw the Austrian State Treaty as Austria undertaking a voluntary decision to become another Switzerland. There was little concern of ""Finlandization"" in which a peace treaty with the Soviets also carried certain defense obligations. The policies of subsequent Austrian governments bore out this as they hewed to a generally pro-Western foreign policy. One problem that the Treaty also solved for both blocs was that Austria, and especially Vienna, was not geographically suited for military division as Germany. Unlike Berlin, officers from the four powers patrolled Vienna together and this was a cumbersome military situation. So the Treaty had a practical effect of eliminating what had become a clumsy arrangement.  The Western influence of the Cold War upon Austria was largely cultural. Austria's borders to the West were open, those to the Eastern bloc were, for the most part, not. Western products, tourists, and other connections integrated Austria into the West, even if it could not join the various Western defensive alliance systems. Therefore, Austria emerged as something of an anomaly during the Cold War, culturally and economically connected to the West, but politically restrained by the Treaty from joining either Superpower bloc."

AskHistorians,3e0to1,kieslowskifan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:27 2015 UTC,"The Allied occupation of Austria was the net result of several failed Allied policies and incorporated what were allegedly the lessons of the interwar period. The Soviets never elaborated their solution to the Austrian question during the war beyond vague ideas of decoupling German Austrians from Hitlerite Prussianism. Part of the rationale behind this was to keep the Soviet's options open during the postwar resettlement of Europe. As a result of this murky Soviet position, some in the British Foreign Office conceived of Austria being the center of either a South German confederation incorporating Bavaria and Switzerland or a Danubian confederation with the states of Southeast Europe. Either state would serve as a counterweight to any resurgence of a Prussian Germany in the immediate future. Geoffrey Harrison, the Foreign Office's chief planner for postwar Austria, claimed ""Austria is, from several points of view, the keystone of the European arch ,"" because its strategic location allowed it to control trade in the Danube basin. Harrison still anticipated some military occupation of Austria, and also noted that a confederation was a very difficult matter to implement. Both the British and the Americans felt that a military occupation would be doubly important if these confederation plans could not become reality. When drawing up the postwar map at Versailles after the First World War, some Allied planners felt a merged Austria and Bavaria would be a strong enough entity to counteract Prussian militarism. The apparent ease with which Hitler occupied Austria in 1938 seemingly justified these concerns that Austria as a state was too small and weak to resist any great power. UK Deputy Undersecretary of State Oliver Harvey claimed:   were it not for the strategic importance of keeping Austria separate from Germany, we could let this flabby country stew. It is clear that Austria is doing next to nothing for herself and we shall have the greatest difficulty in infusing life into her after the war. There are no political leaders inside or outside the country who command any following. Austria will fall into the first arms which are opened to her.   As these confederation ideas proved stillborn, the Americans declared it was highly contingent that the Allies have a proper occupation plan as Allied forces neared Germany. Shortages of men and material made both the British and the Soviets pressure the Americans into accepting an occupation zone in Austria, which the Roosevelt administration was reluctant to do.   The result was a relatively haphazard occupation plan for an independent Austrian state as Roosevelt's State Department saw the British confederation plans as too unwieldy. The Truman administration, in light of the emerging Cold War, reversed course and proposed an East-West division of Austria in 1947, but the Soviets balked at this idea. The communist's electoral defeats in November 1945 Austrian elections had underscored to the Soviets the generally unfavorable attitude many Austrians held towards the Soviets. The fear in Moscow was that settling the Austrian question on terms proposed by the West would only benefit the West and undercut Soviet security. The result was stasis in Austria until the negotiations for the State Treaty began after Stalin's death.   One of the real winners in this fractious debate over occupation zones and the postwar order were the Austrians themselves. Although Hitler forced the Anschluss and many Austrians did not have a choice in the matter, the fact was many Austrians were active willing participants within the Third Reich and its crimes. With the notable exception of Austrian Jews and political opponents of National Socialism, Austrian Germans enjoyed the full benefits of Reich citizenship as well as the compulsion to serve in the military. The Allied wrangling over postwar Austria and its propaganda to decouple the Austrians from Prussian Germany provided an opportunity for Austrians to forget this inconvenient past. Catholic conservatives moved away from pan-Germanism and openly celebrated an Austrian national identity that was distinct from Germany despite their linguistic ties. The new Austrian postwar political and cultural milieu celebrated Austria's good-natured Gemütlichkeit and quaint Alpine vistas as the antithesis of the cold Prussian militarism of northern Germany. Both the government and educational programs up through the 1980s stressed Austrian victimization at the hands of the Third Reich. The election of Kurt Waldheim as president in 1985 and the international attention and scandal that came with electing a Wehrmacht veteran who likely had direct knowledge of war crimes brought the problematic nature of this selective amnesia about Austria's role in the Third Reich to the fore."

Having said that, I think (and this is only from my research) that the Byzantines were relatively accommodating in turning a blind eye to some aspects of the Scandinavian's behaviours.  The Varangian Guard were formed c.988 AD by Basil II and were initially formed of men from Kievan Rus who had recently converted to Christianity in agreement between Vladimir I of Kiev and Basil. It is likely that most Guardsmen joining were baptised but, as with a lot of Scandinavians, they may have continued to worship older Gods from the Norse pantheon.  Examples of crucifix amulets that also resemble Thor's hammer have been found and highlight the ambiguity in many ex-Pagans religion around this time.  As for close friends to the Emperor, look no further than Harald Hardrada. He was the Domestikos of the Varangian Guard after giving several years of service to Byzantium whilst in exile from Norway.

AskHistorians,3dxmv3,Floee,21,Mon Jul 20 11:22:08 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Yes!  Dostoyevsky frequently used contemporary Russian society as a setting for his short stories and novels. You can see similar depictions of Russian society in the works of other authors, such as Gogol's depiction of the life of a civil servant in ""The Overcoat"", or Lermontov's description of Russian provincial life in ""Hero of our Time"". These men, by and large, had either lived through or had secondhand experience with the lifestyles they described in fiction, and are quite reliable in faithfully interpreting daily existence in their stories.   The punishment itself is not unusual either. Given the vast expanse of the Russian Empire, isolation and exile to the far reaches of the empire were not unusual punishments. We in the West tend to think of the gulag as a Stalinist invention, but in reality, tsarist-era internal exiles and segregation from society were quite common. The expanse of Siberia made it a convenient place to send criminals, especially given the bloated bureaucratic apparatus of the 19th century Russian state.   As for the life of our superman Raskolnikov, Dosteyevsky's depiction is quite faithful. The average civil servant in St. Petersburg frequently lived in cramped quarters, often sharing a room with one or many others, and would certainly have a personal relationship with the landlord. Of course, not all these relationships ended in axe murder, but sometimes that's just the price of being a greedy old pawnbroker."

Rule of law was, and remains, a more nebulous and malleable concept in Russia than in many other societies. Bribe the right officials, and your shady dealings in illicit goods suddenly becomes a nonissue. Most officials with any kind of authority were corrupt in some way, due to the low salaries provided by the state and the difficulty of establishing any mechanism of punishment for wayward civil servants. So, while the penal code is very specific in the scope of punishment for certain crimes, this would only have been a loose guideline - circumstance and societal status dictates a great deal in what the actual punishment looks like."

AskHistorians,3dxmv3,mrtacoswildride,5,Tue Jul 21 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"It's pretty accurate, but I will say, Gogol was exceptionally cynical (and quite brilliant). If you read some of his other works, it's very clear he sees the foibles and faults of Russian society very plainly, and illustrates them with grotesque parodies that cut a little too close to truth. For example, Dead Souls tells the story of a man who journeys around Russia buying up the souls of dead serfs. In the Russian Empire pre-emancipation, a ""soul"" was how one termed a serf - if you owned three hundred serfs on your estate, you'd say you owned three hundred souls. Bartering these ""souls"" for various purposes was a common practice, yet the terminology seems vaguely chilling today, doesn't it? Gogol's novel is a masterful parody of the buying and selling of souls in the Russian countryside, and the moral faults of the characters portrayed therein.  But yes, as for The Overcoat, it's not far from reality. The life of a low-level clerk was quite mundane, the pay was low, and upward mobility was virtually nonexistent. Existence on the bottom rung of such a rigidly hierarchical society is not a savory place to be, which perhaps helps to explain the appeal of the egalitarian sentiments of Communism in next century. Even with Gogol's penchant for exaggeration and parody, his short stories and novels are almost always grounded in an element of truth."

Slavery had been reestablished in nearby Guadeloupe so the Haitian revolutionaries were largely under the impression that this might also be Napoleon's goal in Saint Domingue (aka Haiti); and in this they were not terribly mistaken.  Leclerc arrived in Saint Domingue in 1802.  He made promises that the revolutionaries could keep their freedom and military positions- how this all plays out is incredibly complicated.  Suffice to say, throughout the Haitian Revolution there was never a clear cut divide between two different sides.  Freed blacks, freed people of mixed race or creole, the British, the Spanish, French planters, French revolutionaries, former slaves, etc, were each pushing their own goals- trying to capitalize on the chaos and instability or maintain their place in society.  Leclerc tried to use some of this shifting alliances and identities to his advantage, but the fear of re-enslavement made long-term alliances with former slaves difficult.  The expedition was a disaster.  Nearly half the expeditionary force was dead after only two months thanks to endemic disease like yellow fever- the same diseases that killed most slaves brought to the colony within their first five years.  By the time Leclerc died of yellow fever near the end of 1802, over 2/3s of his force had perished. The troops will ill prepared for the tropical environment of the island.  They underestimated the abilities of the Revolutionaries as well- many of whom we believe had military experience back in Africa- after all, many of the slaves had been captured during wars.  If those odds weren't bad enough, General Rochambeau, who takes over after Leclerc, was incredibly savage and brutal even by the standards of the bloody revolution.  His actions- massacres, tortures, scorched earth- helped unite the quarreling factions that made up the Revolution.  So- if your question was, could Napoleon have ended the Revolution?  The answer seems to be a deafening no; he tried, and he failed at great cost."
AskHistorians,3e0w5r,b1uepenguin,3,Tue Jul 21 03:22:05 2015 UTC,What was the reason slavery needed to be reinstated in the colonies? Economics? Tradition?
AskHistorians,3e0w5r,b1uepenguin,5,Tue Jul 21 03:25:12 2015 UTC,"Economics.  Saint-Domigue had been the wealthiest colony in the world for a while thanks to its incredible sugar production.  As well, Josephine- Napoleon's wife- and her family/social circle are sometimes credited with pushing Napoleon to send the expeditionary force.  They were wealthy plantation owners from the Caribbean and the revolution (both the French and the ongoing on in Saint Domingue) were threats to their wealth and business.  But also- strategic interests.  Saint Domingue was the center of French life, wealth, and power in the Caribbean.  It was also a the main stopping point before reaching the Louisiana territories or the other sugar islands.  Without control over Saint Domingue, access to and communication with the rest of the Caribbean or Louisiana was just about cut off- so the island was key to maintaining France's presence in the Americas.  After it fell and France was swept away the Caribbean colonies were largely left to fend for themselves and Louisiana sold off to the Americans.  And if we might speculate just a little bit; even if he had succeeded in recapturing Saint Domingue (which is hard to even imagine since the attempt failed so badly), it's doubtful the French Caribbean would have contributed much to Napoleon's European military adventures.  The British blockades would have made any commerce with the Caribbean nearly impossible- nor would it have been easy to send reinforcements and relief to the Caribbean- which would have been necessary considering the toll taken by disease.  Consider that Rochambeau and some of the survivors of the expedition were captured by the British on their way back to France- and it doesn't seem like Napoleon had much of a chance to hold the Caribbean anyway."

Supplying 700,000 men over land, with the option of living off the land, is possibly easier than feeding 30,000 men across the Atlantic Ocean with the British controlling the seas.  Of course, that land invasion thing didn't work out too well, either.  My point is that logistics are an overlooked aspect of all military operations.  You can send men, guns and horses somewhere, but they're going to need food and water or else all the increased numbers do is make everyone starve to death faster."

What was worst is that you're sending a low number of soldiers against previous african warriors who probably knew the terrain in haiti. So you'd have the French soldiers marching blind. Sorta similar to the Americans using the terrains as there advantage against the British. So 30,000 was really underestimating the current situation. At best, it would've been advisable to have 100,000 sent. And keep 50,000 stationed there while the other regroup with Napoleon.    My point is that logistics are an overlooked aspect of all military operations.   Very true. I agree to it since I am mostly focused on military history  but never the logistics. So you do make a very good point in my case."
AskHistorians,3e0w5r,b1uepenguin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:37 2015 UTC,"I agree- if Napoleon had been able to send an army of over 100,000 he could probably have succeeded- certainly if he had managed to send 700,000.  As /u/larrymahnken wisely points out the logistics of doing so were beyond the French.  There wouldn't have been enough food to support the army; much of the plantations had been damaged and not replanted- though even then, they weren't growing food to begin with.  And then transportation which you both mentioned was a nightmare.  Some of the forces that did go to Haiti under Leclerc were captured on their way back to France so there is no reason to believe that Britain would have been able to intercept or sink larger forces.  Britan was pretty paranoid about being invaded- the army Napoleon took with him to Egypt was originally the Army of the North which was being assembled for a possible invasion of Britan.  Assembling a large force on the coast would have drawn a lot of attention and who knows how the British would have reacted.  It's pretty ghastly to imagine the death toll if such a larger force had made it to the colony.  I mean out of 30,000, 15,000 were dead in just months and not from the fighting.  Most slaves in the Caribbean didn't make it past their seasoning period (five years) before dying.  An appointment in the Caribbean for a British marine or French soldier was often a death sentence.  Yellow fever and other endemic ailments took a heavy toll on everyone.  Great question though- had never really considered what if Napoleon brought an even larger force.  Seems a grim enterprise."

The plan was to incorporate these territories into a customs union, called Mitteleuropa, that would facilitate the exercising of German Hegemony on the continent.  Congress Poland would be made a monarchical state, ruled over by a German king, with the Germans controlling the railways, economy and a number of military installations. There were also plans for the so-called Polish Border Strip, which would see the area of the Polish salient bordering Germany annexed and purged of it's Polish and Jewish population, and resettled with Germans. In the area of the modern day Baltic States, the plan was to carve out a Baltic Duchy, ruled over the Baltic German aristocracy that had controlled the area under the Tsar. Ukraine was to have a national government, but would be divided into spheres of influence, a German one in the North and an Austro-Hungarian one in the south, though the Austrians forfeited theirs in 1918. Crimea would have gone a number of ways: it may have been part of Ukraine, it may have become an 'independent' Tatar state, while there were also more tenuous plans to annex it and settle Germans there, giving the Reich a foothold in the Black Sea. Finland was also to be nominally independent, and there were plans for German monarchies to be set up there and in Georgia, potentially with the Kaiser's youngest son in the latter case. Plans for the creation of Belorussian, Azerbaijani, Ciscaucasian, and Don and Kuban Cossack states were also discussed.  Germany would control most of the railroads and whatever resources they could get heir hands on, such as coal and oil fields. Economically and Politically, most of these states would have had flag independence essentially, and there would have almost certainly been garrisons at locations like Warsaw or Baku, to ensure local compliance.

AskHistorians,3dxvj0,sleepingpie,4,Mon Jul 20 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"I took a course on Roman Law and was surprised by how easy it was to get a divorce. ""An Introduction to Roman Law"" by Barry Nicholas has some good information on the topic.  Roman marriage was essentially based on living together with the intent to be married. There are several formalities that parties would go through in a marriage, but these formal ceremonies were not legally required for marriage. Really, all that was necessary to begin a marriage was to live together and utter a formulaic phrase that boiled down to ""I intend to live with you as a spouse.""  Divorce was similarly accessible. Since marriage was almost solely based on intent, so was divorce. A spouse simply had to demonstrate the intent to no longer be married. I can't find the phrase now, but there was also a formulaic phrase to initiate divorce which boiled down to ""Take the things that belong to you and leave."" This was essentially invoking their right to no longer share their property interests.  The property interests in divorce were based upon a few facts, but weren't difficult to sort out. If there are no children, then normally the husband must return the dowery to his wife's family. If there are children, they legally belong to the father thus stay with the father, so therefore he can retain some of the dowery for the children.  These property interests could be big considerations before a husband/wife initiated a divorce. A wife might not leave if she has several children so that she might not forfeit her dowery. Similarly a husband might not leave his wife if he can't get afford to pay back the dowery. These considerations normally didn't have an effect if they had a wealthy mistress/suitor lined up.  With response to what the parties could do after the divorce, in Roman Law there is something called manus which essentially means the power of the pater familias over someone. In cases of divorce, the woman would return under the manus of her father (or other pater familias) and quickly betrothed to another man."
AskHistorians,3dy1mq,xxxWeedSn1p3Rxxx,13,Mon Jul 20 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"Around the Aventine there is a fair sized collection of Palmyrene inscriptions, which seems to imply a fairly close knit community of them there. The Palmyrenes are tricky to extrapolate from, as they were unusual in that they assiduously maintained their own language in inscriptions. It is difficult to know whether this means they behaved differently than other ethnicities or simply marked their presence differently. So there was seemingly an ""ethnic community"" of Palmyrenes, and may or may not have been for other groups.  Your other question is a bit trickier. The city of Rome was divided into fourteen regiones, and marker inscriptions indicate that they had distinctive characters, with particular rites, festivals, etc. It has been argued that these regiones activities correspond to different parts of Italy, but I am not certain how much real evidence is behind that."
AskHistorians,3dy1mq,Tiako,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:32 2015 UTC,"There's a good overview of this topic in the first episode of Mary Beard's documentary Meet The Romans that discusses not only the demographics of particular neighborhoods, but the mechanism by which an immigrant's original culture would fade away in favor of Roman culture.  The series is focused mainly on interpreting the inscriptions left by average Roman citizens on tombstones, and it's Beard's conclusion that a given ethnicity did not contribute to where one lived. It's specifically noted that there weren't any neighborhoods analogous to, for instance, a Chinatown. Part of the reasoning behind this is that non-citizen Romans were mostly brought to the city as slaves, and rather than associating with a particular ethnic group, they associated with the particular family who owned them. Adopting Roman culture was a path to citizenship and status, and given the relatively high frequency at which slaves were freed it generally did not benefit them to cling onto their old ways.  That said, the region of Trastevere (across the Tiber) is singled out as an area in the city known for its immigrant population, having had a significant Jewish population since the Republican era. Jewish communities would have been one of the most notably different cultural groups in the city, largely retaining their own language, customs, and religion across generations.

The vast majority of German populations east of the Oder-Neisse, as well as in the Czech Sudetenland, were not 'lost' in terms of 'becoming foreign citizens.' Rather, they were forcibly relocated en-masse into what would then become the 'new' German border between January, 1945 (largely as refugees fleeing the approaching Soviets) and in a more organised manner in the aftermath of the war. The first wave of Eastern refugees before the war's end suffered horrific privations. Many died of hypothermia and starvation during the early months of 1945, and many more were murdered by advancing Soviet soldiers in retaliation for the atrocities visited upon Eastern Europe by Nazi Germany and its allies. With the end of the war, the occupying powers decided that remaining Germans who had not fled from regions now part of modern day Poland and Russia (namely East Prussia and the more densely populated regions around Danzig), as well as large ethnic German populations in Czechoslovakia were to be forcibly relocated into the new occupied zones. Relocated Germans had to abandon their homes and most of their remaining belongings, and had no choice in where they were resettled. The massive upheaval that resulted continues to be part of the German post-war identity.  Consensus puts the number of forcibly relocated Germans by mid 1946 at ~14 million, or roughly 25% of the total postwar population of Germany. However, because of the extremely chaotic nature of a lot of these relocations - particularly those during early-mid 1945, it is difficult to determine exact numbers of how many were relocated, and how many died. I've seen figures of between 700,000 and 2,000,000 deaths among displaced Germans between 1945-1946, the vast majority of whom died or were killed during the Soviet advance between January and May, 1945.  The mass ethnic cleansing of Germans/German-speakers from East-Prussia and previously-German territories, combined with the generally horrific conditions on the European continent at the end of the war, created arguably the largest refugee crisis Europe has ever seen. However, the statistics you've come across that put Germany's population at roughly the same levels (though I'd be cautious of any statistics that claim to be overly firm!) in 1945-1946 are no great surprise. Those Germans living in territory that would be annexed with the defeat of Nazi Germany remain Germans - they were expelled, not naturalised into their new states.

For example, Messer techniques are shown in Hans Tallhoffer, among other fighting manuals.    A curved single edged blade is ""optimized"" for slashing or slicing.  The curve makes it easy to add some lateral force to the cut, like slicing a steak rather than chopping it.    The single edged blade will be easier to produce, keep and maintain.  It's also easier to use than a double edged weapon, and the single edge means the back of the weapon can be made thicker for extra durability.  Cutlasses were a common weapon among all sailors (not just pirates) because they are short enough to be well suited to a close packed boarding action.  They are also simple and intuitive to use, and required minimal training.  There isn't much room or time aboard ship for a common sailor to practice swordsmanship.  The thick, sturdy blade could also cut ropes or cordage if necessary.  A sabre is rather different than a cutlass, being instead optimized for cutting from horseback."

You can stab better in the gaps, turn the blade upside down and hit with the pommel. Also an sword was very expensive to make in the stereotypical medieval knight's time. So swords were often used as a status symbol.   With the increase of firearms armour decreased (as it was quite expensive to give an entire army armour that could stop bullets and even then armour was not foolproof). With the decrease of armour an slashing weapon became more usefull."

AskHistorians,3dxxvg,Imperial_Affectation,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"Since this was asked in your edit as well as by /u/afineguy - in Japan at least, double-edged swords were not commonly seen at all, probably due to a combination of several factors, such as the access to poorer quality iron, or simple swordsmanship techniques. Japanese iron was sourced from iron sand which meant that a larger emphasis had to be made on ensuring that blades made were flexible enough whilst retaining the sharp edge - this is a rather extreme example of why single-edged blades were preferred to double-edged blades, because (as /u/white_light-king mentioned) of the increased flexibility given by a springy 'backbone'. After the introduction of firearms, swords were almost unseen in battle (even before, their presence was not widespread)."
AskHistorians,3dxodm,grapp,11,Mon Jul 20 11:42:07 2015 UTC,"Before the invention of the telescope, astronomers attempted to measure the annual parallax of stars but were unsuccessful. They recognized two possible explanations for the lack of detectable annual parallax: either the Earth was stationary or the stars were so far away that the annual parallax was too small to be measured. Given the accuracy with which stellar positions could be measured in antiquity, Ptolemy and the others deduced that if the solar system were heliocentric, then the nearest stars would have to be at a distance of at least a few thousand times the Earth-Sun distance.   So heliocentrism and distant stars have been tightly linked since the second century. Tycho Brahe, for instance, rejected a heliocentric model in favour of a model where the sun orbited the Earth and all the other planets orbited the Sun. He had determined that if stellar parallax existed, it was less than 1 arcminute. This would imply a distance to the nearest stars of many thousands of AU.  When James Bradley explained the aberration of starlight in 1729, this was seen as definitive proof that the heliocentric model was correct. After this point, most astronomers would have taken the lack of measurable stellar parallax to indicate the stars were very distant.  TL;DR: It was hypothesized that stars were very distant in the second century, and most astronomers would have accepted it by the 18th.  Source: Foundations of Astrophysics, Ryden & Peterson"

AskHistorians,3duadi,afineguy,718,Sun Jul 19 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"It should be first noted that Spain and Portugal were ""given"" their parts of the New World from the Treaty of Tordesillas,[1] a late 15th century document which drew lines of demarcation between the Portuguese and Spanish (at that time, the Castile) colonies. The Treaty kept disputes to an extreme minimum, in part because the author of the treaty was Pope Alexander VI and the signatories were the Kings and Queens of the two empires in question, three parties you didn't want to piss off regardless of what side you were on. It was also prudent for Spain and Portugal to abide by the treaty, seeing as it ignored all other European powers' (see: those that later became Protestants) claims.  Unlike the Spanish colonies throughout the Americas, which were first ruled by a combination of conquistadors, missionary groups, and then viceroys from the Spanish kingdom in Europe, Portugal's colony was once ruled directly by the Portuguese royal family. When Napoleonic forces invaded Portugal, King João VI and company, with the help of the British, fled to South America.[2] This turned Portugal's crown colony in the New World to be consolidated and run as the base of operations of its empire for a time. This is the key. Spanish rulers stayed to contend in the Napoleonic Wars and had to rule its New World colonies from thousands of miles away at a time when news and people took months to travel.[3] As far as the Portuguese were concerned, their home now was the New World, and while they planned on returning to their homeland in the future, they had better do their best to protect and lead what they controlled directly.  The colony was transformed from a subservient part of a kingdom to the national seat of power, a new base of operations. Throughout the Napoleonic Wars and after, international trade continued between the Old World powers and Portuguese-ruled Brazil, bolstering economies on either side of the Atlantic while simultaneously recognizing Brazil's rulers as legitimate. Public works projects were commissioned, magnificent places of worship were constructed, and uprisings were much more easily dealt with.  When it was clear that Napoleon had been beaten and it was safe to return, King João VI left his son, Pedro I, as ruler of Brazil. A little more than a year later, Brazil's independence was championed not by a rag-tag bunch of mestizos and creoles, but by the King's own son, the current ruler of Brazil. No change in leadership occurred, but independence was claimed nonetheless.[4] Pedro I declared himself the First Emperor of Brazil, and while his father did not immediately recognize his son's claims, he could do little to stop them.  To quote João to Pedro, ""Pedro, Brazil will soon be separated from Portugal: if so, put the crown on your head before some adventurer grabs it.""[5]  Compare this to the independence of the Spanish colonies. Given their size, Spanish America had been divided into many viceroyalties and regions since its colonization. Rather than one, legitimate voice calling for independence, these colonies had many different factions of varying importance all calling for their own version of freedom. Uprisings from religious factions, indigenous groups, and military strongmen were common throughout the beginning of the 19th century. At the time, Spain could hardly control these warring factions, and had stopped sending Spanish soldiers to the Americas during the Napoleonic wars. In 1820, there was little more than 10,000 Spanish troops throughout the colonies, with half to them being New World-born.[6] In 1824, that number was greater than 99%.   Unlike in Brazil, the crown wasn’t as relevant or prevalent in Spanish America, so allegiances were dropped, calls for independence were raised, and warring factions resulted in the divisions we see today. These divisions can still be seen on some of the flags of Latin America today (ex. the five stars on the flag of Honduras call for the reuniting of the United States of Central America).[7]   Treaty between Spain and Portugal concluded at Tordesillas; June 7, 1494 Napoleonic Wars and Brazilian Independence Cruel War in Spain : Napoleonic Wars Brazilian Independence Historia do Brasil, Volume 4 by Raphael Maria Galanti The Americas in the Age of Revolution, 1750-1850 by Lester D.

AskHistorians,3duadi,to-be-determined,41,Sun Jul 19 17:22:00 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate more on the Honduras flag? I know very little about the history of Central America.  Wasn't El Salvador part of Mexico at some point?
AskHistorians,3duadi,DaChezmo,86,Sun Jul 19 19:33:41 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. El Salvador was the staging point for most of Central American independence. The first major revolts began in response to the Peninsular War (i.e. the reason why Portuguese royalty fled the Iberian peninsula for Brazil), and while several efforts at rebellion occurred throughout the 1810s, independence didn't happen until Mexico became a republic in 1823. Mexico acknowledged Central America's right to determine its own destiny just as it had done previously; shortly after, the congress of Central America declared itself a republic and free from Spanish and North American rule.  The original Federal Republic of Central America, so-named in its 1824 Constitution, was made up of present-day Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The FRCA was modeled after the United States of America. Unlike its Northern counterpart, it did not withstand secession and civil war: Nicaragua left first in 1838, and further attempts at reuniting Central America failed.  Nonetheless, all five original nations have flags that include the old federal motif (two outer blue bands with an inner white band). Honduras has also added the five stars to its flag for further representation of the FRCA."
AskHistorians,3duadi,to-be-determined,29,Sun Jul 19 19:55:55 2015 UTC,What were the tensions that caused the FRCA to split? And what caused it to be so much less stable?
AskHistorians,3duadi,Anarchist_Aesthete,56,Sun Jul 19 22:32:05 2015 UTC,"In this case, the main difference between the British and Spanish Central American colonies was how and when they earned their independence. The thirteen British colonies gained their independence by uniting together in a war against one of, if not the greatest powers of the world. It was the first colonial group in the Americas to fight for its independence and win. Solidarity to survive, especially against foreign actors and aggressors (Indian Wars, War of 1812, Mexican-American War) forced them to either work together and compromise over certain values or die. Moreover, the war for independence was what birthed the first leaders of the United States, individuals who were not only revered because of their beliefs, but because they had the experience to lead a new country and had also fought many wars prior to the war of independence successfully (Washington, for instance, learned from his mistakes in the French and Indian War). Lastly, the United States has always had access to arable land and natural resources, which are important to have when starting up a fledgling, pre-industrial nation.  Compare this to the FRCA independence and subsequent history. Central America was the runt of Spain's New World Empire. While there were rebellions, what ultimately gained them their freedom wasn't a hard-fought war or a lofty declaration of secession; independence was bestowed upon them by a superior compatriot (Mexico) against a tired, former, war-torn kingdom (Spain). There was no true war for Central American independence like there was for the thirteen British colonies, nor was there any built-up capacity to defend itself against rebellion or foreign aggressors, nor real incentive for either of the five regions of Central America to band together.   Relations were tense from beginning to end. Liberals and conservatives in all regions fought amongst themselves constantly, there was a far greater indigenous population to do battle with than those that dealt with the North Americans, and except for in Guatemala, there was no structure from which to run a government, nor a significant amount of valuable resources from which to build an industrial economy. Their first elected president managed to piss off liberals, conservatives, and the regional governors of each states, so much so that civil war broke out in 1826. Even the Catholic Church incited riots among the indigenous and the rural poor in an attempt to gain lost power in the region. When governance questions such as ""What should we do about slavery?"" or ""What role does the church have in our society?"" came about, the FRCA was in such a sorry state that nothing could hold them together, not even themselves.  Put simply: The Federal Republic of Central America had 99 problems, but independence ain't one."

However, the main reason according to the text, the divide, was mainly geographical.  If I recall there being also being other (in some cases minor and in others major) issues with the mix of different leaders of a region that had differing ideals for their land, as well as stronger influence from some of the natives and Mestizos who still held grudges against other natives, the disconnect (lack of roads and even ports) between regions that made it difficult to traverse harsh terrain for military control, and even feuding powerful families.  I am trying to remember the name of the text, but, my professor summed it up this way.  Also, he had us take a closer look at maps of the, now divided, countries, and you can see that most of the borders are very much geographical.   Edit: Forgot to add, that some colonies/regions did not want independence at the same time, or wanted to negotiate rather than fight, or (My professor said this, but I have not found proof yet. I would greatly appreciate anyone providing me with source to prove or disproof this statement) some colonies wanted to be autonomous but more like a vassal/protectorate/commonwealth of Spain.

AskHistorians,3duadi,lava_eater,980,Mon Jul 20 10:49:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not a historian, but as a Brazilian I can give you some insight with the limited knowledge i have.  Brazil was, as the United States used to be, several colonies, ruled by nobility, styled Capitães (Captains). As they developed, some of them have indeed tried to become independant from Portugal, but have failed doing it so. They were later extinct, and the colonial government was centralized in Salvador.  At the time of the Napoleonic wars, Portugal was allied with Britain, and was opposed to France. With the advance of Napoleon in the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal's Royal family came to Brazil to avoid being captured by the French. While here, the royal regent John VI soon-to-be-king elevated the status of Brazil from colony to kingdom. So, for a time, Brazil and Portugal were united kingdoms under the same monarch, first Maria very briefly, then John VI.   With the end of the napoleonic wars, the King returned to Portugal and left his son, Dom Pedro I as regent. This guy went on and proceeded to declare Brazil independent from the crown of Portugal, being styled the Emperor of Brazil. His demand was accepted and there was no war of independence and there was a very short war of independence (less than one year long), in which the Brazilian troops greatly overnumbered the Portuguese forces.  This whole process was VERY different from the way the rest of South America achieved independence, with different colonies succeding in declaring it separetly, and with revolution, replacing monarchy with their own forms of government.  Had the colonies succeeded in their independence wars, before the arrival of the royal family, maybe Brazil would be as divided as the rest of the continent.  Some states have tried to declare independence AFTER Brazil was dettached from Portugal, but these revolts were quickly repressed by the Emperor.  Edit:   Wiki source on the personal union and point information on the independence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Portugal,_Brazil_and_the_Algarves  Keep in mind this is not my source, I know this from literature in Portuguese, I figure it would be better if I put something you guys can understand.

AskHistorians,3duadi,nearst,24,Sun Jul 19 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"I gave more perspective on why the Spanish colonies broke up as they did here.  The short answer is that in the Spanish colonies broke up generally along the lines of colonial administration.  The densest colonies (Mexico/New Spain, Peru) took almost the whole of the Viceroyalties they were part of.  Captaincy-Generals (Chile, Guatemala, Venezuela), which were military commands technically under a Viceroyalty but mostly self governing also gained independence mostly intact (though see below for Guatemala).  The less densely populated Viceroyalties (Rio de la Plata, New Granada) broke up along the lines of audencias (the level of administration below the Viceroyalty).  New Granada became Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia.  There were also path-dependent weird quirks of history.  Bolivia was an audencia within the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, but has a particularly complex independence history because it was fought over by Royalist from Peru (Peru being one of the last major Royalist redoubts in the Spanish colonies) and Republican Rio de la Plata.  Uruguay was broken off as a buffer state (a sort of South American Belgium) with British support.  Paraguay, which had no audencia but a unique history as a Jesuit ""colony within a colony"", broke off from Rio de la Plata in part because of a particularly charismatic leader.  For several reasons, mainly particularly strong and dispersed local elites, he Captaincy General of Guatemala broke apart at the intendencia level (a level of financial administration below the audencia).  Panama broke off from Colombia decades after the initial wars of independence, in large part because of U.S. support, in large part because the U.S. wanted to build the Panama Canal.  For a slightly longer answer, see the post linked above.  Spain's insular colonies (Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, etc.) have a largely separate history, and continued to be ruled from Spain for decades after the colonies of continental South America became independent.  One thing not mentioned is that Brazil had a frontier--like the U.S. and Canada, it gradually expanded West as it built population density and state capacity.  In the Spanish colonies, the main frontiers were in the far north (the parts of Mexico eventually conquered by the U.S.) and the far south (Patagonia--much of which wasn't actually conquered until after Argentina and Chile became independent)."

AskHistorians,3duadi,MaxManus,15,Sun Jul 19 19:11:12 2015 UTC,"His demand was accepted and there was no war of independence.   It isn't exactly like this... There was the blockade of Bahia and Montevideu in Uruguai which remained loyal to Portugal along with several naval encounters between the recently formed Brazillian Imperial Navy against loyalist ships of the Portuguese Royal Armada, which was divided roughly in half it's numbers with Brazil's independence, until 29 of August 1829. Among which a particular incident occurred involving mutinied sailors who locked the ship's gunpowder magazine so as not to have to fire on their used-to-be compatriots.  The Brazillian Navy actually outdid the Portuguese Royal Armada, because it had hired English commanders, much more experienced than the Portuguese, among which was Thomas Cochrane.  Of course, all of this was in much smaller scale than the War of Independence of the United States, for example, but it did happen."

If you sum up all civil wars, it's more than Brazilian combatants dead in the Cisplatina War, Paraguayan War, First World War and Second World War put together. I wouldn't call it a cakewalk.

So not many casualties there, if any.   WW2 Brazil fought in Italy, with an expeditionary force of around 26 thousand men, and saw lots of land combat, besides taking part in air and sea combat. So, much more casualties than first world war."
AskHistorians,3duadi,JMorand,53,Sun Jul 19 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"Well... I disagree.  There is no doubt that the portuguese move to Rio de Janeiro in 1808 played a major role in giving way to the new country, not only oficially turning Brazil into a new realm but also paving the way for Rio to be its axis, making it the host of major institutional structures transfered from Lisbon. This centrality would also be important in the shaping of the country through the rest of the century, as Pedro II sought to mimic the french style (being Paris the sole head of the french state etc.).   But the unity wasn't achieved in a peaceful way at all. There were several battles throughout the country (Bahia, Pernambuco, Pará, Cisplatina - now independent Uruguay) and the fight for Salvador, the former colony's capital until 1763, endured until July 1823. Portugal only recognized Brazil as an independent country two years later. And, let us not forget, the new regime faced instability until 1840, when a coup anticipated Pedro II's adulthood and put an end to the Regency years. From 1830 to 1840, several provinces made their attempts to be independent from Rio. Maranhão, Pará, Bahia, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do SUl...  We could say that this whole idea of Brazil being this huge by its own nature is a construct of the Empire itself, which, after securing its borders by war, sponsored several studies in geography and history to build the concept of unity. Take the IHGB for instance, the Brazilian Institut for Historic and Geographic Studies. It was sponsored directly by Pedro II, and it aimed, from its beginnings, to build a Brazilian History that would efface regional characteristics and enforce the Rio de Janeiro centrality...  So I guess we are a talking about a project of historical writing that, in the end, was victorious. :)   For further readings, I'd recommend Jose Murilo de Carvalho's Teatro das Sombras, a book about the political structure of the Brazilian Empire, and an article by Manoel Guimaraes about the IHGB, ""Nação e Civilização nos Trópicos""."
AskHistorians,3duadi,pacmanus,13,Sun Jul 19 23:00:11 2015 UTC,"It does still sound like the key difference between Brazil and the Spanish colonies is that in the Portuguese colonies, the Portuguese crown explicitly placed one ruler over the entire collection, labelled it a single entity, and gave that one ruler authority over all the colonies, before any of them were independent ... and then they tried (or continued to try in some cases?) for independence but never succeeded in breaking away from this central authority.  In the Spanish colonies, it sounds like Spain faraway in Europe was the only central authority over all the colonies, and that made it much more likely that when they broke free of Spain, they would do it separately rather than as one entity.

AskHistorians,3duadi,KoldPT,15,Sun Jul 19 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"At the time of independence (1822), the territory that would come to be Brazil had more people AND more resources than Portugal, while Portugal without Brazil didn't have a lot to finance an extensive war (most of its former colonies in the east were now english or dutch, early manufactures weren't really going on, they hadn't fully recovered from the crisis following the Portuguese Restoration War). When the royal family went back to Portugal, they left Pedro I in Brazil, but he was called back after a few years and that would mean that Brazil would be officially downgraded from its united kingdom status and go back to being just a colony. The ""Dia do Fico"", 01/09/1822, (which translates to the Day of the Staying, more or less) was the day he 'decided' to stay in Brazil, under popular and the Liberal Party pressure. Quoting: ""Since it is for the good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. Tell the people that I am staying"". (""Se é para o bem de todos e felicidade geral da nação, estou pronto. Digam ao povo que fico""). The independence only happened a few months later (09/07/1822), though. The thing is that Pedro was still a Bragança and still heir to the Portugal throne, so, all in all, nothing really changed. On that note, there actually was a brief war between brazilian and portuguese troops in the territory from february 1822 to november 1823, that was settled with Brazil paying £ 2million to Portugal in 1825 (Treaty of Rio de Janeiro). Then independence was recognized and both countries now owed an absurd amount of money to England, the peace negotiator.   Gomez, H.T. Portugal y España, Siglos IX-XX. Vivencias Historicas. Boxer, C.

This guy went on and proceeded to declare Brazil independent from the crown of Portugal, being styled the Emperor of Brazil.    It's a bit more complicated then that. In 1820, Portugal went under a revolution which resulted in the establishment of a short-lived constitutional monarchy and the creation of a parliament, called the Cortes. The parliament demanded the King's return to Portugal and this is the reason why the Royal Family did so leaving Pedro behind as the Prince Regent. In September of 1821, the Cortes issued a decree that aimed to reform the governments of individual Brazilian provinces so that they would answer directly to Portugal, putting an end to a centralised Brazilian government. With no need for a prince regent, the following decree demanded the immediate return of Pedro, so that he could travel around Europe to be educated.  The Brazilian urban elites would see this and following decrees as an attempt to undermine their autonomy, fearing the return of the Pacto Colonial which would have the newly founded Kingdom of Brazil redivided into colonial states, losing their institutions and the freedom to trade directly with each other or other nations. This is something important that is generally glossed over, if addressed at all.  They turned to Pedro who at that point was starting to grow sympathetic to the Brazilian cause. Pedro defied the Cortes and declared he would remain in Brazil. The situation would later escalate into the declaration and a minor war of independence."

The traditional view that the only reason Brazil didn't break down into several countries like the rest of Latin America (although one could argue the case of the former province of Cisplatina, now Uruguay) because her independence didn't come with a change of the head of state is not itself wrong but is still erroneous."

AskHistorians,3duadi,hivemind_disruptor,29,Mon Jul 20 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"One reason was that Brazil had been organized as a singular political entity, while Spain organized their South American colonies into four viceroyalties: Rio de Plata, Neuvo Granada, Nuevo Espana, and Peru. This system, along with inherent cultural divides deriving for los indiginos, meant that the the revolutions and the prevailing victors (Bolivar, San Martin, Iturbide) had separate cabals and political and economic interests to appease.  This also created a difference in the length and degree to which the Spanish empire fought. Argentina was the site of British military interventions during the Napoleonic wars, which helped them establish an earlier degree of autonomy. Gran Colombia benefitted from Simon Bolivar, one of the most talented military leaders of the early 19th century (for evidence of this, study The Admirable Campaign). Mexico had the hardest fought and longest of the wars of independence.  So you have disparate start dates and leadership cadres. Adding to this problem, you have secessionism and a strong-executive/weak legislative tradition. This meant that when the strong man (Bolivar, Iturbide) died, there was a storm of competing juntas. Unlike the 13 colonies, the Viceroyalty system did not create any tradition of legislative bodies, only autocratic administrations of patronage and appointment.   Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese government during the Napoleonic wars. This shift, and the reforms of King Pedro II The Magnaminous, advanced and evolved Brazil as a singular unified polity. Thus, the transition from monarchy to republic, the Coup of 1889, was relatively bloodless.   Source: Bushnell, David The Emergence of Latin America in the Nineteenth Century."

After a few decades, the Portuguese crown created, then, the Governorate General of Brazil, a very centralized government of the colony.

AskHistorians,3dyddx,Commustar,10,Mon Jul 20 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"My own interests in the seventh century feeds into this in multiple ways. First of all, the chronology for this entire period is obscure, as contemporary sources are few and far between. This was the case for the Roman Empire, as the last Greek historical work stopped c.630, not to be picked up again until the ninth century, and the sources for early Islam, as Arabic histories only began to be composed in the late eighth century. These later sources are invaluable, but they were written in a very different context and so various mistakes/anachronisms crept into their narratives. Because of this, I think drawing up a basic chronology or a timeline is largely a fool's errand, at least given the current state of the scholarship. Theophanes the Confessor, whose ninth-century Chronicle is key to our understanding of Near Eastern history in this historiographical blackhole, for example literally misdated the reigns of all the Persian kings he chronicled and his attempt at marrying two calendar systems, the imperial indications (in 15-year cycles) and the Anno Mundi chronology (years from Creation), was riddled with mistakes for events in the seventh century. His contemporary, Nikephoros, did no better in his Chronicle: for the reign of Constans II (641-68), the patriarch of Constantinople only had something to say for the first year of his reign. Nikephoros essentially faced the same problem historians face today - he had no available historical sources to fill out the rest of this important emperor's time in office.  Of course, we do have sources from the seventh century, but most of them were not utilised for their historical value until very recently. They also have their own problems. Pseudo-Sebeos, our best Armenian source, was very sparing with his usage of chronological indicators, whilst the early Syriac sources only survive in fragments. Most annoyingly, the relatively detailed Coptic Chronicle of John of Nikiu literally jumped from talking about events in 610 to the Arab conquest of 640 whilst it was happening without any information on how the attack began. It is a very confusing source and probably riddled with scribal mistakes (it was translated from Coptic to Arabic, then to Ethiopic, which is now the only surviving copy), but it is still the 'best' source for the events of 640-2, which says a lot about our information for this period. Another useful chronicle that introduced a dating problem is the Paschal Chronicle from Constantinople, which was composed c.630 and is generally quite accurate, but manuscript transmission has (most likely) resulted in an event that happened in 629, the return of the True Cross to Constantinople, to be placed in the entry for 614. The various dating systems used, the indiction cycles and the imperial regnal years, have also caused some trouble, as it resulted in the return of the Cross to Jerusalem being variously argued to be in either 629 and 630. Recently, Constantin Zuckerman dealt with the problem by suggesting that the relic was returned to the Holy Land in both years, which just goes to show how confusing even a relatively 'good' source can be.  But perhaps the biggest recent discovery is the suggestion that the Arabs besieged Constantinople twice in the seventh century. Thanks to an Armenian history from the 660s, it is possible to understand that the Arabs were able to attack Constantinople in 654 and were seemingly only defeated because a storm destroyed their navy. The city was besieged again in 668, but this time it was recorded in a mainstream source (Theophanes the Confessor). Unfortunately, it seems likely that Theophanes jumbled his sources and misplaced the siege to 674-8, which is the dating you will find in basically every single history book until very recently. I outlined the arguments for these new datings here and you will see that these arguments were only made in the last decade or so. Much of this is thanks to a recent understanding that religious sources, such as saints' lives, are invaluable to our knowledge of secular events, as well as due to the growing usage of sources in more obscure languages. Progress is however still slow. For example, the theological works of Maximus the Confessor, which are so important to our understanding of Roman North Africa and Italy in the 640s, have only recently been re-examined dating-wise (in P. Booth and M. Jankowiak's ‘A New Date-list of the Works of Maximus the Confessor’, in The Oxford Handbook of Maximus the Confessor (Oxford, 2015), finally replacing the previous date-list from 1952), likewise for the basic chronology of the monothelete controversy he was involved in, which lasted from the 630s to 681, again thanks to contributions from Booth and Jankowiak from the last two years (!!!).  As such, for now it is sensible to just say that the jury is still out on the precise chronology of the seventh century. Many things you will learn about the Roman Empire from elsewhere as things with fairly clear datings, such as the creation of the Theme system, the replacement of Latin by Greek as the administrative language of the empire, and the start of the (eighth-century) phenomenon now known as Iconoclasm, simply cannot be dated with any precision. This gets even more confusing when we talk about the histories of the neighbours of the empire. I've talked a bit about the Arab historical traditions here, but it is always worth emphasising how later chronologies often contradict earlier sources. Again, these differences are not over relatively unimportant events, but over which year Muhammad died, when the Hijra began and the length of the first few caliphs' reigns. This extract from Chase Robinson's article on early Islamic historiography sums up the basic problems with the first issue, which should give you a decent idea of the general state of affairs right now:   Since these events can be securely dated to 634 or 635, his [Muhammad's] death in 632 is obviously thrown into some doubt. The earliest is a Greek text composed in about 634; thereupon follow a Hebrew source written between 635 and 645, a Syriac account from about 660, several more Syriac texts from the later seventh and eighth centuries, a Coptic account (translated from a now-lost original Arabic), one in Latin (written in 741), a piece of Samaritan Arabic and, finally, a document that is conventionally known as ʿUmar’s letter to Leo, which survives in eighth-century Armenian. It is a pretty good haul of evidence: Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Armenian, Latin, and Coptic sources, written by Christians and Jews of multiple confessions and orientations, who were composing in a wide variety of literary genres, for varying audiences, in Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Northern Mesopotamia and south-west Iran. [...] It seems to me that the burden of proof now lies with those who would defend 632.   Further challenges will no doubt come in the future as well, since even now I know of people working to disprove the existence of certain campaigns. To a certain extent these kind of problems also pop up elsewhere. In Francia, the Chronicle of pseudo-Fredegar stops around 642, even though he literally promised to write about events in the 650s as well. Without pseudo-Fredegar, historians of Francia largely have to rely on later chronicles and contemporary saints' lives, both of which pose problems. The former because they are often mistaken, the latter because they were written to fulfil a specific need rather than to achieve chronological precision. This problem can be overcome through hard work and some clever analysis, but imagine what writing a transnational history of this period would be like. I've noticed that some historians of Francia refer to Theophanes' Greek Chronicle to occasionally take into account eastern events and to confirm various stories found in western sources, but since Theophanes generally can't date things to save his life, I do wonder how redating certain things from one region would change our understanding of the other. To do so however you would have to be trained as a historian of the Roman Empire, of early Islam and of the West, to understand the pitfalls of church history, of hagiographies and of conventional political history, and perhaps most importantly, you would have to be aware of the very latest developments in each field, which is a daunting task even for a seasoned historian.    TL; DR - Writing about the seventh century is... difficult."

A hilarous example of this complete chronological jumbling is when he talks about Greek Fire for the first time, with the entry for AD 671 stating that:  ""Constantine, on being informed of so great an expedition of God's enemies against Constantinople, built large biremes bearing cauldrons of fire and dromones equipped with siphons, and ordered them to be stationed at the Proclianesian harbor of Caesarius.""  And then IMMEDIATELY in the next entry, for the next year AD 672:  ""At that time Kallinikos, an architect from Helioupolis in Syria, took refuge with the Romans and manufactured a naval fire with which he kindled the ships of the Arabs and burnt them with their crews.  In this way the Romans came back in victory and acquired the naval fire.""  Talk about not having an editor, a proofer, or a @#$%..."
AskHistorians,3dyddx,bitparity,5,Mon Jul 20 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"My boy Bede does it on purpose. A Frankish princess named Bertha got married to the King of Kent, and she brought a bishop with her. Her husband, King Æthelberht, was dissatisfied with the most important churchman in his realm being a Merovingian servant and a companion to his wife, so he asked the pope to send him his own bishop, Augustine of Canterbury.  Of course, Bede wanted his Ecclesiastical History to be a romance between Britain and Rome, so he talked about Æthelberht and Augustine first, then had a flashback to the bit about Bertha. And because of this, we traditionally date Christianity in Britain to Augustine's arrival in 597, even though reading the very next sentence in Bede shows this to be false."
AskHistorians,3dyddx,textandtrowel,7,Mon Jul 20 23:14:47 2015 UTC,"Within the field of the American Revolution the bigger historiographic debates have been over the causes and motivations of the Revolution. However, more recently there has been more debate over the time frame of the Revolution, and indeed the time frame of what we can call Early American History.\  The generally accepted chronology of the American Revolution is that it was a long series of protests and revolts (starting in 1765 with the Stamp Act) and lasting until violence broke out in 1775 and independence was declared in 1776. I do think that chronology is being re-examined with a new crop of historians.  For example there are some people who argue that the American Revolution lasted from the beginnings of the Stamp Act protests all the way through to the early Republic as power was concentrated in Washington.  Others argue for the Revolution extending from the Stamp Act protests through to the ratification of the Constitution in 1789.   Others will argue that the Revolution was from the Stamp Act protests to the end of the Revolutionary War (1783).  Others argue for a more limited Revolution and date it from the early 1770s through 1776 when the Declaration was ratified.   Personally I feel that the Revolution took place from 1773 to 1776, with the war being a separate event to hold on to the Revolution, and then a sort of Thermidorian counter-revolution against the early radicalism taking place after the war which resulted in the crack downs on the leaders of the so-called ""Shays Rebellion"", the Constitutional Convention, and then the crackdown on the so-called ""Whiskey Rebellion"" (a term coined by the opponents of the protests to belittle the protesters)."
AskHistorians,3dyddx,smileyman,3,Mon Jul 20 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"Are there any arguments for the Revolution beginning before the Stamp Act? Say, with the Proclamation of 1763? Or is the Stamp Act the farthest back any historian is willing to go?"
AskHistorians,3dyddx,Patpgh84,6,Mon Jul 20 19:32:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't really seen any people argue that the Revolution itself began before the Stamp Act crisis. There are some who will say that the roots of the problem began before the Stamp Act protests (such as your example of the Proclamation of 1763).  And to be clear, most of those who say that the Revolution began with the Stamp Act protests don't actually say that those protests were part of the full-fledged Revolution, but that they heralded the beginning of the process that led to full blown revolt.   Rather than discuss the revolts and protests of the Stamp Act crisis, and subsequent follow-ups such as the Boston Massacre in 1770 (and the New York riots of 1770) as part of it's own historiography, that whole process tends to get lumped in with the historiography of the Revolution.   Part of it is because the Stamp Act Crisis was the first large scale, colony-wide, organized resistance to British imperial policy. Part of it is because it makes a handy demarcation line before we end up talking about the Revolution beginning with the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth and stating that they had the authority to ""to enact, constitute, and frame, such just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions, and offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the colony"", something that no other civil organization in the British Empire dared to claim for itself."
AskHistorians,3dyddx,smileyman,5,Mon Jul 20 19:45:23 2015 UTC,"I'll suggest two further sub-questions.   What does 'circa' mean? Do journals have circa standards(c:19xx) or questionable dating (19xx?) standards? Should journal have these standards?   I couldn't find a standard for the meaning of a circa date beyond the fact that the date is approximately correct. Specifically is the date that is circa'd the midpoint of the range of possibilities, minimum value, median, best-guess.... Also, what is the range of values for this date 5 years either side, 10 years either side, 20 years either side?  While you can figure things out from the contextual material surrounding the chronology or by a study of source materials this is harder than I believe necessary. Often knowledge that isn't explicit becomes knowledge that is obscure. I believe some measure of variance, of the range needs to be transmitted along with the statement that we are unsure of a date.   Frequently you have two things (A,B) ocurring roughly at the same thing but without necessarily knowing that A preceded B or that B preceded A. Worse you may have different sources conveying different orderings, one saying A comes.before B, two others that B.comes before A. It seems that a linear chronology fails to capture this rich structure. But, then what? How should this be conveyed? How might it be conveyed?   Thank you to /u/commustar for the topic. I've been wrestling with the second question in a completely different area -- recording lab reports -- and it's a very prickly matter to which I havent found a good solution beyond some graph and topological tricks (see topotime)."
AskHistorians,3dyddx,neshalchanderman,4,Mon Jul 20 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"Often knowledge that isn't explicit becomes knowledge that is obscure.   That's a very quotable sentence. I might have to borrow it sometime ...  Circa is a Latin word that means 'about'. We can't assign it a precise range of values, since it depends upon context: we can usually date short or recent events more precisely than we can long or distant ones. Nor does the circa date necessarily refer to the midpoint, since sometimes we round to a more convenient number. It's hard to get a grasp on, even for veteran historians, when we enter a new subfield. For example, historians of early English texts often use circa to mean ±5 years, whereas archaeologists working on artifacts from the same period might mean ±20 years.  To show how this works in my own research, clues in the Anonymous Life of Saint Cuthbert show it was written 699-705. If my audience needs precision, I'll give them the range and discuss it. But if it's not important to my argument, I'll say it was written c.700. That's not the midpoint, but it looks cleaner and the round number suggests there's a ±5 year range. Plus it helps the reader keep Cuthbert before the Whitby Gregory (704-714), which I would date to c.710. Of course, if my argument depends upon Cuthbert predating Gregory, I'd have to discuss particular dates and the possibility that these texts were written in the inverse order. But if historians had to recite these issues every time they referenced these texts, they'd waste a lot of ink and even fewer people would read our work.  Context vs. Chronology. We rely on linear chronologies (time lines) to help organize our thoughts and to help newcomers understand what we're working on. That said, most scholarly work is actually about investigating the rich structures of context. For example, we know that Anglo-Saxon burial patterns and settlement patterns changed about the same time during the long eighth century (another way of saying circa!). But which came first? Did one cause the other? Or did they both share a common cause? What else changed with them? What changes did they in turn cause? How was the situation different from place to place? How effective are our generalizations at describing all these particular circumstances?  Obviously you could write a wealth of literature on these questions, and at the end of the day, you'd still have much disagreement and there'd be little consensus for putting together a linear chronology of events (hence the unsatisfying and ill-defined period of the long eigth century). Yet this is in many ways historians' most important work: asking questions about how human societies and relationships change and grow, and digging into the nitty-gritty of particulars."
AskHistorians,3dyddx,textandtrowel,3,Mon Jul 20 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"I believe some measure of variance, of the range needs to be transmitted along with the statement that we are unsure of a date.   I know that some authors will try to explicitly state an estimated date and include a ""margin of error"" expressed in years.  For example, in carbon dating of cattle domestication in the Nile Valley, dates can sometimes be expressed as ""3,650 y.a. +/- 75"" indicating that the best estimate based on the results of carbon dating would be 3,650 years before the Isotope baseline of 1950 AD. But, the sample could be as old as 3,725 years before, or as recent as 3,575 years before.  In other cases, an author might say ""circa"" and give a rough date, but not have much evidence to go on. For example, a historian might say ""Dyula merchants established trade contacts with the northern Akan peoples circa 950 AD.""  That estimate could be based on evidence like a find of a Kola nut found in Gao (outside of its growing habitat) around 950, or perhaps an author writes in 1000 AD of contact with southern peoples who seem to be the Akan that started ""two generations ago"". However, once archaeological fieldwork happens at a known Dyula/Juula settlement in Akan territory, we might soon find out that evidence of Dyula settlement began closer to 800 AD.   Sometimes, writers will give ""circa"" dates without really being able to provide an estimate for the ""margin of error"" involved."

You might be interested in asking the question in r/Judaism.  Basically the temple at Onias was not considered legitimate for proper sacrifice by mainstream Jewish sources. The temple in Jerusalem is considered the only legitimate temple (where sacrifices can be preformed) by mainstream Judaism. In the Talmud they look down upon the sacrifices at Onias, but are kind of okay with it as a synagogue. However, the Jews in Egypt viewed the sacrifices as legitimate. Jewish sources reconcile this by basically characterizing their illegitimate sacrifices as an expression of their desire to be able to sacrifice in Jerusalem.

The last one is a hypothesis because no one has conducted a residue analysis to prove such a thing happened, but it opens up the possibility that other claims for distilled beverages in pre-Columbian times may be true.  Among the Aztec pulque was perhaps the most commonly consumed alcoholic beverage since they had access to agave. It was only consumed in rare instances since public intoxication was forbidden unless you were elderly. Even so, if an elderly person was too intoxicated they would be punished.  The Classic Maya favored maize beer and fermented cacao beverages, partially because they had access to cacao and partially because they lacked agave. It was not uncommon for men to go to a men's house to receive a maize beer or tobacco enema in order to feel the effects more quickly.

How appropriate this was considered for mixed company has varied by culture and period.  Translated Sumerian temple chants/songs for public celebrations made no bones about being fertility songs, using lines for the Goddess like ""Who will plow my vulva?"" Look up ""lingam and yoni"" for the religious use of genitalia in India, or huge representations of silk over frames, lit up from inside, in traditional Japanese festivals.  But I'm pretty sure what you want is the Western European tradition here.  The songs were out there, but rarely written down. Most music was rarely recorded until the sheet music industry arose. We do have risqué medieval songs from sources like Carmina Burana (11th-13th C) or the Cambridge Songs from around 1066. A fine lady might have been insulted to hear it, but the Wife of Bath probably knew all the verses.  So you have a tension down the centuries of those who like their bawdy songs and those who want something less sexual. This is usually the middle class. The peasants think sex is what life is about, and often so does the court. Consider the license of the English Restoration, and how much Restoration comedy relies on sexual misbehavior for its plots.  There also came Wit and Mirth: Or Pills to Purge Melancholy (normally called Pills to Purge Melancholy), a large collection of songs edited by Thomas d'Urfey, published between 1698 and 1720, which in its final, six-volume edition held over 1,000 songs and poems. They can all be called bawdy or ribald. They also often are very similar to others in the collection, and you get used to the continual use of certain euphemisms, like ""the white of an egg ran down her leg"" which has the virtue of being pre-rhymed. This was not art song: it was the low stuff from the taverns.  What you have at the end of the 1700s is the start of the development of what would be called Victorianism as the wealthy middle class begins its rule. You might want to look into Ben Wilson's The Making of Victorian Values: Decency and Dissent in Britain: 1789-1837; 2007; Penguin press, NY.  The important thing to note about the indecency of the waltz (popular in England from c.1815)(more like 1800 in Paris, and coming from Germany) is that it was the first dance since the Renaissance galliard where the dancers embraced each other, and for the first time continuously through the dance. Before then, all upper and middle class dances (and oft the galliard) had partners just touching hands with extended arms, and often changing partners down a set, the way in square dancing partners will momentarily dance with their corner or opposite.

AskHistorians,3dyyuk,Starl1ght,7,Mon Jul 20 17:53:20 2015 UTC,"Initially, German troops in the east fought with the Bolsheviks periodically, defending the gains made by the German Empire at Brest-Litovsk. Once these gains were made forfeit, however, by the Armistice and de facto surrender of the Reich, the Germans were allowed to maintain their 8th Army in the former Ober Ost, to help stem the westward expansion of the Bolsheviks. They operated along with paramilitary Freikorps, such as the Iron Division, but once the Treaty of Versailles was signed, these forces were to be disbanded. A British Army mission led by General Hubert Gough was dispatched to the Baltic states, tasked with the mission of organizing resistance against the Bolsheviks, and disarming the German forces there (especially the Iron Division)."

Following Nicholas II's abdication from the throne and the creation of the Russian provisional government after the February revolution in 1917, Lenin was given passage through Germany by the Imperial government in Berlin to return to his home country. The Germans knew that Lenin and his Bolsheviks would cause problems (read: raise hell) in Russia, potentially aiding the Germans indirectly and possibly even ending the war in the East (which is exactly what happened).   Afterward, during the Russian Civil War, many German veterans (commanders and frontline soldiers alike) offered their services to the pro-White forces, and while their reasons varied greatly, many felt the establishment of a communist state nearby would further destabilize the already weary legitimacy of the new Weimar Republic, which was then dominated by the SPD (Social Democratic Party). Many other ethnic Germans that fought against the Bolsheviks were also Baltic Germans, who feared reprisals by the Bolsheviks once they established control over Russia."

AskHistorians,3dy7kt,aquafinaguzzler,16,Mon Jul 20 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"To deal with death, you have to distance yourself from the person who's dying- emotionally and physically. You can distance yourself emotionally and mentally in many ways, for example, through dehumanisation. If the executioner views the victim as, instead of a person, a demon, an animal to be put down, something sub human, then they will not feel the same psychological trauma as someone who does not dehumanise their victim. Historically, those who were hanged wore, often black, bags over their heads, to protect both the eyes of the audience from the aftermath of hanging- but also, the executioner. To stare into someone's eyes and then hang them would be much more emotionally damaging than to simply push a lever and see a faceless, nameless, emotionless 'thing' drop. Execution is often designed to remove the victim from humanity. Electric chairs would not require the person flipping the switch to be present, they would not see the person they killed. Hanging means an executioner will see the victim, but they will not see the victim as they are killing them and therefore it will be less easy to connect the last words, emotions and thoughts that the executioner may worry about, share or have heard or seen  to the dead body [1].  As I said, dehumanisation is key, both before and after death. In a society where thou shalt not kill was a key tenet of life, in Christian Medieval Europe at least, people still justified Crusades, frequent battles and wars, massacres and executions. To convince themselves that execution was the right thing to do, first the executioner had to convince themselves that the basic morals humans hold within them (eg, killing is bad) are removed from the person being executed, and that execution is the lesser of two evils [2].  The first point can be achieved through dehumanisation. Have you ever heard a psychopathic criminal described with words such as beast, animal, creature? It's commonplace. They are not human, they are sub human, below humans. They are not deserving of human rights, they are animals and therefore can be put down like a rabid dog. That is dehumanisation. Medieval executioners would look at a murderer and instead of seeing a human being who had committed a horrible act, they see an animal who had committed a horrible act. There is less emotional distress with the execution of an animal, it does not go against your religion or you deepest, innate morals and beliefs. If you would put down a dog which harried sheep, then it is not a stretch to put down a creature who kills humans- even if that creature is human in reality, they are not human in the executioner's mind.  Secondly- 'the lesser of two evils'.For those who cannot fully dehumanise them, or those who can dehumanise the victim and still believe execution is wrong, then they must see execution as good [3]. Dehumanisation doesn't mean that the executioner thinks executions are good, just that execution isn't morally wrong. Torture and execution would, in many people's minds, be justified- it removes criminals from the world, which could save innocent people's lives, torture provides necessary answers which could also save lives- surely one life sacrificed is better than sacrificing many? That's what executioners- and many modern people as well- believed and believe. It is morally justifiable because to not execute people, more deaths, suffering and crime will occur. An executioner could look upon themselves as someone doing a worthy job, a job for the benefit of society and humanity, by making it safer [4].  Gruesome methods would be even harder to deal with- and more distance would be required. If hanging, drawing and quartering someone prevents treason and therefore saves lives in the long run and, anyway, it's not like the person is human, they don't feel like you or me, it's all right, isn't it? That's how executioners justified execution in the Middle Ages, and, to some extent, how modern executioners justify execution now [5].  Sources: [1]When Death is on the Docket, the Moral Compass Wavers (New York Times).  [2] Moral Disengagement in the Execution Process (Osofsky, Bandura, Zimbardo).  [3]The Faithful Executioner: Life and Death in the Sixteenth Century (Joel Harrington).  [4]Executioner Identities: Towards Recognising the Right to Know Who is Hiding Behind the Hood (Ellyde Roko).  [5] Executioner's Current (Richard Moran).  Oh, and just in case this somehow comes across as me supporting execution, I am firmly and definitely against capital punishment!"

Surnames along with the whole complex Roman naming system disappeared in the early period and only started to reemerge in the 8th century.  But these could be family names, patronyms, or toponyms.  And due to Byzantine naming conventions (you'd typically name children after your parents), there were many common names like Constantine, John, Michael, Leo, etc. within the same family.  So the Byzantines needed some way to distinguish between all these similarly named people.  For personal relations and commoners, I covered it briefly here.  Within a local sphere, people would know you personally.

AskHistorians,3dypc6,CaptainPyjamaShark,7,Mon Jul 20 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"Law was a military veteran, having served six years in the (peacetime, segregated) US Army, and that experience certainly helped him come into his position (even if he never rose about PFC), but how talented a soldier he actually was is debatable. He performed well at Jarama, but he was only a ranker then, not in any form of command.  First the unassailable facts. According to Thomas, the IBs faced exceptionally heavy fighting at Brunete, specifically on July 9th while assaulting 'Mosquito Ridge', and those losses were the principal cause of the Abe Lincolns and George Washington Battalions to be subsequently merged. He makes no mention of Law being shot by his own men, only that he was one of those who fell during the fighting that day. Carroll states losses of about 50 percent.   As for who shot him, well... personal account vary, and given the politicization of the Abe Lincolns, it is hard to say who is speaking true. Law certainly had his detractors, especially from those who became disillusioned. As noted, Law distinguished himself at Jarama, and given the continual, heavy losses of the Brigade, this saw him advance rapidly, first to section leader and not even a month later to command of a machine-gun company. He soon found himself as commander of the Brigade himself, and the track record there is less clear. Martin Hourihan, a former commander for the Abe Lincolns then working with regimental staff, reported poor tactical deployment by Law, and also that he was unable to find the man at important times - of note, Hourihan would be killed at Brunete as well. Several other recollections at the time remember Law as ""an incompetent commander"", and that he was curled up on the ground in fear at times.  Others recall the opposite however. Harry Fischer, who wrote an acclaimed memoir of his experiences, says nothing of the sort. While charging to his death on Mosquito Hill, Law was, according to Fischer, leading his men bravely, pistol in hand, having noted that he wouldn't order his men to attack if couldn't in good conscience go with them. In a letter home written on the 29th, soon after Law's death, he recounted Law's bravery both prior to this action and during:   On July 6th, when we went over the last hill and charged under heavy machine-gun fire, Law was right up in the front, urging us on. When we were forced to drop, he was still up, looking around to see that we were all down. Then he dropped. How he missed being hit that day, I'll never understand.  On July 9th, we went over again. [...] Once again Law was up in front urging us on. [...] Law would not drop for cover. [...] ""Come on comrades, they are running,"" he shouted, ""Let's keep them running."" All this time he was under machine-gun fire. Finally he was hit.   His account, as well as others, is clear that Fischer was shot in the front by the Nationalists, and is supported also by the account of the Medic who treated him, David Smith. In his own memoir, Milton Wolff, the final commander of the Abe Lincolns, says little about Law, only to note that of his eight predecessors, Law's loss was ""the greatest"".  Perhaps one of the most forceful defenses comes from the memoirs of James Yates, who states ""Oliver was selected by me and others to command because he ws the best man for the job,"" but this can't be taken uncritically, as Yates was one of the several dozen black members of the Abe Lincolns, and quite clearly aligns his pride of Law with pride in the fact a black man was commanding mixed-race troops. At the same time, despite the calls for racial equality, we can't dismiss that some of his detractors were certainly driven by race as well, unhappy with a black man in command, although those who objected on these grounds, openly at least, were a distinct minority (Yates didn't witness his death, but was nearby and was told Law was killed in action).   Morris Maken, testifying to the Subversive Activities Control Board in the early '50s, laid into many of his former comrades, and decried what he saw as disturbing Communist subversion in the unit. As regards Law, he thought little of him and considered the promotion to command to be quite wrong.  As related by Carroll, the main source of this portrayal of Law is from William Herrick, a veteran who wrote several fictionalized accounts, drawing on his experience. He wrote of Law as a ""coward and a drunkard"" and also related him as being killed by his own men, and in interviews, state that this was true, which was vociferously contested by other veterans. Herrick claimed that they were attempting to protect the mythologized concept of the Abe Lincolns, while he was being true to what actually happened. But, Herrick wasn't there. He only heard things second hand, despite his insistences. And while he claims that he was told this by the men who actually shot him (and allegedly pissed on the corpse), the two who survived the war state that they did no such thing - although that might be expected.  So the answer is... unclear. The most damning account and the main source of the story that he was shot by his own men comes from a second-hand account disavowed by the supposed sources, and is contradicted by men who were there. Charges that he was incompetent are more reliable, but even then, face opposition. The debates surrounding the Abe Lincolns are very politicized, so take it all for what you will. My own take, having read several sources on the matter, is that he probably wasn't a very good commander, but he was generally a brave soldier. The former can often override the latter in recollections, and if I had to cast my vote, I'd go with him not being killed by his own men - even if some may have wanted to frag him.  Sources:  Peter Carroll - ""Odyssey of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade"" - Probably the most comprehensive book on the subject (although also thoroughly biased to the point of sometimes being hagiographic)  Hugh Thomas - The Spanish Civil War  Harry Fischer - Comrades  Edit to add notes from:  James Yates - Mississippi to Madrid  Milton Wolff - Another Hill  Madrid 1937 - Ed. by Cary Nelson  I will, however, ping /u/tobbinator, /u/domini_canes, and /u/k1990 as they might have other sources that weigh in here too."

Not everyone was taken completely by surprise with the atomic bomb.  In a speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in February 1943 Pope Pius XII addressed the possibility of an atomic bomb.  (source in Italian)   di maniera che il pensiero della costruzione di una macchina di uranio non può essere stimato come una mera utopia. Soprattutto però sarebbe importante che non si lasciasse effettuare tale processo a modo di esplosione, ma che se ne frenasse il corso con adatti e vigili mezzi chimici. Altrimenti ne potrebbe seguire non solo nel luogo stesso, ma anche per l'intiero nostro pianeta, una pericolosa catastrofe.  (emphasis added for clarity)   Here is a translation   The thought of the construction of a uranium machine cannot be regarded as merely utopian.  It is important, above all, however, to prevent this reaction from taking place as an explosion ... Otherwise, a dangerous catastrophe might occur.   After the atomic bombing, the Vatican did issue a statement via the Osservatore Romano opposing the bombing, which was consistent with its ongoing condemnation of aerial bombardment of civilians (dating back to WWI, and continued from the very beginning of Pius XII's pontificate).    So Pope Pius XII was aware of the possibility of atomic bombs.  I don't know if he would fit OP's criteria of being part of the ""general public"" though."
AskHistorians,3dyv2y,Domini_canes,7,Mon Jul 20 19:13:41 2015 UTC,"No — the theoretical possibility of an atomic bomb was known within scientific circles, but wasn't widely understood by the public at large.  In August 1939, Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd wrote (privately) to President Roosevelt, alerting him to recent developments in the field of atomic research in Germany and warning of the destructive power of an atomic bomb:   This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable — though much less certain — that extremely powerful bombs of this type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory.   Subsequently, both the British and American governments established committees (the S-1 Uranium Committee in the US and the MAUD Committee in the UK) to explore the feasability of developing atomic weapons. The work of those committees — both operating under military auspices — was kept secret.  Prior to August 1945, the existence of functional atomic weapons and the intensive effort that went into developing them were jealously-guarded military secrets. The Manhattan Project and comparable nuclear research projects outside the US (Tube Alloys in the UK; the German Uranverein and Laboratory No. 2 in the USSR) were shrouded in secrecy — not least because they were fiercely-contested targets for espionage.  The existence of atomic weapons only became public knowledge on 6 August 1945, when President Truman released a statement announced the bombing of Hiroshima to the world:   Sixteen hours ago an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima and destroyed its usefulness to the enemy. That bomb had more power than 20,000 tons of TNT. It had more than two thousand times the blast power of the British ""Grand Slam"" which is the largest bomb ever yet used in the history of warfare.  [...] With this bomb we have now added a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the growing power of our armed forces. In their present form these bombs are now in production and even more powerful forms are in development.  It is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.

AskHistorians,3dyv2y,restricteddata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"Subsequently, both the British and American governments established committees (the S-1 Uranium Committee in the US and the MAUD Committee in the UK) to explore the feasability of developing atomic weapons. The work of those committees — both operating under military auspices — was kept secret.   Just to be pedantic (for what else are we here for?), I would not quite say that the Einstein letter led to S-1. The Einstein letter led to the Uranium Committee, which did not accomplish much. The MAUD Committee was not a result of the Einstein letter, but a result of the Frisch-Peirels memorandum (somewhat of an analogous document in the UK). The MAUD Committee wrote the MAUD Report which, through a rather non-direct route, ended up getting in the hands of scientists in the US who used it as an excuse to take over the Uranium Committee, turn it into the S-1 Committee, and use that to eventually launch what becomes the Manhattan Project.   In other words, the Einstein letter was something of a non-starter, though it often gets a lot of credit, in part because the people who made the bomb liked to point to Einstein as their origin point, because who would contradict Einstein?"

Regardless, Heisenberg was among them and the transcripts show how suprised he was.   I bring this up because you mention how Germany had their own program. While they did, Hitler and other higher ups thought of it all as Jewish Physics, their programs were severely underfunded. Heisenberg's own plan for splitting the atom was also incorrect and he believed it would have taken 100's of thousands of people working non stop to achieve what the US had supposedly detonated over Japan.

They knew it was different, usually a bomb bay had a ton of bombs not just one big one, and from what I can tell they knew it was an ""atomic"" bomb. But they didn't really know what that meant.  Apparently the flight log for the bombing mission was pretty unusual, it goes from the usual descriptions of clouds, weather, and turbulence, to an entry that said something like, There will be a brief pause as we make our bombing run. Then the next entry was ""My god, what have we done?""

If you include readers of the American fiction magazine Astounding Science Fiction, then yes, they were aware of the possibility.   A little over a year before (in the March 1944) issue, Astounding published a story called Deadline which described the building and detonation of an atomic bomb powered by isotope separated U235.   The information was based on publically available technical journals up to 1943 and the editor's background in physics."
AskHistorians,3dyv2y,PinkGayWhale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:54:31 2015 UTC,"The concept of an ""atomic bomb"" had been a science fiction staple since 1914. It was based on the idea that there was tremendous amounts of energy locked up in the atomic nucleus, if only it could be released. By the early 1930s it had become a cliché idea, that a thimbleful of water could power a steamship across the ocean, etc. Much of this discussion was a result of the popularization of nuclear research and the science of radioactivity by scientists like Frederick Soddy and novelists like H.G. Wells. Even a younger Winston Churchill gave a speech referencing atomic bombs in 1925:    Might a bomb no bigger than an orange be found to possess a secret power to destroy a whole block of buildings — nay to concentrate the force of a thousand tons of cordite and blast a township at a stroke?    The problem was that until the discovery of nuclear fission there was no physical mechanism for releasing that energy on a large scale. It is one thing to say that the energy in the atomic nucleus, it is another to be able to release it. (To put it into a modern context, we all know that anti-matter/matter reactions release immense amounts of energy. But this is not helpful to us, since we have no way of easily producing anti-matter. So talk of an anti-matter bomb today is as fanciful as talk of an atomic bomb was in the 1920s.)  Nuclear fission was discovered in the winter of 1938, and announced in early 1939. The science writers powered up their cliché engines once again and started talking about bombs and thimblefuls of water and what have you. Some actual scientists got worried (Leo Szilard being one of the first, a fact he attributed to his reading of H.G. Wells), but a lot of them (including some very brilliant and later important ones, like Enrico Fermi) dismissed it as a short term problem, in part because of the long history of overhype.  But there is a big gap between ""discovered in a lab"" and ""realized as a weapon."" Aside from the people working on the Allied Manhattan Project, the general consensus among scientists was that this would be maybe an issue for the next war, because turning a discovery into a technology takes several years, if not a decade.   So when the atomic bomb did occur, there was already a lot of cultural ""priming"" to understand it — the term ""atomic bomb"" was not a new creation. But it was surprising that it was achieved when it was.  The analogy I like to use is that of a ""warp drive."" Almost everyone has heard of such a thing. Geeky sorts know that there are some hypothetical, real-life ways of potentially accomplishing it, but nobody thinks one is right around the corner. Now imagine that the government announced tomorrow that they had achieved a warp drive and used it to go around the solar system three times. You'd be shocked — and you might be curious as to how the hell they did it — but it would not be the first time anyone had heard of the general concept."
AskHistorians,3dx8d1,JohnFriedly91,27,Mon Jul 20 07:51:18 2015 UTC,"Augustus was the first Roman emperor. The major difference between Julius Caesar and Augustus is that Caesar held his power within the framework of the Republic. Every one of the positions Caesar held - even the one of dictator with no time limit - was held by someone else before him.   Unlike Sulla (the previous dictator with no time limit) though Caesar showed no signs of stepping down after his work was done. Some senators thought Caesar was acquiring too much power and murdered him. This sparked a series of civil wars which in the end were won by Octavian, Caesars heir. During this time Octavian held several positions, also within the framework of the Roman Republic.  In 27 BC Octavian laid down all his official functions in the Roman Republic, giving power back to the senate and people of Rome. For ""restoring the Republic"" after decades of civil war, the Senate granted Octavian the titles Augustus (""Illustrous One"") and Princeps (""First""). The Senate also decided to give Augustus the governorship of Spain, Gallia, and Syria (this was likely orchestrated). These provinces just happened to be the ones where many legions were stationed, so with this single governorship Octavian had control over the majority of Rome's legions. Octavian also got tribunal powers, without being a tribune (or even being eligible for the tribunate).  It is the unique concentration of various formal and informal powers which is the defining feature of Roman emperors. For a couple of centuries at least, the charade of the emperor simply being someone helping the Senate and ""Republic"" was kept up. Augustus was the one to implement this system, and he was the first one to hold these powers and titles. Augustus' titles - Imperator, Augustus, Princeps - and family name - Caesar - would become the titles and name used by nearly every emperor.    I don't believe there's any real debate about what I said above. Some people might argue that Caesar already made some moves towards the changes instituted by Octavian, and there probably is a case to be made there, but overall it is accepted that the Republic ends with the civil wars after Caesar's death and thus that Caesar was not an emperor.   If you have a look at the Companion to the Roman Army (edited by Paul Erdkamp, published by Blackwell, 2007) it is divided into sections. Part II ""Mid and Late Republic"" covers Caesar and has events up to and including the civil wars. Part III is even more explicit; it is called ""The Empire (Actium to Adrianople)"". ""Actium"" refers to the battle of Actium, which ended the civil wars. The very first article in that section is on the Augustan reforms of the army. Same goes for the book A Short History of Roman Law (Olga Tellegen-Couperus, Routledge, 1993). There part II is literally ""The Late Republic (367-27BC)"" and part III ""The Principate (27BC-284)"".  Another book, The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic (edited by Harriet Flower), includes a chapter on the 'crisis of the Republic' and Caesars actions. Same goes for the chapter ""Military Organization and social change in the later Roman Republic"" by John Patterson in the book War and Society in the Roman World (edited by John Rich and Graham Shipley, published by Routledge, 1993). That too includes Caesar. The book The Roman Empire; Economy, Society and Culture by Peter Garnsey and Richard Saller (Univ. of California Press, 1987) starts with Augustus.   I think you get my point by now. It is completely uncontroversial in the academic world that Caesar lived and operated under the Roman Republic and that the Roman Empire started while Octavian/Augustus was in power."

AskHistorians,3dx8d1,shlin28,7,Mon Jul 20 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"To a certain extent, the Byzantine Empire directly preserved aspects of the Republican tradition! Anthony Kaldellis' new book, The Byzantine Republic: People and Power in New Rome (2015), for instance argued that the empire was a monarchical republic until its destruction in 1453. Kaldellis probably pushed his thesis too far, but it is absolutely true that the people in Constantinople played a major role in imperial politics throughout the empire's history. Public support was essential for emperors to maintain their hold on power and in order to even become an emperor, they have to be acclaimed by the people of the capital. A 'republic' is a very modern term anyway, since for the Romans 'republican' referred instead ""to underlying ideologies of power and notions of popular sovereignty; it does not have to do with the structure of offices"" (quoting Kaldellis here). More generally speaking, the Byzantines were literally the Romans, so it is correct to see republican/imperial traditions as being parts of Byzantine history as well."

AskHistorians,3dx8d1,shlin28,3,Mon Jul 20 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure about that, especially as I don't know how the idea of having a co-emperor started. For the ones I know about (c.500-700), co-emperors were often elevated because the senior emperor wanted to stabilise his heir's position, but there were also plenty of emperors who did not raise their heirs to imperial dignity but were instead happy to let them fight it out after their deaths. It is I think a big mistake to impose 'rules' on the complicated world of Roman/Byzantine politics, which is actually one of the flaws with Kaldellis' book. We should definitely take into account the role of the people in the history of the empire, but that did not mean that their role was firmly fixed nor that the sovereignty always meant the same thing to everyone."

AskHistorians,3dx8d1,Bhangbhangduc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"What's revisionist about it? I'm kind of fascinated by the late Roman empire in general, so what would you recommend as a background good reading list?"
AskHistorians,3dx8d1,shlin28,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:17 2015 UTC,"Well, mostly because he argued for this whole monarchical republic thing. The 'conventional' view as summarised by Kaldellis is this:   According to a recent book, “it has also been common to regard  Byzantine culture as based on two elements: the Greek . . . and the Judaic and Christian tradition.” The other option is to regard the Roman aspect as a function of imperial propaganda, limited to titles and diplomacy. It survives in the view that the Byzantines were Roman insofar as they were the subjects of the emperor, as if they derived their Roman identity, such as it was, from his title (the exact opposite was in fact true).   Kaldellis on the other other hand decided to argue full-heartedly for Roman traditions being very influential even in the late Byzantine empire, when 'republican' ideals have generally be seen as having faded away much earlier, perhaps by the time of the Dominate in the third century. I have my own reservations about this book, mostly because I think it generalised too much, but I have no problem recommend it, mostly because it's a pretty fun read (at least in terms of academic monographs).  As for the history of the late Roman empire, Stephen Mitchell's A History of the Later Roman Empire, AD 284-641: The Transformation of the Ancient World (2006) will give you a decent introduction to the narrative. Peter Sarris' Empires of Faith: The Fall of Rome to the Rise of Islam, 500-700 (2011) is also excellent for a slightly later period. Otherwise, it depends on your personal interests, but Peter Brown's The World of Late Antiquity (1971) and The Rise of Western Christendom (2003) are I think respectively the two best introductions to the cultural and religious history of this period."

Once the war ended, political pressure to bring as many of the troops home as possible became very intense.  Demobilization priority was determined with a complicated point system (i.e. time in service, any medals won and all kinds of stuff earned points and whoever had more points got the first ship home).  Aside from homesickness, troops clamored to get home because it was believed that the sooner you were stateside the better your job prospects would be as the economy reverted to civilian production.  As you can imagine, political lobbying about getting home quickly became very intense.  People wrote their congressmen, soldiers held protests, and the Senate forced Eisenhower to testify about the process.  The tumultuous process was widely perceived as impairing occupation policy in both Germany and Japan.  Groups without much political clout, like African American servicemen, generally got worse treatment for demobilization.  The logistical effort to bring troops back to the US was huge and very prolonged.  The last official demobilization transports didn't reach the states until April 1946, almost 8 months after the end of the war.

AskHistorians,3dwkbi,BruhMan_,34,Mon Jul 20 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"Gnosticm isn't a single belief or religion. So it is hard to pin down how it differs from Christianity. Indeed there are even forms of Gnostic Christianity.  It was a general movement in the Mediterranean Basin in the first few centuries CE. The basic point of a gnostic belief, was that there was some special form of knowledge that could provide something for the learner. Gnostic itself is derived from the Greek word for learned or knowledge. So a gnostic was simply someone who claimed to have some sort of knowledge. Exactly what this knowledge was or what it was supposed to do for the learner varied wildly from group to group. For the most part Gnostics believed that their special knowledge would somehow grant them access to special treatment in the afterlife. And usually this knowledge was shared by one deity or another. Most of the Mystery Cults of the early CE era could and sometimes were called gnostic.  And Christianity included gnostic subgroups within it. These were almost religions within a religion where certain individuals would be initiated into he ""true meaning"" of Christianity. But even within Christianity there were dozens of different sects of Gnostics, all claiming secret knowledge.  Let me give you one example; this should demonstrate the kinds of things that some Gnostics may have believed... but it shouldn't be taken as representative of all gnostic Christian belief, let alone gnostic belief in general, because there is no general gnostic belief.  In this mythology God was complete and whole within himself. But for some reason he divided himself into some of his attributes and gave them a separate existence. He still existed as himself whole and unchanged. But he also now existed as these separate beings as well. In some forms of the story he creates only a few, a dozen, or  even up to 300 of these beings. One of these beings was Sophia (Wisdom). And for whatever reason (it differs from version to version) Sophia created an additional being known as the Demiurge.  Now the Demiurge didn't share in Sophia's wisdom. She couldn't impart any of herself. And she also couldn't duplicate any of God's other attributes.  But she could emulate them. So the Demiurge got similar characteristics to God, but they were imperfect. Being an imperfect being the Demiurge couldn't perceive God or his attributes (even his own mother). And so he thought he was alone in the universe. To ease his loneliness he created the physical world. Unknown to him the only source of ""material"" to work with was God. So the Demiurge was taking parts of God and separating them from the whole. With this divine essence he created Earth and Adam and Eve. The Demiurge you see was Yahweh, the god of the Old Testament.  The original God saw this and was sad because parts of himself were now separate consciousnesses; something he approved of. But they were separated from him and ultimately from enlightenment and perfection; which he disapproved of. So he incarnated himself into the material world, as Jesus. When he died and returned to himself he forged a path that would allow all of humanity to follow and reunite with him. He also imparted the secret knowledge of how to follow this path he created to some disciples who then provide this secret knowledge to the rest of humanity.  In some versions ultimately everyone will follow the path back, but by learning and accepting sooner we reduce our suffering. In these versions there is some sort of reincarnation. And the ultimate fate is that the Demiurge will be saved and restored to God as well. In other forms the Demiurge is damned for his actions as are any who don't follow the secret path back to God and his attributes. They ultimately would be destroyed or simply permanently separated from God.  Depending on the details of the belief it could affect behavior. Some Christian gnostic communities encouraged celibacy, believing that by having kids you were stealing some of the original God's essence and adding to the suffering of the world. Others encouraged large families believing that the essence was a set amount stolen in the beginning and by having children in a gnostic family exposed souls to the proper knowledge faster.  Regardless of the details of the specific beliefs of the gnostic groups, other early Christians viewed them as heretics of the most dangerous kind. They denied the saving power of Christ's atonement, placing salvation in secret teachings. So they were firmly opposed."

""Gnosticism,"" speaking rather generally, is a reference to either (a) the ideas of a group of syncretic religions focused on gnōsis in the second through fourth centuries CE or (b) the tendency of religious intellectuals to seek personal knowledge of, and acquaintance with, the divine; this second definition doesn't take a period of time into account and is used more generally (see Pagels, The Gnostic Gospels for that interpretation). In most cases, the endgame of ""gnosticism"" is personal knowledge of the divine--the real God (Father, True God, etc.), not the false creator God (Demiurge, Ialdabaoth, Sakla, Samael). N.B. here: Layton (who's back-referenced in a lot of the literature) and Pagels disagree here somewhat, as Layton notes that the justification for speaking of a psychological or philosophical pattern called “gnosticism” has never actually been made up to standards; he suggests beginning with the “first coherent sect that called itself ‘gnostic,’ then [tracing] its historical and ideological evolution into a later form."" (The Gnostic Scriptures)  “Gnostics” versus “gnosticism” is a distinction that a scholar should make both semantically and historically; “gnosticism” as a catchall, Meyer argues in The Nag Hammadi Scriptures, shouldn’t actually be used at all with respect to the religious movement of the second century AD. Unlike the other terms used in the context of studying the movement (gnōstikos, gnōstikoi, and gnōsis), “gnosticism” isn’t directly Anglicized from the Greek, and it also wasn’t used self-referentially by these sects; it wasn’t popularized until the seventeenth century, long after the movement had effectively died out. We then replace it with references to separate schools of “gnosticism,” which were briefly touched on by /u/Quickspore—“Sethians,” “Thomas Christianity,” “Valentinian Chrisianity,” “Hermetics.” Pagels argues that these terms are applied to the gnostic writings out of a need for expedient categories; she’s not entirely wrong, but drawing lines make it much easier for scholars to slog through the references and subversion contained in the texts themselves.  Back to that argument Meyer makes: It hinges on the transferral of the term gnōsis from Greek to English, and the use of its derivatives by the “knowers” themselves. In koine Greek, gnōsis is a noun that just means “recognition,” “knowledge,” or “acquaintance;” it’s derived from the Greek verb gignōskein (“to come to know,” “recognize,” or “perceive). That’s interesting in and of itself; there are two types of knowledge, basically speaking, in the Greek. Verbs like eidenai describe what’s termed by Layton “propositional knowledge,” the knowledge that something is the case (“I know that Athens is in Greece”); the other type of knowledge is personal acquaintance, which is what is meant by gignōskein (“I know Athens well”).   The use of the terms gnōstikos and gnōstikoi (singular/plural, respectively) as descriptors of a group of people, the “gnostics,” is weird, too; it’s the expansion of a technical noun, which expresses a quality of facilitating personal acquaintance, to encompass a certain subset of people; the closest English equivalent, rather than “knowers,” is something like “acquainters” or “recognizers.” It’s as weird in Greek as it is in English. Here’s Layton on the philology of this bit:   As a mere word, the Greek term gnōstikos goes back as far as the time of Plato. It was a rare technical word with philosophical overtones; it means something like “leading to knowledge” or “capable of attaining knowledge.” In normal usage the terms was never applied to human beings; that is to say, normally a person would not be called “gnostic.” Rather, the word “gnostic” regularly referred to disciplines of study, human faculties, capacities, and the like. Thus, for example, the Platonist philosopher Plutarch could write, “Human souls have a faculty that is gnōstikos (leads to knowledge) of visible things.”  So when a social group in the early second century A.D. began to call itself gnōstikoi, or “gnostics,” this usage would have sounded like odd sectarian jargon—as though a modern club began to call itself the Perceptives or the Epistemologicals.   Jonas and Pétrement give more sectarian definitions of gnōsis; Petrement compares it to the average Christian’s “faith,” and notes that it wasn’t until the big heresiology binge of the second century and onward that the distinction between pistis (“faith”) and gnōsis was made. Jonas, furthermore, explains gnōsis as “the means for the attainment of salvation, or even as the form of salvation itself;” possession of this knowledge (or how to get it) is a fairly standard trope of gnostic lit.   Gnostic Christians, loosely, are a group of syncretic sects (syncretism, as defined by Vallée: “the amalgamation of disparate religious doctrines and practices”) who subverted the Old Testament; beyond this, /u/Quickspore was right, it’s not a single belief or religion. There are different qualifying criteria for different scholars, and I’m happy to elaborate on that in a followup if you’re interested. Syncretism, as well, is not specifically “gnostic;” Manichaeism (which is like Dualism 2.0) and mystery religions were also syncretic, and do exhibit overlap with what’s considered “gnostic” doctrine. The “gnostic” writings themselves are a hell-mashup of OT commentary, New Testament lore (or its basic form), astrology, arithmancy, Oriental mysticism, Hellenistic philosophy, and religious dualism.   As to where it came from and how it fits into early Christianity as a whole, that’s another disputed point; for each eminent gnostic scholar, there’s a different chart of origins and ideological succession of gnostic schools. The best model I’ve found for its context within Christianity, though, is to think of orthodoxy as a via negativa; that is to say, “we don’t know exactly what we believe, besides Jesus and Paul, but this isn’t it (points to Sethians) and this isn’t it (points to Valentinus) and this isn’t it either (points to Thomas).""  One thing I do have to nitpick in the top comment, though, is this statement:   They denied the saving power of Christ's atonement, placing salvation in secret teachings. So they [Christians] were firmly opposed.   That's only partially true; while it's the view commonly taken by heresiologists (church fathers who wrote treatises against heresy in defense of proto-orthodoxy/orthodoxy), it's not actually a belief held across the board as far as the sects themselves. Thomas Christianity and Valentinian Christianity in particular hold Christ as a salvific figure, and Valentinus himself was a devout Christian (he was once in the running to be bishop of Rome). The beef with the gnostics came about not only because of the restriction of the salvific message (and its arbitrary nature) to a chosen group of ""knowers,"" but also from the rejection of the church's set hierarchy and power structure, and said church's transmission of knowledge through a succession of legit bishops.   Edit: ""To"" --> ""the"" typo."

AskHistorians,3dwwt1,JFM2796,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:21:03 2015 UTC,Thank you!
AskHistorians,3duwyp,RoblerLobler,89,Sun Jul 19 18:41:22 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  There was a definite belief that gods and men mingled in the past Age of Heroes. And that gods stopped interacting directly with men roughly with the generation after the Trojan War. (So, for example, Athena interacted with Odyssey's son Telamachus but not with his great-grandsons or after.) This is reflected in Hesiod, who considers the age of heroes to be a separate race of demi-gods. So, by the time of every source we have there is a definite knowledge that Zeus wasn't out there getting girls pregnant anymore. Athena wasn't going to challenge you to a weaving contest anytime soon. And so on. (My personal theory is that the gods realized that they screwed up so badly by taking sides in the Trojan War that they decided to mostly stay out of things after settling the wreckage with the next generation. But that isn't sourced.)   However, yes, the gods made news all of the time. Really, in many ways the gods were personifications of nature or human emotion or pretty much everything. Once you get to the third generation of gods, Zeus and co., they have big personalities and the Greeks go nuts with their imagination. But earlier versions were pretty literal in their personification. Think of Gaia who wasn't just an early goddess she was literally the earth. Pontus was the ocean. Zeus and others divided up control of these areas that are already filled with (and actually are) gods. So, Poseidon controlled the ocean. There were nymphs and gods for nearly every river and stream. They personified those things in many ways.   When there was a a horrible storm at sea or a disaster on land that was the gods. Quite literally. It isn't like Christianity where God made the earth and the ocean and all of that. Zeus comes late in the game. He takes control of the preexisting cosmos and the cosmos are made up of gods. They are everywhere. They are always news, in a sense. It wasn't just a bunch of wacky gods. It was a completely different outlook on life."
AskHistorians,3duwyp,LieBaron,19,Sun Jul 19 21:47:37 2015 UTC,And that gods stopped interacting directly with men roughly with the generation after the Trojan War.   Was there a reason for this?
AskHistorians,3duwyp,chicagofirefifa3,46,Sun Jul 19 22:59:12 2015 UTC,"Hesiod said that there were five ages of man (the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Heroic Age, and the Iron Age).  He basically suggests that it is because the Age of Heroes and demigods died out. These would be the men who fought in the Trojan war. And he, and we, was alive during the Iron Age (not to be confused with the actual Iron Age) where men are cruel, selfish and petty. And eventually the gods will forsake them/us all together. Essentially, humanity was no longer deserving of the gods' individual attention.   Hesiod was not a cheerful guy. However, his work isn't the be all and end all of Greek theology and it's unknown how accepted that idea is. When Ovid reworked a lot of Hesiod he completely left out the idea that the Heroic Age was a race of men separate from the current race. That could just reflect the general attitude of his time (which was Roman but they are essentially sharing a cosmos at this point). Don't forget that there is no Greek bible. THere isn't just one accepted way of thinking about things. And we have lost so much. We put a lot of weight on Hesiod because he remains. (Everyone always put a lot of weight on Homer so that is valid.)   I think some light is cast by The Eumenides by Aeschylus. In it Orestes is on trial for killing his mother (who killed his father). There is a tied jury and Athena votes for clemency (and declares all tied juries will lead to clemency from then on). This is the generation after the Trojan war. I think you can argue that there is a general view there that men are now taking capable of governing themselves day to day. They have their own tools of justice, their own government, their own ability to handle affairs of state. And there is no longer a need for the gods to intervene. This goes well with the culture of Athens who felt pretty damn good about themselves, unlike Hesiod's world view. Although, the problem with that is it isn't as though the gods ever intervened solely to hep men. They did it for their own petty, selfish, or amorous reasons.   As I said, my personal theory is the gods saw how badly their taking sides ended in the Trojan War and decided to step away. Personally, I think there are things in the Iliad, Odyssey, and much later the Aeneid to go with this. Hera tells Zeus that he has no choice but to let one of his sons die during the war as that is his fate. Although, it pains him he does so (it's interesting because Zeus is limited by fate to a degree the Greek gods are part of the universe he doesn't make the rules like an almighty God of Abraham). In the Aeneid, Zeus tells Hera, who is angry for the slight against Dido, she has to step back and allow the Trojans to establish a city in Italy, as it is their fate to establish a great power there. Although it angers her and she still throws some wrenches in the plan, she does so. In the Odyssey you see the great divide between Athena and Odysseus when he asks why she didn't help him sooner and she replies that she couldn't with Poseidon in the way and really what is ten years anyway?  Of course, it is everything to him, a mortal. (There are other examples such as Aphrodite having to see mortals she cared for slain.) All and all it makes sense that the gods would no longer want to get so attached to these mortal beings who die so easily and quickly (to them). And cause all sorts of unnecessary heartache and strife among the gods. But that isn't fact. Just a theory.   And, like I said, it isn't as though the gods just took off. They still interacted in intimate ways since they were responsible for all acts of nature. (Again, Gaia, the earth itself, was a goddess. Just think about how different that worldview is.) They just weren't ever going to stop by for dinner or seduce your daughter ever again."

The genocide of Natives in South America by the Iberians is another example of an arguably successful genocide, because they were able to enslave and murder, while at the same time plundering anything of value. However, both of these examples are  full scale total genocide, which is more of a modern phenomenon. Also, state sponsored genocide, the type that you're thinking of is a modern phenomenon as well.

While the holocaust did not succeed in completely destroying Judaism and the Jews who's to say that the trauma did not change Judaism into something unrecognizable? To put this into context Jews has been living in Poland, Germany Russia and the rest of eastern Europe for centuries. They had their own language, Yiddish, own style of music, Klezmer, and a very particular way of life. All of that was destroyed, and for the most part vanished without trace after the holocaust, hundreds of years of a culture gone. Further, the response of Judaism to this catastrophe caused it to change form in many ways. The Jews gathered together into a state in 1948, something that had not happened since the destruction of the Temple by Titus in 70. Hebrew was revived, which had not been a spoken language for thousands of years and so on. Now i know that this is something of a devils advocate response, but consider the impact that a genocide has on the mindset of a people, it might do a  very good job of destroying their way of life and what made them distinctive."

AskHistorians,3dzf3r,82364,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I understand the question. The slaves were obtained through trade, and because it was economically beneficial to do so. American colonies were populated largely at first with white indentured laborers from England and its near colonies Scotland and Ireland. If they survived their period of indenture (often seven years), they were free men and often also given land. Some planters in Virginia started importing black slaves relatively early on. I believe at first they were imported from Caribbean sugar colonies, though I could be misremembering, as the sugar colonies had very high mortality rates from overwork and disease (and runaways in the case of Jamaica). Eventually a sophisticated trade network connecting the lumber and agricultural producers (and rum distillers) of the future U.S. Eastern Seaboard, the sugar islands, and the western coast of Africa developed. Slaves were exported from Africa in exchange for rum and other manufactured goods, while the Eastern Seaboard British colonies imported slaves and exported rum (refined from sugar byproducts imported from the West Indies), tobacco, and staple foodstuffs (mostly for the sugar islands, which preferred to devote their arable land to sugar production, rather than food).  You might be interested to read Edmund Morgan's American Slavery, American Freedom, which is one well-regarded analysis of the beginnings of race-based slavery in the Virginia Colony (iirc, he also addresses Maryland and North Carolina, since those colonies were more-or-less the same as Virginia, though less-populated and less-developed).  http://books.wwnorton.com/books/American-Slavery-American-Freedom/"
AskHistorians,3dxlh4,ParaDaniel,14,Mon Jul 20 11:03:30 2015 UTC,"First off, there's no possible way that Japan could have invaded the mainland US or even Hawaii. The planned Midway invasion would probably realistically have been beyond the reach of the Japanese fleet train to sustain anything but a shoestring garrison, and in any case Midway was meant to draw the American fleet out to force it into a decisive battle, only secondarily to occupy territory.   That last point gets to the meat of your question. Japan was quite aware that a long war against the U.S. was not winnable. Their war aims were to secure the resources of Southeast Asia (in particular oil, but also rubber and other industrial supplies). They couldn't do that with a U.S. presence in the Philippines. So their overall war plan, which saw successive revisions throughout the decades before 1941, was to quickly defeat colonial powers in Southeast Asia, and to build a defensive perimeter that the U.S. fleet would be attrited by before a final annihilating battle, after which the U.S. would sue for peace. The idea was that the American fleet, steaming west, would have to face Japanese air power and submarine attacks before making it to the vicinity of the Philippines or the home islands, where it would be decisively beaten.   To that end, the Japanese fleet's composition emphasized quality over quantity; they trained very elite naval aviators, for example, but very few of them. They also emphasized night fighting, the use of torpedoes, and an offensive spirit that was reckless and dashing, all to overcome numerical weakness that was inevitable given the two countries' industrial bases. At the start of the war, the Japanese arguably had the finest air fleet in the world, absolutely had the largest battleships, and had unparalleled torpedo technology.   In the immediate run-up to WWII, the Japanese naval leadership conceived the plan of striking the Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbor at the same time as planned strikes on US, Dutch and British possessions in the Philippines and elsewhere. The Pearl Harbor attack was inspired partly by the British raid on Taranto, and was designed to cripple the U.S. fleet in harbor to win the Japanese extra time to build that defensive perimeter. To say that the political leadership underestimated America's resolve for a long war is an understatement.   For some reading regarding Japanese prewar plans, Peattie and Evans, Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887-1941 is the gold standard. It covers both operational and strategic developments in the building of the navy, and how those influenced one another. It is weak on airpower, because the two realized they were writing a long book already, but Peattie used much of their research to write the companion volume Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909-1941 (Evans has passed away).     For some reading about Midway, the current best book out there is Parshall and Tully, Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway. It's The first history of Midway that draws heavily upon Japanese primary sources and dives into Japanese doctrine and tactics. Does an especially good job of telling the story from the Japanese perspective while rebutting or refuting many of the tropes about the battle and the ""failings"" that armchair admirals like to point out."
AskHistorians,3dxlh4,jschooltiger,6,Mon Jul 20 11:37:13 2015 UTC,Pretty much a perfect answer.  The only thing I might add is that the reason Japan needed those resources was because of an Allied embargo and asset freeze as a result of Japanese actions in Indochina and China.  Japan was stuck in a war in China that it absolutely needed to win (or face a military coup) and the only way it could win was with access to those supplies embargoed-an embargo which would only be lifted with a Japanese withdrawal from China.

AskHistorians,3dze66,Subs-man,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:08 2015 UTC,"Much of what I am about to say comes from work published in the following volume, so I suggest you read that:  Pfister, Joel and Nancy Schnog, eds.. Inventing the Psychological: Toward a Cultural History of Emotional Life in America. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997.  I have less to say on the German end of things, since I'm primarily a specialist in American culture. However, according to both Schnog and Pfister, as well as an influential essay by John Demos from 1978 that is republished in that volume, Americans never contested the notion that Freud invented both psychoanalysis and the modern discipline of psychology. In fact, American intellectuals had long been influenced by Germans (the first Americans to earn PhDs largely did so in Germany - see Diehl, Americans and German Scholarship, Yale UP, 1978), so this is not surprising.  Demos in his essay notes that the American mania for Freud stems at least in part from the fact that Freud's theories were well-suited to the emergent bourgeoisie, and the United States was the ultimate bourgeois nation (this irked Freud - he wanted the respect of the European scientific community, not the hard-charging upstarts in America). Freud's work, along with Marx and Weber's, is often seen as the foremost explication of bourgeois society, so this also makes sense.   I hope that someone else can fill in the blanks about why the German-speaking world (Freud was an Austrian, after all) was so interested in psychology, as that's beyond my expertise. I could probably speculate, but that's not what this sub is for.

While this can be a very heated topic for some, and I'm sure a few will disagree with what I have to say, great powers boil down to ""sovereign states that have the ability to exert influence on a global scale.""[1] The question to ask, then, is ""how and what ways can a country exert influence on a global scale?""  Industrially & Militarily  When Brazil gained its independence in 1824, Portugal wasn't an industrial or military superpower by any standard.[2] This is in part the reason Brazil was able to so easily declare independence (as previously stated in another thread yesterday),[3] but meant that the former colony lacked in military eminence and industrial might. Comparatively, the United States was founded and influenced by the world's foremost industrial and military superpower, and the colonies had to fight against it in order to win their independence. Many of the American forefathers were former British elites and generals who had been battle-tested over and over against foreign aggressors.[4] Most of those who ruled and shaped Brazil immediately prior to independence left to go back to Portugal, and most of the military action Brazil saw were internal struggles or against much weaker foreign actors (some sources say that in the Paraguayan War, the Triple Alliance of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay killed over 90% of Paraguay's male population).[5] Many of the resources which Great Britain had used to industrialize came from the British colonies in North America, so once independence had been won, those same colonies kept those resources to industrialize themselves, along with the knowledge from their former overlords on how to do it. It should also be remembered that the United States declared independence in 1776, giving them a 50 year head-start on Brazil.  On top of their differing starting parts, Brazil also wasn't as driven to industrialize as the United States was. While the Southern U.S. colonies were abundant with resources, but had rigid class divisions based on race (i.e. slavery), the Northern U.S. colonies were nowhere near as agriculturally productive, nor did they have as rigid racial/class distinctions.[6] For the most part, the region was made up of a well-educated, fairly homogeneous anglo-saxon, protestant/Calvinist populace. Given this culture and lack of easy agriculture, the Northern U.S. colonies focused heavily on industrialization as a means of living, incentivized from their British kin and competitive against their Southern counterparts. Subsequent wars, especially the American Civil War, and the compulsion to expand across its (then) uncharted Western frontier exploded industry in the United States.  Brazil was the complete opposite from that Northern U.S. colony atmosphere. While resource rich with coffee, cotton, and sugarcane plantations, only a small amount of individuals were educated (they also happened to be white), and eight times as many African slaves were brought to Brazil than the United States (~4mil. vs. ~500k).[7] As a result, the cheap, expendable--Brazilian plantation owners focused less on cultivating a community of slaves via family and childbirth and more on further importation--labor dis-incentivized the industrialization of Brazil until several decades after independence.[8]  From the 19th century well into the mid-20th century, Brazil continued to focus industrially on raw materials and were dependent upon commodity-exports.[9] That's vastly different from the United States, as it continually expanded across North America, it fought several wars against several different actors, each time engaging foreign nations as adversaries or allies. To maintain military superiority or competitiveness, a nation must have a successful economy. This meant increasing trade relations with former adversaries, the United Kingdom especially, constant innovation in industry (moving from the cottage system to the assembly line, using steam-powered engines on boats and trains to move resources, etc.), and gobbling up new land along the way (Louisiana Purchase bought from the French, California territory won from Mexico, Texas ceded from the Mexicans/Texans, Oregon territory disputed from the British, etc.).  Brazil didn't fight in a war against a major power until the First World War, during which it only sent limited support.[10] It was dis-incentivized from expanding its own territory in South America because most of the surrounding land had already been settled by the Spanish and, to a lesser extent North of it, the British and the French. There was also the chance that the United States would intervene if Brazil had attempted to seize land in the Western hemisphere, as per the Monroe Doctrine and Roosevelt Corollary.[11] After all, it's well known that the United States has intervened several times throughout Latin America for a variety of reasons. Moreover, what military action it did see were a number of internal revolts and revolutions.[12] Brazil also didn't have any close connections to any of the major powers of the time, especially compared to the United States, and Portugal was a mere shadow of its former glory.   Once the United States expanded from ""sea to shining sea,"" Americans now could have a significant military and trade presence in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, opening up Asia and the South Pacific as viable industry partners. Brazil has only ever had access to the Atlantic Ocean; until recently with China, it's trade within Asia and the South Pacific has been incredibly low or nonexistent.[13]   Culturally & Politically  With Great Britain laying the groundwork, continual conflict and trade since American independence is partly responsible for the English language becoming the new ""lingua franca."" Industrial and military competitiveness and superiority has led to a extensive spread of American media. While this is also a generalization, since the beginning of the 20th century, English has been more and more prevalent in almost every part of the world, in part because of the U.S. military, Hollywood, and, more recently, the Internet.[14] While Portuguese is out there, and it is spoken by many millions today, it pales in comparison to the use of English in business, diplomacy, academia, media, and online (We did it, Reddit!).  In recent history, Brazil has seen a number of military coups and dictatorships, mostly as a result of radically different approaches to combat market shocks and attitudes towards a commodity-export driven economy.[15] The military, like in several other Latin American countries, has taken over industry and economic development several times in the hopes of promoting domestic industry; each time, a number of strict protectionist policies would eventually bankrupt the country, bring a civilian uprising, overcorrect to the other extreme, bankrupt itself again, and repeat itself with another military coup. I'm generalizing here again, but this is the general theme of what happened.[16] One can imagine that this political situation didn't inspire confidence in foreign investors or trading partners, nor did it inspire too many groups politically to emulate their governments. While the United States has had economic downturns from time to time, at no time did it lead to a military coup or inflation rising 1000%+ a year.[17]  Ultimately, what has led the United States to become a global power has been a continual, combined industrial, military, cultural, and political advancement coupled with a starting point at the height of a former world power and the fortune of location. Brazil never had as great of a starting point as the United States did, and it seems to have almost always lived in its shadow in the Western Hemisphere. Nonetheless, most sources indicate that the South American country is en route to becoming an ""emerging power.""

AskHistorians,3dwkqm,Gramen,7,Mon Jul 20 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"I am by no means a historian but take an interest in history.  It wasn't uncommon for palaces and pyramids to be scavenged for building projects. One example is Amenhotep IV, one of Egypt's most infamous pharaohs, who pushed the New Kingdom away from their traditional religious beliefs and established a monotheistic cult of Aten. His palace was more or less a bustling city. After his death, the city was abandoned rather quickly, but not without the inhabitants taking whatever items and treasures were in Amenhotep's city.  Pyramids were certainly scavenged as well. Many construction projects utilized stones from Old Kingdom pyramids. One difference, however, is the purpose of the pyramids/burial grounds. There were smaller temples built alongside or inside the pyramids or tombs of pharaohs so that surviving family members could make offerings to the deceased. These tombs that were being used didn't make good grave robbing targets, so we really don't see much tomb robbing until the Libyan and later dynasties when the cults of former pharaohs died off.  All my information comes from Toby Wilkinsons's The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt. I don't have the book with me here unfortunately, so I don't have the specific pages, but I hope this helps.

There were, after all, also centuries upon centuries during which the structures did not enjoy the protection of Egyptian law."
AskHistorians,3dwkqm,pvg,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"I'm going to broaden the question a bit, out from just the Pyramids to the tombs in general:  The Egyptian belief system put a huge emphasis on the afterlife, but most of that belief centered on the tomb; there was no particular significance placed on the other material remains of the previous Pharaoh (i.e. their palaces).  There were entire bureaucracies devoted to the maintenance of the tombs. Including police forces.   The official cults of Egypt were fundamental to the structure of the entire society. Maintaining the tombs was, in some ways, no different than maintaining the government. Similar to how the splendor of medieval cathedrals was central to the power of the Catholic church.  The pyramids at Giza are made from some really big blocks. It took the entire state apparatus to build them and it would have taken a similar effort to dismantle them. Except for the original limestone sheathing. People might have stolen parts of that.   The pyramids have always been an identifying part of the city and the residents were/are proud of them. ""Why haven't the Americans melted down the Statue of Liberty?"" Because they like the Statue of Liberty.   Tombs, including the pyramids, were out in the ""red land"" (that is the desert) and no one really needed that land for anything other than tombs. Because the red lands are hot, dry and just terrible. Nothing will grow there. The palaces were in or adjacent to the ""black land"" (that is, the Nile's floodplain) and therefore occupied valuable real estate.   Many of the palaces did survive for quite a while, but they were often in cities and cities change over time. New ideologies took hold, new priorities. Meanwhile, the desert remained the desert forever and no one had any use for it.   Tombs are largely under ground. Once they are looted (which they almost universally were), tombs are effectively squared-off caves with some paintings on the walls. The pyramids don't even really have any paintings on the inside. They're pretty utilitarian.  Palaces were built of useful stone blocks.  Unless they weren't. Many palaces were probably built of mud brick, as was almost everything else. Mud brick is practical in Egypt, as there's very little rain, but only in the short term. Over the years, even Egyptian mud brick will melt.   Some Pharaohs built new palaces, others did not. It largely depended on how prosperous Egypt was at the time."

AskHistorians,3dut11,chaosakita,58,Sun Jul 19 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"Rwanda used national identity cards which included ethnicity. Thus, when the genocide began, soldiers, police and militia quickly executed key Tutsi and moderate Hutu leaders, then erected checkpoints and barricades and used these cards to systematically kill Tutsi. In urban areas for example, where residents were more anonymous, identification was facilitated using road blocks manned by military forces; each person passing the road block was required to show the national identity card, which included ethnicity, and any with Tutsi cards were slaughtered immediately. Additionally, moderate Hutu population was pressured to partake in the murders as well and often knew, within their own communities, who was Tutsi."
AskHistorians,3dut11,Eufonie,31,Sun Jul 19 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"This is a common misconception. When Belgian colonizers first arrived in Rwanda, the designation between Hutu and Tutsi was largely an economic one and people could move between the designations relatively fluidly. The Belgians saw the Tutsis who were generally the higher class of farmers as being both a distinct ethnic group and the rightful top of Rwandan society. They ensconced Tutsis as their colonial allies, assuming that this had been the eternal power structure of the society. The Belgians issued identity cards which arbitrarily assigned people to one of the two quasi-ethnicities based on what they identified as overarching physical characteristics, in line with racial thinking of the time (although if you owned more than ten cattle you were still a Tutsi, belying the economic nature of the distinction). In fact, many Europeans at the time sought to claim that Tutsis had ""Caucasoid"" features (possibly descended from King David) and had brought civilization to the ""Negroids"" of Central Africa from Northern Africa and were thus rightly superior to the Hutus and other Central African people's such as the Twa or pygmies. There had always been a significant amount of intermarriage between Tutsis and Hutus in the area that is now Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi and modern scholars typically don't view them as separate ethnic groups. The head of the Rwandan National Assembly is quoted in We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families as saying ""You can't tell us apart. We can't tell us apart.""  It's also worth pointing out that Hutus weren't super careful about who they killed. Besides slaughtering anyone they believed to be Tutsi or who had a Tutsi identity card, they also slaughtered Hutus who were married to Tutsis or otherwise seen as moderate or sympathetic to Tutsis. The native Twa also suffered heavily during the massacre. French schools in particular, being associated with the ruling Tutsi, proved popular targets. This really was a devastating, unthinkable event. In 100 days, 800,000 people were murdered, mostly with machetes and clubs and such. It boggles the mind how such a thing is even possible."
AskHistorians,3dvpkp,Celebreth,16,Sun Jul 19 22:42:40 2015 UTC,"Concerning Christianity, all Jesus really implies in the canonical scriptures is that the Kingdom is coming, and we should all prepare ourselves; he doesn’t come out and explicitly say anything about what we should expect. Not a whole lot there that’s new. Jesus seems to expect the usual heaven/hell dichotomy—the virtuous going to the former, the sinners cast into the latter. ""Hell,"" here, is gehenna in Latin, geenna in Greek transliteration from Hebrew, and it’s just “the valley of Hinnom outside Jerusalem (often, but erroneously, translated in English as hell)…the place where the Canaanites were said to have been sacrificing their children to their god Moloch (Molech in Hebrew).” By the time Jesus was around, it was a dump for the corpses of criminals and also for, well, garbage! Fires were set to burn all the lovely refuse, and sometimes sulfur was added to sanitize the place and keep the fire burning. Read more about this in Mark, which goes along with Isaiah about the whole geenna prophecy. Jesus himself didn’t really stress the punishment bit so much as the salvation-eternal life gig.  Jesus equates geenna with not only that fun image, but also with the total destruction of a person, body and soul—the real kicker here being the oblivion of your mortal soul, which makes entering the Kingdom of God impossible. However, the guy who ignored the beggar Lazarus found himself in Hades, ""burning from thirst and begging for a drop of water in great agony, while the poor man was seen in the embrace of Abraham. A great gulf separated the places were either of them was seated, to prevent crossings from one side to the other (Luke 16:19-31).”   That image seems to contradict the first bit, regarding oblivion, but it also goes along with Greek conceptions of refreshments being offered to the virtuous dead; Tantalus comes to mind as the Greek concept of what happens to the impious dead as far as food goes, standing in water he can’t drink and looking at fruit he can’t eat.  One last bit of contradiction in eschatology here: When does this judgment happen? It’s either immediately after the person’s death or during the second Coming, but it’s never made explicitly clear:   Although most of the dead would have to await their resurrection to be judged according to their deeds (Matt 25:31-46), some few could expect a special treatment. Most conspicuous is the case of the repentant criminal on the cross who was granted immediate entry to paradise (Luke 23:40-43), an idea that makes sense under the circum stances and is also in line with Jesus' attitude towards outcasts who acknowledge their sins in earnest. Some early Christians understood, with good reason, that this promise was also applicable to martyrs. (Kyrtatas)   A lot of the ideas of Hell seem to be derivative from Hebrew scripture and Hellenistic myth—oh! Akhmim fragment! Apocalypse of Peter!   It’s fun, it’s apocalyptic (all the best imagery is), it’s got Hellenistic overtones. The basic idea is that, rather than the canonical Revelation version of the Last Judgment (read: that the righteous live on and the sinners meet a final death), a Dante-esque categorization of the dead sinners will take place, and they’ll be meted out punishment specific to their crimes.   The Akhmim fragment is far removed from its original composition (read: about four centuries), and it’s in Greek. Kyrtatas’s paper (listed in the sources) has a lot of interesting history about the story’s constant reworking to incorporate new ideas, new punishments, et cetera, but here’s the bit from Bremmer’s paper on Paul and Peter:   The Apocalypse of Peter is highly important in the history of hell, as it was ""the first major Christian account of postmortem punishment out side the New Testament."" Unfortunately, we cannot be totally certain about its date and place of origin. In the end we are left with two conclusions. First, it was first written in Palestine but revised by a Jewish Christian author who used an Egyptian source or version and clearly was well-educated and at home in Greek culture. This orientation is also supported by the fact that he used the Septuagint for his quotations of the Old Testament. Alternatively, we also cannot exclude that it was written by a similarly educated author in Egypt using a Palestinian text. At this point, we simply do not know (Van Ruiten 2003). On the other hand, its date is much less disputed. At present there is a general consensus that it must date from the last decades of the first half of the second century ad, given its mention by Clement of Alexandria (apud Eus. HE 6.14.1; cf. Lightfoot 2007:132).   Bremmer goes on to mention Aristophanes, Plato (or pseudo-Plato), Vergil, and Greek myths like Sisyphus (best known for his hit, “rolling boulder up a hill for eternity"") and Prometheus (having his internal organs pecked out, regrown, pecked out again. For eternity).   Here are the greatest hits of the Akhmim fragment hell, translated by yours truly I CRINGE, but it's already on my laptop:   [VII-VIII] Some sinners were hanging by their tongues--blasphemers of the path of the just, lying upon a bed of fire as punishment. A great lake full of burning filth pooled there, in which stood those who turned from righteousness; angels fell upon them as torturers.  [IX]And there were others; women, adulteresses, were hung by the locks of their hair, above the boiling filth. And the men who commingled with them in the stain of adultery were hanging by their feet, and their heads were buried in the mire, and they cried with great shouts, ""We did not believe we would be sent to this place!""  [X] And I saw murderers (and their conspirators) being thrown into a place full of horrors and wicked creeping things, being gored by wild beasts and writhing in torment. And upon them were worms, just as clouds of darkness. And the souls of those who were murdered were standing above, overseeing the punishment of each of the murderers, and they proclaimed, ""God, your judgment is lawful.""  [XI] And near this place, I saw another, where the pus and the foulness of those being punished was running down, forming something like a lake. There sat women, up to their necks in this mixture; opposite them were many children, brought into the world in an untimely manner, seated and crying.  Emitting from the infants were gouts of fire, and the flames were striking the women about the eyes. These women were the unmarried who brought fetuses into the world and wounded them.   It basically goes on to list a number of punishments for a corresponding number of sins (including usurers, false martyrs, and homosexuals), and I’ve included a link in the sources for further reading!   Edit: Grammar.  Sources/Further Reading:   Here, Fiensy’s paper on lex talionis in the “Apocalypse of Peter”  Here, Bremmer's paper on Christian apocalypse..s?

AskHistorians,3dvpkp,nottheprinceofwales,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:01:10 2015 UTC,Cool! Was it the same way across all sects of Christianity?
AskHistorians,3dvpkp,nottheprinceofwales,3,Mon Jul 20 18:17:37 2015 UTC,"More eschatology! Whee!  In the interest of not producing a collection of trivia, I'll keep it focused on a couple of sects--the Gnostic Christians (couple: subsets of them) have a few really intriguing beliefs about the end of the world and the Kingdom of God.  Thomas Christians (whom I described briefly here) believed in the saying of Jesus reportedly set down by Didymos (or Didymus, Greek transliteration is dumb quirky) Judas Thomas. Here's what Christ has to say about the Kingdom in the gnostic Gospel of Thomas (from Layton's translation):   His disciples said to him, ""When is the kingdom going to come?"" [And Jesus said,] ""It is not by being waited for that it is going to come. They are not going to say, 'Here it is' or, 'There it is.' Rather, the kingdom of the father is spread out over the earth, and people do not see it.   Jesus, in Gospel of Thomas, places emphasis on the present state of humankind, rather than the whole gloom-and-doom spiel of Revelation. It's also interesting in that, speaking ""gnostically,"" sparks of the divine realm inhabit humans--the “kingdom"" is literally here, right now, in people. Thomas Christianity, though, doesn't do the whole origin-myth that other sects of gnostics do; Pagels argues, in fact, that Thomas Christians are not under the gnostic umbrella at all. Other scholars, though, assume the common narrative of gnostics with regard to the Thomas Christians, and thus would read that saying as I have interpreted it above. There's more on this in Layton's Gnostic Scriptures.   Furthermore, in the gnostic vein, Peel’s “Eschatology and the New Testament” (Novum Testamentum 12.2) explains this about the general “gnostic” eschatology:   The traditional view of Gnostic eschatology has been that the Gnostic ""knower"" by receiving the saving ""gnosis"" of who he is [metaphysically speaking], whence he has come, and whither he returns has already obtained in his earthly life the essentials of his eschatological hope. He enjoys a kind of ""instant eschatology"", being already saved in the ""Now”.   The post-mortem fate of the gnōstikoi, though, depends on the sect; the endgame is generally the reunion of the soul of the knower with the divine; but in certain subsets, a group of archons, created by an actively malicious blind God (Ialdabaoth, in Sethian/Barbelognostic lore), bar the passage of the soul. The knowledge gained is the soul’s guide to evading them and rejoining the divine realm.  Here’s Zandee (“Gnostic ideas on the fall and Salvation”, pp. 29-30) on the Sethian/Barbelognostic version of Hell:   The Proto-Archon creates with his fellow-archons the heimarmenē. ""They fettered, by means of measures, periods and times, the gods in heaven, the angels, demons and men so that all of them should be bound by them and they themselves become lords over all--an evil and perverse plan"" (A.J. 72.4).  According to Gnosticism, the cause of man's distress was to be submitted to the laws of this world. From these he must be redeemed, and Gnosis lifts him out of them. The 'territory' of the archons was localised in the sphere of the fixed stars, which, like a globe, encloses the earth and the lower spheres--ideas taken from astrological notions (Leisegang, p. 354).   Gnostic writings speak of the cosmos in depreciating terms. In its origin it is already a mistake. ""The world began with a false step. For he who created it desired to create it imperishable and immortal. He (i.e. the Creator) fell and had no share in the hope, for the world was not imperishable nor was its Creator"" (Gospel of Philip 123.3). The world originates ultimately from Sophia, the aeon fallen from the Pleroma, and it therefore has no part in the fixed nature of the Pleroma. ""Strong is the system of the Pleroma, small is that which detached itself and became cosmos"" (Rheginos, 46.35). ""The world is an illusion, rather than the resurrection"" (ibid. 48.15).   The Gnostic must escape the world. ""Our spirits leave the world before man sins"" (Gospel of Philip, 114.22). ""This world is eating corpses. Everything that is eaten from it is hated again. Truth is eating life"" (ibid. I2I.19). The Gnostic's attitude towards life is that of denial of the world.   Separation, in this case, is pretty much Hell; living here, in the material world, ruled by the malicious archons, is the undesired fate, though humankind did not incur this through any fault of their own. When Christ departs after revealing the origin of the world and the plan to restore it to the divine realm in the main S/BG myth, Secret Book of John (public domain translation here, he says this about salvation:   Those upon whom the spirit of life will descend and whom the spirit will empower will be saved, and will become perfect and worthy of greatness, and will be cleansed there of all evil and the anxieties of wickedness, since they are no longer anxious for anything except the incorruptible alone…  …[but those who had knowledge but turned away] will be taken to the place where the angels of misery go, where there is no repentance. They will be kept there until the day when those who have blasphemed against the spirit will be tortured and punished eternally. (Meyer 128-9)   Not only is our world, the material, owned and ruled by a malicious blind ruler-deity, but if you gain gnōsis of this fact, and who you’re supposed to be with respect to the divine (the nature of your participation in it), and ignore it and go about your business, you get more Hell!  A couple of things for further reading:  If you can JSTOR:  Wyatt’s “The Concept and Purpose of Hell: Its Nature and Development in Western Semitic Thought” (Numen 56.2,3) has great insights into the social issues and streams of thought that coalesced into the Christian Hell.   Löhr’s “Gnostic Determinism Reconsidered” (Vigiliae Christianae 46.4) goes into detail about reports by anti-heretical writers of the time (such as Irenaeus) of gnostic eschatology, as well as its seeming origins in Platonic thought.

After 1830 New England farmers also found themselves competing more and more with huge farms in the northwest ( like Ohio) when the Erie Canal made it possible to load grain onto boats and send it via the Great Lakes and the Hudson to the big cities on the Atlantic coast, and many of the farm girls who came to work in the Lowell Mass. textile mills had good reasons for leaving home.  And certainly agriculture was very profitable in the South. Tobacco ( in the 17th-18th centuries) and later cotton grow best in the warmer South, were cultivated by cheap slave labor, and there was also a great export demand for both. That made some very wealthy plantation owners."

It applied to anyone who was accused and found guilty of rape. In 1281, when the Jónsbók laws came into effect, the punishment changed; the offender would be executed if found guilty; in lieu of exile, the guilty party could pay a substantial fee to the Church (I don't have a copy of Jónsbók, so I can't tell you exactly what it was, unfortunately) and be branded with a hot iron to demonstrate his guilt.

AskHistorians,3duv58,depanneur,17,Sun Jul 19 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"I'll start by re-posting here several segments I've previously posted on punishment and Foucault.   His influence is hard to overstate ... he's frequently accused (and rightfully so) for his very selective historical sources, and for not doing sufficient archival work, but in general he remains an essential touchpoint for almost every historical work on punishment and incarceration [...] There are large caveats to these citations, which are often empirical objections, such as those pointed out by Spierenburg (Spectacle of Suffering, 1984). Elsewhere, it's true that many historians often cite Foucault's various writings without much further commentary, as if he's simply a necessary inclusion (and I'm certainly not alone in making this somewhat sad observation). [...] it should be made clear that you simply can't detach Foucault's theory from his historical works. He doesn't just use them as case studies for his thoughts; they were organic processes of writing, through which his practices and notions of archaeology and genealogy were developed. We have to be uncomfortably reductive to provide a synopsis of such a formidable theorist, but to phrase it simply, you have to understand that his histories were often long-scale, pulling back the historical strata—not solely in events but in what he called epistemes, or the epistemological boundaries of a culture’s discursive constructs of, say, the human body, of sex, of the purposes punishment, or of man itself—to explore the winding-through-history of such concepts. And you can really only imagine these by looking at them in practice: in Discipline and Punishment, he outlined the evolution of Western punitive thought from public punishment to incarceration as the individual subject replaced the communal, concomitant with the internalising process of panopticism ... (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2z2wlc/what_are_your_thoughts_on_michel_foucaults_impact/cpfe4tc)   That's all a bit tangential, but perhaps might helps some understand a little where I'm coming from. I'm more interested in the punishments and violence of the penal system rather than the move towards incarceration, so what I'm saying won't perhaps apply to others; in other words, I view his work from the early modern perspective, which with Discipline and Punish is concerned in many ways only for the sake of argument (""pre-modern justice was less a serious object of study in itself [for Foucault] than an elegant theoretical foil to the logic of modern punishment"", as Friedland, Seeing Justice Done, points out). But I think we have to pair him with other major theorists, in particular Norbert Elias, before anything truly productive is produced. For one, his claims of the early-modern executions' production of 'terror' for the public to reinforce sovereign authority ('Part 1: Torture' of Discipline and Punish) draw on Damiens' excruciating and drawn-out death - a very extraordinary case - to make more generalised arguments, which don't really hold up in ordinary acts of punishment (see e.g. Friedland, or Bastien, L'exécution publique à Paris au XVIIIe siècle, amongst many others, for varied challenges to this interpretation, including retribution, communal expiation, a return to deterrence and state consolidation, and so on). In this latter sense of its link to the state, secondly, you also need those like Elias to help link punishment to more concrete institutions and systems beyond Foucault's symbolic focus on sovereignty. Those like Spierenburg have therefore done amazing work to reinforce Foucault's thesis by combining it with Elias, while drawing analytical attention away from the former's almost too-blind emphasis on France, as well as underscoring how other forms of punitive spectacularity - and not executions and tortures - grew in strength in the 18th century (and furthered in more recent work by, as mentioned, Bastien, Friedland, Porret, Chavaud, etc.). As I wrote elsewhere:   ... see Pieter Spierenburg's now-classic The Spectacle of Suffering for an overview on spectacular punishment. Although a little dated, it holds its place firm as a go-to in this historical field of public punishment in early modern to modern Europe, and deals with the decline in capital and other visual corporeal punishments, drawing on Foucault's seminal Discipline and Punish -- which charted the 18th- to 19th-century transition from the physical infliction of pain upon the criminal's body to judicial reforms increasingly preoccupied with rehabilitation via incarceration -- and Elias' state-centred Civilizing Process, with a few revisions. (His introduction has a good summary and criticisms on these two 'giants' of the topic.) On the pillory itself, there are too many to list, and it depends what your geographical interests are: John Beattie’s Crime and the Courts in England (1985) is frequently quoted for his descriptions of the pillory as the ‘paradigm’ of the era’s penal practice. A lot of other publications are journal articles behind paywalls, but if you do have access, see as just two examples McGowen, ‘From Pillory to Gallows: The Punishment of Forgery’ (1999) or Greene, ‘Public Secrets: Sodomy and the Pillory in the 18th Century’ (2003). (Those are completely arbitrary suggestions, by the way; there are many others, needless to say.) To return to public penalties in general, there have been many possible answers proposed by historians and criminologists alike as to the causes of this growing antipathy to spectacular punishment. Squeamishness is one; others include the mounting control of the state, legal reformers' awareness of deterrence's failings, growing concerns for bodily integrity, and so forth. Some of these are problematic in their own respects. Shifts in elite sensibilities were not always concomitant with those of the lower classes when measured against continued popular attendance at executions during the 18th century, for instance. Others, like Foucault's narrative, have been found wanting; while discourses of pain and the body are important, for one, their dominance as causal factors might be reduced in favour of the sensibilities argument, since, as many have pointed out, hiding punishment did not necessitate its abolition. The death penalty is a notorious example of that, and I don't just mean in terms of the USA. (France's last guillotining was in 1977, for example.)

AskHistorians,3dwgxo,Aldheim,2,Mon Jul 20 02:45:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know a whole lot about this, but I seem to recall James Scott discussing the first attempts at ""scientific forestry"" in the 19th century in Prussia. This is in the book Seeing Like a State (warning, that is a link to the full pdf of the book).   These are the forests where you see rows and rows of trees, perfectly arranged (I assume this is what you mean by ""plantation forests""). They were developed primarily as a source of wood for fuel, and for reasons that I cannot recall, they were not terribly successful, as harvests would decline in succeeding generations.  If I recall correctly, this was the beginning of what we would think of as forestry, i.e. professional cultivation of the forest for resources, as opposed to felling on an as needed basis.

AskHistorians,3dxlav,SexyAsJohnMccain,6,Mon Jul 20 11:01:25 2015 UTC,"Conditions varied greatly depending on where you were, and what the conditions were like in which sector. In Flanders, where the water table was quite high, 'trenches' actually tended to be earthworks or redoubts of some sort built upwards from the ground, while in the south in the Argonne and the Vosges there weren't trenches at all, but individual redoubts cut out of hillsides. Both sides (Franco-British and German) had rotation systems, with German divisions in general spending more time on the frontline. British battalions could expect to spend an average of 4-7 days in the actual firing line, and the rest of their time in the rear or in reserve. Though it is true that German trenches tended to be better, this had to do with differing philosophies and roles, which I discuss more in detail here. In the winter they were cold, when it rained they could be muddy and wet, but in general the soldiers and armies learned to cope and adapt.  On top of the difficulty of making generalizations, when the trenches were so diverse in condition, is the fact that the 'trenches' really only existed as popular memory has it from 1915-16. The experience of the fighting in 1916, especially that of the Somme, showed the danger of holding static defences for the Germans, in the face of Franco-British air and fire power. The result was that 1917 saw the use of offensive tactics that rendered the trenches obsolete, while the defender moved to a system of elastic defense in depth that rendered trenches irrelevant in combat, essentially."

AskHistorians,3dxlav,DuxBelisarius,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"Sure thing!   PART ONE: ""We are not just fighting a battle ... but organizing an offensive system ..."", Ferdinand Foch  By the end of 1916, the Franco-British armies were beginning to grasp what we might call 'Combined Arms' or 'All Arms' Warfare, or as General (later Marshal and Supreme Allied Commander) Ferdinand Foch referred to it, the 'Scientific Battle'.   Infantry tactics evolved through the Somme and Verdun to emphasize fire-and-movement, in small, fluid platoon and section-based groups. Paddy Griffith referred to the British Platoon as a 'mini-army', as each section was restructured around a weapons system: Lewis Gun Light Machine Gun, Rifle Grenade Launcher, and 'Bombers' (infantry specially equipped with grenades). They had local fire support from 3 inch Stokes Mortars and Vickers Machine Guns in the British case, 37mm infantry guns and Hotchkiss Machine Guns in the French case. The Platoon became the basis of maneuver and attack for the Allied armies moving into 1917 .  Further up you had artillery, tanks and air support. Thanks to superior allied industry, the Franco-British armies could engage their German opponents in a Materialschlacht (battle of materiel) that their enemy could not hope to win, certainly not in the long run. For example, allied divisions outnumbered the Germans in terms of machine guns by 1917: 54 MG 08s and 108 MG 08/15s, compared to 64 Vickers and 192 Lewis guns, and 88 Hotchkiss and 432 Chauchat machine guns. Allied artillery, especially medium and heavy guns, reaped a terrible harvest especially during the Somme, where all three German defensive positions could be brought under fire by superior allied artillery, directed by forward observers on high ground and artillery spotter aircraft in the air. German tactics of counter-attacking for every inch of ground, packing their dugouts and assembly trenches with men in preparation for counter-attacks, ensured heavy losses, losses they could ill afford.  Aircraft and Tanks began to come into their own after 1916, especially in light of the Somme and Verdun. At Verdun, the French Army Air Forces were able to wipe the German Luftstreitkrafte from the skies, and this was also achieved on the Somme by the British Royal Flying Corps and the French. On the Somme, movement in daylight became nigh on impossible, with aircraft machine gunning anything that moved or directing deadly accurate artillery fire. The Somme essentially cemented Air Superiority as a necessary ingredient for victory on the modern battlefield. Though the RFC would suffer a severe setback in 'Bloody April' 1917, improved pilot training and better aircraft like the Sopwith Camel, ensured that the RFC bounced back.  Tanks were the final ingredient. Débuted at Flers-Courcelettes in September during the Somme Campaign, they initially met with mixed success, due to mechanical failures (something like 10 out 49 were operational at the end of the first day of the battle). However, subsequent use of the vehicles at Thiepval, the Schwaben Redoubt and the Ancre River demonstrated their capabilities as an infantry support asset, carrying forward the momentum of the advance by knocking out enemy strongpoints. The British and the French invested heavily in tanks by the war's end, something the Germans never did.  What made this even more effective was the ability of the Allied armies to tie these together. Emphasis was placed on the use of aircraft to improve battlefield liaison, means of battlefield communications like power buzzers, semaphore lamps, signals flags, etc were standardized and made to work effectively. Especially in the BEF, training at all levels was emphasized, and training manuals were constantly updated based on combat experienced, with in-put from officers, NCOs and enlisted men being sought out."
AskHistorians,3dxlav,DuxBelisarius,3,Mon Jul 20 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"PART TWO: "" ... against the enemy's defensive system.""  As First Quartermaster of the German Army Erich Ludendorff stated, referring to the Cambrai Conference of 8th September, 1916    We found that among the enemy infantry the power of the men had already been enhanced by that of the machine. Our efforts, on the contrary, depend too much on the men.   This was an acute problem the Germans would never truly get over. Their defensive efforts would ultimately rest on the back of the individual Landser (German Army slang, 'grunt' essentially). As Lieutenant-Colonel Max Bauer put it in November 1916   Battle is the proving ground for the inner value of all soldiers. Infantry is the primary weapon ... Forward against the enemy, cost what it may.    The Elastic Defense-in-Depth that was settled on after the end of the Somme led, as I said, to the break down of 'trench warfare', because the trench was no longer the centerpiece of the defense. Some were maintained, mostly to connect positions together. The centerpiece of the defense now were bunkers, pill boxes and obstacle belts based on anti-tank ditches, barbed and razor wire. Three 'zones' were laid out, the first zone consisting entirely of obstacles, with a smattering of observers, sharpshooters, machine gunners and some infantry. Then there was the 'Battle Zone', where the enemy would be engaged after having lost momentum through the first zone. Here, the Eingreif or Counter-attack divisions would be lorried-in and would attack the enemy, driving them out of the first two zones, having amassed for counter-attack in the third 'reserve' zone. The idea was to disperse the enemy's firepower as much as possible, before concentrating and driving them back.  This system did work, but only to an extent. At Arras in April 1917, British losses were c. 160 000, the loss rate of c. 4000 per day being perhaps the highest it was for the BEF in any battle of the war. German losses, however, were c. 120-130 000. In the course of the 3rd Ypres Campaign, British losses were c. 244 000. German losses, however, were about equal, if not slightly higher. The results of Elastic Defense-in-Depth dismayed Ludendorff, who actually resorted to the old Somme methods of packing the trenches during the Battle of Broodseinde on October 4th, 1917, during 3rd Ypres. The British attacked mere minutes before the Germans did, and one German observer described it:   In the early hours of 4 October, 4th Guards Infantry Division had completed all the necessary preparations for an attack to recapture the parts of the position near Zonnebeke which had been previously lost. They were already gathered in great masses and backed by reserves. Their batteries ... opened up heavy fire, only to be hit by a deluge of counterfire ... Simultaneously the enemy brought down drum fire on a fifteen kilometre front...The 4th Guards was smashed before it ever got started   Another German officer simply wrote, ""what actually happened in that swampy area in the dark and the fog, no pen of a living author can ever write"". Ludendorff referred to this day as ""A Black Day for the German Army"".  The losses in 1917, combined with the nasty surprise of the British assault at Cambrai in November, placed the Germans in a position in which they needed to win the war in 1918, before the Americans could begin entering the Allied lines in force. Ludendorff gambled on Operation Michael, an offensive that placed all of it's hope on the Stosstruppen, special units of German assault troops that were formed by combing out the ranks of the best soldiers, and expecting them to 'bypass or haul ass' through the enemy's positions, bearing the brunt of initial losses. This system denuded the rest of the Infantry of their experienced core, unlike allied training which ensured high unit efficiency for all men. When the Stosstruppen suffered horrendous losses, while gaining nothing of strategic importance, the Germans had shot their bolt, thus setting the stage for the Allies to unleash their superior offensive system beginning in August 1918. The Battle of Amiens, also referred to as a ""Black Day for the German Army"", marked the beginning of the Hundred Days Offensives and the end of the line for the German Army."

I am of the personal opinion that Ometeotl probably did not exist, I've seen little iconographic or historical source material that convinces me that Ometeotl existed.  I believe Haly's arguments to be sound but I wouldn't say I am qualified to evaluate the matter fully.    I think the reason why Ometeotl has been so widely accepted among Mesoamericanists has less to do with the evidence and more to do with Leon-Portilla himself.  Leon-Portilla is more or less the architect of our present understanding of Aztec philosophy and cosmology.  There are few scholars around today that rival his grasp of Nahuatl and the source material and because the concept of Ometeotl fits so neatly within the larger interpretation presented by Leon-Portilla it has just been accepted.  This of course just my reading of the matter, I am sure the users I pointed to would offer a different view."
AskHistorians,3dw2tr,Ahhuatl,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply and the helpful suggestions! :) I decided to create a Reddit account and ask r/AskHistorians to get a different viewpoint, so I'm quite glad to hear your opinion! I agree with you, I lean towards the belief that Ometeotl was never worshiped or venerated. I'll say more of my thoughts on why I don't believe in Ometeotl, of course I really want to hear other opinions. I've been studying Mesoamerica for years, and I have yet to be really convinced of Ometeotl. I remember reading Aztec Thought and Culture years ago, and taking all the epithets mentioned in that as proof of Ometeotl. However, the more I read the more I doubted the existence of Ometeotl. I remember when I first read the Florentine Codex I was surprised to see no mention of Ometeotl in Book 1 (The Gods) or Book 3 (The Origin of the Gods). One would think in such an encyclopedic work at least one mention would be made of the supreme deity! But seeing as how the deity is mentioned constantly by modern scholars, I still figured I must be missing something in the primary sources. But then I thought back to all the other primary sources I had read. The deity wasn't mentioned in any primary source I had read, and I have a personal library of over 400 books! Ometeotl is not mentioned in the Cantares Mexicanos, Ometeotl is not mentioned in the Book of the Gods and Rites, and Ometeotl is not even depicted in any Aztec iconography. I mean duality was obviously important to all Mesoamerican peoples, and duality is thus present everywhere you look in Aztec iconography. But that doesn't prove Ometeotl was ever worshiped. And the excuse that Ometeotl was like Nezahualcoyotl's ""Lord of the Close Vicinity"" and intangible, and thus not ever depicted... That excuse starts to wear thin, I mean Allah is never depicted, but there's ample evidence that Allah is worshiped. Where is the textual evidence for Ometeotl? BESIDES the five questionable references put forward by Portilla. I mean taking epithets in the primary sources as referring to Ometeotl (Cause of All, Giver of Life, etc.) when they're clearly referring to other deities in many cases, that is not textual evidence to me. Anyway, I decided to ask several friends in my field, and I heard only ""People who know more than me say Ometeotl was worshiped, so Ometeotl was worshiped."" It seems a shame to me that scholars who study Mesoamerica (and scholars in general) often follow the authority of the researcher without critically examining the actual research with an objective lens. It's like how archaeology before Lewis Binford relied more on researcher status and reputation than good research. Additionally, it has been so established for so long that Ometeotl WAS a real deity, that I think people are afraid to question it and open up all of Aztec religion for reinterpretation... It reminds me of the old ""Clovis First"" situation. People don't want to rock the establishment. People are also of course afraid to challenge any of the ideas of a scholar as knowledgeable as Miguel Leon-Portilla, as you said. After reading several of his books, his proposed cosmology does make internal sense. But with the outside evidence it cites it stops making sense... At least to me, the citations just don't hold up. I greatly respect Portilla for doing so much to unlock the ancient Nahuatl mind, I just think he is probably wrong in this particular case. No one wants to call him out on it, because it literally undermines the whole Aztec cosmos lol"
AskHistorians,3dw2tr,400-Rabbits,3,Tue Jul 21 01:42:55 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend delving into the works of James Maffie, who has been doing some amazing writing about Aztec philosophical and theosophical concepts in the past decade or so.   Ometeotl is really not that old of a concept, really being formulated with Leon-Portilla. It's gauche to critique Leon-Portilla, and for good reason. His work really did mark a dramatic shift in the study of Aztec thought, one that directed it towards a more formal and intellectual investigation of the ""thought and culture"" of the Nahua. Dealing with this topic, the works and ideas of Leon-Portilla are what future writers will need to encounter if they are to be taken seriously.  That said, the notion that there was a singular deity called Ometeotl has always been somewhat controversial. To segue into Maffie's argument, he does not so much reject the idea of the concept of Ometeotl so much as he rejects the reality of Ometeotl. In Maffie's view, he views the deities of the Aztec pantheon as neither deities nor a pantheon (nor, one would imagine, Holy, Roman, or an Empire). The gods are more embodiments of naturalistic and philosophical concepts viewed through cultural archetypes. If we take the concept of the ixiptla -- an real individual who is seen as and treated as the living personification of a particular deity -- as our guide, the idea is that the ""gods"" of the Nahua ""pantheon"" were not defined singular entities, but rather manifestations of abstract and concrete ideas. The gods are real, but are not discrete entities. They arise out of universal constants, and thus are more than real in that they are representatives of those constants (even as they are those constants).  Where does Ometeotl fit into this? Maffie focuses on the notion of teotl, an ill-defined term which can various be described as the divine, holy, demonic, otherworldly, supernatural, etc. Maffie (2013) describes it thusly:   The starting point of Nahua metaphysics is the claim that there exists a single, dynamic, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-regenerating sacred power or force. The Nahua referred to this power as “teotl.” Teotl is always active, actualized, and actualizing energy-in-motion. The cosmos and all its constituents are constituted by, as well as ultimately identical with, the sacred force of teotl. Teotl permeates, configures, and vivifies the entire cosmos and its contents.   Teotl is the underlying stuff of the universe. As such, it defies personification. Cramming teotl into Ometeotl is, therefore, an inappropriate and ultimately Eurocentric attempt to quantify a universal force as a singular entity. Maffie does not really reject the idea of Ometeotl, but sees the creation of a superior all-encompassing deity as an inappropriate personification of an underlying constant of reality.   Key to Nahua philosophy was a dynamic of duality and impermanence. The universe was in a constant fluctuation of creation and destruction, life and death, joy and sorrow. Rather than an oppositional view of these forces as good and evil, their interplay was necessary in the same way that the sun is necessary, in that it can grow crops as easily as it grows droughts. The concept of teotl underpins all of this dynamism, and is thus not personafiable. The creation of a singular deity to represent this notion is, in Maffie's view, the attempt to grapple with theosophical concepts that are alien to Eurasian notions through the lens of traditional approaches to mythological and religion. It is an approach with attempts to give discrete form to something which is, by definition, not only non-discrete, but ubiquitous."
AskHistorians,3dvjg9,JournalofFailure,7,Sun Jul 19 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"The British colonies which now make up Canada, consisted at the time of the Revolution of:  Canada (as differentiated from Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, which were different colonies) which had been French until 1763, only 13 years before the Revolution.  Nova Scotia, which included New Brunswick, which was populated roughly 1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4; by New Englanders (who had taken over land from the expelled Acadians), Acadians (French who had evaded expulsion, or returned), British settlers who had recently arrived (mostly around the naval base of Halifax), and Native Americans (mostly Micmacs) who had been there longer.  Prince Edward Island, which was inhabited by Acadians and English settlers.  Newfoundland (and Labrador) which was inhabited by English settlers.  The American Revolutionaries hoped to attract (or compel) at least Canada and Nova Scotia (Nova Scotia included New Brunswick until 1784, after the revolution) to join the rebellion.   There were Revolutionary sympathizers in Nova Scotia. The British had exiled many of the French Acadians from Nova Scotia during the French and Indian War. (many of these eventually ended up in Louisiana where they were known as ""Cajuns"" - short for ""Acadians"".). To replace the exiled Acadians, the Empire recruited settlers from England, and from New England. At the time of the revolution, Nova Scotian population was about one quarter remaining Acadians, one quarter MicMac Native Americans, one quarter recently arrived from England, and one quarter recently arrived from New England.  Some Nova Scotians (particularly of New England derivation) sided with the Revolution, and with some American military help tried to seize the strategic Fort Cumberland (dominating the narrows between peninsular Nova Scotia and what is now New Brunswick). This attack and siege was narrowly beaten off when re-inforcements arrived by sea from Halfax. It was the strong British fleet and military base in Halifax, together with a sizeable population recently arrived from Britain who had no rebellious inclinations which kept Nova Scotia loyal.  The Rebels also had high hopes of support from Canada. Britain, however, had been particularly accommodating to the French Canadians, and buttered them up, so they were less supportive than the Rebels hoped. After early Rebel attacks on Montreal and Quebec were unsuccessful, Canada was secured by the Empire.  Besides remaining loyal to Britain during the American Revolution, the other main thing that set Canada on a different path to the United States was the immediate post revolution immigration of 40,000 Empire Loyalists. After the Empire lost the 13 American colonies, some 70,000 loyalists or ""Tories"" left the United States to remain in the British Empire. The 40,000 who went to Canada settled in Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, and provided a boost to the population of new settlers opposed to the United States, who would prove valuable in fighting for and protecting Canada in the war of 1812.   (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_empire_loyalist)  Jonathan Eddy was the main supporter of the American Revolutionary cause in Nova  Scotia.  He was a New England planter from Massachusetts who had settled in Nova Scotia after the Acadians had been expelled.

AskHistorians,3drttg,Eternal_stillness,885,Sat Jul 18 21:09:55 2015 UTC,"This is a bit of an oversimplification of the matter.  First and foremost, terra nullius was not used as a justification for European conquest until the early 17th century (if we are being generous).  Even then, there was a long and heated debate among Europeans about whether or not the concept was applicable to the Americas. Readers who are interested in that aspect can of the conquest of the Americas can read more about it here.  The important point here is that the legal framework you are pointing didn't even begin to come into use until more than a century after the Americas were discovered.  By that point in time, huge swaths of the Americas had already been conquered and the land rights of the indigenous people had already been ignored.  Terra nullius was by no means reflective of all the positions of the European colonizers.  Setting aside the numerous people who decried the conquest of the Americas, that rationalization was primarily used by the French and the English.   Pointing to it neither explains early colonial conquests nor why the French/English pursued it as a justification for their imperialism.  To answer that question, we need more background.  Following the discovery of the Americas, questions of what constituted a human, who owned the newly discovered lands (their European discoverers or the indigenous peoples), and how the peoples of the Americas fit into the Christian worldview ignited a huge debate in Europe and invariably required papal involvement.  The initial framework for the Papacy's decisions on the matter is generally held to be the 1454 Romanus Pontifex which sanctioned the enslavement of non-Christians in foreign lands.  The specific delineation of who would get to subjugate the peoples discovered by European explorers came shortly after Columbus returned from his first voyage in the form of the 1493 Inter caetera papal bull, which granted Spain all the lands within a specific portion of the world.  This decision came more as a result of European politics than the indigenous peoples themselves, as the full scope of the matter wouldn't become apparent until a few decades later. By the early 16th century, news of colonial abuses and the discovery/subjugation of high societies which were comparable to that of Europe (specifically the Aztec and later the Inca Empires) only complicated the matter further.  Catholic missionaries working the Americas not only began to not only assert the humanity of the peoples they encountered but also decry the unchristian behavior of the colonial conquerors.  The absence of the Americas and its indigenous peoples in the Bible posed a serious problem for Christians, who held the Bible to the be the result of an infallible deity.   How could such a huge area with so many varied people be absent in the Bible and conversely how could so many people know nothing of Christianity if, as it asserts in the Bible, Christianity had been preached to all nations of the Earth?  I won't go into the many and fascinating explanations for this conundrum but suffice to say many Europeans came to believe that their absence in the Bible must have been a sign that they were not human at all and indeed lacking souls.  Theological musings aside, the reality of the matter was that the first missionaries arriving in the Americas needed to do something with the indigenous peoples.  Proselytization would be hardly sensible or effective if the natives were deemed irrational and soulless, so the papacy formally decreed that indigenous peoples of the Americas were indeed rational humans with souls by means of the 1532 Sublimus Dei papal.  The bull also stipulated ""...the said Indians and all other people who may later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, even though they be outside the faith of Jesus Christ; and that they may and should, freely and legitimately, enjoy their liberty and the possession of their property; nor should they be in any way enslaved; should the contrary happen, it shall be null and have no effect.""  Obviously such a decree was in conflict with the interests of the European crowns who sought to conquer and subjugate the indigenous peoples of the Americas, so parts of it would be effectively nullified shortly after it was issued and the underlying issues it sought to address would continue to be up in the air for some time.  The Valladolid Debates of the 1550s demonstrate this quite well and as all of the aforementioned issues were brought before the Spanish Crown.  While detractors asserted that the indigenous peoples of the Americas were intellectually inferior to humans/Europeans and incapable of embracing Christianity, indigenous sympathizers pointed to the advanced material cultures of the indigenous peoples as a demonstration of their intellect parity with Europeans and pointed out the lauded forefathers of Western civilization, the Greeks and the Romans, were pagans who practiced all of the ""uncivilized and immoral"" behaviors Europeans saw in indigenous societies.   The results of the discussion were mixed and while some reforms were made, many of the underlying issues that started the discussion would still be around by the time the French and English became active in their conquests, which in turn was partly why new legal frameworks like terra nullius were looked to.  The shortcomings of early Spanish colonial law and the position of the Catholic Church caused Hispanic conquerors a great deal of trouble during the early days of the empire.  Almost immediately the slavery issue again resurfaced as the justification provided by the 1454 Romanus Pontifex totally failed colonizers.   Either sincerely or not, indigenous peoples quickly recognized that their non-Christian status was the justification for their oppression and as mass conversions swept through Spanish holdings, indigenous peoples and their European supporters that the justifications for their subjugation was no longer applicable; they had ceased to be non-Christians and since the Papacy had already decided that Christians could not be enslaved, theoretically it was all the more illegal to keep them in servitude.  Furthermore, regardless of whether or not European governments had settled the grandiose questions of where land rights were derived from, they had implicitly and legally already recognized that the indigenous peoples were the legal owners of the conquered lands.  Through their formal treaties with indigenous powers (like Cortes and the Tlaxcalteca), their creation and distribution of landed titles to indigenous nobles based on ancient claims to power, their usage of marriages to secure claims to land, and the overall legal framework they justified their conquests in (IE, Moctezuma was the ruler of Cemanahuac, he supposedly gave Cortes his authority verbally, therefore all ownership had been transferred to the Spanish) Europeans had already established a complex legal precedent that established their right to their lands.  The first generation of indigenous peoples to grow up under the thumb of Europeans widely and often successfully exploited this framework by taking the matter to court and demonstrating that they were the legitimate owners of their ancestral lands.  Herein lies the origins of racism as we know it today, for both Spain and Portugal began to develop a complicated legal system based on parentage that divided their colonial societies into different strata, each with differing rights and status in their colonies.  Concurrent to all of this, other European powers were watching the Spanish/Portuguese closely.  The mass conquest of American wealth catapulted Spain and Portugal to the upper rungs of the European political sphere and both Empires flexed their newly acquired muscles both politically and militarily. As news of Spanish brutality in the Americas and their political inroads threatened other European powers, the Black Legend began to take shape and the political context for a different approach was established.  Particular for England, which being Protestant couldn't turn to Papal law for its approach to colonialism and contempt for the ""Turk-like"" behavior of the Spanish helped solidify not only that England would take a different approach to colonialism but also that they were a people who were fundamentally different than the Spanish.  In terms of logistics, the difficulties the Spanish and Portuguese Empires had in administering the newly conquered lands also provide instruction for England, as a number of revolts and infighting among the conquistadors almost lead to the loss of the conquered territories on several occasions. A desire to maintain English sensibilities, rights, order, and authority lead to the development of colonial charters and companies which was symbolic of an effort to avoid the many problems that the Spain and Portugal had encountered while conquering indigenous kingdoms and city-states.  (Continued in reply)  Edit: So relieved this became my top post.  My last one was about Aztec influences in a video game.... so embarrassing."
AskHistorians,3drttg,Ahhuatl,550,Sat Jul 18 23:26:56 2015 UTC,"An overarching theme one will notice here is that the act of recognizing that a conquest has taken place inadvertently entailed a recognition of several other factors which you really don't want to deal with if you’re in the position of European powers.  While we, sitting some 500 years after the conquest of the New World began, have come to view the subjugation of the Americas inevitability, an informed and objective analysis of the historical record demonstrates otherwise.  To the individuals actually tasked with conquering and controlling foreign lands the Conquest was nebulous process which was constantly on the verge of unravelling whether through the actions of the indigenous peoples or their European conquerors. The great challenge faced by Spain and Portugal was the fact that they were totally reliant on self-interested people serving the interests of their respective crowns.  By recognizing that an empire/kingdom/city-state/society had been conquered, these governments had opened the doors to Europeans who believed they deserved special rights/compensation for their actions or the actions of their ancestors during the Conquest.  Conversely they had supplied indigenous peoples with moral, religious, and legal grounds to assert that they had been robbed, murdered, oppressed, and exploited and were therefore deserving of greater autonomy or compensation. Both factions were extremely powerful and posed a threat to imperial control in the Americas.   In the event of an indigenous uprising or colonizer-lead rebellion, neither Spain nor Portugal could simply send over an army to restore order and the authority of the crown; the logistics of doing so were quite simply impossible for that time.  Thus every instance of disagreement in the colonies had the potential of exploding into an uncontrollable wave of rebellion which would invariably make the Spanish and Portuguese look like incompetent tyrants in the eyes of other European kingdoms.  It is in this context that terra nullius and the large attitude we see today among North Americans (not Latin Americans) was born.  To quote the excellent work of María DeGuzmán:  ""Naturally, British settlers were as eager as Spanish settlers to reject the inferior status implicit in the notion of a conquered territory, and to insist on their entitlement to the rights and privileges they would have enjoyed had they stayed home.  Where Spanish colonists claimed these privileges by virtue of their own descent from the conquerors, or argued that the pre-conquest character of Mexico and Peru as kingdoms elevated them above mere 'colonial' status, English colonists were insistent that the 'vacant' lands they had settled fell outside of the definition of 'conquered' territories.""  The utility of terra nullius is thusly its ability to side step these issues of who was human, who was entitled to what rights, who owned what land, and indeed the ugly and immoral activities which underpinned British expansion....temporarily at least.  Eventually all of the European empires would have to deal with these issues and unfortunately they gave into the more savage leanings of European culture, rather than its moral ones.  To take off my historian hat for a moment and make a personal assessment of the matter, I believe that this attitude continues to underpin the thinking of Americans and Canadians today.  Whereas the issues of indigenous rights and the occupied nature of Latin American lands continues to be a powerful element within Latin American cultures, it all but invisible further north not just within the political sphere but also within the psychology of North Americans.  I had a very interesting interaction with a woman a while back who objected to the idea that the United States was an empire.  When I pointed to westward expansion as evidence of this, she freely admitted that she had never even thought about the push West by the United States as an act of imperialism/conquest.  She knew of the Indian Wars, she agreed the treatment of indigenous peoples was reprehensible, she acknowledged that when one group forcibly conquers another, that is imperialism but on a deep, intellectual level she could simply not wrap her mind around the idea that the United States was an empire.  Was she aware of all the history I have outlined? No.  Could she tell me what terra nullius was? Absolutely not.  Did she agree with the imperial rationalizations that I have outlined here? Nope.  Nevertheless the logic of these centuries-old ideas have been so deeply embedded in our collective psyches that we no longer even see the ambiguity, origins, and problems that the very people who forwarded them did.  This reality has a profound implications for how we conceive of ourselves, our countries, and interracial/cultural relations... but to address that topic I'd have to exceed my own official warrants in the kingdom of /r/AskHistorians.

The Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico, and even Hawaii all have pretty contested memories of US expansion- its not all negative, just as it isn't all positive.  Empire can be much harder to deny- but what kind of empire it was becomes up in the air and depends almost entirely on what 'facts' they chose to highlight.  Plenty of bad things happened- its not hard to find villains in 1898 (looking at you McKinley), but it's not hard to find good guys either.  There are definitely some difficult questions that face anyone who reads U.S. history as being the triumphal story of the good guys; but in my experience, students who don't want to read the U.S. as being 'bad' latch onto the 'civilizing' effects of the flag/empire or imagine the US to have been a better alternative to other overseas empires."

AskHistorians,3drttg,Barton_Foley,4,Mon Jul 20 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"Important to note that ""1898"" and U.S. annexation of the Philippines, Guam, and the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) did not come out of nothing.  At least in the case of the Sandwich Islands (the Hawaiian Islands), they decidedly did not find themselves suddenly under a new flag. The United States had a strong presence in Hawaii much earlier. In fact, in 1842, Secretary of State Daniel Webster brought Hawaii within the United States' sphere of influence. In a letter to Hawaiian agents (out of which came the Tyler Doctrine), who had been asking for a recognition of independence from the United States, Webster declared that the Hawaiians had a right to independence (but would not outright recognize their independence until the French and British did a few years later) and that annexation by any nation (other than the United States) would not be right. The only nation that would be allowed to annex the Sandwich Islands was the United States.   And so the United States controlled Hawaii's destiny from 1842.  Also funny thing about your flag comment...I know you meant it more metaphorically, but American flags in places outside of the North American continent much earlier than 1898. In a famous incident, the U.S. merchant consul in Shanghai in 1843, on the occasion of being appointed merchant consul, raised a U.S. flag over his residence on the Bund in the yet to be so-named British Settlement. This angered both the local Qing government officials and leading British residents, as they saw it as a symbolic claiming of the land. But the American consul stood by his guns. Literally. He was able to keep the flag up, it seems, because of the presence of the USS Vincennes, at the time part of the East India Squadron (which became, after the Civil War, part of the Asiatic Squadron which played a key role in the 1898 annexations) and somewhat strangely docked in the muddy waters of the Huangpu River off Shanghai."

I'm not sure I would go so far as to say the U.S. controlled The Hawaiian Kingdom's destiny after 1842- that's a little too deterministic from my point of view.  In yet another interesting case of flag raising- and a much earlier attempt at overseas expansion in the Pacific: all the way back in 1813- a U.S. naval commander by the name of David Porter established a small garrison/settlement (definitely more dream than reality) on the Marquesan Island of Nuku Hiva which he named Madisonville.  The experiment did not last too long- the very young US couldn't do much to support such a far flung claim- and none of the other whaling/commercial powers were enthused by the prospect of a rush to claim Pacific Islands (though they got on board a few decades later)- not to mention the unhappy response from the Marquesans themselves."
AskHistorians,3drttg,b1uepenguin,38,Sun Jul 19 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"Something of importance to note in the British tradition is the writing of John Locke in the Second Treatise of Government were he uses the Native people of the Americas as an example of people living in the State of Nature. He defines this state partly as one before property, with his definition of property rights being that whoever works the land and produces of it through their own labor owns the land. You can see some of that same sentiment in the various homesteading policies implemented by the British and American governments in North America. The idea that Native Americans didn't work the land and so had no legal claim on it is fairly pervasive in the English legal and political tradition (and therefore in the American tradition derived from the English legal tradition). Emphasis mine in the quotation from Locke below. The idea being that all nature is held in common, and only labor turns it into private property. Therefore colonists laboring to produce from the land make it their own, while the Native people who underutilize the land (at least in the perception of British/American colonists) have no claim to it.   The earth, and all that is therein, is given to men for the  support and comfort of their being. And tho' all the fruits it naturally  produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are  produced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a  private dominion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as they  are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of men, there  must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or other, before  they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man. The  fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure,  and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of  him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him  any good for the support of his life.  Sec. 27. Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be common to all men,  yet every man has a property in his own person: this no body has any right  to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may  say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that  nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and  joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property.   Edit: To be fair to Locke, his idea of property is a bit more expansive than the legal tradition I am citing. He goes on to say that an Indian harvesting acorns rightly makes them his property by removing them from nature through his own labor, but the general sentiment that labor=property rights does carry through the English and American colonial traditions and results in some of their relationship with Native American property rights.   Edit 2: To contrast with the Spanish approach (as you very well detailed in your posts), they often recognized the property rights of indigenous people. For instance, the rights of Pueblo people to agricultural lands in New Mexico were formally recognized by the Spanish after the 1680 Pueblo Revolt and those rights formed the legal basis for recognizing those rights under the US government after the annexation of the West after the Mexican-American war with the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. That the Pueblo people didn't suffer from a dispossession of their land as much as other indigenous groups under the US government is in part thanks to the existing legal recognition of their property rights under a European power."

I don't the historiography of European history has quite caught up to what we're doing in the Americas.    In any case, I'd take it a step farther and emphasize the time period Locke was writing in. Locke's formulation of property rights and civilization are very much a product of wider political dynamics I was talking about in my post.  Locke grew up in a world where much of the racial and imperial framework used by Spain had been partially digested in Europe.  It is not coincidental that his philosophy jived with what the English were trying to do or that he became so popular.  Locke is very much a product of colonialism.

As for the ways the 'New World' and colonialism in general are incorporated in a broader narrative of early modern Europe, I'm certainly more inclined to agree with you - although the economic dimension traditionally looms large, I'd imagine. Still, considering the demographic differences between the Americas and Europe and the logistical difficulties involved with transatlantic entanglements, I would be rather wary to cast the approaches of 'New World' historians into a yardstick to measure the work of, say, students of early modern Poland with, especially if it is done in such stark terms."

I'd argue that the groups you're talking about don't represent the broader trend in European historiography for this era.  There are most definitely currents that explore cultural and economic history, I am merely arguing that the impact of the New World on Europe's historical development is under-emphasized in favor of intellectual history.   As for the ways the 'New World' and colonialism in general are incorporated in a broader narrative of early modern Europe, I'm certainly more inclined to agree with you   Ah, I must have spoken a little to broadly - I did not mean to suggest anything other than this scope.   although the economic dimension traditionally looms large, I'd imagine.   Hm, I think even that is underplayed.  If you asked most historians of the era how much wealth was acquired from the Americas in the sixteenth century and to evaluate its impacts on Europe, I doubt you'd get a thorough answer from many of them.      I would be rather wary to cast the approaches of 'New World' historians into a yardstick to measure the work of, say, students of early modern Poland with, especially if it is done in such stark terms.    Well I think the matter changes a bit as you move further east and there is a little less investment in a shall we say grandiose version of European history.  A focus on the lower classes, transcultural interactions, and fluctuating identities is an approach that would be more widely welcomed and fairly applicable in a study of Polish history, even if the specifics of how those lenses were used was different than how we do things in the New World.  In any case, I think we're just bantering at this point - I suspect you and I pretty much on the same page when it comes to this."

Coming from Australia myself, the sole argument(sole argument portrayed by the media, anways...)is that Australia was declared Terra Nullius on arrival by the British which therefore forfeited land rights by the Aboriginals and has led us to Australia today.   It's also said the locals Aboriginies had no permanent structures and lived as a nomadic hunter gatherer society therefore they had no concept of land rights and thats why Terra Nullius is legal. Even though we know different tribes encompassed different areas throughout the country and even went to war over fertile hunting/fishing grounds. Permanant structures have also be found.  I guess what I'm trying to say, without yet touching upon it, is what you've just outlined explains why Terra Nullius was even resorted to in the first place and how it in itself as a reason or exscuse for subjecation of native people is ethically wrong,  yet governemts and media point it out and then fail to look at the history and development leading to its creation as a way around exploitation.

I'm just an undergraduate English major so I don't really know the actual standards of history writing but I get coniption fits when I write about history trying to make sure I'm damn well able to prove what I'm writing. Especially when you have a subject that's contended by a majority of the population, the papers end up very long.  I guess what I want to ask is how do you go about finding out what happened and actually proving it? My own research has been mostly on British Colonialism  in Palestine (I'd love to broaden my scope into the entire last century there but its taken me forever to somewhat sort that period out) and its incredibly difficult to figure out exactly what happened. When it comes down to it often times there's a discrepancy between the central government and the people governing the foreign lands. Obviously these are different scenarios so I apologize if they are not comparable. But how do you go about figuring out what actually happened in these scenarios. I was just noticing reading that the Spaniards in America seemed to really follow the laws from the main government in Spain. Is this an accurate depiction or were there often discrepancies? Did they take what worked and leave out the rest? Then if the sources are usually from characters in the drama how do you know what to believe and how to interpret them?"
AskHistorians,3drttg,chesterfieldkingz,2,Sun Jul 19 05:33:01 2015 UTC,"However, if you dramatically expanded it to paper-length, it would not be nearly so widely read, even on this sub.  There's a balance to be struck. This sub has a much wider reach than an academic journal, but less depth.   It also has a wider reach than most popular historical magazines or newspaper supplements, going by subscriber numbers, but it has -more- depth than they typically do. (Though fewer pretty pictures.) Not to mention that we're offered a unique chance to directly engage with the experts in question and ask for clarification or elaboration if and when needed.  That makes this place pretty unique and pretty amazing, but I think there's still a limit to be had. People don't come here (most of the time) to study specific topics in depth, but to further their general knowledge and education by learning the answers to those questions they'd never have thought to ask. We're a curious and interested bunch, but we don't have unlimited time or mental energy either.  In that context, a 2000 word overview with further down another 700 words on Locke and political theory from another user, seems to me to be a pretty ideal length.

By analogy, if I roll a dice and it comes up on a 6 20 times out of 20, I'm going to expect the dice is loaded and 6's are pretty inevitable.

Our popular narrative of contact and conquest in the U.S. greatly suffers from ignorance of the intricacies of Native American-European interaction. The popular story jumps temporally from 1492 to Jamestown/Plymouth to the Revolution, and is usually only presented from an European perspective, thus omitting nearly 300 years of war, peace, diplomacy, resistance, and persistence that shaped and informed the Indian Policy of the new United States. With each jump the future seems inevitable.  But it didn’t have to unfold this way.   It is conceivable that things might have been different. There could have arisen a polyglot Floridian Republic, a Francophone Mississippian America, a Hispanic New Biscay, a Republic of the Great Lakes, a Columbia- comprising the present Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Only if we assume a God-given drive toward geopolitical unity on the North American continent would this retrojection be meaningless. (Wolf, Europe and the People Without History, p.6)   Europeans entered a dynamic system with populations changing, growing, collapsing, dispersing, coalescing, making war, and negotiating peace. Colonial survival was not guaranteed. There are an infinite number of “what ifs” hidden under the hindsight bias of a terminal narrative. At every step along the way both the Europeans and Native Americans realized that conquest was a “close-run thing” (Restall, Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest). We do a disservice to the history of the New World when we assume there was only one possible way to arrive at this place and time."

Even more recently, there have been some minor conflicts (though largely non-violent) between Native American rights groups and the US.

She knew of the Indian Wars, she agreed the treatment of indigenous peoples was reprehensible, she acknowledged that when one group forcibly conquers another, that is imperialism but on a deep, intellectual level she could simply not wrap her mind around the idea that the United States was an empire.   The reason I mostly don't consider the US an empire is because, aside from a few exceptional instances, the territories that it conquered no longer contain any sizable portion of the conquered people.

Or that a person's claims to their homeland has nothing to do with their historic occupation but rather just size of the population that is there after massacres and forced relocation.  I can think of any number of people who have been the victims of oppressive regimes, both contemporary and historic, who would have some problems with that.  Mind you this isn't limited to indigenous folk either. I was born in New Mexico, my family was living in the Southwest long before the United States existed.

Also, I'm realizing that, as an American, my knowledge of colonialism in Latin America basically drops out as soon as the British set up shop in North America (since that's where the classic US history narrative shifts to the origins of the nascent US).

AskHistorians,3drttg,Ahhuatl,3,Sun Jul 19 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"Not to steer things off-topic, but I think it may be that something of interest can be uncovered in an attempt to clarify something here.   The Bible never states in any place that the Gospel HAS been preached to all peoples--rather, it says that it MUST be preached to all peoples in order that the parousia may take place. I have included below citations of these passages from both the Geneva Bible(GNV) and King James Version (KJV), both of which would have been available to and popular among Christians in the time period in question. They are identical, but I have included them both, so as to show that the wording is no different, regardless of theological heritage within Christianity of the time.   From Matthew 24:14, we read the words of Jesus:    And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached through the whole world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come. (GNV)  And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. (KJV)   Even the Tyndale Bible, upon which the KJV and GNV drew heavily, has the same wording, indicating a high degree of preservation in this textual tradition on throughout the 16th and 17th centuries:   And this gladtidingees of the kyngdome shalbe preached in all the worlde for a witnes vnto all nacions: and then shall the ende come.    From Mark 13:10, a similar proclamation from Jesus, speaking on the subject of the end of the age:    And the Gospel must first be published among all nations. (GNV)  And the gospel must first be published among all nations. (KJV)   The Douay-Rheims, Young's Literal, and all others produced in this time period and forward preserve these wordings, and provide no basis whatsoever for a misunderstanding of the religious status of these newly-encountered indigenous peoples within the Christian worldview.  In short, the indigenous Americans never posed any well-founded theological crisis for the explicit reason you gave when you asked the question:    ""How could such a huge area with so many varied people be absent in the Bible and conversely how could so many people know nothing of Christianity if, as it asserts in the Bible, Christianity had been preached to all nations of the Earth?""*   So, (provided, of course, that your information is accurate--I have no reason to believe otherwise) this may be better understood as a popular misunderstanding of the Bible (at best) by those Christians of the time rather than an actual conflict with the faith and the existence of the unchurched indigenous populations of America.   EDIT: Additionally, and to question further about the existence of a body of people absent from the Bible, do you have any information on what these folks thought of the cultures not explored directly in the Scriptural witness? The Nordic peoples, Asians, Pacific Islanders and so on? I'm aware that this falls more into the area of post-diluvian anthropology and such, but I have little information on that front.   *Emphasis mine"

He couldn't have known of the Americas; if he had, he would have spoken of them and (given the actions ascribed to him in the Acts of the Apostles and his missionary journeys).   This is why I'm saying that it could very well have been a theological misstep on the part of that generation.

Nothing about recognizing the achievements of a civilization inherently entails respecting its right to exist.  History is replete with the destruction of great cities and the conquest of grand societies. Envy and greed are powerful emotions. Furthermore Cortes actually expressed deep regrets about what he had done.  Some signs of this are visible in how he treated Moctezuma's children.  That said, Cortes was by no means the only conquistador who expressed this perspective - in fact as far as I know literally all of the testimonials of the conquistadors that exist today make some mention of similiar opinions.  Consider the much quoted words of Bernal Diaz:   And when we saw all those cities and villages built in the water, and other great towns on dry land, and that straight and level causeway leading to Mexico [i.e. Tenochtitlán], we were astounded. These great towns and cues [i.e., temples] and buildings rising from the water, all made of stone, seemed like an enchanted vision from the tale of Amadis. Indeed, some of our soldiers asked whether it was not all a dream. It is not surprising therefore that I should write in this vein. It was all so wonderful that I do not know how to describe this first glimpse of things never heard of, seen or dreamed of before. . . .  ...When we had taken a good look at all this, we went to the orchard and garden, which was a marvelous place both to see and walk in. I was never tired of noticing the diversity of trees and the various scents given off by each, and the paths choked with roses and other flowers, and the many local fruit-trees and rose-bushes, and the pond of fresh waterþ. Then there were birds of many breeds and varieties which came to the pond. I say again that I stood looking at it, and thought that no land like it would ever be discovered in the whole world.... But today all that I then saw is overthrown and destroyed; nothing is left standing."
AskHistorians,3drttg,Ahhuatl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:17:43 2015 UTC,"OK, fair enough. You got me.  Yet there is one thing that I'm still thinking about. I think that the conquistadors, or at least a lot of them, must have seen their society as superior to the pre-columbian ones. Your Diaz quote is very convincing, and I must concede that I was wrong about them (by and large) not considering them ""high societies"".   History is replete with the destruction of great cities and the conquest of grand societies   You're right, but I think that this supports my point about the conquistadors looking down upon Mesoamerican civilizations. An area that I know a little more about is the Anglo-Saxon conquest of England (or Lloegr if you're a celt) and the germanic tribes, much like the Diaz, admired the Roman architecture ... and then tore it down for building material. This is because they held, in their eyes, a distinct moral high-ground over the christian, weak Romans due to their military strength and adherence to the old ways of raiding, which had a quasi-religious significance to them  The saxon link is quite tenuous, but when the British moved into Southern Africa, they appreciated (admired is too strong a word) the cities such as Great Zimbabwe, yet this didn't stop their moral crusade to ""civilize"" Africa. Envy and Greed are powerful emotions, yes, but perceived Religious and Moral superiority are too.  TL:DR You're right, I admit that the Conquistadors by and large viewed them as high societies. My mistake was to assume that them viewing themselves as inherently superior meant that they viewed everything ""below"" them as merely barbaric."
AskHistorians,3drttg,The_Amazing_Emu,2,Sun Jul 19 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"I think that the conquistadors, or at least a lot of them, must have seen their society as superior to the pre-columbian ones.   Why?  One of the recurrent elements of the conquistadors' writings is how frequently they compare the cities and institutions they encountered to those of Spain - frequently stating that they were equal to or greater in quality what was found in Spain.  Lets cut to the chase here: the conquistadors were indeed horrified by human sacrifice and considered the indigenous peoples they encountered as morally and religiously inferior in some sense for that.  But there is a perspectival problem with how you're processing that reality.  You live in a world that is inherently built on a colonial logic that has been developing for centuries.  It is only out of this effort to justify the Conquest that all things have become a measure of the superiority/inferiority of a civilization.  The conquistadors did not possess that logic.  They viewed the world in a religious mindset which considered the development of a civilization less important than being Christian.  Europeans of this era readily admitted that the Muslim world was more advanced than they and praised Muslim sciences and cities as models of sophistication.  (One of the things readers are most surprised when reading Cortes' letters is hearing him speak of Africans as the most highly developed).  That admiration of Muslim accomplishments didn't stop them from thinking Muslims were scum precisely because they weren't Christian.  If you really want to see how these things were detached, you should look at the immediate history that followed the Conquest.  The missionaries that worked in New Spain praised the piety, humbleness, and civility of the indigenous peoples so much so that they were disgusted that a pagan people were more righteous than their Christian counterparts.  They go on at great length talking about how the indigenous peoples, once converted, would be the perfect Christians and even talk of building a better, utopian Christian world in the Americas.  Their view of indigenous societies was quite multifaceted which is precisely why we have so much historical documentation of indigenous societies.  Far from seeing what came before as worthless, even the clergy wholeheartedly dedicated themselves to documenting the views, practices, history, and politics of the indigenous people they colonized.  Their writings speak to a very deep division about how the indigenous cultures were treated, a division which can even be characterized as painful at times.   Anglo-Saxon conquest of England   You need to be very careful in using this kind of thinking.  You're talking about an event that occurred almost a thousand years before the discovery of the Americas.  During that time the people and values of Europe underwent an immense change.  Different cultures view conquest in different ways, and even though the people you're looking at all lived in the same geographical area that are in practice dramatically different cultures.   When the British moved into Southern Africa, they appreciated (admired is too strong a word) the cities such as Great Zimbabwe, yet this didn't stop their moral crusade to ""civilize"" Africa. Envy and Greed are powerful emotions, yes, but perceived Religious and Moral superiority are too.   When the British moved into South Africa, they did so centuries after the events we're talking about here.  When the economic, cultural, and technological state of Europe had changed dramatically and the racial framework that underpinned colonialism had already been established.  Much of the Scramble for Africa occurred when European sciences, particularly anthropology/archaeology, were forwarding racialized models of social development which justified the ""civilizing"" campaign in completely non-religious terms.  Their values and aims were a far cry from the Spanish, to say nothing of the Germanic tribes of old."
AskHistorians,3drttg,RioAbajo,63,Sun Jul 19 21:15:26 2015 UTC,"That's not really true.  A good example of European philosophy when it comes to ownership of the New World can be found in the US Supreme Court opinion of Johnson v. McIntosh, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543 (1823).  The Court goes to great length to describe (but not defend) the accepted rule that Discovery gave Europeans the right to sovereignty over the land, but not the right to occupancy.  Instead, the land could be obtained either through purchase or through conquest:  ""[D]iscovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy either by purchase or by conquest, and gave also a right to such a degree of sovereignty as the circumstances of the people would allow them to exercise.""  The use of the terminology of ""killed"" or ""stolen"" seems much more modern and is intended as pejorative towards European annexation (perhaps quite justifiably so).  If I had more time and energy, I'd quote from Francis Jennings's The Ambiguous Iroquois Empire, which talks in detail about how Maryland and Pennsylvania would actually use Indian tribes in proxy wars against other Indian tribes in order to stake out territorial claims at the expense of the other (in other words, if a tribe allied to Pennsylvania defeats another tribe, Pennsylvania would get that land instead of Maryland)."

Particularly vivid was the description of colonial europeans essentially encountering a refugee population that had been utterly decimated by disease. Pre-colonial visitors describe massive orchards, earthworks and the hand of man. Colonial visitors describe a thick wilderness that seemed untouched (as everything had reverted to nature).  This pattern repeats in South America as well (according to this book).  I've been told this book is a bit of propaganda but it read to me as a good source.  Thoughts?

That said, you are right in saying that early explorers encountered a continent much more densely populated than later colonists. Keep in mind that some of the earliest explorations in North America where in the 1520s, but earnest colonization of the East Coast didn't begin until the end of the 16th century and not in large part until the beginning of the 17th century. This is a century of demographic decline related to introduced diseases between these initial reports by Europeans and what colonists encountered. Even then, there were considerable populations vying for that land. Consider that the Indian Wars were probably the defining feature of US colonization of the Southeast and Western US in the 19th century, several centuries after initial colonial efforts, and the idea that the land was not populated comes into question."

The US government frequently set aside reservations and conceded land to various native nations, but many of those lands were later reclaimed by the government and the natives were forcibly relocated.  The most famous of these is the Cherokee ""Trail of Tears"", but quite a few tribes signed treaties with the US that were broken within a few decades when valuable resources were found inside their borders.  Colorado is another good example - treaties with the Ute nation originally ceded most of western Colorado to them, but the modern Ute reservation is a comparatively tiny slice of the Four Corners area.  ""Having their land stolen"" in that context would refer to the forced relocations under the Indian Removal Act and similar policies.

AskHistorians,3drttg,Ahhuatl,137,Sun Jul 19 03:16:53 2015 UTC,"I would challenge your assertion that the events are called as such ¨instead¨of being called a conquest. European involvement in the Americas is frequently called a ¨conquest,¨in literature, pop culture, and general knowledge.   Now, I will acknowledge that ¨conquest¨is a much less common term for North America, but there is a distinct strategical difference as well. (This might get rambly.) Typically, ¨conquest¨involves forcefully removing one government to be replaced with another. The conqueror rules over a conquered people, asserting their system of government, laws, etc. Colonization in Latin America didn´t involve the Jamestown/pilgrims concept of colonies as much as it did subjugating local populations. Inversely, while the North American land was forcefully taken, or ¨conquered¨, the people were killed or kicked out, not subjugated. It´s really hard to say native North Americans themselves were conquered. In South America, there was very much the idea that the locals were abosrbed into the Spanish Empire; they then ¨needed¨to be reorganized into proper settlements, taught Spanish religion and language, and, of course, be exploited for their labor. You don´t have British reducciones, where native folks were relocated into what was somewhere between an agricultural village and a labor/indoctrination camp. There was the white, European ¨ordered¨city, and the wild, native frontier, while in the south the two existed together, the Spanish on top and the locals under their feet. Now, later actions by the US are a different story, though not really my area.  To help, compare it with other conquests. When the Romans, Carthaginians, and Umayyads conquered Iberia, there were still Gauls/Visigoths/etc. there over which they enforced their rule. When various groups from the north conquered parts of China in the Six Kingdoms period, there were still Chinese people there. When Rome was conquered by folks from the north, Rome still stood. Generally conquest doesn´t mean killing/kicking out people and taking their land as much as does asserting rule over them. I hope that makes some sense."
AskHistorians,3drttg,RioAbajo,22,Sun Jul 19 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this perspective at all.  British missionaries did in fact forcibly incorporate indigenous peoples into British settlements - in fact that is pretty much all they did on the West coast.  On top of this, tens of thousands of natives were captured - sometimes the entire tribe - and shipped off to the Britain's Caribbean holdings.  While British colonialism was certainly different than Spanish colonialism, it think it is historically inaccurate to say that there was this imaginary line where on one side everyone was British and on the other everyone was not. Natives were conquered and the United States' later policies towards natives were very much in the same spirit as those of the British."

Natives living in Spanish mission systems in California, New Mexico, Texas, and Florida were certainly required to adopt Christianity and other kinds of European customs, but were largely allowed to maintain a separate identity rather than total assimilation (like that required by US policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries)."

Not really.  I think one of the dangers of history, particularly this kind of history, is trying to make overarching statements about aims of the empires in question.  Doing so flattens out history and creates a very fictional sort of long term, guiding philosophy.    The point I wanted to get across in my post was just how circumstantial all of this was.  This is a very, very hard concept to get across to laymen.  A consequence of the eurocentric nature of our history is that all of the errors of the European powers are cut out of the picture and so we are left with a malformed understanding of how the conquest of the New World unfolded.  When you look at the source material however a very different picture unfolds.  There are no inexplicably savvy conquistadors, no frightened and passive natives, no grand imperial strategies in the way we imagine them - just a lot of people fumbling around looking for fairytale cities or trying to figure out how to feed themselves.  The British trickled into the Americas and faced a very different political landscape than the Spanish.  They couldn't just knock off one ruler and then have huge chunks of land under themselves like the Spanish did with the Aztec and the Inca.  They were surrounded by independent societies which, contrary to all of this guns, germs, and steel nonsense, were perfectly capable of driving them off the continent.  They couldn't have done what the Spanish did.  Respecting indigenous societies meant being overrun or being swept up in local politics.  You know Southwestern history, so I don't need to tell you how important that indigenous base was to the Spanish.  For all the other readers though, I would emphasize that when the Spanish began to expand north they were able to do so primarily because of the indigenous base their original conquests granted them.  They could call up thousands of indigenous soldiers to protect their expeditions, to take them along known trade routes, to help them interact with the region's natives or at least find people who could.  They had a population to draw from if that expedition was crushed, a population that could supply them with food and equipment.  Having that grants you more stability and options than what the British or French faced - all they could do is throw some people on a boat and hope it worked out eventually.  In contrast, I wouldn't accept the claim that the Spanish allowed indigenous peoples to keep their identities any more so than the British.  You go down to Mexico even today and you will find that natives are still being terriorized for not being Spanish enough and even those that are just as Spanish as anyone else are treated like garbage.  Furthermore when you continue how central religion is to the identity of any people, its hard to say people were allowed to retain their identities but lose their religion.  To some degree this is a subjective discussion and I don't think there is any right answer but overall I'd say the intent was the same but the circumstances each empire faced warranted different approaches.  Side note - I read a lot of your posts, you do good work.  Thanks for that."
AskHistorians,3drttg,CommodoreCoCo,7,Sun Jul 19 12:12:59 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, we shouldn't generalize because colonialism played out very differently in every area. That said, you could generally contrast the goals or aspiration of the different colonial powers. The most important component of Spanish-indigenous relationships was conversion to Christianity. In New Mexico, California, and Florida, other aspects of culture were much less policed than were the religious practices. I think that just further supports that point - the situation in these places was nothing like Mesoamerica, where complex states existed that could be co-opted as part of the colonial strategy.    The British trickled into the Americas and faced a very different political landscape than the Spanish. They couldn't just knock off one ruler and then have huge chunks of land under themselves. They were surrounded by independent societies which, contrary to all of this guns, germs, and steel nonsense, were perfectly capable of driving them off the continent. They couldn't have done what the Spanish did. Respecting indigenous societies meant being overrun or swept up in local politics.   Really, this describes the Spanish experience in North Americas just as well. That said, outcomes were quite different in what had been Spanish America than what had been British America. Of course, a lot of this is because of the particular context of indigenous-colonial relationships in those specific areas, as you rightly point out, but we also can't ignore the intent and character of Spanish colonial programs vs. British colonial programs in influencing outcomes. I am 100% on board with making sure that local context is included in any narrative about colonialism, but there are differences in how European powers approached their respective colonial projects. Granted, much of that differed even with colonial empires based on the circumstances on the ground, but we can talk in generalities to a degree. Especially if we restrict our discussion to North America were circumstances were often fairly similar, or at least more so than the colonial circumstances in Meso and South America."

AskHistorians,3drttg,_watching,40,Sun Jul 19 00:49:35 2015 UTC,"""Conquest"" is a term applied to the gains of war, by definition ""the act of military subjugation of an enemy by force of arms"" (definition)  So we can say that the Aztecs or the Incans were conquered (the Spanish word conquistador literally means 'conqueror') however the English and French did not conquer the United States and Canada.  Rather they just kind of showed up and started doing their own thing, ignoring the Native inhabitants and setting up colonies on top of Native lands.(contrary to common belief, they did have a concept of land ownership)  Settlers didn't usually pay for the lands or get permission to settle their from the Natives, which is why we might say they stole the lands.  Things like the Indian Removal Act and the Trail of Tears are examples of land being stolen as Natives were forcibly removed from their lands.  This was not a subjugation of Native peoples, but rather a removal.  Later wars would not really be conquests by definition because they did not force the subjugation of the natives, rather they forced native tribes off the lands Europeans had settled.  Again, not a subjugation but a removal by force.  Here is a basic source to back up what I'm saying.  There are allegations that the US made it illegal to sell vaccines to Native people, and there are also allegations that the Trail of Tears was intentionally marched through areas infested with smallpox.  In addition to that there were massacres against peaceful Natives, and there may even have been bounties put on the heads of Native peoples.  Of course plenty of white people were also killed by Natives.  By the late 1800's, many Native groups were subjugated either through conquest or through assimilation.  So there were some Native groups that were conquered, but other groups were killed and had their land stolen.  I know I used a lot of wikipedia here, but I have read a couple of books and many articles on the subject, however the titles/authors escape me right now.

AskHistorians,3drttg,_watching,12,Sun Jul 19 05:18:00 2015 UTC,"My understanding of Native land ownership comes mostly from primary sources of explorers from the time, so it might be a bit off.  From my understanding, each native tribe had their own hunting grounds and farmlands, and the borders of a chief's influence was determined by the extent of his hunting grounds.  If another tribe interloped on these areas, it would cause a deterioration in relations between tribes and possibly war.  However, the death of 90% of the population made it so that many tribes were unable to adequately enforce their boundaries.  Also the articles I read were mostly about the tribes of Virginia/North Carolina, so this might not apply to tribes elsewhere.

AskHistorians,3drttg,LordHussyPants,20,Sun Jul 19 06:41:58 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: Perspective.  Can you conquer something you don't think is there?  Europeans largely didn't recognize preexisting land claims- land was claimed without having any European settlement or population- there was no conquest necessary for these claims to be recognized by other European polities.  To begin with you may want to check out this previous thread about how Europeans ""legally"" took the land.  To sum up that longer post; how one legally acquired land varied between different European polities to the extent that they didn't always recognize each other's claims, much less recognize the claims of indigenous peoples.    And really- that's the point.  Generally Europeans did not recognize pre-existing claims to land, so there was no 'conquest.'  Symbolic land claims, through ceremony, letters, acts of navigation, etc. were undertaken not for the sake of indigenous peoples, but for the sake of Europeans.  Unlike the example of Rome and Carthage put forward by someone else; Rome and Carthage fought a protracted series of wars against one another- they saw each other as governments with territorial claims.  In the Americas, land was claimed without ever having to send the troops inland- again you can't conquer a people if you don't think they have a government or a claim for you to take.  Now of course this varies across the two continents and island Caribbean- but generally land was claimed without governmental presence to administer it- so there was not always a direct conquest of indigenous peoples for them 'legally' be residing in territory claimed under the Spanish or British flag."
AskHistorians,3drttg,vancecandy,19,Sun Jul 19 00:47:42 2015 UTC,"The differences between 'stolen' and 'conquered' come down to the way history is written by the two parties. Indigenous American populations will largely have a narrative that focuses on the theft of land, while white Americans will have a narrative of conquest.  Why? Conquest is a more noble pursuit than theft. It has connotations of bravery and heroics.  Indigenous Americans have a vastly differing view though, because in many cases there were treaties signed between the United States government and the Indian Nations. These treaties supposedly gave the Indian Nations the rights to stay where they were, unmolested by the United States.  However, things change. Influx of settlers into America from Europe meant that more land was needed. So began the land grabs. Here's another comment I wrote 3 months ago which details Andrew Jackson's role in the land grabs of the early nineteenth century:   The worst perpetrator of the land grabs was most likely Andrew Jackson. While quelling American Indian rebellions in the early nineteenth century Jackson promised those who assisted him rewards of land. He also promised that ""...if either party, cherokees, friendly creeks, or whites, takes property of the Red Sticks, the property belongs to those who take it."" The Red Sticks were a faction of the Creek Nation who opposed assimilation with white American expansion, preferring to hold onto their land and culture. So we immediately see here an opposition to (a) leaving the land, and (b) abandoning native society and its practices.  But wait, I hear you say, what about the Cherokee and the friendly Creeks who were promised land? Surely that amounts to a promise of land that could eventually become a state for those indigenous Nations members who were loyal to America! Well, yes... in a way. Except for a few factors, including slaves, Jackson, treaties, Jackson, settlers, and Jackson.  Jackson was in charge of making a treaty after the war in 1814 against the Creek Nation, which was won by friendly Cherokee who fought for him. While making the treaty, he managed to come out the other side with ""half the land of the Creek nation"" for America. His response to protests made by Creeks who had fought with him? ""The United States would have been justified by the Great Spirit had they taken all the lands of the nation [...] the great body of the Creek chiefs and warriors did not respect the power of the United States"". This was given in response to Creek warriors who had helped Jackson in return for keeping their lands. It essentially set a standard of no promises could be kept.  Slavery was also still in play at this point, and when slaves escaped, they were often offered sanctuary in native villages and settlements. This was used as an excuse by Jackson(who commanded a sizable number of men), to raid into Florida(then a Spanish possession), as the Seminole were harbouring slaves. Jackson had continued making treaties with Indians, moving south as he did, and gradually coming up against Florida. Which he then took by the same methods.  In the words of Jackson, the treaties worked thus: ""...we addressed ourselves feelingly to the predominant and governing passion of all Indian tribes, i.e., their avarice or fear."" Jackson and those under him encouraged settlers to move onto Indian land, and then when the Indians raised protest, they were told nothing could be done. This led to Indians signing new treaties to cede that land, and moving further away to maintain their autonomy. Then the process repeated. The result was a crawling mass of settlers that gradually inched their way through indigenous nations lands, pushing them further west.  I realise this doesn't fully answer your question about the efforts to make a state, but it does show the mindset of the early white American settlers. Indians weren't respected: they were seen as people easily tricked. They were manipulated, and coerced, into moving. The best chance for Native Americans came early on, when Jefferson was Secretary of State. He said that ""where Indians lived within state boundaries they should not be interfered with, and that the government should remove white settlers who tried to encroach on them."" So what happened? The number of white settlers increased to a point where this wasn't viable anymore. Land was needed, and white settlers needs came before those of the indigenous peoples."

AskHistorians,3drttg,Carolus_Wrex,2,Sun Jul 19 03:14:27 2015 UTC,"I think the general point is that in many cases the native americans were deceived out of their land by treaties with the U.S. government that were not honored, either by the government itself for by settlers simply ignoring the treaty and moving in and claiming de facto ownership of the land.  This is arguable of course but the the native peoples could have potentially repelled or contained the expansion of the settlers had they decided en masse to take that course, but often times they did not, and chose instead to make treaties that were eventually ignored or broken, time and time again.  Also, many were killed by European diseases.  So yes it is semantics in a way but it's noting the fact that there wasn't a discrete military action that was taken by the US government. It was more of a series of incidents of not respecting the agreements made with the native peoples.  Sources: high school US history, and some armchair scholarship."

AskHistorians,3du3ii,chasergeek,12,Sun Jul 19 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"Are you asking about misconceptions of the ideology itself, or of the geopolitics of Communism? Based on your last couple statements, I'll assume the latter.  First off, the word ""imperialism"" is loaded with political significance. I would hesitate to use that word unless your purpose is explicit condemnation of US policy at the time, which is, of course, your prerogative. But the grand strategy of the US during the Cold War can be traced back to George Kennan, who posited his theory of containment in the late 40s. Essentially, his argument was that the Soviet Union was an expansionist and ideologically driven empire with designs on global hegemony. The only way the Soviets could be stopped was through containment, which meant that the United States would commit itself to defending areas of broad strategic significance like Western Europe and East Asia. This is why the US involves itself so heavily in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, when the direct threat to US security is virtually nonexistent.   People like to talk about the domino theory as an explanation for American voracity in defending the corrupt South Vietnamese regime, and that's a fairly accurate metaphor. For US policymakers, it was far better to halt Communism in the jungles of Indochina than in other, more vitally strategic places like Taiwan, South Korea, or Japan. Preventing the first domino from falling would theoretically stop the spread of Communism in its tracks. However, this leads to the primary misconception of Communism for American policymakers at the time - Communism, and the Communist world, was NOT a singular, monolithic entity with fervent commitment to global revolution. To most Americans, it certainly seemed that way, particularly after the Communist victory in China and the subsequent denial of diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic. Looking at a map where the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, North Korea, North Vietnam, China, etc., were all colored red, one could forgive the average American policy wonk for assuming that this was an inexorable spread of a singular ideological entity. Any spread of this contagion to Latin America, America's own backyard, would be easily interpreted as a direct existential threat to the United States, and would undermine US regional hegemony in the Western hemisphere. In order to preserve American power projection capabilities, it was - and is - necessary to maintain order in the region. When Communism reached Cuba, the quickness with which the US imposed sanctions, an embargo, and diplomatic isolation shows the seriousness with which it viewed any incursion into its area of influence.  Of course, US policymakers mischaracterized the Communist threat, as became increasingly clear after the Sino-Soviet split and border skirmishes between Communist Vietnam and Communist China. Nationalism was a latent factor in most, if not all, purportedly ""Communist"" revolutions, and many of the actual government economic policies implemented by these ""revolutionary"" governments had very little in common with Communist ideology. Even today, while China is nominally a Communist society and government, their economic system is undoubtedly far closer to Adam Smith than Karl Marx.  TL;DR version: American policymakers believed Communism to be a singular, unifying identity, one which trumped national borders and was capable of becoming a global ideology. This happened to not be the case, and nationalism ended up winning the day."

His Weltpolitik (World Policy) involving an aggressive, assertive foreign policy which involved Germany in the foreign affairs of other great powers lead to the 1st and 2nd Moroccan Crises.   He played some role in drawing relations much closer than was strategically wise to Austria-Hungary, but his most important role in the 'eastern question' leading up to WWI was in the December 8th War Council in 1912, held while the Second Moroccan and Scutari Crises were reaching their zenith. Bethmann-Hollweg had already reached a similar conclusion to that of the Kaiser in this meeting, which set about preparing Germany militarily, in earnest, for a war with Russia and her allies. The Kiel Canal would be widened by July 1914, a new army law would match Russia's Great Programme, leading to the European land Arms Race that served as a backdrop for WWI, and a press campaign was begun in Germany, ratcheting up the rhetoric of 'encirclement', and of the need to support the other 'Teutonic Empire' (Austria-Hungary) against the 'Slavic Menace'."

AskHistorians,3dx1fg,Cookie-Damage,2,Mon Jul 20 06:17:16 2015 UTC,"I find it very difficult to talk about ethno-linguistic groups or ethnogeneses here, because we have no evidence that there ever was such a thing as a 'Germanic' or 'Celtic' ethnic group - we are purely talking about linguistic groups here.   The Celtic languages have some features in common with the Romance branch of Indo-European, which have led scholars to propose an 'Italo-Celtic' subgroup of Indo-European (which would mean that the Romance and Celtic branch spent some time in close vicinity after separating), but this has been increasingly challenged (particularly by Calvert Watkins), although there are still scholars adhering to this view.  Some people equate the 'spread' of the 'Celts' with the expansion of the Hallstatt and La Tène archaeological cultures in central/western Europe, but there are huge problems associating archaeological 'cultures' with the spread of languages without any additional evidence - there are enough cases where languages spread without the material culture changing and the other way around to make this hypothetical at best.  The earliest evidence for Celtic languages are the Lepontic inscriptions in the Italian (and Swiss) alps from the second half of the 1st millennium BC and Gaulish texts from France and northern Italy. Slightly later (2nd century BC) Celtic inscriptions are known from north-central Spain (Celtiberian), and Brittonic is attested in Britain in the Roman period. We also have some evidence for Galatian in central Asia Minor and Noric in Austria/Slovenia. So what we know for sure is that by the 6th century Celtic speakers were present in a sizable portion of central Europe.  The case for Germanic is even more muddled, as people tend to conflate archaeological and linguistic evidence even more and we have less direct evidence. An often proposed homeland for the Germanic languages is Northern Europe (particularly northern Germany and southern Scandinavia), based, among other things, on early loans into neighbouring languages. Germanic languages are not very well attested before the 4th century AD (the Bible translation into Gothic): there are a few words and place names in Roman sources and a few scattered inscriptions from the 2nd century AD onwards. It is thus incredibly difficult to reach far-reaching conclusions here...  The question of the Indo-European homeland itself (and whether or not one should even look for one) is still heavily debated and there is by no means a consensus regarding the Pontic/Ukranian steppe...  So, the bottom line is that we can't really pinpoint where individual Indo-European languages split up - but it is clear that we are dealing with a gradual 'split' over longer periods of time and that not all languages branched out at the same time.

AskHistorians,3dun9m,TheFairyGuineaPig,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:19:23 2015 UTC,"The Wikipedia article on this is definitely interesting. First it cites The Hairdresser’s Journal from 1863 which provides plenty of information on hair theft, but doesn’t cite any sources itself. Obviously in the 19th century newspapers printed stories of hair theft, this can be found in the Wiki article or today you can find several current articles about this simply by googling “beware hair thieves.”   Perhaps a little surprising is that there hasn’t been a scholarly work, as far as I can tell, on the topic of hair stealing, so I will be forced to use newspaper accounts as my main sources, forgive me.  An article from 1882 in the New York Times, who was reprinting it from the Pall Mall Gazette, tells of a man who was sentenced to six months in prison for the theft of 87 pounds of Swedish human hair and selling it as horsehair at a value of $400 for the whole lot. The man, Lotze, was selling them to hairdressers so that they could make wigs. The article speculates that many hairdressers will face punishment and any ladies who had bought wigs made of stolen hair would be forced to give them up to the authorities.  On this side of the atlantic, stealing hair was a bit more serious. It seems that the more common crime was stealing the hair after it had already been detached from the person. This was the case for Henry Willis who stole nine “switches” of human hair valued at $105 from the show-case of John Delir. Mr. Willis was sentenced to four years in the State Prison.  There is the jarring report from Boston where a young woman was walking out of a hall and felt a tug on her hair, she looked back to find someone had cut her ponytail. The would-be hair thief was foiled however because her hair was put in place with pins and so made it too difficult to spirit away.  These are just a few examples from one source, of course. But in two of those cases it is apparent that the hair was being stolen for profit. The profit to be made was for wig makers. The popularity of wigs led to a high price for hair, which led the motivation to steal hair. The decline of the wig, we can logically determine, might have led to the decline in the hair thief.  This leads us to wigs. Much like hair theft, scholars seem to be silent on an extensive history of wig popularity. In 1855 in a rather colorful article in Crayon titled “Wigs and Their Wearers,” the unnamed author goes through the many styles and popularities of wigs but ends with the doubtful exclamation that from the point that Benjamin Franklin entered the court of France without a wig, wigs have belonged only to history. This, of course, makes little sense considering that people decades after this were stealing hair to sell to wigmakers. We know that Egyptians wore wigs and Romans apparently preferred blonde wigs made from German slave hair. There were the famous powdered wigs and the wigs worn in British courts.   The Wikipedia on Wigs states “Full wigs in the 19th and early 20th century were not fashionable.” and “During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century hairdressers in England and France did a brisk business supplying postiches, or pre-made small wiglets, curls, and false buns to be incorporated into the hairstyle.” The first statement has no source and the second comes from a book called “Hairstyles and Fashion: A Hairdresser’s History of Paris, 1910 - 1920,” which might be a good source, but I have no idea.  However a search of the New York Times after 1900 shows no cases of hair theft being reported, at least for the first decade of the century. We can only assume there was some unseen moment when criminals saw no profit in stealing human hair. Many decades later they would turn to stealing hair extensions.

AskHistorians,3duxyu,Alexander___Hamilton,16,Sun Jul 19 18:49:46 2015 UTC,"Pirates under Roman law, and later law, were considered to be Hostis humani generis, or enemy of all mankind (or perhaps more accurately, enemy of civilized nations). Piracy was essentially a crime that put one beyond all legal protection, and pirates forfeited their natural rights. So to put it bluntly, Romans were not fans of pirates--this is despite the fact that the ordinary conduct of warfare in the Mediterranean is indistinguishable from piracy, but that is a different topic.  So practically speaking, what did the Romans do? The Romans controlled significant stretches of coastline for about a thousand years before 476, so it changed quite a bit over time. In fact, one of our earliest bits of Latin is a treaty between Carthage and Rome in 509 BCE recorded by the historian Polybius. It essentially established zones of control between the two powers and regulations on activities the two could conduct within each others' zones. This treaty would be essentially meaningless unless there was some way each power had a way of regulating their coastline, and the implication behind it is a mutual fear of pirate raids. One could even argue that this treaty was setting out a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate naval activity. So while it is difficult to go into specifics, it is clear that the Romans had some sort of coastal patrol this far back.  There is more story here, but to skip ahead to Augustus we see the earliest development of a dedicated water pacification policy by the Romans. The explosion of the Romans into the eastern Mediterranean during the second century BCE had the effect of shattering the international system of the Hellenistic, with the result that the Greek states could no longer regulate their coasts, and so pirates became extremely rich and powerful, even to the point of raiding Rome's port at Ostia. The beginnings of a solution lay with Pompey the Great's wildly succesful campaign against pirates in 68 BCE. Pompey's success came through an adroit combination of military and diplomacy, and to a point he brought the pirates into the fold--a few decades later, a Cilician pirate was the commander of his son's fleet. This destroyed the ability of ""pirate kings"" along Turkey's southern coast to wage concerted military action, but pirates remained as parasites on the shipping system. To combat this, Augustus created a dedicated naval command across the Mediterranean to deny the pirates freedom of action. he also reorganized the Roman navy by discarding the clunky, Hellenistic style juggernauts in favor of swifter, sleeker libernian style vessels. This seems to have created a real pacification of the seas, the first and last time such a thing would be achieved until the modern era.  This system held until the Third Century Crisis, a period from 235-285 CE, a period of great turmoil when the empire very nearly broke apart. In particular, the Goths ""persuaded"" the Greek cities along the Black Sea to let them use their ships, and used them to conduct raids into the very heart of the empire. I'm rather ignorant of this period, however, so I'm not really sure what happened with this. At the end of the period, however, the emperor Diocletian reasserted control and reestablished the naval commands of Augustus.  It is in the period after this, and particularly later in the fourth century, that we can really start to talk about more concrete measures. For one, we have a lot more ""on the ground"" information--I would urge you to check out /u/shlin28's superb post on slave raiding in Late Antiquity. We also have a first hand account--St. Patrick was a Romano-Briton captured by Irish slave raiding. In fact, Britain gives us a very interesting and fiercely debated piece of information in the form of the Saxon Shore, which was a line of large military fortifications along southern and eastern England and northern France. It is endlessly argued about, but the conventional wisdom is that these were intended to stem increasingly damaging raids from Germany and, possibly, Scandinavia. So, broadly speaking in the later fourth century you can see a roughly simultaneous deterioration of Roman control of the coastlines, leading to the slave raids recorded in North Africa and in Britain. In the North Sea the response was to create a line of fortifications, in the Mediterranean the response is a bit murkier, and seemingly not entirely effective.  So we can see that throughout its history Rome had to deal with the threats that might attack its coasts from the sea, and it gained its most success in doing so by combining diplomacy with an active naval presence in regions of concern. Which is pretty much the case today.  A great and very readable source for ancient piracy is Philip DeSouza's Piracy in the Greco-Roman World."
AskHistorians,3duho3,TheophrastusBmbastus,12,Sun Jul 19 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult question to answer because it requires dealing with questions like ""what is the global literary canon?"", if such a thing exists in the first place, and the knowledge of how this particular book was received in a whole lot of different places. I have no idea, for example, how the novel is understood in China, just to pick one example.    But I can talk about what I do know, at least, and maybe someone else can fill in the answer in their area.  Crime and Punishment was published in 1866, serially, in the literary magazine Russkiy Vestnik (Russian Messenger).  Dostoevsky was known in literary circles, at least, in Russia already and had already achieved a moderate amount of success there.  Crime and Punishment was perhaps his most successful to date.  Incidentally, and now I'm speaking myself, I think part of the reason the Crime and Punishment ends up being so readable to our contemporary audience was this serial structure.  The fact that the novel was published in pieces meant that each piece had to (or at least benefited from) leaving the reader wanting more in much the same way modern page-turners do.  This is a stark difference from someone like Tolstoy in writing style and readability.  In any case, it was towards the end of his life that Dostoevsky became more and more popular even within Russia. (D.S Mirsky, A History of Russian Literature)  The first English translation I am aware of was in 1885 (4 years after his death).  I am not sure about other languages.  One of the famous comments about the novel that you may have heard was Nietzsche's remark that Dostoyevsky was one of the few who really had something to teach him about psychology.  In 1887 Nietzsche wrote in a letter that ""The same thing happened to me with Dostoyevsky as with Stendhal; the most haphazard encounter, a book that one opens casually on a book stall, and the very title of which is unknown to one—and then suddenly one's instinct speaks and one knows one has met a kinsman.""  He also mentions that the translation that he first read of Dostoevsky was in French. (Nietzsche to Peter Gast, March 1887) So, even from an academic standpoint Dostoevsky didn't really catch on until the late 19th century.    Dostoevsky also became increasingly important after the Russian Revolution in 1917 (in the west, specifically).  Russian scholars who emigrated from Russia at the time of the revolution had a big influence on the study of Dostoevsky in the places they went (Aileen Kelly, Toward Another Shore: Russian Thinkers Between Necessity and Chance - see Chapter 4) Dostoevsky's interest in socialism, nihilism, etc tended to speak to these emigres who had from their perspective been driven from their home country by precisely these forces.  As for ""national literary audiences"" - I really can't say.  Perhaps someone around here has done some research on precisely this topic, but I'm much more familiar with the novel's place in the intellectual history of the west than its place among more popular audiences."

AskHistorians,3du42i,koga90,18,Sun Jul 19 14:13:26 2015 UTC,"Walter Scheidel, probably the foremost social historian of Rome today, once memorably compared Rome to ISIS--the main difference, as he saw it, is that ISIS has yet to throw men to be torn apart by beasts. Other historians have compared the effect of Roman slavery on surrounding societies to the Trans-Atlantic slave trade's on west African society. So people hardly ignore these issues.  That being said, there are several things about Roman imperialism that make it a much less ""live"" issue than modern slavery and colonialism. The first, obviously, is that it was a very long time ago. These wounds have healed, and unlike, say, the British response to the Mau Mau uprising we can't speak to the victims of Roman conquest. We have very little in the way of testimony from those on the business end of the Roman war machine, which is in stark contrast to more modern equivalents.  But there is also a difference in the end result of conquest. The Romans displayed a sort of brutality that would make even the most hard-hearted colonial governor blanch but, on the other hand, their conquests were not ""continuously renewed"", so to speak. If you look at, say, the US conquest of the West, the status of Native Americans as a conquered peoples in a sense did not really go away and was frequently enforced through government measures (such as deportations). The Romans on the other hand did not really have the capability or the inclination to create a colonial system, and so in many respects the hand of the administration would be quite light. In fact, in Macedonia and Greece the Romans boasted that the population's tax burdens decreased after conquest. Which meant that after a few generations there were not really the barriers to mainstream society that were erected in colonial systems. Which is not to say that the Romans were any better than the Americans or British, but their conquest systems were less self perpetuating."

There are a lot of historians who work on ""the evils"" (circumscription) that Rome did and Roman conquest brought. And you won't see many historians who idolize the Roman empire. But the idolization was at least real until the Second World War. The cruelty of Rome was seen rather uncritical. Why? Because Rome was the ""founding father"" of Europe, and the European tradition owes a lot to the Romans.  Real history often enough doesn't have anything to do with popular culture and their perception of history. So I think your question should be why in popular culture Rome is seen much more uncritical than e.g. the mass murder of Native Americans.  edit: ANd the answer to that question would probably be because we can see the descendants of the victims and the societies this brought into existence. Slaves in Rome weren't a cohesive group, and the mass murder/ genocide of celts during the conquest of Gaul doesn't have any people who identify with them, as even the French are more or less in the tradition of Rome, and not in the tradition of Celtic Gaul."

As a historian, you interpret, interpreting is always a form of judging and many people are too afraid to state clear opinions and hide behind pseudo-objectivity (which actually makes their work less objective) because of this. Any historic work on slavery will always be filled with moral judgements, no matter if they get stated explicitly or through the context.  edit: Also I don't understand your answer in this context. You want to tell me its bad that historians work on the negative sides the Roman Empire brought? Because that is only what I stated.

I also realize that subjectivity is unavoidable, but that does not make it alright to openly delve into the study of something that requires you to take a hard moral stance, as the study of ""the evils"" of Roman conquest would require.  That being said, a historian should aknowledge his own biases, possibly state them, and work to get around them, not proudly introduce them as an integral part of his work."

That being said, a historian should aknowledge his own biases, possibly state them, and work to get around them, not proudly introduce them as an integral part of his work.   I disagree. You don't work around your bias, that's why you state and acknowledge them. Making your work seem like it isn't done by a human with emotions and a personal interest in the topic is a good way to write a bad paper. You either can prove your interpretation by your sources, or you can't. That is the minimum and the maximum of objectiveness.  And no work on various ""crimes"" (it would only be a crime if a court judges it) will come around of taking a moral stance. This happens either by stating it, and making it open to criticism and showing it to the reader, or by context where it gets buried in a priori arguments and inherent cultural norms.

I'm saying the biases should be stated, and then the matter should be studied with the awareness that one is prejudiced, and let the wonders of peer review and mutual criticism be the judges of whether or not you let your prejudices take hold of you or not.  I took issue with your first comment because you made it seem as if the decrial of Roman crimes was commonplace among historians, when it actually isn't. The study and assessment of the repercusions of Roman conquest is. The decrying of Roman ""crimes"" is not common in the academia, and nor is that of the conquest of America; it is rather something that mostly the broader public indulges in, as well as politicians and populist ideologues.

AskHistorians,3du8tb,cruisintom,31,Sun Jul 19 15:04:51 2015 UTC,"/u/restricteddata gave an excellent reply to a similar question, a few weeks ago:   It's not an easy question to answer and historians have argued about it for awhile[1] . To put it simply, it is fairly easy to explain the bombing of Hiroshima in terms of strategy and planning. It is well-documented. There are a lot of different motivations, including thoughts about the postwar situation (which includes the Soviets). The second bomb (intended for Kokura[2] but dropped on Nagasaki instead) is more troublesome. In hindsight, the official narrative was always about how, well, one bomb didn't do it, maybe a second was needed. But there is no real evidence from the time that anybody thought that way. And it misunderstands the role of ""strategy"" in the actual dropping of the bombs — the question of a second bomb was never deliberated at the high levels. The way it worked is something like this. The idea was to have several bombs to use, eventually, but most strategic discussion focused on the first bomb. The official bombing authorization[3] of late July 1945, however, said that: Additional bombs will be delivered on the above targets as soon as made ready by the project staff. Further instructions will be issued concerning targets other than those listed above. So it was an extremely open-ended order. The initial bombing date was ""after about 3 August 1945,"" and the first date that gave good weather for the bombing was August 6th. That became the Hiroshima bombing. The next one was scheduled for sometime around August 11th, but the weather forecast looked poor, so it was dropped on August 9th instead. Which is to say, the close proximity of the two bombs — within 3 days of each other, as opposed to 5 days of each other — was not due to high strategy, but to weather forecasts, and was decided by the people on the ground on the island of Tinian, not politicians in Washington. This is of relevance to the question because there are a lot of people who think the bombing of Hiroshima is justified, but when you get into the question of Nagasaki it gets more murky. Three days is not adequate time for a government to make a major decision; it is not really even adequate time for a government to assess what has happened (whether it was really an atomic bomb, what the damages were like, etc.). I think it is telling that immediately after Nagasaki, Truman issues an order that said, in essence, no more atomic bombing until I authorize it explicitly.[4] (And there were additional bombs being readied.) I see this as a re-assertion of control from someone who realizes that major geopolitical decisions are being made by local airmen. There are different interpretations for why two bombs were slated to be used at all[5] . Personally I lean towards the one that it wasn't actually part of some grand design. They had two bombs ready to go and they had a blanket order to bomb as they saw fit and they used them as such. I don't think it was due to high strategy whatsoever — the people who made the decisions on the ground were not concerned with Russia or anything else; they didn't even particularly regard the bomb as being something unusual, just another weapon.

AskHistorians,3dvjdf,Futurist110,3,Sun Jul 19 21:50:37 2015 UTC,"Two points to make here. One is that the bulk of the Egyptian Army's expedition force was concentrated in Gaza, from which they had tried and failed to conquer Israel's coastal plain. Israel's counterattack, Operation Horev, aimed at encircling and trapping the Egyptian Army in the Gaza Strip via invading Sinai. Israeli forces reached El Arish on the northern Sinai coast before heavy political pressure from Britain, which had a treaty agreement to defend Egypt from invasion and already was engaged in air skirmishes with the IDF, forced an Armistice. It's pretty safe to think of Egypt as a client state of the British Empire during this period and indeed up to the Suez Crisis.   Without foreign intervention, it's quite probable that the Egyptian Army would have been trapped and forced to surrender.    Point 2 to keep in mind is that the Gaza Strip at the time was already home to 200,000 Arabs, many of whom were refugees from areas already taken by the IDF.  Conquering them would have more than doubled the Arab population of the new state of Israel, which in 1949 was approximately 160,000.  Many of these refugees would have ubdoubtedly wanted to return to their old homes in the rest of what became Israel.  This is perhaps a moot point since Israel never did conquer Gaza but is something to keep in mind when you contemplate how fortunate Israel might have been to take Gaza."

It's pretty safe to think of Egypt as a client state of the British Empire during this period and indeed up to the Suez Crisis.  Without foreign intervention, it's quite probable that the Egyptian Army would have been trapped and forced to surrender.   I've got a question, though--could Israel have encircled these Egyptian Armies without ever entering Egypt itself, though?   Point 2 to keep in mind is that the Gaza Strip at the time was already home to 200,000 Arabs, many of whom were refugees from areas already taken by the IDF. Conquering them would have more than doubled the Arab population of the new state of Israel, which in 1949 was approximately 160,000. Many of these refugees would have ubdoubtedly wanted to return to their old homes in the rest of what became Israel. This is perhaps a moot point since Israel never did conquer Gaza but is something to keep in mind when you contemplate how fortunate Israel might have been to take Gaza.   Couldn't Israel have simply expelled most or all of these Arabs if/after it would have conquered the Gaza Strip, though?"

A shorter out flanking maneuver would have brought the Israelis into direct confrontation with Egyptians dug into Gaza, meaning higher casualties and slower progress.

Regarding hypothetical  expulsion of 200,000 hypothetically conquered civilians - yes, it could probably be done.  The cost to Israel's international reputation would have been very high even then.  The UN had already started to call for the return of Palestinian refugees to Israeli lands. Israel today can flout international public opinion due to its comfortable regional military superiority and close ties to the US. That was not the case in 1949. I doubt Britain would have taken kindly to their Egyptian allies being flooded with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.  Note also that Israel claimed that many if not most Palestinians left willingly; hard to argue that while simultaneously ethnically cleansing an area as large and dense as Gaza."

AskHistorians,3dutvj,nowlan101,8,Sun Jul 19 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"""Anyone who doesn't enter by the front gate is a thief and a robber,"" is a reference to John 10:1-6 of the Bible:  -Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep. To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he puts forth all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. A stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.[1]  Cortés, who literally walked into Montezuma's world through the front gate,[2] argues that he is like the Good Shepherd (Jesus), and the sheep in the sheepfold (the indigenous under Montezuma's rule) listened to his call (overthrow Montezuma). He is able to make such a lofty claim because he unseated Montezuma with the help of some indigenous tribes.[3] What he fails to mention is that once he and the Tlaxcalans took Montezuma prisoner, those Aztecs in the city laid siege to the palace. Only after the death of Montezuma did Cortés and company attempt to escape under the cover of night, known as La Noche Triste (The Sad Night).[4]  References to the Bible were signs of piety, civility (you had to have the knowledge of Latin), and justification. Cortés uses the biblical reference, then throws ""let your ears hear what your lips say"" at de las Casas because de las Casas is himself a man of God, a Dominican friar.[5] Simply put, Cortés is saying that de las Casas should practice and listen to what he preaches. To use the Bible to justify actions against a friar's affront is the ultimate 16th century burn.

AskHistorians,3dupz4,yoniroit,10,Sun Jul 19 17:41:51 2015 UTC,"Your core assumption needs some modification. While there was initially plenty of antagonism between the Bolsheviks and much of the intelligentsia, this did not gut Russian/Soviet sciences as you assume. Instead, in relatively short order, a working relationship was established between the new government and the scientific establishment. Far from being driven into exile en masse, I'd argue that the scientific intelligentsia was the one elite group to emerge from revolution with its position intact.  So let's quickly sketch how this relationship evolved, particularly with regard the 'hard' sciences.  Teachers, professors and employees of the Ministry of Education greeted the 1917 Revolution with condemnations, strikes and a passive withdrawal of cooperation. During the Civil War entire faculties sometimes physically decamped to join the Whites. Not a positive start. This was partly a product of class hostility to Bolshevism - both the student and professor body being relatively privileged pre-revolution - and partly another round in the long-running struggle for university autonomy from the state.  There was significantly less hostility from the Bolshevik side. While  some Bolshevik factions (eg Left Communists and Proletkult) ensured that the rhetoric was often shrill, the key figures (Lenin, Lunacharsky and Bukharin) were fairly conciliatory. This was due to both their own intellectual backgrounds, a growing awareness as to the need for technical specialists and a general Marxist appreciation for scientific progress.  (Where the Bolsheviks did of course take a particular interest was in the teaching of social sciences. It was from these that the victims of the 'Philosophers' Ships' were more likely to be drawn.)  Formal rapprochement between the two sides was hesitant during the civil war. The material deprivations bit as hard on the intelligentsia as any other group. And the new Soviet Commissariat for Education (Narkompros) was as chaotic as any of the other new Soviet bodies. It wasn't until 1921 that a charter was in place that formally governed the relationship between state and universities.  But the first steps towards reconciliation had started long before then. Cautious negotiations in 1918 saw cooperation restored with the Academy of Sciences. The latter needed funds and the Bolsheviks were keen to harness its members' technical knowledge. By 1920 Academy scientists were participating directly in state economic institutions (ie VSNKh) and a range of joint research institutions had been set up.  The Bolsheviks, and Lenin in particular, were enthusiastic about the 'hard' sciences but this attitude carried over to higher education in general. From 1919 onwards academics were provided with more rations and higher wages, monetary incentives were restored, old privileges reconfirmed and plenty of Soviet changes (eg the abolition of tenure) were honoured more on paper than reality. Similarly, natural scientists were little affected by censorship and senior academics had direct access to top Bolsheviks. When Pavolv wrote in 1919 requesting permission to emigrate, Lenin himself instructed that he be provided with the funds and equipment needed to continue his studies in Russia.  This continued during the 1920s as, following their technocratic bent, the Bolsheviks were happy to sponsor the expansion of Russian scientific establishments. New universities were established and the growing network of dedicated/professional research institutes allowed academics to retreat into their studies. The Civil War took its toll but overall the Russian scientific community emerged not just intact but, in 'hard' sciences at least, enlarged from its cooperation with the Soviet state.  In short: both Bolsheviks and the intelligentsia had a common interest in developing/funding research. By and large they were able to reach an accommodation that allowed scientists a degree of independence and funding that was acceptable to both. It just took some time to get there.  Sources:  Fitzpatrick's Education and Social Mobility in the Soviet Union spends a chapter looking at the relationship with the professors. It's also a seminal work in examining education in the early USSR in general.  There's also a couple of good essays by Bailes and McClelland that deal with the same topic in Party, State and Society in the Russian Civil War."
AskHistorians,3dupz4,International_KB,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:43 2015 UTC,"Well, you're painting an overly idyllic picture.  When Bolsheviks got the power they mostly replaced (and/or repressed) old specialists everywhere. Why? Because at the beginning Bolsheviks were full of naive thoughts that they can make everything differently. Everything.   They tried to ban the marriage, they abolished military grades, they  started to invent a new culture and new government practices... Basically they tried to did everything differently from their Tsarist predecessors.  Apparently it didn't work - Lenin's thesis that 'every housewife can rule the country' didn't survived the reality.  So they tried to partially revert their course, started NEP (New Economical Politic) in 1922 and asked survived specialists to get back to work. Most of those started to work for Bolsheviks.  That was the first wave of 'engineering renaissance' in USSR.  Unfortunately, problems within Soviet state cannot be solved quickly and Lenin was replaced by Stalin who was started to show his paranoia for 'contra-revolutionists'. Also they need to find some scapegoats to blame for stalled industrialization.  And first wave ended with Shakhty Trial and Industrial Party Trial. A lot of 'old' engineers were fired or were put on trial.  But during the years of first wave that 'old' engineers managed to raise a new, young engineers which mostly were from poor families.   That engineers were the second wave of 'engineering renaissance'.  Sadly, that second wave hit the Great Terror wall in 1934-1939. Repressions of engineers and scientists were somehow reverted only at the end of Great Terror.  Since OP mentioned a spaceflight, there's a good example: Korolev, one of the masterminds behind Soviet space program, was literally freed from eminent death:   In 1939 the NKVD asked Tupolev to compile a list of jailed engineers who he thought would be useful in developing military airplanes. Remembering Korolev as bright young student during his days at the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School, Tupolev put Korolev's name on a list of twenty-five that he gave to the NKVD. A year later while Korolev was waiting for relocation to Siberia, the NKVD transferred him to Tupolev's care. In late 1940, Korolev arrived at the Tupolev's sharashka, as the inmates called their prison laboratory. According to one contemporary, Korolev 'looked terrible. He was emaciated and exhausted'.   And as for scientists, a good example was Pyotr Kapitsa. He was literally kidnapped by USSR when he visited Russia to see his parents but was prohibited to travel back to UK.  tl;dr:  Bolsheviks finally managed to establish their engineering and scientific programs but about decade too late and they managed to exile or kill many of engineers and scientists.

AskHistorians,3dupz4,PerfectDD,6,Mon Jul 20 01:39:58 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree with this, largely because of two issues. I explore them below in more detail but I'd argue that:   It's simplistic on the Bolshevik treatment of the intelligentsia in general and specialists in particular. It fails to account for the effort expended in scientific endeavours during the Civil War years.   Treatment of the Specialists  In the first case, I never tire of emphasising just how unprepared the Bolsheviks were for assuming power. For a variety of reasons, there was no blueprint for a post-revolution society. The closest they came to such in 1917 were scattered thoughts on political structures. The result was both institutional chaos post-October and a bewildering variety of opinion within the Bolshevik Party itself.  The issue of specialists was no different. Not only was the radicalism of 1917 (the idea of 'purging and smashing' the state) not uniformly advocated by the Bolsheviks but it was quickly abandoned by Lenin himself. The new Bolshevik government made extensive use of the pre-existing Tsarist apparatus, a position enshrined in Lenin's proto-NEP of early 1918 (which went so far as to envision the use of capitalists in running the economy). By mid-1918 a census of the state bureaucracy established that only 13% of officials were party members or sympathisers, showing the clear limits to Soviet influence in the state apparatus. VSNKh (Supreme Council on the National Economy) provides a striking example: in 1920 over 75% of its employees were classified as specialists.  It was exactly this rapprochement with the specialists that formed a key plank of the various 'oppositions' up to 1928. In 1918 Bukharin, speaking for the Left Communists, twisted Lenin's metaphor, asking, ""It is good that the cook will be taught to govern the state but what will there be if a Commissar is placed over the cook?""  So the Bolshevik acceptance of the need for specialists happened in early 1918, not 1922. It wasn't until the NEP that their relative importance diminished, as a new generation of 'Red specialists' emerged from higher education (particularly rabfaks).  Scientific collaboration during the Civil War  Following on from the above there was extensive collaboration between the Soviet state and the academic community during the Civil War years. Scientific establishments needed funding and the Bolsheviks were keen to mobilise science to support their state-led modernisation efforts. I tried to avoid too much detail in my above comment but let's flesh out the degree of cooperation between the two.  From the Bolshevik side, the first ad hoc liaison bodies were took shape early: the Commissariat of Education formed a Science Department in Nov 1917 and a Council of Experts appeared in Jan 1918. Both were fairly ephemeral bodies formed of individual initiative but they showed the attraction of the scientific community to the Bolsheviks and played a role in negotiating with the Academy of Sciences. A more durable body was VSNKh's Scientific-Technical Department (NTO) of June 1918, which went on to be the lead body for coordinating scientific inputs into the state's modernisation programmes.  Bailes notes that this actually drove the expansion of the Russian research network during the War Communism period: over 40 new research institutions were established, bringing to 70 the number that existed in 1922. These included new centres for aerospace, x-rays, optics, electrified rail transport, nuclear physics ,automotive research, etc. In addition, massive and technically challenging engineering works such as the Volga-Don Canal and the electrification programme were finally green-lit during the Civil War.  These were big and ambitious projects and, just as the Red Army attracted its share of former Tsarist officials willing to further the national cause, they held much attraction for many scientists. During the Civil War period the Bolsheviks offered not just funds and (a degree of) autonomy but the opportunity to apply the sciences to the transformation of the country. Remington quotes a letter to the Council of Commissars: ""We are on the edge of a new epoch, distinguished by the fact that the construction of Russia in the figurative and literal sense of the word must occupy the first place and become the cornerstone of the rebirth of Russia and the industrial life of this country.""  Wrap-up  All of this squarely contradicts the notion of Bolsheviks set out to liquidate/shackle scientific specialists. There was an anti-specialist strain that ran through the Bolshevik Party but during the Civil War years this was largely limited to the opposition factions. Nor did it extend to the hard sciences, where the technocratic strain of Bolshevism encouraged collaboration with the scientific community.  Which is not to suggest that the relationship was all flowers and candyfloss, my comment above deals with some of the tensions that had to be overcome, but over time it was possible to reach a working relationship that survived until the late 1920s. But this was largely in place during the Civil War years and did not need to wait on the NEP.  In addition to the sources noted above, additional detail is from Remington's Building Socialism in Bolshevik Russia."

As I noted above, the actual number of academics forcibly deported from the USSR numbers in the hundreds, rather than thousands. And Bolshevik ire fell largely on the 'softer' disciplines – philosophers, writers, etc. Others emigrated to escape the material hardships of those years or out of sympathy with the Whites.  Yet this cannot be construed as an organised assault on higher education itself. Specialists, both technical and otherwise, continued to play a key role in Soviet government. Academics were able to retain many of the corporate privileges. Relations with academic institutions were generally via negotiation rather than coercion.

According to Remington, the planning started in 1918. Unless you have a source that suggests otherwise then this is not up for debate.   Let me remind you of Lenin's quote:   Oh go away with your cherry-picking. Or at least have the honesty to provide the full quote:   The intellectual forces of the workers and peasants are growing and gaining strength in the struggle to overthrow the bourgeoisie and its henchmen, the intellectual lackeys of capital, who imagine they are the brains of the nation. Actually, they are not the brains, but shit.  To the “intellectual forces” who want to bring science to the people (and not to act as servants of capital), we pay a salary above the average. That is a fact. We take care of them. That is a fact. Tens of thousands of officers are serving in our Red Army and are winning victory, despite the hundreds of traitors. That is a fact.   It should be abundantly clear that Lenin is not talking about the intelligentsia in general but rather those who had aligned themselves with the Whites. His attitude is very different towards those who are willing to work with the Soviets. I'm not sure how you could have read this second paragraph and still be arguing the opposite on the Soviet treatment of specialists.  I'm tempted to go into more detail on the absurdity of the Bolshevik leadership - largely comprised of self-styled intellectuals (Lenin continued to list his profession as 'publicist/writer') - being simply anti-intellectual.

AskHistorians,3duyq5,retarredroof,4,Sun Jul 19 18:55:48 2015 UTC,"Well, first, we have to answer what a juvenile delinquent is and then the history of criminal responsibility in the US. Figuring out what a juvenile delinquent is outside of the legal system is not an easy thing to do- is it just breaking the laws of the country? Is it breaking the unspoken social laws and norms, as well as legal violations? If so, there have been juvenile delinquents throughout history. There were youth subcultures probably since before Roman times, and there were always youth offenders- from pickpockets to rowdy apprentices rioting in Medieval London!  A juvenile delinquent is, legally, someone under the age of 17 who commits an act that would be charged as a crime if they were an adult, and juvenile delinquency is dealt with in juvenile courts or the criminal  justice system. The phrase 'juvenile delinquent' has long been a part of the American conscious, for example, this poster in 1936. The first reference to 'juvenile delinquent' that I can find is in 1817 (that I can find, where the phrase was mentioned in the Observer), see here, being mentioned infrequently before not being mentioned often between 1859 and 1903, when it suddenly experienced a massive upswing in usage, although the phrase was most commonly used in the 1950s and the 1970s. However the first use of the phrase 'juvenile delinquency' is in 1805, much earlier, showing that identifying those who were involved in juvenile delinquency by that took much longer.  A juvenile delinquent can be identified by many similar terms, such as juvenile offender, young offender, youth offender and so on. The earliest use of one of these phrases in writing, that I can find, is from 1680, where, in the Juvenile Rambles of Thomas Dangerfield, it is stared that 'young offenders incur the displeasure of the Law, ere they hardly understand what the Law forbids.'  The idea of a young offender is therefore an old one, but the phrase juvenile delinquent must only be two centuries old at most. It sounds official and grand, and that was probably why it was used- for reformatory schools, organisations and newspapers, being able to use 'juvenile delinquency' in their names, titles or articles lent a scientific, intelligent air. It probably migrated to America naturally, with British people emigrating to the US and bringing the phrase with them, and spreading by Americans 'copying' and following the trend of calling young offenders, juvenile delinquents.  This might be a useful resource for the history of the development of the youth justice system- it's for the UK, not the US unfortunately, but it shows the development of how people viewed 'juvenile delinquents'- and the developments in the treatment of young offenders too."

AskHistorians,3dx7j8,MyMixtapesOnFire,15,Mon Jul 20 07:39:24 2015 UTC,"This question is going to be very difficult to answer for three reasons. Firstly, because there is no such thing as a universal ""Stone Age"", secondly because the very idea of being transgender is a modern and culturally specific construction, and thirdly because analogous concepts in past cultures will vary greatly depending on the culture and so we can't generalize for every culture in a time period.   In regards to the ""Stone Age"" not really existing, different places on the planet experienced a ""Stone Age"" for different lengths of time and beginning and ending at different times. Additionally, ""Stone Age"" as a way of classifying time isn't really used by most archaeologists because it isn't specific enough. Very generally, most places on the planet will be divided into a ""Paleolithic"" (""Old Stone"" age) and a ""Neolithic"" (""New Stone"" age). Very generally, the Paleolithic in an area is characterized by stone tool technology and hunting and gathering subsistence or mixed hunting-gathering and horticulture. In contrast, the Neolithic in an area is generally characterized by the continued use of stone tools, but also the introduction of groundstone tools (so grinding stones, generally) and a change towards intensified use of wild cereals and the beginnings of plant and animal domestication. The origins of sedentary agricultural life are generally in the Neolithic.  That all said, these distinction are only useful in areas were sedentary agriculture became the primary subsistence strategy. In places were agriculture didn't supplant existing subsistence strategies, or areas which switched to nomadic pastoralism (i.e. herding), it isn't really appropriate to talk about a ""Stone Age"" at all.  For instance, in North America, the Paleolithic (what we call the Paleoindian era) generally ends around 2000-1000BC with the introduction of maize to the Southwest, and later to the Southeast. The Neolithic (what we call the Archaic period) generally ends around AD500 in the U.S. Southwest, and at a different time entirely in the U.S. Southeast. Here we mark the end of the Neolithic not by the introduction of metal tools (which is what marks the end of the Neolithic in Europe), but by the full adoption of sedentary agriculture. In contrast, in Europe, the Neolithic ends around 3000BC (but this varies depending on where in Europe) and involves the introduction of metal tools.   TL;DR: ""Stone Age"" isn't a specific era of history and is regionally specific. Additionally, it isn't appropriate to even talk about a ""Stone Age"" for certain areas and histories (like the Great Plains or parts of Central Asia) because a ""Stone Age"" doesn't describe the history of those areas very well.   As for the second point, the idea of being transgender is a modern, Western concept to describe a person experiencing gender dysphoria (the feeling that a culturally assigned gender and biological sex do not match an internal conception of self). While there were probably people in the past who experienced gender dysphoria they would not have understood themselves to be transgender as that is a term and concept specific to the recent past and mostly to Western cultures. That said, there are certainly very many well documented systems of non-binary gender in a variety of societies, including the Berdache of many Great Plains tribes such as the Crow and Sioux. These often operate with an individual taking on the culturally specific qualities of the gender opposite of what they were assigned at birth based on their biological characteristics. All that said, it would be a mistake to call the people within these systems of non-binary gender ""transgender"" because that is a culturally specific term which doesn't capture all the nuance and specificity of these systems in other cultures.   Finally, even if we could talk about a single ""Stone Age"" and if the idea of being transgender was transferable to people in the past, treatment of these people would very much be dependent on the particular culture in which they lived. Despite all being nominally ""Neolithic"" cultures, treatment of certain classes of people will be very different in Neolithic China compared to Neolithic Europe or the Archaic Southeastern North America. The treatment of people not belonging to a binary gender system is entirely culturally dependent and not at all dependent on the subsistence practices and technologies of that society. There are documented non-binary genders among almost every kind of society, from traditionally hunter-gatherer groups like the aforementioned Great Plains tribes to sedentary agriculturalists like in Southeast Asia.   If you can narrow your question down a bit more you might be able to receive a better answer, but until then you might be interested in this AMA about the history of sexuality (less related to gender issues, but there is some information) as well as this Tuesday Trivia feature about alternate gender expressions."

AskHistorians,3dukcr,hypnofrank,7,Sun Jul 19 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"For the first question- a firing squad is very symbolic. In my home country, there has been talk of bringing back execution by firing squad (currently there is execution by shooting, using one shooter), which would symbolise the condemnation of the victim by the state and public. Your peers, some who may have served with you, are condemning you to death and are judging you as guilty. It encourages and is symbolic of the solidarity inside armies, so instead of one man against one man, it is a group of men, brothers in arms, standing together, who, as an army, not as a person, condemn and execute the victim. It is also a preferred option for psychological reasons, especially for soldiers in the middle of the war. If one person executed the victim, that person would bear the guilt of the execution alone. If a team of people executed one person, they would share the guilt between them, could pass off direct blame for the death into others and feel solidarity and support from their peers during and after the execution. It's for similar psychological reasons that gas chambers were used in WW2, killing people is difficult- killing people who were from your country, your army, your regiment even, would be particularly hard. Firing squads would have eased the guilt and difficulty of executing a fellow soldier.  Another reason could be for the honour of the person being executed. To stand (or kneel) and face your death was much more honourable than a simple shot to the side or back of the head. Execution by firing squad gave those who were considered dishonourable, such as deserters, an honourable death at least, and this may have been to assuage the guilt of the executioners (so they did not feel they had dishonoured the person being executed) and also symbolic- whatever the executed person did, at least the army were honourable.  Firing squads are traditionally quite old- predating firearms. St Sebastian is depicted as having been shot by a firing squad's worth of arrows. This may have been an unusual punishment (I don't know much about Roman executions) but quite possibly not- it was an effective, quick death which didn't require any special equipment, just archers and arrows. People historically were probably very desensitised in war- they didn't shoot from far distances or fire mortar shells, many saw the people they killed and watched them die. Romans would have seen gladiator fights and public executions around the world were common until just over a century ago in much of the West, and in some places, public executions are still carried out.   Firing squads were not uncommon in the English Civil War, with deserters executed at Tyburn. There's also records of the execution of Admiral John Byng, who was executed by a naval firing squad after a retreat from Minorca, in the mid 18th century, and in 1743, a group of people, who deserted after learning they were to be posted in the Caribbean, were executed by firing squad in 1743. Firing squads were also the military execution method of choice until 1808 in Italy, until the introduction of the guillotine. They have historically been popular around Europe therefore, and spread with European colonialism. Although we have records of firing squads occurring from the advent of firearms in Europe, as noted above, they did occur before, for example, in Ancient Rome, where arrows were used, and likely in other societies throughout history for the 'positive' reasons behind firing squads mentioned above.

Both armies lacked proper anti task equipment and were not trained in the offensive German doctrines. Therefore, they were severely delayed in securing the banks of the Volga river as originally planned.   The Soviets recognized this and waited for bad weather to eliminate German air superiority. Then on November 19, they conducted a massive armoured push into the German flanks. Lacking proper anti tank equipment, being deployed in an offensive formation, and having no natural defensive barriers in the steppe, the Romanians and Hungarians were forced to pull back to the defensive positions along the Don River. The Germans were surrounded.   It's possible the Germans could have performed a breakthrough and retreat back to the Don, but Hitler personally ordered that Stalingrad would be held and the army would be supplied from the air until the flanks could be reestablished. Obviously, this plan was not feasible and the Germans lost thousands of men to the Russian winter and supply shortages. On February 2, the German sixth army unconditionally surrendered. For the first time, the Russians had the upper hand in the war."

German offensives in Barbarossa usually consisted of heavy bombardment by Luftwaffe or artillery followed by an armoured push by Panzer units. Only then would actual infantry engage to perform the clean up of what was left. In Stalingrad, general Zhukov used the tactic of hugging the enemy (basically keeping the distance between two front lines no more than rock's throw) which caused collateral damage and danger close preventing effective bombardment. What more, in the urban landscape Panzers lost their main advantage which was mobility and with the advent of anti-tank weapons which could be fired by infantry they sustained heavy loses. This meant that foot soldiers had to engage the Soviets in bitter street combat during winter conditions in an unfamiliar city after crossing most of eastern Europe."
AskHistorians,3dv65s,vigil11,8,Sun Jul 19 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"The Tokyo firebombing of March 1945 (Operation Meetinghouse) was one of the most destructive bombing raids in the war. This was because of several factors: 1. it was the first major firebombing raid against Japan, so the Japanese response was not as good as it would be later in the war (in terms of evacuation), 2. Tokyo, with a population of around 6 million, was the 2nd largest city in the world (after New York) with very high population densities, so whatever percentage of destruction or death that would come from such a bombing is being applied to a very large number to begin with, and 3. it was an exceptionally large raid featuring hundreds of B-29s dropping specially-developed napalm and magnesium bombs on a city largely made of wood and paper, which created a massive firestorm.   So one 1960s US government report estimated that the Tokyo raid killed over 80,000 people and injured 120,000. That gives a rate of 11,800 casualties per square mile, and a rate of 5,300 deaths per square mile.  The US then went on to duplicate this tactic against 66 other Japanese cities. However the rates of injury and death were much lower. Why? Because 1. the Japanese got savvy to the tactic and did a better job of evacuating cities when massive numbers of B-29s could be detected (even just heard — they are loud) on the horizon, 2. they also built better firebreaks and did better training for dealing with fire, and 3. the majority of those cities were many many times smaller than Tokyo in terms of population and density.   So that same report says that on an average of 93 other urban attacks, with similar average bomb loads as used in the Tokyo bombing, the number of killed and missing per attack was on average ""only"" 1,850, with ""only' 1,830 injured. That makes the average casualty rate 2,000 per square mile, and the mortality rate 1,000 per square mile. Considerably diminished than the Tokyo raids, though 1,000 dead per square mile is still pretty high in absolute terms. (I live in a city of one square mile and it is hard to imagine what 1,000 corpses would look like here.)  The atomic bombs killed, in absolute terms, on the same order as the Tokyo raid: around 80,000-160,000 for Hiroshima and 40,000-80,000 for Nagasaki, depending on whose figures you go with and how you calculate that. This leads a lot of people to say that the weapons were about the same, in terms of death-dealing, as the firebombing raid of Tokyo. But Tokyo was a city of 6 million, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki were both cities of around a quarter or one-third million each. So the fact that they had similar total death rates means that a much greater percentage of each city was killed. So to use the figures of that original report I cited, Hiroshima had a mortality rate of 15,000 dead per square mile (around 3X Tokyo), and Nagasaki had 20,000 dead per square mile (around 4X Tokyo). The casualty rates were similar multiples higher.   So the atomic bombs were much more deadly than the firebombing. To illustrate this, I have calculated roughly what sorts of deaths you'd expect had the atomic bombs been dropped on Tokyo in March 1945 instead of the firebombing — it is a figure between 2 and 4 times more dead than the incendiary bombings produced.   The one place where the atomic bombs were less destructive is in terms of total city area destroyed. If the definition of ""effective"" is not in civilians dead (which is a pretty grim definition of effectiveness) but is instead in terms of infrastructure destroyed, the atomic bombs understandably do much poorer. This is because the atomic bombs are a single, massive explosion that puts a lot of energy (and deadliness) into one very distinct area. The firebombing spread a much lighter form destructiveness more evenly over the target area. So in some sense, when it comes to destroying buildings, the atomic bombings are wasteful in their distribution of energy, ""over-destroying"" the buildings near ground zero and ""under-destroying"" buildings on the fringe of the blast zone.  To refer, one final time, to that figure I cited earlier, the Tokyo firebombing destroyed some 15.8 square miles of urban area, whereas Hiroshima was ""only"" 4.7 square miles and Nagasaki a paltry 1.8 (Nagasaki's lack of destructiveness in this sense is because it was dropped off-target and into something of a valley, so its explosion was extremely intense within the hills, but areas outside of the hills were somewhat shielded). The average of 93 other urban attacks, though, only destroyed 1.8 square miles (probably because some very small raids are folded into that number, lowering the average).  So, to conclude, there are some real differences between the firebombing raids and the atomic bomb raids, in terms of their ""effectiveness,"" depending on how you define that term. And one should not take Tokyo to be representative of the firebombing raids, either, because it was somewhat exceptional for a variety of operational reasons.   I think when people want to compare the Tokyo raid to the atomic bombings, they mean that it is mostly equivalent in a moral or ethical sense (e.g. the purposeful burning of tens of thousands of civilians as a means to wage war), but sometimes they mistake this for it being phenomenologically equivalent (i.e. the same effects), but there are some key differences. Personally I find it somewhat odd that people seem to think the argument of ""we committed massacres earlier in the war, so it justifies massacres later in the war"" is compelling, rather than disturbing. And I do think that ""massacre,"" however unpleasant it is to say, is appropriate here — these weapons were indiscriminate and brutal, and used to slaughter people, mostly civilians, by the thousands. One can think they were necessary in context, but one should not paper over that uncomfortable fact.  I have written more on this question here, which is also where you can find the citation for that report, among other things."

During the war several SS divisions division were recruited from occupied western Europe. The elite SS ""Wiking"" division (it had 15,000-20,000 men at any given time) for example was recruited from citizens of occupied Norway and the low counties, as well as volunteers from Sweden. The SS ""Nordland"" division was also largely filled by mostly by volunteers from Scandinavian but also included Spanish, French, Estonian and other nationalities. The ""Nederland"" division was composed largely of Dutch volunteers.  Those are just some examples of foreign divisions. The SS also had recruited from Muslim populations in the Balkans, such as Albanians. Himmler also instituted mandatory conscription in the occupied Baltic states like Latvia. All in all there were more than a dozen foreign foreign units in service with the SS.  As the war progressed the Germans even took to recruit captured Soviet PoWs to form anti-Communist Russian divisions. The Wehrmacht also recruited hundreds of thousands of men in occupied Soviet territories as auxiliaries to be used in second line roles, i.e anti-partisan operation and garrisoning duties. Both on the eastern front as well as other theatres of war (i.e Yugoslavia).  Despite the brutality of the Nazis and their racial supremacist ideology, they were able to find collaborators in every single country they occupied.

AskHistorians,3du0ix,soral,4,Sun Jul 19 13:31:13 2015 UTC,"St Andrews was unusual in that between 1552 and 1805 they used rabbits. There was a financial incentive for this, because rabbiting was a huge industry when every part of a rabbit had a use and there was always an increasing supply. This benefitted both the landlords who sold on the rabbits and the commoners who caught them - both received financial rewards - but the golf course would have held little revenue for commoners until tourism as an industry developed as we know it today.  Mass killing the rabbits was legalised in 1805, as the tourist golfer population and their interest in st andrews was rising. Golf itself was being standardised, and rabbits left too many of their own holes in the course to disturb matches. There was a 16 year struggle between the two sides until 1821 when the foundations for an established course were laid out.   Because the golf course is known to be over 500 years old, but rabbits were permitted in 1552, I would assume that rabbits were already being used and permission was granted as it was a difficult practice to curb (as is often the way) but it would otherwise have been livestock, probably sheep. Modern grass maintenance arrived in the mid-victorian era when the basic lawnmower was invented, in 1830, so I would again assumed livestock were used until later in the 18th century when St Andrews would have been able to purchase one.  I was able to find this internet history for quick reading, but the 'definitive history' recommended is St Andrews, The Evolution of the Old Course: The Impact on Golf of Time, Tradition and Technology by Scott MacPherson.

AskHistorians,3dqkio,PandaSymposium,315,Sat Jul 18 14:17:17 2015 UTC,"It depends upon the definition of contribution and necessary. There were about 1.5 million garden allotments and over half of the UK's manual laborers kept a private garden. The Ministry of Food actively encouraged the cultivation and consumption of privately-grown vegetables. Part of this push by the government  was due to the fears of nutritionists that wartime rationing would have a negative impact on the UK's population. The Ministry of Food's campaigns to educate the public on the importance of vegetables and vitamins, leading to a popularization of myths like carrots promote good eyesight. Yet, if one could ignore the pun, these efforts of the government bore fruit. The UK citizens ate an unprecedented amount of vegetables during the war and public awareness of nutrition increased.   The wider impact of Dig for Victory on the war effort was two-fold. The increase in nutrition provided by vegetable supplements helped make the UK's rationing effort more efficient. The increased caloric and nutritional benefit created by private gardens helped make the UK's working population more able to work longer hours without detrimental effects upon total health. Secondly, vegetable gardens helped morale. The rationing of the Ministry of Food was acceptable, but made for a very plain and tedious meals. The fresh produce alleviated some of the monotony of bread and potatoes with very little meat or meager amounts of dairy. UK homemakers became slightly adept during the war at using this fresh produce to create new dishes or ersatz replacements for scarce food luxuries.  One of the most prized and difficult crops for UK gardeners to grow were onions. The U-boat blockade and German occupation of Western Europe had severely cut imports of onions to the UK and the Ministry of Food's attempt to cultivate commercial production of onions through the Vegetable Marketing Company was a failure. Although UK gardeners found it difficult to grow onions, a successful home crop greatly flavored the rationing staples of bread and potatoes.   While the Dig for Victory campaign was not essential for victory, it made the British home front much easier to bear. This was in stark contrast to the Axis powers late in the war, occupied areas, and the USSR, where the private cultivation of food was sometimes a matter of life or death for the civilian population. Wartime pressures in these countries meant that garden plots were essential to prevent starvation or chronic malnutrition. In this sense, the UK gardeners had the relative luxury of gardening which made the pressures of war slightly more bearable.    Source  Collingham, E. M.

AskHistorians,3dqkio,jschooltiger,110,Sat Jul 18 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"They are, but they are susceptible to fungal infections, which tend to be very aggressive. These infection spread quickly too, and since a lot of allotments were very close together, whole communities would have likely lost onion crops.  You can manage this if you keep a careful eye on them, pull up infected onions quickly and destroy them. During that time however, onions were a fairly new crop for most people so the experience wasn't there, also lack of fungicides wouldn't have helped.  Edit: A completely anecdotal story from my Great Grandmother (who lived near Manchester during WW2), the local people got better results growing onions wild but would have to plant lots since the local wildlife took a liking to them."

AskHistorians,3dqkio,FootGoesInMouth,17,Sun Jul 19 01:09:08 2015 UTC,"why wouldn't folks even prefer them to globe onions   I, uh...dunno...? I'm sure there's, like, at least one person out there somewhere who can tell you what the scale of home garden leek production in WW2 England was, or what factors contributed to cultural preference for one vegetable over another vaguely related one, that's a bit too esoteric for me. And besides, leeks and onions are like...well, maybe not apples and oranges, but apples and...uhhh...cherries? My metaphor is breaking down, but you get my point; they're not really the same thing.   Is it because they don't store as well?   I can't directly answer your question, but I can tell you that, yes, onions store much, MUCH better than leeks. Packed in straw (or similar) in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place, onions can keep for a very long time indeed. Hell, under ideal conditions, you can get a solid year out of 'em -- more, even, if we don't care about flavor and quality, and we're simply looking to fend off starvation. Leeks? Meh. A couple of months.   Anyway, it's also worth noting that the incredible variety of vegetables that consumers (and gardeners) have at their disposal now is an unimaginably diverse cornucopia compared to what was readily available to the average gardener 70, or 100 years ago. I've grown up with (or planted myself) gardens that have species alongside one another that are endemic to opposite sides of the planet. This is pretty ""normal"" to us now, but when you think about it, it's really an extraordinary thing. We think nothing of going to a store where within 20 feet of one another, we can find long beans, taro, lychee, broccoli, papaya, marula, tomatoes, et cetera -- all from wildly different parts of the globe. But during WW2, finding all this stuff -- or even just the seeds -- would be pretty rare indeed. My point, then, is that if leeks weren't common in any particular region of the world at that time, it was probably simply because the global trade network wasn't what it is today.  The effect of synthetic, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and fungicides on food crop diversity can not be understated, either."

AskHistorians,3dqkio,Darneil,61,Sun Jul 19 11:57:07 2015 UTC,"I was just reading Wartime Britain by Juliett Gardener and in that there's a chapter that goes in depth about the industrial warfare going on between Britain and Germany during the Battle for Britain. As a side note, I can't remember numeric details so I won't make them up, but if you want them i'll dig the book out and find them.  She mentions the fact that, as you said, the government did a drive to collect scrap metal to make Spitfires (Though never forget the lesser known Hawker Hurricane, which flew in greater numbers during the Battle for Britain, but was built out of the same materials to a different spec) but it was always intended to be a morale booster more than anything. The amount of metal they gathered was simply not enough to make spitfires, and was often the wrong type or simply not usable. What was more of a success was their other idea to collect money to pay for the production.  What they did was offer groups of people to buy Spitfires, and have the privilege of naming them. This actually worked really well. Entire towns pitched in, and places like Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester, all managed to buy a few each, and sometimes had competitions to name them.  Companies also bought them, and you sometimes had spitfires named ""Concrete"" in the air, surrounded by ""Bristol"" or ""Hackney"". Basically, Britain had the metal it needed. It was the money to purchase other materials that was needed most. In fact, during the course of the Battle for Britain, the biggest hit to production was the destruction of the engine factory. They struggled to find a solution that wouldn't take months to achieve until someone had the bright spark of fitting Rolls Royce Merlin engines into the planes, which had the added benefit of having their factories in the north, further from the action."

The real cost was more than double what the cost was said to be for the Spitfire Fund program.   Equally successful [to the campaign of donating pots and pans proposed by Lady Reading on July 10] was the Spitfire Fund, which had begun in Jamaica, where the people of Kingston began raising money for new planes to fight against the Luftwaffe.  Other Dominions caught on to the idea and, recognizing a golden opportunity, Beaverbrook announced that £5000 would buy a Spitfire (in reality it was nearer £12,000) and launched a more formal appeal.  Again, the response was swift and enthusiastic.  Soon there was not a town in Britain that did not have its own Spitfire Fund.  It became a kind of national craze.  Boy Scouts would do jobs to raise money; collections were made in church, in the pub, at work; town mayors launched campaigns, so too did newspapers.  The Durham Miners, for example, raised £10,000 — that was two Spitfires!

AskHistorians,3dqkio,closethird,32,Sun Jul 19 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"Survived, yes I presume so.   First, vegetables and fruit were never rationed. However, they could be scarce and a black market sprung up and they could be sold ""above the [government] fixed price or in greater quantity than was allowed to favoured customers"".   But did the extra produce produced (and in very small part meat also - rabbits and chickens mostly) help? I can't see how not. The nutrients from the fresh fruit and veg produced by allotmenteers as well as from the pleasure gardens that were dug up for veg gardens I'm sure helped take the edge off some peoples' hunger.  Officially, the programs were declared a success, over and over. But a lot of the figures that were reported at the time to back this up seem a bit suspect. ""After the 1942-3 season, a gardening paper calculated that almost 1,000,000 tons of vegetables had been produced on allotments, which is rather more than half a ton per allotment. In the light of the Ministry's findings, this seems unlikely"". The Dig for Victory campaign itself had only a small effect. Of the 55.2% of households that grew veg during a 1942 survey, only 16% of those with a allotment attributed their lease to the publicity campaign. ""According to The Gardener's Chronicle, in December 1944 the annual value of produce [on allotments] was, apparently, £17,250,000. This cannot possibly have been accurately calculated"".   For all the great anecdotal stories told in the papers of the time and the staying power the phrase has, gardening did not much reduce the purchase of commercial fruit and veg. ""The surveyors measured the number of ounces of various vegetables eaten by each person in a week. With the exception of potatoes, cabbages and rhubarb, there was no very great difference in the amount that gardeners and non-gardeners bought in the shops"".   It seems the British were using these programs and their ""results"" in part, as propaganda. There may not have been deliberate misleading of the public, but less-than-impressive survey results were not made public, and media of the time did all it could to present itself as patriotic, so the ""records"" are definitely biased.  That is not to say that some individuals didn't believe that they were contributing to the war effort. The idea was that the more that could be produced and consumed in the country, the more that would be able to be sent to the boys on the war front. As buying habits showed, this was mostly not true.  In addition, since the government did not seem to think beyond encouraging people to grow food, there was some wastage. Especially when people planted what they liked instead of following the recommended crops and cropping timetables. Imagine the inevitable pile of courgettes (zuccini) that cannot all be eaten nor given away. This was especially so because inexperienced gardeners were being encouraged to take up he spade. And the allure of growing cabbage for the wintertime is not the same as growing some nice lettuce for right now. Even though the government released informational brochures to try to address this issue, the impact was minor.  There are some reliable figures for a related government encouraged activity: jam making. The Ministry of Agriculture organized the WI to process a glut of plums in 1940 into jam for the British sweet tooth. They did so with 1,631 tons of the fruit. This in times when sugar was heavily rationed. The impressive numbers continued throughout the war. In 1941 they made 1,630 tons of preserve. Only in 1945 with a late spring frost did the number of canning locations finally begin to drop. From 1940-1945 more than 5,300 tons of fruit (~12 million lbs) of fruit was preserved. However, all this work accounted for ""less than 0.5% of the national requirement for (rationed) jam in the wartime, so the effort was largely symbolic"".  The numbers in the long run are especially telling. The roughly 1.75 million wartime allotments dropped by a half million by 1947 even though rationing was still pretty intense (the potato wasn't even rationed until 1947 and bread was rationed until 1948). The advantage of growing your own could not have been that strong to see such a drop off.  One of the long term effects of the government programs to consider is that Ribena was issued to children to make up for vitamin C lost because citrus fruits were no longer readily available. That certainly helped cement its place in the culture for years, at least until the GSK scandal of 2004-2007. But Ribena probably did not help win the war.  General impressions and all quotes are from ""A Green and Pleasant Land: How England's Gardeners Fought the Second World War"" by Ursula Buchan."

I'm interested in Slavic folklore (due to that being what I was mostly exposed to growing up), but a friend is studying Medieval Cornish folklore and folktales so I can recommend some books about that as well."
AskHistorians,3duzsa,TheFairyGuineaPig,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:26:07 2015 UTC,Well anything goes really! My main interest was Slavic folklore as well but I'll gladly read anything concerning folklore.
AskHistorians,3duzsa,TheFairyGuineaPig,2,Sun Jul 19 19:34:12 2015 UTC,"Great! I can reccomend Russian Folk Belief (Linda Ivanits); Baba Yaga: The Ambiguous Mother and Witch of Russian Folktale, Andreas John; Mother Russia: The Feminine Myth in Russian Culture, Joanna Hubbs; Giants, Monsters and Dragons, Carol Rose; Land of the Firebird, Suzanne Maisie; An Introduction to the Russian Folktale, Jack Haney; By Any Other Name: An Overview of the Russian Fairy Tale in the Fantastic Tradition of the East and West, Helen Pilinovsky; Polish Customs, Traditions, & Folklore, Sophie Hodorwicz Knab; Russian Magic, Cherry Gilchrist; Encylopaedia of Russian and Slavic Myth and Legend, Mike Dixon-Kennedy; Slavic Folklore: A Handbook, Natalie Kononenko.  Also, the book I'm reading right now, is an Alaskan folk tale- Two Old Women, by Velma Wallis. It is very fascinating and interesting, the book itself is beautiful, as well. The story is moving, gripping and passed down from parents to children. It's one of the best folktale books I've read. And, on a complete whim, I bought, not long ago, Fairy and Folktales of the Irish Peasantry, free on Kindle, which I would also reccomend."

Ancient Egyptian weightlifting with stones and bags (presumably filled with stones or sand) is shown in the tomb of Prince Baghti III and at the Beni Hassan burial site (both from around 2000 BC). A quick google search shows various people claiming much older dates for ancient Chinese weightlifting, but I can't find anyone who provides specifics."

Retreats like that following the Michael Offensive, and most major events in general, were hard to hide, so that information was available as well.  Much of the info civilians would have received came from newspapers and cinemas.  The German press put the best possible spin on defeats like the Somme and 3rd Ypres, while the British avoided the gory details of the 1st of July 1916 (though I wouldn't consider that a defeat per se)."

AskHistorians,3dudse,DuxBelisarius,3,Sun Jul 19 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"Essentially yes, although in the case of Gallipoli some of the scale was obscured, but that changed thanks to the efforts of pressmen like Keith Murdoch. There was no hiding the retreat of the Fifth Army, and if anything it became a '1940 moment in 1918', with the population rallying to the cause now that the BEF was under threat."
AskHistorians,3dudse,Spark_77,0,Sun Jul 19 18:17:46 2015 UTC,"In the UK at least there was a huge amount of propaganda both as the war started and as it progressed. Going to war and serving your country was portrayed as gallant and noble. The famous poster of Lord Kitchener with the slogan ""Britons: <Lord Kitchener> needs you!"" and the many other posters inspired many, indeed many underage boys lied about their age to join the army.  For those who signed up it was a big adventure - they all believed they'd be home by Christmas after giving the dammed Germans ""a jolly good hiding"". They couldn't have been more wrong.  Even in Church the public were told by their clergy how proud they should be of their husbands and sons going to fight the Germans, who were portrayed as evil and bad.  No-one could even imagine the horrors that the men were to face.  It would appear that it was much the same in Germany, I found this article that shows Germans celebrating the outbreak of war: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-three/10417056/world-war-one-propaganda.html  I'm unsure of the German side but certainly in the UK the media was controlled and encouraged to print propaganda as fact, even make up stories to demonise the Germans. See http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/27/first-world-war-state-press-reporting  Of course, letters home were censored, but eventually the public came to learn about the awful experiences the men had. Men who had suffered terrible physical injury arrived home to their families. Many had been gassed and were terribly unwell. Some had been blown up and had awful disfiguring injuries. There were also men who suffered terrible shell shock - unable to remain still, stuttering speech, unable to fend for themselves they were completely broken.  Also, news reels made it home and people flocked to cinemas to see them. Some were acted out, but others showed actual battle and wounded men, these were shocking scenes for the public, but the worst was of course hidden. Later on the poetry from men like Wilfred Owen, Robert Binyon and Siegfried Sassoon told the real story of the trenches. Conscription was introduced in 1916, simply because not enough men were signing up. It caused a drop in support for the war and there were huge demonstrations, but nevertheless, it was vital to have more men in service."

Considering the millions of different posters and messages produced during the war, it seems odd to single out this one, just because it became 'iconic' to later generations.   For those who signed up it was a big adventure - they all believed they'd be home by Christmas after giving the dammed Germans ""a jolly good hiding"". They couldn't have been more wrong.   This is blatantly false; examination of primary sources from the time by social historians, including diaries, letters and newspapers, has turned up no evidence that 'Over by Christmas' was ever a widely held belief. According to historian Adrian Gregory, the quote seems to have come up in later years, precisely to lampoon that kind of optimism. As for the 'rush to the colours' I'll leave this short lecture by Catriona Pennell. The initial rush of recruiting really wasn't that big, compared to the first week of September. Moreover, most volunteers in general were actually turned back, because the recruiting system couldn't handle the pressure. I'm not denying that underage soldiers enlisted, they did, but large numbers were discharged, and it shouldn't be said that the Army did nothing to prevent them from entering the ranks.   Even in Church the public were told by their clergy how proud they should be of their husbands and sons going to fight the Germans, who were portrayed as evil and bad   Although there was support in the churches for the war effort, there were substantial numbers of clergy and laity who dissented on religious grounds, and still more who supported their country out of patriotic reasons, and didn't need to be convinced that the 'hun was evil' just to fight for or support their country. In general, positive propaganda (ie 'dig for victory', 'HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE', 'join insert factory here') was more successful and garnered more response than 'EVIL HUN IS EVIL!!!'.   No-one could even imagine the horrors that the men were to face   This is at least right to an extent, but there was substantial anti-war activity in Britain especially, and throughout Europe at the breakout. People like Norman Angell, Ivan Bloch, Andrea Suttner, and even military figures like Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz had written extensively about how future wars would likely be bloody, drawn out struggles, and there were of course the recent examples of the Second Anglo-Boer War, the Russo-Japanese War, the Italo-Turkish War, and the Balkan Wars.   It would appear that it was much the same in Germany, I found this article that shows Germans celebrating the outbreak of war   Alexander Watson has written a history of the Central Powers in WWI, called Ring of Steel; Paul Verhey has written The Spirit of 1914: the Myth of War Enthusiasm amongst the German Working Class; and there are numerous other publications in English and German to be found that cover the outbreak of war. It would seem that, as in Britain, the war was greeted by the bulk of the German population with foreboding, anxiety, and confusion. Any feelings of patriotism seemed to be directed towards 'defending the fatherland' from 'Tsarist Despotism'.   I'm unsure of the German side but certainly in the UK the media was controlled and encouraged to print propaganda as fact, even make up stories to demonise the Germans   In Germany, especially from September 1916 onwards under the Hindenburg/Ludendorff Junta, the press was heavily censored. In Britain however, while the press worked closely with the government often, and did rely on it for some information, people like Northcliffe were by and large free to print their own stories, though inevitably some were not entirely truthful. The government never went without criticism in the war, and the efforts of pressmen like Repington, Keith Murdoch, Max Aitken, and even Winston Churchill are testimony to that fact."
AskHistorians,3dudse,DuxBelisarius,4,Sun Jul 19 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"Continued   Of course, letters home were censored, but eventually the public came to learn about the awful experiences the men had   Although letters were censored, families and soldiers developed sophisticated means of communicating, often through code, in letters. Letters from home informed civilians what life was like on the frontlines as best they could, while also being vital to the morale of the soldiers. There was, inevitably a gap in war experiences between the homefront and battle front, but the idea of the civilians being utterly clueless and disregarding soldiers is a myth. In Britain at least, the sacrifices made by everyone at home were always below those of the soldiers, whose sacrifice the civilians were constantly reminded they could never hope to repay.   Later on the poetry from men like Wilfred Owen, Robert Binyon and Siegfried Sassoon told the real story of the trenches   What do you mean, 'later on'? There was poetry pouring out of the trenches almost from day one, from numerous poets with different views on the war. Most have, of course, been removed from popular memory in favour of the 'poetry of disillusion', but I can assure you there was plenty of disillusion even before 1916. Rupert Brooke is not the 'be all end all' of 'pre-Somme' poets, nor are Owen and co the 'be all end all' of 'post-Somme' poets.   Conscription was introduced in 1916, simply because not enough men were signing up   This much is true, but it also had to do with compulsion under the Derby Plan not working, and a need to allocate manpower more efficiently between industry and the military. Many conscripts could say, with some vindication, that they would have volunteered, but that conscription made that choice for them.    It caused a drop in support for the war and there were huge demonstrations   Considering that 1916 was the year that the war really 'came home' for the UK, I wouldn't say that it caused a 'huge' drop in support. Heck, just the fact that now virtually the whole country was committed to the war effort meant that people drew closer, and British industry came into it's own in 1916."

Again, watch Pennell's lecture. In this case, British men were presented with a threat to their homes and country if the BEF was crushed, and made a decision to enlist and avoid this outcome. These were not 'blind rushes to the colours', these were cases of men settling their accounts, discussing with their families and employers, and making a non-emotional decision to fight. Kitchener's divisions wouldn't be ready until early 1915 at least, so tell me, why would the British call up those forces AND settle in for a lengthy naval blockade, when apparently the war was going to 'be over by Christmas'?"
