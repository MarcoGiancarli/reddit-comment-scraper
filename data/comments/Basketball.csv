Basketball,3e57uy,raiszx,3,Wed Jul 22 01:27:28 2015 UTC,It all depends on who you're playing. If you're stronger than them back them down and get the easy bucket. If you're faster blow past them and get the easy bucket. If you're neither develop a sweet step back game. If you can hit a couple step backs then you fake a step back and go in for the easy basket.

I'm 5'8"" as an adult and was 5'4"" to 5'7"" in highschool when I played the most and I often ended up guarding taller guys.   Try to deny your man the ball with crazy, swarming defense when he's posting. I push into my man's back and he starts pushing back, calling for the ball. If you time it right then you suddenly stop pushing and he moves backwards as the ball is passed to him and you get around him and grab it out of the air. If the guy you are guarding or the guard are smart, then they won't let this happen more than once. Then you start looking out for lobs.  Look for strips and keep a hand in his face when he turns. It will help a ton if you are better conditioned than your man. In my experience defense is all about reducing the opposing team's options and increasing the difficulty of their passes and shots. If you can deny certain kinds of passes then you've reduced their options. If your hand is constantly in his face and threatening a strip or a block then you are forcing tougher shots and dropping your man's percentages."

Basketball,3dxa7t,Clavo_PR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:11:42 2015 UTC,"Best thing is to try and strip the ball and harry the pass in and the dribbling. Try to double team the player, or if you're strong, don't give any ground. Most tall players' dribbling and mid range shooting is weak so if you make sure they get the ball outside the key and need to dribble to take it in, you've improved your chances significantly.   I'm 190cm and some shorter players (not a whole foot shorter though) cause me problems when they do the above. They do kind of foul me, but I just play pickup so I don't call them.  If you're a dick, foul guaranteed baskets and let them regain possession or free throws. I get pushed back a lot, so I have a half decent fadeaway developed now haha."

Basketball,3duhvt,SuminderJi,2,Tue Jul 21 01:28:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah not much to say that hasn't already been said. Looking great at 13, nice handles and skills.  However, his shooting form could use some work (though frankly many people get away with far worse form): he's going to want to get those legs into it and put more arc into the shot, as well as fix the rhythm of it.  The other thing I really want to emphasize is the ""slow feet"" issue.  chiefff put it very well, saying ""he is still growing into his body,"" and I think (at least from this video) that his feet seem pretty heavy on the court. SchaafC mentioned incorporating plyometrics into the workouts, and I think general agility exercises would also go a long way.  A final note about further practice: he's 13 years old, so I'm not criticizing him for this, but there should be more hustle between shots in practice.  Keeping his knees bent as he catches the ball so he can go right into his shot is a great habit to form, and generally staying low as he goes between from one spot to the next (and sprinting!) is also important.  No reason to watch your shot if you've got someone else to get the rebound and feed you the next ball.  Overall, I'd say his skills are pretty sharp (especially at 13), but, looking to the future, the important things are forming good habits (this is invaluable), developing a strong basketball IQ, and making the most of the body he's growing into."

Basketball,3djoic,jamez217,2,Fri Jul 17 01:22:03 2015 UTC,I always see more problems with both knees not coming down evenly in practice jump shots. It leads to a lean and then trying to adjust the shot off of what the lean skewed which messes up the catch and shoot aspects and the shoot off dribble from mid range.
Basketball,3djoic,mygingersoul,3,Fri Jul 17 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely agree keep your legs even, I meant adjust the depth of the squat when you're shooting. Deeper squats giving more length, lesser ones giving less length."

Basketball,3djoic,jamez217,2,Fri Jul 17 04:01:39 2015 UTC,"My advice. Don't focus on hand mechanics. all I look to do when i shoot is set my feet(make sure shoulders are aligned with rim, one foot slightly in front of the other), follow through(make a gooseneck when you shoot, don't shoot at the rim but above it and into it) and get a good arc on my shot(think dirks shot not kobes). if you think too much you'll miss everytime. limit the things you think about and let it go. watch shotscience videos on youtube(they really helped me when I was younger)"
Basketball,3djoic,FupeLiasco23,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:25:22 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be to do the same thing you described, but totally remove your off-hand. And get lots of reps in, like LOTS. Then once you get a steady stroke, add in the off hand and you should not notice it effecting your shot. When I was in high school we took upwards of 500 shots a day. Now, I am addicted to seeing the ball go through the rim. I think I have a pretty good stroke, here is a youtube video that you could use to model your shot:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9sHJLtT7U4  Then once you get comfortable and start making shots consistently, start shooting off the dribble and catch and shoot situations."

Basketball,3daaw9,volleycoach89,4,Tue Jul 14 18:52:15 2015 UTC,"Just being honest, but this is a pipe dream. You haven't played organized basketball since your Sophomore year of high school (about 9 years ago). There's no way you've received the proper coaching in the last 9 years (or prior even) to make a career out of basketball. I'm not even just talking skill-wise, but also X's and O's. You'd be drastically behind, and at the age of 25 (which is kind of old for a player nowadays).  However, if you're seriously committed, and somehow I'm wrong and you'll have an ESPN 30 for 30 on you in the near future, you should check out D-League tryouts. D-League teams usually hold an open tryout once a year for an entrance fee of about $500. I'd also look at player agencies. Perhaps some agent can brainwash a low-level European league coach into taking a chance on you.  I don't mean to shit on you, but the odds are INSANELY low. The odds are low for a kid who has trained his whole life from the age of 4, much less a 25 year old guy with 2 years of high school playing experience.

Basketball,3d1jwk,ILoveChickeeen,7,Sun Jul 12 19:37:08 2015 UTC,"The thing about crossing someone over, that I've come to learn, is that no matter how many moves you learn, they won't be effectice unless you now how to sell them to your defender. Crossing someone over is just as much a psychological game as it is a game of speed and agility. You gotta get your defender thinking you're gunna go the opposite direction. Two things that go into this are (if you can) selling that you're going one way before you get to your defender and using your chest to do this. First off,a crossover is going to be much harder to effectively pull off when you're a step away from your defender then it will be when you're 3+ steps away from your defender. Using your chest can be a lot more effective than you think. When I play defense, I always watch my defenders chest, 90% of the time they will go in the direction their chest points. One of my favorite crossovers is the between the legs to change of direction that the old Tim Hardaway used when he was in the NBA. The between the legs to, let's say the right, makes your defender believe that you are going to your right (cause that's what people usually do when they go between the legs) but you also point your chest to the right and your defender will firmly believe you're going right. Then when you change to the left you'll have em beat. So no matter what you do the direction you point your chest in will help alot."
Basketball,3d1jwk,F1Yafghan,8,Sun Jul 12 20:55:26 2015 UTC,"Inside-out crossover. Left to right cross over. Right to left cross over.   My favorite I do a left to right crossover attack right hard when they body you up, throw it behind your back and take a step back jump shot."

Basketball,3d1jwk,wavecrasher59,4,Mon Jul 13 03:54:37 2015 UTC,Obviously your choice of crossover you develop belongs in every players repertoire. But I would also recommend the Kobe Pivot. I find most pickup players are suckers for it since too many over focus on flashy moves and don't think they can be beat by simple sound mechanics.  The link shows a tutorial (not made by me) but what it leaves out is there is a choice. If on the jump-stop-fake the defender doesn't leave his feat you can just go ahead and take the shot against a flat footed defender. From the high post where this move is usually played that should be a high percentage make for you. And of course if he does as the move is designed to do you have the uncontested finger roll.
Basketball,3d1jwk,thekingearl,2,Mon Jul 13 00:36:15 2015 UTC,"The trick to 1v1 is to beat your opponent before you dribble. This requires a well-rounded skills to keep your defender guessing.  From the triple-threat position, you gotta fake your opponent to a disadvantage.  They call it triple threat because you can shoot, pass, or drive (dribble) swiftly.  Its cat vs mouse.  The point of the shotfake is to get the defender off his feet or upright, which opens up your drive.  Alternatively, the jab fake lowers your defender making him move to the side and away from you to guard against the drive.  This opens up your shot.  Pass fakes are a 3rd option but if you're playing straight up 1v1 its not really a believable fake.  If your game isn't round enough, then your defender will cheat, meaning the defender won't bite on your fakes.  If you suck at shooting, I will let you shoot because I already have position for the rebound and vice-versa.  Jab step, two things will either happen, he bites or he doesn't.  If he bites, you have room to shoot.  Or better yet, shot fake, because the defender will be recovering and might leave his feet in desperation, then you can saunter in for a layup.  Alternatively, jab step, opponent doesn't move, you can extend your jab step and get behind your opponent's lead foot and get that ""first step"" you're passed him already before you dribble.  The defender has to shift his stance and play immediate catch up because you've already beaten him.  The worst thing you can do in 1v1 is dribble right away.  All the dribble moves in the world are easier to check than the triple threat.  Learn to shoot off the dribble.  I made a living off of mid-range jumpers.  3-4 dribbles max.  Any more than that and you are doing it wrong.  Ambidexterity is key.  If you only have a right hand I will force you left.  Follow your shots.  Offensive rebounds in 1v1 will give you a second chance.  In terms of dribbling moves, inside-out (fake crossover) crossover (through legs, behind back) are your best weapons to keep your opponent guessing.  Back to the basket and post moves if you have a size advantage is like fishing with dynamite"

Basketball,3d1jwk,mrpwnification,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:41:44 2015 UTC,"like chiefff said, simple crossover moves. And if they don't free you up for a layup, they'll at least let you get close enough to deploy some simple up-and-under/step-through fakes in the post, once you've picked your dribble up.   I'm also a fan of an inside out cross over then on the step out of it, crossing back to your off hand. Also, a solid first step and first dribble can set up a spin move very fluently."
Basketball,3d1jwk,abrooks1125,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:23:50 2015 UTC,"Cross over moves are great and you should have good handle. however learn how to come off a screen properly. Come off the screen tight, no gap between you and your team mate. Leaving the defender no choice but to either go around your team mate giving you a wide open pull up) or switch with his team mate (most likely giving you lane to the basket."
Basketball,3d1jwk,enjoyit7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:12:05 2015 UTC,"You have to practice this going full speed or else you'll fake yourself out.  Get a head of steam going straight at your defender, and when you get close to him, go hard inside-out dribble straight into a crossover.  So, if you think about that in your head (if you're right handed, if left just reverse this), you've got right-left, right-left.  It's a lot of change of direction, and if they're back pedaling, it's almost impossible to stay in front of you.  The crossover can lead to a jumper (that will likely be uncontested) or a drive to the basket."

Basketball,3cyisx,Instantcoffees,3,Sat Jul 11 23:40:03 2015 UTC,"That's really skinny, but it shouldn't be THAT much of a problem at your age. I didn't weigh much more at your age and I had to play all the time. Even played with two teams seperate teams, one being with older players. Being skinny doesn't have to mean that you are weak. I used my speed, limberness and jumping strength to do well.  It will mostly become a problem once you get into the older categories. I'd say that from around 17 it will become more of an issue. If you're good, most coaches will want to beef you up by age 17 or 18. I've only started filling out a bit in my late twenties, but that never stopped me from playing well. It helps if you go to the gym or atleast try to build up some muscle, just don't overdo it if you are still growing. You are 15, you're not supposed to have the body of a man yet.  You will probably have more injuries though, so be careful. Good luck!"

Really, being that undersized means you could get pushed around, but if you are out on the perimeter, it would be less on an issue.  Honestly, learn to shoot. Most people can't shoot. It's a skill coaches kill for. Really, it requires the least amount of raw talent, the most amount of work and it's the best way to gain a skill that most players don't have.

Being skinny sometimes has it's advantages too, especially if you're bony, but strong, being able to move hard and fast sometimes works well with being skinny, especially in most highschool leagues where some kids are still afraid of getting hurt.  Fighting me for the rebound will hurt you because my elbows are pretty sharp (Haha), and if you fail at stealing/blocking, you'll feel my bones leave love taps on ye.  EDIT: Remember though, if you're tall, you're probably expected to play low, if you can fight for the rebound, being skinny can be okay, but that means you'll have to be really low a lot of the time to help you box out and push against other rebounders. If you can't fight thicker guys, then it's pretty bad, building up some weight is a good idea, but in some cases it's not necessary."

Basketball,3cr23g,FoldableClock,5,Fri Jul 10 02:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, the lower the better is usually the case for any player.

Practice it every day. If it's a mini-hook, spin move, or back down, whatever. Figure out your best one now, and make it even better. Watch YouTube videos, post videos here on reddit, talk to coaches, play pick-up games to practice it, and just keep working at it. Don't worry about fixing everything else or becoming well-rounded just yet. In basketball, once you can do one thing very well, you can do everything well.   There's also the option of talking to your coach about playing the 3 position. Make sure you can back up that decision with your play though if he pulls the trigger."
Basketball,3clr6l,_FlyGuy,4,Thu Jul 9 06:12:20 2015 UTC,"Run to where you want to be, and if the defense gets the position first don't be afraid to move. Make sure the defense is reacting to you. Not the other way around.   When you get the ball, what are you going to do with it? Work on a good turn around mini hook, or work on making a quick spin effectively. Dribble towards the center, and if the defense collapses on you kick the ball out. If not, make them pay with a pull-up jump shot from 4 ft away.   Hope this helps!"
Basketball,3clr6l,BCboneless,2,Thu Jul 9 00:35:13 2015 UTC,I agree with the other guy whole heartedly but ultimately I'd talk to the coach about playing comfortably at the 3 spot. Sure go into the post every now and again but if you feel most comfortable at the three then that's what you should play. If the coach doesn't feel that way even after you proved you can handle your own I'd look for a different team to play for.

For example a jump hook and the counter is an up and under. That's all you need, 2 moves to be a great post player.   I'd work more on pivoting (inside/outside) and getting the ball in to what I'd call power position. If you're able to pivot and face the basket that can be very effective for the rest of your team to get open for baskets and you wouldn't have done a thing other than pivot.   (all this stuff is easily youtubeable). Focus on doing less first is my advice. Become a great pivoter/screener and play good defense is very effective for a big."

If your coach puts you there it's because he doesn't think you have enough talent at the wing position to play it.  90% of the time the 3 position is the most dynamic scorer on the court.  What can you do that will make your coach think that you are the most dynamic?  Can you take people off the dribble and shoot a mid-long range jumpshot?  If not then practice your ass off until you can and sit your coach down and say, ""Coach, I've really been working hard at these areas of my game and I want a chance to play the 3.""  Be sure you know everything about the position, if you have set plays, know where the 3 goes.  As a 3, you'll be asked to take mismatches down to the post from time to time, so you need to work on your footwork and confidence in the post.  It's about feeling where the player is until you catch him out of position or overplaying a side and capitalize on it with a big power finish.

One thing a lot of people don't realise is that its perfectly possible to use wing skills in the post (and in a lot of cases easier). I'm fairly similar to you and when I play inside I almost exclusively catch and then face up. I now have a triple threat situation close to the basket against a defender who most likely isn't used to being in that situation. From here I can use all the skills I got from being a 3, I can shoot over him blow by him find cutting team mates etc etc. Just because you're playing inside doesn't mean you have to play in a back to the basket style. Can also do a lot of other things from typical roles that a big plays like pick and pop, slip the screen etc. Also don't be afraid to make cuts often in the post defenders overplay a lot so if you're smart you can get some nice backdoor cuts to work. Hope this helps."
Basketball,3clr6l,samb1234,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"Have a go-to move and a counter at both blocks. For example, have a primary move pivoting into the lane, such as a jump hook. Once you hit that or the defense starts taking it away, pivot the opposite way, in this case baseline, and use a different move such as a drop step or an up and under. Use fakes. A simple pump fake in the paint is sometimes all you need to get your defender airborne, and from there you can go straight up and draw the foul, pivot around him, etc... As others have said, good positioning is important. Beat your man to the block, keep a wide stance, and know what you want to do when you catch the pass from the wing. Get crafty/scrappy. Don't be afraid to play physical, back guys down, use pump fakes to draw hard fouls, fight for positioning etc..."

Basketball,3ccsm5,300guccisquad,0,Tue Jul 7 21:38:03 2015 UTC,It was probably ruled a tip (or tap) versus a shot attempt. The rationale is that Lopez did not have control over the tip and could thus get the rebound (though technically it shouldn't be counted a rebound because it was not a shot attempt).

There should be a lot of movement when you have them on and they should stretch out very much. Change your socks more frequently.  If your feet sweat a lot swap socks between games. Foot powder.  I always thought foot powder was old men until I got a free sample of Gold Bond and tried it out.  Great stuff.

It's basically an alcohol solvent that slowly dissolves the rubber of the sole. If you use it once, then you have to keep using it sort of like lip balm.  The only that would work is a towel or other material and just wiping your shoes off. I've seen products that are like sticky mats that you put on the soles and they just grab dirt and rocks off."

Basketball,3brjmt,wanl55,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:18:04 2015 UTC,"I don't play, but I watch A LOT, and I have MANY opinions. 1. Hustle 2. Act as if every drill, every practice, every play is the most important thing for your team. If your teammates see that level of focus and commitment then they will up their focus as well and the whole team is automatically better with you on the floor with them. 3. Hustle into space. Take your defender with you. Punish your defender if he doesn't cover you by making the shot or by making a good pass. Moving into open space and taking your defender with you opens up passing lanes for easy plays and makes the defense work harder. 4. Practice moves that create space for your shot. You're likely shorter than your defender, so have a quick first step! That way if he gets too close you can blow past him and if he backs up too much it opens space for you to shoot! 5. Defend like crazy. Never give your guy space. Always irritate him and keep him off balance. Never let him be comfortable. Though sometimes players get complacent and lazy, so let sleeping dogs lie, in that case. Be aware that good shooters practice shooting from spots. They will try to distract you with moves and fakes that serve mostly just to get them to a spot they are comfortable shooting from. Learn that spot and then keep them from getting to it.  6. Hustle 7. Hustle again. 8. Just keep hustling, and always act like you care soo much and you resent anyone wasting your time."

Generally it's possible to get citizenship in such cases but I highly doubt you would qualify.   First of all, Iran's national team is ranked 17th in the world and won Silver in last year's Asia games. Their team leader is/was playing in the NBA, can't recall his name. The point is those guys are pros. For you to get nationalized you would need to have their basketball association to notice you, i.e. being an all-star in Iranian league, or similar. If you directly go to them saying you have Iranian blood and want to play for the national - you better be NBA caliber player at least to have their interest. Even then, I have a feeling Iran might have stricter laws when it comes to nationalization (religion might play part in it), so it's not an easy shot either way.   I have a funny story. I was playing with a guy from Brunei in the university, he was alright but didn't make a school team or anything, just a decent casual player. Turns out he plays for the national team! Basketball isn't big in Brunei, and making a national team isn't difficult. I am guessing you were expecting for a similar opportunity in Iran?"

Now every year there are, say, 50 guys capable of opening the doors to the NBA from college. How many guys there are in his generation high-school basketball? I dunno. But let's say 10,000. That gives you a 0.005 percent chance of making the NBA.

I understand there are not a lot of NBA level talents posting here. However, the Iranian league talent is not ""NBA entry level."" How do I know this? There is not a single basketball player from Iran in the NBA. So clearly, the Iranian league does not require NBA level talent. While it's still a rare chance he's good enough to play there, simply telling him he's not good enough before you've met him or seen him play is petty and is a clear projection of your own insecurities.  You should think before talking, kiddo. Cute downvote."

If you did some research, or just read what the guy below in this thread wrote, they do have NBA level players and their leader did play in the NBA 2004-2012~. In order for them to pick you up and nationalize you, being their level won't be enough. Being exceptionally good (NBA level, I repeat) will net you a chance (if not forbidden by laws) to get nationalized.

As you say now, if he was NBA level player he wouldn't post here, which is true, hence my conclusion -  He Is Not NBA Level Player And I Highly Doubt He Would Qualify For Iranian National Basketball Team.

Basketball,3bq6hz,wertexx,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:59:45 2015 UTC,That is simply not a fact. That would mean there are zero Iranian-American players in the Iranian team because they would all go to the NBA instead.   You cannot conclude that someone isn't an NBA or professional level player if you have never seen them play. It's not likely but it's also not impossible.  Calling me a dumb ass and a middle schooler is childish.

Country will never simply give out a nationality to a guy who is the same level as most local players. Why would they? Rather pick a local guy. In these cases when they naturalize player, the only players that are picked are:  1) Known all-star foreigners who play in the local league (OP never played in Iran)  2) Foreigners who did exceptionally well in highest European leagues WHEN the position they need has no local talent  3) (can't think more from top of my head) if you come from out of nowhere and state that you want to play for the Iranian national team - YOU.

Basketball,3bp29h,lukedees,5,Wed Jul 1 00:09:59 2015 UTC,"I read an article about Jerry West, who is one of the best basketball players--ever--and was the GM of the Lakers when they were good and was an assistant with warriors, recommending that they draft klay Thompson, trade for bogut, not trade klay for kevin love, and other stuff. He's also the NBA Logo. Anyway, here's a quote from the article explaining how he helped Harrison Barnes shoot better. It has a few sketches of drills you can do:  ""With Boylan helping, West then led Barnes through a series of drills. He warmed him up with 10 bank shots, in West’s estimation the easiest way to determine if a shooter’s release is drifting left or right. Boylan had never seen this approach—he was always taught to start close, goose-necking the ball with one hand—but as he says, “Jerry said bank shots and he could shoot the s--t out of it, so we listened.” Explains West: “A shot is a lever, it’s all it is. You don’t open a car door differently each time. A car door is efficient—it opens and closes. So is a shot.”  To improve Barnes’s shot, West had him shoot 10 free throws with virtually no arc, then 10 with normal arc, then 10 with exaggerated arc. To encourage innate decisions, West had Boylan close out on Barnes repeatedly, mixing up his angle each time and forcing Barnes to react rather than think. West showed Barnes how to fall away in the post rather than lean in when turning to the middle (“he was making himself smaller”). And, most important in Barnes’s mind, West changed the way he attacked the basket. Rather than gliding in to finish, West harped on Barnes to take shorter, more explosive steps. To finish up, not out. To climb an imaginary ladder. Once Barnes got to the rim, West wanted him shooting the ball underhand. Barnes resisted. “I said, ‘Jerry, I shoot my shots overhand.’ He said that’s why you’re always clanking your layups off the rim. You have no touch. You have to get used to finishing underhanded, with spin on it.”"

I'll shoot jump hook banks from point blank for a few reps, then shuffle out to just outside the block for few, then close again at a different angle, sometimes alternating between banks and straight net.  High off the glass.  Low off the glass.  Tons of variety.  All while keeping a good pace...hands high for rebounds, keep the ball high as much as possible.

Your balance seems to be fine, and, as much as I can tell, you're not leaning back or to a side, which is good.  Yea, you are kind've ""cocking"" the ball.  Part of it is because you appear to be releasing the ball on the way down, which means you've lost momentum causing you to have to force the ball up.  If you work on releasing the ball on the way up or at the very top of your jump, you can use the momentum from your jump, and you shouldn't have to cock the ball like that.  Try to not take the ball back behind your shoulder. Creates a lot of room for error."

Can't tell from the angle of the video, but my problem was mostly due to my elbow pushing out to the side.  When my elbow wasn't locked in a vertical plane (moving up and down in a straight line), my shooting hand would tend to dip more, creating the ""cocking"" motion and adding a short pause in my shot that totally killed my momentum.  Shot looks great though, man!"
Basketball,3boh9i,yangstalicious,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input man. The only problem I have with holding my elbow in is that it stresses my right shoulder and feels really comfortable (probably due to lack of flexibility).

Basketball,3boh9i,wlawson1024,2,Mon Jul 6 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"It's a little hard to tell but it looks like you might be cocking the ball back a little bit when you raise it over your head and then you shoot it. If this is the case, it would slow your release down slightly and also makes it a little harder to be consistent as your shooting motion is actually 2 motions."

Basketball,3bedkg,pumpyourbrakeskid,2,Sun Jun 28 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. But it doesn't mean that there are going to be anymore players. I mean, China has a good pro basketball scene (better than India obviously), but still there's no Chinese players in the NBA if I am not mistaken."
Basketball,3bedkg,hakuna_matata23,3,Sun Jun 28 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"Yi Jianlian was a huge prospect. He didn't pan out, but because of Yao there was a ton of attention put on Chinese ballers. Also, since then, many american pros have gone to China to play. I fail to see how this is a net negative for Indian basketball."
Basketball,3bedkg,pumpyourbrakeskid,2,Sun Jun 28 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"He is saying that this doesn't mean more players will follow.  Canada started making more players when tge national training infrastructure was improved.   China still isn't making players cause they have awful training and systems.  Yi Jianlan was discovered late olaying on the streets and didn't even develoo within the Chinese until they scooped him in his midteens. Players like Zhou Qi will most likely be hurt by playing in the Chinese system and being forxed to play in the Cba before China.  Satnam was drafted because of his upsides he was born with, nit because of the national teams/systems development"
Basketball,3bedkg,locdogjr,3,Sun Jun 28 23:43:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, fine. I still fail to see how having a high profile player doesn't improve the flawed systems you are talking about. If Singh is good for basketball, he's certainly good for Indian basketball."
Basketball,3bedkg,pumpyourbrakeskid,2,Sun Jun 28 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"You are correct there! His status may help change the Indian system for better. More kids may get involved, new leagues, youth camps etc."
Basketball,3bedkg,locdogjr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"yeah american players have gone to China and that's because they have really good infrastructure and a system to support a league. With that infrastructure, they have produced no NBA level players. Let's say there were even multiple prospects that didn't work out, that's after an already established system where people like Stephon Marbury and Tracy McGrady (if I am not mistaken) have played.   With India, this kid got picked up and put in FL and that's where he trained and got better. I think from a popularity standpoint, it is definitely a positive in a country where all people care about is cricket. But, there is no system to support the fanbase, Basketball Federation of India (BFI) is run by political fatcats. There are no training facilities, no high school-college league system that's well defined and unified. A lot has to be done before there can even be a China like environment in India, and then maybe we'll churn out some quality NBA prospects. And knowing my country, do I think that any of this will ever become real? Probably not - there will probably be another string of political moves, govt. will give grants to promote the sport which will in reality fund someone's vacation, and in a few months everybody will forget about it.   I hope something changes, I really do. But the country has bigger things to worry about than an esoteric sport which is not that popular.  I give Satnam 100% credit for his achievement, and him and his family should be proud of what he's accomplished at just 19, but this is no matter of national pride. I do hope though that this sheds light on the actual condition of sports that are not cricket in India."

All can be had right around the $100 mark.   I'm not sure whether or not you'll have any problems fitting a brace in them, but just to clarify: ankle support comes largely from keeping your foot centered over the sole of the shoe, and not necessarily any sort of rigidity or height of the shoe. That is to say that, in order to fit a brace, you might want to try a low top, such as an Nike Kobe model 8 thru 10.   I am yet to use the Kobe 10 (in either high top or low top), but the Kobe 8 lowtops were excellent shoes, and the the Kobe 9 Elite high and low were both great. The Kobe 9 Elite high is still one of the best basketball shoes I've ever worn."
Basketball,3bg1us,abrooks1125,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:34:56 2015 UTC,I've been playing in the Rose 5 Boosts and I love the ankle support. I have some pretty weak ankles myself and just came off wearing a brace for a bit after a nasty sprain about a year ago.
Basketball,3bg1us,TheJigglerElf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:41:14 2015 UTC,I was about your size when I sprained my ankle and the worst thing I did was wear a brace. It restricts movement and you don't really build the ankle back up leaving you at risk for another sprain.   I played in '11 Hyperfuse and the '12 Hyperdunk and the Hyperdunks are big enough for a brace. I decided to go low top though. You should just really focus on staying on the balls of your feet and strengthening the ankle. Got both pairs for around $85 each.
Basketball,3bg1us,naseK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"wow, I'll have to start trying to play without the brace and build strength that way.  I've always heard that hightop = best for your ankles, but I'm starting to read that's not exactly the case. Is there any correlation between high tops and support? Or is that just kind of old man science?"
Basketball,3bg1us,naseK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"It restricts movement honestly. Try squeezing your foot as hard as you can like clenching a fist.  You knew that tendon in the front of your foot that pops up where your shin meets your ankle? That's what locks your ankle up to keep it from rolling and spraining.  Plenty of dudes play in high tops, myself included but my feet are strong enough now to do so. I just feel freer in lows.   Dudes used to play in canvas Chuck Taylor's lol. No real support with those. All about strengthening the ankle/feet. Try standing on the bad ankle and closing your eyes.   Edit: Just realized I've been talking to a guy named Magical Poop."

I do, however, get pain in my knees and my neck when pulling up for a jump shot at the end of my drive into the paint.  For landing, I can't think of much to help you.

Basketball,3b63s6,HANGOVERHANGOVER,7,Fri Jun 26 07:27:01 2015 UTC,"I posted something similar on a ball handeling thread yesterday, but again, it's all about practice.  Best jump shooter I ever knew woke up every day and took 500 jumpers rain or shine.  It's all about developing your form and then shooting exactly the same way every-single-time.  The only way to accomplish that is through endless practice.  Ray Allen has some absurd game-day shooting routine, shooting hundreds of jumpers throughout the day.  Larry Bird used to do what is now called the ""Larry Bird Drill"" (and is a great drill to improve consistent shooting form:   Start right under the rim, hold the ball with your shooting hand in shot position, then shoot without jumping. Swish (must be a swish, no rim!), 5 in a row then take a step back. Swish 5 more in a row, then take another step back. Keep taking steps back after 5 swishes.  As you get towards the free-throw line, start bending you knees more to get more power.   Your offhand is simply there for control; it's not part of the power of your shot.  The form of your shot comes entirely from your shooting hand and legs.  This is a great drill that I still use to this day when I have time.  Great way to get yourself lined up and consistent.  Here is a demonstration of how the drill starts"
Basketball,3b63s6,KotWmike,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:42:18 2015 UTC,"Focus on shooting the same and always setting your feet. I personally like to jump into my shot, I feel it helps but some don't. Either way practice shooting the same everytime and keeping a good mentality."
Basketball,3b63s6,OneBraveGhost,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:04:02 2015 UTC,"Shoot your shot the exact same way every time. Whether it's from the free throw line or the 3 point line, keep your upper body form and most importantly your follow through the exact same. Make sure you always see what went wrong in your shot and try to adjust it (say if you're tired, you're gonna want to force yourself to use more legs). Looking at the ball after you release will make you take notice of your shot rotation."

Put in enough work and anything can happen. Prospect/bench. Strong defender/role player. Depends on your position.  All in all, it's good that you're a strong defender. That's always a plus. Not everyone needs to be an astounding ball handler, but try to develop some moves for getting past the D. 3 dribbles is all you need, just master the movements. Work on laying the ball in --- a bulk of your points will come off of cuts and screens if your shot is unreliable. Being a pass first player is fine, but remember to stay active off-ball. Happy balling, kid"

Basketball,3b5lmg,OSUBrahhhhh23,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:53:00 2015 UTC,"Work on your weaknesses but take your strengths and really run with it. Make your strengths superb.   For being a great perimeter defender, not just a good one, you need to improve your quickness and overall athleticism. That takes a lot of dedication. Search YouTube for drills and workouts you can do to improve your basketball athleticism.   If your dream is to play at a higher level as a role player, based mostly on one or two aspects of your game, especially without much scoring ability, then you better be really really fucking great at those one or two aspects. Dennis Rodman is the perfect example. His offense was terrible. Bus his defense and rebounding is some of the best all-time. He played way bigger than he was, out rebounding guys 6 inches taller than him. People just remember Rodman for being crazy and partying but what they don't know is that his dedication to strength training and conditioning was epic."
Basketball,3b5lmg,jeffreyeyr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:13:47 2015 UTC,"Without an offensive game, and no rebounding skills, you need to work a little more. I'm not sure you'd have a role on a team. Swingmen need to be scorers. They shoot the ball well and cut to the basket. When you play PF, your perimeter defense is not really needed. It's more about paint/rim protection. But as a 5'6'' guy, I doubt that you'd do well on PF in any scenario (unless you're a teenager and are one of the taller guys in your group). I play the same positions as you, and I'm 6'4'' - but I'm 32. I make sure I can hit midrange shots and three's. For example, yesterday I went out and just shot the ball for a couple of hours. I ended up making 12 consecutive three's and that can have a good impact on my game because it builds confidence - the first thing you need to conquer when improving your shot. The shot doesn't just come to you, you need to practice a lot.  It's good to know your weaknesses, so work on those. Leave distribution to your point guard and focus on putting the ball in the basket."
Basketball,3b5lmg,chadowmantis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:23:50 2015 UTC,"Well 5'6 as a big man won't do you any justice unless you're still growing. The good news is at 5'6, your perimeter defense and rebounding is great for your size. You should develop your shot by shooting countless jumpers everyday and develop your ball handling by dribbling up and down the court for two minutes at a time. Do that everyday you'll develop not only a nice all-around game, but you'll have a great work ethic."
Basketball,3b2jdm,pandaman38,11,Thu Jun 25 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"Countless hours of extremely repetitive practice.  The more the ball is a part of your hand, the better you can ""keep it on a string"".  I know you mean specific types of moves and the little details of the fakes they make, but IMO that is all part of the style of their unique handles.  Think about other great handlers like Ty Lawson, Steve Nash or even Pistol Pete; Ty is a straight smooth bull that just blasts by everyone, where Nash was intelligent and patient, waiting for the defender's balance to shift then exploiting it.  Pistol wasn't particularly quick, but was in his own world of timing that no one could predict and had unconventional moves that would result in a TO in anyone else's hands.  You can copy moves as much as possible, but in the end your handle style will be an extension of your physical gifts support by how much work you put into it."
Basketball,3b2jdm,KotWmike,3,Thu Jun 25 16:07:16 2015 UTC,Best answer while also touching on the differing play styles other players utilize. Through your practice you'll get the ball to become part of you then you can tailor things around your skill set; are you fast? Strong? Can you pick apart a defensive posture? Once you get the fundamentals down you can find what works for you.

While every player can protect the ball decently in the NBA and can do different moves the best are the ones who figured out a style that works for them whether it be being patient and throwing in a move to throw the defender off or just using moves to make the defender swipe at the ball they all found a personal style that they have worked to perfection.
Basketball,3b2jdm,mygingersoul,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:55:58 2015 UTC,"Keep your head up while dribbling and find the open man. Being versatile and a threat at shooting, passing and on the drive will make defenders have to be more aggressive than they would like and play team defense. Repetitive drills will build quickness and protecting the ball with your body when you go up to shoot or get stuck in tight situations."

Tell your teammates where you are or where you're going or if you want the ball.  Don't get mad if they don't give it to you but show that you're engaged.  Another way to communicate as a big man is to point.  You have the best view of your whole team while you're under the basket to point to open men.  You can also use this to get you easy looks.  If you can't get fully open in the post, put your body on the opposite side of your defender (him between you and the ball) and then point/tell your teammates to swing it and you immediately have position under the basket"
Basketball,3aui94,abrooks1125,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:45:52 2015 UTC,"You defend, communicate, rebound and get the ball to a guard, and set screens and roll to the basket.  Honestly, as a big man in a pickup game you'll likely be the only big man dedicated to playing big on your team, so you can leave the middle very open. I'd recommend spending most time on offense near the high post and screening there, unless you have a lot of room to work with and can body your man down to under the hoop.   Trust me, these are the most important things for a big man. There is a 6'7"" 230-250 lbs guy that plays with us every week and does none of this. He clogs up the paint, always over-pursues passing lanes and gets beat at the hoop, doesn't set screens, doesn't call screens. DO NOT BE THAT GUY."
Basketball,3aui94,theinterracialcouple,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:15:50 2015 UTC,"6'4"" 185 and I'd say I'm better at defense and rebounding as well. Depending on who you're playing with, normally rebounds (especially offensive) and blocked shots will be much appreciated. You don't have to do a whole lot on offense after that, because in a pick up game, other people love taking all the shots. Put backs can be your best friend and a Pau Gasol-style baby hook has proven to be useful for me. I try not to camp out down low though, unless it's required on defense. Also set a lot of screens, even if it isn't for a pick and roll. It's appreciated and a lot of open shot opportunities are created because of the lack of communication in lots of pickup games."

After dunking and lifting weights pretty regularly for about a year i've grown major calluses. Although when i first started dunking i did rip the skin of of my hand from hanging too hard.

If you practically trying to rip the rim off the backboard and doing it each time you see the chance you should probably relax. Even in the NBA, dunks only happen a few times a game and they're never throwing their whole weight at it i.e. Lebron James."

Basketball,3aqw9e,santokimilktea,3,Mon Jun 22 19:54:47 2015 UTC,"I agree it is a travel. The first quote is for when you catch the ball while moving. Since you are in triple threat, this is not the case.  The second quote is the one that is causing you to travel. Maybe you should practice the open step more, where you extend the non pivot foot at the side of the fake to pass uour defender.  Also, i hate people who whine about small infrictions like these. Only call the big stuff, and have some fun."
Basketball,3aqw9e,jardonm,3,Mon Jun 22 21:47:15 2015 UTC,Does sound like a travel to me when you catch the ball in motion you can have the 2 steps into your shot but not from a stationary position.
Basketball,3aqw9e,redmule123,2,Mon Jun 22 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"College player here.   Once pivoting you must bring that leg over and use the foot that's already planted to explode. This turns your back to your defender as you attack. If you pick up your pivot foot to attack off another foot, you will be called for traveling.  EDIT: Don't worry about pick up games. Anything other than playing is not important. Just simplify your moves to help combat arguments over calls."
Basketball,3aqw9e,Wolfhaley66645,2,Mon Jun 22 21:55:34 2015 UTC,Unless the ball hits the floor before you lift your pivot foot you will be called for a travel. Some refs allow you to make the dribbling motion (drop the ball but it doesn't hit the floor yet) and moving your foot should be fine

Basketball,3aqw9e,air_jordan1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:05:37 2015 UTC,I've run into people like that and if you know it's not a travel then fight it. There are people especially in a pick up game who will call every little thing wether it's legit or not. What makes you respected is calling out people's bullshit but respecting the call if you know you messed up. As far as that move just keep your foot down until the ball hits the floor. I never noticed it until now but even when I'm about to move from the triple threat I still just move my non pivot foot first.

Basketball,3aqw9e,clear831,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:18:16 2015 UTC,ball must be out of your hand before lifting that foot... but a common ref thing to do is listen also which makes them call it a travel a little more often.  They wait for the sound of hitting the ball on the floor before lifting your foot.  So rule says ball out of hand but many refs look for ball hitting the floor first

But you will probably encounter a roadblock in that you're trying to get copyrighted material printed onto clothing.  I'm pretty sure that most reputable companies will balk at this.    If that fails, I might imagine that your best bet would be semi-make them yourself.  Get a custom clothing shop to make the shirt and shorts in the correct colors.  Then perhaps buy the costumes I linked earlier, carefully remove the logos, and apply them to your new clothing.    Sorry, that's all I've got.

Basketball,3an1tp,oakla,3,Sun Jun 21 20:55:33 2015 UTC,How long have you been playing? I'd say 80 percent of being a good shooter is confidence. You have to get a feel it. Eventually you'll be able to tell when it's going in when it leaves your hands.  Hitting the back of the rim is not a bad miss at all. Missing left or right could mean it's more of a mechanical problem.

I'm hoping to play in an adult league nearby this upcoming fall and so this is the first time that I've actually tried to perfect my game (or strive to perfect it). The muscle memory is kicking in well, but this bounce back thing is frustrating b/c I feel like its something I can correct pretty easily and it would drastically increase the number of shots made.

Basketball,3an1tp,silooo123,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:43:28 2015 UTC,The extra power you`re giving it could be used to create a higher arc instead. This increases the chances of the ball going in flush with the net.
Basketball,3an1tp,madintangibles,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"The more arc the better. If it has more arc, the open area that the basket presents to the ball is larger as the ball passes through. With low arc, the open area of the basket presented to the ball is a smaller oval, leading to misses off the front and back rim.  Try to release with your hand lower under the ball, pushing up rather than forward."
Basketball,3an1tp,Wolfhaley66645,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"Practice holding your follow through and figure out how high your hands finish. I recommend the tips of your fingers at the top of the white square on the backboard, either way try to finish your follow through slightly higher to add more arch. When you hit the back of the rim while still holding your follow through adjust your hands higher to practice making it feel more natural."
Basketball,3an1tp,thesealwhisperer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:52:35 2015 UTC,"focus on how the ball comes off your fingertips. if u get good ball rotation, it helps with both arc and rim-kindness."

Anyways, I wish you the best of lucks, and hope you find some nice basketball friends to play with.

Basketball,3ajpp7,Sanchez27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"If you can jump, I think its almost safe to say you are not slow. I'd play one on one with your friend and practice driving into the lane and getting lay ups. If you can't get blocked by being able to jump high that'll do wonders for your game. You also need to practice shooting."
Basketball,3ajpp7,iAmKael,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:58:40 2015 UTC,"First: Learn to rebound, pass, and play defense.   If you learn these components first, you can play with anyone. This way you could play pick-up and not be totally lost and actually contribute. Watch players better than you and take mental notes. Don't be the type that freezes up when they get the ball. Always find teammates to pass to before you do anything while playing pick-up.   Second: learn to play offense  Learn how to do a proper layup. Work your way to shooting by learning and practicing your form. Once you learn a proper form, and foot position, move back and shoot free throws until you feel comfortable shooting the ball.   Sometimes, shooting takes years of practice to master. Stay positive and remember its supposed to be fun even when its frustrating."
Basketball,3ajpp7,Wolfhaley66645,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:10:35 2015 UTC,"what made me a very good shooter is to practice shooting one handed.  This will teach you how to get the proper spin and everything.  Just look up any quick instructional shooting video for proper form and you can check your form easiest by shooting one handed.  Start out very close to the basket like layup distance and shoot one handed with each hand trying to get that back spin.  This will also improve ball control with each hand for other basketball things like dribbling and catching bad passes.  As this gets easier, add the other hand and make sure it's just there for balance and not affecting the spin.    I say all that as something you can do purely on your own. Some things require you to have people with you but this shooting ""drill"" will improve your pickup basketball skill"

Basketball,3ajpp7,thartle8,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:20:18 2015 UTC,"yeah but for just learning, screw long shots.  You should use two hands on those but be sure the second hand is just there to balance the ball.  Your legs do the work on longer shots, not hands or arms"

Be the one taking the initiative by setting up plays proactively rather than waiting for a pass outside and making a move. Pickup games have little => no synergy so just run.

Basketball,3ajpc3,Cptcongcong,3,Sat Jun 20 22:35:51 2015 UTC,5 spot shooting for shooting. Also form shooting under the basket and on the blocks will help.   Miking Drill for layups. Stand under the basket and shoot a layup and catch the ball out the net. Repeat on the other side.  10-20 times front. 10-20 times reverse.
Basketball,3ajpc3,Wolfhaley66645,2,Mon Jun 22 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"You need to be more specific.  Assuming you're playing pickup outdoors in a half-court set, outside shooting isn't going to be something that I would focus on. Instead, I would focus on mid-range shooting and being under 6 foot I'd focus on pump-faking or upfaking post moves - higher percentage stuff."
Basketball,3ajpc3,MarioSpeedwagon13,2,Sat Jun 20 22:21:42 2015 UTC,Practice. Repetition is the key. Just practice your layup until you can do it consistently. Pick up games are perfect for pick and rolls for easy layups...

Basketball,39sbmj,melvintwj,4,Sun Jun 14 21:07:04 2015 UTC,"Work on palming the ball and figure out whether you are more comfortable jumping off one foot or two, then practice! The more you practice the higher you will eventually jump.  Can also do some leg exercises to increase the strength and explosiveness of your jump (E.g. Squats)"
Basketball,39sbmj,Fananigans,3,Sun Jun 14 08:05:13 2015 UTC,"Squats, leg press, calf raises 3 times per week and just keep practicing on the court, once you get your wrist over the rim, you'll get there."
Basketball,39sbmj,smithy006,2,Sun Jun 14 11:46:01 2015 UTC,"Touching the rim doesn't let you dunk. You gotta get your wrist above the rim, it makes dunking way easier.

Basketball,39sbmj,gordonderp,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:58:28 2015 UTC,Dunking when you can just touch rim is a good way to land on your back in my experience
Basketball,39sbmj,Very_legitimate,2,Sat Jun 20 21:50:49 2015 UTC,"If you can palm a basketball, keep the ball right on the tips of your fingers.  Don't try to throw it down, just go up, put the ball above the rim, set it in, then grab the rim.  It's not powerful, but it's still a dunk. A lot of people who are almost there try to dunk hard and end up losing the ball around the rim."
Basketball,39sbmj,BIGMAN50,2,Sun Jun 14 14:24:39 2015 UTC,I would recommend 2 things: plyometrics and start training to go up with 2 hands. It felt really awkward for me to dunk 2 handed because I was always a 1 foot 1 hand leaper (meaning I covered more horizontal distance than vertical distance). But once you get the coordination down for 2 handed jumps you should be able to finish fairly easily.
Basketball,39sbmj,themoose33,2,Sun Jun 14 20:10:40 2015 UTC,I work on footing and movements on a shorter goal. I can dunk pretty well as I'm 6'7 with a 32in vert but when I first started teaching myself to dunk I worked on all the movements on a shorter goal so I could build the confidence and find what method was most comfortable for me. Even having the right breathing method made a difference for me (inhaling when I jumped). Ankle weights will improve overall leg strength. If you usually play indoors on a wooden court try playing on concrete and jumping on it. Concrete has no bounce to it and absorbs more of your jump providing more resistance which will build your legs for jumping indoors. Just keep jumping and find comfortable jump/ball palming habits on a short goal and don't expect immediate results.
Basketball,39sbmj,lta13usn,2,Mon Jun 15 04:16:31 2015 UTC,Everyone here is giving good above but don't forget the core. People underestimate how much a strong core factors into speed/jumping ability.

Also I just like jumping over shit, so my friends and I would always try to jump random stuff we saw and try to one up. I think the competition helped.  Practice with a volleyball to get a feel for dunking (can hurt your hands or wrists at first). Practice on a 9 before trying a 10.  Palming practice helps.   I'm 5ft 10in so my hands are kinda medium, palming is really hard I kinda have to cradle it up. But I can dunk 8/10 times just because I've always worked on jumping high. Toe ups do wonders for real"

Basketball,39ll8z,Cindjor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:40:18 2015 UTC,It's more hips in soccer so you defend more so from the side and push them off the ball. Once someone blows by you in bball you can't really do anything.   To add to that you can only use your butt on offense in soccer. Can't butt check or clog a lane in soccer unless you're taking the ball.

Basketball,39ll8z,spenrad,3,Fri Jun 12 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"One of the guys I play with is rather new to basketball and is mainly a hockey player, so it took him awhile to get his bearings on when it was appropriate to channel his hockey physicality, haha.    The main piece of advice I can offer (take it or leave it) is to let the offensive player initiate the contact.  Always stand your ground, but as long as you aren't leaning into them, leaning on them, running into them, laying hands on them, or other stuff that can be seen as ""chippy"" or ""cheap"" then you should be fine. I usually prefer to play with people who have a more physical style of play, as long as they are under control.  Now, most of the time when someone comes on the court out of control with their physicality I will stay as far away from them as possible.  Whether its overagression or they just don't have much basketball experience, that is the most dangerous type of player to be around (as far as injuries go).  So, in summary, stand your ground, but let the offensive player be the one to initiate the contact and you should be golden."
Basketball,39ll8z,J_T_Mills,3,Fri Jun 12 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"most of the time when someone comes on the court out of control with their physicality I will stay as far away from them as possible. Whether its overagression or they just don't have much basketball experience, that is the most dangerous type of player to be around (as far as injuries go).    Agreed with this.  A novice playing with players of a much higher skill is more likely to unknowingly cause an injury.  Not out of malice, but because he doesn't have the experience to control his body or the foresight to realize that his actions might result in serious injury to someone else."
Basketball,39ll8z,cag8f,3,Sat Jun 13 12:31:03 2015 UTC,"1) Don't jack threes early in an offensive possession.  Of course, there are exceptions like your teammate hitting you because you're open.. But off the dribble is generally a low percentage shot.  I'll stop passing  swinging you the ball  2) If you don't have handles and you get a defensive rebound, get the ball to the point guard.  As a PG you are now my favorite option in the fast break and I'd give it back to you in a better position to make a play because I like your hustle + ""The trailer""  3) Know what fouls are and be honest when you commit one.  This works to your advantage on key possessions when it actually matters because no refs means credibility is actually a factor.  4)Off-ball movement.  Set a pick for a teammate.  Many pick ups games are so loose that if you set a screen for a teammate there's a really good chance your teammate will be open. And if its tight D then you have even more reason to generate scoring opportunities.  5) Diving for loose balls without hurting anybody will make you an instant hero 100% of the time.  No matter how much you'll regret it later."
Basketball,39ll8z,SeriouslyRelaxing,2,Sat Jun 13 00:59:07 2015 UTC,"I'm a former lacrosse player, and I play pickup with a few other former lacrosse players. Most don't seem to have the problem, but one does, and perhaps what you're doing is the same, because when he does it, it seems dirty: he fundamentally doesn't understand the difference between boxing out, hip/shoulder checking, and under-cutting. If you take a jumper, he'll try to box out as soon as you jump, causing you to land on him. If you do up for a rebound, he wil keep boxing out your legs while in the air instead of going for the rebound himself. If you have him in a one-on-one, he'll body check you instead of trying to defend you.   If you are doing any of the above, stop. If not, then don't worry. Remember, play defense with your feet and stand your ground, but don't impede on a spot you're not entitled to."

He just denies it and calls us bitches for calling legitimate fouls. Don't do that.

The USA won every gold medal from 1936 to 1972 when they were cheated out of gold. They didn't participate in 1980 due to the western boycott, so the only time they simply didn't win was 1988. That team was college players. In 1992 they let the professionals play (Jordan, Bird, etc).  More to the histroical side, the USA had the first pro leagues  and of course the ultra competitive college system. And in some regions basketball is or has been the most popular sport for generations (Indiana,  North Carolina, Kentucky, Kansas, most urban centers like Chicago and NYC).

Basketball,39c8zl,straitrider,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:58:36 2015 UTC,"I just received my pair actually of the chromosome color. Only played three times in them but so far pretty good. Not on par with the Jordan xx8 SE I had but I'm hoping the lebron 12s are more durable because two of my xx8s popped the right air pocket.   Anyway so far grip is good but builds up dust decently fast but every once in a while a quick hand wipe makes it good again. I haven't slipped but the edge along the heel and by the outside of the foot is really slippery when I'm sitting on the floor and that part touches the ground. Support is good. Breaking them in still so take this all with a grain of salt. My main hope, since there aren't air pockets used, is that they'll be more durable than the xx8s. But it's a real shame because those were amazing otherwise."

Basketball,39936l,badreligion9265,2,Wed Jun 10 03:31:07 2015 UTC,"I've been called for this too. I was told it was a travel because it wasn't a continuos motion; i.e. I didn't take a layup. In other words, you can only take two steps for dunks, layups, or a tear drop.   I'd like to hear others opinions though, because this feels like a very ""natural"" basketball move. A"
Basketball,39936l,BCboneless,2,Wed Jun 10 06:52:29 2015 UTC,I believe that so it isn't called a travel you would have to jump with both feet because if you just pullup you pivot that would be like a 3rd step.
Basketball,39936l,adrianmb0,2,Wed Jun 10 13:24:23 2015 UTC,"from your description, it sounds like it was indeed a travel.  as the poster above me stated, you would have to jump off both feet at the same time for it not to be a travel"
Basketball,39936l,The_Reckoner,2,Wed Jun 10 17:49:40 2015 UTC,"The problem most people make from this move is pre-dribble vs post-dribble. Your description is post dribble, and is a travel. The pre-dribble version that is legal is when a player catches the ball in the post, pivots, then steps through with a lay-up or (usually) a hook shot without dribbling. That's a legal move (though most casual pick-up players will still call it a travel)."
Basketball,39936l,KotWmike,2,Wed Jun 10 19:03:19 2015 UTC,The comments stating it is a travel aren't citing any specific NBA rules as to why. When making a layup a player is given two steps upon gathering his dribble and allowed to go up off the second step/foot with the other in the air. How is the move in question any different aside from the fact the second step is preceded by a pivot?
Basketball,39936l,romanreignsWWECHAMP,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:36:34 2015 UTC,"wait so you stopped, pivoted with your rear foot then took 2 steps like you were gonna do a layup? ??"
Basketball,39936l,The_Reckoner,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:31:20 2015 UTC,"No I stopped, pivoted with rear foot, then jumped off non pivot/front foot for layup. After the pivot there are no more steps taken its simply a matter of am I allowed to jump off a non pivot foot with my pivot foot leaving the floor first. For some reason people think any form of lifting your pivot foot is a travel. As far as I know this is only the case   when you lift the pivot foot prior to the ball leaving your hands right before you go into a dribble. But I was pretty sure this rule does not apply when going for a shot or pass, only when transitioning into a dribble does it apply."
Basketball,39936l,The_Reckoner,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:40:17 2015 UTC,"http://www.nba.com/news/officiating/  If you click the link for the 2014-2015 rule book and go to page 37 of the pdf, and then section XIII - Traveling, part c reads: ""c. In starting a dribble after (1) receiving the ball while standing still, or (2) coming to a legal stop, the ball must be out of the player’s hand before the pivot foot is raised off the floor.""  So the situation you describe is part (2) of that rule.    Also, a few lines above in part (b) it states: A player who comes to a stop on step one when both feet are on the floor or touch the floor simultaneously may pivot using either foot as his pivot. If he jumps with both feet he must release the ball before either foot touches the floor.""  So if you have established a pivot, you can jump off both feet simultaneously and shoot or pass while in midair and that would not be a travel."
Basketball,39936l,The_Reckoner,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:19:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think the situation I describe is part 2 of that rule. I think the rule you quoted is stating there are two conditions in which part c applies.   1.) After coming to a legal stop (Maybe after landing? It doesn't specificy)   2.) After receiving the ball from a standstill.   I believe part (c) is only addressing the traveling rules when it comes to starting a dribble and not addressing the situation I am asking about.    It also sounds like the part (b) you mention is only trying to make it known that the player can choose between both feet for his pivot, when both land on count one. And the additional information about the ball having to leave his hands if he jumps with both feet doesn't seem to help in answering whether or not you can jump off one. If you can jump for a shot from that position off both feet I don't see how jumping off one would add some type of unfair advantage.    That is my interpretation at least.   Here is a video which states what I did is not a travel.  At the end of the video the demonstration of the move is exactly what I did on the court which was called a travel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7X5E-rtjjA"
Basketball,39ac1i,afetosin,8,Wed Jun 10 11:43:28 2015 UTC,"Practice dribbling against a defender as often as possible to improve your handle.  Make sure when you cut, change speeds and directions to get open. Don't be afraid to initiate contact with the person guarding you to gain leverage and get open.  Try using fakes on your catch before you dribble to get your defender off balance to try and get past them. Jab fakes/shot fakes (youtube) will imbalance them and then when you drive past be low and explosive.  Passing and standing is a bad habit. After you pass screening away from the ball is another good option. Often times setting a screen for someone else will also help you get open.  Shooting has a lot to do with confidence. The more you shoot the more confident you'll be and likely the more shots that you will make."
Basketball,39ac1i,purepg10,0,Wed Jun 10 12:21:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! Will try these. Sometimes it's easier than it seems to get past your defender, you just have to try hard and get low."
Basketball,39ac1i,lolredditnames,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:38:03 2015 UTC,"See the floor try to make sure you know what all four teammates are doing so if they do get open you can hit them with a quick pass and they can score. Work on your crossover to where you can get it to the other hand quickly same for through the legs and behind the back, make your moves quick. The Point guard position is normally where you need to be really quick so when trying to get open stop and then explode with speed when moving away from the ball. Also as a point guard you need to make plays so when your dribbling gets better and say you beat your defender off the dribble and another defender comes for help defense you need to be able to find your teammate cutting to the basket. Hope this helps."
Basketball,39ac1i,mikedaul,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:03:55 2015 UTC,"One thing you could work on is penetrating the defense, drawing help from other defenders, and then passing to the now (hopefully) open player on your team. Not all point guards need to be good at scoring, but it certainly doesn't hurt..."
Basketball,39ac1i,romanreignsWWECHAMP,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:33:19 2015 UTC,"pass the ball to someone near mid range, run full speed towards the basket, your defender will be behind you, catch the pass and do an easy layup.   do pick and rolls and shit  dont be nervous, theyll steal the ball off you if you're nervous.  point guard is a shitty position imo, especially lunchtime ball they probably made you pg so you'll have pass to them (first man pass idk if you play with that rule) and they get to do w/e they want."

Also, Lebron is probably the cleanest player in the league and people still try to assassinate his character.

Basketball,38utd9,Sir_mix_a_little_bit,4,Sun Jun 7 11:21:56 2015 UTC,"Finding somewhere to play is very important, but before that, you need to learn the basics. Buy a basketball and learn how to dribble. Dribble with your fingertips left and right handed. You should be able to do crossovers, direction changes, through the legs without looking at the ball. Then depending on your size find your told in the game. Are you if you're 6'2 and above you're probably gonna be expected to play post since you said you are a body builder. Get real good at 1 or 2 simple post moves. That right there will make you competitive against most players. If you're smaller, work on driving before you develop your shot. If you can't shoot and you take a lot of shots in a game, people will hate playing with you so know you're role. Defense just takes effort so anyone can be good at that. Always keep your man in front of you. Sorry for the wall of text. I'm using my phone. If you have any questions or need any advice, feel free to shoot me a pm. Good luck, man!"

You're not gunna come I straight away and dominate, get on YouTube and watch tutorials on basic skills and just try stuff.  People have said about post moves, and if you have some size to you that'll be the best place to start. Just hustle on defense and look to pass on offense If you're not confident, and guys will love you if you open them up for easy buckets so set up screens.

Basketball,38utd9,craigehlo43,2,Sun Jun 7 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"As in stealing the ball? i wouldn't focus on trying to steal the ball, steals are one of those things you don't go looking for so much but more just seize the opportunity when it arises. Focus on D and boxing out, and cut out passes if they're close to you but don't go lunging at the ballhandler or you'll just give them a clear path.   As a newer player i would focus on being more reactive, as in reacting to what the other player is doing. Put the pressure on them and force them to mess up, box them out and collect the ball or help a teammate pick it up. Just try and get in the way of anyone trying to score. You said you're in pretty good shape so gun it back to stop fastbreaks, even if you don't block/stop the shot, you'll put extra pressure on them and they're more likely to fluff it.  I'm not an expert, but that's what I do and i'm pretty good on D if i do say so myself."
Basketball,38svng,shimmyking45,11,Sat Jun 6 15:07:32 2015 UTC,Set screens and focus on getting in position for offensive rebounds and you should get some open looks. Not everyone on the floor needs to be a huge threat.
Basketball,38svng,Rumham89,3,Sat Jun 6 15:35:05 2015 UTC,Pick and roll game is so important. You can roll off into wide open lay ups. No matter how the defend it your team will have an advantage some where.
Basketball,38svng,enjoyit7,2,Sat Jun 6 22:46:16 2015 UTC,Well you should practice on offense. Thing I hate is like 3 guys who don't know how to shoot or drive leaving me & another to do it all. Screens aren't useful when the screener can't hit an open shot or drive to the hole.
Basketball,38svng,GeezManNo,5,Sun Jun 7 04:21:50 2015 UTC,"It just comes down to practice, if you throw the ball in front of yourself with some back spin on it and practice catch and shoot threes (say 100 a day) eventually you'll be able to knock them down with some consistency.  Same thing goes for practicing ball control and gathering the ball as you get to the basket do it will not get stripped, and work on finishing with both hands. It's all just repetition.  Watch some videos and learn how to space the floor so you can find open shots or ball movement so you can help others create offense."
Basketball,38svng,zboltss,4,Sat Jun 6 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"Are you me?   What I do is just good screens on and off ball. I know my strengths and weaknesses so I try to  roll after I set a pick to force the defense to scramble. I know some of my teammates are way better shooters than I am, so I set screens for them.   I try to cut and get good position to get offensive rebounds or get easy buckets if the defense is sleeping on me. Personally, I think mid range shots are underrated because it keeps the defense honest. Everyone sags into the paint so I practice my elbow jumper and when I get a few shots in a row, I can get people in the air so I can just go around them   Edit: you don't necessarily need to be a threat but you need to force the defense to not sag off you enough so that it gets in the way of your teammates, like Tony Allen"

Basketball,38svng,mmmtwitter,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:25:03 2015 UTC,Just set yourself up around either the elbow or baseline within a similar arc as a netball court. If your defender slides or doubles. Then follow him and make the pass to you a short and easy one. If you set a pick remember to roll so that you always face the ball carrier and when you get the ball always face up/have a look at the ring.  If the team you're playing against is playing a zone. Set up on the free throw line or baseline just outside of the key. If a teammate drives to the ring stand opposite side of the ring and wait for the little draw and dish.  Edit: spelling
Basketball,38svng,smithy006,2,Mon Jun 8 07:33:03 2015 UTC,"A few extra tips that others haven't put in..  1)  Firstly, above all, the biggest threat on offense imho is the best passer on the team, they always find the open man and are the difference between a good and a bad offense, don't think you have to score to be a good offensive player, if you can use your vision and find the open man you are a threat.  2) When you get the ball, Don't waste your dribble, take your time face up to your defender and put yourself in the tripple threat position (google it if you aren't sure what it is, basically put yourself in a position where you could drive, shoot or pass).  The defender will literally wait for you to do something (if they're smart), If they get right up on you then you should be able to drive straight past them.  Look at the defenders feet and their positioning, and exploit the opportunity they give you.  3)  Most importantly, find your spot on the court where you feel the most comfortable shooting from, practice from there a lot and try to get open looks in that position.  If you watch particular NBA players all season long, you'll notice they only take a selected number of shots in most cases (this isn't a coincidence).  Find some hotspots on the court that you like, and practice shooting in the areas.  4) Practice with friends playing defense against you, whatever shots you decide to practice on find a friend you can play one on one with and just get used to having someone defend every shot you take, you'll get used to the pressure and feel more comfortable taking defended shots."
Basketball,38svng,MadeiiNPoland,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:20:56 2015 UTC,What I did is I worked on my mid game jumper and off the dribble pull up. So my my better ball handling teammates drive and collapse the defense I pick my spot in the mid range and wait for a pass. I suggest you get a go to move like a tear drop or floater and position yourself on the floor where you can use that go to move.

Basketball,38svng,SaucyTotchie,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:06:08 2015 UTC,Become a good passer.  Getting a shooter right in his sweet spot or making a sweet bounce pass on a backdoor play is somewhat underrated.  Passing is a very complex thing when you want to hit the mark in perfect rhythm with your teammate
Basketball,38svng,straitrider,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:21:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely sounds like a mental problem. Learn to clear your head and  play like it's just you and your defender. I have a similar problem: I play decently in small pickup games, but when I play in full court 5v5 games, I don't feel comfortable because I'm not used to it."

Basketball,38ps5i,KatakaMaka,3,Fri Jun 5 20:25:51 2015 UTC,I would say the most effective thing you could do is go for offensive rebounds on every play. In pickup that's usually how a big man can make a huge difference just using their height
Basketball,38ps5i,canadeken,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"On defense, should I focus on sticking to the guy I'm defending, or stick to protecting the paint in general?"
Basketball,38ps5i,canadeken,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on who you're playing with and against. You want to make sure you stop the guy you're defending from scoring, but helping out on defence near the rim is also important. I would talk to my teammates and see what kind of balance they expect, between guarding your man tight vs sagging off a bit to help on the inside. It also depends on whether the person you're guarding is a good shooter or not... If he is, you'll have to guard him closer to prevent him from shooting"
Basketball,38ps5i,kwlpp,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:35:06 2015 UTC,"That's entirely dependent on who you're guarding.  If the guy can shoot, you'll have to extend out to him so that he can't shoot as cleanly.  If he can't shoot, have fun backing off and sitting closer to the paint.  If you watch the NBA playoffs, the Warriors had their center, Andrew Bogut, guard Memphis' small forward, Tony Allen, because he can't really shoot.  It's even happening now in the finals. The Cavs center, Mozgov, guarding the Warriors backup small forward, Iguodala.  If you really want to defend the paint because of your height, just guard the person with the worst shot on the opposing team.  Also with rebounding, once you get the ball, keep your arms/hands up above the head (Even when gathering yourself, try to not let the ball come down below head level).  Shorter guys thrive on bigger players putting the ball down when they gather near the rim.  It's literally the only chance they'll get to stop you from shooting."
Basketball,38ps5i,KotWmike,2,Tue Jun 9 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"When on offense, go near the basket. Set your feet wide apart and use your forearm to make space between you and the guy guarding you. Don't push him, just keep him off your body with that forearm. On e the ball is passed to you, hold it strong in 2 hands, just higher than your forehead. Keep the ball high, turn towards the basket and into your opponent in one motion and shoot. Unless he is really athletic, you'll either have an easy shot or he'll have to foul you to stop you.   If you prefer to dribble drive, use the same logic on e you gather your dribble of keeping the ball high. Jump into the defender, wait for the contact, then shoot a layup."

Basketball,38odni,dick_nipples_AMA,3,Fri Jun 5 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to the people saying jump shot.  You should develop one, but it takes time and you won't be good enough to start firing in games for awhile.  Learn intangibles.  Things like moving without the ball, defensive positioning, rebounding, passing, catching the ball (like /u/basketballjim said).  It'll be much easier for you to help your team by scoring off of put backs and back door cuts to the rim than by firing mid range / 3pt jumpers.  This kind of stuff you can learn from youtube videos, but you gotta practice it with other people to get it down.  If you're in the gym by yourself just work on dribbling, jump shooting, and conditioning.  Edit: Added info."
Basketball,38odni,Hungry4Werms,2,Fri Jun 5 18:32:54 2015 UTC,Jump shot.   If you can score you can play. Practice.   Next. If you can play defense you can play on my team any day. Off hand layups are not necessary. Just make them when you are open
Basketball,38odni,xC6H1206x,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"there are no FTs in pick up ball. But a jump shot makes offense a lot easier, and ball handling is next. Id say practice defense but thats hard to do alone, and instincts and effort will get you pretty far on that side of the court"
Basketball,38odni,EhrmantrautWetWork,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:15:42 2015 UTC,When I play pick up we don't shoot FTs but shooting mid range in general would be beneficial. don't waste your time jacking 3s because they won't be a high percentage shot and your team will get pissed off if you start bricking stupid shots over and over again. Dribbling with your head up while protecting the ball will probably be the most essential in my eyes because with your head down you're just going to barrell into the other team or piss your team off by not hitting them while they're wide open. When ever I shoot around on my own time I usually start out with driving to the net for a layup from the elbows to practice in game scenarios. Finishing with your off hand isn't essential but it will help you avoid getting blocked easily. If your main goal is to hold your own at pick up just keep it simple. No need to worry about flashy cross overs or reverse layups.
Basketball,38odni,stevendavidson3,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"As you play, you'll see what limits you from excelling and enjoying the pcikup games more and those will naturally be the areas you work on.  the one thing i would say is that you should take care to read about how to build up your skills (e.g. proper shooting form and mechanics). Far too many people just try to impersonate guys in the nba and then get these bad habits ingrained that limit their potential and once you've learned them it's really hard to unlearn them."
Basketball,38odni,ec20,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:37:41 2015 UTC,Do the Mikan drill and learn how to do a layup. If you can do a layup you're never getting the ball.

Hand strength exercises and dribbling, followed by shooting form basics. as an FYI,  I watched a few Pistol Pete videos (search for  Basketball Dribbling Drills by Pistol Pete Maravich  ) and there are a bunch of more modern videos of course.    your goal is to be able to dribble with very little need to ever look down.  Once you feel comfortable with this in real games, you'll be on your way.  I noticed something that whenever I did the same drill for about 100 repetitions, I would see AND feel improvements."

If you catch the ball and look at it, I'm going to swing at it while you're not focused on the game and focused on the ball.  I always look at the back of the rim. I don't think it really matters though, find what gives you confidence and shoot at it. Chances are usually better if you aim at the back of the rim of the ball going in the hole but I've known shooters that shot at the front rim or middle.  The only time that I'd say look at the back of the rim 100% is on free throws. Focus on the smallest spot you can find on the backside of the rim and shoot for that.  Hope this helps!"

Basketball,38ido1,TheSamehMagdy,2,Thu Jun 4 12:30:30 2015 UTC,"There are 30 teams in the NBA. They are separated into two Conferences (east and west), which in turn are separated into 3 Divisions each. The way an NBA season works, is teams play 82 games against eachother. When every team has played 82 games, they choose the Most Valuable Player and a few other titles, and top 8 teams from each conference advance to the Playoffs (Division winners having a guaranteed spot in the top 3, but this is a little complicated and not that important for a beginner). In the Playoffs, teams play 4 rounds. To win a round, a team has to win 4 games. Then they get matched up with a different team, and they have to win 4 games again. In the fourth and final round, they play the finals (right now, that's Golden State from the west conference, and Cleveland from the east).  The season starts in October and lasts until April. Then the Playoffs begin, and they end in june when the champion is announced.  The best players are Stephen Curry (Golden State), James Harden (Houston) and LeBron James (Cleveland).  I really don't know what team you should root for. There's a few teams with a lot of international players, you can check those out (San Antonio, Minnesota, Brooklyn). Personally, I like Houston Rockets, and I don't want to say that they're hated, but they're definitely not a popular team."
Basketball,38ido1,chadowmantis,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:14:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! that's really helpful.  But what is the points system in the league? is it 3 points for a win and 1 point for a draw like football?  What about the game rules? things that are confusing for newbies like the offside rule in football for example.  The players' positions/Duties?  What about all those terms I see? (""Plays"" - ""Backcourt"" - ""Bankshot"" - ""Baseline"" - ""Point guard"" - ""Fastbreak"" etc..)"
Basketball,38ido1,chadowmantis,3,Thu Jun 4 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"The points are simple. One Win is one point. There are no draws (the game goes into overtime until one team wins).  There are five players/positions: Point Guard is usually the shortest and fastest guy who is also a good passer. He's a playmaker who can set up an offense and provide his teammates with opportunities to score.  Shooting Guard and Small Forward are playing on the wing (or the sides) of the court, and are usually slashing towards the basket or waiting somewhere for the ball so they can shoot.  Power Forward and Center are the biggest guys on the team, they protect the basket on defense and make sure they grab the ball after a miss (that's called a rebound). Some exceptional big men like Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon etc actually were the main focus of the offense as well.  Have a look at this picture: https://thegirlygirlsguidetosports.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/pic-basketball-spieler-224714-55.gif  The rules can be complicated. I don't think I can type everything here, but in short:  There's a ""three point line"". It's the big half circle you see in that picture. Every basket made outside of it is worth 3 points. Inside of it it's 2 points. When a player gets fouled while he's in a shooting motion, he can shoot a free throw which is worth 1 point. There are other ways to get free throws as well.  When defending, and your opponent shoots the ball, you are only allowed to touch it while it's going up. If it's already on its way down while you touch the ball (if you can jump that high) then it counts like a made basket. That's why there aren't any people who just stand in front of the basket and slap the ball away.

If you are defending and your opponent is standing just outside of it, then you are allowed to stay inside - as long as you are actively defending him.  There are 4 quarters, each takes 12 minutes. If the game is tied at the end of the 4th quarter, you play another period of 5 minutes. If it's tied again, you keep playing 5 minute quarters until one team wins.   You have 6 timeouts, which means the game stops and you can rest and talk to your teammates and coach for 1 minute. You also get one 20-second timeout per half.  There is a line in the middle of the court. This separates the front court and the back court. If you are on offense, you have 8 seconds to cross it. If you don't, you lose the ball. Once you've crossed the half court line, you can't return to your own half. If you do, you lose the ball. This is called Backcourt Violation.  The term backcourt is also used for describing the Point Guard and the Shooting Guard players. They are the backcourt players, but this is confusing so just ignore it until you get a better grasp on the basic terminology.  Bankshot is when you make a basket off the board.  Baseline is the line under both baskets. If you step on it or cross it while dribbling/holding the ball, you are out of bounds and you lose the ball.  Fastbreak is when you are defending and you steal the ball from your opponent, and run very fast to their basket to score.  Plays are complicated, especially in the NBA. The players are trained to work as one. If a coach or the Point Guard calls a play (for example ""Pick and Roll""), every player goes to their position and they do something that they practiced a lot, which helps them get one of the players open for a shot, or it creates a path to the basket for one of them to score easily."

Basketball,38bwhc,mad_regal,6,Wed Jun 3 05:38:27 2015 UTC,None of that is going to matter. Just play together. Have practice where you run 5 on 5 or run through plays you'd like to do. Make sure everyone explicitly knows their roles and that you guys have good chemistry.  My team currently lacks all those things and we are losing to teams that are far less superior than us and it sucks. All we need is to get in the gym twice a week and play together but we don't and it shows.
Basketball,38bwhc,spenrad,3,Wed Jun 3 07:42:05 2015 UTC,"Agree with the other comment. Just play 5on5 - don't just run up and down the court, come back on D and pass, pass, pass. Get as much game experience as possible. Try to feel and get to know each other as much as possible through this short period.  If you want to do any drills, just do the shooting drills to warm up and get shots going.  Good luck in your games. Enjoy it, that's what it's all about."

Basketball,38b6n2,freestylized,4,Wed Jun 3 02:10:24 2015 UTC,"So first of all, the whole idea of boxing out. Essentially all your doing is keeping yourself closer to the rim than your opponent. So using you body to force your opponent behind you and therefore further from the rim. Like this  I'm only 5'11"" or so and I grab most of my rebounds by just being aggressive. I play wing a lot, so as soon as somebody takes a shot I just book it towards the paint. Getting a running start gives you more momentum and should allow you to jump higher. But if your in the post then just box out and use your body position to give yourself an advantage and grab that board.  Then there's the act of grabbing the ball itself. I got into the bad habit of trying to rebound with one hand... that doesn't work at all. Even though you can't reach as high when both your arms are reaching up, that's the only way you'll be able to grab boards. Jump, reach up with both hands, grab the ball with both, and then just pull it down as fast and hard as you can. Snatch that bitch out of the air so that nobody can even get a hand on it.  This is just speaking from experience. If you want more help just let me know."
Basketball,38b6n2,FoldableClock,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:08:15 2015 UTC,"What's the best positioning ? I feel like a lot of the time, I'm too close to the hoop, I keep my opponent behind me with an unextended arm. And the ball bounces back beyond my reach where him being behind me turns into an advantage. Maybe I'm always positioning myself too close to the rim ? I also definitely try to rebound one handed and it seldoms works...lots of times I'll try to just pop the ball toward a teammate but it ends up going to an opponent or out of bounds"
Basketball,38b6n2,CellularJunctions,2,Wed Jun 3 04:03:10 2015 UTC,"You definitely don't want to be too close to the basket. Remember, if you box out successfully, it'll be much easier for you to move towards the net for a short rebound than it will be for your counterpart to run around you and grab the board."
Basketball,38b6n2,collkiwi,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"Every shot rebounds to a different area, so its a matter of getting that feel for where the ball will go and being the first there. This just comes with experience, or if you like crazy charts - http://courtvisionanalytics.com/where-do-rebounds-go/  The key to boxing out is not so much about getting the rebound yourself, but if everyone on your team boxes out effectively, someone on your team will defintely get the ball. As soon as the ball goes up, you get between your man and the hoop, regardless of where you are. Then get low and stick your elbow and your arse into him so he cant get past. Then obviously moves towards the ball in flight and time your jump. If everyone does that, your team will get the ball most of the time. If you box out well, sometimes you don't even need to jump, as the ball will just fall in front of you and they have no chance to get to it."
Basketball,38b6n2,Saucy_Totchie,3,Wed Jun 3 04:43:22 2015 UTC,"Size and jumping ability is only a small factor in rebounding.  The two main aspects is positioning and timing.  I'm only 5'6 but am able to grab a few boards from guys taller than me by boxing out and jumping at the right time.  Remember to just  Keep your center of gravity low (crouch down a bit)  If you're going to push, push with your lower body (Overwhelm them with your butt).  Don't lean with your back cause you'll lose your balance  Jump at the right time."
Basketball,38b6n2,purepg10,2,Wed Jun 3 03:54:05 2015 UTC,"Size and jumping ability aren't always a large part of rebounding - see Kevin Love and Dennis Rodman.   The keys to rebounding is positioning and being first to the ball.   Boxing out is a great idea, but without the chase aspect (running after the ball, the box out is only good to keep the ball out of your mans hands).   As far as positioning, if you find yourself too deep under the basket, get low and drive your man back.   Another positioning tip, most shots will fall off to the opposite side of where the person shot from (something like 7 out of 10 do that). If you're focusing on rebounding specifically, try to get in the habit of running to the other side of the rim of where the shot is coming on shot attempts. That'll put you in the vicinity of 70% of rebound opportunities."
Basketball,38b6n2,euroballer,2,Wed Jun 3 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"Don't worry that you don't understand boxing out, neither does 90% of NBA players ;) It's a skill that has gone out of the league, like being able to hit an open 2 point shot or dribble without carrying.  Anyway, at 6'1'' you are going to struggle to really clean up the boards if you play with adult bballers at any serious level. You didn't mention your age, so maybe you will grow?  What you can do is this:  1) Boxing out of course is key, but boxing out only works if everyone does it. It really is easy too, just turn around, spread your arms out to the side and know where your guy is. If everyone on the team does it, then it's tough for the opponent to get an offensive rebound.  2) Get strong. Work on your core and leg strength. A good strength training program with a coach who knows what he is doing with squats and deadlifts. You want to be like a rock, where even bigger players can't move you out of position.  3) Be tough and be agressive. The battle for rebounds it the toughest part of basketball. You'll get hit and bumped and some players will be dirty. If you want to see what kind of tenacity you need, go watch Dennis Rodman, Charles Barkley and Tristan Thompson today. They are all extremely aggressive and tough. EXPLODE for the rebound, no weak effort, go up and claim it, scream if you must.  4) Securing the ball. Again, go watch some highligts of Barkley and Rodman. Get the ball with TWO hands. Bring it down, ELBOWS OUT, twist a little if you must. Don't allow others to try to steal it.  Rebounding is also somewhat inborn. A combination of size, strength and awareness. Some players have a sixth sense of where a rebound will fall. Think one step ahead and get in rebounding postions INSTANTLY when a shot goes off. Don't stand around looking."
Basketball,38b6n2,Swish31,2,Wed Jun 3 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"Effort. 90% of rebounding is all about effort. You need to have that motor to get after those balls and the determination to get them. If you got that, then the rest will come easy."
Basketball,38b6n2,Parker0615,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:35:48 2015 UTC,You also wanna try to time your jumps so that you can jump as high as possible and grab the ball at the peak of your jumps.
Basketball,38b6n2,wertexx,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:23:44 2015 UTC,"As the other comment already mentioned, being active and aggressive is a very big part of it. Let's say talk about rebounding in a pick up game, you probably seen that guy who runs to the rim after every shot, who hustles and jumps for each rebound, he's usually the one getting most rebounds. People tend to put not nearly as much effort in rebounds as they would say on offense. Might or might not be your case."
Basketball,38b6n2,FoldableClock,2,Wed Jun 3 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. If you want to be that guy who's constantly getting rebounds, you can't be lax about it, you need to focus and put energy into it."
Basketball,38b6n2,kevdaproblem,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:54:31 2015 UTC,"You have got to be a ball hawk. Watch closely during the finals and just pay all your attention to Tristian Thompson. He want the ball every time it goes up. He uses his lower body strength, big butt, and timing to chase down all those offensive rebound. If you watch old highlights of Dennis Rodman he spent the majority of his time on offensive just positioning himself for the rebound and out muscling his man. If you play out on the perimeter try to cut in without getting boxed out all stealthy like. If you are crafty you can be one of those guys where the defensive is like where the hell did he come from?"
Basketball,38b6n2,smithy006,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:26:02 2015 UTC,"OK a few points, much like what others have said:  1) Effort, rebounding is mostly effort. 2) Know where the other players are, if you are up against much bigger and better rebounders you need to box out. 3) Positioning.  Always be conscious of where the shot is going up and get ready to get yourself in the right position.  3 point shots if they bounce, will bounce off the rim likely further away than close shots in the paint.  Look at where the player is shooting his shot and try to estimate where it'll bounce if it bounces off.  Pro Tip: Most players have favourite shooting places and when they miss it's generally a consistent type of miss.  Look for patterns some players when they miss shots they'll bounce off regularly in certain ways, this will help with positioning yourself.    Lastly, have good teammates that box out too! Rebounding is a team effort!"

I would recommend staying off of it as long as possible, and going to PT if you can.  They use ultrasound heat therapy which can speed up healing.  I would also say that once you are finally healed, make sure to do a good job of stretching before/after you play, and also to ice after.    In the meantime hit the bike/elliptical machine at the gym so you don't get too out of shape. I'd also just start doing a ton of calf raises and stretch every day.  Good luck."
Basketball,387xvc,champagne_of_beers,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:07:23 2015 UTC,"THanks for the input. Most of what I've been able to find on it comes from runners, and a lot of the advice recommends not over stretching the tendon while it's healing, they seem to recommend using a foam roller on the calf, but not go crazy beyond that.   Did you have success w/ calf raises? I ask as the eccentric heal drops which seem to be the most recommended rehab I can find emphasise using your non injured leg to raise you to the starting position, and not use your injured leg in that calf raise type excercise.   Thanks for your time."
Basketball,387xvc,champagne_of_beers,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:21:12 2015 UTC,"I would agree that while it is healing you should be cautious.  I generally used the calf raises after the tendon somewhat healed so I could build strength.  I would do about 3 sets of 12-15 calf raises, and stretch in between.  I also would frequently ride the bike at the gym and stretch before/after. But I would also say the ultrasound heat therapy was also very key, along with having my physical therapist massage the tendon."

Basketball,386c6e,MindAlchemist,6,Tue Jun 2 04:06:28 2015 UTC,"Others have it right, you can fight for position using your hips and legs, and usually get away with it. Just be careful not to push with your arms, because that will get called right away.   For the second part of your question, the best ways to overcome being boxed out:   Box in. If the rebound's going long, and your opponent is in close, plant your front foot in between his, so you are more or less perpendicular to your opponent, place your near arm in the middle of his back, so he can't spin, and reach up and out with your back arm to grab any rebounds that bounce over your opponent. Be sure to not push off with your inside arm if you move away to chase a ball. Step back. When the defender turns his back to box you out, step back. He won't be able to get a good seal, and you can zip around. This is extra good if there was already space between you, or if he turns his back without first establishing contact. Spin. Get to the defender before he can box you out, as he's either facing you or turned sideways. Get close, spin around him as he boxes out, going the same direction he turns his body. Swim. Once an opponent has you boxed out, you can still get around him. One technique for doing that is to ""Swim"". Bring your arm up to just underneath your defender's. Swim through, as if you were doing a backstroke, pushing your defender's arm and shoulder backwards. At the same time, step forward with the same leg, in front of your defender. If you do it right, you are now in position to go chase a ball.    If any of that isn't clear, you can probably find videos on youtube, or let me know, and I'll find some.  EDIT: I don't feel like I discribed the swim well. Here's a clip of the Swim move going over, you can do the same going under.   And then here's a clip of starting the swim move, and adjusting to your defender's reaction, and turning it into a spin."

Basketball,386c6e,EhrmantrautWetWork,2,Tue Jun 2 06:45:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah you need to push them with your lower body, at least enough force to nudge them under the ring so you can grab the rebound.

When we have a full-sized court, we play 5-on-5, but occasionally we have to play on a middle school-sized court, where we play 4-on-4. Every time we switch from the smaller court to the larger one, there is an adjustment period. People forget how to play with two extra guys on the court and the games are clumsy and congested until people adjust. The adjustment doesn't take more than a few games. My best advice would be to keep at it. I bet you'll get more comfortable after a short while."

Basketball,37vik8,xC6H1206x,1 point,Sat May 30 23:09:07 2015 UTC,"I hate full court pick up games cuz either people foul too much, cherry pick, don't get back on defense and get too tired easily. Half court, people get more intense and don't get too lazy to run down the court."
Basketball,37vik8,thesealwhisperer,3,Sun May 31 05:44:40 2015 UTC,You're playing with the wrong people.
Basketball,37vik8,Saucy_Totchie,1 point,Sun May 31 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"I have a few thoughts on the matter.  One is that the spacing is just completely different, and a much higher level of court vision is required to be a good player in a full court game.  There's more space, more things happening behind you, and just more people.  Another one is something you touched on in a comment, that the tempo and rhythm of the game is completely different in the full court.  Especially in pick up games people tend to play fast.  Personally, I enjoy full court games much more.  It just feels right to me to really stretch my legs and run up and down the court like that."
Basketball,37vik8,goingtobegreat,1 point,Sun May 31 21:18:29 2015 UTC,It may be due to more people which means less chances for you to get the ball.  In a 3v3 your teammate has only 2 options to pass to: your other teammate or you.  In a 5v5 there are 4 people (options) your teammate can pass to including you.  Plus when you play 5v5 you have to play full court which means running up and down the court which really destroys your stamina.  Getting up and down really kills you even after like 3 times.
Basketball,37vik8,aznsniperx3,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"In my experience, full court requires a higher basketball IQ, knowing where all the players are on the court and knowing what they're going to do. From your comment it sounds like your struggles are on offense, so I'll comment on that. But as stated in other comments, bad defensive players can be more easily hidden on the court with help defense and less costly double teams, so you can't dominate your match up could be a problem. Interestingly, I saw a lot of improvement by working on my court vision and knowing how to make the right pass to make the defense work. This also leads to more flow on offense which will make it easier for everyone including yourself to score. Another thing I notice for new full court guys is they push the offense too much, you need to slow it down and play that half court game and use it to your advantage."

Basketball,37v5l4,SeriouslyRelaxing,3,Sat May 30 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"Never really thought about it but I'd say glancing at both.  I'm trying to anticipate the rebound so if I see its going short I crash front rim for the low rebound.  If it looks back-rim I look for someone to box-out as that ball is likely to stay airborne.  If you stare that's usually all you're doing.  If I'm the one who's shooting I'm not really staring at the rim either.    I'm looking at everything in front of me, particularly the D.  When I set my feet and jump for the shot I'm looking rim, as I release I'm aiming weight and arc and after release I'm anticipating rebound... If its a lost cause I'll back peddle and play D"

Basketball,37v5l4,locdogjr,1 point,Sat May 30 20:47:50 2015 UTC,Wvwry shooting coach I have ever had says to watch the ball.  You are aiming at a fixed location and you want to keep your eyes on the target. I try to keep my eyes on the rim and visualize the ball swiahing through by tucking just under the back of the rim. Some people picture it just rolling over the front of the rim.
Basketball,37v5l4,nascar98,1 point,Sun May 31 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"I look at the rim and i did try to break habit and look at the ball, but i feel like i focus too much on trying to look at the ball so then my shot is more off.

Basketball,37v5l4,thesealwhisperer,1 point,Sun May 31 05:46:21 2015 UTC,"Rim while you're shooting, ball once it's in the air to try and figure out where it's going.  It's stupid to watch the ball too much because then you aren't dialed in on your target enough, but just as stupid to stare at the rim the whole time because you won't have a chance at an offensive rebound."

Basketball,37thbj,boxmonster123,2,Sat May 30 06:48:28 2015 UTC,It all depends on how comfortable you feel jumping. I'm a two foot jumper and I jump hella higher off two than one. I've tried one foot multiple times and it just didn't feel right. You just have to see what feels right. Practice doing both.
Basketball,37thbj,Spoon3330,2,Sat May 30 11:19:24 2015 UTC,"Piggybacking off /u/danozi:  Having both in your game is most ideal as there is a time and place for both, especially w/r/t finishing.   1 foot = clear path to the basket as taking off with one foot is quicker and gives you more extension to the rim.   2 foot = anytime your shot has a chance of getting blocked. Gives you more power and control. Allows you to stay grounded more easily to use fakes."
Basketball,37thbj,purepg10,1 point,Sat May 30 17:02:47 2015 UTC,"You seriously don't know straight up if you jump higher off one or two? Generally it's pretty obvious straight up, and usually one foot take off wins for height, but the trade off is you're not jumping as vertical as you do from two feet.   Great to be able to do both and get both good, but you'll discover a preference. Don't focus on one vs. the other, learn to incorporate both into your game. I could always get MUCH higher off one foot, but could control my body better off a two foot jump. So...one foot jump was better for me in offense, two foot in defense.  Edit: Will qualify, I was getting above the rim for a variety of dunks very easily using either one or two foot jumps, so not knowing what height you're getting now YMMV."
Basketball,37thbj,danozi,1 point,Sat May 30 13:46:57 2015 UTC,it depends on how you're driving in. I prefer one foot jumping tho because i feel i have a lot more momentum that way.
Basketball,37thbj,nascar98,1 point,Sun May 31 06:20:31 2015 UTC,Once you become accustomed to it your jump will almost definitely be higher off one foot. I've never met anyone who could jump higher off two feet.

For me, my 2013 HD grip is better, but you're not going to be slipping in the 2014.  One common issue with the 2014 Hyper Dunks is that the herring bone traction peels away in certain areas.  This observation is consistent with 4 different hyper dunks of different shoe sizes and different players.  This only happens after a good amount of usage.

Basketball,36wfm8,gtj,8,Fri May 22 18:03:06 2015 UTC,"Harden was double teamed and passed it to a wide open superstar teammate who panicked and passed him the ball right back, even though he was still doubled up. Dwight Howard had plenty of room and time to make a play, but was scared. It's like Jordan to Kerr, only this time ""Kerr""(Howard) choked. There is another difference: If Micheal Jordan passes you the ball in that situation, you take the shot because he trusts you to. Harden doesn't command that type of respect because he's basically told his teammates HE needs to be taking that shot, not them."
Basketball,36wfm8,pwnjones,4,Fri May 22 23:37:16 2015 UTC,More like he passed to Dennis rodman. Kerr could actually shoot

Basketball,36wfm8,SeriouslyRelaxing,5,Sat May 23 00:47:56 2015 UTC,I thought he was resetting Harden's dribble. That's why he passed it back. Harden even asked for it back. But a real superstar would've taken that shot regardless of what your captain says. When u saw the replay and he had a wide open lane I was perplexed as to why he gave it back to Harden. But I watched it again and Harden asked for it back.

Basketball,36vssn,Cptcongcong,4,Fri May 22 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely go with the Steph Curry full extension.  That is considered much more conventional form.  None of us on here are even remotely close to Ray Allen's level of skill, practice, or detailed preparation, which is really why that form works for him.  If you notice, the ball has very little spin when Ray Allen shoots it, and having no spin is generally considered a bad thing.  He may be one of the greatest shooters of all time, but that certainly doesn't mean the average person should try to emulate his particular shot."
Basketball,36vssn,thesealwhisperer,1 point,Fri May 22 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"It's less about trying to emulate it, more of it's already happening. Like Mr Allen I jump pretty high on my jump shot, like 20-25 inches. I try and sway forwards but the problem is I can't get a really high arc like I do on free throws. Idk how to fix this."
Basketball,36vssn,thesealwhisperer,2,Fri May 22 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"I would personally take a little time to change form then.  The person whose form I would most try to copy is Klay Thompson.  That dude has an beautiful mechanical release.  By that I mean it is quick, efficient, and textbook.  I'm attaching a link that shows him shooting in slow motion for reference.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN_n1RIr1C4  Look at his shot, from the base all the way through the release.  Feet just a little more than shoulder width, elbow directly over his knees, hands ready before the catch.  Good jump on his shot.  Eyes always on the target.  Pretty much a perfect 90 degree angle with his shooting arm.  Guide hand does nothing more than hold the ball in place.  High follow through.  Fully extended elbow.  Lands right where he jumped from.  Textbook."
Basketball,36vssn,arceusnormal,1 point,Fri May 22 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"It is flat out wrong to land with your feet where you jumped from, even Klay Thompson's feet come forward when he shoots.

Basketball,36vssn,Bigg_Nutts,1 point,Sun May 31 02:46:59 2015 UTC,"If you're doing the ""cookie jar"" method and pointing your fingers into the basket to aim you just need to being your release point a little higher in your field of vision.   For example, instead of pointing your fingers directly into the basket, release the ball to where your fingers point down into the basket about 2 feet above it (in your field of vision)."
Basketball,36vssn,Nomascus25,1 point,Fri May 22 20:40:44 2015 UTC,"Rebuild/redesign your form. Start a few feet from the basket and shoot it with your new desired form (Steph or Klay are great role models), making sure to shoot it with a high arc. As you become more comfortable, and it doesn't feel like you're fighting muscle memory to shoot it anymore, start to slowly move backwards and reincorporate jumping into this new form.   Source: I've completely rebuilt my shot mechanics. I always had good touch on the ball, but I used to shoot two-handed. This takes a lot of time, and short-term you're going to be frustrated with how ugly your shot feels and how it seems like you made it more consistently before. Fight through this. Eventually the new form will take over and you'll unconsciously shoot it how you want. Again, this takes a lot of time and a lot of practice. But ball is life."
Basketball,36vssn,GuttermanBrigadier,1 point,Sat May 23 23:56:43 2015 UTC,"I tell people, shoot up, not out, and it helps a lot with the arc. You'll probably be short on a lot of your shots at first, but compensate with wrist and you'll be good."
Basketball,36vssn,Bigg_Nutts,3,Fri May 29 00:59:11 2015 UTC,A full extension on your jumper will help with consistency because it will be the same every time. Where as not fully extending your arm can't guarantee it's the same. You might extend more on one jumper and less on another. It's Harder to control.  But like they said. Ray Allen isn't a good barometer for that type of thing because he's one of the greatest shooters ever. He put countless hours into perfecting his shot style. Reggie Miller didn't have picture perfect form either.
Basketball,36vssn,chiefff,2,Fri May 22 20:35:39 2015 UTC,Depends. Ray Allen jumps alot higher on his shot so he doesn't follow through as hard since his legs are there. Steph Curry follows through perfectly and retracts it very fast but doesn't jump as high on the shot.  If your the jumpy type of player that uses there hops as momentum for a shot then Ray Allens will be better. But if you stay low to the ground then Steph Currys is better.

ShotScience has some great form shooting videos, learn how to shoot properly when you start and you'll save yourself some huge headaches.  When you're playing your first games you probably won't be much of an offensive threat until your shot gets better, so focus on being a good defender. I have players in my team that have never played before but they go after the ball so hard on defense that they are hugely valuable to the team. Watch Tony Allen from the Grizzlies or videos of Ron Artest (who later became known as Metta World Peace) for examples of great defenders."
Basketball,36gmgn,Connector_Pens,4,Tue May 19 10:26:00 2015 UTC,Youtube. Honestly just watch videos on how to shoot and dribble. Also the most important thing is the FUNDAMENTALS. Look it up learn it live it and you will become a much better player. What I mean by FUNDAMENTALS is don't go on the court and just wing it practice layups free throws rebounding and boxing out don't play any pickup games until you are confident enough to know that you wont screw up. Watch NBA games see the offense and how a player defends. defense if key. before learning how to do crazy moves learn the game at a different angle first.

My fundamentals still need work since I never learned when I was young, but especially as someone who has played soccer for a large portion of your life, you have a lot of skills that will transition to the basketball court (vision, conditioning, etc.) My advice for when you're in a game is to play smart, don't underestimate the power of solid defense, and don't play selfishly. Make sure you take time out of your week to practice your form on jump shots and lay-ups, and soon enough you'll be able to really competent. Hope that helps a bit."

The team not shooting had the chance to tip the ball in on a miss. Each of those partners had one chance to tip. A made tip was worth 1 point. First team to 42 (exactly) wins the game.

I think if you bent your knees a little more and swung your arms up with more force you could add another inch to your vert. You don't seem to be exerting very much force. Honestly I would say practice dunking with a smaller ball and get in the weight room. You also look a little stiff so I would stretch every day.

Also when you go off two feet you tend to like going right foot then left foot(that's how I dunk) make sure you really get low and explode up. I'll link a video of me jumping so you can see what I mean. Also stretch all the time. Stretching is really good for your muscles and let's you jump higher.

Basketball,367pxt,180Coaching,1 point,Sun May 17 01:41:54 2015 UTC,2nd question its hard to change another persons shot if they are unwilling.  Your elbow will naturally flare out when your shooting hand is behind the basketball.  Your shooting hand should be on the side of the ball this helps keep the elbows in during your dip up through the release.

Basketball,367pxt,secretllamaman11,3,Sat May 16 23:58:04 2015 UTC,"Start close to the basket and work on elevating and engraining your form into your mind and body. When you find some consistency step out and work at it from there. It will take time, also pick one thing to work at in your form, whether it's keeping the elbow in, landing where you took off from or following through. Perfect it then move on, it will give you some motivation by showing yourself that you're improving, and if you pick something meaningful your jumper will improve. Hope that helps!, at the end of the day just get reps in (good reps) and you'll get better."
Basketball,367pxt,shimmyking45,2,Sun May 17 00:04:37 2015 UTC,Thank you!  One more quick question. Should my elevation remain the same regardless of where I'm taking the shot from? For example i find it necessary to get more elevation for  shots 15ft or less while my 3pt/long fg seem to require me to use less of it. Is that normal?
Basketball,367pxt,shimmyking45,3,Sun May 17 07:56:32 2015 UTC,"Your mind is telling you to use more arms because thats where the ball is resting. It is definetly normal to use more arms and less legs from behind the line, just make sure you're getting enough power to consistently get the ball up to the rim.  If you have any more questions feel free to ask!"
Basketball,367pxt,Morningstar15,3,Sun May 17 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"Should I shoot at the top of my jump, like the apex, or at the start of my jump? I've had many coaches and they all seem to have different answers Also, do I fully extend my arm when I shoot? I see plenty of players have a slight bend in their arm when they shoot? Thank, from a confused highschool player"
Basketball,367pxt,shimmyking45,5,Sun May 17 01:03:01 2015 UTC,"Always shoot at the top of your jump it lets you carry your momentum and helps with the overall flow of your jumper. The follow through is mostly a comfort thing from the wrist down. Flick the wrist and keep it high, but as far as a bend in the arm goes just be comfortable."
Basketball,367pxt,Morningstar15,2,Sun May 17 01:29:20 2015 UTC,Thank you! Appreciate it greatly.
Basketball,367pxt,chickendinner101,2,Sun May 17 06:42:40 2015 UTC,Wouldn't shooting at the top of your jump render your momentum useless?   At that moment you're going neither down or up so where is the momentum?  I would think it would be right before your apex so you could take advantage of the generated momentum.
Basketball,367pxt,lightning_strike1,2,Sun May 17 08:03:38 2015 UTC,"Reasoning behind this (at least from my dumb coaches) is that it gets you high enough so your defender can't block, it's also supposedly easier to consistently hit your shooting form from that position. Again not from me lol, these are my coaches"
Basketball,367pxt,Xlr8Stormz,1 point,Mon May 18 18:39:38 2015 UTC,"In theory, yes, that makes sense but I don't think that's game applicable.  Very rarely did Jordan hold the ball when trying to shoot it over a defender.  He would shoot right before his apex too.  It's all about using that momentum and conserving energy.    I'm sure those are the same coach's that teach archaic methods of shooting too!"
Basketball,367pxt,Xlr8Stormz,2,Tue May 19 17:50:40 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense. Stephen Curry for example releases very quickly after leaving the floor, well before the apex. I believe this also helps with a quicker release, and partly explains why his shot is so quick.  This video touches on the optimal release point, and one of it's main reasons for arguing for an earlier release is you conserve more energy from your legs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsT7gNLsX4c"
Basketball,367pxt,chickendinner101,2,Tue May 19 00:05:06 2015 UTC,"either way is fine. steph curry and james harden shoots at the start of their jump. kobe and lebron shoots at the apex. it just depends on how high you jump. if you're still confused, look up 1 motion vs. 2 motion"
Basketball,367pxt,Max_614,3,Mon May 18 05:49:01 2015 UTC,"Hi  I'm a shooter for my high school team. I'm known for being a pretty good shooter and an excellent defender. However, my jumpshot is not what I would like it to be. When I shoot I seem to get my thumb on my guide hand under the ball. Apparently this is very bad if you want to be a good shooter. Everytime I try to correct it though, if seems like I have no power under the ball and more often than not I airball it. How do I fix this?"
Basketball,367pxt,Richie_Tenenbaum,2,Sun May 17 02:58:14 2015 UTC,"Your guide hand really shouldn't be touching the ball when you release it. Look at Klay in this picture : http://warriorsworld.bayareaballllc1.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Klay-Thompson-Shooting-Ball1.jpg His guide hand is not touching the ball prior to his release. Work on completely removing the ""guide"" hand once you get it into your shooting pocket. That way there is no chance that your off hand can interfere with the spin of the ball. As far as no power goes, start close and work your way out, and make sure your legs are into it (obviously)  Hope this helps!"

Basketball,367pxt,letmebeeee,2,Sun May 17 04:46:53 2015 UTC,That's basically what I teach minus a couple of points. The guide hand really has no business being on the ball one you are near your release. It is only there to support the ball and make sure you don't lose it on the way up.
Basketball,367pxt,rchung68,1 point,Mon May 18 00:56:34 2015 UTC,"Larry Bird used to thumb the ball so there's still hope. But to fix this, when you're practicing your jumper, one suggestion is to tape your guide hand thumb up against the rest of your hand and take hundreds of shots and eventually muscle memory will build and your issue will be fixed. I learned this type of technique at a Rick amount shooting camp probably ten years back (1st high school athlete on a Sports illustrated cover)."
Basketball,367pxt,rchung68,3,Sun May 17 04:22:49 2015 UTC,What are the things you look for to determine if somebody is a fundamentally sound shooter?
Basketball,367pxt,rchung68,4,Sun May 17 04:12:25 2015 UTC,"Eyes at the rim, Elbow under the ball, and Following through high and flicking the wrist. All basic components of the jumpshot."
Basketball,367pxt,rchung68,1 point,Sun May 17 18:56:29 2015 UTC,I determine who is a fundamentally sound shooter by how they adhere to S.E.D.R.S shooting form philosophy.

Basketball,367pxt,LegatusDivintus,5,Sun May 17 00:09:40 2015 UTC,"When you're working out you have to put up game shots. When you work at ""game speed"" you force yourself into fatigue which simulates what is happening to you in a game.

Basketball,367pxt,clusterb,2,Sun May 17 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"I can hit a couple of jump shots when I'm just playing with myself but in games I never can hit any. Also, with a normal shot I'm pretty decent at it and accurate but when I do a jumpshot my accuracy goes to shit. Any help? Thanks"
Basketball,367pxt,MachinegunPoopy,6,Sun May 17 00:15:07 2015 UTC,"For the first part, you have to workout as if someone was guarding you or closing out on you. If you work at game speed you will not be overwhelmed when you have a defender in front of you during a game. For the second part, On your jump make sure you are landing where you jump from. If you sway or twist while in the air your accuracy will be thrown off and you will miss. To fix this you must be very conscious about your landing and ready to make adjustments during a workout. Also, don't start a the three point line and expect to fix your shot in a workout. Start close, focus on your landing, and work your way out as you improve. Hope this helps!"

Basketball,367pxt,MachinegunPoopy,3,Sun May 17 01:33:42 2015 UTC,"To improve your drive you have to learn how to read and react to the guy who's guarding you on the ball and the help once you get by him. Becoming instinctive with the ball is something that can only be done through playing and playing and playing some more. You can work on a read from a pick & roll or an off ball screen but in most situations you just have to experience it before you do in a game. As far as speeding up your drive work on being lower than the defender in front of you and in the gym work on explosive movements like holding a lunge and exploding to the rim. Stay/get in the weight room to increase strength in you lower body. Once you can get by anyone start adding in some advanced finishing moves, floaters, half-reverse, etc. Good Luck man! Hope this helped."

Basketball,367pxt,mulletprooftiger,4,Sun May 17 00:28:48 2015 UTC,Inconsistency usually stems from a lack of quality reps. Make sure that you are constantly tweaking and improving your shot. Never get complacent with how well you shot in the last game.  My biggest tip would be to Get in the gym!(Consistently) Hope this helps
Basketball,367pxt,mulletprooftiger,2,Sun May 17 00:35:05 2015 UTC,Do you teach sweep/sway?
Basketball,367pxt,TeevTeeForMe,3,Sun May 17 01:06:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you jump straight up and down you will end up missing short a high percentage of the time. The sweep and sway allows the body to move naturally. The more natural the better."
Basketball,367pxt,Aidenjp,2,Sun May 17 01:24:08 2015 UTC,how high do you recommend a jump shooter to jump? like the highest you can get or is a small and less exhausting jump enough?
Basketball,367pxt,Heatzy,3,Sun May 17 11:15:14 2015 UTC,If you look at some of the best shooters in the league you will see a variance of elevation when they shoot. Steph doesn't jump very high but his release is so quick that he won't get blocked much. A guy like Klay elevated a lot more so he can get the ball over the defender in front of him. Do what is comfortable and allows you to get your shot off over a defender. Hope this helps! Feel free to message me with any other questions
Basketball,367pxt,cam2188,2,Sun May 17 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"Hi, I hope I am not late to the party.  I have developped a pretty consistent mid range shot, but I really struggle behind the three point line. Mainly because my shots are short if I dont change my form drastically (like for example using a lot of force from my arms). So i basically fail to get the force from my jump into the ball. Are there any tips for that? Thanks!"
Basketball,367pxt,jmreicha,3,Sun May 17 11:57:14 2015 UTC,Try to cut out any wasted movements in your shot that take momentum away from your release. Make your jumper flow more and you will see great results.

Basketball,35xsmz,BW-Ryan,1 point,Thu May 14 14:15:41 2015 UTC,"It may be so in that case, but when doing the reverse pivot and step through the foot you use to step through should be the same one that you initially reversed with.   So if I am on the left block, I would want to reverse pivot using my right foot as the stationary pivot foot. I would then ball fake and step through to the Baseline side of the defender with my left foot. As long as my dribble goes down prior to picking up that right foot I'm fine."
Basketball,35xsmz,Higgs_Bosun,2,Thu May 14 14:29:57 2015 UTC,In general the pivot foot should be the one that is closest to the middle of the court? I always thought that a step through was most efficient when you would step over the defender right away rather than to the outside of him and then over him.
Basketball,35xsmz,_Duskyyy,1 point,Thu May 14 17:12:56 2015 UTC,I would recommend the pivot foot being the Baseline foot so you are able to step through with the high foot to have your hips and shoulders past the defender. I have seen a rare few people go into the middle using the opposite for a hook in the lane but it's not the standard way to teach it.
Basketball,35xsmz,Homeyjosey,3,Thu May 14 17:25:43 2015 UTC,"I think as important as having a good skillset is naming your dunks and having a relatable backstory.   In a game against the Kansas City Kings at Kemper Arena on November 11, 1979, Dawkins threw down such a massive dunk that the backboard shattered, sending the Kings' Bill Robinzine ducking. Three weeks later he did it again, this time at home against the San Antonio Spurs at the Spectrum. A few days after that the NBA ruled that breaking a backboard was an offense that would result in a fine and suspension.  Dawkins named the first backboard-breaking dunk ""The Chocolate-Thunder-Flying, Robinzine-Crying, Teeth-Shaking, Glass-Breaking, Rump-Roasting, Bun-Toasting, Wham-Bam, Glass-Breaker-I-Am-Jam.""[3]  He named other dunks as well: the Rim Wrecker, the Go-Rilla, the Look Out Below, the In-Your-Face Disgrace, the Cover Your Head, the Yo-Mama, and the Spine-Chiller Supreme. The 76ers also kept a separate column on the stat sheet for Dawkins’s self-created nicknames: ""Sir Slam"", ""Dr. Dunkenstein"", and ""Chocolate Thunder.""

Can most 6'2"" people that regularly play basketball dunk?  In my experience no.  Most can get rim, but not dunk it cleanly.  But you need to consider that the people I play with are a small, biased subset of people that regularly play--probably on the less-athletic side of the entire cross section.  Accounting for that bias, my gut still says that less than most 6'2"" players can dunk--I'd go with 40%.  That's not to say though that those players can't teach/train themselves to eventually be able to dunk."
Basketball,35woab,cag8f,5,Thu May 14 05:50:10 2015 UTC,Another minor thing is look at where you're jumping from.  I used to be able to do grab rim with both hands and still not dunk. Then I realized I was jumping from way to far away and now I can pretty regularly dunk at 6 feet.

I'm 6'2"" and there was a period in my life (19-21) where I could dunk fairly consistently, but just simple one handers. Now I can't anymore (almost 24). It really all depends on leg strength, how reactive you are, and how long your arms/big your hands are. Because some 6'2"" guys have a 6'2"" wingspan and that makes it hard, then you get guys like Rondo who's 6'0"" with a 6'9"" wingspan or something crazy like that."
Basketball,35woab,abrooks1125,2,Thu May 14 13:50:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly standing reach is a better indicator than height. Broad shoulders/long arms, these go a long way toward dunking. I'd even go as far as to say it's a big factor in the saying 'white men can't jump' when the reality is, black men have higher standing reach at a given height, often. I haven't tested this extensively, but I've been around 3 black basketball players the same height/age as I was (a normally-proportioned white guy - 5'10"", 17-20 years old, respectively). When we'd compare our standing reach, I could barely touch the lower part of their palm - they had 5-6"" longer/higher reach than I had.   TL:DR having a high standing reach can be a bigger factor than height"
Basketball,35woab,nightfly13,2,Thu May 14 13:47:03 2015 UTC,"You need to be pretty springy to dunk at 6'2"". I mean pretty dang springy.  The guys you play pickup with, they definitely have worked a LOT on it.   For perspective, I'm 6'4"" and can dunk, but I worked a LOT at it. Every other day at the weight room I'd be working on legs."
Basketball,35woab,urhedsonfire,3,Thu May 14 03:23:07 2015 UTC,are leg muscles really important for jumping higher?
Basketball,35woab,urhedsonfire,3,Thu May 14 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"90% of the time, yes. There are some outliers with some crazily insane innate fast-twitch fibers. If you remember Zach Lavine from the dunk contest, he's one of those outliers--he can just float forever. My close friend at UCLA is a manager and knew Zach pretty well when he was at UCLA. He says that Zach isn't that strong in his legs; he's just insanely reactive.  Leg muscles are important for propulsion but momentum is also a big thing. You can increase your gain from momentum by just trying to jump as high as you can, as much as you can. It doesn't really increase your strength a lot but it does increase your fast-twitch fibers."
Basketball,35woab,urhedsonfire,3,Thu May 14 04:02:13 2015 UTC,"hmmm, okay thanks! My quest for the elusive dunk..."
Basketball,35woab,wavecrasher59,2,Thu May 14 04:05:08 2015 UTC,"being able to palm the ball helps you get that first one in. When you're grabbing rim the dunk seems so close but honestly you probably need an extra 4-5 inches still. If you're grabbing the rim just try small for now, like try dunking with a tennis ball, then volley ball, then girls' ball, then for real"

Basketball,35woab,Foxdashman,1 point,Thu May 14 04:38:28 2015 UTC,It's all about getting the ball over the rim and down just keep trying at it I'm only 6 feet but I finally got it down
Basketball,35woab,spenrad,1 point,Thu May 14 05:28:23 2015 UTC,"Leg strength, timing, and hand size. I am 6'2"" and eventually was able to slam  off a single step under the basket. It took a lot of practice but I found all three to be key. A guy on my college team was 3 inches taller  but couldn't dunk... His hands were tiny so he had to be able to dunk with both hands. It's that last step that requires turning horizontal motion into vertical motion w/o Losing too much velocity... And being able to lengthen your body by only having to reach the rim with the ball in one hand.  I recall squats, and calf strengthening exercises helped."

Basketball,35woab,GetBackMF,1 point,Thu May 14 17:06:43 2015 UTC,I am only 5ft 8 and cannot dunk. What is even more bizarre is that I can jump higher and finish (lay up) on a regulation hoop...........but find it harder to shoot free throws and dunk on a shorter hoop. This is a total mindfuck. I should be throwing it down on that short hoop if my VJ makes me easily finish on a 10ft hoop. It makes no sense.

Basketball,35wbb5,spartyon99,1 point,Sun May 31 15:31:48 2015 UTC,"Well if it's a shooting foul you don't want it to go in obviously so the helper will normally try to swat it.   If it's a foul on the floor the offensive player will sometimes shoot it pretty much just for the hell of it. Some will call it practice. The defender will try to block it pretty much as just a mind game. Some people might think it's dumb.. I know I've seen Russell Westbrook almost injure himself doing it, but hell I'd do it to.

If I foul a guy going to block his shot after the whistle there is a good chance I get a flagrant or a tech.  Their is no downside for the offensive player to keep going but huge downside for the defender, not to mention at the hs and college numbers continuations are so few and far between most guys have it ingrained to stop at the whistle."

Basketball,35wbb5,hitmonwhirl,1 point,Thu May 14 12:24:23 2015 UTC,"I've wondered about this before also, and decided it came down to a combination of a few things.    Generally players stop when they hear the whistle, which is just a natural reaction after so many years of playing the sport.  Sometimes players also just get caught watching the play.  Also, it might not be worth the potential goaltending call if you don't think the shot is going in.  Lastly, sometimes people do...great offense beats great defense."
Basketball,35u9rq,zhdJaeYun,7,Wed May 13 15:46:35 2015 UTC,"Throw some headphones in, listen to your favorite music and just shoot and dribble by yourself. Work on making lay ups. It's the easiest shot in basketball and if you can cut to the basket and at least put the ball in the hoop you'll gain a respect level. And have fun while you play!"
Basketball,35u9rq,DJMackin,3,Wed May 13 15:52:04 2015 UTC,"Lay up is running towards the hoop and lifting the ball up right? Man, how do I improve my jumping capabilities."
Basketball,35u9rq,DJMackin,1 point,Wed May 13 15:54:36 2015 UTC,The best way to lay it up is off the backboard. Stand a foot away from the hoop and practice putting it off the backboard to get it in the hoop. The backboard is your best friend.
Basketball,35u9rq,NateOrLever,1 point,Wed May 13 21:50:56 2015 UTC,"Don't even really have to jump for a layup, or really jump in pick-up ball at all. Just focus on not turning the ball over when you get it, making solid passes and shooting when you're open. Don't be the guy that takes contested 3s all game, or the guy that can't even control his own handles, and you'll be fine."
Basketball,35u9rq,C_Larkin,4,Thu May 14 00:29:13 2015 UTC,"I second this advice.  In my experience, all that is expected of a beginner offensively is to take care of the ball when it is passed to you, and to make easy open shots.  For the former task, practicing dribbling will help you learn to ""take care of the ball.""  Similarly,  practicing lay ups will prepare you to make easy open shots.  It may also be good to work on mid range jumpers - if you're open in the game take the shot!  No one will be expecting you to drive to the rim and finish explosively (I.e. Don't concern yourself with vertical ability too much at this time), and no one will be expecting you to hit contested 3's either.  A player who can dribble, make open lay ups, and hit an occasional midrange jumper will be considered useful on virtually every pickup team."
Basketball,35u9rq,jackshepardlives,6,Wed May 13 16:21:18 2015 UTC,"Practice for hours a day, that's the simplest advice here but it's the correct answer. You cannot get any better without TONS of practice- also, you need to have passion for the game.   -Start watching basketball games, the NBA playoffs are on right now. Watch tutorials on YouTube. If you're not playing, you should be watching basketball.   You should also have a ball in your hand all day- dribble when you walk somewhere, just take the damn ball with you everywhere! Focus on the small things, the fundamentals like dribbling, the correct way to guard someone ( become a defensive specialist if all else fails, the guys would love to have you on their team, trust me) and proper shooting technique. GO get yourself a ball and don't let go! Msg me if you have any questions or just shoot me a msg on your progress, GL!   EDIT: Again, I want to stress the part about watching basketball videos, it's going to help with someone who isnt familiar with the game. Also going to stress, again, that you MUST get a ball and treat it like a damn baby. Take it everywhere with you! If it seems like I am a bit fanatical about this, it's because I am, I bleed out tiny little basketballs. ;)"

Basketball,35t8m0,downtownjj,3,Wed May 13 18:10:53 2015 UTC,2 steps. Completely legal and elegant as hell.
Basketball,35t8m0,Clavo_PR,4,Thu May 14 03:17:11 2015 UTC,"Legal.  I bet you are looking at the wrong foot.  His step is the pivot foot, not the back one.    What is confusing people is the fact that he picks up the ball mid spin.  He can still turn on his RIGHT foot (which is the foot he picked up the ball on) until he establishes a pivot.  When he plants his left, he makes that his pivot because his right foot is already up. This is his FIRST step.  Now that the spin is complete, he uses his SECOND step with his right foot, and subsequently jumps.   2 steps,  beautiful move.   His spin move is DIRTY."
Basketball,35t8m0,JewWithAFlamethrower,-1,Wed May 13 14:04:50 2015 UTC,"How is his left foot the pivot foot? His right foot is the one on the ground that is rotating. If he were to stop and then rotate with his right foot being the one on the ground he would be allowed to put his left foot down, but he wouldn't be allowed to then pick his right foot up and then place it down again to jump which is what he does"
Basketball,35t8m0,spenrad,2,Thu May 14 06:52:41 2015 UTC,"Imagine this scenario: you are driving down the lane, you pick up your dribble, you take your first step with your right leg, you take your second step with your left leg. Now stop on that left leg. Pivot. Boom."
Basketball,35t8m0,Sneezus_Christ,-1,Thu May 14 08:12:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, so in your scenario the left leg is the plant leg/pivot foot. This means that you could then pick up your right leg again and place it directly in front of your left (which is essentially doing a pivot of 180 degrees). How is this different that taking three steps seeing as you just went right, left, right?"
Basketball,35t8m0,JewWithAFlamethrower,1 point,Thu May 14 11:36:09 2015 UTC,"Hey man, sorry I know this was weeks ago but I saw it and wanted to mention since I didn't see it here that it's about the jump, not the feet, in the video. Since he jumps off both feet (the most important part of the spin) at the same time it doesn't count as a step from the last foot. You see people, including Parker, mess this up all the time by actually lifting the pivot foot and then jumping off the one last planted making it a travel. But if you lift off both feet then you essentially get some further reach on your spin without traveling.   Interestingly Dion Waiters does a fantastic version of the spin move himself where he solves the spacing problem on the front end of it, you should watch some of him.   So again sorry I know this was dead but I teach the spin when I train and wanted to share."

Basketball,35t8m0,Wish_Whisperer,1 point,Thu May 14 13:27:01 2015 UTC,"You are correct, his right foot is on the ground rotating, BUT that is the foot he picked the ball up on.  He is just spinning when he picks up the ball.     Watch the video slowly.  He picks up the ball and starts spinning on his right foot (left foot in the air).  He then steps (FIRST STEP) with his left (which is now his pivot foot).  He then steps (SECOND STEP) with his right and jumps.     If he wanted, after he stepped onto his left pivot foot, he could just stand there and rotate on it all he wants (moving his right foot)."
Basketball,35t8m0,The_Real_Bender,1 point,Thu May 14 13:21:00 2015 UTC,"By the strictest interpretation of the rules,  it's a travel.   When you plant and jump off two feet, your pivot foot (in Parker's move in the OP vid, his right foot) should not slide or move from pivot point. Parker looked like he jumped off two feet due to his quickness."
Basketball,35t8m0,JewWithAFlamethrower,-1,Sun Jun 21 06:36:20 2015 UTC,"Watching at full speed I would say no but upon replay it appears that it is a travel. However, in the NBA it's not unusual for the refs to ignore a third step (unless outrageous) as well as sliding feet... the Shaq hop step, Lebron crab dribble, etc."
Basketball,35t8m0,onwee,1 point,Wed May 13 21:04:14 2015 UTC,"He only took two steps when he picked up the ball.  He picked up on his right foot while spinning.  Then his first step was with his left (into the lane), and the second step is his right."
Basketball,35t8m0,clear831,-2,Thu May 14 13:38:32 2015 UTC,"Not a ref, but I do think it's ""technically"" a travel, although it's not egregiously so and will never get called.  Check out this video breakdown of the same move (starts at 0:59):  Right after Tony crossed over from right to left and plants his inside (right) foot, he picked up his dribble and is allowed 2 more steps. If his next steps were left-right--and at game speed that's how it looks--it would be a legal spin move. But when you slow it down you can tell Tony clearly bunny hops on the same inside (right) foot to get some separation before his left-right-jump. That's a travel, but with Parker's ridiculous foot speed it looks legal.  Get jump roping."
Basketball,35t8m0,TheManSedan,1 point,Wed May 13 15:55:52 2015 UTC,The gather during the spin allows him to take the steps. No travel.
Basketball,35t8m0,JewWithAFlamethrower,-2,Sat May 16 04:33:11 2015 UTC,I mean technically I think it is a travel. But it does it so quick that it is never going to be called. Because it wouldnt be a travel if out of the spin he jumped off both feet. Its only a travel because he picks up on foot 1/4 of a second before the other.
Basketball,35t8m0,TheManSedan,1 point,Wed May 13 19:41:20 2015 UTC,"He did jump off both feet. It doesn't matter if he does or not because he only took TWO steps.  He can jump off his second foot.  (He didn't pro hop).   He picked up the ball on his right foot (which he spun on).    He then stepped with his left (FIRST STEP, subsequently his pivot foot)  He then steps with his right (SECOND STEP). He can lift now jump off both feet or either one if it is in motion (because you are allowed 2 steps)."
Basketball,35t8m0,JewWithAFlamethrower,0,Thu May 14 13:31:04 2015 UTC,"Lol watch it at .25x speed. He clearly jumped off his left then right. Shit, hes even lifting his Left foot before the right hits the ground."
Basketball,35t8m0,TheManSedan,1 point,Thu May 14 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"He doesn't pick up the ball until his right is planted.  He spins on it then takes his two steps (Left foot, which is now pivot, then right foot)."

The truth is you want do do the following: -Squats -Deadlifts -Calf Raises -Plyometrics -Jumping    There are plenty of references on how to do these out there. The Squats, deadlifts and calf raises will strenghten your legs, the plyometrics and actual jumping will improve your vert and explosiveness."
Basketball,35odu2,KyrieMcIvory,3,Tue May 12 05:36:36 2015 UTC,Finishing puberty will do most of the work tbh. Otherwise search for vertical jump bible or other similar plyometric workouts.
Basketball,35odu2,papet2,2,Tue May 12 06:11:35 2015 UTC,"Plyometric training is what you want.  In simple terms, that is jump training.  Work on jumping for distance, jumping for verticality, work on quickly jumping immediately after landing.   The weight room helps obviously, so use your legs in the weight room.  A lot of younger people ignore leg exercises because they aren't show muscles."
Basketball,35n739,duhpolan,5,Mon May 11 21:51:50 2015 UTC,I've said it a couple of times so what you want to do is at first let your guy set up shop and see where he likes to park himself.   Lots of amateur post player have this one spot where they practice every moves. You want yo find this spot and what he likes to do(go left and shoot? Go right and drive? Back up?  Then after a couple times you have to pick him up at the 3pt line and be all in his feet in order to steer him away from that sweet spot. It will be a sumo type of fight but let him know that his feet are not welcome here(think of you brother/sister trying to get in your room when you clearly said no: push enough to keep them out the door but not to  push them 5 foot further).  You also need to widen your stance and hold position with a lower center of gravity and push right at the botttom of their back. Trying  to contest the shot is a waste of time if he's too tall( and your teammates are supposed to help when there is such a mismatch for so long).
Basketball,35n739,dont-YOLO-ragequit,4,Mon May 11 23:38:44 2015 UTC,Excellent tips! Footwork is the key to defense. Always be on your tows and steer you opponent where you want him to be.
Basketball,35n739,Clavo_PR,5,Tue May 12 01:31:44 2015 UTC,Play sneaky! For example when a big guy comes down with a rebound let him grab it but right when that ball is within reach bat it down out of his hand and get you a steal.  Source is I'm tall and short guys used to get me with this all the time
Basketball,35n739,slickricky60,1 point,Tue May 12 00:15:25 2015 UTC,There is a reason why post players are taught to keep the ball high ;)
Basketball,35n739,clear831,2,Wed May 13 08:25:11 2015 UTC,"Play 1-on-1 and 2-on-2 with people that are bigger than you. If they just use their reach to keep the ball away from you sometimes, fine. Let them shoot. They'll miss a lot of the time and you may be able to grab some rebounds. Use your arms, hips, and footwork to throw them off balance. As a small person you likely have more control over your body than they do-- use your strengths to your advantage."
Basketball,35n739,Dune17k,1 point,Tue May 12 04:31:49 2015 UTC,"Also, do you work early. Bigger guys will try to post you up so don't let them get to the block that easy. Know where you help is going to be at. If there's a teammate right behind you, try fronting the post. Force him to lob and he'll end up catching it straight to a double team or better yet his team mate will see that there's a guy behind and won't go post.   Use your speed to get him uncomfortable trying to catch that entry pass.   Play big. You may be shorter. But that doesn't mean you have to play that way. Make him work, make him uneasy on the block, use your team mates for help."

Basketball,35mhvc,Karnicorn,2,Mon May 11 18:46:07 2015 UTC,"You are correct. You have to lose control of the ball. If I go up for a bad shot and the defender gets a little bit of the ball, I'll just drop it so he touched it and I lost control. I am free to dribble again because the defense touched the ball without me being in control. If they touch it while you are holding it, it doesn't change anything. That's a double dribble if you dribble again."
Basketball,35mhvc,Sir_mix_a_little_bit,2,Tue May 12 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"If the defensive player jumps with the offensive player, gets his hand on the ball and both come down with the ball, it is a jump ball.

Basketball,35mhvc,BW-Ryan,1 point,Wed May 13 22:12:21 2015 UTC,"Yes but in this situation they both went up, the defensive player got his hand on top of the ball, the offensive player realized he couldn't get it up so he then threw it down to dribble it before his feet hit the ground.  What would that be?"
Basketball,35mhvc,clear831,1 point,Fri May 15 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"That is fine, because the ball was let go while both players had their hands on the ball. He can pick up the ball and dribble again."
Basketball,35mhvc,clear831,1 point,Fri May 15 20:53:01 2015 UTC,Yes but the ball wasn't immediately let go.  He pulled the ball away (down) from the defensive player but still had control.  Then he dribbled the ball because he had nowhere else to go.
Basketball,35mhvc,clear831,1 point,Mon May 18 19:11:10 2015 UTC,He can still dribble. He has the benefit that the defender could have knocked the ball out of his control.
Basketball,35mhvc,slickricky60,2,Mon May 18 19:27:04 2015 UTC,Talked to a ref today at my league basketball game.  He said that if he didn't lose the ball then he cannot dribble.  He said you can pretty easily tell if a ball was still in his control or if it got knocked away.
Basketball,35mhvc,J8l,1 point,Tue May 19 14:41:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right and the ref is right. If it is clear that he didnt lose control of the ball, then he cant dribble."
Basketball,35mhvc,sascottie11,1 point,Tue May 19 20:00:21 2015 UTC,Depends on the group of guys you play with in regulation it would most likely be jump ball depending on the ref.
Basketball,35mhvc,DemonSmurf,-3,Tue May 12 00:12:54 2015 UTC,If the defender touches the ball it is neutral and can be dribbled again. Basically it's as if you never dribbled.
Basketball,35mhvc,abrooks1125,2,Mon May 11 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"Really?  If that's the case could I jump up, realize I was screwed, intentionally just touch the ball to my defender and then start dribbling again?"
Basketball,35mhvc,Clavo_PR,2,Mon May 11 20:14:25 2015 UTC,As long as you're not just holding the ball and touch him. You can't have possession of it. You could throw it off of his legs or feet or something to and get it back

Cushion and protection for your ankles. Basketball is sport played with of awkward stop start and side to side movement. I would not recommend playing in running shoes because they are meant for linear forward running playing in running shoes is asking for a turned ankle.

Basketball,35d5xg,boom_bitch,4,Sat May 9 04:12:23 2015 UTC,Just keep dribbling. Dribble every where you can whenever you can. Search Google for Dribbling Goggles. They block your view of the ball and just run and dribble.
Basketball,35d5xg,watdodude,2,Sat May 9 04:53:51 2015 UTC,"There are so many great drills. There are two vital moves you should learn as a post and those are the regular crossover and spin move. If you plan on transitioning to guard, a between the legs, behind the back, and in-and-out, hesitation dribble are great to learn as well. In terms of drills, I would suggest two ball dribbling to make sure both hands are involved and both are being trained. In addition, have somebody stand in front of you and hold up a different number of fingers to make sure you're looking up. If nobody is around, pick a sign on the wall to read or just a spot in general to focus on. Another advanced drill which Earl Boykins (google him) used to do was dribbling with a tennis ball.  Googling will help you find great drills to use, but as previously stated, anything with a ball in your hand is good."
Basketball,35d5xg,DYELBretheren,4,Sat May 9 05:43:59 2015 UTC,"A good drill to do is run towards someone, stop and jab step when you get to them, and have them shove you as you're dribbling."
Basketball,35d5xg,pacifiedbanshee,5,Sat May 9 12:59:39 2015 UTC,"Just dribble as hard as you can. It'll help a lot. Also, a drill I know is to stand arms length from the wall, and dribble from left to right to left and so on. But when you have the ball in your right hand, touch the wall with your left, and when you have the ball in your left touch the wall with your right. I'm 6'4"" and 15, so I know what it's like."
Basketball,35d5xg,toad_mountain,2,Sat May 9 13:49:10 2015 UTC,"Run full court with the ball in left hand, make the lay up. Then go the other way with the right. Look up, don't look at the ball during this. Jump off of the right foot for the lefty lay up and off the left foot for the righty lay up. Repeat till you're tired. While you're catching your breath get low in the power stance and dribble the ball hard with the left then switch to the right when your left gets tired. Once you're legs recover a bit, go straight into the lay ups again. You'll run up court faster the more you practice this and you'll be able to sustain your speed and acceleration longer if you continue to do this drill.   Benefits: Full speed handles with both hands, and endurance to sustain hard dribbles in late game pressure situations.   Overall endurance  Speed  A bit of hops  The ability to make full speed lay ups with either hand jumping off either foot (a skill which the average baller simply does not have).   Aim for 3 circuits of this then work your way up if you like. Take it slow in the beginning and build up your speed as you get better and your endurance develops. The goal is to NOT LOOK AT THE BALL and to make the lay up."

Basketball,35akp6,thesealwhisperer,2,Wed May 13 08:33:17 2015 UTC,"Posting up against a zone is hard work, especially if there isn't enough good spacing by your teammates.  http://www.coachesclipboard.net/images/ZoneFrontsA.GIF  This link shows a very standard set up for attacking a 2-3 zone, and I would go so far as to say that there are only two times it will work for the 5 to post up.  First scenario: if one of the wing players has the ball fairly deep on the wing, and the 4 is on the ball side elbow, then the 5 may have a chance to post up the middle man in the zone.  Second scenario: if the 4 has the ball at the high post, and the wing player is a fantastic shooter, the 4 may be able to enter you the ball from the foul line area.  Note that this is contingent on the skill of the wing player, and also how likely the zone defenders are to collapse on the ball once it's entered.  In general, posting up against a zone is not a great plan.  Great ball movement coupled with timely screens and cuts is the easiest way to score."
Basketball,35akp6,mathlete91,2,Fri May 8 15:09:45 2015 UTC,"If it is a 2-3, you have to drag out the corner on the 3 with a wing and then post up the center.  At that point you got to make your move or that corner defender will be closing in and you will need to pass.  Honestly to post against a zone, the most important thing is going to be your teammates and their ability to knock down shots."

Basketball,35akp6,Dhalphir,1 point,Fri May 8 16:48:57 2015 UTC,You're not likely to be able to post up and score against a 2-3 zone. Your success with posting up will only come if your wings can knock down threes.

A lot of times when you try to post in the zone you either need to look where the help is going to go. Who's cutting in between the gaps. Players tend to stay home during zone, so if the ball sticks in the post it'll be easier to either double you or trap you."

Basketball,34on3g,imbeethoven,5,Sun May 3 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"Can't really agree with that.  The Spurs have gone out in the first round before during the Duncan era.  I think that some of the best basketball in the playoffs so far took place in that series.  It took miraculous plays on both sides just to stay in games, much less win them.  And both teams were easily finals contenders.  Could you imagine if the Clippers played the Nets?  Or the Spurs played the Celtics?  Or even if either team played a lower seeded Western Conference team?  I don't think one lost series which went to 7 games, 5 of them so closely decided, can be the end of any teams reign."
Basketball,34on3g,variablesquid,-2,Sun May 3 05:37:31 2015 UTC,But was Duncan 39 years old and Manu and Tony also nearly the same age?
Basketball,34on3g,variablesquid,5,Sun May 3 05:46:58 2015 UTC,"Take a look at Duncan's numbers this season.  Or this series.  He's made major contributions and is still one of the best power forwards in the league right now, 39 or not.  Manu is 36 and Tony is only 32.  People have been saying the Spurs are too old for 4-5 years now.  Hasn't stopped them from getting 50 win seasons, making the playoffs, or winning the championship when Duncan was 38.    The Spurs are far more than Duncan.  Kawhi is the new face of the franchise.  But R.C. and Pop are long from done in my opinion, as are the majority of the other players.    Again, I think calling the reign over after such a hard fought and well played series like that is very premature.  Any other playoff pairing and both the Clippers and Spurs are on to round two playing ball like they were."
Basketball,34on3g,variablesquid,0,Sun May 3 05:56:31 2015 UTC,You're also presupposing Duncan's return next year. Parker and Ginobli have a rhythm established with Duncan. With him gone gone next season I only need to point to Bosh and Wade for aging accomplices wishing for the remainder of their Big 3 to retain relevance in today's game
Basketball,34on3g,kwilly15bb,5,Sun May 3 06:01:08 2015 UTC,"I don't believe I am presupposing that.  The Guard is changing.  Parker doesn't need Duncan, though it does help.  Kawhi doesn't need Duncan, though it does help.  Duncan will retire eventually, and though they can never replace him, Spurs ball isn't about one player.  That's is where your analogy fails.  In the difference in the Heat's system versus the Spur's system.  Boris Diaw was a key player in the Clippers series and really all season.  Boris.  Diaw.  The Spurs have a system which utilizes every player in a super efficient way to make something better than the sum of the players' talents.  The Spurs are not Duncan, nor Parker, nor Kawhi.  The Spurs are the Spurs."

I'm constantly popping into open space and making myself available for the pass.

If he can rifle it upcourt and isn't afraid of taking the gamble, I can get a couple of easy uncontested layups. In the half court, I tend to like selfless, no-iso offense where the ball swings from side to side. If I player does not have vision/is selfish with the ball, I tend to not have as much fun. I love making the extra pass, sometimes to a fault. I'd rather get my teammates the score than myself. Usually get my points off spot up shooting or coming off a screen.

I ask this because I went to a game where there was just 1.1 second left, and one of the teams makes the first pass (from outside to the game after a point), the player passes again, and that one does a amazing throw and scores. The thing is, the play took more than 1 second, and referees went to see the replay and considered valid, and a guy said the time just starts to countdown after the first pass, and I just want to know if that is true, other wise it was a bad call."
Basketball,33yqf1,THOUROUGH_CAT_LICKER,2,Mon Apr 27 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"When he said ""after the first pass"" I'm pretty sure he meant after the inbounder (player outside of the court looking for someone to get the ball) passes it inside, and then a player on court touches it.   In your scenario,  once the first player receives the ball, referees count the time. So, in one second, the player must have gotten the ball, passed it to his teammate and then the teammate shot the ball to the basket*. Otherwise it would not count.    The player must release the ball completely from his hand before the game ends for it to count as a basket. Otherwise, it doesn't count."

Basketball,33nbfv,DEEP_101,4,Thu Apr 23 22:33:52 2015 UTC,"First you should make sure you do well on defense.  One good way to beat the zone is to make sure they don't have time to set.  So getting transition buckets is key.  Also you need a ton of ball movement and player movement.  Get the zone to react to one person, then swing the ball until you find an open shot/lane.  Also getting into unoccupied spots where the defense has their head turned is a good way to get to the lane.  As you say you have players who drive, have another player cut backdoor as the defense reacts to the ball and make the easy pass.  You can easily work inside out with this."
Basketball,33nbfv,SaucyTotchie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:44:54 2015 UTC,"What he said:  good shooting and transition.     getting into unoccupied spots where the defense has their head turned    In the half court set, a basic strategy is to send one of your taller/better shooting/better passing players to the free throw line and have someone pass to him.  At the same time, make sure there are 2 players on the baseline, near the paint (or at least have players cutting to these positions).  This is typically an awkward ball position for the the zone to react.  You should see that the player catching the ball in this position will have numerous offensive options.  He may have an immediate open 10 foot jump shot.  Or if one of the inside zone players commits to him, one of the two aforementioned baseline players should then become open.  Or he may be so open that he can take a dribble or drop step and lay it in.  I've typically had success with that in pick-up games, when some teams try to go zone.    Try it out in practice."

Basketball,33nbfv,balla21,2,Sun Apr 26 17:50:20 2015 UTC,"Attack the gaps. High post in against a 2-3 and corners against a 3-2. Getting out in transition so you don't have to play against it is effective but could lead to more turnovers due to increased pace. Patience really is key, the longer that defense has to guard the worse they get."
Basketball,33nbfv,Daucremann,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:44:47 2015 UTC,"First and most effective way is shoot 3s. But you said that you only had one 3pt shooter, you can create plays to set him free.  The other one is fast-breaks. Setting for zone takes time, so if you play tight D and create opportunities for transition plays, they can't set for a good zone."

Basketball,33mubc,kha-blam,2,Thu Apr 23 22:11:38 2015 UTC,"I would definitely concentrate on working your leg muscles and also your core. All your strength comes from those areas. Exercises that should be the cornerstone of any regiment are definitely squats and, if you can do them properly, cleans.   Aside from those two exercises, you should focus on the entire musculature of the legs including glutes, calves, hamstrings, and quadriceps. Many people ignore the glutes, but it's one of the most important muscles to activate when running or jumping.   I really think that getting stronger in those areas could really make a difference in your explosiveness and jumping ability. Also, finally, there's a right and wrong way to jump. Look up a youtube video in regards to jumping form. The best athletes eventually move from two footed jumps to one legged jumps that are much more fluid for movement. Good luck!"
Basketball,33mubc,XwithMan,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"Low bar squats will improve your entire lower body strength and power cleans will give you the explosiveness you need to accelerate your body and jump high.  If you don't have access to barbells, look for a plyometrics workout."

Basketball,33g6de,samdaMFman,12,Wed Apr 22 09:27:01 2015 UTC,"If your form isn't ideal yet, I wouldn't even start with 3s. Get a proper form inside of 15ft then slowly work outward. It will be easier to focus on form at a closer range where you won't tire out as quickly and don't need to put all of your strength into each shot. If you truly need both hands to shoot from behind the arc, you will need to slowly build up to shooting from that far, or hit the gym and get stronger to be able to properly shoot from distance. My biggest problem was that my form deteriorated right before the 3 line, and as a result, did my shot percentage. If you aren't making a higher percentage of shots inside the arc, it doesn't help much to keep shooting from behind it."
Basketball,33g6de,Stone_P,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:42:32 2015 UTC,hit the gym and get stronger to be able to properly shoot from distance.   That doesn't really matter a whole lot. You can never work out and still have NBA range if you have good form and use your legs.

Move over 12 inches and shoot 20 more. Work your way around the arc until you feel comfortable from anywhere.   Then work on stepping into them from anywhere on the arc. Then work on step-back 3s. Then work on stepping to your right or left with one dribble. Then work on a pump fake.   They might seem hard at first but you just gotta put reps in. Practice, practice, practice, and next thing you know in, you'll be in a pick up game, get an open look for a 3 and drain it just from instincts."

I've made the change myself and I've become significantly more accurate, especially because it's harder to block me. That said, the switch was miserable. I shot 10x worse than I did before and every shot was inconsistent because I would release at different times, sometimes my shots would go left, sometimes right, other times my arm just got tired. Even now its still inconsistent but much less so. I never was able to drain threes in a game in anyone's face but now if I'm feeling it I can actually make it."
Basketball,33g6de,DeathsIntent96,2,Wed Apr 22 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"What I've found to help me the most was really getting my form down. You say that you shoot two-handed, so the first step is to get you to be comfortable shooting one-handed. What I did to make that same change, was to get close to the basket, maybe just a couple steps out and shoot with one hand, whichever one is more dominant. But use form! Keep your eyes on the basket, squat to use your legs, tuck your elbow in, and follow through. Don't use your off hand at all! After you step further and further from the basket, start incorporating your off-hand to just guide the ball there. Range and technique comes with time and practice. Good luck!"

Basketball,32w1dj,ItsCouldveNotCouldof,6,Tue Apr 21 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"Yes they can help, but in my experience you are better off doing ankle mobility exercises to strengthen your ankles and feet. I've rolled my ankles really badly twice in the past (out for about 6 weeks at a time) and both times I was wearing high tops. I put a lot of effort into strengthening my ankles and can comfortably play in low tops now which I wouldn't have dreamed of doing in the past.

Basketball,32w1dj,lazpsych,2,Fri Apr 17 10:04:32 2015 UTC,High tops don't prevent ankle rolling.  It all comes down to the base/sole of the shoe.  Getting a good sturdy sole will reduce the risk.  Also wear an ankle brace.  After getting hurt you should remember to do some small exercises to help strengthen your ankle to rehab it.

Basketball,32w1dj,jkimboslixe,1 point,Fri Apr 17 08:48:42 2015 UTC,"More important than high tops is to check the stiffness of the sole and how much torsion the body of the shoe has. If it is fairly flat and stiff it helps to keep your foot stable. Plus do lots of ankle strengthening exercises, standing on one foot, then with eyes closed, then with a rolled up towel under your foot. Practice hopping on one foot onto and off an uneven surface."
Basketball,32w1dj,collkiwi,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:35:42 2015 UTC,"No it won't help, here's a copypaste of a comment I made before with a similar question.   That's actually a common misconception, some material won't stop you rolling your ankle if you step on somebody or from making a hard cut, it's actually due to how secure the mid-foot, the ankle and the heel of the foot is. The more secure the ankle the less likely an ankle injury will occur. If a low top shoe securely stops heel slippage and has great mid-foot lockdown then it will provide the same amount of ankle support as high top shoe with the same amount of midfoot lockdown etc. Also the reason Kobe's shoe's became high tops were not because he wanted more support, but because he was inspired to make them such a high top after seeing boxing shoes. The flyknit material won't stop him from injuring himself and he knows that. Source: I am a performance basketball shoe fanatic who spends too much time reading about this stuff   If you want some shoes that actually stop ankle rolling, look into Ektio basketball shoes they are the only shoe on the market that are designed to stop ankle sprains."
Basketball,32w1dj,gordonderp,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:48:31 2015 UTC,"Minimally. The biggest issue with ankles rolling out is from your foot not being locked down over the center of the sole. If your foot is going to roll, it will do it in high tops or low tops. You could always get braces, but hard braces can be trouble, because if your ankle wants to roll and it can't, it can lead to a break higher up your shin.

Basketball,32w1dj,clear831,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:29:53 2015 UTC,"When I was younger, this was a constant problem for me to the point where I severely sprained both of my ankles and surgery was undoubtedly in the future if I didn't remedy the issue. I did 2 things: not sure which worked, but ultimately I don't roll my ankles (at least more than the normal person) anymore.       Like you suggest, I switched to hightops and I never looked back. They do limit your ability to cut a tad, but the comfort and peace of mind when jumping is 100% worth it.       I also started wearing shoes that were a half a size smaller. What I found out is shoes mold to your feet differently (depending on the model and brand), and people a lot of the time are too attached to their shoe size they haven't checked in 10 years. Regardless of the reasoning, this helped me immensely. Not sure if it will do the same for you, but I hope I helped. Good luck with the ankles, I know this situation can be a real bitch."

When you go shopping for a ball, make sure you take it out of the box and test it out.  Don't just grab one off the shelf and take it up to the counter for purchase.  If you can spin a ball on your finger, do it.  You would be surprised how many balls are out-of-round.  It doesn't have to spin perfectly but you don't want a major wobble."

Take a towel and place it on the court (indoors), then put both hands down and push/slide from baseline to baseline, do lunges from baseline to baseline in between the towel slides. Run suicides or lines. Some people are born with a natural jumping ability but that doesn't mean you can't maximize what you have.  When you lift you need to focus on every muscle in your lower body, not just your quads. Core strength is also very important. Also get out and practice jumping, grab the net, slap the backboard, grab the rim, once you get past that use the sweat on your hands to leave a mark on the glass and try and beat it every day."

Basketball,32pbb7,jfzol,8,Wed Apr 15 16:56:48 2015 UTC,The fundamentals. Ball handling is key too. If you are below average. Work on that. If your right handed work on your left hand or vice versa. You can do this even inside your home. Learn a shot fake. A good shot fake is a good lie. Make your defender think you are really going to shoot it. Also if you are good in the post then get better in the post. Learn two moves that you can score with every time. Practice practice practice. But back to ball handling. Most people at the park can only go right. Learn to go left. Then go left in your pickup games early. Then when you need a bucket go to the post and do one of your two moves. Look up how to do a drop step in the post on YouTube and you will find an easy way to score in the post.

I had to find a way to leverage my size so I started watching videos of Hakeem Olajuwon's moves in the post.  I picked up a few post moves by watching and practicing the moves Olajuwon is teaching Lebron in this video.  Gets me a few scores in each game. Other than that (since I can't shoot or handle) I try to up my effort on the boards and defense.

Saw a pretty competitive court at a park decided to stop and I was watching these younger guys play thinking i'd be able to destroy them.  I stepped on the court and after 3 or 4 games my foot was killing me. I went back to the park after i healed up and noticed that the pain came back quickly. I realized it was the shoes i was wearing. i was getting crazy pain/inflamation at my arch.   Had to go out and drop $90 for some new shoes. I'm not one for paying more than $2 a pair for socks, but if i knew without an absolute shadow of a doubt that it would help protect my arch on my foot more, i'd be willing to buy it.  at more than a $9 a pair price point I'm not sure I would buy/try them. But if I believed i would notice/feel a difference, or heard a story of someone saying positive things I'd be willing to TRY them for around $14-16 a pair.   now if they worked/helped. i'd easily drop $30 a pair of socks.

Basketball,32grjx,justinkmai,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"Use your strengths and improve on your weaknesses. I know it sounds obvious but if your strengths are outside shooting, then use that to your advantage. Once defenders know you can make the outside shot, they're going to start playing you up close, so you can use a pump fake and drive around your defender into the paint. If you can't dribble, start practicing and improving your handles. Once you're in the paint, you can't just throw a shot up any shot and hope that it goes in. That's how you get blocked, because you become too predictable. Pay attention to how the defense reacts to your drives, and if they collapse on you look for the open teammate. This is called 'drive and kick'. Once you start doing that the defenders will have to watch out for the pass and that should open you up for an easy lay in. Learn different types of finishes around the hoop like floaters, up and unders, reverse layups, etc. It's all about keeping the defense guessing and doing the opposite of what they're expecting.

But I could tell you what I used to do: about driving into the zone, what mostly worked for me was doing crossovers and fake movements (ball fakes is it call?), since I am small I also developed the habit of going way lower than most people so it felt awkward for dudes to go that low, and that got me a few half seconds to get in.  About being a threat, well yes you are going to get blocked because they are bigger and most will jump higher than you, BUT you can minimize those ocurrences by: 1)doing hook-shot (I f**king looooove hookshots, ""you wanted to block me? too bad the ball is all the way over there); 2) doing ""fake"" lay-ups (you go up with a hand, mid-jump you hold the ball with both hands and lift it again with the other); 3) doing mid range shots (at the distance you would start the two step for the lay-up, just jump upwards, the enemy will mostly have to jump foward which will take away a lot of the high advandage, if he even reacts at all).  Thats what I used to do WHEN I had to play inside on the offensive. Hope it was useful.  EDIT: If everyone is playing the game inside, forces them to recognize you as a force to be reckon with on the outside too, if you can shoot 3-4 triple point shoots, while they are all turtle-up inside the paint, it will force them to play outside just to stop you, and that will open more routes and space for you to actually go inside.

Basketball,32fcvh,locdogjr,3,Mon Apr 13 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"Focus on the target: Know how much time and space you need to get off your shot. Practice shooting in the face of threats. Learn what is and isn't an actual threat. Learn to focus completely on the target and ignore non threats.  Footwork: Don't just practice shooting from a standstill. Practice off the dribble (a 1-2 step, a hop, a spin, a step back, a pull up mid range j on the drive), practice on the catch (1-2 and the hop) off of cuts. Make it as game like as possible.  Shot selection: a good shot is one you can make at least 50% uncontested, you're not overwhelmed defensively, and there's not a higher percentage shot available for a team mate (immediately or in the flow of the offensive set). Steph shoots at such a high efficiency that even his wilder shots are good shots, but he's had to work up to that. Take too many bad shots and you lose shooting opportunities.  Shoot with confidence: a good shot is a good shot make or miss. You might miss a dozen shots in a row in a game, but if you've done the practice and you get the opportunity you have to take #13. If you carry the misses in your head you can't focus on the target and shoot with confidence.  Volume and habit: get up shots, practice everyday."

EVERY single time. consistency is key and when you get tired you should maintain that form. will help in games.  3) watch basketball. I'm not sure where you can but watch full games/highlights of anything, collegiate, pro's. while they may be way out of your skill level, just seeing movement of what some of those guys do will be crucial and you can apply to your own game.   4) if you work with ball handling, you can get to the hoop. typically, at your age, kids are not very proficient at playing interior Defense without fouling. drive hard, make contact, get a foul. work on your FT, if you do that 2/3 times a game you could be scoring 6 points!  work hard! good luck"

Basketball,32cm0m,cupoli_Jake,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:03:03 2015 UTC,To work on your dribbling get ankle weights and put them on your wrist when your do dribbling drills
Basketball,32cm0m,Madblood,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've got a good idea of where you need to improve offensively. Repetition is the key to shooting and ball handling. Work on your mid-range and outside shots. If you're a threat to score from outside, the defender has to stay closer, making it easier for you to go by him. A few basic dribble moves to learn are the crossover, a quick behind the back to change direction, maybe a spin. Being able to dribble with your non-dominant hand is a real plus, too. It doesn't have to be flashy, just solid. Most moves to the basket are only a few dribbles. They key is a quick first step to get by your man, and don't do anything fancier than you need to get the job done.    One other tip for defense: Steals are great, they usually lead to a quick score and look impressive in the stats column, but they aren't the goal. When defending, especially the point guard, your goal should be to disrupt them, make them do something they don't want to do. For example if they keep trying to go to their right, force them to dribble left - if they have a weak left hand and try to dribble with the right while moving left, it puts the ball right in front if you. Keep your feet moving and your hands up, throw the offensive player off his game, and the steals will come. Your coaches have probably told you this already, but watch the other guy's chest/stomach when he's dribbling. I've seen some great head fakes, ball fakes, change of direction fakes, etc.,  but nobody has ever come up with a chest fake. Their midsection is going to go wherever they are, regardless of what they're doing with their arms or legs.  Lifting weights will help too. You want to make sure you do some full range of motion lifts. You want to get stronger and put on maybe a few pounds of muscle, while inproving or at least not lowering your flexibility or quickness. Should be a ton of info online. Jumping rope is also a good training exercise, and they make ""heavy ropes"" for strength and endurance training.  Finally, if you want some good drills, both offensive and defensive, check out Shot Science Basketball on YouTube."

I'll now answer your question as I went through a similar transition (well I've been playing for just over 3 years and in that time I've gone from a 6'2"" big with no skills to a 6'5"" wing). For me the most important thing in developing a good jump shot is repetition, however not just in an empty gym. I went to lots of scrimmages, sometimes against players who couldn't really play, and used these scrimmages to play pg and generally work on ball handling getting to the rim shooting etc. Its not easy to become a scorer if you don't have the confidence and the only way of getting this confidence is by going to scrimmages etc and constantly attacking and looking to score. At first it will seem strange and weird but soon it will feel natural and then you can start to add new elements like the drive and kick, drive and dish etc etc. In particular I would advise you to practice moving off the ball. If you're standing on the wing doing nothing go set a down screen, cut through to the other side go backdoor dribble hand off etc etc. Let me know if you have any questions."
Basketball,32cm0m,BW-Ryan,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:00:53 2015 UTC,"Alright, due to the fast that it's North Wales, very little people play basketball in summer if it's not league matches. I however can try and practise several types of layups until I don't have to think when  I do them, only THEN can I become proficient at driving and that I can score or kick it out.   Any specific moves someone 5'11-6 foot should look at learning?  PS. When I practise it will be at game pace - or higher. During training sessions I sometimes fail to go at game pace, so I need to be constantly training as hard as possible."

Basketball,32czop,MladenNinkovic,2,Sun Apr 12 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"Try shooting with a higher arch on the ball because when you shoot a low trajectory shot there is more velocity on the shot meaning the ball does nott have ""soft touch"". If you shoot with a higher trajectory and good back spin  the ball slows down on the way to the rim and gives the ball ""soft touch to raddle into the basket if hits the back rim. Don't shoot too high of trajectory because the acceleration of gravity will act on the ball too much making the ball have more velocity causing for no ""soft touch"" hope this helps"
Basketball,32czop,Alwayshappe,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:52:30 2015 UTC,To add to this if you are shooting at a low arch you're essentially making the basket smaller for yourself. The better your arch the more chance the shot will go in because the hoop is now 'bigger' than it would be with a low arch or no arch.
Basketball,32czop,kidjay76,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:23:34 2015 UTC,I know what you are talking about but i am not very tall and so i have to put more force on my shot to make go into the rim.I tried for some time trying to shoot with a considerable amount of arc but then my shot comes short.
Basketball,32czop,SaucyTotchie,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:59:40 2015 UTC,Coming up short is usually caused by shooting without legs.  Train your legs better.  Build strength and build endurance.  Strength equals high resistance (weight) and low reps.  Endurance is low resistance and high reps.  Do both.
Basketball,32czop,AngryVegetable,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:33:53 2015 UTC,"Work on strength, it's better that you're shorter anyway because the height of your arc doesn't have to be so high."

Sure, its easy to shoot over the top of people from 3, but have a solid post game with a move and a counter-move will pay great dividends, especially at the high school level. That said, its good to be well-rounded, and if you plan on playing in college you will need a 3 pt shot at that height. If you put in the time, you could excel both in the post and on the perimeter"

Although I did learn the post game, crash, gritty type big man game first I thought I'd work on my 3 just for fun and it came pretty easy (my mid jumper sucks though... that's next). So I can drop a 3 on the trailer or go in. Also if the center you're playing against doesn't like leaving the key (like quite a few big guys) your team will recognize that and if they like your shot they'll feed you for the 3  (im talking unorganized ball).  Honestly for me I will either take 5 3's a game or none, because either you make em and the team wants you shooting them or you killem with the low post game. More options, more buckets.

What I'm saying is they abuse their height advantage and misuse it. Best suggestion from me is to practice 3s if you're confident enough and are serious about it, but you should try at practising other aspects, be it improving your reflexes for shooting or be wary of the defending. This is only if you decide to devote all your time to 3s. Otherwise you can try other things, basketball is endless. There are many tall guys who are good at layups and are quick."

I read hundreds of reviews and did my homework and the consensus is: the ball feels hard and plastic like. But if you are patient and play with it and break it in, it will get better and better.  I've had mine for about 4 months. It did feel shitty at first. It then got a little bit lopsided. However I have kept playing with it, the lopsidedness went away, it's starting to feel softer, and once you start sweating... Damn it feels good.   Mine also had a little bit of glue, idk if that's good or bad. But just keep playing with it and it should get better"

If you see in the nba nearly all guards who are 5'11 - 6'2 are explosive as fuck. also having a jumper in the back pocket is an amazing skill. just start shooting around a lot. not even serious stuff just everyday take 50 shots or something. it seems a lot but thats like 1hr."

Basketball,31pi1v,AlmaGrrrBoy,4,Tue Apr 7 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely did, but for instance, Winslow tipped the ball out, not Koenig, he was also out of bounds on the possession before, foul Wisconsin cause they dive for the ball!? That's basketball, let it play, it was both ways. There were a number of charges not called on duke either. This was the equivalent of the fail Mary. Rant over."
Basketball,31pi1v,denningk,3,Tue Apr 7 03:38:20 2015 UTC,"Is this going to be one of those things where people bandwagon that the refs suck, it isn't Wisconsin ' s fault, duke gets all the calls things? Hate duke if you eant, but that game was for the most part called evenly both ways. My household was fairly objective since my dad went to duke and my mother went to wisconsin. I certainly hope you were more upset about the officiating on saturday, but since there are no threads here about that I'm going to guess you werent. So go ahead and hate duke if you want, but wisconsin had plenty of opportunities to seize that game and they simply failed to do it."
Basketball,31pi1v,zivarah,3,Tue Apr 7 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that Wisconsin made some key blunders, and Duke made some great plays. However, that doesn't mean that the refs didn't cost them the game. Those key calls in the second half had a huge impact.  I think that Wisconsin did a good job putting themselves far enough ahead that they could have survived Duke's comeback at the end there, but that buffer was negated by the refereeing.  It doesn't matter what teams are playing - I hate to see poor officiating change the outcome of a game."
Basketball,31pi1v,zivarah,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:10:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it was disappointing to see that game end that way.

Basketball,31ohqu,himynameiss,2,Mon Apr 6 22:23:48 2015 UTC,"I used to have this problem where I'd cross but not fool the defender. You want to juke as much as possible (I. E. Looking at another direction, shifting body in opposite direction, hesitation/shooting motion). As a defender, guys who look down are fairly easy covers. But a lot of the times those guys also try and bulldoze their way because they can't see their defender's position. It's always said but just be as low to the ground as possible and make sure you throw in signs that fool the defender as well as being quick enough to get that first step by."
Basketball,31ohqu,checkmystats,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:44:44 2015 UTC,Yeah i look at the ground but I never get outta control. I'm faster than usually most of the people guarding me so I tend to just blow past people.
Basketball,31ohqu,HoolywoodDingus,2,Tue Apr 7 02:23:27 2015 UTC,"You have to drive hard enough the first way that the defender TURNS HIS/HER HIPS before crossing over. If the defender stays square in front of you, he or she can follow you either way you dribble. Watch that video, when CP3 takes a step back with his left foot is when Williams crosses him up. The ""bring back"" crossover is a combination of the defender turning his hips and building up a lot of momentum the other way.  Long story short, it has more to do with what the defender is doing than what you're doing. So try to pay more attention to where your defender is doing. Even if you're looking down, you can see when the guy turns his hips, so that shouldn't be too big of a problem."

Hell, I just took three months off and I got a blood blister and two bruised toenails.

If you got nothing to steal, u won't get robbed. It helps to go in a group but as long as you aren't actively pissing people off you won't be messed with.  Ballers respect people with game. If someone starts trying to school me, the white boy, I just show them what's what and that I won't be messed with. Don't call ticky tack fouls. Don't be a rulesmith.  Stand your ground and treat everyone esle the way you want to be treated. If you foul someone hard,  say sorry. If you foul someone regular, don't say sorry. You probably ly just got unlucky. What kind of idiot would rob someone playing bball. What r they trying to steal? My sneakers?  U must just have been the victim of an idiot. Don't be afraid. It's not a racial thing.

I think, if anything, we won't get another Nike signature until Kobe retires and Kyrie has at least 3 signature models.   I think AD would logically be the next, but idk how soon."

Basketball,31briq,GuntherTime,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:32:45 2015 UTC,Harden might next with that logic. When you think about it Nike always gives a promising star a face on a basic shoe then if the break out a signature shoe. They did it with Blake Griffon with the hyper dunks but he went to Jordan then they used Kyrie for them before giving him his own shoe.
Basketball,31briq,iAmKael,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"See, I think AD will get it next by the same logic. Let's say they wait 3 years for the next one. In 3 years, Harden will be almost 29, while AD will only be 25. That gives Nike exponentially more money to earn thru his playing career. And they have already sort of given the Hyperposite model to AD."
Basketball,31briq,HollywoodLook,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true but it all really depends on what route Nike chooses to follow. Right now Harden is the hotter player and what gives him the edge is that he started out good and slowly got better pushing to mvp candidate, while AD looked like the MVP but now looks like a dark horse winner.  Also you have to remember that players usually enter their prime around 29-30 so we're gonna see some of the best basketball were gonna get from Harden. It's really a toss up as to who can get it. All I gotta say is that basketball is gonna still be exciting once Bron and Kobe retire."

I know that's a shifty way to play and I hate it too, but if that's what it takes have some fun, you gotta do what you gotta do.   The better way would be to really outskill them. Like step up your play so much that they would have to foul so hard even they would realise it's bad.   And maybe take some time to explain the rules as time goes on. Don't whine about it.

I'm from the U.S. and I went to the Philippines last summer and played basketball there and found that their style of play obviously differs from the way we play in the states.  The way they play there is a lot more aggressive and I have a few scars to show for.  After figuring out how they play I started to adapt and match the intensity while calling fouls and keeping note of what they considered to be a foul.  With this being said, I played as aggressive as they did without being fouled.    Another useful basketball trick is to use an arm bar or hand check the defender to get yourself some space."

Basketball,30wvi9,-rigga,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:45:09 2015 UTC,Establish a few good ground rules. 1) Ball has to stay inbounds or else the ball is turned over to the other team. 2) No traveling. 3) No fouling.  Obviously there are more rules but with these 3 you at least have the basics to run a legitimate game.
Basketball,30vxoc,HmmmmNiceBike,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"It's because not many of those clips exist, for a combination of reasons:   Stacy King was a pretty mediocre NBA player (not many will argue that).  Plus, the parts of the game where he excelled were in historically unexciting areas (banging in the low post, giving fouls, didn't dunk on too many people, etc).  So he just didn't make many highlight reel plays. that was the time before 10 video cameras per game, so far fewer clips of anyone exist, compared to now. Plus, Stacy played his prime years with MJ and the Bulls, so the few cameras at each game would typically be focused on the other stars in the game. (edit) that was also pre-internet, when videos were less likely to be saved.  So even IF someone made 2-hour long compilation of Stacy King's Most Devastating Fouls, it was less likely to be saved.   Maybe nba.com has some playoffs/finals archives where you could find some old Bulls highlights.  If you're happy with his college days, you could try searching for his playing days at the University of Oklahoma, where he was a star player."

Basketball,30tl48,capital0,2,Tue Apr 7 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"These three basic rules will get you a good offense.   Only two players can be within 10 feet of each other at one time.  If you have the ball and your defender is in good position, pass. If you do not have the ball, cut quickly into open space looking for the pass; or set a screen for the other player without the ball.   These rules work together to create lots of open space on the court and then using movement into the open spaces to create scoring opportunities. It is much easier to get open without the ball, versus trying to score when you are already defended. When you catch the ball you are either in a good spot to score already, or pass to someone else and try again."

On offense, set screens for the person who doesn't have the ball. (e.g. stand in the defender's way) Pass to the screened-for player.  Or, after you set the screen, roll to the basket. Hit the roller. Work on being able to make layups on both sides (jump off the opposite foot - so jump off your right foot for a right handed layup, left foot jump for right handed layup).

Basketball,30qas6,LittleHelperRobot,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"Bonus (basketball):       In the sport of basketball, the bonus situation (also called the penalty situation) occurs when one team accumulates a requisite number of fouls, which number varies depending on the level of play. When one team has committed the requisite number of fouls, each subsequent foul results in the opposing team's taking free throws regardless of the type of foul committed (i.e., whether or not the foul was a shooting foul).  Teams under the limit are commonly referred to as having fouls to give, and thus they can try to disrupt their opponents without being penalized free throws.

Basketball,30qas6,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"But do I have the rules right? If you get a molecule disturbed on your body before the basketball goes into the hoop, the player who disturbed that molecule committed a foul? Seems kind of ridiculous to me.  Everytime I think I have a grasp on the rules of basketball, the refs call fouls that I can't associate with having just happened. And especially how they decide how one shot block results in a free throw, but another shot block results in a pass from out of bounds..."
Basketball,30qas6,5AMinHanoi,2,Mon Mar 30 23:04:03 2015 UTC,"The free throw vs out of bounds is firstly based on what act the fouled player is doing. If he was shooting, it's a free throw. If he was dribbling, passing, or off the ball (rebounding, etc), it's out of bounds. There can be some ambiguity when a player is driving to attempt a shot, sometimes the foul is called ""before the shot."" For example, a player can drive from the top of the key toward the basket. If he's grabbed or the defensive player has no position  (more on this later), before the driving player attempts a shot, it's a foul and the driving player's  team gets the ball out of bounds. If he manages to get a shot off, the ref can award free throws. It's a lot more obvious in person while playing but if you watch enough you will start seeing the difference.  The bonus comes into play. Based on the league, if a team surpasses X number of fouls, there opponent gets to shoot free throws. Read the wiki in the other comment. The reason for bonus is to punish a team for fouling to much. Without the bonus, a team could mug the all - star on the other team with thier worse players. NCAA can be confusing as they get one or two free throws based on how far into ""the bonus"" they are.   Regarding the physical fouls and the line between getting a ""molecule"" touched, it's tricky. If a defensive player has good defensive position (arms straight, feet set on the ground, chest out) than he can draw a offensive foul or it will be a no call. But if he jumps, leans sideways or forward, comes in from the side and makes contact it's going to be called unless it's a perfectly clean strip.  Another factor is the league. The NBA wants fast paced games with high scoring, so they call a lot of contact a foul to force the defence to avoid fouling all together. They want 121-115 scores, not 75-70.  Does that mean the league isn't physical? No. Down low on rebounds and during post ups it's viscous and physical.   Also, sometimes the referees a brutal such as when they screwed Wisconsin in the championship game."
Basketball,30pjqx,JordanKR1,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:13:44 2015 UTC,"Work on your jumper. If you're going to play 2-3 or even the 4 you'll need a decent jumper. Once people realize they can't let you sit out there and shoot all day they'll have to step out and guard you, this will give the floor more spacing. Even if it's 12-16 feet or so.   There will be games when you're taller than the other 2-3 guarding you so you can shoot over them, and if the guy is 6'11"" you can at the very least pull him out or try to use your speed and get by him."
Basketball,30pjqx,traksta15,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"To improve lateral quickness and to get used to the footwork for guarding a perimeter player, I'd suggest doing the ""lane agility drill.""    Here's a video of the lane agility drill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqIqvcKQYeQ    The audio kind of sucks but you can get the idea. Also, the direction they are doing the drill is reversed from the way I do it. I prefer to be facing away from the hoop since that is the direction you'll be facing when you are playing in a game, but it doesn't really matter. Also, the kids in the video went straight from a forward sprint into the slide, but I prefer to chop my feet and closeout with my hands up before sliding. If you just run at a shooter without chopping your feet and getting low, they will drive right by you. And lastly, the kids in the video only did one ""rep"" but I like to do it continuously for a minute or so. Once you get back to your starting point, slide back across to the opposite side of the lane, and start over. It's a great cardio workout. Your legs and lungs will be burning.    Also, do some full court defensive slides. And every time you change direction, emphasize swinging your elbow to help open up your hips in that direction, but don't over exaggerate it and elbow someone. A good offensive player will attack your lead foot, forcing you to have to drop that lead foot backwards before you start sliding. Swinging the elbow backwards on the side they are attacking will help open up your hips and put you in a better defensive position.    For ballhandling, do some 2 ball drills, but most importantly, just pick a few moves and perfect them. For a bigger guy, I think the spin move is impossible to stop. I'm a small, quick guard and I HATE guarding bigger guys who can utilize the spin. Even though I can cut off their initial move, if they spin, they are able to protect the ball with their body while moving a few feet closer to the basket. With 2 well-executed spin moves, they are now basically under the basket for an easy layup. Just make sure to really sell the spin move with a very hard initial dribble to get the defender to jump that way, then you can just roll off their body in the opposite direction.    You probably won't be the quickest guard so use your size to your advantage. Use the spin move to get near the hoop and you can now use your trusty post moves on much smaller players. Also, study guys like Larry Bird or Paul Pierce. They aren't the fastest guys, but they have perfect footwork and great ballfakes so they can still do whatever they want on the court. Sorry, didn't mean to type a novel but I hope that helped!    TL;DR - Lane agility drill to improve lateral quickness - Full court defensive slides (emphasize elbow swing to open hips) - Utilize spin move - Study slower guys like Paul Pierce and Larry Bird    EDIT: Some typos and formatting. And don't forget to work on your jumpshot! It will keep the defense honest. They will have to guard you closer, which will make it easier to drive by them."

It's just that there are no better solutions for determining when a player is just trying to get fouled vs. when he legitimately gets fouled.  So they go with a  strict rule along the lines of, ""If you're hit, it's a foul.""    Because right now if you took him and plopped him into the same time when Michael played he would not last a full season cause the game was too physical. Maybe you could help me understand why basketball is becoming less and less physical.    It's true that the NBA is less physical than 25 years ago (and the NCAA follows suit as it tries to emulate the NBA).  In the 90's the NBA was very physical.  So much that the NBA made rule changes to mitigate that type of play and encourage a more watchable game (most people don't want to see low scores and a lot of fouls).  Those rule changes turned it into the ""less physical"" game you see today.  But in the 1990's there were plenty of people bemoaning the increasingly physical game compared to the basketball from 25 years earlier.  You can note that the NBA has an anti-flopping foul, where refs can call a technical foul on a player if they commit an obvious flop.  It gets called sometimes, but not as often as it could.  The problem that it's a judgement call by the refs."

Like other guys said contribute in other ways and when you he the ball don't just pass it to keep them happy (unless it's the right move) but if you can score do it or pass to someone else do it. They might whine a bit but who complains about a win?

For posting up so that you can push people out of the paint, i'd work on squats and deadlifts. If you can stand your ground and not let people back you down, then you're good.   For upper body strength, I'd recommend bench press, military press, and pullups for your back to get stronger. Rebounding is tricky because sometimes it really is about height, but work on your hops and you should be good"

Basketball,306602,thegreatmexicanman,7,Tue Mar 24 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"It's not a travel, you can jump off your pivot foot but you have to pass or shoot the ball before coming back down."
Basketball,306602,northeasy,5,Tue Mar 24 22:09:45 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. A travel can occur in two ways: when the pivot foot is lifted BEFORE the ball is released to start a dribble, OR when the pivot foot RETURNS to the floor before the ball is released on a pass or try for goal. Technically, you can catch the ball, pivot on your right foot, lift it off the floor and hold it there for five minutes, and then pass it legally, as long as the pass is released before your pivot foot comes back down to the floor."
Basketball,306602,bkuziojr,2,Wed Mar 25 01:55:01 2015 UTC,"Ok. First,  NBA and traveling is a common non called thing. It's like they get plus 1 step. Now so I'm clear. You have your left foot planted, square up to ring. Step on to right, then jump off left?  That isn't but then again it comes down to how you landed when catching the ball"
Basketball,306602,CantGetAidsTwice,0,Tue Mar 24 21:06:29 2015 UTC,"Left foot is planted. Right foot is my free foot. I do a fake and then place my free foot (Right) towards the basket, lift my left foot off the ground.. so now my free foot is the only foot on the ground and jump off of it and make a shot"
Basketball,306602,bkuziojr,2,Wed Mar 25 00:43:35 2015 UTC,Not a travel  Source: NFHS rule book
Basketball,306602,Peanut_Butter_Jelly_,2,Wed Mar 25 01:56:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a little late to the party but the scenario in the OP is definitely a travel.  You establish your pivot as your right foot, then do an up an under move.  The only options here are to jump either off both feet, or jump off your left foot and release the ball before your feet come down.  Anything else is a travel.  In the OP you set a right foot pivot, go up and under, then move your pivot foot, then left, the right again?  Either your description is poor or you've traveled."
Basketball,306602,Jkim3691,7,Thu Mar 26 00:05:57 2015 UTC,If your pivot foot is moving it's a travel.

Basketball,306602,FrozenCrusade,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:12:21 2015 UTC,"Here is the answer you are looking for. I found this by looking at nba rules  g. If a player, with the ball in his possession, raises his pivot foot off the floor, he must pass or shoot before his pivot foot returns to the floor. If he drops the ball while in the air, he may not be the first to touch the ball.  Found it here http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_10.html under the traveling section.  Sorry for lack of formatting. I'm on mobile."
Basketball,306602,clear831,2,Wed Mar 25 04:17:05 2015 UTC,So then it's NOT a travel because my pivot foot comes off the ground but before it touches the ground again I've already jumped off my free foot and taken the shot. Thank you.
Basketball,306602,jordanstationcnru,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:50:25 2015 UTC,"Your second question hasnt been answered. A eurostep is not a travel because the player is ""gathering"" the ball, you gather the ball inbetween your stride, after your front foot hits the ground, then you can take the 2 steps. Watch James Harden, Lin and Dwade on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d0hxgD_tAw"
Basketball,306602,DemonSmurf,1 point,Fri Mar 27 05:47:12 2015 UTC,It is a travel for absolutely
Basketball,306602,bkuziojr,-1,Wed Mar 25 02:01:15 2015 UTC,"So here is what's happening. If, in your initial scenario, you were passed the ball in the post and have not yet dribbled, you are allowed to take two steps without dribbling and then either begin to dribble, shoot, or pass...not a travel. If, however, you dribbled into the post and stopped dribbling, you are allowed to take one step with your free foot, and pick up, but not put down, your original 'pivot foot' before you shoot or pass. Once you have ended you dribble and established your pivot foot, even just picking it up and putting it back down in the same place is a travel. The difference with a Euro-step is that it happens coming off the dribble, so two steps are taken, the second establishing the pivot foot, and then jumping and taking the shot before either foot hits the ground. Hope this helped!"
Basketball,306602,DemonSmurf,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:03:50 2015 UTC,This is not correct.
Basketball,306602,northeasy,0,Wed Mar 25 01:57:03 2015 UTC,"I just don't get the euro step being legal.. like you pick up the ball, put your first foot (pivot) down on the ground.. lift it off and place your second foot (free foot) on the ground and your pivot is no longer on the ground and you jump off your free foot alone. How is doing this move any different?"

If you can develop 2 or 3 solid moves and then start putting them together in series, you'll be able to lose most defenders 1on1.  Another thing that can help you get past defenders is a good mid-range jumpshot. If the defender doesn't respect your shot and can play off of you, he's got a lot more time and space to react to any move you make to the hoop. If he's got to guard you close because you'll drop 15-footers on him all day if he doesn't, you'll have an easier time getting past him."
Basketball,3050cj,Madblood,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:23:07 2015 UTC,"Try a spin move dunk. Basically you dribble at the defender, then when you get to him/her, you spin and then jump and dunk."

Basketball,2zxeih,LordFostaa,9,Sun Mar 22 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"In the NBA? No, team basketball is gaining strength and showing good results versus the iso teams. Teams will continue to try to emulate the Spurs, Hawks, Warriors,... There's just no need for a player to carry such a big load offensively that he has to put up a 100 point game."
Basketball,2zxeih,deepdeer,5,Sun Mar 22 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"No way, and there's plenty of reasons. One, the pool of potential NBA players is so large and overwhelmingly more talented and athletic than it was in 1962 when Wilt did it. I seriously doubt any player will ever carry enough of a consistently dominant advantage over their opponents to get an opportunity to get 100. Wilt was a man among boys his entire career; I think the modern NBA is too competitive for that to happen again.  Another thing- the closest we've ever gotten is Kobe's 81. Kobe is one of the most talented, skilled scorers (if not the most) of all time. He's been an absolute machine in how he has approached the game throughout his career. Combine that with the fact that he's always been known as someone who takes a lot of shots, sometimes to his team's detriment. He's got 3 of the top 15 highest season usage rates in NBA history. He absolutely ran the Lakers team throughout his career, and he had a great market that would've loved a 100 point scorer in LA. Basically, if anyone could have done it, it would have been Kobe, and his 81 really wasn't close."
Basketball,2zxeih,Melocatones,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"another reason why it probably won't happen is a lot more NBA teams are playing guys less because they've seen the advantages of guys being more healthy for the playoffs, keeping guys to minute restrictions etc....i mean even the game Thompson had 37 points in one quarter he ended up only scoring 52 and was sat once the game was out of reach"

There are certain players like Steph and Klay that could.

Basketball,2zwe39,nightfly13,4,Sun Mar 22 12:51:48 2015 UTC,"Um, you need more than a few CM to go from touching the rim (or almost touching in your case) to dunking. I could only really dunk when I got around 7CM PAST my wrist joint, plus the whole length of my hand. So, ya, sorry to dash your dreams. Losing weight would help, and work on core strength (stomach muscle explosiveness if you're a 2-foot jumper) but even if you can get the height, getting that same height with a basketball in your hand is another skill entirely."
Basketball,2zwe39,wavecrasher59,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:27:43 2015 UTC,On top of what he said go for two handed dunks first cause it will be eaisier to get the ball over the rim. For a clean one handed dunk you definitely need to have at least your wrist about an inch above the rim id say.
Basketball,2zwe39,deepdeer,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:40:50 2015 UTC,Stronger legs and core basically. You can try vertical programs and don't forget to stretch. The time it will take for you to dunk depends on your age and the work you put in.
Basketball,2zwe39,letmebeeee,0,Sun Mar 22 18:43:33 2015 UTC,Work on dunking on lower rims and slowly raise it until you get to 10. Dunking is a skill and it's not just how high you can jump.

Basketball,2zu9mx,obi-twon-kanobi,3,Sat Mar 21 21:52:10 2015 UTC,Truth.   And to OP a layup and a dunk are both worth 2.
Basketball,2zu9mx,locdogjr,2,Sun Mar 22 02:28:09 2015 UTC,Don't bother buying a grip strengthener there are several things you can do. For most people a tennis ball will provide enough resistance so you can do squeezes with each hand with one of them. Another one that works well is put the ball on top of your fingertips of one hand. Then you want to squeeze your fingers causing the ball to go slightly in the air. Once you start being able to palm a ball you want to start trying to palm off the bounce. Bounce the ball and each time it comes up try and palm the ball for a second or two. Finally assuming you are trying to palm in order to dunk you should practice trying to control the ball without palming if you can't palm or go up with two hands.
Basketball,2zu9mx,samb1234,2,Sat Mar 21 22:58:41 2015 UTC,Forgot to mention: the one where you squeeze the ball out of your fingers should be done with a basketball not a tennis ball as should palming off the dribble  Here's a video of it How To Palm A Basketball Tips Small Hands (from Jacob) | DreAllDay.com/J...: https://youtu.be/z83RjlWJIFw

When you pick it up, hold it tightly two handed, or press it against your body. Hold the ball in places it's hard to get, so don't put it above your head.  Drive hard, and use your lanes and screens to get that extra second to get the shot off. Mostly importantly just keep trying new things, be assertive and play hard."

It's also actually a lot better than a loose relaxed dribble when under pressure because it mean there is far less time between the ball being in your hand. Just keep under control and keep it low and it is not bad.

Also another good thing to try is, buy some ankle weights and train wearing them.  Over time your muscles adapt to that extra weight which allows you to jump higher."

Basketball,2zf6pz,p3ndulum,2,Wed Mar 18 03:49:49 2015 UTC,"YouTube ""two ball dribbling drills"" for help with your ball handling.  Also, try setting up chairs or pylons to dribble around, and repeat each drill over and over again until the move becomes natural.  Start by a simple cross over, strong hand to weak hand. Dribble at the chair, and then just cross it over to your other hand and blow past the chair. Do that 50-100 times, and then switch hands/sides. After that, try a double cross before blowing by the chair. So, dribble at the chair, bounce to your weak hand, and then quickly back to your strong hand, and then blow by the chair.  After that you can set up a second chair beyond the first, cross over the first chair, and then cross over the second before blowing by it.  Eventually you can build up to spin moves and crossover/spin moves. Just keep repeating the drills over and over again in your free time.  For bonus points, you could try these drills with a blind fold on."

Basketball,2zbghw,djyummy,5,Tue Mar 17 04:35:02 2015 UTC,"If the defender is square to the approach of the ball handler, has established a legal defensive position and doesn't initiate contact then the offensive player is responsible for any contact. You used the word graze, which would typically mean that this hasn't altered the rhythm, balance or follow through of either player. Ideally this would be a no call."
Basketball,2zbghw,toiletchildren,0,Tue Mar 17 05:00:44 2015 UTC,"So if this ""graze"" does alter balance/rhythm/follow through, how would you call this?  An offensive foul or a defensive foul?"
Basketball,2zbghw,Cindjor,4,Tue Mar 17 05:21:24 2015 UTC,It would probably be a no call.
Basketball,2zbghw,Instantcoffees,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:51:26 2015 UTC,"Well a ""graze"" implies that there is little contact and little to no impact on either the defender or attacker. If the driving player would hit the defender hard enough to knock him over or to affect his balance enough to completely eliminate his defensive position, it might be called as an offensive foul. A minor bump only moderately affecting both sides will rarely be called. Unless the player is perfectly standing still.  To be honest, it's a lot less common for an offensive foul to be called. Even when a driving player deliberatly searches contact (e.g jumping into a defending player or driving into him), most referees will give a foul in favor of the attacking player. It's a bit of a problem in any high level competition in my opinion. A lot of top players are really competent when it comes to provoking a foul."
Basketball,2zbghw,chadowmantis,2,Tue Mar 17 09:09:42 2015 UTC,"This really depends on the rulebook. The rules differ per country in Europe, especially in amateur leagues. In general, for it to be an offensive foul, the contact would have to be on the chest of the defending player. If he really was doing nothing but standing there like a scarecrow, then it's a no-call. If the offensive player intentionally and tarnsparently ran into the guys shoulder, you could punish him like you would for a flop or maybe dangerous play (depending on the amount of contact or exaggeration)."

Basketball,2yk9ri,jardonm,2,Tue Mar 10 20:33:52 2015 UTC,When hes trying to drive try to make him use his off hand. Force him to drive where there's help.   When hes posting up try to get a good defensive stance. Keep one hand on his back and the other on the ball.if hes too strong don't be afraid to ask for help.     Try to remember his tendencies and where he likes to shoot. Make him uncomfortable.
Basketball,2yk9ri,D0minican,2,Tue Mar 10 15:24:18 2015 UTC,"Force him to his weak hand, or to whichever side of the post you have help. If you're more athletic, try to front him and not let him seal you.   Also, bigger guys might be in worse shape, so if you're in shape and he's not, make him chase you while you're on offense. It'll tire him and he will be less effective on his offensive end. Or he won't chase you, but you'll get open looks"

Setting picks and rolling off them to the basket is a good start, also, move without the ball, try to make backdoor cuts and things like that. If a teammate is trying to isolate don't try to set a pick for him or stand close enough where your defender can collapse on him. Drives me nuts when guys do that. Most important thing: HUSTLE. follow your shots, crash the boards when your teammates shoot, box out. You may just get yourself some buckets off of those type of plays."

Basketball,2yftww,layup,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:22:45 2015 UTC,"Depends. If the player has the ball and going for a drive, you would be fouling if you use your body to ""push"" him off his track. Stay next to him and just don't let him get closer to the goal, but don't obstruct him unless you can fully position your body infront of him and are standing still. When talking about rebounds, it's a rough game. You are allowed to use your body, just keep your elbows to yourself and don't push them with a stretched or semi-stretched arm."
Basketball,2yftww,Instantcoffees,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:16:06 2015 UTC,"When you're looking for the ball down low, set up like you would trying to get a rebound (stick your ass out). You are allowed to lean into your defender (as long as your not falling on top of him), but this is only useful if you have the ball down low as a way to spin off him. If you're defending in the post, you're allowed to have one forearem on the body of the offensive player and apply pressure to keep your spacing. It's kind of a unwritten rule that the game gets more physical the closer you get to the basket, and he's probably just cheesed about getting beaten."
Basketball,2yftww,DemonSmurf,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:56:55 2015 UTC,"It is technically a foul if the offensive player is using his arms to prevent the defensive player from gaining position, generally called ""hooking"".

Do not look at the ball when you dribble. TRAIN BOTH HANDS ON EVERYTHING Practice your layups!   I could go on, there's a ton of things you can do to get better!

There are some things that you just absolutely need to be consistent with- and good coaches will notice these things and they will love you for it. Most important thing to me personally, is boxing out. Anyone can do it. The team that rebounds better is usually the team that wins. More rebounds = more possessions = more shots. Do the Mikan drill every time you step on a court- good habits around the rim are key and this drill trains you to keep the ball up with soft hands. Have fun and always compete. This game blows by really, really fast. In the words of the legendary John Wooden, ""be quick but don't hurry.""   You will make mistakes but don't let them discourage you. There's a lot of things going on in a basketball game but if you keep your composer, you'll do great.   I recommend reading from great coaches. My favorite coaches are John wooden, Coach K, and Pete Carroll. They are great teachers. I know Pete Carroll isn't a basketball coach but he really gets me in a healthy, competitive mindset to try to perform to the best of my ability. Good luck!"

Basketball,2ycae5,tomthekingofdirt,1 point,Thu Mar 12 09:00:46 2015 UTC,I'm 6' and can almost windmill. it's all about how much of the right training you do and good stretching. focus on explosion and in game jumping so you can use it once you get to that point. I haven't dunked in a highschool game yet but AAU I've had a few and that's only off of one way of dunking. I recommend working on two foot jumps and being a power jumper to be more consistent.

Gonna be tough to get higher without practicing or doing some plyometrics  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwtJX_aS26A  Our verticals are relatively fixed into our genetics, I for instance had I think a 25"" vertical or something like that, with hardwork and dedication I could probably have gotten it to 28"" to 30"", but I was never going to become Zach Lavine.  Every morning do some of those plyometric exercises and in a few months it should give the extra 2"" or so you need to dunk with 2 hands."

Basketball,2y7re0,basketball,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"I don't train at all. It is mostly genetic but ever since I did the high jump when I was in 6-8th grade, I feel like I got the technique on how to jump the highest down. High jumpers start with a little jog and right before they jump they speed up a little and swing their arms upward for momentum. Look at some videos of high jumpers maybe and try to mimic their motion. Also, you could try some workouts like standing against a wall and continuously jumping up and down with no pauses in between jumps, trying to touch as high as you can on the wall. These killed my soul back in the day but it feels like it helps a lot. Also try Bulgarian squats, they are beast.  Jumping it all fast twitch muscle+technique. Work on those and you will be golden."
Basketball,2y81sd,boxmonster123,2,Sat Mar 7 07:35:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly I was a straight up shit ball handler a year ago and I'm pretty decent now. Some days when I practice by myself I barely even shoot, I just dribble and practice moves. YouTube is awesome for finding drills. I don't do any of the crazy stuff with cones, tennis balls, or two balls, I just pound the shit out of the ball. Practicing moves, then trying them in 21, built up my confidence to do them in games.  Kyrie used to dribble a ball everywhere while it was wrapped in a grocery bag."
Basketball,2y81sd,aRMORdr,3,Sat Mar 7 08:02:33 2015 UTC,"Kyrie Irving/AI/Curry   Those guys didn't just pick up a ball and start breaking ankles. If you practice a lot you will get good. When I started playing basketball I sucked arse, but I spent most of my teenage years with a ball in my hand EVERYWHERE I went. I slept with my ball. After a while the ball becomes an extension of your body, and you can control it as effortlessly as you control your arms and legs.  Unfortunately it works both ways. If you stop practicing you lose your skills - it is easier to get them back though."

Basketball,2y81sd,steodosic,2,Sat Mar 7 12:18:30 2015 UTC,"I had completely awful ball handling about 2 years ago. I started dribbling 30 minutes a day before practice, or anytime I played. I got into some dribbling drills on youtube and just pushed myself to do them as fast as possible for as long as possible every time I went to the gym. Now I almost always run the point and can handle the ball pretty well. If you are just starting, and you push yourself to do the drills you will see improvement almost immediately if you work it often enough.   Its all pracitce but make sure you push yourself. You won't get better going through the motions!"

Basketball,2y6wc0,TrueBlue41,2,Sat Mar 7 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"Practice is obviously key, but more importantly is focused and dedicated practice.   First, figure out what new form you are going for. Modeling it off a player who has a similar body type/shot is good. Dirk actually made some adjustments to his shot this season to remove some of the hitch.   Next, practice. I recommend filming yourself when you practice so you can review exactly what your current form looks like. This is key in tracking progress and making sure your fixes look sound.   For this specific problem, when you're practicing, focus on not bringing the ball behind your head. For a while it will feel weird, but you'll get used to it eventually. Just stay at it. Know that it will get worse before it gets better.  Overall: stay focused, film yourself to check your progress/form, keep the ball from traveling too far backwards when it travels upwards."

Basketball,2y3jne,dramaness,3,Fri Mar 6 03:06:34 2015 UTC,"In order to draw a charge, not only do you have to be planted before any contact, you have to give adequate time for the other player to see and move around you. Basically this means you can't just move and plant at the last second.   Here's more: http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/10/28/6419373/nba-block-charge-rule-official"
Basketball,2y3jne,chickendinner101,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:42:46 2015 UTC,"I think the charging foul is when the ball handler pushes against their defender while the defender is grounded (Two feet on the ground and not moving.), and a blocking foul is when a defender has too much contact with the handler while they are both moving.  Difference is whether the defender was moving or not."
Basketball,2y3jne,derick1908,2,Fri Mar 6 03:21:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen cases when my fellow teammate was standing motionlessly for like 3 seconds before coping a hit and flopping down.  Then the ref calls a defensive blocking.....I guess that was just a bad call"
Basketball,2y3jne,thesealwhisperer,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:24:40 2015 UTC,"It's a very fine line of differentiation.  Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to be completely still for it to be called a charge.  One of the biggest factors that determines a block vs. charge is whether or not you square up the offensive player when you take the hit.  Even if you are moving, but take the hit directly in the chest and fall straight back it is likely that it will be called a charge.  There is certainly an art to taking charges well.  On the flip side...if the offensive player is able to get to your shoulder or makes you fall awkwardly even when you are set, it will most likely be called a block.  Also, at the college and professional levels there is a ""restricted area"" underneath the hoop which means that if you are inside the circle it cannot be called a charge.  It is also a block if you slide in front of a player who has already left the ground for their shooting motion.  Ultimately it is one of the most subjective calls in basketball, and an identical play will often be called different ways by different refs."
Basketball,2y293o,jesse920,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:52:30 2015 UTC,"If you're asking, it's a really difficult maneuver but what I've figured out is when you're dribbling the ball, at the apex of dribble set up like you're about to throw a very fast cut pass, scoop the the ball with the underside of your hand toward your opposite quadriceps (look up the actual yoyo trick called a ""trapeze"" to get an idea) the ball with have enough backspin to create a bounce-back."

Basketball,2xwtrf,BW-Ryan,3,Wed Mar 4 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"to be a little clearer, the step you take when you are gathering the basketball (i.e. the pro hop) is not considered the first step. They don't start counting steps until you have fully gathered the ball and landed after that.  It was actually pretty rare to see players do this until the 2000s but now it's very common."

Basketball,2xwtrf,KotWmike,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:04:31 2015 UTC,"I think that's slightly different. When Harden takes his euro, he's still usually just taking two steps, it's just that the steps aren't completely north-south that make them look a little strange.  Derrick Rose pre ACL injury, Lebron, Kobe and Kyrie are all players that regularly take advantage of using the gather step to get extra distance before their two steps"

Basketball,2xvg7r,kibbitzer27,2,Wed Mar 4 04:33:46 2015 UTC,"Flexibility, power (strength x speed), body fat %, and technique are your focus points.  Ass-to-grass heavy squats, dead lifts, and lunges are great for strength.  For speed/explosiveness I would do sprints, plyo-metrics, rim grabs, medicine ball throws, cleans, ect.  I am sure you know how to stretch so that is easy. Also, your body fat % will be controlled best with diet.  An example of what helped me:  M - Squats, dead lift, lunges, leg press (4 to 5 sets; 8 reps)  T - Dynamic stretching or Yoga  W - Upper Body (Pull-ups, bench press, rows, whatever)  R - box jumps, rim grabs, sprints, weighted jumps, speed rope  F- Dynamic stretching or Yoga  S - Upper Body or Rest  Basically you want to have a lifting day for strength and a speed / power day.  I also throw in some days for upper body to keep a well developed physique.  Stretching on the off days and controlling your diet is important.  Make a plan that works for you and follow it.  Remember to switch up routine every 6-8 weeks and do all lifts as explosively as possible.    Make a resolution to do this for at-least 1 year and I guarantee you will dunk. Good luck."

This principle protects the space on the floor which he occupies and the space above him when he jumps vertically within that space. As soon as the player leaves his vertical position (cylinder) and body contact occurs with an opponent who had already established his own vertical position (cylinder), the player who left his vertical position (cylinder) is responsible for the contact.The defensive player must not be penalized for leaving the floor vertically (within his cylinder) or having his hands and arms extended above him within his own cylinder.""  http://imgur.com/yoVmhM8  Hope this helps!"
Basketball,2xv4ww,BW-Ryan,1 point,Wed Mar 4 13:22:27 2015 UTC,"So I think I figured it out.  Technically, as long as you are facing the opponent, not moving towards him, and he is also toughing the ground, you can move around in any other way.  The reason a lot of people get this wrong I think, is because when this play actually happens referees often have trouble figuring all of these factors out. Instead, they search for a few 'hints' to figure out what happened.  For instance, dipping your shoulder into someone isn't technically illegal. However if they're in Legal Guarding Position and you bump them enough that it affects their ability to make the play it is illegal. The other big thing with this, legal guarding position includes you have to be facing your opponent AND your opponent has to be on the ground. But it is almost impossible to put your shoulder into a guy's chest when they aren't facing you or you aren't on the ground. So while putting your shoulder into them isn't illegal, it tells the refs you did do something illegal.   The same is true for moving your legs. It's not technically illegal, but the refs often have trouble figuring out if you were moving towards them or who was in the air etc. So they know if your feet are set, while it isn't required, more often than not it means you were in legal guarding position.  They're like little cheats refs do cause they can't actually see all the action, and people confuse them for actual rules."
Basketball,2xumod,fariwow98,3,Wed Mar 4 00:28:03 2015 UTC,"Find out what you're good at and pride yourself in that. If you're a good rebounder and defender, take pride in that and don't force yourself to try and be the athletic score at will type player if that's not you. Practice every aspect of the game, at game speed. Because if you don't, when you actually play in games you're going to be using untapped gears that you're not used to using."

As an example, when i was in middle school I was 6'1'' and played the 4 and 5 and was a good back to the basket scorer and re-bounder.  However, once I got to HS I didn't grow another inch.  Long story short, a 6'1'' center doesn't make it very far.  I wish I would have worked harder on my handles and outside shooting..."

Easier said than done, but try to stay cool and collected. Play HARD. As in, push yourself to the physical limits. But don't be reckless. Just try to stay grounded and play at your best level within your skill set.   I don't know what kind of person messes around with a friend and teammate's girl, but you gotta let him know what's up as a professional. Pull him aside before the game and mention that it's a crappy thing to have done but that you're there to win, not cry about it. Drop that in his lap and go start warming up. If he's a good friend, he should have some empathy for you and at least show some remorse. He may not have realized the nature of your relationship with this girl. When dudes get attention from girls sometimes we don't think straight. He may not have considered the effect it would have on you. If he shrugs the whole thing off without any concern for how you feel, then he's not a friend you want to keep around.   Keep your chin up dude, there's plenty of great girls out there that will like you for whom you are and won't try to play games with your head. Go out there and have a great game kid.

Basketball,2x17pe,jmreicha,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"Here is a short bio: http://www.austinyouthbasketball.com/meetthecoaches/.   In short, basketball was really my passsion.  I was a below average small college basketball player that physically got way stronger later than most.  I fell in love with the science of player development watching and training with NBA players in the summer at a gym called the Spectrum Club in LA.    Like most small bootstrapped businesses, the fort is built one brick at a time.  No magic wands.  Just a ton of commitment to each client, communicating the value delivered quite often to their parent and coaches.  We now train over 140 kids, have camps and academies, and do coaches clinics too.   While growing, it is essential to stay focused on the growth of each kid and avoid the common, but less effective factory approach.    As far as difficulties of teaching the game...    Only work with players who are open to change.  You can really waste a family's time and money if you don't get to honesty about the fundamental need for change in playing habits and mindset.  Change is an inside job, I can only light their path, show them the way, encourage and hold accountable.  I made a choice to work with any player who loves the game and is open to change.  Teaching players to take layups off the correct foot can be less than glamorous.  The key is to make each workout your masterpiece as an instructor.  Teaching shooting form can be particularly challenging.  I can honestly say that teaching shooting is the equivalent to picking at another person's scab.  It is inherently annoying to that person.  Habits, and bad habits are very difficult to break and many people take shooting form way too personally.  Middle school coaches often don't have the expertise, and high school coaches claim to not have the time.  We do it because it needs to be done.   I hope that helps, but feel free to ask me more specific questions here or call me."

Best case scenario, you sprout up later back to your PF/C spot and have amazing skills for a big man...kind of like Anthony Davis. Good luck dude!"
Basketball,2wtq9t,zhangkevin14,4,Mon Feb 23 02:04:06 2015 UTC,3 to 4 times is a bit odd. Usually you 'check it up' where the offensive player passes to defender. This allows defense to get set. Defender passes back and it's time to start. Hope that helps

Basketball,2wszdc,MASTAH_BRUCE,5,Sun Feb 22 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"Lay on the ground staring at the ceiling with a basketball.  Shoot it straight up and hold your follow through.  When you can get it to come straight back down to your hand without moving it, every single time, then your shot will fly straight.  Or you can find a wall with a spot on it that's roughly basket height.  Just shoot over and over and over.  Make the ball hit that same spot every time with good arc.  That will help your shot become more accurate, and should help you have good arc on it as well.  The important thing is to do this with greet form every time.  I know it's boring, but you get better when no one is watching you."
Basketball,2wszdc,thesealwhisperer,3,Sun Feb 22 23:06:58 2015 UTC,You could make a mark/put a piece of tape 10` up on the wall of your house/a tree. Then you can just try to hit the mark/tape and it should be similar to hitting th back of the rim. This isn't perfect but if you can get to the point where you can hit the tape at a goo percentage then it shouldn't be hard to adjust a fact inches on a real hoop.
Basketball,2wszdc,Gfrolicious,3,Sun Feb 22 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"Lay on your back and hold the ball is if you were going to do a shot and ""shoot"" it straight up, hold the follow through and if your shot is on point it should come right back down to where you shot from, if it wanders off to the sides, correct as needed."

Basketball,2wszdc,brokenwords,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:46:47 2015 UTC,"In addition to laying on your back and shooting straight up.  Stand on a line about 10 feet long and shoot the ball high and straight so it bounces on the line about 10 feet away. The ball should go 11-12 feet up in an arc. Keep your release hand up until the ball hits the ground. At first it will go left and right.   Do ten reps, then do a set of wind sprints to get your heart rate up. repeat 3 to 10 times.  Do this exercise while your heart rate is elevated to simulate game situations.   Once you can hit the line regularly (9/10) move on to jump stops and a jump shot. Maintain form all the way through."

I was proud of him and then even with all the bullshit he was dealing with in Minny with Spree he still didn't want to leave until he was recruited by Ray and Paul.    Then he went to Boston and found out hes a total dick.   Now that hes back can I love him again, because that brought a whole wave of feelings.  I feel nostalgic.

Basketball,2wqig9,RockChalkBasketball,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:45:11 2015 UTC,"with defense i'd say make sure you are moving on the balls of your feet, not flat footed at all...shooting wise work on your form...shooting is all about making sure you get your feet set, focus on the center of the net, use your legs when you shoot, and keep your elbow in and off hand as the guide hand."
Basketball,2wqig9,vanillaafro,1 point,Sun Feb 22 06:53:03 2015 UTC,"One drill I used to do back in the day was to lie down on the floor with my head almost touching the wall and shoot the ball upwards. The ball should go straight up and straight down. If it touches the wall then your shot is a bit off and you need to readjust until you are consistently not touching the wall with the basketball. Also, observe the ball as it leaves your hand and check for adequate backspin.   What's the purpose of this? It helps to straighten out your shot. The more backspin the ball has, the more stable it goes. The more stable the ball is, the straighter the shot becomes. Shooting becomes a lot easier when you shoot the ball straight."

Basketball,2wm06q,bballer94,8,Sat Feb 21 02:21:35 2015 UTC,"It's good advice. Stay balanced and MAKE the ball handler change directions or hands (reaching in towards the ball puts you off balance). If you are quick enough, that direction/hand change will be your oppurtunity to get a hand in there. Remember that any decent handler will capitalize on an off balance defender. Bad ball handlers have serious weaknesses when changing hands or directions (and/or with height and strength of dribble). You kinda have to guess where they are going to put the ball without putting yourself off-balance and then go from there. Bad ball handlers also only have one or two go to moves.... stop those by anticipating them and force them to try something they are uncomfortable with. Steals against good ball handlers are tricky to do.... good luck."
Basketball,2wm06q,Ian_is_funny,7,Sat Feb 21 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"Don't commit to the steal. Poor defenders will lunge toward the ball, shifting their weight forward. This leaves you prone if you miss the ball, and you're more likely to get called for a reach in foul. Think of a steal as a two step process; first, tip the ball away (without shifting your weight forward and maintaining a balanced defensive stance). Once the ball is loose, then you attack it. This way, if you miss on the attempt to knock it loose, you won't be out of position.  As an additional tip, the best time to try and tip the ball away is when it is heading towards the floor and as it is bouncing up. This is because the offensive player cannot change the path or direction of the dribble once it's out of his hand. Hope this helps."
Basketball,2wm06q,Xlr8Stormz,2,Sat Feb 21 02:43:44 2015 UTC,I get steals solely off of passes. I predict the pass and when it happens I dart forward and get to the ball before they do. Dwyane Wade is very good at this. Watch some videos of him doing it. It's a very good strategy. Whatever you do don't reach. You reach. They teach.

Some of the best looks I get are quickly touching the line and pulling up. I was actually under the impression that this is the way everyone plays. I'm from NY if that makes any difference.
Basketball,2wmevm,RogueViator,1 point,Sat Feb 21 13:22:57 2015 UTC,The rule I've always followed is to clear the paint. Perhaps the only reason people clear it past the 3-pt line is to reset spacing.

Basketball,2we60q,-Real_Nword-,1 point,Thu Feb 19 04:54:49 2015 UTC,"I think there is a middle ground here.. and it's trying to place yourself as a small forward.   I would continue to work and focus on your guard skills: ball handling and shooting namely. Try and do your best to show that you are have superior guards skills, but remember that there is nothing more dangerous than a big guard that can shoot, jump, dribble, and is quick. If you can excel in that role it won't matter where your coach wants you to play, you'll be valuable at nearly every position.   It your coach continues to place you in big man drills and surrounds you with guards during games to force you to play a bigger position, probably a candid, mature discussion with him about your comfort and confidence levels in the two positions."

Basketball,2we60q,capital0,1 point,Thu Feb 19 04:54:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely practice your off hand. When warming up or practicing, you should be using your off hand MORE for layups and dribbling exercises than your strong hand. Practice passing with your off hand too, it will feel strange but getting comfortable throwing little flicks or bounce passes around a defender within your off hand makes you a very versatile player.  I can't stress that enough.  When dribbling get in the habit of not needing to look down at the ball and keeping your head up. Be very intentional about this, and really try hard to always be looking at the basket if your playing by yourself.  As for specific drills just google various shooting and dribbling drills and you'll find stuff. But my keep take aways for training guards is working with your off hand and being able to handle the ball without looking down."
Basketball,2wel9n,TheKnightLucario,3,Thu Feb 19 06:21:18 2015 UTC,"Are you athletic? How's your ball handling? As a D3 player for 2 years, I know a 6 foot guy can't be a small forward, that's drastically undersized. Pg or SG only if you're a pure shooter/scorer. I know D3 play varies greatly by conference, but in california you might be in for some trouble. If you're fully grown height wise, I'd recommend putting in work on ball handling, court awareness, and passing, maybe try to shift into a more ball-dominant pg role on your team. can you shoot 3s?"

Your best shot to be an impact player at the next level is to keep working on scoring and ballhandling, and really try to slide over to the shooting guard position.  Being a guard that can rebound is always a bonus.  And I know for a fact that the two schools you mentioned play in one of the most competitive divisions in all of d3, so it's a good idea to put yourself in the best situation to succeed."
Basketball,2wel9n,thesealwhisperer,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:12:39 2015 UTC,Okay. What can I do to improve my chances of being recruited? My coach uses a 3-2 offense so I'm essentially playing the role of a guard on the wing most of the time. What else can I do to improve my shot and ball handling? I am planning on spending most of this offseason (especially the summer) shooting and dribbling at least 4-5 hours a day. Should I focus mostly on long threes since its harder to guard a long three than one right on the line? Thanks so much for your advice!
Basketball,2wel9n,thesealwhisperer,1 point,Fri Feb 20 00:48:56 2015 UTC,"Well, you can do just fine in an offense like that to get recruited.  There are multitudes of drills out there for helping you with ball handling, so if you learn a handful of them you'll be plenty busy this offseason.    Honestly, there's not really a point in spending a ton of time practicing threes from way beyond the arc.  Getting better at shooting is always the same: when you were younger you probably only shot from close in because that's all most young kids are good at.  But as you got older you extended your range.  Same goes for threes.  Until you can pretty consistently make about 75% of your threes when you're shooting uncontested, there's no reason to step back.  Range also just comes with age and strength.  As I got older, I became a stronger person and now anywhere within about 3 feet of the line is ""in range"" for me.  Also, spend time shooting free throws.  Like a lot.  I know it's not glamorous or exciting, but I can promise you it makes a huge difference.  being an 80+% free throw shooter means you will always be on the court at the end of games when shooting is needed.  If you really want to get recruited, the best thing you can do is make sure to get on an AAU team that travels to tournaments around the state, region, or country.  College coaches are always watching AAU games in the summer, so that's the easiest way to get on someone's radar."
Basketball,2wel9n,thesealwhisperer,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:06:22 2015 UTC,Okay. Thank you for the advice. I was a 87.6% free throw shooter this season if it matters. I am unable to join an aau team though because I move around a lot in the summer going all over the place for academic internships and camps

I don't actually get to post up very often cause I'm pretty skinny but I honestly think that the footwork involved helped me when I do get into the lane.

Basketball,2we6ok,calpolyman,2,Thu Feb 19 08:57:26 2015 UTC,"I'm 6'4 and consider myself a SG. You have to start slow and attack. Don't try to run past your opponent, that's too obvious. Keep the ball on the side away from them and walk up to them. Then, start running as fast as you can and try to incorporate a dribble move to further get them away from you. You don't have to ""break ankles"" but you have to catch them off guard. Once you get past the 3 point line keep the ball low until you get a couple feet past the free throw line. Once you do that keep the ball as far back and high as you can and make a lay up/pass."
Basketball,2we6ok,cunning_linguist_69,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:20:40 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest things you can do to improve your driving game is to get used to squaring up to the basket in shooting position when you catch the ball. Many guards are lazy about this, and as a result the defense can leave space on the catch, and close out when the guard moves into a shooting position. By always squaring up in a shooting position you force your defender to close out on the catch, which opens them up to you attacking while they are moving towards you. You might think your role is to drive, but if no one is afraid of your jump shot, it gets a lot harder to beat your defender."

Of the people there I was the worst on the team. I finally get in to the game and everyone on my bench is cheering. First offensive possession I run down the floor and set up near the elbow. Our point guard (who is notorious for no look passes) starts driving. I am expecting the no look pass but then he keeps driving. The moment I think he's going to layup he passes the ball. Hard. Right into my face. Ball nails me in the face hard and I kinda flail for a second and make a terrible face. Luckily I kept the ball, but it was definitely embarrassing in front if all the people."

You will typically get better results with strength training by doing just enough to get the body to compensate for the work, rest to allow this to happen, and repeat this cycle as often as possible. This doesn't mean you can't work hard in the gym, just that you don't need to go so hard that you blow yourself up one day a week and need 6 days to recover. Get plenty of food and sleep on your rest days and there is no reason you can't lift 3 days a week."

I did venture out to look at the box score for this game, and here are a few stats:   The winning team team took a shot on average every 24 seconds in the game (assuming 10 minute quarters, which I think is standard for HS games).  This includes any time that the opponents had the ball. The winning team took 18 3-pointers. The winning team had 10 players who scored points.  I couldn't tell the minutes each person played.  The best player (per PPG) on the winning team scored 43 points and took 26 shots. The losing team scored their two points in the third quarter, both on free throws.

Taking a shot every 24 seconds when you are up by 100 points at halftime is sad.  I'm not sure if it's better or worse, but the winning team only scored 9 points in the 4th quarter.

Basketball,2vld2c,ec20,3,Thu Feb 12 17:22:36 2015 UTC,I bought a couple and can vouch that it's legit. Got the same feel and everything. It's been back since December.

Basketball,2vld2c,StillonLs,1 point,Thu Feb 12 04:02:04 2015 UTC,"Texture, feel, bounciness. Just everything is perfect to me. But it's not as unanimous as it seems going by this thread.   Everywhere I play, this TF is always the game ball."
Basketball,2vld2c,sebulbaa,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"I can ditto that. Everywhere I play, if there's a TF-1000 that's still in good shape everyone wants it to be the game ball.  The ball has a great grip without being tacky. The Wilson Evolution accomplishes this by making their balls spongy. It's not bad but it doesn't feel real. The TF-1000 is still hard and firm, but they accomplish the great grip by using this material that feels very close to leather."

I haven't touched the TF-1000 since.  I find the TF-1000 too hard, and ""plastic-y"" compared to the GF7. The GF7 has soft leather with great grip.   the TF just feels like a rock after playing with the GF7."

Basketball,2vm3rx,ginol1224,0,Thu Feb 12 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely terrible advice for a high school player. Players with unorthodox shooting form that are consistent and reliable shooters are the rare exception.   There is a very good reason to learn appropriate shooting form. It uses an economy of motion so that it is easier to perform correctly every time, and it sets the body up so that the shooting motion extends the ball directly towards the rim without having to alter its path during the shot motion.  For fixing the guide hand, a big key is to really focus on the finish position of the shot. Take a shot, leave your hands up, and examine where your guide hand is. It should be sitting with a more or less 90 degree bend at the elbow and your thumb pointing directly back to your body. If your elbow guide arm is extended you are pushing the ball with that hand and if the guide hand has rotated it has pushed the ball off-target in some way. Watch Kyle Korver for examples of how this is supposed to look."
Basketball,2vm3rx,capital0,2,Sat Feb 14 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"Actually most people don't shoot in a ""textbook"" Kyle Korver way. It's that type of advice that ruins player shot because people like you tell him his form is all wrong. If he's making the shot leave him alone.   As far as ""rare occasion"" most people don't exactly shoot textbook anymore. Look at Stephen Curry for example his isn't text book. Neither is Kyrie Irvings."
Basketball,2vm3rx,GuntherTime,1 point,Sat Feb 14 04:45:17 2015 UTC,"Well, now OP has two opinions he can work with. One that suggest shooting coaching is a good idea and some examples of where to get started, and another which suggests he should stick with what he has got and keep polishing it. Hopefully which ever choice he makes serves him well."
Basketball,2vm3rx,capital0,1 point,Sun Feb 15 18:36:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough indeed. But don't think I don't agree with your logic, I'd be with you if he said he wasn't hitting his shots. But sense he seems to able to make shots and as some whose also said to have a ""broken shot"" and can still hit threes I don't want him to forced to change his shot because it doesn't look pretty."
Basketball,2vm3rx,GuntherTime,1 point,Mon Feb 16 06:30:20 2015 UTC,"I get where you are coming from, but also keep in mind that he is starting high school basketball and it is probably his coaches that are recommending that he fix his ""bad form."" He is also asking how to make his shot more one handed and fix issues with his guide hand, which strongly suggests he is pushing the ball with both hands.   I coach 7th and 8th grade players so I see kids in this situation all the time, and a lot of them do refuse to work on changing their shot mechanics because they can hit shots. The trouble is that they don't shoot nearly as high a percentage as they think they do, and their form mechanics are a big reason for that. They get into competitive 5 on 5 play and their scoring disappears because they are so easy to block they can't shoot over defenders.   If we were talking to an adult player with limited practice time who plays in rec league ball then I can agree that you don't necessarily need to be messing around with shot mechanics, but for a high school player not fixing this can mean the difference between playing or riding the pine."
Basketball,2vm3rx,capital0,1 point,Mon Feb 16 18:19:16 2015 UTC,I understand that to. But I guess we can't really know until we know what type of percentages that he's hitting. I mean Currys shit was changed in high school not because it was bad or he wasn't hitting but it was to slow.

Try to make it so that whatever you can do on your right hand, you can do with your left ( driving, dribbling, etc ). Don't always rush and be a ball hog get in triple threat and look at your options sometimes if you have a instant lane just take it. Other than that try to practice fundamentals as much as possible. Look up some training videos online, they help. Keep on ballin!"
Basketball,2vieb1,iPinoySaint,2,Wed Feb 11 07:16:43 2015 UTC,"Dribble, practice moving while dribbling. But not just one ball always dribble two balls at once. Keep your eyes up.

Basketball,2vieb1,Shake25,2,Wed Feb 11 07:22:26 2015 UTC,"In the meantime try to do the little things that great players do, box out on rebounds, crash for them, follow your own shots, make sure you let teammates know about picks set on them, know when to switch or help on defense.set picks..... hustle for loose balls, the rest of the stuff will come with practice, hustle is huge in basketball."
Basketball,2vieb1,trecool88,2,Wed Feb 11 16:59:17 2015 UTC,Pretty much just practice alot. shoot around while keeping your form the same everytime. Also working on dribbling up and down the court. Or post moves if you play down low.

Basketball,2vieb1,shaky_handed_surgeon,2,Fri Feb 13 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"Build a correct and consistent shooting form. Getting into a good shooting position starts before you even catch the ball, so make sure you are getting it right from the start. The defense has to believe you can shoot a jump shot for everything else to work. Learn to pivot correctly and how to sweep the ball high and low while pivoting. A huge source of turnovers for new players is that they don't know how to effectively pivot to fight off defensive pressure, and they bring the ball across their body which makes it easy to grab or knock away. Square up to the basket ready to shoot on every catch of the ball from every position on the court. This makes you an offensive threat to both shoot and dribble, and equally importantly makes sure that you can see your teammates on both sides of the court. This makes a huge difference and is easy to learn. Learn to dribble in both directions with each hand. You don't have to be fast or flashy with the dribble, but you do need to be able to stay balanced and protect the ball against defensive pressure.  Learn to jump stop. The jump stop is a must have tool for ending a dribble drive in balance which allows you to shoot or pass the ball without traveling, and many other situations.    Those are five of the most important offensive focuses you would hopefully have been coached on if you had learned to play earlier in life. If you can put those together you will be able to contribute well on offense."

I had a guy on high school with a rep for ""throwing"" elbows and it was stupid but the refs knew and he would get flagrants.  It gets trickier in pickup. You get more frustrated guys trying to make cheap steals off a good rebound, reaching in and when the rebounder swings through with elbows in a normal protective basketball move,  people can get hurt and all hell  breaks loose."
Basketball,2vd7uh,MatthewH13,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"If you are doing it by chinning the ball and pivoting, then you are doing it right.

Basketball,2ve3cd,KF43,2,Tue Feb 10 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"I have experienced it when I was younger playing with older brothers, it's pretty terrible.

Basketball,2ve3cd,seekhimthere,2,Tue Feb 10 12:32:49 2015 UTC,"Keep training as per normal, but when you play with your friends, show ultra Hustle plays. If you don't develop the skills yet, make it up but running the court, fast breaks, going back and D like mad. Go for rebounds. Just keep hustling. Once they see your Hustle efforts, you will gain more respect. Besides there isn't much D against constant running and fast breaks. Any team always love a player that plays all out. That's how I was at first. I have not much offense, just very defense oriented. I D like mad, and go crazy for rebounds. It keep going on for few years until my very late breakout when I was much older where I improved drastically in offense, shooting, 3pt, drives etc. It definitely helps that I still have my basic Hustle defense. Now when I play, I keep running fast breaks during offense. Most people get tired to chase. Stamina is much easier to train than skills."
Basketball,2ve3cd,andriask,2,Tue Feb 10 14:20:44 2015 UTC,confidence in yourself and your shot is huge in basketball. It's just as important as skill at the pickup level. Get really good at a few simple moves and it will go a long ways.   I found this drill where you take turns going one on one with someone. The premise is you can only dribble three times and then you have to shoot it or its a turn over. It helped me a lot.

Basketball,2ve3cd,Nweber15,1 point,Thu Feb 12 08:46:52 2015 UTC,"One of the best ways to develop trust and confidence for your teammates is to become an effective passer, and in the process your entire game will improve. If your team feels they can trust you with the ball, and you help them score, you will get many more touches. There is a lot more to this than just throwing the ball though.   Square up to the basket on every catch in a good shooting position. This makes you an offensive threat and requires the defense to adjust. Even more important though, squaring to the basket allows you to see both sides of the court and where your teammates are. Use pass and shot fakes to open up passing lanes to your team. Fake one to make one is a common basketball saying, and many players are not very good at this. When you do not have the ball cut hard into the spaces in the defense with your hands up and ready to catch a pass. By beating your defender into a good spot, and being ready to score on the catch, the defense will have to adjust to you. When they make that adjustment you can move the ball to another player who should have a good chance to score. The above tips will make your a better all around attacking player, and because your primary action will be to move the ball to a teammate in a better position, the times you do attack the basket will be unpredictable and more likely to succeed.    These tips don't require a lot of talent to get better at. If you focus on doing these things consistently they will quickly become habit, and you will improve as a player."

Basketball,2v7boc,acrossover23,5,Sun Feb 8 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"A few tips from a HS Coach: Wing play is not as daunting as it might seem. Make small gains and you will be fine, but be prepared as moving to a new role usually has an adjustment period.   Shot issues: You are likely following through with both hands which is not what you want. Form shoot with one hand for 5 minutes every day. Your guard hand should release the ball as your elbow, wrist and fingertips follow through with the shot.   http://youtu.be/YIHjdVteO2A  Quickness: Rope ladder drills, box jumps. Moderate weight high rep front/back squats, power cleans, dead lifts, bench press. Hit the weights!   Wing play: Improve dribbling particularly weak hand through experience. Work it every day. Two ball dribbling drills found on YouTube can be a big help. You should focus more on learning how to pass and be a threat on the perimeter. If you catch the ball and don't get into a triple threat position defenders will sag off and cause problems for your team. Work on your catch and shoot, rip one dribble and pull up, rip one dribble and layup at the rim. You don't need to be Allen Iverson to play the wing position.   If you have questions I'm happy to try and help! Good luck."

Basketball,2v7boc,Twist_Back,1 point,Sun Feb 8 17:13:20 2015 UTC,from my experience when playing the wing you need to learn how to move without the ball. This is usually a backdoor cut or screen. You need to be able to catch and shoot from either wing with high efficiency as well. Dribbling isn't as important at the wings as it would be anywhere else so i wouldn't necessarily focus on it.

For offense: Shooting jumpshots, looking into the form of other shooters, looking at youtube videos, reworking my entire form and solidifying the new technique in and out of games. For triple threat, in and out of games working on a quickening my first step, working on ball fakes and once again the jumpshot. For palming a basketball I am getting a new ball (old one is an indoor/outdoor thats all worn and dusty), working on fingertip exercises, looking into martial art techniques... dribbling and shooting with my offhand requires doing jump that.

Basketball,2v2462,Natural_Born_Baller,1 point,Sat Feb 7 04:08:43 2015 UTC,"If you lead with the foot on the same side of the drive, it is called a ""direct drive."" This step should be made as directly towards the basket as possible and the hips kept low to the ground. The goal is to get past the hips of your defender so they cannot slide over to stop your attack. A direct drive is the quickest first step you can generate, but if your defender anticipates it and reacts quickly it is easier for the defender to stop.     If you lead with the opposite foot, for example stepping right with the left foot, it is a ""crossover drive."" A crossover drive is a bit slower than a direct drive, but has the advantage of immediately putting your defender behind you if you can step past them. From that position, it is extremely difficult for the defender to recover. Like with the direct drive, the crossover step should be performed as directly towards the basket as possible while keeping the hips low to the ground.      You really need to be able to use both effectively, particular the aspects of staying low, attacking directly towards the basket, and learning not to travel. To prevent traveling calls and make sure that you stay in balance on the dribble, aim to have the dribble land at the same time as the first step. Once you can use both drive types effectively in both direction the jab step becomes dangerous because it can then be easily converted into a direct drive in the same direction, or a crossover drive in the other direction."

Don't reach young blood; Just play lock down defense. The guy is either going to give it up, or more than likely miss.   Third I don't understand why you are shooting threes as a center but you should stop or switch to power forward. If you think you can really shoot. You tall get the ball play tough and back them down. If your team mate shooting get the rebound and put it back up.   Fourth use the backboard for lay ups it is not about looking nice it is about points. Aim for the square. That is what it's there for.

I try to steal the ball because when we play man to man marking, people dont close down the short guy. He is a really good dribbler and when I'm not going for rebounds I'm closing people down. Maybe I shouldnt be doing that?  I will try to stop shooting threes then if I shouldnt be doing that.  Sometime my layups go right over the hoop when I'm coming in from the side if I time it really poorly. I will try to bounce it off the backboard from now on.  Thanks alot for your help!

Basketball,2uz668,winningtandem,0,Fri Feb 6 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"Cool thanks, I will check it out. But if you are playing center there is no need for you to be trying to steal the ball. Especially if he is a good dribbler; he will blow right pass you nine times out of ten. Your hands should be up to defend the shot and get the rebound on misses. The only time I try to steal the ball is when I see somebody pulling up to shoot. Then I try to smack it down. Maybe you can learn to do that. But if you are playing man then play your man. If you are playing zone don't sit in the paint, hang around close to there. Box out other defenders grab rebounds. If you want to get better at laying it up from the side then stand close to the basket and shoot until 10-20. If you miss or if it touches the rim then start over. Once you make ten or five all net switch sides. Keep doing that; after a while try laying it up. But for now use that backboard."

Basketball,2uz668,bruisecraft,4,Fri Feb 6 13:23:09 2015 UTC,Don't try to steal the ball by swiping at it. Use your height and try to block the shot.  You should definitely practice your mid range game. That should be enough if they want you to space the floor. Just keep practicing. You might find overhand layups easier right now though. I suggest learning fundamental moves first.    Just keep practicing. :)

Basketball,2uz668,zegogo,2,Fri Feb 6 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"Defense is played with your feet/body position not with your hands. Slide in front of the player with the ball to make him turn away from the basket. Angle your body to force him to go to his weak hand (usually left). If they go up to shoot just make yourself as tall as possible so they have to adjust the shot. Stop shooting the threes. Start with layups and midrange shots if they are open. Once you get comfortable with your mid-range shots, then you can slowly start moving your range back towards the 3 point line. Practice. Find some time where you have a hoop to yourself and do the Mikan drill over and over and over. You can find it on youtube.  Once you are nearly automatic with your layups you can start by developing a drop step. This is where you have the ball in the post and you pivot and step outside the defenders leg to seal them on your back or to your side to get either a layup or a little baby hook shot. Once you get comfortable with your layups, try working on that short hook shot from the block, and if you can learn to do it with both hands you will be twice as good. When people start respecting your post moves or your jumper you can give them a head/ball fake to get them off their feet so you can go around them."

Basketball,2uz3r3,DeepBrown13,6,Fri Feb 6 11:10:14 2015 UTC,"Zone defences are very weak to strong outside shooters, which as you know there are plenty of in the NBA, so while you may be effective at defending the area around the paint you become very exposed to the long 3, which is much more of a worry in the NBA where all starting guards are going to be a threat, as opposed to college basketball where the standard isn't as high.  Further more the zone defence means it can be more difficult to match up with opposition players quickly for defensive rebounds.  Lastly because of its inherent nature the zone defence will have gaps in it, which are supposed to be filled by players shuffling into position as needed on defence. However in the NBA the sheer athleticism of many of the players, especially the guards and small forwards, means that even the smallest gap can be exploited. people like lebron, rose, Irving, the clippers duo etc would have a field day against all but the best zone defences!"

Basketball,2uz3r3,91G00S3,2,Mon Feb 16 01:34:59 2015 UTC,"Good shooters expose the zone. Very very seldom but every once and a while you will see a team use zone if the opposing team isn't shooting well from the outside and killing them in the paint. There are actually rules in the NBA that discourage some defense such as defensive 3 seconds in the key, which make it very difficult to play zone."
Basketball,2uz3r3,Westerbergs_Smokes,2,Fri Feb 6 15:07:47 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that zone plays a small but prominent role in NBA defense.  Notably, in their 2011 championship run the Mavericks employed frequent use of zone defense against the Heat."
Basketball,2uz3r3,Trashyy,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:45:31 2015 UTC,Yep. Carlisle and his staff wrote the book at slowing down Lebron and the Heat. Use the zone to keep them out of the paint and turn the team into shooters.
Basketball,2uz3r3,capital0,2,Sat Feb 7 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"You beat a zone defense by attacking the gaps in the defense before it can close them, and by moving the ball faster than the defense can shift to cover the weakness. In youth basketball, zones are effective because the players are not strong enough to make the passes required to exploit the defensive shifts, they are not fast enough to take advantage of the interior gaps before they can close, and they are not consistent enough in long range shooting to force the defense to extend.  In the NBA, the players do not have these weaknesses. All the guards are outstandingly athletic and the post players play above the rim. Varsity High School and College play is where the zone is most interesting and balanced."

Basketball,2uxrie,gart888,7,Fri Feb 6 01:37:14 2015 UTC,1) you CAN NOT dribble again if that occurs. 2) You CAN dribble if that occurs 3)You CAN dribble if that occurs  You are able to dribble again after you pick up your dribble ONLY if the defender knocks it OUT of your hands
Basketball,2uxrie,Canone743,4,Fri Feb 6 02:04:59 2015 UTC,"From the Official NBA Rulebook 2014-2015, Section II - Dribble, page 34:   e. A player may dribble a second time if he lost control of the ball because of: (1) [...] (2) An opponent touching the ball (3) [...]   So, you can start dribbling again if you have lost control of the ball and if an opponent touched the ball.  Therefore:   You cannot start another dribble, because you have not lost control of the ball. Since touching the ground is not listed as a requirement and you lost control of the ball because another player touched it, you can start another dribble. You can start to dribble again (same logic as #2).   In other words, they have to slap it out of your hands."

Also, try and stay towards the centre of the court. It keeps your options open and prevents the defense from using the sideline as an extra man."
Basketball,2uyehu,MarioSpeedwagon13,2,Fri Feb 6 10:34:13 2015 UTC,"As some of the other comments have said, you have to give up some rebounding to prevent the breaks. I would use your size to your advantage and have any interior plays go for rebounds, but anyone on the perimeter immediately get all the way back to protect the rim. This should turn transition opportunities into jump shots.  The biggest threat in a press is the trap, and if you are bigger than the opposing team you should be able to see over the trap effectively which is a huge advantage. Space the floor effectively, use passes to quickly reverse the ball across the court, and make sure that someone is always trailing the ball handler as an outlet and you should be able to neutralize the press. Remember to use pivots to create space against aggressive on-ball defenders in a press and keep the ball high."
Basketball,2uyehu,capital0,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:41:58 2015 UTC,"Well first off, if the big team can't keep up man to man, then they should play a zone defense, preferably a 2-3 zone considering the fast small guys probably can't shoot well.   Bring up the court through passing and spacing, keeping dribbling to a minimum, don't get cute and try to run pick and rolls. Keep the passes at overhead level and pass high, use the height to your advantage.   For transition D, make sure you designate a couple safety players that leak out and run back on defense, preferably your 1 or 2. Key point is, you guys will have to hustle when they start running on transition so there is no escaping from that.   good luck."
Basketball,2uyehu,chiefff,1 point,Fri Feb 6 05:20:19 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything except P&R. On offense, you need to play real basketball and force the team to react. Pick and rolls are analogous to turning on the light and watching all the roaches flee. Always run P&R  even against a zone (YES I SAID THAT) and make sure you screen off the ball too.  Get their defense in react mode."
Basketball,2uyehu,_carnivorous_,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:32:37 2015 UTC,Transition D is a only a problem when you aren't smart. Look at the Spurs. Those dinosaurs were amazing on transition D cause they didn't really take bad shots (as in shots with a long miss to a point guard to take off) and when they did they had a man back there already. Your point guard (or fastest guy) needs to be the first one back on defense unless he's going for a lay up. Once a shot goes up someone needs to be running back to prevent that break or slow it up enough for help to arrive.
Basketball,2uyehu,GuntherTime,1 point,Fri Feb 6 15:06:49 2015 UTC,apples to oranges.  Can't compare this person to the Spurs.   Swallow your pride and get back on D early.
Basketball,2uyehu,_carnivorous_,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:30:59 2015 UTC,The only comparison is that they team is older. I only used the Spurs to say just because your older and slower doesn't mean you can't play great defense again the younger faster guys.

Basketball,2uyehu,_carnivorous_,1 point,Sun Feb 8 01:40:19 2015 UTC,"Do not get killed in transition. The younger, faster teams thrive on this.  It's their mantra to ""get out and run"" and play with reckless abandon.  Take that away from them.  Do not try to crash the boards on defense. Instead once your shot goes up get back on D unless you are in the paint already.  Slow the game down and make them execute out of half court sets."
Basketball,2uyehu,_carnivorous_,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone, we'll see how we go in a couple of weeks when we re-match this team.    Basically I've decided as some have said, 1 and 2's sag on offense to slow down the fast breaks(we have two short guys that can hustle), foul hard if necessary(try to fatigue them with physicality).    The main focus with the offense will be just to get it in the post and use the height/physicality for the easy shots, but secondly also to push them around and wear them down (again trying to kill their endurance/enthusiasm for full court press).    As for the full court press they apply, again, the idea of pass high is the way to do it, play up the center, hopefully with the fouling in transition D(if hustle doesn't work first of course ;) ) and abusing the hell out of our physicality advantage, we'll have the endurance to match them the whole game.    For our D we pretty much always play a 2-3 zone, in our league there's only a handful of teams that can shoot outside, so we play a tight zone and force the outside shot, have the lowest points against rating in the league as a result.

I say work on your shot and decision making skills. I play pickup basketball with guys in their 40s who can still run the court. They're not the tallest, fastest or the best, but they're smart and the few things they do well, they abuse. If you're not quick, tall or an automatic shooter, work on your decision making. Watch game tape and how to's on line. Study the game, things like that.   Edit: forgot to say, work on your defense too. If guys can see that you're a liability they'll expose it when playing against you. Stay on the ground and in front of your man, hands up and talk on defense.  And play hard. You can be the worst basketball player on the court, but if you crash the boards and dive for every loose ball the other guys will notice and its a way to contribute."
Basketball,2ut5cd,traksta15,6,Wed Feb 4 23:42:54 2015 UTC,"Your best bet would be to practice playing as a point guard or shooting guard. Basically work on your shot and ball handling. It's going to be tough to drive to the rim when they have good centers. That doesn't mean you should completely ingore driving though, mastering the triple threat is very important for any guard.

Basketball,2ut5cd,Instantcoffees,2,Thu Feb 5 01:02:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you have available. If you have a buddy willing to train with you, it's always good practice to do 1v1's and try to get shots off. If not, you could use one of those dummies to do so if you have them available.   Ball handling just takes time. Try practicing it by going from one end of the court to the other while alternating speed and hands. You can also try to go to the other side of the court whilst dribbling behind your back or through your legs. Also controlling either basketballs or tennisballs horizontally against a wall works great.   When it comes to shooting, just practice practice. Try to practice different ranges and try to shoot from the fly aswell as taking your time to shoot. You can also practice your shot when there isn't a goal around. Simply practice your shooting motion by shooting straight up and catching the ball again."

Basketball,2ut5cd,Instantcoffees,2,Thu Feb 5 00:23:21 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying, it's not too easy to block people who are 10-20 cm bigger than you if they are any good at the game. Unless you are playing at a very low level of play. I'm retired from competition now and only play with some friends on low level leagues. Yet even in my current team, you'd probably be one of the smaller players and most likely a designated point guard. So from my experience, it would seem kind of weird to describe yourself as a ""shot blocker""  at your height. Even if you can jump really high, against good players you will come up short. It's really easy to fake out or to time your shot correctly against someone who has to rely on his jumping ability to block or defend."
Basketball,2ut5cd,townie_immigrant,2,Thu Feb 5 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, I'm definitely the shorter/est in the league.  I'm just saying that although it's rare and not so easy, height can be overcome.  I do decently though (probably because of my fatass that allows me to box out and my timing)"
Basketball,2ut5cd,Instantcoffees,2,Thu Feb 5 00:38:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not saying that you can't overcome height. You can be a great player, regardless of height. It's just that if you are his height, I would not focus on shotblocking and more on ballhandling and shooting. If on man defense, you should be defending the opposing teams point guard. When in a zone defense you should be defending on the outskirts of the defense or providing help defense."

Basketball,2us41k,Xlr8Stormz,2,Wed Feb 4 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"This might be what you're looking for? He doesn't seem to have a lot of arm movement, but it seems like a pretty useful move regardless."

He does the euro step, and while I don't ever really do it, I'll admit it's a respectable move. You want to fake one direction like you're driving that way, stop your dribble and change directions and score that way. I'm sure you can find a James Harden or Manu Ginobili eurostep highlight reel and see how they do it."

Basketball,2urim7,Shake25,5,Wed Feb 4 19:51:42 2015 UTC,"It will take time and some tests to see if it will actually help the game. But you have to admit game plans like holding onto the ball for an entirety of a quarter is just not the game of basketball. The fact that the other team couldn't get the ball is on the opposing team themselves, but the holding of the ball is something that is just not basketball and obviously needed to be addressed in this game."
Basketball,2urim7,Wannydogoman,-1,Wed Feb 4 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest though I think it can be part of the game if basketball. When I was coaching we did that to a team that was vastly better then us and ended up winning. We lost 60 to 30 earlier in year to them. They decided to not play defense more than we decided to not play offense. The plan was to spread them thin and expose the middle, but they decided to sit in the middle. Not really our fault. Now granted our score was more than 2-0, but still."
Basketball,2urim7,Shake25,3,Wed Feb 4 22:15:12 2015 UTC,"I still feel the name of the game is to score. It may work for some teams, but I just don't think it's good basketball at all."
Basketball,2urim7,Wannydogoman,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:30:21 2015 UTC,It wasn't our main game but it isn't the normal game plan for this team either. It's a singular situation
Basketball,2urim7,Shake25,1 point,Wed Feb 4 23:16:11 2015 UTC,We never had an official shot clock when I played at club level. The refs were to keep a rough idea of the possession time (~30 seconds) and call it when there was a violation.   Beats a team holding the ball for an entire quarter.

Basketball,2ugig7,trx250,3,Sun Feb 1 23:41:00 2015 UTC,"An immediate problem you have identified is 28 turnovers, chances are a lot of this is confidence issues. I recommend tackling the 28 turnovers on paper, how did they come about? Bad passing? Ball stolen? From there you will notice your turnover number will drop and your team will gain confidence with the ball. Try using off ball offense/defense to protect the ball as well! :) Good luck!"
Basketball,2ugig7,aintralphtho,2,Mon Feb 2 00:44:25 2015 UTC,Thanks. Most of our problem is bad passing. We always make the same chest pass without reading the defense. So it just gets picked off
Basketball,2ugig7,deeb332,3,Mon Feb 2 01:07:56 2015 UTC,"Create new plays. If you have one or two good ball-handlers on your team who can take it to the basket, you can easily lower your turnover %. Good Luck! :)"
Basketball,2ugig7,aintralphtho,3,Mon Feb 2 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"No worries man! Yeah if that's the case where you're getting your passing lanes cut off, I would definitely try and run different plays as mentioned above. Get your 4/5 to set screens for your 1/2 to make easier passes or even try using bounce passes. If people are moving off the ball more and finding space your passes should be more efficient! I would like to know how you end up at the end of the year :)"

Basketball,2uhktt,theangrypenguin101,3,Mon Feb 2 05:29:15 2015 UTC,"It's incredibly difficult to practice chucking a ball at half court consistently. A dunk/short shot has a high conversion rate, while the half court does not. No matter how much you practice, it's hard to beat a dunk's success rate. They practice three pointers, which give you the three you would if you made half court shots. Those are more practical, but like you said, they're guarded. Truth be told, a guarded three point shot is easier to hit than a lob from half court."
Basketball,2uhktt,Binatko,1 point,Mon Feb 2 06:21:48 2015 UTC,"Its all about percentages. Dunking, layups, and inside the paint are all high percentage shots. Shooting from the 3 is a low percentage shot. For example Deandre Jordan exclusively dunks and his percentage is around 70% while a jump shooter like Steph Curry shoots a 40% behind the arc which is above average. Shooting a half court shot has a even lower percentage. Its a really dumb shot. That's why you only take it when time is expiring."
Basketball,2uhktt,aperfectTOOL,1 point,Mon Feb 2 09:03:50 2015 UTC,"Your starters are your best players, and you don't want to take possessions away from your best players by taking shots 47 feet away. LeBron taking a shot from 5 feet away for 2 points (plus potential for fouls) or LeBron taking an uncontested shot from 47 feet away for 3 points? You don't see football teams settling for 49 yard field goals on 1st and 10 do you? It is the same principle here. If a shot from 40 feet away was worth 4 points, then there'd totally be a place for it. But generally, teams aren't guarding players until they are 25-27 feet away from the hoop anyway, and that's just ballhandlers.   Plus, there's lots of bigs in the league who probably can shoot but teams won't let them, even uncontested 3 pointers (Andrew Bynum). No way these control freak coaches would let them shoot from half court on purpose."

Basketball,2udpkz,NME_SkyTemplar,6,Sun Feb 1 05:10:12 2015 UTC,"Do your usual routine, mine was 2 dribbles while slightly bending my knees then gather take a deep breath and then release. But with loud crowds make sure you concentrate at the rim the whole time!! While doing this constantly think about putting the ball right over the rim. This way you are only focusing on making the shot and nothing else. The noise becomes obsolete after the first few you drain."
Basketball,2udpkz,Gphillysteak,2,Sun Feb 1 09:06:21 2015 UTC,I just always kinda numbed it out. I'd hear all the noises of people screaming but it wouldn't register. But if that doesn't work usually with family crowds like that it's loud all the way through so if you can hit a three with all that noise a free shot shouldn't be to hard right?

Basketball,2ucsl9,ilovepotatoes25,8,Sat Jan 31 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"Start getting aggressive with your defense and rebounding. Forget about the offensive side of the game put all your energy towards defense. Stop the player you guarding from scoring like your life depends on it. Go for rebounds like they are years of your life you are saving! This alone will make you look huge on the court your presence will be noticed, your teammates will notice this and feel better when you are on the court backing them up. After you hype yourself up and make everyone know you are there for business start being more the offense little by little.  ALWAYS start with defense."
Basketball,2ucsl9,Clavo_PR,3,Sun Feb 1 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. It starts with defense and hustle. Doing the work most teammates don't want to do. You will soon find your teammates will feed off of your energy and hustle. Just remember that nothing is guaranteed in life...what I mean is that the privilege of playing on a team and to expirence that brotherhood might not be there for ya in the future. So with that in mind... What is there to fear? To quote MJ, ""never say never, because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.""  Best of luck in your teams championship run!"
Basketball,2ucsl9,5000_Dimensions,3,Sun Feb 1 01:09:13 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I'm not sure what the experience level of these other guys is, but I've played in 3 state championship games and have been a 4-year starter on my college team...so I have plenty of real experience in these situations.  The less you care about the outcome of each individual play, and just do what you do, you'll be fine.  Also, a short memory is key!  My coach used to have us say ""I'm not going to make every shot, just the next one"" which means that you're confident every time you shoot that it'll be the one that goes in.  However, none of us can give you what you need.  You have to KNOW that you are the man!  And as a 16 y.o that's getting significant playing time on a playoff team, you must be a stud.  So just know that and go have fun!  Basketball is a fun game.  If you need anything else, PM me."
Basketball,2ucsl9,thesealwhisperer,2,Sun Feb 1 03:00:11 2015 UTC,"Confidence is huge. Believe in yourself and don't be afraid to take action. It's better to try and make a play and possibly fail than to not try anything at all. You need to be running a lot if you want to score. Make sure you position yourself so that your teammates can safely pass.   What's your position though? It's very different depending on your position. Judging from your length, you are probably a center? A big part of playing center is putting up screens and blocking out your opponent. Try to position yourself with your back to the basket and your defender behind you and then ask the ball. If they don't or can't pass, go set a screen and try a pick and roll. Even if you don't get the pass, you atleast helped out a teammate. A lot of young centers have problems scoring because they don't move enough. Move in and out of the paint, don't just make your presence felt within the paint.  Clavo_PR is right, basketball starts with defense. Even if you only score one point, that doesn't mean you were useless. Get rebounds, play clean and tight defense, set screens and keep moving. I've played games where I scored over 30 points and I've played games where I only scored 4 points. Still some of my best games were arguebly lower scoring ones because I just dominated the paint with rebounds, blocks and screens."
Basketball,2ucsl9,Instantcoffees,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"I Typically play power forward. On my maxpreps account im listed as a power forward/ small forward But my coach puts me in as everything from point guard to center. If i was more consistent i could be starting shooting guard with a team height average of 5'7. But yeah , im always a defensive first player. And its becoming more apparent to me that defense is really never appreciated in High School Basketball , thats why i want to become a scorer."
Basketball,2ucsl9,Instantcoffees,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:05:16 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, it's hard to compare with my experience. I'm from Europe and when I was about your age, the coaches used to REALLY stress basic executes, teamplay and defense. If you tried to be flashy or force a play when there was a better option, you'd get replaced and could expect a speech from the coach. I'd get way more praise for defending with a lot of zeal than for scoring a circus goal.  It's not that easy to play consistent if your coach places you in different positions all the time. I also played every role, but usually only one or two different ones during a season. It can get confusing because you pick up habbits from playing different roles, habbits that don't really work in different roles.   It's difficult to advise you without seeing you play. I'd say to keep moving and try to free yourself from your defender and be open to a pass. If you aren't getting a lot of passes, try to get offensive rebounds. With your length, you can be scoring a lot simply by getting those and scoring after. Also, remember to triple threat. Even if you aren't confident with dribbling, your defender doesn't know that. Do a fake or a short dribble + backjump before you shoot."

Basketball,2u92nr,210pa,4,Fri Jan 30 23:34:49 2015 UTC,"Looking at the 2014-15 season in a vacuum, the best PG is Steph Curry. He's flirting with the elusive 50% fg, 40% 3P, 90% ft stat line that has only been done 10 times by six different players (Steve Nash did it 4 times, Larry Bird did it twice; Kevin Durant was the last to accomplish it in 2012-13).  Additionally, Curry is averaging 23 points, 8 assists, 5 rebounds, and 3 3PM for arguably the best team in the NBA. His passing is unbelievable - he makes some truly incredible dimes and always finds his teammates in the best positions to score. He also attacks the basket really well which has helped open up things for other players on the Warriors. His ball handling is second to none (maybe Kyrie).  Steph great to watch and is becoming one of the faces of the NBA. He has gotten dramatically better these last few years, and you can really see it all coming together this year, even more so than last. He has stepped up every aspect of his game since he entered the league, and he gets my vote for best PG, at least for this season.  2 - 5: Westbrook, CP3, John Wall, Kyrie"
Basketball,2u92nr,eemmzz10,3,Sat Jan 31 02:57:57 2015 UTC,I agree with everything but as much as I love steph u gotta give the #1 ballhandling to kyrie. It's just fucking amazing what he does with the ball and I think he's - dare I say it - the greatest ballhandler in the NBA of all time.
Basketball,2u92nr,Insidious_Toothbrush,1 point,Sat Jan 31 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with both of you. This is why I like Kyrie because his ball handling is awesome. Curry is the ultimate PG -this season he's unstoppable-. And, of course, Wall, Lowry, Westbrook, Paul, Parker (when he was at his best) are also really important players for their teams. But, I feel like Kyrie has that insane ball handling that makes him different from the rest. Maybe not the best, just my favourite."
Basketball,2u92nr,jumpman0035,3,Sat Jan 31 15:11:35 2015 UTC,"i think it depends on what you're looking for in a PG. a shooting PG- Steph Curry a defender PG- maybe Chris Paul Ball handler PG- Kyrie Irving All around defense and offense beast mode can take over a game and is my personal favorite?  Russel Westbrook  Russel Westbrook can score with the best of them, defend the best of them, and is just a nightmare to guard or be guarded by. he gambles too much and can be streaky though, so that's what move him out of being #1, i think. you can argue for anyone of the guys i mentioned really."

Don't get me wrong he is a great player but there are so many other point guards who play better than him but don't get enough credit because kyrie is a more exciting player to watch which leads to him being more popular etc. Although he does help his team there are others who have a bigger impact on the court than he does. Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas (more or less last season), Goran Dragic, Kyle Lowry, and Jeff Teague come to mind when talking about pgs who have a bigger impact than kyrie."
Basketball,2u92nr,Insidious_Toothbrush,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:57:28 2015 UTC,Only lowry makes a bigger a bigger impact than kyrie of those you mentioned.
Basketball,2u92nr,Yup767,1 point,Sat Jan 31 13:41:25 2015 UTC,"The answer is Stephen Curry. There is no argument, not because he's so amazing compared to the others but because he beats them in nearly all statistical catergories. Near 40/50/90, 23pts, 8ast, 5reb, 2stl. The next closest would be CP3 who can distribute better, but without the same scoring or efficiency. Third on my list is Russell Westbrook who can rebound and score better, but he is inefficient and lags in ast's.

Basketball,2u619n,brachiosaurus,7,Fri Jan 30 10:20:40 2015 UTC,"Physically:  Drink lots of fluids. Days leading up to the game, lots on gameday. Gatorade will tell you that you need their electrolytes but you dont. Water is fine. 3-4 hours before the game you should eat a good meal. Carbs and protein. Pasta and chicken, some broccoli on the side. If you have access to a gym, go in about 8-10 hours before game time and shoot around. Work up a sweat doing what you normally do in a game. Dont worry about getting tired. The water and food make up for this. Maybe even take a nap after this if youre tired. Before the game, jump rope. Do a dynamic stretch. That means nothing static, no just yoinking muscles. Things like russian kicks and heel grabs. Stretches that keep your body moving. When youre warming up, work up a sweat. Go hard. You wont wear yourself down, youll just get your body ready.   Mentally:  Think about who youre playing. I dont know if you have access to game tape but if you do, study your opponent. Most importantly, envision what youre going to do on the court. Picture the baskets youll get. Envision how youre going to do things. Listen to some music that pumps you up. Feel the energy within you building up and wait to release it during the game. Do whatever makes you feel confident and comfortable.

Shoot again, if it misses.... Larry gets 2 points, if you hit it, you get 1. Play to 21.  Pick up basketball. You can only get better playing against better opponents.

Basketball,2taqml,TTBOYTT,3,Thu Jan 22 16:00:26 2015 UTC,"Just think of you have a ring, and you tilt it towards you, the shape you see slowly goes from a full circle, to a sort of oval/convex shape. The hole itself is gonna look small as an oval than straight on as a full circle.   Now if you take that into perspective, if the ball drops directly from above, it has the full circle to pass through. The smaller the arc, the less of a full circle the rim becomes, and the more oval shape it will look. Therefore the ball has less room to go through."
Basketball,2taqml,lfc98bk,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"This is a very conventional piece of basetball wisdom that I think is somewhat disputable. While it's true that extra arc increases the area of the hoop that the ball can drop through, it's also increases the distance that the ball needs to travel to the hoop. Increased distance means more opportunity for error.  To make this more clear, imagine shooting a shot with ridiculous arc, like 30 feet in the air. This would allow the ball to drop in to any part of the rim, but will almost certainly have negative ramifications for your accuracy.  Keep in mind, also, that many great nba shooters actually have flatter shots (michael jordan, kobe bryant, ray allen)."

Basketball,2taqml,ec20,3,Thu Jan 22 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"It is all about the angle the ball goes through the hoop. If the arch is high, then the ball will drop through at a near 90 degree angle, meaning the ball will not hit the hoop.  If the ball is at a 30 degree angle, for example due to a lower arch, then the ball will not be able to go through without hitting the rim. I hope this clears it up."

Basketball,2taqml,sudo_wtf,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:53:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I've seen a calculation (multiple times, from multiple sources) showing that ~48 degrees is the optimum angle, maximizing distance and accuracy at the least detriment to either."
Basketball,2taqml,5AMinHanoi,2,Sun Feb 1 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"I was always told that two full - size basketballs can fit through a hoop.   Another reason is rebounding.  High arching shots,  if they are off, creat big bounces that allow for offensive rebounds, a tipped rebound to a guard, long rebounds to the guards themselves, easy put backs. The flat shots karoom quickly at weird angles.  Kobe, Jordan,  Allen are professionals with a million shot attempts, video and film scientific review and god-like powers"
Basketball,2taqml,ec20,1 point,Fri Jan 23 11:01:17 2015 UTC,The rebounding reason seems unclear to me also. Because defensive players are usually the ones in good rebounding position (they stand in the positions where rebounds are most likely to go) randomness and chaos actually should increase the likelihood of an offensive rebound. So the weirdness of flat shots seem like they should help offenses.
