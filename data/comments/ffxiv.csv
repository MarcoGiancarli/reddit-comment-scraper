ffxiv,3e1zwy,Novarix,3,Tue Jul 21 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"Honest question: Summoner's my worst class so I haven't touched it since HW hit. Can summoners actually put Balance to good use? Since the damage is split and it doesn't affect the pet, I've been hesitant to give them balance. Even if you have cooldowns for high burst, that relies on having them all line up correctly with me drawing a balance, which seems like the stars aligning there."
ffxiv,3e1zwy,speckledspectacles,3,Tue Jul 21 16:32:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you have balance saved for something that needs to be bursted and the smn is prepared for the fight (like chitin in bis ex) then yes they will utilize it :D Balance + RS + dreadwyrm trance and full aetherflow would be drool worthy damage!

ffxiv,3e1zwy,Equilibriator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"AST is Astrologian.  They have a class mechanic where they draw cards. They can use the cards on people to give them a buff.   They put the damage-buffing card on the DRG and the MP-restoration card on themselves.  Unfortunately, the in-game graphic doesn't have you actually running up to the target of the buff and slapping the card onto their forehead.  Yoshi pls ;_;"

ffxiv,3e243c,ActuallyFolant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:43:19 2015 UTC,I don't know what kind of super speed you're using but it takes longer than a full sprint duration (18s) to leave Idyllshire if you activate it at the aetheryte.

But it doesn't take long at all when you warp in to run to the exit.   The NPC warping you to just outside the exit is pretty wasteful. If it were somewhere further inside the Hinterlands, that'd be good. But outside the gate? That's.... Good? Helps? Saves time?   OK chap. Lol  /shrug  Do your thing man."

ffxiv,3e243c,ricchann,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"Not too sure how I feel about this. They probably could have left it the way it was. It added a little bit of flavor to the game. Just think of the Hinterlands like the little area North of Aleport...no Aetheryte there. Where's my NPC to take me there when I need to mine some Siltstone.... I think this was just to please the massive amount of people doing the hunts, but you're still going to have to zone in then out again. Haha imagine all the people trying to use this guy during a hunt, did they make it where this NPC is standing on a box or something, so you would be able to see him."
ffxiv,3e243c,ndTech,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:34 2015 UTC,This must just be a temp measure because Yoshi-P said we were going to be able to ride mounts in Idyllshire. Must not be coming until 3.1.
ffxiv,3e243c,leemachine85,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:35:10 2015 UTC,"He said that was something they were looking at. He did NOT say we were 100% going to be able to mount up while in Idyllshire. Its an extremely small zone, mounts would be horrible here.  I had hoped we would be seeing more of a mini aetheryte deal here and not an npc. The major city bit where we could click the aetheryte and choose to go out whichever gate. Hinterlands actually has a broken down aethernet, a quest to repair it over time would have been awesome."

ffxiv,3e243c,Albireookami,2,Tue Jul 21 13:46:45 2015 UTC,They explained it in the live letter. Just because you don't personally know the reason doesn't mean it's needless.
ffxiv,3e243c,MannToots,11,Tue Jul 21 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"Still annoying nonetheless, they did it as a precaution, I am hoping eventually they realize that they may not need them split and reform them"
ffxiv,3e243c,Albireookami,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:07 2015 UTC,They won't. Their reasoning was was quite solid and won't be suddenly invalidated. What's done is done. The amount of work to reform it wouldn't be worth the benefits from keeping it separate.
ffxiv,3e243c,MannToots,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"For the uninitiated, what was the reasoning exactly? I haven't been able to keep up with everything. :x"
ffxiv,3e243c,Shakko13,-8,Tue Jul 21 17:48:38 2015 UTC,Basically with the zone being so large the number of people sitting in Idyllshire would possibly be an issue for the whole zone (especially with the high congestion of the last month).

Holing X or F12 on a keyboard to target is base game methods (as well as clicking), not a bypass.  It really just becomes a visual thing at that point or wanting to be the one 'closest' to the NPC which means nothing."
ffxiv,3e2m7y,Samoto_Zama,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:18 2015 UTC,Everyone can cram around one side of a stairway when there's a guy standing there playing with his phone instead of walking too.  Doesn't make what the guy blocking the way is doing any less rude.
ffxiv,3e2m7y,ffxivthrowaway03,0,Tue Jul 21 17:03:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Except in this game you can walk through people, if you choose not to then who's fault is it then?  Matter of perspective I suppose."
ffxiv,3e2m7y,Samoto_Zama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:47 2015 UTC,"Not quite the same thing though.  Walking around someone on a stairway is common sense.  Not everyone playing FFXIV remembers or even knows that there's a hotkey that lets you click through the dbag on the behemoth mount standing on the bell.  Hell, I was looking for it just last night and couldn't remember what it was.  I had to take the time to go into the keybinds menu to look it up.  It's stuff like this that makes me wish they put summoning bells behind a counter like other NPCs in out of bounds areas.  It's just too important of a resource and people love to troll it."
ffxiv,3e2m7y,DisplacedLondoner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:38 2015 UTC,"Using a real life person walk around isn't the same thing as targeting in a game either :p  Again if you could always walk through people in real life, then you may not consider someone idle being rude because you would just walk through them.  In FFXIV you could always target through people so maybe refusing to do so is being rude?  Please don't take offense, but you not remembering keybindings isn't anything to do with anyone else...  Wish that would help.  The problem with the NPC in the picture isn't that people were being jerks.  They had an armor window open and reviewing stats and doing item comparisons.  Point being you will run into it no matter what..."

ffxiv,3e2cze,MaturestAdult,3,Tue Jul 21 14:29:16 2015 UTC,It's actually because people are spamming N. Than to level up instead of going to the new areas or doing dungeons. The amount of people hanging out there is unreal.
ffxiv,3e2cze,Comrade_Nugget,3,Tue Jul 21 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, I was leveling my WAR last night and there were easily 3 full groups of people. Half of them were level 50+. I personally would never want to level sync farm fates to level."

But, most of the people hanging out there that I knew of were people on an Alt class leveling up.  That's why again a lot of people just did their Main Scenario and once a good number of those people did them so we don't have people whining about missing out on story quests to do new content, cuz they just did FATE grinds.  So once that threshold of players were there, I'd figure they'd buff the FATES"
ffxiv,3e2cze,SummerSatellite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:53 2015 UTC,"It still wasn't at all uncommon to see people level 55, maybe even 56 there from time to time.

ffxiv,3e2cze,thebluick,4,Tue Jul 21 15:14:33 2015 UTC,a lot easier to grind N Than mindlessly while watching tv than dungeon grinding.
ffxiv,3e2cze,sometimesaqt,2,Tue Jul 21 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"Their first 55 or 56 maybe, because people got tired of the Moogle sidequests (or forgot about the Mor Dhona ones), but generally people who were on leveling an alt were there. I don't know why people are reading this as people never went there. I'm saying SE did something a little more smart than ""oh gee a lot of people are in N than"".   However, for your first 60, if people just sat there the whole time they were behind on story, due to Aether currents and such, and the side quests got you to 60.  In essence SE purposely gated the content.  N than being busy made it easier for people who haven't finished ARR to level up. It was a dead zone on many servers before HW. It was also busy during the beginning 2.0. So it's not surprising."

It's about memorizing your rotation, executing it perfectly in sync with the fight, while avoiding mechanics that are better avoided than soaked.  When I raided, the number of times we wiped due to someone getting multiple debuffs, timing something wrong, or whatever, and someone else commenting 'well that was bad RNG' ... no, there is very little RNG in boss fights. Who gets targeted is random and yes RNG may mean the same target gets it twice in a row, but that attack is coming and if you're ready for it, you can handle the part that is truly RNG."

ffxiv,3e2bbz,kyrios91,19,Tue Jul 21 15:52:04 2015 UTC,"My knowledge of A1S based on other posts...   Faust is a very, very legit DPS check.  I've heard groups clearing at 6500 DPS and groups failing to clear at 8000 based on how much of that is AoE.  Point is, to clear it in the gear you could have today, you've got to be absolutely on top of your game. Opressor's Prey bombardments will kill people who aren't healed/shielded during. The ground targetted circles now leave poop behind and have to be managed for positioning to not overlap with missiles Opressors now have an actual tank buster in their rotation right around when the missiles are hitting Four lasers, just as everyone suspected Damage in general is higher.  raidwide AoE can be cast back to back. enjoy your DPS check too"
ffxiv,3e2bbz,GarlyleWilds,12,Tue Jul 21 16:52:32 2015 UTC,"also when he jumps, he'll cast a bunch more of the poop circles before he comes down. and the jump will destroy you if you're not as far away as possible.  Also the poop is heavy+dot ala T13. But the real problem is that the heavy affects both the oppressors and the spiders, so you cant drag them through the puddles. So you have to be veeery careful about your placement (tanks included)."

ffxiv,3e2bbz,deepdrill,0,Tue Jul 21 18:38:09 2015 UTC,Because any other group would be showing it off already in social media if they had cleared earlier.
ffxiv,3e2bbz,PinkMage,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:44 2015 UTC,"So in essence theres no way to validate that any one group cleared first. Because in reality there could be a private group of friends who possibly cleared first and dont want to ""showboat"""

The possibility is always there but let's be reasonable. The reason people aim for world records, world firsts etc is because of the prestige, fame and the satisfaction of knowing that you done something faster or better than anyone else in the world. That's the nature of competition.  Also, something like this will only matter if you can prove it. Usain Bolt will be concidered the fastest man in the world at 100-meter dash until someone proves that they can beat his record. For the same reason Lucrezia will be concidered world first on A1 until someone can proves that they cleared it before them."
ffxiv,3e2bbz,Lillskit85,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:29:41 2015 UTC,Im not contesting whether or not they actually cleared it first on there world. Im just curious if theres a way for thr public to validate/verify the claims.

ffxiv,3e2bbz,egolds01,4,Tue Jul 21 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"Something interesting to note:  World First clear. Had a WAR/DRK tank lineup. Looks like WAR MT and DRK OT going by the DPS numbers (parse is the next thing down on Twitter).  Maybe people can stop complaining about DRK not being viable or offering something useful for raiding? Lucrezia obviously thought it worth bringing over a PLD.  (Full party was WAR/DRK/DRG/NIN/BRD/BLM/WHM/SCH, for the record).  Herp derp, parse was for something else, ignore the above.  MVP used a WAR/DRK for their clear an hour after Lucrezia's, though, so point is still sort of valid."

ffxiv,3e2bbz,Zakrael,-18,Tue Jul 21 14:10:18 2015 UTC,They wanted the damage. DRK is a more damaging OT/MT than PLD.
ffxiv,3e2bbz,Swordwraith,10,Tue Jul 21 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"Right, more damage at the cost of not having the PLDs extra mitigation, which they obviously felt they didn't need. It's a tradeoff.  It's just there have been a lot of people on this sub talking about how DRK is undertuned, how PLD/WAR is always going to be better than anything/DRK, and how the things that DRK bring to a raid don't outweight losing the benefits of one of the other tanks. Well, looks like Lucrezia MVP disagree.  (Edited because I can't read parses)"
ffxiv,3e2bbz,Zakrael,-13,Tue Jul 21 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think they disagree entirely. My static is doing pld/DRK but that doesn't mean there's nothing wrong with drk. Honestly though, drk mitigation and damage seems fine, it's the utility, especially in the PLD/drk environment, that leaves everyone wanting. Drk is completely viable, just a little gimped in utility."
ffxiv,3e2bbz,SarcasticEnglishman,12,Tue Jul 21 14:10:34 2015 UTC,Delirium is a pretty big deal for groups not running a MNK.
ffxiv,3e2bbz,m1s3ri,-10,Tue Jul 21 15:32:52 2015 UTC,"Delirium is fine. It's situationally helpful. Reprisal just needs work. Rng based storms path only usable while mt just doesn't match the utility of war or Pld. Also, Pld STR down 10% only comes from pld, war 10% damage down only comes from war/drk, but is 100% uptime on war, storms path is 1000% better, drk brings 10% int down, which monk usually keeps up 100% if you have anyway. Useful, sure, but not useful in every raid comp. Let's say 50% of raids use a monk. Delirium effect is useless in 50% of raid comps. Storms path/Halone is useful in 100% of raid comps. Reprisal should be noted here too, but given its large restrictions, it's just simply not as good.   War/Drk probably suffers less than pld/drk as far as utility, but pld/war just brings so much more. Just a small change to how drk can use damage down 10%, a couple tp adjustments, and maybe using blood weapon sans the 10% attack speed buff in grit, and drk is equal. Some may want bigger buffs, but I don't think it's necessary. Drk DPS and mitigation is fine, just a small utility change and it's good to go."
ffxiv,3e2bbz,SarcasticEnglishman,8,Tue Jul 21 17:10:53 2015 UTC,"The parse you are referring to is from Ravana Ex. It even says ""Thok ast Thok"" in the top left corner."

Syrcus Tower was added in 2.3 (July 7th) but the upgrade items were not added to Syrcus Tower until 2.38 (September 16th).

I'm getting 265 MP per tic at 60.   cool. 30 TP/tic is better than its previous 20% (30%) reduction, unless you're absolutely spamming the ever-living crap out of abilities, but then again, you're restricted by GCD. i only know the cost of PLD/DRK skills and 20% usually wasn't more than 20 TP (unless you used the 1xx TP skills, etc.). 60-80 seemed to be the ""usual"" cost for weapon skills; 60 went down to 48, 70 to 56 and 80 to 64. 30 TP/tic in this case is much better.  Ewer being 265/tic is harder to swallow. it's still good, but, being able to get Ewer's 20% (30%) reduction on Ascend, Aspected Helios, Gravity, etc. would be better than the current refresh. that said, the new Ewer + Lightspeed buff definitely helps AST with its mana issues. the old Ewer was better in spam-happy moments, but the new Ewer is probably better overall since you won't always be spamming those super-high cost spells. how much mana regen is it for the Enhanced Ewer? wouldn't it be around 400/tic, then?  so really, i'd say Spire was flat-out buffed where as Ewer was more a side-grade."

I would assume once I get i190 weapon I could probably be up to 1300-1350?  Is there any movement required of DPS on Faust in Savage mode? Or is it the same type of fight?
ffxiv,3e242j,Tumdace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:44 2015 UTC,Exactly the same. To be honest the main boss itself isn't too different on mechanics just the damage going out is massively higher.  Getting it to 50% pretty easily but the bit where they jump takes some good group coordination now.

ffxiv,3e242j,allworknoplaytoday,18,Tue Jul 21 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"What I know so far for Oppressor after Faust:  Resin bomb: Targets four random people and drops piles of green shit on floor that applies a slow and DoT damage. Suggest spreading out.  Hydrothermal Missle (Prey): Hits person with single target damage multiple times. Hits for about 2k each...maybe like six times? After Oppressor 0.5 comes down, two comes out at once. Suggest adloing or stoneskinning as hits pretty hard. Physical damage.  Hyperthermic Plasma: Tank buster from both Oppressors. Needs to be mitigated with Stoneskin or Adlo.  Emergency Deployment: Spawns adds.   Photon Spaser: Cylinder-shaped damage in one direction.  3000-tonze Missile: Summons four bombs. Like normal mode, you need adds to be killed beneath each one. One DPS on each add.  Gunnery Pod: Raid-wide AoE damage. Sometimes comes out twice in a row.   Auto-attack is ranged from each boss.  Phase 1: 100% - 65%  Phase 2: 65% - ?  Double prey comes out as well Oppressor 0.5. Tons of damage. Four bombs with four adds to be killed underneath. Suggest spreading out for Resin Bomb so that it doesn't drop where the adds need to be killed. Tank buster happens right before bombs hit the ground.  51%ish.  Oppressors fly up. Spread out as Resin bombs will drop and then stack again away from the bombs."
ffxiv,3e242j,Zyphemis,5,Tue Jul 21 12:10:40 2015 UTC,"Question, Can resin bomb be placed and then dodged out of before the AOE takes effect? If so I would recommend stacking resin bomb on one spot."

I remember a small tank spike during that time in normal, but never looked to see if there was a cast or anything.  If it goes out during Prey damage, probably going to have to adjust the basics of what I was doing in normal for that."
ffxiv,3e242j,Erakir,4,Tue Jul 21 14:06:41 2015 UTC,Correct. Double tank buster (Hyperthermic Plasma) + double prey at the same time. My group is having a bit of trouble healing through that right now.
ffxiv,3e242j,Zyphemis,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I've been prepping DS Regen on the prey targets then following up with a heal on one tank and a Tetra on the other, but sounds like will need the time to stoneskin, as well.  Would place asylum down on one tank when it was up on normal, but...  With 2k-ish ticks from prey plus AoE damage from the gunnery pods coming up in savage, I'm wondering if it'd be smart to try and group preys up and stack them in an Asylum for the first set alongside DS Regen, then have Assize available for the second set and alternate them.  I'm guessing Sacred Soil / Deployment tactics could be used there as well, but yeah, no idea what you guys are seeing in there right now and where else those might be needed.

ffxiv,3e242j,Zyphemis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:23 2015 UTC,"I would imagine it's somewhat pointless as well because of the stacks you get for tanking an add too long, no?  I feel like at best maybe you could two man it, possibly assign a ranged dps to pick two up, smack one around a bit and position it while melee kills their two, hit the second while melee finishes off the first, position the second and go back to hitting boss while melee kills last add? Blind theorycraft here mind you."

ffxiv,3e242j,Rosko_Bhoooltey,5,Tue Jul 21 11:19:40 2015 UTC,And didn't Yoshi P say this was made with healer dps NOT being part of the equation?
ffxiv,3e242j,wintermare,-73,Tue Jul 21 11:30:13 2015 UTC,Its geared for higher ilvls then what you have the day its released.  Yoshi said healer DPS is key if you wish to do it below the minimum ilvl requirements. (What ilvl it would be in df. Which you are probably supposed to be like full i190)
ffxiv,3e242j,darklynx4,52,Tue Jul 21 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"Healer DPS is not apart of the equation. They assume people won't clear it immediately. They tend to gear the fight for higher iLevels (like i200 if the max was i190 before release) and base the DPS/HP requirements of the fight off of that.  I believe Yoshi said that while the Dev team never designs the fight to depend on DPS, it's just an added bonus. I noticed they took away all the ACC from WHM gear that i120/i130 stuff had."
ffxiv,3e242j,Sutaru,17,Tue Jul 21 17:55:49 2015 UTC,"No, he said the exact opposite, that savage was made with healer dps in mind, normal mode wasnt  But the scrubs who dont want to DPS are the ones who kept saying that to save face  Well there you go, good luck with savage and not dpsing as a healer"
ffxiv,3e242j,NamaeFF,11,Tue Jul 21 11:33:11 2015 UTC,"Healer DPS was not used to tune Savage. Yoshi has never said otherwise.  Obviously, Savage is tuned for higher item levels than most groups have right now, so if you want to clear the fight at current gear levels, your healers had damn well better be DPSing.  http://www.bluegartr.com/threads/125732-Game-Watch-Translation-Yoshida-Interview-on-Heavensward-(EU-Media-Event-5-19)   Yoshida: Since all DPS jobs will be increasing up through level 60, it makes sense to have the white mage's DPS extend by a proportional amount as well. For development, such as with Bahamut's Coils, the development team assumes what the item level should be for general equipment on players when they clear a raid. They sum up the basic DPS for four DPS and tanks at that assumed item level and cut that by about 10-15% for the minimum clear DPS. Healer DPS is not taken into account when this is set.  Certainly for people who are at world's first level, their goal is to clear it at as low an item level as possible, lower than the one assumed during development. So if you look at the fight and figure out that if it's not numerically possible to clear with four DPS and tanks, you'll need to make up the gap with DPS from healers. Then when those publish clear videos and other people see the healers DPSing, they might think that healers need to be DPSing even though its a situation that only arose because their clear would have otherwise been impossible. While we could take this into account, and assume a different item level in the next update which would then make it impossible to clear even with the healer DPS, we'd eliminate this type of play for highly skilled players who use communication, items, and a high level of understanding to come up with those last second clears. That would be a tough decision to make, so I still think it should be up to each party's own plans.  This is also one of the reasons we decided to implement both a normal and savage version of Alexander. Once again, healer DPS was not included in the development team's calculation as it was for other jobs, so you should just think of healer DPS as a last way to get your overall party's DPS up to where it needs to be."

ffxiv,3e242j,disasta121,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"Well they may or may not, due to dyeable items it may still be nerfed when next raid comes out.  You can't use savage 2nd coil as an example as this is not the same savage.  They made story for clear and ""savage"" to be the same experience as normal Raiders want from coil.   Savage 2nd was just a thing for super high progression fc to tackle while bored farming 2nd and 3rd coil"
ffxiv,3e242j,Albireookami,8,Tue Jul 21 13:50:15 2015 UTC,"True, but I think that the only reason the added echo to coil was because people wanted to experience the story.

On my PUG (where our best result was 22%), I tried:   Getting adds to cleave Faust Getting Faust to cleave adds Keeping adds away from Faust Stunning adds Stunning Faust as he casted Increasing Pressure Moving adds around to see if there was any object they were supposed to cleave Killing adds   Nothing seemed to have any effect, neither on Faust or the adds. Killing adds also did not slow down or reduce Faust's stacks, and time spent trying to kill them is time spent not damaging Faust.  The add's spawn pace is also relentless, so it'll also be very hard to get an offtank to contribute anything beyond DoTs for damage.  EDIT: it might be possible to buy a few seconds by using your favorite Hallowed Ground equivalent during the Increasing Pressure cast, as well as having the OT taking over with their invincible skill as MT dies. Note that adds keep on relentlessly spawning during this, so not sure if it helps; it's also possible that his attacks after getting the buff go through invincibility."

ffxiv,3e2ddm,Crystagenesis,5,Tue Jul 21 12:43:17 2015 UTC,Spire is 30 TP/tick. Ewer is Ballad and Spire is Paeon.
ffxiv,3e2ddm,Yashimata,3,Tue Jul 21 12:45:48 2015 UTC,Is that 30 TP/Tick with just one target? If so that'd be 15 per tick on AoE which is like ... 75 TP ... woohoo you get 1 free skill.  Do you know what the potency on Goad is?
ffxiv,3e2ddm,Kaella,2,Tue Jul 21 12:57:16 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember about TP regen is that TP costs, unlike most MP costs, are largely low enough that there's only a slight net loss of TP per GCD, relative to natural regeneration.  You regenerate 60 TP every 3 seconds, which averages out to roughly 50 TP per GCD (depending on skill speed, so less for MNK and NIN, which is why most of their weaponskills are 50 and 60 TP). Most non-AoE, non-Ranged-skill-on-a-melee-class TP-consuming weaponskills cost between 60 and 80 TP.  In other words, if the average 3-hit melee combo costs 70 TP, 60 TP, then 60 TP, the actual net cost is 20 TP, 10 TP, 10 TP. Giving your party an extra 75 TP is almost two full combos - nearly 15 seconds - worth of TP. That can often be all that it takes to keep someone from running dry until the next Invigorate or the next jump/phase change.  You're probably better off using it with Extended or Enhanced Royal Road than you are with Expanded Royal Road, or even without RR at all, though, because some classes run out of TP much faster than others. You kind of have to know your party (and/or use a TP monitor add-on) before you can make that kind of judgement call, though."
ffxiv,3e2ddm,Pernici,5,Tue Jul 21 17:25:02 2015 UTC,400 TP over 30 seconds  Yeah Spire is still bad. Maybe worse than before?
ffxiv,3e2ddm,Yashimata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's worse than before. Assuming a standard 70-60-60 rotation (63.33 TP per skill), old spire saved 12.66 TP per skill use, or 101.33 TP over 20 seconds. More if it was used as AoE was happening, less if the person had to stop attacking for any reason (like to dodge an incredibly common AoE). Now it just restores a flat 150, or 50% more.  It's also useful at any time now. Before it was pretty much useless if they were already out of TP."
ffxiv,3e2ddm,Albireookami,5,Tue Jul 21 13:57:59 2015 UTC,You can use it during downtime and with other tp regens.  Every little bit helps
ffxiv,3e2ddm,Dynme,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"It's actually better than before. Old Spire on a NIN would restore maybe 120 TP. New one should be 150 TP and doesn't require that I be mashing all my skills (that is, it can be used during downtime)."
ffxiv,3e2ddm,tylian,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"f each point of potency of refresh equalling roughly 8.82 (or 9 in the real world with slight varience) MP per potency per tick.   Really close! The actual value is 8.84 per potency per tick, rounded down.  And yeah, neither gear, stats nor class affects refresh potency. Only level does, and at 60 the mana scaling constant is 8,840% which is where the 8.84 constant comes from."
ffxiv,3e2ddm,tylian,6,Tue Jul 21 12:58:41 2015 UTC,I wasn't aware of that o.o  I'm assuming that that constant is related to the scaling MP costs of spells too? Seems like such a random number for them to pick o.o

I'd like to test how rough Noct sect is on the ole mp now with several ewer cards throughout the fight.

Edit:  This is not a comprehensive list of where every single fish is.  Just a quick reference for fish that I've personally found a use for.  I started it a couple weeks ago after leveling my Fisher to 60 and being disgusted about all the misinformation floating around out there.

ffxiv,3e0ys1,mastertank56,6,Tue Jul 21 02:59:10 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on the Seaborne Aethersand?  So far the only real information I know is that aethersand usually stems from aetherial reduction.  Angler site shows under their desynth category everything from Seaborne to Landborne as desynth rewards, which makes sense given as there's not aetherial reduction category to post it into.  That being said the fish listed giving these aethersand have no collectibility or the ones that do don't appear in the aetherial reduction menu.  This is leaving me pretty confused on the subject right now so if you have any clarification it would be super nice."
ffxiv,3e0ys1,mastertank56,3,Tue Jul 21 17:46:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're asking.  Are you asking where to get Seaborne Aethersand or are you asking if you can get them via desynth and not Aetherial Reduction?  I get a lot of  Seaborne Aethersands from aetherial reducing Tupaxuara.    I've desynthed maybe 100+ Cherry Trout and have yet to get a single aethersand.  So I can't confirm cat became hungry's claim that you can retrieve them via desynth, however I may have just had terrible RNG or the drop rates may be so low as to be virtually useless.  I hope that answer helps in some way."

Using some regular expressions I replaced instances like Item Name x2 with two instances of Item Name. I then pasted the output into http://tagcrowd.com/, a free web application for creating word clouds. To make the application work correctly, I had to remove the spaces from the material names to treat them as one word.  Hopefully, with this information, you can get an idea for which materials you need to gather either for your own crafts or to sell on the market board for other crafters in 3.05. I hope this helps! :)  Edit: I just looked back through and noticed an odd occurrence of the word ""grade"". Apparently tagcrowd treated the ""2"" in ""Grade 2 X Dissolvent"" as a delimiter, so you will see a count for ""grade"" and counts for various ""x dissolvent"". I have uploaded a fixed image here.

I have been running all end game content so far with the same stats. I'm using (which I assume you are using as well) all str acc except for one ilvl 190 ring from alex normal. Did you find that the way to go with savage? Was the damage too high with that amount of hp or were you able to mitigate the damage effectively with that amount? I am trying to decide (if I try savage tonight) whether or not I should be going in full on vit or trying to remove some vit for str. Thank you for your time.

ffxiv,3e2k7o,neonchinchilla,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:50:52 2015 UTC,AST in Alex Savage will be fine as long as they are playing their class correctly.
ffxiv,3e2k7o,marrew,6,Tue Jul 21 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"I understand this perspective, I guess what I'm asking is, will a WHM/SCH combination still be stronger/more reliable?"
ffxiv,3e2k7o,Kuthrayze,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to be a long time before AST can stand up to the reliability and safety of WHM/SCH. Their healing output should be ahead of AST, but not this far ahead. The patch addressed MP issues, made Spread usable out of combat, and reduced the CD of Shuffle. But that doesn't address the fact that even with perfect card draws, your buffs are worth less DPS than Selene. They also didn't address the fact that Nocturnal Sect is godawful compared to Diurnal. They have you more MP management tools to get away with using it if you must, but it's still incredibly lackluster. AST just doesn't have the healing output to recover from being behind, or to give the healers room to DPS as much as they could in a WHM/SCH setup.   It's better than before, but it's gonna need more than this to be competitive on the group DPS front. It also makes a much better replacement WHM than SCH. In progression, there simply isn't a replacement for SCH's toolkit. Supervirus, deployment tactics, lustrate, indom, sacred soil, monstrous healer DPS and near infinite MP. AST's utility just can't measure up to that, especially when Nocturnal Sect is so lacking compared to both Diurnal and a SCH's shields."
ffxiv,3e2k7o,marrew,-9,Tue Jul 21 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"Can you show us your research on perfect card draws being worth less than Selene?   Edit: I appreciate the downvotes, but this is a serious question, can you please post the math on this or direct me to were it has been done in a reliable manner?"
ffxiv,3e2k7o,Phantasmid,12,Tue Jul 21 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"I could be a bit off here, but...  In theory if we attack 3% faster 50% of the time Selene should be around a 1.5% raid DPS increase.  Balance at maximum theoretical possible uptime, as in ALL you draw is balance, (edit: 50% uptime, 15s on a 30s CD, extended may be better uptime, I can't remember if it's 30s or 40s sorry!) on a single member doing ~30% of the group's DPS, which probably shouldn't be happening should then also be around 1.5% raid DPS.  If you get expanded balance every minute instead, you have 5% to the entire group but only an uptime of 25%, which should be around 1.25% raid DPS.  And all that is assuming you only draw the best cards for DPS, leaving no room for bole, ewer, or spire for support, and we're not even TOUCHING the shortcomings of personal DPS from the AST and his co-healer vs. running SCH+WHM...  You can squeeze better effectiveness out of cards by placing them on the right members at the right times, and I haven't really considered extending the buffs for this.  But overall you'd be looking at pretty similar amounts of overall DPS increase, but scholar should usually come out ahead off their personal DPS and fey wind naturally lines up really well with other members' cooldowns."
ffxiv,3e2k7o,ffxivthrowaway03,8,Tue Jul 21 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"As far as I've seen, it hasn't.  There was someone doing napkin math in a post about AST a few days ago and people started taking it as gospel.  And even with the napkin math, it was splitting hairs over small percentages.  The reality is that it's all relative, and pulling that Bole to throw on the tank, and now MP/TP regen all have ""value"" to the raid and it's potential for success, it's just much harder to quantify than DPS theorycrafting.  Selene is great and all, but an enhanced Balance with time dilation on a MNK or BLM during their burst phase is pretty fuckin sweet too, and people tend to forget that overall encounter DPS is simply a single metric of overall raid success.  That stronger burst may very well be more important than 8 minutes of slightly higher overall dps because you need to burn an add or push a phase down to the second.  Play what you want and don't worry about it too much, unless you're pushing day one clears with a legitimate expectation of downing the content that level of min-maxing has yet to be necessary."
ffxiv,3e2k7o,Noumo,3,Tue Jul 21 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"I don't quite get this way of thinking. The AST is never supposed to be a 'replacement' of either WHM or SCH. His idea of healing is simply a different one. An AST should do small but fast healings. Equip him with some Crit and essentially Spellspeed and he can certainly be a lil' badass healer. Also with him being able to restore his MP nearly at will, there is no MP problem anymore.    I realize there are some things people won't miss from the other healers but there is always a way to compensate.  Supervirus: Simply put, you can just use a Summoner for that. Selene: While the fairy can buff the DPS of the whole group pretty reliable the AST is more diligent in doing so. Thus the buff can be set more efficient but not as reliable. Shielding: Keep in mind that ""Aspected Benefic"" is an instant; ""Adloquium"" isn't. Group Healing: While AST's healing of the whole group is undeniably weaker as the WHM's, it comes faster making it more useful in unexpected dire situations.  Well but as said at the beginning I dislike the whole idea of comparing the healers with each other. An AST will never fully replace one of the other healers and should not be seen as such. He brings a new aspect of healing to the game which will surely comes in handy in the upcoming trials."
ffxiv,3e2k7o,OwlG5,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:30:23 2015 UTC,"There are only 2 slots for healers in any current raid content - regardless of HOW a healer plays, you're making a choice of which to bring."

This is why I like AST so much. WHM could be compared to a video game warhammer, hard hitting, but slow. AST feels like a one-handed sword, nimble but weaker per hit in many games. I love being able to respond so quickly to situations, and have these tools to help me out. WHM gets the job done, but it feels... Clunky at times, to me."

ffxiv,3e1q22,Yashimata,3,Tue Jul 21 08:53:22 2015 UTC,"Well, that's 10 ilvls higher than I was expecting."
ffxiv,3e1q22,elgoonties,7,Tue Jul 21 09:12:00 2015 UTC,Argh. Gonna be a 30 ilvl difference on law and savage weps already.  :(
ffxiv,3e1q22,cupressi,2,Tue Jul 21 07:47:07 2015 UTC,"It's 20 ilvl bump.  If you're even contemplating Alex Hard and don't have Ravana weapon, lol."
ffxiv,3e1q22,ultimatemisogynerd,3,Tue Jul 21 07:51:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, question, since I started the expansion late (16 days ago), I only just now managed to clear Bismarck, am i179. Will people still farm Ravana now that esoterics and savage is out? I still want my weapon! Would suck to wait until I can get enough esoterics for a weapon just to enter savage, would rather do it earlier, and I need Ravana's weapon to do that well."
ffxiv,3e1q22,cupressi,-4,Tue Jul 21 08:45:26 2015 UTC,"Esoterics is time gated.  Ravana is not, so it's still relevant as the best non-gated weapon you can get at this time."
ffxiv,3e1q22,elgoonties,2,Tue Jul 21 08:47:02 2015 UTC,Savage weps are ilvl 210 i thought?  And what is your point here? I'm not intending on doing savage :/
ffxiv,3e1q22,RegalWords,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:15:10 2015 UTC,"But you still have access to Ravana, which is only 20 ilevels behind and/or the esoteric weapon which is i200. So if you never participate in savage the gap between what you can get and what you won't get is only 10 ilvls."
ffxiv,3e1q22,deefame,4,Tue Jul 21 12:25:46 2015 UTC,"I kinda don't like them invalidating alexander normal gear, AF2 effectively will replace all parts obtained from Alex because of the ilvl difference only. Would have liked a side grade gear set."
ffxiv,3e1q22,sheepcat87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:50:29 2015 UTC,"I felt that way at first, but if there's a normal cap of 450 per week, with a piece taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks to get, we'll be wearing i190 for a LONG while. It's not like you can just grind out full esoteric gear in the first week of the patch."
ffxiv,3e1q22,Parsley_Sage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:57:15 2015 UTC,It's 450

ffxiv,3e1q22,ffxivthrowaway03,5,Tue Jul 21 08:49:35 2015 UTC,"If it's anything like previous item costs, it optimally takes 5 weeks to get a full set of Alex Normal gear (of which we're already starting Week 3 today) whereas a full set of Esoterics for a single job is going to take roughly 15 weeks because of the tome cap."

Where's my Crit? I guess the rest of the gear all have Crit options so these pieces can balance it out.
ffxiv,3e1q22,DankHealz,3,Tue Jul 21 09:22:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think Piety + Det is the better choice of weapon at the moment.  Crit is nice, but Det > crit (unless you will be primarily in Noct sect ... but come on .. who is?)"

ffxiv,3e1q22,tunoddenrub,11,Tue Jul 21 07:46:05 2015 UTC,"It's the games' end game progression formula. I like it, it's clear goals and it feels good to get an upgrade. Plus Savage will have tokens as well to help round it out."
ffxiv,3e1q22,ultimatemisogynerd,4,Tue Jul 21 07:54:43 2015 UTC,"I do not liek the fact that only one person in each group gets the item every week.  Honestly three should drop imo on the floor they drop on, that makes gearing up easier for the group compared to always having to give everything to the dps to meet dps checks.  As a healer it honestly sucks."
ffxiv,3e1q22,tunoddenrub,3,Tue Jul 21 18:32:57 2015 UTC,I just wish there were more alternatives to gearing.  There's nothing epic or adventurous about some girl behind a counter handing you all of your new gear in a genre of game traditionally about killing things and having them drop loot.  Takes some of the magic out of it.
ffxiv,3e1q22,something_stylish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:25 2015 UTC,Alex still drops gear though. What's wrong with MORE options?
ffxiv,3e1q22,tunoddenrub,0,Tue Jul 21 17:38:04 2015 UTC,Pvp?
ffxiv,3e1q22,something_stylish,2,Tue Jul 21 07:49:27 2015 UTC,"I am kind of disappointed that the AF gear is tomestone gear. I feel like it should be readily available to people who've hit 60 in a job, even if it has to be weaker to compensate."
ffxiv,3e1q22,tunoddenrub,-1,Tue Jul 21 08:13:35 2015 UTC,"I also think AF should be something given in job quests, make them seem special to get, like the Final Fantasy legends they are. Make the quest hard if they are powerful (like a mini-relic), but make it a quest regardless.  Putting them in as tome gear removes a bit of flair. I can guarantee one of the things players looked forward the most when they first create their character is getting to level 50 to get that cool Job armor they saw in the character creation screen, and when you got there and did the last few job trials, it felt amazing, like a milestone.  With tomes you'll be grinding pre-existing content for days to get a single piece, by the time you get anything resembling a set it will be weeks. Meh."

That is quite literally one of the major things that drove me through my first character to 50. Wanting to get there, to see her wearing that stylish outfit. I still have the screenshots.  I feel like something so iconic, something that so strongly says 'this is my Job, this is what I am, what I do', should not require week upon week of tome grinding to get. Maybe offer upgraded versions that take a lot of work, but don't gate the basic stuff behind '450 tomes per week'. :/"
ffxiv,3e1q22,tunoddenrub,2,Tue Jul 21 08:47:22 2015 UTC,"But you've already had that experience, you had it at 50. Is there really much need to do that again? For every expansion?

Not just something that gets collected and thrown into the armoire as glamour fodder."

For every new set of AF that comes out?   I'm as much about the 'look and feel' as I am about the stats. AF gear has meaning. It's as much a symbol as it is a gearset. Wearing it is choosing the defining look of your job, and I like that kind of thing.  So, to answer your question: Yes.   I'd rather it be something functional and something that I might possibly use for a while.   I don't know if you remember 2.0, but you didn't use it for terribly long even then. It was your 'intro to endgame' gear. It would be the equivalent of 155-160 gear now."
ffxiv,3e1q22,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:22:05 2015 UTC,The original AF you speak of is from 1.0.  2.0 brought the Myth equivalent (AF+1) and now 3.05 the Esoterics (AF2). All I see is a continuation of the same pattern.
ffxiv,3e1q22,Zoralink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:34:13 2015 UTC,"The original AF you speak of is from 1.0.   You can't really hold anything in 2.0 to 1.0 metrics.  As of 2.0, you got your job AF gear at level 45 and 50 through job quests. The item level on this gear was just enough to help get you into the endgame dungeons of the time, Wanderer's Palace and Amdapor Keep, so you could start getting better gear and Philo+Myth tomes, the latter of which bought you higher-stat, recolored versions of your AF. I'm unhappy that we didn't get the same thing with 3.0, and I don't think it's unreasonable for me to feel this way given past precedent."
ffxiv,3e1q22,Volfen,4,Tue Jul 21 09:38:43 2015 UTC,"AF<Dungeon<Philo/Myth is functionally no different from dungeon<dungeon<Law/Esoterics  In 1.0 the AF took a great deal more work to acquire. Personally, I'd like that back instead of it just being handed out with our job quests. They've thrown the AF+1 into those quests too now.  The only past precedent that exists is they'll make it easier to acquire later while maintaining their uncapped/capped currency dual gearing."
ffxiv,3e1q22,bnerd,0,Tue Jul 21 09:49:45 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like we're going to agree on most of these points, but there's at least one more I'd like to touch on.  If I have to work for my job AF gear, I'd at least like it to be work with some semblance of meaning. Something like the Relic/Zodiac line, where you're doing a questline that's at least marginally more interesting than 'expert roulette every day for almost two months'. Atma grinding made me want to die at times, Animus books were tedious in the extreme, but they at least weren't completely devoid of meaning or interest."
ffxiv,3e1q22,something_stylish,2,Tue Jul 21 09:57:47 2015 UTC,"AF in 1.0 was more like that. It's why I want it back. A meaningful quest and some decent content to go through too.  Since we'll never get that back, having it as endgame currency gear makes it more meaningful all around than it just being attached to a job quest. I can completely understand lore reasons behind wanting this.  Something iconic should not be replaced and made into glamour fodder so quickly. Putting it behind Esoterics ensures that, the same it did with Myth and AF+1."
ffxiv,3e1q22,tunoddenrub,4,Tue Jul 21 10:03:12 2015 UTC,"We already had that though, back at level 45-50.  And the upgraded ""AF+1"" versions were also originally tome gear.  Can't just hand out every cool new set of armor because it's themed to match the jobs."

ffxiv,3e1q22,tunoddenrub,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:49:10 2015 UTC,This is the same deal we had with the Myth gear. Only now they've been made upgradeable like tome gear since.
ffxiv,3e1q22,tunoddenrub,0,Tue Jul 21 08:23:48 2015 UTC,"The original AF gear was rewarded by class quests at 45 and 50. Myth gear was upgraded, recolored versions. Sure, in most cases it looked better, but you weren't required to grind out tomestones over several weeks just to have a basic 'iconic job look'."
ffxiv,3e1q22,Kaellian,4,Tue Jul 21 08:28:06 2015 UTC,"You already got the ""iconic job look"" for free at level 50.  The one that come after can be earned."

ffxiv,3e1q22,ieap,-3,Tue Jul 21 09:54:33 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but two of them don't really have an ""iconic look"" in the first place.   That ""gating"" we're talking about is a few weeks long at best, and nothing too dramatics when you already have other nice looking set to equip in the meantime. There is no reason to hand them for free if it's to make them obsolete right away like the ilv50-55 set. If you want people to wear iconic gears for a while, it needs decent stats."

There is no reason to hand them for free if it's to make them obsolete right away like the ilv50-55 set. If you want people to wear iconic gears for a while, it needs decent stats.   The i50-55 set wasn't ""obsolete right away"" - in gear terms, it served the purpose that 155-160 gear right now would: to get you into the endgame dungeons of the time, so that you could start picking up better gear and also tomestones. You didn't have it for terribly long, sure, but it still served a purpose as gear aside from being the signature look of your job.  Also, with the costs of the gear in tomestones, if you want the full look, it's nearly seven weeks of capping out Esoterics. Seven weeks of mindless tomestone grinding to get the new AF gear for one job."

ffxiv,3e1q22,NamaeFF,-6,Tue Jul 21 09:22:42 2015 UTC,"It was, but why are you against the idea of grinding tomestone to get a 3rd iconic look?  There is already one readily available that you can wear at any time."
ffxiv,3e1q22,sheepcat87,4,Tue Jul 21 09:42:30 2015 UTC,"Because I don't feel like 'symbolic look of your job' should ever be locked behind endgame currency grinding. This seems to be a point on which we disagree, and I'm fine with that."
ffxiv,3e1q22,ultimatemisogynerd,-6,Tue Jul 21 09:46:17 2015 UTC,"OK so what I'm seeing here is no unidentified allagan tomestone equivalent, only an upgrade item from 200-210 for weapon. Does that mean eso weapons can be purchased and upgraded (when new CT comes out) to be same ilvl - and in some cases BiS - for absolutely no fucking work? Because that sounds ridiculous and kinda spits on savage. Same ilvl weapon for free."

ffxiv,3e27x5,knv0,6,Tue Jul 21 11:47:00 2015 UTC,"Ok so someone check my math here:  Fire IV's potency is 280*1.8=504, and then we divide by the cast time to get 504/3 = 168pps (potency per second)  A thundercloud proc is: 390 potency with instant cast time (2.5gcd) so it is 390/2.5=156pps.  However, if you even get one tic of damage from the following thunder dot, this goes to 172 pps, which is already higher than fire IV with just one dot tic. You get like 7 more dot tics after that, for 284pps.  So when we get a thundercloud proc, we should always replace a fire4 with it? note that this does not mess up enochains, it just swaps a fire4 for a proc."
ffxiv,3e27x5,Momoko_Tomoko,2,Tue Jul 21 12:16:33 2015 UTC,"If you did it after the middle f1 you shouldn't need to sacrifice a f4 unless you're on a reduced enochian timer, since you can fit 3 f4's onto the back end (cast time wise, not mp wise, hence having 3 f4's in a row with the convert opener). So if you get a TC in your fire rotation before the f1 you can use it there, and if you get it after the f1 then you should have time to save it until UI (I think?).  So f3>f4>f4>f1>tc>f4>f4>b3>b4 if you get the proc early. You should have enough time even if you get it while casting f3. If you get the proc after f1 then 10 seconds should be plenty of time to get to ui. So no matter when the proc registers, you'll have an opportunity to use it within 10 seconds.  Obviously you'd have to adapt for real fights with movement and such, but in dummy rotations I don't think you'd need to sacrifice anything."
ffxiv,3e27x5,zappadattic,2,Tue Jul 21 13:21:53 2015 UTC,"...This all assumes you've actually cast thunder somewhere, possibly blowing your sharpcast with it to make sure you've got a proc. In most cases I find I don't have time to cast it in umbral with b3>b4>f3 since I don't tend to have firestarter procs going into umbral since we don't cast f1 all that often anymore. If I do get a firestarter proc off the middle f1, it gets used before going into umbral if I'm not worried about the timer since its not going to last long enough to be used after b4.   Next up for patch day theorycrafting: When do you cast thunder at all (can't get tc procs without actually casting it somewhere). Should one be using sharpcast on thunder or using it with f1 for casting 3 f4's. The potency per second math above does suggest more damage out of TC than f4."
ffxiv,3e27x5,Coan_Arcanius,2,Tue Jul 21 14:09:47 2015 UTC,"regular thunder is still a good ui filler if you don't get a fast mana tic. All of what I said was assuming you get a proc, not trying to engineer a proc with sharpcast.   Should be interesting to math out the best use of sharpcast now though.   With other cd's up f1 still likely wins just to make the 6xf4 rotation work out. After that it might work better to sharp+t1>f3>f4>tc>f1>f4>f4>f4>b3 and then you don't have to sacrifice a f4. Just a net gain of procced t3."
ffxiv,3e27x5,zappadattic,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"regular thunder is still a good ui filler if you don't get a fast mana tic   I'm finding its fairly rare these days since b4 takes t1's place in umbral and has a longer cast time, plus the previously mentioned lack of firestarters. Plus for anyone who's a damned dirty cheater and using the mptick timer plugin for act can see the tick and it really feels like 90/95% of the time the remaining time before the tick > f3's cast.   On the second set of f4's there, wouldn't astral fall off around the same time as the third cast and slow down the b3 (and i'm trying to recall if you have the mana for that or if the non-astral reduced b3 mp>remaining mp at that point). I think I've been fucked by that before, but for some reason it's probably due to fucking something else up."

You could cast t1 before b4 in most rotations without messing up enochian, which might be more viable now with this buff (the issue before was that it wasn't worth it, not really that we couldn't find time). Also, with the increased proc chance it should be relatively common to be able to maintain it from procs without needing a ""fresh"" t1.    On the second set of f4's there, wouldn't astral fall off around the same time as the third cast and slow down the b3 (and i'm trying to recall if you have the mana for that or if the non-astral reduced b3 mp>remaining mp at that point).

ffxiv,3e27x5,zappadattic,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:42 2015 UTC,"On a fresh enoch, definitely, second or third, eh...really relying on tc there I suppose.   on the later thing with astral>umbral, this is what I get for posting at work and not being able to poke at any of this myself since as much as I know the rotation by muscle memory and watching the cooldowns on buffs rather than sit there and count ""ok, 1 fire 4 cast, 2 fire 4 cast, fire 1, 3 fire 4, 4 fire 4"" etc. I'm terrible that way :S  edit: figured out where the fuck I fuck up and lose af. I normally don't swiftcast in the 6f4 opener and sometimes make it to start b4 in time and sometimes don't. I got a feeling i get into a bad habit of fucking up the opener based on AST love and being the main target for when she draws arrow. With arrow, i should be fine to cast it without swiftcast (and can save it to save shit if I have to move)."
ffxiv,3e27x5,Coan_Arcanius,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"It's quite simple, if you have extra time on enochian, and you know you're gonna get a late mana tick, just go T1 -> B4. Otherwise just go B4 first. Your goal is to make B4 the last spell you cast before you hit F3."
ffxiv,3e27x5,pikagrue,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on my more recent comment, that kinda fits the first enochian, but not so much the rest. I find that more often than not, I don't have a late mana tick that's gonna be late enough that I shouldn't go straight through b3>b4>f3.  Still, I'll be trying to throw it back in where I can, maybe try some of zap's suggested rotations and see if I can notice a dps increase on a dummy."
ffxiv,3e27x5,Coan_Arcanius,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"It does mess up enochians though.  The very act of casting Thunder during your UI phase can frequently be the difference between Enochian falling off and sneaking in that refresh unless you have a chance to do the full rotation with no mechanics to deal with.  Whether or not you cast thunder at all is currently down to how the server MP ticks land when you go into UI.  Honestly, this feels like they're trying to shoehorn thunder back into the rotation.  Maybe it will get better with more spell speed, but right now it still doesn't seem worth it.  We'll have to see some hard numbers."
ffxiv,3e27x5,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:52 2015 UTC,"They also made it so using Enochian refreshes the timer back to 30 seconds, so you only have to ""survive"" two B4s per Enochian before you can pop it back. Assuming there's no specific reason to save Enochian for later...  Still level 58 BLM, didn't get to the true Enochian fun yet :("
ffxiv,3e27x5,kovensky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:55 2015 UTC,"The first one you have about 10 seconds left on the clock, the second and third are very tight because you don't have ley lines up.  The original problem was that if you used a single firestarter/thundercloud proc on the second or third rotations, you would literally not have the time to refresh Enochian because of the additional GCD used and it would fall off.  You can also run into issues with Astral Fire falling off during your Blizzard III cast when you dont have the remaining MP to cover the difference, which immediately cancels your cast and leaves you dead in the water waiting for natural MP ticks ><;"
ffxiv,3e27x5,ffxivthrowaway03,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:01 2015 UTC,The last part sounds horrifying D:
ffxiv,3e27x5,kovensky,0,Tue Jul 21 15:14:16 2015 UTC,"You can also run into issues with Astral Fire falling off during your Blizzard III cast when you dont have the remaining MP to cover the difference, which immediately cancels your cast and leaves you dead in the water waiting for natural MP ticks   If you run into this you can still cast blizzard1, get an mp tic, and then get back into your groove. If you somehow got low enough to not even use blizz1 you can use a mega-ether, but that shouldn't happen."
ffxiv,3e27x5,zappadattic,6,Tue Jul 21 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"T3/TC is 710 potency now, if you don't clip it. So your first proc has to land and last the duration before you refresh it again, and your next also has to do the same.   This is a replacement in most cases of non 30s enochian refresh for fire IV, and possibly to aid with dodging mechanics but its eventually going to lead to some clunky enochian refreshes: you'll be going to UI with a lot of mp which if you take time to recast it after B4 will lead to some dead time. Not recommended for quick mp ticks.   I would use it as filler on UI phase in slow mp tick cases but use your best judgement as to how to use the procs especially if its going to involve clipping."

ffxiv,3e27x5,blinkwise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:12:01 2015 UTC,Hmmm. People were complaining that they weren't using thunder anymore because of how strict the BLM rotation became with the enochian timer. This is their answer to that complaint. There really wasn't a need considering we could still use thunder it was just sometimes we'd have to leave it out of an umbral rotation depending on the mana tick.
ffxiv,3e27x5,Comfylala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:13:04 2015 UTC,"We did still use thunder but only very rarely, and we basically wasted Thundercloud procs unless they came at a very fortunate time."

ffxiv,3e27x5,Tesseon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:47:56 2015 UTC,I will still only throw out Thunder if I lose Enochian but the chances of that happening now are very slim (even if I refresh Enochian once with B4 then the skill itself will be back up within 5-15 seconds depending on when I refreshed).  I like that you could essentially refresh Enochian with the skill at like 2 or 3seconds left and go back up to 30 instantly. Thats pretty nice.  Only thing they need to do now is extend Astral Fire to 12s while under Enochian and I will be a happy boy.   Edit: Oh and increase Thundercloud time.
ffxiv,3e27x5,Tumdace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:05 2015 UTC,How would a thundercloud 3 proc not be worth a F4? The math doesn't seem to vet that out.
ffxiv,3e27x5,MannToots,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:22 2015 UTC,I know this isnt an ideal situation but has anyone tried the 2.0 rotation as a lvl 60 to see what the dps gap is (now with the thunder buff).
ffxiv,3e27x5,yukina_kori,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:58 2015 UTC,These  changes would be absolutely amazing If they had also made thunder cloud off gcd. Though now I will try adding in thunder 1 to my first and 3rd Enochian rotations.
ffxiv,3e27x5,LockonStratos420,0,Tue Jul 21 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"Seems like as good a place as any to drop some math. I was interested in the difference between proc rate now vs before, particularly since I'm sub-60 and don't have access to enochian.  Casting Thunder 1 gives 6 ticks, Thunder 2 gives 7, and Thunder 3 gives 8.  Previously, there was a 26.5% chance for thunder 1 to proc at least once by the time the final tick hit, based on one single thunder cast. That went up to 30.2% for thunder 2 and 33.7% for thunder 3.  Now, there's a 46.9% chance for thunder 1, 52.2% for thunder 2, and 57.0% for thunder 3. That's about a 70% increase!  What if you spread thunder to two targets? Out of the 12 ticks between two thunder 1s, there's a 71.8% chance now compared to 46.0% previously. For thunder 2, that's 77.1% vs 51.2%, and for thunder 3 that's 81.5% vs 56.0%.  Finally, spread to 3 targets: thunder 1 is 85.0% now vs 60.3% then, thunder 2 is 89.1% now vs 65.9% then, and thunder 3 is 92.0% now vs 70.8% then.  With a greater than 90% chance that thundercloud will proc if thunder 3 is used on 3 targets (for each set of 3 ticks per GCD, it's a 27.1% chance that one or more will proc), I feel like there'll be a fairly steady stream of procs compared to previously.   Once it's set up, there's 35 potency on each mob, which is 65 lower than if you just spam fire 2. There's a 27.1% chance of a 390 potency proc every GCD, which is more damage even without the DoT ticks than a fire 2 would put out on a group of 3, and is basically the same output as a fire 2 on a group of 4, before considering additional ticks. Rotate the targets of procs around to keep it up, refresh if it goes off a mob before a proc comes up, and use fire 2 in the mean time.  Differences in cast times are more math that I won't get into today, but.. possible new AoE lightning mage meta? At the very least, a potentially-viable change in pace when doing leveling roulette."
ffxiv,3e27x5,Sukutak,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:43 2015 UTC,It's still shit. BLM rotation hasn't changed at all.
ffxiv,3e27x5,-IDK_LOL_BLUE_HELLO-,2,Tue Jul 21 11:58:36 2015 UTC,"No, all it's done is buff the 2.0 rotation, it's still not worth using outside of that."
ffxiv,3e27x5,fuj0shi,0,Tue Jul 21 11:56:53 2015 UTC,"Well, Thundercloud III now has a higher damage potency than Fire IV (which is what, 365 with Astral III?). Would you really want to not push the shiny zapper button?  I think? I could be way off with Astral and mixing it up with Wanderer's Minuet. I'm too tired."
ffxiv,3e27x5,Nestama-Eynfoetsyn,3,Tue Jul 21 12:46:36 2015 UTC,"(which is what, 365 with Astral III?)   the 2 AF3 bonuses I've seen commonly cited are 1.8 and 1.87, so f4 is either 504 or 525 potency.   The DoT would still put it slightly over f4 potency, but not by a whole lot. It'll be worth using as long as it doesn't mess up your enochian timers. First enochian rotation has plenty of extra time, so it'd be good there, but it'll get sketchier the further into your rotation you are. If you happen to get thunderclouds that you can use in UI, this is a solid buff, but thundercloud was already good from UI."
ffxiv,3e27x5,zappadattic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:13:08 2015 UTC,"but thundercloud was already good from UI.   Unless you have 5 seconds to get Blizzard IV off and don't have Swiftcast available because you used it for Fire a boss/player made you move and you didn't want to cast Fire III (since you'd have to wait for the Astral buff to drop, which is now wasting Enochian time and... please stop me)."
ffxiv,3e27x5,Nestama-Eynfoetsyn,2,Tue Jul 21 13:26:15 2015 UTC,"True lol, but generally that's not a problem on your 1st rotation since you get plenty of time, and after your 3rd rotation you'll be refreshing the natural cooldown anyways, so that was only a problem some of the time on 1/3 of the rotations."
ffxiv,3e27x5,zappadattic,2,Tue Jul 21 13:29:21 2015 UTC,"Past the first rotation you're praying mechanics even let you use the full rotation anymore.  Thunder just became slightly better situational filler, but it's still situational filler."
ffxiv,3e27x5,ffxivthrowaway03,0,Tue Jul 21 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah but third rotation gives some leeway as well. On a dummy situation you came out having to wait a bit refreshing enochian (not anymore since it'll refresh to full duration). Since you could afford to let it fall off since you were gonna refresh it anyways, you could do some neat things with the 3rd rotation.  This is more true now that enochian refreshes. This means your third rotation can now ""borrow"" time from the following 1st rotation if need be.   Mechanics can throw a wrench into things, but there's still some flexibility in the 1st and 3rd rotations. The 2nd one is the tightest."
ffxiv,3e27x5,zappadattic,3,Tue Jul 21 14:30:06 2015 UTC,"True, now that Enochian doesn't fudge its own timer we do have a little wiggle room.  I feel like Thunder is going to be worth it on fights like Alex Floor 1 where you can multidot and get a decent amount of procs, but might still not be worth it on a hard single target fight depending on mechanics.  Nice if it gets squeezed in, but not the end of the world if it doesnt."
ffxiv,3e27x5,ffxivthrowaway03,0,Tue Jul 21 14:31:57 2015 UTC,It'll be worth using as long as it doesn't mess up your enochian timers.   Since thundercloud gives us plenty of time to use it just replace a F4 with a T3 proc and bam dps increase. Shouldn't be that difficult to keep it from breaking enochian rotations. Even 1 tick of the thundercloud proc makes it stronger than the F4 you're replacing from the math someone dropped further up in this thread.

ffxiv,3e26gm,Katsugankz,2,Tue Jul 21 11:30:40 2015 UTC,The group I saw clear it had their OT pick up adds and focus on DPSing the boss. It was just a straight burn.
ffxiv,3e26gm,nightshadetb01,-3,Tue Jul 21 11:32:12 2015 UTC,So the OT picks up adds and then goes back to hitting Faust? Or does the OT stay away from the party to avoid cleaving them?   Though I imagine there's a way to position the adds so that they don't cleave anyone while still being able to beat on Faust.

Alexander normal = story mode content  Alexander savage = coil or raid tier content  Savage coil was just an extreme version of the raid tier content.

ffxiv,3e38gc,Albireookami,7,Tue Jul 21 18:15:50 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they already said there was too little interest in savage coil that they would not do that anymore.   hard to have interest when the only reward from going in was achievements.  If they had put superior gear in it things would have been different.
ffxiv,3e38gc,Zarzak_TZ,0,Tue Jul 21 17:46:02 2015 UTC,"If they had put superior gear in it things would have been different.   But then they would have been the top-tier content. Which Savage coil was not meant to be. it was meant to be a challenge, because ""so many"" people were clamoring for a more difficult coil at the time.  So when they released a more difficult content (which they weren't even sure anyone could clear them), just for funsies, only a few people took part of it. The reward was supposed to be bragging rights, but very few people cared about that. People just want top gear, which is why they aren't doing something like that again.   They'll just design raids that are meant to be difficult, but doable."
ffxiv,3e38gc,xtkbilly,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:00:36 2015 UTC,Oh I agree 100% I'm just saying that it would have been a LOT more popular if it actually dropped a higher tier of gear.  Not every raider cares about e-peen.    I raided for years in the #2 guild serverwide on EQ... Still couldn't have paid me to even try Savage.  I'm not going to spend hours learning an event for a achievement.  Put gear on it and I'd have been 1st in line cause I'd actually be progressing my character.
ffxiv,3e38gc,Zarzak_TZ,5,Tue Jul 21 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"It would be nice though to have some raid content that is a bit more difficult. It people are able to clear an entire raid in one day, it's too easy."
ffxiv,3e38gc,Str1der,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"As far as we know only a1 savage is cleared so far.  A2-4 may be significantly more difficult.  Lets wait till the a4 clears are posts to pass judgement.  That said, even if lucrezia and Elysium clear a4 today, that doesn't make the content ""easy"""
ffxiv,3e38gc,kazemakase,4,Tue Jul 21 16:59:27 2015 UTC,"A2 is fairly faceroll in normal, but I can easily see that being both a heal and DPS check, plus it'd be easy to ramp up the mechanics slightly."
ffxiv,3e38gc,shuopao,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"I only really have WoW to compare this too, but even the best guilds in the world take about 2 weeks to clear the hardest content. That's two weeks of raiding 5+ nights, hours at a time.  I'm not saying FF14 needs raids of that caliber, but I see no reason that we can't have something in between, ya know? I agree that it remains to be seen how hard the next 3 fights will be, and I'll gladly take my comment back if it turns out that these raids are actually much harder than they let on to be. That'd make me happy!  Personally, I think FF14 could follow the system WoW uses for their raids. LFR = Story, Savage = Normal, New Harder Mode = Heroic/Mythic. Now you've made everyone happy: the very casual players can do Story, the more adventurous players can do Savage, and the really hardcore get their own difficulty."

Not having it would be like a Paladin simply not using half their abilities."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Shredswithwheat,3,Mon Jul 20 23:50:05 2015 UTC,"Except having that 15% damage increase DOES help hold threat. More damage dealt = more threat gained. Blood price is stupid good, and once you hit 56, abyssal drain is amazing.  Plus soul sacrifice at 58. There's so many tools to maintain mana. And no one is going to fault you for dropping it between pulls to get mana back a bit faster, but it should be back up by the time you pull the next group"
ffxiv,3dxx4i,TrainerBlack2,3,Tue Jul 21 04:18:34 2015 UTC,"Personally, when I Dark Knight, I have both stances on but will take off Darkside between pulls if there's enough time.  If there isn't, I pop my strongest Ether and use Syphon Strike and, if it's able to be used, Blood Price.  EDIT:  By my definition, ""if there's enough time"" means a situation where I have to either wait for things to happen (Copperbell's mining shafts come to mind) or there's no mobs between where I am and the boss.  Usually, if 5 or more ticks of MP regen can occur between turning off Darkside and turning it back on, I turn it off."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,FlanxLycanth,10,Mon Jul 20 14:00:13 2015 UTC,"What's the point in turning it off, regen surpases drain out of combat so you'll regen between pulls. You're only causing yourself to spend more MP on recast.  Edit: well you learn something new everyday."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Leetwheats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:03:09 2015 UTC,"You regen more with it off, the recast on it is insignificant compared to the mp restored between pulls. Tested fully. What is NOT worth it is turning off grit, cause that shit takes up like a third of the mp."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,FlanxLycanth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:39 2015 UTC,Hm. Well I can't disagree but usually I find that I've Plunged myself into a new group very quickly after that previous pull dies out. I'll try it out myself tonight.
ffxiv,3dxx4i,mala0682,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:54 2015 UTC,"I generally only switch it off if i somehow managed to OOM myself close to the end of a fight to save time till the next pull. While you DO get regen ticks with Darkside up out of combat, they are somewhere around 100-150ish per tick at 7k mana, while without darkside you get ~600ish ticks or something along those lines."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,FlanxLycanth,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:42 2015 UTC,I'll try it tonight but I just know that I'm gonna end up Plunging before I remember to recast it lol.
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Stochastic__Process,2,Mon Jul 20 14:57:31 2015 UTC,If you get at least t four ticks you have more mana than if you left it on.
ffxiv,3dxx4i,FlanxLycanth,2,Mon Jul 20 14:11:56 2015 UTC,"Well if you're sure, I can't say I did such intense maths. Blood price is up every pull anyway."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Zenrot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"It just depends on the distance, and Darkside isn't overly expensive (400ish mana), so you can regen mana much faster with it off. If your ticks give you 150 without it on, after 4 ticks you've got a net gain of about 150 mana. It tends to just speed up pulls, especially if you're on the lower end and blood price may not save you while you're establishing hate."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,FlanxLycanth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think I hardly ever end pulls without half my mana anyway, price and syphon are really op.   I find ""establishing hate"" never really goes past the initial Plunge+Unleash, things stick to DRK really hard so it's not like you'll be drained before you can pop price."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Zenrot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on the situation. Price is OP as hell but Syphon won't self-sustain in big ""speed-run"" pulls where you're trying to keep hate off BLMs flaring huge packs. Unless you're doing small pulls Plunge + Unleash isn't holding everything.   Then again I like to push my AoE with Dark Arts so I expend more mana on average."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,FlanxLycanth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you know, it may be dumb inefficient but if you're speed running and you make a mad pull the regen from price allows you to spam Unleash for it's whole duration lol."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,cammiesoul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"Someone already said something to a similar effect, but to share the math I worked out, outside combat, darkside off is double the mp regen rate of darkside on. Furthermore, one mp tick with darkside off is enough to pay for its activation. After that it gives more total after a few ticks."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,themindstream,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:29 2015 UTC,"Besides natural regen, those breaks in a prolonged fight may well be the point the Bard in the party has time to pop Mage Balad, which they can't benefit from in Darkside. (things like Diamond Dust in Shiva and most ""pause for ultimate attack"" moments I try to pop it each time to top off the healers and cover the inevitable AoE healing that usually follows.)"
ffxiv,3dxx4i,JPark19,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"I always turn off Darkside moving in to the phase after the Ganas on Ravana EX, by the time he's done flying around I have full MP again regardless if a Bard is present or not."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,dragonboy387,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tend to do the same thing in between pulls, due to Darkside reducing your MP regen by...quite a bit.  Plus, for groups of enemies (once I have good aggro of course, several Unleashes and such), i'll occasionally turn off Grit and replace it with Shadowskin (since same 20% damage reduction) for extra damage, plus add Blood Weapon (and blood Price if available) to restore MP / attack faster.  Makes dungeons a lot more fun, I think. :D"

I've only ever had it drop a few times when I ran out of MP after my initial threat rotation after a botched blood price the fight before so I never realized how much of a difference it makes until I healed a DRK that didn't care to use Darkside and saw how much less enmity they had."

ffxiv,3dxx4i,NuggetHighwind,5,Mon Jul 20 22:29:04 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of an ST run I once did. Tank and healer were trolling the entire time. Kicked the healer, got a different replacement a minute later.    But, we kicked the tank six fucking times, then he rejoined and none of us were able to initiate a votekick. There's no way that should be allowed."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,fuck_you_rhenoplos,12,Mon Jul 20 23:15:37 2015 UTC,That's when reporting misconduct comes in to play
ffxiv,3dxx4i,sometimesaqt,6,Mon Jul 20 13:31:01 2015 UTC,"In all fairness though, he isn't abusing  the system. He cannot  come in purposely to the same group. This is entirely SE's  fault because he is joining in progress to get the faster queue."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Sunjing84,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:30 2015 UTC,"Happened in my DF, except we each vote kick the healer once and he still got back in and we could no longer kick him.  He just gets back in and proceeds to do nothing but keep voting to kick someone in the group.  He ended logging off and we had to vote abandon.  If a person is kicked from a DF party, they should not be allowed back in.  He got back in 3 times, which is rediculous."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Nestama-Eynfoetsyn,4,Mon Jul 20 16:07:24 2015 UTC,You can report that behaviour to the GM's and they will do something about it. That WHM intentionally disrupted your gameplay.

ffxiv,3dxx4i,helloitsumi,2,Mon Jul 20 23:21:50 2015 UTC,Was running Satasha HM couple months ago. We kicked the tank 3 times all 3 times he joined back.
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Freis,3,Mon Jul 20 19:02:21 2015 UTC,"It's not all that bad.  I entered a dungeon once without my guild turning on the guild buffs (heat of battle, etc) and after they told me they did, I told the group to kick me so I can get the buff and I promised to requeue back in.  Worked like a charm and I was instantly back in with the same group."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,HughesDePayens,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes.  We kicked some healer because he was being a dick.  Basically, in Fractal, I told him we needed burst heal for the multi-hit move.   He went off on me about having vuln stacks and trying to pass off the blame. I'd been having lag issues, so chances are I did have stacks, but that wasn't what I was doing - I was simply pointing out that heals are required during that particular part.  Anyway, he decided he didn't want to play any longer and stood at spawn. Then he tried to get someone else kicked, which didn't work.  So we kicked him instead.  Immediately he re-joins and says 'AHAHAHAH YOU CANT GET RID OF ME LOL'. So we just vote abandoned and left.  Why would they allow people who were kicked back into a dungeon they were kicked from - literally 2 seconds prior?"
ffxiv,3dxx4i,lyerhis,11,Mon Jul 20 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"They should lock kicked players out from requeuing in progress for 30 minutes. That way you're not going to get the same person over and over again, and if the person was unfairly kicked, they wouldn't want to play with you again, anyway."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,sometimesaqt,8,Mon Jul 20 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"Or they should fix it where they don't get queued to the same group. They pay the same subscription as you do. If they  are really harassing  you, file a report. No player  should  be locked  out like that.  30 minutes  is not fair  to a player kicked out  by the whims of others."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,lyerhis,4,Mon Jul 20 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, I am talking specifically about queue in progress, not instances in general.  And sure, a 30 min. CD is a little long, so maybe even like 5-10 min. That way, if you've been harassing people, you can either start from the beginning or at least won't end up in the same group. And if you were unfairly kicked, I think most people would take about that long to calm down and take a breath before diving back in again, anyway."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,illy-chan,3,Mon Jul 20 16:11:17 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly fair though, the are a lot of reasons that someone could be kicked that don't warrant that. I got kicked once because my connection dropped during a trial. Which I get, but why should I have a penalty after I took care of my connection problem?  And that's not even counting when people gey kicked over BS."

Knew most of them and even the FC leader I had his cell phone .   One day I log in and I have no FC , no static ls , nothing.  And all silence. They removed me from friends list and psn , later on I decide it's best to just transfer servers , and I find out a rumour was spread about me trying to get dick pics from teenagers online or some bs(which is obviously wrong).   Fast forward a few months later I get queued up in world of darkness with a couple of them from famfrit and get called a pedophile most of the run.   Yay mmo experiences!"

ffxiv,3dxx4i,gaygeekdad,18,Mon Jul 20 16:42:54 2015 UTC,"Here is why this can't work:  -We are queued for 8 man content. I'm a healer. You are a DPS. The queue needs 1 tank to pop, then we go in.  -A tank queues! Hurray!   -Except... he's on your blacklist. Your blacklist is causing 6 other people to have to sit and wait. I don't know why you blacklisted him. Maybe fairly, maybe unfairly... either way he's never done anything to me, and I'd like to get this show on the road. Instead... we wait.  -Another tank queues! Hurray!  -Except that tank has me blacklisted. I told him his shoes didn't match the rest of his outfit, and he took offense. Now because of my callus footwear appraisal, 6 other people have to wait longer.  Imagine how this can snowball when dealing with 24 man content. Squabbles between a handful of players slows down queues for everyone."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Woe2you,6,Mon Jul 20 19:45:11 2015 UTC,"The easy solution is that the player using the blacklist drops down the list. In your example, rather than the tank being passed over, the dps who blacklisted the tank is passed over. The tank queues, the group fills, and everyone is happy. The dps'er goes in the next group, with a slightly longer wait, but hey, they didn't have to play with people on their blacklist."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,villadelfia,5,Mon Jul 20 16:13:42 2015 UTC,But what about the blacklists of all other players?  Who's blacklist gets violated first removing them from the group?  Is there a hierarchy?  DPS always get checked and chucked first?
ffxiv,3dxx4i,daknapp0773,22,Mon Jul 20 17:13:13 2015 UTC,"I would imagine a logic like this:  If A has B blacklisted, but not the other way around A will get booted.  If they are mutually blacklisted, the dps will get booted before the healer before the tank. If of equal ""rank"" the one that was in the queue earlier stays.  In a situation where multiple A's exist I would work with a 2:1 ratio. 1 tank is able to displace 2 healers or 4 dps from the queue. 1 healer is able to displace 2 dps from the queue.  Since dealing with queue congestion will put someone at a disadvantage, I firmly believe that it should be the people that have a choice in the matter (if you do not want to deal with it, don't blacklist people).  In the end, even when you do your best to keep queue congestion to a minimum, it will still happen. So I think the best solution is no solution, and people should just deal with it."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,countrpt,11,Mon Jul 20 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"This is only an issue if the amount of people blacklisting players goes too high to create a reasonable queue time.   Without actual numbers you cannot claim this will not actually work. It is far more likely that people have a rare few blacklisted and preventing you from queuing into people you have on your blacklist would lengthen queue times by an unnoticeable amount of time, on the incredibly rare chance it happens in the first place.  Your example paints a scenario where everyone on the server has each other blacklisted for petty reasons, when in reality, most blacklists are legit issues and implementing this would only serve to realistically lengthen queue times for people that are blacklisted on a LOT of people's accounts (aka confirmed douchebags)."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,countrpt,4,Mon Jul 20 20:24:38 2015 UTC,"When architecting solutions like this, you have to consider the most complicated scenario.  Plus, if they did make it so that the blacklist would prevent you from being matched with someone in the Duty Finder, there's a good chance that it would increase the use of the feature, thus making this sort of scenario more likely.  (The blacklist would now have a secondary use as a way of filtering ""bad"" players.)  It doesn't actually take a whole lot of connections to bog things down, and the chances increase the larger the pool of players (i.e. 24-person raids, or the odd 72-person PvP)."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,DoctorDiscourse,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:49 2015 UTC,"Beyond this cascading complication, the other technical issue is that the duty finder is cross-server within a data center, so it doesn't actually have direct access to your blacklist.  When you queue, it basically just gets your ID, your server, the duty you're queuing for, and the class/job.  In order for the proposed feature to work, it'd also have to send your entire list at the same time.  This increases the data to be transmitted significantly (since a lot of people's blacklists are full of spammers; even if those people might not ever actually show up in the duty finder, they can't assume), in addition to the complexity of the matching algorithm (as was mentioned).  Also, if you were to add/remove someone from your blacklist while waiting for the queue, those obviously would not be included.  My guess is that, for all these reasons, Square-Enix would probably just say that if you want to control your party, use the Party Finder instead, and only use the Duty Finder to find other players if you're okay being matched with any player from any server in your data center.  Obviously that's an imperfect solution, as it means the choices are total control vs. no control... but I think the technical hurdles for the proposed change are probably too large to be deemed worth it."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Anagittigana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"From the player using the Blacklist's perspective, said wait is warranted. It's the system learning a player's behavior via the reaction of other players. A smart system is much better than a dumb system, don't you agree?"
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Casmir_Chevalier,4,Mon Jul 20 18:20:32 2015 UTC,This is correct. Nobody developing the group finder matrching algorithm will care about blacklists for this reason. How are the comments below so stupid?

He joined a pony farm when they were a thing, we got the Sol bonus message and no one fessed up.  He is a BRD and died twice, we still won and look it there he was the newbie.  Oh look the pony drops, he gets it and leaves the party.  So he got a free clear, the pony and leaves after that one run.  So he gets into my group through DF and asks if I am on his server.  I just say I am on Famfrit and nothing more.

ffxiv,3dxx4i,PrincessGary,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"I think one issue is it starts you at lvl 30 and doesn't enforce good tanking habits from scratch. You get dumped with 30 levels worth of skills right from the start. It also doesn't require you to earn any valuable cross-class skills from MAR/GLA to get the job. That's how you end up with DRKs who don't understand the skills or don't have provoke. They probably finished 2.55 as a dps and DRK looked cool. Which is totally fine, but ignoring the established tank mechanics of the game shared across all tank jobs is not."

ffxiv,3dxx4i,PrincessGary,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:41 2015 UTC,"It's not quite so overwhelming if you've played other tank jobs - the skills you get up to 30 are pretty similar in terms of what they do.  You get a tank stance, aggro combo, and a dps/utility combo and a stun just like WAR/PLD. The only real difference is the extra DRK flair, which you can just practice with a few FATEs. Besides, it's fun!"

ffxiv,3dxx4i,PrincessGary,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say try out GLA at first, as it's nice and simple - you need it up to 22 anyway for Provoke. Try to do some dungeons too, as they're a great opportunity to hammer in the tanking basics (getting initial aoe enmity, numbering kill orders, etc.) and practice keybinds. Everything below 30 however is pretty low-stress, so don't worry too much about it."

As a DPS I cycle though the targets if I'm not doing AOE so that if I'm about to pull hate I move on to the next one. But only people who have played and leveled tanks think to do this."

ffxiv,3dxx4i,jessicaredding,2,Mon Jul 20 13:12:14 2015 UTC,"Como to think of it, you brought a valid point. What are the odds that the other 2 players plus the blacklisted guy were from the same server? They queued up together.  captain obvious flies away"
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Gangreless,2,Mon Jul 20 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"I'm in favor of this. Hasn't happened to me (yet). But if it did, I will now auto-abandon and mine for a half hour considering that there are people who actually enjoying slogging to a boss only to kick someone."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Woe2you,2,Mon Jul 20 15:42:09 2015 UTC,"I hate it when this happens. Not only are you paired up with a player you blacklisted, now you're in a dungeon with them and you can't even communicate temporarily because there is no way to adjust blacklist while in a dungeon.   SE should just make it so you never get paired with a blacklisted player in DF or they should at least make it so you can temporarily disable the blacklist if you get in a party together, so that you can at least communicate with them if you need to regarding the dungeon."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,breakerv,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:14 2015 UTC,"Another interesting thing about this game:  If you DC in a dungeon and need to reconnect, your blacklist will not work for the remainder of the dungeon. If you are in an FC or LS with someone you have blacklisted then you will see everything they say until you complete your duty."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,chamjin,2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"Explains why people can still see the blisted person talking in duties. When you get put into a duty, you get placed on a different server. So your blacklist is hosted on your server, not some global server and doesn't get transferred with you when you go into the duty server. So when you DC and go back into the dungeon, your blist isn't there because it has to be pulled from your server in order for you to view it."
ffxiv,3dxx4i,Nestama-Eynfoetsyn,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you actually want this.   The easiest way to implemented for four-man content is to eliminate players from the same server because you can't blacklist players from other servers.    That would be a single query that would be easy to handle.  Matching algorithms, and matching markets for that matter, can become quite complex because a single match may occur but it can be prohibitive of other matches.    The only criteria the df takes into account atm, as far as I know, is role restrictions.  If we add personal preference of ALL 23 players on a 24 man dungeon, and each player has 10 people from their server on black list, not only will you exclude 230 people from various servers, you also exclude however many people have blacklisted any of the 23 players already pre-formed.  Everyone wants what they want.  But how much allowance are you willing to give to the preferences of others?"

Happened to me some months back in Amdapor Keep Normal (I was a SCH, tank was a WAR and the two DPS were BLM's. The BLM's were clearly under the map). Soul Collector demons attacked me before the barrier dropped.  The WAR and I reported the two BLM's and shortly after, the BLM's disappeared. I don't think they left on their own, since combat music was playing (and if you have hate, you can't leave until you're KO'd or kill the mob), so I like the think a GM yanked them into the Gaol."

WoW also has the ability to put players from other servers on ignore, so you don't get partied with them.  It is actually unnoticeable in queue wait times. It's not that big of a deal as people are making it out to be. I understand people will argue that WoW has a bigger player base, but also realize that their battlegroups (what SE calls data centers) have 10 or more servers in them. That's a lot of people ignoring other people, and it's never been a problem. You'd be surprised at the amount of people that don't even bother to put people on ignore, so it actually ends up not being an issue. I would use the ignore ability much more often than a regular player, as I don't put up with any shit. It takes two clicks to put them on ignore and you never have to hear their whining or bitching again. Every month or so, I'd go through and clean out my ignore list, but many times I've been grouped with people I'd previously had on ignore, and they were just as unpleasant as they were before. Dungeon Finder and Raid Finder queue times were the exact same as if my ignore list was empty.  It can be done, it has been done, and on a much larger scale to boot. It will not hinder your gameplay or wait times, but will actually make DF a more pleasant experience in knowing if you get grouped with an asshole, you have the ability to not be grouped with them again."

They will take it as you are attacking them and that's it.   I had 2 people telling me I was dumb on my summoner for using the blizzard aoe (the blackmages), and that I should be using ruin  instead. I explained to them that any pull of 3 mobs or more, it does more damage than even ruin 3, but I only use it on 4 + mobs. 50 potency x 3 = 150.

The enterprise could only be updated while nidhogg is alive while it's post 3.0 story, but then lolorito should have settled things and Raubahn should be free.

He's up to similar  adventuring the same as we are. Just because we haven't run across him yet doesn't mean he's  a prop for our characters to stand-in for.

Especially as he lacked the contact with Haurchefant that granted us passage?"

We'll learn more about the WoD as we go. It's not like HW is done.  Why was he on the fields at Cartenau with his superfriends? What was he up to in the five years between The Battle of Silvertear and 1.0? Why did he team up with Elidibus yet still be a good guy every time we see him? Who knows. But he's a dude doing things.

ffxiv,3dzxlu,seathasky,2,Tue Jul 21 03:46:19 2015 UTC,"Seriously, the community seems so much friendlier.  I'm leveling my first ever character, and last night hit the Titan fight.  We wiped once due to a DC right at the start (Wipe #1).   No problem, come back in, get going.  He does his big stomp thing that you need to stack near the edge for, and I go too far and get knocked off (Wipe #2).  The healer explains what to do on that, we get going, make it to the heart, I get gaoled right on Titan's leg so the other people don't notice and I spend a long time doing nothing.  Eventually they break me out but we are so far behind it's a big Wipe #3.  Next attempt, a very poorly timed jump on my part leads to me getting knocked off the platform (I was trying to move, but didn't quite make it in time).  Wipe #4, so glad you could join us.  On the next attempt, we finally get it done.  Nobody falls off, every gaol gets broken asap, super smooth.  What amazed me was how chill everyone was about it.  I apologized after all my mistakes, and was met with a lot of ""Don't worry about it, you're new"" and ""It's ok, now you know what to do different.""  I played WoW pretty constantly from it's launch until May of this year, and I don't think I ever saw that reaction in a random.  Usually if there is a single wipe it's cause for whoever caused it to be threatened with anything unpleasant people could think of, followed by a vote kick (or not even a wipe, as one of the final incidents before I quit was my priest getting kicked out of a group because I went to get a glass of water after a boss and said I would be right back).

But well it is your first time and the game pointed it out at the start of the fight so a lot of players will definitely go easy on you.  Good luck with your Main story quest and remember to do Hard mode of the primals again when you reach lvl 50 ( because it is 1 of the requirements among many others to get to Heavenward expansion )"

Basically it was really difficult for anyone to agree on what was a good post and what wasn't. The general consensus though was that a good quality post required time or effort (or possibly high creativity) to make, and bad quality posts were the low effort ones, mostly captioned screenshots or the like.   From my own observation, I agree with what most people are saying - there are just as many, if not more, good quality posts as before and plenty of awesome posters around. But there has also been an increase in low effort material. So I'd guess that there's just more material overall with no real change in proportion, which is really not a bad thing."

IGN: Mishu Gashu  As you are someone coming from WoW, I feel it is essential to say this... SLOW DOWN! Read the quests, get involved with the lore of the world. I know everything is about spamming quests without reading them in WoW, but questing in FFXIV is quite a different experience, I think. Feel free to tinker around with other classes (once you unlock them, after your first level 10 class quest). The only limit to the number of classes you can play is the number of classes there are."
ffxiv,3dzxlu,mishugashu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"I really think it has to do with a ridiculously high retention rate of players in FFXIV.  WoW is on a down-swing, and you can see the same things with TERA, RIFT and other games that lose a lot of their population.  Many of the more casual players leave, and the most dedicated and die-hard fans stay.  Unfortunately, a few of the dedicated players are also the most toxic to newcomers.  When this minority starts to make up a larger proportion of your player base (because everyone else left), it starts to create a downward cycle in the quality of the community."

Even in the hard mode dungeons/trials I've done nobody's bothered to explain anything, usually only one person saying ""you'll die"".  Also, I'm not sure how it is on your server, but unfortunately most people are in the expansion/late game areas, there's almost nobody in lower level zones anymore.  It really felt like a different game a few months ago."
ffxiv,3dzxlu,DAOWAce,3,Mon Jul 20 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"I would have to disagree with the statement ""there's almost nobody in lower level zones"". While it's possible it may be true on your server at certain times of the day, I was actually surprised the other day when I went out to do the level 52 quest on my ninja.  Upper La Noscea, both where I teleported to (Bronze Lake) and where the quest location was (on the lower level side of the zone), there were many players. Quite a few low level/new players I saw, and likely some that were leveling other jobs. I was pleasantly surprised, actually.  I'm not saying it's like that at all times of day on all servers, but at this point of the day it seemed like that particular zone was getting a lot of use. And I never see any other ""old"" zone I go to completely devoid of players. There's always someone, somewhere, at least during the times that I play."
ffxiv,3dzxlu,Cynessae,3,Tue Jul 21 07:04:06 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be as honest as possible. The community isn't that much better than WoW's because the people who are playing FFXIV are that much nicer, it's because FFXIV has incentives for playing nice and mitigates the aspects of other MMOs that breeds animosity for other players.   First of all, seeing a new player is rarely a negative experience. The only time seeing a new player is a bad thing is during difficult content and that's a rarity in FFXIV. Out in the world you lose nothing by helping people in Fates which are the easiest way to level since no one person can hurt your chances of getting rewards. You don't need a group, you just swoop in, kill things, get rewards, and leave without having anyone ruin your experience because they usually can't and if they did they would lose out as well. Seeing newbies in dungeons gives you an experience boost or extra tomestones which makes teaching them relatively painless since there's a reward for doing so. There's also no world PvP which completely removes one vector for player animosity from the game and makes playing in the world more pleasant.   Another feature that removes player animosity is the lack of a feature: addons. This levels the playing field as far as gameplay goes, as you don't have the split between players ""in the know"" about game changing addons like Deadly Boss Mods and players who aren't. The lack of DBM also makes players more receptive to learning fights naturally, as there's no addon that pays attention for you.   It's also primarily a story based game and fairly casual for an MMO. While there is some difficult content, FFXIV is a laid back game for an MMO as there's not a lot of competition to be had. It's well understood that most of the people playing are playing for the story or at a casual pace, unlike WoW which ended up being all about dick measuring contests."

The community isn't that much better than WoW's because the people who are playing FFXIV are that much nicer, it's because FFXIV has incentives for playing nice and mitigates the aspects of other MMOs that breeds animosity for other players.   It's odd that you put a negative slant on it. To me, it's an example of brilliant design and excellent good sense on the part of Yoshi and the rest of the Square design team.  Many people who are typicially kind can be driven to nastiness by frustration and boredom; designing a game that does not provoke that, or that mitigates it with a reward, just gives people room to be decent to each other more often.   So yes, the community IS nicer -- because the game is nicer, the design team is nicer, and the emphasis is on teamwork, not competition. This is pure genius on the part of an MMO maker, because even a good MMO can be destroyed by a bad community, and even a flawed MMO can be fun with a good one. Setting the community at each others' throats and aggravating your players with boredom and frustration is setting yourself up to fail (cough Wildstar cough). Yoshi and Co. were smarter than that, and it's why I don't begrudge them their sub fee. They've earned it, and they continue to earn it."

It's self congratulatory in the worst way, and while the community IS nicer than other games, it's because of the good work by the design team."
ffxiv,3dzxlu,brain_fuckler,2,Tue Jul 21 05:39:29 2015 UTC,"I think a good portion of it is that the slow pace of the game's combat makes it easier for newcomers to MMOs in general to actually be effective. This is a game designed for Final Fantasy fans as much as it is for MMO players, and a side effect of that is that the typical hardcore MMO raider is a much smaller portion of the population than they normally would be."
ffxiv,3dzxlu,Xnfbqnav,2,Tue Jul 21 05:49:17 2015 UTC,"This game has Recount, Omen, and even a form of Deadly Boss Mods from third party programs. Yes, you can get banned for using them, but only if you talk about using them in game. Even then someone needs to report you. I have many friends that use these and have for extended periods of time. I know for a fact that several top guilds use them as well.   In my opinion, the lack of addons does the exact opposite of what you claim. It widens the gap in the playing field because several players either don't know how to install them, or they simply don't out of fear of breaking the rules.  All of that aside, I do think that this game has a wonderful community. By design, it certainly promotes more friendly behavior than WoW does. I just don't believe it has anything to do with lack of addons."

I've been present for the launch of almost every raid and expansion since then. I've DPSed and more recently healed. Raided with a couple guilds, my most recent I've been with for over two years.   During my WoW tenure, I tried out several other MMOs: Rift, The Old Republic, Guild Wars 2, and even considered trying Wildstar. None of these games held my interest like WoW did and I put days and days of playtime into them.  FFXIV is a beast unlike any other. The community is phenomenal- almost everyone in dungeons and raids is incredibly nice and helpful.  Everyone who plays WoW understands the mentality of hating every person who hasn't yet learned one mechanic of a fight, even if it just came out. While I've been frustrated before and other players have as well, no one in FFXIV has been straight mean or elitist in any of my groups. I'm sure most WoW players can't even comprehend that. FFXIV has a FUN leveling experience. While I do think WoW has better quests in general (FF's basically consist of teleporting to one side of the continent, talking to a person, teleporting back, repeat), the story is much more engaging in FF. I was a little bored between levels 20 and 40 but the end of ARR and all of Heavensward is spectacular. I'm taking my sweet time leveling, something I haven't done since Wrath of the Lich King.

Also you can queue next abilities .5 sec before finish casting ur current one as long as your latency isn't terrible.

I know there is a large exodus of WoW players to XIV, and it kind of scared me when I heard that, because I don't want that community bringing down ours.   I'm crossing my fingers that these migrating WoW players learn to play nice. It'd be a shame to see such a wonderful community brought down by a few jerks from a different game.  I came from WoW back in 2013, and have no drive to come back.

Sorry, but I'm not anal about my numbers being as high as mathematically possible at the cost of gil that I already struggle with keeping. Also, the thought of double weaving my cool downs in between my weaponskills makes me cringe."
ffxiv,3e00f6,lvl27cubone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that you can simply push the PS+Leg Sweep up to the GCD gap the pot was in.   From there it gets kinda tricky because of positionals. You want to be behind the enemy because of Chaos Thrust, and you also want to be using your Power Surge on Jump rather than Spineshatter Dive because of the % increase on a higher potency skill. The issue is that Jump locks your movement for practically the entire GCD gap and you may have to position if you get Fang and Claw, which would make you have to delay your next GCD which is no good. I'd assume the safest way to deal with this is just use Dragonfire Dive since it won't consume Power Surge.  So it'd be HT > Litany+BfB > ID > IR+BotD > Dis > PS+Leg > CT > DFD > 4th > Jump > Phleb > SSD > TT > Geirskogul > VT > Life Surge > Full Thrust > 4th  Have to confirm if this would be the optimal opener without pot. Shouldn't be a problem though since Power Surge lasts long enough to use on Jump and Leg Sweep is a damage skill, so timers should persist the same as they do with the Potion opener. Only difference I can really see here is the lack of a potion stacking with all this could make buff times change, but I doubt it.   /u/tenshinaito Thoughts on this? (Hope your trip is going well btw. Looking forward to your return)"
ffxiv,3e00f6,PigMazurka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:58:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, except for a few small modifications. I like placing BotD just before CT when I'm not using a potion, since this will give my BotD an extra 2.4 seconds. Also, I keep the off-GCD ordering after Chaos Thrust identical to the approach of the potion opener, since doing so simplifies positionals while still guaranteeing that our jumps are as buffed as possible.  HT-> BL+BFB -> ID -> IR -> Dis -> BotD -> CT -> LegS+PS -> 4th -> Jump -> Phleb -> DFD ->TT -> SSD -> VT -> GK+LifeS -> FT  Thanks for the well-wishing, by the way! Vacation is fantastic so far."

ffxiv,3e00f6,EvilToastyBagel,2,Tue Jul 21 09:16:50 2015 UTC,"Geir or not, once you have one of the 4th attacks theres ZERO reason to let BotD drop just because of the jump buffs."
ffxiv,3e00f6,ewisnes,0,Mon Jul 20 22:44:01 2015 UTC,"Not so if you're missing a lot of your positionals. (this shouldn't ever happen realistically, but there is a hefty DPS loss) Every single weapon skill DRG gets has more than 100 potency which is what you do if you miss a 4th combo positional.  Don't assume this is totally correct, but here's how I see it.  You lose 190 Potency for missing a positional. Geirskogul has 200 potency.  The current ideal situation is 3 geirskoguls a minute, which is 600 potency. A 4th combo with 0 skill speed would ideally be used every 5 GCD's, or 12.5 seconds. That's 4.8 fourth combo skills per minute   Side note:obviously this doesn't make sense in a single minute, but over the course of a fight, this will eventually come out to a whole number, like 24 4th combo skills every 5 minutes  Let's say you never hit a single one of your 4th combo positionals. That's a loss of 190 potency 4.8 times a minute, or 912 potency a minute. This is much higher than the 600 potency you gain by using 3 Geirskoguls per minute. Now let's add in the damage gains from Jump and Spineshatter Dive.  Jump and SSD gain 30% damage from BotD. This is around 60 potency for Jump and 51 potency for SSD. 2 Jumps and 1 SSD per minute would come out to a gain of 171 potency, which still only pushes the gain to 771 potency vs a loss of 912 or around a 15.5% loss in DPS.  You can turn this into a net DPS gain by landing at least 0.74 4th combo positionals per minute (or 4 every 5 minutes) so it is trivial to assume you'd lose DPS by holding it, but there is a situation that exists.  Sorry to bother you again /u/tenshinaito but does this all pan out?"

ffxiv,3e1dho,gshurik,7,Tue Jul 21 06:06:42 2015 UTC,"If you're tank and:  1) You established hate quickly  2) You held hate  3) You stayed alive  4) You did DPS that wasn't totally embarassing (basically you managed #2 against a not-drunk DPS)  Then you didn't make a mistake, period, end of story.  To answer the title question, though, provoke is really only useful for tank swaps and pulls from further distance than shield lob/tomahawk/whatever-the-drk-equivalent-is range. Or for some extra oomph in snap-hate generation, since there's a delay between attacking and it generation hate from that attack which you can delay by weaving in a provoke after landing the combo action and the combo action ""registering"". This was really critical in T13 (unless you managed to get used to the pre-flash timing), but not needed in the slightest elsewhere unless you sorta messed up."
ffxiv,3e1dho,kllrnohj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:21:23 2015 UTC,"Well. As soon as he landed, I hit provoke    Good, the copy cat has the same enmity level like the main boss so you pretty much copied the MTs enmity.   I was told off for pulling with provoke by the Paladin   So the paladin was a ""DUHH Provoke only creats 1 enmity point you are soooo baaaad"" and clearly HE was the douch not knowing about the enmity of the twin.   Can anyone please provide some clarification?   You did your job, the Paladin didnt. Its always easy to blame others if you dont know whats going on.  You always have some people who think they are MLG Elite and know how thinks work but clearly dont. Ignore them and move on.  Those are the same baddies who always blame healers for anything because everyone died, not understanding that all peops got cleaved to death."
ffxiv,3e1dho,AndrosRed,2,Tue Jul 21 05:29:55 2015 UTC,I actually didn't realize that 0.5 carries the same threat table until I off-tanked myself. Sounds like the paladin just had main tank syndrome.
ffxiv,3e1dho,SovietBrainPill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can't even get aggro on it without a whooooole lot of work by which time it's stacked itself right up. I tried it to see exactly what threat was on there, and it's a lot. (Presumably an exact copy :D) Also as aside, even if that wasn't true he was still wrong. if you're going to be tanking something/establishing threat quickly there's literally no reason not to throw down a Provoke because it's not on your GCD and it comes back up in 40s anyways (but you're not even gonna need it because losing hate is not a problem after the first combo lands.) It has markedly longer range if you're approaching from a distance or you can't actually get that far (T7 P2 adds for example), and it's good because you can use it immediately so you're not camping waiting for your GCD to come back around for too long just so that it's up: plus it can counter/negate a healing tick and allow DPS to just go hit things sooner more safely before you get that GCD skill on it. AND not to mention its a ranged thing that doesn't require you to break combo.  {Can I have it?}{Yes, please.}"
ffxiv,3e1dho,hy3gon,2,Tue Jul 21 05:47:19 2015 UTC,"You need provoke. It has the exact same enmity on the MT, which is why most groups pull the oppressor to the far corner away from the spawning area, to make it easier for the OT to get 0.5 aggro before it hits the MT."
ffxiv,3e1dho,gshurik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:00 2015 UTC,You could also tank swap at the 0.5 spawn. The old MT then runs across or otherwise to a far enough position and tanks the 0.5 that is already coming for them.
ffxiv,3e1dho,SeraviEdalborez,2,Tue Jul 21 06:26:05 2015 UTC,That's really over complicating it though.  There's no need to tank swap assuming the OT can provoke it as soon as it spawns.
ffxiv,3e1dho,gshurik,2,Tue Jul 21 06:30:23 2015 UTC,"It's not complicated at all and it's less of a hassle.  Or rather, you think it is LESS complicated to voke > ranged attack on 0.5, and watch it pingpong?"
ffxiv,3e1dho,SeraviEdalborez,4,Tue Jul 21 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not a tank main (haven't even got one to 50/60) but I see no reason why you shouldn't Provoke in A1? Regardless of how the agro table works (it sounds like it makes perfect sense to use Provoke because of the agro table), if there's no other reason to use Provoke in that fight like a tank swap, as you say, why would you not use it when it could be helpful?"
ffxiv,3e1dho,PsychePlays,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:44:13 2015 UTC,"On another note: Tank PSA: If you're tanking the main Oppressor, move the damn thing to the other side of the room by the time the alarm goes off spawning the 0.5 so that they DONT get the tether damage bonus, and DONT make the OT drag the 0.5 through the main Oppressor to the other side of the room instead...your healers will appreciate you."
ffxiv,3e1dho,Shadow12000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:46 2015 UTC,"Ignore most of these ignorant replies. The 0.5 does in fact spawn with the same enmity as the MT to prevent shenanigans with single tank methods and stacking the bosses due to their tether. You must provoke the 0.5 to pull it off the MT.  On that note also, people need to stop misunderstanding how the tether on the small adds work. The little adds tether to the first person to hit them with an offensive action, they do not tether due to raw enmity building or healing. They don't tether to random medicas, succors, helios, w/e. And I'm 99% sure that you cannot take that tether off someone else unless that person dies."

ffxiv,3e1dho,Narrlocke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:45:36 2015 UTC,I've had them tether to me as a tank. Didn't touch it literally the only thing I could have done that built enmity on it was the small fixed amount for using cooldowns if that would have even built enmity since I hadn't otherwise touched them.
ffxiv,3e1dho,Talderas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:18:38 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they don't. I've held them via enmity as whm well after they grow big again and the missles are gone and they still did not tether.
ffxiv,3e1dho,dark494,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:14:37 2015 UTC,"In general you shouldn't pull with provoke just because the threat table is at 0 so it wouldn't do anything. With that said, A1 is a special case where when 0.5 spawns, it has the same threat as the main so in this case it's almost like a tank swap."
ffxiv,3e1dho,Kleavage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:44:19 2015 UTC,"Basically just agreeing and expanding on this.  I've heard that provoke makes your enmity equal to the person with the highest current enmity plus 1.  This is why you need to follow it up with an enmity generating move, or else it will go back to attacking the previous target if said target generates any more hate.    So pulling using a provoke on an unpulled mob is silly, since it will only make your enmity on that mob equal to 0+1, while using Shield Lob / etc will make it equal to X (i.e. whatever amount of enmity that move generates, in theory it will be more than 0+1).  In this case he's right to ""pull"" 0.5 with provoke, since he has to overcome the initial enmity which is already directed towards the MT."
ffxiv,3e1dho,rydare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:19:55 2015 UTC,"I do actually have one counter point, but only on a single fight: T5. With the snakes, when they spawn on the other side of the divebomb pit, our tank will always lob/hawk one, and provoke the other, just to have them immediately grabbed and come over, he always follows up by hitting the provoked with a lob/hawk though."
ffxiv,3e1dho,Shadow12000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:35 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of cases where pulling with provoke makes sense...  Provoke has a greater range than shield lob/tomahawk. Sometimes you just don't wanna run the extra few steps if a mob is far away. That combined with how aggro works in this game (mob finishes running to person who just got aggro before running to new aggro target) it can sometimes make sense to:    Get a far away mob running toward you (or a healer) during a GCD or if it's further than shield lob range Keep a mob that just spawned next to you in place for a few seconds longer during GCD to prevent it from locking into healer   As a tank why do I want to make a mob run toward the healer (situation #1)? Well it makes sense if there's one mob far away on a big pull, as long as I can pick it up right away with shield lob or flash/CoS or aggro combo. (Usually on a big pull I'll pick it up with flash because I'm spamming it already)"
ffxiv,3e1dho,Dempf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"Speaking of alternative uses of the skill, I use Provoke to pull anytime I need to make a safe pull, due to enemy patrolling, environmental dangers or whatever. It has like a 25y range or something Vs the 15y of Shield Lob and it's instant, making it really useful for the occasional pull from far away. Followed immediately by anything that generates threat of course."
ffxiv,3e1dho,WilanS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:09:43 2015 UTC,"technically, if you kept your threat directly below tank's threat, it's possible to pull 0.5 relatively quickly without provoke, but yea, you're not wrong for provoking."
ffxiv,3e1dho,Ixsiehn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:33 2015 UTC,You have to provoke 0.5. Your MT was an idiot.
ffxiv,3e1dho,Ritushido,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:26:09 2015 UTC,A1 just like A3 requires you to provoke to peel the add off the main tank.
ffxiv,3e1dho,Keaddo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:21:28 2015 UTC,Besides the fact that you HAVE to provoke 0.5 there really isn't any reason not to use provoke on a pull IF you won't be needing it until its off CD. I like to use it to pull mobs that are out of range of Unmend/Tomahawk/Shieldlob so I dont have to drag mobs around and mess up the DPS.
ffxiv,3e1dho,Time2Play420,0,Tue Jul 21 12:07:58 2015 UTC,"The MT was an idiot, you were right, he spawns with the same threat table as the original."

ffxiv,3e1dho,Alfangel2003,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:50:22 2015 UTC,"I was told off for pulling with provoke by the Paladin (the MT)   Huh? I mean, pulling the boss with provoke does little to nothing, but pulling spawning adds in a boss fight where huge heals, dps, and previous threat meters are going out is another thing.  As for clarification, I do believe they have the same threat table. I notice when he drops he is B-lining straight for the MT, but I have never really looked at the threat indicators right at spawn, just a guess.  The other problem might be that you're playing DRK/PLD and not WAR. It's an honest mistake, and we accept your apology :)"
ffxiv,3e1dho,ovshanevo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:59:11 2015 UTC,"Random question but does provoke have a chance to fail? I've tried using provoke for tank swaps, or just pulling aggro off a healer or something and it just doesn't provoke the creature."
ffxiv,3e1dho,KamenDozer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:40:38 2015 UTC,"It never fails but you should not depend only on it.  Lets say using any ability, spell or buff generates 5 enmity. Doing damage would generate 50 enmity. If someone has 1000 enmity and you have 0. You use provoke giving you 1001 enmity and you would gain aggro for the monster. But then the player with 1000 enmity uses an buff giving them 5 enmity summing up to 1005 and the monster would aggro them back.   These number are for the most part incorrect but using any ability/spell etc. does generate enmity no matter what it does and provoke does give you 1 more enmity rating than the person with highest enmity.  So when you use provoke it is advised to use any other ability etc. with it, preferably an attack. If you are tank use the ranged attack you have (shield lob, tomahawk) if your target is not within reach of other weaponskills."

ffxiv,3e1dho,willibra,-22,Tue Jul 21 14:34:46 2015 UTC,"provoke should only be used to pull in a situation like A1, or in a situation where you know the DPS isn't going to go balls out ASAP."

ffxiv,3e1dho,ryukin182,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:52:22 2015 UTC,Off tank doesn't tank the .5 nerd. You voke the original because the copy will come out and still have full aggro on main tank.
ffxiv,3e1dho,Swag2TheMax,2,Tue Jul 21 05:25:45 2015 UTC,"One of the most important rules to maximizing raid dps is to keep movement to a minimum.  This is to maximize uptime and better enable hitting positionals and maintaining line of sight.  Moving an existing target is the least efficient thing that you can do..  The only time it was ever slightly viable was in T13 2nd phase when people needed all dps on the add ASAP.  And even there, once people overgeared it such that ranged + OT could handle the adds, keeping Bahamut stationary was a surer way to push the phase.  So yes, OT takes the .5 so that dps can keep going ham on the existing stationary target while the .5 is getting into position."
ffxiv,3e1dho,yoyothelala,-4,Tue Jul 21 05:38:19 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstood. You don't move the original until the copy hits the field, but the OT gets aggro of the original and moves when the copy is there, dots are spread if you have smn, and dps switch to copy while original goes south"
ffxiv,3e1dho,Swag2TheMax,5,Tue Jul 21 05:52:04 2015 UTC,"I think I see where you're coming from.. but I maintain it's better to have dps stay on main boss than to have to ""ramp up"" back to their max dps rate on a bee target.  Specifically, the melee.  You can have melee switch targets to the higher hp boss after a jump."
ffxiv,3e1dho,yoyothelala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:23:06 2015 UTC,There's still movement regardless unless you straight up don't split them...
ffxiv,3e1dho,Swag2TheMax,3,Tue Jul 21 05:45:45 2015 UTC,"There will always be movement..   Our job in maximizing raid dps is to keep it to a minimum.  The game forces us to move? Fine, we deal with it.  We use strategies that incorporate a lot of unnecessary movement? Now that's just stupid.  As it is in Normal, the only requirement in A1 is that the 2 bosses are far apart.  There is no specific mechanic that forces a tank to a specific one.  Therefore, the best course of action is solely determined by what will allow for higher dps.  OT voking the main boss means 2 moving targets, which in turn means dps have no option to maintain an optimal rotation until both tanks have stopped moving.  It also means that the MT will have to stop going ham on the main boss which results in all 6 of your primary damage dealers doing sub-optimal dps.  OT voking the .5 allows for MT and all dps players to keep going ham on the main boss, ignoring the .5 until the OT has it in position.  This means that only the OT (1 of your 6 primary damage dealers) will be doing sub-optimal dps in that period of time.  I know that all this happens in a matter of 5-8 seconds and don't really amount to even 5% of a difference, and that such a small difference doesn't really matter all that much for such easy content.  But the people who care about maximizing performance care about that 5% even in easy content."
ffxiv,3e1dho,yoyothelala,-8,Tue Jul 21 05:57:56 2015 UTC,This is why I don't choose to move it until the sirens start. It gives your DPS a better chance to burn through their opener.

ffxiv,3e1dho,Swag2TheMax,4,Tue Jul 21 05:35:40 2015 UTC,Or... just have the MT run the original south and voke the .5 north where it spawns and tank it there. Thats how my groups typically do it.

ffxiv,3e2vz5,StrikerSashi,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:48 2015 UTC,this. always this.  End the debate by having both and change them situationally.
ffxiv,3e2vz5,tinybabyslothdawww,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"Well, HP requirement varies between content. In general, going full Fending + 35 VIT points is a waste.  Your friend is right, though. Not only will you be generating (a LOT) more threat, you'll also be doing more DPS, which will be helping your group.    If you are learning difficult content for the first time, then VIT can be pretty handy, because you might need that safety net if you don't know what enemy moves hit hard.  In content you are overgeared for, or are extremely comfortable with, you can switch out to full STR gear.    As you learn, you can switch out an accessory or two.    Honestly though, even though I am an advocate of melded accessories, unless your group's DPS is lacking, you don't necessarily need to stack strength."
ffxiv,3e2vz5,NuggetHighwind,5,Tue Jul 21 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"I am sorry for going offtopic here, but, please can you explain about the melded acc? I know that new i150/160(?) isn't completely tested, but maybe via example of platinum/ruby in comparison with poetic/soldiery? Why they are better/how to approach melding secondary attrs/what to start with?  I would much appreciate the answer."
ffxiv,3e2vz5,eshwilk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"Melded accessories provide you with a fairly balanced boost to both Vitality and Strength.    Here's a comparison I posted somewhere else earlier on.    Pure VIT - +245 VIT, +0 STR  Pure STR - +235 STR, +0 VIT  Melded i150 - +155 STR, +140 VIT  3 VIT, 2 STR - 147 VIT, +94 STR  3 STR, 2 VIT - +98 VIT, +141 STR    So, as you can see, the melded accessories provide a sizeable increase to both stats.    Granted, these can become quite pricey, so they aren't for everyone.    If you don't think you can afford to get these, then a mixture of pure STR/VIT accessories is the way to go.  I recommend getting a set of both accessories. That way, you have access to whatever accessories the situation calls for.    edit The above stat comparisons were for i210 accessories. So, the i180/i190 ones are quite substantially lower in comparison to the i150 crafted."
ffxiv,3e2vz5,NuggetHighwind,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you for such nice and clear explanation. I have both sets of law's acc's, mostly 180, and some alex drop, but I cant find a balance that suited me well. As for price - sigh good things are frequently pricy. Thanks to some luck as to founded travnarian silk, I think i will be able to afford them.  How to approach melding? Materia 5 is rare and doesnt suit 150 afaik, right? So should I go via strength crafted vit melded or vice versa? And how much 4th tier it is reasonable to try to apply - 3 vit4 and then additional attrs?  Sorry for bombarding you with questions, I am afraid I am too excited to start trying it."
ffxiv,3e2vz5,eshwilk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:30 2015 UTC,"No worries.    Don't worry about grade V materia yet.    Personally, I went with STR accessories melded with VIT, so I don't get any of the Parry stat.   Honestly though, either is fine. VIT accessories melded with STR would probably be the cheaper option, seeing as STR materia is usually cheaper than VIT (At least on Behemoth, anyway)   Melding options   1) Most expensive This one will cost the most, and you will be well over the Vit cap for each accessory. But, this will cap Vit, and will give you more accuracy than the budget option.    The 5th slot can get pretty pricey, depending on your luck. I failed the 4th and 5th slot on all my accessories well over a dozen times per piece.   VIT IV VIT IV VIT IV VIT IV ACC IV    2) Budget Option This is what I personally went with (Because I ran out of money after my 100+ Vit IV failures)    Each accessory will be 1 under the Vit meld cap, so you're missing 5 Vit in total, which is pretty insignificant. You also have a lower amount of accuracy compared to the expensive option.   VIT IV VIT IV VIT IV VIT III Acc III    Either of those options are totally fine.    If melding Slaying accessories, one of them (earrings I think? Might be wrong) cannot be melded with any accuracy, so sub it out for DET III or IV."

ffxiv,3e2vz5,eshwilk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"There's no flat answer in STR vs. VIT. It's all situational. Are you undergeared and doing progression? Go VIT. Are you overgeared and shit's on farm? Go STR. Do you have money? Crafted, and do both. VIT for speed pulls in a dungeon, especially with the average DF healers."

ffxiv,3e2vz5,Zyphxion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"When it comes to threat generation, you can always up (STR) it at the sacrifice of something that might serve you no need (VIT). This is gonna be different per content of course. If you trade off STR because you feel like you don't need the threat generation for more VIT which also ends up being something you don't need, then you're kinda not doing yourself any favors there.  Now with this line of thinking, look very closely at your enmity meters. If you're the one holding the A whiel your meter is capped and you notice everyone else has not even a pixel in theirs, then you just have too much enmity that you don't need. At level 60, you're not going to be doing only Rage of Halone now. While there's no detriment of having too much enmity, you could trade off that enmity generation for your DPS abilities. Even if you are tanking, you're still a source of damage, and that source of damage will mean more than being so far ahead in threat generation. It'll be more than being so high in HP, to the point where healers can't tell the difference between you at 17k vs you at 13k."
ffxiv,3e2vz5,Angry_Robotics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"Hey, I main both PLD and WAR so I can compare them personally. I love both classes and cant choose facorite amongst them. You are both right and wrong in several ways. First, you are mitigating in tank stance the same amount of damage. Pld by directly 20% damage mitigation in shield oath, and War by additional 25% of healthand buff to healing. The amount of damaged hp is different, but percent of full hp lost stays the same.  Next, we have the same amount of aggro generation abilities: 1-2-3 combo and aggro aoe. Paladin is much  more utility support tank (cover, clemency, etc) and more powerful mitigation cds, including HG. War is more dpsy tank. It is debuffing enemy so more centered around this enemy to exist (war's oh shit move requires some enemy to be present). So they are just about different things. As for accessories, i use 4 vit/1 str (ring) for pld for firsttime encounters and the go to 2 vit/3 str for most content, changing it to 3/2 or 4/1 if nessesarily. For war i use 3 str/2 vit for progression and then 4str/1 vit (ring) for almost all content.  But now am looking towards melded acc's, but havent grasped them yet."

ffxiv,3dyssx,resultsmayvary0,9,Mon Jul 20 18:36:59 2015 UTC,Did you watch the video? The warrior has agro the entire time. The DRK isn't mt'ing. The DRK is OT'ing in full dps accessories and never enters tank stance. Likewise the warrior is tanking in dps stance.
ffxiv,3dyssx,heythere96,-5,Mon Jul 20 18:43:39 2015 UTC,"If they're both in DPS stance the whole fight then which one is MT really doesn't matter.  I just saw the DRK taking the damage from the waves (can't remember the attack name) that happen while the rest of the party runs in a circle, our MT does this, though we admittedly do things different at times, so it may normally be an OT job."
ffxiv,3dyssx,resultsmayvary0,11,Mon Jul 20 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"Actually it does slightly. The parry move Ravana does makes it so the MT can not attack sometimes. It is also worth mentioning that during the 1st liberation there was a good chunk of time where the warrior had to disengage the boss to avoid getting a vuln stack, where as the DRK didn't have to."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Tryphikik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:15 2015 UTC,Then that probably accounts for the difference in DPS.  Thanks!
ffxiv,3dyssx,Swordwraith,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"It does matter a bit. 2 big reasons stand out.   The MT cannot attack during the Seeing Moves.  The DRK OT will get less procs on their Stun/Reprisal for parries since the only thing they can parry in that situation is the cleaves, no autos.   I'd say overall the warrior is losing much more dps though due to having to stop attacking during seeing moves and definitely would be higher without that. I actually think would be a hundred or more dps higher than the DRK."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Mikasaa_Ackermann,3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:37 2015 UTC,"DRK is generally not too far behind WAR, and the WAR is giving him a slashing buff. That and DRK are way more TP inefficient.   DRK and WAR have synergy, and DRK will outDPS a PLD as MT. The PLD is simply way more survivable, though."

ffxiv,3dyssx,zenithfury,12,Mon Jul 20 22:36:33 2015 UTC,"I heard that one of the biggest issues for drk right now is tp management and I imagine if you keep the killtime to 4 minutes with downtime included you're eliminating one of the bigger issues drk have. So I wouldn't go yelling that because drk could parse high in this situation that they're completely viable in every situation.   Note, I don't play drk so im not offering my analysis, im just saying be careful before jumping to conclusions."
ffxiv,3dyssx,MrYaah,2,Mon Jul 20 23:22:12 2015 UTC,"^ This nerd has it right.  DRK has some pretty bad TP problems at the moment. But also, they were OTing in this fight, with the WAR MTing."

ffxiv,3dyssx,MrYaah,5,Tue Jul 21 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"How much more proof? Uhm how about comparitive parses and leaderboards in every other fight in the game from a variety of good players with varied teamcomps. The only thing that this proves is that drk dps is good in situations where tp isnt an issue, and possibly mana usage, I don't know how short fights affect darkside uptime, though I bet the fact that this is a downtime ridden fight problably helps with the mp regen.   One overgeared speedkill on a singular fight does not prove or disprove a classes viability in general, it only proves that it is, at a minimum, situationally viable."
ffxiv,3dyssx,zenithfury,-4,Tue Jul 21 03:57:58 2015 UTC,"But you're just glossing over the fact that the raiders did indeed create the situation where it was ideal to bring DRK, never mind that the player himself is good to begin with.

ffxiv,3dyssx,Meno5,3,Tue Jul 21 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"you're glossing over the fact that they've only done it with one fight and you're not comparing it to the parses they might have got with a different teamcomp so we dont even know if an 840 parse on offtank in a ravana speedkill is particularly exceptional or if ppl couldnt beat that by another 60 dps with a different comp. This biased analysis of the facts goes two ways bub, I for one think that my approach of saying ""we need more information before jumping to conclusions"" is a lot more logical than your approach of saying ""This one fight PROVES that drk is totally amazing and everyone should be playing every fight exactly like lucrezia did in this one ravana speedkill and if you dont you're a fucking scrub.""  And yea, maybe that was a bit of a strawman, but you know what? I don't care. I've said what I mean to say, disagree with me as you will. This isn't a scholarly debate at this point, its a forced argument, and I for one feel no desire to continue participating."
ffxiv,3dyssx,zenithfury,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:32:46 2015 UTC,"All I've stated is that in this video, they've found out how to cover up the class' weaknesses with strategy. You're the one who's going, oh yeah, creating the perfect situation for DRK to excel means nothing in the grand scheme of things.  It's fine because there have been more and more parses being posted lately that show that the flaws of the new classes aren't as deep as the good people of Reddit have been led to imagine."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Praesul,3,Tue Jul 21 04:43:56 2015 UTC,"You can't really go as far to say that's dark Knight has no issues just because they have a really good parse in one fight. ravana has a lot of breaks in between phases which removes a lot of TP issues for the dark Knight. The problem will become way more apparent when the fights become longer and with less breaks. Killing shit really fast is not really a ""strategy"". At some point SE will need to look at dark Knight's TP usage and fix it because it is a huge problem. That is not to say that dark Knight is a bad class, it just needs a few tweaks."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Latase,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:01 2015 UTC,"It goes to show that SE is very cautious about tweaking the class because they haven't seen enough people play the class to peak performance. So the way I see it, if too many people find the class too demanding compared to others, then they will ease some aspects of it, just like how they did with BRD and MCH, and DRG positionals.  And I don't agree that they didn't use strategy. Look at the way they handled Supanarkha. Clearly they maximized uptime on Ravana despite the big pushback and Roses. Meanwhile in Mediocreland, you still get the one person who runs the other way when told the direction is clockwise or counter clockwise."

If you have a class that has 1 spell that hits for 100k but has a 3 minute recast time they're only going to do 555 dps.

ffxiv,3dyssx,raelys,0,Tue Jul 21 07:24:55 2015 UTC,"Most of the time where he takes extra damage is when he's in offensive optimization, which, shortly after, he'll jump and do something (liberation, swift liberation, final liberation). Since the dots don't tick when he jumps, refreshing them doesn't do much since a vast majority of the enhanced damage isn't damaging him. You can tri-disaster just before he changes to defensive optimization to do extra damage, but that'll likely throw off your dreadwurm trance rhythm, and I'm not sure if its a lot better than just using it with DT after defensive wears off."
ffxiv,3dyssx,cartoonhero42,0,Tue Jul 21 07:43:34 2015 UTC,"You'd still get to reapply and contagion scorpion phase dots right before he switches to defense stance, which is a huge advantage, as well as ignoring the ganas, which was always SMN's weak point in the fight.

ffxiv,3dyssx,IbsenSmash,23,Mon Jul 20 18:16:02 2015 UTC,Good Healer DPS is made possible by a good team taking the minimum amount of damage.  People taking unnecessary damage can  demand that a healer stops dpsing and keep noobs healthy.  Teamwork hoooo!
ffxiv,3dyssx,shuopao,13,Mon Jul 20 19:58:24 2015 UTC,The funny thing is that they soak a ton of mechanics in that kill video just to squeeze out more damage and the whm still does a ton of damage.
ffxiv,3dyssx,behemothkiller,8,Mon Jul 20 20:46:53 2015 UTC,This is reddit.  I'm not gonna read an article or watch a video before commenting on it with authority.
ffxiv,3dyssx,shuopao,2,Mon Jul 20 20:54:55 2015 UTC,Those HPS numbers are insane - less than 900 HPS total. They barely have to heal at all. I'm assuming most of that is due to not eating extra damage as that really adds up fast.
ffxiv,3dyssx,behemothkiller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:57 2015 UTC,Other than doing spreading when Ravana is untargetable they eat 'extra' damage to push phases faster.
ffxiv,3dyssx,shuopao,2,Tue Jul 21 11:43:19 2015 UTC,"The might well be, but the HPS from the parse is still insanely low compared to anything I've seen done at 60. Heck, that HPS wouldn't even cut it in Odin back at 50 (though, to be fair, that was both a moderately high damage fight and people loved to eat as much damage as they could, but it took about 2000 HPS to clear in duty finder - we're less than half that here)"
ffxiv,3dyssx,behemothkiller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"Yes the healing is low because they basically dps hard enough to skip a ton of the fight. Look at how long they're left at low hp, they basically aren't healing at all outside of untargetable phases."
ffxiv,3dyssx,shuopao,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"Making a fight shorter reduces the total healing; it doesn't reduce the required HPS except that you don't need to heal the damage once the fight ends, so the shorter a fight is the larger the percentage of damage that can be ignored. Ultimately the main driver of HPS is damage taken and overhealing. Since a large amount of healing for the majority of the fight is Selene (... assuming Selene here for the speed buff, but could be Eos for the AoE regen) and people are essentially never at 100% there's very little overhealing.  This latter part is also where skill is critical - knowing when people can be left low. I scare my tanks in dungeons as I love to let them get very low (like last night, after they drop to 10% in a fight they'll comment ""cleric stance"" and I just respond ""yup! it's on""), but I'll often have fairly high overhealing playing it safe when there's lots of damage and I don't trust people to use their CDs or not to stand in the fire (... eg, duty finder)"
ffxiv,3dyssx,camilladilla,6,Tue Jul 21 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what point you're trying to make contrary to what I said and I haven't disputed anything about overhealing or similar.  I just said they do eat the first liberation, which can be avoided, obviously they dodge other damage perfectly, but that all happens during untargetable periods of the fight anyway."
ffxiv,3dyssx,ryalz,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:52 2015 UTC,"Not disputing anything, just that more than the total healing being low (a function of fight length + avoidable damage) the HPS is /also/ low (a function of damage taken and healer efficiency)  They may be eating mechanics, but they're still taking very little damage compared to an average pug and the healers are very efficient.  Basically, I'm impressed."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Loxain,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah this absolutely boggles my mind since I'm generally left solo healing as well in my group, but in order to keep up with damage output I have to sacrifice most if not all of my DPS. Holy cow, I really need to step up my game."
ffxiv,3dyssx,MagicSchoolHussy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:03 2015 UTC,people taking minimal damage also helps. dont feel too bad lol
ffxiv,3dyssx,dem0nicang3ll,25,Mon Jul 20 21:13:04 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that the only healing the SCH is doing is fairy + an occasional Lustrate, so it is no surprise that the WHM puts out good numbers since his/her overhealing is much lower than normal."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Evane7,6,Mon Jul 20 19:20:28 2015 UTC,"I know I spent half the video watching to see how much the whm was dpsing during the fight, and then seeing parse numbers for dps and hps. This just makes me want to get better as a whm."

ffxiv,3dyssx,CryoHegemony,10,Mon Jul 20 18:15:07 2015 UTC,"Saddens the devs too. If they create some fight for them, the rest won't even reach phase 2 of said fight. If they create something for the rest of the population, these people would be bored."
ffxiv,3dyssx,_Telomere_,4,Mon Jul 20 23:34:38 2015 UTC,"Most of the high end MMO PVE players do get bored with this game rather quickly to be fair. For the high end PVE playerbase you effectively get 1-2 weeks of content every other patch (6~ months best case scenario).  I got a bunch of high end WoW mythic raiders that I've known for a long time to try the game during the 2.2 era and all but one of them quit within a month of hitting 50 having cleared EX primals and T9.  The catch 22 is that the game doesn't have enough players of this caliber to make it profitable to design the content around, but if they never do design a lot of high end content they won't ever show up to begin with. Unfortunately it's more profitable to design the bulk of the content around the lowest common denominator."
ffxiv,3dyssx,MrYaah,3,Tue Jul 21 02:32:51 2015 UTC,"Holy crap! That bard almost did 1000dps, per second even!"
ffxiv,3dyssx,Snowaeth,-4,Mon Jul 20 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"If a bard ramps up their kill rate at one thousand damage per second per second, how many minutes after launch will it take for the bard to solo A4 Savage if he begins fighting now?"
ffxiv,3dyssx,ZandarTheWeeble,4,Tue Jul 21 00:37:03 2015 UTC,"does he begin each fight at 0 dps and scale up at a rate of 1000 d/s2 or does he continuously scale relative to launch so that if its been days since launch he goes into the fight and starts in the millions of dps, also do we have to account for damage dealt by the boss or does he have a healer who can keep him alive?  If he starts at 0 and doesnt have to deal with dieing and we ignore the interupted casts since hes tanking it (or even better we assume the healer is stealing threat with his op heals and tanking all the damage / healing themselves through it ) he will kill the boss in approximately 43 seconds."
ffxiv,3dyssx,chili01,4,Tue Jul 21 04:05:59 2015 UTC,But bard does 7000dps but not per second since 3.0.

ffxiv,3dyssx,Eejcloud,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:21 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how the drk avoided the knock back?
ffxiv,3dyssx,Phantasmid,-6,Mon Jul 20 17:41:17 2015 UTC,if you get hit with 0 damage you won't get pushed back  I think a stoneskin or an adlo would be enough to mitigate it to 0
ffxiv,3dyssx,ffxivthrowaway03,5,Mon Jul 20 17:46:13 2015 UTC,Crit Adlo by itself is usually enough to prevent knockback.
ffxiv,3dyssx,Phantasmid,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"This may not be generally true anymore - there was a nerf a while back that made hallowed ground and manawall stop preventing knockbacks so taking 0 damage by other methods may also no longer work, but I'd have to go try it to be sure."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Tesseon,3,Mon Jul 20 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"No, it's true.  Manawall was nerfed from completely absorbing 2 physical attacks (which means no knockback) to a flat % reduction based on players health.  If the knockback does not do enough damage to break the Manawall shield you will not get knocked back, but pretty much all of them do because puny BLM health makes for a weak ass shield."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Chiffonades,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"No, I'm talking about an earlier nerf.  During 2.55 it still completely blocked the attack, but we started getting knocked back through the 0 damage - see dives in t13.  You could pinball yourself with them if you didn't feel like dodging, and would take zero damage but still receive knockback.  I'd also HEARD but not seen it applying to landslide as well - so I'm not sure if it's a change to knockback moves in general, specific ones, or nerfs just to those skills."
ffxiv,3dyssx,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"T13 dives knocked back regardless, T5 were blockable.  Can confirm manaward blocks knockback."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Phantasmid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, 2.55 you could manawall landslide still."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Everspace,2,Mon Jul 20 21:57:59 2015 UTC,That was specifically part of the T13 divebomb mechanic where you couldn't resist the knockback.  There was no earlier nerf of manawall.  I was using it to eat landslides right up until the last day of 2.0
ffxiv,3dyssx,Paah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:46:59 2015 UTC,"As I said that's just what I'd been hearing.

ffxiv,3dyssx,Phantasmid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:02 2015 UTC,Depends on the hit and it's properties.
ffxiv,3dyssx,Se7enYearItch,4,Mon Jul 20 18:14:12 2015 UTC,I can confirm Divine Veil from PLD negates Pillars of Heaven knockback if the damage gets reduced to 0.
ffxiv,3dyssx,xKres,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:50 2015 UTC,That's great!  I was worried hearing it might not be possible to prevent any knockbacks that way.
ffxiv,3dyssx,sheepcat87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"While it doesn't negate the knockback, if you perfectly time a plunge you can get right back to the boss right away after the knockback but before you hit the wall. This would require you having it off CD though obviously."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Ferrous_tarkus,2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"I assume he used plunge, I can somewhat avoid the knock back on ninja using shukuchi. Just gotta time it."
ffxiv,3dyssx,AhuraMazdah,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:11 2015 UTC,"I negate the knockbacks in Rav EX and Alex Turn 3 all the time with Plunge. You use it JUST after being hit with the knockback and you'll either cancel the knockback entirely, or slide the foot you WERE pushed back, back to the boss."

ffxiv,3dyssx,Zzz05,2,Tue Jul 21 04:08:09 2015 UTC,"For real though.  outside of that its really just cooldown management, which at first I thought he might be doing something really clever but upon rewatching it very carefully I don't think he did anything to special. What he did was opened with everything except his pot, then when the boss came back down he used ir again and his pot (not sure if this is worth, probably better to save until swift lib because at a 4min kill you're only getting 1 pot anyways), then he used everything again (because rs realigned with b4b and hawks) on the warlord shell, which tbh probably lowered his dps since my understanding is that damage to the shield is parsed as 0, this could be wrong tho since I havn't gone and verified this myself. After that you just wait until swift lib and pop everything again and burn the shit out of the boss.  This is almost certainly the optimal rotation with their phase push timings, because they pushed phase one so fast its not worth attempting to double hawks eye b4b barrage (it becomes targetable 1:10 into the fight, so you'd need another 20 seconds to be able to use buffs again). If you had the time its probably better to not use rs or pot in the beginning then do a full opener burst rotation when it becomes targetable for liberation, Though Im not 100% positive on this since you need to count how many rs and pots you get in this version of the rotation and if they line up with everything, if all of a sudden you start getting shit tier raging strikes or you get 1 fewer it might not be worth even though your dps going into warlord shell will undoubtably be higher."

ffxiv,3dyssx,lipbalm922,8,Mon Jul 20 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"The WAR was tanking... DRK only outparsed the warrior because he had to step out to avoid the first liberation whilst the DRK and melee  just ate the vuln up stack, also the WAR can't do anything about the side parries, accounting for those 2 things they were probably equal on dps.   DRK can do as good damage sure, but it can't tank as effectively whilst doing it, and it will run out of tp very quickly while WAR can go on indefinitely.  DRK is fine, WAR still has advantages."

They had optimal DPS on all fronts which made this parse also very possible.  The warrior MAINtanked. The DRK OT, the only reason the drk was higher than the war. No one ever called DRK damage sucking, they are 2nd in terms of TANK DPS but still very horrible when it comes to real main tanking. The fact that drk was OT the entire time doesn't prove its still a good tank to use in its current state."

ffxiv,3dyssx,lootbox,6,Mon Jul 20 17:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, while Warlord Shell is up, everyone does 0 damage because they're hitting the bosses version of Stoneskin."

ffxiv,3dyssx,Nexdeus,4,Mon Jul 20 23:23:40 2015 UTC,"They probably triggered it as it upgraded, so it got triggered with LB1."
ffxiv,3dyssx,High54Heal,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"So does that give a LB2+LB1 or simply popping it at that exact moment lets you do a LB1, not drain the other solid bar, and leave you with another LB1? I would love to understand this, since the butterflies kick so many folks in the teeth."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Nexdeus,4,Mon Jul 20 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"Let's say you have LB1 bar full, and LB2 bar is about to be full. If you start the LB animation right before LB2 bar gets filled, it actually blows both bars, and since it was started before LB2 was already full, it will only come out as LB1. Had that person waited just a sec or two longer to use LB, it would have been LB2."
ffxiv,3dyssx,High54Heal,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:27 2015 UTC,"Ah. In the video thought it seems like one bar went off and they continued fighting before the other bar finally ticked off. Almost like they used some sort of method to ""hold"" a bar. It looks like the NIN did the LB, so was there a way to do that, or is that just how the NIN LB2 works? I don't see speed killers making such a hurtful mistake."
ffxiv,3dyssx,GageRage,2,Mon Jul 20 19:09:37 2015 UTC,It may have come down to a choice.  1) Do LB just to push the phase   or   2) Do LB to do max damage output  I think in this case 1 was the purpose and not 2.
ffxiv,3dyssx,Shadow12000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"Ah. Say a team was not able to put out this level of DPS across the board. Is there a percentage Ravana can take to push out of this phase, or a certain HP % in general?"
ffxiv,3dyssx,Yevon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:00 2015 UTC,Bloody Fuller activates at less than 30% approximately. On our speed kill attempts we always have it around 26%+ when the boss becomes untargetable.

ffxiv,3dyssx,Yevon,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:52 2015 UTC,"Quick question, as a DRG I am a little confused on how I should be using my cooldowns during Ravana. The DRG in the video is using them during his opening rotation but wouldn't it better to use them while Ravana is most vulnerable?"
ffxiv,3dyssx,kyrios91,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:39 2015 UTC,"no, he saved bfb/litany/xpot for prelude. he uses IR because it comes back up for liberation  as a drg, in most parties you want to burn most of your stuff other than litany, xpot and dfd at the opener (litany at 88%, xpot as his form changes, dfd whenever during prelude) because most of it will come back up for liberation (in case of dfd its better to just save it for prelude) in fast kill parties where prelude is pushed very quickly, some of it won't be back up, so here the drg opted to save cds and pop them around prelude."
ffxiv,3dyssx,ALargeBehr,2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I didn't see they pushed him into prelude so quickly. During my next kill I will partition my cooldowns to those I can pop and still have for burn phases.
ffxiv,3dyssx,Swordwraith,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:04 2015 UTC,Nah just use your full opener during pull so that way you can cycle through your oGCDs much quicker. Sometimes I save BL for Shell if I'm the only DRG in my party but otherwise just start from the get-go. Though I hold BotD during Liberation cast because I'll need it for Warlord Shell.
ffxiv,3dyssx,kyrios91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:58:41 2015 UTC,"If you blow all your cooldowns on pull you miss out on bursting him during either Liberation casts as they fall off before the first begins, and aren't up for the second (they come up in the middle of the channel). Liberation casts increase Ravanas damage taken by a whopping 50%, it's insanity to not hold them the 30 seconds it takes to get to Prelude since almost every normal cooldown will be back up when Warlord Shell is cast."
ffxiv,3dyssx,Swordwraith,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:42 2015 UTC,"Battle Litany alone is a huge boost to your party during Prelude. Saving B4B is also worth it. Also you can ride BotD from your opener all the way through Prelude, and you can crack Shell without it pretty easily (letting it pop up during Butterflies) with only B4B even."
ffxiv,3dyssx,kyrios91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"As I said I used my opener since pull and BotD stays until Prelude. I just don't bother popping it during Liberation. I've been doing it both ways (saving cds until Scorpion and doing it normally) and I don't see much of a difference - I even asked about this in the Dragoon Per Second forum and the top posters there said that it doesn't really matter, including Dervy (the thread's OP) said that she doesn't like the saving cd meta because it just gimps DPS. The only thing she said to hold up is BL but anything else is better to be cycled quickly."
ffxiv,3dyssx,EzioSama,-5,Mon Jul 20 22:47:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and then Aiurily sort of countermanded it with keeping B4B.  But yeah, I imagine it is pitching pennies as to which vuln phase you have B4B up for."
ffxiv,3dyssx,resultsmayvary0,13,Tue Jul 21 02:12:59 2015 UTC,Yeah well either way a good party DPS will finish Ravana after the 2nd Beetle Form. This one is just exceptional DPS.

Places like that largely exist so that the devs have even more options open when it comes time to develop new content and take us to different places in expansions.  The city of Ishgard was visible in Coerthas as far back as 1.0, and we've only just entered it with Heavensward. The world we can explore so far in ARR and Heavensward is barely half of Eorzea, and Eorzea is just one of six continents known to exist."
ffxiv,3e1j93,briarth0rn,3,Tue Jul 21 06:27:34 2015 UTC,"... I just realized.  They said that Sea and Sky would be focus of the first two expansions.

Nym. The Ancient City of Nym.  Calling it now - 5.0 we help the Tonberries reclaim Nym and go on deep sea adventures!"

There's always going to be some areas that aren't utilized, but most of the time that's by design. Leaving open doors and the like, for future content.   Other times, plans just don't pan out as expected and content that was to be released never does get released, thus rendering those unused areas...well, unused."

ffxiv,3e1j93,ItsZant,2,Tue Jul 21 06:57:39 2015 UTC,"That's the most likely way to go, yeah. Ala Mhigo is actually in Gyr Abania (like Ul'Dah being in Thanalan. Some people don't realize Ala Mhigo is the citystate) so that's probably the progression.  The way to access Gyr Abania is through The Black Shroud to the east, so maybe we'll have to go through that unused Garlean base in the East Shroud to get there (it might be like a checkpoint, since Gyr Abania is garlean occupied territory right now)  Then from Gyr Abania we can also use Xelphatol as another region like how HW is split between Coerthas, Dravania and the Alabathia mountain range.   There's also Paglth'an, to the south of Gyr Abania/east of Thanalan, so there's plenty of potential 4.0 content."
ffxiv,3e1j93,RablaAndrews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:17:48 2015 UTC,"I was talking about this with my FC the other day.  Would be pretty awesome to head out to Gyr Abania/Xelphatol in a heavily themed Garlean expansion that leads up to players reclaiming and rebuilding Ala Mhigo and turning it into the major city for the next expansion.  I'm at a loss for what the FF primal theme might be though. HW is obviously going to focus on FF6, and ARR seemed to cover the basics.   I could see an FFX theme with Ixion, Valefor, Yojimbo, Anima, with Mt. Gagazet/Lost city of Zanarkand raid in Xelphatol.   Although I wouldn't mind heading out to Sharlayn either, but I think it might end up being featured in HW."

ffxiv,3e1j93,tecrogue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:21:49 2015 UTC,"well like cataclysm, they overhauled the entire vanilla world and created a story about why it happened, much like 1.0 to 2.0  im sure they will try to do more with the old zones but for now I dont see anything too significant other than maybe doing something with the story"
ffxiv,3e1j93,Hardware_Hank,-3,Tue Jul 21 06:21:30 2015 UTC,"my understanding is that flying is here to stay for future content, not sure if the 2.0 areas will get it at this point now though, it would be a lot of work retooling the areas."
ffxiv,3e1j93,Falazure1,4,Tue Jul 21 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"I'm actually really, really hoping they're planning on opening up all 2.0 areas for flying near the end of the 3.x lifecycle.   Since 4.0 was implied to bring swimming/sailing, or be water-themed, it'd be nice for when we reach another ""2.50/55"" point in time again(whatever patch that is for 3.x), to just shove a bundle of Aether Currents at us to kill time and to re-invigorate exploring in 2.0 areas.   I don't see any reason as to why they wont do this. The system has been made, and all the old maps can be perfectly compatible. The only reason I see as to why it isn't done yet is to force more interest on the new zones created for Heavensward (tho unlocking flying in HS and allowing it in 2.0 zones would have been incredible advertising for non-expac users).   But once 3.endpatch rolls out, and 4.0 is on the horizon, there will be zero reason to hold back."
ffxiv,3e1j93,goneanddoneitagain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:04:34 2015 UTC,"enabling flying in 2.x areas would require almost completely remaking the maps. Currently there's very little in the way of vertical interest (that is, outside of traveling faster there's nothing to fly to, and being able to fly would expose huge holes in the geometry that simply aren't visible on the ground (unless you go out of bounds).  it'd be a lot of work to add flying to the old areas, and while I wouldn't be surprised to see it done eventually, it's not at all surprising that they haven't done so already."

ffxiv,3e1j93,Bladelord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:54:51 2015 UTC,"The old zones (I don't know if you noticed) are not designed for flying. So no, the old maps are not perfectly compatible at all. I'm not even talking about vertical interests. If you run out of bounds from the current maps, you'll see a lot of faux landscaping and incomplete, simplified models. By flying, players are gonna see all that. (And even SE knows they can't have that!)  So, if SE does add flying in 2.0 areas, they've got a lot of work to do.   Fortunately, the traversable areas of the old 2.0 maps are very, very small compared to Heavensward. There's a lot of room for expansion, and there are even closed-off paths in the current maps, providing potential for more explorable areas in the future.  So I wager that SE will add flying the day they decide to expand the old 2.0 maps."

Especially when you can fit the entire explorable region of the black shroud, a -massive- forest, into the Dravanian Forelands map."

Never, ever expect a convenience thing to be added without demand from the players. I highly doubt they'll add 2.0 world flying in without significant request from the playerbase."
ffxiv,3e1zdb,Cloud7896,2,Tue Jul 21 09:51:27 2015 UTC,"SS now affects the potency of DoT ticks. But with only 1 set of gear  we had we didn't have much of  a choice, we do get a Crit Det Chest with Esoteric Gear. And the Alex Normal had Acc Det Chest and Crit Det Legs.   With ruin 3 being part of the rotation SS looks like it can be more advantages than before. At least now we are no longer required to have Flank Melee accuracy and the pet gets buffs from our food."
ffxiv,3e1zdb,ken2pt0,2,Tue Jul 21 09:55:32 2015 UTC,SS is now a desirable stat for SMN. More SS will increase your DoT damage directly and slowly give you more moves in Dreadwyrm Stance. There is also the SS buff that can proc when your pet crits and it work well with stacking SS.
ffxiv,3e1zdb,Blackuya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:56:30 2015 UTC,"I think that the spellspeed buff is nice. You don't run out of mp as much as before, and that was why it kinda sucked, along with the fact that it gave you more downtime between dots so you had to use more ruin/ruin II and it drained your mp. I wouldn't go all out with it until we have better numbers, but spellspeed does increase your dot damage. I see a good increase in dps when my pet crits and i get the spellspeed buff."

ffxiv,3e1zdb,abjective,4,Tue Jul 21 09:55:45 2015 UTC,"I would honestly prefer spell speed in most situations over det now, seeing as det is roughly 1/3rd of what it used to be. I've switched out of pieces that had no det, one point more mind and assorted other stats, and still got a few points of potency. I would put it in the ""don't go out of your way"" category that SS used to be in. My order of priority is usually main stat > crit > spell speed > det, though it's hard to tell whether the extra dot damage adds up to much."

So I doubt the third theory will work for the simple reason no one will ever wear that gear in Western Highlands. It's way too specific. However the minion thing could work ─ so Nandi would get a pair, just like Theda & Zona are, or Croak & Mindflayer, Garlok & Laide etc.  As for Bird of Paradise my LS think it's more linked to Safat's trigger. In french it doesn't talk about animal, but about human screams. Even though the french text cannot be taken as the right one, I think the ""animal"" word in english sounds more general in the sentence itself and could mean the Bird considers the human being as a random animal.

ffxiv,3e21u5,Lancex51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:32:55 2015 UTC,80 tokens @ 50 each = 4000 scrips / 450 per week = 8.889 weeks.
ffxiv,3e21u5,Lancex51,2,Tue Jul 21 10:42:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, my bad, early morning derp.  I assume it's to promote the crafted alternatives which most people will be going for anyway."
ffxiv,3e21u5,Omegamaru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:48:52 2015 UTC,"Hah, all good, been there. It's pretty close, the only piece of gear I have melded properly is my gloves which have Gathering 102 and perception 7, the red scrip hands have gathering 110 and GP+4 so it might be slightly better overall."
ffxiv,3e21u5,Lancex51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:52:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, I was refering to the new crafted versions. So each token set has an i170 version that can be crafted and melded as well, which presumably will be better than the token set HQ and melded.  I think the scrip cost may be lower as well."
ffxiv,3e21u5,Omegamaru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:57:47 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, I don't see that for any of the gathering classes so it must just be crafting?"
ffxiv,3e21u5,Lancex51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:12:04 2015 UTC,170 crafter gear is all crafted.
ffxiv,3e21u5,deefame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:18:53 2015 UTC,i170 tools are craftables from Master Recipe 3
ffxiv,3e21u5,potatex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:29:05 2015 UTC,"It would seem the i170 HQ crafted stuff can surpass the scrip gear, but only with grade V materia and this is assuming the caps are high enough too. Atleast by my estimate, it's more than possible I'm wrong.  So it's basically Time vs. Time vs. Money. Make the materia yourself, invest in getting scrips for a class or buy the materia yourself."
ffxiv,3e21u5,Chaquei,3,Tue Jul 21 10:29:42 2015 UTC,Crafted version is dyeable. Need I say more?
ffxiv,3e21u5,blueruckus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:39:42 2015 UTC,Will definitely be faster to gear up all your crafters trough crafted gear than red script gear.
ffxiv,3e21u5,Soylentee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:23 2015 UTC,"I think that's the way they wanted it? Omni-whatever people could gear up fastest with crafted + melding, while anyone else could take the slow route to scrips. Sort of like you can get faster gear from raiding or take the slow route with tomes."
ffxiv,3e21u5,Yashimata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:34:36 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the crafted gear requires significantly more scrips than the token gear"
ffxiv,3e21u5,dropxero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:55 2015 UTC,I wouldn't know. When I saw blue crafted scrips I nope'd the fuck out of that.  At least fishing is still cool. Please don't screw up fishing SE u_u
ffxiv,3e21u5,Yashimata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:28 2015 UTC,"How do you figure that? From what I understand the crafted gear is fewer tokens. For example, class specific BSM body is 18 tokens vs 4 for crafted body."

ffxiv,3e21u5,Lancex51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:09 2015 UTC,"There's always buying a set from the one crafter who bothered to spend 20 million gil on blue scrips. She's gotta make that money back somehow, y'know?"
ffxiv,3e21u5,Yashimata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:49 2015 UTC,How and why would you spend 20 mil on blue scrips?
ffxiv,3e21u5,catinya,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:58 2015 UTC,I was doing some math the other day on how much it would cost to get scrips as a WVR; each 26 cost somewhere in the range of ~120k. Gearing out just one job in scrip gear + master book would cost about 5 million. The rest of the books would run at about 12 million. Add a few delineations and you could hit 20 million pretty quick.
ffxiv,3e21u5,Yashimata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:34 2015 UTC,I dont think it can surpass HQ scrip gear.
ffxiv,3e21u5,PROBOUND,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:38 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm sorely mistaken, scrip gear can't be HQ. Just like the old Artisan set that was storebought (the gown etc. Not the apron)"
ffxiv,3e21u5,Chaquei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:44:46 2015 UTC,"If you hover over one of the new gear recipes you will not find the tag ""High Quality Uncraftable"" as you do in other crafts that arent HQable.  This leads me to believe that these can infact be HQ'd"
ffxiv,3e21u5,PROBOUND,2,Tue Jul 21 11:53:58 2015 UTC,The i170 ones are the craftable ones. I'm talking about the i180 stuff which is bought with scrips from the people in Idyllshire and ergo can't be HQ'd.
ffxiv,3e21u5,Chaquei,2,Tue Jul 21 12:11:18 2015 UTC,Ahh yes i see what you mean now!
ffxiv,3e21u5,PROBOUND,0,Tue Jul 21 13:09:49 2015 UTC,"What I'm taking from this is that you're going to have to focus on one crafter and one gatherer, until the materials are more readily available to craft for crafter gear anyway.  Gatherers are boned.  I hope this gear lasts a while, because them dropping in Supra and Artisan/Forager gear shortly after the Artisan MH was available just really killed it for me.  If they change this stuff out every 6 months again I'm probably just going to focus on one gatherer and one crafter and have the others at 60 to farm up/craft lower end mats as needed."

ffxiv,3e335w,Blootini,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:14 2015 UTC,You only need to unlock frontlines once.
ffxiv,3e335w,bjjgrrl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"Right. But don't you also need to be a Second Lieutenant to queue? Or is that only to unlock, and then you can switch companies and do Frontlines at the entry GC level?"
ffxiv,3e335w,super_boota,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:08 2015 UTC,You can still queue after swapping. You are Rank 1 pvp and need to grind through allied seals but at least you can queue. I made this mistake and swapped back when I realized my pvp rank goes to 1.
ffxiv,3e32uw,seanhiruki,3,Tue Jul 21 16:10:25 2015 UTC,You should be able to solo easily to 15.  No need for tips unless you decide to take it further.
ffxiv,3e32uw,Tharakis,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"For the leveling part, do the quests, do the hunting log, do guildhests. Use you chocobo to help you too, it's not that much loss on exp and can really fasten things.  For the conjurer, you'll mainly be solo, don't spam heal when in a party and you'll be ok. Don't forget you can dps with cleric stance."
ffxiv,3e32uw,Wokati,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:22 2015 UTC,Holy shit you can? This will be my first time with a Mage class in this game so I actually didn't know that.
ffxiv,3e32uw,Ayrikka,3,Tue Jul 21 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Healers in this game do more than heal.  They have quite nice offensive kits.  Not dealing damage, while healing, even in a raid, is a terrible waste of the role's capabilities.  Learn to DPS as a healer early, because the practice is really important later on."
ffxiv,3e32uw,bjjgrrl,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"Cleric Stance is your ""DPS stance."" Non-cleric is your ""healing stance."" Cleric switches your MND and INT stats, putting all your stacked MND into INT to make you DPS better. Consequently, your heals suck.  Also once you learn the icon for Cleric, you as a tank will know when to remind your healer that they're trying to heal in Cleric, and that's why you died..."
ffxiv,3e32uw,Shadow12000,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"1) Find a white mage friend who has at least learned Holy and DO NOT party with them  2) Go to Central Thanalan  3) Go to the area east of Black Brush Station where a path leads up a hill through some cactuar and bat mobs to a house with lots of various lalafell enemies.  4) At the bottom of the hill, attack each and every cactuar and bat mob while the WHM casts regen on you. Only attack them ONCE so that you get barely any aggro and they immediately attack the WHM.  5) After enough enemies have packed together (i forget how many there are), WHM uses holy, all die. Since you attacked first, you get 100% of the exp for their deaths, plus chain kill bonus.  6) Go up the hill to where more cactuar and bats are, repeat the process.  7) After all of those mobs are dead, the mobs at the bottom of the hill should be respawning. Repeat the process back at the bottom of the hill.  Keep going back and forth between these two spots, do not bother with the lalafell or ants. The exp you earn from the combo bonus tied with the sheer amount killed can get you to lvl 12 within a few minutes. If you're in a high enough level FC, ask for them to turn on Heat of Battle 1 or 2. Don't forget to buy cheap food from vendors to get an easy 3% exp bonus for half an hour, too.  Now you only need to worry about 3 levels."

ffxiv,3dy5mv,D_Tripper,3,Mon Jul 20 16:05:55 2015 UTC,"We're in FFXIV: Runway Edition, didn't you know? The Thavarvian Bustier is selling for (when I last looked) 19.7m. To battle classes money is relatively pointless besides materia or possible BiS crafted gear true, but to any of the other half of the jobs its what they run off of."
ffxiv,3dy5mv,Zalsaria,2,Mon Jul 20 16:19:08 2015 UTC,"/shrug, I just made my Thavnarian Bustier for less than 1 mil.  When people realize that maps sell for 90k and it's stupid easy to farm the silk those prices will come down."
ffxiv,3dy5mv,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"Now it does, sure, but 2.4 the best gear in the game was the I110 crafted. Hq, pentamelded, you could beat out iw and demon gear. I think Dreadwyrm best it barely.  Also, some relics cost over 10 mil to make and meld at the novus stage.   Problem is, people will spend more money on the vanity stuff than gear, so gil has a lot of player value."
ffxiv,3dy5mv,TheMadTemplar,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:45:40 2015 UTC,"And how many people pursued pentamelded accessories for the .002% performance increase compared to the latest raid tier?  Maybe 1% of the entire games population trying to push week 1 undergeared clears?  It's certainly not required for progression by any means.  And relics only cost that much if you were someone who absolutely had to have the ideal stats down to the very last point.  The majority of players compromised for pennies on the dollar as ultimately those extra 2 or 3 bonus secondary stat points were meaningless hair splitting.  There are plenty of players who have cleared all of the content in the game without holding more than 1 million gil, much less hundreds of millions.  It's simply not required.  Regardless, we see crafters shooting for hundreds of millions of gil.  There's no legitimate need for a player to have that kind of money, it's strictly a personal status thing."
ffxiv,3dy5mv,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:19 2015 UTC,They buy their wins in raids because they're good at making gil but not so good at the game itself. This then gives those groups selling wins the ability to not have to do tedious farming outside the raid times so they don't feel like they have a second job.

I still keep it in my inventory. I like to hang out beside the guild now and greet new Lancers.
ffxiv,3dy5mv,arbeh,5,Mon Jul 20 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: Ran first dungeon with 3 new players, we cruised through because they were awesome players. Tank listened to feedback about his AoE tanking and instantly became a solid tank.  Earlier today I was doing Low-Level Roulette on my CNJ to get to lv34 for SS, got into a party with 3 new folk. Two sprouts, but they were all brand new to the dungeon, and they were all friends so I was the ""odd one out"" so to speak.  The tank was a GLA, and I noticed he was losing aggro on AoE pulls. My main being a PLD, I told him he should be spamming Flash when there's more than one mob and use Riot Blade to recover MP if he runs out. He instantly went from losing aggro from the first Cure to holding everything like a stone cold winner.  When we got to the big room in the centre with all the small rooms off to the sides, they weren't sure where to go so I just let them explore and get the map bits done - I was there to level up, I don't mind a full clear for the EXP regardless.  In one of the side rooms, the tank was holding a pack of 5 or so mobs like an absolute champ, but I screwed up by trying to put Aero on all of them so I ended up getting him killed. We got the mobs down and I apologised profusely and made sure to let him know that it was 100% my fault and he was doing his job perfectly.  Truth be told I could tell his rotation wasn't optimal, he was using Riot Blade rather than the enmity-building Savage Blade even though he was at 95% or more mana, but I wasn't going to sit there and super scrutinise his rotation when it was literally the first time he stepped into a dungeon. He held aggro, therefore he's doing his job well.  Anyway, we reach the second Captain fight where she summons the dogs, I let the tank know ahead of time where they'll be coming from and that he should smash the Flash button for days when they do spawn. Even with me more or less constantly healing him, he picks up all of the spawns instantly and perfectly, way better than I did when I was running the dungeon - hell, probably better than I would today.  We get to the end boss, I let them know about the bubbles and what to do with them. We miss a few, but who cares, those adds have no health and again, perfect pick-ups by the tank. DPS burn the adds down instantly and switch back to the boss, no sweat.  Dungeon over, tank thanks me profusely for the help and advice and I ask them how they are finding the game, they all answer ""great!"" and words to that effect. We say our goodbyes and we leave, with me picking up 3 commendations.  Especially considering they were probably on IM or voice chat or some such, I was very happy to get to be their first experience with randoms in a dungeon and that they thought I made it a pleasant experience at that :)"
ffxiv,3dy5mv,Belazor,9,Mon Jul 20 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"I would like to say as a green leaf who just started playing the game last week, the community in FFXIV is the most newb-friendly I have ever encountered in an MMO.   I've queued up for dungeons about 5 times now and there is always at least one member of the group who politely gives me tips if I am clearly doing something wrong/poorly. All of my group members have had an abundance of patience and a refreshing excitement towards interacting with new players in a positive manner. One member even crafted my buddy a full set of GLD gear after he finished tanking his first dungeon.  To all you fellow Gilgamesh players out there -- your positive attitudes towards new players has made me feel welcome and excited to explore the game. This first week has been oodles of fun.

Machinist keeps doing knockback, I mention that it's super annoying; And the guy admits he is basically just doing it to be a dick, and that he's aware how annoying it is.

It was a thrill to fight him though, and beating him felt better than any raiding achievement in WoW to me.   My only sadness is Ifrit is still the bitch of Final Fantasy.

That is exactly how I described this game to other people, the game that puts RPG back into MMORPG. There's a journey to be had here and a place to grow as a character and as a player, there is a sense of progression since you start your character all the way to endgame, whereas other MMOs I feel like leveling is just a boring tutorial and they treat the boring number crunching endgame as the ""real game"" like that's good game design. Here the main story is pretty much the meat of the game from start to finish and beyond, and that main story connects you and eases you in into the real endgame REALLY well, it's a game that provides a bridge between casual content and hardcore content and invites people to cross, not put an abyss between them like certain other popular MMOs do.  Sure there is that hardcore number crunching endgame, and it's done amazingly well with that FF polish, but it has context to it, you are led to it by a gentle curve and every piece of content is contextualized by the main story in some way. When I beat content I don't feel like I got through another meaningless step on a meaningless race, I feel like I experienced something I'll always remember and will stick with me, because it's all part of a bigger story."

Do your daily and weekly hunts to work on upgrading your Law weapon to i180. Once you have i170 gear and your i170-180 weapon, start doing Ravana EX for your Hive weapon (i190).  Once you're i170 on average start farming Normal Alexander for i190 gear/tokens."

Run Fractal and Neverreap nonstop. In the process you'll get some i160 gear.  What I'd do is start saving for your Chest, Legs, or Helm Law piece after you've gotten your Law weapon. If in the process of running the dungeons you manage to get an i160 Chest, Leg, and/or Helm, replace those last. When upgrading gear with Law gear the question you want to ask is this:  ""Is it i160 but I have something that is lower than that?"" If so, upgrade that. i160 gear should be the last things you stat upgrading to Law. After everything is atleast i160, priority goes Chest > Legs > Helm > Gloves > Belt."
ffxiv,3e2pqn,tohme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"Weapon gives you the biggest increase in damage (or healing) than other slots.  When I was getting my first set of gear I used Law to fill in the gaps where I didn't have i160 Valerian gear in. I got a ring pretty early on because you can only have 1 Unique ring on.   Since you can get as much Law as you want, this helps boost your item level pretty quickly. Accessories are cheaper, though, so those can be worth getting hold of first over left side gear as this will also boost item level quickly. If you can hit i170 you can start working on Alexander normal. The quicker you do that, the sooner you can start.  For upgrades to i180, I did weapon first, then body and legs, then my ring (and then bought a 2nd Law ring). Then just whatever was yet to be upgraded and I had the seals for (I don't do the mass hunt-zerg thing)."
ffxiv,3e2pqn,PhettyX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:24 2015 UTC,Start with weapon. It's the biggest improvement to dps you can get.

ffxiv,3e2pai,SirGreplin,3,Tue Jul 21 14:38:39 2015 UTC,"A quick explaination:   DRKs believed that their mana was draining faster when they had HoTs, DoTs, anything that ticked on them basically. What was actually happening was that the client was not refreshing to show the actual amount of mana lost. When you lost mana from a Darkside tick, it didn't update the mana bar. When you gained mana back from natural mana regeneration, it DID update the mana bar. So, if you lost 300 mana per tick, then gained back 150 naturally, it only looked like you lost 150 mana. HoTs, DoTs, etc., however, update the client automatically with each tick. This made it appear like the DRKs were losing more mana due to them, but in actuality, it was just showing them the truth. This is now fixed, so it shows the mana bar going down much more often."

ffxiv,3e2oje,Lancex51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:15 2015 UTC,"Comparing to combat classes is dumb because it's a completely different part of the game. DoL and DoH are way more similar then either to DoW/M. Even with that said, combat classes got Alex normal, Alex Savage, i160 crafted, i170 crafted, Esoterics, PvP etc. There are many more avenues to endgame gear for combat classes than gatherers.   Right now gatherers have i150HQ with melds or red scrip gear (which isn't technically out yet). You can go into Alex and do well with i170. You can go into Savage with i180 and at least attempt it. With gathering you literally cannot partake in endgame unless you have some of this gear which until recently was pretty expensive. You absolutely need 600 gathering and ideally 645 perception as well to have a chance at HQing the legendary nodes. The base stats on all HQ i150 gear is 574 gathering and 571 perception meaning to even do the endgame you have to meld 26 gathering at the very least, and you have to meld 74 more perception to have a chance at HQ.  All I'm saying is an i170 set (just like every crafting class got ALONGSIDE their red scrip gear) provides a stopgap where people can get to i170, do a little bit of endgame stuff and move into red scrip gear if they want to invest time or melded i170 if they have money they want to burn."
ffxiv,3e2oje,Insentia,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:04:28 2015 UTC,"The amount of time necessary isn't all that bad though, in comparision to combat classes. It's not dumb comparing those.  And youa ren'T forced to meld 74 perception. 1st. FC buff 2nd bufffood. AND = you get tons of IV materia out of your quests... it's not as bad as you make it out to be.  Besides, the i150 gear for gatherer's isn't bad to get, if you farm the mats yourself and let someone (preferably a friend or FC member) craft it.  Crying over needing 9 weeks for a set, that is currently the best and will stay so for (probably) longer than 3 weeks, is really silly."

ffxiv,3e2oje,Hutobega,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating for those of us playing multiple tanks going into savage because we effectively get pigeonholed into one class (at least in terms of getting the gear)  If I counted right, you need 6000 esoterics for a full set, not counting slaying accessories. It's gonna take roughly 14 weeks for one full set, then you'll need to get an extra weapon + the left side pieces. You'll supplement with savage Alex gear which is interchangeable, but at the start we'll basically have to pick."
ffxiv,3e2lfi,Samoto_Zama,3,Tue Jul 21 13:57:34 2015 UTC,"The thing is, with the 'in this game we had x and we don't have it here' is usually a quality of life thing. There was a post or thread a little while ago I saw on here where people were discussing that SWTOR has a 'buyback' option for gear that lasts 2 hours. What happens if you accidentally buy a piece of gear you don't need? Well guess what you're stuck with it.  It's also perfectly normal that MMOs borrow things from other games. It's actually a good thing sometimes."
ffxiv,3e2lfi,TacoGoat,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of times people think things are borrowed from other MMOs because they are making associations.   Two people can think really really similar things at the same time and later on one is considered a copy cat.  At the same rate, there are some things that just work and have to go into a certain type of game.  I will acknowledge that SE admitted they put familiar elements in to get the crowd.  That is where the part that I tried to bring 1.0 into my post.  IMO that is where they started bringing those other elements in to bring people in.  1.0 was intended to be a different game that was supposed to grow as you did, but it didn't grow fast enough for people.

Every 20 points of spell speed beyond that reduces the recast timer by 0.01. So with 820 spell speed, the recast timer would be around 2.267 (assuming I didn't do my math horribly wrong)"

ffxiv,3e1y4h,iDervyi,2,Tue Jul 21 13:24:47 2015 UTC,"Yes. The actual formula SE use is ((CRT-354)/(858*5)+0.05), converting to a Percentage.  For Critical damage, change the final value to 1.45 for a multiplier.  Sunny Hirose, who discovered the formula, is or should be working on a write up with a proper skillspeed calculation and other tidbits."
ffxiv,3e1y4h,blinkwise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks! :D  Doing some quick napkin math in excel based on your equations it seems that it would take 1.14 points of crit to equal 1 point of spell speed meaning it seems better to go with spell speed. This is assuming continually casting though and being able to stay in the rotation without falling out.  I was using 820 SS as the assumption basis for the calculation. I had to have around 885 crit to do the same amount of damage as 820 SS.  820 SS is about a 7.558 % increase in dps.  820 crit is about a 6.647 % increase in dps.  Raid buffs and the like will change these like DRG crit up would make crit a bit better. Overall it doesn't seem too different.  Crit also seems to eventually overtake SS though. But that seems to be around 1925 Crit and 1925 SS, which we will never get too."

ffxiv,3e1y4h,asdfasdczxc,3,Tue Jul 21 09:38:49 2015 UTC,That statement was meant that I do not know if the accuracy for this chosen gear will be higher enough for Alex Savage. Changed to fix confusion.

If it still has some time before it's off it's natural cooldown, I end my fire rotation early so I can save it with a B4. Otherwise I lose more DPS by becoming a 2.0 BLM than I do losing out on one or two F4's.  If it's cooldown is already finished and I can immediately cast it again on my next fire rotation, I let it fall off. If swift is up, I try and squeak out an extra fire 4 before casting bliz 3 if I have enough time to."

I guess if you think 10% reduction on the tanks is good to hold for 18 seconds, but you'll probably enjoy those tasty cleaves  Still haven't seen any changes to celestial opposition, which was something they mentioned...I'm going to assume these are just some initial buffs to help with savage, and I am HOPEFUL that they are not the last."
ffxiv,3e1tj9,Anidamo,3,Tue Jul 21 08:36:49 2015 UTC,"All solid changes.  Nocturnal Sect is still shit, though it is slightly less-so with the small buffs to MP management provided by the new Lightspeed and Ewer.  But that's offset by the fact that Diurnal also got stronger with the CU buff.  I really feel like they should've done something with Spear, but I'm very happy with the changes to Ewer, Spire, Shuffle and Spread regardless.  They still need a throughput cooldown.  Synastry, while definitely a good spell as it is now, could easily play this role with a few very minor tweaks.  For example, allow it to be affected by AoE heals and regens, to allow the AST to use Synastry + Aspected Helios as a big, expensive burst of healing on a given target.  Good changes, though I still don't think they're up to par with the legendary SCH+WHM combo.  The gap has been narrowed somewhat now, at least."
ffxiv,3e1tj9,deadmetalsonic,2,Tue Jul 21 08:48:30 2015 UTC,"The gap has been narrowed somewhat now, at least.   I honestly dont think it has. While yes the buffs are all decent none address the main issues most AST have.    Lightspeed is a mobility/mp conservator it doesnt help with throughput its still very situational, id suspect people will pop it more for the lower MP costs over instacasts now.  Card changes cant complain Refresh will always be useful to someone. Shuffle can still draw the same cards so it will just be annoying more often. Collective is still bollocks.   They still lack in Burst healing, Emergency healing, High sustained healing. Selene still brings more and more reliable DPS to the party.  All the changes have really done depending on the refresh amount of Ewer/Spire is made BRD/MCH less desireable if you have an AST. They still brings nothing to make people want to swap out a WHM or SCH."

The CU improvement makes it pretty nice in Diurnal.   Should also add there - Lightspeed also reduces MP costs by 25% while active.   This is a good first wave of love.
ffxiv,3e1tj9,UnscrupulousBadger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:05 2015 UTC,"So does Lightspeed still have it's instant casting effect or it it just a flat 25% MP reduction and that's it? The patch notes aren't very clear.  Also, why swap Royal Road buffs of Arrow/Spear with Ewer/Spire? O.o"
ffxiv,3e1tj9,Anidamo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:52:40 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't make much since for it to be called ""Lightspeed"" if all it did was reduce your MP cost.

ffxiv,3e1tj9,Shaore92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:42:10 2015 UTC,My favorite part about 2.5 sec reduction is that you can throw aspected Helios on the run. I think (just getting my ast up now) it's a little over 2.5 but it doesn't get interrupted fast enough.  Of course it could just be 2.5 and I'm dumb but I swear I remember seeing a cast bar.

ffxiv,3e1tj9,Everspace,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"Mana wasn't really an issue unless I died, or had to res 2+ people so the Ewer change means little to me. TP regen is kinda ""who cares?"" as well. Only time TP was an issue was AoE spam and DRKs. Changing around the Royal Road buffs I'm not sure about, in 8 mans it's probably better, 4 mans it's worse (before I could just RR Spire/Ewer for 30-45s Arrow/Balances, now I have one less card I can RR for the time increase buff, and the AoE buff is kinda shitty in 4 mans). Lightspeed change is AWESOME. Now it's useful for more than SS and hardcasting res. Nocturnal sect still bad, CU still mostly useless, Aspected Benefic still mediocre, DPS still mediocre, potential utility still heavily tied to randomness and even in perfect situations is mediocre (although shuffle change alleviates this a tiny bit).  Overall I'm happy with the changes, but realistically it fixes none of the fundamental issues with the class. WHM/SCH both bring more healing, dps and utility, so why bother bringing an AST? What do they bring to the table?"
ffxiv,3e1tj9,drifio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:52:47 2015 UTC,"TP regen is kinda ""who cares?"" as well.   Tell that to people who beg for a NIN for goad. In our current content there's quite a few breaks, but it remains to be seen how TP intense fights will get in the future.   Changing around the Royal Road buffs I'm not sure about, in 8 mans it's probably better, 4 mans it's worse    The biggest side effect is that you won't ever be munching Spears and Arrows for Expand in 8man. You now have 3 cards that are great for DPS increase instead of 1 and 2 others occasionally.  Shuffle change is pretty big IMHO, as it means you can reroll about every 3rd card rather than every 4th which should reduce the randomness by a bit when you use Spread and Royal Road as well."
ffxiv,3e1tj9,tiranu_abendwolf,0,Tue Jul 21 08:50:54 2015 UTC,"I'll concede the point on TP, newer content might make that somewhat useful, and I'm by no means saying AST is nonviable, just that the main issue it has remains - even given ABSOLUTE PERFECT RNG, which is likely to never ever happen, you still contribute less utility than SCH, do less DPS than WHM/SCH, and heal for less. The changes are nice, sure. But objectively AST is worse in almost every way. Besides TP regen (that depending on fight or class composition might just be 100% RR fodder), AST brings nothing the other 2 healers don't do better.  Don't get me wrong, I love playing AST but these changes will not bring them in line with WHM/SCH."

Hinterlands is definitely no due to the lack of teleports, Sea of Clouds has too much of a level gap between the 2 parts, Coerthas is probably too low level, Azysla too high, so that leaves Forelands and Churning Mists. Both have 2 aetherytes and a good amount of fates. Churning might win simply by virtue of being a couple of levels higher, so it'll last for a larger amount of time."

ffxiv,3e260y,nostalgicBadger,2,Tue Jul 21 13:13:40 2015 UTC,"They can be, but they make crafting significantly more complicated and a bit more RNG-dependent. The basic idea is to start your craft with Whistle While You Work and use Satisfaction any time your Whistle stacks are at a multiple of three. The initial investment is 36 CP, but if you get down to 3 stacks, you'll be up 9 CP from Satisfaction. This doesn't always work out, but one benefit is you're throwing in a few extra steps this way, which means more chances to hit Good and Excellent conditions. Once your Whistle stacks get low enough, you can pop Nymeia's Wheel for what's effectively a cheap MM/MM2. I have my doubts about whether this is actually worth the trouble, since it mostly pays off when RNG is already working in your favor. Heart of the [Class] makes it more likely to work out, but earning delineations is a pain, so unless you're crafting something very expensive and aren't sure you'll be able to HQ it otherwise, I wouldn't bother. The rest of the skills are more or less just worse versions of cross-class skills that can be better in very specific circumstances.   tl;dr Specialist skills can be useful but require a lot of extra effort, and if you already have all the cross-class skills from 2.x, you can probably get by without."
ffxiv,3e260y,Das_Gaus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  I can see the value in initiating a whistle while you work at the start of a craft for the potential CP gain.

ffxiv,3dy6ch,Str1der,136,Mon Jul 20 14:27:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a tank main, and have mostly been PLD throughout 2.0. I also played WAR but my PLD has been more valued by the groups i've been in. I was/am so bored with PLD that i desperately wanted to switch to DRK. I have both it and PLD leveled to 60 with hive weapon and i've taken both through Ravana and A1-4.   I absolutely see where DRK is supposed be, and its REALLY close to being a great and equally good tank to the other two, but there are just a couple of strange decisions they made that will prevent  it from being a EQUAL or BETTER option than the other two. I don't believe this to be a case of ""being played poorly."" i recognize that some of my play of it can be improved by my MP management which is really the only way that a DRK specifically can be played poorly compared to the other two.   to start, compare it to the strengths of the other two:   PLD as MT - Shield Blocking. having a shield provides SO MUCH extra physical mitigation its not even funny. This and Hallowed Ground are the reason PLDs are the default MT in progression (not saying there's no room for switches, default just means the start point).  PLD as OT freedom to use Clemency, Stoneskin, and divine veil the party if they are in need of it and in a different location on the field than the boss.  WAR as MT - if properly played, always has Inner Beast mitigation when needed whereas PLD will eventually run out of cooldowns.  WAR as OT - Easy oGCD stance dancing, incredible snap/aoe aggro with Overpower.  WAR utility - Additionally, this goes as MT or OT. WAR Storm's eye benefits tank and ninja DPS and Storm's Path is unparalleled mitigation and nigh required in hard progression content. Path particularly is next to irreplaceable   Now looking at DRK, the DESIGN seems to be that as a MT it can Parry/Reprisal to reduce damage and be a good tank for magical based fights compared to physical (Dark Mind is a short cooldown and very powerful with Dark Arts buff) and can dual stance both Grit and Darkside to put out better numbers than a PLD mt. Its cool down structure also strongly mimics PLD. As an OT its biggest unique benefit is Plunge which would allow instant add hitting. It, like warrior, maybe even better than warrior, can be a ""set it and forget it"" button for a party on large groups of adds with proper use of blood price, Dark arts, and Abyssal Drain. In terms of party utility, it removes the ""requirement"" of a party having to have a monk for Dragon Kick through Delirium.   In IMPLEMENTATION, however, some bizarre design decisions prevent it from doing well in any of these areas. Consider first that nothing replaces Storm's Path in hard content. NOTHING. So with that right there you have to look at DRK replacing the PLD in a group. What's the point of that though? It does not get the shield blocking for basic mitigation, ok that's fine. but parry overall is weaker than blocking, and a DRK has only one, poor, tool for enhancing parry rate. further, the most interesting damage mitigation mechanic DRK has is a proc off of parry for a class that seems designed to be a magical tank alternative to the more physical PLD. this means in A4 where the boss does ZERO physical damage. ZERO. You will never be able to use Reprisal unless you are working on one of the adds. Further, and i sorta get the aim of this again, but practically speaking reprisal lasts 20s and has a cooldown of 30s. I guess they want it to be a ""targeted"" debuff and not an ""always on"" debuff like Path. But a targeted debuff needs to be RELIABLE (Virus, Inner Beast). They put Reprisal in this muddled middle that ends up making it useless rather than versatile.  Next look at Delirium; yes its lovely now a group doesn't have to bring a MNK. But.....many groups are going to bring a MNK anyway because they still are probably highest single-target in the game and traited Mantra is ridiculously utilitarian for a party in progression. So where does that leave delirium? Nowhere because it does not offer blunt resistance down to benefit the MNK. thus the MNK will always use dragon kick. and all you have is a pointless combo finisher that's only slightly more powerful than an unbuffed Souleater. Even power slash is its own worst enemy. Buffed with Dark Arts one power slash is really enough enmity for an entire fight. That's awesome. But it also means using it is pointless as long as you have the MP to be buffing Souleater. don't have the MP to do that? well don't power slash combo either because you need that syphon strike to regen. PLD's and WAR's three combo finishers? all have a definitive benefit.  Where does all of this leave DRK in terms of party utility? on the outskirts. PLD has Clemency, Divine Veil, Cover, Stoneskin. WAR has Storm's Path and Eye. DRK has nothing to rival any of this.  One more problem on the pile is its TP usage. PLDs can use shield swipe to mitigate tp drain without losing out on DPS or enmity. WARs have GCD Infuriated abilities that give it a break from TP drain that are a DPS BOOST. DRKs have nothing of the sort as a MT and run out of TP faster than the other two which really seems quite backwards on a Tank that was sold as MP management. its an unfair disadvantage to darks, and there is no reasonable way to mitigate it. (spamming a spell like unmend or unleash is not a reasonable way to mitigate tp drain as a main tank as it is a definitive dps loss and hurts your MP).   It sounds like i'm piling on, and the only reason I am is to drive home the point that in HARD content, there is zero benefit to including a DRK right now because it offers nothing in terms of party utility while having wonky job mechanics that make it a poor choice for any tank-work that the two existing jobs offer. DRK is fun to play and can handle dungeons and most current content just fine. I also said at the beginning of this wall of text that DRK is REALLY close to being a great option, and that's because to fix all of this, only a couple of things need to happen.   Switch cross-class skills from GLD/MRD to GLD/LNC - this gives it a second parry tool and fixes any tp problems and adds an extra OT DPS booster benefit. add a blunt or magic resist down to Delirium; give some party utility to the MNK or to casters who may be missing their Foe's requiem if your team brings a MCH instead of a bard and give all three combo finishers some point adjust reprisal to either be a virus-like targeted debuff ability that is always available OR switch the cooldown timer with the debuff timer (20s cooldown, 30s debuff) and make it able to proc off any damage, not just parried damage.  adjust Dark Dance so that, when buffed with Dark Arts, it BREAKS the current cap on parry strength.   None of these are game breaking, hard to make changes, and these four things would instantly make DRK a great tank option, keep it within its flavor, and make it an equal in terms of the discussion about which of the three to bring"
ffxiv,3dy6ch,jacquesbquick,8,Mon Jul 20 15:23:10 2015 UTC,"honestly a lot of my same thoughts on the matter. it's a fine tank, and it's a very fun tank, but it could definitely use some tweaks. reprisal and dark dance are my main issues with it currently. adding the blunt resistance debuff to delirium is something i would really like to see, especially since delirium is dark knight's strongest combo finisher (without dark arts). it would give drk/mnk the same buddy-buddy relationship war has with nin (which i especially like because my wife is a monk main). giving delirium a magic resistance down, meanwhile, would synergise really well with their own kit, on top of boosting the dps of every caster (and ninja)  the cross-class changes in particular are something i wasn't a big fan of the first time i saw someone recommend them, but the more i think about it, the more i actually really like it. i think the main issue and honestly one of the biggest issues with dark knight is that keen flurry is a fucking stronger cooldown than god damned dark dance and without some kind of MASSIVE dark dance buff, it would feel awkward having keen flurry added to the kit   fracture - not even worth mentioning foresight - trash honestly, i'd rather take awareness bloodbath - a decent cooldown, but it loses a great deal of utility in the fact that all of dark knight's aoe abilities are magic mercy stroke - it's damage and i personally really enjoy having an execute skill, but the healing is rarely ever useful especially on bosses, we can already sole survivor adds anyway, and the damage itself isn't really anything to write home about   compared to the options lancer gives:   feint - no, but i guess every class has to have SOME cross-class skill that's completely worthless invigorate - literally ever tp concern solved right here. i've not personally had any issues with tp, but i can see why it might be an issue with blood weapon and in fights with little to no downtime keen flurry - stronger than dark dance blood for blood - potent off-tank dps boost which should be more than enough to put them on par with the other tanks (assuming drk dps is, in fact, lower than the other two, i haven't actually seen any parses). potentially useful in living dead situations as a main tank?"

When I parse I'm pulling close enough identical numbers for PLD and DRK. Identical gear except Hive Greatsword vs Hive Sword & Hive Shield. PLD OT dps is very simple to pull off so I doubt I have much room to increase it. DRK is a little more complicated and I often times forget to keep scourge up among other little things. I expect that DRK will outdps PLD in the OT role. If you do a 3m (180s) parse then yes DRK will parse lower than PLD because DRK goes dry on TP about 135-150s in while the PLD goes dry around 165-180s."

In your opinion, do you see SE acknowledging the state DRK is in and making some adjustments? I don't see the switch from GLD/MRD to GLD/LNC happening, but I can see the other changes occurring quite easily.   I agree that some extra utility wouldn't hurt and could go a long way in making DRK a viable third option."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,jacquesbquick,12,Mon Jul 20 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"thank you! i can't help myself with the word quantity once i get going.  I honestly am not quite sure what to think about SE's perspective on DRK. They already adjusted MCH. they've discussed changes to AST incoming soon. They have not really addressed DRK....at all. I presume they see the issues just like they did the other two, but i am nervous they do not simply because there's been no acknowledgement yet. I think when they start watching groups go through Alex Savage the disparity will be much more evident than it is now (as i said, DRK is just fine in all currently available content).   in terms of cross class changes, there is some precedent for this to a lesser degree when they switched Arcanist's available skills from Thaumaturge from Thunder to Blizzard 2 in order to nerf Arcanist/Summoner. Its the only time they've adjusted cross class, so a whole class swap would be bigger, but i think it could be done. As it stands now Marauder offers Bloodbath, (weak compared to DRK's own self-healing) Mercy Stroke (Sole Survivor, though not an attack, is more versatile and beneficial to a DRK than Mercy Stroke), and Fracture (already gone off about tp issues, no DRK should ever be using fracture). The three options from Marauder the DRK actually has BETTER versions of in its own kit that fit its role more (especially since WAR can use traited versions of Bloodbath and Fracture). That's why i think a whole sale switch to Lancer makes a lot of sense."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,zoofman,7,Mon Jul 20 15:41:15 2015 UTC,"Yoshida alluded to it getting a revision in the same manner that WAR got one in 2.1 during the last live letter.  Take a look at his response to the Living Dead question.    I also mostly agree with you, I main as warrior and also leveled DRK.  I'm currently really disapointed in how it performs as an OT because of the lack of support it offers, the cost of going into grit being a bit too high, and it's rotation being a bit too homogenous due to the reliance on siphon strike.    That said I prefer to use it for floor 4 over my warrior as an offtank due to the timing of blood weapon fitting better there than berserk.  Even if our ninja cries about his storms eye."

I didn't mean to imply its as bad as Warrior was then.  The exact wording was ""This is up for consideration, instead of adjusting this action [Living Dead] alone, we’re looking into this as if we need to adjust the special characteristics for the dark knight job.

ffxiv,3dy6ch,Xendors,3,Tue Jul 21 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"Regarding raid dps:  From what I've heard, DRG is pretty much equal to MNK in terms of single target DPS, and DRG now has raid-wide damage buffs. If there's a fight with really stringent DPS checks, the best way to meet that would be to run DRK/WAR/DRG/NIN/BRD. The trade-off of course is slightly worse MT mitigation for physical damage.  I'd say that for the really hardcore progression groups, having a MT switch between PLD and DRK is reasonable, because most gear is shared and the best weapons in the game right now are easily farmed. We'll see what Esoterics brings, but if weapon acquisition works like Ironworks, tanks are going to going to continue using Ravana weapons while passing the new stuff to the raid DPS."

ffxiv,3dy6ch,rbstr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"To me, it makes sense that Reprisal is there explicitly for fights with higher physical damage. When combined with Dark Dance, you've got moderate parry or moderate damage down the entire time. From a game design POV, to me, it's always felt like Path was there in some ways to be the Warrior's shield block, essentially. With DRK that comes from the combination of reprisal and dance."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,jacquesbquick,3,Mon Jul 20 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"I sort of get that, the issue is that storm's path is not just a benefit to Warrior, its a benefit to the raid in every fight all fight, not situational and less useful and harder to proc like Reprisal, which in a fight like Ramuh or A4 is a waste of a hotbar spot. it might be more a case of WARs being unbalanced rather than DRKs being underpowered. Its the utility again. neither PLD nor DRK can replace storm's path in a progression group. in solo or 4man content sure, but i focused most of my argument on harder content"
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Talderas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:50:05 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with you about delirium, specifically with the drive to MNK. MNK only brings mantra to the table with the existence of DRK. You've already admitted that DRK has higher dps than PLD so the ""dps"" advantage of the MNK is well, less prevalent. If you don't take the MNK you can instead take a DRG (buff brd/mch, party crit buff) or NIN (trick attack, goads) and you'll probably end up with higher raid dps than with the MNK/PLD combination.  People are confusing how reprisal is intended to function mostly because they see what it does and its duration and get confused thinking it's supposed to be like storm's path when it's not. Reprisal is, functionally, the DRK version of shield blocking."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,jacquesbquick,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:43 2015 UTC,"i guess we must agree to disagree. MNK mantra is an exceptionally powerful benefit (thinking back to t12 progression for example and dealing with Phoenix's aoes during bennu phase). I agree a DRG and NIN offer great raid utility in terms of dps, but i'm also thinking that a lot of MNK mains are probably remaining MNK mains, because from what i've seen MNKs are still tops. The problems that plagued them in fights where they lost greased lightning now also plague black mages and dragoons with enochian and blood of the dragon. Delirium IS helpful in certain compositions without MNKs, which is a point for DRK for sure like i mentioned, but with a MNK in the party, its not just situational, its useless; only a filler move unlike the combo finishers of the other two tanks which are all useful"

Just because it CAN clear content does not mean it's ""fine"". Back when DRG had these huge animation locks on jumps, lower potency on some abilities, and was more punishing to play, people weren't okay with it (and they shouldn't have been!) Because it was weaker than its other melee DPS counterpart. Yes, you could clear content with DRG just fine, but it was objectively weaker than MNK, so why gimp yourself? They got the buffs they deserved and THEN they were in a fine spot.    If people like playing DRK then that's okay...so far it's not so far behind the other 2 tanks that it's a huge detriment, but they SHOULD be better!"
ffxiv,3dy6ch,YellowYoshi1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:16 2015 UTC,One question I have regarding Delirium: Wouldn't it be a DPS increase for the Monk to not need to keep Dragon Kick up with a DRK around? It works the same way for Ninja not needing to keep up Dancing Edge if a WAR is around.
ffxiv,3dy6ch,jacquesbquick,3,Mon Jul 20 21:21:05 2015 UTC,"no, because Monks do blunt type damage, and Dragon Kick BOTH reduces a foe's intelligence and increases their blunt damage vulnerability. Delirium does NOT affect blunt damage vulnerability, so a Monk still has to keep up Dragon Kick to maximize their own dps"
ffxiv,3dy6ch,YellowYoshi1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:50 2015 UTC,Ah okay. Thanks for clarifying that I didn't realize Dragon Kick had the blunt resist debuff as well as I don't play the job.

We have 4 classes using slashing, 3 using piercing, 1 using blunt (arc books don't count).  If they made DRK damage type blunt and added blunt resistance down to delerium it would solve a minor problem right there by allowing MNKs to increase DPS by bypassing DK."

It was given DEX simply because there were 2 dps already having STR as a main stat and 3 dps having the same stat (at the time) was too much.  For these same reason DRK damage should be changed to blunt and delerium have the blunt resistance debuff added to it."

ffxiv,3dy6ch,Cyberspacehunter,2,Mon Jul 20 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"As a career monk, if we simply look at group dps, DRG/NIN edge out monk at the moment.  Yes, the new skills can be punishing, but a skilled DRG is going to be close or tied with me for raw dps. Litany is incredible, and any group running a BRD/MCH (99% of serious groups) is going to benefit greatly from DRG. They just bring more dps when played at the same skill level.  Ninja is where it was before HW mostly. They bring trick attack, and if you really need it, the slashing debuff. They also picked up some indirect tank dps buff by use of Shadewalker (This one is almost negligible IMO, but it is there)  Yes, a monk played at a similar skill level to DRG/NIN should win the raw parse off(Fucking barely), but at the moment, we don't synergize well enough with the raid to get off the hook with just being a ""DPS Monster""  Currently, monks are in no danger. We are very valuable in progression for the magic debuff, and Mantra isn't a joke (Affects shields!). Though, as content moves to farm status, we'll lose some value.   It's also worth noting that our new skills are very very friendly to downtime, which put monks in a new place in fights where a DRG would be punished much harder for downtime. Ninja's ramp up remains spectacular, while DRG is IMO punished much much harder than current monk for disconnects. We've also become the kings of melee AoE practically overnight, Elixer Field and Purification are bananas in fights like A2(Presumable savage as well). Yeah, DRG still kills it in AoE, but they have to make some choices with GK(Not even gonna try to spell it), while monk gets to just push out AoE with no real punishment. And Ninja honestly is lackluster in the AoE department.   TL;DR: Might not be as clear cut kings of dps, but Monk is in a good place"

Compare that to the 1200 potency instant heal on a 60 second CD, + Inner Beasts return from Warrior, it's nothing. Especially when that Equilibrium heal can crit you for upwards 10k HP. You could even add Second Wind to the list for War honestly.   And then Pld with Clemency usable only with an MP requirement, which can be sustained through Riot Blade and Sheltron.  Drk just falls behind in self healing as well, even though part of their design seems to be to leech HP any chance they get. As far as leeching HP though, I can say they do shine a bit when it comes to mass mob HP return from DA + AD, but that's irrelevant for fights that aren't flooding you with tons of mobs. And it comes at the cost of a massive amount of MP, our primary resource for AOE threat management."

ffxiv,3dy6ch,Miyuki_Shura,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"So... here's the thing with DRK that I Think makes it useful, and we're going to be using it to start with at least.  removing the need for MNK is a really good thing IMO.  and traited mantra really isn't all that critical to progression, at least I never felt it was.  MNK also isn't the strongest single target at all.  it's on par with NIN, with dragoon eclipsing them both.  so NIN brings the party dmg buffs and goad, while MNK brings damage debuff and healing help with DK and mantra.    This lets us use a DRK as MT, giving us more DPS from the DRK, more DPS from having NIN dps utility instead of MNK survival utility, and NIN goad solves DRK TP problems.    They are obviously weaker on physical fights and stronger on magical than pld.  no doubt about either.  Which I think makes them just as useful and lets you design your comp for your group needs/wants.  In our case we get all the dmg utility from DRG and NIN, while letting the DRK still keep the int down, and solving their TP issues.  it honestly feels like a win-win-win to me.  obviously we still have a WAR so we have no need for reprisal to be constantly useful.  it's just free dmg ogcd for the drk.  a lil awkward maybe, and should probably be changed, but a minor issue if your comp is ready to work with it.  DRK NIN for dmg comp.  MNK PLD for survival comp.  both seem perfectly viable to me, and I believe that's how things are gonna shape up."

Our 10% dmg reduction stacks with WAR so we can have 80% dmg output from a boss which will be great for AoE heavy fights.  I have both PLD and DRK to 60 and so far nothing in the game requires a PLD for it's heal/shield utility.  Granted you could say nothing requires a DRK as well.  DRK is an effective main tank and any prejudice against them is probably just new tanks giving them a bad name.

ffxiv,3dy6ch,jwininator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:39 2015 UTC,"True true.  I wonder tho if the shield's overall dmg soak would equal that of having DRK 10% dmg reduction up for the same dmg.  Atm my crew is leaning towards DRK MT, WAR OT.  Should DRK underperform like AST, I can hop to shieldman."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Ryuraidon,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:45:52 2015 UTC,"-10% int does stack with -10% dmg done because they aren't the same thing at all... However, be careful... -10% INT does not mean 10% less magical dmg, Int is a factor on the dmg calculation, not the raw dmg... So this:   so we can have 80% dmg output from a boss which will be great for AoE heavy fights.   Isn't true at all."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,LunaMana,4,Mon Jul 20 16:22:14 2015 UTC,I think they meant reprisal + storm's path
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Ryuraidon,2,Mon Jul 20 16:29:57 2015 UTC,He's not talking about that.  Our 10% dmg reduction from Reprisal stacks with Storm's Path from WAR.  The additional dmg reduction from the 10% INT reduction is icing on the cake.
ffxiv,3dy6ch,NamaeFF,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:05 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but he's worded it in a way that seemed to me he was talking about something you can full time: IE delirium. Since you can't full time Reprisal, it wont math out to 80% on the course of the fight....  Even still, they stack multiplicatively so its not 80% either... It's 81% when both are up.   Now let's hope you can get a parry proc just right before that AoE :/"

ffxiv,3dy6ch,Stoxastic,3,Mon Jul 20 16:55:15 2015 UTC,"I dunno, after playing a lot Alexander and some Ravana it doesn't seem too bad.  It can deal a lot of damage as main tank, I love holding around 500-600 dps consistently as MT.  So that in itself is nice.  It is a bit squishy, though, and its defensive cooldowns don't line up as nicely as PLDs (my old main) do.  I wish we got a Sheltron/Inner Beast equivalent, I think that would go a long way to ""fixing"" this job.  Something like, change Dark Dance to give a guaranteed parry when used under Dark Arts, remove that 20% evasion garbage (which is so un-synergistic it's baffling).  TP is an issue but at least we have a few magical GCD abilities to kinda fill in the gaps while we play catchup, though I'm sure I've looked silly a few times standing there spamming Unmend/Unleash (when it procs)"
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Zyphxion,3,Mon Jul 20 14:50:04 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you on Dark Dance. DRK strikes me as the king of tank that WANTS to be hit, to retaliate. It shows in Reprisal and Blood Price. And then there's Dark Dance's Evasion bonus which is both baffling and pointless. If it's anything like Featherfoot it'll be unusable on the next raid tier simply because mob's accuracy will be too high."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Sigmakan,3,Mon Jul 20 17:28:05 2015 UTC,"Played optimally I think DRK is actually pretty decent. In the dps department, I don't think they are lacking at all and can even keep up with a WAR if they get the slashing debuff. They do have TP issues, yes, but currently no fights make that a problem and they can always just use unmend if they are running dry (dps loss but still way better than standing around doing nothing).  People complain a lot about the lack of mitigation and its true to some extent but it's not a problem at all at the moment with all current content. Once savage comes out it might end up pushing out DRK but we dont know yet. As of now DRK is actually pretty good in A4 because its all magic damage and you can have dark mind up for every set of perpetual rays.   DRK aoe generation and dps is really strong with abyssal drain (ranged and can heal with DA), unleash (flash with dps), salted earth, and dark passenger. Also with the mobility of plunge, DRK might have the easiest time grabbing mobs from different places, grouping them and aoeing them down. They might have a place in savage A2 over PLD if dps checks are a thing.  Played optimally DRK can be pretty good and on par with other tanks but IMO DRK is quite a bit more difficult to play. If you make one mistake with your mana management it can cost you. They have a lot of cooldowns and oGCD abilities on short cooldowns so there's a lot more buttons to press compared to WAR/PLD, that's a good or bad thing depending on your preference."

ffxiv,3dy6ch,DJShazbot,3,Mon Jul 20 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty much fine, some QOL improvements would be greatly appreciated as living Dead for instance is needlessly clunky. It is not as powerful as Hallowed ground, is not impervious to KB's like Holmgang, it's cooldown is 2 minutes longer then Holmgangs, but it requires a 100% healing requirement because you live for 4 seconds longer?  Serviceable but adds a silly requirement for thematic reason that isn't justified in practice.  Drks are actually fairly good, a lot of people play them very poorly and get trapped by the idea of ""because I can I should"" like when a warrior throws out an IB despite a tank buster about to come in 10s and wastes his mitigation because he couldn't hold it for 4s.  Say Drks TP requirements get pointed out, but in contrast to PLD when off-tanking Unmend still does damage and costs no TP. Less damage then their TP skills? Sure but the skill basically falls into a secondary role in a long fight as on the GCD tp restore. Since Drks don't have natural spell speed its 2.5s to use (2.25s under Blood weapon) which translates to 50 TP back (since you gain 60 TP every 3 seconds). A Drk can hit unmend 3x still doing some damage, get back 150 TP and then carry on, a PLD just has to wait it out.  Some minor tuneups would be appreciated but the job itself is entirely workable in its it current state and it's about as fun as my Warrior if that counts for anything."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,GandalfTheSmall,3,Mon Jul 20 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"It's not nearly as bad as people think. They make some rather strange comparisons in fact.  Take bulwark. Its a 180 sec cooldown for 15 seconds of 60% blocking. With a law shield (what most people have) you block for 21%.   Dark Dance, even without dark arts, is 20 seconds at 30% parry (20% reduction) but i only has a 60 second cooldown.  Dark Mind is basically a 30% damage reducer you can pop on every buster in alexander (outside of a3). Its like a magic only inner beast, always there when you need it. In ADDITION to that, you have your basic rampart and a slightly weaker sentinel.  Paladin cds outside of sentinel and rampart are all basically cross classed, so it comes down to having a shield and hallowed ground.  Yes--these are great..better infact but DRK have great advantages. Their damage as an MT or OT is far better than a Paladins. Their threat is far better than a paladins. Their AOE is incredible (Paladins have laughable aoe). The idea of buffing DRK defenses to be closer to Paladins brings in many issues, given paladins do the lowest dps out of all tanks and aoe tanking boils down to flash spam for 0 damage, or circle of scorn of very mild damage. They are the only tank that cannot sustain a 100% damage buff on themselves, and cannot 'offensively' tank like a war or drk can since sword oaths extra damage is not enhanced by increased enmity while war and dark maim and darkside do perfectly great at multiplying threat enhancers."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,oHykon,3,Mon Jul 20 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"A lot of things have already been said so I want to just bring in the thing I feel is the most important highlight of bringing a DRK:   Highest MT DPS.  You go into a fight with WAR OT and a DRK MT and you may as well be bringing 6 dps. At i180 in full tank gear and a 1:2 strength/vit split I push around 550-630 dps range. And I'm still not that good at the DPS part of the job (Forgetting scourge says hello). I've yet see any MT of the other jobs come CLOSE to that.  DRK has the advantage of almost NEVER having to use its hate combo (which people find to be a bad thing and I don't know why) so it is always using delirum (higher potency) or a dark arts souleater (Even HIGHER potency). Because of this you should always be doing your MP regen combo so the MP management is near non existent.   HOWEVER  The draw backs have been outlined too many times, Living dead is too clunky, etc."

ffxiv,3dy6ch,Wash_Manblast,4,Mon Jul 20 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"I have seen a few really good DRK tanks. Better than most of the WAR/PLD I've been paired with in the same dungeon. So good that I've given commendations (which I usually give to DPS, as a DPS main myself).   The good ones are few, though. I've seen a whole lot of bad ones (e.g., not using Unleash in Darkside because mah MP! and not holding hate at all). I'm currently leveling my own DRK (only Lv 35) so I'll have constructive advice to offer myself.  I think it's the same problem as AST and MCH -- and even with a lot of the new ARR job skills: people don't understand how to play it all properly yet."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,roffleswaffles,2,Mon Jul 20 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping it's mainly just ""weaker"" players not knowing how to handle the class.  But I do understand that people have brought up some legitimate concerns with the class."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Sarria22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"I feel that if there are any legitimate concerns, that SE will address them. Perhaps at the moment they're waiting until more people start playing it at the higher levels to really see how it ranks with PLD and WAR.  On the other hand, I rather take it as a challenge to be as good a DRK as I can in the current scenario. Perhaps they'll change it, perhaps they won't, but either way I'll be ready."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,reiphil,2,Mon Jul 20 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"DRK is pretty good as a MT.  They don't mitigate like pallies, and don't hit hard like warriors. So they wind up in this odd ""someone could be doing this better"" category.  DRK also requires a metric fuck ton of maintenance.  They have to constantly Be managing their buffs and cooldowns to keep all their stuff going. It feels like constantly solving a rubix cube when playing on controller. The problem for me is there doesn't seem to be much reward for mastering the high skill cap. You have to constantly be getting everything perfect only to still be mediocre at damage or mitigation.   They have potential for some sweet synergies like reprisal + storms path is effectively raid wide shield oath. But that'll never happen against a boss that does magic damage, which is what they're supposed to be geared towards.  Makes no sense.   All in all the job needs some tweaking, and like every other new job, it feels balanced for 60, and not balanced for 50 and then receiving awesome new stuff 50-60, and that makes it feel like it's behind the other tanks that have been out."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,deepdrill,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"Having played all three classes (only WAR sits at 50), my assessment is that DRKs are fine, but nothing compels me to pick a DRK over PLD or WAR.  I'm not a big fan of how Parry is incorporated into the skills (e.g., Reprisal procs only when Parry happens).  I think one aspect in which DRKs shine over WAR and PLD is damage against groups of enemies.  Their toolkit is essentially perfect for it.  Throw up Blood Price and go to town with Dark Arts + Dark Passenger and Abyssal Drain spam.  The Vault is an especially fun dungeon to be a DRK in; you just get mobs coming at you and you can go ham along with your DPS.  For this particular reason, I also prefer DRK for A2 over PLD (my main).  One problem is I think their toolkit suits them toward MT over OT, but in terms of general utility I'm not sure why I'd choose a DRK over WAR or PLD.  WAR provides a lot of utility to the team (Storm's Eye, Storm's Path, general DPS) and PLD offers many defensive capabilities (Cover, Clemency, Divine Veil, Stoneskin).  If things go to shit in a raid, I'm not sure how I can help salvage the situation as DRK.  Not to mention, the DRK emergency skill is rather bad."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,LunaMana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"One problem is I think their toolkit suits them toward MT over OT   Depending on the boss I'd rather OT than MT as DRK. Some bosses hit so slow that Blood Price doesn't give me near as much MP as I want to keep things moving, but hit hard enough that it isn't safe to keep Grit off for long periods of time to use Blood Weapon unless the healers are really on the ball."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,sab0tender,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:50 2015 UTC,I wish they changed Blood Price to be a % of the dmg taken instead of a flat amount.  This would balance the use of it vs bosses like Rav and tanking stuff like A2.
ffxiv,3dy6ch,LunaMana,2,Mon Jul 20 19:16:23 2015 UTC,"OP,  DRK functions fine as a tank for all existing content.  It needs some very minor tweaking to catch up to PLD and WAR and I expect that we'll see these tweaks tonight.  It has a major TP issue without support from outside sources (goad, tp song/turret, AST buff, etc.).  It has some odd mechanics that feel clunky, and the cooldown on its 30% mitigation skill is a little long.  In Alex normal it struggles in the 2nd floor due to MP issues as stuff dies too fast and if stuff hits the other tank you're not getting mana back.  It struggles as an OT due to losing out on its 1 raid wide utility skill unless it is MTing.  I'm expecting the patch tonight will fix these 4 things:   Reprisal being tied to parry TP starvation issues (maybe make DAed skills not cost TP or give C&S a 200 TP restore on use) Blood weapon not being usable in grit Shadow Wall cooldown reduced to 120 seconds   Fix these 4 issues and you have a tank that is very powerful and essentially a magic-defensive paladin."

ffxiv,3dy6ch,zenithfury,2,Tue Jul 21 03:46:26 2015 UTC,"In short (since others did a good job explaining) DRK is good, it just can use some mild tweaking. Having one won't be that much of an issue (They are stronger then say warrior 2.1) so as far as it goes unless you are doing top end raiding (aka going for firsts) I'd say you won't likely find an issue that will make having DRK that detrimental to have a very noticeable issue.   The only one I can see is having to DPS, but that issue I feel is more about war being so strong compared to not just DRK but also PLD."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Moophius,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:21 2015 UTC,"I'm a WAR main that's leveling DRK while I wait for my static to catch up. She's currently at 54; so, I have the majority of the kit aside from Carve and Spit and Abyssal Drain.    They're a good tank, but the other tanks bring more to the table. In terms of raid utility, DRK brings Delirium and Reprisal. Reprisal only has 2/3 uptime under the best conditions and is only usable as an MT. Delirium is brough by monks. On the flipside, PLD brings a unique STR down debuff, emergency heals and shielding, and Cover. WARs bring a unique -10% damage done debuff in SP and a 10% slashing debuff in SE which is brought by NIN. So, DRK had less raid utility than the other tanks.    In the OT position, DRK runs out of TP quicker than the other tanks while not out dpsing WAR and is not able to use it's raid utility.    In the MT position during physical fights, PLD and WAR both take less damage than them. For PLD, this is obvious, but in the case of WAR, Inner Beast is better than Shadow skin. Shadow wall is a worse version of Vengeance, and Raw Intuition is better than Dark Dance imo due to consistency. WAR also has Equilibrium and Thrill of battle (can be used as a 20% heal).   During Magic centric fights, DRK beats PLD in mitigation, but WAR isn't too far behind.    So, DRK really only excels in magic centric fights as MT, and they fall behind WAR as an OT due to WARs TP management and higher dps. They aren't bad, but they need a little lovin to bring them up to the level of the othere tanks."

The hardest part of using Clemency is finding a moment when my incredibly responsive healers don't have me safe within half a second, much less that miserable cast time.  As for using it on others, my napkin math tells me that that Medica II plus Renew has most folks covered.  I usually just use it when I'm at full health and have popped Veil during a boss cast to ensure the shield is bigger than a Physic.  PLD going to three combos to cycle didn't suddenly make them complicated (my Goring DoT and Rage debuff fall off all the time because I prioritize Shield Swipe), and MP management on DRK isn't as simple as doing one combo twice and a second combo once."

If it's a physical attack heavy boss you need a paladin or a war, drk's do not have the inherit tankiness or the cooldowns to deal with constant physical damage.  Highest skill cap tanking in the game  Drk's get a lot of power out of knowing the fight mechanics; Using Dark Dance to force a parry our of blinding blade, using sole survivor on adds in quarantine, saving your dark mind dance dance until you have 6-7 strum dolls, dropping grit because the boss hits like a wet towel, dropping darkside in TaT because the boss is basically invulnerable for 20 seconds, are all basics. You have to know these fights inside out and are rewarded greatly for using your abilities to the make.  Low return ceiling  Even if you master the top, all your hard work will only reward you with sub-war dps or paladin like main tankiness (at the luckiest of times). You'll also give your healers heart attacks, added bonuses.  You are very selfish  You only have one utility ability that feels like it's there because monks were too prevalent. Deal with it.  In summary (answering your questions):  They are good, not great. Warrior's and Paladins both bring more to the table you bring fuck all, so you are not as desirable. And yes, a lot of dark's play poorly (You don't need to turn off grit to turn on darkside ffs).  They are a slightly inferior tank due to worse cooldowns, but not so much as to make it a game changer (yet). Living Dead has it's own unique sexiness.  Drk gets better each week as more people get off the bandwagon and better study is done on all the class. You will NOT hold a group back like a astrologian would currently. If played correctly, you will be an okay tank. If they fix the bugs tomorrow, you'll be a better tank (my groups whm doesn't use medica II because it tanks my mp). If there are small changes to grit's usability (make it ability plz or 1/4 the cost, it's brutal currently), drk will be in just as great a place as the other tanks (roughly).  Edit: This shits me, but plunge has a horrible animation lock. And it annoys me every time I use the damn skill."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Pebls,3,Mon Jul 20 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"Nailed it. However:   If they fix the bugs tomorrow, you'll be a better tank (my groups whm doesn't use medica II because it tanks my mp).    You may be disappointed. The bug isnt what you think it is.. The bug is actually that the displayed MP is incorrect when regen is NOT present. The correct behavior is when regen is present. The UI doesn't tick correctly when Darkside is on and HoT / DoT are not present, the HoT effect forces it to tick correctly.   In any cases, you have the same amount of MP, no more, no less as the bug is purely UI / Visual.. but when you don't have regen on, you are tricked into thinking that you have more MP than you actually have (on a per tick basis) since it's skipping a refresh tick hiding the tick down from Darkside's MP drain.  The coming fix in 3.05 is going to make the MP UI feedback the same way as when you have a regen on you (which is the correct display) in all cases, DoT or HoT present or not. So asked that whm to regen you, get used to it because that's the real info correctly displayed."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,SometimesLiterate,3,Mon Jul 20 17:07:14 2015 UTC,You don't need a War or PLD if the content is physical. No content hits hard enough physically to make DRK incapable and specifically require WAR or PLD.
ffxiv,3dy6ch,shinigami715,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"I don't get the chip damage comment.  I honestly think faster/more frequent attacks are the best friend of DRKs versus bigger slow hits.  More hits allow for more parries allow more more reprisals...  On Rav EX, for example, i struggle with threat and mp because since Rav doesn't hit often, Blood Price is less useful.  Due to having less MP, i can't do threat abilities such as unmend/unleash that you need to do to keep up with OT wars during Seeing right/left.  Even by front loading with double DA powerslash combos, you're left struggling for MP because Seeing Right/Left don't allow you to keep up mana and you're stuck continually powerslashing over War OT during libs because BB combo is their strongest combo..."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,High54Heal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"You gotta make sure Blood Price is on cooldown during the normal? atma linga phase, since each of those will return mana as well.  As for chip damage, it's simply the fact that while yes, more attacks = more parry chances, but this extra damage builds up over time and makes the dark knight feel less tanky, than say warriors who have their up to 10% parry+ and extra heals or paladins with the shield, and is a major reason why people say ""dark's feel squishy"". It's not really the cooldowns, it's that dark's take more effective (as in ehp) damage than the other two tanks over time."

Drk can also hit war numbers as OT...  ""give healers heart attacks"", if someone does this, it's your own fault, not the class.  Sigh"

SE even said this in the last live letter: paladins physical, drk's magical (lel), warriors damage.  Not to mention warriors have a spammable 20% damage down cooldown....on a 15 second (at worst) timer. I know 10% damage difference can be 4-5k worth of damage at this point in the game, but it's still that war's have near equal sorts of tools for magic damage tanking and then kick dark dps in the teeth.  Also, there's a tank buster in A3? Lel, never knew."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,regollyek,2,Tue Jul 21 01:36:21 2015 UTC,"While perhaps oversimplified, everyone is saying DRK is a PLD palette swap. I mention it because, as far as DRKs 'place' in game right. Now, it seems to hold some water. DRK seems to fall short of WARs single target damage output and PLDs damage mitigation, but has superior AOE damage and some really effective recovery moves. Unlike AST and MCH, DRK is the only new class that doesnt have a mob screaming for buffs and changes. Right now dungeons for both low and high end content are full of new tanks playing DRK, and as a healer main I suspected that DRK was the squishiest tank ever, but at level 60 that title clearly goes to WAR. In capable hands it seems a DRK can perform equally with the other two tanks."

I'm not sure you could consider them ""fixed"".  Edit:   Downvotes? Mmkay. Latest poll had Machinist at 4.5%, with the next lowest being Astrologian at 7.5%. How many Machinists do you see at end-game? I've seen zero in Ravana farms and maybe 2 out of 80+ total Alexander runs. We actually had 3 Hive Musketoons hit the floor because nobody wanted it.  There's no reason to take a Machinist over a Bard utility-wise in raids (maybe that will change in Savage, but I doubt Square would balance a fight around whether you have a 5% damage debuff or not), and Bard parses are typically higher by a solid 50 DPS.  This sub-reddit needs to get over the ""Machinists need to git gud"" nonsense. Yeah, it's a hard class to play, but there's a dozen reasons why it's mechanically awkward, and why the class population is so low."

Bard has just as much ""dat burst"" IMO, I actually find it much more reliable. Wildfire is crit reliant, group reliant, and reliant on you playing perfectly and tunnel vision'ing (i.e., not playing support).  I've got both a Machinist and Bard to 60, have both Hive weapons. Really think Machinists are in a bad spot, but they can't be band-aid fixed. By a wide margin they're the least played class in the game."

Regardless that represents 25% of the damage I did in a 15 second duration. You can than do some simple math  11110/.25 = 44,440 Damage dealt in 15 seconds before Wildfire went off. Now we can include Wildfire in the overall damage and we get  55,550 Damage done in 15 seconds. Giving the MCH a whopping  3703.3 DPS within those 15 seconds.   3.3+3.3+3.3+3.5+5=  18,400.

Party initially asked if we should reform and ""grab another melee"", but we decided to go for it. On the first few pulls, MCH's opener was ripping hate off the MT (they weren't using QS; adding this in fixed the hate issues), and we didn't struggle with any of the DPS checks like stoneskin or ganas.  Of course that's entirely anecdotal, and if we'd had 4 BRD/MCH we'd probably have had issues. But if a 2 BRD/MCH party can get through content, I'm not overly worried. (For contrast, while many people seem to indicate that WHM/AST and SCH/AST can do fine, no one ever seems to bring up AST/AST when discussing progression content.)"
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Dragonslyr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:07:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put so much weight on class population.  Machinists thematically are just not that popular, and tons of people play a class because it looks cool regardless of performance.  They were the absolute lowest interest class in the pre-heavensward polls before anyone knew anything about them mechanically.  And now they have a bad rep because of all the trash talking about them since launch, so even if they're fixed they're still going to have a ""lolmch"" stigma to slowly overcome.  Are there issues?  I'm sure there are.  All three of the new jobs still need some tuning and all three were billed as ""advanced jobs with much higher skill ceilings"" which is exactly what we're seeing.  There's also a history of BRD players that continue to stick with BRD instead of switching to MCH, which is going to cause a notable discrepancy in population between the two.  There may be no reason to take a MCH over a BRD utility-wise, but there's also no reason to take a BRD over a MCH assuming an equally capable player behind the wheel.  They were designed to be pretty interchangeable."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Deviant_Cain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, DRK is great. It's a MT that does a mediocre job as OT though. It's DPS as OT is at least good, and despite what all the people who only use DRK on training dummies would say, it has no TP issues in the current state of endgame.  As MT, DRK shines right now due to the design of the new endgame fights. Magic tank busters line up perfectly with Dark Mind, making it the best for tanking A1 and A4 if played right. They also excel at AoE tanking, making them an amazing OT in the first fight of A1(While still being a better choice for Faust than PLD imo due to their higher DPS.) A2 is another fight that is seemingly made with DRK in mind due to their amazing AoE.   The only fight where I consider PLD over DRK atm is Bismark EX. There's so much damage that comes from autoattacks, that PLD's toolkit actually shines with their Bulwark and Sheltron. That said, everything does die faster with a DRK instead, so there have been times where I've done it in full STR(my point being I was even harder to keep alive) to make DPS checks.  Like someone said in this thread though, there are too many DRKs giving it a bad name right now. I expect some changes in the future, just so that they have more freedom in designing endgame, but for now, there's just nothing that really benefits from PLD's toolkit over DRK's DPS when all current endgame fights have been made with DRK's toolkit in mind."

Still a bit squishy, and has some serious mana issues on bosses that don't auto attack much, or packs when there's a lot of aoe stuns happening (I hate A2).  I think they just need a little tweaking, less than WAR got in 2.0 but still a little bit.  I'd love to see Blood Price return mana when you got heals as well as take damage.  Make it less than a hit, but still some.  Would go a long way on those fights where you get mana starved a lot."

One of my favorite parts though is the DRK meta of self-sustaining mana-battery and unleashing MP reserves to dish out some nasty-self-healing SoulEaters.

Obviously there are some bad Drk players out there as with any job (especially the new ones). But in any more serious content the Drk hasn't been any harder or easier to keep alive than the other two tanks.  I can't offer much else in terms of actual gameplay but there is a general bias that they are squishier. Whether or not its actually true ( I hear mixed results) they aren't any different to heal for. I'm not a huge fan of Living Dead but from what I understand the pros outweigh the cons now.

My feelings personally playing the DRK are that, while minor adjustments may need to be made, they fit a role in a raid composition different than that of PLD and WAR but while having a similar feel.  The one main issue is that they have yet to fix the Darkside issue with buffs/debuffs of any sort draining MP when applied and when they fall off. While not incredibly terrible while tanking with the proper use of your MP regeneration abilities, you definitely have to use more of them than before the Dark Arts patch - which means if you have solid dps, you will be dipping lower in your MP pool due to having to use Power Slash combo more to keep hate, not allowing you to weave your MP use abilities more often.  Overall, the tank is fine. I have yet to have any significant issue in any content whatsoever. I think they fit a very good role as either MT or OT. Sure, minor adjustments need to be made, but overall, the class is fine and you should play it to your hearts content."

If you're looking for an unbiased comparison to WAR or PLD, I suggest that you don't compare them at all.  A DRK is unique on its own and is capable enough to make its own personality and style without having to compare itself and measure up to WAR and PLD.   They are completely able to do every content that Square has released thus far without any problems. They synergize with every class in this game very well and there really isn't any substantial argument that a DRK should never be in a party with a (insert other class) besides another DRK. Even then, it's not a terrible idea to the point where you cannot effectively clear content. If you're looking to min/max, they pair really nice with Warriors MT'n.

I think at level 50 I use about 30 moves regularly on a dungeon and 4 or so a few times.  It's a lot to learn but it's a lot to love.

Dark knight I feel needs some adjustments including changing the red stink lines of dark side to something else, the animations need to be sped up, and they need more mp freedom.  I didn't have any major problems with drk until I started leveling the other tanks, and honestly I don't feel like there is much top do on dark knight that feels particularly fun except getting knocked back by an attack and using plunge right away.  Meanwhile warrior can triple fell cleave and watch hp chunks just fall off, and paladin can laugh maniacally at attacks that do minimal damage.  Dark knight on the other hand feels like a lot of work and there's never really a payoff,not to mention forgetting just 1 of your many ogcd's could land you in a really tight spot.  Dark knight just feels too situation dependent and requires  way more foresight than the other 2 tanks and doesn't offer anything special in return.

ffxiv,3dy6ch,Muzak__Fan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, this topic again. Alright;  My DRK is ilv 185 currently, and I have used it to clear all content currently in the game that is relevant. This is my experience with it.   Dark Dance: The number one thing everybody is going to bring up, I'm sure, so let's get it out of the way early. The numbers on this ability are terrible - I understand that it is meant to be a low cooldown semi-mitigation but it ultimately offers nothing and, if used with dark arts, is actually detrimental due to it's interaction with blood price. This ability's best use is when you're in an enormous pack of monsters (something that Heavensward actively moved us away from in 4 man dungeons) and tab-stun-tab-stun since it causes you to get a lot of resets. I think this ability needs to be changed - there are numerous creative ways to do it but for a simple way, as is SE's forte, it just needs a number tweak. Shadow Wall: Same cooldown as Sentinel, 10% less mitigation. Fix pls. Blood Weapon: I sort of get what they were going for with this, with dark knights not having an official ""OT stance"" like deliverance or sword oath, this gives DRK some oomph when they're out of Grit. That said, the enormous cost on Grit combined with the rather low (and actually detrimental, due to DRK's TP issues!) benefit of this ability makes it undesirable. Souleater: Yep, I'm picking on this. ~1k hp every 8 seconds is meant to be our inherent ""mitigation"" that makes up for us missing out on block. But the average block, by my estimate, shaves around 1400 damage off an ability and can happen more than once in 8 seconds. Now, Souleater does gain value when one considers that you cannot block magic, so this one is more food for thought than anything else. Living Dead: It's crap. Reprisal: This is one of those abilities that I imagine sounded much better on paper. It's a reward for parrying and provides active and thoughtful mitigation - terrific, sign me up. Only problem is that it has low up time, is unreliable, and sees very little use when not the MT (I won't say none, there ARE ways to get it while OT). Now I get that Reprisal isn't meant to replace Storm's Eye, but with it in it's current state DRK is bringing no halone, no storm's eye, and an int debuff that is already provided, and better, by another job.   That last bullet point brings me to the next point, we've covered what DRK has, but what about what they DON'T have? A Dark Knight lacks any meaningful utility; they strictly do ONE job, and albeit they do it very well, but outside that one job they fall very short of their counterparts.  The DRK is the anti-magic tank, and I get that, but they lack meaningful anti-magic abilities. As far as what is unique to them they provide Dark Mind and... that's it. A ten second 30% mitigation for magic on a 1 minute timer. Is this enough? Not really. It puts them ahead of the pack on fights like A4 where they can Dark Mind every single Discoid but whereas a Paladin can tank A4 and perform well, a DRK can't tank a floor with no magic (say A2) and perform anything above ""okay"" or ""average.""  As someone who is a career main tank, I feel downright OBLIGATED to have both Dark Knight AND Paladin at 60, fully geared, and ready to go in order to fulfill the MT job. The state of DRK right now is that it can stand up very well, but it needs a crutch to do so and that crutch is having PLD leveled as well for when DRK just doesn't cut it."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,ccerr89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:05:34 2015 UTC,"To compound my point, here is a breakdown of the three tanks and what utility they bring:  Paladin:   Rage of Halone -10% strength Divine Veil - 20% of PLD's HP as a shield Clemency - Massive healing to a raid member AND the paladin On-demand guaranteed block Pacification, Silence, AND Stun - though not needed currently, they have every control option available to them. Total damage immunity   Warrior:   -10% to ALL damage -10% slashing / -50% healing (equal buff provided by NIN) On demand guaranteed parry Enormous self heal OR TP regen -20% damage mitigation on demand Enormous DPS output   Dark Knight:   Small increase to parry chance which resets their stun CD Moderate increase to magic damage mitigation at large MP cost Moderate self healing -10% INT debuff (superior buff provided by MNK) (requires the DRK to forego their self healing for 8 seconds) -10% damage debuff with low uptime and circumstantial application   When put into list form like this, it shows clearly why DRK is lacking in any fight not specifically tailored to them."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Thegide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:14:26 2015 UTC,"So in short, what does a DRK need to meet it's two counterparts? One of two solutions: DRK currently does one thing very well, and everything else 'okay' whereas the other two tanks do one thing very well, and everything else good or great. That is the main issue with DRKs, and it can be solved in one of two ways:   Solidify a Dark Knight's place as THE anti-magic tank. If you are going into a fight where a single spell is going to be flung, you want yourself a Dark Knight. Bring the physical and utility tanking aspects of a Dark Knight up a few levels, so they become ""Excellent at magic soaking, good at utility, good at physical soaking."""
ffxiv,3dy6ch,foreveracubone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:22:46 2015 UTC,Now I'm curious what do you think of the animations of DRK compared to other jobs?  We know darkside aura is cringe inducing but I like a lot of the other animations DRKs have.
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Pebls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:45:14 2015 UTC,"Their animations are terrific, their sound effects are also really nice. From an art perspective if we look past Darkside, Dark Knights let the art team really strut their stuff.  Abyssal Drain, in particular, I think is one of the best animations I've seen. Not only is it beautiful and makes a great sound, but everything about the animation makes it very clear what's going on; the orb starts small, hits a single enemy, then spikes outwards into the rest. Even if you had no idea what the ability was called, or what it did, the animation makes it very easy to figure out what's going on."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Vrmillion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:48:44 2015 UTC,"Nice utility comparison list. I've written my own thoughts about DRK before, but reading this made me remember that PLD also has an on-demand silence that the other tanks don't have. And some people are calling DRK the ""anti-mage tank."" It really does need some serious help."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,IbsenSmash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:51:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not usually one to say kill the shark to save the fish, but in this particular instance I realize the reason Rage of Halone is so huge is because nobody else provides that buff; if another class could provide that debuff, it wouldn't be as highly regarded. I think like DRK's standing in people's minds would skyrocket if Delirium's debuff was put onto Power Slash and taken away from monks."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Vrmillion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:00:13 2015 UTC,"As of right now, DRK feels somewhat similar to how WAR felt pre 2.1.  It's definitely a viable tank and, while I don't think it offers quite the same level of utility as the other tanking classes, is far from a weak class.  It is probably the most difficult tank class to play well, and is often played poorly.  Right now, I feel the class is stronger as a main tank than off tank.  From a pure mitigation standpoint, it's weaker than PLD but seems to output more damage in MT role.  The magic cooldowns are unique to the class and we've heard that this will be more important in future content, but there's still the issue of managing big hits with a limited number of physical cooldowns.  RNG is one issue, with parry procing a number of abilties, and Reprisal often not being around when you need it most.  There's also the paradox of how parry works against blood price and can interfere with your MP maintenance.    In the offtank role, DRK can also do a lot of dps, but offers little to nothing else.  Warriors on the other hand bring a lot to the table, such as storms path/eye.  DRK also falls short on being able to take over in emergency situations.  If the MT goes down in a trash pack, good luck getting grit up and threat on everything before your party wipes.  There's no utility like steel cyclone, and there's good odds you'll be out of MP before unleashed does anything useful.  TL;DR  DRK is decent as a MT, and played well brings a lot of DPS even in this role.  As an offtank, it also brings a lot of DPS but little other utility.  PLD is still a stronger MT from a pure mitigation standpoint and WAR is probably a better offtank. DRK is fun as hell though and it's inherent flaws will likely be addressed in time."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,IbsenSmash,2,Mon Jul 20 14:43:51 2015 UTC,"As of right now, DRK feels somewhat similar to how WAR felt pre 2.1.   Gonna stop you right there. Warrior was all but unplayable past Garuda HM. Bringing it into Titan HM or coil was an exercise in testing your healers patience. PUG groups could not handle a war solo tank in Titan even after he outgeared the fight whereas DRK handles Ravana no worse than either of the other tanks at i170+. Same with Alex. Savage remains to be seen but it shouldn't fare much worse in there.   Warrior had 0 defensive cooldowns besides Foresight and Convalescence (nothing in first coil could crit and awareness prevented heal crits so it was useless).  Vengeance was not yet a mitigation skill. Holmgang only offered the chain bind.   Defiance only increased your HP pool. The +25% healing received came from each stack of wrath giving 5%. When coupled with the fact that Inner Beast was a 300% damage dealt potency cure without its current damage shield it made no sense to use IB more than once a minute since you'd get more out of the healers taking advantage of the 25% healing (if you even lived through the tank buster) than using IB when Infuriate wasn't up.   Storms Path only healed you. The -10% damage it currently gives was at the time attached to Bard's Rain of Death.   Yes DRK needs a little fine tuning but it is nowhere near as unplayable for basically all content as WAR was in 2.0. The class would be unrecognizable to anybody who didn't play 2.0."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,ErmagerdSpace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"This, people hear about how WAR was, but mostly no one has an idea since people either didn't touch it then/play with one in their or didn't even play at the time and just go off on what is said by people that did.  Comparing DRK to pre-fix WAR is completely ridiculous"
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Vrmillion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:56 2015 UTC,"What do you think could be done to improve the current situation that DRK is in, in your opinion? The most frequent complaint I see is that DRK is very squishy. Could a larger health pool fix this? Maybe stronger health absorbs?"
ffxiv,3dy6ch,High54Heal,4,Mon Jul 20 14:56:05 2015 UTC,"DRK isn't squishy. While I think stronger health absorbs would do the class well and give it more of a unique identity, it's far from squishy. People playing it just need to realize what a cooldown is."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,braernoch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:55 2015 UTC,When we are main tanking we can spam our health absorb for 1k+ every 3 GCDs.  It is rare that I have to use aggro combo after the first pull so a DRK can consistently heal themselves of 3-GCD combo.  On add phases we can heal for 20% easy and potentially 40% of our max hp when a mob dies.  I think DRK is in a good spot as far as health absorbs go.    I wish we could use Dark Arts spam to reduce CDs of defensive abilities tho so proper mana management was rewarded with more survivability.
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Alphras,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:06 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Souleater is in a weird place. If you're full vit, you only sap for 700 (1100 with dark arts) which is about 4(6.5)% your 17,000 HP pool and doesn't even cover one boss's autoattack. Not impressive at all, even less so if you have to keep Delirium up. With STR accessories you end up sapping a respectable amount, but if you're running STR then obviously the boss isn't threatening enough to kill you in the first place and the lifesteal doesn't really matter. Compared to a Warrior's Equilibrium that can crit for 12k or Clemency which is about 4k on demand with full VIT and can be used on whoever you want, Souleater is the worst of the three tanks' self-sustain.  As for Sole Survivor on add phases, if an add dies then you don't really need the extra 20% HP because whatever was hitting you just died and you won't be in danger of dying.  Definitely agree with Dark Arts affecting more defensive abilities, though."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Alphras,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"As for Sole Survivor on add phases, if an add dies then you don't really need the extra 20% HP because whatever was hitting you just died and you won't be in danger of dying.   As maintank on Ravana, you can drop it on butterflies and heal while MT.  It is nice.  Bismarck weather adds it's nice as well.  We may not be the prettiest girl, but we still get asked to prom."

ffxiv,3dy6ch,LunaMana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:20:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, literal worst case scenario is you can't afford crafted jewelry and you're just using VIT law gear.

ffxiv,3dy6ch,Alphras,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, from my experience at healing them, they are only squishy when followed by the customary, ""Oh shi- I swear I had Grit up!"" They don't take Tank Busters very well, but that is not to say they can't take them! Personally I love it when I get a good one. There is no such thing as a 'loose add' sneaking away from the bunch, because their AoE control over aggro is insane."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,PavFeira,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:06:20 2015 UTC,the paradox of how parry works against blood price   Incorrect.  It's (Dark Arts + Dark Passenger = Blind) + (Dark Arts + Dark Dance = Evasion) + Blood Price that is paradoxical.  Parry mitigates 20% damage but still registers as a hit and restores mana.  It's the crazy high Dodge rate from the above combo that prevents being hit and screws MP regen.
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Alphras,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:59 2015 UTC,"They have some problems (namely TP management as OT and the reliance on parry for one of their best skills), but they are not as serious as some people make them out to be.

ffxiv,3dy6ch,Dichter2012,3,Mon Jul 20 14:47:06 2015 UTC,Solid enough answer.  Do you feel that him changing to a DRK will have a negative impact upon your Savage experience?
ffxiv,3dy6ch,chili01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"From what i have seen up until now, not in the least.  If normal mode is anything to go by DRK will actually be the best MT for A4 Savage (at least that is what i am expecting)."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,syriquez,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:32 2015 UTC,"Why do you think that? I'm under the assumption that, if we go by A4 normal, War MT and PLD OT is best....  Think about it, WAR's toolset for dealing with magical attacks (laser + balls) are better than DRK, and PLD can keep himself up when quarantined... Not only that but with the freqency of A4's tank buster in the last phase, you can inner beast all of them. And since that gets stronger everytime its casted... the last few will hurt a lot, a DRK will be cycling CDs, the War would be Pairing CDs with an Inner beast. Mitigating more."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,Esdarke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:06 2015 UTC,"First, that is only speculation of mine. Just to make sure.  Second, DRK can use a buffed Dark Mind on every tank buster in A4. That is a 30% DR stacked with their other cooldowns. Plus they bring their own INT down.  Not saying a WAR cannot do it or has a especially hard time. DRK is just perfect for that."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,LunaMana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"Granted, isn't DRK OT's TP management equal to that of a PLD OT? The only reason WAR OT isn't in the same boat is cuz they got Equilibrium."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,NamaeFF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"DRK gets to use Blood Weapon as OT, which makes their TP management worse than PLD due to the lower GCD.  PLD on the other hand gets to use Clemency/Stoneskin as OT utility, which gives them some time to breath."
ffxiv,3dy6ch,the_goddamn_batdig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"My overall opinion is Paladin is a better MT because most raids have high physical and magic tank busters, meaning Paladin is more flexible. Warrior is a better OT because they have Path, higher damage and quicker swaps between stances. Dark Knight best fits in the MT position in high-magic damage fights, especially with a Monk  General  -DK brings the Int Debuff of Dragon Kick when a group lacks a Monk  DRK as MT  -Has good, short cool-downs when the primary damage is Magic  -Sustained self-heals; ~750-1k for each combo  -Poor Physical Defensives relative to Warrior/Paladin  -Invulnerability CD (Living Dead) is clunky and significantly worse than both Warrior and Paladin equivalents  DRK as OT  -Good on-demand aggro for single-target  -Plunge (the Dragoon jump) is a god-sent for mobility on picking up adds  -Switching in-and-out of Grit puts you on global, unlike Warrior's Defiance  -Does less damage than Warrior. Period.  -Longer defensive CDs=Less effective OT for quick-swaps or sustained add tanking  -Does not have Storm's Path (10% less raid damage, flat) from Warrior. This is huge."

ffxiv,3e31nk,aSusurrus,4,Tue Jul 21 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"If the devs' line is still ""The people at the highest tier get the best rewards first"" - then this is still in line with that, regardless of the item level, because Eso weapons can't be upgraded until you're beating A4S.  What it does is make optimization on the weapon level possible, which it hasn't been before, because there are now equal alternatives requiring the same level of performance over time."

ffxiv,3e31nk,AdventureBum,2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:19 2015 UTC,"Specific pages drop from specific turns, and are used to buy particular things. The upgrade items are the same;   Illuminati Gobdip == Goridan Manifesto Page 4, x4  Illuminati Gobtwine == Gordian Manifesto Page 3, x4  Illuminati Gobcoat == Gordian Manifesto Page 2, x4   So it follows the same scheme as the Law upgrades, meaning if your weapon doesn't drop from A4S for 4 weeks, you can get an i210 version of the Eso weapon regardless - or hang off for another 8 (total 12) to buy and upgrade the Gordian version.  I'm actually really pleased this is laid out the way it is, it means even if you have insanely bad luck, gear will still be accessible eventually - and the key is eventually.  You can't just get a single clear and get the best items, without luck or a group feeding you the drops. Regardless of someone clearing A4S today and getting their weapon, they still may not be be sporting the i210 version for at least 4 weeks' resets, so even the best must invest over time."

It's still gated behind savage - so any i210 weapon is a savage weap currently.

The 2% enrage wipe was the most painful so far.  I also want all the new TT cards for reasons, but all the new NPC rules make me curl up in a fetal position and cry.  Other than those two speedbumps, I'm really enjoying everything so far, can't want to die awfully tomorrow in Alex Savage!"

That's currently i176 or something I dunno.  Then I leveled FSH from 50 to 60 in just under two days because I love that crazy mess. Gotten full Trailblazers, spent a few million gil on accessories, now just on that Scrip grind for the Folklore Tomes.  Uhh... Arcanist is at 55 as of yesterday. Gotta get that to 60 so I don't need to carry two different sets of Caster gear around. I also played with Astrologian for a bit and I think that's at 34. Actually went back and did some Miner leveling putting that at 25-ish.  Besides that sort of general leveling nonsense... I did the Doma kids story and the Alexander stories, both fun. Haven't done the Elder Primal story quests yet since I haven't bothered to try and beat Bismarck EX yet, though I want to get on that. I've hit moooost of the new Achievement FATEs, gotten some TT cards and Coeurlregina Horns. Just need to keep an eye out for the Churning Mists one and Prey Online.  And then even further outside of that, I've been delving more into the lore side of stuff because I love Eorzea.

But Balmung is also the most populated server so it's hard to get into because character creation is locked most of the time.  If you're not into RP then I suggest joining whatever server you like. You may want to do a recruit a friend with someone too because I think you and the person that recruited you get special rewards. And since you're getting it on PS4 don't forget to get a wireless keyboard if you sit far back from the console and don't have one already. You'll need a keyboard to communicate. You can use a wired one too if it will reach.  That's about the only things I can think of you'll need to know before you start playing.

ffxiv,3e1xrs,Travnia,0,Tue Jul 21 09:33:32 2015 UTC,"Welcome to FFXIV!   Did you try the free trial? If not, it will help you ensure the game runs properly on your computer; moreover, it uses the full game install, so when you'll actually buy the game, you'll already have it installed. It's free, there's no real reason not to do it. EDIT: On PS4 it's less interesting to try it, as you already know it will run properly. It's more about at least being sure you don't hate the game on the first minute :p Do you have a friend for referral? If not, find one, it gives nice bonuses both for you and your friend. (Shameless plug: send me a PM if you want a referral code :p ) Do you intend to play from Steam? If so, you'll have to buy the game / expansions through Steam, which can be quite annoying sometimes. You don't need to buy the expansion to start playing, and you won't need it for a while (not until you finish the story from the original game, so minimum ~100 hours of play if you rush, multiple weeks if you play ""normally""). Read that while installing, covers a lot of the basics in the game.   Have fun!  EDIT: some things I said don't apply on PS4."
ffxiv,3e1xrs,AliceHeuz,0,Tue Jul 21 09:37:58 2015 UTC,"There's only one thing you really need to know before buying the game. If you want to get (and give) the Recruit-A-Friend benefits, you need to enter the code your recruiter gives you after buying the game but before buying a subscription (the 30 free days you get with the game don't count for this). You also won't actually get any of the benefits until whatever subscription you pick comes into effect after the 30 free days have run out, unless you add game-time through other means, like codes from the physical 90 day cards.  I'd also recommend you try the trial before buying it. Even if you don't play the full 14 days, it should give you a first impression of the game and whether you actually want to keep playing or not. You won't need a recruiter code for the trial. The ability to enter a code becomes available in the Mogstation after buying the full game.  If you don't actually want to use Recruit-A-Friend, you can ignore most of what I said."

The majority of the people in our FC are 25-35 years old, and also have jobs, and real life responsibilities, so when someone new joins our group, and starts running their mouth off, it will be handled pretty damn quick.

It's pretty natural though, if you've ever been in a party where most people are in voice chat and some aren't, it's hard to even remember to pay attention to the tiny textbox in the bottom of the screen.

ffxiv,3dyukt,Mere-chan,29,Tue Jul 21 01:43:54 2015 UTC,"I've been a leader for pretty much as long as I've been gaming. I don't know if it's just my personality or what, but I just have whatever it is that makes people tell me that I should put together a group. I'm okay with it as honestly I enjoy the things that come along with a role like that.   It took me a long time to figure out what the formula is to creating a lasting group. I had tried to put together groups that were based around raiding, PvP, PvE, certain consoles, and so on. Ultimately none of them lasted longer than the content did. Once that content became exhausted, we were out and out again and I was left to try to put things back together. I feel like this is where the downfall happens with many groups. They let themselves be about the game, about the mode of play, or about the few people in their clique. Ultimately that isn't ever going to work.  I finally figured out that what truly makes a community last is making friends. If you come to care more about the people than the game, then you'll have a group that will stick together. Fostering that kind of mentality is the really difficult part though. You have to be very careful about how you put together a community if you're trying to make it last for a long time. You have to make an enticing and exciting environment that will make people want to come around. You have to make them feel special to be in the community. The biggest thing is that you just have to make sure that you help foster relationships in the group.   The enticing and exciting environment may seem like a lot of work, but it's actually the easiest part. Making a nice website, good looking advertising materials, well written marketing copy, and things of that nature is not necessarily a cake walk, but for me this has been the simplest part. The second part of this is, of course, keeping people interested. I tend to run a lot of events ranging from things like Bad Movie Night where we watch a movie together and make fun of it, to hide and seek and social games within the community. I try to interact on Twitter a lot with our official FC Twitter. I make sure that our tabletop campaigns are going well, and in general I just try to help provide a framework that makes it easy for people to have fun and exciting things to do in the community. As I said though, this is pretty easy to do if you are willing to put in the effort.   Making people feel special to be in the community can be a bit more difficult. Oddly enough, I found that I had to defy conventional logic on this one. So typically you want to grow your community quickly and get a lot of people in. You would think that a community with a lot of active members is a healthy one right? Actually that's really incorrect. Getting big quickly creates fragmentation. You get groups within your community that don't interact with each other and then there's no sense of connection. Yeah I'm in this FC of 500 people, but I really only know 10 of them and only really care about 3 of them. Instead my co-leaders and I tried to make a somewhat exclusive atmosphere.   We made our application process based on personality and fit. We also made it somewhat difficult to actually become a member of the community. We reject about 80% of our applications, but it means that the 20% that get in feel a sense of camaraderie.  They develop a connection to not only the brand (as they had to work hard to get into it), but also to the other people that had to do the same. It also means that we only get a few new people at a time giving everyone a lot of opportunity to make friends with the new person and welcome them in. We push social interaction early and often and really encourage new members to get into Teamspeak early to meet us and make friends. It helps them feel like they're a part of the community from the start.  Helping to foster relationships is by far the most difficult thing about leading a lasting FC. It takes a lot of time out of my co-leaders, and my time, but it's worth it. Basically what it means is that we go out of our way to be friendly, inviting, helpful, and proactive at developing friendships. We get guild runs together. We push people to post on the forums in social ways. We gently nudge people into being more and more social as we know that talking and being talked to is the only way to develop real friendships. Friendships are what it takes to hold a guild together. You can skate by on the rest, but if you manage to make a network of people that is just irresistibly fun to be around, then you'll have a successful community experience.   I'm of the opinion that, as a leader, you should be there to serve the members. I'm there to facilitate things for them. I'm there to be the guy they can come to for anything and even if I can't help, I know someone who can. It means that often times, my co-leaders and I play more for others than ourselves, but that's what it takes. Making a community last is difficult and if you as a leader aren't willing to put everyone else first, then you're going to often end up with an empty group. Does this mean you can never do things for yourself? Of course not. It does mean though that you have to be dedicated and careful. You have to be outgoing and likable, but unafraid to proactively address a problem in a mature way. It means people have to love you, yet understand that sometimes you have to be the bad guy.   It's a thankless job sometimes keeping an FC together, but when you get the right people and see them having fun and enjoying themselves, that should be your thanks. Knowing that you helped to give them a place to have fun and enjoy their online time together is ridiculously rewarding.   EDIT: Spelling"

It was run by a married couple, the guy was the guild master and the wife was basically the den mother.  She didn't get any special rank or treatment, she wasn't even an officer, but everyone loved and respected her because she was just an amazing person.  Whenever a new person was invited to the guild, the GM always let everyone know a minute or so ahead of time, and as soon as the new person joined his guild chat was spammed with 'OMG WTF' by everyone online.  I never saw anyone that didn't laugh hysterically at that.

We ended up sounding like a zombie horde somewhat.  Now, any time there's a birthday, we purposely groan and moan out happy birthday like a zombie horde. It's one of my favorite things and people make sure to get on when it's a horde night.   I'm so glad you found an environment to be happy in.

ffxiv,3dyukt,Igual_Mente,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"One of my old LSes in FFXI was led by a husband and wife. Our ""sweet"", beloved ""LS mother"" decided to start up erotic role play with one of the LS officers and then they started emailing nude pics to each other and having sexual conversations on the phone and telling people her husband was her ""ex"". That coupled with the fact that daddy was the one tending the kids while momma fooled around was when papa finally said ""fuck this shit"". Big fight, LS broken, momma quit... then she was back 1 week later on an alt... hanging out with her online BF again. LS was reinstated 1 week after that with everyone forgiving the wife for the drama.   There are specific details I'm leaving out which really show what a manipulative bitch she was, but let's just say this type of cheating thing isn't an isolated incident."

The moment it becomes a chore, or someone's focus changes, things will start to fall apart for that person. That happens to enough people within the FC, the FC will die. If you have a group of people who all want different things, the FC will be nothing but a glorified linkshell. If you have a group of people that strive towards the same thing, they'll work together towards that goal."

ffxiv,3dyukt,PersonOfAPerson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"This right here is the only correct answer.  An FC/Guild is simply an organizational tool to manage players oriented towards a cooperative goal (whatever that goal may be, endgame raid clears, crafting, socialization, etc).  If there's no clear purpose for any social group, that group will naturally falter and ultimately break apart.  Being in a group just to be able to say ""I'm in a group, yay"" is not a clear purpose, but it's a very common reason for people to create MMO guilds/FCs/etc, especially when they want to be the guy in charge of the group.  It's also why so many of them fall apart and players come and go like the wind."
ffxiv,3dyukt,ffxivthrowaway03,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with the common goal. Most fear having ""small"" number of fc/guild members. So they try to recruit more members.  I fear for my current FC because it's being divided into raiders and non raiders lol."
ffxiv,3dyukt,chili01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not going to end well.  I never understood the fear of small guilds. My current FC has 8 people in it total, and that's our raid group/static. Our company chest is filled with food/crafting mats that we all pull from, and all put into. The cooks make raid food, the gatherers gather food/airship part mats and the crafters use those mats to make the airship parts. It all flows well. The more people you introduce into that system, the messier it gets.  My WoW guild was 30 people, we had our core 25 and some friends/subs. Same with Swtor, Aion, you name it.  Especially in this game, where linkshells exist, why would you go into an fc that doesn't align with your interests?"
ffxiv,3dyukt,Kazaji,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:05 2015 UTC,"Guilds are a numbers game when joining it.  Making it, sure. It makes sense to make a guild or FC that's just of your raid members. But that's not really making or growing a guild or FC because essentially, that's just a formality. You've already established a social group that gets along, slapping an in-game tag on to your group and calling it a guild just adds the in game perks of having one on top of just being on each other's friends lists.  But if you're starting a random guild or joining a random guild? Small guilds are harder to incorporate into. Like your guild would be impossible for someone to join. You're already the perfect number for a static/raid group. If I joined, i'd just be the odd man out all the time sitting on the side for the rare instances one of your normal members wasn't there. I wouldn't be privy to all your established in jokes, I wouldn't know any of you while all of you have known each other for some time. I'd just be that guy that hovers outside your group at the party while you all talk but never says anything. That's what small guilds are like and that's why people shy away from small guilds. Because small guilds tend to be for the people that formed them and not so much for anyone else. Those cliques that people form in large guilds that people complain about that never talk to anyone? Your small guild is one of those cliques."
ffxiv,3dyukt,rainzer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I guess I haven't looked at it that way.    You've already established a social group that gets along   This isn't always true, and wasn't true in my case either. As with most of the serious raiding guilds, there's an application process. The GM(FCM?) put out a post, and I applied to it. He had the guild name bought but there were only 4 people in it, and he filled out the rest of the spots through applications/recruitment.  You're right, if someone were to join the FC now, they'd be the odd man out. But that was the intent.   I guess I just think of it differently. I've never treated guilds/FCs as a social thing, more of an organization thing. It's easier to form a raid group out of a guild roster than a friends list, but you can chat with a friends list or linkshell/custom channel very easily."
ffxiv,3dyukt,Kazaji,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"I guess I just think of it differently. I've never treated guilds/FCs as a social thing, more of an organization thing.   I think these things overlap because of what the group represents. Depending on how much time you play, how long you've played the game for, and how much time you raid with these people, for a good number of people (especially say the high school to college kids), their raid group are people they spend more time with than their family and friends.  So maybe it starts as something practical just to clear game content, but I don't see why a social aspect doesn't overlap. I spent 10+ years with my WoW raid group. I still keep in touch with a number of them. I've been to some of their RL weddings. It was the guildleader/raid leader from there that got me into this game. That's why smaller guilds are much more difficult to me. From the outside, when I look at a small guild, I always assume they're a close knit group of friends. Trying to get into that would be a daunting task."

I started the game during Early Access and I jumped around through a few FCs that fell apart during my first few months, and around January 2014, after leaving my old FC (due to raiding drama, it fell completely apart two separate times), and I applied to the my current FC. They seemed like fun after they'd hosted a huge server-wide party so I inquired about me and my boyfriend joining. We got in and it's been great.  We definitely spend a lot of time with FFXIV, but we're a group of friends first, and FFXIV gamers second. When folks aren't in the mood to play it, we play other games together, or just come on TS to chitchat. I think that's made a huge difference because our goals wind up being to hang out, not for a specific in-game reason.  In March most of us went to PAX East together, sharing a hotel and all. My boyfriend proposed to me there, and a big part of why i stick with this FC is because all of them are people I want at my wedding. I can't really think of life without them anymore."

Some other people would just leave because of the animosity. I left a couple of FC's for that reason before I found a permanent home. I think you need to have a group that just gets along really well.  I also think having group activities is important. My FC does weekly pub nights on Friday's where we can all just chat (and drink) in mumble, maybe do some fun things in the game. There are also some other events we have like chocobo races and stuff."
ffxiv,3dyukt,DarkRaven47,2,Mon Jul 20 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"For me, personally, I stay for the people. If there's a good bunch of people that don't cause drama I'm happy to log in every day and say hi to everyone.  But other components of a good FC are: 1) Activity. You need people who log in consistently to help create a consistent atmosphere for everyone.  2) Good people. Find a good mix of people to help create the environment you want. If you're primarily aiming at creating a group of people dedicated to raiding, you'll probably want to recruit higher-leveled, geared, and experienced people to help create the raid groups. If you're aiming at a more casual ""newbie friendly"" atmosphere, it helps to have people who have a lot of free time as they are more apt to help people out on-call. Crafters are also beneficial here, especially if they're leveling new DoH/DoL classes because the things they craft can be of use.  3) Events. Do weekly lotteries or have contests that reflect what your members like doing (maybe a transmog-fashion contest or a fanart event). Host weekly catch-up groups for people trying to clear old/current content and just some help before they can reliably participate in DF runs for EX primals. Have people help out decorate the FC house (or maybe do a donations thing to help buy one, lol).  Just remember to have an idea of what kind of people and what kind of a community you want your FC to be, then do things to recruit those kinds of people who would be interested. Finally, make sure you can continually cater to the members. Having a suggestion box or some kind of way to communicate what they want to the people in charge will be helpful for this."
ffxiv,3dyukt,Kebbysaurus,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's the same that is true of any group of people anywhere:       People with the same idea about why they are there, people with common goals and shared aims. Respect! I meet a lot of people in this game who are disrespectful, very quick to try and one-up others, very quick to get angry. In the end if there's no respect between people it just does not work. No forcing people to do things you didn't agree to. Like nothing makes me more fed up of a person or group than if they try and guilt you into doing random things in the game for/with them or act like you owe them something.

ffxiv,3dyukt,Emelenzia,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:19 2015 UTC,"This.  Mixed guilds can work, but they cause many issues that can grow to dramatic proportions.  I entered a ""friendly and familial"" FC last August, whose members also claimed they wanted to stay somewhat up-to-date on endgame content. Truth is, we started being late, and we'd eventually become unable to clear stuff without Echo, because as the guild grew in size we'd recruit people of various skill levels and try to clear difficult fights with parties that were always changing (we got stuck two months on T9, for example, and had to declare a static, which made some people whine about how they weren't in).  The most skilled, most hardcore chunk of players eventually decided they wanted something more structured for Heavensward and left to form their own FC. Ever since, there's been drama every week about how X or Y left the former FC to join the latter, about something Z said, etc.  Mixed FCs can work, but if you don't set clear objectives, you'll end up having people with vastly different skill and personal objectives in mind trying to work together, which cannot work and WILL lead to smaller groups being formed and people being left out."

We're a relatively small ""core"" group of the FC (about 20 of us, and the FC is like 50 people total).

Our guild is pretty successful and we are completely casual with a very hands off leadership style. We have crafters and raiders with everything in between and our only expectations are to be helpful and friendly. I think our biggest thing going for us was that we had a big base is people that came from FFXI and were in guilds together so we had established friendships to build upon.
ffxiv,3dyukt,MannToots,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:35 2015 UTC,"FFXIV is my first MMO ever.  I didn't know a damn thing about raiding or guilds and whatever.  I made a small FC to just hang out with my friends.  After a couple months, I got into the raiding scene.  Slowly, one by one, I got to know people I played with.  One by one, they started joining my FC because we became friends and recognized how we could help each other out.  Fast forward to now, my FC has grown from 3 to over 60, and back down.  The key to having an FC stay afloat is to basically keep things intimate like a small family.  If everyone knows each other and talks to each other, they feel welcome.  People who feel welcome and appreciated never want to go anywhere else.    Be very picky about who you recruit, take the time to get to know them.  Share the same mindset.  Help whenever you can.  Contribute to the FC more than you take.  That's what all good FCs have."
ffxiv,3dyukt,pixelfashion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"Quick Background - I've been able to grow a active Guild in WOW to over 500 back when I played and was the Guild Master with my wife and have been able to help grow our FFXIV FC over 250 since 2.0.  Here's what's worked for me, not in any particular order.  1) Personal Touch - your leadership team needs to be able to connect with the members.  Greeting people make them feel welcome.  Take time out to teach them parts of the game for new people.  Our FC's Leadership Focus is to Aim for that Old School Guild Feeling of Family and I think we have succeeded.    2) Nitch / Main Focus - What's your Nitch of your FC that makes it stand out from all the others?  In WOW, our Guild became known as an Achievement Hunter Guild on the server we were on and we developed good relationships with other Guilds that had the same Focus which worked great for Events we ran.  Whatever your focus: Hardcore Raiding, Social, or something else - Become REALLY good at it.  Play to your strengths.   3) Vision - What is the Vision of your FC? (Ties into the above)  Where do you want to grow?  Have you shared this with your leadership team?  Does the FC know?  4) Recruiting - What is your membership poll from month to month?  Is it going up or down?  What are you doing to market your product?  Is it working?  What kind of people are you getting?  If not try something else.  5) Never Mass Invite people into your FC.  Always interview them with a forum application or in game dialogue.  You need to get a sense of that person before you just get them in to bolster your numbers.  In game Marketing through /shouts might not be your best source of new people once you get things up and off the ground.  6) Have a Great Leadership team.  Being an officer is a job not just a shiny badge to wear.  Break down the roles and assign your inner circle to help with them - ideally something that officer likes to do.  Ideas to help:  = Have FC Meetings on your Voice Chat Service in game and in game (at your FC House) to help with these areas.  = Host an Event - get creative  Those are some of my secrets I have used to run a successful Guild and FC hope that helps."

He loves the game so he's contactable most of the time. He's got a good structure in that lower ranks can plant flowers and take care of chocos and most of the FC chest and actions etc. So if he does go away there is always someone around the make the FC feel active. He insists that we recruit members who are friendly and helpful so we rarely have FC drama. We also promote members who show maturity and value to the fc. It just works really.

ffxiv,3dyukt,XirdenStone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"The people, and events!  Whether hardcore or casual, events should happen somewhat regularly. There's all kinds of things an FC can do for fun outside of raiding."
ffxiv,3dyukt,Smuckinfartass,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"My FC is basically irl friends, most of them I've known for like almost 15 years now. Others are people I've known for like 5-7 years. That's our secret. We don't really look for anything serious to do, usually if we all are online at the same time (some us live in other countries now for studying or working) we do things together, beside that, everyone just join an LS for a static or party finder. FC and house is just a general use for all of us. So I think it's better to have a smaller FC with people you have a strong relation with with a relaxed atmosphere over a serious strict one."
ffxiv,3dyukt,msmxmsm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'm part of a pretty wonderful FC, and a lot of what I have found makes things work is a lot of what I see making things work in my irl friendships.  We're actively present for one another, and there's usually at least a couple of people who are willing to help out anyone from the newbies to the veterans. If something bad goes down, we come together to help in any way we can.  We do regular events that are centered around different aspects of the game, such as raids, dungeon crawling, hunting, RP, crafting, gathering, even things like chocobo care and work around the FC house.  There's a sense of respect throughout the FC. While we joke around, and it can become a little crude, it never crosses the line into an offensive territory; if it does bother someone, they are usually comfortable enough to say something to the FC or to our leader (who then puts a stop to it). We have our share of debates and disagreements, but once again if it crosses the line into disrespectful territory or name calling we nip that in the bud.  We all have different personalities, and we have our own issues and disagreements, but we accept that, keep things fairly un-dramatic, and at our core are profoundly stable.  Essentially what has made our FC work as well as it does is open, honest communication, respect for one another, and acceptance of other styles of play.  I feel like a good sign that things are going well for our group is when I can accidentally while away hours just chatting."
ffxiv,3dyukt,MonkingAround,0,Mon Jul 20 18:23:52 2015 UTC,I've found these things in a LS but never a FC. It seems like FCs are more uptight and serious where as LSs are about the fun.

I'm not usually this shit with computer stuff so I feel like an idiot for asking these questions
ffxiv,3e1wfd,Soylentee,2,Tue Jul 21 09:17:19 2015 UTC,"Steam doesn't update your game, steam runs the game launcher which then updates your game. The client doesn't care if you own Heavensward or not, everyone gets to download the latest patch, you're just not allowed to level past 50, you can't access the expansion areas, and can't make an Au Ra character if you don't own a Heavensward license on your account. You can continue using the steam client."
ffxiv,3e1wfd,tristoune,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:14:12 2015 UTC,"If you bought heavensward for steam, you are screwed. Since you don't have a 2.0 steam account steam will not (and never) make the link between your account and heavensward."

ffxiv,3e1wfd,tohme,2,Tue Jul 21 09:22:16 2015 UTC,Right now it doesnt work because you were trying to put a heavenswars steam key into a standalone account.  It is the same thing as trying to put a PS3 heavensward in a PS4. I does not work like that.  If you buy a heavensward PC key on any online reseller (G2A/instantgaming/greenmangaming etc) it should work without any issue.
ffxiv,3e1wfd,PokeMaster420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:24:51 2015 UTC,"I have an account that was created back in the dark ages (1.0) but have downloaded the game through steam and play it there.   It's not whether you play through the Steam client (even if you bought a copy from Steam to run the game and access your account), it is whether you use the Steam version's code to create your game account.  Since you have a 1.0 version, which predates Steam versions, you have a non-Steam account. Therefore, you will need to purchase the game from a non-Steam retailer.  If you did happen to buy a copy of ARR on Steam in order to run the game launcher, then you basically have an unused code for the game sitting around (this would make a Steam-based game account)."

ffxiv,3e1v2p,Ventrue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:10:07 2015 UTC,I have 695/665 without Food and without melds on my MH/OH (Along with the very old 2.0 Accessories). I think once I meld those it will be feasible.   Only gonna need to meld it for one class and have that class make better gear that you can then pass on to the rest of them.
ffxiv,3e1v2p,JoTheKhan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:13:15 2015 UTC,"So you could use Seafood Stew HQ to cap control and get a nice bonus to your CP, then you would need 23 Craftsmanship from materia. That's still like 4x IV's though.  Edit: Fatfingered 8 instead of 9 oops!"

ffxiv,3e1v2p,JoTheKhan,2,Tue Jul 21 09:00:08 2015 UTC,"Until V's are reasonably priced, I don't see HQ crafted gear being much better for a long time.  Scrips: CP-4 Craftsmanship-239 Control-75  HQ Crafted: CP-4 Craftsmanship-225 Control-70  Pentamelding 3 Craft IV's and 2 Control IV's puts you at.... 4/243/78? Which is, strictly speaking, better! But doesn't feel worth it for every single class!"
ffxiv,3e1v2p,EphemeralStyle,2,Tue Jul 21 09:07:08 2015 UTC,I've already stocked up a small (humbly small) set of Vs for my crafters so I'll probably go the crafted route first and slowly meld up the pieces.   Better to waste gil than waste red scrips on gear that you'll eventually (might) want to upgrade later anyways. Redscrips are capped.

ffxiv,3e1v2p,EphemeralStyle,2,Tue Jul 21 09:12:50 2015 UTC,"I threw a crap load of money at the Transmog/transmute thing with the 4s and got extremely lucky lol.   The thing is that it cost so much to level your crafts now that by the time you get it to 60 to gear it, you're probably broke if you're not already wealthy.  The stupid thing is that red scrips are gonna screw the less well off crafters because they'll have to waste weeks of time just being able to buy the gear before they can even craft anything in the books.   This whole patch favored the richer people and people who went into crafting first (once HW started)"
ffxiv,3e1v2p,JoTheKhan,2,Tue Jul 21 09:15:25 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's exactly how I feel about it all too, but it kinda has felt like that since the beginning when it comes to crafting!  I make a decent amount from my own crafts, but it's super modest compared to the powercrafters. Every patch makes me feel farther and farther away from them ;_;  Congrats on your Vs though! I'd be super excited if I were you!"
ffxiv,3e1v2p,EphemeralStyle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:21:27 2015 UTC,Except those V's are literally multiple millions of gil on the MB. At least they were last time I checked.
ffxiv,3e1v2p,notasinglenamegiven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:18 2015 UTC,"Yup they are, also, it looks like pretty much each new pair of crafted gear requires you have mats from at least 2 sets of red scrip books. (For instance the new crafted tools require Astral birch lumber and Adamantite Ingots).  One is presumably crafted by Redscripped' CRPS and the other is Redscripped BSMs.  So its either gonna take a minimum of 2 weeks to make these new pieces of gear, or you're gonna need to buy heavily on the MB, or you're gonna need to be friends with other crafters.   Finding crafting a lot more challenging and a lot more fun in Heavensward. I feel sorry for people who aren't like super rich because otherwise I don't see how it would be possible to build up your crafts."
ffxiv,3e1v2p,JoTheKhan,2,Tue Jul 21 09:06:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, you don't need to be super rich to get everything, that's the point. Every casual and their mom will be able to get the ilvl180 gear, without having to spend much by buying them through scrips. It will just take them a while, since they are capped. But eventually, everyone will get there. The only difference will be that one group will spend millions upon millions on gil while the other will have to spend time. And right now I'm not even sure if investing this money is going to pay off."
ffxiv,3e1v2p,HeavenswardPS3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:21:43 2015 UTC,"So you're gonna go the red scrip gear route?   I think getting all the books as soon as possible will be worth it, but to do that you'll need to make the crafted gear or else you really can't even use the books. But then again I went into HW with the plan of blowing all the gil I saved so that I could craft for myself for all of 3.0->4.0"
ffxiv,3e1v2p,JoTheKhan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:23:39 2015 UTC,"I can afford it, and just as you, I went itno HW with the plan of blowing all the gil I saved. All I'm saying is that in the end, it probably won't make much difference which route you take and everyone will get there. Just took a look at the stats of the two chests: HQ meldable 70 control, 225 craftsmanship. Scrip not meldable: 75 control, 239 craftsmanship. You will have to add 5 control and 14 craftsmanship only to make up the stat difference, and those 19 stat points will take up a big chunk of your melding slots. Sure, you can put in some more materia with a bit of risk, but I don't think that the difference will be that noticeable."
ffxiv,3e1v2p,HeavenswardPS3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest with you. I haven't bothered much with crafting at all. I do have the meed i55 set (for whatever reason) but I literally only use them to repair my gear. I don't even really know what the red/blue scrips are for. What I DO know though: I want those ""Adept Boots"" from the lvl 58 scrip."
ffxiv,3e1v2p,notasinglenamegiven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:09:43 2015 UTC,"Lmao, you should be able to get the boots within 20mins then if you go for it, blue scrips are pretty easy to get on crafters."

Given OP's example item, the stats are as follows:     i180: 4 CP | 239 Craftsmanship | 75 Control i170 HQ: 4 CP | 225 Craftsmanship | 70 Control   5 Control and 14 craftsmanship seem reasonable to at least meet i180 stats.  We'll have to see the caps though.  I can see it being an alternative to gated (red scrip) gear acquisition."
ffxiv,3e1v2p,Ventrue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:02:00 2015 UTC,The Chimerical body piece caps at 234 Craftmanship so you can expect that the HQ 170 piece will probably cap at higher than 239. (The HQ Chimerical can hold 35 more Craftmanship than it starts with). That means that the HQ 170 can probably hold at the least like 260 Craftmanship total.
ffxiv,3e1v2p,JoTheKhan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:11:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good point; when combined with the fact we can't fully meld-out even i150 gear, it's very possible that there will be a lot of cap space on some of the stats."
ffxiv,3e1v2p,Ventrue,2,Tue Jul 21 09:14:21 2015 UTC,"I only had a cursory glance at it, but it looks like the crafted sets are gated behind gatherers using Traders' Favors to get items to trade for crafting materials (unless only the high-level ones for HQ materials require favors, and low ones are on regular nodes.)  Example: 5 spindles of NQ Moonbeam Silk costs   10 Yellow Ooids 10 Black Swan Feathers 1 Rowena's token (red crafters' scrip)   (there is also an option for 5 HQ spindles, requires three each of two higher-level gathered items, but also 3 Rowena's tokens)  A full crafted CRP set (left side only, no belt, including tool) requires, along some more-readily-available materials   105 scrip materials, so 21 Rowena's tokens (or 1050 scrips) 5 Landborne Aethersand 5 Leafborne Aethersand 5 Seaborne Aethersand 17 FC3 demi One MC demi Somebody buying however many Traders' Favors it takes to get enough trade-in items.

ffxiv,3e0dfs,LeafElksthorne,11,Tue Jul 21 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"Back when WM only boosted you by 20%, this may have been a valid strategy... But now that it's 30%, you're only ever going to want to be out of the stance for extended movement mechanics. (ie. something like Earthshakers in T13 or Blue-Orbs in Ravana etc.)"
ffxiv,3e0dfs,FFXIV_BRD,3,Tue Jul 21 01:08:31 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think there is some credit to this idea! I was curious about the differences, exactly, for damage between no Wanderer's Minuet and with Wanderer's Minuet, so I tested out the damage between 5 heavy shots in WM, and 5 heavy shots out of WM with autos. The reason I chose to do this was that, once Wanderer's Minuet is cast, you are forced to lock into the stance for at least 15 seconds. While in Wanderer's Minuet, I imagine it would be ideal to use up 5 GCDs, using the very last GCD for Iron Jaws.  I made sure to weed out results that had any criticals, including auto attack criticals.  Here are the results with WM off.  And with WM on.  So turning off WM long enough to do 5 heavy shots and 5 autos, you actually get a DPS increase. At least with my gear, which is ilvl 183 without a Hive Bow (yes, I know...). However, as much as I would really love stance dancing as a playstyle for bards, I think that there are many things that this test in vacuum fails to cover. For one thing, WM HAS to be on for 15 seconds once it's cast. That, imo, makes it awkward to rotate in. Maybe it could be a once per 30 seconds thing? While it is possible to turn off WM and then immediately turn WM back on, that wouldn't be too useful for maximizing time out of the stance.  Well, let's assume we did Krietor's opener successfully up until the second EA, doing the rest of the GCDs would look something like this, assuming no SS procs and such:  IJ > HS > SS > EA > HS > HS > HS > IJ > HS > HS > EA > SS > HS > HS > HS > IJ  Following OP's idea, we could turn off WM right after the second EA, and then turn it back on just before the second IJ. That would give us 3 heavy shots, without any abilities, because we blew our cooldowns on the opener, and 3 auto attacks. Once we turn IJ back on, we have to buy in for 15 seconds, so, we do IJ, then we get to do HS HS EA SS HS, we can turn WM off again for two more HS and autos and free movement before returning back for IJ. This is theoretical, I haven't had a chance to really practice this rotation, but I did get to test out the 3 heavy shots with and without WM!  http://i.imgur.com/RAxKNOQ.png  Something to note is that I actually only did 2 auto attacks in the run with WM off, and the damage was still noticeably increased. ACT does say the damage is lower, but I think this is because while the WM off run was recorded as 10 seconds long, the WM on run was recorded as 5 seconds long. The damage itself, however, was higher and I did run both trials waiting until the end of the third GCD.  Tomorrow once maintenance is done, I'll try to test out the damage doing full WM on, and stance dancing occasionally with WM off, and post results! I'd like to see if I can get a comparable amount of bloodletter and SS procs."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,FoesBringer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, auto attacks is actually more than 30% of heavy shots, so you dps more without WM...  But a thing you must add in you math is that heavy shot is our skill with the least potency, and we're using bloodletter off gcd, which have a greater potency (meaning the +30% will be more significant vs auto), and which is refresh quite often with our dots crit rating.   I wonder, if you add something like 2 bloodletter for 5 heavy shots, is there more dmg with or without WM"
ffxiv,3e0dfs,luckyn,2,Tue Jul 21 07:54:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for trying this out. As I said I had no numbers but when I could pull it off correctly (still getting used to Bow Mage) it at least felt like popping WM off when all the buffs were on cooldown and no big attacks were ready was more damage.  A huge pain to do correctly though and I know my description of how I was trying it was probably off, but sounded like you were doing basically what I was trying."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,Miewn,3,Tue Jul 21 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"This ""change"" sounds like when they implemented the distance system in ffxi and rangers. lolol. I think the closer you are, the more accuracy but less damage; vice-versa.   People found ways around it and found some ways to optimize the play style.  Nevertheless play what you find fun. Numbers just stress you out. The most important thing is understanding your mechanics and not getting hit with shit. lol   I main PLD and WARs are OP as dumb hell."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,Valk_Eir,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, WAR is crazy powerful now. They're practically a DPS when they put on STR gear."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,cairthenn,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:57 2015 UTC,"I've actually tested this myself as well. The result is that Stance Dancing is inferior to full time WM.   My method of Stance Dancing was that as soon as I use Iron Jaw and Empyreal Arrow, I'd get out of WM and take full advantage of the auto attacks. Once your DoTs require reapplication, your Empyreal Arrow will be ready as well. So you turn it back and you will be able to Iron Jaw and Empyreal Arrow two times (once as soon as you turn on WM and once right before DoTs come off). Then, rinse and repeat.   Cooldowns will be weaved in according to your playstyle."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,Flyinapplez,2,Tue Jul 21 02:41:53 2015 UTC,"As long as you're reapplying your DOTs with Iron Jaws, switching in and out is a -very- small DPS loss since you're also maximizing Empyreal Arrow use simultaneously. Ensure you're using Sidewinder in WM as well.  Opening without WM is a DPS gain."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,Loonal,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:17 2015 UTC,"In a vacuum Bards AA only does about 20-24% of our total dps, so WM full time is just flat out better, there is no doubt about it. The only way you can to turn off WM for a DPS increase is if you have to be mobile for a lengthy amount of time."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,gurosebe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:43 2015 UTC,I did some super basic math on the current 30% Atk up that WM has and considering you perfectly hit every AA in one minute vs being on full time WM... I estimate that you need to either A lose 10-12.5s of GCD time (on heavy shots) in WM for WM to be a dps loss or B hit 5 more bloodletters than someone in WM (considering you don't get a single proc on WM) this is of course based on no buffs at all no extra bloodletter procs no opener. Just plain substituting iron jaw for 3 refreshes of WB/VB after the first one considering it clips and you lose a single tick except for the last one and every instance of Empyreal Arrow you can throw for a minute.  TLDR you'll more or less get more potency per minute in WM even failing a couple of casts. And yes over time that 30% increase will eventually trump AA dmg.  Sidenote used to main bard but even IF this WM crap is a dps gain I'm still not touching bard with a 100foot stick till they remove the bullshit casts.  For all those assholes who say but you're not forced to used WM SE really fucking put the nail in the coffin of 'you have to use this' with that 10% buff (hell they force you to stay in it for 15s when you use it). They seem to be forcing a paradigm shift for ranged dps that NO ONE WANTED OR ASKED FOR.
ffxiv,3e0dfs,sargonkid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:05:02 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to suspect you're going to be correct about a WM straight gain once we reach higher ilvls. It was an interesting experiment though (and at i180 apx it looks like Heavy+Auto > Heavy by itself in WM, so the question is, do cooldowns lineup well enough to allow BRD to take advantage of that without delaying cooldowns too much).  Anyway, I second your sentiment about BRD getting the shaft. I'd have quit it as well if it were not for my raid group :/  SE really screwed us."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,Yuiko_Kaeda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"wm is a massive damage increase and you should really only ever be turning it off for times when you need to move a lot. there's nothing about having it off that gives you any real chance to increase dps, no skills that require you to be out of minuet"
ffxiv,3e0dfs,aiurily,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:23 2015 UTC,"I am with you on this.  I normally leave WM on all the time, except for those few bosses here and there that require constant movement - and even then, I may turn it on at certain times.  I have not done the numbers, but it ""seems"" to work out good for me."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,16ShinyUmbreon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"This isn't true. With everything on cooldown and only Heavy Shot to spam, during that time Heavy+Auto > Heavy by itself in WM.  So the question is here, is there a way to time everything so you have that 15 second recast not stalling your procs and cooldowns too much.   So ideally you blow your load so to speak every 15-30 seconds. You're never out of WM for more than the length it takes to lineup cooldowns+ one of the more potent attacks. In my case I was timing it maximum 14 or 15 seconds out, and anywhere from 15-30 seconds in depending how my cooldowns lined up + Iron Jaw.   Sometimes it would be less time out of WM than that, sometimes more in. It just depended on how things lineup.  If that makes more sense.   If, over a length of time though it becomes apparent you're stalling cooldowns to a degree it's no longer making up for the greater potency of Heavy+Auto, at that point we know WM always on is the way to go.  I'm not sure about that though. Our cooldowns actually lineup really nicely.  The other thing to consider though is the skill ceiling.  I found stance-dancing on a dummy difficult. Granted my muscle memory still wants to do old BRD rotation and I have maybe 40 hours into fully leveled BRD... but still it's going to be difficult.   So, if the gain is only minimal maybe it's not worth it?  But we don't know this stuff yet. We can't just WM is always better because we know in a vacuum under certain circumstances this is not the case. So the ideal is to test and see if there are situations in actual game where stance dance is ideal.  Hope that makes sense."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,Soylentee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I'm experimenting with right now. Theoretically, this method is superior as during the times you are out of WM you will mostly be spamming heavy shot. If your WM heavy shots are doing 1300 (example for easy math) damage every 2.47 seconds (my current skill cooldown), then in non-WM heavy shot does 1k flat every 2.47 seconds. If your auto attacks are doing more than 300 in that time (around 2.47 seconds each), it is a dps increase in this specific vacuum. Currently I'm only ilvl 181 with upgraded law bow, so this may change as my ilvl grows as well as the cap (especially since stat weights are still being calculated)."
ffxiv,3e0dfs,Arronwy,2,Tue Jul 21 02:26:57 2015 UTC,"seems like too much to manage. you'd basically only be able to stay out of WM til you see a bloodletter reset, or have ANY of your oGCD attacks come up, or til your dots are at 4s~  in practice, heavy shot+auto will deal more dmg than WM heavy shot, its just that you won't get very many of those because of the tons of OGCD stuff, dot refreshes, and of course, bloodletter resets that you lose 54~ potency on if you use them out of WM, or possibly missing a reset in the time it takes for for you to go in WM to use it"

ffxiv,3e283o,Tatsa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:09 2015 UTC,"Adding to what others have written, adding an authenticator (software or physical token) stops the IP check. You just need to put in the 6 digit code it gives you each time you login (which really isn't a hassle if you have your phone with you etc, you run the app and it gives you the number straight away).  Just make sure you write down the emergency removal password in case you lose your phone otherwise you'll need to actually talk to SE and jump through some hoops to remove it.  Bonus: You also get a free teleport when you have a security token on your account and you can change it as often as you want (you just go to the aethryte in question and click/select free)."

That said, I only have infrequently used skills bound to my mouse keys, ie off GCDs, healing stuff (I'm dps), sprint and mount, etc. Also , I still have trouble with the 5 and 8 buttons, I ended up binding the same ability to them because I kept accidentally hitting the wrong one."

In reply to the OP, I use shift+1-3 for my mudras, and shift+4 for my ninjutsu.

You do get used to the buttons over time for sure, but the G600 is IMO a better piece of hardware and is much easier and faster to adapt to.    The one thing I think the original Nagas did better was the placement of mouse 4 and mouse 5 initially (they were just to the left of left click, so you just moved your pointer finger over a few MM and could hit them), but that even changed on later releases to the more standard ""lined up behind the mousewheel"" layout that seems to be the go-to for gaming mice nowadays."

Having 12 buttons for your thumb it can kinda be hard hitting specific keys so instead bind Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and combinations of those to the thumb buttons, and that gives you like 10 new key binds just for a single thumb button. You hit your normal abilities with 1-0 (though 1-5 is more reachable) then you get another 10 abilities from the Shift thumb button+1-0, another 10 with Ctrl+1-0, etc. So you only end up using 3 thumb buttons and it's a lot easier instead of 12"

ffxiv,3dyinv,shastaxc,0,Mon Jul 20 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. The G600 is a pretty bulky mouse, partly because of the additional mouse button on top (the G-trigger thing). And I also have small hands (only about 7 1/4 inches from the base of my palm to the tip of my middle finger) so I had been trying to get smaller mice. I tried the RAT9 since it was adjustable but I couldn't get the mouse buttons forward enough.  I realized that even though I have small hands, since I use a really forward-resting palm grip, I need a larger mouse to grip it comfortably. The G600 turned out to work perfectly for me. My thumb just reaches the G9-11 buttons.  I also really like that the right side of the mouse curves inward toward the base so it's easier to pick up even though it weighs a little more than most mice.  Another problem I was having picking out a good mouse was that a lot of ""gaming"" mice these days feature thumb rests or pinky rests. But I need thumb and pinky contact with my desk/mousepad to make microadjustments in aiming so that automatically ruled out all those options."

ffxiv,3dyinv,dejecaal,-2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:53 2015 UTC,"ITT: People who didn't know how to set up their keybinds correctly.  As long as you use good keybinds, you don't need a mouse with a gorillion thumb buttons, because your keybinds aren't limiting you in the first place.  However, because the default keybind setup of virtually every MMORPG ever made is completely awful, a lot of people fall into the trap that is using poor binds and their performance is crippled by them. This is how clickers and people who can't move while using their abilities (because they have key abilities bound to alt-8 or something) are born."
ffxiv,3dyinv,xnkrts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:58 2015 UTC,"On this note, I will bring up another contentious issue, the infamous wasd vs. esdf keybinding for movement (this is the emacs vs. vi debate for gamers). Also, if you are using a keyboard + mouse combo, for the love of all things good, please UNBIND turn left and turn right, and have your a & d / s & f bound to strafe left and right. You turn with your mouse (that's why you use one!) so you don't need to bind it to keys!  It is MUCH easier to follow what I'm saying from here onwards, if you look at a standard keyboard while you read the rest.  I won't start another flamewar on this; instead I'll just explain my logic for MY choice (so you don't have to follow it/share my opinion) for keybindings.  I prefer esdf, for two reasons: 1) the f key has a bump on it, so I locate it by feel and verify that my fingers are in the right positions, and 2) by moving my movement keys by one set of keys over, I unlock another column of keys (namely q, a, and z) for quick binds, without losing any accessibility to the shift, alt or control keys.  My logic with keybinds is quite simple. First, I set up just one hotbar to be mapped to keys that are essentially one key over from my movement keys (including diagonally over). So since i use esdf for movement, the keys that i consider to be just one key over include: 3, 4, q, w, r, t, a, g, z, x, c, v, b. Then I throw in the 1, 2 and 5 keys because I am used to reaching for them all the time, and throw out the x and c keys (for similar but opposite reasons: I'm not used to reaching for them as much).   So that leaves me with the following keys: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, q, w, r, t, a g, z, and b keys to do my bindings. that's 13 keys, more than enough.   From there, I bind the keys to ctrl- and alt- for hotbar 2 and 3 respectively. Now I have 3 hotbars worth of keys bound to my lefthand that I can reach quickly/comfortably.   This is classic config logic/setup for a lot of FPS players back in the day; I've been using something similar since my Quake days. So there is some bias.   For FPS, the right hand is restricted to aiming with the mouse, and left hand is used for movement and quick switching of weapons or actions. Hence, my left hand is used to pressing a bunch of keys in quick succession, and right hand is focused on twitch movement on the mouse and fast clicks on the left and right mouse button.   I find this config works very well for me; for those not wants to switch to a more keyboard based config, you want to give it a try. Like I said, I'm not proposing this as the best, but one that works well for me, and the rationale behind my keybind choices."
ffxiv,3dyinv,dejecaal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"ESDF seems like it works much better on an US keyboard layout than on some European layouts.  Many (or most) European layouts have an extra key between Z and Shift, which makes the shift key smaller than on the standard American layout. Because of this, ESDF is a bit annoying to use because shift is uncomfortably far away.  Ctrl is also a bit annoying to press on ESDF and I don't think this changes with US layouts."
ffxiv,3dyinv,unbalanced_checkbook,0,Mon Jul 20 22:40:39 2015 UTC,"No matter how good your keybinds are, you're still using the same hand for movement and actions. That affects response times no matter what.   You can argue that good keybinds make the difference almost negligible, but it will never be as fast as dedicating one hand purely to movement, which is exactly what using a MMO mouse makes possible."
ffxiv,3dyinv,dejecaal,5,Mon Jul 20 20:03:17 2015 UTC,"You have five fingers, and generally only need to press one key at a time for movement in combat (A or D). That still leaves you with two fingers for the actual ability keys, your little finger for shift/ctrl modifiers, and thumb for alt modifiers and if you're dextrous pressing keys like V and C.   you're still using the same hand for movement and actions. That affects response times no matter what.    Meanwhile, with an MMO mouse, you're using one finger (which is the thumb, perhaps the clumsiest finger on your hand, no less) for ten or more buttons. This is going to affect your response times just as much as using the keyboard would, no matter what. Not that response times are even important in a slow-paced PvE game like FFXIV.  So what I'm saying is that it makes no difference whether you use a keyboard with decent binds or a gazillion button mouse. Both have the same potential, and it's mostly a matter of preference.  It's also stupid to recommend people to get a $70 mouse instead of just giving them helpful advice for setting up their keybinds. The default keybinds are abysmal, and it's easy to see how an MMO newbie like OP might look at them and think ""Wow, having to press 9, 0 and [ for my abilities sure is inconvenient. If I had this special mouse with a numpad on it, I could easily reach all of those keys with my thumb!""  Here's some actual helpful keybinds advice that should be completely obvious to any reasonably experienced MMO player, but that newbies might not have figured out by themselves:  1) Don't bind keys that you can't comfortably reach with your left index finger while keeping your left little finger on the shift key. To me, that's number keys up to 5, top row keys up to T, middle row keys up to F, and bottom row keys up to V. If you have big hands or nimble fingers you may be able to go one extra key to the right for each row.  2) In addition to above, if pressing a certain key combination feels uncomfortable, either don't use it or bind a less frequently used skill to it.  3) Change the default movement key bindings so that A and D strafe to the left and right. Unbind the keys that turn your character, you should be turning with the mouse by holding down right mouse button.  4) Bind any and all keys near your WASD cluster to abilities. Q, E, R, F, C, V, to name the easy to reach ones. Lower row keys are harder to press, so use them for less frequent things. With some dexterity you can press V with your thumb, which saves you from having to awkwardly hit it with your index finger.  5) You'll probably find that the easiest to press keys are Q, E, R, F, followed by number keys 2-4 (with 1 and 5 being slightly more difficult). You'll want to keep your bread and butter abilities on those keys. What I do is keep all of those keys, along with the various modifiers (shift, ctrl primarily) for Q, E, R, F, for very commonly used abilities such as your primary DPS combo(s). I use number key modifiers primarily for various steroids and other cooldowns.  6) If you're using a movement finger to press a certain bind and need to move, just use another finger to hit the movement key instead. For instance, if you need to press your R bind with your index finger and also need to strafe right, move your middle finger from W to D temporarily."

The mobs, I'm not fully sure on. I think, as long as your friend is the first one to attack, they should get full standard rewards (including their own drop chance for items), and you should get the same when you contribute enough (including your own drop chance, meaning you might get an item when your friend doesn't). I might be wrong about that for high level differences. One thing that definitely does work though is quest quotas - if you're in a party with them, any quest they're on that requires mobs killing, your kills will contribute and their quest will give them the full rewards. (EDIT: Ah, didn't know about the >10-level difference. There's your answer above.)  Might want someone to clarify certain things or make sure what I'm saying is actually true, but I'm pretty sure this is how it works."

I stand by my words that in current state, even when opened on a second monitor (which not everyone can do), it provides very little useful information.   One of the ways it can be improved is by going in to more detail on preferred targets for each buff. For example how machinists are one of the best targets for spear, since in most cases (unless you apply it right after their skills went on CD) they will get to use reload and quick reload with the buff. Or how enhanced balance is amazing on BLM, while extended will probably get partially wasted as they go in to mana regen part of their rotation. Or how SE's refusal to allow us to see other's TP means that tower is even more of a lottery now.  But to deliver complete information, this will take quiet the amount of research. For example dots are now affected by SS, so technically arrow should be good on any class, but are dots still snapshoted? If yes, there's a chance that it will be wasted on SMN."

Time is never the issue when I mark, nor is it efficiency, but rather people assuming like they're not treated as if they're smart enough to know what they need to hit. I've had low levels where they ignore the numbers, and high levels where they feel like they're above the tank and don't feel as if they need to take orders and do as they see fit as the proper method.   Damned if you do, damned if you don't in my experience.  Personally, I love marking, but I hate tension and problems. I've learned to adapt though and hold hate on everything, unless someone is REALLY focusing one thing down in a group and trying to rip hate off. I get it back eventually, unless it's about to die, then I just fucking ignore it."

But you are right, somebody always feels insulted or that they are too high level to listen.  For using a controller/keyboard combo, I just find marking to be too time consuming.  It's easier for me to just stay on top of every mob and pull the odd stray one off of DPS.  Now if only MCHs could learn to not use Point Blank on the mob that I'm attacking."
ffxiv,3dybaq,rum_is_yum,2,Tue Jul 21 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"It's just immature kiddies trying to prove they are adults by acting completely like kids. Marking is the most efficient communication there is in the game The only thing that is better than marking is voice communication which isn't in the game.  When I go into new content I mark, and I have no trouble when the healer or a dps changes my marks. I will go along with the new marks because they know something I don't, or needs something done that I'm not aware of. And that enriches my knowledge about the content.  Anyone who thinks following markers is taking orders and hence an insult probably have never worked in a team in the real world. Only ever been playing house with school group projects and academic stuff."
ffxiv,3dybaq,zjnetil,0,Tue Jul 21 01:34:36 2015 UTC,"I used to always mark, but I ended up getting lazy.  The things that will make me mark now are:  1) DPS are consistently hitting different mobs, and the healer isn't having enough time to DPS, or is having a hard time in general  2) There's an annoying mob like a bee or an AOE spamming assmuffin.  3) If mechanics rely on a kill order.  I have every job at 50, and MNK/PLD at 60... And even though I know most content inside and out, sometimes spam on the screen or just a lack in concentration makes you attack the wrong mob. It's nice to have mobs targetted just as a way to say ""here, attack this one guys!"".  If there's more than 3 mobs I generally don't target, because people should be using AOE skills and I don't want to make them revert to single target. (unless it follows one of the rules above)."

ffxiv,3dybaq,Narrlocke,4,Tue Jul 21 10:03:12 2015 UTC,"I know what you're talking about. Never played anything but DPS classes in MMOs, and just went for a healer some weeks back.   I was pretty scared of doing dungeons at first, but turns out, it's the most fun I ever had in an MMO. People praising me like ""pretty good for the first time"" was the best feeling ever, and kept me going through the hard times. And like you already realised, they will come.   In fact I haven't played for the last two days, because friday I ran about five dungeons + Ravana, and every single one had toxic morons in it. And they really got to me, even though it wasn't me they complained about. In the end, I decided that it isn't worth my time, spending +20mins in a dungeon, just so they can ridicule the other players at the end. You know the type, those guys who drop toxic lines and immediately quit the dungeon, so people can't talk back. Insecurity par excellence. I can tell them that they did good, but a negative comment always leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Especially if you're new...  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is: yeah, be nice to your party. Especially if there are new people in it. New people are usually excited about doing new dungeons. There's no need to turn this excitement into fear."
ffxiv,3dybaq,Calorie_Mate,3,Mon Jul 20 16:57:18 2015 UTC,"As a former DRG main, I know the feeling you have right now. I'd highly invite you to try all the tank classes eventually (but only do it once you get Provoke from GLD first). I absolutely love WAR. Really excels as an OT, and can MT well if you know how to pair and cycle your defensive CDs. DRK is pretty fun too, the game of keeping your MP up and not having to worry about aggro that much (due to your sheer library of AoE attacks) makes it engaging. However, I've always felt PLD to be bland. That's my next 60, so I'm looking forward to the class changing.  But keep on developing good tanking habits, such as numbering mobs. Even post 50, folks often split their DPS among 2 or more mobs, and you will lose hate, especially as a PLD if Circle of Scorn is on CD. Also, remember to never wear armor that a DRG can also wear! Always wear tank specific armor when leveling."
ffxiv,3dybaq,TasakeaTerrechant,3,Mon Jul 20 15:23:55 2015 UTC,"PLD has the biggest playstyle change from 50 to 60 of the tanks, so it's not really fair to even evaluate it if you didn't get it to 60."

ffxiv,3dybaq,ShinVerus,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, you get two new finishers, one of them being a DoT, meaning your normal rotation goes from ""123 halone"" to ""keep Gore Blade up, do I need the STR debuff? Do I need threat? if yes to one of those two, Rage of Halone. If no, use royal authority"". It's overall much more active.  Not to mention you gain a 30 sec cd that you need to press in order to block that gives back MP which is now relevant due to...  Clemency! The single thing that most distinguishes good PLD from the bad ones. Good Paladins can do all ofthe above, tank AND heal now! You just need to know when to heal and keep your MP up.  You got a nice AOE reduction to the party too, but I feel like that's more situational."
ffxiv,3dybaq,TheMagicBola,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:54 2015 UTC,Clemency has been responsible for more wins on the Fractal boss than anything else for me. Watching it crit for 6000HP on a dying healer is so satisfying. Honestly this is like what Paladins are meant for.
ffxiv,3dybaq,zjnetil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:06 2015 UTC,I just wish it's more than a simple hard-cast heal.

Since I have good judgement from being a healer main, I can tell right away how many mobs I can afford to pull based on the parties composition and how good the players are, etc  I can also decide on whether I should be using STR or VIT depending on how good the healer is, and all that (shouldnt even be a question but some DF healers are unspeakably bad)  And then I always play the fun minigame of never letting anyone be hit by anything other than aoes, which means never losing aggro and picking up mobs quickly in every situation  It makes it really satisfying  Also marking is nice at the start but at 50+ its pointless since people will just AOE the crap out of everything and any decent tank will keep aggro on all mobs anyway... Marking is more for situations where an add spawns in a boss fight and you have to kill it right away"

As a tank / healer, you have more power to correct stupid behavior if they don't listen to you by either not tanking the mob or not giving out heals until they stop doing things that harm the group.  Like last night, I had a DPS take off running and pull mobs at the start of the dungeon before the healer even finished casting Protect.

ffxiv,3dybaq,AzurewynD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:47:22 2015 UTC,"I rarely get tanks that mark, so I absolutely appreciate that you're doing that. I think you'll be fine up to 50, especially with marking. You'll occasionally get people attacking out of order which is a little annoying as a Paladin since their AoE is pretty weak for a while but nothing you can't handle.  The tough part is going to be when you get to trials and 50+ content, and it's not really the content that's the tough part. You're going to start running into more and more elitest attitudes when you get up to 8 man content and extreme/raid stuff. As long as you do your research for the harder stuff and you have a good grasp on what needs to be done try not to let it phase you and don't worry about your mistakes because you'll learn from them. One thing that can often quell a lot of people's anger is to just go in honest and upbeat. Let them know you watched the video but it's still your first time and mistakes might be made. Other people make it hard sometimes but just try to have fun."

But, in any other case, the marks are just a convenience for the tank (needs to pay even less attention) and a pain to healers and melees.  The reality is though, that tanking dungeons is incredibly easy compared to tanking trials or raids. One should just be aware of the big difference, and everything will be fine."
ffxiv,3dybaq,Ahrounmoon,3,Mon Jul 20 16:04:06 2015 UTC,"It's really just convenience for the tank? I mean, if everybody is attacking the same target, the tank can just hold the hate of him, if every player attack any monster it just gets a mess, right?"

On most trash, I should be able to hold aggro on everything in a pull, regardless of what people are attacking. If I'm only focusing on the threat of one target, even with marking, then chances are a healer is probably going to pull something off me at some point in my tanking life.  If it's a lower level dungeon, and I don't have my full kit, AND for some reason I'm consistently losing threat, then I'll mark the first target in a pull with a 1. After that, if I'm doing everything properly, I should have it under control. That's about it.  It really shouldn't be necessary to methodically mark every trash mob pull with a 1-2-3 before pulling.  If someone else in the party likes to do that? Great, I'll follow it. But it's not something that's fundamentally necessary."
ffxiv,3dybaq,Gikamoth,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"Most tanks eventually grow out of marking.  I used to do it religiously, but the more I did it, the more I realized most dps didn't give a shit and would kill things in whatever order they pleased.   I still mark priority mobs like enemy healers or those effing bees that can nearly one-shot the tank."
ffxiv,3dybaq,aberthin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"You can make marking real quick with a couple mouseover macros. Done well you can mark the first two targets in a pull without breaking stride. Beyond the first two targets there's very rarely a need to mark anything else. And then you just learn to adapt. If the group is AoE happy you AoE more. If they focus single target, you don't AoE more. If they do whatever the hell they want you point and laugh and give player commendations to the healer.  All that said, yeah. Tanking can be stressful and will burn you out quick with some player attitudes. DPS are a dime a dozen but great DPS are diamonds in the rough. I tanked for a long time and I'm hesitant to get back into it myself. The only reason I'm considering it is because I know some good people looking to DPS. They make tanking fun. If you know others like that, treasure them."
ffxiv,3dybaq,dracosuave,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:49 2015 UTC,"yes, but as a dps, you should know to focus on what everyone else is killing so to limit the number of opponents quickly, rather than trying to down a solo mob on your own as if you're some superhero.  that becomes a problem of dps rather than tank.  you're part of a team.  so marking is a convenience for tanks to direct early dps classes to the appropriate targets.  but once the dps realizes they are part of a team and are causing wild shit when they don't target what everyone else is targeting, then the marks are no longer necessary.  tl;dr  training wheels help you ride a bike, but once you can ride a bike, you don't need the wheels..."
ffxiv,3dybaq,aberthin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"This really depends on the tank and the content at hand.  Always remember to check the aggro of the other mobs even when you mark. if you have the hotbar space have two versions of your ranged aggro attack, one as a macro with the Mark 1 attached and one without. If you feel the need to mark the rest of the group do so during GCD while you check the rest of the pull's aggro. Priority on marks should go to the things with the most annoying skills, such as Tank Busters or huge AoEs, and then to ones closest to the most number of melee DPS so they can get into position faster.  I usually find its pointless to mark after the first one, you should, in most dungeons and most cases, have easily established group hate by now and have a good sense on which one to focus on next while maintaining awareness of the mobs."
ffxiv,3dybaq,dracosuave,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"I've personally found marking in dungeons to be worse rather than better. Reasoning?    Tank only focuses what they mark and lose the hate on the 2nd/3rd guys to healer.   DPS with AoE (SMN with Bane, SCH with Bane, BLM with Fire2 and plenty of others) now have their damage drastically reduced or they grab hate from tank. Tank stops to mark, slowing down the run. It only adds a couple of seconds but multiply that times the amount of pulls and you're adding a couple of minutes onto a 20 minute run. Tanks develop a system that is just not usable in high level dungeons. Should try to learn to grab hate on multiple baddies while low level, so they know what to do when DPS starts getting real AoE   IMO Marking is only something that should be used when there is a specific reason. Such as, the humans that turn into dragons in Snowcloak, the Gobwalkers/Jagd Dolls in A2 etc."
ffxiv,3dybaq,aberthin,5,Mon Jul 20 16:29:37 2015 UTC,Marking isn't the problem in that case.  Not spreading enmity for AoEs is the problem.  That's like blaming Cleric Stance being used when a dps check is failed; it's blaming the wrong cause.
ffxiv,3dybaq,dracosuave,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I don't understand your argument"
ffxiv,3dybaq,aberthin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:49 2015 UTC,"The argument is that the tank marking is unable to provide sufficient AoE as a result of marking, which is false; that's just a tank providing insufficient AoE enmity. The Marking isn't the cause at all."
ffxiv,3dybaq,zippomatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:47:18 2015 UTC,"That isn't what I was implying. I was implying that tanks who mark are more likely to not provide proper AoE threat(correlation, not causation).  IF they are providing proper aoe threat generation, then there is 0 reason to mark. The only 2 reasons I can see for marking are:    Tank can't hold AoE threat, so marks so that he can focus 1 target  There is a specific mechanic where one mob needs to die first.   In all other scenarios, it doesn't matter."
ffxiv,3dybaq,aberthin,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"Or 3, there's a melee in the group who doesn't do so well at the AoE that marking targets might still be beneficial"
ffxiv,3dybaq,PingerKing,0,Tue Jul 21 18:11:28 2015 UTC,How would it be helpful?
ffxiv,3dybaq,aberthin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"That's not a fault of the mark, that's a lazy tank. It becomes obvious to anybody who's tanked beyond Copperbell that even healer will pull threat off you if you don't give a single flash or overpower at the beginning of a pull to establish minimum group hate. That won't happen because of marks, but rather will happen more often without marks if the player doesn't care to check the tank's target before dotting and nuking whatever they like with Fester. Extremely easy to mark right as you pull while you wait for the enemy to walk over. If you can't be bothered to press two buttons there's even a simple macro you can write up make it an all-in-one. Now, if you wanna get wild, I dare you to try having 2 separate marks bound. If you're spreading threat with savage blade/halone or skull splitter/chopping block or whatever DRK uses, as soon as you hit a second target with an enmity strike you just press whatever button you have bound to ""2"" and it's like magic. As soon as target ""1"" dies, tab back to ""2"" and mark it back up with ""1"" and repeat as necessary. One full rotation of your enmity combo with a tanking stance active on top of a flash or overpower gives you all the time in the world to mark without ever having to worry about losing hate, short of the ninja smoke bombing you and limit breaking.   Gladiator?  /macroicon ""Shield Lob""  /mk ""attack1"" <t>  /ac ""Shield Lob"" <t>  Marauder?  /macroicon ""Tomahawk""  /mk ""attack1"" <t>  /ac ""Tomahawk"" <t>  Dark Knight?  /macroicon ""Unmend""  /mk ""attack1"" <t>  /ac ""Unmend"" <t>  (Actually #4, numbering broke)  Even if end game eventually turns into AoE trains where the marks are made up and the HP doesn't matter this system is still very welcome in LLR content and effective in teaching newbies how to manage threat."
ffxiv,3dybaq,Jubez187,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:04:52 2015 UTC,"The point is that if you are keeping aoe threat, there is no reason to mark.  Marking is completely useless outside of very specific conditions where it's necessary to kill something first  Out of curiosity, if you are keeping aoe threat, then what reason do you have for using marks?  Also, it's not always the best opener to use shield lob etc as your GCD will be up when you make it into the patch of guys. Situation dependent of course."
ffxiv,3dybaq,n1n384ll,0,Tue Jul 21 01:15:51 2015 UTC,1 sounds like the tank's fault in how they use marks. I use marks so the DPS focuses something down which lets me focus on keeping enmity throughout the pack.   Any difficulty with AoE sounds like another symptom of a tank trying to do single-target tanking  Sure. It's gonna take a touch longer.  Sorry? Often I'm more concerned in just completing a dungeon smoothly. Rather than trying to finish 6 runs in 2 hours.
ffxiv,3dybaq,tigerslices,4,Mon Jul 20 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"You can use marks all you want, but there is really no need to use marks. I've tanked many lower level dungeons and it's very easy to hold threat on a pack while your DPS are taking care of two targets.  As for keeping the run smoothly, without a doubt my smoother runs have been markless and the ones with marking often are less smooth/take much longer.  If it's more smooth for you to mark though, that's great. I just hope that we don't have to DF together, as we clearly play differently.  The only time that I could see it useful is if you have certain pairings which amplify each others damage. i.e. a BRD and DRG, but this is only useful at higher levels. This shouldn't require marking, and the DPS should know how their jobs work and DPS accordingly."
ffxiv,3dybaq,misterwuggle69sofine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:20 2015 UTC,Correct! Dps and healers just expect PLD to be a flash bot. Just check your aggro if someone is using aoe or going rogue
ffxiv,3dybaq,Insentia,2,Mon Jul 20 16:29:25 2015 UTC,"Coming from all sides of the fence, I feel like there is also some responsibility on non-tanks to check their threat too and switch targets if they are gaining too much threat on a target"
ffxiv,3dybaq,misterwuggle69sofine,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"it's all the dps fault. :D  there's very little reason to lose aggro, and it's annoying to try to win it back in a mid level dungeon when a bard is loosing multiple attacks at once  while running away from it.  ...of Course you have aggro, bard... i'm not even going to take it back in that case.  learn to manage yo brd skills"
ffxiv,3dybaq,Insentia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"I love marks no matter what role I'm in. As a DPS I prefer not to be a pain in the ass for my tank/healer and when things aren't marked it's a pain to monitor what the tank is focusing on. As a tank I prefer to be able to focus on mostly one target with only occasional AoE for the healer since most AoE threat has its drawbacks (Paladin is a huge damage loss and Warrior is a huge TP drain). As a healer I'd rather monsters die in order so it's safer for me to contribute to DPS rather than having to heal the entire counter because there are 4 things attacking the tank from start to finish.  It's not a huge difference in the end, but I find marked runs to be much easier and much smoother with no real downsides. No marking puts certain dependencies on your teammates who may or may not be competent in DF, such as a tank that can't hold AoE aggro causing grief for both the tank (if they even care) and the healer (both annoying and a DPS loss if they're a good healer).  Edit: reading these responses it apparently looks like I don't have a very popular opinion. I still stand by it though, especially as I'm leveling my healers. Straight up healing bores me and I really prefer to be able to go back and forth between damage and healing when necessary, and it's significantly tougher to do anything but heal when the monsters are all dying at the same speed. Won't be much of a problem once they're all 50+ but during the leveling process it would be nice."
ffxiv,3dybaq,MercyOwen,2,Mon Jul 20 16:48:35 2015 UTC,"but during the leveling process it would be nice.   Especially there it doesn't matter. Enemies hit for so little damage there, that you can always squeeze at least your DoTs out (WHM/AST), or plainly stay in DPS mode all the time (SCH).  THe only important thing for the tank is, to hold threat and they should do so in lower lvl dungeons allready. Especially with Summoners and Black Mages... those can AoE from very early on and there is no reason they shouldn't, since it makes the enemies die quicker which in turn means less damage on the tank."
ffxiv,3dybaq,Insentia,2,Mon Jul 20 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"Ehhh that really depends on your tank and their gear. I'm down to getting my WHM/AST to 50 right now and I am very consistently having little to no time to do any DPS at all, especially during the last 41-50 leg of it.  As for the AoE damage, unless it's a huge pack (and it's usually only 3) it's not a gigantic damage increase at those levels. With a decent team that isn't specifically speed running I think you end up losing damage from the healer and the tank which can add up to being close to another DPS. If a Paladin has to use Flash and Riot Blade constantly because everyone is hitting everything, that's a decent damage loss. If a healer has to have 100% uptime on healing the tank, that's a decent damage loss.  Again it doesn't make a huge difference in the end, but I don't see the point in relying on strangers to be competent when marking can give direction and help to make things go a bit smoother."

I said marking with a bad priority is a bad idea and a pain to the other roles. Actually, it's even a pain for the tank, since the competent dds are going to attack the dangerous enemies first, even if the tank marks them as the last targets."

There's no real reason for melee or healers to be ""inconvenienced"" by marks, just tab to the ""1"" or click it on the party list."
ffxiv,3dybaq,tigerslices,2,Mon Jul 20 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"Melees can be inconvenienced by a mark. FOllowing scenario: 3 mobs marked, mob 3 does tons of aoes and tanks need to move: 1 keeps getting turned around, melee misses many positionals due to that. Those marks are placed dumbly and it would have been better if there were none."
ffxiv,3dybaq,Borealis116,0,Mon Jul 20 18:01:09 2015 UTC,"Melee would have missed their positions no matter what as the tank is moving.

ffxiv,3dybaq,Senven,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"A mob, that does aoes, won't move, if the tank plays properly. YOu move out of the AoE, and move in during the animation, while the mobs position is still locked. This way the mob doesn't turn, you evade the AoE and the melee hits their positionals. This, of course, isn't possible if the tank stubbornly marks this mob as the last target.  Once again, I don't know where you've got the idea from, that I think a kill order is a hassle, when I said that it's great, if the kill order is made with brains and not just by marking the enemies randomly into an order."
ffxiv,3dybaq,misterwuggle69sofine,3,Mon Jul 20 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"agreed.  as a tank, i don't see myself as the ""leader"" that's bullshit.  there is no leader.  the four of you are a team of equals.  you can't get through without heals.  you can't get through without tanks, and you can't get through without dmg.  ...okay you can get through but fuck it takes forever and you're might even drain mp.  as a tank, i open with aoe, maybe twice, run a combo through the multiple targets, maybe another aoe, but focus most of the combo on whoever has the most damage loss, because that's the target who's likely at risk of losing aggro to the overambitious blm or brd.  of course, you're cycling your combo around the whole mob with an aoe once in awhile, so you're checking your aggro status with Every enemy.  and grabbing enmity appropriately so you don't lose shit to the healer.  but ultimately, letting the dps down their choose their targets to drop and covering their backs so they can do it.  of course, all dps ideally aren't being dinks, and they're focussing on the same targets.  tanking is fun"
ffxiv,3dybaq,Chrystolis,3,Mon Jul 20 21:45:08 2015 UTC,"If your tank has to rely on marking to keep hate in a dungeon, you have incompetent and cowardly tank."
ffxiv,3dybaq,OwlG5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"I don't mark to keep hate. I mark because some dps don't know that attacking this target is going to give them more bang for their buck. If a single target does an aoe every 10s, and my stun is on a 15s cooldown that I require to dodge every other cone, you know what actually makes it easier for someone as a melee dps? To simply kill that target because  their position will remain static as I move back into position. They can hit the other targets if they want it makes no difference, but they're going to gain the most stability taking out that specific target. Especially relevant for new dps or low dps where taking that target out right then and there means I can drop tank stance immediately after and clean up. Less effort for me, less effort for them. If someone knows this I don't even have to mark because they'll jump on the relevant target without it being pointed out.   Or in a A2 DF where marking Boomtypes and Jagd Doll gets ""slower"" players on board right away.  Can go go forever without marking outside of low level dungeons hate is nothing, but it's more efficient to utilize marks and waymarks as situations arise as forms of in-combat communication without missing a beat.  You mark to communicate with players, if everyone knows their job or if one is feeling lazy you don't need to mark thats the simple truth."
ffxiv,3dybaq,Miewn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:00 2015 UTC,"As Senven already mentioned, that's not the point of marking. I don't think it's ever been the point of marking in any game. Optimally you mark the most dangerous targets first but even if it's a pack of 3 relatively non-dangerous mobs, marking can still provide direction for strangers and allow the tank and healer to more safely contribute more to DPS rather than babysitting. In lower levels (and when I speak about marking I'm mostly referring to plain old dungeons as trials/raids have their own rules) this can often more than make up for any damage loss from not AoEing, especially considering most packs of monsters are only 3 which isn't a gigantic increase over single target DPS."
ffxiv,3dybaq,Esdarke,0,Mon Jul 20 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"I think that was actually their point: that it shouldn't be relied on as a way to hold threat on multiple monsters.  Some tanks seem to use marking as an excuse to ignore later adds until their time comes up. It's understandable that people need to learn, but this in particular is a really bad habit for tanks to form.  While it's definitely more common in lower content (not surprising, since many of those tanks are newer to tanking), I'll occasionally run into a tank like this in 50-60 content, which is just kind of crazy to me."

I really don't like being at the front of the pack and having to deal with people attacking different targets and all of that. Keeping people alive is rewarding, so I'll stick with that, or maybe a DPS class every once and a while."

It takes a lot of time out of the dungeon and a lot of the time... tanks that mark are on some high horse and super anal.  You as a tank -should- be able too and -have- all the tools to manage hate check on -every- monster. Numbering monsters should only be used during raids and endgame content when kill-order is truly important. I'm not ridiculing you numbering but I personally do not think it is necessary for you to do so for -any- dungeon that is not an really an ""end-game"" content. Just say'n. Don't hate me please. :]   P.S. I do tank as a main. PLD is my first class that I have maxed out for both content. Also, if you're efficient at doing it, by all means go for it. ;]"

We'll either go to the next 1 after it dies or just aoe it all.   But then I'm an experienced player who knows every enemy in most dungeons so I already know what needs to die when. I fully recognize why kill orders exist so all I ask is  don't waste time marking every last enemy in a pull.

I loved them as a tank because they're the most reliable tank I've had and I feel safer healing them  They tried War out later and loved it, as a change of pace. They're thinking of lvling PLD again with 3.0 and post-50 changes and have been apologizing constantly for not having done so already whenever we queue A2. I don't know why, but we constantly get the worst tanks in A2, wont even try to take aggro off the healers or the DPS."

Kept flashing and using rotations. It wasn't good enough when every one else is level syncd. I swear I had to take a break from levelling it up and go back to my WAR because I now know how GOOD it is to hold proper aggro.  Honestly I thought the path to 22 would be moderately easy. But nope! Fuck that! Let's have the dps and healers become tanks!.  The moment I got provoke was the moment I fully celebrated mid dungeon. I felt like I was one mob pull away from being kicked because I the aggro meter was basically levelled with the entire dank party even after all my rotations.  Seriously, why the hell does gladiator get provoke only... and it's such an essential tool for even the casual of endgame. Ugh. It should be available for all tank classes. Never again will I touch my gladiators and I respect those who managed to get to 40 with it."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,TradiGlitch,2,Mon Jul 20 23:08:44 2015 UTC,"This is where cross class skills come in, and I don't really mind it since it means you have to try something new and usually one of the other classes is similar yet slightly different to the one you're getting the crossed skills for lets you get a feel for how someone else might be playing in larger party content somewhat.  At least, I think that was the goal. Warrior is nice because it can establish easy group hate with Steel Cyclone, Over Power, and Blood Bath + Vengence and with its focus on health doesn't suffer as much against magical bosses, at least from what I've heard. PLD is great because it has all the ""oh crap"" buttons but their self-heals are comparatively terrible. When it hits the fan an aware PLD can eek out more reliable survivability whereas a WAR will always be a rollercoaster of fun."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Gikamoth,32,Tue Jul 21 00:06:49 2015 UTC,"Having healed and tanked low-level dungeons, there's basically no reason the tank should be having that much trouble holding aggro off the healer unless they just aren't using Shield Lob/Overpower/Flash/their enmity combo/etc properly."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,numberonesuperguy,4,Mon Jul 20 18:02:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't dug into any of the tank roles yet...I would see flash pop up at the beginning of every mob, and he'd pull fine out of the gate.  It would be say from mid-way through each mob on that I'd start to pull from him.  Then it's a mad dash to keep everything together.    The frustrating part was as a healer I know to stay put because it's a bitch getting aggro back if the healer is running around to stay away from the enemies, so I'd pop the push back cast (can't remember the name off the top of my head) to get them away from me, and the tank would just let them keep coming at me.  I really wanted to type in all caps 'HOLD THE DAMN AGGRO', as he was bitching at me to quit healing so much."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,13Sins,11,Mon Jul 20 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"If they only used flash (or overpower for marauders) once at the beginning then they are either an inexperienced tank or a bad tank. It many cases you are going to want/need to use more than one AoE hate generation for a pull of >2 mobs.  Healing generates hate on all targets in a group (those mobs attached by a yellow cord above their heard when you target one mob).   Given that, if the tank cannot keep up hate on each target in the pull using just their 1-2-3 style enmity combo (1-2 style at Sastasha levels) after the initial flash then they need to use flash more frequently to compensate for that.  When it comes to tanks not picking up mobs, I have found running up and standing right next to the tank to drag the mob to them usually makes them take notice that ""oh crap I missed that one"" or ""oh damn I wasn't paying attention and need to grab that one back""."

If I just casually run up next to him while only curing myself will I pull aggro?"
ffxiv,3dyzrt,13Sins,17,Mon Jul 20 18:33:18 2015 UTC,"No, you won't pull aggro by proximity there. Tank has already face-pulled everything, at minimum, so they'll just keep biting on him until something else -- DPS, heal, etc. -- actively gets their attention."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Zoralink,6,Mon Jul 20 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.   Yes, because, you will still generate aggro from the other mobs tied to the one who is on you (assuming they are linked).  No, because, the tank will (maybe I say should) generate enough enmity to hold aggro on the single target he/she is focused on/using their 1-2-3 (or 1-2) enmity combo on.  Your range to the mobs has nothing to do with how much enmity you generate in FFXIV. being closer will not make you generate more via healing, at worst it will just mean you have to be mindful of not being caught in AoEs (which is why its best to not be in melee range when you're not actively being attacked by a mob that the tank has lost).  Something that many tanks will appreciate is if you see a ranged mob outside of the tanks current AoE hate range (maybe they didn't notice, maybe the do not realize they can pull the others there, perhaps there are 2 ranged mobs on either sides of the pull and they can only stand near one) you can run around to the back side of the ranged mob (basically so that the ranged mob is in a line between you and the tank) and then Fluid Aura it into the tanks range."

ffxiv,3dyzrt,clovermagic,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:16 2015 UTC,You're right. Thanks for explaining.
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Zoralink,6,Tue Jul 21 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"There is no range-based aggro in this game aside from the initial pulls, so sitting on the tank's butt is perfectly fine - as long as you're not getting cleaved or standing in AoEs.  It is generally the best thing to do if you grab aggro - run straight to the tank so they can grab it off you easier without chasing the enemy down and possibly losing hate on the others.  One of the biggest annoyances while tanking is having a healer who grabs aggro and then proceeds to run around everywhere but towards the tank to let them get it off.  That said, if the tank is truly bad, you're probably gonna be tanking that add no matter what, so just keep curing yourself.  I'd say the vast majority of pre-30 dungeons, heal-tanking is completely possible and something that can often happen if your tank is new or just bad."

ffxiv,3dyzrt,shuopao,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you run up to him and only cast heal on yourself, you'll solidify your hate on the mob. If the tank is flashing or using overpower, like they should be, the AoE ability will hit the mob. This is the main benefit of bringing the mob to the tank and it's one of the two methods I use to save myself at low levels.  This assumes the tank is paying attention."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,trichechus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:25 2015 UTC,"How does a tank get aggro? High threat attacks, most of these are short range. Provoke is a hard taunt (tank jumps to the top of the aggro list just barely), everything else is a high aggro attack.  Basically, you need to be in melee range if the tank is gonna do their job. If you have three enemies, they need to flash/overpower/whatever drks do. So you get close so they can do it.  Just think to yourself, what do kids do when they get hurt?  They run to their mom screaming 'MOMMY! MOMMY! IT HURTS! MAKE IT STOP!'  Works when you're a healer and dps, too. Run to the tank. If it helps, macro ""/p MOMMY! MOMMY! IT'S HITTING ME! MAKE IT STOP!""  Of course, not everyone is a good mother - or tank. But good ones will grab aggro off of you when you bring the mobs to them, and there are cases where this is a good idea to let the healer round stuff up and bring it to the tank."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,KendrikSergio,3,Tue Jul 21 04:40:52 2015 UTC,"on lower level content, a single cure can pretty much heal to full. heals are very potent then, so it's important not to overcure, since getting aggro through heals is much easier. you weren't overcuring though, and even if you did, holding hate as a tank is pretty trivial. it just requires a few flashes. one flash at pull will not be enough to sustain hate. at low levels, tanks should flash in between every combo, even double flash if necessary. so yes, the tank had aggro issues."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,shiverita,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"If you can do it correctly, using fluid aura can place the mob back on top of the tank. If the tank is doing poorly enough that it isn't enough for him to grab aggro I can only conclude bad on the tank (and kudos to you, correctly making use of fluid aura so that it is helpful is quite the technique). Mind you though, this only counts if the mob is back into melee range more or less. Screwing it up makes the tank's life more difficult instead."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Sutaru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:08 2015 UTC,That reminds me of the time I got yelled at for healing “too much” because the guy’s buddy was learning to tank and taking a lot of damage because he refused to use cool downs and flash and as you know healers get great threat for ONE heal in a low level dungeon.
ffxiv,3dyzrt,chili01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"Was he marking the kill order? In a low level dungeon like Sastasha, it's actually a lot of work to hold hate on Gladiator. I would usually hit Flash > Fast Blade > Tab > Savage Blade > tab > repeat. One hit on each mob plus a flash to keep myself ahead. The difficulty is if you have two melee DPS attacking different mobs. The tank will be able to stay just barely ahead of the party if the DPS are going after two separate mobs. Also, I didn't use medica in low level dungeons. It got me killed 2 or 3 times and I just gave up on it after that. Since the party is screwed if you die and you're going to pull a TON of hate if you use Medica, it was often safer to let the DPS die and hope the tank took hate before it killed you...  Sad, but true. :P  If the tank is telling you to stop healing so much in a dungeon (as long as you're not overhealing, spamming medica, casting regen at inappropriate times or other poor life decisions), he's dumb.  A lot of things can be slept. I used to often fluid aura mobs AWAY from the party (if they were attacking me) and repose. If the tank/party wants it, they can go get it. I'm not about to let them accidentally hit it with an AoE or something equally stupid and then get killed because of it."

Gladiator has probably a little more trouble than Marauder for holding aggro since Flash doesn't also do damage, but there is no reason why you should ever lose hate to anything.  There is nothing in this game that a properly played tank can't hold aggro from. Even a level 60 ninja in full i180 in a low level roulette Sastasha shouldn't be able to pull hate off of a Gladiator if the Gladiator is half aware of what his job is and what his skills do. It may be a little bit harder and you won't get that hilarious enmity lead like you will when you are fully leveld/geared, but there still is no excuse to lose hate as a tank especially not to your healer who is barely healing you.  I'm not a very good tank. I'm a healer by nature and have only during this year taken up tanking as a sub job. But even before I got my tank stances I never really had a problem with aggro, it's really very easy."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Litner,7,Mon Jul 20 23:43:16 2015 UTC,"Experienced tanks, yes. A new Gladiator with gray gear and barely any accessories, will lose aggro to a level synced i180 dps. I'm not defending bad tanking here. I'm just saying there is an uphill challenge at the beginning."

Level synced gear actually syncs down to the stats of grey gear at the appropriate level, which means that a level 60 ninja in full i180 is no better (except in skill maybe) than a level 17 ninja in full grey equivalent ilv17. This means that someone equipped with the green gear from Sastasha will actually have better stats. So this can factor in to the aggro issue."

(I can also keep myself alive and routinely tank all the bosses in Sastasha, so it's not really a problem, but still.)"
ffxiv,3dyzrt,rentisb,11,Mon Jul 20 21:45:56 2015 UTC,"Ok, so;   Which pet was the DPS using? If it was yellow, that's his own fault, as yellow is the tanking pet (whether Carbuncle or Titan-egi). If the same DPS wasn't using Sustain - assuming you were synced down to 18 or higher as that's when the skill's available - to keep their pet up, again, self-inflicted idiocy. Below 18 however (I believe Sastasha syncs to 17), yes, throwing a Cure at the pets will help.   As for the tank, if they can't hold aggro, they can't hold aggro. That's on them - 2-3 Flash casts, or 1-2 Overpowers or Unleashes (depending on job) should be more than enough to hang onto everything they're going to survive.  Hate needs to be maintained over time, and the tank will have to learn this to handle higher level duties. Over-healing is a problem as it generates a bit more threat for the healer, yes, but if a single Cure is enough to pull off them, they're doing something wrong.  Why did they blame you? No one likes to be in the wrong. Simple as that."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,cartoonhero42,9,Mon Jul 20 18:07:11 2015 UTC,"It was the yellow, yes.  I do not have access to that on my ACN (level 14 I think) so I wasn't sure how that one varied from the blue.  Not sure if he was popping Sustain or not.   I only over-healed once and I knew it as soon as it left my hand...I had targeted the wrong guy and he was at about 90%, I know that pull was my mistake.  No questions about it.  But the rest of the pulls I grabbed would be in the thick of it long after aggro should be established.     It was mostly DPS blaming me, as I'm not sure tank was up to speed on his role.  DPS was blaming me because when I cured the tank at 50% or lower I would pull aggro and things would fall apart (because I had to focus on keeping myself alive...if I'm dead my number one role of buffing tank goes out the window.)"

ffxiv,3dyzrt,Leiloni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:56 2015 UTC,"While what people are saying is mostly true, i think in your case it is not.  From what you said, the tank was terrible, if you was pulling hate off him with a cure 1 after he fell to 50%, he isn't doing his job and is causing a lot of problems himself, if this means the dps are gonna start pulling hate off his main target then its not entirely their fault, its the tanks for being bad.  As for dps dying, this sounds like the cause, the tank was terrible and couldnt hold hate so dps had a choice of take hate or not fight, both terrible choices and the right one would be to take hate. Normally if a dps takes hate it'd be on their head to keep themselves alive for the most part, but with a bad tank (especially in a dungeon as low as sastasha) it's actually easier (and better) for the healer to disreguard the tank and treat the dps as the actual tank, they'd probably do a better job AND make your job easier.  As for the ACN using Topaz Carbuncle (tank pet, i.e. Voidwalker), if the tank was as bad as you say, this would have actually made your job easier to again disreguard the tank and treat the ACNs pet as the actual tank, the ACN may have thought you was gonna do this which is why he was bitching. Normally using a tank pet is fully their fault for all the consiquences, but in this case it sounds more like they was trying to make your job easier and make up for the bad tank and as other's have said, they don't get sustain (proper pet heal skill) untill 18 which isn't possible in sastasha, so they couldnt keep it alive easily anyway.  Now, as i said, normally people here would be right, it would be the dps's own fault for the pet choice and stealing hate, but with a terrible tank they may have actually been trying to make your job easier, especially the ACN using the tank pet, so keeping it alive would have been better for everyone."

(Personal phrasing there, tag is whatever gets initial aggro, cluster point is when all the mobs have gathered into the tank's AoE range.)"
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Talran,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:57 2015 UTC,"Not only did you have a bad tank, you had a terrible arcanist. For dungeons you never use your tank pet, you have a tank for that.   And as a low level gladiator, if you aren't spamming flash and mp regain combo you wont hold hate, period.  None of this was your fault, even the occasional overheal aggro is fixed with a flash or two. Your tank just didn't know how to do that"
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Wash_Manblast,5,Mon Jul 20 19:39:57 2015 UTC,"Okay.  Normally the only case where a tank will lose hate to a healer is if it is a bad tank. The exception is of course overhealing, but it sounds like that was not the case at all.  Tanks do not get many of their emnity tools until higher levels. In low level dungeons it can be very easy to lose hate if your two DPS are not hitting the same target. It helps a lot in leveling dungeons for the tank to mark which mobs he wants to be focused."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Talran,2,Mon Jul 20 18:08:05 2015 UTC,Alright that's good advice to give tanks that aren't keeping it together.  My ACN DPS was just attacking whatever the F he felt like for the majority of the time.
ffxiv,3dyzrt,footfoe,2,Mon Jul 20 18:18:55 2015 UTC,"And ACN/SMN will do that- they are a dot class so they do the best damage by dotting everything. I do think that if I'd been that ACN though, I would have started to just dot one mob and burn it since the tank was obviously struggling, but then again the tank needs to learn to keep AOE threat eventually. :/"
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Talran,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"More experienced tanks that are downleveled in DF for a low level dungeon generally fare much better. However new tanks are notoriously bad at keeping threat at low levels. If you see a tank that is not level synched, typically expect to have aggro issues unless he proves otherwise. That's aside from the tank Carbuncle that your dps apparently had out lol."

If I read things correctly it sounds like the tanks opener was ok, but his follow up rotation was lacking AoE and not appropriately spread. Based on the pet taking aggro half the time it is likely the tank was distracted battling with the yellow carby for aggro. Getting into that fight is a mistake on the tank's part but handling it appropriately especially if the owner of the pet isn't maintaining it is not exactly easy.   For reference the appropriate solution to that situation as a tank is to maintain position as second threat on the mob the carby is fighting till it dies and make certain you are holding the rest of the mobs. In short, put out aggro as if the topaz carby just doesn't exist."

ffxiv,3dyzrt,sheepcat87,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"It sounds like people weren't doing their jobs and wanting a scapegoat.  WHM does tend to pull more aggro then SCH (no experience with AST yet), but once you get Shroud of Saints, that will help a lot.  The tank shouldn't lose aggro to a few Cures, though.  As far as dps pets pulling aggro-that's on them.  Was he/she using Titan?  I've seen that a few times in early dungeons.  As far as I can tell by your description, you're doing fine.

ffxiv,3dyzrt,Stochastic__Process,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"Tank should be using flash 2-3 times at the start of the pull, not just once. It's as simple as that."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Syntaire,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:00 2015 UTC,Tanking in FFXIV is harder than it currently is in Wow. Yes they actually have to work to gain/maintain threat. BUT they can do it easily if they work at it. You healing a Damage dealer and getting aggro or healing the tank and getting aggro is NOT your fault.   This is not FFXI where a heal @ the wrong time = boss/mob moving from tank's position.
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Parsley_Sage,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:04 2015 UTC,"Was the ACN being a moron and using the orange pet?  Topaz Carbuncle is a tank pet, so it'll fight for aggro with the tank. If they were using Emerald properly, ACN who multi-dot are highly likely to pull hate in low level dungeons because tank skills eat up TP very quickly, which makes it harder to hold AOE aggro. In low level, honestly, I just heal whoever is tanking, because a lot of people are still learning, so it's less about blame and more about getting through it."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Parsley_Sage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:42 2015 UTC,looks like you're doing a fine job.  the tank most likely was not cycling the mobs he aggro'd with their rotation so when you healed you would grab whatever aggro he decided not to keep aggro up.
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Obidon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:06:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're more or less on the right track, sounds like the tank is the one missing something, namely flash/overpower/unleash.

Low level dungeons shouldn't be giving you that much aggro issues. What it sounds like is not only was the tank failing to cycle through mobs, but the DPs weren't focusing on the same mob that the tank was, hence why they were grabbing aggro."

If the tank is brand new I get it, but do experienced Tanks not have some important skill because of level sync so they don't know how to hold aggro without it? Honest question since I know very little about tanking"

Even going back to that dungeon as a level 26+ GLD with cross-class skills, it was still tough to generate and maintain hate. Flash was basically the only power I had at the time that generated AoE enmity and you don't get access to Taunt/Provoke until level 22. The only other two powers that generate additional enmity are Savage Blade and Shield Lob, which are single-target attacks."

Tanks are missing a lot of their real threat holding abilities, including their defensive stances, until around level 30-35. I think Paladins don't get theirs until 40. A lot of them don't seem to understand the importance of Flash either.   As for DPS being on their own, that doesn't really fly in FFXIV. There's very little self-healing available, and not much by way of damage mitigation either unless you're a tank. There's also no reason a DPS should be pulling aggro from a tank on any trash pull, so that's the tanks problem, not the DPS'."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,LunaMana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:41 2015 UTC,"Also, the tank couldn't seem to hold aggro for some reason. If I waited to cure him when he was at about 50% I would then grab aggro from a few baddies and would have to focus on myself to stay alive while the tank tried to get aggro back.   Ah, a few? Not all of them? It's the tanks fault, he needs to be doing more AOE since healing aggros everything that's attacking the person you're healing not whichever mob he picked arbitrarily to be the first one to die.   His thinking (probably): As long as the DPS only attack the one I'm focusing on then we'll be fine. If they don't then they're stupid DPS. Someone drew aggro. They're stupid.   As a low level PLD you'd probably want to go Shield Lob (on the first mob) -> Flash x 2 -> Rage of Halone Combo x 2 -> Flash x 2 -> MP Combo.  Two things I will say: DPSing out of Cleric Stance is kind of a waste of MP, you should probably get used to switching stances as soon as possible. Also, I don't know how it is in WoW but there's going to be a lot of unavoidable damage/damage the DPS will fail to avoid later on in the game you can't afford to let them die since raising someone from the dead takes ~1/5 of your MP. They're lowest priority but they can die even if they never pull aggro and never do anything wrong. It's not in your best interests to let them die even if they did fuck up and it's all their fault."

I didn't want to stumble into a massive screwup because I was in and should be out, or vice versa.  Good to know about the DPS thing, like I said in an edit:  In WoW if you knew what you were doing you could pretty much stay completely out of the way with certain DPS roles, and still be incredibly effective.  There were many runs I did that I didn't take aggro one time or use healing of any type, I will keep more of an eye on them from now on.

ffxiv,3dyzrt,DrunkenSpoonyBard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"I can tell you what happened by the DPS that kept dying. ACN is like an Affliction Warlock, they dot all the things. If the tank wasn't using their AOE threat move pretty liberally (flash/overpower), he WILL pull threat, followed by you since you're building threat on all of the mobs just by healing at all. Tanks should also start learning to tab target and go through their rotation on each mob when in a pack- admittedly at low levels they don't have the last part of that combo that really gets threat, but still- good practice.  At lower levels an occasional faceroll dps will be able to pull, but they should have the courtesy to stay by the tank and not kite across the dungeon so the tank can get it back.  Healing threat is really a thing in this game, and it hasn't been for awhile in WoW. When you get Regen(renew) at higher levels, don't pre-hot before a pull, initial aggro is a big thing. The raw healing power of WHM is enough that on certain fights, if a tank cannot keep 100% uptime on the boss, I will begin to edge him in threat pretty quickly."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Skadix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"Was the ACN using the orange pet? Because if so that'd be why he was pulling aggro, as it's a tank pet. When they do tell them to put it away, they're a dps they should have their damage pet out. (blue carbuncle)"
ffxiv,3dyzrt,shatter1819,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"With regard to your second edit: In this game, the burden for holding agro is generally with the tank in the party. DPS don't get actual agro-reduction abilities until the mid levels and it's mostly only for early in the pull and guarding against occasional high burst moves and making it easier for the tank to grab stuff back if you have ripped it off. Unless the DPS is running ahead of the tank and/or shooting things before threat is establishes or ignoring an explicitly marked kill order (Or, as I see further down, using Topaz Carby when they shouldn't), the burden of agro problems does not lie with them. Their ideal situation is to be able to pump out as much DPS as possible without having to worry about the threat it generates.  That said, in early dungeons, the Tank doesn't have all their late-game tools either, and is probably still learning to use the ones they have. If the tank can't hold mobs and isn't willing to take advice, you and the DPS will have to try to compensate."

However...   ...there's no reason not to heal dps who pull threat, especially in sastasha where the mobs don't hit hard at all. I will heal dps who pull hate in any dungeon through level 60. If I die from healing aggro after healing dps I was going to gain healing aggro regardless and I'd rather take my chances.   If you pull hate stack on the tank. Flash/overpower only hit from melee range. Do NOT run away. You don't have this spell yet but I will stoneskin myself and try to stop healing until the tank can get hate off me."

I admit I ended up just tank-healing almost half of the rooms because it just made it easier for everyone else.   I'm learning that DPS isn't nearly as self-sufficient in FF as it was in WoW, so I admit maybe I was expecting too much out of them this early on.  I usually do heal DPS, don't get me wrong.

When I would get synced down to those first three dungeons as a BLM, I would frequently get aggro because there are just tanks that cannot hold hate. I don't typically have access to my one aggro management CD and oftentimes it is just easier to heal through the pain at low levels.  This is especially true since nothing hits hard enough that you even need a tank at those low levels.  And when I say trouble holding hate, I mean on the sub bosses of Tam Tara I could barely touch them without ripping aggro even after giving the tank a couple rotations to get ahead.

If I had kept up with him everyone else would have suffered, he needed a cure every 10 seconds or so.  (Under 50%, not a top off)  And yea, I eventually did end up healing through the pain as you put it.  Our first run through Sastasha it was obvious as hell that the tank was new (which is fine I don't mind teaching, if you listen, that is) so I just heal-tanked myself (grabbed most aggro) everything except for the final boss so everyone else could learn a little about what to do.

I dinnae if you are new to the game or not, but assuming ye are new, you should be able to get some friends to play with, it's always better with friends ^  The tank clearly had issues holding aggro, and I personally throw a regen/cure on dps pets every now and again but to be fair, they can easily keep it topped up."

I have a ton of WoW experience, but the enmity stack is quite a bit difference relative to healers.  (In WoW healing hasn't garnered aggro for a longggg time.)  I told my FC about it last night, they are gonna give me a hand this evening before the servers go dark."

ffxiv,3dyzrt,losian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"Low level dungeons in a nutshell. Lower level Gladiators have horrible enmity generation, but it's still possible to hold hate if they know what they are doing. A healer should never be puling hate in those dungeons, even if you're overhealing. Your mana pool will run out long before the tank runs of out the TP/MP required to hold hate on those mobs. As a Gladiator especially, they should be using flash periodically over the course of the fight instead of just at the beginning. If they're blaming you for healing too much, show them what happens when you don't heal enough ;)  Arcanist DPS largely relies on attacking multiple enemies, though because their enmity is split between them and their pet, they generate a lot less enmity that other classes, just usually on multiple targets, which flash can easily compensate for. If he was using the yellow carbuncle then he's shit. If yellow carbuncle is dying, he's shit. If he wasn't microing green carbuncle to attack the correct target, then he's shit, though green carbuncle should never pull enmity, as it does less than 1/3rd of the dps of other classes. If green carbuncle is generating more enmity than you as a healer, pat yourself on the back because you're playing very well.  With that said, if your tank loses aggro, you should keep whoever pulled aggro alive if you can afford to. Letting them die will just make the dungeon take longer. With how easy it is for tanks to generate enmity in this game, a DPS should never have to hold back unless there is a huge gap between their gear and that of the tank (provided they are attacking the correct target)."

Read up on how aggro works in this game; it's a bit different than WoW. But, some things to keep in mind when doing dungeons below level 40:   No Tank stances. This means nothing to a good tank, but ""new"" tanks will have trouble holding hate because they might not understand how hate generation works. Healing grabs aggro from EVERYTHING within the area of the target you healed. If your tank doesn't know how to hold hate, then YOU be careful. Also, stop healing if you have aggro, the more you heal the more aggro you will be generating and the more trouble it will be to get the add off of you.  Low Level Dungeon Roulette with higher geared DPS players. They WILL rip aggro from the tank if the tank isn't geared themselves, so don't get too upset over this.   But as some mentioned, was probably just a new tank/dps."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Maestar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"You're not doing anything wrong really.  The tank is lacking tools to grab aoe threat basically.  Depending on his class he would need to invest in other classes to get some cross class skill love which CAN help depending on what class the tank was.  If both the healer and dps are pulling aggro off the tank then there is your problem.  I bet your tank was a.....gladiator i think....and didn't have flash yet so they had no way to get aoe hate to combat your hate generating heals.  Its the first dungeon, don't worry basically.  As tanks get more tools it gets easier."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,Gikamoth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:35 2015 UTC,"You're fine. The n00b dungeons are a real shitstorm when it comes to wee tanks and DPS; the tanks don't have much ability to grab/keep aggro at that level, and most wee DPS tend to think they can tank and suffer pretty badly for it. Pets are also reeeeeal good at snagging aggro...  Don't worry, it'll get better."

ffxiv,3dyzrt,MannToots,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like reading through all the replies because there's a lot, so I'm sorry if any of this has already said.  Basically, it doesn't sound like any of the aggro issues were your fault. The DPS really didn't have any room to talk. Also, since he's an Arcanist he can easily jump in and help heal (himself or others) when necessary. I totally agree with what you're saying about the DPS fending for themselves-- as a DPS main, I'm always aware of the aggro bars, and if I see myself getting close to pulling hate, I know that I need to back off. On low level dungeons or against mobs I know are about to go down soon, sometimes I'll just power through it and there won't be any problems, but I'm still aware of it.   Tanking early on is actually a little bit difficult in this because you don't have too many tools at your disposal. I've noticed it's pretty common for tanks to lose hate pretty easily (within moderation) early on, especially if the tank is actually new to tanking. Regardless, as a CNJ you should be in cleric stance and helping DPS from time to time, and it sounds like you just were unable to do that because threat management was all over the place.  Anyway just wanted to let you know I don't think you were in the wrong at all! Hopefully you have better dungeon experiences in the future lol."
ffxiv,3dyzrt,MannToots,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"Unless you have regen on the tank when he's pulling, if the tank loses aggro to the healer it's the tank's fault. Period.    That being said, there's no reason you should have to let dps die, unless everything is so crazy that you have to make a choice between them and the tank.  In low level dungeons this should never happen, unless your tank is pulling far to many mobs and can't hold aggro on them.  However, there are going to be a lot of times when you will have to heal the dps, either because they suck at dodging or because they're taking unavoidable damage (which will happen a lot later on)."

When I see us coming up on it I use the standard rotation found in the ""Shots fired"" thread though I start it earlier so that my wild fire lands right as it switches. This insures that wildfire  goes off before he jumps again.  From there I just use my cd's as they come up but save rapid fire/wildfire for burn phases.  Gauss only comes off for orbs.  My static pushes phases extremely hard so you'll get different milage out of your CD's depending on how the fight progresses. But just worry motly about going ham during that first burn phase."

ffxiv,3dz1f7,jessicaredding,4,Tue Jul 21 16:44:24 2015 UTC,"This is very interesting and I look forward to hearing reports on what else may bypass the stoneskin in Ravana.  My initial guess would be that this is a work around in their programming. If you fester a target with no DOTs on it, it does no damage, and you do not get a stack to build toward your dreadwyrm trance. It would not surprise me in this game to find out that if your fester does 0 damage due to a stoneskin, you also don't get a stack.  My GUESS would be that this is a workaround to not punish SMNs and cause then to let their stacks drop."
ffxiv,3dz1f7,Levia7,4,Mon Jul 20 18:16:02 2015 UTC,"You're right. As a SMN, you don't get DT stacks if either Bane does not transfer DoT's to another target or Fester does 0 damage. A while ago Fester would do 0 damage and you would not get a DT stack while Warlord Shell was up, even if DoTs were applied to Ravana. Last patch or the one before they ninja fixed it so that Fester goes through no matter what as long as DoTs are on him so that it doesn't mess up your Trance/Aether rotation."
ffxiv,3dz1f7,Levia7,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, great that clears things up! Thanks  but, any idea if Fester helps break the shell?"
ffxiv,3dz1f7,jessicaredding,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:04 2015 UTC,I'm not sure honestly. I would assume it would because it'd be a little silly if it didn't and an oversight on their part.  It'd really be a hard thing to test.

ffxiv,3dz1f7,razzker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:19 2015 UTC,I think Meant to say that I assume you get a stack if it does 0 damage. T4 would be a good place to check.
ffxiv,3dz1f7,cittabun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:14 2015 UTC,"Energy Drain and Painflare deals 0 damage, but still gives me stacks. However, Fester (and Bane) is different because they need their effect to ""trigger"" in order to receive the stack."
ffxiv,3dz1f7,razzker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:08:24 2015 UTC,"Not a bad guess for sure.  Best test that I can think of is testing Fester on the final boss in WoD when her stoneskin is up. Unless it's changed, it definitely gave 0 damage on fester until broken."

ffxiv,3e1ks0,gyllespie,3,Tue Jul 21 06:37:30 2015 UTC,"I made my own FC, since I felt like it'd be a far more rewarding experience in the long run. It took many months to get things together, between helping friends catch up on content, raising money to buy/decorate our house, and set up weekly events, but it's been a fantastic experience. If you don't mind the work, it's a fantastic experience.  Otherwise, I'm not sure what to tell you- I would try to avoid 'noob trap' FCs. I usually take it as a red flag when I see very large FCs (100+ members) spamming shout chats and inviting green leaf players out of the blue. With the way FCs work in this game, having new players in the FC generates company credits pretty quickly, and people who run those sorta groups are usually just looking to get EXP buffs and other shit off of you for free."

I would say that it is kind of like dating, you might not find the right one right away or you just might, you never know.  Dealbreakers for me would be trying to join a social FC and being gated behind a long application process. I also am not fond of FC's that random invite and then no one talks, I love talking to people and it is the best part of a game for me.  Just roll with it and don't be afraid to ask them for help and make sure to give help if you can when asked, also join in on the fun times or fun runs and get to know them and let them get to know you. Doing all of that and you should be set.  Good luck though :D !!"

Stayed with them because of networking within said FC long after said friend stopped being friends and jumped servers.   Fc's are like shoes honestly, you'll try a bunch on till one just fits. Everyone has a story, so go shop around and come back and tell us yours.   What really grinds my gears? New people who expect to get clears just because they join an FC. It's even worse when they're very vocal and blame everyone else around them for not being able to down content. So please don't do that.

ffxiv,3e1ks0,Vaguely_Saunter,2,Tue Jul 21 06:45:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly I got a random invite to my FC and just went with it to see how it was. Figured if I didn't like it, I could leave. Wound up liking it quite a bit for about a year, then the leader kind of started going crazy (really focused on recruitment, was bringing in a lot of people who.. I just didn't mesh with well at all). A bunch of my friends split off and made a new FC and I followed them a bit after.   I've since recruited a few people in my FC, but mostly I just go around, help out people when I can, and if I notice they're not in an FC I bring it up. We don't really do the whole advertising thing. I'd say just keep playing, as you go through content with other players, ask them a few questions about their FC every once in awhile. If you find one that sounds interesting and get invited, feel free to try it out, if it doesn't work, feel free to leave. :)"

I have seen people join, leave, and sometimes re-join.  sometimes they say why they leave, sometimes they don’t.  i’ve never witnessed hard feelings from the FC or the officers and I’m sure it's the same with other FC leaders.  There’s an implicit understanding that every month we’re spending time and money on this game, so you have to look out for your needs first.  come hang out with us for a few days, if you’re not sure it’s right for you, scope out other FCs, and come back if we’re right for you, we’ll still be here."

It was really great, we grew up and got some nice people in there (and one asshole), but there was some drama at some time where I was the only ""officer"" able to connect everyday...and honestly I was officer only because I was one of the original members, I'm bad at managing people (too nice, not able to say stop, etc). It may have blew up a little.  So first advice : don't accept to manage anything if you don't feel like it. I wish it never happens to you, but when connecting to the game become a pain just don't stay in you FC, it's bad for your health.  Second FC, it was simply the FC my friends joined after leaving the previous. Not too big amount of people (8~24 connected most of the time), and also all kind of people. Crafters, raiders, tourists (well, for that one it might be just me).   So for a first FC I'd say to not go in the ""big"" ones, find a small-medium one, ask how many people are connected everyday, if they plan things for later, etc. Try it, and if you don't feel comfortable after some time don't hesitate to change. To find FC you can also try to ask around if you are in some Linkshells, etc."

You do know a good 90% of those gold selling websites are middle men correct? They advertise, spam and generally annoy people. The guys selling are bots that make 1/3 of what the gil is eventually sold for. If you want to be mad at anyone, blame the RMT websites directly.

When people are pissed at bots, they're pissed at them as an indication of the entire system, bots and the sites themselves included. Many times people referring to ""bots"" are also referring to the bots that spam tells at people, not just the ones directly earning the gil.  Also as to what have they (The ones earning gil) directly done? Well let's see, if the main issue is the sites selling gil, and they get the gil from the bots...  Huh. I can't possibly fathom this line of thought.  It's crazy how you're trying to act like people are in the wrong for hating bots."

Yes they are going all of the above, but is that money somehow indirectly yours? Prices on the markets are determined by the market.

I also have a warrior at 60 and i can tell you in any raid setting starting war as an offtank in deliverance, you must build 5 stacks of abandon before even starting your berserk combo, which lasts 20 seconds. youd have to literally ignore your opener as a bard to make sure the warrior has paean right at pull and even then it might not make a difference and the timer will tick out.   The Only situation where paean has any use at All and wont hurt dps is when you are in downtime during a fight, and the war has already built 5 stacks and doesnt have berserk on cd yet and is about to go into their 3 fell cleave zerk combo.   Because this is the only practical utility for an otherwise completely useless job skill, I believe paean is going to get changed."

It's boosted my Up/Down to double what it was before, which is nice, but I still have the same issues as before. Leading me to believe it was network issues. Though it's also possibily graphic related now too.  Seems something happened after they upgraded the graphics to the dx11 client for pc users. While I had heard there was something that was going to be done for ps4 users, I'm not entirely sure what it was and now it seems that running the game in HD is causing more issues than worth it. As much as I hate doing it, I may have to reduce my resolution to 720p and resize my screen.

The other classes/Jobs you can get are pure fluff and choice designed to do WHEN you want to do it. They only help you get one Job to 60 because that's all you need to progress.  I don't know why people seem to be under the impression that just because you CAN put all the Jobs on one character means they intend for you to do it.

ffxiv,3e1zyy,Sneakyf0x,2,Tue Jul 21 10:00:39 2015 UTC,"Very quick overview, but the number of support effects is minimal.  DRG: Piercing resistance down to increase Bard and Machinist damage, Battle Litany to boost party's crit rate. also feeble mantra via cross class. Good option for supporting the 'support' DPS, which are in the majority of parties.  SMN: better versions of Eye for an Eye and Virus for damage reduction. The only non-healer class that can revive in combat. Useful for progression/training in particular.  BLM: Apoc to reduce incoming magic damage on a single target. Access to weaker Virus and a longer cooldown Eye for an Eye via sub classes. utility usefulness outside of Eye for an Eye is very fight dependent.  NIN: Goad is an over time TP restore for other TP users, Enmity control moves added in 3.0, Slashing debuff (only dps that can apply) to improve tank damage, and Trick Attack to boost raid damage for 10 of every 60 seconds. Can help reduce the amount that bards and machinists need to 'sing' for TP regen ,and gives a small rise to raid-wide dps via trick attack.  MNK: INT debuff to reduce foe's magic based damage. Enhanced mantra to increase effectiveness of healing magic on party. The INT debuff in particular is incredibly useful against 'magic' heavy bosses, and mantra is excellent when recovering from high-burst raid wide damage."

Then there's this website: http://ffxiv.ariyala.com/Weaver For working out gear and applying melds to them to see how it'd fare. This is generally for 50+ crafts though but I still find it more than helpful (Just click the button at the top ""Disciple of Hand"" to switch between classes.

Also, try to get them all to 15 before working to get one to 50, as the cross-class actions are amazingly helpful when crafting.

Assuming you have a disciple of war or magic at level 41+ and have finished the Main Story Quest that makes you do Stone Vigil... pick up the Ixal Beast Tribe dailies (you need to start a quest in the Adder's Nest, new Gridania, to do those.) Their XP scales up with your level until you reach 50, when it starts scaling down. You can easily get to the stage where you can do 9 dailies without a lot of effort (and you have 12 daily allowances.)  Otherwise, most of the cross class skills given at 15 are fairly good, and past 50 or when you're out of ixal dailies for the day leves are a good source of XP too (especially when you HQ them.)"

Even though I was way behind my friends with more time, I never felt like I was lagging much. I feel like being able to play multiple jobs really helps with giving the game a lot of content, without making it unapproachable. My friends who play more hours a week have all of their classes to 50 and are pretty skilled at multiple combat classes. I can only really play 2 combat classes well, but I've still completed the same amount of quests and I'm actually farther than them in raid content."

The amount of 'daily' content rewards regular, short play. Personally I'd have enough fun paying for the sub just to do crafting and work the market board.  That being said, yes, if you hope to do current end game content, you will struggle to be relevant. If you're happy doing content that's a patch/tier or two behind you shouldn't have any problems, but remaining up to date takes a bit more of a time investment."

Yeah, bigger heals are nice, but generally smarter use of abilities will get you farther.

I find it helps a tonne.  While I've no personal experience with Alex 3 / 4 yet, it's helped me so much in Alex 1 that I can go from 6K MP back to damn near full with it.

ffxiv,3e1igb,Chaquei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:47 2015 UTC,I can vouch for this method. I do try to use any buffs with a duration to maximize the effect of Celestial Opposition but if you need MP then using it after Luminiferous Aether is not a bad idea. In A4 the only times I'm running low on MP are when I need to Ascend a few dead bodies or if avoidable damage is constantly not being avoided.   I say it is a perfectly viable use for Celestial Opposition if you need MP so try it out if you haven't already and see if makes a difference for you.

ffxiv,3e1igb,kyuriko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:51:47 2015 UTC,"I generally spend most of my time using Bene 1 and 2 in A4. I never really had much MP issues until the very end of the fight, pretty close to where the boss dies. Same as you. I don't know how SCH/WHM are, but I was drained of all my mana and they managed to throw out 2-3 rises and still had MP to heal. Crazy.  A good idea is to Spear yourself, put it in your spread, and use it with LA, along with a CO. and use ewers on yourself as well. This is one fight you need to really help yourself before you help others, especially if your DPS is lacking.  I'm going to assume you have a MCH/BRD using their mana song things? Because I haven't had that once in my PUGs, and I can tell you it helps so much it's crazy. It's also going to depend on your other healer as well, as they have to be quick to heal people up as well."

Lots of overhealing I guess? I only used aspected benefic on the MT (and other healer to help with the 3rd phase DoT) and aspected Helios when the whole party takes damage otherwise I used benefic 1 for everything."

Always keep Ewer for yourself, especially if you know its gonna be healing intensive. The only other thing I can think to say is trust in your fellow healer that they will have your back when it comes to huge damage spikes.  Also AST adjustments happening tonight, mana-gement might become easier depending on what has been changed."

However, back when I did WHM in T8 progression, I had a similar problem with my MP going OOM about when the boss hit 30%.  I decided to start using Shroud whenever it came up instead of when I thought I needed it (kept it on constant cooldown) and it seemed to work fine.  Not sure if it would work in this situation, but it was something I did and I know my WHM partner does this with Shroud when we do Alex but despite that will go OOM.  Sorry I couldn't give you anymore information that might be useful :( I just haven't had the chance to run my AST yet as I've been casually leveling her."
ffxiv,3e1igb,Sch4Life,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:18:50 2015 UTC,Synastry is your best friend on last phase to save MP. I find using it on the other healer during healers debuff helps a lot as it will make them concentrate healing tanks instead of you doing the healing since your heal will heal the other healer too. Popping lumini at this time too has generated my mp close to full on a number of occasions.
ffxiv,3e1igb,MsKirsten,0,Tue Jul 21 06:36:48 2015 UTC,"Ewer and spear (before luminous / dignity) on yourself, put into spread, and use it with enhanced/extended, also use dignity every time (excluding A4 last phase, save dignity on tank buster on A4 last phase).   I know that ewer and spear are RNG, but i find they are pretty common cards :)"
ffxiv,3e1igb,ronaldhw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:18 2015 UTC,It helps to be in diurnal sect to conserve mp. You dont use as much aspected benefic and the regen ticks allow more benefic1 use rather than resorting to bene2.  It could be your partner healer isn't pulling their weight or people are getting hit with too much avoidable damage. Even on Ast you shouldn't be oom at the end unless people die or you're solo healing.

ffxiv,3e0u45,djpr3tty,6,Tue Jul 21 02:37:32 2015 UTC,Not sure if you are aware.  Zeta's will not be used at ALL for 3.1 relics.  They will be a completely new chain.  Having a Zeta will only allow us to make something easier.  Many suspect this has to do with Geralt recognizing the effort we put forth and allows us to skip a minor and mundane entry quest for 3.1+ Relic.  It will probably be similar to LEGACY players skipping the very first part of the ARR Relic quest chain.

(Forgive me, I can't recall when it was.) I'm pretty hopeful we'll see more in the future as things go on.  They said they wanted to change Collective Unconscious in a way that was (somehow) similar to stance dancing. This change isn't that, it's just a sheer potency buff for Diurnal Sect so at the very least I'm pretty sure we'll see something more down the road. It's a step in the right direction for sure and so long as we see more change til a point where AST is just as desirable as the other two healers then I'll be happy.  Doesn't mean I'll stop playing AST, however. I love the job and I find it more than viable for most content, we'll see how it fares in Alex savage to ponder what new changes will come.  There is also a second part to 3.05 coming on Thursday, while it may just be for the Crafter / Gather scrips they may need just a couple days more testing on some other changes and we'll have to see if / what they roll out then."
ffxiv,3e1sbf,Chaquei,3,Tue Jul 21 08:25:46 2015 UTC,You misunderstood what he said.  It was a mistranslation.  There is no stance dancing coming.  Its that the spells themselves don't represent their stance as they should.  I.e. the spells would be getting updates to represent the stance they are being used in.
ffxiv,3e1sbf,Chaquei,-1,Tue Jul 21 08:28:27 2015 UTC,"Ohhh.  my bad then! I guess I can still be hopeful of more changes coming though. The only thing we can do is wait, see and let them know that we want balancing to continue beyond just this patch then."

It's all about getting maximum advantage when at a clear disadvantage (often in the form of gear/HP/DPS etc). This matters less when you aren't chasing glory titles."
ffxiv,3e1sbf,tonightslastsong,5,Tue Jul 21 08:57:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  This is exactly what I'm saying.  Sure AST is viable.  Sure 1000's of AST will get Savage cleared in the first month or two.

There's truth with the AST issues, no doubt, but for them it's about beating it, not beating it as [fill in the blank], and that's really point you're making.  I think it could be done.  But it won't be, because the week 1 progression and early clears will have precluded AST from the start.  It muddies the argument about ""viability"", but it ends up being taken as truth because ""look, all these early clears didn't use AST""  :'("

Until you actually start doing progression raiding, and we get some actual data on how AST performs in Alex savage, it's all speculation and opinion. Might be well informed, but it's not fact.

ffxiv,3e1sbf,clockwork-pinkie,3,Tue Jul 21 08:19:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying AST isn't playable.  I'm not saying people won't still raid just fine as an AST.  I'm saying if you plan to do real, serious, hardcore progression raiding such as going for world firsts and server firsts.  You would not under any circumstance take an AST over a WHM / SCH.  WHM / SCH simply do what AST does better in terms of healing.   Sure the damage buffs are nice from AST, but its not entirely consistent.  The changes to the cards, while insanely helpful, don't remove RNG at all.  You can still get Ewer 6 times in a row.  There isn't enough MP regen in the world that will make up for the healing loss you receive in clutch moments for AoE where a WHM would shine, or in clutch tank heal moments where that Adlo is the savior."

This is the key point. World/Server First are on a high speed train to get there, well, first. They need reliability and certainty, and the new jobs will put them at a disadvantage - not necessarily because they are weaker (or not) but because they are unknown variables. We know exactly how WHM+SCH will fare in any content or a PLD+WAR, so there can be less focus on learning how to play the new jobs (and play them well) in new content and more on the mechanics and strategy to win.   But for any non-first progression (those who just want to progress at whatever rate) will be the ones who will try the content with the new jobs and see how they go. My raid group prefers to let people just enjoy whatever, and so we're going in with our chosen jobs. If we feel a change is needed, we will do so then.   World/Server firsts will also probably switch it around once that title is claimed just to see how they do fare in the content, but that might be later down the road."
ffxiv,3e1sbf,Acilen,-3,Tue Jul 21 08:48:54 2015 UTC,"The same could be said about 4 of the other 12 jobs in the game. There's 13 jobs, 8 raid spots, and 1 ideal group composition..... Someone's getting left out from the theoretical ""best"" and always will.

ffxiv,3e0suk,Isredel,-2,Tue Jul 21 07:17:26 2015 UTC,"They'll be pretty screwed either way. If they don't, no one will do the old PvP because of the lvl 50 sync, unless it's forced into the roulette. Even then, I don't really want to play lvl50 stuff so I think me and most people would just skip the roulette after their one daily one, and just queue for the new lvl60 map. Not doing roulette also avoids getting stuck in a bad lvl50 lobby that would take ages to fill unless a lot of people are doing roulettes.  But if they do make them all lvl60, then the PvP population will be split into 2 maps. If it comes to the point where the new map has all the old game modes, and the old map gets the new game mode, then we have 2 maps with 3 game modes. So the PvP population will be split into 3 GCs, 2 maps, and 3 game modes? After the initial rush it would be impossible to get a queue unless the population starts to coalesce into just one map+game mode.  And then there's the option that the new PvP would still be lvl50. Well if that happens then PvP is deader then it already is, there is no saving it lol."

There's a lot of content, crafting, dungeons, and even some casual raids if you're into that.  3) 1 Character is all you need, since you can level every class on one character. The only reason you'd want an alt is if you want to experience story quests again or other reasons.  4) The expansion is not necessary. It's all level 50+ content. You won't really be able to access anything until after you reach level 50, and it's mostly endgame stuff + a continuation of the main story. I'd still highly recommend it, though.  5) Buying the game on steam gives you 30 days to start."

You can be every job on one character. I pretty much never touch any other characters but my main.  4) Almost everything in the expansion is locked until after you beat the main game, so pretty much none of the content in it matters as far as playing just the base game. Unless you really want to make an Au Ra character. (If you like the game and get to the end you should def buy it though, it's fantastic.)  5) You get 30 days free sub time."

There is no reason to have more than 1 character at all unless you want to RP or need more ventures. No. The expansion is 50+ content and you must complete the entire ARR story up to 2.55 before you can touch it. The only thing accessible pre-50 is the race. You should buy it when you hit 50 so that you'll gain exp from the level 50 main story quests - level cap requires the expansion and any exp you throw away will be gone for good if you don't own the expansion. 30 days."
ffxiv,3e0qkc,nightmarecandle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:29 2015 UTC,"To add to the points above: You definitely shouldn't buy Heavensward off the bat unless: 1) You know you're going to love the game, or 2) You really want to play as the new race (Au Ra, if you're interested in looking them up).  I say this because there is absolutely PLENTY of content without it, and you can't even access the Heavensward stuff until you have finished the ENTIRE main scenario questline.  Put it this way, I've done almost nothing but the main story since I started, and I just finished the final main scenario quest before Heavensward.  I've played 141 hours.  Don't spend the extra $40 on content that you won't even see for almost 6 days of in-game time, unless you are sure you're going to be in it for the long haul.  Granted, I watched every single cutscene and read nearly every piece of dialogue, but I'm pretty sure that if I had been skipping all of it, I still wouldn't be under 100 hours of playtime.  Anyways, that's just my opinion on the subject."
ffxiv,3e0qkc,TheNextWednesday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:20 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to play the Au'ra, DO NOT buy the expansion, it has literally nothing else to offer you until you reach level 50 and finish ALL the story quest and contents post 50 up to the expansion, which is literally well over a hundred quests, it takes days of dedicated effort, and that's if you're busting your buns to finish it. One character is definitely enough and, in fact, with the time it takes to do the main story and such, multiple characters get to be a bit prohibitive if you aren't really big into repeating those various quests!  The game is altogether pretty solid.. as for beginner friendly? Hit or miss.  And ping? It's HUGELY IMPORTANT. There are soooo many bosses, trials, dungeons, etc., which heavily rely on being very quick to react to AEs and whatnot, and if you end up missing them tons due to ping, you may get stomped. :("

ffxiv,3e2epp,ConnieNokomis,6,Tue Jul 21 12:56:38 2015 UTC,"I understand this is something carried over from WARs however WARs for one have a larger HP pool   DRK has -20% damage taken under Grit, just like a PLD does under Shield Oath. The HP boost on WAR is their version of that; they end up with a similar amount of effective HP and that's what counts.   Eg, a DRK comes in with 13k HP. They have an effective HP pool, under Grit, of 15,600HP.   And in content like the 4-man dungeons, that's more than enough HP. It's better to push out more DPS by using more STR gear than sitting on an excess of 3k HP because tank DPS isn't irrelevant (it is considered when designing content).  But it is up to the tank to understand that, if the party is slower at killing or the healer isn't as great, they should build themselves appropriately. Similarly, if they want to do bigger pulls, they should prepare for the possibility that they may need more HP.  It's about being responsible. You can do some content in all STR accessories. High HP is not always necessary. But that won't do much if the rest of the party is lacking (in skill or gear)."

ffxiv,3e2epp,Level99Caterpie,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:45 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's not all that heal intensive. It's just, there are certain times to focus heals (Discoid, orb collection), and extra VIT is eh for them if your healers are paying attention and/or if the tank is a boss.  Though I guess in a pug for A4, MT should probably wear a bit of VIT in case dps is low.

I'd say you should wear an appropriate balance of survivability vs damage, but judging this is not always easy."

ffxiv,3e0nsg,HitsuMitsuo,0,Tue Jul 21 12:31:35 2015 UTC,"CRP/BSM/ARM/LTW/GSM/WVR - Just focus on crafting mats, use food and the Exp scrolls to make things faster. Lumber, Titanium Ingots, Dhalmel Leather, Hardsilver Ore and Ramie Threads are the way to go.  ALC - Holy Water and Hallowed Water are your go-to mats. You can use 1 Hallowed Water for a certain Levequest for a ton of Exp.  CUL - Frozen Spirits. They're easy and cheap to craft, and you can exchange them for Scrips or use on Leves for extra EXP. You can reach Lv60 insanely fast with either method.  To make things easier, here's the Mats you need:   2 Old World Fig (2am/pm Node near Tailfeather. Slot 2) 2 Cloud Banana (12am/pm Node in the Hinterlands. Slot 2) 2 Yak Milk (Lv50 Venture item. Use them GC seals!)   Aside from ALC and CUL, using Leves to level can be a little bit expensive. Some items you need to deliver for Leves you can buy for ""just"" 10k from NPC's. Whether you see that as a decent expense is up to you.  Before making a GC delivery ALWAYS check the market. There's a chance that people will be selling failed HQ attempts or even HQ items dirt cheap."

Don't know if it gets better after 56 but it pretty much looks like I don't get him up as cheap as I did for 50. Any suggestions what to start on? (I have a hunting retainer for some mats, but he runs usually for the gelato)  edit: Yak milk is super expensive at Cerberus."
ffxiv,3e0nsg,plasix,2,Tue Jul 21 02:52:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm, can't really say. I level everything at the same time, so I usually don't have a problem getting the mats I need. (with the exception of Fisher... still haven't gotten it to 50, haha)  I think I leveled my Cul to 56 by crafting all the GC deliveries myself. You can get everything you need simply by having a leveled Botanist. I suggest using Garland Tools to check the recipes in more detail. Some items can be bought from NPCs and make things far easier. The Sahagin vendor sells Garlean Garlic and Smooth Butter, for example.  So I don't start blabbering a bunch of useless information, I'll just give you a few tips on what to focus on:   Have your DoW Retainer gather Yak Milk - It'll be essential for most CUL recipies. A geared retainer can get you 10 every hour, it's a lot if you're focusing on other stuff or doing gathering runs. Level your Botanist - A LOT of CUL require items that can only be gathered in Hidden nodes, thus making them rather expensive. Being able to gather up to 15 mats yourself can be both profitable and worth the effort. Don't do any Leves with the exception of the ""It goes down Smoothly"" Lv.56 Leve. (Frozen Spirits) - Anything else aside from that is rather expensive when you take the mats into consideration. Ignore them unless you're able to find cheap NQ in the market. Gear up your crafter and do the class quests. - A Lv55 HQ set is all you need. Get the offhands at 59 and then work on getting Lv60 gear. Do every GC Daily. - Can't deny that easy and free Exp. Farm scrips once Frozen Spirits are accepted as a Collectable.   Again, I can't stress the importance of that item when it comes to getting Crafting Scrips. I got 3 Masterbooks already and now I'm stacking up on mats to get the rest. Assuming that you're sending your Retainer to get 10 Yak Milk, you're able to craft 5 F.S. per hour.  That's around 100 Crafting Scrips and a ton of experience. If you're low on money, you can also sell them. A couple days ago I was making a lot by selling HQ F.S. in the market for about 75k a unit.   PS: Okay, some of that information was useless. Basically, level your Botanist and take your time! A geared Botanist will be your best friend and you'll save a ton of money. Don't buy items you don't need unless you're super sure that you can't craft or gather them yourself. Check the prices for the mats and if they're cheaper, ask a friend to craft them for you. Oh, and tip them, of course."

In regards to weapons, we removed accuracy from the weapons for all jobs. We did this to eliminate situations where you couldn't use a new weapon with a high item level because it didn't have accuracy on it. We've made adjustments to the required accuracy, so even without accuracy on weapons it should be easier to land hits on enemies."

When I get 4 synced people obviously just going for their tomes, it feels like I'm wasting my time a bit and we're all just like ""let's get this over with"". When I get new people, I feel like it's working as intended and I'm actually doing some good.  And of course, then there's getting Steps of Faith on Trial Roulette when everyone in the party already cleared it and is synced from 60. That is... one hell of a disappointment."

I can't count how many times i've come across players getting tomes that have either, A complained about killing ""unnecessary"" mobs, or B just leaving and or being abusive because its not going their way!. Low level was made for higher level players to help out newer players and get a reward for doing so, not so you can bend people to your own will and become a snobby little douche nugget.

I was dps in a group and realized I was doing the same thing to this poor green leaf tank and he was getting frustrated. I stopped mid-way and assured him he was doing very well (perfect for his level) but that it was harder/took more time for me to stop dpsing long enough to give him time to keep hate than it was to just kill the thing with passive defense buffs. The healer agreed, we bathed him in complements and I'm hoping he got everyone's commendation. I try to do that for every obviously level appropriate tank."

New people aren't jaded or bored. They don't act like they know everything, and they don't bitch if you do/don't full clear because they're stoked to be there.

One time i got a tank and healer sprout in satasha and we almost time out on Satasha because the GLD tank can't hold aggro despite me asking him to use flash in mulitple enemy while the healer sprout just panic whenever an enemy hit him and run away, so i ended up having to cross class cure and heal as THM."

Like many I was surprised that Square had decided they were not going to add any new servers.  I had a friend who'd been playing for a while (he imported the game on PC and was fluent in Japanese) and when the game launched he invited me to join on his server.  I can say that I've experienced the whole gamut from good players, bad players, friendly players to racist xenophobes.  I had a few Japanese players go out of their way to help me level they were really polite and while doing it spent a lot of time talking about our respective cultures and our love of anime.   Then there was a time I was followed around for about 30 minutes by a Japanese player who kept shouting YANKEE GO HOME!! Apparently he wasn't happy with US players on the same servers.  I had one JP player lose his shit because I liked the way his gear looked and wanted to see specifically what it was he was wearing and apparently it's frowned upon to examine a player without asking them first.  Course the game had only been out for a week when that happened.  Not like we're all going to know the social rules of a foreign culture instantly."

We eventually ran out of time and had to abandon the fight but close to the end a couple of the new guys said they were amazed that I stuck it out for so long.

ffxiv,3duul9,Daimakaicho,5,Mon Jul 20 06:29:38 2015 UTC,It's the same reason you aren't allowed to do LLR with a preformed party. The point is to make you party with strangers to help them out. Sometimes people get too focused on their own progression to pay attention to others.

ffxiv,3duul9,Ashenspire,4,Sun Jul 19 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"Length of the dungeon highly depends on the group. Are the dps good? Is the healer dpsing? (In low dungeons healers can pull as much dps as ""real"" dps.)  I've had both <20min and +1hr Temple of Qarn within the last week. First one had SCH spreading dots on everything with Bane and both dps going in hard. The latter had CNJ just standing there when there was nothing to heal and a BLM who apparently thought he was an ""ice mage"", never using a single fire spell. To be fair it also had 2 wipes due to bosses taking so damn long that the CNJ ran out of mana."

Not sure how DPS or tanks try to stay entertained."
ffxiv,3duul9,starwolf256,2,Mon Jul 20 00:00:57 2015 UTC,"As a DPS, I just like to push myself to do as much damage as possible. I always run a parser and try to beat my last damage.  Tanking is monotonous but you can always pull a few packs if you get too bored."
ffxiv,3duul9,FrankNico,3,Mon Jul 20 00:04:23 2015 UTC,"An arcanist at that level can really only keep DoTs up on 3 targets if I remember correctly. That means that the only jobs that can damage everything from multiple packs in Tam Tara are Marauder (Overpower [<15]), Dark Knight (Unmend [<15]), Thaumaturge (Fire 2 [18]), and Archer (Quick Nock [18]).  You definitely aren't saving time when you don't have THM or ARC and may very well be costing time if your healer is now not DPSing."
ffxiv,3duul9,GarlyleWilds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:01:02 2015 UTC,"An arcanist at that level can really only keep DoTs up on 3 targets if I remember correctly.   Well, yes, sort of.  Aero, Bio, Miasma on 3 targets is 9 casts, which is enough for Aero and Bio to fall off.    Two-dotting is good for 4 targets.  More than that and you just Miasma with Bio filler, switching in Aero when things are close to dying and enjoy your 240-300 potency per GCD.  CNJ just has Aero and benefits from more targets up to about the 8th.  (But damage doesn't grow as fast as number of mobs, so, yes.)"

In a bad party it's an adventure where I have to work my ass off to keep us from wiping and as frustrating as that can be it's when I'm also enjoying myself the most.  Win-win.

That was starting to irritate me because it was disrespectful to the new player, so I asked him politely to let the tank do his job no matter how boring/easy the dungeon was to which the dps and healer just bashed the tank for not being able to hold hate despite not even giving any advice to him. By the end of the dungeon, I told the tank that he did a good job and to just keep it up with learning his new role which I think made him happy by his positive response back to me.  I think experienced players need to realize that there are new players to this game who may have never picked up an MMO before and/or are still learning their jobs, skills, and mechanics, so they won't be perfect and there's nothing wrong with that at all. It might make Low Level Roulette slower than desired for most, but if you have a problem with that, then just don't queue for it.

Dude, if you want out, just quit and take the penalty hit.""  Him: ""No. I want my 80 tomes!""  Me: ""Then do the dungeon...""  Him: ""Why would I do that when the tank can't even gather up all the enemies and bring them to the boss room and...""  Me: ""Wait, a minute, what the fuck?

True to his word, that's what he did until we decided to just stop before the last pull before the final boss.

It's nice to educate those fresh players about the dungeons, that way the next time they're in there, they're pro at it. Plus, it's always nice to get into a group where you're talking and having fun with the people that you're playing with. Id take that over the silent/serious ex and high roulettes, where no one even says 'hello', anyday.  Sometimes it is really boring and slow, but whatever.

ffxiv,3duul9,cremedelapoop,2,Mon Jul 20 09:54:11 2015 UTC,"I will say that some of those early dungeons are really, really, really full of trash.   But IMO the most ""boring"" part is that you lose all your abilities. If I kept my abilities LLR would be pretty damn fun. Even though the boss mechanics are easy, at least doing a full rotation makes it doable. Just spamming fire then transpose gets kinda boring.   But still, that guy was a dick. You can leave without being a dick"
ffxiv,3duul9,firstsymph,3,Mon Jul 20 01:17:02 2015 UTC,"I hate that attitude. I was very new to tanking and doing low roulette and the highest level dungeons available to me, and got Copperbell. I had two new people plus a seasoned NIN. He proceeded to whine the entire dungeon because I wasn't pulling fast enough, even though I told him I was new to tanking and would pull as much as I could but wanted to take it easy on myself and the new people. He also pulled ahead and later yelled at the (new) THM who LB'd the last boss.  He spent the entire dungeon bitching that I was ""too slow"" and this was ""soooooo boring"" and when I said I was trying my best he said, ""Whatever, it's too late now anyway, we've already wasted tons of time.""  This is the kind of experience those people are willing to give new players? No doubt they'd be the same people complaining if their MMO of choice was empty."
ffxiv,3duul9,willibra,3,Mon Jul 20 10:22:23 2015 UTC,I like getting new people cause its fun to see someone get joy out of what they are doing compared to most groups that treat everything they are doing as a major inconvenience like this healer seems to. At some point people need to ask themselves if its really worth playing the game when most of what you do annoys you so much.
ffxiv,3duul9,worm4real,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:31 2015 UTC,We need a subreddit specifically for people to bitch in. But then I guess this subreddit would be nothing but OMG LOOK AT MY DPS QUEUE posts.
ffxiv,3duul9,JeckylTesla,3,Mon Jul 20 03:50:01 2015 UTC,"So basically fuck you healer, you weren't even using cleric stance anyway.   Unless it was a CNJ/WHM, at Tam-Tara level... you get Protect or you get Cleric Stance. You don't get both. Only 1 cross-class ability at that level. I generally have Protect in my 1st slot.  It's sorta funny, though, I was playing LLR on my 41 AST complaining about Tam-Tara today. I didn't bail or be rude or anything, cause I'm not a dick, but it's just so boring and it's every single day it seems."
ffxiv,3duul9,conativejj,6,Mon Jul 20 01:52:06 2015 UTC,"You can cast Protect at the beginning of the dungeon, then swap into Cleric Stance immediately after.  The game doesn't care if you can still cast Protect once it's up.  For maximum fun times, you can cast Protect, swap to Cleric, put it on, then swap to Aero and trust Eos to handle Tam Tara for you.  Works beautifully."
ffxiv,3duul9,Viandroto,3,Mon Jul 20 01:57:23 2015 UTC,You do not need Protect
ffxiv,3duul9,Battlecop,2,Mon Jul 20 09:59:10 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily disagree, but I've had numerous tanks who will not pull until they have Protect."

ffxiv,3duul9,zjnetil,2,Mon Jul 20 03:34:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think LLR is a very efficient way to get tomes, given how some low level dungeons can be really hellish if you get a bad group. I learned this from doing dungeons for my atma/animus books, e.g. Stone Vigil nm finishing within 5 minutes of the timer. I only run LLR for the xp.  That healer is not only a douchbag, but also not very good at optimizing his/her time."
ffxiv,3duul9,Milestailsprowe,2,Mon Jul 20 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"I also feel bad for new players that had to put up with Main Scenario Roulette Jerks claiming that new players are wasting their Personal time which nobody cares.

I always hope I get one of the primal instances whenever I queue for LLR, but I won't complain or abandon a dungeon, because that's what you sign up for when you queue anyway."
ffxiv,3duul9,zjnetil,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:58 2015 UTC,Small rant from me: I had a Scholar come into one of my LLRs while I was leveling tank. And the guy didn't do anything. He set himself to follow on our caster and let Eos do everything. That's it. He did nothing. I'd much rather have him leave than do that shit.

I have head of the LLR, and assumed the others in my group were more experienced.   In each group, everyone has been super awesome and even explained some of the mechanics when I didn't know was going on.   The community is fantastic in this game. You will always have a few bad people, but I am sure they are out numbered by helpful and nice people.   Coming from WoW, where the community is toxic, this type of system is refreshing. Higher level guys can get some meaningful rewards while showing new guys the ropes."
ffxiv,3duul9,Sakuja,2,Mon Jul 20 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"100% agree. Hell, just today I was doing Garuda for the first time. Both myself (WHM) and a DPS were new. Being used to WoW and my death causing our second wipe, I was ready for the immediate raging or vote kick. Instead, I basically get the more experienced players saying they were willing to go as long as it takes, helped explain mechanics and were patient with two newbies learning the fight. I think we wiped 5 times to it before killing, and then even got words of encouragement from the experienced guys saying we did a good job learning the fight. Was absolutely blown away. Ive actually been pretty lucky to have had only nice groups so far in roulettes, all the way to lvl 46 so far. Hell, just the hellos at the start of a dungeon have been a breath of fresh air."
ffxiv,3duul9,yoyothelala,2,Mon Jul 20 04:44:37 2015 UTC,"Started levelling my DRK. Few levels later, brayflox. As soon as we jump in, healer says ""Cya"" and goes offline in the hopes we boot him. We wait for him to return (moments later) and he gets salty about it and leaves. Yeah you take that 30 minutes you prick. Dont be that guy."
ffxiv,3duul9,Kananetwork,2,Mon Jul 20 06:33:08 2015 UTC,"LLR is insanely dull for a max level due to several factors.   scaled down levels, so you're missing some to most of your abilities (depending on what dungeon you get). the dungeons being much longer than level 50 dungeons (including their HM counterparts). pretty much every dungeon from brayflox to aurum veil consists of trash packs of 2-4 damage sponges 2 ""meh"" bosses and one decently difficult boss (the dungeons are very formulaic). if you're unlucky enough to get something from the 16-30 range, you'll probably fall asleep killing piles of trash in unending hallways and the ""bosses"" (glorified trash) don't even have mechanics.    i hope square ends up revamping most or all of the normal 1-49 dungeons because holy hell are they boring, and they aren't just boring because they're easy. new players might have fun but that's only because they don't know any better."

The only ones not part of that roulette are Odin (Urth's Fount) and Ultima Ballad. All of the EX trials are also not part of that roulette but just there for challenge at this point.   For the Bahamut dungeon (Coils) they are there for story, but there will likely not be many running them anymore with the new expansion raid (Normal version available now, Savage version available after tomorrow).   Also, you should unlock as many roulettes as you can as they tend to give more experience and/or endgame currency you need to purchase your top levels of gear."

However if you want to raid in 3.0 you will need to do the Ultima fight. The time it would take you to get the gear worth anything from ARR content will take longer than just leveling up in Heavensward. The gear is out of date by level 54 (I think) so I wouldn't waste my time. If you want the story from the content go back and curb stomp it when you get to 60

ffxiv,3dyd03,thecrowes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:41 2015 UTC,No DRG is doing 1100+ dps the entirety of neverreap. You need to check your parser settings and make sure you have the encounter set to 30 seconds to give an accurate parse
ffxiv,3dyd03,XIV__fan,3,Mon Jul 20 15:46:03 2015 UTC,"Just on bosses, mind you. 1100 is perfectly feasible in < 3 minute long boss fights where there's only about ~30 seconds of downtime total per boss.  Parsing on pulls have extremely varied numbers across everyone due to different tank styles and is imo, not particularly valuable information. Also because I actually forgot to ask him what he parsed for the entire dungeon."

If you stay your base class, you don't get access to a new skill every 5 levels from 30 to 50 and every 2 levels from 50 to 60. That's 10 valuable skills you're missing that entirely define the job and provide both utility and nice damage/healing. Plus, the job stone gives you a stat boost."

I know the wording is a little confusing, but ARR questions are just as encouraged as HW questions.  Almost nobody plays classes, unless they're with friends to see if they can clear X on classes.  The job crystals give you better abilities and a heap of stats.  The only downside to them is less cross-class abilities, but it ends up not really being a concern because you get better abilities for your role from your job crystal anyhow."

ffxiv,3dyd03,XantheDread,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:58 2015 UTC,"with the intent of going all the way to 30 so I can unlock Scholar   Without the Job stone, you are unable to heal effectively as an Arcanist. A SMN would wipe the floor with you because he gets access to many more powerful DPS abilities.  Typically, you'll get very powerful abilities from your Job that are by far stronger than what your cross class abilities offer. This is very apparant when you look at the cross class skills you would ""lose"" on a CNJ that you gain on WHM abilities like Tetragrammation or Assize."
ffxiv,3dyd03,Everspace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"No, you don't use the base class. You miss out on too many abilities and stat increases from the Job Stone.

However, at level 60, you are now losing 10 job actions instead. All of these are tools that help you perform optimally in your role (DPS buffs, tank stances, healer skills), so you'd be giving up 10 mostly useful things for 10 buffs that take away from the utility of your job.  Also, if you want to main SCH, you won't be able to play as an ACN past level 30, because ACN is a DPS role by default. :/"
ffxiv,3dyd03,lyerhis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:16 2015 UTC,"The reason you play as a job instead of class is:   Job will offer extra skills and abilities not accessible to the class Job boosts/buff certain attributes related to your role (such as more vit for tanks)   if you remained on your class ACN you would never be considered a  healer, nor would you get the mind buff needed to be a healer. Also scholar uses fairies to heal with. If you remain an ACN you will never have access to those pets. Just like SMN gets Garuda, Titan, and Ifrit pets for battle, but ACN would not have access to those either. The only benefit to a class over a job is you can cross class more skills from a wider option, once you take a job your cross class choices decrease."

I assume that in the majority of fights the tanks generally don't require that much mitigation/need to blind something instantly anyway  Finally, one more question, if there are adds present, should i be replacing the second painflare with Bane?

ffxiv,3e0k9h,wonderness,0,Tue Jul 21 12:09:11 2015 UTC,"Hi there! So basically you have a good general idea of what to do but here's what some of the others have determined:  You have a couple of options but your goal should be to get to DWT as soon as you can. Because of this, I use 1F-1PF-1ED (trust me) and cast swiftcast SF once/if the tank decides to not move around. Hit DWT with your pet buffed and then pop RS, do you thing with Painflare, then Fester, then Enkindle, Tri-disaster when your dots are falling off (if you have Garuda up, Contagion), fill your remaining time with Ruin 3 and Deathflare when convenient (end when you know the mob is gonna phase change).  Try to never hardcast DoTs when DWT is up, attempt to always have that Tri-distaster and I attempt to have my stacks for pf/fester during DWT. Of course, Hai Hai and others are better at explaining this than me.   So here's mine:  SC+SF > Bio 2 > Miasma > Bio > Rouse+Spur > 1F+1PF+1ED (or 2P/1F) > DWT (have Aetherflow stacks) > PF > pot > Fester > Tri-disaster (ruin 3 weaving throughout) > End of DWT, Deathflare > Fester"

Depending on your playtime, you could easily get a few crafter/gatherer classes to 50. Hell you could do a DoW class from 1-50 in a few days.    Did the expansion add any new content that I could be enjoying before I make my way to 60?    Nope, but to be completely honest with you, if you're thinking about getting the expansion, you might as well get it. If you don't mind leveling from 50 - 60 on SMN just to experience the story, you should totally do that. SE went over the top with the questline and its probably my favorite questline from an MMORPG.  Honestly though, you should check out some of the new summoner videos or their new abilities.
