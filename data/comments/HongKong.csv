HongKong,3dy4x5,HungryGeorge,3,Mon Jul 20 14:16:39 2015 UTC,Don't worry too much about getting around. HK is one of the most English-friendly cities in Asia because of the British colonization. Anyone under 70 years old will speak a some English if you speak slowly. A lot of the signs and public announcements are in English as well. The worst case scenario is that you get ripped off by the cab driver. How long are you staying? You should grab yourself an Octopus card which will allow you to take trains and buses.

HongKong,3dy4x5,masturbake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:21:28 2015 UTC,You can try the Regal Hotel which is right by the airport (about 2-3 minutes of walking from the check but it is at least 40 minutes away from the city.) Another hotel is The Park Lane Hong Kong a Pullman Hotel in Causeway Bay. The place is surrounded by lots of stores and close to the city. The metro system in Hong Kong is very convenient and reliable so getting to places and visiting tourist attractions are easy to get to. A good website to book hotel rooms is here!

HongKong,3dy4x5,Wymsycal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:13 2015 UTC,"I love HK Accommodation is expensive. Slightly cheaper on the mainland side. I know there are affordable  hostels a bit further north, but the great thing is the underground will get you anywhere. Enjoy the ladies and night markets, botanical gardens, the tram to the peak. Ferries, the large Buddha. The night life  Food can be expensive, but if you are adventurous  you can eat local food a hell of a lot cheaper , be wary of  water (ice) and food not cooked thoroughly.  Find a McDonald's and order a large milkshake. I would 'cheat' and look at what others were eating and point and ask for that, if I did not like it, I moved on to the next dish.  Remember that the automatic 10% gratuity goes to management so leave a cash tip.   Go up and down the mid level escalators. If you like walking there are lots of shops sights to see.

I've seen rooms between 600-800 hkd which weren't horrible, but left a little to be desired. Maybe consider upping the ante a little bit.  Also, it's a very busy city and if you leave it to the last minute you may find yourself paying a lot more if you don't book it before you arrive."
HongKong,3dw50m,cuntbagnelson,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:55:52 2015 UTC,"At the price range you're specifying you're talking about 28,000 HKD. I know I can get that under 9400. I have people on the ground, South Asian and Nepalese people who have stayed in the rooms at this price, they have taken pictures of the room and said it is clean. Cleaned every day, clean sheets, clean floors.   The prices cited by aforementioned people are precisely the same online, literally the amount they mentioned even when booked online and converted into Canadian dollars. So there is absolutely no favoritism for booking the day you get there or if you book a month in advance.   The only question is if the room will be there to book. Like you said, it's a busy city. As for the quality, I'm bound to be approached by Africans, Pakistani people etc trying to sell me junk or drugs. Those are trade offs I'm willing to make, as long as I get a clean secure room with no frills."

Considering your length of stay, it might be worth looking into some sort of room share, or AirBnB. I'm seeing rooms ranging from 7,000 to 15,000, which fits into your price range in the low end.

Here 10,000 kilometers away in Canada we are having a serious issue where a local company is just importing them from China and slapping a false safety logo on it and selling them for under 60 hong kong dollars. One of these caught on fire while a local in this city was home, they have investigated the company 3 times but the Canadian government isn't actually doing anything about it.

HongKong,3dt6wz,jaffacakes16,9,Sun Jul 19 05:32:02 2015 UTC,"There are a few that I know of:  Fun Atelier is the only GW shop in HK, they are friendly to new comers but push GW as their main line. They do some batman stuff and if you bought something I'm sure they won't mind if you play something else there from time to time but games workshop is their main product and if it's busy they'll ask you not to play non GW products.  Jolly thinkers is the other one, one in Wan Chai one in Prince Edward. They have a mix of games, you should book ahead though just in case as they get quite busy. They focus on a lot of different boardgames but I would say not a good a choice as other places. They serve food and you get a free drink under $30 but after a certain amount of time passed you pay by the 1/2 hour or hour.  There is the Boardgame Club but they just left their shop in Mong Kok due to rent and are moving to Kowloon Bay/Kowloon Tong and won't be ready until next month.  Tomorrow I'm meeting my friends to play some boardgames of our own collection, if you are free after noon (we are all on summer holiday/yay teaching!) you can join us, we have Star Trek attack wing, CAH, small world, ticket to ride and some other games."

Go to RC outfitters in Causeway Bay (http://www.rcoutfitters.net/), they sell tents pretty cheap, I believe you can get one for under HKD150. The next part might be a bit more difficult as it involves some transportation, but head down to Sai Kung and make your way to Ham Tin Wan, you can set up tent there for 2 nights and enjoy the view.  Transportation for a two way trip might get around HKD150. That leaves you with 200HKD for food, which might be tight, but you can probably make that work by going to a supermarket and buying food there.  Again, probably not what you were looking for, but you'll be seeing a different side of HK that's definitely worth it."

Fortunately, apart from the accommodations, HK can be a very cheap place when it comes to sightseeing, eating and getting around. There are tons of chain fast food places (both intl and local) as well as loads of mom and pop cha chan tang cafes that are dirt cheap. You can expect to pay HK $30-50 per meal.

You seem to be taking this awfully personally that I could sense some resentment in the author's article. If you're the person who wrote it, lighten up. What I said wasn't meant as a critique, but an observation that you're getting a little too worked up over the issue.  I don't know about you, but from the paragraphs below she/you seemed pretty hurt and offended. The ""if you must know"" part reminds me of that Navy Seal Copypasta guy.   People I hadn't seen for a year would greet me not with questions about my travels, but what they perhaps thought was a ground-breaking observation: ""Wow, you've gotten fatter.""  Um, thanks?  If you must know, I don't like fries or fizzy black drinks, and I'd been running at least 80km a week, lifting weights, and had added squats, deadlifts and pull-ups to my training regimen, to put on some much needed muscle.

So about that paragraph you pointed out : she's being mildly sarcastic at the rudeness / directness of ""wow, you've gotten fatter"". I't s hurt, not butthurt. There's a difference. <-- Just my opinion.  Again, 100% serious about this : I am most interested in perceiving things as they are. IMHO, most arguments, disagreements, etc; are mistakes in perceiving reality, jumping to conclusions, etc; Read this, for example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox. A classic example of what I'm trying to talk about. That's why I'm having this conversation about what you might be thinking of as ""just another comment I made casually"".

I don't miss the health care system in the US, but I do miss that doctors in general seem more competent. (My gf, also an American, says women's health care is like 20 years behind the US.)   Just because I need to rant about it... Last year, I was having chronic headaches, nose congestion and ear pain, which seemed to be sinusitis based on my previous bouts with it. The first GP blew me off, said it was allergies and gave me some Panadol and Zyrtec. It kept getting worse while I was on vacation in Thailand and a doctor there said, yeah, it was a sinus infection and gave me a three-day course of a strong antibiotic. I felt a lot better, but the symptoms came back a month later. I saw another GP at the same practice I'd gone to before. He didn't examine me at all, just said ""Eh, yeah, probably a sinus infection,"" and gave me antibiotics and referred me to an ENT. I went to the ENT, who diagnosed me with tonsillitis. I haven't had tonsils since I was eight.  So, good luck in your search, and if you ever happen to come across a decent ENT, please let me know."
HongKong,3dots2,WeirdUncleScabby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:10:07 2015 UTC,"This guy was recommended to me by a few GPs who couldn't give me a proper diagnosis. He's quite a component ENT, and has extensive training in the ENT field, although he is like the majority of HK doctors who push for expensive procedures (his consultation fees are some of the most expensive I've seen, at 1000+ for the first 10 minutes).   And speaking from experience, don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion. Do consider carefully when he recommends a procedure - mine ended up costing 20,000 to remove a small benign mass behind my ear."

HongKong,3dlnen,fat_stig,7,Fri Jul 17 07:20:56 2015 UTC,"A participant in a protest against cross-border traders on March 1 was yesterday found guilty of assaulting a police chief inspector by hitting him with her breast.  Tuen Mun deputy magistrate Michael Chan Pik-kiu convicted Ng Lai-ying, 30, who works at a shipping company, of using her chest to bump against the right arm of Chief Inspector Chan Ka-po - who was trying to control the chaotic protest in Yuen Long that day.  A 14-year-old pupil whose name was not disclosed in open court for legal reasons was also found guilty of striking Chan in the chest with his shoulder while the officer was urging protesters to return to the pavement from the roadway on Sau Fu Street.  Ng's boyfriend, Kwong Chun-lung, 20, and university student Poon Tsz-hang, 22, were each found guilty of one count of obstructing police officers who were exercising their duties.  All four defendants pleaded not guilty to their charges.  During the trial, Ng said Chan stretched his arm to reach the strap of the bag on her shoulder, and his hand landed on the upper part of her left breast.  She said she immediately yelled ""indecent assault"".  But yesterday, after analysing the evidence, the magistrate rejected her claims that the inspector had molested her, and chastised her for making up the assault story.  ""You used your female identity to trump up the allegation that the officer had molested you. This is a malicious act,"" he said, adding that it had caused great harm to the officer's reputation.  The magistrate noted that during his one-year stint in Tuen Mun Court, he had handled numerous cases in which defendants had assaulted other people who were exercising their duties, including police officers and Correctional Services Department staff.  ""Those who are attacked because of their jobs should be protected,"" he said.  He also affirmed that the role of police in a protest was to maintain law and order.  ""There were two groups of people expressing different points of view at the protest. Without police officers there to maintain order, it is not surprising that there was commotion, or even clashes.""  All of the defendants, who will be sentenced on July 29, were remanded in custody, pending a series of reports to determine an appropriate punishment."
