youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,edikos,93,Mon Jul 20 11:59:39 2015 UTC,I don't understand this title…
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,Jiggatortoise-,120,Mon Jul 20 15:20:57 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the creator and his friends aren't English-speakers. It looks like ""we played a prank on our friend"" or some variation."
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,GrinningManiac,8,Mon Jul 20 15:23:51 2015 UTC,"I thought it was more along the lines of ""We were kidding about the fire"", since it looks like they are (Russian?) firefighters."
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,RedAtWork,31,Mon Jul 20 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"You never kidded all over your friend? As a joke, of course."
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,MinecraftSuggester,4,Mon Jul 20 16:45:39 2015 UTC,Only once. Never again
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,Jiggatortoise-,0,Mon Jul 20 19:43:11 2015 UTC,I've kidded all over your mom. Hello Son.
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,Surelyyoucantbcereal,0,Mon Jul 20 18:31:45 2015 UTC,I love playing pranks on my friends.
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,double_expressho,3,Mon Jul 20 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"We were kidding our friend, as in we made a joke on the expense of our friend."

youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,MestR,2,Mon Jul 20 15:15:13 2015 UTC,It wouldnt have been his head to hit the door first
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,vicabart,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:29 2015 UTC,Not that head at least.
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,APiousCultist,3,Mon Jul 20 21:39:12 2015 UTC,"People don't understand the title, but I don't think I understand the prank.  What sound was he playing? Were the knocking sounds from his feet or from the phone?"
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,bloodybart,3,Mon Jul 20 21:17:47 2015 UTC,It's everyone else in the room moving their feet to make it sound like a lot is going on. Look at the people behind the sleeping man.

youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,EdgHG,19,Mon Jul 20 17:07:39 2015 UTC,what? Most of The content on reddit is something interesting someone found and is sharing. Also there is a rule about soaking your own oc. Plus the title is just copied right from the YouTube title because it's funny broken English.
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,smierc,7,Mon Jul 20 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"This account, all it does is take videos other people own and post it to reddit for advertising revenue. It's awful."
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,Miyelsh,7,Mon Jul 20 15:56:51 2015 UTC,while your argument is valid your anger is a bit misdirected as it is unlikely that OP is the same guy who uploaded the youtube video
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,coffeetablesex,6,Mon Jul 20 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"If you look at OP's history, you'll see most of the videos he's posted are from that same channel. So I think it's very likely he is the same guy."
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,jsmooth7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:03:38 2015 UTC,i see one post over and over and then i see a bunch of random posts from different channels
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,coffeetablesex,2,Mon Jul 20 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"I just noticed this video is the exception, but most of the other videos are from ""Человек паук"", and are repeatedly posted places where they don't even belong. The cat video was posted to a subreddit I mod twice, despite being unrelated. I'm not sure why someone would be so insistent on posting a video so much unless they were trying to get as many views as possible."
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,jsmooth7,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"he is talking about the youtube account in question, not posting to Reddit."
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,Norci,-30,Mon Jul 20 18:11:52 2015 UTC,Refuse to open because title hurt brain
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,LEGITIMATE_SOURCE,38,Mon Jul 20 18:22:14 2015 UTC,What an open minded individual.
youtubehaiku,3dxpxp,pizzabeer,7,Mon Jul 20 17:30:52 2015 UTC,They don't speak english.
