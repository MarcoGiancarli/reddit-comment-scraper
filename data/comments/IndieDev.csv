IndieDev,3e5avd,AleksandarK,2,Wed Jul 22 01:52:35 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I must admit I do love trying out other peoples games.  First off, play store listing - get a video of some game play up, I have found over that people are more willing to install something if they get to see what they are buying into.  You are using GPGS and Immersive mode - I like you already. However if you let the phone sleep, it is no longer immersive. Perhaps you could add the keep awake flag to the manifest?   Very catch intro music, very erm... SMW ;)  Rate button on the front menu - generally this is frowned upon, it is usually better to prompt people for a rate once they have done something good in the game - set a top score etc - I would love to find the article that backs up my wild claim but I can't right now. So I will say that comes from experience. If you then prompt and a user says no, let it sleep for a couple of days before asking again if someone is still playing D3 or D7 they will much more likely rate the game.  From a gameplay perspective - I was expecting it to speed up as it went along. Perhaps I didn't get that far into it (100m). Also it wasn't clear the slopes that I would run up or not.  On the game over screen, don't give me an ""OK"" to take me back to the main menu - I want to restart and try again in one click, I don't want to traverse a menu structure. The share button, like the rate button is out of place. Again, I would save this for high scores or when achievement are unlocked. Having said that when I did click share, it opened Twitter - but there wasn't a link to the Play store in the tweet! You have to make it ridic easy for people to do something. People will always go the path of least resistance unless they have a very good reason not to.  Finally, be really careful with your use of other companies stuff - the Mario sounds and art style - I know it isn't exactly the same, but it is clear you are using their work.  Hope that helps!"
IndieDev,3e5avd,monsterofcookie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:38:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for taking the time to check it out and comment. I genuinely mean that. You're completely right about the path of least resistance and the use of buttons, I'll definitely work on that for a future update. In terms of the art and music, yeah it was heavily inspired by Super Mario, but it was all drawn from sratch, and the sounds were all synthetically created to mimic the Mario experience (so I don't think there's any legal issues there, as I'm not using ""their stuff""). I feel it is a good idea (especially when breaking in) to piggy back off of existing games and nostalgic emotions already established by other games. Also yeah, the music itself was very much inspired by SMW (basically mimicry of the instrumental layering, not nearly as good though :P)."
IndieDev,3e5avd,monsterofcookie,2,Wed Jul 22 03:50:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome!   I do agree with you on playing on the nostalgic element.   Have you come across this site -> http://incompetech.com/music/ <- Kevin Macloed has a whole host of royalty free music you can use. Perhaps it is worth checking out?  I am not suggesting ditch what you have, but you might something that helps define your game as yours."

The game is a really minimal physics puzzler, you just have to throw the ball into a box, should be simple right?  I think I’ll be ready to send out a test flight build near the end of the week so anyone who’s interested PM me your itunes email address and I send you an invite when its ready.

Clearly this is based on Outrun, but you might want to take a look at MegaRace if you haven't seen it before. It controls similarly, so maybe there's elements you can draw from.

IndieDev,3dvr1m,Jherden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:52:55 2015 UTC,That looks like it might have potential. Perhaps movement needs work though.
IndieDev,3dvr1m,e_of_the_lrc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:07:59 2015 UTC,How so?
IndieDev,3dvr1m,Jherden,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:54 2015 UTC,"I guess he means how 'floaty' 'twitchy' the movement seems. I'm assuming the mouse directs the sword, and wasd/arrows controls the character? could just be how you have the movement programmed. Is movement determined by an input of velocity or acceleration? Velocity would be directly mapped to a key press. if moving up with arrow key inputs a change of 1 m/s, then your character moves exactly 1 m/s, and gives a 'twitchy' feel to movement. There isn't really a conservation of momentum with your movement. If a key press of up gives you an acceleration of 0.1 m/s2, then you'll see a gradual change in velocity, and it will take him 10 seconds before he reaches a velocity of 1 m/s. This has a more 'organic' (for lack of better term) feel?  Think of the movement in Counter Strike vs ARMA (closest analogy I could think of).  EDIT: had it backwards, meant twitchy"
IndieDev,3dvr1m,Jherden,2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:08 2015 UTC,"You have some acceleration, but it's very fast. Max speed is 240 px/sec and acceleration is 480 px/sec (but decreases as your speed increases because of friction).  There is a notable time taken to slow down, though. You can run into a wall and bounce a notable distance away before you come to a halt.  Also, out of interest, which (Counter Strike or ARMA) is the twitchy one?"
IndieDev,3dvr1m,Jherden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:36 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer, I was replying to Op's question to anon. He was asking what about movement needs to be changed, and I was sort of leading into questioning his movement model.  I feel that CS is the twitchier of the two. ARMA has a lot of 'cumbersome' stop and go movements to (at least, what I perceive) emulate momentum.  EDIT: BLUH, you are OP! sorry, your phrasing threw me off, and I got confused!"

IndieDev,3dwf3e,earthexe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for a small game dev, the personal version of Unity is all you really need. There's not really anything restrictive about it. By the time you're making enough money with your games that Unity REQUIRES you to go pro, having money to buy it will be the least of your worries.  Oh, and there will be a unity splash when your game starts. No biggie.  I have no idea how well Unreal stacks up, though, so take this with a grain of salt."

Although I myself haven't gotten around to learning it quite yet it seems to be much more universally used than Unreal. While Unreal might be used more at a AAA level, Unity is used more amongst indies, which makes sense due to it's flexibility. The unreal engine is only going to run on top tier machines, but Unity games will be more adjustable while also including the option to 2D as well as the option to target mobile devices. I feel it's just more worth your time."

IndieDev,3czw29,skhotoveli,13,Sun Jul 12 08:07:47 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind watching their hour long GDC talk they cover it pretty well here. They didn't spend a cent on advertising apparently and all their publicity was ""organic"".  http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021897/Crossy-Road-A-Whale-of  The tl;dr; is including as many aspects that encourage virality - cuteness/humour/cultural referencing plus sharing.  I think a large aspect for their success is that they might not cover however (sorry watched it a couple months ago) is their Asian publisher Yodo1 who pushed them into the Chinese market.  I think its dangerous to think that just because you have a great game that people will naturally come and play. You have to find ways of putting it in front of an audience and getting people to talk/share it. The app stores are awash with hundreds of new games both good and bad, getting your game above that noise is a significant challenge."

I don't know the ins and outs of actually designing a show and I just winged this off the cuff, but I'd think you could at least mock up a display with this.  I'll be working more on how the fuses work because they're very simple now and individual fireworks can only have a fuse connection to one other firework (which doesn't hinder anything, as far as timing the pieces of a show goes), but I'd think that's a feature the software really needs."

One that you could play, record and synthesize like a piano and another option that would function like a Besiege snap build and a keyframe timeline.  you could build in one and ""play"" the fuse timing in the other and then import your recorded timeline back to the build.  or imagine being able to calculate both your fuse and shell burst so you would be able to program full beats within the firework choreography.

I particularly loved the graphic style, the artsy way the colors change and the quick dog fighting action really gives it a pick up and play vibe which is usually what I'm in the mood for.  I'm a sucker for unlock able and I thought the different style of tank shots (turret, machine gun, etc) was a fun way to add uniqueness to an otherwise simplistic game type.  I wasn't exactly clear on the goal at first but the general shoot and dont be shot eventually sorted everything out.  Honestly if anything it gave me an old school Atari ""Combat/Combat 2"" vibe which I loved for the nostalgia.  My main curiosity (if you have time) is to learn more about your lore and levels ideas. I do like the gameplay elements (fast and fun!) but it needs a little extra meat on the bones to keep me playing and it sounds like you're currently working on that.  So any juicy details? :D  Best of luck on your game in the future and once more congrats on being green-lit!"

IndieDev,3cnzfn,benjymous,0,Thu Jul 9 12:08:10 2015 UTC,"If you're developing in Unity, then you can just make a PC game that uses gamepads, and worry about getting it running on console platforms later - the whole point of Unity is to make it much easier to run the same code on multiple different platforms, after all.  You can also start out with the free version of Unity, and upgrade to one of the Pro versions later on, so there's no need to waste money on expensive kit before you know if you'll be able to actually achieve anything.  You'll also find it much easier to get onto console platforms if you've already got a good playable prototype in place."

It'd also be nice if you could restart by tapping anywhere, the key to these type of games is quick restarts!   Also, I'm getting a bit of slowdown on my Xperia z3, not all the time but on certain playthroughs. It may have been worse when the lighting effects were most active but it might have just been most visible then."

For fun I have been toying with a new idea to handle ads and to remove them, If you Tweet the score once the ads are blocked for the session and once it has been done 15 times they are removed forever.  The idea is that I would prefer the promotion to the 69p or whatever it is people are charging for no ads at the moment.  Let me know what you think, for those interested only one person has actually tweeted their score and that was someone I know so no luck yet but it is early days."

From a readability standpoint there are some changes that could be made.  For example: if you are working on a platformer, the body positions will be difficult to read relative to the head,  and you really have to sell body motion in a platformer. Think of the original super mario sprite.   Anyway, let us in on your game mechanically and we might be able to be more specific."

If by hollow you're aiming for empty and stripped of ""life"" designing the character to feel less energetic will work in your favor.  Might also help to make the eyes darker then the body, making the body glow instead of the eyes. Or, making the eyes appear faded in comparison.

I remember releasing a game for Ludum Dare early last year, I was obsessively checking comments every 30 minutes and desperately trying to promote the game. It worked, a lot of people liked ""Membrane"" and although I did get some negative feedback related to difficulty (the game was brutally difficult, only about 5% of players actually beat it, and they were hardcore skill-puzzle players) it actually didn't sting as much as I thought it would.  By finishing a game, you have done something that the majority of indie developers never succeed in doing. And that is something to be proud of.  The game looks cool, you need to promote the crap out of this or no one will know it exists but us. Your game is finished? Great! The work is just now really starting.

Your stage isn't live and literal and your options for pushing through it don't include picturing the audience in their underwear (probably), but ultimately the only cure is to grit your teeth and hold together for long enough to collect proof that you didn't fuck everything up... or in the worst case, confirm that you did so you can just deal with it instead of wallowing in uncertainty."

Now keep in mind, that's also someone managing 5 accounts and ONLY using twitter, but to add to what was said above:  Some people don't see social media as a full time job.

IndieDev,3ce03e,sekodev,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:19:16 2015 UTC,"Hi guys,  You need to strike a careful balance here. To put it crudely - don't blow your load early. Release all your content now and you'll have nothing to say when it's time to build buzz. Say nothing now and you'll be unable to build an audience fast enough for your awesome social media content to have an impact.  These 2 things will get you started:   You have a game development roadmap, right? So make a social media roadmap alongside it. Plan what content you can use to attract THE RIGHT KIND of people to your channels and spread it out. Set aside 50% of the total content available for you to use as part of a social activity for your launch campaign. Understand what the right kind of people are. They are NOT DEVELOPERS (I see this so, so much - content targeted at other developers instead of gamers. Who is going to buy your game?) although your fellow dev friends will be instrumental in helping you to build your audience of potential customers. Once you know who the right kind of person is, find out what they're interested in - what makes them tick, what do they do in their spare time, what kind of people and brands do they follow? Make plans to use those traits to capture them. If they follow a specific youtuber, reach out to that youtuber and see if you can work with them. You get the picture. It's about exposing yourself (quiet in the back) with the right message, in the right place, at the right time to give yourself the best chance of capturing the right kind of person for your game.   That's all very generic (can't blow MY load early either ;)) and hopefully it sparks some ideas :)  MT17"

IndieDev,3bu5qe,thefryscorer,4,Thu Jul 2 05:27:46 2015 UTC,I don't know if he is talking about what I think he is talking about. But here you go: In the UE4 marketplace someone made a graphics settings menu with blueprints and sells it. Maybe he means that.   As far as I know you can use everything you've bought from the UE4 marketplace in your own game. It would be stupid not to be able to do that.
IndieDev,3bu5qe,teabagZz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:17:24 2015 UTC,"That is what I meant, I just wanted to know if doing that would be frowned upon"

IndieDev,3bu5qe,angstud,2,Thu Jul 2 10:52:02 2015 UTC,"I don't see why it would be ""wrong"" to import premade settings functions (I'm assuming that's what what you mean) when generally the same is okay for art and music so long as it fits in where it goes.  I'm primarily a games consumer, and a load of options is always nice to have - but as a hobbyist developer I can definitely see why a lot of smaller games don't include them; it's a god dang hassle.  So yeah, do it, make sure they fit in (are the labels right, are the references right etc. etc.). Best of both worlds, really. You reduce your hassle and the player still gets an options menu worth a damn."
IndieDev,3bu5qe,WraithDrof,2,Thu Jul 2 06:29:51 2015 UTC,"You need to be a bit clearer on your wording. If you mean options/settings like changing graphical settings, then I can't imagine the reaction to be too friendly - it might theoretically not be ""wrong"" but it'll depend on the specific implementation. Even as a developer, I'd probably put down a game that asked me to pay to toggle the FOV slider - since I'd be buying something that essentially feels more like a tax to motion sick people rather than an expansion to the game.  But I also get the feeling you're talking about something else because that doesn't apply to something which is ""stealing/copying""."

IndieDev,3bu5qe,4-bit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:54:40 2015 UTC,"If this wasn't an invitation for my honest opinion, ignore this post.  If you want to know my honest opinion, I think the best thing for a project will always be unique visuals. I'd usually recommend people to choose an art style that they can pull off rather than spend the money on something they can't. Thomas was alone was literally just cubes, shaders, some water effects maybe, and camera animations, and the aesthetics in that game told a richer story to me than Last of Us.  That isn't a recommendation for your current predicament, because I don't know the specifics. The art assets you bought might fit perfectly and not matter too much. But just because it can be hard to bite the bullet on a payment, doesn't mean you can let sunk cost get to you. Just keep it in mind, I don't want you to read this as ""BURN AL UNITY ASSETS""  Art assets I think are fine for things like game jams or just for fun projects, though, so if you don't use it here you'll be able to get plenty of use out of them there if that's something which interests you.

IndieDev,3bu5qe,dli511,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"It's not really just about story. Minecraft has aesthetics that are usually attainable by most without artistic experience - but I don't think it would have reached anywhere near it's popularity had it used assets.  Most of the time, I can usually tell if a game uses Unity assets, even though I'm not aware of most asset packs - usually down to a slight disconnect between different assets, or between the assets and the theme of the game.  Again, it might be different in your case. Would you mind sharing a screenshot or gameplay video?"

Also, UE4 is so new and still in active development so documentation is very bad and because of blueprints, most of the community guides don't teach you how to use the actual code. And the few that do are outdated because they keep changing things in the code with every update. I've moved onto trying Godot Engine after getting tried of both engines's lack of linux support, and so far I love it. It's so much more organized than the other two engines, uses a much friendlier language (GDScript is slightly less high level than Python), and MUCH better documented.

If you plan on adding your texture to say a custom made object in Blender (even if it's just a flat plane) then you will need a UV coordinate map of the object. Which is what tells engines where to place your texture on the object.   It also depends on the style of art you are using.

Most small businesses take 2 years to start making a profit and commercial indie development is a small business! I 'left' (ie was made redundant) from THQ and had about 1 year salary of savings. I stretched it out to 2 years by cutting my spending. That was four years ago and we've released one game and are 3/4 the way through our second. You should consider all aspects of running an indie dev and work out what roles you can play and what roles a partner/partners or contractors can help with. There's programming, art, design, sound, music, marketing/PR, project management, book keeping and lots of other boring business stuff. When we started our indie, I had programming and project management experience. My two business partners had art, animation, video editing and web site stuff covered. We contracted sound/music and marketing for our first game and got an accountant and lawyer. Hopefully that hasn't scared you off the idea, because having total creative freedom is awesome! There's just a lot more hats to wear when the team is a lot smaller :)"
IndieDev,3b4h6i,pbaker,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:38:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, and do some research and planning before you make a decision. What will be the setup and ongoing costs? After I left THQ, I played GT5 for about a week and then spent two weeks convincing myself that it was a good idea before committing down the indie path. Also, I suggest working on game ideas/prototypes before spending money on setting up a company etc. If you don't have something you can sell, no point spending too much money on startup stuff."
IndieDev,3b4h6i,pbaker,2,Thu Jun 25 23:51:54 2015 UTC,"I started getting serious with gamedev during my third year in college. I thought it was fun. I did random mods before for TES games so gamedev came naturally. Right after I graduate I thought why not do it for a living. I started sending my resume to local game dev companies but no one noticed. I told myself ""screw that. I don't see myself working in any other industry so might as well go indie"". Dumbest decision of my entire life.  I did that for a year making about $200-ish  :( My college savings was obviously gone. I lived with my mum at the time. In the Philippines it's not really a big issue if you don't move out right after college. Luckily I don't have student debt so I managed to stay sane.  After a year I sent my resume again to one company that seems promising. My resume basically says ""I am DA BAWSSS at unity hire me"". Incidentally they were looking for a unity dev. I was hired on the spot. YAY LIFE! It's fun. We do client work and original IP.   I don't do my own projects lately because I had to move into the city and my laptop broke but I'm looking forward to getting it fixed ASAP. :D"
IndieDev,3b4h6i,canon3212,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:13:59 2015 UTC,"I was in Iraq in 2004 and I watched the behind the scenes video of Republic Commando.  I remember they brought in either a military or police specialist to train a bunch of nerds to clear rooms and I got to thinking ""I could do that, I know all of that stuff.  At the right company, that could be a pretty major bullet point on a resume.""  That was a long time ago, I got out, went to college for a bit, did another deployment, got out again, etc.  I got turned on to the indie mindset and being my own boss during all of that.  It's funny that the video is what got me so interested in making games in the first place, but now I've got very little desire to work for a big company or even to make those kinds of games.  Anyway, I partnered with a guy from college who I did a lot of projects with.  Just small things to learn.  Our first real attempt at making a game took off, literally overnight, with articles and quite a bit of attention popping up all over the internet based on nothing but a couple gameplay GIFs.  We were getting press like crazy, asked for interviews, and prominent let's players were contacting us about the game before we even had an alpha build done.  It was lightning in a bottle and one of the best feelings in the world.  Unfortunately, my lung had collapsed not long before we started talking about the project publicly.  The medical debt spurred us into a partnership that didn't work out well and we made some pretty poor business decisions.  We finally released an alpha build but the game fell apart shortly after, disappointed a lot of people, and I somehow got left holding the bag.  Spent most of the next year trying to finish the game while being harassed and sent legal threats.  Haven't quite recovered yet, but I'm finally back to work on a project I believe in so I'll keep my fingers crossed.  edit:  I can't speak much for savings or money.  You'll need a lot, even for a ""simple"" game.  A decent pixel artist can run 1500+ a month and most of them aren't particularly stable with the amount of work they put out.  Then you've got to support yourself, and music, etc.  It can get pretty costly.  What keeps me going is that I'm ""lucky"" enough to recieve a small VA disability pension so I have some form of income while I slog along and I am genuinely lucky enough to have a very supportive girlfriend."
IndieDev,3b4h6i,SergeantIndie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:18:49 2015 UTC,"6 months of savings & experience is a bit on the short side, I'd say. It's more than just financial backing, it's your own ability to contribute and deliver on a project.  Now, I might be a little biased in that regard. I went indie after I left my 2nd job (3 years of industry experience + savings at this point). But I'm not on any team - I'm completely solo. Because of this, the means to getting work done was my most valuable asset.  I would recommend getting these things done and figured out before taking the leap:   Website Blog (tumblr's best I've found for indies) Social accounts - facebook page, twitter, etc Accumulated code + assets (don't go in fresh, work on a generic prototype that can help your game development) A few game ideas + a few prototypes (do some game jams)   Ideally you'd be leaning on one game idea and are willing to commit to it. The truth is, every single step & decision when it comes to indie dev is tough - and that only begins with choosing what game to work on. Be sure it's the tiniest game idea you've ever had. You want experience in releasing things - that's key. Start with game jams and work your way up to smaller commercial releases.  I would consider putting out a Unity Asset Store tool or package. It's a commercially released product, albeit one on a much smaller scale. Good experience in doing that, and you'll also learn about setting up all of your channels + communicating and getting feedback from others.  All in all, good luck!  PS: How did I do?   Here's my website and twitter My current game project.  I've released an Asset Store product here My first game greenlit Current game on greenlight concepts My Ludum Dare profile   I've released some games on iOS and got my first game greenlit. I've recently rebooted my website so not all of my work floats on the internet now. Despite all this, I've still not seen a huge amount of success. It takes a lot of time and effort before you can be the person capable of running an indie company and successfully make & release a product.  Indie Devs are like super heroes. They often spend a lot of time finding themselves, finding their purpose, rising up to the occasion, honing their skills etc before they finally don their super-hero outfit and go out there :)"

I actually started on the prototype yesterday and I think I'm gonna start it all in my free time.  Website and Blog are things I never thought of, I'll probably start a dev blog soon.  Social accounts are good, I actually have a few friends who run their own businesses (unrelated to gaming) and they're pretty successful, so I have the resources to get some marketing advice.  I've tried a single game jam before, but I never followed through and finished. The tight deadline and the rushed feeling gives me anxiety lol. I like to work at my own pace. I definitely have some ideas and even a few little derp games I've made, that I probably would show anyone, but the experience is there.  Again, thanks so much for this. Appreciated."
IndieDev,3b4h6i,VerdugoBlanco,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I first started when I was 12. I had no budget, no money, and an old Windows XP computer with poor specs. I learned programming in C++ and Game Maker's GML for a few years before I finally made my own small games. I am 17 now, and haven't made much to show for it. Just a few attempts at making a Pokemon Game Maker, a couple sidescrolling games, and a Top Down Shooter. But right now the only thing I can think of that is financially challenging is marketing and getting other people to help you out with your game. You see, (almost) everyone wants money for their services, and those that don't might give you crap quality work. However, there are a few people that will give you quality work for free. So far as to how it's turned out, well, that's a bit difficult... I've grown into a community of game developers like me (gmc.yoyogames.com) who do stuff like what I do. I have learned a good deal of programming and want to continue that learning. And right now I am working on an RPG that might be my first serious project in over a year, and have been designing it for a year or two. But I will be honest: going Indie sounds nice - you work for yourself (usually), you work on your hours, and you do whatever you want. However, you have to spend a while learning the ins-and-outs of your engine or IDE or language to make your games, you have to find ways to market your game to consumers (I just use Twitter) and it can put a lot of stress on you. Quite a few times, even more recently, I have thought about quitting this Indie stuff and pursuing something else. So if you want to do it, that's great. Just be sure that you stay committed the whole way through, because it's tough all the way through."

IndieDev,3b2q4k,DarkAugust,5,Thu Jun 25 14:19:59 2015 UTC,"Start making a game by writing a design doc is not good. After you write the doc you will be asking yourself, now that the fun part (daydreaming about how awesome the game will be, aka design doc) is over, what can I do now to continue having the same level of fun?  What you should have been doing is firing up the engine, place a few cubes and spheres in the game, attach scripts to them and make them behave like the game you want to make. And you just keep testing and adding different ideas and figure out exact which way is the most fun, and you WILL end up discovering way more than what you would think of while writing design doc, and you WILL become a lot more motivated because you now have a working prototype which IS the best design doc you can get, and you will know what will be the next step to put on your to-do list.   Check out the Cerny method. He opposes writing a design document until you have built prototype that is fun. And you then write the design doc for DOCUMENTATION rather than daydreaming."
IndieDev,3b2q4k,Rotorist,2,Thu Jun 25 15:16:07 2015 UTC,My mistake I should have been a bit more informative on this. I merely 'started' the design document by writing down my initial concept and am treating it as a living document and adding as I go. I do have a prototype of sorts in the works just nothing to show as of this moment.  I do appreciate the feedback and the reference to the reading material! I often try to find good conference talks to listen in to for inspiration or learning but I find them hard to look for (I'm probably just looking in the wrong places!) Any documentation or recordings I can look into are appreciated!
IndieDev,3b2q4k,Rotorist,2,Thu Jun 25 15:33:14 2015 UTC,"Living document is a waste of time for you unless you are a AAA studio and hires dedicated person to maintain the document. All the time you spend on constantly revising the document could have been spent on testing game mechanics during preproduction. After preproduction is over, however, then you DO need a solid game design document that records all that you have learned during preproduction, and nails down all the details that you are going to build during production stage."
IndieDev,3b2q4k,spf0227,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:57:30 2015 UTC,"For good talks, the GDC Vault (http://www.gdcvault.com/) is a good place to go. There are some that you have to pay for, but there are a ton of free talks on there that are worth having.  Also, I disagree 100% that writing the document isn't the way to go. You NEED to have a document before you even begin. It will save you so much time in the end if you already have everything planned out before you start. Sizes of rooms, character model dimensions, level layouts, menu layouts. Literally everything you could need for your game should be figured out before you even begin. It makes everything so much easier in the end because when you have a question you can refer back to your document. Good design documents can be hundreds of pages for larger games, but they really are invaluable when it comes to saving time."
IndieDev,3b2q4k,Rotorist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"Problem is, most of the times you don't know the appropriate size of rooms, dimentions of character models, level layouts, menu layouts until you have worked on the game for some time. You can't predict how the game will become unless you make the game. All you know is there is something you want to make happen but you just don't know all the little details to put in a document, and then while you work the game, everything will change and you will find yourself constantly revising the document.  The document is useful as you said, of course, but it should be done after preproduction is over and all the details are nailed down, tested and confirmed to be fun.  I used to write dozens of pages of design document but I soon realize that it's a big waste of time."
IndieDev,3b2q4k,spf0227,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's no wrong way to do it. I just prefer to have everything documenting before starting.   If you have experience with an engine, you can kind of get an idea of how big everything needs to be beforehand though which is really great.  At the very least, I'd have features all planned out. Having some diagrams in terms of what you want levels to look like is always good, even if you change them later. Just understanding the basic flow of your game will make it much easier in the long run."
IndieDev,3b2q4k,spf0227,2,Thu Jun 25 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"This may seem a bit silly, but there is one way I personally get over being stuck in a rut, so to speak.   For me, working on a game is addicting. The hardest thing about doing any sort of development is getting started. Once I hop into the engine and begin putting in some work, I quickly realize why I started doing this in the first place. I'd highly recommend just jumping back into the work and seeing if it sucks you back in.   If you still find yourself having trouble getting motivated, maybe take another look at your project and try to diagnose what exactly it is about it that has you uninterested in working on it. Maybe adding a new, exciting mechanic would rekindle your interest, or trying to do a task that would be challenging for you to give you a sort of obstacle to overcome.  Also, it's important to remember that in game development, there are always going to be times when you're going to have trouble maintaining motivation. The important thing to remember is that you chose to work on this project, for whatever the reason may have been, and you'd love to see it through to the end. Remind yourself why you started in the first place.  Finally, try setting milestones or goals for yourself. If you are the kind of person that loves having challenges, make a schedule for your project that lists features and try to get them done by a certain date. That way you have something to challenge yourself with and it will keep the project interesting.   Hopefully some of that advice is helpful to you. Good luck getting back into your project, I look forward to seeing a post in the future from you regarding the finished game!"

IndieDev,3b2q4k,Rotorist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:50:28 2015 UTC,"First of all, I would reinforce what /u/Rotorist said and really stress that you stay away from a design document. Design documents tend to be a waste of time. When your document is done, you won't be any closer to having a game, because you will have no working code or assets. Furthermore I guarantee you you will throw out a great deal of that document when you actually start ""getting down to it"", and realize what you are actually capable of as well as what actually proves to be fun.  I had a lot of problems with motivation in the beginning too - part of it was that I felt I would always leave things unfinished and never find tasks that could be done in the few hours I had each evening.  I don't know what your work is like, but for me what I ended up doing was negotiating with my employer to work 4 10-hour-ish days instead of 5 8-hourish ones. It can be trying but it is really nice to actually have one day in the work week cut out just for game development. At first it was tough to stick to but now it is so routine I have ended up making a lot of headway with my project, especially when I have the motivation to work on the weekends."

I'm really interested in playing the game, and I look forward to its apparently ""classic"" difficulty.   Unravel also looks fantastic. First of all, you can't help but love the character. The gameplay looks really interesting and the yarn manipulation mechanics are going to make the game a lot of fun. It's a challenge that I haven't seen tackled before in a game, and I'm always interested in trying out new mechanics rather than the same tired old ideas.   I've always directed my focus towards the indie community just because the games that come out of it are so imaginative and fantastic. Triple-A studios aren't typically willing to take on the risks involved with trying something new, so I'm definitely glad that there is a community of developers out there who are always trying to innovate when it comes to their game design."

The last thing I would say is that you could also just make programmer art. Games like Risk of Rain, Thomas Was Alone, etc are all really fun and they have super simplistic art. If you'd really like your game to have good artwork, you could also follow some tutorials and try to build up your artistic skills.

IndieDev,3ayzy6,Fresh4,3,Wed Jun 24 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you want your player to feel playing the game, how you want your player to feel about their avatar, and how your avatar is feeling in the game.  If you're walking calmly, and there's enough to see and do at that pace and emersion is really high then of course it's fine.  If you're walking and the building is on fire - and this isn't some kind of pyrokinetic rage situation - then it's going to feel out of place.  Likewise, if I have to deliver a package from the town to the mountain off in the horizon I don't want to merely walk there, unless the main arc is me getting there and along the way there are a bunch of things to do. Like a horror game! I would expect a cowardly avatar to sort of inch along in a forest with their lantern held out like a shield, jumping at every squirrel that pops out of a bush.  So a long way of saying that it's more how things feel then about accuracy in speed."
IndieDev,3ayzy6,enalios,3,Wed Jun 24 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like the mood changes based on the situation. I want the player to appreciate the environment and to do that a calm walk seems appropriate.   But if they encounter a dangerous situation then running speeds can be altered to account for the situation.   Have you played watch dogs? I remember you can switch between a pedestrian like walk to a more effective brisk walk as well as have the ability to run in a situation.   If it's an adventure/exploration game, then yeah if they're walking then it's to take in the environment. Of course one danger arises you can quickly change how that feels. thanks for the advice. Helpful overall."
IndieDev,3ayzy6,enalios,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"Haven't played that game BUT - that would be pretty cool.  Contextual actions can sometimes be frustrating because players don't like abilities being taken away, but being able to choose when to walk/run is always good. Many games do it with the analog stick, if you only move it slightly you walk, otherwise you run.  Or perhaps even introduce a stamina mechanic, so the payer had an incentive to only run when the situation calls for it.  Or a social rating, if you're on the street and running and bumping into people - your social rating goes down.  All sorts of ways to make it dynamic!"
IndieDev,3ayzy6,ActionGamemaster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:28:53 2015 UTC,"That is interesting. I've put some thought into it. It's obvious to try to make the movement feel nice without taking too much from the players control. Stamina is definitely a thing in mind. Instead of a social rating, I'm reminded of the early assassins creed franchise where if you tried fully sprinting through crowds you'd stumble and fall, letting your pursuers have a slight advantage.   I don't intend for the walking to be the only form of transport, but it will be at first.   To address the analogue stick, keyboards have the unfortunate curse of not being sensitive to force, but as watch dogs did it, you can toggle between brisk and normal walk through a button (alt key by default).   Depending on how big the game world is, running might make little difference to walking (I know that from Far Cry) and would be best to get a vehicle unless you weren't in a hurry and wanted to stroll around waiting for opportunities. Running is arguably not a mean for transport in most cases, but as a means of fight or flight in games. In case you need to make a quick move or run away.   So yeah, there does seem to be a lot of ways to make it dynamic, perhaps some better than the other though."
IndieDev,3ayzy6,ActionGamemaster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"It IS dependent on the scale and feel of the game as was said below, yeah, but sometimes even in that case it can be too slow. Take Oblivion/Morrowind for example. You walk at a fast pace, right? Wrong. By holding shift or not using the caps lock key, you can walk. Now play Oblivion and only do the right way to walk, ever. And you know, Oblivion can look pretty immersive and beautiful sometimes. W-Well sometimes."
IndieDev,3ayzy6,E-308,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:35:18 2015 UTC,"Forgive me for not playing the earlier elder scrolls game, but did you mean that when you shift you walk even slower? I did play some skyrim and I know that caps lock alternates between a fast paced walk (almost a jog) and slow walk. Then holding shift would actually run faster. I'd assume it would be similar to that.   Recalling some info now, when your inventory was full you'd be forced to walk normally and I remember it being painfully slow."
IndieDev,3axx5c,Aserash,4,Wed Jun 24 11:39:07 2015 UTC,"The one thing that stands out to me is the camera, which directly follows the player.

IndieDev,3axx5c,ninjarobots,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:33:27 2015 UTC,"I've looked into changing the camera focus. I tried several options, (having the vertical movement lag a bit, sticking it to the platforms like in the very good video, and various Frankenstein methods where it's stuck to platforms unless you're going down, etc) and they were easier to code than I expected, but they didn't work with how the movement was designed to begin with. It ruined the feel of the gameplay and didn't work with the speed of movement.   All this means that if I do change the camera, it'd be a different game altogether. Because of this, I've decided to design the camera movement better and in conjunction with the gameplay with my next game.  For Springbuck Run, I urge you to give the free version a try when it comes out tomorrow. The camera makes sense after a while."

Why should any of these people work with you over their own projects? And what kind of game did you have in mind?  I only ask these questions because when it comes to independent development, the designer role is almost always (if not always) filled by a programmer or artist (or both). Based on this post, it just seems like you want to make a game but haven't learned any of the skills required to build one."
IndieDev,3aqznu,hexdie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"When I started out I was first invited to be the ""ideas guy"" on a team lol. And then after giving a few of my own ideas I started helping out environmental design/level design (placing models in the map). And then I was invited to join the programming team, so I started learning how to code. It was a lot of fun growing in a team like this. However the team wasn't well managed and feature creep is part of the team culture. During preproduction the team decided that there's no funding to keep working on this game, so they wanted to start a new, small game that should ""be done in a few weeks"". Feature crept again, of course, and after three months the game came to a dead halt. I left the team and never heard anything about their progress again."

It's easy (relatively speaking) to design a game on paper and then just hand it to the programmer/artists to implement. Your job is basically over then, why would anyone need you?   You need to learn how to program or be the artist, or no small indie team is going to need you. That's just the facts."
IndieDev,3aqznu,pancakesimone,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:44:57 2015 UTC,"Actually designing a game is extremely hard, and one wouldn't know that until he makes the game himself (programming especially) from beginning to the end. But most beginners think that designing a game is simply writing a design doc before anything is made with all the wild dreams of the designer, hand it to the programmer and make him make his dream come true. How convenient."
IndieDev,3aqznu,Rotorist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"I've worked with people who are solely 'designers'. They spend a couple of days fleshing out an idea and then handing it off. Sure, they are available for questions and they might change the doc sometimes, but they didn't do much else. Of course, this scales with the complexity of the game, but still. A person who just designs a game isn't very useful. Programmers and artists, or hell even the financial officer, could come up with ideas. It's not like non-designers can't be creative also.   All I'm saying is that only being a designer is not a good skill to market yourself with in games. Now, being a programmer/artist who can also design? You're golden. Not to say that there aren't people out there who just design games. But for indie teams where money is already tight and the labor is intense, why have someone who does so little?"
IndieDev,3amelf,SpaceRapist,9,Sun Jun 21 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"This isn't a Russia-exclusive attitude. Go make a post on /r/gamedev about being a manager/idea guy in need of a programmer and artist, and you will receive the same sort of indignant responses, albeit with a slightly politer tone. People who do not directly contribute to the art, music, programming (and to some extent, promotion and PR) are not well-liked in the majority of indie game development circles.  Is this resentment justified? To an extent. Many of us have heard some variation of, ""can anyone turn my idea into a game? I'll give you a share of the profits,"" far too many times. That's not to say that the Russian blogger is in the same camp - he could be a motivated and capable designer who contributes as much as the other team members, for all I know - but he shouldn't be surprised at the backlash."

I'm not lazy and after 3 weeks (whe're both working full time and can only work on the game in the evenings) I'm as enthusiastic and productive as I were in the beginning.  I suppose most people don't believe in the ""idea guy"" because they've never seen one. All they've seen is some random schoolboys with huge ""ideas"" that can't write a description for their idea longer than a couple of pages and don't have neither the patience nor the enthusiasm to go further. Probably those guys at 2ch were right to bash at me in their own way. I'd just like to add that I've seen quite a few programmers make a game and then not knowing what to do with it. They don't know how to advertise it, how and where to present it. The game itself is often quite shitty because the ""idea guy"" was not there to show the other guy how to improve the game.  Of course there are people who can both program and design a good game, and also have a good understanding of marketing. That's good.

It's impossible to program for a moving requirements. It's like asking a sculptor for a one-legged amazon, then when he is almost done ask him to ""tweak"" it into a two-legged male Cherokee warrior.

IndieDev,3amelf,llehsadam,6,Mon Jun 22 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"It's a common attitude (to some extent) across the industry.   It's the ""Ideas guy"" stereotype.   ""I have an idea, you do all the heavy lifting and I'll take a substantial share of the profits..... what great deal!.....for me""    P.S. Oh, and one more thing, guys. Ideas matter. Otherwise every lousy programmer could make games and sell them successfully. Which is not the case.   They do, but very few indie teams are going to want to give you a share of the profits for simply having a few ideas. The average indie game doesn't make enough money to pay a guy simply to have ideas. Most of those ""lousy"" programmers are the ones making games. You could have the best idea but if you can't make it then it's worthless. Where as a programmer can have a decent idea and turn it into a game, which makes it worth more than your greatest idea. You don't need a professional artist to make games, look at Thomas Was Alone.   Very, very few indie teams have a guy who is simply just a designer. The ones that do, usually have well known industry vets that make the game more visible. Increasing Sales.   The problem with ideas guys from my standpoint, is they often come in claiming how motivated they are and how much work they will do. But it's always followed up by I can't code or I can't do art etc. The first question on my mind is always. If you are so motivated then why haven't you bothered to learn more of the skills involved with making games. Fair enough Art can take years but you can learn to write sufficient, albeit not the most efficient, code in a few months.   If you truly want to make games then get off your backside (metaphorically) and start learning one or some of the skills involved. We would all love to get paid for just having ideas. But if it was that easy no one would be programming or making art or making music. Out of all the the roles in game development the one with the least demand by an utterly massive amount, is the ideas guy. Most indie devs have so many ideas that it's common for scope creep to happen. We often have to remind ourselves to hold back or we will never finish our projects.  You have the same attitude I see out of many ideas guys. People with no experience expecting everyone else to do the heavy lifting while they get to to all the fun parts. It doesn't help that you go on to devalue the skills of the others that you seek with statements like ""lousy programmers"". Many game designers are programmers. It helps massively to understand how things work behind the scenes. What you think sounds like an easy task, could take months to implement.   You have a month of deciding to be a game dev under your belt and nothing else. It's all well and good claiming you will do the management and the advertising. But in the end you have just as much experience in those fields as you do actual game design. Which is zero.   Think of it from the other perspective. You have just spent months/years of your own free time,  or a lot of money going through the educational process, to learn how to program. Some guy comes up to you and goes:  ""Hey I have no experience in game design but I had this idea, want to program it for me on the slight possibility it might make money? I'll do the advertising, which I also have no experience in, and manage the business, I have no experience of this either. But my pure ability to apply myself to learning, as shown by my lack of learning no other skills that could contribute to game development, will mean I surely will pick these skills up, no problem!   If we make money I'll take a substantial amount of the profit. You do all the hard, frustrating stuff. I'll do all the fun, stress free stuff. Have we got a deal?""  You would likely start laughing and walk away. This is basically what you are saying to people, you just don't realize it. When I looked at your blog post, that is what I saw. Though you also added in another trait on top. Complainer. You've been at it a month with no previous experience what did you expect? You even complained that someone asked you to show them a design doc. I didn't even bother trying to partner up for 3-4 months. Even when I did start looking to team up, I certainly didn't expect to be welcomed in with open arms."
IndieDev,3amelf,theartlav,2,Sun Jun 21 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"Oh god, what a long post. I fucking love long and thought-out posts!  You should understand, that what I was proposing is teaming up to make a really simple and small game, from which we could possibly profit. I didn't try to entice people into some huge project that would require hundreds of hours of work! You seem to completely be missing that.   Most of those ""lousy"" programmers are the ones making games.   Indeed. Yet I was talking specifically about the guys who can code but have no capacity in dame design.    You could have the best idea but if you can't make it then it's worthless. Where as a programmer can have a decent idea and turn it into a game, which makes it worth more than your greatest idea.    And what happens when the programmer DOES NOT have any ideas? Let's face it, there are millions of programmers around the world, and a huge part of them are involved in game development, yet not many of them make their own games. Have you asked yourself why?  Of course, there are people who can both code and generate awesome ideas. I envy them, as I can not code.   You don't need a professional artist to make games, look at Thomas Was Alone.   Totally agree with you in that one.   The first question on my mind is always. If you are so motivated then why haven't you bothered to learn more of the skills involved with making games.   Now, now. One can be motivated to do one thing, but not do other things, even if those other things can eventually lead him to the first thing.  I don't see anything wrong with that. I don't mean to sound haughty or arrogant, but where was this guy until I found him? How many games has he made? Zero. Now he is making one. There's a difference between one and zero. I don't like the attitude ""you wanna make games, you gotta learn to code!"". Meh. It's okay for different people to have different skills and to cooperate to achieve something.  What if Varg Vikernes said: ""You wanna make music - you gotta learn to play guitar, piano, drums and bass guitar""? Because this guy know how to play a lot of instruments. Yet 99% of the people in music bands play one instrument.   If you truly want to make games then get off your backside (metaphorically) and start learning one or some of the skills involved.    Or we could say: if you truly want to make games, develope a decent idea, go find someone who can code, make him stick with you until succesful release. Bam. You're a game designer. Works too, doesn't it?   Out of all the the roles in game development the one with the least demand by an utterly massive amount, is the ideas guy.   it might seem like it, but I personally believe this is not so. If the programmer can BOTH code and has nice, thought-out ideas - HE IS THE IDEA GUY. I do not know who you are, probably you are good at making games solo. But take my word for it there are tons upon tons of guys out there who have no fucking clue what to do with their coding skills. They need someone with a real, thought-out, working idea to do something.  Believe it, I've seen this type of people in almost every field. People who are good in their field of expertise but do not have a knack for business, or can't produce ideas.  Take artists for example. Go to deviantart and look at all those people drawing all kinds of shit - kittens, elves, orcs, cities, women, naked women. None of those people ever makes it to any decent art gallery. Why? Because their art is generic. Shallow. It conveys nothing and makes you feel absolutely nothing when you look at it. Well drawn, yes. But nothing beyond that.   You have the same attitude I see out of many ideas guys. People with no experience expecting everyone else to do the heavy lifting while they get to to all the fun parts. It doesn't help that you go on to devalue the skills of the others that you seek with statements like ""lousy programmers"".   Forgive me, and with all due respect, I think that you just got butthurt. Easy, buddy. I am as lousy as those programmers, just in my own way.  Apart from the obvious butt damage, your post was a quality read, for which I thank you.   But in the end you have just as much experience in those fields as you do actual game design. Which is zero.   Now all those comments just reek of some defeatist attitude. It's like you're implying that I will fail. But why? Why are you even doing this?  I'm having fun, I'm doing something new, I'm progressing and every day I see the results of my work. Even if I fail, I won't be brought down.   You know, I was hearing stuff like this when I went to a forum to ask for advice on how to properly write my report to the police regarding a recent assault on me by a couple of freaks.   I was recieving literally dozens of comments like ""you gonna fail, the police doesnt care"", ""you gonna go to jail for excessive self-defence"", ""they're gonna pay the attorney and your case will be dissmissed"". Amongst all this bullshit there was one guy who turned out to be a detective and he really helped me to file my report to the police, told me how to properly interact with the investigators, what to say, where to take copies of my report, how to properly file a complaint to the procurator and so on. In the end, the investigator got fucked by her superiors for being careless enough with my reports, the fags who attacked me were found and one of them was sentenced in the end.   ""Hurrr durrr you have no connections, nobody's gonna do shit about your case, blah blah"". If I listened to all those people, where would I be now? If I listened to all those who said that I first need to code and need a fuckton of money in order to hire coders, where would I be now?    If we make money I'll take a substantial amount of the profit. You do all the hard, frustrating stuff. I'll do all the fun, stress free stuff. Have we got a deal?""   If I am only good for doing that stressful stuff, and you're good at doing the fun stuff (designing, managing the team, promoting the game, setting up a company aww so fun and easy!) then sure, why not?  There are people who work hard manual labor for minimal wages, they're being basically told ""You work hard for me, I pay you 1/100th of what your work is really worth, and you are gonna be ok with it"". And they do it. Why do they do it, instead of starting their own business and building a factory?  All in all, I think you are thinking too much, and doing too little. No offense.  Besides, I have experience in a couple of unrelated business fields, and I can say, that thinking too much and doing too little isn't going to make you really successful.   I didn't even bother trying to partner up for 3-4 months. Even when I did start looking to team up, I certainly didn't expect to be welcomed in with open arms."
IndieDev,3amelf,theartlav,3,Sun Jun 21 21:51:27 2015 UTC,"Nearly a year ago I jumped in as an idea guy. But... Idea guys often don't understand the stresses and how to deal with those stresses that come to those building the game.  I joined the PR team, became a writer, then a lead writer, then a PR Director and now the Studio Director. I am now producing content. A year later, and I am still learning about how different idea guys and content guys are.  And idea guys often don't know how to deal with it.  Tell me, what would you do if your content guys became apathetic? Lost interest?   What would you do if they found an idea guy that also understood those who generated content?

If he can't give a reasonable response, I think it would be time to part ways. Then again, I should have seen that he is this type of person from the start and shouldn't have started working with him to begin with.   What would you do if they found an idea guy that also understood those who generated content?   Didn't quite get that one. What, you mean they would replace me with some other idea guy? It's hard to believe, since a tiny studio of 2 to 4 people is more about friendship and sticking together than the huge studios with lotsa money. But if that happened while in a small group, I'd just go there and beat the shit out of the guy who decided to replace me. Not even bullshitting you.

Contradicts with    It's hard to believe, since a tiny studio of 2 to 4 people is more about friendship and sticking together   So you would kick the guy out of the friendly studio, but you expect them not to kick you out if something better came along? Even threatening to beat up your replacement. How pathetically childish.   You missed the point of the question entirely. Say you are a programmer, artist, musician on a team. If there were two guys with ideas and one had experience of content creation and one didn't. One could contribute to making the game and had experience of the systems and their limitation, and one didn't. Which would you want to work with, which one would you want managing you. The guy with experience of what you work with or the guy who knows nothing about it? Every sane person would take the second one.   You are trying to apply standard business management to an indie dev scenario. It wont work. Indie dev management requires knowledge of the subject at a much deeper level than most managerial roles. Many Indie devs are indie to avoid that type of management.  This:   First, of course, I would start by encouraging him and asking him what's going on. If he can't give a reasonable response, I think it would be time to part ways.   Is why you would be terrible at managing a game dev. This happens to pretty much everyone in content creation. It's burnout ,it's natural, it passes. If you ever did any of the roles involved you would understand. But you haven't so your first instinct it to try and fire the guy.  Tell me what the limitations of using Unity with git would be. Don't spout some crap from a google search as you wouldn't actually understand it. If you don't know that then you have just been cut out from a significant portion of indie devs. If you don't know the limitations of most major engines and Version control than you can't manage 99% of indie devs. You can't tell people what to do if you don't know what they can and can't work on.    Then again, I should have seen that he is this type of person from the start and shouldn't have started working with him to begin with.   Yet you wont put in anywhere near the hard work that he has and you expect people to work with you?    Are you starting to see why people don't want to work with you?

Surely you are starting to see a trend by now? It's your ego that is wounded. You struggle to take on board that you aren't the only one with ideas and that you are the very stereotype of an ideas guy. You thought you could waltz in, tell people what to do and they would bend to your every whim. When it turned out that wasn't true, instead of putting some effort in, you took to the internet to whine about it. Dismissing an entire country, an entire community and several others along the way.    Tell me what the limitations of using Unity with git would be. I've no fucking idea, but my coder does. It's his job, after all ;-)   So Mr manager how are you going to tell your coders what to work on. You don't know their system. If they have to tell you what they are working on, then they are managing themselves ;) How are you going to design a game when you don't know how games actually work. If they have to tell you then they are designing the game and not you ;)   Oh look your Game design and management skills are suddenly worth very little to an Indie team. You are in a highly competitive field, I could throw a stone in any direction and it would hit thousands of ideas guys just like you before it hit the floor, the market is that crowded. You either make yourself stand out by offering more than them, or you struggle to find work. That's not foretelling, it's already come true. Your blog and struggle to find people to work with is the proof."

IndieDev,3ajv0b,willdone,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"The link only tells me how to create a sin/cos wave but what I need is to create that wave between 2 points. What I'm actually trying to do is to shoot projectiles from a gun to a target and I want projectiles to go with a sine wave from gun to destination.  Making the projectile actually move on that path is where I can't get my head around.  I did something that kinda works with bezier curves. With the formula on this page:   http://blog.paultondeur.com/2008/03/09/drawing-a-cubic-bezier-curve-using-actionscript-3/  For P0 I provide gun's position, for P3 I provide target position.  The result is awful but they move in a curve alright.."
IndieDev,3ajv0b,bluedesertgondola,3,Sun Jun 21 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"Your ball's path isn't defined by (x,y). It's defined by (x,y) on a plane in (x,y,z) space. You could do it with vectors originating at the barrel exit on the gun. At a certain time t, I think the vector pointing to the projectile has x = projectileSpeed*t x=t and y = A*sin(B(t-C))+D (as per the link provided by willdone). Let me doublecheck that though.  Are you asking, at the instant that you pull the trigger, you measure the distance to the target, and fire a sine-shaped wave projectile, which completes exactly n cycles before hitting whatever you targeted? In that case, I think the period of your sinusoidal function is equal to the distance d from your gun to your target, multiplied by n. I think this works out as y = sin(t*(n*2*pi/d))"

A lot of people like to wait until the end of the sale just in case the game they want gets included in a flash sale or daily deal at a deeper discount.  EDIT: Just saw your Steamcharts numbers and in your case I think there's a lot more too it then that. Look like you jumped from 0 to 62 simultaneous players. Your game must be being featured somewhere on Steam or maybe on a popular website. If you have Google analytics set up for your Steam page you should check there.

Theres a whole bunch of devs that leave marketing to launch date and just generally pretty much despise the work they need to put into it.  If the value proposition is there and the price is right ( bearing in mind that indies generally arent swimming in cash )  I'm sure there would be a decent amount of interest in this.  I sure would love for someone knowledgeable to help out with that part of gamedev at least. Leaves more time for me to stare at code ;)
IndieDev,3aflwh,Kodama01,3,Fri Jun 19 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"My largest concern would be cost. Granted, I can't rightfully call myself a dev yet, as I'm really just getting started. That said, any service would need to find a way to prove that their service was a reasonable price, but more importantly would be able to produce better results than what I could do on my own. I can spam tweets all day with a bot, and find ways to garner followers on facebook and twitter. You need to convince me of how you can do it better. So much so that I'd be willing to pay for the service."
IndieDev,3aflwh,notafryingpan_games,2,Fri Jun 19 20:39:25 2015 UTC,thanks for your feedback. The fact that you thought of twitter spam bots already tells me I would be able to provide value.

We released lately one of our games with the help of a well known PR company (very expensive as well) and the outcome was way worse than anything we ever promoted by ourselves.  I think there is still plenty of room for indie ad/pr agencies and, especially, for good ones.   By our experience anyway I noticed that there is nothing better (in absolute terms) to promote your game by yourself (unless you really have no idea how to) because the passion and the connection that you have with your own game can't be transmitted by a big PR company. Just my take on it."

My experience has been that you'll see a elevated level of sales and visitors to your store page during a sale but unless you're featured on the front page it won't be anything huge. We got pretty lucky because one of our emoticons is used in the clicker minigame and they link to our store page down at the bottom of the page. It's (so far) made it more or less equivalent to a weeklong deal for us.  Speaking of weeklong deals, now that your launch is over these will probably be where you get the most sales. You can participate in one every 2 months or so. If you plan on doing bugfixes and updates to your game, I suggest using your update visibility rounds in conjunction with weeklong deals to get the most bang for your buck. It's worth noting that visibility rounds seem a lot more effective since the redesign of the store page that happened last year.  If you haven't read it, Valve has some good advice on discounting your game: Discounting Best Practices"
IndieDev,39y7x4,Falsen,2,Tue Jun 16 07:21:31 2015 UTC,Hi Falsen Thanks a lot for your answer. What you say is exactly what we were thinking to do: release a noticeable update along with a sale and use a visibility round. Atm our price is locked till the end of the summer sale as well as the discount. We are planning now a better discount plan/strategy for the post launch. Perhaps another mistake we did is to set the price a bit too high (7.99) knowing that we could discount it a lot and this decrease the value of the game for the price you pay. Your game looks good btw.  Thanks for your feedback!

IndieDev,39y7x4,Smatil,4,Tue Jun 16 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"The format of this year's sale has impacted the visibility of lesser-known titles, meaning there's more of a need to drive people to your store front to get sales.    Steam has experienced a higher than ever volume of users this sale and the day it launched there were some teething problems.  As a result some technical features have been switched off to improve performance.  For example, some titles won't show up in the auto-predict search box if you type part of the name in (there's a thread in the dev forums about it).  The change of the layout of the homepage really affects how the sale plays out for a lot of titles.  If you look at your marketing stats > traffic breakdown, there's a notable drop in traffic from the Steam homepage (this is stuff like update visibility, recommend for you, etc) and other pages, and an increase in traffic from ""Valve website"".  There's a net loss for one of our games, which means it's getting less visitors than normal despite the sale (first day was about double traffic for the day which diminished somewhat as the days progressed).  The flip side of that is that there's way more people actively seeking games to buy, so even though there's a lower volume of visitors, the traffic is converting better.  As others have said, running a custom sale is a good shout, particularly if you do it during an otherwise quiet period.  There's loads of people regularly checking sales on Steam - it's better to be 1 of 60 on sale that week than 1 of 6000 during the summer sale. :)"

I can't speak to UE4 as I haven't used it past downloading it and briefly checking it out, but Unity3D is fairly easy to use. I think it all depends on what languages you're already familiar with... since you're coming from a web development background perhaps you've got some C# experience? If that's so, Unity3D might be ""more at home"" for you. I'm sure someone can chime in on the benefits of UE4"

I actually tinkered with Unity a bit a couple months ago and ended up buying the Udemy course when it was on sale for $30. I just got started on that and a friend of mine is trying to convince me Unreal Engine 4 is better, but I think that's mostly due to the near photo-realistic building walk through demos that have shown up recently. If I'd have more time, I'd try to build a game with each and see how they compare but at the rate I'm going, that experiment would take years.  I do have a bit of C++ experience, but it's been years since I've done that. If anything I'd be more at home with something resembling JavaScript.  Oh, glad to hear these discussions rarely turn into flame wars. I've seen that too often when people in the tech community are really passionate about something.

Unity's unityscript is kinda like javascript, although they're moving more towards c# lately. Unity seems to have better mobile support currently, but that may change.

Even though I have a computer engineering degree and lots of programming experience, I like blueprints and that system seems to click for me.   Honestly you're getting a powerful tool either way. I'd try them both out and see what you're more comfortable with.

I honestly didn't check in depth yet the last version of Unity: if it is more C++ oriented might be even better in terms of performances (don't take this as a statement) but indeed a bit harder if you are completely new.  Bottom line to me is important to know what your goals are and where you are at right now. Any language or framework has its own learning curve, it's up to you and your goals (and your time) to understand which one is better."

Is it possible to escape??  Also, I kind of want to do a micro post-mortem (not really, more of just a retrospective) here. This is the first real game I've made solo, although I've made games in school with others and at game jams and whatnot.   I was really testing out a new aesthetic style. I like the idea of having a colorful environment, and I love gradients and similar artistic effects. So that's the direction I went with this project. In addition, I forced myself to make all of the models and textures in the game procedurally. So everything you see, including the level design, was generated by code.   It was my first time writing shaders for a game too, which was fun. I love fragment shaders, and can't wait to do some more exploring on that subject. To me writing shaders is like being a magician.

Hopefully the update I post tomorrow though will have the enemy AI working and allow them to roam around the island and attack you.  6/17 Update:  I just uploaded a re-optimized version of the game. No new gameplay features from yesterday, but the game runs much more smoothly, and the island is much bigger. Hopefully tomorrow I can get back to the enemy and combat design.  6/16 Update:  This update brings with it a few changes. First, while the enemies don't attack you, they do now roam the island instead of just standing in place. I'm almost at the point where they can attack you though, and that update should come tomorrow. On top of that, the lighting system now works better than it did in the first upload. While the lighting itself is the same, the game starts closer to mid-day so it's initially brighter, and the area around the player which is lit decreases as it gets darker to make it feel more like you can't see as far around you. It's a small touch, but in game it feels much more natural. Finally, I updated the graphics for the trees, so that there is a bit more depth to them, and added a graphic to make it clear when you hit enemies.  Tomorrow I will continue working on enemies, and hopefully get to crafting."

Lol I just re-uploaded an even NEWER update than the last one. Version 0.22 is now available and has instructions on it.  So the freezing seemed to be related somehow to the island size in the launch version which was slightly different than the one I was testing with. Stupid mistake on my part, I know, but still.

I also made my game in game maker and i really like your terrain generation. Is there a tutorial you followed or did you make it yourself? I would really like to learn more about that stuff!  Anyway, good job and i hope you keep working on this!"
IndieDev,39w8v1,babaganousch,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that makes me feel so good to hear, thanks! :) I did not follow any specific tutorial on the terrain generation no. I'm still working on the system because of how slow it becomes when you get to larger map sizes, but the basic premise is pretty simple.   If you want to use hexes, I highly suggest you read through this article, because it is by far the most detailed one I've ever seen on how a hex grid works, and goes through a lot of great stuff I never understood. I actually haven't read all of this yet, because a year or two ago I did a bunch of personal research and development into how to generate a hex grid from scratch, so I already had a good foundation when I started this project, but I found this earlier today and it's very helpful, and talks about stuff I hadn't even considered or dealt with yet.  Anyway, onto the terrain itself. The basic concepts would likely work for either a hex or square grid, but I think they lend themselves a bit better to hexes simply because each location has a potential of 6 neighbors, rather than 4(unless you count corners as neighbors in a square gird so each one would have 8).  The first thing you do is you create a hex at the center of the map. This is mid-point of the island.   Next, you need to create a random shape which the island will 'grow' from. To do this, I created a simple for loop, which repeated 30 times in the final version, that would choose a random direction of the the ones available, and build a new hex at that neighboring location. Then, it uses the new hex as the starting point to build the next hex. It's important here to ahve a check to make sure hexes are only built on empty spots, to prevent hexes being built on top of each other.  After the for loop runs its course, you have a random chain of hexes which will be used to form the island. To actually build the island, I created a repeat loop. In the repeat loop it uses a with statement to examine every hex in the room. For each hex it finds it checks how many neighbors the hex has, and how many times that hex has gone through the loop previously. If the hex either has 6 neighbors, or has gone through the loop twice already, it does nothing. If not though, it then begins looking at every neighboring location around the hex. For each free location it has a random chance of making a hex at that location. You want to keep this chance low though, because you have to remember that each hex position will be examined a potential of 12 times, twice for each of it's neighbors. This means that if the number is too high, you may as well just always build a hex.  Once the repeat loop has run it's course the island's final shape is set. Also I used a variable for the number of times the repeat loop would run. This makes it very easy to get islands of different sizes, simply by changing the variable.  After the island shape is settled, I then want to make the terrain more varied since right now everything is the ""Beach"" type terrain, the tan colored tiles. To do this, I go through the first 75% of the hexes made, and for each one I choose a random number. If the random number is within a certain range, the hex becomes a ""Forest"" type hex, the dark green ones, and if not it stays a beach. I only do this to 75% of the hexes to ensure, that all or most of the forests are in the center of the island, and the island's edge is all or mostly beach hexes.  From there the trees are generated basically the same way. I look at all the forest hexes, and assign them a random number. If the number is within a given range, the hex gets a tree, and the tree is assigned a random position within a 70 pixel diameter of the hex's center point.   Finally, I go through all of the hexes one last time to build the grass hexes, and the water hexes. Grass hexes are the light-green hexes. For grass hexes I look for forest hexes which have beach hexes neighboring them. Whenever I find a hex like this, I make all of the beach neighbors into grass to ensure that it never transitions straight from beach into forest. For water hexes I look for all the hexes which have less than 6 neighbors.  If a hex has less than six neighbors it means they are either on the edge of the island, or they are some of the random few hexes which didn't get fully surrounded somewhere in the middle of the island. Whenever I find these hexes, I simply find all their empty neighbors and make water hexes on those locations.  Generating rocks and items are all done in similar ways to what was described above. On top of that, all of the ranges I use to determine whether things happen are also randomly selected before the island generation begins. I ran a number of tests early on to determine the maximum and minimum percentage of forest hexes I would want, the maximum and minimum I would want for tree/rock coverage, etc.  At the beginning of the game, a random number within the ranges I settled on is chosen for each aspect of the map, and that is used as the range when the actual items and hexes are generated. This ensures that the not only are the maps always shaped differently, they are also populated differently. One play through may have a shit-ton of trees and forest on it, while the other might have a lot of dry spots in the middle of the island with much sparser trees.  The one thing I don't like about this method is that it doesn't result in as much island shape variety as I had originally hoped. While the edges of the island are always unique, and there are sometimes interesting features present, I assumed that the random chain I create at the beginning would lead to a wider variety in overall shape. What I discovered though, is that a hex grid will always be a hex grid, and even if you have a sharp turn in the chain when it's first made, after 30, or 40, or 150 runs of the growth algorithm, all of those weird shapes are mostly smoothed out.   I briefly experimented with the idea of generating multiple small islands, or multiple chains, and then growing all of them enough that they would connect because I thought that might be more interesting. I had a lot of trouble getting it to work exactly the way I wanted though, and in the end the results still weren't ideal. While they were closer, the time limits on the mix tape forced me to abandon the new method. Depending on how long I spend on the game, I'll probably eventually go back and see if I can make that method work, but for now I'm okay with all of the islands having what I call the ""turtle"" shape.  Anyway, this became way longer than I expected, but I hope it all made sense, and I'd be glad to answer any other questions related to it, or other aspects of the game, so AMA I guess."

After some complaints I received yesterday about sluggish performance I went back through my game and re-optimized both the island generation, and the culling systems which prevent off-screen objects from drawing. It's also now on an even bigger island.   The big difference with the new island generation algorithm, is that I combined some of the steps so that it doesn't have to iterate through the hexes as many times."

IndieDev,39qajl,kairon156,2,Sun Jun 14 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"This is a very cool idea. Will you have personalities for both the staff and costumers?   You can have the waiters/bar worker have different levels of charisma/charm while handling the customers which could effect tips. The staff can have their own stress levels if things get too hectic. Even as a dishwasher for a restaurant I can have some level of stress trying to keep up with everything and unable to have a lunch can only make things worse.  For the customers you can have ones that liven up the place and dance or others that just sit at a table drinking while enjoying the atmosphere. I guess it would only make sense to have the rowdy ""mean"" customers too which would give you a reason to higher bouncers which could have their own set's of personalities.  Will this be like a tycoon/business game where you manage funds and try to keep the place running perhaps able to do upgrades every now and than? Having furniture, decorations, and maybe uniforms effect the feel for the bar the player want's to design. The feel of the bar can effect costumers happiness personality and rather or not they would make this a regular place to visit.  I would like to see a menu where you can set a priority list for your staff Like in RimWorld and just let them handle things from there, there's 2 modes for this 1 the on/off one as in the picture where the characters handle things in order from left to right 2 the player can manually set priority for each task from off to 4. Each task can take certain skills your staff members have.  Some room ideas you may already be thinking of. A kitchen area to prepare simple meals and wash dishes. male/female bathroom for the workers and separate ones for the customers you may want to add a bladder/bowels setup in the background of each character.  Sorry if my ideas are overwhelming or way off the mark. I love coming up with mechanics for game ideas I think are cool."
IndieDev,39qajl,hakura11,2,Sun Jun 14 15:24:27 2015 UTC,"Awesome ideas... thanks. Some already in the plan to release.   For example, it will be a game which you can serve your patrons, but also manage your tavern. Like you say, manage funds and upgrade the tavern, higher servers, bar tender, etc. Will see how it works out once I implement it.  I also, plan on doing food and inn(renting rooms)... but this would be later. Initially, I wish to do an early access for the tavern game itself. Focusing on pouring drinks, serving, managing your bar. Then later in future releases, opening new pieces of the game like rooms to rent, etc.  Thanks for the feedback. Its good to hear about players preferences."

A top down space exploration mining game using 3D models. As it is now, the player mines Krystite from rocks using the mining gun. The Enemy is doing the same. A new enemy spawns every nineties seconds at the start. The player needs 4 Krystite per super shot, that is needed to destroy an enemy. You get 1 to 10 per rock, as you mine it. When the player destroys an enemy miner they get their Krystite. The player has to scoop up the floating Krystite from rocks or destroyed enemies. I'll put up more updates here. http://panther-game-studio.blogspot.com You can try out what I've done so far, in the Unity Web Player on that link too. I'll see how much I can do Sunday!"

IndieDev,39p7gd,lancejz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:45:46 2015 UTC,"There are no real guidelines. Basically you should provide a link to somewhere people can download the game from in a comment here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/39w8v1/mix_tape_03_nms_space_jam_showcase/  It can be dropbox or your own website, but itch.io provides you option of having a page where you can post updates to the game. A link to a page like that would make searching for your game easier in the future!  I'd recommend leaving a description of the game and maybe images and things that you think would present it well. It's all about presentation!"
IndieDev,39otal,jedidealer42,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:59:03 2015 UTC,There is too many things going on. Try to make it a little more clean with a better background and a better start screen. Also it's kinda weird that the game doesn't stop when you die.
IndieDev,39kz0n,delacct,2,Fri Jun 12 13:34:00 2015 UTC,"It's really not entirely a myth.  The scale that it happens at some points, is the part that is lucky.  The amazing scale at which Minecraft, Angry Birds, Draw Something, and other games (or any other product) that reach such phenomenal audiences, is not really part of a plan.  I would have a hard time imagining that at any point in Notch's development history, did he consider that the toy that became Minecraft would eventually earn him .. what, a half a billion?  something like that?  To become like that, you need everything to align perfectly, and you don't get to pick what goes ""viral"".  You can try all your life to make something that hits the ""viral"" stage, and fail, even with a good understanding of what a large group of people like.  Make games you want to play.  Then people like you will buy your games."
IndieDev,39kz0n,FormerGameDev,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:35:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. The article says that being an indie in 2015 is different and you can't just develop, release a game and then wait: this is true. I guess by now every indie dev knows that there is hype and followers to build if you wanna sell copies. Yet, giving for granted that quality and potential are there, luck is still a component. Sometimes just your timing or a particular pick can make your game viral rather than another game as good as the one of you.  As I said: giving for granted that everything is done properly."
IndieDev,39kz0n,solowebnv,2,Tue Jun 16 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely.  You may -never- get that one that sells a half a billion copies, or leads you to hundreds of thousands of dollars a day in add-on sales, or whatever kind of monetization model you might try to follow.  Don't -try- to do that.  You can't -try- to do that, and succeed, if your measure of success is to be on the same level as those games mentioned above, in terms of sales or income.  Because no matter how great your software, how great your game design, how great everything else... it may just not click the right things at the right time.  If you even want to get -noticed- you need to find an audience, preferably before you even get your games out there.  Once you get noticed, then you can worry about increasing the size of the audience."
IndieDev,39kz0n,FormerGameDev,2,Tue Jun 16 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"Right. Finding the audience perfect for your game is really the starting point to build your base. I think that indie devs (included myself) have to cope with the fact that working on a game is such a big dedication that we get a bit blind sometimes, we can't really see that our game might have issues or is just not for All the gamers, sort of mother-baby relation therefore we start pushing it in the wrong direction. But if you can aim to the right (even if small) audience you will have a devoted and solid base to start with."
IndieDev,39g0tf,nickofnight,3,Thu Jun 11 13:56:12 2015 UTC,"That looks very cool and a bit like exactly what I've been after.  I can't access it properly at the moment because I'm at work, but could you (or someone) tell me...does it support alternative project cycles?  I work full time and am still very much in the learning stages of both development and 3D modelling and animation, so I'd be looking for other more casual developers or those without strict deadlines or that require 100+ hours a week.  Is this something that would be viable via this service?"
IndieDev,39g0tf,stolen_art,2,Thu Jun 11 14:01:31 2015 UTC,Hi stolen_art yes! A lot of the projects are rev share and are looking for part timers. There are quite a few looking for modelling/animation artists - your skills are in high demand :)

IndieDev,39g0tf,kairon156,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:43:21 2015 UTC,how does managing a project work?  I have several ideas for games but I'm just barley learning the Unreal4 engine because I don't need to code with it.  I've often thought that if I was serous about making one of my games that I might need to higher others to do my work for me.
IndieDev,39g0tf,kairon156,2,Sun Jun 14 18:29:54 2015 UTC,"Sure, hiring qualified people is a great way of doing it. Rev Share is popular too, but you need a demo or a very good project plan to persuade qualified people to work for you with payment upfront.  Regarding managing a project on the site - if you start a project you get a team section where you have your own forum, file uploading area, blog, shout box etc. You can set up welcome emails for team mates and stay in touch easily. But to be honest this is an area I would like to make better soon - group chat and and then a gant chart/to-do list are on my own to-do list. Right now most teams swap skype details and talk on there."

IndieDev,397k3a,continuumlr,3,Tue Jun 9 20:44:38 2015 UTC,"It's very difficult in the mobile market right now, especially if you don't have something really unusual.   The game should be finished, but not released. So get the game approved on the app store, but don't actually launch the game immediately and use press codes or test flight to let reviewers play the game. Typically you want reviewers to be writing/publishing reviews on or around launch day, so timing wise, we're talking a week or so before launch day to start contacting them about reviews. Of course, it helps get those reviewers' attention if you have been building contacts and relationships with those reviewers in the months or years before. Try to avoid Christmas/holiday seasons, unless your game is season/holiday themed. Or for example, if it's a soccer game, the women's world cup is on the TV at the moment, so releasing in time to coincide with that could be a good way to set yourself apart. Also try to avoid major releases. It's not always easy to predict these with mobile, but for example E3 is this/next week, so now is not a good time to release. Not used any of these services. I hear they're not worthwhile unless you have big cash to spend. Don't pay for press releases. They're fairly easy to write and practicing drafting press releases really helps focus your mind on what the core message you're sending for the game is."

That's all there is to it for now."

IndieDev,396o8j,CoffeeWithCross,5,Tue Jun 9 21:42:13 2015 UTC,"If you're employing people you need either a sizable amount of money put away (at least six month's wages, bills, rent, etc) or an adequate income from the get go.    You may be happy to work for 'free' in the hopes you'll reap a reward later, but you can't expect your employees to do the same.  The simplest thing you can do is freelance/contract work to pay the bills and fund the games you actually want to make.

Also, you could try using systems like blueprint in Unreal 4 which don't require you to know C++, only general algorithms and programming concepts.  I'd personally recommend Unreal 4 with Blueprint, unless you need to program in Java, otherwise try looking into Java game frameworks like I mentioned."

In my opinion there is good documentation how to use the engine, it's easy–medium to setup and has examples on various topics.  As with most things it can take a day or two untli you start to get a sense of how the engine is working, especially if you haven't worked in one before. Don't worry, be comfortable about being confused :)  A last thing. Do something extremely simple. Tetris, snake or something as a starters.

IndieDev,38sq2d,DenGuuleBaron,8,Sat Jun 6 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"""No Hacker's Sky""  Good news everyone!   We're team Tellurians. A team consisting of a programmer (with an extra programmer giving advice every now and then), a 3D artist, a technical artist, and a composer. Fun fact: none of us knew each other before the start of this game jam.   We apologize very much for the lack of updates, we've been very busy working on the game (we actually started writing this post three. days ago, but we kept getting distracted) Our artist is hard at work on some 3D content, the programmer (me) is working on the guts of the game, and the technical artist is developing our UI. Most of the game consists of a minimalistic UI-looking design for two reasons: firstly, we want to drive home you are a guy looking at a computer screen. Second, it's so we can focus as a team on ways to solidify gameplay mechanics.  We decided early that a lot of people in this game jam would probably see 'exploration' as being a form of frontier, so we expected to see a lot of spaceships and submarines. We opted to take the road less travelled, and make something many people might not think of as exploration: we are making a game about hacking, exploring networks and planets, as well as taking down an evil organization.    TL;DR: You play as a hacker who wants to disclose what an evil space mining corporation is really doing in space.  In our game, you are both a space enthusiast and a “security expert”. You start out by hacking into the network of a huge space mining corporation called Extrasolar Mining Corp (EMC), who has deployed probes, satellites and manned stations on distant planets and moons. As you progress through their large network you learn more and more about the fact that they have hired scientists for evil. The scientists were paid off to declare that EMC’s activities were not damaging the local ecosystems of the off world areas they were mining and performing various secret experiments on. You set out to hack into progressively more hardened network areas, eventually leading to control of satellites and drones on distant planets. You intend to discover the truth, and take down the evil organization.    Here's some of the art we have. so far (everything is still WIP)  Current look of the node map (you can switch the blue color to other colors by commands), command prompt, and node world, all in-game. You can see some in-game planets and drones if you look further down in this post:   Command prompt. Current features include being able to TAB through available a combination of commands and arguments. (Shift + TAB to cycle backwards) If you have already written something, it'll try to pick a similar one, IE. if you write ""he"" and press TAB, it'll write ""help"", and if you write ""nav"" and press TAB, it'll pick the first command + argument in the list of ""nav"" arguments, presumably ""nav options"", which takes you to the domain holding options commands. Arrow key up and down cycles through the previous things you wrote. So, this command prompt is actually a very central part of the game. We haven't gone very much in-depth with all the uses of it, but you'll use this for things like accessing the node maps, changing options, and more. Current state of the node map. The ""Node"" nodes have been hacked and can fully be accessed. The grey ""?"" nodes are unexplored/not-hacked-yet nodes, no access to them yet. The black ""?"" node is an unexplored always-visible node. The always-visible node will feature things like a big loot room, where big amounts of passwords and data can be collected from. First node world. You have to enter a node to hack and gain access to other nodes. This is a concept (in-game) of how the worlds may look like. Here it's a simple platforming puzzle, with the twist of you having to manually activate and deactivate the platforms. Basically they'll all be hidden at first, and you have to use the computer to activate/deactivate them with commands. The computer.   Node Map and Hacking Mockups (will look different in-game), including some of the ""Tool Programs"" (hound, rogue and cat):   Network nodes map. This is the 'overall view', where you see each network you have access to. The networks then contain smaller nodes, in the form of entities, or single systems, such as computers and surveillance cameras. Entity nodes view, with tooltips. Entity node access view. Basically each node will have a set of things you can access, depending on what kind of node it is.  Emails. Emails will be a pretty big part of the game. We have a major game feature hidden in this, that we'd like to keep a secret so far. Spam emails. Some spam emails may hold a virus you can use to infect nodes to gain access.   (And now the tool programs, still mockups)   Cat is a logger that snoops passwords and other data from nodes. Cat has found some new things! Hound will sniff out dangerous nodes, where traps may lay ahead, that would alert system admins of your presence. Hound is scanning. Yes, you'll be able to change the colors of both command prompt text, and the general GUI colors. Hound has sniffed something out! Rogue can be used to find and disarm traps in adjacent nodes. Rogue has found something! Rogue is trying to disarm the trap. Rogue failed! Rogue succeeded!   EMC (Extrasolar Mining Corp) Logo:   Concepts (we chose the top left one). 2D Logo. 3D Logo.     Drones:   Explorer Drone: Render, In-Game. Flying Drone (Concept): Render, In-Game. Security Drone: Render, In-Game.   Planets:   Red Planet (gonna be much bigger):    Render of planet. the base. Super Death Lazor.  An orbital laser EMC is using for experiments. Laser In-Game. In-Game.  Snow Planet (concept):    The planet. The base (it's big). Hangar.  Control room (remember, concept, sitll WIP). The elevator. Locker room. Rest room. Basic armory room.      Hope you like everything so far! Let us know what you think.   We are probably going to continue working on it after the game jam has ended, since we can easily add lots and lots of things to the game. Stay tuned for updates!    Edit: Added pictures of email mockups and some more progress on the big base."

I'll start working hard after I finish my history essay.  I am planning on having the game start off with the player getting shipwrecked on an island. You will have to repair the ship and hunt for food. Then you will sail around and explore a bunch of islands to try to find your way back to civilization. You will need to keep gathering supplies from the islands as you go to survive.  The sailing will be top down 2D and the islands will probably be 2D sidescrolling.  I'm making it using Phaser in JavaScript.
IndieDev,38sq2d,Elit3dGaming,2,Sat Jun 6 14:47:28 2015 UTC,so how's phaser? does water prove difficult to implement?  I would like some implementation of water in my 2d side scroller.   I am currently learning pixi.js .  would learn phaser once I get enough experience with pixi.

IndieDev,38sq2d,DaveSilver,2,Mon Jun 8 10:52:05 2015 UTC,"I think I have a cool concept.    The objective is to in a sense, not die:   You start as a space settler.  You have limited fuel and need to find a good planet (if possible because every time you start the game its different) to land on and start a base. No planet is perfect.  You need resources to continue life. Every planet has a different make up of resources.  A good starting planet would have lots of water and plutonium.  Rare metals help later on in the game. You use the resources on the planet to progress in game. You need enough energy to support regular activities (which requires plutonium), the more advanced the activities, the more energy you consume.  For instance, creating oxygen requires low energy (early game), creating a research and development facility (which requires rare metals you need to find and is late game) require a lot of energy. You need water to support life and create food You need rare metals to create new weapons and shields for your ship, to create pods to create new colonies, and buildings to make the game advance (these give you upgrades, like mining upgrades) The universe is hostile, but also interesting.  The game should be difficult.  Also random events or objects should be scattered on planets. Artifacts can have R&D advancements Failed colonies can have stored resources which add to your pool Meteor crashes can destroy colonies etc...   The map should be BIG.  Every time you start a game, a random amount of planets should be generated, which are a random size, have random amounts of resources, have random bonuses (artifacts colonies etc) and are randomly placed.  Throughout gameplay random events should occur which make the game easier and more challenging at times.  If you like these ideas and want help fully developing them out let me know.  I have plenty more and even visual ideas as well."

IndieDev,38sq2d,kvothe5688,3,Tue Jun 9 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"I've started working on an ""unofficial"" jam project. I've been learning WebGL recently, so I've mostly just been toying around, but I've gotten a basic terrain generator up and running (screenshot).  I'm planning on adding infinite scrolling this afternoon, then I have a bunch of plans for making things more procedural and less random. In particular, I want to lay down a road network to make the terrain more traversable.  The shaders in the screenshot above are also fairly preliminary. I've played with them just enough to know that I'm sort of capable of writing custom shaders, but there's way too much other stuff to be done to be fiddling with them.  I'm really liking WebGL as a platform (supported by three.js). It's quite cool to see this demo running comfortably in a browser, though again I still have some work to do to make sure that the procedural generation aspect doesn't slow things down.  I don't know if there will be much ""game"" aspect to this anytime soon. My checklist of things to do mostly involves various procedural modeling tricks I want to try out, but if I ever manage to get through those, I was thinking of gamifying the demo by tracking various records you could break by exploration (e.g. tallest mountain visited, fastest travel across several zones, etc.)"

IndieDev,38sq2d,lancejz,2,Sat Jun 6 16:57:53 2015 UTC,"Okay so the TLDR of my game is, you're stranded on a desert island, and have to survive either until you can signal for rescue, or just until you get bored. The island you play on is randomly generated, and you'll be forced to build shelter, craft weapons, and hunt/scavenge for food to survive.  I got started a few days late, but I spent most of this week focusing on Island generation, and optimization to ensure the game can function correctly.  Right now the map is about 20,000 x 20,000 pixels, and takes 1.5 minutes to traverse straight through the middle, depending on various factors. I want the map to be bigger, but map generation currently takes 2.5 minutes on average, so until I cut down the generation time, I don't plan on expanding map sizes.   Despite that, things are going very well. I have player movement integrated, I've added boundaries to the island so the player can't just walk off into the ocean, and I started adding random obstacles and scenery generation. I've also started thinking about how different mechanics will work, and developing some basic systems.  You can see some examples of the current map generation here: http://imgur.com/0Dxgq7H  You can also see a screenshot of the game itself here: http://imgur.com/r9uwXew Right now it's not very impressive, and the trees don't look great because I had to scale up the original graphic, but I'lll be working on textures/sprites soon, so hopefully it'll look a little better by Monday or Tuesday.  Finally, the system I worked on today that I'm most happy with, is the map screen. I was able to integrate a system where the map is only revealed as you explore the island. So on this image you can see a fairly small island, and what it looks like immediately after the player spawns: http://imgur.com/p34fkSV  And this image you can see what the map looks like after the player has explored a bit more: http://imgur.com/r9uwXew,p34fkSV,0Dxgq7H,tHwGwNT#3  And the red x represents the player's position.  I'll have anothe rupdate on Monday, hopefully with some enemies, or basic gameplay systems in place."
IndieDev,38sq2d,PearElite,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"The last week I haven't gotten quite as much done as I'd like, but Im making decent progress.   The biggest improvement I made is that I imporved map generation and it now only takes about 1.5 minutes to generate a full map. It's still not as optimized as I'd like, but I'm getting closer.  On top of that, I started implementing the basic gameplay systems such as weapons, hp, stamina, and hunger. You can see a screenshot here: http://imgur.com/W3LyQZo.  Right now the only two weapons I have are the Axe(http://imgur.com/wMgc4V7) and Spear(http://imgur.com/RKMolt6), but tomorrow Ill be adding in a knife, and a bow and arrow. The graphics for both are pretty shitty right now, but im focusing primarily on gameplay so im trying not to worry about it too much. Im pretty happy because I was able to get the damage system to work exactly the way I want, and limit the damage period of each weapon to only specific frames of their attack animations. This should make the combat more skill-oriented, and force you to be careful when you attack.  As for stamina and hunger I have a pretty good system worked out. Hunger or Stomach as it's listed on screen constantly decreases and forces you to find or kill food. Once stomach reaches zero, you start losing stamina, and eventually you start losing HP. Most likely, once I have food for the player to eat I will make it so that as long as your hunger is above 50% after eating, it will take a minimum amount of time before it begins decreasing again, but I'll figure out the logistics of that when I get there.  I also integrated a running and sneaking system. Running consumes stamina, and so does using a weapon. If you're not moving you regenerate stamina at a decent rate, and if you are moving but aren't running you regenerate stamina at half the standard rate.  Finally, I also did some minor work to make images that will ease the transition between tile types which you can see on the border of water. This was just a first pass, and I already know how to solve the issue with corners, but I wanted to focus on gameplay before I go more heavily into that system.  Tomorrow I am going to make the other two weapon types, and hopefully build the crafting/resource system. Then, I may work more on it on Friday, but either way Im going to do 8+ hours on Saturday, and 10+ hours on Sunday to build enemies, optimize, and polish up the gameplay and graphics as much as possible."

It doesn't have a name yet, but basically the game is about you being an archeologist who must dig up artifacts to gain additional funding to keep digging. The ""archeological site"" is procedurally generated, so no play-through is the same twice.   Here is a link to the build (Windows Only)  There aren't any art assets to the game yet, as the alpha was more about getting the mechanics down than making it look/sound good. Please give it a play and leave some feedback as comment. I can't guarantee I'll be able to address all the feedback, as this game is much more ambitious than the one I made for the First Mixtape, and with only a week left, I can't really afford to make big sweeping changes to the mechanics, but all feedback is appreciated, and might be useful if I decide to take this game beyond this Mixtape.

To make matters worse I've been having a few computer issues.  Not to worry though!  I'm keeping high hopes and hoping to get started tomorrow!  My concept is similar to others, but I'm still considering whether I want to make it a 3D procedurally side scroller or a first person procedurally generated exploration. The general basis for the game is that you're a lone astronaut on a distant and unexplored planet and you have to go around collecting ground/air samples for later research,  it will most likely be done in unity 5.  I have created some basic 2D character art which you can check out here if you so wish.  Well that's it for now, I'm keeping high hopes that I'll be able to finish in time.  If not, I'll continue to work on it and post it when I'm done!  EDIT: Took a break from my paper to make this post and have been chilling out to this while writing and had an epiphany.

IndieDev,38orqr,Synersteel,6,Fri Jun 5 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"Well sir, it's a good game for 12 hours, but you asked for feedback, so here we go.  I played it for about a minute before muting it.  In general, the weakest point of the game is the sound design, mainly because it's all too harsh.  The gun sound is very loud, the voice clips are way too long, and get boring quickly, overall it's just too much.  You gotta remember, these are sounds that are going to be playing ALOT, so you don't want anything that isn't good in repetition.  The gameplay is very smooth, and the controls are responsive, which is great.  I feel like the cars are way too big though, they take up a ton of the screen, which makes it much trickier to dodge bullets.  The bullets are pretty tough to see against the backdrop sometimes too, but they take a 3rd of your health, so you best be keeping your eyes out.  Consider making things in the foreground contrasting colors vs things in your background.  Everything moves pretty slow, which makes it less action-y feeling, but that is very much by necessity, due to how big everything is.  If enemies were smaller, you could start giving them legit movement/attacking patterns which would be super sweet.  Think R-Type/Gradius.  Overall, it plays well, but there's not much variety to it, so there's no real reason to play it for too long.  This is obviously due to the 12 hour time limit though, so it's an easy thing to overlook.  It's a great start for a game, and if you'd wanna keep going with it, I'd say go for it, just get rid of all the 5th element stuff and make it an original creation with some powerups, pre-defined levels and better enemies."
IndieDev,38orqr,Highsight,3,Fri Jun 5 17:42:37 2015 UTC,"Hi Highsight!  Nick here, I did all the coding for Taxi Chase while my brother Anthony did the art and sound.  Very helpful feedback, and I really appreciate you taking the time to provide it.  The two big negatives you pointed out are the audio and the scale of everything. This makes perfect sense because those are two areas where we spent the least amount of time.  You're correct on both fronts; better sounds and quicker action could have resulted in a much flashier, ""juicier"" experience.  These are two areas we'll be sure to pay much closer attention to in the future.  You have a great idea about the contrast between the foreground and the background as well.  This was our first foray into 2D with a lot of action going on, so we struggled with some aspects of it.  High contrast is a good rule to keep in mind for the future.  Once again, thanks a ton for trying the game out and giving us your thoughts!"
IndieDev,38orqr,NickJVaccaro,3,Fri Jun 5 22:26:05 2015 UTC,"Haha, I LOVE that ""juicier"" is becoming a known indistry term.  It save so much time when explaining things.  For a first try at a 2D game (and again, with the time frame) I'd say you guys did a bang-up job.  Keep it up. :)"
IndieDev,38orqr,Highsight,3,Sat Jun 6 03:57:55 2015 UTC,"Anthony here, the artist for Taxi Chase.  Thank you for your feedback!  All of your points are on our post-mortem for this project, so you're on our precise wavelength with it!  That's actually really exciting to me, as the lessons we've learned from this were mostly our failures with it, which you've captured exactly.  We learned a lot from this game.  The backdrop was my first attempt at 2D backgrounds, and I wanted to get my feet wet with parallax motion.  It was originally even harder to contrast between foreground/background, but luckily Nick threw in a ""grey screen"" quick-fix to lower the contrast enough to be bearable.  The sound was on my requirements sheet for the jam, and I admit my failure in adequately balancing them.  We did so little testing by the last hour that the sound problem slipped right under the radar.  I would remedy that immediately if we were continuing production on Taxi Chase, so thank you for pointing it out.  I really like your suggestion of an R-Type/Gradius game feel.  We've played Gradius in the past, in particular, and that would be a really great direction to take with Taxi Chase.  It would require a resizing of all the assets by at least 1/2, but that needs to be done anyway.  They are too large.  Thank you again, Highsight, for both the testing and the feedback!"
IndieDev,38orqr,PantherOne,3,Fri Jun 5 23:27:58 2015 UTC,"Cheers mate, I always say anyone willing to take feedback deserves it.  It looks like you guys understand the idea of trying things and learning from them, which is absolutely the right attitude.  If you ever want/need more feedback, feel free to hit me up!  I do this kinda stuff all the time because I love doing it."
IndieDev,38orqr,Highsight,3,Sat Jun 6 03:56:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/highsight about the sound; that police siren especially was much louder than everything else.  I did like the gun noises, though.  I was a little confused by the floating hologram-looking things over some cars.  In the language of games, if something is floating, spinning, and glowing, it's probably a powerup that I should go get.  Apparently those are obstacles though, so it was somewhat frustrating to die when I touched one.  Otherwise, I'm very impressed with what you accomplished in 12 hours.  It feels complete, if simple, and you clearly understand scope."
IndieDev,38orqr,sirblastalot,2,Fri Jun 5 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"Hey Mr. Blastalot!  Nick here, I did the coding for Taxi Chase while my brother Anthony did the sound and art.  Glad you enjoyed the game!  The two of us are usually the only ones to play our jam games, so it's nice to receive a bit of praise.  You bring up a good point about the hologram-looking things over the lunchboats.  They actually are beneficial, when you pick them up you gain health.  However, we placed them very close to the lunchboats.  What probably happened was that you tried to grab them you hit into the boat itself and ended up taking damage.  This happened to me a few times, but I was so close to the game mechanics that I never thought of it as a bad thing.  I really should have separated them a bit more, or made it more obvious that they're helpful but that you have to be wary of getting too close to the lunchboat.  I'm particularly happy that you pointed out the understanding of scope.  That's been something we struggled with for a while, and the game jams have really helped us learn how to manage scope.  We probably use the word ""scope"" over a dozen times during the game design phase of the jams, which is usually only about an hour.  It's vital to any game project, especially jams.  At any rate, thanks again for testing the game out!  We both really appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback."
IndieDev,38orqr,NickJVaccaro,2,Fri Jun 5 22:39:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, Sir!  Anthony the artist here.  Thank you for the feedback and thanks, especially, for just playing the game!  As for the sound problems, thanks for pointing them out.  The sounds and music were on my sheet for completion during the jam, and I admit I definitely undershot their potential.  As the primary visual artist, I always try to complete the visual art first before moving into the audio, and that ends up showing here.  The holograms are beneficial to you and give you ""+1 Health"" if you acquire them without touching a lunchboat while you do so.  But they are a bit too close to the lunchboats, and after our 12 hours were up we discussed making them more obviously Health pickups.  That's something we failed at and would need to change appropriately.  Thank you for playing and thank you again for the feedback, Sir!  We're glad you enjoyed it as much as you're able to, even with its obvious shortcomings!"

My game can definitely get pretty hard, but I think the early levels do a good job of easing you in and building up your skill level. Might be worth trying, in my 100% completely unbiased opinion ;) Regardless, I appreciate the feedback!"
IndieDev,38p97y,Pkittens,2,Fri Jun 5 23:17:58 2015 UTC,"I actually played it a bit now, following your unbiased recommendation ;). I think it's better gameplay-wise than Shape Twister is, for two reasons:        It's very obvious what colour-state you are in, since the background changes with it. This is not the case in Shape Twister Orbs coming from all sides gives a better overview.     But I kept blocking a direction of orbs with my hand, and lost due to not seeing that. Visually the game is good, but the menu elements are not. The filler colour in the progress meter is out of place. The shaders on buttons are quite poor compared to the juicy stroke on the text.      I don't know whether the medals I unlocked were bronze or gold. Since it was the notice levels I'm assuming gold, but it's pretty brown ;) In level select, why is the back-button brown? Red/blue/brown madness :o"
IndieDev,38p97y,Pkittens,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:08:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for playing it and providing feedback. I really appreciate it! It's nice to hear that I made some good design decisions :) Let me address your points:   I too sometimes end up blocking an incoming orb with my hand. I thought a lot about how to avoid this issue, but there isn't really an easy solution. Well, I could make a designated tapping area where orbs don't spawn, but I wanted to utilize as much of the screen as possible. Perhaps, though, I could shrink the top UI a bit and add a bottom UI with a switch color button (thus still keeping the play area a square). I agree with you about the lack of polish on the progress meter and other UI elements. It was one of those things where I had to make a conscious decision to leave it ""good enough"" in order to actually force myself to finish the game. However, I do intend to actually completely overall the visual look of all the menus and UI elements (like making smaller icon-based buttons instead of giant text-based buttons). You probably got the Bronze medal if it looks brownish. You're right, though, that the bronze and gold medals look similar. Unfortunately I am not an artist, so doing all of the artwork was a challenge, but I'm trying to improve everyday! This album shows the bronze and gold medals side-by-side. I definitely need to improve their looks. Yeah, the level select back button was another element I wasn't too happy with but just left it in order to finish. It is actually a lighter orange color, but the shading does make it look brownish. It's added to my ""make better"" list now.   Thanks again!"
IndieDev,38p97y,bobcat,2,Sat Jun 6 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure about how you should fix the ""hand-over-orbs""-issue - having a designated spot for the hand probably won't look as nice. Maybe an indicator in the middle saying where the orb is coming ;). If you removed the smiley face from the bronze medal then that'd be a easy way to tell them apart :D"
IndieDev,38p97y,bobcat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a ""switch color"" button might be ugly... I'll keep thinking about it. Having an incoming orb directional indicator is an interesting idea. It might get a little cluttered, though, in the later levels when orbs are flying in from every direction at high velocity. Then again, depending on how I did it, it could also add to the visual appeal...  I would remove the face from the bronze medal, if I wasn't so adamant about maintaining the ""face on an circle"" theme :p I think I just need to improve their looks. Luckily, there are plenty of games to use as a reference!"
IndieDev,38ikv6,jaggygames,2,Thu Jun 4 13:29:58 2015 UTC,"Now I'm at work so I haven't actually tried the game, but from the screen shot on the post, here are my initial thoughts:  Have you thought about making the skills/item icons/context buttons hexagonal? I think it would add a bit of consistency to the UI that I feel is missing right now.  Add a little bit of padding to the resources so they aren't ""touching"" the border. I would say 2-5 pixels should be plenty to the top and left.   The resources themselves feel like they aren't aligned well, specifically it looks like the number to the right of the shard icon looks ever so slightly farther way. I also would recommend reordering them - maybe from left to right, party number, gold, shard, AP. This would put the party number furthest away from the center of the screen (in theory it would be changing the least), and group AP and shards which both appear to be used (or potentially used) on any given turn. I also like the idea of gold being closer to the center of the screen as it is your ""score"" so it is ideally the most important over all, so it might just need a little reworking.  On the subject of items (currently rat tooth and health potion) I feel like shards should be unrelated as items are ""physical things"" themselves, and shards should instead be exclusively for skills, a sort of ""power up"" if you like. Edit: some items it would make sense to use shards for, like a spell book or even something that could ""create"" another item (say a brewing stand which could create health potions)\edit  Anyway, I can't wait to get home and give the game a test drive. I'll let you know any other thoughts I have after that!"
IndieDev,38ikv6,Qyv,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my blog!   Have you thought about making the skills/item icons/context buttons hexagonal?   I haven't but I'm experimenting with the UI at the minute and will have a look at making them hexagonal. I worry it'll be too much hex though. We'll see!   The resources themselves feel like they aren't aligned well .. it might just need a little reworking   You have a good eye! The AP isn't actually shared by the team (it was before) - it's the amount for the currently selected unit so I don't think it really belongs up there. I've been thinking of displaying it for each unit but I haven't found a pleasing way to do it yet.   shards should instead be exclusively for skills   This is tricky because I want items to be impactful or useful when they are used. My reasoning for adding a Shard requirement to them is so they can be more powerful because they can be used less as Shards are so rare.  There are skills which will use Shards and are super powerful. One of the Barbarian class passives in development increases the damage of Whirlwind, adds a heal and slows enemies at the cost of it requiring a Shard.  Thanks again! I look forward to reading more feedback if you get the chance to test it!"
IndieDev,38ikv6,Qyv,2,Fri Jun 5 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"After playing 2 short games My other two comments are: (1)Restart button - I thought I found a bug but had to close out and reopen to test, which leads to (2) Any character can use an AP to summon a rat, but only the original can ""place"" it - so a rat half way across the battle field will use the rat tooth, but then it puts the options for where to summon it over by the original barbarian.   Oh, and it would be nice to maintain the zoom level when advancing levels."

One thing I suggest, some of the bullets that the purple square slime things fire, blend in too well into some of the floors making it difficult to dodge them. Also an indicator on the health position would be good. For example having a big ""Q"" next to it would help."

I've had family issues I've been dealing with so I've not had time to be online much. I guess I'll make a top down space shooter where the player collects minerals to upgrade that the enemy also collects from asteroids. The player needs to keep the enemy from collecting enough for it to build the end boss before the player is ready.  So it is a race to the finish and you have to explore to find asteroids. That is simple enough to get something done just under two weeks in my free time. It will have juts place holder graphics, my girl is the artist in our team, and she is very busy now. Thank you for allowing me to participate."
IndieDev,37we2e,DaveSilver,2,Tue Jun 2 22:32:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm a bit late to the party, but I finally have an idea I'm ready to run with, and I think people will enjoy. I'm going to make a survival game where the player has crash landed on an island in their boat, and is forced to explore the island and survive for as long as they can, possibly until someone comes to save them.   The island will be randomly generated, and the game will be done from a top-down perspective.   I already have a pretty good idea of how I'm going to generate the island dynamically when the game starts, and since that's the big draw to my game, I'll be working on that tonight. Hopefully I'll have something to show-off before I go to sleep tonight. Anyway, wish me luck, and I'll see you all again soon for my first update. :-)"
IndieDev,37we2e,DaveSilver,2,Tue Jun 2 22:56:05 2015 UTC,"So today I have an update, but it is text only. So I have a basic island generator working, and simple movement. It creates non-uniform islands which currently all take a circle-like shape, but they tend to be pretty different on the edges and in where ponds and lakes end up. I worked hard to try and make the island shapes more variable, but at this point I decided I needed to move on for the sake of the jam. The islands currently take about 30-45 seconds to cross if you go straight through, but I plan on adding things like randomly generated obstacles, enemies, and things to find all over the island, so hopefully the player will be discouraged from doing that. I also may slow down the player's speed, or increase the grid size to make the game feel a bit larger.   Right now the island generator only creates one tile type, but tomorrow I plan on adding in some randomization for tile types to make it so that the island has beaches towards the edge, and forests towards the center. I also plan on setting up spawning tomorrow. Right now the player spawns in the corner of the map, which is technically in the water, but my plan is to make a system which will spawn the player on the edge of the island in a randomly chosen grid region. Finally, tomorrow I will see if it's possible to add a very basic day/night cycle.  The one thing I'm concerned about right now is whether I am going to be able to save maps, or whether it'll be a one and done situation. I think if I save the random seed generated by the game before the map is made, I should be able to consistently get the same map, but I haven't tested that too heavily in the past, so I'll have to see.   At this point, I can already tell that I have more ideas than what I'll be able to accomplish, but tomorrow I'm going to do some serious brainstorming to pare-down my ideas, and figure out what matters most. I also am considering continuing to work on this game even after the jam, so maybe I can expand on those ideas in that way."
IndieDev,37we2e,DaveSilver,3,Thu Jun 4 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, so today I got back to my game and realized the island generation system had some flaws in it which I had to correct. Eventually I was able to work them out, but I spent about an hour and a half doing it.  After that, I increased the grid size like I said I might, and bumped up the map size slightly so it should take closer to a minute to go straight through at top speed. It's still not that long, but hopefully I can make the island interesting enough to discourage the player from doing that.  From there I started optimizing the game a bit and added a culling distance for objects. Now if something isn't within one full screen length it won't be taking up processor power, and the game should run more smoothly overall.  Finally, I started adding in variation to hex types. (The island is built on a hex grid btw). Right now the different variants don't do anything except add some color, but they help a lot in making it clear what the island will be like overall when you look at it all at once.  If you go here: http://imgur.com/TJKydxE you can check out six random islands I created in the most recent version. At this point the shape/size variation is still pretty limited, and the islands all have pretty similar distributions of lakes, grass, and forests.  The first thing I'll do tomorrow will be to add some randomly generated rocky hexes which will be impassable, and then I'm going to give all the percentages for random element generation a range so that there will be a bit more randomness between different islands. I also may make variable map sizes. I'm not sure right now what the maximum size I can get is, but hopefully I can make it a little bigger without much issue. Hopefully tomorrow I can also get to some of the stuff I wanted to do today, but missed."

IndieDev,37we2e,CooperAMA,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'm using Game Maker for the game.

IndieDev,37we2e,Elit3dGaming,2,Wed Jun 3 09:37:17 2015 UTC,"A little update...Just recently, I just thought of a concept that is a bit more concrete from the last idea I've posted, though it still needs to be tweaked.   The basis of it is that the player assumes the role of an anti-virus cell with the responsibility of keeping the main computer system free from viruses. As you're exploring, you are basically “scanning” the environment where over time, new viruses (spyware, trojans, etc.) will pop up and you have to get rid of them in specific ways before they cause damage to the system.   With that concept in mind, this will be a solo project. One idea was that I wanted to make an isometric-style environment, but I am still working on ideas for the game mechanic and the art style."

The catch is that you have limited funds, and each section of ground you dig up costs you money. The only way to get more money is to find artifacts that will convince the museum you are working for to give you more funds.  The site you work on is going to be procedurally generated, so it'll be different each time, and I'm thinking the digging will be much like how the digging works in Terraria."

I definitely don't wanna take one since a more competent dev could produce something better with the time/space. I need something to kick me into gear and this seems like a fun jam. I've done two Ludum dares and am switching to UE4 from Unity, so the next project being two weeks would let me do that without the pressure of time as much."
IndieDev,37ip8u,galacticdude7,3,Thu May 28 04:14:39 2015 UTC,"Like /u/galacticdude7 mentioned, there's the tips jar aspect and 16 is just manageable for me to take care of and everyone still gets something they might appreciate if there are tips.  Also, the mix tapes are based on the game mix tapes of the 80s. You could buy a cassette full of mini games for your computer. 16 is in the spirit of ""16-bit"" to keep the theme going... but you know... someday the mix tape might be upgraded to a 32-bit system."
IndieDev,37ip8u,CooperAMA,2,Thu May 28 08:33:16 2015 UTC,"I participated in the 1st Mixtape, and the reason why there are only 16 slots is because the idea behind the mixtape is that people will leave tips of dogecoin and bitcoin for the developers as a whole and those would be split evenly among the developers. ( It wasn't much for the first mixtape, I think I got a bit less than a dollar total from it).  Frankly though I wouldn't worry about taking a spot from a better dev. The first Mixtape filled all 16 slots, but 5 people had to drop out and didn't finish their games, and the second one didn't fill up all 16 slots."

I'm in the process of porting my games to WebGL with Unity and it's going OK so far.  The current game I'm working on Energy Island Conquest is based on the premise, in a waterworld style future, that the drone/droid armies of the world get smart and take over.    So it's the player's job to fight back and reclaim the world.  I only ever did one level of the game, would it be OK to take the basis of this single level game and try and make it more open world and explorable?"

The most effective way I've found so far to get people to notice my game is through Twitter and posting frequent updates. If your game is interesting people will start to follow you. There are also certain hashtags such as #gamedev that will get your tweet retweeted by certain accounts.

IndieDev,37c7u8,SketchyLogic,1 point,Tue May 26 17:28:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think Nintendo are as C&D obsessed as people claim.   They've let the high-profile, fan-made Mother 4 go free with zero contention. They generally let Pokemon fan-games live, including the widely-used online battle simulators. Mario World hacks and mods can be found in abundance. SSB Brawl+ and Project M both live freely. Project M in particular is enormous, but at worst Nintendo has issued statements to the effect of, ""we don't approve, but we won't do anything to stop it"".   You want to see a reactionary company? Try SquareEnix."

IndieDev,373zw4,A_G_C,3,Sun May 24 17:46:08 2015 UTC,I'll be honest. I don't have a single fucking clue what I just watched. It was small and in a strip and gave me almost nothing to go off of mentally for what I should be expecting. It looked promising at first since the art and cinematography seemed interesting and then it just fizzled out and gave me the finger.  I'd suggest a bit more clarity or something. Just a super small image stretched out and some music doesn't do much for me. I want some idea of what I'm watching so I can look forward to it. Right now I don't give a flying fuck about your game but that might only be because I have no idea what it is.   You could have just had a white room with the words NOTDOBA written on the wall and the camera slowly pans towards it for 30s and then it ends.   I don't know what you're up to but a bit more transparency might do you some good for retaining potential viewers. The animation and music was catchy but it missed the punchline.
IndieDev,373zw4,Sciar,2,Mon May 25 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"I wasn't going to say anything unless OP specifically asked for feedback, but, yeah, pretty much exactly what they said."
IndieDev,373zw4,ulstdp,2,Mon May 25 03:03:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the near brutal (yet insanely welcome) critique! The entire game centralises around 2 players coming together to have it off in a single-lane arena, running towards each other, guns blazing. An aspect of that is a build-up, and everything fitted into the game encapsulates the sense that stuff's about to go down (these vignettes loading into a map, the music, gameplay etc.)  Sincerely I wanted to fit in a snippet of gameplay (even the first few moments of a round) near the end of the trailer, but felt like it wouldn't make sense to go back on what I'd already begun, a build-up, and wanting to continue with that, we end up with a white wall with nothing but a logo on it and some pretty pictures! Later down the line nearing release I will be covering everything in another trailer, and I'll keep what you've said in mind!  Thanks a bunch!"
IndieDev,373zw4,Sciar,1 point,Mon May 25 09:26:50 2015 UTC,No problem best of luck to you. I know how critical feedback has been for my game I wish you the best of luck with yours.

IndieDev,372k23,Rotorist,7,Sun May 24 07:04:25 2015 UTC,I too am in the exact same situation and I'm looking forward to people's inputs on this.  What I spent stupid amounts of time that didn't turn out as I expected;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NersfQUoooQ  This is probably 1000 times easier than your project but since I'm probably 1000 times dumber.. :)
IndieDev,372k23,cbt13,4,Sun May 24 10:53:17 2015 UTC,I like where this is going. It reminds me of geometry wars meets the fort condor mini game from ff7.   The Clean layout & simple design work here. I understand how to play just by watching and it's fun. Not sure if you have soundsFx  but can't hear it in the youtube.   Edit: the only thing I don't understand is the vertical white line and why the minus points. The white line gives me anxiety when it comes by but that seems intentional lol. Good work.
IndieDev,372k23,JoeFro0,3,Sun May 24 14:18:03 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks! The idea of the white line was something like this: I wanted to base everything on points. You start with 50k points and everything you do like shooting costs you points. But if you hit your shots you gain more, and if you shoot multiple enemies with the same ball you gain even more. And the white line takes away your points based on how many 'enemies' are on screen, so you need to get rid of them asap. And when an enemy hits you it takes away like 30k points based on its size.  I wanted to make this more skill based and this is what I came up with. Instead of 3 lives, you can play this forever. Buuuuut it doesn't really work right now imo it needs a lot more tweaking."
IndieDev,372k23,cbt13,2,Sun May 24 14:33:19 2015 UTC,Ahh I see. I like that bc it makes the player pick and choose when to shoot instead of constantly shooting without negative repercussions. You can up the difficulty by limiting shots or upping enemy count.
IndieDev,372k23,JoeFro0,2,Sun May 24 14:41:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, the game looks like my daughter would want to play too, she's very into shapes. I like these simple, strategic games!"

IndieDev,372k23,r_acrimonger,7,Sat May 30 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"This isn't a game, this is a tech demo. It seems fun enough. And just add context. What if you were chasing/hunting a helo at max speed through the heart of the city?  What if you had to blow up 10 enemies in 1 minute?  Your game is missing something because its not a game yet. The problem is not the input mechanics or the flight model its that actions don't matter (yet), there's no drama/tension, no objectives, no long term strategy that must be balanced against short term tactics.  In other words, you are just missing a game."
IndieDev,372k23,sopcen,2,Sun May 24 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"Yea I understand this totally... I've been trying to find a coherent gameplay/mission/objectives, its just so hard to do as a 3D game!"
IndieDev,372k23,ulstdp,5,Sun May 24 18:19:56 2015 UTC,"Visually it looks very nice to me. You need to add variety through enemy types or different challenges, such as protect a base or defeat a boss before a timer runs out. You seem to have a good base for the enemy so branching from that into new types shouldn't be too hard. I wouldn't give up on it, tweaking the gameplay enough and adding polish like screenshake and particle effects can make a huge difference"
IndieDev,372k23,ulstdp,2,Sun May 24 13:49:26 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll ponder on what types of variety I can create for the enemies :)
IndieDev,372k23,purleyboy,3,Sun May 24 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"There's also going to be a thousand reasons to quit but only one real reason to continue. Do you want to see the finished version of this?  I thought it looked great. I could imagine an homage to Urban Strike being doing in the engine. With the proper graphics and narrative and a few tweaks to gameplay, it could be sold on Steam. Steam being the way it is, you'd really just have to tweak the gameplay and add a bit more levels."
IndieDev,372k23,ulstdp,2,Sun May 24 12:07:21 2015 UTC,"I remember when I was a kid, one day I walked into a store and saw some people playing a helicopter game, I couldn't figure out what game it is for years. Now that you mentioned it, I think they were playing the strike series lol!"
IndieDev,372k23,JoeFro0,2,Sun May 24 18:17:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a game I still haven't identified from when I was a kid. It was in the early 90s. And I remember it was some kind of cave man with a stark green cartoonish contrast. And there was an egg involved as the central game device. No idea what it was."

You have a nice flight Sim going in already, but you are missing a engaging objective. Add heatseeking enemy missiles that must be shot down to up the difficulty.  Add to the ""Game Feel"" with more feedback from the bullets or when bullets hit buildings and or enemies. Sounds and music can make all the difference.  There are many directions you can go with this don't be discouraged. Maybe take a break from making this to clear your head. You've inspired me to continue to work on my game."
IndieDev,372k23,scalesXD,2,Sun May 24 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Now that you mention it, how would you suggest I can improve the feedback from bullets? Right now what I have is when the bullet hits a building, it stirs up a small particle smoke with debris flying off. If it hits an aircraft there's a spark and player hears a short shatter sound indicating the hit."
IndieDev,372k23,jmakegames,3,Sun May 24 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"I really like what you have there, Have you looked at the old Mega Drive (Genesis) Strike Series could give you some interesting ideas."

IndieDev,372k23,cinderwell,3,Sun May 24 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"You have an amazing skeleton there friend. Let's meat those bones shall we?  Mission based gameplay is what you need. Guard 3 buildings? Sometimes, hell sometime you gotta guard 5! Bosses, different maps with exit areas. Kill X enemies, survive for X seconds.  With the solid looking framework you have there are so many possibilities!    So keep the tower defense, it's a great level idea, just maybe not a great game idea.  p.s.  I would 100% be willing to write for you, more than likely for free."
IndieDev,372k23,brunzero,1 point,Sun May 24 15:25:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the ideas :) I think I should sit down and list out all the possible mission scenarios and see which one I can fit into the game:   tower defense attack enemy base destroy enemy battleships, in air or on water protect a ground convoy attack ground armored vehicles capable of AA  chase down and eliminate aircrafts   I'll see what else I can think of :)"
IndieDev,372k23,brunzero,3,Sun May 24 22:51:38 2015 UTC,"When making prototypes people tend to put far to much effort into ""core mechanics"", so much so that they miss the context surrounding a game.  Destiny is a good example of this. You could say it's core shooting mechanics are excellent, but the context of the players actions isn't interesting enough. I agree with most other comments stated here, you need objectives, and if not objectives something to frame the players action.   Give them a reason to shoot helicopters. And by providing interesting variations of objectives you can refresh the same gameplay and make it far more interesting.  So I wouldn't ditch this game. It looks great and the shooting mechanics are excellent. You need to make sure you have the passion for it too."
IndieDev,372k23,brunzero,1 point,Mon May 25 06:55:15 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. unfortunately the passion is long gone because I have been playing the exact same thing for a very long time, everyone would be bored from doing that. What kept me going this past 6 months is the hope to make a sample mission described in the post, which I have accomplished. This is only one simple mission out of all those I planned for, but the biggest problem is not with the mission and objectives, but rather with the fact that I really can't make the core gameplay itself ""grow"" over time. For example, if you play freelancer, you can work for better ships, better equipment and weapons, which give you a boost during combat; I""m afraid that these upgrades don't matter in my game (though I intentionally built the system around the ability to upgrade and I already have a few upgrades), because having them doesn't make you perform better, aside from dying slower due to more health/armor. It's like having better weapons in CoD multiplayer doesn't make you get more kills if you suck at aiming.   I'm still not sure whether I should ditch it or keep it, I guess I need the passion back somehow. Maybe taking a few weeks of break will help."
IndieDev,372k23,brunzero,1 point,Mon May 25 07:13:50 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be a good idea to take a break for a couple of weeks. If everyone ditched a game when they felt the passion was gone, very few games would be complete.  Take a month off and participate in game jams. Or if you wish try another hobby entirely. Revisit you game after the break and see how you feel."
IndieDev,372k23,HypnoToad0,1 point,Mon May 25 07:51:29 2015 UTC,"With my text file database, one can easily tune the stats to simulate better equipment/ship/weapons and test to see if having higher stats make the combat more fun (or less).

IndieDev,36kt4f,sopcen,2,Wed May 20 07:55:00 2015 UTC,Spelunky is very well done.  Maybe one of the penultimate examples of a bunch of extremely simple mechanics that come together into a very deep and interesting game.  Spelunky is practically a Rube Goldberg machine intent on the player's destruction.
IndieDev,36kt4f,SergeantIndie,2,Wed May 20 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"The use of time as a mechanic in Super Time Force is on it's surface a simple idea. ""What if you can rewind the action and start over?"" And this one idea totally snowballs into numerous scenarios and mechanics."
IndieDev,36kt4f,hrcnfloyd,2,Wed May 20 12:00:20 2015 UTC,"I wasn't particularly fond of Super Time Force.  In fact when discussing games I have used it as a counterpoint to Spelunky.  Spelunky is a lot of very simple mechanics that come together into something deep and, I think, Super Time Force is a very complicated mechanic that somehow comes off a bit shallow.  You're essentially playing co-op with yourself, which as a concept is neat, I just felt that it didn't do anything particularly exciting with it.  Of course my opinion might be pretty heavily influenced by the slew of little time or death manipulation games that came out on flash game sites like Kongregate since Braid."
IndieDev,36kt4f,SergeantIndie,2,Wed May 20 19:59:17 2015 UTC,All of them really.   I generally look at roguelikes more than others as I like making procedural games. They also have a lot of great ideas on how to keep games fresh.

IndieDev,36gxp7,castlerocktronics,7,Tue May 19 11:45:57 2015 UTC,I think you might want to consider the nose and neck of the first one. Having that unbroken line all the way down the middle looks like a bad render rather than something intentional (imo)

IndieDev,36gxp7,crazystich519,2,Tue May 19 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"What if you made the center faces in 2. narrower? so it'd be more of a compromise between the two? 1. does look more feminine, but the lighting is a bit odd due to the split straight down the middle.

IndieDev,366tao,madmarcel,2,Mon May 18 23:12:58 2015 UTC,"roughly 15. in highschool i took a programming class. and i didn't do well, in part due to teachers explaining things poorly extremely early on. my parents didn't like that i was doing so poorly at the class, so we bought a computer (the home computer was one used for tax purposes mostly) and a copy of vb.net and after an absurd amount of effort, i was able to get stuff working.  the first class finished okay, the next year i took another VB.net and a C++. i got the VB.net code which had taken me thousands of lines of code down to a 10 lines through having a loop and not having to clear ram- i don't even remember how i did it, but it was bad. i half remember not being able to figure out how much ram was in the computer so i filled all ram not used meaningfully to be unwritable, to force the writing to stay ""looping"" over the stuff it was aware of. though in the original there were thousands of lines of code, there were no loops.  the C++ class was a mirror of the VB so it wasn't good. but the experiance was better. the language itself was nice enough, you couldn't draw GUI or create object oriented events by doing the action on the GUI designer which you wanted as the trigger, but the actual code made much more sense. C++ leads to less 'wrongthink' of how the code works.  right now, i'm liking C a bit. and i might use it for the baseline for future projects. i'm also fairly excited for jai. i might contribute some backend code to it for networking protocol. if the langauge can be made to work both server/client and p2p without external libraries, it could be pretty great.  ...  for game development i started around age 6. i reworked nearly every game i came into contact with. one of the fun ones to rework was Chess. the basic mechanic i added was the capacity for friendly units to stack which changed their properties. if you feel in a rut that might be a fun way to try something new. i also started designing boardgames at that age.  ... btw congrats on releasing a few games."

IndieDev,366tao,Kongsias,1 point,Sat May 16 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"This will be pretty long, but I feel like sharing my experiences through learning programming and eventually becoming a software developer, and what I noticed along the way. I would have been really happy if someone had taken the time to share their experiences with me when I was around the same age, and I probably would have been less surprised along the way.  I started when I was 15 or 16 in a high school programming class. There was only me and one other student, so we got lumped into a general computing class where the teacher gave us different assignments from the rest of the class. We completed the assignments for the entire course in about 3 days (the course design was poor) and then were allowed to do our own things.   From there, it took me about one week to follow enough tutorials that I could make a Duck Hunt clone in Java. Obviously it was just a single file, but it worked, and I put it on the shared drive which all kids at the elementary school could access, and also showed people how to run it. It became popular enough that the teacher would remove it (people were playing it instead of doing classwork), but someone always had a copy stored in their personal storage, and they would continuously copy it back to the shared drive, in somewhat of a cat and mouse deal where the teacher was never able to eliminate all copies of it.  From there, I took a 2 year engineering transfer program at the local college, and I found that I enjoyed the programming courses there but they were much too easy. I aced those classes and asked the teacher for extra material, who provided me with two C++ books that I studied deeply. I remember thinking that ""man, I know C++ now, this is so cool, this is what it must feel like to be a top tier programmer"" -- oh, how wrong I was; you can catch 95% of programmers who are liars by simply looking at the ones who say they ""know C++"".  In this time I had made a couple more games using SDL/SFML and was really getting into programming. When I completed all my courses that transfer, I decided to enroll in software engineering program at the university I wanted to go to. This was a pretty big one because I initially wanted to go into civil engineering, although ultimately decided on software and am very glad that I did.  I placed into mid-second-year and my schedule had half second-year courses and half third-year due to transfer credits. Given my background with tinkering with programming so much, I was a bit disappointed in the the courses. Some of them were useful and brought new concepts, like assembly language and low level architecture, as well as the shared electrical engineering courses that were part of the software program, but most of the computer science / software programs I took were initially disappointing. I saw a lot of students here who were barely passing and having so much trouble with what I thought were basic concepts. This is where I first realized just how many people in computer science and software eng were the kind who enrolled in the degree with no previous knowledge of programming or computers, and only did the bare minimum amount of work, often struggling to get their assignments in at the last second.  Eventually, I worked my way through the years, continuing to program on my own projects and learn new languages like C# and Lua in my free time, even though they were not part of the curriculum. The classes got more difficult, and while there were always some notorious ones like operating systems, compiler construction, cryptography, real-time systems, security engineering (this one was the best, it was essentially a course on how to penetrate systems -- they'd give you a VM and say ""ok, get root""), overall the classes were nothing too difficult.  The real programming knowledge I obtained was through co-ops, though. Luckily, the program I was in had 16 months of mandatory co-op; you don't get your degree unless you have the experience done. The co-ops were paid positions (although employers like to lowball the co-op students -- I think it still works out) and the way it worked was the university would find employers that take on co-ops, and then you go apply to them and go through the interview process just like any other developer applying for the job. The bonus here is that I feel co-ops have a much easier time getting hired because the employers are specifically looking for ""green"" developers with potential that they can train from the ground up (and hopefully hire later after graduation). Typical jobs people got were RIM, IBM, local software development companies, and a handful of people got hired at Microsoft, Tesla, Google, and EA as well.  I remember going into my first co-op, being a pretty big ""keener"" for programming, thinking I knew so much, and then being completely and absolutely blown away by how working on a team of developers works in real life. I realized that these guys knew so much more than me that it was insane. This whole time I had been learning how to solve problems in certain programming languages -- how to do things in C++, how to do things in C#, etc -- but had never realized until then the concept of patterns: how to solve GENERAL problems, which can be used in any language. I was lucky that my first co-op was at an excellent place following fairly modern practices, and they got me up to speed on things like software architecture, MVC, MVVM, dependency injection, modules and dependency hierarchy, separation of concerns, all these things that industry developers use every day but students hardly even see because all they are doing is working on assignments to make tiny little projects. My following co-op experiences were great as well, and I was able to write C++ for HVAC/lighting control systems at a corporation, build geographic information systems with C#, and even do more laid-back environments with modern javascript development and a very indie/hipster environment.  After programming all that time on my own, it still took working with a real team of developers to hammer it all in. After doing a couple co-ops, going back to studies was so much different. The people just doing the minimum on assignments to ""get by"" and who aren't in programs that have mandatory co-ops? They became the bane of my existence. Get one of them in a project group and you might as well be teaching someone how to program from scratch because their experience was so lacking from only having the in-class education. This isn't a jab at them so much as it's a jab at how universities structure this stuff. There is no way that they can have the knowledge of how to work on a team when all their team assignments thus far have consisted of doing a project that takes maybe 4 weeks to make and has no architecture and is graded in a way that as long as it compiles and demonstrates the concepts learned in class, you pass. I was extremely disappointed to realize that in reality, university is something where a large amount of people can go through it, graduate, and still have almost no idea what they are doing.  I'll wrap this up since it's already pretty long. The big take away I got from university and just progressing in general was that you have to actually want to learn. You can coast through on your own and pass everything, graduate, and still be unemployable; I know many people that have done this. I absolutely would recommend that you jump on any opportunity to get real experience working on a team because you will most likely find it the most valuable way to improve. Even if you aren't looking for employment, and you just want to program as a hobby, finding an open source project and learning by example from real developers, and learning their workflows, would bring immensely valuable skills."

IndieDev,363gbf,danyblue,1 point,Fri May 15 19:55:31 2015 UTC,"I played too many games. I just can't reach the flow anymore by gaming. As a game dev, the only real fun I have from gaming comes from discovering the game. Discovering is a unsteady, not really a clear goal to set. Its rather a game of luck to find something interesting and just not flowy.  In programming, the last time I had a flow was back when I coded C++ . Or more precisely: wrote regular lines in C++, which I see by today as the mass amount of boilerplate. Since I code Haskell, which is just extremely efficient, I only hang on the difficult problems, because everything else is done in no time. Only graphics design without a strong goal brings me into the flow from time to time. However, strong goals appeared more often lately.   Also note that the title is a lie.    At first, a flow from gaming is not the best state. It is one state and it is continuous. Which is nice, when you want to make them happy by a long play. However, there are short, just a lot more awesome moments, which can totally overtake the flow.  Second. While all research fields try to make discrete, what is continuous, for simplification, you just can't reach the optimum with this methods. You can get a pretty good solution relatively quickly (because its simpler) but you can't get the optimum.  The only method to get the perfect game, from as much data as possible, with best possible measure, is to heuristically test all possibilities.    TL;DR: Flow in gaming is nice, but not awesome and can be bad in work. Don't use the word perfect lightly."

EDIT: Perhaps xdg-open could be useful instead of hardcoding the browser command. Of course, one could always modify the scripts, but that would negate having an assistant in the first place, I think.  Having an executable bash file with the extension "".exe"" is a little confusing, but I'm not sure if that's something that mediafire did or not. And the readme should probably be in the root directory of your archive.  I think a good next step would be to add something that reduces a long task into a few clicks.

That is, if time is a resource (like in age of empires or starcraft) it's fine to have  units move slowly across a screen because that's part of the strategy of how to position and move them, but in turn based games slow animations can get really annoying. Annoying to the point that not only will your players opt to turn them off, but they will even want to mod the game to speed them up (seen in pokemon or civ v).  A good example is advance wars. Your units move super fast to their location once you select where they should go. It's easy to turn off battle animations, but even when you leave them on they are still quick.   Basically, flashy animations are fun for a bit, but in strategy games and turn-based games in general they get tiresome fast if they take too long."

Written communication, in the form of a cover letter and resume, is going to be the first thing any potential employer sees about you.  Not to mention the fact that, if you're going to make games, you need to be able to communicate effectively with your teammates, and to convey information to your players.  Second up: I'm going to assume you have very little programming experience, based off the way you talk about these things.  Rather than telling you to go learn some particular language, I'm going to suggest that you get a copy of GameMaker Studio and go through the built-in tutorials.  It will give you at least some idea of what goes into making a game, and provide you with a platform with which you can experiment.  Third: Riot isn't likely to hire you.  There is a lot of competition for any game jobs, especially entry level, especially at high-profile studios.  For the sake of reference, I have a degree in this stuff and job hunting is still hard.  If you want to do gamedev professionally, you're going to need to demonstrate your skills by working on projects that distinguish you from the pack.  Build a portfolio, perhaps with your religion game, and then start applying to places.  Lastly: I'm not sure what we're supposed to get out of that video.

IndieDev,35h4q7,danyblue,3,Sun May 10 08:28:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly some of this advice is pretty bad. The links and information is useful, but most professional artists would disagree with the stuff at the end regarding color creation. That last image, with the rainbow of color ramps, for example, is actually an example of what NOT to do when creating a color palette.  Instead, it's better to use techniques like hue-shifting, and find colors that can be re-used within multiple ramps in order to create a sense of thematic consistency.  I don't want to go into too much detail in this post, because a LOT has been written on this topic, so here are some links that will illustrate what I mean:  http://androidarts.com/art_tut.htm http://www.pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=11299&PID=139392#139392 http://opengameart.org/content/chapter-5-color-palettes http://finalbossblues.com/using-and-choosing-colors/ http://files.byondhome.com/TheMonkeyDidIt/shading1.html#hue shift https://www.pinterest.com/pin/557813103817284630/"

The game itself is way bigger than this, the symbolism in it will be deep and epic, for example movies like Lords of the Rings and Chronicles of Narnia, which have a deep meaning behind every creature or encounter (Aslan as a God, represented by the Lion of Judah)  It is to specify that we are all christians and believers, so the Bible is and will be a key source for the game's lore"

IndieDev,35b636,Vektorweg,1 point,Sat May 9 10:45:57 2015 UTC,"It depends on the game, but in my case I would need tons of training data, and it will be hard to fix issues in the logic. But i am not even sure what param to feed it. Positions of all ships, positions of parts on all the ships, positions of all command points, amount of money, game time? That's a ton of data, training will take for ever."
IndieDev,35b636,ToplessTopmodel,1 point,Sat May 9 15:43:07 2015 UTC,"You start with small examples for training. Most basic ships, simple positioning, few ships count, small arena. You can randomly generate all the training data. Let the AI feed in ship controls and tell the AI if he won. Thats all. And when it understands the minimal game, it is much easier to advance to big ships and big fights without spending too much time in training. You can even add more sophisticated victory conditions than a simple battle. Still, it might take a lot time to setup this up and rewrite the game (if it isn't pure enough).  At least, thats what I think how it works, from what I know. I had no chance yet to write such AI. Its also said that machine learning algorithms / neural networks are slow, but there definitely are sufficient solutions. For now I want to point out that the game Creatures from 1996 had kind of realistic real-time AI using a simplified neural network, which was good enough for a game. I guess we can do this even better today.  However, its a matter of time. One rule for sure: A month of computation is cheaper than a hour of programming."

IndieDev,357r3h,pi3butcher,2,Thu May 7 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"I think generally with an indie team the composer is more inclined to either be payed x/minute, or in some cases even just a flat fee. But in bigger budget AAA productions it's equally likely the composer will get a large flat fee or a percentage of the return. If they charged per minute it wouldn't really equate well, think of games like Call of Duty that loop and the same 2 minute theme over and over in areas like menus or action scenes, it wouldn't fare well with the composers wallet haha. Also I can't really help with what kind of percentage that share may be sorry, but ofcourse it would depend on the project, which I'm sure you know. Hope I've helped a little."
IndieDev,357r3h,Got2ReturnVideoTapes,1 point,Thu May 7 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely helped a lot, but what sort of average range (aka the ""x"" in ""x/minute"") could I expect? And for the flat fee? Like I said for sounds, $15-$30 sfx. Is that normal? And does that include a royalty? Or would I do royalty and no (or less) money per sfx? Also, thanks for reply!"
IndieDev,357r3h,Got2ReturnVideoTapes,1 point,Tue May 12 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"No problem!     Personally i'm a composer/sound designer myself, so I couldn't really tell you the types of costs people give me because i'm not a game developer.     With that said, for me personally: my rates would usually be $12 per minute of music (with satisfaction guarantee).     Flat fee would depend on a few factors;       How much music would be required (5 themes or 10 levels or just a main menu or....) The type of music it is (think 2 minutes of full orchestral music is a lot more work than 5 minutes of retro 8bit music.) The budget of the project itself, it would be unrealistic to ask a basement developer to provide the same amount for a game with a budget of $10,000 don't you think?   As for royalties, I'd probably stay away from them if you're in the ""indie development"" scene for the moment. They could definitely be problematic, and the size of the royalty would depend on the crew size and expected sales of the game.  So for example if the production is made up of 5 people including the sound designer, i think 10% royalty would be fair with a smaller flat fee. Without a flat fee i would say 20% royalty would be also fair.      Sound FX is a difficult one. It really all depends, would you rather charge a flat fee for a package of sound effects or per sound effect. I think for a low budget/no budget indie game I really wouldn't be asking for much for each sound effect personally. I'd go as low as $3 per sound effect, and if the game required 50 individual sound effects I would offer to do it for a flat fee of $100. Again, this is me. People are different and will ask for different things so don't expect this to always be the case. If someone was only doing sound effects for your game i wouldn't be offering a royalty, I would work with a flat fee ideally.   But remember nothing is wrong or right, as long as you can justify it. If you feel the music doesn't play as big a factor in your game make sure you let your composer know in advance, and pay him accordingly. If it is a huge factor in your game then make sure you mention that, and don't be afraid to pay them for their contribution, you may be gaining a really respectable partner for the future.    Let me know if you have any more questions, and i'm always available to message if you are looking for more help! Cheers"

IndieDev,34vvra,WriterOfAlicrow,2,Tue May 5 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"When you say ""subversion"" do you mean specifically svn or any version control? Version control is a must--I even use it for personal projects by myself, and personally I prefer git, but I've also used mercurial (hg, very similar to git in a lot of respects) and subversion at work.  Every version control system has its pluses and minuses, but as far as I've used them, there are two main categories: centralized (e.g., svn and its predecessor cvs) and distributed (e.g., git and hg). With a centralized system like svn, there is one repository--one source of truth--and every commit and update (I believe that's the terminology--I haven't used it in a couple of years) is a network action. With a distributed system like git, every copy of the code is its own equal and full repo, although a lot of group projects treat the version on a server as the de-facto source of truth."

Just curious, how much of a focus is there on trading and building an economy? Is this something that's in the plans, or will city growth be based on something else entirely?"
IndieDev,34sy63,notafryingpan_games,1 point,Mon May 4 13:28:10 2015 UTC,"Hi buddy, thanks for checking out the vid. There's an emphasis on building up the village to becoming a really busy town but honestly you can play the game how you like. There will be set environments around the world like a forest, mountain pass (both briefly featured in the video), a marshland, huge cave, tropical island (accessible later on in the game when your town gets a harbour). The new areas are unlocked by defeating the 'area' boss and using the item it drops to open the new area. So to put a brief spoiler, you defeat the enemy in the forest and a villager will then clear the northern part of town finding an opening to a mountain pass to explore. The game doesn't revolve around you 'having' to grow the town as you can progress and unlock many things without it. The idea we're going for is when you go out into the world and explore, you'll always come back with something that will improve your game, you'll see the changes, whether that be levelling up a specific villager, the town developing as a whole, new area opening up, your character levelling up, a new quest happening/unlocking, a new mini game available. We want the world to be as dynamic as possible. Ask any questions, I'll do my best to answer them for you. Feedback on our part is great too and suggestions!  Jonathan Creative Director"

IndieDev,34p6k9,CooBlu,7,Sun May 3 07:23:51 2015 UTC,"Looking at ludum dare and other gamejams with tight time constraints: it has already been possible to quickly create games in the past.  Of course unity & co bring a greater variety of game types, because they provide engine features that are impossible to create in such short amounts of time.  It also depends on your view of what it means creating a game. What you left out in your process is   creating your own unique assets  having some kind of game mechanic having a goal, score or other motivation to play/explore   I think what you did, is more along the lines of playing around with engine features and premade assets:   Slapping existing grass textures on a plane Putting existing tree models onto it  Attaching a light to an pre configured first-person-controller.)   Of course that's fine, but it is a somewhat long way from that to an enjoyable game."
IndieDev,34p6k9,jppresents,3,Sun May 3 07:43:27 2015 UTC,Slender wasn't much more than that.   Well it might be not the type of game everyone likes. ;)
IndieDev,34p6k9,Vektorweg,3,Sun May 3 11:57:41 2015 UTC,"If I have learned anything about making games in the past, it's that progress quickly gets harder to make when you layer in more features. I really want to take what I have now and actually give it depth and a non-Slender vibe, but that requires actual thinking (which I totally did not do when slapping Unity's assets together, you were spot-on when you said I was ""playing around with engine features and premade assets""). It's all part of the process though, and I look forward to giving the game something unique to keep gameplay engaging.  Man, this is my favorite kind of work. :D"
IndieDev,34p6k9,Vektorweg,3,Sun May 3 16:29:29 2015 UTC,What I often see in humble game dev: the path is the goal. It is more about discovery than to actually produce something.
IndieDev,34p6k9,TheForeverLoneWolf,2,Sun May 3 07:45:51 2015 UTC,"I agree completely; too often are actual games thrown together. My project's goal was to see how quick I could put something together in Unity without having touched the engine in a year, and well... I was surprised how easy it was. However, I understand that it resembles a game, but doesn't play like one. It was a small learning exercise that I wanted to share and create a discussion with. :)"
IndieDev,34p6k9,TheForeverLoneWolf,3,Sun May 3 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the game.  I make Visual Novels. For free. Sure, Ren'py has done a lot for us, but the art, music, coding and writing hasn't gotten much easier.   Also, perspective:  Look at what was considered a great game in the past compared to now. Mario is not nearly as intensive as even the indie-est of indie games.  I'd say that the biggest asset, for my team at least, is method of communication - TeamSpeak. Without it, we would have failed long ago. It allows for multinational devs to come together (and we are multinational, with people outside of just America and Europe) and create something great.  Just imagine, how in the fuck would you manage a team of 40 over text chat alone? Or, god forbid, snail mail?  Yeah, I think communication is our biggest asset."
IndieDev,34p6k9,Vektorweg,2,Mon May 4 14:44:30 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, don't get me started on team communication. That stuff will either help streamline the entire production process or destroy whole projects fast. I would put out a good word for Skype because you can both text and call groups of people, but Skype has just been going downhill - I can't even load a group conversation without the program stalling for at least a minute. I would much rather be using a damn IRC client at this point."
IndieDev,34p6k9,jppresents,3,Tue May 5 05:27:55 2015 UTC,"Skype is a resource hog and terrible at best. Teamspeak allows for text and voice chat simultaneously, while also holding more moderation abilities than any other type of communication of its kind.  Communication is our biggest problem, but would be worse if we were to not be able to communicate at all. Our Teamspeak server crashes on average once a year, and the average downtime is less than ten minutes.  I don't trust skype in the same manner.  IRC? We tried that, but TS replaces it in every manner. IRC is great for speaking to the fans - requires no install."
IndieDev,34p6k9,Vektorweg,2,Tue May 5 05:53:38 2015 UTC,"When starting from scratch / near-bare-metal, the only option for 3D games is OpenGL. Which is likely the worst API ever invented. Its practically impossible to get something nice done, without a good framework that already handle the worst. IMHO OpenGL is the most annoying topic of game dev."

IndieDev,34j1qz,Rotorist,1 point,Fri May 1 16:37:53 2015 UTC,Unpaid or rev share teams can be very hard to manage because everyone feels entitled about having their own idea implemented. This is the primary reason why my attempt to collaborate with artist failed.
IndieDev,34fs6i,Rotorist,3,Thu Apr 30 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"There is a fairly well known indie title by the name of Zineth that handles 3D cityscapes without (much) texturing that I would suggest maybe taking a look at: Screenshot  What I would maybe try applying to your game in regards to this is more variation in color. Your environment is currently very drab with lots of greys, tans, and neutrals that are not particularly eye catching and cause the city to all melt into one mass. I don't think you need to go full-on acid trip like the visuals in Zineth but some variation in color would probably be a good idea.  I might also point you in the direction of De Blob. De Blob lets the player apply random textures to the buildings that look snazzy, but aren't trying to be representative of what a building actually looks like, so that might be something worth considering as well."
IndieDev,34fs6i,pixel_illustrator,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:03:57 2015 UTC,"I see! Zineth's graphics is kinda like the 1980's cartoon, simple solid colors with little to no shading.  I get what you mean, though there's a reason I keep the color neutral, because there are certain important buildings that will be a solid orange color to stand out, and player must protect these buildings. If I use too many warmer colors then those important buildings won't stand out as much. But I think I can make buildings that have multiple colors in the same model, so when you get close the building doesn't just look like a blob. Thanks!"
IndieDev,34fs6i,pixel_illustrator,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:10:50 2015 UTC,"You can definitely have variation in color and still use color to differentiate importance! For instance if your important buildings are orange, then have the rest of the city focus on cool colors, like blues or purples, or make the ""important"" color stand out even more (like a red...which is overused but effective) and allow yourself to use a broader pallete (Mirrors Edge effectively uses red inside a cooler pallete for instance to point things of importance).  I would just heavily advise against greys. In color theory, nothing kills a piece of art faster than an over reliance on blacks, whites, and greys. You can mute colors of course, but straight greys are going to be pretty hard to work with."
IndieDev,34fs6i,puedes,2,Thu Apr 30 20:17:23 2015 UTC,I immediately thought of Mirror's Edge when I started reading your comment. Goes to show how well it was executed.
IndieDev,34fs6i,pixel_illustrator,2,Fri May 1 05:01:05 2015 UTC,"Man, I've been experimenting all night with different colors, and they all look like crap... The only one I personally am comfortable is one like this:  http://i.imgur.com/aGdJGPy.png  But it's a dull single color scheme (with orange special buildings)"
IndieDev,34fs6i,pixel_illustrator,2,Fri May 1 15:41:06 2015 UTC,"I do think that looks a helluva lot better than what it did in your original video. It looks like you've gone and cooled down the color of the buildings, that slight blue tinge is far better than the stark grey you had for sure.  I would try adding some additional colors in the details of the city (roads, building edges, traffic lights, etc) to make it pop a little more if you can, but what you have there at least looks a lot better than what you used to have!"
IndieDev,34fs6i,TheForeverLoneWolf,1 point,Fri May 1 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This city model is still just a mock up. I love the BF4 shanghai downtown map which is much like what I'm trying to mimick in terms of helicopter gameplay. Eventually I will build a large scale of that map with low poly buildings, tunnels, streets (just a texture over the ground), and some accent objects to kind of reflect the size of the city (maybe low poly trees, bridges etc.)"
IndieDev,34fs6i,TheForeverLoneWolf,2,Fri May 1 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah the introduction of smaller elements will definitely help with the sense of scale, having small objects to compare the large buildings too will give you that size you want, and if you use those elements as a way to jazz up your color pallete as well I think you would be looking a very nice environment!"
IndieDev,34fs6i,TheForeverLoneWolf,1 point,Fri May 1 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"The challenge is that if I make small accent elements, it's easy to unbalance the detail level. Since the buildings are low detail, having some small objects such as traffic signs, trees and such makes player think hmm, there's a lot of details here but why are the buildings not detailed? Are they not finished and rushed out? uh oh.  I think I'll definitely have some trees if I can find a good way to stylize them. Also I believe raised highways are my savior - I'll just make them float in midair across the city, they'll have a grayish color (sorry I know gray is bad lol but I can't imagine green or purple highways..) to break the ""blue hell""."
IndieDev,34fs6i,TheForeverLoneWolf,1 point,Fri May 1 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"I like it! It looks very clean. Consider me interested!  I'm unsure as to how this game will be played, and I don't know the mechanics, but will you need to attack a building as well? You can use dark cool colors in contrast with the orange. Perhaps a purple. Or, as said above, red is overused, but that's because it works!"
IndieDev,34fs6i,benjymous,1 point,Fri May 1 16:56:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  So the game mechanic goes that there are some special buildings that are factories or say radars, they will serve some purpose in the game. Factories will produce commodities (in a supply/consume chain) that eventually allow player to enhance/repair the defense system for the city, so these buildings are very important for players to protect against enemies. I picked orange simply because I wanted to go for a blue-orange color palette, and my HUD will also use orange, check this out:  http://i.imgur.com/5qDT4LR.jpg  Of course the sky is now cloudless (maybe I'll have an orange sky for sunset environment), and buildings are blue.. but I'm trying to achieve this blue-orange theme lol  Blue-red may also look good, but I really don't want people to say that I'm copying from mirror's edge lol"
IndieDev,34fs6i,benjymous,1 point,Fri May 1 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"You have a fair point there.  The hud looks like it will turn out nice.

You really have to concentrate your mind and aim just right to hit them. When I was taking the video I was camera shy (even though I'm not in the camera but I still feel nervous) and couldn't concentrate so I got badly owned.

IndieDev,347nnb,superbob7,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"I think you have a memory leak somewhere, it caused me to crash a few times.(I don't have the best computer ever so it probably isn't that bad) Also a few more options for the graphical options wouldn't hurt and if you plan to continue to make it controller only I would add support for more controllers(4 out of 6 of my controllers didn't want to work on it). Other than that not a bad game, just a few small bugs and some repetitive game play mechanics. I would give it a 6.5 out of 10, but that could be improved."
IndieDev,347nnb,superbob7,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:23:29 2015 UTC,"Mind telling me the names for those controllers? But I am planning to make it so you configure your controls on the player select screen, like press the buttons in an order to set them, and I am planning for more than just controllers but that's just how it is at the moment. And general game play is planned for improvement too. I guess this could be called a tech demo?"
IndieDev,347nnb,Enemby,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:59:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry most of the names are just serialized... most of them are from radio shack though... if that helps. My x-box controller worked and my newest radio shack controller worked, but that's it. Also for a tech demo a 6.5 is great... keep it up and polish your work and you'll have a fine game."

IndieDev,346a33,Arowx,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"The Dare is always tough for any studio (especially inexperienced, not-for-profit ones) but once it is over, you get a great high.   If your game doesn't do so well, fret not! All experience is good experience.  There are many other jams out there, including the one that my studio recently participated in: NaNoRenO. (Which is a Visual Novel Jam)  We completed our game Palinurus.  Trust me when I say this: It takes two parts skill, one part luck to get noticed out there. A good grasp on PR is also a good boost."
IndieDev,345uxk,BruReale,4,Tue Apr 28 15:24:11 2015 UTC,"Twitter is a must. Post pretty screenshots to the #gamedev, #indiedev, and #screenshotsaturday hashtags as often as you can. Follow people who you genuinely find interesting, and try to engage with potential fans.  Tumblr, Facebook, and Instagram are all good. I wouldn't advise you to use all three, because monitoring too many social media accounts at once will sap up your time. Just choose whichever you're comfortable with, and try to update it regularly.  Development forums like TIGSource are good for feedback and discussion, but not so good if you're looking for sheer exposure.  You can of course try strutting your game out on /r/gaming, /r/games, /r/indiegames, or a gaming forum like Neogaf, but you probably want to reserve that until you have something major to show off (e.g. an awesome new trailer). If you take this route, just be upfront; nobody likes underhanded viral marketing."
IndieDev,345uxk,SketchyLogic,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:17:50 2015 UTC,nobody likes underhanded viral marketing   What about a well-constructed ARG?
IndieDev,345uxk,dddbbb,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"There is the interesting problem of media saturation.  It's discussed by a 'succesful' indie developer 'cliffski' here -> http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/feed/  In a nutshell global media has collapsed down to a few very popular outlets e.g. steam, itunes app store, youtube, twitter, facebook.  And occasionally games or media manage to generate enough of a ripple virally to massively boost then maintain their top position in those medias charts. e.g. Angry Birds, Flappy Bird, Minecraft, Gangam Style video."
IndieDev,345uxk,Arowx,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"My first warning would be to be careful about the hype train: You can't start it too early. It is one thing to start a hype train, but to keep it running? That can be a nightmare, exponentially becoming more hellish as time increases.  I'd also recommend following trends, but this is much harder to do with indie games, especially home grown ones.  Also, are you planning to release other games in the future? If you are going to embark on a long term project, it would be nice to have regular content put out to your fans. Even if you don't have many fans, new ones will greatly appreciate having content to look at: past, present, and future"
IndieDev,345ec6,scarcityonline,2,Tue Apr 28 13:08:34 2015 UTC,All comments welcome. It is still pretty early but the game has some of its major concepts in place. Added AI yesterday which makes it starting to look playable :)

IndieDev,344g95,Sergeantblood,1 point,Tue Apr 28 05:39:10 2015 UTC,In the pipeline tool click edit > add item and select your file. Once you have done that and built your assets you will need to put the .xnb files somewhere like a content folder in the build path.  From there just add the folder contents to the IDE and only copy assets if they are newer and everything should be all good.
IndieDev,344g95,joffuk,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:02:13 2015 UTC,Monogame doesn't support the file format. I have tried using a custom content processor such as XTiled but i couldn't get it to work.
IndieDev,344g95,joffuk,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:08:40 2015 UTC,Do you get any errors at all?
IndieDev,344g95,hexdie,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:15:49 2015 UTC,Tiled can export to multiple formats. Are any of those other formats supported by Monogame?

IndieDev,3431nd,PhantasmalGame,2,Mon Apr 27 22:29:24 2015 UTC,"r/indiegaming is pretty open to self-promotion, as long as you follow the subreddit rules and label your post as ""SP""."
IndieDev,3431nd,Brak15,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:18:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion! Sounds good.
IndieDev,3431nd,llehsadam,2,Tue Apr 28 06:57:39 2015 UTC,"Just use extreme caution there when posting and make sure you understand the rules. Your account is technically too new to post there.  And keep in mind that most users there are themselves actually developers. The skewed dev to gamer ratio has always been a problem there even before the crazy new rules were put in place.  I'd suggest /r/indiegames because the moderators there are much more friendly and you don't run the risk of getting shadow-banned.  But really, you shouldn't be asking where to post. The trick is how you post. I've seen developers get embraced by the reddit community before (check /r/AirBrawl). You have to approach reddit honestly and with content that will benefit redditors. It is no secret that the most popular indie dev posts on reddit are beautiful images and eye-catching gifs. If you approach reddit like that, not primarely concerned about your game doing well, but about offering people something fun, you'll get embraced and end up on the front page like this.  Get to know the community and give them what they want. Selling an idea has nothing to do with what you want and everything to do with what your audience wants."
IndieDev,3431nd,joffuk,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:37:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the suggestions,llehsadam! Will definitely follow them. Yeah,I've noticed people on /r/indiegames always seem to be pretty open-minded and happy to discuss new projects."
IndieDev,3431nd,joffuk,2,Thu Apr 30 06:48:15 2015 UTC,I have a question for you...  Why did you put an embargo on your own trailer? Would you not want to advertise before release?  Game looks great as well can't wait to get my hands on it
IndieDev,340npv,giftgaming,2,Mon Apr 27 11:09:17 2015 UTC,"Hi Nick got a question for you :)  With something like AdMob you get a payment based on clicks and impressions, how does GiftGaming handle this?  From what I can tell it is based on users buying something have I missed something / not read enough?  I am very interested in using this as a decent alternative though and might have to write some plugins for what I use to make it easier for others"
IndieDev,340npv,joffuk,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"Hi joffuk,  Thanks for your kind words :)  To answer your questions: we share the commission we receive on coupon redemptions. Our Revenue Model page explains how it works. So basically, if someone spends money with a coupon/offer, we get paid a commission (anywhere between 3% to as high as 15%) from the brand, which we then share with the game developer (we always aim to give developers the majority share!).  I do apologise if it wasn't immediately clear!  In terms of plugins, we support Unity, Marmalade, HTML5, Android (and very soon, Flash/AS3), available from our plugins page.  Are you thinking giftgaming could work for your game(s)?  Kind regards,  Nick"
IndieDev,340npv,joffuk,2,Mon Apr 27 18:45:35 2015 UTC,"Perfect thanks for the info :)  I am going to give it a try and see how it goes, I started on a concept over the weekend so I will take a proper look at it tomorrow when I get on the computer and start working on a Haxe version to test it out."

Again, sorry to everyone for not coming through on this one. If you want me to upload my single-level game that is super easy to finish, I totally can though."
IndieDev,33x1lo,boateye99,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:03:31 2015 UTC,Please do release it.  The idea of the mix tape is a bunch of games and the quality or quantity should not be an issue.  You can always improve it and extend it.
IndieDev,33x1lo,Arowx,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:28:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the encouragement! It can be downloaded here. I certainly do want to expand on it from where I have it right now. The 2D lighting in Godot's beta is fun to play around with.

IndieDev,339l59,pinkunicorns69,1 point,Tue Apr 21 07:22:10 2015 UTC,"Twitter hashtags make up for this. When you can cultivate a hashtag to get this filtered information, you wouldn't need a extra platform in the first place.   You can also hope that someone else on Twitter is already filtering new games. You just need to find this someone. ;)  How about #gameannounce to start with?"
IndieDev,339l59,pinkunicorns69,2,Mon Apr 20 20:35:29 2015 UTC,"You are correct and I am looking for that someone :)  In terms of hashtags, the main I see are #gamedev and #indiedev. However, the bots just retweet it so much that even though they want to help out, it is actually doing the reverse.  Maybe what it needs is community aspect like in Reddit, so can upvote? Or maybe limit who can post, initially?  I looked at #gameannounce and most of the tweets are from 2010 on Twitter."
IndieDev,339l59,pinkunicorns69,2,Mon Apr 20 22:38:19 2015 UTC,I mean #gameannounce is empty enough to start to fill it. But starting a new subreddit doesn't sound bad either.

IndieDev,337m4m,Arowx,2,Mon Apr 20 13:58:21 2015 UTC,I have my basic game engine done. I am now deciding to add AI or multiplayer. AI seems the safer option but I might attempt multiplayer first. (also the 27th is a monday?)
IndieDev,337m4m,DareTheDev,2,Tue Apr 21 10:28:35 2015 UTC,You are correct! Thanks for picking up on that.
IndieDev,337m4m,paetramon,2,Thu Apr 23 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"I've made a very basic prototype for my game. It's a stealth based conspiracy-revealing game where you sneak your way through a level to collect a document to uncover more and more of a government conspiracy. What that is yet, I don't know.   So Godot did a handy update and added 2D lighting and 2D navigation pathing, so that was really nice since those are pretty important for my games main stealth mechanic. The hardest thing I've had to do is be able to detect the play based on whether they are within the enemies/guards light. I settled on doing it with collision detecting raycasts, that won't go through walls which is nice. Then the next problem is that adding 120 raycasts to each one (I decided on 120 that go in a full circle to get accurate detection on the player) caused the game to slow down to a crawl framerate wise. That was fixed by just putting areas around to so that the guards would only need to be checked if the player is within that guards area.   So far it's going alright, though I don't know how much past this prototype stage I'm going to get by Monday."
IndieDev,337m4m,Moustache_Ryder,2,Wed Apr 22 02:02:51 2015 UTC,I'm doing a film-noir inspired detective one. It's top down 3d in UE4. Unfortunately I was visiting an area that got smashed by a cyclone over the last few days so my development has somewhat halted due to no power. I'm hoping to catch up on things in the next few days.  My primary focus has been to capture a 1940's aesthetic. Nothing says intrigue to me like that era.

IndieDev,337m4m,Arowx,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:53:05 2015 UTC,"Should we open up the mix tape to indie devs with finished games, then we can fill it out to 16 games?"
IndieDev,337m4m,llehsadam,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:22:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the main problem. Most of the participants here didn't respond. Filling it out with finished games will make the end result look better, but it would also downplay the whole educational/fun reason why we do this.  The second mix tape will be small, but I think that's fine as long as we learn something from it.  We should take more time preparing the next one. I didn't do any promotion for this one since I didn't have time and from the looks of this mix tape, it can't sustain itself... we need promotion. I'm also going to readjust the rules and guidelines to make that more clear."
IndieDev,337m4m,TotesMessenger,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:09:41 2015 UTC,"This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.   [/r/dogecoin] Hey! /r/IndieDev had another game jam. It's smaller but the games are as sweet as usual. Check it out!   If you follow any of the above links, respect the rules of reddit and don't vote. (Info / Contact)"
IndieDev,336zhq,FugueGame,3,Mon Apr 20 03:03:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a popular post removed for self promotion. I think it depends on the size of the community. Right now this sub is super small so it's not an issue. But for a bigger community it can be really spammy. I'm interested to see how moderation evolves as this sub grows."
IndieDev,336zhq,airmanf,2,Mon Apr 20 14:02:28 2015 UTC,"That was probably /r/indiegaming, not /r/indiejunction! :)  We'll keep the rules simple so that they are easy to keep track of. The moderators of most subreddits think they are important enough for people to remember their rules. I don't think you should have to read pages of text each time you forget if the post fits better in /r/indiegaming or /r/gamedev. I'd much rather have users not afraid to post anything so we'll keep the rules simple.   We'll have plenty of guidelines to help you circumnavigate reddit's grey waters of course, but no rules as bonkers as this wall of text which requires further explanation with this wall of text. It's not fun, it's crazy.  I noticed on other subreddits I moderate that if the moderators are liked by the community, plenty of subscribers start to help out by messaging the mods when they notice problems with the CSS (sometimes even including the fix in the message) or report spammy links. As long as the moderators stay interested, with such help, controlling spam becomes easier. That's what I'm aiming for here. A healthy self-regulating sub that can sustain good posts with active moderation to keep things rolling.   Moderators have to stay interested in the topic and promote community growth. I mean... look at /r/indiegaming. They may be good people with good intentions, but their announcement sticky is still shit after the last reddit text size changelog a few months back. In my book (which is full of other examples since I used to moderate that sub), all of them are poor mods for not doing anything about it.  I mean it's also about a balance between your expectations as a submitter and as a reader. We won't have rules about what people can post here, but obviously you have to respect the community. Post your own content but engage the community! It's all about give and take. I wrote more about that here.  I want this place to be fun, simple and indie and I'm going to do my best to keep it that way."
IndieDev,336zhq,airmanf,3,Mon Apr 20 15:38:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's really cool that there are people who want to moderate a community like this. And yeah, I didn't want to mention the subreddit, but I'm not too salty about it. From the way the rules are, it seems that /r/indiegaming is intended for the player more than the developer. So it makes sense that self promotion / game dev posts are frowned upon.  I'm certainly looking to be active in the sub as it grows. Just having a community of people to share your game with and talk about game dev seems perfect to me. Hopefully thats part of what you guys had in mind as well :)  EDIT: This may be suitable for a separate post, but what are the plans to differentiate this sub from bigger subs like /r/gamedev ? I think the mixtapes are a really good start."

IndieDev,334kq9,danyblue,5,Sun Apr 19 14:11:57 2015 UTC,"The market is saturated but that mainly means you just have to up your quality.   It's more the death of the easy indie dream. You can't get away with the level of quality that previous games have gotten away with.  These days I'm buying and playing far more indie games than ever. There has been plenty of recent Indie success on Platforms such as PC. The reason they were successful is because they had effort put into them, they were worth playing.   I think the main thing is people are focusing first and foremost on making money and letting it effect their products. I see a lot of post mortem posts that often have things like ""I quit my job, built a simple game in a month and it didn't sell! I built another and it didn't sell! Indie is dead!!!"" Most of what I'm seeing is people trying to put in as little effort as possible and hoping they have the next flappy bird. A lot of people aren't making games because they want to, but because they think they can make a quick buck. That side of Indie died a few years ago. If you want to make money now then it requires effort.   If you want to get noticed then build something good, something that will make people take notice. Not just match 3 game with micro transactions #10,000,000,000. Also it's probably best for people to stop focusing on the most saturated market of all, Mobile. People are also focusing marketing and PR too much. No amount of PR,marketing or advertising is going to fix a bad product. Make a good game first then worry about the rest. A good game will make the marketing part much easier.   I want to make money too, but mainly so I can develop full time. So I can make the games I have always wanted to play. Sure I could program a crappy mobile game a week, but I would rather spend time and build something I am proud of, something I would want to play."
IndieDev,334kq9,Kinths,2,Sun Apr 19 21:20:19 2015 UTC,"I see things similarly. Basically, indie is growing up. It's getting big and too many people see their personal failures as the failures of this new industry.  It means that to be successful, like with any business, you're going to have to have contacts and communication skills. It's probably a good time to start reading books like How to Win Friends and Influence People and any modern versions that focus on these kinds of interactions on the internet.  Watching something like Steb's Designer Mastermix on YouTube is a good start, I think."
IndieDev,334kq9,llehsadam,3,Mon Apr 20 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call this the ""elephant in the room,"" I've had this conversation quite a bit and I've been having it for a couple years now.  It's easy to watch Indie Game: The Movie and look at people like Tommy and Ed, Derek Yu, or John Blow and think ""Jesus, those guys made a game and they made millions of dollars.""  Those guys were in the right place at the right time with the right skills.  Before the XBOX Live marketplace gave indie developers a real opportunity to really get out there, those guys were already making games and being nobodies.  They made well put together games with their years of experience at a time when they were practically the only indie games.  Completely captive market.    Newsflash, that was not anything relating to a normal market. There have been good games since that have done well, but Meat Boy and Braid are definitely exceptions and they're practically household names because their position within their marketplace combined with the expertise of their creators allowed that to happen.  Then some guys put them in a documentary which gathered a shit ton more buzz and carried them through.  That isn't going to happen for you.  Period.  Being Indie isn't about that.  It isn't about stacks of cash and fame.  It is about doing what you love without 8 mangers breathing down your neck.  For some of us, it's about doing what we love when disability or obligations with family prevent us from taking normal game development jobs.  You are not going to make a few million dollars on a game.  Period.  Get over it.  If that is what you're looking for, some sort of get rich quick scheme, get out.  Now.  What you can do, is make games and support yourself.  You wont be Ed McMillen.  You wont be Tommy Refenes or Derek Yu.  You wont even be Raimi Ismail.  You can make games, enjoy yourself, and make a decent wage doing it.  Will you make more than you'd make working for EA or Naughty Dog?  Maybe not, but you'll be working for yourself and have the creative freedom you want.  Median income in the United States is 33,000 for a single person.  Your goals should be closer to that than they are to ""A zillion dollars and a solid gold Tesla.""  If you live outside America than the target gets a bit lower due to social safety nets and medical care.  If you want to make indie games and you thought you were going to be the next Meat Boy or Spelunky or, hell, even FTL, you need to get over it.  That's not going to happen.  You'll need a half dozen good games under your belt before you get anywhere near that amount of market attention and return.  If you want to make games and hope to make a living.  Do it.  Keep doing it.  Lower your expectations, minimize your lifestyle, and keep at it.  If you want to be the next ""Indie Superstar,"" give up.  It's not going to happen.  You're not going to make a few million dollars off a couple games easily and nobody gives a shit about watching you go on speaking tours so long as Raimi continues to be unable to go more than 2 minutes without getting on another airplane.  Is the Indie Dream dead?  No.  The Indie Delusion is dead, and has been for at least 2 years.  Probably closer to 3."
IndieDev,334kq9,SergeantIndie,3,Sun Apr 19 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"To reply to myself...  It's been dead longer than that, really.  Mortally wounded perhaps.  It keeps limping along because of little windows within the market.  FTL probaby wouldn't have been made at all without Kickstarter.  Even if it had been made, nobody would have heard about it or given a shit without Kickstarter.  Kickstarter opened a window for a few really great games and developers to become much larger than the sum of their own parts.  (Don't get me wrong, I love FTL, but the sheer amount of buzz their kickstarter garnered has been pretty much unmatched since).  I wouldn't consider the Kickstarter ""window"" to be completely closed, but it's cracked just enough for some fresh air to get in.  The sheer number of otherwise successful projects that have turned out to be complete failures, lies, or outright scams has thrown a shit ton of doubt behind the concept of Kickstarting indie games.  You can't expect to put up any old platformer and get 30k at the drop of a hat anymore.  Furthermore you probably shouldn't even approach Kickstarter without a solid plan and a solid game because a failed Kickstarter is seen within the community to b just about a death sentence in its own right.  I had a game (aborted unfortunately) that made international attention literally over night because of another window.  A boom in indie press.  The indie news market grew substantially and there wasn't really enough games to cover so they started resorting to dredging up local game development communities to talk about half-cocked devlogs.  Chris Priestman was one of those guys and we were one of those games.  Literally over night, less than 48 hours total on the Devlog itself, just about every indie rag took Priestman's article, cannibalized it, and reposted it.  If we could have finished, we would have had a real chance at a solid amount of money and a good name to ourselves.  Of course, half those indie sites have either closed or been eaten and a ridiculous influx of devlogs on these communities has flooded them out.  That window is also about closed.  If you can have a good product during one of these ""windows,"" you can still hit it really big out of nowhere.  What are these windows?  No fucking idea.  The two I've mentioned aren't all of them (hell, the opening of Greenlight was definitely another one), but I can't predict the future.  Hell, when we were picked up by those indie game journalists desperate for an article, I had no idea what was going to happen or what the result would be.  My point is that these little windows are going to keep opening and there's no way to 100% predict what they will be (I've got a strong hunch that Occulus Rift and other VR headsets will create a window, but who knows how big and for how long).  Make what you love, make enough money to pay your bills and stuff ramen down your gullet, and gather enough of a following that if a window opens you might be able to take advantage of it."

You might be able to find a programmer willing to work with you if you can demonstrate that you are a capable 3D artist and animator, but simply being an ""idea guy"" is not enough.  If you want to see your game brought to life, then your best option would be to teach yourself how to model, teach yourself how to program (there are a ton of tutorials on getting started with Unity), and do it yourself.

There are 2 adds activated right now, one is just medium rectangle in the div that doesn't do anything, and the other is just one layer add that sometimes show in the bottom-center or right side of the screen but it shouldn't force anyone to redirect anywhere and it's not a popup but maybe it's this one causing the problem."

ChatPion Thank You I will fix that, the theme collapsing etc. probably is caused by the ads, I created the style before I added the ads and now probably they caused the website elements to 'move'. Will try to make everything bigger and nicer ""for an eye"" :) Do You think I should try and change the colour from red on most of the texts to something else or red is ok? As for Cookie Clicker, it was my biggest inspiration and I am thinking if I should create some credits on my website and put them there :) With the achievments yes I agree, to be honest I kinda created it this way for testing and then I just left it like that, I will fix that too. The achievments are quite in development yet but they are basically just a nice addition to the game, also You will get some extra bonuses for unlocking the achievments like gold or exp, for attributes the main concept of them will be that they will have the impact on the game, You will need some lvl of particular attribute point to unlock some of the army man or buildings, and to start a mission, also probably will unlock some achievments. SnoutUp Thank You, will try to upgrade the UI and probably I will take the risk and post there too. ronconcoca I am trying to implement responsive theme with media queries, so far the website is developed for the resolution of mine (1366x768) and ipads, later on I will try to upgrade it for more resolutions too (also phones) :) As for delay sorry for that, that's probably the cause of the slow vps I am hosting it on.  htoov This is basically a very simple clicking based game, that on the start all You have to do is to click on the ""dollar"" image and You get gold for that, after some time You have enough gold to buy some army man (knights) or buildings (tavern), each of them do different things (You get info while You hover over the button) and then You unlock more buttons whenever You buy enough.  Do You think I should add some ""first time visit"" pop-up info with some short explanation of the website and what to do?   Thank You all for the responds, I appreciate that."
IndieDev,32pr11,SnoutUp,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:03:09 2015 UTC,"For the future - it's better to reply to everyone directly if you want to keep conversation going, since not everyone is checking the threads they participated in. I think also writing /u/h3xakill should send a notification to the user, but don't quote me on that.  My progress seems to be lost after I opened game today. I didn't manually saved yesterday, tho, but I thought that auto-saves will be enough. As for UI, just try increasing readability of text, add backgrounds (semi-transparent if you want) to blocks,  so text wouldn't blend with background, use some kind of ""tab"" system, instead of that ""Back"" and display content at the same side where the button is (""missions"", ""achievements"" are on right and display things on left)."
IndieDev,32pr11,SnoutUp,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:51:07 2015 UTC,"Yes I realized that after I did this post, well for the future I will know :)  About the saving, I tried to adapt the game to the weak capabilities of my vps server so designed most of the scripts, timers etc. as ""not often"" as possible so it will not overload anything. The auto save if it's turned ON is by default once every 5 minutes, also it has condition that You need to have at least some ammount of money or knights so it won't be abused. I was thinking if I should allow people to let them chose timer of how often the auto save would be, also do You think I should lower the condition for the auto save? Right now as I checked is minimum 500 gold or 5 knights which I see probably is too much :P"
IndieDev,32pr11,ronconcoca,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:25:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, my mistake! Apparently my save is fine, I just got confused on which PC I played your game. It was a morning without coffee for me. But you're right, the conditions of auto-save should be lower, let the player decide his pace or style of playing. In the game I'm making auto-save is every 30s, although I don't care about overloading anything.  Also, it would be nice to know what are the conditions for getting the next building or warrior.  And having idle income is a very attractive feature for most of the incremental game players."

Yes You are right with knowing the conditions, I've been aware of that for some time, I have that in mind for my ""next update"".  Just to make sure by idle income You mean the futures that are already in the game yes? :P I purposely wanted to make the system a little bit more ""complex"" that's why I did buildings that will generate the income, and army that will take the money so the player would need to balance it :D I understand it's a good feature? :)  I have a question if You don't mind about Your experience with the speed of this website so far? I'm asking that because the server is located in Europe (France) while I am in Asia thus the website is quite slow for me, but i presume it would work better and faster on closer ""regions"" ?"
IndieDev,32pr11,joffuk,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:14:24 2015 UTC,"Damn, I'm really bad with writing today - I mean offline income, not idle income :)  The speed is fine for me (Europe), but there still are some UI delays, but mainly because of how things are loaded in your game (calling PHP scripts). Usually, it's mostly front-end JS, which makes other games very fast and responsive :)"

IndieDev,32me08,notafryingpan_games,3,Tue Apr 14 23:16:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, what you're describing is pretty common in any kind of programming and there are a few ways of getting around it.  The main one I use in my day job is called Agile which I think you can take a few tips from. I don't recommend going crazy on it, I think it's a bit too much for single person indie dev, but the main thrust is ""Only ever code what you immediately need"" and ""Don't be afraid to come back and change things"".  In your example I'm guessing you'd know at least some of the potential for creep at the ""big rock"" stage, because some of that is central to the mechanics. If not, I'd concentrate on your up front planning instead. But if it's just a random example I'd approach it like this:   Program the interaction. Player presses talk button, proximity to shopkeeper, shopkeeper triggers dialogue. Program the dialogue. Implement leaving because you're going to need it to test that talking works. Buying is identified as being more complex, so do it as part of the next phase. Program buying interaction. To actually buy an item the shopkeeper needs an inventory. Does the player already have an inventory system? Can this be made generic enough to be reused for the shopkeeper? If so, implement a simple buying system without worrying about cost or item stock. If not, consider working on a generic inventory system for any character first. Program the more complex parts of the buying system. Create a way to track your market forces and so on.   Basically take your ""creep waterfall"" and turn it into a sequence of development events. In the example above you could cut development short at any of the last three points and still have something to publish. Ok, it's not going to be your vision, but it's not going to be a ""This isn't implemented"" message either. Plus you can leave this, work on something else, come back to it etc. and prioritise its importance to your overall game that way.  Anyway, hope that helps some."

IndieDev,32me08,Rotorist,2,Wed Apr 15 01:47:43 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to part with your design or even your work. I have also realized that I must chop off some of the features that I have already coded for the sake of the game's overall integrity. But I'm also thinking about including these features as unlockable easter eggs, so that they still gets presented to the player without becoming harmful to the integrity or leading you down a time blackhole."
IndieDev,32me08,jestermax22,2,Tue Apr 14 23:42:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely look into Agile processes as one of the other posts here suggested. I use it at my workplace and it has advantages. For home projects, I take ideas from it, but I'm a lot less rigid as they're usually just casual projects that I'd like finished at some point, but they don't have a deadline.  I wrote an article one time about a technique I use (again, heavily borrowing from Agile): stack-ranked lists. Essentially I put the features I want in my game and I put them in a list using Excel or GDocs. I have a column next to each item to grade how important I think they are to what I'm working on. Then I sort my list by that number. If you want to avoid feature creep, focus on clearing out say every item with a rank of less than 10 (1 is most important, 50 is least). This way you know what to work on next and you have a venue to log new ideas, but not have them clutter up your current work."
IndieDev,32mk1g,MaybeItsTetra,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:06:25 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting idea. Here are the things I think this can be improved with:   Each game must have a demo. If it's a recommendation site, then people should have an option to experience each game for free before they decide on a purchase. Randomized games. The watcher should have an option to get a random list of games that the website has instead of just what you recently submitted. More informative description on the site. The short descriptions are fine, but if the watcher is interested in a game and wants to know more about it, he should have an option to click something like a ""Show more"" button to know more. I know you have the link to the App Stores that have descriptions, but those are never really 100% well written, and they are really there to make the game more cool before actually describing the game."

I think You should add option to click on the image/description, or just text ""Read more"" next to the short description and it will transfer You to the part of the website where You have have full description of the game, also maybe some videos of the game/gameplay, maybe your opinion about the game etc; You chose.

IndieDev,32frpk,Moustache_Ryder,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:59:56 2015 UTC,"Alright, going off the Intrigue part of the theme, I'm making a semi-stealth uncover-the-conspiracy game. I only have a prototype right now (and I don't know if I'm going to have much of a game at the end of next week, probably only one level). Here's a screenshot of the game in it's current state.  The background changes colors every now and then, and the whitish light square is the player (upper left corner). The other three squares are guards, and they move on a set path until alerted. If the square (not the light) of the player enters their light, then the ""alarm"" goes off and the background goes full red and the guards start chasing you.   I had this sort of idea for this game when I first saw the theme Intrigue, but I didn't know for a while how to implement lighting into it using Godot in 2D. Then I checked the Godot download page and there was a beta with 2D lighting and Navigation2D systems, so that was nice."

For example, I have scheduled group meetings at school for an hour before we need to go to class, because then it's not an option to continue longer.   Another way to do it, is to schedule meetings to right before people leave for the day. My father told about a company he worked for, where they had weekly meetings covering mostly nothing when he got hired. He moved the meetings to one hour before closing on Friday and quickly reduced the time spent on those meetings, since people were more interested in going home than repeating the same thing over and over."

The most recent game that I can think, that I've played, was Zelda: Skyward Sword; God, was that sword annoying. But there are also ones that designed specifically for difficulty (e.g. Dark Souls).  I think it also comes down to design. Skyward Sword was targeted at a broader audience, including children. In a fast pace style such as your game, I think that it would be beneficial to always have a simple list to quickly show the different combinations available. Especially if you have a large number of combinations."

If it turns out to be even somewhat a success and we can make more games then we will be moving on to a dev/studio account.

Synergies between mechanics make a game feel great.""   I myself have spent a lot of time working with that. We've got a great system in place (well... on paper so far) for how the primary mechanic is going to be utilized. When you refer to adding ""random"" mechanics, and the feeling of synergy, are you saying that other mechanics should be added to increase the depth and complexity of the gameplay, but to never allow them to overshadow the primary/original one?"

IndieDev,312jpu,CullenCoyote,2,Mon Apr 6 18:56:49 2015 UTC,"That's not nearly enough money.  You should break down the hourly costs of everyone under your employ for the time you need to do it.  For a years worth of work for two people, the higher of the two numbers you gave was about 1400 per person, per month.  That might sound ""okay"" for income, but that wouldn't be all for income-- you have company costs like domain registration, an office, internet, devkits, etc-- so subtract what it costs to work from that.  For any kind of start up not working out of a bedroom, that should be at least 400 dollars, which leaves a team of only two both making 1200 per month.  MINUS the self employment taxes of about 18%---1058.  So that's how much each person makes in a team of two for a year of work.  THEN, you have a 50% rev share, taking out 30% (industry standard publishing platform cost).  which means every 10 dollars you sell, you only get $3.50, minus again of course the self-employment tax leaving you with $3.08 per ten dollar sale.  which means, in order to make what you were funded, you need to sell about 10,000 copies, which is ridiculous.

IndieDev,310tdk,Applzor,3,Wed Apr 1 05:30:31 2015 UTC,"What went well during the MixTape?   Well, uh... I made a working game within 2 weeks. Considering that I had never finished a game before (if you can call Prism a ""finished game""), I consider that a bit of an accomplishment.   What would you do differently?   Prism only has one puzzle, and once you're done with that, there's nothing left unless you mod the game to add more. I think next time, I'll try to aim for something with procedural generation, so that the game can create more content for as long as the player wants to keep playing (like /u/galacticdude7's Light Warrior).  I also misjudged how much time I'd have available to spend on the game, and I used an engine that I'm not greatly familiar with. Misjudging available time was just the whole ""life throws too many things at you"" situation, though, and as for the engine... the Godot Engine was still the right choice, since the only engine I do have extensive experience with is the really crappy, incomplete engine I was trying to make before I found Godot. So even though I spent a lot of my time trying to learn Godot instead of making progress on the game, I don't consider that a mistake. I learn best by jumping into things, so making Prism was a good way to learn Godot.   What would be your number one takeaway?   Just try it. This was my first game jam, and honestly I don't think I would have joined if it weren't for the fact I was already on the list of participants. Too afraid of failure, afraid that I wouldn't be able to come up with a game idea and I'd end up with absolutely nothing. But it worked out, mostly. It was fun, and good experience. Don't let fear of failure stop you trying; let it drive you onwards."
IndieDev,310tdk,WriterOfAlicrow,2,Wed Apr 1 13:59:22 2015 UTC,"What went well during the MixTape?   I think the main thing that went well was scoping the project.

I waited too long before actually putting it in front of people. As soon as I got that first bit of hands on from others. It highlighted flaws in the game that had I done earlier would have saved me a lot of time.   What would be your number one takeaway?   Test early, test often. After the initially testing I did, I started doing it every day and every single time it highlighted something new that I hadn't thought of."
IndieDev,310tdk,Arowx,2,Wed Apr 1 11:56:06 2015 UTC,"SalvageRL   The Good?   Oddly enough taking part in the 7DRL improved my productivity as I had less time to mess up and overextend the game.  So I focused on quickly putting together a 7DRL style game.  Only I wanted to do it in 3d with 3d graphics in space.  I'm quite impressed with the bullet time mechanic, time moves very slowly when you are not interacting with the game and then when you do something time moves forward in real time.  So even though you are in a complex 3D space you have time to look around and assess your options.  Also the derelicts have worked out quite well giving the impression of massive broken spaceships, procedurally generated and working at a playable frame rate.   The Bad?    It took ages to hand code the procedural generation of the hulks as they have an inner shell and an outer armoured shell.  Ended up writing a mini tool to ensure the correct sides would be generated.  Taking up nearly a full day.  Then working late I managed to break the settings and then had to spend time re-working out what the settings were.  Extending my quick 7DRL into a more fully featured JAM game was time consuming and disheartening as time was running low and these meta game elements took time to implement but added little to the experience of the game.   The Ugly?    Writing small tools to help you work out complex issues is a great way to get a feature right, and repair it if it gets broken.  But you should backup critical game balancing / procedural generation data.  Sometimes a well crafted tweaked fun game can be negatively impacted by meta game elements that change those settings.  For instance I added a leveling up ship configuration system, in the process the game took a massive backward step in fun as now the player starts with a slower lower powered ship."
IndieDev,310tdk,galacticdude7,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"GAME - Light Warrior   What went well during the Mixtape?   Overall I felt that the game that came out of this Mixtape for me was a pretty good game, and the extra experience I got out of using the Unity engine to develop this game will be beneficial for future projects of mine. I was also to implement the High Score table in the game, which is the first time I've done anything like that, and it was the first time I had to deal with saving data between playthroughs.   What would you do differently?   It isn't really a whole lot of stuff that I would do differently, but a lot of stuff I wanted to add, but didn't get the time to do it. There were a couple of other AI patterns I wanted to put into the game to make it more interesting to play, I also wanted to make the difficulty more dynamic as you get further in the game, and I wanted to put in a shield system where the shield would only protect against certain colored enemies. Alas though, I had to scrap these ideas due to time constraints. I also wanted to add music to the game, but I suck at composing music and finding music that I can freely use is easier said than done.   What would be your number one takeaway ?   No matter how well you scope a game project, there is going to be features that you are going to want to add, but due to constraints, you are going to have to leave something out. That's just one of those facts of life sometimes."
IndieDev,310tdk,Enemby,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:47:21 2015 UTC,"Game: LightBox  What Went well during the MixTape?  Hundreds of users subscribed to /r/indiedev due to the jam. I received my first payment ever for making games ($1 was paid for lightbox :) ) But overall I don't feel too happy about this game jam.  What would you do differently?  Honestly, I shouldn't have joined up in the game jam. I piled on extra stress, giving me a pretty bad two weeks. I think I was too ambitious with game mechanics, especially since I'm not a particularly experienced game developer. I wasted a lot of time trying to do things which were harder than I expected.  I jumped into the Mix Tape Jam without giving myself enough data, which made me greatly disappointed by lack of Critique or Comments, since I wouldn't be able to use the game jam for much of anything.  What would be your number one takeaway?  I think I failed in this game jam, since what I ended up with barely counts as a game, and doesn't have much content. The amount of ""game"" I ended up with implies a game jam more like Ludum Dare where the time frame is smaller. I learned quite a bit about Narrative mechanics in games though, as well as learning how to use Unity 5's UI system.  Summary:  In some ways, I can consider LightBox a positive experiment, but what it needs is more time/polish for it to be a passable game. At the moment It's a bit of a wash, and I would need to do more with it to consider it a good game in my eyes.  I was able to use some music of mine in the game though, which I consider a positive thing since I don't have much musical ability, but it turned out pretty well. I was also able to use some pixel art, but I ended up tracing over renders anyway, which is pretty cheat-y.  All in all, I think I did improve my gamedev abilities over the jam, but I am definitely not very happy with where I ended. It's pretty cool that my sprite ended up being used for the jam. I'd probably want to remake that, too, eventually."

What went well during the MixTape?  I think the idea is amazing and for a tiny subreddit, the turn out was tremendous. Eleven of the developers created beautiful and fun games. The more experienced devs had a chance to show what they could and the less experienced ones had a chance to try something. Like /u/WriterOfAlicrow stated, just try it.  This mix tape definitely breathed life into the community in a way that very few subreddits offer.  I have to thank the developers for agreeing to be a part of this. I know the first one didn't offer that much exposure or promotion, but I hope it was educational and ultimately changed the indie scene just a little bit. Perhaps you got a couple new fans, perhaps a couple brilliant ideas. I mean, just the name changed something. /u/Arowx came up with the idea of an indie mix tape, we announced it and a few days later, look what happened! Curve Digital totally ripped us off. :P  So... the mix tape is being noticed. I like that. I hope we continue to have that kind of promotional success in the future for our sub and ultimately for our participants.  What would you do differently?  I'm going to have to organize a lot of things. For example, the mix tape rules will get their own wiki page and past mix tapes will be fully documented in the wiki. Without this kind of organization, it was really messy to promote, explain and give feedback all in one place.  Also, the first and second mix tapes will not have this problem... but at some point we'll have to figure out how the process of choosing participants works. Voting? First come, first serve? I want it to be fair.  This mix tape exists for good reasons, but I think there needs to be a slight shift though. There weren't a lot of tips, but there was a lot of interest. I think this mix tape has to shift focus, it's a showcase for indie developers. It teaches you how to present your game and builds up reputation. I think those things are invaluable in the long run, along with learning something new and having fun I'd like that to be the big take away.  What would be your number one takeaway?  I need to streamline a lot of things. This subreddit grew fast, the jam got big and it was hard to moderate. /u/Applzor really helped out with organizing the posts.  A second mix tape is in order. I'll send each of the eleven developers their share of the tips jar, reread the suggestions we got during the jam session, do the organization stuff I mentioned and announce the next one.  My number one takeaway is that this works. The mix tape works."
IndieDev,310tdk,Arowx,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:13:50 2015 UTC,"Good job, not bad for first mix tape.    I would suggest that it doesn't have to be just Jam games.  For instance there could still be a jam and a submission date/deadline but it could also be opened up to indie developers with none jam games.  That way you could guarantee N completed free indie games on a tape but with a preference for the JAM entries that get made.  The out of JAM entries could be voted on for entry onto the tape or you could just use a first come first served approach and games that missed the tape could be bumped to the next mix tape.  If you get too many games just roll out a none Jam Mix tape!  Also there are lots of game jams happening you could invite indies from other JAM's to enter put their games on a mix tape.  e.g. Ludum Dare"
IndieDev,30xx2w,jocloud31,6,Tue Mar 31 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"When someone goes around citing how 'the community' has been asking for it for a long time, or how the dev 'promised' it a long time ago (may or may not be true - often not), or how other similar games have these features ... it's typically just a way to pressure the dev to create it under the thin veil of wanting them to give it away for free.  They'll probably threaten to quit until they realize that no other game is quite as enjoyable as this one, so they turn that frustration into pointless whining on forums...  While people have a knack for calling others greedy, without confronting or recognizing their own greed, at the end of the day, they just want more out of the game they already enjoy.   That's a good problem for a dev to have."
IndieDev,30xx2w,Bibdy,5,Tue Mar 31 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"Well for me if the dev says  ""I/we will put A thing up X day"" and then don't do that that I can understand the entitlement, but if you´r just starting out I doubt you will encounter many of these people."

IndieDev,30xx2w,JamesCoote,2,Tue Mar 31 17:54:41 2015 UTC,"This is part of what turns me off wanting to make games for  ""gamers"". Of course, I have no evidence that more casual game players are any less entitled. I suspect it's the polar opposite: That they just don't care enough to treat the game as anything more than a free throwaway distraction. But I just like the idea of making a game that someone picks up in a momentary laps of apathy, yet turns into something really special for that player."
IndieDev,30xx2w,djentbat,2,Tue Mar 31 23:03:56 2015 UTC,"I just keep telling myself that I'm making the game for me, and if other people like it that's just an added bonus."

IndieDev,30xx2w,Rotorist,2,Wed Apr 1 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"In one way devs do owe the buyer. They are putting money into it, so the game should be good. If there is a lot of content readily available, a good quality game. Then the devs owe you nothing they succeded in their job. This why I dont understand when people complain about a game being the same thing over and over again, yet they still buy it. If you don't like what said studio is doing don't buy it, don't like dlc? Don't buy it. The devs owe you nothing if you don't purchase anything from them."

Technically you can do a bit more thanks to there being a built in coding language, but it's more of a hassle to prototype in for me.  I also gave Click team Fusion a go, but while I know it was powerful, for some reason it felt like I had to work around the system more.  Construct, Game Maker, Click team Fusion and Stencyl are all geared towards making platformers though so you'll be able to get off the ground quickly no matter what you choose."

Some of the games are web games though, so we have to figure out if we are just going to include a link to the webpage in the zip or try to include it.  The other problem with a launcher is that I'm not sure we can have it for every mix tape. I learned a lot from this mix tape and I want to try to make the second one a smoother experience for the developers. Figuring out what kind of launcher to use and how to make it each time would probably take longer to organize than a few zips."

The problem with this at the moment is some games have links to multiple builds and some to web pages.  Could I recommend itch.io as they provide hosting a simple webpage setup for the games and screenshots and they are free with a donation button system.  Although even with dropbox or similar I think you should be able to host a simple web page file with links and graphics.  Pros: this decouples the builds and updates from the link so the developer can add and improve the game and the link will still be valid.  Cons: we are relying on a third party for hosting our games.

But start prototyping with the simplest things first e.g. player as blue square, enemies as red then put in:  player movement player shooting enemies moving enemies shooting  Then iterate out from there, this way you will get quick feedback and can focus on the gameplay mechanics first before the graphics.  Check out some of the great tutorials on juicing your game for improved look and feel.  Then playtest your gameplay directions and don't be afraid to drop things that don't add fun."

I don't like either how there's no mention of price point and the only screenshot is of a TV, not the raw output. I think it's definitely too early to be going live, considering that there's very little content to look at, or a location to 'drive' your users to and foster talking about the console (Google+ doesn't count). Not seen are any designs or concepts of the 'final' console, which is a little worrying. Developers would like more information (definitely) about the current console specs, given that there is so little information here it would be impossible to try to develop anything."
IndieDev,2zwko8,Enemby,3,Sun Mar 22 19:31:39 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right about having a ""base"" site where everyone can see all of the info on the project. I guess ideally I should have a facebook account for it since there's huge amounts of traffic. Also, I do indeed need to post raw image renderings and not TV shots. I need to figure out how to feed the video into a capturing card.  I'm not sure I understand the part where you mentioned there not being enough information on the hardware end. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but on the imgur profile, I specified the system ROM size, RAM size, CPU speed, and video output method. Besides the fact I didn't specify a programming language, is this not enough information from a programming point-of-view? All of the other specs are of concern only to the engineers.  Also you mentioned that overall, it was too early for me to be presenting the console as there were no concept art of the final console and that there's just not enough information to develop anything. From what I understand game companies don't finish a console and then write games, they develop the console and design the games simultaneously so that when the console is finished, the game are ready to go.  Again, I appreciate any and all feedback; it helps me know what I'm doing wrong."

IndieDev,2zlpb8,Trevj,3,Thu Mar 19 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"Twitter, IndieDB, and Reddit.  I honestly haven't used many others, but I haven't heard of people having much luck with anything else.  So if there are others that are useful for an indie dev I would love to know which ones."
IndieDev,2zlpb8,Quade81,3,Thu Mar 19 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, I've tried facebook as well, but as of now it's only been my friends who have liked it. Twitter and Reddit have been the most successful for me."
IndieDev,2zlpb8,vreiche,3,Thu Mar 19 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"Tumblr has worked pretty well for me.   Works best if you have a really pretty game. You should definitely go for visual heavy content - pretty much every post should be focused around a screenshot or gif.   Also, make sure to follow lots of other devs to get your own follower count up and see what others are up to."
IndieDev,2zlpb8,jellyberg,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:47:41 2015 UTC,Good to know.  I've spent the last two weeks making my game look prettier.  I'll get on that.
IndieDev,2zlpb8,Quade81,4,Thu Mar 19 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"I've tried Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram the past few weeks.   Twitter seems to be the fastest way to get out information to a large audience because everyone is so interconnected. However, it takes a lot of time and effort to stay plugged in with the community. I've heard about services that will auto-tweet based on a schedule, so maybe I should check that out. However, I think nothing beats a real retweet or message to your followers.  Tumblr has crazy-polished content (compared to Instagram). I don't know why that is. Whenever I search the #gamedev hash, I see all these amazing games that look like they have so much content with great art. It could be that Tumblr's theme is around blogs, which are more in-depth posts, so people really put time and effort into each one.   Instagram is my favorite as a game developer right now. The posts are usually succinct with a screenshot or video plus a comment. I actually get people finding my content with the #gamedev hash. If you leave someone a nice comment, they will always reply back @yourusername (so nice!).   My conclusions thus far is this: Twitter is great for press-releases, given that you have a large following. Great if you are a celebrity or have something a lot of people like. Tumblr is great for building a close following, because blogs have so much content, and people really pay attention to your story if you write well. This is probably the best place to build a niche audience. Instagram has the best balance of work-required/attention-earned ratio. As an indie dev personally, I don't have that much time dedicated to detailed blogs, or writing tweets by-the-hour.  And Reddit is always great. Anywho, if you guys decide to try any of these out, add me at @fizzyfrosty : P"

IndieDev,2zlpb8,Quade81,3,Thu Mar 19 18:57:16 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  Team17 focus very heavily on Twitter. There's 2 reasons for this:   Our target audience is there. Twitter has a (relatively) young demographic in comparison to other sites and a heavy gaming audience.  Our key influencers are there. Journalists, youtubers, streamers, platform holder influencers (major nelson and the like)   What this results in is greater potential for virality.   The issue that I find with Reddit is that it's twice the work - audiences are segmented here and, whilst that means that you can target your messaging very precisely depending on the subreddit that you're engaging on, it also means that for messages intended for a wide audience you need to post them multiple times.  Pro tip - ditch Facebook. Young people are flocking away from it because their entire family is on there and it's no longer ""cool"". Were it not for Team17's 1M strong audience there, I'd have completely stopped all activity on there already.  Niche networks like Instagram and Vine are great if you have the appropriate content for them.  MT17"
IndieDev,2zlpb8,mike_team17,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:53:10 2015 UTC,"Good observations, thank you. It doesn't surprise me what you are saying about Facebook. With 1m followers, what kind of active participation do you see from your audience?"
IndieDev,2zlpb8,mike_team17,2,Fri Mar 20 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"Less than 10% of that audience engage. That's partly because Worms has an ageing fan base and we're taking steps to address that, but it's also because Facebook make it very, very hard for you to reconnect with fans that you've fallen our of touch with (which is very easy when you can only reach a maximum of 14% of your total audience size with any one post on Facebook).  You should consider Facebook as a paid for marketing/ad channel now as it's the only way to reach your total audience."
IndieDev,2zlpb8,Prax150,2,Mon Mar 23 12:29:10 2015 UTC,"You can set up feeds that post on multiple social media networks, most easily FB and Twitter. It's not ideal since both have their quirks and ideal ways to post, and it can be pretty apparent to the end user, but it's a time saver and not really a big deal if you can occasionally tailor information to either.  Otherwise, it depends on what you want to accomplish. Facebook can be tough because you need people to actually like your page, and it's really hard to do that organically without paying for ads.  Twitter is a little simpler since everything you post is public but you have to be more active, tweeting at other people, following, retweeting etc.  Things like Pinterest and Instagram can be useful too, although I don't know what the gaming communities are like on those. Plus you can crosspost between feeds for Instagram."
IndieDev,2zlpb8,ccricers,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"Twitter has been the best for me, and I'm not usually good in promoting stuff through social media. The way it's setup makes content very ""contagious"". Make those hashtags count.  The TIGsource forums also look like a great place to make your dev log home there. There are some great games whose developers mainly communicate to others from there."

IndieDev,2zlpb8,paperskulk,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"I occasionally do art for hobby games, but it's my boyfriend who is the indie dev. He has a blogroll (feedly? or whatever some rss reader) that he checks daily, he loves dev blogs (kept independently on blogger or wordpress or their own site, not a network) and will pour over them for hours. The benefits for the consumer of this mode is that the devs write a lot more, do more explaining, do more out-loud planning, etc.  He also uses tumblr a lot, there is a fairly robust game dev tag and communities of programmers/devs/artists. Tumblr isn't great for networking for your OWN relationships, but it is good for getting your work out there for others to see. on tumblr people like pretty screenshots and a short write up explaining it, as well as some lifestyle junk (desk/workspace porn) and in-progress things."

IndieDev,2zl2re,jlink5,2,Thu Mar 19 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely getting in early has advantages since there will be a huge demand for content on these platforms. I don't think indies will be barred by high quality AAA titles for the same reason they're not on other platforms. The advantage indie has is mobility, and in VR I still think the most innovative games are going to come from there.  And yes, we're ready :)"

IndieDev,2zl2re,JamesCoote,1 point,Sat Mar 21 08:42:38 2015 UTC,"VR already looks pretty crowded to me. The time has long passed for getting onboard at the ground floor and riding the wave.   I'm not going to get involved till I have the resources to do it properly. Some indies are definitely capable of doing it well, but probably far fewer than think they can.  Also, I'm still slightly skeptical still about VR, since most devs seem intent on trying to bend the technology to their existing holodeck fantasies, rather than making experiences that fit within its constraints.  AR conversely, feels a little under-rated by game developers at the moment. Taking video games outside and into the real world doesn't seem to get them quite as worked up, which may just leave the door open for someone with a really great idea to come in and steal the show when the tech matures in a couple of years time"

IndieDev,2zdakg,SonnyBone,2,Tue Mar 17 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"I wrote an article called Bringing Your Game to Life in 10 Simple Steps. (Warning: embedded HTML5 demo and several GIFs)  Don't let the goofy clickbait title fool you, it's not a top 10 list or a paint-by-numbers programming tutorial. It's more about the thought processes and design philosophies that accompany the incremental improvement of a very simple prototype. The article corresponds with the embedded demo so you can follow along and play each iteration.  Here's an excerpt from the article:  ""Whether it's a simple game jam entry or a long-term passion project, your game needs to feel alive in the hands of players. In this tutorial, I'll share ideas for bringing your game to life, and demonstrate what happens when you apply every one of those ideas to a simple game demo.  This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a very basic game, showing the thought process behind the additions and changes made across 10 iterations to make the experience come to life.  What exactly do I mean when I talk about bringing your game to life? This is one of those game design philosophies that varies greatly across the industry, but I personally define game life as the combination of control, feedback, variation, and permanence. Game life is not all about complex AI and deep, character-driven stories. It’s about how the game responds to your input and how it delivers specific feedback to stimulate your senses and reflexes.   For this example, I’ve decided to go with a basic 2D sidescrolling platformer-shooter. If you’re developing a turn-based RPG, then the specific details aren’t going to apply to your project. But that’s not the point. The importance of this article lies in why certain decisions are made, not the technical implementations of each iteration.   Each iteration of the game corresponds to a specific section below. You can follow along in the provided game demo by switching between the different iterations. This will illustrate how a game comes to life over time through simple, incremental changes.""  Full article: Bringing Your Game to Life in 10 Simple Steps"

I saw base and rockets as building options, but you didn't build any ships, why not? Also, even though this is an early video for your game, there should probably be somebody speaking in your video. Even text over the video would help, but when you talk you humanize it and you naturally come up with questions about your own game while creating a script or prompt. So what's the deal, do you take over asteroids around you, or are you just on the one asteroid? If you can take over asteroids around you, how do you facilitate meteor moguls but guarantee a space for everyone?

IndieDev,2z5f30,CaesarNaples2,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:54:12 2015 UTC,"Hey - I started in a fairly random way. I downloaded Unity and played around with it. After some time I thought I should just make a game instead of playing with Unity.  I thought of an old game called Fragile Allegiance and used that as my inspiration.  I have a day job where I develop software for a living so I guess Unity and C# were easy to learn.  There are many things that need to happen prior to the release like a complete graphics revamp with professional art, music and sound. Major gameplay mechanics like ship building, fleet management and melee, spies and diplomacy need to be added.   As for the release itself I expect a healthy community around the game already so I am not as much focused on the release as on the journey towards it. Hopefully at release time there will be many people playing Scarcity at any one time around the globe on the servers I am hosting and their own."

Our player's mission is to be a 'pathfinder', avoiding capture, while shutting out the lights and paving the way towards the city center.  Day 6 Update: Have started tracking how many lights the player collects. Why? Because she can use them as a weapon to blind enemy guards. I may also allow the player to ""supercharge"" a shot which will cost more ""light points"".  The light-shooting is not fully implemented, but I can show you a neat WIP video of it in action. Check it out here  I'm kicking around the idea of storing the stolen lights in an array, so the same lights can be shot back by the player (instead of the generic prefab).

You can now rotate the object on the screen and you can attach balls of light to the object.   The rotating of the object was surprisingly simple to get working and getting the rotation relevant to the camera and not the object itself was as easy as multiplying the delta by the inverse of the objects rotation, I still need to add in an independent rotation around the Z axis.  Just for testing purposes, but I've made it so that the model when the game starts auto rotates randomly and randomly chooses a mesh to use. I will change it up so that choosing a level dictates the mesh used, but this will do for testing for now.  Here are some screenshots of how it is progressing. I'm using Suzanne as my display/testing model since she has a good silhouette and so you don't know what objects are going in the final game.   Screenshot 1: First light Screenshot 2: Rotating the Object Screenshot 3: Adding more lights Screenshot 4: Silhouette is starting to become easier to identify"

Update 4: Narrative Aesthetics  I've now completed most of the narrative code goals I set in my previous update, but I'm not really sure what I'll do about character portraits. This is what characters speaking looks like currently, but I have mixed feeling about it, due to the low contrast to the game environment, and the cut-off nature of the sprites, makes me feel pretty strongly about having a border.   I spent a little while testing out some different borders, before I picked the one of the far right.  Still, that particular border doesn't look quite right without a background, so I added a quick dark gradient to darken it and we're done! It's still going to be a bit before I add these features into the current narrative system, but it's looking good!    Twitter   Youtube    Website"

Here is a link to the most recent build.  Again, currently presented as a web build with the intention of having a Windows, Mac, and Linux build upon completion.  I've added a bar behind the player that changes color as it takes more damage, gradually going from green to red. I've also added healthpacks (spawn as white circles) that require the player to shoot them once with each color bullet to get the health, and I changed the movement and firing to the mouse. I've also sped up the enemies.  Controls for this build are mouse to move up and down, left click to fire, and 1 to change bullets to red, 2 to change bullets to blue, and 3 to change bullets to green.  If you'd like to leave me feedback fill out this google form. Please don't leave feedback as a reply, I want all the feedback for this prototype in one place. Also be absolutely brutal if you need to in the feedback. Don't sugar-coat your criticisms. Thank You."

Some of these photosensors control the fancy-schmancy thingymabob you're trying to activate (the goal of each level), while others control optical elements. Pretty sure this has been done before, but I'm doing it with multiple colors!!     Latest update:  Update 1: less-buggy lasers, rotating mirrors, and photosensors that do stuff  This should have been two (or more) separate updates, but I kept thinking ""Oh, let me just add this to the demo before making the video--oh, bug"" so it kinda built up.  Anyway, lasers stop when they hit stuff now, you can rotate mirrors by clicking them (unless they're controlled by a photosensor), and photosensors can control lasers and mirrors.  Video is here.     Note on lack of updates:  I've been busy doing college stuff this week (including working on an essay and studying for a test), so I didn't have much time to work on the game.

IndieDev,2yvvy0,DreadnaughtZero,1 point,Fri Mar 13 08:59:59 2015 UTC,Sorry to say this but I think this views are a little naive. It's pretty much ignorant of the fact that the F2P explosion hit the entire Western gaming market from out of nowhere a couple of years back and technology and design has been struggling to catch up with it.  Is bad F2P prevalent in the market? Yes. Did many companies screw up on implementation F2P mechanics? Yes. The point is that we're getting BETTER at doing it and we have FAR better tools to measure whether a particular implementation of a mechanic is well received by the consumer. Basing gameplay design decisions solely of anecdotal reports like this will result in death for an indie dev trying to make a F2P game.

Or could we make the first level of the game and put a really slow progress bar on the next level that only completes when the players have payed enough to have the next level constructed.  Kind of a reversed Kickstarter funding model.  Or gamify our lives, our games are linked to our lives.  The indie developer survival app!

While the lack of tips doesn't bother me, the money we'd get was probably never going to be enough to warrant withdrawing into real money for me to use anyway, but the lack of exposure does bother me. I'd like to get more feedback on my game so that I can iterate and make it better, but so far I've only gotten one person to provide me feedback, and while that feedback was helpful, it was only 1 person's thoughts, which makes it hard to separate what is just affecting that one person, and what is a larger issue.   This sub doesn't even have 1000 subscribers, and its foolish to think that anywhere near the 666 that are subscribed are going to come here everyday to check that one thread. If we have a daily thread, it's more likely to pop up when someone is browsing their front page, and then they'll check it out and see how things are going, but I'd bet that most people who saw the stickied thread on day one have just forgotten about check up every single day. Plus a daily post allows us to post on more popular subreddits like /r/gamedev or /r/gamedesign would get us more exposure and feedback."

I try to post cross-posts to other subs but at best they trickle in one or two redditors.

IndieDev,2yaldj,paetramon,9,Mon Mar 9 07:52:39 2015 UTC,"So excited for this opportunity to make and share games with you all!   I'll be working with the ""Light Receiver"" theme. My idea as it stands right now is to make a 3D sidescroller based around a character who goes around in the night stealing the light from a dystopian/oppressive society. Still working out how to 'gamify' this mechanic, so I'll update when I have some more of those details ironed out.  Story update  The game will be named Deluminus.  Fleshing out more of the story as I work. The protagonist (yet to be named) is a member of an underground rebellion acting against a totalitarian regime. The rebellion has planned an assault on the capitol, but due to enforced curfew, it is difficult to move through the night, undetected. Our player's mission is to be a 'pathfinder', avoiding capture, while shutting out the lights and paving the way towards the city center.   Shameless plug: you can also follow me on twitter at @SputnikBytes     Day 1:  1) Have our protagonist in/rigged/moving and controllable. Also been working on camera angle/follow and general aesthetics. Here's a clip!  2) Spent much of the night struggling with enemy animations. Didn't get them right before turning in for the night. I did, however, get a 'prop' in the game in the form of a car. It looks pretty good. Here's a clip of it.     Day 2:  1) I've got an enemy guard in-game and chasing the character. A lot more work to do on that front. I've started to implement the light-stealing mechanic, which is pretty cool! Also revamped the sidewalk and road textures. Check out the (poor quality) gif .... HERE!  2) Started working on a menu and random blinking lights as per /u/llehsadam's suggestion. Here's what we've got: Menu and Flickering  3) Actual video, so you can get a better feel for everything  4) Another video! This time showing off what happens if when you ""drop"" a light. Check it out!     Day 3:  1) I've adjusted lighting a little bit today...still needs some more tweaking. I've also worked on the light grabbing and dropping. You now need to click near the light source and hold the mouse down to grab the light. If you let go of the mouse, or get too far, the light gets ""dropped"". I also added drains with steam emitting from them. And tweaked all of the textures again. Enough talking. Here's a video  2) Not as much progress today, but I did add the ability for the player to grab light from the signs placed around the world. Also implemented the spark effect. Implemented a custom shader to get the sign text to stop showing up through objects. As usual, I've got a clip for you to watch. CLIP     Day 4:  1) Not much to show today. Added patrols for guards. They break patrol to follow the player when you enter into a certain distance and 'vision cone'. If you leave sight, they will follow you to your last known position and look around. If they can't find you, they return to their patrol. Also added more neon lights and such. Next I will program a 'visibility' factor so that the player is less detectable in the shadows/darkness.     Day 5:  1) I spent my limited time today rewriting my AI and navigation code. It was just too sloppy and hard to work with. The good news is, it's nearly complete and works in almost every situation I've thrown at it. I'll admit that I'm proud of myself considering this is my first time working with AI and AI navigation. A little more tweaking tomorrow and then I'm on to giving the player the ability to blind enemies with captured light. blinded by the light :-)  Here's today's video"
IndieDev,2yaldj,NeoShamanGames,4,Sun Mar 8 01:33:53 2015 UTC,This looks really awesome! Especially that car and light-stealing mechanic!
IndieDev,2yaldj,NeoShamanGames,3,Sun Mar 8 19:30:51 2015 UTC,I love the dark style. Looks great.
IndieDev,2yaldj,TheTacoLoco,2,Sun Mar 8 23:03:02 2015 UTC,"That car looks really nice, adds to the game's ambiance. Flickering lights would too.  This is really cool. I'm looking forward to your updates!"
IndieDev,2yaldj,TheTacoLoco,5,Sun Mar 8 18:48:50 2015 UTC,"Update 3 (March 13th)  Ok, I spent a lot of time researching pathfinding and platformer AI.  I had this idea that there would be rescue missions, and people would follow the player to safety.  I actually got the AI jumping over boxes and holes, but it can't do anything too complicated and it gets stuck a lot.  I'm not sure I'll end up using this feature after all, except for maybe really simple things. It would require a lot more work than I have time for in this jam to make proper AI that can navigate entire levels. Take a look at the video if you like. It also shows the new clock on the time capsules.  So, there are 9 days left and I better get on with the rest of the game!  I've been brainstorming so many idea for how to use the time travel mechanic.  Next I'm going to work on a trigger system.  There will be timers that send a single to start or stop something when the timer runs down, and also buttons you step on to activate things or start or stop a timer.  You can single doors to open or platforms to start or stop moving.  I think all these things combined with the time travel will allow for some really interesting level design.  I also have a really cool idea for a ""boss"" fight.  More to come.  Update 2 (March 11th)  Big news! I have the ""Time Capsules"" working.  It was a real technical challenge, but I persevered and made it work.  You can now fly back through frames of time in time capsules.  Here's a video showing it in action. (Sorry the capture quality is not great.) Now that that's out of the way I can start to think of more about the game and level design.  Fun stuff coming up.  Update 1 (March 9th)  I spent a lot of time looking for free sprites, but didn't find anything I really liked, so i decided I'll make the art assets myself.  I'm going with a super-whimsical style because anything realistic is too time-consuming for me!  Here's a the first screenshot.  Background parallax is working. I still have the default Unity robot boy, which I'll swap out later, since he's just a sprite and I'm going for a 2.5D look now.  I guess this will make a game in 3.5D because of +1 for time!  Today I'm going to focus on making a time portal work, since that will be the crux of the game!  Update 0 (March 8th)  Ok. I just went for a walk to meditate on the theme and I came up with this idea, which relates to Strange Geometry and Time-Travel:  Remember that scene in Interstellar where he's in the black hole and he can see inside his daughter's room at any point in time?  Well, the concept is similar to that but it will be primarily 2D, so the 3rd dimension can be used for time.  Basically, it is a 2D platform game where you have the ability to move backwards and forward through time (maybe at time portals placed throughout the world) by scrolling through time like cards on a rolladex.  Here's an image to help you visualize this.  You can jump to any frame and the NPCs and objects will have moved.  This could be just an action platformer, or perhaps more of a puzzle adventure game.  We shall see.  I'm going to be using Unity3D for this.  Going to start working on the basic platform functionality now.  I'm still brainstorming ideas for the story.  Suggestions are welcome!  Looking forward to doing this and playing everyone's games!"

IndieDev,2yaldj,Enemby,2,Wed Mar 11 08:31:30 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I get the concept. You travel back in time to when the boxes weren't flipped. Can you also travel forward in time?  In a more Machinarium-esque environment I can picture the character traveling forward in time to when a guard has his lunch break in order to get past him.  Time travel looks really fun! Can't wait to see the other obstacles you make for this mechanic."
IndieDev,2yaldj,WriterOfAlicrow,1 point,Wed Mar 11 11:07:35 2015 UTC,"Traveling forward would be really cool, I'm just not sure how technically feasible it is.

I'm going to investigate the idea and see if it's possible."
IndieDev,2yaldj,Enemby,5,Wed Mar 11 17:41:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, I might as well post my idea now, since it came to me a while ago.

That's right, you get red, green, and blue lasers, which you must combine, split, and filter to get the right color light to the photosensors. Some sensors may even react in whole different ways to different colors!     I have virtually no level/puzzle design experience, so this should be... interesting.  Also, depending upon my whims, I may include the (probably horrific) source code under the GPL!     Update 0: Initial laser work  Got basic laser functionality working. And figured out how to do a screen capture. You can check out the youtube video here. Apologies for the extreme ugliness.  The laser beam effect passes through objects at the moment, but that's purely visual (and will be fixed soon). Important things to note: laser turns on/off when you press the button, reflects properly against mirrors, and stops (mechanically-speaking, not visually) after hitting the first object. And the photosensor (ugly octagon thing) lights up when a laser hits it, turns off when the laser disappears.  Took a while to implement this stuff, largely because I haven't had enough experience with the Godot Engine to know how everything works yet. (And no, there's no other engine that I'm familiar with, except stuff that's purely rendering and doesn't include a visual editor, so Godot is my best bet here).  I think I have by far the ugliest demo video here. Will likely have the ugliest final game, too.     Update 1: less-buggy lasers, rotating mirrors, and photosensors that do stuff  This should have been two (or more) separate updates, but I kept thinking ""Oh, let me just add this to the demo before making the video--oh, bug"" so it kinda built up.  Anyway, lasers stop when they hit stuff now, you can rotate mirrors by clicking them (unless they're controlled by a photosensor), and photosensors can control lasers and mirrors.  Video is here."

IndieDev,2yaldj,TheTacoLoco,5,Mon Mar 9 01:52:50 2015 UTC,"Update 3: Operation: Narrative  I'm in the tail end of the code written to have characters talk to the player (cutscene sort of deal), but I'm frustrated because a method I thought of in a dream isn't transferring well to reality. It actually mostly works, but String.ToCharArray() or something to that effect has something against String arrays? It's hard to tell at the moment, but I'm sure I'll figure it out. Development has slowed down considerably due to me still being in High School and other reality slow downs, but I'm still chipping away at my pretty small spec for the game. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll finish the narrative code today, but I'm close. I might just sleep on it and hope I've figured it out by the time I get home from school.   Ha! Nevermind. I got it working. The root of the issue was I was calling the function way too many times. I disregarded this as the issue after I stuck the TypeText in Start() with my array var and it still didn't work. The quick fix was to call the function only after it had finished typing something. It looks great, and I made a quick sound effect with SFXR to really solidify the effect.  I even set up the narrative code to be able to load another script gameobject when it's complete. This is a cheap way to have conversations between characters. It still needs a bit of cleaning up before I can use it and have it look good, but I'm pretty happy. But in the interest of transparency, here's some things I still need to do:   Write some code to display a character portrait. Add some delay at the end of a finished phrase to allow some time for it to be read. Make the script call another script (if applicable) after it is done speaking. (really easy/fast) Make a neat border a character portrait frame. I have no ideas on that yet.   Today's Build    Update 2: Titlescreen and Player Movement  After a nice, good sleep, I woke up and wrote a bit of code to get the player working correctly (it's even pretty clean!), and revised the game spec a bit. I made a pretty quick title-screen, and linked it to the current test scene I've got going on. You can view a web build here (Sorry Alicrow). It's nothing special yet, just quick hookups for everything I've made so far. My connection isn't particularly fast though, so the chances of a daily build in the future are pretty low.  Build Controls:  You can switch Orb States with space, and you move with the typical WASD or arrow keys.    Update 1: Plotline Premise  I've decided on a rather simple plotline for the game, which is essentially a lone man creating the orb to win a large prize from a creepy corporation looking for tools that could break into any high-security location. I've made two tiny character sprites, so check these out! Face||Suitman  To create this (pretty simple) sprites, I generated a single man using MakeHuman, imported him into blender, added some ominous lighting, and rendered the resulting images to a 32x32 sprite. After that, I opened them in GIMP and gave them quick outlines to make them more fitting for my current theme.  EDIT: I also made this track    Update 0: Light Receiver Premise  When I saw the first post, a thought immediately jumped into my head as for a cool game.  A week or so ago, I was physically prototyping an idea for a stealth game I had (Read: Doodling) which involved the player literally being black. You could then blend into the background extremely seamlessly, and have a ray cast from the player to the light position to determine if you were in darkness. This old idea might be a little different, but it is still applicable to this theme.  What I want to do is essentially have a player that can switch between being a light orb and a dark orb. The light orb is extremely mobile and bouncy, but can be seen by light receivers (probably shown with obnoxious triangles). The dark orb can completely ignore light, but while the player is a dark orb, they have no control over it at all, and have to rely on existing momentum from the light orb's movement.   So in short, a physics-stealth-puzzle game dealing with light.    Twitter   Youtube    Website"
IndieDev,2yaldj,BuzzBadpants,3,Sun Mar 8 02:12:13 2015 UTC,That sounds like it could be pretty cool. Any chance it'll be available for Linux? (Or web-based (and not using that unity web player thingy)).

IndieDev,2yaldj,galacticdude7,3,Sun Mar 8 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"Update 6  So no new real content, but the controls have been tweaked much closer to a point where I'm happy about how it feels! http://youtu.be/eT7v1ncwFbE I just don't want to keep going down that rabbit hole. Either I'm getting way better at swinging or it's a lot easier now. Regardless, it's in the right direction. Now to make puzzles and more intractable environments. The puzzle I want for this scene is to turn the faucet on and overflow the sink along with all the dirty dishes onto the floor clearing the path.  Update 5  No new content today, but I did spend several hours coding up this tool to help me debug the joystick input values I was getting. I made a scene and a few scripts to display each of the joysticks, the mapped axes and their values on UI sliders. I uploaded the tool to the Unity asset store so hopefully you guys can find it useful to see how your input values change in realtime. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/32298 (The package is still pending review at the time of this post) This gave me some useful experience with the nice new UI system in Unity 5, but also highlighted how buggy Unity's joystick support is. Notably, controller hotplugging is NOT SUPPORTED. Also, all analog values are normalized to the range [-1,1] but are always assumed to start at 0. This misrepresents LT and RT on the 360 controller as default half-depressed.  Update 4  Ok, it took a bit of finagling, but I think the movement mechanics work a lot better now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_pVG2SEiRc No more retracting issues, but still very difficult to keep any momentum, so it's easier to exploit the spring tentacles to fly around. Also you can see in this video the new ""soft-body"" physics we use for the player. Just a lot of masses and springs, but works alright for these purposes. Unfortunately my dinky little macbook is hitching a lot with these graphics.  Update 3  Just a quick screenshot. It's really looking disgusting now! Kitchen  Update 2  Alright, so I've mostly been working on populating the world with models and textures. http://youtu.be/x3Bje4cMy24 Here's a countertop and some plates and stuff. As you can see, I'm still having issues with retracting the tentacles. I just reduce the max distance of the spring joints in the tentacles to 0, but it doesn't always make it to the center. I need a more clever solution.  Update 1  Phew! Got my movement mechanics working for the most part. http://youtu.be/MxBbpTDcYYM You can see the two tentacles being fired out from the big sphere. There's a few problems with the ""retract"" portion in that it doesn't always make it back, but it's almost useable! I'm going to commission an artist friend of mine to put together a 3d model of gross food to use as a skin for the player. I'll still need to figure out how to use the existing spheres as ""bones"" for that mesh.  Original Submission  Super excited about all of this! I've been rearing to make a new game since coming back from GDC!  I want to work with the ""Strange Geometry"" theme to make a physics puzzle platformer called ""Best If Used By"" where you play as some old leftovers gained sentience by being left alone in the fridge too long. As a blob of gross food, you can shoot 2 ""tentacles"" out into the world and they stick to objects and geometry, and you use this mechanics to move around in the world and solve puzzles. If it works like I think it will in my head, it should be a pretty fun game!  Only caveat is that you will need a controller to play the game since it will use both sticks. Updates incoming!"

IndieDev,2yaldj,absolutelyalmost,3,Wed Mar 11 11:11:34 2015 UTC,"Hey Everyone,  I'm going to be doing the Light Receiver theme and my idea is where you shoot X lights at an object that will stick to it and then you have to guess what it is based on the outline that you've revealed.   I had been working on a post-processing shader recently and I'm probably going to use it because I think it looks mad cool. You can check a screenshot of it here: http://i.imgur.com/sjuTKH3.png  Update 1 - 12/03/15:  So I've been procrastinating the last couple of days, but I sat down for another hour or two and added a few more features. You can now rotate the object on the screen and you can attach balls of light to the object.   The rotating of the object was surprisingly simple to get working and getting the rotation relevant to the camera and not the object itself was as easy as multiplying the delta by the inverse of the objects rotation, I still need to add in an independent rotation around the Z axis.  Just for testing purposes, but I've made it so that the model when the game starts auto rotates randomly and randomly chooses a mesh to use. I will change it up so that choosing a level dictates the mesh used, but this will do for testing for now.  Here are some screenshots ow it is progressing. I'm using Suzanne as my display/testing model since she has a good silhouette and so you don't know what objects are going in the puzzle.   Screenshot 1: First light Screenshot 2: Rotating the Object Screenshot 3: Adding more lights Screenshot 4: Silhouette is starting to become easier to identify"

CONCEPT  Flower Child [Working Title] WILL BE DOWNLOADABLE  You play as a young girl accompanied by an urban fox in the dystopian ruins of an underground city. Upon discovering something resembling life, in the form of a small flower, you and your fox buddy venture in search of more vegetation.  GAMEPLAY Basic sidescrolling puzzle/platformer. Basically, you'll be in a dark underground environment with the only light coming from cracks forming in the ceiling of the city (imagine beams of light). The fox will sniff out flowers in the darkness and you'll carry them into the beams of light whilst being wary of you're limited o2 supply. Some flowers/vegetation will supply more oxygen that others so you have to decide whether to take what you can get or explore further to find more fruitful plants.  DAY 1 Original character art:  Basic pixel style concept  Tried pixel art at first. Black and white to fit with ZX81. Changed to this?  Drawn style concept #1  I'm kinda leaning towards this style. Plan on using it to give contrast to the bleak/motionless backdrop by making all living things animate like this. (This animation is just an example) GAMEPLAY:  Basic movement and anim  Went ahead and hooked up my crude fox animations to a simple 2D movement script I wrote.

IndieDev,2y6lf4,kbrugger,4,Sun Mar 8 03:49:07 2015 UTC,"Good question :)  The number 1 feature of dogecoin is our awesome community!    Compared to the other major coins, dogecoin has the fastest transaction confirmations (1min compared to btc's 10min), lowest transaction fees ($0.000144 compared to btc's $0.027), super fast mining halving schedule, and an inflationary model to keep miners mining once the halving schedule was completed.  Dogecoin can support 10X more transactions per second than bitcoin.  We also have implemented AuxPoW, which allows dogecoin to be mined at the same time as any other scrypt coin such as litecoin, which gives us a big hashrate and network security, while having relatively small doge rewards for mining (meaning fewer coins get dumped for fiat by miners, less selling pressure on the coin). The inflationary nature has gotten a lot of criticism from the bitcoin crowd, we produce 5 billion more coins every year after the first 100 billion were mined. But most economists will tell you that a small amount of inflation in an economy is healthy and encourages spending, and deflation can actually be a warning sign for economic trouble and people stopping spending. Bitcoin is more like gold, in that it's a commodity that people hoard, dogecoin tries to be more like a currency that people use.  +/u/dogetipbot 250 doge   /u/changetip 50 bits"

Honestly, depending on how the IRS is going to treat cryptocurrencies, I'd rather have an alternative to Patreon than Kickstarter. I'm just starting to learn game development, and all of the rules and regulations about how I might be taxed as a hobbyist or as someone self-employed depending on factor x and factor y an factor z are so vague and confusing.  If DogeCoin could help simply tax stuff for people who are doing gamedev for fun or as total newbies instead of as game studios, it would help a lot. (e.g. if DogeCoin is treated as passing around a chainsaw to neighbors rather than as gratuity given to a musician or bartender)"

If any of you are interested in doing something with dogecoin in one of your projects I'll be glad to help you get up to speed! Also for those of you who are interested in doing something that requires a web-based backend, you might want to take a look at the Dogecoin PHP-Framework I wrote. It enables you to use dogecoin in your project without the hassle of writing your own accounting system."

I like the idea of first mix tape having no theme at all or maybe having a theme ""Mix"" or ""Tape"" (or both).   I'm not sure if we should have limited slots, but that might be good for the first run. Thus, to keep people from dropping out and actually finishing the games, there should be at least a week of time. Two weeks might also work, since there would be more time to get a word out, gather feedback and don't rush things too much.  By the way, llehsadam, you're a master wizard of organising things.

Not all games will be downloadable, it's very easy to make WebGL, Unity WebPlayer or Flash Games.  Also this would allow you to post links to work in progress versions of your game for feedback.   On Duration: I'm thinking two weekends would be ideal, not too long but long enough to make a Ludum Dare / Game Jam style game and even add a dash of polish to it.  So we can start now!"

A game jam is like a music jam, an indie developer label is like a music label and what we have here is like a street performance with a free mix tape at the end.  The developers jam along in a thread and a passerby can throw a tip if they like what they see and in the end there's a bundle of games to take with you home.  I'm really excited about this!

I'd hazard a guess that it's some sort of stealth platformer, but I'm confused by the sliding-block puzzle look of it.  You probably need multiple screenshots, (maybe with some descriptive text) or better still a video/gif of it in play.  Yes, it does look pretty, though.  EDIT:  I googled the name, and found a video, and yes, it's exactly what I thought it was, so actually, I guess, it presents itself pretty well (although I have no idea whether other people would necessarily ""get"" it so quickly from a still)"

I guess it could be done in a thread directly on reddit over /u/changetip if people are alright with cryptocurrencies.  Reddit allows hundreds of communities to exist where something is sold and the user agreement states that reddit is not intended as a marketplace, but it does not state that it cannot be used as a marketplace. In fact the only think not allowed are illegal substance/services, so that aspect shouldn't be a problem.   I can sticky a thread or something where the mixtape would be sold.

Example: https://itch.io/s/1096/cogswell-college-bundle  I assume that a separate account would have to be created and all games added to it (that would solve a lot of confusion about platforms or game descriptions, although people responsible for account would have quite a bit of work), then a bundle created... and done!   I'm bitter against crypto, since I recently lost a bit of money for believing in them :)"
IndieDev,2xyjan,SnoutUp,2,Thu Mar 5 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, cryptocurrency can be a mess, but if we start with bitcoin and use /u/changetip, it should be very easy to collect the tips in one account and retip them back to the developers all in the reddit comments.  There is a big positive aspect to this because this avenue wasn't explored anymore and I know the bitcoin community is very keen on new ways to utilize the currency.  But it's more about exposure than money. Innovation raises eyebrows.  itch.io is awesome at what it offers indie developers, but it's a platform, I think the idea is to go platformless... to see what that leads to! It's an experiment first."

Reddit Indie Mix Tape or r/IndieDev Mix Tape.  Would be good for the community and would help draw eyes."
IndieDev,2xyjan,llehsadam,3,Thu Mar 5 04:38:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, /r/IndieDev Mix Tape has a good ring to it.  But the idea would definitely require very active participation. Someone would have to organize what games go into the mix tape and how much each developer gets from the profits.  It might even require creating /r/indiedevmixtape where the mix tape would be put together, checked and discussed by the participating developers before it gets posted to /r/indiedev."
IndieDev,2xyjan,llehsadam,1 point,Thu Mar 5 10:40:51 2015 UTC,"Equal shares between games on mix tape?  So would the mixtape be free/donationware or paid?  Themed or limited size so first 32, 64, 128 games ready make it onto the tape?  What is a tape, just a zip file or a reddit page with links?"
IndieDev,2xyjan,llehsadam,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:27:31 2015 UTC,"I gave this some thought.. here's my proposal.  I think 16 would be plenty at first.  In order to be attractive, I think the price should be low and the games should really stand out. Even though this isn't donationware, it's still all about supporting indie developers and raising awareness about this small innovative indie game niche that many people don't know about.  So I see two good options. 16 games for $1 or we let people name their own price. I'd rather let people name their own price.  I thought about how this could be organized. Since this is experimental, it'll be based on the honesty system and we can use reddit as our marketplace at since it is allowed in the user agreement, but if it gets popular, we would create our own website where people can download the game.  I was thinking we could use a system along these lines:    The developers meet up at /r/IndieDevMixTape and prepare the mix tape. The mix tape is a PM to the user with external links to something like Dropbox, the developer's website, etc to download the games.  One of us creates a post on /r/IndieDev and we cross post it to subreddits that want to participate. People use changetip to give how much money they want in the comments, and we send them a PM with the download links. This way it'll be easy for all the devs to add up how much money was made and how much each one should get.   If the idea is popular, we move it to an external website, if it's not, we let it die. I think since it's just 16 games, the website wouldn't really have to be too complicated. It'd just store the games. We give each user a key through a PM that they use to access a mix tape. No accounts, no personal information... just a key and the games.  EDIT: I agree with /u/Arowx that it should be donationware. We should make this as simple as possible."
IndieDev,2xyjan,absolutelyalmost,2,Thu Mar 5 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"What about free/donationware as I think until it takes off it would be more of a potential way to get your work noticed.  And the easier it is to try the better.  Then we can just post the links to the mix tape games on a reddit theme, each dev provides links to either a zip or webpage with a simple indie mix tape logo (e.g. could be hosted on dropbox?!).  That gives the devs the option to upgrade and improve their tracks!  What about setting up a mixtape game jam, internet based lets the participants judge each others work, work to a theme?"
IndieDev,2xyjan,llehsadam,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your idea makes it much simpler to do.  Donationware sounds good. It would make things a lot easier. We just post a link to the download and if people feel like donating, they can do that.  And the game jam idea makes it even simpler and we could tell /r/gamejams about it. We'd just make a thread on here and anyone could join, but that would also probably make the 16, 32, 64 idea too difficult to do. This could be where each developer could post updates to their game later!  I think when the mix tape is presented, the download should be one zip where all the games are stored. It'd make splitting whatever donations the games get seem more fair and just much less stressful. Again, we'd just do it with /u/changetip to make it transparent and keep things simple. But like I said, the devs could post updates to their game individually later as well. The zip would just be a nice way for people to get all the games in one download.  We could do this all under one thread. One comment left by an account we make would serve as the donation collector (like a donation jar) and each developer would post a comment for their game they edit during the gamejam. Then the developers would also have a chance to get a direct donation as well as whatever they got out of the donation jar split."
IndieDev,2xyjan,WriterOfAlicrow,2,Thu Mar 5 20:06:16 2015 UTC,Great idea. I would be up for this when I have something ready. Not sure how you'd handle sorting out the money between each team/dev though. This would also require some marketing itself.
IndieDev,2xyjan,llehsadam,3,Thu Mar 5 13:37:45 2015 UTC,"Ideally it'd be a transparent process, right?  So for example if we used /u/changetip in the comments, we'd see all the transactions, so to see how much money was made we'd add up all the donations and split it between the 16 developers. Everyone would be able to do the math for themselves to double check."
IndieDev,2xyjan,absolutelyalmost,2,Thu Mar 5 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a great idea! Could really help people get noticed.  I'd vote for having themed bundles. Games that share things in common, and are likely to appeal to the same audience.  My game won't be ready for a year or so, but when it is, I'd love to be a part of a bundle. In the meantime, I could try to help get this set up. (Not sure how I can help, but maybe there's something.)"

IndieDev,2xyjan,mike_team17,2,Fri Mar 6 01:59:43 2015 UTC,What duration would people prefer?  What would be too long?  What would be too short?  I'm thinking about four weeks.    Even if you can only spare an hour a day that's 28 hours of game dev and four or even five weekends.
IndieDev,2xyjan,mike_team17,2,Fri Mar 6 04:13:18 2015 UTC,"Hi! I saw this post in r/gamedev, and thought I'd weigh in.  It seems like this is in the ""soliciting ideas"" phase. So I have some questions:  -I use Unity, which means that for me to distribute files I have to either package them into an installer or distribute the source data (not a problem). But that means that the games would almost certainly have to be separately packaged (i.e. no ""Choose your game from this menu and play!), or run a custom installer. Does this matter?  -What quality of game are we aiming for? If we're giving a dev time of 4 weeks, and one of the teams making a game puts in 20 hours total, and one puts in 140, this could cause issues when it comes to revenue-split time. I realize it isn't all about the money, it's about publicity, but it matters. I would like to suggest either very short development times or games based on the theme are chosen by a panel (this can also be very tricky).  -Who, specifically, runs this thing?  I think it's really cool, and it could be awesome to make this gamejam-esque project a reality, but I'm curious about the details."
IndieDev,2xyjan,luxandnox,1 point,Fri Mar 6 04:47:56 2015 UTC,"You're correct in that each game will need to be individually packaged, however that doesn't prevent us from having a launcher or website setup that can be the hub for the mixtape.  Someone mentioned about having a split between small mixtapes and large ones. So that the tipping is a bit more fair."
IndieDev,2xyjan,WriterOfAlicrow,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:41:22 2015 UTC,"Yes we should keep it simple, if each dev provides a link to their game then we can just publish the tape as a list of links.  But what if your bigger game is outshone by a smaller simpler game that then becomes the main draw to the mix?  I think equal shares but each game should have it's own tipping jar.  So stand out games can be recognised and rewarded."
IndieDev,2xyjan,Hectate,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking. If people want to tip the developer, they don't need an individual tip jar. People will just leave a reply to the developer's progress comment that tells /u/changetip or /u/dogetipbot to send the tip. On reddit, there's nothing stopping individual tips.  We should publish the whole thing as one download because that makes it easy to download, but if they wish, the developers would provide a download in their comment and could edit the comment for updates and bug fixes."
IndieDev,2xyjan,llehsadam,2,Fri Mar 6 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"Hey gang,  Just a thought here - Team17 are launching a new website soon with an online store. Maybe we can help you out with a sales platform here? It doesn't cost us anything to run, besides the usual hosting fees (which we pay anyway) and customer support (which would be an issue we'd need to look at) - perhaps we can distribute these mixtapes there.  The benefit for Team17 would be simply more stuff on our store and the reputation gain of supporting indies. The benefit for you guys would be a very reliable, fully featured online store with the brand power of games like Worms, Flockers and The Escapists driving traffic to your bundles.  There's a quagmire of legals to look at around ensuring that you guys get the money, but helping you guys to sell your games totally fits in with our wider mission of upping the ante for indies.

IndieDev,2xyjan,llehsadam,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"I guess that makes sense, since I think most indie developers are making small games like that. But maybe we ought to have some bundles with larger games. So maybe there are bundles of 15 small games, and then occasionally we have one with 5 larger games. (Just making up numbers here). Otherwise we'll be cutting out a lot of good, longer games that need attention."
IndieDev,2xyjan,llehsadam,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:32:22 2015 UTC,"The developers will definitely need to figure out a fair way to split the donation jar then. It's not difficult, but it'll have to be agreed upon in the beginning of each mix tape."
IndieDev,2xyjan,Applzor,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"I think this is a really good idea. It could be done any number of ways... I think Mix Tape has a really distinct retro vibe to it, I think it would be very cool as a consumer to see a ""Mix Tape"" up on a gaming marketplace, pay for it and get just one executable with an old school menu with a list of games to launch.  As a developer it would be nice to network with other devs and it sounds like it could be a healthy competitive environment, to try and be the one who stands out on the mix tape. Plus marketing can be really hard for solo devs so to pool efforts like this would make things a lot easier.  Yeah... I see only positives with this. Great idea. I look forward to seeing if it gains any traction :D"
IndieDev,2xyjan,llehsadam,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:07:21 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... It would be neat to launch them all from a menu like that. Would likely encourage people to try out the other games in the bundle, too.  However... putting them all in one executable would probably be difficult (especially if we have a game using Mono, one using Python, et cetera). What we could do is put them in one archive, and when you extract it, you get the executables (or folders, to make things neater) for each game, and another executable that launches the menu to select a game, and then runs that game's executable. Same effect, but a lot easier to implement."
IndieDev,2xyjan,StoryGameDev,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:51:36 2015 UTC,I have a suggestion/request: Can we please make it immediately apparent which platforms each game supports? (I.e. put the list of platforms directly beneath the title). Having to search through the developer's site just to find out if I can even run the damn game is pretty annoying. Doing that for 16 different games would be even worse.

IndieDev,2xweie,cavey79,3,Wed Mar 4 13:02:05 2015 UTC,"Hey u/biggerplay!  OK - we do prefer PC and console platforms right now, and we're working on building expertise internally on the mobile market.   As for discovery - let's take The Escapists as an example. That game was also made by a lone developer, Chris Davis. He was a roofer and spent 2 years of spare time making the game. You can read more about his story here: http://www.develop-online.net/news/the-escapists-dev-i-m-not-afraid-to-ask-the-community-for-ideas/0203186  The Escapists was kickstarted and Chris raised just over £7K to make the game with. But a major side-effect of the kickstarter was the audience for the game that it started to build - gamers LOVED his background and his idea, and they were the start of what would become an active and passionate community. Getting those first few fans is the hardest part, and Kickstarter is a great way to communicate the ""why"" behind your game and your studio. From there, we worked with Chris to set up social media channels which would become important later. We utilised our PR contacts to get Chris' story out there in the media, and get previews up of the game on major industry press sites. We also shoved it under the noses of YouTube's most popular gamers, who LOVED it and started to make multiple series of videos about the game. Just check this out: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_sort=video_view_count&search_query=the+escapists   We then used our contacts at Steam and Microsoft to get the word out to their fans too. Front page visibility on the Steam store, postings from Xbox's social accounts and major nelson. You get the picture.   As above, getting started is the hardest part. Get those first few fans by making friends with people who influence the gaming community. Use those first few fans to help you reach more and reward them for their support. Show the ""Who"" and ""Why"" behind your game to give credibility and context to the ""what"". Keep building. Stay active and, importantly, stay humble - it's an extremely positive trait amongst indie devs.  As for funding, we can help.

We've worked with people who have never made a game before, and people who have splintered from some of the world's most experienced dev studios, so how we help really depends on what you need from us.  Our vetting process looks at commercial viability first - is your game likely to sell in the current market? Are we likely to get a return on investment (as much as we try not to be a business, we are one!)? Secondly, it looks at how much resource your game will need from our internal teams - can we give you the support that you need in the time frame that you need it?

IndieDev,2xweie,Waynetron,3,Wed Mar 4 16:50:45 2015 UTC,I imagine it can be hard to get users with Steam dominating the PC gaming market. Are you planning on letting your published games onto Steam?

Are you going to help developers getting onto Steam or will they have to go through Steam Greenlight as usual?

IndieDev,2xxsqe,santhu221633,2,Wed Mar 4 19:29:31 2015 UTC,I have a question. How do you go about figuring out if a game is going to be fun for kids (I mean toddlers here)?  Do you just give it to kids and see their reaction?
IndieDev,2xxsqe,llehsadam,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"I am sorry for the later reply, i Had to sleep. See its all about statistic, when i gave it to my friend for first time, he played for 3 minutes and said the kids will like it because you know the idea of finding points on screen which are of same color and closest requires one to be fast and observational. And he also commented that it will be more fun to kids.  So i went to my landladys kid and asked him to play it. Beginning they puzzled with dots on screen but once they knew the mechanics they stated playing continuously level after level, restart after restart especially the multi color mode . So, i then found other kids and they too started liking it. So, thats how i came to conclusion that kids will love it. Even the landlady's son come often to my room and plays on my phone now. Thanks"
IndieDev,2xxsqe,akonwoods,0,Thu Mar 5 04:19:14 2015 UTC,I downloaded the game and my kid likes it. But i am a dev too but i use publishers. try googling self publishing tips. i expect some one else better proficient to provide answers for this. Anyways great game.

Firefox works just fine for me.  Did you ever see the Flash Player request for storage? Perhaps you have blocked Flash Player in chrome (check top right for ""blocked plugin"")? If that fails, please give me your exact version of chrome and OS :)  /u/llehsadam is correct in saying the webplayer has issues. It is highly experimental what I'm doing with the Unity webplayer, I don't think it's ever been done before.

I did indeed have click-to-play for plugins but I allowed all plugins on the page.  I did take a look in the chrome dev-tools to see if something failed to load and it seems like it tried to offer me a download-link for Unity but failed. I do not completely understand this as the plugin said the game was made in Flash, but if it actually was Unity I understand why it didn't work because there is no Unity web player."

IndieDev,2xgg5f,AnsaTransa,1 point,Sun Mar 1 05:53:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty damn excellent combination of game mechanics. It does look like you're well on your way to being done with most things. Although I'd highly you take a step back and work on all things that would add more ""juice"" to the game.  First off sound design, get some better paddle sound. A unique sound that a player can listen to a million times (without feeling dull) goes a long way  Readability is kind of an issue, I couldn't guess the ball's direction after a collision as it would always hit a square object. Is there more than 8 directions that the ball can actually go in? As if it was a free 360 degrees movement it wouldn't hit the edges of the squares as often and it might be understandable with its future direction. This also goes in with your particle effects being the same colour and infront, so it covers up the playing area leaving you blind.  Then also I think you can probably kick up the difficulty a notch or two. With the paddles enlarged (and their default ones too) they do cover too much of the screen making it not really a breakout challenge. Try to figure out maybe more interesting special blocks that change the game mechanics somewhat. Doesn't have to reinvent the wheel, but at least experiment with new ideas  (Those are a lot of negatives, but I think if you solve these you'll have an amazing product on your hands and not just something that the player says ""oh it's indie, I guess I can't expect more"")  Have a great day :)"
IndieDev,2xgg5f,AnsaTransa,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:15:37 2015 UTC,"This is great feedback, thank you for taking the time :)  I will investigate better sounds.  Did you have anything in particular in mind?  The one I'm currently using resembles a metal bat hitting a ball.  Re: readability, I have recently brought on an artist who agrees this is an issue.  We're aiming to include multiple palette themes.  We suspect light on dark background will make it much easier to track movement.  Right now the star can only move in 8 directions, and the diagonals aren't introduced until much later to keep it simple.   There's nothing to predict per se when it comes to where the star turns, since it's 50/50 left or right on collision.   But you are constantly gauging how likely it is to go out of bounds while you try to catch powerups and avoid powerdowns.  There are also starmods (blue circles) that alter the angle it turns e.g. instead of +-90 it becomes +-45 or +-135, or 0 degrees.  I have a few ideas for new powerups to increase the challenge.  Split paddle would put a hole in the middle of any paddle.  Roadblock would prevent you from moving past a certain part of the rail.  Invert controls would flip the angle the paddle spins relative to the mouse.  There's a few others.  For juice I have a few things planned but they're in early stages.  I'm using a beat listener to do things based on what happens in the music.  E.g. the objects thump, spin or change colors.  But I think I need a cool animated background to really take advantage of that."
IndieDev,2xgg5f,AnsaTransa,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"AnsaTransa, I've been working on some things you mentioned.  A few others are still in concept but I'm really excited.    If you'd like to check it out: http://gamejolt.com/games/arcade/starific/37258/  In any case, I hope you're having a wonderful day :)  Oh also if you want to change the color palette, shift+right click cycles it."
IndieDev,2xgg5f,AnsaTransa,1 point,Mon Mar 16 09:04:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, tried it out properly this time aswell.  The game feels better, but I don't think you've gotten the feeling you're intending. It feels like micro management as the paddle cant change the direction (other than 90 degrees). Following of how hard things are to read I spent most of my time only catching upgrades and balls coming out of the playing area. I felt not even remotely in control, as I was doing damage control to the situation over and over. This also becomes a problem when balls go straight through and doesn't hit any nodes, so it just goes back and forth. (I think it just has to be able to move 360 degrees around)  Other than that, I'm loving the color palette. I don't think you should settle for one, as it would be cool if it changed as certain events happened or the difficulty spiked. The game Lethal League does wonders with what it has, as when their ball breaks a certain speed, the colors like inverts and signifies that things have changed.  Also, the frozen paddle seemed to last too long, as the ball just hit paddle, went in again, hit a node and left the court before I could move. And I'm not sure if it was some menacing upgrade, but after 5 minutes in of playing my paddle animation got stale and sluggish. (Happened a bit after I had tried to rotate fast around to try to test if its breakable)"
IndieDev,2xaag8,VLKN,2,Thu Feb 26 22:42:51 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your first iOS game :) I tried out the single player mode it's pretty fun - I had some ideas you could add to it.  Maybe have 'bombs' or other objects falling down the lanes so the player isn't constantly just tapping in one spot? (lowers the bar if tapped)  Also might help to move the pause button to a corner of the screen to prevent accidental tapping? Anything to give a sense of progress (shifting the purple to another color as you get further up in your score).  Looks like you got your SEO figured out, your app showed up first on searching pushpush. (I'm struggling with that on my app)"
