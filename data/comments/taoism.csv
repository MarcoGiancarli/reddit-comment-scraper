taoism,3dyoaw,Cragdor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"My personal experience. I have only been at this for a few years. This is only my personal journey and I'm happy to share with you what I have learned so far. I started by listening to Alan Watts. You can look up his lectures on YouTube and Openculture.com. I enjoy listening to his explanations and he is enjoyable to listen to. I had to listen to some lectures a few times to completely grasp the idea. If you have Spotify, you can browse a neat section called 'Word'. There you can find Eastern Spirituality. I like the Joseph Campbell lectures. All Completely Free!  I also purchased a few books to learn about the culture, origins, and history. Taoism: An Essential Guide by Eva Wong and Confucius: The Analects. I've only read about a third into the Essential Guide which mostly explains the history and developmental stages of Taoism. Interesting enough. Definitely have a highlighter and sticky notes.  How to practice Taoism. From my understanding of Taoism there is this idea of Wu-Wei. Translates to 'Action by non-action'. To give without receiving. The Tao is the natural order of things. The Path. Its the underlying universal natural order. Tao to me means is acting in a way that promotes my well-being and the well-being of others. To inspire others and to help those around me because the natural order of humans is to love one another and ourselves. If you act with this in mind, that I believe is Wu-Wei. Action by non-action. For example, doing something nice for an unsuspecting stranger. It brightens their day and you might have help that person with the kindness of your heart.  You can also practice by focusing on something you are passionate about. A hobby, a goal, or change. Politics, Science, random trivia, or knitting! Because following the Tao also means to follow your passions. Your passions are a self expression of your inner being. Your desire to bring change to the world, to influence the world around you. When you are passionate about something and that something becomes an art. You are experiencing the Tao.  So that's what I understand in a nutshell. Sorry about any grammatical errors. Thank you for allowing me to share with you."

taoism,3dylfm,GaySkull,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"I've been involved in Taoism since I was quite young. Some time ago I was also very involved in martial arts. Among others, I dabbled in Taiji and Bagua.  Yes, the martial art can be a way in, and can help you understand not only conceptually but experientially. This is a very important dimension of practice: to actually cultivate the spirit, to actually change the character, not just think and talk about it.  When people seek understanding, for the most part they are seeking control. They want to know something before they surrender to it. That's not how it works. First you surrender, then the wisdom is revealed in you, through your own life experience.  If you want Tao, then some kind of training is necessary. Martial arts is one way, though the martial art can in many cases skew the teaching, if not usurp it. Do you have the strength and clarity of motivation to always use the martial art to support cultivation of the Tao, rather than the other way around?  If the answer is 'no' or 'maybe', then a training with clearer direction is better.  My Baguazhang teacher was (is) quite accomplished, upstanding, meticulous, and self-possessed. Whatever he taught, he took it upon himself to practice. So he was a good role model and teacher. The practice itself is very profound. I didn't scratch the surface of what it has to offer.  And yet, something was skewed... not clear. As if the central point got a bit lost in the method. It could be my own faults or simply poor chemistry; it could be that the teacher was still finding his own way; but I found much better teaching on actually getting and living the Tao through Zen. Chinese and Korean Zen in particular are still close to their Taoist roots, and can help you to reveal the movement of Tao in your life, not only understand it conceptually."

If you're looking for self-defense, Taiji isn't the best choice. If you're just looking for some kind of ""moving meditation"" Taiji is great, but you might also want to look into Qigong."

taoism,3dsjl3,DangericeMan,4,Sun Jul 19 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"I think it works better in A.C Graham's translation.   Cook Ting was carving an ox for Lord Wen-hui. As his hand slapped, shoulder lunged, foot stamped, knee crooked, with a hiss! with a thud! the brandished blade as it sliced never missed the rhythm, now in time with the Mulberry Forest dance, now with an orchestra playing the Ching-shou.  'Oh, excellent!' said Lord Wen-hui. 'That skill should attain such heights!'  'What your servant cares about is the Way, I have left skill behind me. When I first began to carve oxen,I saw nothing but oxen wherever I looked. Three years more and I never saw an ox as a whole. Nowadays, I am in touch through the daemonic in me, and do not look with the eye. With the senses I know where to stop. The daemonic I desire to run its course. I rely on Heaven's structuring. I carve along the main seams. Let myself be guarded by the main cavities, go by what is inherently so. A ligament or tendon I never touch, not to mention solid bone. A good cook changes his chopper once a year, because he hacks. A common cook changes it once a month because he smashes. Now I have had this chopper for nineteen years and have taken apart several thousand oxen, but the edge is as though it were fresh from the grindstone. At that joint there is an interval. and the chopper's edge has no thickness; it you insert what has no thickness where there is an interval, then, what more could you ask, of course there is ample room to move the edge about. That is why after nineteen years the edge of my chopper is as though it were fresh from the grindstone.  'However, whenever I come to something intricate I see where it will be hard to handle and cautiously prepare myself, my gaze settles on it, action slows down for it. You scarcely see the flick of the chopper - and at one stroke the tangle has been unravelled, as a clod crumbles to the ground. I stand chopper in hand, look proudly round at everyone, dawdle to enjoy the triumph until  I'm quite satisfied then clean the chopper and put it away.'  'Excellent! said Lord Wen-hui. Listening to the words of Cook Ting I have learned from them how to nurture life.'"

In other words, the Dao is also prior to (not temporally or horizontally but rather vertically) the arising of yin and yang, or opposites such as hot and cold as you mentioned. (verse 42 of the DDJ.) Later the Neo-Confucian Zhou Dunyi tried to map this on a diagram, the famous Taijitu.  To truly know the Dao requires one to 'forget oneself and the world' and merge or attain unity with the Dao. This is similar to what the Greeks might call apocatastasis or gnosis, or what variously goes by terms such as enlightenment, etc. The Daoists call such a man who has attained this a zhenren (真人) or immortal (天仙.)"
taoism,3do3au,Vidyaraja,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for this post it is very enjoyable to read.  I can understand how the Dao, as you put it, arises vertically, it makes sense in a way.  Similarly, like a fruit, a combination of two forces, arises in what seems to be out of nothingness, since the center of  the fruit emerges in what appears to be out of nothingness(despite being attached from above, hence the vertically part).  I hope you find this concept interesting as well as much as I have found yours. I would love to hear more from you, thank you."

I can understand how the Dao, as you put it, arises vertically, it makes sense in a way.   By vertically I mean that rather than the Dao producing yin and yang sequentially within time (horizontally), it is a matter of which metaphysically is the source of the other, and since that which is transcendent is beyond time, so in the same way this 'process' isn't one which is temporal.   Actually, sticking with the concept of verticality, it would be better not to say the Dao 'arises vertically' but rather descends vertically, since the more refined aspects of the Dao (rarified qi such as the realms of the gods, heavens, etc.) are above the more coarse qi of the physical, earthly plane we are familiar with, and the ultimate source or ground of all of this reality (the Dao in its Absolute aspect) is above all. This is similar to the Vedic or Hindu concept of the Ashvattha Tree (Brahman) with roots above and branches below or the Western conceptions of the Great Chain of Being."

A few years later it started to come together and now it is really really clear to me, and it's awesome to share it with others who are aware of it.  I found everyone is aware of it, but it's hard to define it with a single word so everyone sees it differently.  At a certain point you will find people who can discuss it in extremely abstract ways, yet it will still make sense.  It seems always to bring joy when discussing it and always seems to revolve around telling the truth, sometimes a truth that is deeper than one's own personal awareness, which makes things interesting.

Anytime you put ""the"" before dao, you're superimposing the indo-european/judeo-christian/aristotilian ""the."" A concept that makes little sense in warring-states China. And when you take the kind of leap your post takes, you're disregarding the worldview these texts came out of. Another important thing to remember is that in Classical Chinese, the word for heart means both heart and mind. So there isn't a distinction between logical thinking and the kind of emotive resonance you're describing.I think its kind of detrimental to read these texts without trying to understand the historical context. They are not static pieces of holy texts, they are words written by people trying to make a better world during an awful point in time."
taoism,3do3au,endless_mic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:53:35 2015 UTC,"Ok this is interesting I guess, but along with this our current society is not dissimilar and in any time there is a warring state and within these times also peace and harmony within individual lives and I think when you come to understand the tao or ""the source of all lives and oneness"" or whatever term you have created to understand the thing that which is the cause of all causes, then you will see why the texts were written.  To me they were written because it is the truth and the truth is very simple.  I think anything written today is similar but if we question which texts actually benefit the world and not make it worse we could say these texts must then be beneificial to humanity and perhaps can be considered taoist since the taoist belief should be that peace and harmony, no matter what perspective they may be written under, is the way of the tao... Along with this the tao cannot be named, we can say the word tao but that is simply a reference to something unspeakable. I do not know the historical context of these texts but I am at least able to understand what they are talking about as I have experienced it in my own ways with my own personal understanding as though there is no difference in time.  It is something that is tangible and physical and real in many ways and can be described and felt in many ways (the tao, or whatever you want it to be named, even though it cannot be named).

The name which can be named is not the eternal name."" - The Daodejing   The tao is what? The Tao is a force, that from which all life is derived.   And so the first thing you do is try and define it.    we divide everything into two forces. The physical, and the non-physical. The Tao lies within the non-physical aspect.   You lost me after that. Ever looked at a Taijitu? As the symbol most commonly associated with Taoism, it represents two halves that together complete wholeness. Duality forming a whole. The Tao doesn't exist within one half and not in the other; the entire diagram is meant to represent the Tao, both halves."
taoism,3dkhqy,lookslikeyoureSOL,0,Fri Jul 17 16:14:22 2015 UTC,"The point is that tao is neither half, and that is why the two are from it.  This only makes sense when you realize the totality of all things, without anything excluded, can be defined as such: It is like how long and short define each other, long and short need not exist, but by the fact of the two existing we find the tao present between both. Therefore we can say that the tao is ever-present, because the tao exists not because of the two (long and short), but the two exist because of the tao, yet without the two, the tao theoretically could be said, not to exist in this paradigm.    The two halves are not wholeness, the wholeness is before and after the two halves.  The two halves do not create wholeness, wholeness is ever-present, and without wholeness, then the two halves would never come into existence.  Ever-presentness is a constant that cannot be changed and it comes before anything else.  Wholeness exists, and that is how everything else was able also to exist.  This is supported in the tao by saying that all things come from the tao."

I've ruined relationships and opportunities simply because of my anger and inability to control it. I know how you feel. I get mad so damn easily, as the most inconvenient times.  Both Taoism and Stoicisim have helped an inexplicable amount in my overcoming of this obstacle in my life. I'll keep it extremely simple, and if you have any questions, I can elaborate.   The Tao, to me, is about being in tune with the nature of the universe, and ones self. Anger is a part of your self. Suppressing that anger and trying to bottle it up is not an option through the Tao, but releasing that anger and not allowing it to cause harm is. You are angry, you can not change that. But, what you can do, is start to see the patterns that both cause your anger, and what you do with it, and make subtle changes within yourself to help this.   ""So much more grievous are the results of anger than the cause of it.""   You can be mad, dude. It's okay, it's who you are. Realizing that is important. Sometimes after a stressful week or day situation, I'll need to release my anger, because if I let it incubate, it'll just cause problems. Find out the root of it, and find ways to exercise it. Meditate, buy a punching bag, go for a run, find a reliable friend to let you vent, etc, etc.  I live with this shit everyday man, and with the right mindset, it DOES get easier.

Various forms of Daoyin (including meditation) other related practices (such as non daoist meditation or bodywork) has helped me with many emotional troubles, anger being one of them but anger is a hard one, just keep doing it and be patient, eventually you will be helped.

You can learn about all the philosophy you want and try to implement them as thoroughly as possible but until the essence change through a practice the best a phosophy will do is change the manner in which the energy is expressed but will not fundamentally change the energy of anger for you.

If you can find a buddhist community they often have meditation classes of very high quality and can often give you guidance.  So first look for a buddhist sangha if there are any (they often teach meditation and buddhism is inclusive while much of it is wise in my view they won't really force you to become a buddhist just because you want to learn meditation from them) and dailing that look for any meditation classes. There are countless of them so see what you can find and then look them up on the internet, read up on their tradition is and judge them yourself. Some traditions can be rather spaced out while others are rooted in more skeptic lines of though, find your own path.  If you want to walk your own way i sugest you just focus on breath at first and stay away from anything fancy in meditation untill you can find guidance, meditation is a great tool but it can mess you up if you do it wont. In general guided meditations are safe aswell if you find recordings of them.  Be aware though that the internet is full of meditation advice that is not worth following or might actually even be bad for you.  Don't hesitate to ask for more help."
taoism,3dfsh5,noctrnalsymphony,2,Thu Jul 16 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"I share many similarities with your story. I too am very angry and I was tired as well. Taoism has helped me a great deal with this. Taoism to me has helped me come to terms with my life. There are certain things you can control and some you can't. Taoism to me is similar to rafting down a river. The more you struggle to move contrary to it (being angry and frustrated with your current situation) the more weary and tired you grow. Taoism has taught me that it is about steering the raft down the river. Don't fight the current cause we can't. You will end up farther than your goal. Align yourself with the Tao as only you can. Taoism is extremely individual. That is why it isn't really an organized religion. In fact it is quite the opposite. But if you can be comfortable navigating the rapids of life, you will be happy. This for me was the hardest thing to overcome. Taoism is a different journey for everyone. But I do recommend looking into it. You will find your path eventually and wander like all of us who have found ours. As for the ambition. I struggle with this as well and have less answers for you. I have turned my ambition toward helping other people but I also want to make enough to be comfortable in the future and raise a family. So to me, money is a necessity. It's what you do with it that decides wether it is helpful or harmful to your journey. Thank you for reading all of this and good luck with your travels.

taoism,3dfsh5,trekio,2,Thu Jul 16 00:54:02 2015 UTC,"There are two questions here.  Re: the anger issues you've been experiencing, I can relate.  I've always had a temper, and there's no silver bullet, no secret handshake, no set of magic words that will make it go away.  It just takes practice letting things go.  I know, easier said than done.  That said, there's a recurrent sentiment expressed in the Daodejing that helps me to recall when I'm angry about something.  Indeed, it's one of those things that first made the text stick out in my mind.  Typically this sentiment comes at the end of a chapter; I'm thinking of chs. 30 and 55 in particular.  It goes like this:   ...all this is against Tao,  and what is against Tao will soon cease to be.   Re: your ""selfishness"", Daoism is actually not anti-self as much as say Buddhism or many other religions (East and West).  You'll find here and there in the primary texts of Daoism (more in Zhuangzi than in the Daodejing) that one ought to minimize the self, but this doesn't mean kill your ambition or your ego.  What it means is don't let that stuff get in the way; sometimes pushing hard is the wrong approach.  Sometimes less is more.  For example, are you like me in that you find that the best ideas come to you when you're not forcing them?  Maybe a brilliant idea for a story, the perfect character, a resolution to a problem, the overcoming of writer's block... these things seem to come out of nowhere.  This doesn't mean slack off and become an inert piece of flotsam moved about by forces outside oneself, but rather, do your work for the sake of the work itself and nothing more, and your work will improve, seemingly from less effort.  From Daodejing ch. 51:   To do your work but to set no store by it,  To be a leader, not a butcher,  This is called hidden Virtue."

Although i find that studying TCM is the most accesible way to study neidan (or rather get an introduciton to it, because it is a vast field) in this modern way and if you're interested in neidan i recommend you atleast stud some TCM.   The Foundations of Chinese Medicine by Giovanni Maciocia (this is the work on TCM that is most used for teaching and it's a really good book on the subject of TCM, it has some basic neidan from the TCM perspective) The Web That Has No Weaver by Ted Kaptchuk (this is a less comprehensive work on TCM but a good introduction if your not going to study TCM)   Academic:  (these books tend to study what is written about neidan in old daoist text, and is therefore a good way to get some insight of what is written in these old text, but they are often not made to explain neidan in itself and is therefor lacking in that area)   Internal Alchemy is a collection of works edited by Livia Kohn and Robin R. Wang which i recommend. The World Upside Down by Issabelle Robinet is worht a read aswell.   Translations   Cultivating the Tao: Taoism and Internal Alchemy by Liu Yiming and Translated by Fabrizio Pregadio (this is a good work on the subject and i recommend it) Awakening to Reality: A Taoist Classic of Internal Alchemy Translated by Fabrizio Pregadio (this is an important work on neidan, but a bit hard to understand unless you've studied Neidan before) Foundations of Internal Alchemy: The Taoist Practice of Neidan by Wang Mu and Translated by Fabrizio Pregadio (this is an interesting work)   Unfortunatly i don't really have time to write a more comprehensive list as of now, and tomorrow i am going away for a trip for two weeks so i won't be able to write more within the coming time. But i am sure others will have good recommendations aswell.  And yes TCM is the easiest path to learn neidan even if you're more interested in the neidan of daoyin, mostly because you will learn terms and basic ""physiology"" which is needed to understand the neidan of daoyin.

The main principle of a Daoist government would be to spread the natural governance by action thru inaction. I do see two relatively simple solutions: First, guiding the immigrants to a more natural location (one might find parallels in the U.S. handling of immigration by founding new homesteads) or second, convincing the immigrants to stay in their more natural place (which might involve attempting to remove the reason for their emigration).  Of course, the old Chinese saying notes that a good official is Confucian at the office and Daoist at home. So multiculturalism is kind of built-in in the mindset - even the idea that someone ""belongs"" to a single religion is a modern one. ""Daoist"" is an old word, but it would mean a Daoist priest, sage etc. - I believe the new construction is something along the lines of ""a person who follows (insert religion here)."""

taoism,3d6zi1,endless_mic,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"Wow.  I have been reading about ""Heaven"" in Chaung Tzu and have been meaning to ask what it refers to exactly.  You answered it."
taoism,3d6zi1,pe0m,2,Tue Jul 14 18:18:57 2015 UTC,"Confucius and Mencius both deal with dao, and the way they talk about it is highly analogous to the way its discussed in the Daodejing. I don't really think you have a problem. I would suggest re-reading the Analects and the Daodejing side by side. I would further suggest reading translations by the same author, so you can see the ways they translate and use the terms you're concerned about. I think if you do that you'll see they are more similar than different."
taoism,3d6zi1,RakeRocter,2,Tue Jul 14 00:49:44 2015 UTC,"Mencius and Zhuang Zi lived at the same time and not too very far apart. They both participated in the same ""think tank,"" but whether or not at the same time is unknown. They never criticized each other.   The main difference between them is that Mencius did not believe in the bell curve. To him, all human beings are biologically determined to have all that is needed to be motivated to be good to other humans. Zhuang Zi believed that some individuals may not be genetically determined to be nice to other humans. They are perhaps what we would call born psychopaths. (He describes one of them by saying, ""He is determined by nature to kill."")  People who came afterwards tried to turn Confucius into a god. Others tried to turn Lao Zi into a religious figure. The history of Daoism is rather murky as to how it emerged out of shamanism and later was in one way absorbed into a religion that involved being possessed by gods, and lots of other strange stuff that has nothing to do with nature and in another way was combined with Buddhism to form Chan Buddhism (AKA Zen in Japan).    The DDJ traces a chain from the Dao to Heaven then to Earth and then to humans. But what exists at a supersensible level and accounts for everything that exists in the universe we can be aware of is named differently by the various philosophers. It can be Dao, it can be Tian (as a kind of god, probably originally either the earliest ancestor of the dynasty or perhaps the name of a sacrifice to that ancestor, same story for Di 帝, emperor or God), it can be Taiji, etc. It's all a matter of how humans create concepts to try to capture and comprehend the universe. The task, the intention, is the same. The language used may be different."

taoism,3d6zi1,user23187425,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:11:03 2015 UTC,"Tian means sky in Chinese, but it has a much higher connotation as it can be compared to what we call God.   Dao means literally the way, but it is explained in the Dao De Jing to be the source of God. There is another important concept, that of Xuan, the obscure/the mister that is the source of all things, including God.  I don't really agree with calling Daoism a religion, but for sure there is a connection between Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism...these are the three ideologies that together shaped Chinese culture and all three are studied by Chinese monks.   Daoism and Confucianism oppose and complement each other in the same way that Yin and Yang do, one can not exist without the other."

The ""zi"" and the end of the name is the ""zi"" at the end of Laozi (Lao T'zu). Its a Chinese character that can mean ""Master."" So Laozi, Whose name was actually Lao Dan, is Master Lao, or because Lao means ""old"", it can mean Old Master. Zhuangzi is the same way. The person redited with writing the Zhuangzi was named Zhuang Zhou, so Zhuangzi means ""Master Zhuang.""  The Zhuangzi is considered one of the ""classics"" of Daoism and is considered to be one of the greatest literary/philosophical works in Chinese history. Its a bit different than the Daodejing, but develops many of the same themes. Its a really funny text once you get into it, but its also really poignant. Worth a read."

taoism,3cl3s4,Meanderingstories,18,Wed Jul 8 19:21:55 2015 UTC,"They were memories of the ancients of the primordial age, and hence these old sages were real if you believe what traditional man believed about deep ancient past (antediluvian age, etc.), which was nearly the opposite to the view of most modern people who tend believe that the deep ancient past was a time of savagery, barbarism, darkness, etc.  In contrast, the teachings of most of traditional civilizations and cultures, including mythologies and religions, spoke of a Golden Age in primordial times, where man's spiritual faculties were far greater than they our in our time (our time was foreseen to be a dark age, the so-called Kali Yuga, etc.) and men essentially ""walked with the gods."" The Hindu doctrine of the yugas, Hesiod's four Ages of Man, memories of the Edenic paradise, etc. are all formulations of this same idea. The ancient Chinese and especially Daoists also shared this view, hence these references in the Laozi and Zhuangzi.  Later Daoists of the Shangqing and Lingbao traditions formulated even more specific doctrines of ages, combining their own beliefs with that the Indian beliefs that were spreading due to arrival of Buddhism. Here they are described in Livia Kohn's ""Daoism Handbook"":  http://imgur.com/WCAnAAP  As to anything surviving of these ancient sages of China, some Daoists believe the Yijing/I-Ching contains of some this primordial wisdom, along with along ancient charts like the He tu and the Lo Shu.

It is only useful for that one thing now, until it is again emptied and cleaned.  An empty bowl is ready not only for any kind of meal, but can be used to hold nuts and bolts for a work project, can receive water for offering to the Buddha, can be used as a ladle for bathing, can be used as a digging tool, can be worn as a hat if you get caught in a hailstorm, and so on and so on.  The not-filled-in thing is full of potential. And if even a 'thing' doesn't yet arise, that is complete functional potential, which is Tao."
taoism,3cgbjf,TheHeartOfTuxes,4,Tue Jul 7 18:51:34 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how something can be useful if it's never used. It has potential, but does it get used? Or is it always supposed to be empty?"
taoism,3cgbjf,TheHeartOfTuxes,25,Tue Jul 7 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest favors you can do for yourself in spiritual pursuits is not to get hung up on language. If you attach to the words you won't be able to understand where they point. But if you relax about the words and concepts you can realize that you already understand the meaning.  You are getting fixated on the words 'empty' and 'use', trying to achieve a summation of the concepts presented. I'd like to suggest that you loosen the desire to grasp the concepts. The gist of the teaching is that as you fill something up it becomes less useful.  You know the saying that if you only have a hammer everything starts to look like a nail? Hands that are full with something have limited functionality, but hands that are empty are available for anything. A mind that clings tightly to a concept doesn't have the agility to see other perspectives and meanings, but a mind that allows unknowing can move freely.  So this teaching is about you, and your mind, and your holding and making.  You are right; there is also no functionality if nothing moves. So the Taoist openhandedness is not fixed or stagnant. It is not stuck in pure unchanging emptiness. The pure thing moves, functions, enters into relationship, performs activities, manifests forms. But it doesn't cling to the forms. Once you eat the chili, you wash the bowl: it is open for another use. This letting-go and cleaning and refreshing happens continuously, so at any moment the Taoist can return to the pure emptiness, the pure, open Tao... and from that place she/he can again function appropriately in the new situation.  This is the practice. It doesn't come by accident or by religious grace, but by doing it: doing the letting go, situation after situation... doing the open unknowing, moment by moment. And in good training, as can happen in close contact with a master, the student learns how the open point (the Tao) moves through her/him, how it functions appropriately in all kinds of life situations.   Someone may have attained the open point without necessarily being strong in the ability to relate and express; so good training is what allows that ability to develop.  If you let go of concepts your mind is more free to understand completely. If you let go of all concepts, the Tao that has always been there can unfold perfectly and boundlessly, because your holding and making mind is no longer in the way. Then the sky is blue, water is wet, when your muscles are tired you take a rest, and when the person facing you needs help you help them: the universe unfolds and functions flawlessly."

taoism,3cgbjf,TheHeartOfTuxes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:49:17 2015 UTC,"You are right; there is also no functionality if nothing moves.   Would a fair follow up be to say that fixed/stagnant openhandedness is just the same as being full? I.e. the hand, rather than being empty and able to accept a variety of new things, is ""full"" of being empty. It cannot accept anything into it because it is set on being empty and thus it is as locked into a single mode as a hand full of a hammer."
taoism,3cgbjf,yukishoko,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:28:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, if someone is attached to emptiness that's a problem; they're stuck. To say 'stagnant openhandedness' would be a circuitous way of saying it; but if it makes sense to you, that's fine. It means that openhandedness is just an idea, not actually put into practice.  It just wouldn't be real openhandedness. Putting it all down is the all-important first step. Always, always. This means you and me too — not just talking about the theoretical application and outcome of putting it all down; you and I have to do it, right now.  Then there are no concepts to try to grasp. Real life appears by itself.  Putting it all down is the same as 100% participation. 100% participation is the same as putting it all down. Stillness is movement, and movement is stillness. This can't be understood through concept; it has to be attained through the experience of putting it all down.  If you want an example of openhandedness, see clouds, or river, or landscape."

The sage, by returning to the mind of the infant, not distinguishing between the good and the not good, re-educates his people to become like children again.""

The interesting part then would be that in saying this the phrase would encapsulate the central conflict of studying dao: studying it seems to make one consider how present Dao is in other people compared to him while forgeting he himself is also a person. And so the Dao can't be known/told/said etc  My take at least."

Also, the Chinese doesn't literally indicate that ""He ... will meet with his death"". But says simply ""敢則殺."" vs ""不敢則活."" Which translating directly with the least interpreting I would say ""to dare leads to death"" vs ""not to dare leads to life"". This doesn't indicate whose death. Perhaps it could be taken as a general comment on violence or forcefulness. There are a couple words for death and the one used here can also mean to murder so the passage could mean that being needlessly daring can lead to unnecessary violence"

taoism,3bahx0,koyon,9,Sat Jun 27 09:45:10 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between past, present and future.  However, no person. Not one, will go through life without the effects of the present altering their future and changing the perspective of their past.  Time heals wounds. Things that may have discomforted you years ago, will no longer seem as painful. Our mind also typically represses memories of events that caused us pain. There are exceptions to this with especially traumatic events.  I like to use the metaphor of people floating in a river, going down stream. The river is our life. We started on a mountaintop and when we reach the ocean, it will be the end of the current life we have and the start of something new.  As we float down the river, we will not always be able to prevent ourselves from hitting rocks. We may brush up against something unseen, causing temporary panic. It may rain especially hard, causing the water level to rise and the current to become stronger. All of these experiences will change how we react to events further down the river. We hit less rocks, we anticipate what may happen when the river conditions change, we will feel something brush up against us. We learn.  We don't always remember each rock we hit, or exactly how it felt when that mysterious sea critter brushed up against our leg. Until we get further down stream, those memories are still vivid until the fear, pain, and panic subside.  I believe, those who follow their own Way, are able to overcome these emotions quicker than others, thus ""settling more comfortably"".  That's just me though."

We like to think life is just a reflection of the outer world when in reality, life is a creation. This has been said many times, but I feel like I have to repeat it. People may read the same text, but they may understand totally different things. The 2nd problem of communication, semantics. Life is then what happens to us while we're busy creating our perfect world. We all want a perfect image of how things should be. We all subconsciously crave for order. We all want order. The problem is, order is never fully in our grasp. That's what keeps us going. As life passes, there are many things that brings dissorder in our lives. Mostly things we focus on. Mostly things we perceive to be valuable to us at that particular time. The greater the gap between our expectations and reality, the harder life will be.  As we grow older, that gap gets smaller. We start to accept life in it's many forms, we come to accept disorder. With that, we bring the opposite into our lives, we bring peace. We let go."

If you are in the zone while on a bike ride, then you're not thinking about cycling or the bicycle: you're just going. If you're in the groove jamming with some bandmates, you're focused on the music and the instrument becomes an extension of yourself. A carpenter feels this way about her/his tools. Getting into flow makes the ego vanish, and with it any conscious distinction between yourself and the rest of the world.  Flow is not the only aspect to being ""with Tao""; there are also chapters in the Tao Te Ching about decision-making, ruling a country, the use of force, and much more. However, I think that falling out of flow (by being self-conscious, overthinking things, anxiety/stress, etc.) is a straightforward example of how one can become less "" with Tao""."

Sure, the Dao is everywhere, and governs all nature, as all nature springs forth from the Dao.   However, in failing to recognize this, we may remove ourselves from experiencing the Dao. In forcing actions, or latching on to labels or how things should be, we can separate ourselves from the Dao.  I'd point to the fact that if the Dao were truly impossible to deviate from, then there would be no use for De. Or, perhaps it might better be stated in that deviating from De might cause one to lose touch with the Dao. Not truly deviate from it, but to lose sight or knowledge of it, and thus lose the wisdom that it brings."

There is no 'you' which is individuated and distinct from the Dao, such that it could deviate, conform or make any decision as to what its relationship to the Dao is. The Dao includes you. Can 'you' deviate from 'you'?   However, what one can choose to follow or deviate from is 'de' (virtue). I see a lot of people talk about ""following the Dao"", which is all well and good, but they should always keep in mind that no one follows the Dao - not the Eternal Dao, anyway. De, on the other hand, can be usefully talked about in terms of following it, or not, and the principles of de are elaborated in the Dao De Jing."

A sage has said that if we try to accord with it, we shall get away from it. But he was not altogether right. For the curious thing is that you cannot get out of accord with it even if you want to; though your thoughts may run into the past or the future they cannot escape the present moment. However far back or forward they try to escape they can never be separated from the moment, for those thoughts are themselves of the moment; just as much as anything else they partake of, and, indeed, are the movement of life which is Dao. You may believe yourself out of harmony with life and its eternal Now; but you cannot be, for you are life and exist now--otherwise you would not be here. Hence the infinite Dao is something which you can neither escape by flight nor catch by pursuit; there is no coming toward it or going away from it; itis, and you are it. So become what you are."""

While two or three musical notes might harmonize together, playing ""all five tones"" would sound dissonant and ""deafen the ear"" (obviously there are more tones in western music, but this is not important, as many things in Daoist understanding are put into categories of fives, corresponding to the five elements or 'processes'). The same would be true of painting with all colors at once, or cooking a dish with every spice in your kitchen. ""Know when to stop."" Nothing too much.   Every pursuit of mankind saps him of his energy. One might strive to accrue wealth, but the more one has, the harder it is to keep, or to put to use. A wise man is content to keep his belly full, not continuing to madden the mind by continuing to hunt, strive or attain wealth beyond what is needed. Just as the DDJ advises a ruler to keep his people fed and not concern himself with their dealings beyond this, a wise man directs his personage the same way: He keeps himself fed and discards any extraneous desires."

For the belly means the ""tao"" or your own body, instead of your mind. Discards one and takes the other; one = your world,""five senses"", the other = Tao. Taking Tao means you realize true you are Tao, and your world, body, and mind are part of the illusion and what you see in front of you.
