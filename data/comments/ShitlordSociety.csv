I went to a decent college, and even there where people are creating their successful futures, the victim complex was rampant. Some common complaints:   X class is too hard   I just watched you get shitfaced all weekend, maybe if you put more effort into your studies...   Tuition is too high   College is optional. It's also a trade off. Go into debt now, get a better job later and easily pay it off.    But what if I can't get a job!   Then you probably made a uninformed decision choosing your major. cough art, liberal arts cough Pick the right field and become great at your work, and employers will suck your dick.   X professor doesn't care / screwed me over?   Then talk to them directly! Teachers aren't here to try to impede or screw you over, fuck your victim complex. I'll always ask if the person has brought the issue to the teacher directly, and the answer is always no! I've heard excuses like the teacher's office hours are on days you're not normally on campus, or would inconvenience you. Bullshit excuses.    I'm a firm believer in that planning ahead, doing your research before making decisions, putting in hard work and actual effort will pay off. I spend countless hours of my own time getting better at the skills I need for my specific field, and it's paid off over and over. Less than 10% of what I know I learned through formal education. 10%.  Everyone (barring abusive households... different story there) is raised with their parent(s) telling them how special they are, and how smart they are. I don't think this is a bad thing, as it builds a basic level of confidence. But it can also build entitlement, which causes all sorts of stupidity.  /rant"

I am going to applaud their effort and try to teach them to see victories as a result of hard work...not a natural outcome because of who they naturally are as a person.  I grew up in a blue collar family, so I was always pushed to work hard.  Some days I absolutely hated it because it seemed like there was never a moment to celebrate a victory...it was just on to the next thing that had to be done.  Now, I see so many of the friends I grew up with who were always told ""oh, you're so smart/talented/etc."", and now these people are wondering where their high paying jobs are.  They just seem to feel naturally entitled to success without effort because they have always just believed the bullshit that they would achieve highly without attention to effort."

ShitlordSociety,3a1noc,__vor__,0,Tue Jun 16 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"structural unemployment    What makes you think that because your experience or training is in one field, you can never work in another field? Any job is better than being a leech on society. I work in tech and if the industry collapses I would have no problem going back to stocking shelves or waiting tables. Go outside, go downtown, visit another state or travel across a few. Help Wanted signs are everywhere, yet people who believe they are destined for better are unwilling to start a low paying or inglorious job. Your opinion is that of someone who is pampered and believes themselves better than jobs like these.   commodification of education   What's the problem here? If you want the best, you must be willing to work or pay for it; this concept is as old as time. There are other countries with varying levels of ""free"" education, and yet the most skilled and sought after workers still come from America. You also confuse general education (highschool and below) with specialized education (college). A government simply cannot afford to offer specialized education; there are simply too many fields requiring deep knowledge. Again, your opinion seems to be that of someone that believes everything should be given to them."
ShitlordSociety,3a1noc,mhl67,-1,Tue Jun 16 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"Because virtually no unemployment is voluntary. It's almost entirely due to the fact that there aren't enough jobs available. There's also the problem that most new jobs that are being created are low-paying, unskilled, and part-time. My opinion is that left to it's own devices, the market will lead to a mostly impoverished, underemployed populace. That's without even considering the larger economic instability this causes.  Let the state pay for it. The government is perfectly capable of doing so, but they don't want to cut into the profits of their corporate masters. As it is, pay-for education is literally a regressive form of taxation because it shifts the burden of debt onto those least able to pay for it."

That, and there wasn't, and never will be, an ""opposing view"" that is worth the space it occupies in the comment section, because they were just arguing that water isn't wet.   their position didn't stand up to logical argument.   See a certain subreddit whose name begins with fat and ends with logic and I think you'll understand why people who claim that their opposing views are ""logical arguments"" are instantly banned.  They're both fat and stupid.  We created FPH to escape fatness and stupidity pervasive on the rest of the internet and sadly, real life."
ShitlordSociety,39eq7r,teckreddit,-2,Tue Jun 16 13:29:46 2015 UTC,You will never escape stupidity until you stop viewing the world through a lense of entitlement.

ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,ijustdontlikefatties,4,Thu Jun 11 01:01:40 2015 UTC,Thanks bb means a lot
ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,BasicGymBro,10,Thu Jun 11 23:09:28 2015 UTC,"This mass shadowban rush is the most asinine part of the situation. Way to kill any credibility you might've had, reddit. Fuckin SJW's taking everything over."
ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,Klaxonwang,8,Thu Jun 11 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it might have been smoothed over but them banning all alt subs lost hem anything they had left."
ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,BasicGymBro,12,Thu Jun 11 03:06:41 2015 UTC,Its beyond banning alt subs; they are essentially disabling individual users accounts.  All mods of fph and prominent users; their accounts are dead. Thats a step above killing the spinoff subs.
ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,Klaxonwang,14,Thu Jun 11 03:14:10 2015 UTC,Way beyond. Sigh. We're so scattered now. I miss our little sub. My shiny verification and our great mods.
ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,SexyNugs,2,Thu Jun 11 03:15:55 2015 UTC,Fr as soon as voats back up I'm going there fuck reddit
ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,Ninja-Kiwi,4,Sat Jun 13 23:39:46 2015 UTC,bruh they ain't ever gonna get us

ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,bukowskis_bluebird,3,Sat Jun 13 23:54:44 2015 UTC,Its like Tumblr won the battle. But they shall not win the war!
ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,shitlordcaligula,5,Thu Jun 11 04:42:58 2015 UTC,"I always wondered what happened to ninjakiwi.  he was, truly, the best mod aside from cantdoxmyalt.  I'd be happy to do my shitlording here if y'all will have me."
ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,shitlordcaligula,3,Thu Jun 11 02:29:31 2015 UTC,I have always been the best

ShitlordSociety,39d9gg,Trollioo,2,Thu Jun 11 03:25:55 2015 UTC,FPH.io may become our new home. It certainly looks like it can.

ShitlordSociety,329jlh,Ninja-Kiwi,7,Sat Apr 11 20:32:04 2015 UTC,This is what reddit has become
ShitlordSociety,329jlh,Keep_it_legal,5,Sat Jun 13 00:09:02 2015 UTC,The fact they think you need a fedora to be a neck beard is so silly. That's like thinking you need a shitty hair style to be a leg beard. It's all about personality and how they present themselves.
ShitlordSociety,329jlh,DeadLiftingPrincess,3,Fri Jun 12 14:27:09 2015 UTC,"Aw, you hurt their fee fees."
ShitlordSociety,329jlh,TattooedWife,2,Sun Apr 12 19:11:04 2015 UTC,Better call a wambulance.

ShitlordSociety,31qtao,code_guerilla,2,Tue Apr 7 14:34:22 2015 UTC,She's a whalerus!

ShitlordSociety,31ohbr,taytaymacrae,2,Tue Apr 14 11:11:49 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the question... Obv I realize this fat bish isn't full of water weight, but 300 gallons of water over 6 years doesn't seem unreasonable... It's less than 1 gallon per week, which is below the recommended daily water intake."
