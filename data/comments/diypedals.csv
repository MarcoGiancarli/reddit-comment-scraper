diypedals,3e47zi,trampled_empire,4,Wed Jul 22 00:30:38 2015 UTC,"How would I go about stopping the signal from one output going back up the output of the other?   With a summing junction of some sort. The simplest of those for a beginner is an inverting opamp stage with two input resistors (a mixer without controls, IOW): it brute-forces the problem solved and gives the output a decently low impedance.   Regardless, you'll want to capacitively isolate the two effect outputs because otherwise your LM386 stage is going to upset the DC conditions in your AC128s stage.  e: You might find that your tone-control networks are swamping out your JFET source-follower's drive and interacting. In that case, I suggest inserting a noninverting opamp buffer stage between the JFET and the network pots (again, with capacitive isolation coming and going). Both single and dual opamps come in 8-pin miniDIP packages, so, depending on the opamp used (TL082 is my current jellybean goto for that) the second opamp is free anyway."

diypedals,3dtxgh,dxinteractive,4,Sun Jul 19 15:21:14 2015 UTC,"this will depend on your supply. any transients in the supply can damage components.  Depending on your application, the value can be small or large.  For a standard pedal build, 9V, less than 100mA of power usage, you can get away with around 0.1uF, but you could also use 100uF if you wanted.  That said, you can absolutely go to big on the filtering cap.  Big caps can be dangerous, make sure they are rated for at least twice the voltages you expect to work with.  Also for the power supply filtering capacitor, sitck with electrolytic and avoid ceramic.  Make sure you have the polarity correct.  and if your circuit has any ICs (op-amps, amps, 555, etc...), you want either a .1uF or 1uF cap as close as you can possibly get it to the physical IC itself between the IC's power rail and ground.  These can be ceramic and will greatly reduce the amount of noise that your circuit generates.  This is rarely done in homemade projects but I would highly suggest it."
diypedals,3dtxgh,coghex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:49:01 2015 UTC,"I've never seen caps used across op-amps power rails before in any schematics, that's interesting.

I've only ever done the cap-across-the-IC-power-pins trick for PICs / microcontrollers for obvious reasons."
diypedals,3dtxgh,naazrael,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:49:32 2015 UTC,"your op amp supply will determine the distortion characteristics of your signal, since the clipping will occur at different levels if the supply is not constant.  The length of wire between the main power supply cap and the op-amp is long enough to experience RF interference.  A cap is not necessary in most op-amp projects, but for audio applications, it is what I would recommend.  It has the added bonus of protecting your op-amp's from quick overvoltage across the rails.  The thing is, the kinds of caps im talking about are not necessary at all, even on your MCUs.  They make for a very clean signal path, and if you follow best practices for these sorts of things, your pedals will not be fuzzy or staticy."

diypedals,3dtxgh,CompuFart,2,Mon Jul 20 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"By what mechanism? If you place a 100nF cap parallel to a 10uF one, you just have a total capacitance of 10.1uF. I'd imagine the tolerance on most caps is beyond 1%."
diypedals,3dtxgh,naazrael,2,Mon Jul 20 03:07:03 2015 UTC,"The large electrolytic caps can have a relatively large equivalent series resistance (ESR), setting a floor on their high-frequency filtering capability.

Film caps are generally 1nF to 1000nF in 50V-100V with a 5mm lead spacing and are not polarized. Ceramic caps are usually <= 1000pF with a 2.5mm or 5mm and are not polarized.

diypedals,3din5b,abskee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:19:38 2015 UTC,"It's nuts to pay that, but I can see how it get's that expensive. It's a real problem for repair places fixing stuff that only costs $50-100 new.   That's sort of a funny shaped potentiometer, the leads face the same direction as the shaft, so it might not be something they carry unless they deal with pedals a lot, which they probably don't because they cost too much to repair compared to a new one. If they don't have it, they can have someone search all over for it (takes time) or just order one from OCD, who is going to charge $5 for it because they aren't in the parts business, so it costs real money to ship even one part, plus a few dollars for shipping, it might cost $10 just to get the part, plus someone has to spend 15 minutes on the phone with ODC. Once you get it a tech has to replace it, the tech makes at least $25 an hour, plus taxes and workers comp, and it might be 30 minutes all in taking it apart, cleanly removing the old one, testing it, etc. On top of that you have to pay your other employees who aren't techs, cover costs of mistakes in repairs, pay for equipment, rent, business tax, etc. and hopefully have a profitable company at the end of the day.   I agree, $80 is nuts to pay for something simple like this, but that might really be the cheapest they could do it for when you account for everything. That's why for stuff like this it's better to just ask around for someone who knows how to solder and wants a 6-pack of (root) beer."

diypedals,3dhhul,AC_CHI,2,Thu Jul 16 12:40:41 2015 UTC,Google shows me that it is a PCB mount toggle. So you'll have to have a pretty fine soldering tip and a de-solder pump to remove the broken switch. From what I can see it is a DPDT (on-off-on) switch.  Get some rosin core solder 60/40 (.031 inch diameter) drop the new switch in and solder it in place.  Hope that helps.
diypedals,3dhhul,Ebethron,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"Hey, I had the exact same problem. By pulling the switch out/desoldering it you will basically just eliminate the top-boost circuit.

When you place components onto the veroboard, you do so with the copper side facing down ... which means if you flip the board (copper side up) to cut the copper, don't cut the board in the same pattern as the layout. You need to mirror the layout. If you did the cuts exactly like the layout, the cuts won't be in the right place when you flip the board back over and start adding components."

diypedals,3cy363,pervyinthepark,5,Sat Jul 11 20:39:06 2015 UTC,"""Ramping up"" tends to imply a voltage change in time. I'm guessing you are instead referring to pedals that use a higher voltage than is supplied to them?  Some pedals simply use an 18VDC wall wart. However, for more exotic power supplies (±15VDC or similar), either a step-up transformer (bulky) or a SMPS supply (much easier to fit in a pedal) are used. To be brief, there are switching power supply topologies that allow boost conversion (going from a lower DC voltage to a higher DC voltage) or inversion. This makes it trivial to take 9VDC and convert it to ±15VDC or similar.  In the case of the Theta, the power input is 9VAC. It is likely rectified and then run through a step-up and inverting stage."

Linear makes a lot of very neat ICs that can even do stuff like create ±15V from a 5V supply.  However, if you're not up for switching regulator design (admittedly, it can be formidable), then there are some pre-assembled modules that provide DC regulation from various manufacturers. Search Digikey for these.  As mentioned below, you can also use simple circuits built around switched capacitor boost/inverters (the venerable 660, from many manufacturers, is popular and easy to find). However, these are limited to small currents and typically have lots of switching noise at lower frequencies."

diypedals,3ch7sr,lucygirlz,4,Tue Jul 7 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"I see lots of cold joints.  The solder needs to wet both the pad and the lead, instead of just sitting next to it.  Make sure you're heating the part lead+pad enough before applying solder, and melt the solder against the lead instead of the iron.  Get some liquid flux, it helps tremendously.   Also be sure to keep the part immobile until the solder freezes, if it moves during that process it screws with the crystal structure and can also result in a layer of oxide inside the joint. And trim the leads a bit shorter to help prevent short circuits."
diypedals,3ch7sr,SauceOnTheBrain,3,Wed Jul 8 16:26:07 2015 UTC,Looks like it. The solder joint to the output tip isn't very strong.

I still always use insulating tape in all the stuff I build to make absolutely sure nothing shorts out. So in the situation where that tang might come close to the metal of the enclosure, I will lay down some tape underneath it on the enclosure itself. I often insulate the backs of all the pots as well.  You would be suprised how much stuff inside a FX box can move around over time if it is not well secured etc."
diypedals,3bxfl8,DuctTapeRiot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe I am not understanding you, but OP definitely does not want to heatshrink (tubing) the tip/signal tang (the long metal piece coming up the middle).   Maybe I was a bit unclear. You're right, you definitely wouldn't want to heat shrink that entire piece of metal. But the only section likely to contact the enclosure is the straight outside edge, which does not come into contact with the 1/4"" jack. So heatshrinking the outer portion will prevent electrical contact from the enclosure, while leaving the section that contacts the jack unaffected.  If I'm still not clear, I can draw a little diagram when I get back to my computer. On mobile at the moment."

diypedals,3bxfl8,DuctTapeRiot,2,Thu Jul 2 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"You want to be somewhat cautious about how you create all your ground connections. Yes you absolutely want the enclosure connected to your ground plane so it acts essentially as a mini faraday cage, pulling RF and other noise to ground.  But you really want to make sure it (and everything else) is only connected to ground at one point.  This is to avoid creating ground loops (multiple paths to ground).  Have a look at ""star grounding"" schemes.  There will be tons of info on this on the Madbean, BYOC and other forums."

Many times an investment in a tool upgrade or purchase for something you would use all the time is the best thing you could do if you have a bit of extra cash.  For instance if you are using a crappy unregulated iron and upgraded to a temp controlled soldering iron like the Hakko 888 you would upgrade your soldering productivity manyfold and also have a tool for life.  Just an example.  If you want parts for the bin that will always be useful:   DC power jacks (2.5 or 2.1mm) 9V batt clips. Metal film resistor 1/8w or 1/4w giant assortment kit (dealextreme is a great place for giant parts bundles like this if you can wait for the shipment from China) Note I would avoid getting electrolytic caps from any place but a reputable one, and buy name brands (don't go crazy with boutiques, just get a brand that is made in Japan) 1/4"" jacks 8pin sockets standoffs LED assortments  jellybean transistors (2n3904/4401/5401, BC546/547/549, 2SC1815,etc)  Try and get one set of each: small signal, low noise, high voltage, and high gain.  If you have one in each of those catagories then you can pretty much swap in as needed for any basic circuit you find   Places to buy from:  Surplus/Connectors/Random discrete components:   Allelectronics (great for connectors) Electronic Goldmine (watch out for shipping here) BGMicro (easy to get lost in this site for hours) MPJA (great for random power supplies )   Cheap chinese parts (good for bulk purchasing of bulletproof items like resistors and leds)   Dealextreme Various amazon marketplace sellers Ebay   New parts, critical components, and things you care about:   Digikey Mouser   Have fun."

Personally, I like to chop the giant cable assembly off the end of old computer power supplies and use that for anything requiring 18/20ga since it a) has a nice variety of colors b) is free  For 22+ ga old ethernet cables and usb cables (buy the giant tangled bundles by the rubbermaid container load from the thrifty), or for signal wires the front panel usb/3.5"" connectors on old computer cases has a nice dual channel shielded with cable female pin connectors on the end.

Im in the uk btw so buying that would be super expensive to ship to me. Im used to soldering on strip boards anyway.

diypedals,3bm24z,SnoopyM,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:51:38 2015 UTC,some people ground the 2nd plug through the enclosure.  Personally I always ground both jacks.  On his schematic he did not ground the output jack.  usually the led you connect and disconnect the ground from the switch.  You just run your 9 volt power to a resistor and then the positive leg of the led offborad wiring  I do not like the way he wires the switch on your schematic.  It works but it does not ground the effects signal when bypassed.

I thought about rehousing a vd300, but with components, a madbean analog delay pedalboard and it's enclosure, would end up cheaper.  If you want to go about doing it, try using a 125b enclosure.

diypedals,3bk3w1,sherminator19,3,Mon Jun 29 22:45:43 2015 UTC,Rehousing it in a boss box my be possible but the PCB would have to be either the exact same size as a boss PCB or smaller and not obstruct the screws for the back panel. Also I don't think the switch used in a behringer pedal will fit in a boss pedal but I could be wrong.

The two switches on the left are tap tempo (with flashing LED) and a solo boost. The other 7 act like preset switches. The patch I'm using has a Fender clean sound and a load of virtual pedals, so the switches act a bit like a programmable true bypass looper by sending multiple MIDI CC messages to control the various pedals. You can go from a clean chorus sound to a screaming-delay-and-reverb-soaked lead sound by pressing one button instead of having to tap dance!"

diypedals,3aynkw,BurningCircus,6,Wed Jun 24 17:11:56 2015 UTC,MIDI only actually uses 3 pins so a normal stereo jack was fine for that.

Are you planning on modifying a pedal you already have or building one from scratch?  In your case, XLR is a 'balanced' connection, TS guitar jack is 'unbalanced'. The difference (essentially) is balanced uses two wires for the signal, and a separate one for ground, and TS uses one wire for signal, and one for ground. So it's not as simple as just putting a different plug on there, since you have another wire to deal with.  Any guitar pedal is going to be designed for an unbalanced signal, so you'll need to convert balanced to unbalanced, then unbalanced back into balanced to go into your PA or whatever.  You can just connect one of the signal wires in the XLR to ground, making it an unbalanced signal, but your signal quality (from the mic) is hurt in the process.  Read more about balanced and unbalanced audio, and look into specifically what you want to build. There are simple enough circuits to convert balanced to unbalanced and vice versa, but you'll probably need help understanding how they fit into your pedal circuit."
diypedals,3aycmv,abskee,5,Wed Jun 24 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"Adding some info so OP understands why the distinction of balanced vs unbalanced is important, because it's not as simple as running the same signal down an extra line.   The two 'leads' in a balanced signal are 180 degrees out of phase coming out of a microphone; the phase on one of the leads is flipped when it hits a mic preamp which puts them in phase with one another.  OP, what you will have to do is build a circuit that flips the phase on one of your leads, then combines it with the other, then runs it through your effect. On the output, you will have to do the reverse: splits the signal into two paths, then flips the phase on the same lead you had previously flipped."
diypedals,3aycmv,porcubot,4,Wed Jun 24 17:01:40 2015 UTC,"To clarify, there is no phase difference. The signal is inverted. It's important to make this differentiation because otherwise the concept of balanced audio wouldn't work."
diypedals,3aycmv,Spaceshipable,2,Thu Jun 25 00:58:51 2015 UTC,"To be even more clear, the second line does not even need to carry a signal. Balanced lines are about noise, not signal (in a way). Both lines pick up the same noise, you then invert one line so the noise is inverted, add the 2 lines together to cancel the noise and you get your signal out whether the second line carried it or not.  If you choose to send the signal on the second line (as is commonly done), then you must invert it before sending so that when the receiver inverts it, it is the same polarity as the first line and will not cancel your signal. If you want to save a few bucks then just don't send the signal on the second line and you don't need that inverter stage on your sender but you will always need an inverter in the receiver."
diypedals,3aycmv,one_who_thinks,2,Thu Jun 25 03:10:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying that, it's a good point.

I feel like the real challenge would be splitting the signal after processing. Would you have to create an extra copy of the effect circuit and run one of the signals into each circuit? Then it wouldn't be a problem to ""separate"" the two signals: each one has passed through its own independent circuit. But then you've doubled the size of your total circuit..."
diypedals,3aycmv,dc880610,2,Wed Jun 24 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"No, what you'd do is convert the balanced to unbalanced before it hits the effect with a differential amp or something (simple op-amp circuit), then you only have one signal going through, like the effect expects. And after the effect you take the affected signal and make an inverted copy of it. An inverting op-amp would do it, there are plenty of other ways too."
diypedals,3aycmv,abskee,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:50:36 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't a signal plus a copy phase-shifted by 180 degrees cancel out to zero when you combine them and send them into the circuit?   after the effect you take the affected signal and make an inverted copy of it.   Since you put the original signal plus a phase-shifted copy into the input of the circuit, wouldn't the output contain the output of the original plus the output of the phase-shifted copy? And wouldn't shifting that entire thing by 180 degrees yield the original shifted by 180 degrees (which is what you want), plus the part that was initially shifted by 180 degrees (which would then become shifted by 360 degrees)? So, you'd essentially be introducing the non-phase-shifted signal into the line that's supposed to contain only the phase-shifted signal.  Sorry if you don't follow what I'm trying to say. This is all awfully hard to communicate without writing out some equations..."
diypedals,3aycmv,dc880610,2,Wed Jun 24 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize what you were responding to so my answer was kinda tangential to what you were talking about. Oops.  You can only put one signal into the effect, not two. And it's not really a phase shifted copy like you might use in telecommunications*, where they can both exist together, it's just the inverse, so when you add them together you get zero.  Say your 'Hot' signal is +5, then your 'Cold' would be -5 (ideally). They're inverse of each other, but their in the same plane, so when you add them, you're really adding them, and you get zero no matter what*. What you want to do is get a signal that's the difference between them, which is +10, then you have a single signal that's just double what the old individual ones were, you send that through the effect just like a guitar signal and the effect can't tell the difference.  Once you're out of the effect you need to take your one signal and make an inverse copy of it, so you're back to a balanced (hot, cold, ground) signal 'package' if you will.  You can also do this whole balanced-unbalanced conversion on just one side if you want, that's basically what a DI is (converts unbalanced to balanced so you can have a longer cable run with low noise, or a mic input on a mixer (which would convert balanced just the same to go into the EQ, fader, amp, etc.)  The reason you do it how I'm suggesting is noise. If your signal should be +10, and you run it on a cable that gets you +1 of noise, you end up with +11, which is wrong, but you don't have a way of knowing what's your noise and what's signal. If you instead start with +5 and -5, and your cable adds +1 of noise, you have +6 and -4, so you take the difference between them and end up with +10 again. Using a differential signal (where you only care about the difference between the two signals) helps wipe out a lot of noise, because it's common to both wires.  *In telecom, you might have a signal that's +5 and another that's -5i (the imaginary number, square root of negative one, often called j in electronics because i means current); in that case you can add them and both still 'exist', the number is 5-5i. But that only works if you have an imaginary component. And now we've exhausted all I remember about communication systems."

If he's planning on running his vocal mic straight into this pedal, he'll be sending mic level to an input that wants line level. In other words, he won't get anything. In this case, he would also have to build a mic preamp into the enclosure that gets the mic signal up to line level so it can be processed correctly. It would at least double the build complexity."
diypedals,3aycmv,BurningCircus,2,Wed Jun 24 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, most pedals should be fine. Guitar isn't really 'line level', it's kinda inbetween. Pedals have to be able to take a single-coil Fender (around 100mV) and whatever super-hot humbuckers you have on your shredder guitar (easily 1V), the signal you get off a vocal mic is about in that range. You'd just need to play around with controls on the pedal.  Or, since you have to put a differential amp in front of it anyway to go from balanced to unbalanced, you can easily add some gain in there."

Does anyone have an XLR pedal layout or something to get me started? I am a visual learner  I understand that I need to go from balanced to unbalanced and back again but what are the logistics? Does impedance come into play? Could any of this be simplified by using an external DI before and/or after?  Are there any DIY vocal pedals that I wouldn't have to do any modding to make XLR friendly? It could be nice to ease into it with an already designed balanced circuit
diypedals,3aycmv,abskee,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:29:00 2015 UTC,"Look up circuits for a DI for the output and an instrumentation amp or differential amp (likely the first section of a mic preamp) for the input.

You don't want to do any design work on it or dial in a pedal with it.  I use a Hot Rod Deluxe as my bench amp. This is the biggest amp I own, and I rarely take it out of the house.  I have a 5W I built that I use for small gigs and an Imperial that I use for bigger gigs. These are GREAT sounding amps and consequently will usually make whatever I plug into them sound really good, so I could be really lazy about the design if I use them. The HRD makes me work a little harder to get a better sounding pedal.  Why do I use the HRD if I have these smaller amps? Because I know it'll be completely clean at a conversational or acoustic guitar level of volume. It's got a second channel if I want to hear it through a master volume amp. It's got a mids knob. It's got an effects loop. It's the most popular amp on the planet. It covers almost every contingency, has massive headroom, and doesn't hide the pedal's flaws.  If you use a tiny solid state practice or headphone amp like the Noisy Cricket or Ruby etc. or some other really small amp, or something with like a 6"" speaker, you aren't getting much above a whisper before it distorts. They'll often sound darker than a real amp, but at the same time will produce weird upper harmonics, so you might make the pedal way too shrill or have no idea what the treble content is doing. The speaker will probably be small and will give you an incomplete impression of the bass response of the pedal -- you might have to take out too much of the bass to keep from rattling a tiny speaker, or you might add too much bass because the amp's not reproducing it, leading to a boomy sounding pedal.  A smaller amp is useful, however, for hearing what a pedal like a boost sounds like when pushing an amp without hurting your ears. But you still need to know what that sounds like through single-ended and push-pull amps, and for push pull you aren't saving your ears no matter how you slice it, because even 12W (deluxe) is still really frigging loud."

He also might have an extra grommet to send you.  Also, not every wah pot has a special taper. Some people don't like the ICAR and a lot of crybabies just use a linear, which is part of why they have a lot of action at the heel end, unlike Voxes, which tended to have a milder sweep (because the ICAR has very little taper through the center).  What it'd be MORE worried about is the fact that you don't get the entire sweep of the pot even with an extended gear shaft like some people sell. Your expression pedal is only going to be limited to maybe 4/5 of the full sweep of the pot, maybe a little less (I'm estimating a 10K loss on both sides).  You might be able to engineer an optical solution. Anderton had a scratch wah pot fix using an LDR; you could use the same pot to control two sets of LDRs, one for the wah circuit and the other for the expression pedal, but this seems way more complicated than what I think is the better solution:  Put your wah and an expression pedal right next to each other on the board so you can put your foot on both treadles at once."

However, if you want to switch between functions and If you don't mind the expression pedal having a weird taper, you can do this without using a second pot. Here's how!   You just have to install a DPDT toggle switch in the side that changes what wires go to the leads of the pot. The ground of the pot stays the same so you only need to toggle 2. Use a 3PDT toggle switch if you'd like an LED mode indicator.   In Vox and Dunlop wahs (can't speak for others) there are wires from the main circuit board to the pot circuit board. Figure out which ones go to which lead, specifically, which one goes to the pot input (ie, lug 3 in most denotations) and which goes to lug 2, the output.   Snip these two wires (maybe put masking tape on each of the snipped ends of one so you can keep track of which wire connects to which). Now, solder the snipped ends of the wires that are still connected to the pot/pot pcb to the center two lugs of the DPDT switch. (This might be an obvious note, but by God don't you dare solder them to each other. I will turn this car right around if you do.)   Now, take the other two snipped ends and solder them to the appropriate lugs on one side of the DPDT, so that when the switch is flipped to one side, the wires are connected as normal.   Now, It's been a while so I can't remember how an expression pedal is wired, and don't want to give you misleading advice, so look up a wiring diagram and connect the leads of your expression pedal circuit to the appropriate lugs of the DPDT so that when the switch is the other way, the pot acts on the expression pedal circuit rather than the wah circuit.   You might need a second DPDT to control what goes to the output, and probably need to use a 3PDT stomp. If you don't mind keeping the buffer in your wah, using a 3pdt stomp will give you two extra switches to work with and you probably won't even need an extra toggle. That's what I did on my Vox Wah.

If it's stranded, and for the most part it should be, twist it a little. Thread the stripped wire halfway through the hole and bend it back so it's touching itself, then solder. One of the main tricks is to have the wire in position so that you don't need pressure from the iron to keep it in place. You're welding, you shouldn't be moving anything when you apply the solder. If you ever have to remove it, getting the solder hot and pulling it is usually enough."

You can probably build one with the parts for a fuzz pedal, just restructure them to avoid clipping. Run a hot signal into it and see how much headroom you really have. For me, trying to keep a signal clean was more enlightening than fuzzing it out, although that's always more fun.  For parts, I try to stick to Tayda Electronics because they're cheap and reliable. For stuff that they don't have, Mouser, Parts Express, or Digikey will probably carry it. All of them ship internationally, I believe.   Are there any places where I can see schematics next to completed circuit boards so that I can compare them to help me improve my reading/understanding of schematics.   Looking at completed circuit boards, especially production PCB's, will just make you more confused because they're optimized to save space (not to look intuitive). Schematics are pretty much a ""you get it or you don't"" thing. If you feel like you need to learn how to piece a circuit together correctly from a schematic, grab a breadboard and tinker with that so that you're not committing expensive components with solder."

diypedals,3aa1bb,trampled_empire,3,Mon Jun 22 13:00:40 2015 UTC,"Tips I learned the hard way that might help you somewhere down the line:  Checking Potentiometer Connections Use a multimeter to check your pots. This is especially important after soldering wires to the lugs. Make sure those connections are good by clipping the meter leads to the wire ends that you'll be attaching to the board and verifying that the pot does have continuity through all connections and that the resistance goes up and down when you rotate the shaft.   Pots are buggers and I seem to always have issues with the connections on them. Sometimes pots are just duds and no signal comes through even if they're soldered properly. I guess you get what you pay for. Anyway, I'm pretty sure that these issues account for most of the frustration I experienced when I first started and couldn't figure out why the signal died at a certain point in my circuits.   Audio Probes: More fun than the other kind of probe! Build yourself an audio probe testing unit so that you can test circuits before you solder DC power jacks and 1/4"" jacks to the board.  I made a small box with two 1/4"" jacks and a DC jack, as well as a DPDT on/on toggle switch and 4 long wires (input, output, V+ and ground) that come out of the box and end in alligator clips so I can just clip them to wires that come out of my board, and cut off power and audio signal to the amp at the flick of a switch. One of the best ideas I've had.   The Wonderful, Horrible World of JFETs If you ever intend to build JFET Transistor overdrive circuits (which you should somewhere down the road, as they are wonderful), buy a shit ton of 100k trimmer potentiometers and use them in place of drain resistors. JFETs vary a LOT in specs from unit to unit, even of the same make, and using trimmers to bias them will save you from premature baldness.   It also helps to solder an extra wire to the board at each JFET's drain terminal so that you can just clip the positive lead of the multimeter to the end of it while you turn the trimmer to bias the transistor. This way you don't need 3 arms and won't lose your hair over it. If you don't have multimeter leads with ends that can Clamp on to something, get some.   On the topic of JFETS, if you find yourself using a trimmer to bias them and yet you can't get the voltage at the drain down past 1v below the supply level, and you've tried a few different transistors (oh yeah, USE SOCKETS FOR CHIPS AND TRANSISTORS), the reason is likely that the transistor is missing a path to ground, likely from the source terminal. Double check to make sure you haven't forgotten a resistor somewhere, and reheat your connections to make sure they're all making good connections.   If you find that you can bias the transistor properly, but that when you strum the strings, the multimeter shows that the voltage at the JFET's drain goes way up but never comes back down, you've forgotten a resistor between the gate terminal and ground, causing charge to build up at the gate but then have no way to dissipate.   JFETs also have different pinouts than BJTs. The gate (input) terminal is usually on the side rather than the middle. If you aren't 100% certain what the pinout of a chip or transistor is, look it up. Avoiding stress-induced baldness is the cool thing to do!   Now that I've covered most of the main points of my love/hate relationship with JFETs, let's finish with this. Look up how to solder like a pro. Read that shit. Take notes if you have to. Buy flux, use a wet sponge to wipe excess solder off of your iron, etc. You might ignore most pro soldering tips most of the time, but, since Non-pcb solder joints are the most error prone, you'd be wise to pull out all the stops on those connections. Just don't overheat 3PDT switch lugs or the plastic might melt and you'll lose out on quality time with your luscious locks.   TL;DR sry for wall of text. Also, sry bald ppl"

This point is determined by the value of the capacitor; the lower the value, the higher the frequency.  So, bypassing R2 with a small value capacitor will provide a signal boost (more gain) at high frequencies only. Using a larger value capacitor will let lower frequency signals through as well (essentially all of the guitar's frequency range) providing an increase in gain overall rather than just for treble."

This can compensate for some variation in FET characteristics -- if the FET is conducting too much current, the voltage across R2 will rise making the FET gate more negative with respect to the FET source, and thus reducing the current in the FET.   As for the second question:   through a resistor to ground?   The capacitor increases gain only for the AC component of the signal, and the resistor is kept at a certain value in order to properly bias the transistor. Just a way to boost it a little more if the vanilla circuit isn't enough."

Yes, it will distort. It will not amplify, and it will only produce distortion on one side of the wave, and not very pleasant distortion.  By itself hooked up to a guitar or another complete circuit, this circuit will not work. The transistor won't turn on because there is no positive bias on the base. And if you do apply positive voltage to the base, you will need an input cap. You also will need a resistor to ground on the second transistor; right now at best it's working as a diode in series with the second diode at the output (or possibly reversed, I forget which way the internal diode ""faces"" at the moment ... if it's anode-to-anode or cathode-to-cathode, it won't pass signals smaller than, say, >35V?).  That's looking at it purely as an audio circuit. You also happen to have drawn a rectifier, and there is a use for that in guitar circuits for producing octave effects and for generating envelope control voltages. But as a pure audio circuit, it would be pretty lousy.  Just drawing a cicruit and saying ""Does this work?"" will not go very far. Pull out the breadboard and start listening.

diypedals,39uj9q,crb3,3,Sun Jun 14 22:16:33 2015 UTC,"If you replace the input stage with an opamp, you can move that transistor into a second clipper stage, so the clipper effects are more symmetrical, and get more precise control over input stage gain (start with Av=85) and bandwidth while you're at it. Maybe get less white noise, too, depending on the opamp (i.e. not a 741/4558 -- they only used those things back when because they were the best they had). Unlike the opamp BMP you'll still be using BJT clippers for a more classic sound. Maybe use DMOS like 2N7000, with quiet-bias network, for the final stage so there's less loading on the tone stack. Or go active-filter for the tone stack and maybe get a tunable notch.  One more idea for experimenting: if your second clipper stage has four diodes, you can treat them as a ring modulator and transformer-couple just about anything in there... like, the R2R-summed outputs of a CD4024 driven from the first clipper?"

diypedals,39uj9q,crb3,2,Mon Jun 15 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"Here is the final schematic: http://i.imgur.com/yketLbm.jpg  Most of it is based off of Kitrae's observations, and a tone stack from AMZ, http://www.muzique.com/lab/atone.htm The biggest difference from a normal BMP, is 1mOhm shunt on the first transistor, as i wanted to see if it would give me more power into the clipping stage, since there is only one.  I kept the two low pass filters at 440pf as it gives the tone stack more control.  This was made from loose parts so you'll see a few areas of capacitors in parallel to get close to what I wanted.  It sounds pretty good to be honest, better than I thought. It's not as big and thumpy as a real BMP, but it does have the essence of it, and the dual tone control seems to give more overall range.    Any feedback before I decide if I want to keep it and solder it up?"
diypedals,39uj9q,crb3,2,Mon Jun 15 14:57:57 2015 UTC,"Changing the 470k shunt to 1M doesn't change the gain-setting, it just means a lower base-bias point, and less current reaching the base (so you're counting on higher device gain to make all the current settings come out right).   Stage gain is (largely -- i.e. ignoring base current, which works if your NPNs are 2N3904 or better) set by the ratio of collector resistor to emitter resistor, so, for example, your input stage will be trying to run a stage-gain of nominal 100 (10k / 100). I say 'nominal' because that 10k is paralleled with that 1M bias resistor (1/ (1/10k + 1/1M)  -- not much change even when it was a 470k), and, for AC, both the base-bias network (through that pair of 220pF) and whatever the resistive loading is on the far side of that output 0.1uF, so the ratio will actually be lower in operation, frequency-dependent.  With your bias change, that stage will hit cutoff quicker, so you'll get more second-harmonic distortion (because it's asymmetric, affecting only one edge of the waveform). Your voltage gain remains largely unchanged over the original design; sorry.    e: Reducing the emitter resistor will raise the stage gain, at the cost of lowering the input impedance (because base impedance is Re * hFE -- that resistor value multiplied by the transistor's beta). If you prepend a buffer of some sort in your stompbox chain, you can largely ignore that, but the sound will change a bit because the cap values are all tuned to the original impedance."
diypedals,39uj9q,crb3,2,Mon Jun 15 20:26:09 2015 UTC,"Great! Thanks for the feedback. I guess I miss interpreted a description somewhere.  The transistors I believe are 2N5088 (i'll have to double check when i'm home from work), and I think the resistor you're referring to is 10K.  So i'll cut that 1M in half or maybe less and see how it sounds and go from there.  A question though; Due to Pot limitations, I only have 25k and 20k pots that are unused. What can i do with the sustain portion to assure i get as much out of it as I can?  Thanks again."
diypedals,39uj9q,crb3,2,Mon Jun 15 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"2N5088 is great for this: high hFE at low collector current, and low noise as well. (The reason I mentioned 2N3904 rather than, say, 2N2222, is that the gain curve peaks around 1mA for 2N3904; it peaks around 10mA for 2N2222, so, at these sub-milliamp settings, there's less device gain to play with.)  The sustain pot is used as a potentiometer, that is, a variable resistive divider-network device. As such, the only problem you have is that 25k presents four times as much loading through that 0.1uF cap. You can make that up, giving up the lower end of the sustain knob's normal function, by turning that 1k off its bottom into, say, a 47k for starts (and then play with it and listen a lot). You won't be able to back down the sustain as far, but you'll only have a quarter more loading there (~75k compared to 100k) and some more high-pass filtering at that node because of it. If you had an opamp driving it... they're good down to maybe 5k-loading depending on the device."
diypedals,39uj9q,crb3,2,Mon Jun 15 21:26:28 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, so the normal load on a BMP in that section is 1K to 101K, while mine is 1K to 26K. So, ranging from 47K to 75K will allow the 25K pot to work in the upper '100K' of the proper sustain, but I won't be able to turn it down as low. A happy medium is what I want here then, like you said 47K as a starting point.  Next build will have an opamp in the input stage. I believe I have L074 and a 4558 kicking around. for now though, just transistors as it's my first 'from scratch' build."

Sorry for all the basic things here that you probably have done, or already no. But, the circuit in bypass is very simple to trouble shoot. So just take your time, and go over everything again."

diypedals,39qnik,joeyfettuccine,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:12:42 2015 UTC,"Assuming you can read schematics already ,  just... try it. It's obvious what parts connect where, so look at the schematic and sketch out a turret layout on paper or something. Not really a whole lot to it."
diypedals,39qnik,Bee_Jay,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:46:47 2015 UTC,"I also built a range master on a turret board terminal strip and it was pretty straightforward working out the layout.   You just have to view the circuit as a set of nodes with components connecting the different nodes. Just sit down with a piece of paper, draw a little turret, and then draw all the components from that turret going to different turrets etc. until you have the full circuit (it helps to cross out each component on the schematic as you go). You might have to do it a few times to get a neat looking drawing.  Since you have a PCB layout, it perhaps makes it even easier. You can do it as you say, but I would try and save on turrets by wiring stuff off board. What I mean by this, is for example, instead of having a turret for the '3' connection, you could simply solder one side of the 47k and 470R resistors to the -9V, and run wire the rest of the way to the respective turrets that each will connect to (insulating where appropriate). And soldering the -ve side of the 22uF capacitor to the pot lug, and use a wire to connect the +ve side to the ground turret.  So you could get away with 6 turrets if you wanted.  If you post a layout here I can double check it for you if you want."

I'm putting it on the shelf for now, might pick it up for troubleshooting some time next week tho. It was really fun and I learned a lot :)"
diypedals,39l8tu,Bee_Jay,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:46:27 2015 UTC,"I was a little confused by your advice at first, but I think I get it now.  Is this what you mean? This is what I took from it.  Keep one lead of the multimeter on the middle pin, and turn the volume knob all the way up. Then, while still touching the middle pin, touch the other lead to each of the other pins. One pin should give a resistance of almost zero ohms, and the other should give approximately the total resistance of the pot. You want to use the pin that had the higher resistance as ground."
diypedals,39l8tu,midwayfair,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is correct. I picked the volume pot because it is almost always just using the pot as a voltage divider between the output of the circuit and ground. You turn the pot to what you want/expect maximum volume to be (i.e. clockwise fully). When it is at this position, what you want is a voltage divider with the output that is essentially Circuit Output -> '0 ohm resistor' -> Volume pot output (centre lug) -> 'max pot value resistor' -> ground. So when your pot is at its expected 'max volume' position, you want the circuit output connected to the lug with essentially no resistance to the centre lug, and ground connected to the lug with maximum resistance to the centre lug. This allows almost all of the signal to be passed through."
diypedals,39l8tu,fallingforthisagain,2,Fri Jun 12 17:33:18 2015 UTC,"Probably the lower one.  the second pot is a volume pot. Lug 1 is ground. With the shaft facing down and the lugs toward you, pots lugs are numbered 3-2-1.  Of course, this doesn't mean that the person who did the layout did it consistently. So the real answer is go find the schematic and look at the numbering in the schematic."

The good news is that it's easy to fix backwards wiring, and in most cases it shouldn't mess up the rest of the circuit or any of the components."

With the knob upright, looking at it from the top and with the pins facing down, left to right is pin 1, 2 and 3.  So, on the picture you posted, referring to the knob sitting upright, the topmost pin (in the pic) is pin 1 and most likely the topmost pin in the schematic you have there is pin 1."
diypedals,39l8tu,dustoff_avenger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:15:59 2015 UTC,"My first build I did from a vero board layout (The ""Factory de Fuzz"" layout for the Fuzz Factory) used a similar symbol for pots, and their notation was such that you're looking on at the back side (the plain metal back) of the pot.  However, vero layouts on TagboardEffects tend to be the opposite: you're looking on at the front side (knob side) of the pot. Or they number the leads (1, 2, 3), and there's a picture on their website of a pot that shows what those numbers mean.  Some schematics draw a pot with the letters ""CW"" written nearby. That indicates which side of the pot the wiper moves towards when you turn the knob (or screw, in the case of trimpots) clockwise.  But a lot of schematics don't specify at all what orientation to use. I think people just make educated guesses in those situations. In the comment section of TagboardEffects, you'll often see the first person who built the circuit say ""such-and-such pot is wired backwards."" So sometimes it's just guesswork and trial-and-error. If you turn a knob up and the volume (or distortion or whatever) goes down, the solution is pretty clear: just flip it around."
diypedals,39l8tu,Bee_Jay,0,Fri Jun 12 16:56:24 2015 UTC,"Touch an ohm meter probe to the metal case. Now touch each switch lead in turn. The one that stays at 0 ohms after you turn the knob the other way is the ground pin, that is the one indicated by the sort of upside down christmas tree thing."
diypedals,39l8tu,dc880610,3,Fri Jun 12 15:02:08 2015 UTC,But one leg of the pot would already have to be connected to the case for that approach to work? and I have never come across a pot where that is the case. I don't see any way how this can logically work (especially considering from the picture there is already two pots with different ground lugs).
diypedals,39j8r7,sveitthrone,5,Fri Jun 12 02:41:51 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like you didn't heat the components around the solder enough. Make sure to heat the wire and the connection point before applying solder, and I'd recommend applying the solder to one of the surfaces rather than the iron in order to get a stronger bond.  Also, with many components, it's good practice to make a good physical connection in the circuit before trying to solder any given point. So if you've got a resistor to pop into the circuit, place it in the board, snip the leads down a bit, and bend them inward so the resistor can stay in the board even if you were to turn the board upside down, shake it a bit, etc. Same goes for wiring the input/output jacks. When these jacks have a small hole in them, first thread the wire through that hole and hook it around a bit. Once you have that connection established, then solder it to solidify that connection. The idea effectively is to provide a bit of a fail safe, so if your solder joints were to break for any reason, your circuit can still function with the remaining physical connection, rather than completely falling apart.  Apologies if any of this is not making sense, I'm on my phone in bed about to sleep. I can answer any other questions you might have a little more thoroughly once morning rolls around."

Totally makes sense. When I was putting it together initially I had bent the leads to either side to hold it in place when I flipped the board over to solder. I suppose I could do more to secure it?  Another question I had was weather or not those resistors specifically should be sitting right on top of the board, or if I should be leaving some room between them and the PCB.  Edit - Is there an easier way of wiring to the audio jacks? The connector holes on those jacks were huge compared to the wire, and I felt like I could have done more to solder the wire down to it. When I did it, I just ran the bare wire into the hole and bent it around the connector, then soldered."
diypedals,39j8r7,kerbang,2,Fri Jun 12 03:39:19 2015 UTC,FYI another way to keep components in place is to drop them in and then place a glob of blu-tac over it. This helps keep solder joints clean because you don't have to bend the leads.

diypedals,39j8r7,MrTallSteve,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"The easiest way is to tin the jack in addition to tinning the wire. Run the wire through the jack, and place it against the solder you've put on there. Get a bit of solder on your iron, touch it to the jack, and watch for the solder on each component flow together. You can always go back and add solder to fill in the lug if necessary. This also works for holding something in place temporarily. For example, if you need to run two wires to a single point, you can tack the one, run the other, and then do a final reflow. I recently started using this technique, and my solder joints have never looked prettier. Since the goal is to simply get the solder on both pieces to mesh, the wire isn't heated as much, and the insulation doesn't melt as readily.  Another less pretty but equally functional way is to fill the lug with solder, melt it, and run a tinned wire through it while it's still molten. You have to make sure that the solder on both pieces has fused, however, before you remove the iron. You also have to hold the wire still while the solder freezes. I really only do this when the hole in the lug is significantly larger than the wire gauge."
diypedals,39j8r7,MrTallSteve,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"You have to touch a bit of solder to the iron first to get the solder and the flux flowing over everything.

diypedals,39c827,orangetubehead,2,Thu Jun 11 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on how many buffers you're putting in & if you want an LED indicator! One DPDT (LED-less) per buffer I'd say, just wire it up the same way you would a 3PDT stomp to bypass a regular effect"
diypedals,39c827,orangetubehead,2,Thu Jun 11 20:00:10 2015 UTC,"the plan would probably be to have 2 buffers in it so I can keep the outputs at stereo separate with the buffers in parallel.  also, (because I'm still somewhat new to this) would you recommend putting the buffers in line with the power with indicator led to activate on a single switch or would I need 2 switches?"
diypedals,39c827,orangetubehead,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused as to how you're going to be using the pedal in your rig, are you thinking you'll use the buffers to split your guitars signal into 2 independent outputs? Where does the FX loop come into it? How come you need only 1 send & 2 returns?  You could in theory turn both buffers & an indicator LED on/off at the same time with a single 5PDT switch, but I doubt such a thing exists :P Otherwise you could use 2 3PDT switches to independently bypass each buffer with an LED for each, or a 4PDT switch for again simultaneous switching with no LED."
diypedals,39ctb9,blkdevil,3,Wed Jun 10 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"First of all, have you tried adjusting the knobs to see if you get any sound? Obviously, you don't want the volume to be all the way down ... but keep in mind that the Fuzz Factory is very temperamental: certain settings of the knobs render it nearly unusable. You'd probably still get some sound, but some settings may well give you nothing at all. It's worth fiddling around with the knobs to see if that does anything; your circuit might actually be working just fine.  Have you double-checked the orientation of the transistors? Since you're using different transistors than the original, you may want to take extra care with the pins. But then again, this probably isn't the problem, since you're working straight from the schematic; this is more of an issue with veroboard layouts or PCBs.  Have you also double-checked the orientation of your pots? Again, this tends to be more of an issue with veroboard layouts, but you may just want to double-check that your pots aren't wired backwards.  I don't know if I've given you any good leads at all, but that's all I can think of at the moment."

It's labeled ""Gain Adjustment"" -- it's unlikely to do something totally different! Mark the trim, or remember the setting in case you don't like what happens.   Second question: What's the empty Gain Adj pad?   It's a via, not a pad. A way to move traces between the top and bottom of the board for better routing. See how the trace terminates at the little pad? The trace reappears on the bottom of the board.   So why, in the Gain Mod link, do i see THREE wires connecting to the Gain Mod knob?   Two wires attached to a pot means the pot is being used as a variable resistor. Three means it's a potentiometer -- or it could still be a variable resistor and someone used a third wire so they didn't mess something up and fail to make a connection. Do you have a schematic to see what the pot is doing? (Almost) everything you ever wanted to know about pots is here if you're not sure what I was talking about in this paragraph."

In theory, if you use the metal casing as a common ground, any EMF will be picked up equally by both the circuit and the case, effectively cancelling out any interference.  This is the same reason that you use twisted pairs of wire to cut down on interference when you're building an amp (or a phone line, or an Ethernet cable, etc). It's also how humbuckers work."

What if you used a DPDT (on-off-on), and wired the diodes with the highest clipping voltage across the middle pins? Then you could wire the other two pairs as usual. Since each of the other pairs of diodes has a lower forward voltage than the hard-wired set across the middle pins, it would be as though those middle diodes weren't even there.  Sorry if this is hard to understand; maybe I can draw up a sketch tomorrow. I'm not sure it would work, but it seems like it should. Would be a nice trick, if it did."

I'll draw up something to make it 100% clear what I did.    EDIT: Here's how I biased my buffer. I used 2 uF for the capacitor because that's what the EQ circuit uses, and I got my 4.5V by pulling in a 1Mohm resistor from the 4.5V bias point of the EQ circuit.  That first 1Mohm resistor to ground might be unnecessary. I originally put it in because I was switching the EQ on and off and wanted to prevent pops. But it shouldn't hurt anything, right?"

diypedals,38bjx3,MrTallSteve,4,Wed Jun 3 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"/u/Tele72Dlx hit on the right track. The booster is 180 degrees out of phase with the distortion. Each gain stage inverts the input signal. The boost only has one, whereas the distortion has two. If they're each sent the same guitar signal, comparative to the input, the output of the boost would be inverted while the distortion would not. You'll need to add another gain stage or inverting buffer to the boost to flip it back in phase with the distortion in order to use it. Personally, I'd ditch the JFET topology entirely in favor of a dual op amp clean boost/summing amp setup."
diypedals,38bjx3,midwayfair,4,Wed Jun 3 05:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, the signal is out of phase. But that's not the only reason it's not working well.  It's because this type of blend circuit is just bad. I'm not going to mince words. It comes up a lot and it's the sort of thing that I kind of wish sometimes that the sites that had it would just delete the schematics, because folks look at it and say, ""oh, that looks really easy because it only uses one pot!"" You pay for the simplicity with poor performance. Even ROG's blender splitter is this kind of design, which is disappointing.  Here's why it doesn't work well (this is just to add to /u/joeyfettuccine's explanation): The impedance in the center of the pot is 50K on either side. At either extreme, one side has progressively less impedance, while the other side approaches the max of 100K. But the circuit has to be designed such that 100K is enough to really attenuate the signal so that it can't be heard as much. In the center, BOTH are attenuated, rather than simply being mixed together. A bigger pot would exacerbate the problem and a smaller pot will still have it to a lesser degree but not really isolate the signals.  The solution is an active mixer, where the outputs of each effect is isolated and phase-corrected if needed. JMK sells something called ""The Panner,"" which can be used to blend two effects together (as well as to pan to stereo outputs). See here as well: http://www.geofex.com/Article_Folders/panner.pdf  Or IMO even better, you can construct something using a dual gang pot, which is how it's done in stereo systems and several pedals that have a clean/dirt blend. I'd type out how to do it, but to be honest, it's a little involved for a reddit post, I'm feeling lazy, and going over every possible way of doing it with this effect would be difficult, because there are multiple considerations to make.  Oh. One thing you might be interested in knowing, though: If you remove the red LED, replace the MOSFET in the Peppermill with a BJT, you can take a clean signal from the emitter of the first transistor and mix it at the output. It will be in phase with the signal at the output of the J201. (If you want gain, you'll have to use an op amp or two transistor stages.) OR you can decouple the signal at the drain of the MOSFET and take it to another parallel inverting stage, and the output of the new stage will be in phase with the output of the J201. That would be the same number of active components you have now. Again, without getting too deep into it, a 100K volume pot after that would mean that you have the same value as the clean stage, so you could use a 100K dual gang for the clean/dirt blend, a resistor mixer, and a BJT buffer after the mixing point to keep the output impedance down."
diypedals,38bjx3,joeyfettuccine,3,Wed Jun 3 13:43:02 2015 UTC,"It's a lot quieter in the middle because both signals have to pass through 50k of resistance to get to the blend pot wiper, then after that see a 100k resistor (the volume pot) to ground, as well as the parallel input impedance of the following pedal/amp/line input. The result is just a voltage divider. It's a basic pan control that favors simplicity over performance. Look up active panning circuits and you might find something that would fit your needs.   Maybe put a buffer between the blend pot and the volume pot and you could see less volume drop. Also, then the sweep of the blend pot won't change depending on what you plug the pedal into.  Edit... Also out of phase signals colliding at the blend wiper are probably contributing. The OD has two inverting stages and the clean boost has just one stage, correct?"

You're messing with mains power, which can potentially kill you from a wiring error, and the phrasing of your question indicates that you don't understand some very basic concepts involved in power supply construction.  GGG has an isolated power supply project, as does Smallbear. You can read up on what's involved in them. And you should also read up on safety for handling mains power.  But the short answer is that you're not isolating the grounds in that thing without a mess of transformers that won't fit in the brick.

Ceramic capacitors can introduce noise similar to how high value resistors have ""thermal noise"".  Use a film cap that says ""103"" on it. With capacitors, value, polarity, and voltage rating are literally all that matters. Construction does not."

I can tell you typically (please double check your parts before planning or drilling yourself) stomp switches are 1/2"", in/out jacks are 3/8"", pots are 5/16"" or 9/32"", standard size LEDs with bezels are 1/4"" and power jacks vary on the type but my lo profile ones are 1/4"".

diypedals,37nxua,twasAruse,3,Fri May 29 01:03:32 2015 UTC,It's generally not a good idea to have a passive signal when splitting the signal. Usually you'd have an active buffer. But the expression idea sounds good l cool. I've done something similar by building an active blend/mixer with expression.

diypedals,37ntqf,milerky2,2,Fri May 29 16:20:58 2015 UTC,"As you put ""household"" on the list, I'm assuming you're meaning measuring mains voltage - meaning high voltage (115/230V), high energy circuits with the potential of getting spikes on the line while you're measuring it - so going for a good brand meter is worth it from a safety and reliability perspective.  There's a good discussion about meters and safety (and a video showing what happens when a cheap meter gets hit with an overvoltage) over at: http://np.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/371l8f/fluke_demonstrates_why_you_shouldnt_buy_a_cheap/  Some options I could personally recommend:   The Agilent/Keysight U1230 series Anything from Fluke   I have never regretted buying quality tools. My 20-year old Fluke is still going strong."
diypedals,37ntqf,planet12,2,Fri May 29 05:26:00 2015 UTC,"I'd buy something decent. As your old one has proven you, if you take care of a quality tool, it will last you a long time. And is it worth it to save a bit of cash to have a tool that is less safe, gets slower readings and won't last as long?  At work, we have Fluke and Agilent. I prefer the feel of the Fluke (for no real reason, so I might be biased), but the Agilent is very nice too.  I've also heard great things bout the price/quality of Voltcraft meters."
diypedals,37ntqf,Belenar,2,Fri May 29 07:57:02 2015 UTC,"unfortunately it does not read milliamps and I need something that does ( for tube amp biasing ).   In your case I'd just use the cathode resistor method described here; no need for current measuring just to do tube amp biasing.  If you still need/want a multimeter that does current, I'd go with an 83. Mine has been serving me well for years and years."

You'll be waiting for a resistance, capacitance or voltage reading to settle.  It has a BJT hFE reading, too, but it's sort of approximate and they don't really publish the biasing or current readings and just give you a number.  I originally didn't want to shell out the cash for a Fluke, but I picked up a used 287 this year."

I was going to get a bench DMM but I came across the deal on the 287 and got it instead. I wanted something that I could rely on to read down to the millivolt."
diypedals,37ntqf,PedroDaGr8,1 point,Sat May 30 02:00:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like a broken record at times but check out Brymen. They are the OEM for most Greenlee, some Amprobe,  plus a few other companies meters. I often mention them for people on a budget because they are usually more affordable than Fluke for a similar price point.   For example,  their BM869S is UL-listed with a higher safety rating than ANY Fluke (CAT IV 1kV), has 500,000 count on DCV, has amazing accuracy specs (goes toe to toe with flukes best), has more features,  etc all for under $250 (shipped from TME.eu)   The Brymen BM257S is highly regarded as a great budget meter over at eevblog and can easily be sourced for around <$130.  Another interesting option, though I have yet to find a source for it, is the Der EE DE-5004. It combines a real LCR meter with a multimeter in one package. This can be very useful for the audio hobbyist,  allowing you to characterize inductors and capacitors as well as the standard multimeter functions. If you are interested in this one, you might be able to try the Japanese sellers on eBay that sell the DE-5000 LCR meter(a top notch true LCR that I own)."

Also, the Small Bear 3PDT PCB didn't do everything I needed it to (might be my lack of understanding), and the Mudbunny PCB is made for three pots and no switches (and that's what supposed to fit in the 125B), so that accounts for extra wiring and creative fitting of additional hardware.   Then again, maybe I made this harder than it should've been, the rookie factor is certainly at play. Had I known it would end up this tightly packed, I would've picked a bigger box. That being said, it fits and works!  And yeah, acid is scary. It took three tries and then I just... gave up? It looked alright. Had to sand the box each time and, guess what?

If not, you could rig up a simple battery/led (with a resistor) circuit as a way to test the switch.

The entire case is grounded as long as either the input or output jack is soldered to the circuit's ground. Thus, the other jack will be grounded too since it touches the enclosure. The fact that the entire enclosure acts as a ground plane is what shields the circuit from external electromagnetic radiation (hum/noise)."

When I turn the pedal on the LED lights up (with both battery and plugged in) but the sound is extremely quiet. There is no sound with the volume less than 90%. I double checked the pot values and they are correct. It sounds like the circuit is working somewhat as it is a distorted signal coming out.   I'm most concerned with there being no sound while off. I have tried measuring continuity with the multimeter between input and output and it seems to be working although it's a bit finicky. This leads me to think there's an iffy solder joint but they look okay to me.   My thoughts on possibilities: - bad solder joint I'm not seeing on the footswitch  - a weird ground loop somewhere - backwards capacitors (the marking on the capacitors on the schematic indicate the negative lead correct? - ground lug of output doesn't need to be connected to anything correct? I tried adding a wire here and it didn't work."

diypedals,37hzoq,midwayfair,1 point,Wed May 27 21:07:16 2015 UTC,"It looks like your switch is wired for true bypass, so I'd say No, solder bridges wouldn't explain your lack of output when bypassed. You should get a dry signal through it even if the pedal didn't have power.  Check all six pole combinations for continuity. Depending on how much solder you have on the lugs your results could be a little finicky. If at first you get no continuity try three times. If the switch tests good go ahead and resolder all your white cables that run the dry signal."

Browse through the backscrolls of this subreddit, /r/arduino and /r/electronics for where the ""what's a good iron"" topic is raised and read through the replies so you're familiar with what's available now where for how much and what the tradeoffs are. solder: lead-bearing, 63/37 mix, 0.031"" diameter rosin-core. My go-to brand is Kester #44. Crappy solder (indirectly) kills parts, by making your iron dwell on the leads long enough to cook 'em. long-nose (needle-nose) pliers, 4"" to 5"" length: two of 'em as soon as you can afford it. flush-cutters (aka microshears) for cutting leads close after soldering. a small vise of some sort for holding the board steady. 3rd Hand is one brand (I think it's rather wimpy myself); PanaVise is a known brand (but Dytex was a better one). google ""work positioner"" for more choices. a cheap digital multimeter, auto-ranging if you can get it. Most of what you'll use it for is DC voltage, resistance and continuity checks. Other functions are seldom-used gravy. a spring-loaded solder evacuator (""solder sucker""). My Okab T2B works well. small Channeloks or ignition pliers: incredibly useful for holding nuts and standoffs steady while your other hand works a screwdriver, and for crimping down on connectors when you don't have the exact crimper, and... screwdrivers. A cheap set will do you for starts.   All of that's just for populating a board, smoke-testing it and installing it in a prepared case. Tooling for cutting and drilling holes in enclosures is a whole 'nuther matter.  Get a large toolbox to hold them.

You don't need any specific resources until you start getting into more complicated designs than a simple fuzz. It's the same rules as a schematic: Everything that should be connected is connected, and everything that shouldn't be connected together isn't connected together. A trace is a bit of copper. A pad is also a bit of copper. If one piece of copper on your PCB is touching another piece, then they are connected. What did you use to draw the PCB? In Eagle, there is a function that's a yellow circle with an exclamation point -- it tells you all the errors or potential errors, like if a trace or pad is too close to another, etc.  As far as other things you can do to improve that PCB:  Your PCB is far larger than it needs to be. It looks like it must be close to 50 square inches! There's no reason to space your components out like that; they only need to be as close as necessary to not crash into the traces. You can set the grid finer if you didn't. It might help to watch some video tutorials on using the program you used.  Your potentiometer pads are all the way down at the bottom of the PCB near the input and output wires or off on the side of the enclosure -- why? Are they going to go anywhere near that in the box when you build the circuit? Put them where the wire runs will be shorter, as close to their physical destination on the outside of the box as possible. (Use the grid to line them up properly and space them evenly.)  Similarly -- is that where your power jack will go, on the left (out) side of the enclosure? Is that where your in jack will go? Are you looking at putting the board components-down in the enclosure or components-up? Because most people put them components-up so they can see if anything goes wrong; your pads are most likely on the wrong side.  What is T1 doing in your schematic? The collector and emitter are shorted. I can't think of any use of a transistor in this circuit that would call for that. The schematic you linked to only has 5 transistors. Given that your PCB contains components that aren't on the schematic you linked to, it would probably really help if you posted the exact schematic that you actually created the PCB from. And ran an error check on the PCB so you could identify any other problems."

When you said    It's the same rules as a schematic: Everything that should be connected is connected, and everything that shouldn't be connected together isn't connected together.    I get that, and that's what gave me the confidence to recreate an old schematic. I think I am confused as to what to do with the SW1a and SW1b part of the schematic. The middle of the board stuff is fine, it's the IN, 9V, GND that I'm not sure how they all fit together.  The spacing was intentional, it's just easier to work with and I intend to swap out different diodes to see which might sound better.  Also when you wrote    What is T1 doing in your schematic? The collector and emitter are shorted.    Well, I never picked up that they were shorted. But I basically redesigned the circuit straight from the schematic (of which there are 6 transistors) and then converted that to the PCB part of Eagle. I didn't use the 'rats nest' feature in Eagle, I think that might do some weird things that I don't understand. Not sure how or why the collector and emitter got connected though.  Ugh, I thought it would be a simple cut and paste kind of job. Feeling disheartened about this ):"

There is only one path for the current to flow- from the tip to the sleeve (or from the ring to the sleeve for the second switch). The LED has to be between those two points.

With building stuff from scratch everything is laid out for you and you know what to do, stuff that has been already built but needs fixing or repurposing equipment is for people that have a really good grasp of electric component interaction."

Breaks up nice. I replaced the original Chinese 12AX7 with a JJ ECC803 long plate and it was a improvement. Nice practice amp and could be used in a studio. Great instructions, point to point wiring on terminal strips, pretty easy construction for a first time builder."
diypedals,376mr0,MrTallSteve,1 point,Wed May 27 02:10:54 2015 UTC,"I've been looking into this as well. It seems the most recommended route is to go with a 5f1 champ or 5e3 deluxe kit as these are nice sounding and simple amps. Weber has the most affordable kits (by far) but I've read a lot of comments on forums of really slow shipping times, poor quality cabinets and transformers and missing components in the kits in dealing with them. Boot Hill sells kits for the chassis/electrical guts and seems to include nice stuff and they have a good reputation but you have to source the speaker, tubes, transformers and cabinet, which can really add up when counting shipping from various sources. Upside of that is you can pick out top notch stuff for the build and wind up with a really top shelf amp.  It'll probably cost about 400-500 total for a champ and about 600-700 for a 5e3 if you go with someone like boothill and source the rest of the parts from other decent quality vendors.  Mojotone have a good reputation for their amp kits but you'll spend a lot more building one of those than buying a used (and sometimes new) amp that it's cloning. The parts for amps are relatively cheap (transformers will run you about 100 from classictone and a nice speaker 80-200) but they add up quickly and then you have to buy from multiple sources because no ones going to have all the parts to order from one spot individually so shipped can add another 100-200. TL:DR: You'll wind up spending more money building a kit than a mass production version of the same amp, but you'll also have much nicer quality throughout all the components and no cut corners and most likely a nicer sounding version of whatever amp you are building."

Do you have the cash to stock up on parts? Can you make batches of pedals quick enough to make more than a few dollars an hour (assuming you sell them all)? Can you deal with entitled asshole customers in a timely and courteous fashion? Can you fix broken pedals? How will you market them?

diypedals,36tpns,robotgraves,2,Fri May 22 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"From the way those schematics read, it looks like pin 14 is some signal out.

diypedals,36tpns,wroughtironfence,2,Fri May 22 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"no.  The 1uf that is after pin 14, further down the chain a little.  It runs to the the repeats and mix knobs.  Note how the repeats work, if 16 / 15 is basically effect in, the repeat knob is bringing some of the signal back to those pins, so it's essentially (partially) plugged into itself.  This is only if you want the signal to get ""wetter"" with the the looped effect; in other words, if you want your delayed signal to go through the effect, and then get it again, and again, and again, until it dies.  This does have a side effect that if the loop contains more gain, then you will get to feedback status much easier.    If you want just the wet signal to get hit ""once"" by the loop, I would apply the effect only one step later, AFTER the junction to repeats, before the mix knob.  The effect would be just the wet signal, repeats and all, getting effected only once.  No Cascade"

diypedals,36tpns,midwayfair,2,Fri May 22 09:51:06 2015 UTC,"Look up the schematic. See where the delay line in the schematic connects back to the inverting pin of the op amp?  Disconnect that component, and build a buffer. Connect the delay output to the input of the buffer, and the output of the buffer to your effects out loop jack. Add a volume control if you want, but the delay mix pot is already good enough. Then build another buffer to receive the incoming effects loop signal. Connect the output of the second buffer to the inverting pin of the dry path, which you disconnected in the first paragraph.  A dual op amp is probably the simplest way to do this since you already have a Vb in the Neptune.  Use switched jacks so that the out of buffer 1 is connected to the in of buffer 2 when you don't have anything plugged in.  Also, regardless of what you use for your buffers, op amps or transistors, your final signal must remain the same phase. So don't use an interting buffer and a non-inverting buffer, or a collector follower and an emitter follower."

Basically, the outer part of the male pushes the outer part of the connector so it stops being in contact with ""the other pin"". Originally, you'd have positive on the battery ""shorted"" to a ""positive bus"", but when you plug the jack, you still get the ""positive bus"" from the wall, while leaving the positive lead of the battery open.  Incidentally, this is also why using a non-isolated DC jack is a bad idea most times: you'd be shorting positive to ground (been there, done that)."

Twisting the pot will change the resistance between the wiper and voltage high pins.   If you find out the point on the pots rotation at which the feedback is optimal, you can measure the resistance between the pins and make a potential divider with two resistors that matches it. Using your momentary switch you can swap in the pot or the resistors. That way you set the feedback to a point rather than maxing it out.  I can't think of a way to slowly ramp the resistance without a pot or a mechanical solution. You could use an small IC and a digital potentiometer but that's quite involved unfortunately."

diypedals,36n0ec,midwayfair,2,Thu May 21 10:48:50 2015 UTC,"20-40 hFE with leakage all over the place. I've used a couple in a Sziklai configuration and realize I can use them for buffers or in place of Ge diodes. If you've got suggestions I'm listening.   Here's some further ideas!   With the higher leakage ones, use them in a normal Darlington configuration in a later stage of an effect and omit the negative feedback resistor. The transistor will self-bias thanks to the leakage, and the self-noise will be low because it's LATE in the circuit and the noise won't be further amplified down the line. The multiplied gain range is actually PERFECT for the last stage of a Big Muff -- it'll sit right in the correct gain range (200-400) for the silicon transistors, and will have a different flavor compared with an all silicon; and the germanium will distort differently (more obvious if you use, say, LEDs for the clippers on Q3 and retain more output from that transistor). Heavily loaded input stage of classic fuzzes. The 40Hfe ones are just fine for the Q1 in a Tone Bender (I or II), and it's actually possible to go lower, though you might need to slightly adjust the bias. Or you can use two in an Darlington again with the input heavily loaded to decrease noise issues -- that's what the TB MKIII is! If the leakage is very low, you can still use them in a low-gain Fuzz Face. Low-gain mic preamps -- the leakage and low gain is not much of a problem for noise. In fact, I've seen some claims that a germanium preamp is capable of lower self-noise than a  You've already mentioned buffers, but there are some less-obvious buffers you might not have thought of: DC buffers to create a voltage reference (look at the Mutron V schematic) can have low input impedance and the self-noise won't matter because it's a faux ground point for audio. Op amp Vbs are more common than transistor ones (though they are still rare comparatively) and a big hulking germanium transistor isn't a space saver on a layout, but it's still something you can use them for instead of just tossing them. Output audio buffers with germanium are more likely to distort than silicon high-gain transistors and are unlikely to contribute to overall noise. I think you can also use them for booststrapping to create higher headroom similar to what Merlin did in the Glass Blower. Including Push--Pull amplifier methods in a circuit using them would help cancel the self-noise created by the higher leakage ones.   Not all of these are likely to pan out, and a very low-gain germanium transistor would't be the first thing I reach for to do anything, BUT maybe one of these ideas will give you some inspiration. :)   Edited to add: I'm building the Flab from Madbean's PCB this weekend. What's something you would do different than the official build doc?   Build it stock first and see if you need to change or add anything. Pretty much everything Brian changed was an improvement."

diypedals,36n0ec,midwayfair,2,Thu May 21 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"Smallbear and don't look back. Audited/guaranteed (to some extent) devices if you want to test your own; NPN and PNP devices; and when you buy a set from them they give you the biasing resistors for it (yes, all four resistors matter -- most ""matched pairs"" you buy from other places just expect you to change one resistor, the collector bias on Q2). (Also, I guarantee all that kit does is sort transistors to fall within two ranges and uses the same resistor values from the fuzz face schematic, rather than giving you the best resistor values for a particular pair of transistors and taking into account the exact leakage and gain of the individual devices. There's a reason the kit is so cheap.)  You can also buy large lots of Russian germanium devices on Ebay, but you will need to set up a good testing routine for them. But I've built multiple great sounding fuzzes from them -- they tend to have good leakage numbers but you need to buy multiple sets of devices to get the right gain ranges. (They're surplus military -- devices that were picked over for a specific usage [e.g. radios] near the center of their bell curve, so lots let over tend to have a big ""hole"" near the middle of their gain range, or sometimes mostly low gain.)  You could also put a WTB on a forum like Madbean for a single transistor. Which one did you destroy (Q1 or Q2)? What was the transistor's part number? Did you get the high gain or normal gain version?"

This market is incredibly saturated.  There are some really innovative companies out there right now. There are also a couple high profile companies making well marketed clones passed off as originals and making a killing.  What I'm getting at is that there is a huge selection to choose from.  Whether or not your pedal is better or not, I think you will have a tough time getting people to commit to something with a 2-3 month wait time.  There are a few companies that are successful doing this, but they have sterling reputations and have been around for ages.  There's really no harm in trying, just be prepared that there may not be much of an interest.  I sold very few pedals until guitar and bass forums picked them up so to say, and even after a year I've sold less than 100.  I have three designs, two of which are originals and a third modified clone.  It's a tough marketplace, and as a new entry price is really the only way to compete.    I hope this helps.

There are a few people here and there who might build pedals and sell them, but extremely few who actually run a pedal business. These are not the people to ask. They're also not the people to advertise to, because they're not going to buy your pedal -- they want to build their own. (They might buy your circuitboard.)

Even if they're both whining at pitches that are above human hearing, since they're very unlikely to be whining at the exact same frequency, if both signals get into one junction they can demodulate into a whine that is audible (the difference between the two pitches).  At the very least, you're going to want to put in some heavy decoupling to keep those boards from interacting at all at the supply rail. That means that, from the +9V input jack (or the battery clip's +9V lead, or the power switch -- whichever node feeds directly to the boards) you should plan on something like 10 to 100 ohm resistors in series with each device, and, where resistor meets board, a 0.1 uF multilayer ceramic cap and a 100 uF aluminum electrolytic cap are in parallel to shunt that node to ground (two resistors and four caps total).  If you find that both dependent circuits have a total current draw that is well within the capabilities of one of those inverters, you might find it worthwhile to disconnect and turn off one of those switching inverters and power both circuits from the other one; then you don't have to worry about heterodyne suppression.  (This is what that ""courtesy output"" is for.) Same rules about decoupling: shunt any fluctuations in power demand to ground with caps, maybe isolated with low-value resistors, otherwise the two circuits will interact through that node, though not as energetically as the switchers would.  The easiest, if you're up for the redesign involved, is to just leave both switcher sections unpopulated and feed both circuits straight -9VDC, though then you can't use a common-negative-ground power adapter to power them.  I'd say, start with the least-labor version, feeding the two switchers in parallel, and see how much trouble it is to completely suppress any whine."

If you can't power with a battery, then make sure that the only power supply you're using is with the BMP and that no other pedals are connected.  If you still have noise problems then I'll try and suggest more things to fix it. It's strange you're getting it on two pedals, so that makes me think that it's probably more to do with something else like your guitar, cables, amp or power.

diypedals,35w53m,crb3,2,Thu May 14 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds like my own BMP, though obviously I can't compare amplitudes. Did you short the input jack to ground before recording that, so that only the effect's internal noise shows up?  A BMP is a noisy circuit; that's just the nature of the beast. Any resistor noise in the first stage's self-biasing network is going to be amplified by a factor of very roughly a thousand by the time it gets to the tone bank. That's why modern builds are using metal-film resistors (the original BMPs used carbon-comp) -- cermet is less noisy than carbon. The clipper design works against you as well, because each clipper stage limits the loud intentional signal to +/-Vf while raising a faint noise signal up with full gain. Any low-noise improvements in that first stage will pay big dividends.   Hm, there's a design project waiting there for someone: redoing the first three BMP stages to apply the same quiet-bias network technique  Keen pointed out on GeoFex for Orman's AMZ Mosfet Booster, so that only actual base current flows through the resistor that delivers that current to the transistor base from a decoupled bias node. That should reduce the noise a bit more.  e: I will agree with /u/10101110101: rerun the test using a fresh alkaline 9V battery. I think there's just a hint of periodicity and grit in that recording, just enough for me to wonder if anything's getting in through the power rails (particularly since you say you've got the same problem with the far simpler Nick Greer Green Giant). Knock the PS out of the equation and retest."

Should I be buying Lava cables for all the internals, or is there a standard that's considered clean/professional? I see the sidebar with all the suppliers, but I'm sure I can't just buy any wire, switches and connectors and get the same results can I?   Thanks again for the info.

diypedals,35v89i,DuctTapeRiot,3,Wed May 13 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"I dont quite understand your diagram, but i can say from experience dont skimp on the jacks or switches.  If  you cheap out there you will regret it down the line. Both will wear out and cause problems fairly quickly. Neutrik or Switchcraft jacks, and the better quality switches from Mammoth or BLMS or Mouser.  Stay away from Tayda for anything mechanical.  An enclosure is just an enclosure as long as it is metal and grounded.  You could use some Belkin shielded cable for your internal wiring if you really want, but as long as you keep everything as short as possible and nice and neat you should be totally fine with regular 22 or 24 gauge hook up wire."
diypedals,35v89i,trampled_empire,3,Thu May 14 03:05:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, your question about buffers is an important one if you don't fully grasp their function, so here you go.   A buffer clones your signal exactly, but as it does so it also provides a higher current at the output so that the signal has greater power, and thus can travel further without issue.   Good buffers also have a high input impedance, so that your guitar signal is entirely absorbed into the Circuit rather than being partially reflected back. Hence, why it is recommended to use a buffered effect at the very start of your chain. On the diy side of things, any time you are splitting a signal into two different channels/outputs/paths, buffer that shit before you split it, so all the guitar sees is a wall of impedance, and not two or more paths with different impedances. You shouldn't give your guitar signal the choice of which path to choose, cause that signal is lazy as shit and always chooses the easier one, and you end up with different volumes.   BUT! The thing is, no buffer makes a perfect 1:1 replica - usually the output volume is about 2%-5% lower than the the input. It's really not anything to worry about, and the benefit outweighs the loss.   However... If you've got 10 buffered effects in your chain, that shit starts to add up and your signal can start to drop a fair bit. So that's why people cry about them. Poorly designed buffers definitely contribute to signal loss, as does completely unmoderated overuse of them. Be smart about using them and they are a godsend.   Oh, one last thing. Use buffers properly and there's absolutely no difference in the cable quality you use, since the signal gets pumped through at a high power. There's an episode of Brian Wampler's podcast that talks about this.   Edit: one more thing. You know those fancy schmancy soldering techniques that you ignore most of the time? You know, using flux, heating the joint and never touching the solder to the Iron, but rather to the joint you're heating? That shit is especially important any time you're connecting wire to any mechanical part like a pot or a Jack. So pull out all the stops and make those connections classy. Careful when heating 3PDT switch lugs though, don't keep your iron in contact with them for too long or the plastic casing will melt an you'll be out a switch."

Why is this the case? Couldn't you use a unity-gain amplifier (with an op amp) as a buffer? And if so, wouldn't it output the exact same as what you put in? Even if not, couldn't you just use the op amp as a non-inverting amplifier to make up for whatever minor amount was lost?"
diypedals,35v89i,dc880610,2,Mon May 18 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if we're getting into different topologies, it's possible that you can. But for ELI5 purposes I wanted to explain why they could contribute to tone loss. I should have said they often aren't designed as well as they could be and so often don't have perfect unity gain. I'd have to do more digging to say for sure but I do recall reading somewhere that it wasn't possible to get perfect unity gain. However, I can't logically say why that would be without reading up on it more.   That being said, if I'm mistaken please do set me straight!

I don't know; maybe I'm a naive electronics student, but I've always been puzzled at why buffer designs seem so complicated when you could just use a simple op amp.  Maybe the older problematic buffer designs used transistors rather than op amps. Wouldn't that mean lower input impedance, which could cause these issues?"

diypedals,35kul7,crb3,3,Tue May 12 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"what's stopping us from just dropping down some of our effects into the digital realm?   Because some of our more cherished and tweakable effects rely on exploiting corner behaviors of junctions and transistors. Modeling those effects in DSP won't have that raw, wild and responsive edge, instead it'll sound 'regular and safe' ('bland'), which is a useful sound for some musical contexts but not the same thing at all. Still, if that's what you want to jam on...  Some of that's already been done. Look into what's available in the Debian and Ubuntu repositories and Ubuntu PPAs. To make it more gig-portable than a laptop, you can set up a SBC like a RasPI to run one or more of those programs; then there's creative experimental room yet in designing and programming a control-surface for it that's responsive, intuitive and bulletproof.   Nobody's got a lock on that yet, in fact there's probably not one best way to do it as it'll depend on user taste and circumstances.  That last applies to the code as well. There's room for more variations in how the fundamental effects are coded, if that's what you want to play with. Some of those programs and algorithms might port down from high-powered general-purpose CPU to raw dedicated DSP (and there's a frontier yet where musical effects meets GPU -- just think of how deep and wide and fractal a digital reverb that would make), but, unless that's all you want to do, I recommend choosing suitable off-the-shelf hardware like the Pi instead and hooking into its low-level and GPIO interfaces to build it out and make it gigworthy, otherwise you'll have no time left over for playing music."

diypedals,35kul7,beatleboy07,2,Tue May 12 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"The Pi has this going for it: * unlike a laptop, it has low-level IO hw brought out for extension. The lappie only has USB. Lappies are fragile, and that fragility has to be exposed for it to be useful. The Pi can be installed in a brick shithouse and have a control-surface that isn't. * the Pi has a Debian distro (raspbian) as standard, which means that nominally all the apps in the repos are compiled and ready and known-working. * there's a large intentional community built up around that board, a community which includes its designers. If you've got questions, they've got answers. If you've got a vague idea, chances are somebody in there has created/designed at least part  of its implementation. * the Pi does have audio, though I understand it could be better.  Nothing says you can't start with the onboard audio, then migrate to a USB-outboard DACout when sound quality becomes an issue.      Me, I'd want a board with sATA built in (banana pi?) so I could focus on development without worry about using up a flashcard's limited writes. When I was at Alesis (in the MidiVerb/MidiFex days -- don't get impressed, I was an early fire, too, it wasn't that good a match), I was quite impressed with just how much intense listening Keith Barr did and how insanely iterative he was about even minor tweaks to one reverb program, like budging just one FIR pickup point out of twenty or more over by one or two samples to sweeten the sound and get rid of a minor metallic resonance. In any digital sound-modification process like reverb, there are an awful lot of ugly sounds and a relatively few sweet spots, and zeroing in on top-dead-center of those sweet spots was an art he mastered by being rightly OCD about it. I would expect to wear out SSD media trying to emulate that."

The second is relatively recent, with a pickup group called the Gentlemen Rocketeers, where Nelson's using digital effects, most likely on a laptop.  The digital stuff is smooth, super-smooth, and it's probably a lot easier for him to get a consistent sound out of it, but the tradeoff is that there's just not an awful lot of character to to it -- it sounds like it's happening in an adjacent reality and you're just getting the newsreel highlights. It doesn't respond to his playing, it just processes it (and I think his improvisation maybe misfires a bit, compared to earlier recordings, for his not being able to provoke a response he can pivot on).   With no real control surface brought out, it's probably harder for him to make expressive on-the-spot changes, too (I'm guessing, here, not having seen the equipment, but only read things he's posted about his current toolset on his site's forum and elsewhere)."

diypedals,35kul7,crb3,2,Sat May 16 01:02:10 2015 UTC,"Do you mean a digital controller for your analog effects? I believe signal routing would be much easier to program into a chip than to handwire all the possible configurations.  As for digital effects themselves I have some experience with this from my days a CE/EE:  Delays and loops are probably the biggest strength digital circuits have over analogs (it blows my mind that bucket-brigade chips even work in theory) though capturing the analog sound is much harder with digital, which is generally true for all types of effects. They also work pretty intuitively, having the program loop over a memory buffer, writing/adding the current sample to whats there already, maybe dividing the previous value by some feedback reduction constant, then writing that sample to that spot in memory and the DAC.  Simple filters aren't impossible, but they are MUCH harder to implement than analog filters. They work similarly to delays, actually, but much less intuitively. Generally involves looping over a memory buffer of samples, adding or subtracting previous samples with some coefficients ( [i] + 2[i-1] - [i-2] etc...) according to DSP filter design rules which are the complicated part. You can read up on digital filters, or play around with it if you have the means.  Unfortunately, I don't have any experience with frequency modulation in DSP or analog :(  There are other weird things you can do to distort the signal, like down sampling, or bit crunching, but any attempt at emulating tube/transistor saturation is going to be extremely difficult. I know there are forums out there specifically for digital amp modeler designs, but I don't know if they get into the nitty gritty of the DSP. I don't know about diode clipping, but I do know that every digital fuzz emulater I've heard has sounded pretty shitty.  Sorry if I rambled a bit. This was as much a review for myself as an attempt to answer your question, though I hope this helped a bit."

diypedals,35kul7,com2mentator,2,Tue May 12 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"One thing that also went through my mind was to implement it with an FPGA, and get some hardware DSP going. Thoughts?   At 44.1KHz (CD-quality) sample-rate, samples are entering and leaving your memory system every 22 microseconds, and that's for mono. Thus, whatever iterative process you write (be it simple delay or algorithmic clipping or a highly complex reverb) has to be complete within that 22us limit. If you want one ADAC to do you for two sample-and-hold stereo channels, the numbers are tighter still.  How fast can your DSP work? How many instruction cycles can it execute in that time-frame? That determines how complex an audio conversion it can perform. If your audio conversion involves outside parameters (like a noise source for chorus, an LFO for tremolo or vibrato, or control bits for switching filter paths), how much instruction time does it take to pull in those parameters? Can your DSP make in-program branches based on variables (like, whether to run the reverb through a final darkening lo-pass or not)? Can it perform index-plus-offset-plus-offset to rhythmically shorten a 'room' or emulate Doppler effect?  Your IO choices will thus have an impact. Even autonomous stereo ADC subsystems have to get their values into the reverberation chamber somehow. Something has to push values out to DAC before they fall off the end of memory.  Your memory choices will have an impact too. Back quite some years ago when I was more directly involved with such things, DRAM was the only economical choice, but its relatively slow access times and refresh requirements were a penalty. Now static RAM is faster and cheaper, but fast enough? Can registered RAM help or hinder?   I'm not up on current FPGAs, but I recall their general-array structures imposing significant prop-delay penalties. Can you configure a fast enough DSP, or do you need a dedicated one? How fast a discrete DSP can you get for cheap? How much of the 'extras' hinted at above can it do?  Prepare to do a lot of spreadsheeting to work out optimum solutions :) And that'll be after you do some whiteboarding of audio-conversion processes and drill those down to get some specifics (like, how many cycles a given one costs), because until you've got that you've got no real target.  I say that as someone who watched somebody prepare to enter the digital reverb market, only to find out after a significant cash outlay that his solution wasn't doable with current OTS hardware. He didn't do his due-diligence and he paid for it."

How are you planning on building this, on a PCB which you've purchased or on strip board?  You're right about the switching configuration, SW1->SW3 is a buffered bypass and SW2->SW3 is the effect.

The circuit also has a balanced output option which you probably won't be using and could just leave out."

Try plugging in a very low value in place of the tone knob and see what happens.  Etc. Play and learn.

Even treating guitar as a mono signal, that will take X-times-X SPST relays to do up in full. A sparse matrix, based on some artistic decisions about what chains result in useful sound modifications, might result in matrix nodes such as your cluster-of-three, but most of your patches are more likely to be inclusion/exclusion points where a DPDT either routes the signal through an effect or bypasses it. That kind of chain, or a few chains arranged in a sparse rejoined-tree, is a lot easier to build, and program for, too.  Keep in mind: however complex your switchbed gets, you as designer/programmer are going to have to come up with a quick and efficient way for you, the user/instrumentalist, to run the thing. If your patch-sets are per-song, how do you program in the option to stomp one step-advance button to kick the sound and volume up for a solo, then step back to the prior patch-set for a sound that's suitable for backing the vocals? If your patch-sets are per-preset, how do you logically chain patch-change events for the course of a given song? Keying in hex-values with mouse and keyboard is kinda tricky for someone with their hands full of guitar...  I keep thinking of the frequent in-song changes Bill Nelson put his Cornish pedalboard through on the ""Live In The Air Age"" album, particularly in tunes like ""Shine"" and ""Adventures In A Yorkshire Landscape"". At times phrase-by-phrase, switching for punctuation or counterpoint or just because he felt like it... And his chain-order was hardwired and relatively inflexible so it didn't yield anywhere near the total expressiveness available in that electronic palette, and none of the analog values (voltages, pots, toggles) were digitized like we'd want for a completely preset system."

Don't let this dissuade you, however! I'm saying it only so you understand the limitations and practicality of springs. Look into building a spring reverb, but look to make it more of a small, standalone unit rather than a pedal on a board or a unit mounted in/on another amp. Schematics will usually be composed of your spring tank driver and the recovery driver for the wet signal coming out the tank, along with any sort of feedback and wet/dry blending networks, and it's all very practical to wire, it's just building an enclosure that can be challenging (how are your woodworking skills?

Switch up will give you the normal configuration, switch down will give you the resistor value. In theory you don't even need a resistor, you could just bypass the pot because it's likely they are used as voltage dividers rather than rheostats. It's probably a good idea to use a resistor though."

diypedals,3544io,crb3,3,Thu May 7 13:01:48 2015 UTC,"The schematic I saw doesn't have polarity protection or power filtering. Usually this is a diode like 1N4001 between +9Vdc and ground, and a capacitor or series of capacitors (like 100uF electrolytic ||100nF film) between +9V and ground.  Those may keep your pedal from being fried when someone plugs in the wrong polarity or uses a noisy supply.  You may want to consider putting a zener diode between the rails to prevent too high a voltage supply."
diypedals,3544io,crb3,2,Thu May 7 00:35:54 2015 UTC,"Usually this is a diode like 1N4001 between +9Vdc and ground,   Or a Schottky rectifier such as 1N5819 (hot-carrier devices have lower Vf) in series between the DC jack and the board's +9V rail. That way, if the supply's plugged in wrong, it doesn't short out the supply, instead it simply doesn't conduct.  If you're worried about supply ripple or overvoltage, throw in an LM317L local-regulator circuit (Schottky-blocked) and feed it from a +12V external supply."

But with just a cursory look, you're breaking a lot of rules I would follow:   avoid bending traces more than 45 degrees at a time have minimum spacing between copper traces. I keep 4 mils as min spacing, but cheap manufacturers could end up shorting even with the traces that close. You have to check their specs. Any trace with a signal on it could couple with nearby traces and affect the ""victim"" trace. keep traces 100 mils from edge of the board (avoids them getting cut off when PCB is cut) avoid routing underneath active parts you generally route power and ground traces thicker than signal traces depending on the current draw. You might want to adjust placement so that you can bus the power and ground rails. I didn't check decoupling but capacitor placement can be important.   I didn't compare this to a schematic, so I'm sure I'm missing other issues.  While the layout may work, I would expect it to be noisy and sound like crap.  (Edit: miles should be mils.)"

Almost all pedals don't need this, but it's not bad advice in general PCB design   avoid routing underneath active parts   I bet this might be a thing I should worry about more  The rest of this advice is good, and Eagle is free and should do it automatically for you."
diypedals,3520lv,robotgraves,3,Wed May 6 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"avoid routing underneath active parts    I bet this might be a thing I should worry about more   Not at these frequencies and voltages. Running audio signal under digital components could sometimes be an issue if the audio stuff is VERY VERY VERY high impedance (FETs?), but audio under audio components is perfectly fine. Just a bit of logic here: You're not going to get the traces on the PCB physically closer than the base and emitter of a transistor, which would be instant positive feedback."
diypedals,3520lv,midwayfair,1 point,Wed May 6 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I didn't know the 45 degree bend was necessary. It was originally like that with the autorouter, then I tried to create further space between the traces.   The thing is, if I just could use two layers, I would conform to all of the above. The autorouter is great for that, but when it comes to using one layer it's a god damn nightmare.  Minimum spacing just isn't working, and the traces have to go underneath active parts. Maybe a breadboard is a better option then."

Who are you looking at to produce it?  3) Why are you focused on single side so much, when most production houses will make PCBs double sided with vias for super cheap.  All the components are on one side, but board lines run on both sides.  You could reduce the size probably by half, thus reducing the cost by half."

That way bare wire on single-side (or insulated over groundplane) can substitute for the topside traces. You'll want to beef up the vias since they'll be soldered to.  Home etch can be an electrical (or mechanical fit) design test, or a quicker prototype."

Of note, it is typical, and easy routing to place the clipping diodes side by side and R24 (sustain) and R23 (to pin 1 of R24) is a fustercluck of running around it doesn't need to. Have R23 next to R24, and be thejumper over those traces.  Flip C4/C5 end to end. Have the LED limit resistor off the +9 line, on the PCB  What I would do is start again, with graph paper, 10 to the inch, and draw only on the lines, and a single 45 to join vertical too horizontal. I would draw a thick ground around most of the outside, and a +9 bus down the middle. I would break it down and draw the fuzz on one side of the +9 bus, and the gate on the other side, placing the parts basically in circuit order.   I would have the off board connections along the edge, or in one or two places and use a board to wire connector and harness (JST or Molex) to connect off board components."

I haven't tried it properly yet (it needs a microSD i think, but radio works through it so far) but I'm hopeful I can use this as an all in one debugging station.

You can see from this list that pots of the 10x variety are all common -- get a vew of each of these, then fill in the gaps with 250k's, 200k's, 25k's, 5k's, maybe one 2.2M (you'll use it one day), ect ect.  It's really hard to gauge what pots you will need in the future, and of what taper, but I'll suggest not overdoing it with quantity. I bought 10 10k's off ebay when i first started out, and like 5-10 100k's, and I mix and matched them for various basic projects for months. Just get like three to five of each, a couple more if you can afford.  Also, look into turning lin pots into log pots by rinning a parellel resistor along it - it's not quite audio taper, more of a poor-man's log taper, but I find its taper useful in some applications more so than a proper audio log pot."

To test the board as a whole, temporarily bypass the DC jack, soldering the red battery clip lead directly to the +9V point on the board and the black battery clip lead directly to the GND point. Plug in the battery and try putting a signal through the board. If that works, either your DC jack is defective, one of the solder joints on it was bad or you wired it wrong.  e: Oh.

With the current density in most op-amp circuits, that will matter -- a 10K/volt meter probing the junction of R15 and R16, for instance, will read seriously low because the meter loads it down, appearing in parallel with R16. Most DMMs have input impedance upwards of 1M. The cheap ones aren't all that robust, but if you physically pamper them until you can get something better, they'll do the job."

The housing I used that fit snugly with the battery is, 4.5"" x 3.5"" x 2.25"". This enclosure is close to the one I used. Just make sure you don't ground out your circuit board either on the back of the foot switch or the casing.

Couple of questions for you: first, how'd you get those awesome graphics onto the pedal? Second, would a layer of electrical tape on the backside of the case prevent contact/grounding issues?

I didn't get too many shots of the process, but I'll try to give a quick explanation. The current BMP has the potentiometer connects directly on the circuit board. They've got a fair bit of give, and you can easily bend them to squash the foot print down. Once I did that, I aligned where I would drill the holes for the knobs, and placed everything around that. I had to shove the input and output jack to the bottom left and right, instead of up top, and got rid of the AC jack for now because I was really stubborn and wanted the 9V in there. It's a really tight fit in the case, so I lined the bottom with some cork to prevent any shorting.    Here's what she looks like now.

diypedals,34tdcy,JakeDC,3,Mon May 4 12:07:02 2015 UTC,"C1 and R4 are already a high pass filter. Drop the value of R4 to 20k-25k and put a 100k pot in series with it and you can cut more bass.   To add an LPF, put it at the output, use the same value cap as C1 and send it to ground. Try 100k or 250k for the pot."
diypedals,34tdcy,explodedsun,1 point,Mon May 4 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks! just to be clear, would it be possible to replace R4 with a 25k linear pot for volume control and a 100k linear pot for a high pass filter (essentially a treble control?) wired in series?  And then, add a low pass filter (essentially a bass control?) after the output of the initial preamp circuit?  I think this is what you are saying, but I want to be sure."
diypedals,34tdcy,explodedsun,1 point,Mon May 4 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"No, you'd just be controlling the filter with 2 different pots. I'd put the volume pot at the input of the circuit, unless you want to make this more complex and set up an isolation transistor between your filters and your output.  http://www.electrosmash.com/images/tech/pro-co-rat/pro-co-rat-schematic-parts.jpg  See the orange output section in the link? That simply separates your tone control from your volume control so they don't screw with each other. I believe you could use a  J201 there as well instead of the other transistor."

diypedals,34r1ad,midwayfair,3,Sun May 3 22:59:28 2015 UTC,"I have considered doing a redesign with more stages.    Works much better with more stages, but there are other things you can do to get more depth by rearranging some parts in the single stage version. The white paper for my Blue Warbler might be useful to you. You can ignore the envelope stuff, but the two-stage version gets a lot of depth and has plenty of pitch shifting even with the mismatched collector/emitter resistors; the LDR choice can also be pretty critical. (Mismatching them produces a bit more warble, which I thought sounded closer to the actual amp.)"

diypedals,34qgw3,prusaga,1 point,Sun May 3 17:37:08 2015 UTC,"There are two issues here.   Your best bet for putting together a pedal that will work is buying a volume/expression pedal from one of the vendors found in/via the sidebar here, then modifying it if/as required. Why? Because there's some substantial mechanical engineering in that pedal which, since you're new, you shouldn't tackle first thing. Far better to buy and adapt something which won't crumple under your weight, won't tear up the pot inside, and will reliably couple the treadle position into pot rotation, so you have an initial success under your belt. A MIDI expression pedal, if I read your intention right, is a small computer that just happens to have a MIDI port (DIN-5 jack, 8-bit opto-coupled serial at 31.25 Kbps) at one end and a pot at the other end. For a newbie, I recommend an Arduino, one with two UARTs (because one of those UARTs will be busy doing the edit/compile/download-and-flash/debug cycle with your host PC via USB until you get the firmware working satisfactorily -- so you need a second UART to work the MIDI port). The Arduino community has built up libraries for things like MIDI and using the built-in ADC to measure a pot's resistance, so you're getting an assist from others' work. You might even discover that somebody has already designed/written and posted a complete MIDI expression-pedal solution and all you need to do is replicate it.   That's if you're actually after a MIDI expression pedal, that is, a pedal which translates pot resistance changes into controller changes (set for a particular controller number and a particular MIDI channel) and spits out those changes as MIDI commands. If what you want is a simple resistance-based expression pedal to plug into an existing MIDI keyboard that has a jack for such, see item 1 and you're all set."
diypedals,34qgw3,crb3,1 point,Sun May 3 19:48:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. Yes I would like my expression to send changes in the pedal as MIDI for example I want to use in Ableton Live using Amplitube. What I am thinking is to use a Teensy so that a conversion from MIDI to USB is taken care of already. Yea I ahve found some links involving the building of footpedal like http://www.thompdale.com/footpedal/footpedal.htm And also what I have come acros is they are available in stores as Foot pedal Potentiometers / Foot rocker potentiometers. Like this http://www.indiamart.com/pankaj/foot-operated-potentiometer.html So I am planing to buy them and hook my Teensy to it.
diypedals,34qgw3,Spaceshipable,1 point,Sun May 3 19:59:07 2015 UTC,Teensy is a great shout for MIDI stuff purely for the size. You could hook up a couple jack socket so you can connect up multiple standard foot switches and rocker pedals.

diypedals,34qgw3,Elfraido,1 point,Mon May 11 10:39:38 2015 UTC,It's probably far easier just to got an off the shelf one for the £30 quid it will set you back and save the hassle.   Alternatively the standard way for doing it is have a cog on the pot and a toothed strip on the rocker like in most wah pedals but that's going to be an awful lots of work. Really that becomes an engineering problem.
diypedals,34qgw3,Spaceshipable,1 point,Mon May 11 16:06:36 2015 UTC,The other issue is that volume or expression pots are often manufactured to have a custom taper.

diypedals,34ltiv,Elliot850,3,Sat May 2 09:15:10 2015 UTC,"You could add a 4.7k resistor in series with one of the end legs of the 20K pot to bring the frequency range back to where it was originally, just without the full range of sweep.  You may not ever use one end of the tone control range anyways.  As a general thing, if you find you only use a narrow range of a control, you can swap that pot for a smaller pot along with a couple of fixed resistors to get finer control and a more usable sweep range."

diypedals,34ltiv,petemate,8,Sat May 2 11:50:57 2015 UTC,"The pot is connected to a capacitor, and together they form an RC low-pass filter(google it if you want to know more). If your pot is all the way to the right(pin 2 connected straight to pin 3), the full signal will be let through, because it is set so that it will bypass the resistor and capacitor completely. If however you turn it all the way to the right(which is the same as connecting pin 2 to pin 1), you will have a low-pass filter.  The key equation is f = 1/(2*Pi*R*C), which gives you the cut-off frequency of the filter. If you enter the numbers, you will see that a 25k pot gives you a filter with a cut-off frequency of 637Hz and a 20k pot gives you 796Hz.  So, your tone knob will get a different response because it will let you pass from 0 to 800Hz with 20k, while it will let you pass from 0 to 637Hz with  the 25k pot. However, you cover the range from 0-637Hz within that 0-800Hz range, so you basically just extend your range of the filter.   (This was the short explanation. The setting of the presence know will also load the filter differently, which could result in a different characteristic, but thats probably nothing to worry about)"

That being said, in a 2HB guitar, you have a four coils to choose from. You could definitely wire a coil from each HB in series and a coil from each in out-of-phase parallel and blend the outputs."
diypedals,343c18,dad_farts,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"Well, it is possible to wire one of the humbucker's coils to a pot and effectively dial in the amount of coil ""splitting"" in the sound. I don't know if this is possible with the phase but I'd imagine not. Seeing as it is the reversing of the flow of electrons and not determined by how many are being sent to ground instead of to the amplifier. I have no background in EE but assume that a passive resistor/capacitor network could be wired to simulate the resistance of a pot at any given position and this could be controlled via a push-pull pot to get to and from your natural and pre-set filtered tone.  Hope that helps."

The master volume on most guitar effects is just a potentiometer at the end of the circuit with the wiper connected to the output, creating a voltage divider (as long as the next pedal is high impedance input..). I dont know what you're trying to do, but the pot/resistance you switch in could be a blend knob in an effects circuit, basically giving you two levels of blend."

You won't need much, so avoid blobs, but you should see the solder flow into the eyelet more than it is. A lot of times if you don't have full 'flow-out' you can have wonky connections.

You can see each of the positional grounding lugs on the outside rim of the rotary  4) For simplicity's sake, I will work clockwise from the center of the PCB rotary marker  5) Isolating the top three on the PCB, the bottom hole is for a pole, which we've established is 3 or 4, doesn't matter.  The other two are for each side of the switch, so Clockwise, lets wire the left one, Noon, to 1, and the right one, One o' Clock, to 5  6) Isolating the bottom, the process is the same.

diypedals,33r0bq,crb3,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:47:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The poles near the center correspond to pins 3 and 4 in the diagram. You can peer into the space around the wafer and actually see how the contacts are selected as you move the shaft; you can figure it out from there.  Check twice on the required space where you want to put it, before you commit to tearing out the original or drilling a pickguard hole (or cutting a hollow into the wood of the guitar body) for a new placement. Rotary switches take up a lot more lateral room than you expect, plus depth. If it requires any cutting, measure carefully; on a guitar you can't pass off the extra holes as being ""for ventilation"".  How long it'll last... Typically, rotaries are used in positions where they aren't budged that much. If you're constantly toggling it (say, switching between pickups), it might wear out quickly. Fortunately that's a relatively standard design, so replacements aren't hard to come by."

diypedals,33ll7s,crb3,2,Thu Apr 23 18:41:40 2015 UTC,those also have the issue that the metal exposed on the top in the reference image has to move in order to work (cliff jack style).  But not a bad solution.  its either:  1) Use the one I provided and manufacture a false back / bottom  or   2) Use the one you provided and make a false cover for those exposed metal bits.  toss up there

diypedals,33ll7s,MrBinns,2,Thu Apr 23 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty, but it's become disposable. It's good up until: - a jack wears out (goes loose, contact flexes to breaking, base metal exposed by abrasion and oxidizes past easy self-cleaning) - an electrolytic dries out or leaks - the circuit gets static-sparked/glitched bad enough to take out the chip (basically Santa Ana conditions but not impossible) - circuit is mistakenly powered up wrong (backwards, fed AC, wrong or defective adapter...) ...and then its a paperweight. Very pretty, but, for working equipment, I'd want repairability. This thing has been gooped -- clear goop, but goop."
diypedals,33ll7s,KeytarVillain,2,Fri Apr 24 02:54:30 2015 UTC,"Very true.

diypedals,33nmz6,Zodsayskneel,5,Fri Apr 24 00:11:43 2015 UTC,"But then there's the addition of a diode at the V+ in. Why?   People sometimes refer to that as ""polarity protection."" There are power supplies that generate -9V instead of +9V, and plugging that into a circuit can potentially damage it. That diode only allows current to flow if a positive voltage is applied. Nothing will happen if a negative voltage is applied (assuming you don't exceed the breakdown voltage)."

diypedals,33nmz6,jtn19120,3,Fri Apr 24 01:20:54 2015 UTC,"OK, the biggest difference is transistors (2n5133 vs 2n5088). The 2N5088 are the more recent near-equivalent to the 2n5133. 2n5133 are rare and usually too low gain to use anymore...You will find both transistors often used in other EHX products. Go with 2n5088. 2n5089s are very similar and can be subbed as in the GGG schem.   The 1M resistor is called a ""pulldown resistor"" and prevents popping when the pedal is switched in & out. C4 is part of a power filter, designed to reduce noise in the power supply. Both these parts are considered slight modern improvements worth doing pretty much every time since they're cheap.  Further, I'd suggest for easier builds you build on an etched/fabbed pcb from GGG or Madbean. As businesses, they do r&d and support for you. Tagboard builds are cheaper but can be headaches."

I probably built 8 pedals from purchased, multilayer PCBs before I etched my own single sided PCB.   I personally get most of my enjoyment out of modding circuits, the etching is just a means to build boards nobody else is producing. There are some boards which are so big and or complicated it isn't worth my time to lay them out, etch, and drill them if someone else is selling them for $8-$10."

Not easy as it's surface mounted.  If it is the switch it wouldn't be too bad as that's one of the few through hole components on the board. You would need to get a desoldering pump to get it out though. You just heat up each contact then vacuum pump the solder off.  Edit: by lead did you mean the flex connector that takes the switch to the board? You could make a new one but it's fiddly."

Although that site you linked does sell Dunlop jacks, it might be best to just buy the whole jack and steal the nut off it. Then at least you know it's the right size.

Enclosures, if you haven't handled any just yet, are very sturdy and usually this will not happen. Just make sure you use a strong drill (not too strong though) and proper bits for metal (or just sharp bits, that's what I do). When you use dull bits, when you first break through the enclosure while drilling your bit might snag and start spinning the enclosure around on the bit rather than rounding out the hole. Don't ever use your hands to brace an enclosure for drilling, clamp that sucker down and save yourself a twisted wrist."

The wiper should connect only to the 22uF capacitor, and the outside lugs should form a constant resistance. If the resistance between the emitter and ground changes when you turn the pot, that's your problem. [In this case, to make what you've described happen, you'll have hooked the wiper up to the emitter and lug 3 to ground (or vice versa) while lug 1 is connected to the 22uF cap. That's the only way I can make it work out without simply having forgotten to hook up a wire. Either that or you have a solder bridge between lugs 1 and 2 of the pot.] This will also change the bias on the transistor.  It cuts out when you turn the pot all the way up because Q1's base (which is silicon in your build) is no longer receiving any positive voltage to bias the transistor -- the 100k resistor connects to ground, and the silicon transistor shuts off. A germanium transistor in that spot wouldn't have revealed the problem as readily because the leakage of the transistor would have self-biased the transistor."

I'd grab an ""Electronics For Dummies"" book or something & get a grasp on the basics (it pays later to be patient at the beginning).

If you can't picture this, look up a picture of a sine wave.  If you want to know more about this look up graphic explanations of the Fourier transform and Fourier series.  Basically any wave that isn't a sine wave can be created by adding up many other sine waves.  The human ear can actually here all the sine waves making up one non-sine wave.  So when you ""clip"" your wave you change it's shape, which adds a bunch of higher-pitched, quieter notes, that get quieter the higher in pitch they get.  We hear this as distortion.  Generally overdrive doesn't clip the top as sharply as distortion.  And Fuzz clips the top and bottom of the sine waves unevenly.    I won't go into more as it's way beyond the scope of what can be explained here here.  If you learn how an inverting amplifier circuit works using an Op-Amp, then you will understand overdrive, which occurs when you set the gain too high and the highest parts of the waveform can't be amplified any higher."

diypedals,32xr4e,robotgraves,5,Sun Apr 19 18:39:05 2015 UTC,"Won't be able to break it all down, but here's a summary (I still have a limited knowledge too, so may get thus wrong).  First off, the most important thing to know is that sound is a wave, and you should think of a guitar signal like a sound wave.  Distortion/OD/fuzz - all caused in some part by the peaks off the wave being cut off or 'clipped'. In most cases the signal is amplified first or it will become quieter.  90% of these pedals will use an op amp or transistor to boost the volume.  There are three common ways to clip the signal: 1 -use diodes to trim the wave by only allowing some of the signal to pass (example: king of tone, rat, tubeascreamer) 2- using an op amp outside its ideal range so it starts to amplify some parts of the wave more than others (example: hotcake). 3- using a transistor amplified in a configuration which 'starves' it of power, causing it to clip the wave (example: eqd speaker cranker).  There are more methods for sure, but these are very common.  Modulation effects.  In general, much more complicated.  If you are talking about chorus, phase, flange, these are all achieved by duplicating the wave and offsetting the original and copy.  The two ways will combine to cause a resulting wave which is different than the input.  If the difference between the copy and the original is changing, this will cause the 'sweeping' sound common in these types of effects.    As to your question about diodes, resistors, capacitors etc. That will depend entirely on the application in the circuit.    Your best bet for learning about this stuff is to read the articles R.G. Keen has written or some of the articles at Electro Smash.  Both sources describe what each section of popular pedals achieves.  Hope this helps! Hopefully I haven't screwed anything up too bad."

In other words, you take a wave, increase the amplitude, and then shove it through something that can only accept the original amplitude.  The peaks get cut off, and you start to turn curves into squares.  Most can be done by using op-amps stacked into each other.

diypedals,32wg3z,jtn19120,6,Fri Apr 17 07:57:40 2015 UTC,"Technically yes, but it's unlikely.   Most digital stuff has a maximum input level, usually in the range of a few volts. A well designed pedal should have protection at its input so it clips the signal (with diodes usually) before you get to anything that's sensitive, but if it doesn't, or if you're doing the design yourself, it's definitely possible.   On an average distortion pedal that's all analog things are less sensitive, transistors and OP amps will basically just clip if you get past the range of the supply, and you'd have to be putting in tens of volts before you damage anything.   So the answer is yes you can, but not at the kind of voltages your guitar or another pedal are putting out, and not on a well designed pedal, they've thought of that.   Situations where you could? If you plug your ""speaker out"" into a pedal by accident (I've done it, I was going for the effects send and grabbed the wrong cable) then you're probably throwing a ton of voltage in there and the built in protection isn't enough to handle it. Or if you're designing a pedal/working in the lab and don't pay attention to the absolute maximums on some device that doesn't have protection (done that too, but audio design is my job, so it's bound to happen sooner or later)."

diypedals,32uljz,Unknown_Solderer,2,Fri Apr 17 17:11:10 2015 UTC,"You will want to look into pull-down resistors on the front of pedals -- they help discharge the input cap when switched off (when you switch your pedal on, you are letting this cap discharge through your line, which is causing your pop), plus they help determine your input impedance, which is a completely different topic but one worth mentioning when talking about this part's role.  The usual value suggested when talking about a pulldown resistor is 1Meg, but I've seen things like 2.2Meg used before. Too high a value and the cap wont discharge as fast (and possibly static in your signal? I've heard it discussed), and too low a value and you will form an audible high-pass filter with the previous pedal's output cap (or even the capacitance of the cable/wire).

diypedals,32nh2m,rbathplatinum,3,Wed Apr 15 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, its the same as turning the gate knob all the way to the left. The sound is a little more bassy, but not by much, and less harsh."
diypedals,32nh2m,MrBinns,3,Wed Apr 15 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"Ah. I would think, based on how interactive the Fuzz Factory's knobs are, that zeroing the gate knob might change the sound to varying degrees based on the other knobs' settings. Maybe the sound wouldn't change much on some settings, but on other settings, the sound might change drastically. It's a very touchy circuit...  I would test it myself, 'cause I built a Fuzz Factory a while back, but I recently destroyed it (unintentionally) during an attempt to mod it. Maybe I'll test out and incorporate this feature whenever I rebuild it."

Easiest way of doing it is by taking a 3mm drillbit and just place it in a hole (on the side with copper) and twist while pushing very gently, 3-5 turns is usually enough. Other than that you can literally cut the copper trace with a boxcutter or a sharp knife, but be careful it's easy to slip with the knife and you can possibly cut yourself or ruin the board. My personal opinion is to just use a drillbit."

diypedals,325xlh,engaged_touches,3,Fri Apr 10 21:17:48 2015 UTC,"There aren't a lot of different ways to build a passive mixer. Aside from durability differences, they mostly use the same design (basically just a bunch of volume pots and parallel resistors). The only major difference is the resistances they use. Passive mixers only work well when the output impedance of the sources connected to the mixer inputs are somewhat matched and very low, and the input impedance of the device connected to the mixer output is very high. Using larger resistances for the mixer network can compensate for poorly matched impedances, but the trade off is a higher noise floor and greater signal loss.   I wouldn't use a passive mixer unless you know exactly what devices will always be connected to the inputs and outputs, and their impedances. It's not the kind of thing you can just hook up to any given circuit and have it work well. Doing so will often give you sub-par performance, and you would be better off with an active mixer in that case. That's probably why you are finding so many bad reviews."

The guitar channel is at max and the synths at 50% (due to their line level output). You can also use the booster for the guitar in front of the mixer and turn the synths' volume up, that's a matter of personal taste, I for one like synths through boosters :-) Keep in mind this is a mono mixer so when you use both outputs of your sampler for stereo samples they will be summed to mono."
diypedals,322l4w,themachinerages,5,Fri Apr 10 01:50:52 2015 UTC,I've had the same issue with Tayda SIP sockets. Just decided I didn't feel like dealing with it and I'd rather have them stay in than have the freedom to swap some transistors in and out. Ended up soldering them right onto the board.
diypedals,322l4w,outkastedd,3,Fri Apr 10 03:35:58 2015 UTC,socketing transistors and IC's is not only about modularity. It is also about protecting heat sensitive parts from soldering temperatures. Careful soldering with heat sinks will make this a non issue. but this is the main reason I socket expensive (comparatively) or heat sensitive parts.
diypedals,322l4w,skrunkle,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:53:09 2015 UTC,"I mean, they were just bc549s so ~5 cents each and I have loads. I socket when I use more expensive items, e.g. the ac128s (~$5), but those don't usually have a problem staying in place, and if the cheap ones aren't staying socketed it's really not worth my time."
diypedals,322l4w,outkastedd,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:30:12 2015 UTC,This is the other main reason I have been using sockets. Could you explain how to solder with a heat sink?
diypedals,322l4w,skrunkle,2,Fri Apr 10 16:25:01 2015 UTC,so a heat sink usually comes in the form of a cheap little aluminum clamp like this: http://www.robotshop.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/515x515/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/l/elenco-soldering-heatsink.jpg  although I have used surgical forceps as well for a similar effect. I will put a dab of heat paste in the clamp then clap it to the component so the clamp is positioned between the component package and the point of soldering.  http://www.hiviz.com/kits/instructions/images/SST/sst-03_lrg.jpg This is a bit of a confusing picture but the point in question is the red handled tweezers positioned between the transistor package and the point of solder. The heat will flow into the heat sink and disrupt the direct flow of thermal energy into the component. thereby reducing the temperature the component needs to suffer.
diypedals,322l4w,Brutalos,5,Fri Apr 10 16:39:07 2015 UTC,Sometime if it feels loose in the socket I bend the leads to make them wavy. Like a bobby pin. Not a big zig zag or anything. Just a noticeable amount.
diypedals,322l4w,rsmjr,3,Fri Apr 10 14:19:54 2015 UTC,You can stick very small wire in there like 26 gauge solid copper. I would personally just install a new socket. Different company.
diypedals,322l4w,CobbITGuy,2,Fri Apr 10 02:17:59 2015 UTC,Did it feel loose? I haven't had problems with the Tayda SIP sockets.
diypedals,322l4w,Unknown_Solderer,2,Fri Apr 10 02:21:11 2015 UTC,"I too have problems with the machined Tayda SIP sockets. I'm used to this kind of looseness with my crappy breadboard so I know to bend the wires of the component in slightly different directions so that when I put them into the slots they will push against the insides of the sockets and create a connection, plus hold themselves in place.  For a better explanation, take your average electrolytic cap, bend the two leads so that they angle slightly away from each other (rather than them being parallel with each other), and when you lightly force the cap into two SIP sockets, the force of them pushing away from each other makes up somewhat for the looseness. With a three prong component (as in a transistor), I make the three leads bend away in a radial fashion. I find that if you don't do this and instead just bend the two outside leads, the center lead sometimes will be loose in the socket. Most DIP chips I get have the pins slightly bent outward in anticipation for a socket, but it's still good to check to make sure there's some force on every single pin.  Needless to say, you (and I. I'm really lazy,heh) should keep a lookout for better SIP pins as these are only temporary fixes and any kind of drop or slamming force could knock a component loose.  I'm also experimenting with crimping the wire before inserting it into the socket, but haven't done it enough to recommend it just yet."
diypedals,322l4w,midwayfair,2,Fri Apr 10 04:45:01 2015 UTC,"IMO: Use a dab of solder, not hot glue, after you're satisfied. If you're giving it to someone else, sockets are a point of failure and hot glue isn't a permanent solution. If you're using it for you, you'll be able to desolder it if you need to. If you're using it to test a bunch of different transistors repeatedly ... well, it probably shouldn't be out of reach of your work bench!"

Digital can accept switches -- and only switches. Analog can accept pots or switches. I think analog pins use up more resources, and most chips are very limited in how many they have. No idea what EHX used here, though. Unless the switch physically moves the pot's wiper to a different pin, playing around with what the switch does won't help. If it does move the wiper to another pin, you might be able to have two pots in there doing different things ... but since you can choose BOTH, that makes it even less likely that the switch is altering what the pot does: you'd have to connect the same pot to two different pins at the same time.

It doesn't matter which you connect to which -- the switch's only purposes is to connect the two lugs of the jack together.  Use a mono patch cable to go to your Boss delay."
diypedals,31ygra,Red0n3,3,Thu Apr 9 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"yes sir!  from what i read some pedals need Normally Open switches, and some need Normally Closed.  I used a Normally Open switch, but if you want to you can get fancy and use a SPDT foot switch along with a SPDT toggle and then flip back and forth between NO and NC options."
diypedals,31ygra,soulagent,4,Thu Apr 9 19:02:51 2015 UTC,Thar is a baller lookin pedal dude. Nice job on that.
diypedals,31ygra,bluelungimagaa,2,Thu Apr 9 04:54:43 2015 UTC,thanks!

diypedals,31ygra,RushofBlood52,4,Thu Apr 9 13:12:34 2015 UTC,Mind sharing how this works? I'd be interested in making one for my DL-8.
diypedals,31ygra,soulagent,6,Thu Apr 9 11:09:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think the DL-8 takes expression input.  Also, it already has tap tempo."
diypedals,31ygra,Jedimastert,7,Thu Apr 9 12:53:28 2015 UTC,"The tap tempo on the DL8 is dumb so I understand why someone would want a separate switch. But yeah, it doesn't take anything that would do that."
diypedals,31ygra,matttothefuture,3,Thu Apr 9 12:59:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, the tap tempo is not ideal, though. I think I just need to upgrade to a better delay if I really want to tap tempo live."
diypedals,31ygra,Angrycrow,4,Thu Apr 9 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"like others have said, it's very simple, just a momentary normally-open switch hooked up to a mono 1/4"" jack.  the DD7 detects when the switch is closed and sets the tempo.  there are layouts all over the internet if you google it."
diypedals,31ygra,Turkeycyclops,3,Thu Apr 9 15:14:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of tap tempo like this will work with a momentary switch. I don't know exactly how, but the pedal itself can detect the opening and closing of the switch. It's incredibly simple.  Something like the DL8 that doesn't have the separate input for it would be much more intensive. You'd have to get really into the pedal if you could do it at all."
diypedals,31ygra,Spaceshipable,3,Thu Apr 9 13:09:19 2015 UTC,Right. I don't think my skill level is even close to being able to attempt that.

diypedals,320bek,Pognas,4,Thu Apr 9 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the smart ass reply, but why not just get a flip flop or something?"
diypedals,320bek,meateoryears,7,Thu Apr 9 19:16:16 2015 UTC,I wear a slipper on one foot whenever I play just for whenever I have to hit those types of switches.
diypedals,320bek,Exr1c,4,Thu Apr 9 19:28:52 2015 UTC,I use my toes for knobs a lot.
diypedals,320bek,meateoryears,2,Thu Apr 9 20:02:24 2015 UTC,Hahaha.  Gotta do what you gotta do brotha.
diypedals,320bek,respecyouranus,4,Thu Apr 9 20:05:32 2015 UTC,buy/build a looper with the switches you like and use that. no need to modify pedals then.
diypedals,320bek,minegoesto11,3,Fri Apr 10 09:21:23 2015 UTC,"The Strymon style switches are nice, they look identical to the loud clicky ones, but there's no click and they're very easy to press. I play in socks a lot too, and my strymon is the only pedal I'm not annoyed by kicking on"
diypedals,320bek,electricalnoise,2,Wed Apr 15 03:39:18 2015 UTC,I feel like it would be easier to just replace the switches with ones that push easier.
diypedals,320bek,electricalnoise,2,Thu Apr 9 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"How doable is that? I'd like something silent and smooth. The big smashable ""buttons"" on Boss pedals are really enticing, but I suppose quieter switches could work."
diypedals,320bek,ChipStevens,3,Thu Apr 9 20:57:00 2015 UTC,Doable. Need to source the switches and find someone who can solder.
diypedals,320bek,MrSparkle666,5,Thu Apr 9 21:17:12 2015 UTC,"He's not wrong, it can be done, but it's not as easy as just buying a different type of switch. You'd have to install a relay bypass that uses a momentary switch. Something like this.   Momentary switches would give you the soft push you're looking for, but if you just swapped out your standard switch for a momentary switch, the pedal would then only work when you held down the switch, that's why you need the relay bypass circuit.  However, I doubt it would be possible to install one into your TC pedals (at least not the mini ones), since their stuff is generally very cramped on space inside, from the ones I've looked in. You would end up having to do a complete rehouse of the pedal, then install the relay bypass and momentary switch. Hope that helps."
diypedals,320bek,ChipStevens,2,Thu Apr 9 23:05:34 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the TC pedals he's talking about already use momentary switches with relays for bypass. The metal part isn't even a real switch. It's just a plunger/actuator that presses on a surface mount tactile switch.   It should be possible to simply desolder the tactile switch and wire in a soft touch momentary switch.
diypedals,31zd1l,Phantomofthesoup,3,Thu Apr 9 09:57:35 2015 UTC,"one of those clamp/magnifying glass things would be super helpful. basic tools, e.g. screw drivers, needle nose. An audio probe is easy to make.  http://www.beavisaudio.com/ http://www.geofex.com/ http://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/"
diypedals,31zd1l,MrBinns,3,Thu Apr 9 13:50:14 2015 UTC,"This: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11784  May seem excessive, but it's amazing.  Also, an adjustable stand led light.  You can get a good one with a long bendable stand at IKEA for $10.  Perfect for small boards.  I also can't say enough about the variable temp soldering iron I got from sparkfun.  $50, and its great."
diypedals,31zd1l,tee_rex_arms,2,Thu Apr 9 14:32:23 2015 UTC,"Set of screwdrivers, pliers, dykes (tiny wire cutters).   If you are going to do your own cases, an electric drill and standard HSS twist bits and step bits. Ideally a drill press.  Get a helping hand PCB/clip vise."
