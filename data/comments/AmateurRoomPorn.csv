AmateurRoomPorn,3djol4,hardypart,2,Fri Jul 17 15:01:16 2015 UTC,"Saying 'millimeters' when you're trying to convey the idea of a very small length is just easier, even for Americans.

There's no common smaller measurement than inches (even if technically one exists, we literally never use it)."

That price definitely doesn't sound too bad for the heart of Manhattan, but someone like me just has too much stuff to ever live like that!

I'm glad you went with the full sized bed even though it left no room beside the bed. That area just gets cluttered anyway.  If you stay a while maybe double up on the under-bed shelving/drawers. It'll jack your bed up higher but sometimes that's cool."
AmateurRoomPorn,3djol4,hmhg,7,Thu Jul 16 21:34:54 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yeah originally I planned to do some serious Ikea hacking to get a bunch of drawers under the bed. But it was getting pricey and I wasn't too sure about my carpentry skills so I went with a ready-made option for now. This bed actually has 2 more drawers on the other side. I nailed 32 felt gliders along the base of the bed so I can actually slide it to access the other side. It's not easy but it offers some longterm storage (all my winter stuff is hidden away back there) without scratching the floor.

AmateurRoomPorn,3djol4,studbeefpile,3,Fri Jul 17 05:37:02 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's the Brimnes. I like it a lot so far. Looks really good and it feels nice and solid, but I've only been sleeping on it for about a week so I can't comment on longterm durability. I don't see why it'd develop any issues, though. The drawers are big and decently well-constructed. I'm using the cheaper Luroy slats and they seem perfectly fine.  Oh, assembly is a pain in the ass -- you'll probably want to set aside basically an entire day!"

AmateurRoomPorn,3djol4,satanspanties,2,Fri Jul 17 18:40:49 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but my partner and I also have the Brimnes (and the matching two drawer chests as nightstands). We've had the set for about six months now, and it's absolutely awesome. The drawers are deceptively large. We use one of them for my partner's videography equipment, and the tripods and such fit in even fully extended.  However, the drawers being so big does mean you need a ton of clearance room to open them up. We mitigated this in a similar way to OP and stored off-season things in the drawers at the head of the bed (which are flanked by the Brimnes chests, and thus un-openable without moving something). But if you have plenty of clearance room, you won't have an issue.  I will say, the drawer handles stick out pretty far and it's pretty easy to scratch your legs on them if you aren't paying attention. But beyond that, we absolutely love the bed."

AmateurRoomPorn,3djol4,tyler3153,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:25:20 2015 UTC,"I have this bed, and I love the storage--the drawers are crazy huge. However, I did find (and this could be a problem with my assembly or--ahem--the activities happening atop) that the bed frame started to separate after about a year. The screws pulled out of the particleboard a bit, making the frame slightly wider, and therefore the slats would occasionally fall through. I was able to fix it with a ziptie (wood glue would probably work too) and it's been fine since, but it's my only problem with it."

AmateurRoomPorn,3bd8ln,kevans2,3,Sun Jun 28 03:01:37 2015 UTC,That looks great. Going for a smaller sink and cabinets was also a good idea. Gives the bathroom more breathing room. Feels like claustrophobic.  Edit: Although you could benefit from having a couple cabinets above the toilet. I only have a mirror in my bathroom like this one (no medicine cabinet) and it's kind of a pain. There's no place to put the things I use on a daily basis.
AmateurRoomPorn,3bd8ln,headzoo,2,Sun Jun 28 04:55:28 2015 UTC,I really dig the accent tile you used in the shower; it really ties it in with the sink and overall design. It irks me the window is off-center but nothing you can do about that
AmateurRoomPorn,3bd8ln,mimi420,2,Sun Jun 28 03:37:55 2015 UTC,There is some white moulding around that window now to finish it off...vinyl moulding so it doesn't get water damaged.

AmateurRoomPorn,3azdlf,laikaislost,14,Wed Jun 24 20:15:06 2015 UTC,It's right next to the door.  That's a lacing up your shoes chair.
AmateurRoomPorn,3azdlf,satanspanties,9,Wed Jun 24 21:51:08 2015 UTC,"Hi all, Thanks for your comments! Here are some answers to your questions: -The paint color is Mountain Stream by Sherwin Williams -The arm chair in the corner gets used- I like to sit in it if someone else is cooking. I can chat with them and relax. i like to sit there and look out at the yard. When my parents visit my dad likes to drink his coffee and read the paper in that chair. The cat likes to nap on it. - The TV in the corner- I bought new sofas last summer and I don't want anyone eating on them.  My housemate travels for work and I work from home so I am alone quite often. Also, I don't have an open floor plan so the TV in the living room can't be seen or heard in the kitchen/dining area. A small TV in the dining room was a reasonable compromise and I have it on if I am cooking or eating by myself. I know it isn't pretty but I like having it there. Thanks!"
AmateurRoomPorn,3azdlf,chiraz25,16,Thu Jun 25 05:39:03 2015 UTC,I'd take out the TV in the corner. It takes away from everything else in the room and kind of ruins the spirit of a dining room. I suspect that this isn't your primary room for watching television and movies so why is it there?
AmateurRoomPorn,3azdlf,FucksGuysWithAccents,7,Wed Jun 24 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"For keeping the game on during dinner, I am guessing."

AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,WhereintheOK,16,Wed Jun 10 13:30:44 2015 UTC,Can you not put the table on the left under the thing on the left wall and turn the end table on the right facing the camera? I feel like it would create more balance.  Also if you painted youd get a nice warmer cozy feel instead of a stark contrast.  Nice though.
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,lemonylol,2,Wed Jun 10 16:12:29 2015 UTC,We had basically the same setup in a darker room. I liked it but also like the contrast currently with the light grey walls.   The black table on left can be moved and looks good as you suggested but it crowds the walkway so isn't as good practically (would bump it often).
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,lemonylol,0,Wed Jun 10 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"If you're keeping the contrast, I think this would look really cool http://muralsandfauxpainting.com/what-colors-old-world_files/after-oldworld.jpg and totally go with the western theme.

AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,chloroformdyas,3,Wed Jun 10 14:41:08 2015 UTC,This room calls for this to be drunk!
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,anml_crusdr,2,Thu Jun 11 00:50:30 2015 UTC,I like it! what is the thing on your dining room table? I can't make it out.
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,striker862,3,Wed Jun 10 15:52:03 2015 UTC,It's a spiral candle
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,striker862,2,Wed Jun 10 17:08:25 2015 UTC,That's a great looking table. What are its dimensions?
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,anml_crusdr,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:24:29 2015 UTC,~42x36x32H
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,DavidAg02,2,Wed Jun 10 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"Nice. I've been thinking of building a table similar in size. I was going to do one that's 60x36x32, and I was hoping that would provide enough space to have a seat at each end.   If four people are sitting down, do you feel there's a good amount of room?"
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,BobDylanBlues,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:19:38 2015 UTC,"It's plenty for 4. We've used it for 6 and while a bit crowded at the ends (partly due to the iron bars so chairs can't pull in), it worked."
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,BobDylanBlues,2,Wed Jun 10 17:26:21 2015 UTC,"oh, I see now...thanks!"
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,mrs_shrew,2,Wed Jun 10 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"I have those same chairs, except in a different finish and mine are from Restoration Hardware. They are a remake of the classic French ""A"" chair which was originally designed for the French navy, so it wouldn't rust while out at sea. When WW2 ended, all those chairs ended up in cafes and pubs all over France."
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,toffeedog,2,Wed Jun 10 21:05:55 2015 UTC,Anything going in those barrels?
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,robynmichelle,2,Wed Jun 10 23:25:25 2015 UTC,"Yes vodka aging in one. Aged beer, cider and gin in others. All 4 have been good so far. Gin was my favorite."
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,cougasaurus,2,Thu Jun 11 04:06:17 2015 UTC,Awesome.  Try some Manhattans or Negronis next time around.
AmateurRoomPorn,39an7a,leefeon,2,Thu Jun 11 06:46:30 2015 UTC,"I love the dark wood and ornaments but I think you could do with a bit of colour, maybe dark orange or green painting or small wall rug to balance out the contrasting walls and wood. Or a plant. I love me a plant."
