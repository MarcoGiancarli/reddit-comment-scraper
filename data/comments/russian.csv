russian,3e3376,Kameniev,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"IMHO. It's about the conflict in Ukrainian, or that is how it is most commonly interpreted. Survkov has a strong interest in post-modernism and political technology, which the story alludes to heavily. It also hints at his ability to control the 'political narrative', Surkov was brought back into the Kremlin fold at the start of the conflict after having left his post a couple years earlier. It's all pretty loaded in my opinion if you have an understanding of Surkov's role within Russian politics.   You would probably interested in short story his 'околоноля'."

She's basicly American, however, she held on to a lot that made her Russian. I don't know if you're girl and my ex will have these traits in common but can't hurt to try.   She loved nature, never drank coffee she always wanted tea, she loved to read and (this may be specific) animie/sci-fi. I never really got her a present but one of the happiest nights we had was when i took her to the airport i fly at. It was night and i wasn't a pilot yet so I couldn't fly her. But she enjoyed seeing all the planes and being in a place (the hanger) we kind of werent suppose to be in. Then i layed out a planet and we just watched the stars. So I imagine full on camping would have been good. Another thing we enjoyed were getting drunk and dancing/singing to up beat happy music. That or maybw a necklace of her favorite animal or a very nice dinner of things you cooked.   So those are my exsperiences and suggestions. Hope they help buddy!"

If you could suggest where you are going to be in Russia and what kind of activity you need then I could suggest what plan to ask for. Usually you just buy the sim with some credit on it and activate the data/call plan on it with service code or via website.  Megafon has good coverage and prices but there are many others.

The SIM pack has a number you text to activate it.  In Ukraine it's slightly different and a lot of the SIM cards now have locking PINs (usually 0000 so not sure where the security comes from there) but that is also on the SIM package or a little car on the inside.   One thing to be aware of is the multitude of different plans, which is why a lot of phones over there are dual-SIM.  I usually go for one which is unlimited text and data with restrictions on calling because if I am talking on the phone it's usually because I received a call.  Then with the data I can facetime voice my family back home fo free.  You pay at the little kiosks you see all over town, you just type in your phone number at the booth and feed it some cash.  edit: you can also get them at MTS/Beeline stores, etc...  Just in the metro they don't always need your visa information which is handy because if I visit friends I usually don't get my visa reviewed by a hotel since I just stay with them, thereby making me technically illegally there.  Also be very aware that Russia intercepts all communications.  Pretty common knowledge since they never got over the whole Soviet Union thing just exercise caution and don't go all shit talking Putin over there.

I recommend you to say the word ""three"", pretty slowly. Your tongue will go from your front teeth to an specific point in your palate to do the r sound in ""three"". When that happens, stick your tongue to your palate and let the air blow out as hard as you can (at least for the first times) so it goes through that tiny gap you left between your tongue and your palate. You will feel your tongue vibrating really fast (after some minutes it can get tingly, haha). Please tell me if you need more help!"

There are Russian accents, sure, but I think most will agree it is not as drastic as the difference from Berlin to Bavaria, or London to Liverpool, or Boston to Houston, or any other such example.   I've read that the normalization of Russian can be owed in great part to the efforts of the Soviets to standardize grammar and pronunciation, though I don't know if that's true or not.

russian,3d6qx4,jojewels92,2,Tue Jul 14 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid (in Russia) we used to play this game where one of the group would go behind a curtain and change an article of his clothing or hair or whatever, and then came back out and we had to figure out what was different. What you mentioned reminded me of it"
russian,3d6qx4,skalafurey,2,Tue Jul 14 03:58:40 2015 UTC,"Never heared of the second game, but the first one is called ""crocodile"" and is a variation of standard charades. In Russia it's played this way:   1) A person stands up in front of others and acts a word. 2) He or she may not use voice to describe the world, only gestures of all kinds. 3) Other players try to guess the exact word that the person is acting out. 4) If someone is close to the word, the acting person might do a ""finger barell roll pointing to the person who's close"" move (can't explain it right), meaning ""try synonyms"". 5) The person who named the word right becomes the next player acting out. The one who just performed silently tells the ""winner"" which word to act out next. 6) The circle repeats.   Mainly, there are no time limits or teams, which attributes to a Russian state of mind: everybody works together to guess the word, so everybody wins.  Any board games, Tag games and card games (particularly, Durak) are popular. Also, depending on her social status, she might prefer House games with dolls and other girls to active games."
russian,3d6qx4,raisedbyowls,6,Tue Jul 14 10:34:34 2015 UTC,Unfortunately modern Russian games are generally tablets and smartphones for such kids. Old games are pretty the same as in US.

I lived for 9 months in places most  people haven't even heard of (cheboksary? aka cheb cheb)? I thought SPb was bad and then i went to the cheb  I enjoy russian history, russian folklore, the russian language is fascinating, etc. etc. But russophiles have some cognitive dissonance that they can't laugh at all the insane, stupid, ass backwards (and frankly deeply prejuduced and violent) cultural and political elements of the economy. Just because i've studied the language and culture deeply doesn't mean that I'm blinded to how fucked up the place is, which is a common phenomenon for russophiles.  I'm an academic too, it doesn't mean people can't joke around. The irony of censoring anything that isn't overtly pro-slavic/russian/soviet is very humorous."
russian,3d4w1y,DoctorCrouchJrWho,12,Mon Jul 13 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"Speakers of every language ""naturalize"" names taken from other languages. English speakers don't say [lʲɛf tɐlˈstoj] either; they call the famous writer Leo Tolstoy instead.  This process is necessary, as most speakers wouldn't be able to reproduce the original pronunciation, and happens virtually every time when a foreign name is introduced into another language.  The point is, it is not supposed to be funny. The speaker who recorded the audiobook would probably be able to reproduce the original English pronunciation if necessary (he must be an experienced voice actor after all), but this would cause unnatural abrupt changes to the natural flow of the text that would negatively impact the listening experience of native Russian speakers."

However, the Russian phrase reads literally ""...she is a deeply faithful person"". We can rearrange the second clause this way: «она — глубоко верующий человек». Better? A=B clauses use Nominative for both parts.  As for the part of speech, it's called participle. They mostly work as adjectives, but have some properties inherent to verbs."

Both are in the genitive case.  The second one is a little bit trickier. I don't want to confuse or write the wrong way of reading this, but in everyday speech I (native Russian speaker) would read it like this: «Как это было в тысяча девятьсот тридцать первом - тысяча девятьсот тридцать пятом годах» (prepositional case). And say nothing where there's a dash, just a pause between words. Or you can paraphrase it and say «как это было с тысяча девятьсот тридцать первого по тысяча девятьсот тридцать пятый год».

I've found writing a daily diary really helps, take some time over it and you can look up grammatical elements and vocabulary you need. Over time this helps improve your production of Russian.   In terms of grammar, the best thing for me was simply to do grammar exercises out of a grammar book. The book our teacher at University recommended was русский язык в упражнениях. You can buy it in the UK (at least in London), but it's also possible to download illegally. Repetitive but forces you to produce Russian sentences and helps a lot with the grammar.    Further to that italki is good. I have never done a language exchange and only paid for tuition. But an hour speaking Russian with a tutor helps no end.

russian,3d0gov,marmulak,0,Sun Jul 12 21:22:51 2015 UTC,"Hi! I understand totally what you are saying. In my opinion, I have realised that the single most important to learn something including a language is love. You need to find your own passion about the Russian language. Some people dream with reading Dostoyevsky in the original language, others fall in love with Russian women, others just want to speak a language which is not another European language.   I have personally found films an excellent way to immerse into the language. You will find here http://livediversified.com/watch-russian-films-in-a-learning-mode/ a selection of nice film to watch with English subtitles totally for free on YouTube. You will also find next to the film link, the corresponding transcript. I learned Russian through films on my own using both English and Russian subtitles simultaneously on the screen. It's a nice way to learn, definitely recommend it! You will also find there more techniques to learn the language.   A good place to start is these videos on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52bRYf198XY. They may look old fashioned but they are of excellent quality, ideal for self-learning. They take you through step by step, and most importantly, the instructor allows you some time to practise new words yourself loudly! This is the key!  And if you want to buy only one book, I would recommend the Penguin russian course! This book is gold! I prefer the old version to the new one http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Penguin.../dp/0140120416/   When you want to practise your Russian, practise it on the street! I was practising Russian vocabulary, verb conjugation etc. on the streets of London speaking LOUDLY. This helped me more than anything else! Leave your books aside and practise loudly the language. For more info on this method, read here http://livediversified.com/walk-speak-russian-loudly/.   If you have more questions, please let me know. I would be happy to help! I am also writing an ebook at the moment, ""How to learn Russian the smart way"". Subscribe and I will share it with you for free when it's ready!   Keep calm and learn Russian!!"

Foreign people are nothing special, I work with a guy from Britain and just today coming home on the metro I overheard two trashed Americans discussing what bar they should go to next :) Since it is a major city, finding work is definitely possible but you will have to look,for sure. Software developing is a good area to be in, check some Russian work websites like hh.ru or superjob.ru - you can kinda scout ahead and see how many positions are available.   Healthcare is fine when you pay for it - a lot of small private clinics that are ""cash-for-service"". The prices aren't too bad. As far as education goes - again, depends on how much money you are willing to pay. Also, St. Petersburg is cheaper than Moscow to live in (rent is lower,groceries,etc).  And you will undoubtedly be hated by some, but there are not too many bigoted people in St. Petersburg. It is a rather progressive city when you compare it to the rest of Russia - lots of young people, lots of bars - noone cares about politics or discrimination or anything like that, but that's just the people that I know.I'm sure there are a lot of Russians who do not share the same views."

You usually hear some Russians bad mouth people from the stans, but European or western foreigners are welcomed.

You either slowly and painfully fade away until the end (which he rejects) or you take risks and live the life to it's fullest (which he advocates), even though that could very likely lead to death (which might happen sooner than if the passive approach is taken). In this sense the final line means that we better ""lead a lively existence"", as you said, even though that will probably cause our demise. Additional meaning of the final line is that our death might leave a mark in history/people's lives, making us reborn (""оживем"") in a way.   It's pretty close to your understanding, but not exactly the same. I feel like your interpretations treat the very existence of death as something that directs the way of life author stands for, something that is always out there and causes the way one should act, while I believe the intended meaning is that even though we ourselves might cause our own end we should take more of a brave way of living.

Моей жене было больно, и сейчас есть грязь на простынях.  Я их разделил.  ""Forgive me, but my wife was sick, and there's now a mess on the sheets.  I've separated them.""  If she's still feeling ill, ask the concierge for directions to the аптека (apteka, or pharmacy), or see if they will run there for you.  Get Висмута субсалицилат, (Russian for the chemical in pepto bismol), or just say ей больно живот (yey bolno zhivot, or her stomach hurts).  You shouldn't have any problem getting a bit of medicine."
russian,3cmh8l,nyetsurprizov,5,Thu Jul 9 02:53:58 2015 UTC,"Прошу прошение.   Прошу прощения.   Моей жене было больно   Мне/ему/кому-то еще больно means feeling the pain, physical or maybe spiritual, it's not important. But it always mean pain, intense enough. If it is said about ills, it means the things are going really bad. For example, you can say 'Мне больно' when your stomach has ulcer, or you broke your leg or you have a massive heart attack. While it is not so very serious we use the 'У X болит Y' form. For example, 'У меня болит зуб', 'У него заболела голова', 'У моей жены болел живот'.   и сейчас есть грязь на простынях   The Russian language has two words for 'now': 'сейчас' and 'теперь'. The first one is used to point this specific current moment in time. And the second one opposites this current moment to the past. Like with 'and' translating as 'и' or 'а'. Your context here is the sheets had no mess before and now they have it. You try to tell others sheets were changed, and the word 'теперь' determines it leaving no doubts what you mean. Also, 'грязь' means a mess when you talk about the general state of things in a room, for example. But the main meaning is dirt and mud, maybe dust, no more. Грязь can be leaved on bed sheets by your dog, who climbed and walked it with dirty paws covered with raw ground. Even in this case, the dog запачкает a sheet, because пачкать is the word to describe something that was clean before and now covered with spots. As there is no noun related with this verb ('пачкотня' can be used to describe a work of a very bad painter or Sylvester Stallone), you need to rebuild your sentence fully, evading the using of a noun here. 'Теперь простыни испачканы' or 'запачканы'. Or it is also possible to say 'Моя жена испачкала простыни'.   Я их разделил.   While you've translated it correct, it is non-understandable, because of this раз-. When you разделяешь something, you have a set and you turn it into many sets acting directly through it. The result sets are absolutely equal, not actually but in your eyes. For example 'Я разрезал кусок ткани'. I've cut a piece of cloth and now I have two pieces of cloth. But there is от-. It can be translated as 'from, away, out'. Look how it changes the sense. 'Я отрезал кусок ткани'. I've cut a piece of cloth out of an other piece. Now I have one piece in my hand because I need it and the other I don't need because I отрезал от него, от, прочь, it is not important anymore, I left it. So, if you use 'отделил', all the sentence is more clear now. Because you literally say, you had a set of all bed sheets, and you separated it to create a set of dirty bed sheets, and you put this new set somewhere far from clean bed sheets. But it is also non-important here too. You can just point where they are. 'Я положил их сюда' or 'Они лежат здесь'. It will implicate they are already separated."

(If anyone calls to ask for a kitten, tell 'em that there is no one left)   But it's not always the case:  - Я послал резюме в 25 контор, но никто не перезвонил. (I sent my resume to 25 firms, but no one called back.)  - Кто-нибудь обязательно позвонит. (Someone will certainly call).  As for ""кто-либо"" it is used more or less in the same way as ""кто-нибудь"" but I would prefer the latter."
russian,3cjal2,sanya-spb,3,Fri Jul 10 10:55:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a native, but I'm not a Russian language teacher, so I'm not sure about some stuff, but I'll try to explain how I feel them.   кое-кто/кто-нибудь/кто-то/кто-либо   Кое-кто and кто-то are probably the same (like ""somebody"", some specific person), but кто-нибудь and кто-либо are a bit different, like ""anybody"" (any person).   кое-что/что-нибудь/что-то/что-либо   Кое-что is used as ""something"" in ""I wanna tell you something"" (""я хочу тебе кое-что сказать""). Что-нибудь is used as ""something"" in ""do something!"" (""Сделай же что-нибудь!""). Что-то is still ""something"", but it used more commonly. It could be ""something"" in ""he wants to tell me something"" (""он хочет что-то мне сказать""), it could be ""something"" in ""That's something!"" (""Это что-то!""). Что-либо is probably the same thing as что-нибудь.   кое-как/как-нибудь/как-то/как-либо   Кое-как is when you do something and don't care about result. Like ""I finished my homework anyhow"" (""я кое-как доделал мою домашнюю работу""). But it could be also when you do something really hard, like ""somehow"" in ""I managed to survive somehow"" (""я смог кое-как спастись""). Как-нибудь could be the same as кое-как or it could mean some time later, one day: ""I'll give you money back one day"" (""я как-нибудь отдам тебе деньги""). Как-то is probably the same as как-нибудь, somehow or one day. Как-либо is probably the same as кое-как, regardless of the result or somehow.   кое-где/где-нибудь/где-то/где-либо   Кое-где means somewhere, in some place. ""I hid my stuff in some place"" (""я спрятал мои вещи кое-где""). Где-нибудь is somewhere too, but it's like you don't care about the place itself. ""Hide your stuff somewhere already"" (""спрячь уже свои вещи где-нибудь""). Где-то is somewhere too, but it sounds like you don't know where the place is. ""He hid his stuff somewhere"" (""он где-то спрятал свои вещи""). And где-либо is probably the same as где-нибудь.   кое-куда/куда-нибудь/куда-то/куда-либо   Кое-куда is used as ""some place"" in ""He went to some place"" (""он ушёл кое-куда""). Куда-нибудь means some place where you're going. ""I'll go somewhere"" (""я уйду куда-нибудь""). Or it could be that you tell somebody to go somewhere and you don't care where. ""Just go somewhere already"" (""уйди уже куда-нибудь""). Куда-то is used to describe the place you went to. ""He went somewhere"" (""он куда-то ушёл""). Or it could be the same as где-то. ""He hid his stuff somewhere"" (""он куда-то спрятал свои вещи""). Куда-либо is somewhere too, but it's like second meaning of куда-нибудь, the place you tell somebody to go when you don't care where. ""Go somewhere"" (""уйди куда-либо"").   кое-чей/чей-нибудь/чей-то/чей-либо   Never heard кое-чей myself, but apparently it's somebody's. Can't say much about it. Чей-нибудь is somebody's or somebody else's. An example would be ""I lost my key. I'll take somebody else's"" (""Я потерял ключ. Возьму чей-нибудь""). Чей-то is probably the same, but it usually means you're talking about stuff you found, but it's not only that. Like ""I found somebody's key"" (""я нашёл чей-то ключ""). Чей-либо is probably the same as чей-нибудь.   кое-откуда/откуда-нибудь/откуда-то/откуда-либо   Кое-откуда is not that common, in my experience. It's ""somewhere"", but you talk about a place where you got something from and the place itself is not important. Like ""it came from some place"" (""оно пришло кое-откуда""). Откуда-нибудь is more common. It's ""somewhere"" too and it's some not-important place too. Like ""I'll get cash somewhere"" (""я достану деньги откуда-нибудь""). Откуда-то is probably the same as откуда-нибудь, but it could be also ""somewhere"" in ""he came from somewhere"" (""он пришёл откуда-то""). Откуда-либо means the same as откуда-нибудь to me.   кое-какой/какой-нибудь/какой-то/какой-либо   Кое-какой means ""some"", like in ""I've bought some fruits"" (""я купил кое-какие фрукты""). Какой-нибудь is more like ""any"". ""I went fishing expecting to catch any fish"" (""я пошёл на рыбалку, ожидая поймать какую-нибудь рыбу""). Какой-то could be the same as какой-нибудь, but could be also ""some"" in ""some thief stole my stuff"" (""какой-то вор украл мои вещи""). Какой-либо is probably the same as какой-нибудь.   кое-который/который-нибудь/который-то/который-либо   All four are the same as какой-нибудь, but какой-нибудь is much more popular. In fact, кое-который is so uncommon, that when I googled it Google said ""Did you mean: кофе-который"". I can't really think of any examples.   кое-почему/почему-нибудь/почему-то/почему-либо   Кое-почему is rare too. Can't think of an example. Others mean ""for some reason"". The most common one, I think, is почему-то.  Overall, they usually mean the same things, but used in different scenarios."

Спасибо за помощь. -thanks for your help (Thanks BECAUSE you helped me). Деньги за квартиру-rent/money for the apartment (Money FOR THE PURPOSE OF rent)  Что-либо для чего/кого-либо is like? one thing is directed at another, i.e., этот тортик для тебя- that cake is for you, место для кондуктора -the place for the conductor, or more naturally, the conductor's seat.  Also, keep in mind that за takes accusative (when it means for, as it can also mean behind/beyond as a preposition of place or motion) and для takes genitive.

russian,3c6gp0,GunaKoren,11,Sun Jul 5 07:51:14 2015 UTC,"Nothing special happens when you add ""можно"" to these verbs, they retain the same meaning as they had before.  ""Говорить"" - to be talking / speaking. Either right now or ""regularly"" (to regularly give some speech, for example).  ""Сказать"" - to tell, to say (to complete the process of saying some sentence, basically).  ""Можно говорить"" - ""you can be speaking right now"", or ""in this building, it's ok to be speaking (at any time)"".  ""Можно сказать"" - ""you can say it"", ""you can express the idea that you have"".  A notable exception is that when you want to tell someone ""Tell me"" (urging him to speak), you use ""Говори"". I don't know why, it's just the way it is. It's sort of like ""come on, start producing sounds with your throat already, don't be silent"". But if you're asking him ""Tell me, is it true that..."" (when you're asking a legitimate question), then it's ""скажи"" (""tell me this particular information"").  And the difference between ""можно"" and ""возможно"" is that ""можно"" is more about being allowed to do something, and also for describing options that you have (""we can do A, or we can do B""), while ""возможно"" is more about physical possibility. You can use ""можно"" in place of ""возможно"", but not the other way around. ""Можно выйти в туалет?"" - correct. ""Возможно выйти в туалет?"" - incorrect. ""Да, это проблема. Но ее можно решить, например, вот так."" - correct. ""Эту яму возможно перепрыгнуть."" - correct. ""Эту яму можно перепрыгнуть."" - correct."

Some other words can't be adequately translated with simply one word and rather require a short explanation, like a vocabulary article.  For example, перебросить is to throw over, not just throw. Чета can indeed be a couple, but it's incredibly archaic and the only phrase where it's used nowadays is ""кто-то не чета кому-то"" (someone is not a чета for someone else), where it means a good match (someone isn't a good match for someone else). ""шило -> Shyla"" is clearly a parsing error. Дымиться is not an adjective meaning ""smoking hot"", it's a verb meaning ""to emit smoke"".

Patience is the most important weapon.  It's necessary to fight patiently,  refuse to accept it and spoil the plans of this plague  until it breaks.""  Some of the phrases are hard to translate literally (like ""гадить"" - it's a verb meaning ""to do bad things"" to someone, to disrupt the peace of someone and annoy them, etc., but this sounds silly in English, so ""spoil the plans"" is fine too).

In a more formal situation, where you're asking about something, it might be more of an instructional or command-type deal('so you'll want to go upstairs and take a left[because that's how you get to the office you're looking for]').   In a casual setting, it could be an indirect way to make a request('you'll want to go upstairs to paint[because there's hardwood flooring up there and you won't make as much of a mess]')  It's worth noting that, in most situations, the idea isn't to try and control someone or dictate their next move(though if poorly executed it could definitely come off tat way).

Additionally, English speakers have a tendency to preface requests with ""can you please (speak a little slower)?"" or ""would it be possible to (send me those documents)?"". In Russian, they usually just use the imperatives ""speak slower, please"" or ""send me those documents.""   So the lack of higher tones in Russian may be partially explained by those two things."

russian,3c0fkv,ruplumograenum,2,Fri Jul 3 17:19:37 2015 UTC,"I'm still getting used to prefixes, but would впасть mean to fall into something, and could спасть mean anything at all?"

Also, it can be used to describe clothes slipping off due to being too big."
russian,3c0fkv,Dissentient,3,Fri Jul 3 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"Впасть is usually used with abstract nouns. You don't normally say ""Я впал в яму"", but it's correct to say ""Он впал в порок / в разврат"" (literally ""He fell into vice / into depravity""), ""Он впал в немилость"" (""He fell into disgrace""), ""Мой дед впал в детство"" (My grandfather fell into childhood — meaning he has grown senile).  The only way you would use впасть with concrete nouns is, I think, when you talk about rivers, and then you use ""впадать"": ""Волга впадает в Каспийское море"" (The Volga river flows into the Caspian Sea).  ""Спасть"" and ""спадать"" are commonly used when talking about something decreasing in volume. ""К утру вода в реке спала"" (""When morning approached, river water level has decreased""), ""Со своей диетой она совсем спала с тела"" (Her body has totally shrunk on that diet)."

russian,3bzhzh,tufflax,14,Fri Jul 3 12:13:09 2015 UTC,"""Я должен"" is literally ""I must"" (I am obligated, I have to). ""I must go there"" - ""Я должен пойти туда"".  ""Должно"" is almost universally used with ""быть"".  One usage of ""должно быть"" is for the same ""I must"" (""I have to""), but with states instead of actions. Basically, if the usual phrase (without this ""must"" element) has the form like ""мне страшно, мне холодно"" (not ""Я сильный"" etc.), then it's a state. ""Здесь игроку должно быть страшно"" (""Here the player must be scared"" (= ""is supposed to be scared according to the author's intentions"")). Scared isn't an action, it's a state. ""Here the player must jump"", on the other hand, is an action, so it would be ""Здесь игрок должен прыгнуть"".  Another usage is ""Мне/тебе/ему, должно быть, ..."" (note the commas!). It means ""It must be [...] for me/you"" in the sense of probability or guess; you can think of it as ""должно быть"" meaning ""probably"", ""most likely"". ""Тебе, должно быть, холодно в горах"" - ""It must be cold for you in the mountains"". ""Тебе, должно быть, холодно, бедный"" - ""You're probably cold, poor thing"".  ""Мне должно"" technically can be used without ""быть"", but I can think of only one such usage: ""Мне/тебе должно понравиться [что-то]"" - ""I/you will most probably like [something]"".  As you can see, English uses ""I/you must..."" for all these situations, whereas in Russian it's two different phrases.  Edit: I was wrong about one use case without commas, I edited it out."

Е sounds as 'Ye' after vowels too, not only at the beginning of word.  Non-palatalized consonant + 'э' combination happens only in foreign words (and often it's still spelled as 'е'). That's why most words use 'е'."

A consonant pronounced this way is called a palatalized consonant. Palatalized consonants have palatal secondary articulation, or two places of articulation, one of which is palatal. They contrast with palatal consonants, which have palatal primary articulation.  Palatalized consonants are pronounced as if followed very closely by the palatal approximant [j], the sound of y in yellow. For example, in the Polish word kiedy ""when"", the letters ki represent a palatalized [k], transcribed as [kʲ]. This sound is similar to the combination of k and y in English thank you.

russian,3bvof9,igrekov,3,Thu Jul 2 15:22:58 2015 UTC,"A lot of these posts are going into the in depth linguistic reasoning. This is good, and they're correct, but as a beginner it's easiest (and in my opinion best) to simply assume that most words you hear are spelled with an e instead of an Э.   The reason that e often sounds like Э in the middle of words is because saying ""ye"" every time runs contrary to how humans communicate vocally: if it can be shortened or contracted somehow, native speakers will find a way to do it. Every word in Russian has but one single stress, and the further that a vowel is away from that stress, the more it loses its sound. The same thing happens in English: we don't say cat-ter-pill-ar, we say CATTrpillr, with most of the vowels swallowed in order to shorten communication time. If this was r/frugaljerk we could talk about the COUNTLESS calories this saves you in a lifetime, but it's not. I hope this made sense, I'm operating on not much sleep."

russian,3bvof9,marmulak,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"True, there may be general tendency to abbreviate in languages regardless of the language. It could be an ingrained function. However, any language could arbitrarily have a rule that certain things must not be shortened."
russian,3bvof9,cjfynjy,2,Thu Jul 2 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"When ""Е"" is put after a consonant, it sounds like ""э"" and the consonant before it is palatalized, or ""softened"" (compare the sound [m] in ""mom"" and ""Mickey"" in English). In all other cases (after vowels, at the start of the word, after ъ/ь...), it makes [je] (""Yellow"") sound.  By the way, the same thing happens with letters Я, Ю, and Ё - they're pronounced as ""а"", ""у"" and ""о"" after consonants and those consonants are palatalized. In school, we called these vowels ""йотированные"" (smth like ""those with jota"").   why are most words using E inside them instead of Э?   This isn't directly related to this rule of pronounciation that I mentioned, but nowadays many loan words are written with ""E"" even though they would be written with ""Э"" according to traditional transliteration. Амбидекстр (also Декстер (the TV series)), теннис, супермен, прогресс, etc. In these words, consonants before ""е"" are not ""softened"". I would say that it looks like a slow emergence of a new pronounciation rule (""е"" being read simply like ""э"" after consonants), but this is definitely going to be a very long and slow process and you should just memorize such words as exceptions for now."

russian,3btvly,bunnyhouseinyoursoul,14,Thu Jul 2 02:48:37 2015 UTC,"Grammatically, it's passive voice in both of your examples. Additionally, ""как говорится"" is a widespread saying in its own right.  Compare: ""люди говорят что-то"" (""people say something"") vs. ""что-то говорится людьми"" (""something is said by people""). It's active vs. passive voice. Passive voice isn't very widespread in everyday speech in Russian, but it's still used, in particular in this phrase ""как говорится"". ""Как говорится"" = ""как говорится людьми"" = ""как говорят люди"". It means ""as they say"" or ""as it is said"", yes.  If you don't specify by whom ""it is said"", then ""как говорится"" is an almost universal choice. ""Как говорят"" (active voice) is correct as well but it's just not a widespread saying. But if you want to say that something is said by a particular person, then active voice is much more preferrable. ""Как говорит наш дорогой шеф"", not ""Как говорится нашим дорогим шефом"" (once again, this wouldn't be wrong, just very rare).  By the way, another popular usage of the passive form ""говориться"" is in the stereotypical essays in literature lessons at school. Students are very often told that it's good style to write ""В книге говорится о..."" (""In the book it is told about..."") instead of ""Книга говорит о..."" (""The book tells about...""). Just for the record, both of these are completely valid, it's just a staple of school essays for some reason."
russian,3btvly,cjfynjy,2,Thu Jul 2 03:22:02 2015 UTC,I found that last bit particularly interesting because American schools (at least the ones I went to) taught that passive voice was BAD and to ALWAYS use active voice!

I'm not an expert on English, but it feels to me that passive voice is used very often in English. I mean, even ""is used"" in this sentence is passive voice, and I wasn't even trying!  In Russian passive voice isn't a bad thing, it just happens for some reason that it's pretty rare (so if you use it all the time, then of course you'll sound weird). And school essays are kind of a thing in itself. Teachers usually teach students what they should write and what opinions they should have on this or that issue, instead of simply teaching them how to write in good style, use synonyms and other expressive means, etc. ""В книге говорится о..."" is a staple phrase. You know, like ""rapid vehicle disintegration"" may be a staple in English. It makes sense and it's popular, but it makes you stop and think ""why the hell would you talk like that?""."

You can not say наконец фильм начинает or Russians will expect an object the film is starting (compare ""I am beginning the trip"" with ""The trip is beginning."")  2) Идея выражается следующими словами  = The idea is expressed by the following words.  If you use выражает then it would sort of sound like ""the idea expresses the following words,"" which is weird.  3) Эта тема исследовалась несколько лет = This topic was investigated for several years. If you wrote Эта тема исследовала несколько лет you're sort of saying ""This topic investigated several years,"" which is weird.  4) От слушателей предполагается знание основной физики = From the audience (listeners) is assumed knowledge of basic physics.

russian,3btvly,cjfynjy,2,Thu Jul 2 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"You're right in the explanation, but not in the name of the phenomenon. This grammatical form is called ""passive voice"" (""страдательный залог"" in Russian). ""Indirect speech"" is a very different thing: it's retelling of some dialogue or thoughts without explicitly inserting a quote (that would be direct speech); for example, this is indirect speech: ""Paul said that he would come to the party"", whereas """"I will come to the party,"" Paul said"" is direct speech.  Edit, one more thing: the example ""Наконец фильм начинается"" doesn't apply, it's a different thing than the other three examples. ""Фильм начинается"" is reflexive voice (""возвратный залог"") which means doing some action to oneself. It's not passive voice (which is about the action being done to the subject). Other examples of reflexive voice: ""Он моется"" (""he's washing himself (he's bathing)""), ""Он поранился"" (""he injured himself""). ""Фильм начинается"" is ""The film is starting (itself, not BY someone and not starting smth else)"".

So that means 408k/year in Moscow and 288k in Saint Petersburg, leaving you with 45k/month in Moscow and 55k/month for other stuff to spend on. That's not bad at all, definitely liveable even if you do not get a single $$$ while you're here.

russian,3briao,Thrille,3,Thu Jul 2 08:12:09 2015 UTC,"I did a month long language program in St.Petersburg at the polytechnical university. I would suggest finding the city you want to go to first, and emailing the biggest university in town that offers Russian for foreigners. Most do this because international students need basic fluency to enroll in a degree program. If possible ask for one-on-one instruction. If you can get heavy days of say 4-6 hours of instruction MWF that's ideal, then you can go explore and meet people the other days. Since I was only there for a month I got a dorm at the school to myself. Total cost for the room and tuition was 1500 USD. Smaller cities would probably be cheaper. Also, if you can learn anything before you get over there it will help immensely. No reason to spend the first month in-country learning the alphabet. Get the basics down so you can dive in when you arrive.    EDIT: Also, if you're gonna be there for 12 months, no reason to stay in one city. I would probably break that up between 2-4 places that look interesting. Good luck!"

Now a lot of people are saying go to Siberia or Moscow or St.P... the decision on how quickly you want to learn Russian is up to you. I chose to go to Moscow and I feel that my ability to learn Russian has been hindered by the amount of friends here whom spoke English.  Therefore St.P, I feel, you will learn Russian very slowly as many people there speak English. While in Siberia nobody speaks English. I feel that Moscow is the happy medium between the two. If you want to emerge yourself in the language go to a school in Siberia because your force to learn or you will... If you want to want to just take lessons and communicate with some Russians, then St.P or Moscow is for you.   I went to Pushkin State Institute of Russian Language. As I beginner I hated the classes and did a lot of self studying. Once I hit the A2/B2 level that was when the really paid off! There is no way I could have learnt Russian without their help. So that is my suggestion for you. Website here: http://www.pushkin.institute/ The price has changed a good bit since I was there. Maybe it wont fit your budget now. But defiantly look into it.

I've kind of been working on my own solution for this on the side a bit, although I went more in the direction of what lingq or ""Learning With Text"" does (screen). When you click on a word, you can enter a note/hint/translation and it offers to look up the word in different services. Also you rate a word, as a visual reminder if you have seen it before or not.  Getting the dictionary form from yandex seems like a really cool idea, although I want to keep my tool a bit more generic than just Russian it seems really handy as in most cases the declined/conjugated form of a word won't have a wiktionary page.

I think vocabulary is exactly the problem with this approach. For example, Russian and Ukrainian languages are fairly close (most definitely closer than Russian and Polish, in my eyes). When I see some text in Ukrainian, I can understand its grammar immediately. A rule or two may be different, but it's super easy to identify which word is a noun, which one is a verb, etc. But the roots of words are the biggest problem: some of them are similar to Russian, sure, but a lot of them are different. So reading texts in Ukrainian feels similar to reading some scientific paper in a completely unfamiliar to you field. It's certainly possible to understand the general ""idea"" of the text, but it's very hard to understand everything written there.  Don't let this discourage you, though, you should certainly give it a try, I think. Just figured I'd warn about this possible problem with this approach. Vocabulary is a big issue, even in languages with the same roots."

russian,3bibqr,trevorma91,8,Tue Jun 30 01:29:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I, for one, strongly disagree with most of that article. The only way I was able to learn a foreign language (out of four I was taught at different points in life), which, as you can guess, is English, when I did it on my own doing it in completely opposite way that this article recommends and how languages are generally taught.   First I got my vocabulary by reading, watching and listening to content in English with a dictionary. I just stopped and searched every time I encountered an unfamiliar word or idiom. I could comfortably read books before I could write anything but simplest sentences.   Then I studied grammar. English lessons in school helped to some degree.   After I got grammar to some serviceable degree, I started practicing writing. Very carefully, by the way. I started writing comments on different websites, but I googled everything and tried to make sure it was as correct as possible before submitting every comment. After some months of doing that I was able to write fluently (as in, without stopping for a long time to think how to write something).   Until this point, I barely ever practiced speech.   Then I went to study to a country where most people speak English and I went from almost 0 experience in speech to fluency in less than two weeks. Yes, people don't realize this, but if you can write fluently, learning to move your mouth afterwards takes so little time that forcing people to speak in the beginning of their studies is a total waste of time.   This experience of learning English made me realize that most language teachers absolutely suck at teaching languages, and they are only useful for teaching grammar."
russian,3bibqr,Dissentient,6,Mon Jun 29 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"And another thing I noticed about learning languages is that many people who thought that it was okay to make mistakes as long as they could squeeze something out of themselves, kept making fairly basic mistakes long after they achieved fluency, and never actually fixed them.   So yeah, there's merit to learning the language ""carefully"" and trying to never make mistakes. This way you'll never end up like those people."
russian,3bibqr,Dissentient,3,Mon Jun 29 18:48:56 2015 UTC,"As for #6,  It is true that if you memorize lots of words from say, a flash card app, you won't know how to use them.  However, I completed a ""learn 5000 Russian words"" flash card app, and while those 5000 words are not all in my speaking vocabulary (of course, duh!) I see them everywhere, and doing this increased my reading speed, greatly.  Every time I see one of those words in a sentence somewhere, or hear it in a podcast or a song, it strengthens the connection. And thus, it becomes learned.  Also, if I could go back and restart my Russian learning from zero, I would have memorized as many words as possible, and worked on increasing my reading speed. Because now that it's not an effort for me to read Russian anymore, and I process a number of words instantly as opposed to reading them. studying has become a lot more effortless and a lot more fun."

I've made an attempt to make general observation based on my own experience of learning English and on what my friends told me. I also tried learning by reading first, but didn't achieve much success. I still think that speaking and listening are more important in acquiring necessary fluency. Yet again, it all depends upon your goals. By the way, which part of language learning did you find most challenging for you personally? All of you described different approaches to learning a foreign language, so I am just curious, what was the ""hardest stone to turn""?"
russian,3bibqr,jettnoir,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:38:42 2015 UTC,"For me - learning grammar (mostly verb tenses) and initial phase of writing practice, where I wasn't sure of anything and had to google everything. My logic was that if I could find sufficient number of google results similar to structure I used, I must be doing something right.   After that initial struggle, practicing writing until fluency was easy.   Acquiring vocabulary was easy, since english is for the most part easy to understand as long as you know meanings of all words in a sentence. I learned words by consuming content I enjoyed.   Learning to speak fluently was the easiest and took very short time."

russian,3bibqr,Rinnve,2,Tue Jun 30 00:02:19 2015 UTC,It's not entirely dumb but usually you really need some feedback. Reading is great for expanding passive vocabulary but does not provide any feedback. It can lead to issues with grammar and active vocabulary later.
russian,3bhbp4,ravelston,6,Mon Jun 29 05:42:12 2015 UTC,For simple questions ли is optional. You can ask a question just by putting a question mark at the end of the sentence. For more long/complex questions using ли helps reduce ambiguity.
russian,3bhbp4,maizecolon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:03:33 2015 UTC,"I see, is it sort of similar to how in English (Australian english at least, my native dialect), one might say 'There beer?', implying the 'is' rather than actually stating it?"
russian,3bhbp4,EdwardRec,8,Mon Jun 29 06:54:50 2015 UTC,"You mean ""Got beer""? Then yeah, that would be ""Есть пиво?"" if you are in a hurry talking to a friend or someone at some sort of party, but if you are talking to a shopkeeper or bartender, I think it's a better idea to say ""Do you have beer?"" (""Есть ли у вас пиво?"")"

russian,3bhbp4,bunnyhouseinyoursoul,2,Mon Jun 29 12:00:15 2015 UTC,I had no idea. Can the rudeness be lessened by being a non-native speaker and acting really polite and humble?
russian,3bhbp4,cjfynjy,3,Tue Jun 30 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. Perhaps I should have been more specific: it's not that the phrase ""пиво есть?"" itself is rude, it's the association of it with a particular type of people who would normally say it. How to explain; you can ask about beer in many different ways, from very formal (with all those ""excuse me, could you please tell me..."") to very informal. ""Пиво есть?"" is an extremely shortened question, so it creates the feeling that the person who is asking it doesn't even bother to ask this question in a more proper way. Additionally, people who talk like this to strangers are usually (not always, of course) gopniks and other such people (gopnik is a wannabe street thug). Such language is a staple of their culture. ""Сиги есть? Сёмки есть? А чё такой дерзкий, а?"" (""Do you have cigarettes on you? Do you have sunflower seeds on you? Wassup with your attitude, prick?"")  So, it has more to do with the intonation and attitude with which this phrase is usually muttered, not with the choice of words."
russian,3bhbp4,bunnyhouseinyoursoul,2,Tue Jun 30 10:24:13 2015 UTC,Your explanation was wonderful. Thank you.  Why do I have a desire to go befriend a bunch of gopnicks now? :)
russian,3bhbp4,dys206,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:06:54 2015 UTC,"It's all in the intonation. You can still make it non-rude with proper intonation (put emphasis on ""есть""). But I guess it's not a beginner's stuff.  Instead consider this:  ""Пиво есть?"" - kind of unfriendly.  ""А пиво есть?"" - totally acceptable in a shop for example."
russian,3bhbp4,EdwardRec,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:37:10 2015 UTC,"Hm... contextually, there is no difference at all. In terms of tone/feel, the latter might be interpreted as a ruder way of saying this, but it also depends on the people around you."
russian,3bhbp4,cjfynjy,2,Mon Jun 29 12:44:46 2015 UTC,"""There beer?"" sounds pretty wrong to me. I understand that it's colloquial, but it's wrong grammar and, in general (not in your particular example, though), can lead to ambiguity, because you omit the verb central to your question. ""Is there beer? Lies there beer? Explodes there beer?"" Crappy examples, but, well, you get the idea.  Omitting ""ли"" isn't wrong grammatically. What /u/maizecolon is trying to say (I think) is that sometimes your question sentence is long enough to be pretty complex in structure, so when you reach the end of it (especially in speech), it may not be immediately obvious that it was a question in the first place. However, if you add the optional ""ли"", it's much more obvious that it's a question, because such placement of ""ли"" only occurs in questions. It's not a particularly good analogy, but it's kind of like asking ""Joe is at home, isn't he?"" instead of ""Is Joe at home?""  Additionally, ""ли"" makes your question just a bit more polite. In your example, ""есть пиво?"" is what you would ask your friend, and ""есть ли пиво?"" is what you would ask the staff at the supermarket."
russian,3bhbp4,Henkkles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:42:31 2015 UTC,"It looks like you don't understand dialectology. It's only wrong grammar in standard English, not in u/ravelston's dialect. Standard English is not the only correct English there is, just like standard Russian is not the only kind of Russian there is.  ""Li"" as a particle has been grammaticalized in many Slavic languages as an obligatory question-particle, but in Russian I've found it to take the ""edge"" off a question, better explanations can be found throughout this thread.  Generally it's bad form to translate two dissimilar sentences with the same structure in L1, so give the course-maker some feedback."

russian,3bhbp4,alphawolf29,2,Mon Jun 29 07:42:05 2015 UTC,"""There beer?"" is short for ""is there beer?"" not ""there is beer?"" which is a statement not a question."
russian,3bhbp4,Osmarov,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:32:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting, never thought I would learn English here as well. In a lot of languages (including Russian) you can make a statement into a question by changing your intonation, such as 'You are /u/alphawolf29?, I thought you were /u/ravelston'"
russian,3bhbp4,alphawolf29,3,Mon Jun 29 13:36:16 2015 UTC,"In some cases you can but in instances such as this you switch the position of the subject and the verb to form a question. ""You are /u/alphawolf29?"" even with intonation is not really correct, but simple enough that everyone would understand you. In fact, native users will occasionally say ""You are ____ ?"" with intonation sarcastically, as a rhetorical question, because it is a statement masquerading as a question. The implication is that it isn't really a question, the speaker already knows exactly who you are and is stating the fact. The correct, actual question would be of course ""Are you ____ ?""  This really only works with asking for people though, the statement ""There is beer?"" can't really be taken rhetorically, so it just sounds like the speaker made a grammatical mistake.   edit: I changed my mind a bit. I think you can use ""There's beer?"" in some instances, but not really as a question. ""You should come to the party. There will be free beer."" ""There's beer? then I will definitely go.""  Obviously the 2nd person isn't really asking if there is beer, because the first speaker stated there would be. This could variably read as ""There is beer, then I will definitely go."" I think this is forming the same rhetorical function as I mentioned above."

russian,3bhbp4,cjfynjy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:57:16 2015 UTC,"About your edit: I'm not a native speaker of English, but it always seemed to me that ""There's beer?"" in that example is possible because it's not a totally ""new"" question, rather it's just a request of confirmation about something that was already said in these exact words.  I was rewatching the first Jurassic Park recently, and I believe there's a dialogue along the following lines: ""- We have a T-Rex. - You have a T-Rex?!"". Dr. Grant isn't asking about the T-Rex out of the blue, it's more something like ""Say again? Did I hear it correctly?"". It's the same as a statement sentence appended by ""..., right?""."
russian,3bhbp4,sieltris,3,Tue Jun 30 10:39:11 2015 UTC,"The explanation is very short and simple.  ""ли"" in ""есть ли"" is optional. It's just a particle that makes the question sound softer (not that demanding)."
russian,3bhbp4,cjfynjy,4,Mon Jun 29 12:04:37 2015 UTC,"One thing I realized long after making my original comment: you can add ""ли"" to the question only if it's a question that can be answered with yes/no.  ""Есть [ли] пиво?"" (""Is there beer?"") - the answers are yes or no.  ""Туда [ли] он пошел""? (""Is that the way he went?"") - the answers are yes or no.  But: ""Куда он пошел?"" (""Where did he go?"") - you can't add ""ли"" here, because the answers to this question are directions, not just yes/no."
russian,3bhbp4,Osmarov,6,Mon Jun 29 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"Not a native but from what I've heard from natives you actually wouldn't use ли there. Memrise is technically not wrong since it is used to make it clearer that it is a question and they want to familiarize you with the concept. I guess you could translate it more like ""whether there is wine"" which in English (I think, also no native English) would be grammatically correct but a bit overkill as well. You can use it in sentences like ""Онa не знaeт, был ли он там."" (she doesn't know, whether he was there) in which case it will be more essential to use."

russian,3bhmv4,Baturinsky,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:38:20 2015 UTC,"I am under the impression that the ""yes"" or ""no"" response to these kinds of questions is the opposite as in English.   This concept confuses me greatly. I will try to explain.  For example, in English:  Imagine Speaker A has a female bulldog, who is a very masculine-looking dog in appearance, wearing a blue collar and blue doggy-hat, when speaker B sees her for the first time.  Speaker B: It's a boy, isn't it? Speaker A: No, it isn't. It's a girl.  or: Speaker B: It's not a girl, is it? Speaker A: Yes it is, it's a girl. or:  Speaker B: It's a girl, isn't it? Speaker A: Yes, it is. It's a girl.  Speaker B: It's not a boy, is it? Speaker A: No, it isn't. It's a girl.  I am told that the 'yes"" or ""no"" responses from Russian speakers will be the opposite as in English, and every time someone explains this to me, both myself and the native Russian speaker who is also learning English become confused.

russian,3bhmv4,nyetsurprizov,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:23:26 2015 UTC,"My Russian friend, also an English teacher,  explained to me that a Russian would give the opposite answer to a question tag than an English speaker would. For example, the question: ""Is is X, isn't it?"" : An English speaker would answer ""yes"" for an affirmative answer and a Russian speaker would answer ""no"". This is why it is so difficult for English teachers to teach question tags to Russian speakers.   Another way: look at the last two questions up there.  In English, we give a positive answer to a negative question tag. i.e. ""isn't it? Yes. and a negative answer to a positive question tagL i.e. is it? No.  I am thinking that Russians give negative answers to negative question tags, and positive answers to positive question tags. but I'm not really sure, I have never fully gotten this concept   I would like if a Russian speaker came along and gave the correct Russian responses to the questions(with tags) to the questions to the dog up there as parallels."

russian,3bgqok,Timchik,2,Mon Jun 29 02:27:18 2015 UTC,Thanks. It makes sense now. (There must be an idiom used in that sentence somewhere...)
russian,3bgqok,Timchik,2,Mon Jun 29 02:47:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's an unusual use of который - definitely not a sentence for beginners. There is a more common idiom - который час? [what's the time?]"
russian,3bgqok,cjfynjy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:17:23 2015 UTC,I know what that is. Perhaps the two uses are related?
russian,3bgqok,VirtualInk,3,Mon Jun 29 03:25:12 2015 UTC,"Here ""который"" means something like ""a lot of"". It's a fancy expression, similar to ""many a year"" in English.  Etymologically, it feels like (though I don't have concrete proof for that) it comes from a phrase like ""который уже век идет? никто не знает"" (""which century is it already? no one knows""). Overall, ""который"" here has a strong feeling of uncertainty. The speaker doesn't know how many centuries have passed, but the exact number isn't important, the number is big enough to be forgotten.  So yes, these two uses are kinda related, although only historically / etymologically - in the question ""который час?"" you are asking directly ""which hour is it?"", and in this sentence, it's implied that the speaker doesn't know which century it is anymore.  An alternative explanation can be that the speaker asks the reader, suggesting them to do the math and see for themselves. ""- Which century is it already? - Err, I don't know, it's a big number? - Exactly, so what did you expect!"".  By the way, ""вот уже который [год/век/час/...]"" (with ""вот"") is a pretty widespread construction. It strengthens the ""already"" part (smth like ""so many hours/days/etc already have passed""). It's pretty common when the speaker is annoyed with something.  Similarly, it's possible to use other question words for the same purpose, although this is significantly more rare. For example, when your Grandma is reminiscing the good ol' days, she might sigh and say ""Ох, сколько лет назад это было"". She isn't literally asking the question, she's just saying that it was many years ago."
russian,3bgqok,supergnawer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:32:35 2015 UTC,"I think the answer lies in the use of a verb, вращаются.  In the case of asking for time, there is no indicated action being taken place over a period of time. Rather, it's a direct question asking for a specific answer (an hour) within a group (hours of the day). (side note: in this case который can be translated as both ""what"" and ""which"")  But if I asked: который час сидишь? The meaning would be ""What hour (how many hours/how long) has the action of you sitting has been taking place?""  In your sentence it is similar: ""What century (how many centuries/how long) already has the action of the oceans, seas and mountains spinning/rotating with the earth have taken place.""  The only two slight differences is the inclusion of ""уже"" (already) which adds a ""up until now/already"" emphasis to your sentence as well as a slight negative connotation. If you exclude уже, the meaning won't change much but the emphasis on the length of time the action has occured (earth's rotation) will be slightly diminished.  So ""который час уже сидишь?"" or ""уже который час сидишь?"" emphasizes the length of time of you sitting there and hints at that time period being a bit too long.  Lastly, your sentence is a statement, or at best, a rhetorical question, whereas my example is a direct question requesting an answer. However this difference doesn't change the meaning, imo.  Hopefully this clears things up for you..."

russian,3bastz,diverstremblings,2,Sat Jun 27 12:44:36 2015 UTC,"Long story short. There was a tzar named Berendey, he was married but didn't have a children. Once he traveled and stopped by a well to drink. Someone (Kaschei) from the well catched his beard and didn't release until the tzar promised to give something that he have but don't know about. When Berendey came back home, he found out that he have a new-born son, Ivan. Many years later Ivan went through forest and met strange old man with green beard. The old man asked him to remind Berendey about his promise. Ivan did it and the tzar told him the whole story.  So Ivan traveled back and found a lake with 30 grey ducks swimming in it. On the shore he saw 30 white dresses and took one. Then ducks turned into girls, put on their dresses and flew away. Only one duck/girl left - it was Maria, Kaschei's youngest daughter. She asked Ivan to return her dress and gave him some advices about Kaschei. Ivan went down to Kashei's underworld kingdom and did all like Maria had told him. Kashei gave Ivan three tasks and prince completed all with Maria's help. Lately lovers escaped from the underworld using Maria's magic, but then lovers separated, because Ivan wanted to visit the nearest beautiful town and Maria didn't. In the town Ivan lost his memory and Maria became a flower from a grief.  As a flower Maria lived in some old man's house, at the same time Ivan and town's princess prepared a wedding. Maria baked a magic cake for the wedding, Ivan's memory returned to him, and the lovers united. They came back to Berendey and got married."

Проворно с постели прянул старик и накрыл цветочек платком, и явилась вдруг пред глазами его красавица Марья-царевна.  – ""Что ты сделал? – сказала она. – Зачем возвратил ты жизнь мне мою? Жених мой, Иван-царевич прекрасный, бросил меня, и я им забыта"".  – ""Иван твой царевич женится нынче. Уж свадебный пир приготовлен, и гости съехались все"".

russian,3b9k50,TheHockeyist,12,Sat Jun 27 02:26:04 2015 UTC,"It's a prime example of how tenses are used in Russian as compared to English. I don't know the name of this phenomenon, but /u/KweB 's explanation (this comment) is wrong.  In English this difference is expressed by Simple vs. Continuous tenses. For example, when you're flying somewhere right now, it's Continuous, and when you fly somewhere regularly, it's Simple. Russian has only three tenses of verbs - past, present and future - without all these ""modificators"" (simple, continuous, perfect). Instead of them, Russian language uses different verbs to convey the same idea, which is exactly what you are asking about.  Бегать is ""to run"" in the Simple tense. ""Я каждое утро бегаю"" - ""I run every morning"" (in the meaning of exercise). Бежать is ""to be running"" in the Continuous tense. ""Я сейчас бегу"" - ""I'm running right now"" (so call me later).  Russian language has a lot of these pairs of words, and they're all verbs of motion. ""Лететь"" (""to be flying"") vs. ""летать"" (""to fly""). ""Идти"" (""to be walking"") vs. ""ходить"" (""to walk""). The explanation of unidirectional vs. multidirectional that the other user provided doesn't hold for all situations, although, admittedly, it can work in some cases. If you're talking about walking somewhere, the choice between ""идти"" and ""ходить"" depends entirely on whether it's ""to be walking (right now)"" or ""to walk (often)"", not on the specificness (is this a word?) of the place where you're going.  Verbs that are not verbs of motion typically don't have two pairs. For example, ""звонить"" (to call on the phone) is the same for both Continuous and Simple situations. ""Я сейчас звоню ему"" - ""I'm calling him right now"", ""Я звоню ему каждый день"" - ""I call him every day"".  Important edit: I've thought about /u/KweB 's explanation a bit more and there's one particular situation where it's completely valid. In the Continuous form (""to be running""), if you're running (or flying, or walking...) without purpose or intent, you use the Simple form (""ходить"", ""летать"", ""бегать""), but otherwise you use the Continuous form (""идти"", ""лететь"", ""бежать""). For example, ""я сейчас бегу от собаки"" (= running away from the dog), but ""я сейчас бегаю"" (= I'm completing my morning running routine around the block). Same with ""я сейчас иду на работу"" (""I'm walking to work right now"") vs. ""Я сейчас хожу по городу"" (""I'm walking around the city now"")."
russian,3b9k50,cjfynjy,3,Sat Jun 27 09:08:22 2015 UTC,"The name of the phenomenon is verb aspect. As you mentioned, English has its own way to convey the aspect of verbs but Russian uses pairs of verbs which are distinguished by imperfective (continuous) and perfective (simple).  Edit: Clarity"

russian,3b9k50,DanGNU,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:05:27 2015 UTC,"I always tought the imperfect form of the verb is for saying something that I'm doing right now, and the perfect form is a kind of future. So I suppose is the same when I say ""Я буду бегать после урока"" and ""Я бегу после урока""."
russian,3b9k50,cjfynjy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"Your example is entirely normal in English, but is kind of exotic in Russian. It's not really about the future, it's about a ""planned event"" of sorts. You can refer to a planned event / activity like that, true, but it's not very common. It's like ""an additional feature"" of perfect verbs, but their main role in the language is the one I described. Planned events can be spoken of differently (with direct future tense); while the difference between Continuous and Simple can't be expressed by any other means in Russian."

To be fair, the explanation through ""whether or not it has an aim / direction / purpose"" does work for a very limited set of use cases, but not for all of them, and this is definitely not the definition of the difference between such pairs of words. I've provided an explanation here.  Edit: There is a particular use case when your explanation is completely valid, I've added it to my comment there."

If I think of how I personally pronounce -ии, there's a slight, almost unnoticeable difference between the first ""и"" and the second ""и"". It kind of sounds like ""-еи"" or even ""-ийи"". In other words, the intonation is changing very slightly in the middle of this long [i:], but it's so subtle that I probably wouldn't even notice if someone pronounced it as one single long [i:].  Edit: I recorded myself saying ""в заведении"" and looked at the spectrogram. The second ""-и"" is slightly different in pitch than the first one, but it's simply because these two letters are in two different syllables in the word, so it's natural that the pitch of different syllables is different."

For example,   читающий - one who is reading, читавший - one who was reading, читаемый - one being read, etc.  Gerunds are used to combine two verbs to describe two consecutive actions or one action during another. They are a combination of adverbs and verbs.   Examples:  Дочитав книгу, он пошел спать. (After finishing the book, he went to sleep.)   Рассматривая экран, он нашел на нем царапину. (Examining the screen he found a scratch on it.)   Those things are fairly grammatically complex and I would definitely not like being one learning them."
russian,3ayx4c,Dissentient,3,Wed Jun 24 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"1 Do all the outdoor sight seeing and street wandering you can in Petersburg before the winter hits. It's not particularly cold, but the wind and rain/snow mix make it miserable walking weather a lot of the time. Different people will want to see different things but the city landmarks in the center like казанский сабор and храм спаса на крови and the big museums like Hermitage and the war museum whose name I can't remember are all must sees. Plenty of old estates and nice little towns a short distance from the city like Petergof (almost all reachable by bus or van from a metro stop on the outskirts of the city).  Obviously visit all the common tourist destinations in Moscow, and since you'll be there in the summer there will be all kinds of events and things in parks. Park Царицыно in the southeast is a large park with a nice estate you can tour, a lot of people miss out on it because it's a bit out of the way.   You need to go to the theater at least once in one of the cities. Back when I lived in Moscow students could get heavily discounted tickets to Bolshoi (in the worst possible seats, but you can't beat paying less than 15$ for tickets to the best theater in Moscow). You'll have to ask around to see if they still do it, but when I did it you had to show up early in the morning to get your name on a list, and then come back with your student ID to claim the discounted ticket.  5 Мастер и Маргарита is pretty simple and a great classic.

russian,3awezb,MegaMudak,23,Wed Jun 24 01:19:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, I hate this stereotype that Russians are cold/assholes/whatever. I have found this to absolutely not be the truth. I'm a chubby, weird, queer looking American with a really strong accent and I have found nothing but kindness in Russia. Friends to hang out with, strangers giving me directions, a lady at a pirog stand giving me a free pie, ect. ect. This is such a frustrating stereotype because it is just untrue.   Secondly, as for resources: I used Master Russian a lot before I had a good grasp on how to conjugate verbs.   I have a Russian keyboard on my phone, it's really handy! If you get a Russian friend you can text with them in Russian. Speaking of apps, there is AnkiDroid, which is a flashcard app. It's very useful for learning vocabulary.   Also, make sure you memorize stress when you learn a word. It's important and if you put stress on the wrong syllable it can be really hard to understand you. In addition to this, while you are the beginning of learning Russian, keep in my the different intonations. It can really change your sentence meaning. Here is a link that seems to go over it pretty well. It may seem strange to stress these little details, but during my first year I - for some reason - just thought it wouldn't be important to learn these things well and it became a problem later down the line.   Anyways, good luck! Russian is really fun and I love it a lot! If you have any questions, feel free to ask!    EDIT: oh my gosh! Thank you for the gold! I've never gotten it before. :)."

If you are looking to find the most useful language, you are not looking in the right place.   Russian the language is not just about the grammar, spelling, gerunds, the 9 cases, or whatnot. It's about the culture. The poetry flows like no other language I have tried learning. Pushkin and Dostoevsky make the most spectacular pieces of writing for the soul. The music is diverse and is lost in translation.   Once you learn about the facets of Russian culture, you become a part of it. Russian is like a second part of me. I would consider myself a different person if I didn't grow up learning Russian. I can't imagine myself without it and I can thank my parents for taking me to Russian lessons and making me participate in Russian plays and camps.   If you learn Russian, you can connect to people with a Russian background on a whole new level. You don't have to, but it sure is an experience.  I'm glad you are enjoying this experience.   TL;DR: Russian is a culture, a way of expressing yourself and not just a language."

russian,3awezb,maizecolon,7,Wed Jun 24 01:41:10 2015 UTC,I don't believe that Russian is any more or less complex than English is. It is just different and you are not used to it. Same goes for any language really.
russian,3awezb,Philias,5,Wed Jun 24 05:26:02 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a way to assess the difficulty of learning a language, but you've got to take into consideration the difference between the learner's native language and the language one wants to learn. For example, I believe English speakers will have trouble with a whole new alphabet (as well as a new keyboard layout), a new phonetic system, word order, and some others. Russian is certainly harder for English speakers than, say, Spanish, but not harder than Chinese with all those characters that can only be learned by heart.  So I'd say that maybe Russian isn't any more complex than any other language as you say, but I'm certain that languages differ in the amount of time and effort you have to put into studying."

russian,3awezb,little_lamplight3r,3,Wed Jun 24 14:43:41 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Most all languages are complex in their own ways-  some are easier to learn for different language learners (e.g.- French for Italians, Dutch for English speakers, etc.)  I think there is a perception that English must be a simpler or ""easier"" language, because so many speak it.  The reason English is spoken by so many, though, is because it's spoken by so many! If that makes sense.  The popularity of the language makes it a necessity for many to learn, and also the fact that it is so popular means that there is a huge wealth of resources to aid in learning.  Not to mention, you are peppered (or even showered...) with English nearly everywhere you go in the world.  Russian speakers see and hear English all the time, on product labels, the internet, movies, songs, etc.  The converse is not true.  A native English speaker can go his whole life without ever being exposed to Russian."

I read this word as ""Pah-Tahm"" but its read as ""Pah-Tom"" I have no idea why its O in this word and not ""ah"". Going to do some reading tomorrow.   This is a very common explanation, but I personally feel that it's not quite right to say that ""О"" can sound like ""А"" (""ah"" in transcription). It's much, much closer to the sound [ə] which can be found in lots of places in English - combinations of letters like ""er"", ""ur"" usually produce this sound. For example, the last sound in ""theater"" is this sound. However, in Russian there's no such letter that makes this sound by default, so in all Russian linguistic literature, it became common to explain it as ""kind of like ""а"""".  The rules here are simple: if the vowel is stressed, it sounds like it's normally supposed to sound (for example, [о] here). If it's not stressed, it produces a ""weaker"" sound: this [ə] for ""о"", a softer version of [ə] for ""е"", etc. It's also not wrong (though not exactly right as well) if you just pronounce everything with default sounds (""о"" for О everywhere, for example). It would be quite a funny accent though.  Overall, I'd say that this whole situation with ""О"" isn't really a rule of pronounciation / reading words, it's more about the accent in which unstressed vowels sound like that. This accent happens to be very very common."
russian,3awytx,cjfynjy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:57:52 2015 UTC,"in my learning book there is an explanation which is like:  you have three stress levels for vowel the stress itself the lowered stress level 1 which is the vowel befor the stressed vowel and the lowered stress level 2 which is every else vowel for О the stressed level is ⁠ɔ, the stress level 1 is ɐ and level 2 ə  for example in молодёжь the first о is stress level 2 and the second stress level 1 which means according to the book it is pronounced like: məlɐˈdʲɔʂ  But i have the feeling that the pronunciation of the unstressed vowel really differs between russian speakers (maybe dialectal?) because in the youtube videos,podcasts and series which i use to improve my russian, for example as far as i heard it, some pronounce the unstressed О the whole time as ə, others as ɐ and others like i described above.  but thats just my opinion as a beginner"
russian,3awytx,KippieDaoud,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:16:14 2015 UTC,"you have three stress levels for vowel   Interesting, this never occurred to me (I always felt there's only two levels). Perhaps this is more noticeable in some dialects and less noticeable in other ones. Thanks for this, this is an interesting observation indeed.  In any case, my point was more about the fact that ""о"" / ""а"" isn't really a pronounciation issue. It's more about accents / dialects. For example, in English the letter ""u"" can sometimes make the [a] sound and sometimes the [u] sound, and this is a rule of pronounciation. Similarly, in Russian ""т"" in ""лестница"" is silent, which is also a rule of pronounciation. But the whole deal with [о] vs. [ə] (and vs. [ɐ]) is on another semantical level, so to say. It's a finer detail, a more advanced concept, so to say, than the problem of ""how do you read this letter""."
russian,3awytx,cjfynjy,3,Thu Jun 25 10:37:14 2015 UTC,"The ""Ы"" sound doesn't exist in English. Don't stress over it, you'll get it eventually.  Pronouncing ""O"" as ""Ah"" is optional in most cases. There's a thing called ""Vologda accent"" when native speakers almost never do that."

russian,3awytx,ruplumograenum,2,Wed Jun 24 05:12:59 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Welcome to the nightmare language!  I'm not an expert myself, but your first point is due to stress. It's extremely important to know the stress in Russian, (infamous one is ""писать"") I believe when the ""о"" is unstressed, it'll be pronounced as ""a"". Obviously, it's a bit more in depth than this but that's the general idea.  I think what you mean by your second point is due to cases. I can't really explain in depth here, but cases take a but to get used to.  And finally, the third point. Yup, you'll confuse them. Sometimes, at work, i just sit there and look at an English word for a few seconds before I realise   it is, in fact, English (sounds stupid, not as stupid as starting to actually talk to someone in Russian, only to realise they don't understand a thing you're saying)  I wish you the best of luck!"
russian,3awytx,mcrbradbury,2,Wed Jun 24 04:33:47 2015 UTC,"Wonder if it will mess with my English reading.   Don't worry - English is so hard-wired into your brain that this isn't going to happen. After all (silly little example forthcoming), you haven't confused h for ん in spite of your Japanese, right? :) Reading is an automatic behavior; this takes time to develop, obviously, but in the case of English, you've had your whole life to do it, and your brain is already fully capable of discerning individual words and phrases right off the bat rather than going through it letter by letter. This will happen with your Russian, too, in time. (As you say yourself - it's a rewiring of the brain.)  There will be a small amount of minor confusion from time to time as you acclimate to Cyrillic, but in my view this is sort of a rite of passage for Russian learners, and the worst that ever happens is you'll be writing an English word that starts with ""d"" and write ""g"" (like handwritten д), shake your head, laugh, and move on. Sometimes the wires even get crossed twice - пусский (instead of русский) is a mistake I've seen more than once.  Anyway, congrats on getting started! Enjoy the ride."

Kinda worried about when I actually do start to identify P as R and E as Yeh. Wonder if it will mess with my English reading.   Nope, all russians have to deal with latin alphabet on a daily basis and none of them have one creeping into the other."

russian,3awytx,KippieDaoud,0,Thu Jun 25 08:19:00 2015 UTC,"I read this word as ""Pah-Tahm"" but its read as ""Pah-Tom""   Look, there's a simple rule of thumb. You don't reduce stressed vowels. In ""потом"" the first ""о"" is not stressed so you can reduce it to ""a"" and the second one is stressed, so you can't because the word will sound totally different. You don't have to reduce vowels if you don't like it, it's something lazy people invented who had trouble moving their lips.  There's also E -> И in words like ""телефон > тилифон""  This whole vowel reduction thing is just a dialect. AFAIK it's called the Moscow dialect which spread throughout much of Russia (big cities mostly) that's why it seems like it's standard, but it's not."

russian,3asor7,bunnyhouseinyoursoul,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:11:56 2015 UTC,"My reading and listening skills have increased drastically.  It's worth it because there's really not many other tools like it.  Many people think they can learn through just DuoLingo and Anki cards, but if you learn through podcasts, you learn the language in large chunks and in their natural environment.  I listen to the podcasts and I read the dialogue along with it.    There's other tools like writing correction and live lessons, but they cost extra and I haven't used those.  It kind of sucks needing an internet connection to use it though.  However, it comes with a free app that's actually pretty complete.  Sometimes I review the SRS flash cards on my phone.  According to my profile, I've done about 130K + words of reading and about 69 hours of listening.  If I can hit 250K words and 350 hours of listening by next year, I'll be happy for the time being."

russian,3anc4j,cjfynjy,3,Mon Jun 22 10:56:16 2015 UTC,"In the early to mid 00's, many Russian emails (especially those at @mail.ru, I think) were hit by a surge of meaningless spam coming from the sender ""Фокс Йовович"" (different email addresses, but always the same name; sometimes Ф окс Йов ович and other such obfuscation). You would receive these emails fairly often, like maybe once every few days or so.  Each email had a subject made out of two words from the dictionary thrown together. I don't remember if the text of these emails was empty or had a spam link. The words in the subject were usually fairly grim and morbid (never vulgar or explicit, just, you know... words that could be used in sad or creepy contexts).  Your list of words somehow reminded me of Фокс Йовович's emails because of this exact property of the words. You know, for example, something like ""стремительно отмывание"" or ""выделение выбывать"" could very well be a subject of such an email. :)  Don't take it as a criticism of your list, it was just a funny observation. I somehow assumed that you're a native speaker, and Фокс Йовович's emails are very well known among the ~ 20-30 years old Internet-savvy population here."

The only case when ""штатский"" is a noun is in the phrase ""в штатском"", which simply means ""in civilian / plain clothing"" (when you're talking about some secret agent under disguise, ""in plain clothes"").  The English noun ""the civilian"" (someone who isn't a military person) is ""гражданский"" (which is a noun, even though it totally looks like an adjective). ""Не стрелять!

I mean, don't you find the phrase ""Давайте, девушки, проходите, не задерживайтесь"" perfectly natural and normal?  Of course there are probably people who would find this phrase hilarious.

Returning to the question whether ""А ну-ка"" equals ""Давайте"" (and throwing away that matter of ""давать"" with regard to females) - it is practically the same, but ""Давайте"" can be used even in official speech, while ""А ну-ка"" has a buddyish (or overbearing) flavor"

I would suggest you to consider the option of buying a local SIM card to use during your stay. Most mobile carriers throughout the country have okayish mobile data plans. This will save you from the insane roaming prices of your own carrier, protect you from possibly insecure public WiFi networks (or a lack of them), and give you at least some access to the Internet, should you need it. I find that it's incredibly helpful to be able to connect to the Internet when you're away from home.  On second thought, you have to show a proper Russian ID (passport) to buy a SIM card (= to sign a contract with the carrier). But, depending on where you're staying, it's easy to buy a ""second hand"", pre-activated, SIM card."

russian,3abiqk,flyerfanatic93,15,Fri Jun 19 01:53:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it will be of any help, but this word is pretty ""logical"" when you take into account how it is constructed.  The very ""core"" of this word comes from ""щит"" - literally ""shield"".  Add ""за-"", and you get the word ""защита"" - ""defense / protection"". Of course, it's a totally new word, but you can see how it comes from ""щит"" historically. ""За-"" here brings the meaning of ""behind"", so it's about putting something ""behind shields"".  ""Защищать"" is the verb made from ""защита"", meaning ""to defend / to protect"". Compare how in Russian usually verbs are constructed from nouns, while in English it's usually the other way around.  Let's make a verbal (?) adjective from this verb: ""защищающий"", meaning ""the one who defends; defending"".  Now we'll put this word into a suitable grammatical form. As you probably know, things that are expressed by prepositions and context words in English are expressed by grammatical forms in Russian.  Consider the sentence ""Think of people [who are] protecting the Homeland"". The corresponding grammatical form here is formed by changing the ending -ий to -их: ""защищающих"".  Finally, we change this word so that it means ""[of those] protecting themselves"", not just ""protecting something else"". It's done by adding the postfix -ся to the word, which historically comes from ""себя"" (""oneself""). Here's our end result: ""защищающихся"".  I mean, of course it's a tricky word, I'm not denying it, but every part of it is there for a reason. Think of it as a part of the sentence squished into one word: ""[of] those [who are] protecting themselves"" = ""защищающихся""."

""Смотря на супермаркет, она думала о людях, запертых внутри и защищающихся от зомби.""  ""Looking at the supermarket, she was thinking of the people locked inside and defending themselves against zombies.""  If you want, защищающихся can be replaced with обороняющихся (100% the same grammatical form, comes from the word ""оборона"" = ""defense""). They are very, very close synonyms, I can't even think of any situation right now where you should use one of these words but not the other one."

Still, it's the only possible reading that results in coherent words.  But even though all of these words make sense individually, together it's absolutely nonsentical. It's not even a sentence with a grammatical mistake in it, it's like a set of random words thrown together.  My best guess is that it's a machine translation from some English phrase, or a translation done by a very incompetent person. Additionally, it looks like the tattoo sketch was then drawn by a person who doesn't know Cyrillic alphabet as well. The letters that have Latin ""equivalents"" (С, Т, К) are drawn in that typical fancy Gothic style, while the ""exotic"" Cyrillic letters are drawn very differently.  If you really want to know, this tattoo roughly ""translates"" as ""Of the bride it will be till the end"". No sense whatsoever."

Russian language is not special for having unique words that don't translate well. Every other language has that too.   Obscenities are hard to translate because they have a very high volume of implied meaning per word, relative to regular language. Again, not really unique to Russian.  Why obscenities are socially unacceptable, is because they are low class language that you use when you aren't good with proper words. That's the reason parents discourage children from using them - for children it's easier to just speak like that, instead of learning. Now, when someone mastered proper language, obscenities don't have to be totally tabooed, they have their uses. Even in books and such. It's about moderation. People mostly scoff at overusing them or using them improperly. Sort of like the way this guy ended the video was totally lame."

russian,3a6dqu,bwowm,7,Wed Jun 17 16:11:50 2015 UTC,"In Russian I believe that you need to add an a if you are female.   No. Many names are like that, yes, but then there are names that don't end in -а and -я. You know, Любовь, Руфь (very old-fashioned) and many others. Also, a lot of non-Slavic names aren't like that. I know a girl named Мариам, for example.  If you're talking about ""translating"" the name to Russian, then historically indeed many names were slightly changed to fit the Russian grammar. For example, Jeanne -> Жанна. But that's not the recommended way of translating names anymore, even in historical contexts. Especially not when it's your real name and it's a social network.  Lastly, VK doesn't care anymore about whether or not your name is real. If anything, it allows you to input your name in Latin alphabet if that's how it is originally written. So if you're Ann, you can just write Ann there, not necessarily Энн or Анна.  Edit: re-read it and realized that you're talking about the last name (SURname). Derp. In that case, no, don't change it at all. Foreign surnames are never changed. If you're Macdonald, don't turn it into Макдональдова or something.  And, just for the record, there are plenty of females with non-Slavic surnames in Russia. Not only they don't have -а, but they're also not declined. So if you're Александра Шмидт, you'd be Александры Шмидт, Александре Шмидт, etc., instead of Шмидта, Шмидту, etc (but! male surnames of the same form are declined)."

That Linda is a citizen of another country who happened to marry a man with the surname Ivanov; of course, by the laws and traditions of that country, she would take his unchanged surname. But in informal settings and conversations between friends, I'd say it's acceptable to call her Ivanova, especially if she understands the whole grammar of Slavic surnames.  Then again, the whole reason why foreign names were often ""adapted"" in the past and surnames weren't was because surnames aren't mentioned all that often in speech. When you're talking about someone, you mention that person's first name all the time, unlike the surname."
russian,3a6dqu,cjfynjy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:08:15 2015 UTC,"She's talking about last names, like Ivanov becomes Ivanova, that sort of thing. But this only happens for names of Russian origin, names of foreign origin stay the same."

russian,3a6dqu,cjfynjy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"It's something like ""Hi there motherfucker"". Obscene and very, very slang-y (with mistakes on purpose). ""Здарова"" is mangled ""здорово"" (""hi"", ""hi there"", an informal greeting). ""Уёба"" is an alt form of ""уёбок"" (but genderless, I'd say) which you can roughly translate as ""motherfucker"" (or any other obscene word related to a person). It can have a range of undertones from kinda good ones (sort of like a criminal version of ""my bro"") to bad ones (an outright offensive word).  ""Привет, хуйло"" (note the comma that should be there) is the same thing really. ""Привет"" is ""hi"", ""хуйло"" is also something like ""motherfucker"". It's also very negative in general, but it's not impossible that two ""bad guys"" would call each other like that as a form of greeting."

russian,3a2zvc,bwowm,5,Wed Jun 17 03:47:37 2015 UTC,"His father was born in Moscow and left to England in 1924 after Lenin died; however, since his mother was English what ended up happening is that his Russian never really developed, and one can even hear he doesn't roll his R's. He says as a result Russian isn't his native language, but it is possible he picked up fragments of it from his father and developed it later in his life. He has a strong accent with some mistakes in pronunciation, grammar, and emphasis, but in general it is very good for a foreigner as he does use noun cases (albeit sometimes he doesn't :P) and is talking about an intellectual topics which is VERY challenging"
russian,3a2zvc,_Karagoez_,4,Wed Jun 17 04:39:06 2015 UTC,"Talking about an intellectual topic for an hour is less impressive than you suggest. What it requires beyond the usual knowledge is simply mastering the vocabulary words and stock phrases associated to the subject. And giving a talk that is a more or less one-way conversation simplifies the task further. I could lecture for an hour in Russian about research-level technical material (and be understood), but I often have trouble following an ordinary conversation on the street between two other people.   I am not saying what he does is easy, but the challenging issue is not being able to talk about topics that you do not expect even most native speakers to discuss. It is knowing the grammar well enough to use it fairly correctly (to be understood without causing native speakers to cringe at the number of mistakes). When that ability is grafted onto an unusual vocabulary list it comes across as pretty surprising, but I'd say it is less so than it seems. The really challenging matter is using grammar mostly correctly in real time, which is independent of the subject of the talk."
russian,3a2zvc,chebushka,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:12:53 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I am much more impressed when I hear non-native speakers of a language spontaneously using idioms and metaphors in the language with zero or negligible mistakes.

The few conversations i had where were usually about food because she was constantly trying to feed me. The food is amazing and natural, no perservatives and stuff.

It's kind of an advanced concept, so you shouldn't worry much about it - I just figured I'd clarify this. Usually it's used in slightly oldfashioned texts (especially Soviet ""semi-official"" texts like newspapers) and when you want to be fancy with your language. The types of usage given in the Russian wiki are definitely ""fancy"" language.

russian,3a1n8h,Gohte,4,Sun Jun 21 11:20:42 2015 UTC,"My tip is more of a reality check: your plot twist (impress others in August) is not realistic based on where you are at now. The level you want to be at needs time and you don't have enough of it left before your trip. You can wish all you want to master hard stuff in a short time, but it's hard in large part because it takes so long to make measurable progress.  Students who take a semester of Russian are hardly at a stage to talk to people about anything much more sophisticated than ""I am reading the book"" (okay, that may be an exaggeration, though I think there's a ring of truth in it)  and you want to do better than that in half the time.  Hmm.  Okay, being able to say anything at all in Russian when you are in Russia may surprise native speakers you meet for the first time (if what you say is understandable), but the surprise will quickly go away when it's clear you can't hold a conversation.  To do that you not only need to learn a lot of words, but how they fit together to express ideas or seek information, and with hardly any knowledge of vocabulary and no knowledge of grammar at this point you're not going to zoom into conversation mode by August.  After all, when people speak back to you they are going to talk normally, which uses the full range of grammatical possibilities, and there's too much of it to master before your trip.   How about this analogy: do you think you could master calculus in a month and a half, starting from just knowing high school math?"
russian,3a1n8h,supergnawer,2,Tue Jun 16 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"How about this analogy: do you think you could master calculus in a month and a half, starting from just knowing high school math?

That's neat"""
russian,3a1n8h,colorjxe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, maybe ""master calculus"" was too strong and I should have said  ""understand calculus"" or ""be able to use calculus."" I do not consider myself fluent in Russian (I may have to think about the grammar or pause to find the right choice of words), but I can have conversations with another person in Russian and I did not feel comfortable doing that after studying it for just one semester.  A big problem with speaking is that you have to know Russian broadly enough to understand what the other person is saying back to you, so that for instance when they say ""Hey, I didn't know you are learning Russian"" you can know that's indeed what they are saying (instead of so many other comments you could imagine) and then give a reasonable reply instead of looking at them with a puzzled expression.  If you can get to the stage of being able to talk to people they will indeed be impressed and intrigued.  But it is a big uphill climb and a month and a half is just not enough for you to practice and learn what you need.  I've met a few people who started taking a Russian class because of a partner or spouse and they have essentially all given up before the first semester ended; the learning curve for the first year (and the second) is really steep, and if even the structure of a classroom environment is not enough to keep those highly motivated people on track, compare that with what you want to do in a shorter timeframe.   Of course a difficult challenge requires sustained dedication and hard work, but it also requires time and you don't have enough of it before your trip.  You have enough time to learn some important key phrases, but there isn't enough time to learn and practice as much as you'd need to really demonstrate that you are learning the language and not just a few stock phrases to get by."

russian,39x61e,hubo85,2,Mon Jun 15 18:29:16 2015 UTC,I have a couple questions about studying in Russia.   I would like to the the non-degree Russian program at Saint Petersburg State.  http://russian4foreigners.spbu.ru/node/172  I'm wondering if I necessarily have to have a student visa to enter the program. I have a 3 year multi-entry tourist visa with only about 8 months on it. I'd rather not lose the visa.   Is it the case that in order to enroll in a university you must be on a student visa or can someone on a tourist visa enroll? I've emailed the program but haven't received a response.   Thanks to anyone who can help!
russian,39x61e,nyetsurprizov,3,Mon Jun 15 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"I am not certain, but I would guess that they mainly care about your ability to attend lessons (which you can do on any visa).

Either way, your friends now sound to me like 90% of them are arseholes :P  As for the reasons, you've already mentioned three; another good reason to learn a Slavic language (although not Russian specifically) is that it will make it easier to learn other Slavic languages in case you need it.

For example ""I dont eat meat"" means that I don't eat it now, and I won't in the future, and presumably I haven't been eating meat for awhile.  Or another example, ""I don't lie"" means that telling the truth is a part of my character - you can rely on me not lying now, and not lying in the future.

I would work a bit on your л's and м's. They shouldn't rise up and stick out like that - they should be the same height as the и.  Your п's and к's look a bit too similar.  There's a bit of a problem when you're making the tail on the д and у - you appear to go to the right. If you hurry too much, your у might look like a ц. So go straight down on the tail and try not to go to the right, only to the left when you make the loop.  Other than that, I see no difficulties in your writing.

russian,39as3c,Ready-2-Fire,6,Wed Jun 10 14:09:30 2015 UTC,"What I usually do is how I actually began my Russian learning way back. I memorized all of the main grammatical tables for verbs, adjectives and nouns and spent a week doing that, writing down which endings go together and so on. Then I got the most common 1,000 words list readily available online and started memorizing them by taking the English words, writing a silly paragraph using something like twenty words and then translating it to Russian to the best of my abilities. Once I had around three hundred words committed to memory I would start reading easy readers, for example Zlatoust's 650 and 1300 vocabulary-word readers and others that came with audio CDs. I would write down the new words in a notebook while reading a page, look them up having read the page and then reading it again.  I suggest that you find yourself a conversational partner before I did, around after you've studied for at least three months. You can buy a cyrillic keyboard relatively cheap or you can just create a layout using the Serbian layout as a base.  A studybook is not a bad idea either, though I only tended to read the grammatical explanations and chapters. I've heard great things about Penguin's Russian Course though haven't used it myself. Also Colloquial Russian 1 and 2 should get you somewhere.  Also learning the alphabet was piss easy, at least for me. It took me a bit less than an hour."

Agree with drklrdpcky, if you open any textbook for English speakers who want to learn Russian the first chapter always introduces you to the Cyrillic alphabet. There will be a bunch of exercises which will go through the alphabet and help you learn it. The whole first chapter of The New Penguin Russian Course for instance is dedicated to learning the alphabet. If you don't want to fully delve into reading and writing, just do the exercises from this first chapter. Though reading and writing help your speaking a lot.  Also I would say if you want to speak Russian and speak well, knowing the alphabet is pretty much essential. Makes it a lot easier to learn new words, etc."

Just get a notebook and some index cards to do the exercises and help memorize the alphabet and vocabulary. Say everything outloud as you go through the exercises to work on pronunciation.  Listening to people speaking the language has also been a huge help for me. I've really enjoyed following VICE News' Russian Roulette series. You can hear plenty of people speaking Russian (probably some Ukrainian in there too), but it is usually subtitled, and the journalist, Simon Ostrovsky, narrates in English what's going on so you don't feel lost. I like it because you get to hear very raw conversational speech. It's not prewritten dialogue like you would find in movies, although those are certainly worth your time.

It's definitely an example of the vocative case.  Other examples that are older but have stuck around in various phrases are usually religious in nature.  Боже from Бог, Господи from Господь, Отче from Отец (as in The Lord's Prayer, ""Our Father, who art in Heaven"").    Unrelated, but here's an interesting look at other ""cases"" that exist in Russian.  Deviations from standard cases that follow their own rules.

russian,3971tp,ruplumograenum,5,Tue Jun 9 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"There are rudiments of locative, partitive and vocative, but everything else is particular usage of them and 'standard' cases.  And the old vocative and the new one are not related, it's totally new thing."

Even though you can technically ask ""чего"" instead of ""что"" (and put the words in the corresponding grammatical case, like ""погоды"" instead of ""погоду""), I feel that it's actually partitive case used here, like ""Купи хлеба"", that sort of thing. You're not waiting for some particular weather, after all, you're waiting for ""a bit of weather"", sort of. And you're not waiting for ""this particular unique tram"", you're waiting for the ""event"", ""phenomenon"" that is the arrival of the tram.

Here's an explanation I found:   Глаголы ждать, ожидать управляют родительным (кого, чего) и винительным (кого, что) падежом. Родительный падеж - при сочетании с отвлеченными существительными или конкректными, но употребленными с оттенком неопределенности: Я жду автобуса Мы ждем поезда (любого). Я жду любви, как позднего трамвая. Он ожидал удобного случая.   Винительный падеж - при сочетании с одушевленными существительными или неодушевленными с оттенком определенности: Я жду сестру. Я жду автобус № 20 (именно этот, конкретный). (любого, какой подойдет, на такой и сяду). Мы ждем поезд № 132.   If you look up the phrases ""ждать автобуса"" and ""ждать автобус"" in the Russian national corpus, the results seem to support this explanation:   Неизвестно же ― есть он или нет; идти от трамвайных улиц каких-нибудь полчаса, и никому в голову не придет, сойдя с трамвая, ждать автобус, который неизвестно ходит ли, хотя остановки приколочены.   versus   Встретились. Стали ждать автобуса. А его все нет и нет.   In the first example, the addition of ""который неизвестно ходит ли"", to me, seems to add some определенность.  In the second example, we are simply waiting for a bus, not the bus.    This obviously isn't a separate case, but it's a noteworthy unique situation that comes up with the ждать verbs.  For a native speaker, of course, you just ""feel"" this.  But non-native speakers don't have that sense for when it's кого/чего versus кого/что, and rely on rules and patterns.  This verb, at first glance, seems to just not have any rules.  That's why it's worth taking a specific, closer look at."
russian,3971tp,cjfynjy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:33:18 2015 UTC,"Hm, that's a good theory with определенность (English: ""particularity"", perhaps?). It's what I was trying to express with my words about ""some particular %thing%"" and ""just any %thing%"", but more formal. I think I agree with it.  However, in the examples with автобус and трамвай, to me определенный трамвай would be exactly that particular one. You know, maybe there's only one yellow tram in the whole city, and I want to get on it. There may be other tram cars on this same route, but I want that one. Мама, сестра and other examples are definitely ""unique"" individuals; трамвай №20 isn't really a unique object. But this particular yellow tram is a unique object. In fact, from my experience, people often say ""жду трамвая"" even when they're waiting for a tram with a certain number.  Very good parallel with a / the there, btw.   it's a noteworthy unique situation that comes up with the ждать verbs   Ugh, this is kind of a pet peeve, but I wish that Russian language got rid of such random ""exceptions"" that are there for no other reason but historical. It really messes with the more or less finely defined grammar and makes the language illogical. Same applies to other languages."
russian,3971tp,jboehmer17,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:13:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you were on to something, that it's about whether we're talking about something specific or not.    I think in the situation where someone is waiting for a particular tram, but says ""жду трамвая"", it's not that they're saying they're waiting for any tram, but that, in this sentence, they're speaking in a more general sense, not specifying which tram they're waiting for.  It's almost like they're speaking more about the fact that they're standing here waiting, rather than making it a point to tell you what they're waiting for in more specific terms.  I'm not sure if I'm explaining this idea very well.  Gramota.ru has a few different definitions of different usages of ждать, but this one seems to show what I'm saying:    кого-чего или с придат. дополнит.* Оставаться, находиться где-л., зная заранее о каком-л. предстоящем событии. Ж. поезда. Ж. рассвета. Ж. своей очереди. Ж., когда перестанет дождь. Мать ждёт не дождётся возвращения сына"

Then what would you say is the source of the 'new vocative'? Is it actually new, or have Russians been using it all along and the term exists just to differentiate it from the 'old vocative'?"
russian,3971tp,ruplumograenum,5,Wed Jun 10 00:51:20 2015 UTC,"The old vocative started to die around XI century, in  XIV—XV centuries it was used only as respectful form, and in the middle of XVI completely out of usage.  The new vocative was developed from nominative (by reducing ending to zero), first mentions starts to appear in XIX-XX, and it still is not 'approved' by academic guys as a new grammatical category.   So, it is actually new and have 2-3 centuries between old and new cases :3"

I now understand that the so called vocative is created from vowel reduction from the nominative, but do other Slavic languages do the same? Ukrainian officially uses the vocative, but it seems to implement it in a very different and traditional way."
russian,3971tp,very_cool_username,2,Wed Jun 10 03:08:22 2015 UTC,"Some of them have retained old vocative (evolved from that one in Proto-Slavic).   Slovak had lost vocative too, and according to wiki is emerging new one, «presumably under the influence of the Hungarian language for certain family members or proper names» in it's own way.  I don't know much about it."
russian,3971tp,ruplumograenum,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:36:55 2015 UTC,"I'm learning Slovak, so I can confirm: the vocative is not taught as a separate case anymore and grammar books mention only few forms such as bože and otče, like in Russian. However, I hear frequently the new vocative ending in -i, especially with female names (like Zuzi for Zuzana and mami for mama)."
russian,3971tp,TheHockeyist,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"The vocative in the South Slavic languages is different than this ""new Russian vocative"". It has at least been retained in Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian, Macedonian has some leftovers of it, and I don't know about the rest.  The form is basically (for Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian): You add -e for male names, -o for female. For example, Roman would be Romane in vocative, and Ana - Ano. You can also use it for last names - if they end in ""ic"", which is very typical in those languages, it changes to -icu.   The case also exists for other nouns, but I think only ones that refer to people (it would make sense). For example: brat -> brate and devojka -> devojko.  Macedonian doesn't have any cases (or technically only nominative), but it being my native language I would use some of the forms I mentioned, but not always. I actually can't think of a rule, and I think both forms would be accepted (with or without vocative).  I don't know if the old Russian vocative is the same/similar. I assume it would be, and probably same in Ukrainian. I guess most Slavic languages use the ""old"" form. But I'd be happy to be corrected if I am wrong. I know very little about West Slavic languages, I guess I should go look that up."
russian,3971tp,TheHockeyist,3,Wed Jun 10 13:18:45 2015 UTC,"Other examples that are older but have stuck around in various phrases are usually religious in nature. Боже from Бог, Господи from Господь, Отче from Отец (as in The Lord's Prayer, ""Our Father, who art in Heaven"").   Yea I read that too, and that the reemergence is based on those examples above.  Tbh I don't know much about it either. I read about it here and watched a Russian movie that helped confirm it.   edit: the article you sent me is blowing my mind"

russian,3971tp,maks_orp,2,Tue Jun 9 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"Yea I understand, I just think it's interesting how the vocative permeates into the language even though it's  not part of it in any official capacity. I was always taught that there are 6 and only 6 cases in Russian."
russian,3971tp,kaneua,6,Tue Jun 9 19:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely messy when you ostensibly have 6 cases, but the language still has a bunch of signs of older usages and forms.  In addition to vocative you have partitive genitive (пить чаю, а не чай) and locative (в лесу, а не в лесе).  In general these are taught to Russian learners as exceptions, but they do have their own origins and patterns."
russian,3971tp,Dissentient,3,Tue Jun 9 19:22:10 2015 UTC,"locative (в лесу, а не в лесе)   It's interesting that в лесе is the preferable option when talking about forests in context of graph theory or computer science, at least where I live (forest is a set of trees; tree is an acyclic connected graph). I would always say «компоненты в лесе DFS» or «в лесе, полученном удалением первого цикла». Choosing «в лесу» feels wrong, because it would mean ""actual"" forest with trees made out of wood, not vertices and edges."
russian,3971tp,Quattron,2,Tue Jun 9 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'd say that ""в лесе"" would also make sense if you're talking about some very particular forest (made of real trees). ""В лесу"" to me is similar to ""на воздухе"" or ""взаперти"" - it tells something about the environment about you, but it doesn't matter in which forest you are or where exactly you are in it. ""В лесе"" feels more precise, for example if you're discussing how to extinguish some forest fire or something like that."
russian,3971tp,Dissentient,2,Tue Jun 9 22:43:36 2015 UTC,"As the other redditor said, absolutely not. Those forms are only for addressing people directly, and thank you for asking the question, otherwise I wouldn't have thought of that!"

You shouldn't use it, unless you specifically want to sound fancy (it can backfire, and people might think you're a pretentious prick). Sometimes it's also used in law texts (still rarely, but more often than in regular texts). And sometimes it's used in ""lists"", like ""either ..., or ..., or ..."". In terms of meaning, либо and или are absolutely identical words.  Also, the postfix (?) -либо, when used with pronouns like что, кто, где, etc. (что-либо, кто-либо, где-либо) is identical to -нибудь (что-нибудь, кто-нибудь, где-нибудь).   EDIT: and ни   Ehh... ""Ни"" is an entirely different thing that can't really be translated to English on its own without context. Off the top of my head:   In constructs like ""Ни вода, ни огонь, ни [...]"" = ""Neither water, nor fire, nor [...]"" - a list of negatives ""Что [бы] он ни делал, огонь все горел"", ""Куда ни посмотришь, везде темнота"". ""Whatever he did, the fire still burned"", ""Wherever you look, it's darkness everywhere"". So here ""ни"" is roughly translated as -ever in those words. Rule of thumb for differentiating between ""не"" and ""ни"": if you're making a negative of something, it's ""не"": ""Этот цвет не красный"", etc. If you're NOT denying anything (like in these examples I gave), then it's ""ни"".

The scientists reported that Lykova spoke a language “distorted by a lifetime of isolation” that sounded akin to a “slow, blurred cooing.” This unusual speech led to the misconception that Lykova possessed little intelligence. Later, after observing her skill in hunting, cooking, sewing, reading and construction, this original misconception was revised. Wiki"

If you know звонить means ""to call"" and you want to say you just called someone then you have to use the perfective form позвонить, so of course you need to know позвонить right alongside звонить.   Asking if it's useful to learn aspectual pairs separately is almost like asking if it's easier to learn all the declined forms of a noun as separate words (assuming you know all the cases already) instead of knowing them together as all the forms of a single noun.  Anyway, there is no magical elixir that is going to make this topic easy. A lot of practice is needed no matter what else you do."

It looks like this:  1 00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,009 Выстрел, скоротечность этого процесса не подвластна человеческому глазу.  2 00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:18,802 Вспышка и хлопок длятся буквально доли секунды.  3 00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:27,410 Но порой эти доли секунды отделяют мир от войны, жизнь от смерти.   Of course people don't do this by hand, the best free program I know is Subtitle Workshop. Just get the portable version 6.0b  http://subworkshop.sourceforge.net/download.php  In the program you load the film file (mp4/avi/mkv) - which you can download from youtube or from the rutracker torrent site and the subtitle file if you have or make a new one. Then you can write the subtitles in the window bellow, basically you write a subtitle and then choose where to place it in the film. I would write a few sentences from hearing and then play the movie and place the start and end of each subtitles using the buttons or shortcuts  (Alt+C,Alt+V).

Disciples series - an interesting take on the HoMM formula, 2 is often considered the best in the series, 3 has grown from an absolute shit release to a very decent game with expansions. King's Bounty - another take on HoMM, mostly focused on the RPG/hero progression element, doesn't take itself too seriously. HoMM 5 - while not Russian IP, both the main game and the expansions were developed by a Russian studio Nival. Eador - another turn-based strategy game in a fantasy setting. Hope you aren't getting sick of those. Prime World - a MOBA by Nival. Honestly pretty meh. Блицкриг/Blitzkrieg series - WW2 strategy, pretty fun. Silent Storm series - WW2 tactical squad based TBS, think Dawn of War 2. IL2 series - one of the best WW2 flight sims ever made. Individual games seem to vary in quality, but I'm not an expert in flight sims so not going to suggest any specific ones. War Thunder and Star Conflict - dogfighting simulators set in WW2 and sci-fi settings, respectively. Both free to play, both very decent. Космические рейнджеры/Space Rangers - a sandbox space trading game. The controls are pretty basic, but there are very deep economics and RPG systems below.  Звездные волки/Star Wolves - a space RTS with tactical pause, customizable units and full 3D movement. A really interesting concept that never got executed too well. Магия Крови/Dawn of Magic - a Diablo clone with a very deep magic system, but mediocre everything else.  Everything by Ice-Pick Lodge - deep, often ""art house"" games, very dark, very interesting. Just hold off on Pathologic until the remake is out - this time they have translators that are actually competent. Ex Machina (released outside Russia as Hard Truck Apocalypse - WHY) - a car-based, think Mad Max-style, postapocalyptic RPG. Cool item mechanics. Xenus  - Far Cry 3-ish open world RPGs with a huge world and lots of things to do. 2 runs like shit on absolutely anything, even top end hardware from 2015. TimeShift - an FPS involving lots and lots of time manipulation.    If you don't mind ex-USSR:   STALKER series (GSC Game World, Ukraine) - post-apocalyptic survival horror RPG set in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. All three games are good, each in their own way. Huge modding scene, MISERY for Call of Pripyat and Lost Alpha (free, standalone) stand out in particular. Казаки/Cossacks series (GSC) - from the same developer as STALKER, a completely different game. Historical strategy set in the early 1800s. Metro series (4A Games, Ukraine) - another postapocalyptic FPS, much more on-rails than STALKER, based on a book by a Russian writer. Extremely good graphics, especially on Redux editions, though OpenGL versions lag behind the Windows one. World of Tanks (Wargaming.net, Belarus) - an arcadey tank shooting game. The developer is also working on World of Warships and World of Warplanes.   Edit: community suggestions:   Vangers - a postapocalyptic ... RPG ... thing. Really weird and unique. Демиурги/Etherlords series - HoMM meets Magic The Gathering. Have you noticed that Russian developers really like cloning HoMM? Sea Dogs/Корсары series - a pirate RPG. Makes up in character and style what it lacks in polish and gameplay. Perimeter - another game by the team behind Vangers, with another very unique setting, loses a lot to mediocre RTS mechanics and balancing.   I think that's all I have for now.

Hence there's no preposition like ""до""/""в""/etc.)   to be bribed to perform an abortion - быть подкуплен сделать аборт?   Быть подкупленным сделать аборт; получить взятку за то, чтобы сделать аборт. The first variant is closer to your original text, the second one just generally sounds much much better in Russian (literal translation is ""to receive a bribe to perform an abortion"").   to be given AIDS-infected blood transfusions - дать СПИД-инфицированных переливании крови ?   Not дать, but получить: you have ""to be given"" here, not ""to give"". If you're given something, then you take this something. Also, you have issues with cases of words here: ""Получить СПИД-инфицированные переливания крови"" is how it should be. (Получить кого/что? переливания). Instead of ""СПИД-инфицированные"", it's probably better to use ""инфицированные СПИДом"" (because even though you can connect words like that in Russian, it sounds artificial and like an unnecessary loan construct).   people who are pro-life - люди за жизнь?  pro-choice - за выбор?   Yes, but also direct transliterations ""про-лайф"" and ""про-чойс"" are widely used, especially in spoken language.   bodily autonomy (or something with a similar meaning of ’a woman has control over her own body’) - ?   I don't think there exists a Russian equivalent of it that would be a single word or a term. Your best bet is to simply change your original sentence somehow. ""Право распоряжаться собственным телом"" (the right to decide what happens to one's body) can be useful to you.   to have a baby - родить ребенка?  single mum -мать-одиночка?  the foetus is viable/viable foetus - жизнеспособный плод?

russian,37h645,horizoner,8,Wed May 27 16:33:20 2015 UTC,"Literally, it tranlates to ""this is what the question lies in"" (""in"" as in ""inside"") = ""this question [lies] in this"".  ""Вот"" is a word used for emphasis and bringing attention to the thing you're talking about, it can be translated as ""here is"", ""that's"", etc. (in this particular sentence, it's ""this is"").  ""В"" (in/inside) is very often used in such constructs with the words ""вопрос"" (""question""), ""смысл"" (""meaning""), etc. In Russian, we say that the meaning/question is ""located inside"" something, not just ""is"" something. Compare: ""Вопрос в том, стоит ли так делать"" (""the question is whether or not we should do it like this""), ""Так вот в чём дело!"" (""So this is what the whole fuss is about!""). Also: ""В чём соль?"" (very colloquial) = ""в чём смысл"", ""в чём суть"". Because of this usage of ""в"" in such cases, a punny answer to the question ""в чём соль"" is sometimes given as ""в солонке"" (""inside the salt shaker"").  Regarding this:   From what I read, I thought that чём translates to than, not then (it's not temporal?)   You're mistaking ""чём"" [tchyom] (used here) with ""чем"" [tchyem]. ""Чем"" means ""than"", indeed (but it also has a meaning ""with what"" when it's actually the word ""что"" put into the corresponding case). Ё is very often substituted for Е in written Russian; usually we only put the dots over ё when otherwise there would be serious confusion in the sentence. In fact, I had to go back and edit all the ""чём""'s in this comment now because I didn't even think twice about writing ""е"" here."

russian,37h645,cjfynjy,4,Thu May 28 03:57:38 2015 UTC,"If you can read and mostly understand the quote from Shakespeare that you provided, I'd say it's a very very good progress for just one week of learning.  Regarding ё, yes, you'll very rarely see this letter in published books and Internet posts. If you see the word ""тезка"", for example, it's obvious from context that it's ""тёзка"", because the word ""тЕзка"" (with ""е"") doesn't exist. Once you learn enough Russian words, you'll just start ""recognizing"" that it's not some unknown new word in this example, but simply ""тёзка"" written without the diacritics over е.  Nowadays, we use ё in writing only in children's books and language teaching books (probably also some academic papers about linguistics). And, like I wrote above, in situations where otherwise the reader could be confused. For example, ""мёд"" means honey, and ""мед"" can be a slang word for a medical university, so if they're used in the same sentence, it's a good idea to put the dots over ё in ""мёд"".  As for when you should use е instead of ё - literally everywhere (see above), but it wouldn't seem weird if you use ё anyway. It's probably better for you to use ё now, in any case, when you're still learning the language."

Right now, I'm using a similar program to practice my reading and listening.  It's called LingQ.  It's just a matter of finding the right content.  I really enjoy it.  It's only $10/month.  I personally think LingQ is better just because Learning With Texts doesn't have a library.  To tackle grammar, I reference sites such as masterrussian.com, russianlessons.net, and russianforfree.com (this site also has American comics на Русском!).  If I look at a word, I might have an idea of the declension and I reference the page to check.  Speaking is difficult, because I don't really have a lot of people that want to practice with me, unless I go through Skype (which varies in results).  So far, I've listened to the lessons on LingQ plenty of times, that I can read them out loud.

russian,3757ts,Ass_cunt_666,1 point,Tue May 26 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"You're right in this case. I'm an English speaker natively. The thing is, in the context of English speakers learning Russian, they need it to be somewhat grammatically correct in order to grasp the concept. But, Russian is weird and doesn't directly translate to proper English in a lot of scenarios. It is very important to maintain the structure of the Russian version of the sentence when translating to English for the purposes of grasping the concept of cases and natural Russian word order. Yes, it would sound more natural to put the ""for us"" at the end of the sentence, but it might confuse a Russian learner. For example: if you say ""I really like cake"" (Мне очень нравится торт) the literal translation is ""The cake is very liked by me"" or ""For me the cake is very liked"". It shows you that you are the indirect object in this scenario and the subject of likeness is the cake. Yes, it would sound more natural to say ""I like cake very much"", but it doesn't work that way in Russian. Same goes with ""thank you"" (спасибо тебе) or ""a thanks for you"". It just helps the English speaker understand Russian grammar better."

russian,3757ts,Sinhasa,1 point,Fri May 29 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"It is grammatically correct, but a native speaker probably won't construct the phrase like that. I don't know if you're familiar with what Russians call logical stress, but the thing is, if you want to accent something, you generally place it at the end of the sentence. So in ""я покупаю напитки для нас"" you're specifically stressing that you're buying drinks FOR US, not for someone else. This effect is achieved by placing the ""для нас"" part at the end of the sentence. If you just want to state that you're buying drinks while also informing that they're for us, then I suggest going with the standard ""Я покупаю нам напитки"".  Also куплю and покупаю are different tenses and state of completeness of купить. Куплю is ""I will buy and finalize the action"" while покупаю is ""I am buying [and am in the middle of the action]""."

You will be learning to speak Russian through thirteen children's stories. This course is for all ages. You might think that because it is so fun, only children can take it...THAT IS FALSE. Adults can take it. I encourage you! There is audio from a native russian speaker. You will learn over 1000 words. This is a serious effort at learning Russian. Each new word you learn will allow you to progress along the stories. The vocabulary is cumulative. That means that chances are, the vocabulary learned for the earlier lessons will be used in the later lessons.   I do warn you, this course will take more to get through than the one you took. You will have to be motivated. It is also done in a better way than most of the endless vocab list ones. It helps you go through 13 short stories. Microphone quality sucks (You can still hear how the words are meant to sound) but at this point you shouldn't need the spoken part as much as you used to, you should be able to sound it out yourself."

Сидеть has a different meaning altogether (that is to be sitting, be currently seated, as opposed to ""sitting down"" as in the act of going from standing to sitting).  Gramota.ru, as well as any other Russian dictionary, lists садиться and сесть as an imperfective / perfective pair."
russian,36z574,jboehmer17,0,Sat May 23 15:19:51 2015 UTC,"That Gramota.ru doesn't say anything about verb aspect.  Here is a page about the сесть/cидеть verb pair, Master Russian also has a handy list of some verbs to get you started.  *EDIT: I don't think Russian dictionaries will list pairs because the concept of ""verb pairs"" doesn't actually exist in Russian.  It's just a helpful way for us English speakers to wrap our heads around verb aspect.  If you're going to use a Russian language dictionary for learning, it might be helpful to know that несовершенный вид is Russian for ""imperfect aspect"" and совершенный вид is ""perfect aspect"".

russian,36z574,Rusty_Gadget,1 point,Sat May 23 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know about совершенный and несовершенный вид.

Викисловарь does it as well.  Akademik too.  None of these or any other Russian dictionaries I've seen list сесть and сидеть as a verb pair.

russian,36z574,veruha,1 point,Sat May 23 12:26:30 2015 UTC,"I have a few comments below already, but wanted to give a more complete answer directly to your question.  Садиться and сесть are an imperfective / perfective verb pair which both mean to go from a standing position to a seated position.  Here's an English language Wiktionary entry for садиться (checking out the Russian version of the page is a good idea, though, for more info).  Сидеть is a different verb altogether, which means to sit as in to be in a seated position, rather than to go into a seated position.  I don't know enough to explain the odd discrepancy between сесть and садиться, but from what I can tell reading around a bit, they have different etmyological roots.     I think it's worth mentioning a couple of other words that sneak in there with these sometimes.  Садить, посадить, сажать.  Садить and сажать are synonyms, though I believe садить is considered to be of a lower register, both imperfective, matching with the perfective verb посадить.  These verbs have many different uses, such as planting plants (садить, though a lower register, is more commonly used to talk about planting) and putting passengers onboard some transport, but in general all have a common theme of sort of ""sitting"" something somewhere.  Which is where you can get the idea of садиться (being reflexive you can think of it as ""садить себя"") as being ""to sit yourself [down]"".  Also worth mentioning that сажать / посадить is also used to describe putting something into captivity.  If someone was thrown in prison, you can say ""его посадили в тюрьму""."

I can't even describe the plot though, not without making it sound boring!  Пленный (2008) - another one I watched for the above class. Based on a really good short story by Vladimir Makanin, it's about two Russian soldiers who take a Chechen boy prisoner in order to get them back to their convoy. Not a war movie, despite the setting.  Gagarian, first in space (2013?) - This was surprisingly good - it's all about how Gagarin went from being like, in the potential pilot programme (I don't even know how to describe it, like, all of the people who could have been the first man in space if they'd been chosen) to becoming the first man in space.  Stilyagi (200...7?) - musical, which may not be to some peoples tastes. Set in late 50s, early 60s Russia, about the young ""hipsters"" of the USSR who listened to American music and dressed in American styles...really interesting to watch too, I'd never even heard of the stilyagi until I saw the film!  Yolki (2010?) - Best to be watched around New Year, but you could watch it now for the hell of it. It's a six degrees of separation style thing - how the lives of six different people in Russia interact without them realising. Set on New Year's Eve, Medvedev has a little cameo as himself. It's a really sweet little film, sort of a Russian Love Actually, and they made a Yolki 2 and Yolki 3  And then of course, all the ones that have already been mentioned - Leviathan, Metro, Night Watch, and so on :)  Edit - spelling, final sentence on rusalka added  Edit #2 - also, брат (2000?). It's about a soldier who comes home from war, and heads to the city to find his older brother, who's fallen in with like, a mob type group, and how the younger brother sort of gets involved in this. Also really good - was another film for my Gender class, and the lecturer even commented that every year, all the students say how much they enjoyed watching брат."

I'm an English speaker who knows intermediate-ish level Russian and is still trying to learn Georgian. Russian is your friend and is useful, but I'd at least start off by asking if they speak Russian in Georgian.   I'd really go bother /r/sakartvelo, but key phrases for explaining you don't speak Georgian - phonetically, at least:  me ar vlaparakeb kartuli. - I do not speak Georgian. (v is virtually silent)  laparakeb rusulad? - do you speak Russian?   me vlaparakeb rusulad - I speak Russian. Add 'magram tsudad' for 'but badly', and accompany with self-affacing smile.   It kinda puzzles me why you'd be sent to Tbilisi for learning Russian, as others have said - not many younger folks speak Russian or learn it to any standard. The older folk do, and most restaurants/bars/etc will have staff that can speak Russian and English - but both are (usually) as second languages, so won't be... native standard.   But seriously, please, please at least ask people if they speak Russian in Georgian. Attempting that one sentence will get you a load more good will than just assuming people speak Russian. And if they don't (I speak from experience of getting quite lost in rural Imereti), they'll find an older person who does who can help you.   If you want some more Georgian vocab, PM me and I'll provide more stuff I know in the morning, but I'm a learner myself. Best rec is to head over to r/sakartvelo. :D"
russian,36okqc,chickentrousers,15,Thu May 21 01:25:13 2015 UTC,"Why would someone put that stipulation on a trip to Tbilisi? You won't be able to speak Russian with anyone under the age of 25 or so. Many people will not even want you to speak Russian, as things have gotten fairly tense of 2008.  If you're just getting into Russian it also seems unrealistic to be sending you on a trip where you can't speak any English. Russian is so different from English -- immersion can be helpful once you know what's going on, but I don't think dropping you into this situation is going to do you any good.  Anyway, moral here -- break the rules. Try your Russian with the older people you meet and keep at it. Many older people in Tbilisi speak limited-to-no English and these experiences will be helpful for you. But I would just enjoy Tbilisi, which is an incredible city, and see if you can find people who are willing to practice Russian with you while you're there.  When you've studied a bit more and are feeling more confident, take an extended trip to Russia and your Russian will blossom."

I was there in  2011 and in any major interaction we started with English and when they seemed confused, we would ask if they preferred Russian. 100% of the time they switched to Russian with a sigh of relief, but the key was to not shove it down their throats.  I think it's quite condescending for your program to send you to Georgia and tell you no English, only Russian.

A lot of people might refuse to speak Russian if you ask straight out. But if you show them you respect their language and are aware if the fact that Georgia is not Russia (a fact your program coordinators seem to ignore) they will be OK with using it for the sake of communication.  Another important thing to do is to not speak English. Be tough, perhaps lie at times. But stick to your guns. Read children's books, tell yourself stories in Russian in your mind. Be tough, keep your eyes on the prize.  Third thing, do go to Russia or Belarus and learn Russian there. Georgia is probably great, and you can learn the basics there. But there are very few native speakers there, and people will most likely make mistakes. So you need to go to a place where clear Russian is spoken to make sure you don't start with a flawed basis."

Most people under 30 speak English. People over 50 may understand Russian, but they won't speak it unless they (or their family) are ethnic Russian. Their is a lot of tension in the region.  The operators of the bathhouses spoke Russian - that was my only encounter with the language for six days in Tbilisi and the surrounding areas.   Armenia is a better choice, although still poor. I was in Dilijan and Sevan. Russian was fairly common.  That said, if you want to practice Russian abroad their are exactly five countries you can go to - Russian, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Ukraine. In my experience, these are the only ones where Russian is available as a first or second language."
russian,36okqc,kaisermatias,1 point,Thu May 21 10:18:25 2015 UTC,"Like noted younger Georgians have a limited knowledge of Russian. However if you stay in Tbilisi anywhere you go they will know enough to help, seeing that despite the war there are lots of Russian tourists in Georgia. As such service staff and the like will know a little Russian, and English (though it is indeed limited).   It is definitely advisable to pick up a bit of Georgian phrases, as it will make things far easier for everyone, and the locals like it when foreigners use their language.  The phrases listed here are a good start, and I'd also suggest going to /r/Sakartvelo for any more advice, as we are happy to help in any way we can."

So this corollary you asked for a translation of is really a result of Parshin (a review of [4] is on MathSciNet as MR0316456 and Parshin wrote a few papers during that time on varieties over function fields over finite fields, e.g., MR0476749).

My one big concern is that, yes the Russian ""occupants"" did contribute a lot to the development in the territories mentioned in the video, but was this something mutually agreed to? Did these countries actually want this to happen? The Poles don't seem to happy with what happened. In general, this leaves me feeling conflicted, considering what Putin allegedly had to say. It just seems unnecessarily defensive since the general attitude in the west is that it's Russia that will make the hostile moves first (here we go, cold war II)  My opinion on their politics? I'm no expert but Putin isn't the big boogeyman that the west makes him out to be. He seems to have his people's best interest in mind. However, I can't help but feel a bit uneasy over how much of the Duma 'Единая Россия' controls. Considering that they occupy over half of the seats, and that the remaining seats are split up into several, equally sized fractions,  there seems to be little room for varied political discourse on any substantive level.  edit: grammar"

russian,36coq6,serpensgolova,3,Mon May 18 09:54:39 2015 UTC,"The answer to 1 is yes, just as /u/serpensgolova says.  The answer to 2 is: it can be changed to genitive optionally for inanimate nominals. In animate masculine nouns (except 1st-declension words: мужчина, бродяга etc.) and in all animate plurals the genitive and accusative forms coincide anyway. For animate feminine nouns, examples like Никакой другой женщины он не любил are attested in Russian prose but currently should be considered archaic. Animate neuters are just too rare to say anything definite. TL;DR: changes optionally for inanimate, doesn't change for animate."
russian,36coq6,agrostis,1 point,Mon May 18 10:58:38 2015 UTC,"changes optionally for inanimate, doesn't change for animate.   Он любил женщин и не любил собак. (both animate, plural genitive)."
russian,36coq6,Vapaamies,1 point,Mon May 18 16:47:01 2015 UTC,"Or plural accusative—the forms actually coincide. However, considering the object of non-negated любить as genitive is not corroborated by any cases where genitive and accusative have distinct forms. There are no examples of non-negated любить taking an inanimate object marked genitive plural, or an animate feminine or neuter object marked genitive singular. Such objects are invariably accusative: we say он любит пироги / яхты / жену / это крохотное существо, and not ∗он любит пирогов / яхт / жены / этого крохотного существа. The principle of parsimony induces us to consider the case of the object accusative even in those cases where accusative coincides with genitive."
russian,36coq6,agrostis,3,Mon May 18 18:50:39 2015 UTC,"Любить кого (person) and что (object). Hence accusative. No.   Я не люблю ее (кого, person)  Я не люблю водку (что, object)  Again accusative."

russian,36coq6,agrostis,3,Mon May 18 12:27:25 2015 UTC,"I think for case of ""не любит водки"" it is more likely partitive (the same as for ""налей мне водки, я так её люблю"")."
russian,36coq6,ozgg,1 point,Mon May 18 13:06:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that's the case. With наливать, the meaning of partitive is more or less clear: you ask to have not all of the vodka, only your proper portion. But what would be the meaning of partitive with не любить? Especially if the object is some perfectly abstract and unquantifiable concept, e. g. суета."
russian,36coq6,agrostis,2,Mon May 18 13:51:44 2015 UTC,Cases may have not any reasonable meaning behind them. You just can use partitive in these cases.
russian,36coq6,ruplumograenum,1 point,Mon May 18 14:01:20 2015 UTC,"Водка doesn't have a special partitive form, if that's what you mean. Among the words that do, the corpus has не любить дыму|шуму|чаю|чесноку, 7 results in all. If we search for the same words in the same context but in the regular genitive, we get 15 results. So, yes, “partitive” form is possible here, but regular genitive is preferred, and the distinction between the two is blurred, if I dare say."
russian,36coq6,agrostis,1 point,Mon May 18 14:34:45 2015 UTC,Why not? Partitive for водка will be «водки». I think it is the same as genitive when there is no partitive form per se and the same as dative when there is partitive form (the seven words that you've written).
russian,36coq6,ozgg,1 point,Mon May 18 18:06:54 2015 UTC,Why not? Partitive for водка will be «водки». I think it is the same as genitive when there is no partitive form per se [...]   The problem is we can't draw any meaningful conclusions about the respective use of genitive and partitive when the two forms coincide.
russian,36coq6,agrostis,1 point,Mon May 18 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"Суета is feminine, so it will have the same form in accusative and genitive. But I agree, that in case of любить it's more like genitive/accusative, but not partitive.  I also cannot figure out when it's better to use each case for любить что-то/чего-то, so maybe it's just a matter of style, preferences or context.  Anyway, accusative case sounds more natural for me for both assertion and negation, though genitive can be used for style purposes."
russian,36coq6,ozgg,1 point,Mon May 18 18:03:17 2015 UTC,"Суета is feminine, so it will have the same form in accusative and genitive.   I'm afraid that's not so:  Любить (что?) суету.  vs.  Бояться (чего?) суеты."

I hear this as a common (well, at least somewhat common) problems among Russian natives, but every learner I've talked to about it agrees that this is an interesting case of a mistake that someone who has studied the language as a foreign language, rather than learning it as a native, would almost never make.   I can't imagine ever making a mistake with the exercises on this site, for example.  It seems so abundantly obvious, at least from the perspective of a non-native speaker, when a verb should be in the infinitive, and when it's conjugated."

I'd make a conjecture that it has to do with learning spoken language first versus studying written and spoken forms simultaneously.  To put it in a different way, native speakers learn grammar rules to build a structure to support their already existing ability to use a language; foreign speakers construct their ""house of knowledge"" from the ground up, with all the framework already inside. You can be unaware of the underlying logic of your mothertongue, but for a foreign language it is effectively essential."

They also write ""придя в зал ваша форма улучшится"", ""с обоих сторон"", ""пишите"" instead of ""пишете"" and vice versa. I'm far from being a grammar nazi, but these types of mistakes just put me off.

The thing is, you can leave the mistake, but connects two parts properly and you will have a right meaning, it will look bad because of misspelling, but it will be perfectly understandable. Or you can fix the mistake in ""tears"" and you will have no grammatical errors, but it will have the wrong meaning. It's a small but important difference, like between ""No more rape."" and ""No!

Well, a Russian would rarely say 'I cry tears', using instead 'I pour tears' ('Я лью слёзы'), that doesn't sound so broken. You still can use 'cry' in that context, but a form of 'tears' should be changed ('слёзы' => 'слезами').  In English you can say 'I cry tears [that] you will never see', omitting 'that' part (known as a Zero relative pronoun), but in Russian you have to put a comma and a relative pronoun in between two parts of a relative clause."

Общее замечание по стилю: все ""я"" и местоимения типа ""мой"" не нужны, за исключением первого. Окончания русских глаголов достаточно идентифицируют их принадлежность говорящему, и поэтому в русском местоимения используются гораздо реже, чем в английском — лингвистически аналитическом языке. В русском есть понятие ""я́чество"" — чрезмерное использование ""я"" и производных местоимений для восхваления себя любимого. Нужно использовать ""свой/своя/свое"", когда рассказываешь о себе другим, получается как бы в третьем лице.   Раньше я изучал русский язык три года в универе, а сейчас уже три года живу в России, работая преподавателем английского. Считаю, что достиг хорошего уровня языка, по крайней мере в разговоре. Сейчас у меня индивидуальный репетитор русского, но скоро я перееду в Москву, а на новой работе нету репетиторства. Хочу всё-таки улучшить уровень своего языка.

russian,35sqin,bachbrahmsbeethoven3,8,Wed May 13 04:51:17 2015 UTC,"""Во сколько тебе / Вам будет удобно?""  ""Во сколько ты свободен / Вы свободны?""  The usage of ты / Вы depends on how formal the relationship between the two of you is and partially on the age of the person you're talking to. If it's formal and/or if that person is a generation or more older than you, use Вы.  Alternatives to ""во сколько"" construct: ""когда"", ""в какое время"". ""Во сколько"" implies an answer with time of day expressed in hours and minutes (4AM, 4:30, 5PM, etc.) - because hours are kind of ""countable"" so ""во сколько"" is literally ""at how many [hours]"". On the other hand, ""когда"" (= ""when"") can be about any time-describing construct (even ""in winter"" or ""in a few years from now"").  A note about ""сколько"": another useful time-related phrase is ""через сколько"" - literally ""in how many [hours]"". Like in the case with ""во сколько"", hours are countable, and the expected answer is ""через N часов (M минут)"". From personal experience, ""через сколько"" is slightly informal (unlike ""во сколько""!), but it's not like angry grandmas are going to scold you for this. It's not slang, but it's colloquial; I don't think any ""official"" texts use this."

russian,35r8qd,LockManipulator,7,Tue May 12 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"Those are grammatical categories, and they don't always correspond to the meaning directly. ""Работал"" is definitely more common in this general situation, but not because the other is incorrect; rather, they mean slightly different things.  ""Работал"" implies constancy, you worked yesterday just like the day before that, today and tomorrow; it's more common because that's how people tend to talk about their regular jobs. ""Поработал"" implies an irregular, possibly one-time freelance-y sort of job or something of the sort. You worked, but that was yesterday.  To expand on your example a little, something like ""Я работал над картиной"" (I worked on a painting) would imply that you're a professional artist, or at least see yourself as a semi-professional, while ""я поработал над картиной"" would imply that you're more of a hobbyist, drawing in your time off your ""real job""."
russian,35r8qd,maks_orp,8,Tue May 12 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"What you're describing in the first two paragraphs is a very good explanation (a meaning of these two words that I personally overlooked in my own comment, I admit), but I don't agree with the example you give in the third paragraph. To me, ""я работал над картиной"" means that you spent a lot of time on it (yesterday, or on whatever day you're talking about), and ""я поработал над картиной"" means spending less time on it. Sort of like this: ""Вчера я проснулся, поработал над картиной и поехал в магазин"".  However, without specifying what exactly you were working on and simply saying ""поработал"" and ""работал"" can definitely have the meanings you described in the first two paragraphs. So probably it's just not the best example of usage."

russian,35r8qd,cjfynjy,2,Tue May 12 22:48:00 2015 UTC,"You can use both words here, but they would convey slightly different undertones. ""Я работал"" would imply that you were working for most of the day (and thus got really tired and all that), while ""Я поработал"" implies a lighter, or shorter in duration, work. In fact, the word ""немного"" (a bit) is almost asking to be added to ""поработал"" in this case.  Compare ""поработал"" to ""наработался"", which is another word that describes a completed action but means smth like ""I've worked my ass off"" (... and am really tired). There's also ""заработался"" which is essentially the same, but doesn't necessarily mean that you're done yet, ""заработался"" is smth that you can say while still working."

And while it might not help much, it is certainly fascinating. For example, the Russian for ""Sehenswürdigkeit"" (see-worthy-(thing)) has very similar literal meaning: достопримечательность (worth-noting-(thing))."

If you know Latin, French and German, most idiosyncrasies aren't anymore and you can enjoy the language. Language, btw, which is Old-French and was once Latin.   There are many Russian words with the same root as older words from Swiss German. Now it would be nice to check if that is random or real.

For word stresses that I repeatedly have trouble with I use mnemonics to make the syllable stand out. Try imagining that vowel really big and bright and sticking out or the word or something. As for memorising, using a flashcarding program like Anki is better than just using static lists on paper because it tracks how well you remember words so you don't waste time practising easy words too much and randomises them for you."

But even gradually replacing words with their Russian counterparts would be a great way to expand a student's vocabulary, if nothing else! I just think that you should stop short of trying to teach ""the language"" with that strategy; vocabulary building is the best you should really hope for there.

Here is a tip that might help you - it can be really hard to find сметана in the US unless you have an Eastern Euro/Russian food store nearby.  But, Mascarpone is comparatively easy to find - most any Italian market/shop or even many grocery stores or cheese/specialty food places will have it.  Mascarpone on its own is too rich, even richer than сметана, but if you mix mascarpone 50/50 with American sour cream (whole fat, not the reduced kind), the taste and texture is very very close.  I feel this is important, because сметана is so critical to many Russian meals, including пельмени and блини, at least in our household!"

Your other translations make sense too.    There's another word, ""gurn,"" which may be useful for you here.  It usually involves making a face that involves sort of clenching your jaw muscles and sticking out your lower jaw.    Serious gurning is a common sight at raves where people are taking ecstasy, which is why many ravers wear pacifiers.

If it is not bad, but just something anticipated or prepared for long time I would say something like ""Ну что же"" or ""Начинается..."" (the latter would work with negative connotations too).

It may also be used as an exclamation to express dismay, anger, boredom, amusement, pain, and some other feelings (like in the video). As an interjection it may appear almost anywhere in a phrase and serves to make it stronger or funnier (sort of like fucking may appear before any English noun).

Later it acquired connotations of ""deception"" and sexual misconduct, but remained in common use until 17th century. The word became officially taboo during the reign of Anna Ioanovna. Today it is one of the four ""mat"" words whose use in the mass media may result in license revocation."

You speak very well and your accent is decent, but you speak too quickly. For example, when you say ""Может оказаться полезным в вашей жизни"" - ""в вашей жизни"" is jumbled and rushed.   ""как кусочек огромного мира"" - You mispronounce огромного. It sounds like you're saying угромново.  ""Слишком многие позволяют"" - It sounds like you're saying шлишком.

russian,34rhvv,LockManipulator,6,Sun May 3 22:54:07 2015 UTC,"I think that in this case we're talking about a very peculiar use of the English present continuous tense to signify a future action for which some kind of plan or arrangement has been made already before the moment of discourse, as in:   We're going to the theatre on Friday.   Russian also allows formal present to be used for future events, but the meaning is rather that the future action is inevitable, or at least strongly resolved upon (it's a very subtle difference in comparison to English). Anyway, formal future can also be used for such actions. Both of the following are acceptable:   В пятницу мы идëм в театр.  В пятницу мы пойдëм в театр."

But if you were on a train on your way to London and someone asked where you were going, you would say ""я еду в Лондон"".  My Russian is pretty terrible, so someone please correct me if I'm wrong!"
russian,34rhvv,mymra,3,Mon May 4 00:38:07 2015 UTC,"This is all correct, you got it right!  ""Я поеду"" can only be translated as ""I'm going"" in the sense of English's use of ""I'm going"" to talk about the future (I'm going to London this summer.  I'm going to the store tomorrow).  Like agrostis said, Russian sometimes uses the present in a similar way.  I'm here in Russia for a few more months before my visa ends, and people are always asking ""Когда ты уезжаешь?""  (and not ""когда ты уедешь?"")  Why an imperfect verb?  Not because this is a repeated action, not because it's currently happening in the present moment, but because you can say that, just the way you can in English, to talk about agreed upon or generally certain future plans."

You're pretty close! It's actually not a reduction of был(а)(о), but another form of быть called the perfective aorist, which has disappeared from contemporary Russian.

russian,34m2kb,mymra,1 point,Sat May 2 12:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming your confusion is about the use of dative (Мне) and not nominative (Я) here. The dative serves as a sort of subject here. If you see a dative + infinitive construction, you probably have to translate it with ""I"" in English. ""Мне хочется пить"" is ""I want to drink"", ""Мне не нравится"" is ""I don't like"", etc."
russian,34m2kb,mambeu,1 point,Sat May 2 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is where my confusion stems from: The use of a dative pronoun instead of a personal one.   So, I guess the phrase means something like ""You are no longer seen to me"" ?"
russian,34m2kb,mambeu,6,Sat May 2 12:12:16 2015 UTC,"""It's not for me to see you anymore"" is clunky, but it might be a more literal English translation.  Dative 'subjects' like мне here are often used to portray the 'subject' as an experiencer rather than as an agent (which would need the nominative). So the 'subject' in your song lyric isn't making a conscious, voluntary choice; he's constrained by some other factor. He's not deciding not to see someone in the future; he's somehow obligated not to."

Another example would be Зачем мне было вставать? 'Why was I supposed to get up?'  You've probably seen the dative used with нужно and a verbal infinitive. This usage is similar—it's no accident that the dative case is used for both.

Soft consonants are palatalized, i.e. tongue is moved close to the hard palate.  Vowels (letters, that represent vowels) can be palatalizing or not. E.g. А does not palatalize preceding consonants, but Я do palatalize. And both of them are represent morpheme /a/.   My Russian book tells me that soft vowels are proceeded by a short 'y' sound but again, this is not apparent when I'm hearing words.    They are neither proceded nor preceded by a short 'y'. Existance of 'y' (/j/) is called iotation and it is different, but kinda related process. Look here: http://i.imgur.com/74nNTy7.png"

russian,34ku0r,MuzzyIsMe,1 point,Sun May 3 11:06:38 2015 UTC,"To put it simply, soft consonants are just regular consonants coarticulated with the English ""y"" sound. The English ""y"" sound is pronounced by nearing the middle part of your tongue toward the palate (middle part of the roof of your mouth). You should be able to feel the tongue in this position when you pronounce the English ""y"" consonant sound. Notice that the front part of your tongue is doing nothing during the ""y"" pronunciation? What you need to do is keep the middle part of your tongue pronouncing the English ""y"" sound, but at the same time you're doing that raise the front part of your tongue toward the position of the ""L"" pronunciation.  Or you can try separating it into a difference you can hear. Try to pronounce ""bayshoy"" vs. ""balshoy"". It should be a very clear distinction. Try to smush them together into one word.  One mistake learners often make is to pronounce the English ""y"" sound after the consonant. This can get you by when followed by a vowel (such as ""nyet""), but it'll get you stuck when there's no following vowel such as the word we're discussing. Remember that it's important to pronounce it at the same exact time as the consonant, not after it.  It's hard to detect the difference because your brain is only wired to distinguish between sounds that are used in your native language, but if you practice pronouncing and hearing these differences you can retrain yourself to detect it.  PS, I keep referring to the ""English 'y'"" because the preferred letter for that sound in Eastern Europe and IPA is ""J"". The letter ""y"" is usually reserved for the sixth Russian vowel ""ы"", so using the letter ""y"" for both of these completely different Russian sounds is needlessly confusing."
russian,34ku0r,anna_akhmatova,1 point,Sat May 2 10:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  the whole y/j thing makes sense- although it helps I come from having learnt Serbian to Russian and so tend to use the j sound for English y anyway.   It's likely just a practice issue now- I haven't been learning Russian particularly long (probably a month) in any case."
russian,34ku0r,Trevie3,1 point,Sat May 2 10:09:18 2015 UTC,"I find that you slowly just get used to it after hearing it a lot.  Same with ш/щ.    I remember thinking ы was the most impossible sound when I first started learning Russian, and I could barely tell the difference between и/ы when listening.  Now it's very obvious to me.  Anyhow, just keep listening to Russian words and don't stress too much about it.  Also, I always advocate the website Forvo.com- every time you learn a new word, even if you know the pronunciation, listen to it there spoken by a native."
russian,34igp2,fishmael,17,Fri May 1 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"These verbs have essentially the same meaning, but встречаться is ""to be meeting"" (regularly) and встретиться is ""to meet"" (once, or at a particular time). Where English language uses Simple and Continuous tenses (like Present Simple and Present Continuous), Russian language uses different (although almost always very similar) verbs. Other examples of such pairs: летать vs. лететь, ходить vs. идти (this one's interesting because the verbs look very different), ползать vs. ползти. They're mainly verbs of motion (I almost wanted to write ""exclusively verbs of motion"", but I'm not too sure).  Встречаться and встретиться can only be used with -ся when they are followed by the preposition ""с"" (= ""with""): ""встречаться с"". Here's a simple rule of thumb: if you would use ""with"" in English here, go with ""-ся"" and ""с"". That's why ""I'm meeting with a friend tonight"" (we'll have a good time in a bar) will be ""Я сегодня вечером встречаюсь с другом"", but ""I'm meeting a friend at the airport"" (to drive him somewhere) will be ""Я встречаю друга в аэропорту"".  I don't think there are any special cases or exceptions where these words would be used differently. Usually the ""-ся"" variants are used when you're talking about going to some meeting with the purpose to meet someone, have a talk with them, etc., while the ""usual"" forms of these words are used when you're talking about just meeting someone (that is, crossing paths with them, or meeting them in order to drive them somewhere, etc.). And, of course, ""встречаться с"" also has a meaning of ""to be dating someone"", as you mentioned.  And in your example with ""девушка"", people say ""она моя девушка"" because ""девушка"" can also have a meaning of ""girlfriend"", not only ""young human female"". Same as ""парень"" (literal translation: ""guy"") is frequently used in the meaning of ""boyfriend"". Occasionally, people say ""мой бойфренд"" and even ""моя гёрлфренд"", but this sounds absolutely horrendous. Don't use these last two examples yourself, this is just to prepare you in advance for when you encounter this somewhere.  P.S. It's not ""эта девушка, с к-рой я встречаюсь"", it's ""это девушка, [...]"". Этот/эта/это would only take the same grammatical form as the word next to it if it's related to this word in a sentence, for example, ""this girl"" would indeed be translated as ""эта девушка"". However, here ""это"" is a separate member of the sentence, and the whole sentence has a structure of ""A is B"". ""Earth is a planet."" ""This is the girl I'm dating"". ""This"", when it's all by itself and not ""attached"" to another word (like in this sentence), always translates as ""это"" (gender neutral form). ""Is"", as you probably know by now, can be translated as ""есть"" (= ""to be"") if you really really want to, but it's always omitted in modern Russian language. Normally, you have a dash (""–"") in its place, but dash isn't used when one of the words around this ""is"" is a pronoun (like ""me"", ""you"", etc., and ""this"" = ""это"" is one of them). Compare: ""Земля – планета."" ""Я человек."" ""Иван – человек."" ""Это катастрофа."""

The only difference is the mode of transportion used:  возить / везти - to take (transport) someone by vehicle  водить / вести - to take (lead) someone on foot (strangely enough, this is also the generic verb meaning 'to drive', although this only has limited usages, such as the specific act of driving a car, in which case the noun машина must generally be used; for example, ""Я научилась водить машину, когда мне было 16 лет"" or ""Кто вёл машину, когда авария произошла?"". In most cases, you should just use ездить / ехать for driving, with the option of further clarifying the mode of transport with ""на машине"").  If it helps, the only other transitive verb of motion is носить / нести, which means to carry something/someone by foot.  Like all verbs of motion without prefixes, all of these forms are imperfective. возить, водить, and носить are multidirectional verbs, whereas везти, вести, and нести are unidirectional.  ruplumograenum also provided a good list of idiomatic usages of these verbs, which are plenty.

Спасибо большое для меня помогать!   There are three mistakes here. First, помогать requires a dative for the beneficiary. Second, спасибо requires за + accusative for the object of gratitude. Third, if the object of gratitude is a verbal clause, you should wrap it in a что ... construction; generally, you can't use infinitive in contexts which require a noun phrase argument (except in some particular constructions, such as with the verbs хотеть, начинать, уставать, ...) In this case, it is best to nominalize the verb and say спасибо большое за помощь.  Btw., let me guess: you speak French, don't you? Because that's exactly a merci pour m'aider rendered in Russian words and categories."
russian,34f0hh,agrostis,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:54:14 2015 UTC,"When you say wrapping the clause in a что construction, do you mean something like спасибо за то, что <verbal clause>?

russian,34f0hh,frublox,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly, спасибо за то, что <clause>, but you can also shorten it to спасибо, что <clause>. The former is slightly more formal. (However, speakers of the younger generation tend to use bare что less frequently, saying things like слышала, то что он женился, so I'd expect the shorter construction to fall out of use, too.)"
russian,34f0hh,agrostis,1 point,Fri May 1 00:35:50 2015 UTC,"However, ""слышала то, что он женился"" (regardless of where you put the comma) is grammatically incorrect. You can say спасибо за то, что [...], but you can слышать either some noun (""слышать звук"") or the entire construct of ""что что-то случилось"". You can't, however, use ""то, что"" with words like слышать, думать, увидеть, etc."
russian,34f0hh,cjfynjy,2,Fri May 1 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"Of course it is ungrammatical, but, you see, native speakers speak according to their intuition rather than according to the grammar."
russian,34f0hh,agrostis,4,Fri May 1 18:30:23 2015 UTC,"I would say, кто-то in a question means that the speaker expects a positive rather than a negative answer, while кто-нибудь is neutral. Somewhat like   There is someone here, isn't there? vs. Is there someone here? in English, except that the hinting for positive is weaker in Russian -то."
russian,34f0hh,agrostis,2,Thu Apr 30 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"To add to /u/agrostis's great explanation, I would also note that there's another meaning possible. In the phrase ""Здесь еще кто-то есть"", where exactly was the stress?  ""Здесь еще кто-то есть?"", with the stress on ""еще"", would be translated as ""What, there's someone else around here?"", it would mean that the character is surprised that there's someone else. In this case, ""кто-то"" would be the only correct translation of ""someone"", because the question isn't about asking whether or not there's someone else around here, but it's more of an asking for confirmation. ""Wait a second, you're telling me there's someone else here?!"". ""Someone"" / ""кто-то"" isn't the word emphasized in the question, ""else"" / ""еще"" is the stressed word, so ""someone"" is translated like it would be translated in any regular sentence (""кто-то"").  But if the stress is on ""есть"" or ""кто-то"", then the question indeed means ""Is there someone else around here?"" and /u/agrostis's explanation applies here. ""Кто-нибудь"" and ""кто-то"" can be used interchangeably in such questions, with ""кто-нибудь"" being more common.  P.S. ""Ну, я сейчас играю в (!) Resident Evil Revelations 2"" - if you used ""ну, ..."" here in the meaning of ""well, ..."", then ""Так вот, ..."" would be more appropriate."

russian,34cigz,TheHockeyist,13,Thu Apr 30 01:26:51 2015 UTC,"Чтоб and чтобы are absolutely identical. Чтобы is the ""default"" form of the word; чтоб can be used in poetic language, in wannabe-oldschool writing and such (also occasionally used if the phrase just has a better rhythm with it).  Чтобы/чтоб means ""in order to"", indicating reason or intention or goal. Он встал со стула, чтобы подойти к столу - He got up from the chair [in order] to come closer to the table. If the English sentence has ""to"" (in the meaning of ""in order to""), then the Russian sentence will have ""чтобы"" there.  Note: don't confuse it with ""что бы"" (it's a very common mistake that native speakers make). ""Что бы"" means ""whatever"" in contexts like ""whatever happens, don't look back"" - ""Что бы ни случилось, не оглядывайся"". It's two words, ""что"" having the meaning of ""what"" here and ""бы"" is the particle meaning subjunctive mood (a situation where something doesn't really happen, but you're talking about the possibility of it).  The other word you're talking about, ""что"", has a lot of various meanings depending on context, but it's never used as ""in order to"", so if your struggle is about the difference between что and чтобы, then your indicator should be ""does this mean ""in order to""?"". If it does, чтобы/чтоб is the right word here. If it doesn't, then что is the right word.  Just for the record, ""что"" can mean:   ""What"" - both in questions and in regular sentences. ""That"" - in the meaning of the word that connects two parts of the sentence. ""We found out that Lenin was a mushroom"" - ""Мы обнаружили, что Ленин был грибом"". But not ""that"" in the meaning of ""that one, not this one""."

You can end with something like ""Спасибо за внимание, Подпись"" (""Thanks for your attention, Your own name""), or ""С наилучшими пожеланиями, Подпись"" (""Best regards, Your own name""), or something else like this.

On the other hand, in a personal/formal kind of letter, like when you send your older aunt a postcard for her anniversary, you may use ""Дорогая ..."" and end with ""С наилучшими пожеланиями, ..."".   It's something like this: in business context, you're not supposed to get overly personal. Older and more conservative people may find that disrespectful.

russian,3474ji,Haxen,19,Tue Apr 28 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"I see. That could be confusing, but it mostly comes to understanding difference between various prefixes.   Учить could be used for two purposes: кого-то - ""to teach someone"", or учить что-то (e.g. уроки) - to learn or study something, or in that particular case ""to do a homework"".   Учиться means to study something or somewhere. Учиться рисовать - to learn drawing, учиться в школе - to study at the school.  Выучиться - means a completed action, usually to get a profession or a degree. Выучиться на врача - to get a doctor's degree, to complete education.  Обучиться - a process of studying (обучение). Обучаться программированию - to study programming, обучаться в универститете - to study in university. Гsually it's not used when you mean studying something by yourself.  Научиться - to get knowledge to do something. Научиться водить машину - to learn to drive a car.  Разучиться - to lose knowledge of something. Разучиться читать - to lose the ability of reading."
russian,3474ji,Thoughtist,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:10:38 2015 UTC,"So Научиться would translate better as ""to learn""? And how would this differ from ""Узнать""?"
russian,3474ji,crushthehorns,8,Tue Apr 28 23:18:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, those words could be used as synonyms in some cases: ""Сегодня в школе я узнал как решать уравнения."" and ""Сегодня в школе я научился решать уравнения."" But the difference implies that with научиться one gains the knowledge through a process of study, learns something meaningly, with an aim to receive that knowledge; while узнать doesn't imply it and you could have merely discovered this information by any mean, even by chance. Anyway, I start to feel confused myself the more I think about it."
russian,3474ji,Thoughtist,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:07:22 2015 UTC,"It was good enough for me, thanks!"
russian,3474ji,crushthehorns,3,Wed Apr 29 01:28:48 2015 UTC,"I would also add that ""узнать"" is more of an instantaneous action, something that just happens immediately (or over a very very brief period of time). You can узнать адрес, узнать решение задачи, etc. Basically, it means ""to obtain some information"". Научиться is the end result of some process of learning that took some time (even if it took just an hour). Also, узнать is always about some piece of information, it's never used with skill, unlike научиться (for example, you can't узнать карате)."

""Teach"" if both direct and indirect objects, e.g. Я его учу математике = I teach him math (very counterintuitive, I know.  This trips me up as a native speaker sometimes).  For University professors, we use ""преподавать"", e.g. Я преподаю математику = I teach math at University.  учиться: learn, be in the process of learning, usually no direct object. Я учусь в университете = I learn in University.  выучиться: finish learning, like я выучился на доктора = I learned to be  doctor (in University)  обучиться: teach oneself, e.g. Я обучился математике = I taught myself math.  научиться: learn to where you know it, e.g. Я научился математике = I learned math, now I know it well.  разучиться: unlearn, e.g. После того как я провел три недели в больнице я разучился ходить = After three weeks in the hospital, I forgot how to walk/unlearned how to walk.

It's to learn a skill.  To learn to do something.  Memorize (as in learn something by heart) is often ""выучить наизусть"".  Запомнить, I think, is more like ""commit to memory"".

Вот..."" that is used to fill gaps in speech is closer to ""...erm..."" or ""...well...""  Здесь is an indication of current location. It can be a geographical location or location in the text/picture.

It can be funny if the profanity is directed at something neither of you care about, for instance, but profanity is never funny if directed at someone.  Unless MAYBE you're VERY close friends or family.  Maybe.  But probably not.  My advice to you: Learn how to say ""hello, how are you?"".  The polite way to say this is actually pretty difficult to pronounce, and the time and effort you put in to learning it should really mean something to her.  Respectful ""hello"" is здравствуйте.  Zdras-vuitye.  Pay special attention to the ""r"", since Russian 'r' is rolled.  A respectful way to ask ""whats up"" is как вас дела. kahk vas dyeh-LAH.  The very respectful way to ask ""how are you"" is Как вы поживаете.  Kahk vui pah-zhee-VAH-yeh-tyeh.  Pay special attention to that вы (vui), because the ы sound doesn't exist in English.  You make this sound by saying ""ee"" in the back of your throat, but for вы you can sort of approximate the sound by saying ""voo-ee"".  I would suggest making an effort to pronounce it correctly, though.  Good luck!"

Ему было 9 лет.  -Watch your в vs. на.  -Watch your soft signs (ь).   -Work on numbers. Numbers are tricky in  Russian because they change the case you need to use quite frequently.

Подмосковные вечера (podmoskovnie vechera)) is a Russian song, one of those best known outside its homeland.  The song was originally created as ""Leningradskie Vechera"" (""Leningrad Nights"") by composer Vasily Solovyov-Sedoi and poet Mikhail Matusovsky in 1955 (when both had well-established careers), but at the request of the Soviet Ministry of Culture, the ""Подмосковные вечера"" (transliterated as ""Podmoskovnye Vechera""; more or less ""Evenings in Moscow Oblast"") version was prepared, [when?] with corresponding changes to the lyrics.  In 1956, Podmoskovnye Vechera was recorded by Vladimir Troshin, a young actor of the Moscow Art Theatre, for a documentary about the athletic competition Spartakiad of the Peoples of the RSFSR, for a scene where the participants rest in Podmoskovye, the Moscow suburbs. It went little noticed in the context of the film, but gained considerably popularity thanks to radio broadcasts.

It is also least formal of all three to the point it can be found in some Russian... idioms (?) (not sure how to say it in English, I mean ""устойчивые выражения""), like ""учить уму-разуму"".  ""Обучать"" is more precise, it is always translates as ""to teach"". Because of precision, it is often seen in professional talk.  ""Преподавать"" is also precise and has somewhat different meaning, it is about teaching some subject. One can say ""Вы хорошо обучили моих детей"", but it is wrong to use ""преподавать"" this way. However, ""Вы хорошо преподаёте английский язык моим детям"" is just fine. (Sounds quite formal, though.)"

Or you could go in a literally opposite direction and talk about the Russian expansion into Siberia, some battles with the Chinese, explorers, Cossack settlers.  Or maybe how serfdom was created became such a big issue.  Or the schism between the Orthodox Church and the Old Believers   Or how the Cossacks came to be.  Or Ivan the Terrible and the oprichniki and how he completely remade Russia for good and bad  Or the Vikings and histories of Kievan Rus   Or Rublev and the artistry and meaning of icons   Or the Mongol Invasion  Or the Time of Troubles  Or the Triumph of Alexander Nevsky  Or the 1905 revolution  Or the first 1917 revolution. This created a new government, but not a Soviet one.   The October Revolution and the Soviet takeover  The Russian Civil War (America took part in that, among other countries)  The story of the Czechoslovak Legion   The Avant Garde art movement  The Battle of Poltava, the time when Sweden began its decline, the Russian Empire was saved and began a new trajectory to being a great power  Or ending serfdom and the legacy of the way in which it was done  Or pick an aspect of something big - for example, don't do WWII or Stalingrad, do the Night Witches, or the Arctic Convoys. Or how Vicotry Day, WWII and the Holocaust have been portrayed in Russia over the years (it's changed a lot and is politically important).  Or the deportations under Stalin  Or the Great Purge  Or collectivization and industrialization   Or a bigger issue like ethnicity policy at a particular time   Or the conquest of the Caucasus (relevant because of violence there now, Circassian claims around Olympics)  Or go way back and talk about people crossing the land bridge to Alaska and remaining similarities between the two cultures on both sides  Or Fort Ross, the Russian fort in California   Or the 1990s if that is not too recent. People outside of the region often underestimate how difficult that time was and what effect it had in people."

The Cyrillic ""е"" is pronounced as ""ye"" at the beginning of the word or after a vowel.

Сейчас я студент во Флоридском Государственном Университете. Мой университет очень большой, в нём 20 тысяч студентов и аспирантов. В этом университете я изучаю aнглийский, немецкий, и русский языки. Я также хочу изучать лингвистику. Это трудные предметы, но мне очень интересно. Я окончу университет на весной в 2018 году (лучше написать ""весной 2018 года""). Потом я поступлю в аспирантуру чтобы изучать лингвистику.  Я живу в однокомнатном общежитии недалеко от Ландис Грин. В комнате есть маленькая кровать, письменный стол, и шкаф, но в ней (лучше убрать) нет кухни или телевизора. У меня есть товарищ по комнате, которого зовут Джон. Мы редко разговариваем, потому что мы (лучше убрать, из контекста понятно, что речь о вас) всегда заняты. Он встает всегда в 7 часов утра, а я сплю допоздна. Так я часто опаздываю на занятия русского языка. Перед первым занятием я быстро принимаю душ и потом одеваюсь. После этого я обедаю в столовой в кампусе.  У меня много свободного времени, потому что я никогда не учусь (тут непонятно что хотели сказать: ""потому что я часто прогуливаю"", ""потому что я никогда не делаю домашние задания""?). Мне нравятся настольные игры, но я думаю, что Монополия очень скучная. Я не люблю часто заниматься спортом, но играю в квиддичной университетской команде по квиддичу . В этом году мы ездили на региональный турнир в Палм-Кост, но мы сыграли очень плохо. (but чаще переводится как ""но"", чем как ""а"")  Мне 18 лет. Я родился в Северной Каролине в городе Дирхам, а я вырос во Флориде. Мои родители работают дома, в своей фирме(лучше написать ""занимаются своим бизнесом"" или ""у моих родителей свой бизнес""). Мой отец дизайнер, а он также он пилот в свободное время (плохо звучит: ""а также в свободное время он летает на самолёте/пилотирует частный самолёт). Он любит смотреть старые фильмы о войне. Моя мама менеджер и хорошо готовит. У меня есть также  старший брат, его зовут Купер. Он тоже учится в ФГУ, а он изучает экономику и историю.  ""Большое спасибо"""

russian,33fo9o,cherycopter,3,Thu Apr 23 08:19:38 2015 UTC,"Доброе утром, меня зовут Мэйсон. Я живу в городе Таллахасси в штате Флорида. Сейчас я студент учусь (it just sounds better) во Флоридском Государственном Университете. Мой университет очень большой, у него в нем /учится/  20 тысячи студентов и аспирантов. В этом университете я изучаю aнглийский, немецкий, (comma not needed) и русский языки. Я также хочу изучать лингвистику. Они Это трудные предметы, но они мне очень интересны. Я окончу на весне в 2018 году закончу/окончу университет весной 2018 года. Потом я поступлю в аспирантуру , чтобы изучать лингвистику. Я живу в однокомнатном общежитие комнате в общежитии (otherwise you're saying the the Hall itself consists of one room) недалеко от Ландис Грин. У B комнатe есть маленькaя кровать, письменный стол, и шкаф, но у неё тут нет кухни или телевизора. У меня есть товарищ по комнате, кого которого зовут Джон. Мы редко разговариваем, потому что мы всегда заняты. Он всегда встает всегда в 7 часов утра, а я сплю поздно допоздна. Так я часто опаздываю на занятия русского языка. До первого занятия я быстро принимаю душ и потом одеваюсь. После этого я обедаю в ресторане ( I would put столовая - ""в столовой"", - here, unless you actually want to say that you go to a restaurant, that big posh place right? ""столовая"" = canteen) на кампусе кампуса. У меня много свободного времени, потому что я никогда учиться не учусь. Мне нравятся настольные игры, но я думаю, что Монополия очень скучная. Я часто не люблю играть спорты не люблю заниматься спортом /часто/ (sounds very odd, however), но я играю на квиддичной команде университета в университетской сборной по квиддичу. Это год В этом году мы ездили в региональном турнире на региональные соревнования в Палм Кост, но мы сыграли очень плохо. Мне 18 лет. Я родилСЯ (я родил = I gave birth, personally; made me chuckle) в Северей Каролине в городе Дирхам, но я вырос во Флориде. Мои родители работают (из) дома, в своей фирме. Мой отец дизайнер, и/но он также пилот в свободное время. Он любит смотреть старые фильмы о войне. Моя мама менеджер и хорошо готовить. У меня также есть старший брат, его зовут Коопер Купер (unless he is called Co-oper, like in ""co-op mode"", I don't know). Он тоже учится в ФГУ, но он изучает экономику и историю.  Sorry about the formatting if it comes out all fucked up, I'm not entirely awake yet.  Overall, I was very impressed with your level, the quality of work you've produced is very decent! However, you need to learn your cases and genders: your mistakes are more often than not in the endings, and the triviality of such mistakes kind of depreciates the level of your work as a whole. I also get a feeling that you should definitely look up ""a, но, и"" connectors as you keep confusing them; they are not completely interchangeable by any means. Very good work though, I was genuinely delighted reading it. (:  How long have you been learning Russian for and do you have any friends/relatives from Russia?"

russian,32zqld,TheHockeyist,4,Sat Apr 18 02:32:41 2015 UTC,"First of all, Russian pronunciation can vary from region to region, from person to person and from context to context, so there's no real need to worry if something doesn't sound quite right. Also, rules like ""е becomes ы after ж/ш"" are often a bit on the exaggerated side.  For example, I recorded myself saying тоже a few times. The first two times I said it separately, slower and then at a normal pace. Then I said it in context (я тоже так думаю), clearly at first, then normally and finally in a campy Moscow voice. The differences are subtle, but you can hear that both э and ы are valid pronunciations of the last е.  Here's another recording, this time of кофе, separately and in different contexts, with the same structure as earlier. Same result here - е and и sound equally correct. I would personally prefer to enunciate the е in ""кофе - это крепкий напиток"".  However, I don't think я turns into an и at the end of a word. It turns into an и sound when unstressed somewhere in the middle, but not at the end. To demonstrate, I spoke the words воля and Коля separately and in context - the я stays recognisable. In words like пятиэтажный, however, it gets reduced to an и.  Hope this helped, let me know if you have any questions."
russian,32zqld,EngiN33R-,2,Sat Apr 18 10:18:45 2015 UTC,"No, the unstressed sound is not really an /i/  or an /ɨ/, those can only occur under stress. Unstressed vowels undergo reduction, so, in кофе, море, etc. where the preceding consonant is palatalized, the sound shall be more like an /ɪ/, similar to the one in English kid, maybe somewhat more open. In тоже, наше, солнце, where the preceding consonant is a non-palatalized one, the sound is an /ə/, similar to the final vowel of Engl. banana."
russian,32zqld,agrostis,1 point,Sat Apr 18 10:15:48 2015 UTC,"Vowel reduction in Russian:       Vowel reduction in Russian differs in the standard language and in dialects. Several ways of reduction (and its absence) are distinguished.  There are five vowel phonemes in Standard Russian. Vowels tend to merge when they are unstressed. The vowels /a/ and /o/ have the same unstressed allophones for a number of dialects and reduce to an unclear schwa. Unstressed /e/ may become more central if it does not merge with /i/. Other types of reduction are phonetic, such as that of high vowels (/i/ and /u/), which become near-close so that этап ('stage') is pronounced [ɪˈtap] and мужчина ('man') is [mʊˈɕːinə].  Russian orthography does not reflect vowel reduction and this can cause confusion for beginning learners of Russian.

Any polite statement can be used sarcastically or ironically, invalidating the politeness.  Upd. Social context also matters: talk which is perfectly polite between friends or equals in an informal setting can be considered impolite when in a formal setting. A French friend of mine told me how she once brought her classmate to see her grandparents, who are of an old-fashioned aristocratic type (their family can be traced back to 12th or 13th century). The classmate was very nice and courteous in my friend's view, however, when she left, the grandmother was indignant: “What kind of manners does that young person have? Drank her coffee and only said Merci. Who talks like that? Merci, Madame is what one ought to say!”  To speak more substantially, here are the hits for спасибо не надо in the RNC, for written and for spoken language."

You can also say ""для меня это важно"", which means ""this is important to me."""

Напиться can also be used basically this same way in reference to normal drinks, but it's most commonly used, in my experience (and maybe this just speaks to my own lifestyle) as ""to get drunk"".

Such interpolations might represent a speaker’s comment on the reliability of information (e.g. кa ́жeтся), indicate the source or status of the information (e.g. по-мо ́eму), describe the way an idea is expressed (ины ́ми словa ́ми), make some sort of appeal by a speaker to his or her interlocutor (понимa ́eшь), or express a speaker’s attitude to what is said (нa бeду ́). Often interpolations mean very little, serving mainly to fill out an utterance, perhaps in order to give the speaker time to marshal further thoughts. (Interpolations of this latter sort are known in Russian as словa ́-пaрaзи ́ты.)

russian,32o45r,kmmeerts,8,Wed Apr 15 11:42:54 2015 UTC,"Generally, sound changes just happen in languages, there's no reason behind them. It's a pretty remarkable fact that in all languages in the world, sometimes sounds in certain places or certain circumstances just ""shift"", and this happens quickly and generally without exceptions.   In Russian, all stressed long /e/'s between a soft and a hard consonant shifted to /ɵ/. The remaining such words in the current language are loanwords from Church Slavonic (like небо, which should be нёбо) and words with sounds that later shifted to /e/ (like хлеб, which used to be spelled with a ѣ, which sounded like the ""a"" in ""cat"", but later in an unrelated change shifted to the current pronounciation). So, it's not a random change, it's specifically all those /e/'s, but none of the others. Why did people do this? No idea, just because. They most likely didn't even realize they were doing it, just like contemporary Americans don't realize they pronounce ""caught"" and ""cot"" the same, or ""pen"" and ""pin"""
russian,32o45r,ihamsa,2,Wed Apr 15 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"But /ѣ/ didn't shift back then, and shifted much later to /e/. So in the modern language there are quite a few native words that have stressed /e/ between a soft and a hard consonant."
russian,32o45r,kmmeerts,2,Wed Apr 15 18:52:38 2015 UTC,"Right. Most words ""бедный белый беглый бес"" are soft-e-hard. They stand out in the modern language, but aren't exceptions to the sound law, because the ѣ wasn't pronounced [e] but [æ]. I'll change my post."
russian,32o45r,ruplumograenum,5,Wed Apr 15 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"Um, it's hard to tell the reason of  sound changing. Usually it's just accepted as a fact.  But here the more longer explanation:  In Proto-Slavic, at the positions after soft consonants was sound e instead of o (compared to current situation).  Then in Russian, every stressed e before hard consonants and word-finally shifts to o. Some of consonants that now are hard was soft at these times (like ж, ц, ш, etc) or was at such position, where they was soft, so some words didn't change (like первый). And some words did change by morphological rules, although they shouldn't.  After this shift, newborn o sound happened to be located after soft consonants, and they are became ё (because soft cons + о = ё).  Church Slavonic was independent language even from different group (it's South Slavic, related to Bulgarian, and Russian is East Slavic). So it did not experience this sound shift. As it was the literary language in Russia till the XVII  century, this change was ""outlawed"" some time. In the middle of XVIII ё sound started to appear in texts, if different forms as io, ио, ьо, etc. In 1783 the letter ё invented. And after the reform it was accepted as separate letter in the alphabet."
russian,32o45r,ruplumograenum,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:18:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, the weird Church Slavonic that has some weird sound changes....."
russian,32o45r,Walt_G,2,Wed Apr 15 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"Nope, Church Slavonic has not. Russian has.   Russian shifted stressed /e/ > /o/, that gives ё after soft consonants. And because only stressed /e/ became /o/, ё in native words can be only stressed.  Church Slavonic has no ё at all. There was no that shift in CS.  I'm not very good in explanations, probably :)"

russian,32bpud,Hellerick,5,Mon Apr 13 01:12:49 2015 UTC,"You'll have to prove to me the great distinction between L and Л.   And the reason why a is not used in вокзал, is because that is even farther from what you want than о is. Vakzal sounds like the a in ""cat"".  No proper English pronunciation would make Vakzal sound like ""вокзал"" should. A is a very tricky letter in English. It makes about 2 extra noises more than it should.   In language courses, we are taught the sound change of 'о'. That it can sound like о or a is known, but the English a is a poor substitute when transliterating."

russian,329to1,SweetPeaHorticulture,8,Sat Apr 11 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"First of all, if I may correct you, «акцент» means logical accent. Phonetical accent is called «ударение».   Он писал: «на море», но акцент был сделан на ""на"" вместо ""море"". Было ли это сделано только ради рифмы?   Вы хотели, видимо, сказать не ради рифмы, а ради размера (for the sake of meter). Ответ на этот вопрос: и да, и нет. Правила русской поэзии не позволяют просто так передвигать ударения. Но тут дело в том, что в предложной группе (односложный предлог + существительное) ударение может падать на предлог. В древнерусском языке, если я не путаю, это было обязательно так. Начиная с XVI века ударение стало постепенно переходить на существительное, и в современном русском языке оно как правило ставится на существительном. Хотя и до сих пор мы в обыденной речи говорим: смотри по́д ноги (но можно и под но́ги), свалился на́ пол, упустил и́з виду (но можно и из ви́ду), меня водят за́ нос, поверил ему на́ слово, бе́з толку — это такие устойчивые сочетания, в которых сохранились следы старого правила.  Во времена Пушкина это старое правило, вероятно, ещё не совсем было вытеснено новым, и для него на́ море было допустимым вариантом. У поэта XX или XXI века это уже был бы архаизм; впрочем, в русской поэзии архаизмы вполне приветствуются.  Upd.: Любопытный пример из современной песенной поэзии — «Конь» Шаганова, где сама подвижность ударения используется в качестве поэтического приёма:  Мы пойдём с конём 𝄾 по́ полю вдвоём, Мы пойдём с конём по по́лю вдвоём."

Ukrainian: били́ни Bylyny) is a traditional East Slavic oral epic narrative poem.  Byliny singers loosely utilize historical fact greatly embellished with fantasy or hyperbole to create their songs.  The word Bylina is derived from the past tense of the verb “to be” (Russian: быть byt') and implies “something that was.”  The term most likely originated with scholars of Russian folklore; in 1839, Sakharov, a Russian folklorist, published an anthology of Russian folklore, a section of which he titled “Byliny of the Russian People,” causing the popularization of the term.  Later scholars believe that Sakharov misunderstood the word bylina in the opening of Igor’ Tale as “an ancient poem.” The folk singers of byliny called these songs stariny (Russian: старины) or starinki (Russian: старинки) meaning stories of old.

""Чики-брики и иже с ними - мемчик, порожденный внимательными игроками, которые растащили на цитаты всю забавную чушь, что присутствует в озвучке бандитов. Чики-брики и в дамки - любимая фраза англоязычных игроков, благодаря своему необычному звучанию. Дословно означает какой-то призыв к действию, ""врыву"", ""рашу"". ""А ну чики-брики и в дамки"" - ""Вперед на врыве"", ""В атаку"". ""  It's a call for action. ""Attack!""  The phrase itself is a reference to a famous soviet movie ""Место встречи изменить нельзя"": ""Пиф-паф - и в дамки!"" (Шарапов)  The ""cheeki-breeki"" part itself has no more meaning than ""bow chicka wow wow"" and is a playful non-formal slang expression which could mean basically anything. Google image search gives pretty much STALKER-related pics, so it's a meme.  In that fan-made animation the person who said that phrase very confidently made one of his checker a king."

This is what Wikipedia has to say on the subject:     В переносном смысле «чайниками» также называют неопытных людей, новичков в каком-то деле. Это идёт из 60-х годов, когда началось увлечение альпинизмом и горными лыжами. Новички любили позировать для фотографий уперев одну руку в бок, а другую отведя немного в сторону и положив сверху на воткнутые в землю лыжные палки. По форме это напоминало чайник."

There are a lot of seasons of the show up on youtube, but the easy ones to find are of low quality.

You are asking your question to strangers on the internet who know nothing about your course, so there's no way we can really tell you the words you need to know to understand the teacher. Why not speak to classmates in the course and ask them for help? Do you have the textbook and class handouts from the last 5 years that you can read to review what has been covered, including vocabulary?  On the internet you can find lists of 100 most used verbs and stuff like that, but whether they really are applicable to your exact situation is unclear. These lists are not made to help you understand a specific person. Also, just knowing words is not enough to understand what people say; you have to know the different endings for nouns, adjectives, and verbs to understand how they function in a sentence.

russian,31lvg7,demichka,3,Mon Apr 6 12:46:30 2015 UTC,"English has ""phrasal verbs"", where you add a preposition to a verb to create a new meaning. For instance, ""find out"" means something very different from ""find"" or ""out"".  There are multiple possibilities: ""get up"", ""get down"", ""get off"", ""get out"", ""get away"", ""get away with"", ""get over it"", ""I'll get on it right away"", ""get by with a little help from my friends"", and sometimes the meaning is relatively obvious but often it's not.  This is actually a major unappreciated difficulty in learning English.  Russian does the same, except the preposition comes at the beginning of the verb, and it's joined to the word instead of remaining separate. Just like in English, you really have to learn each of these preposition+verb combinations as a new, separate word, whose meaning cannot always be correctly guessed."

Пятилетний Саша Акимов – музыкант. Он служит и живёт в Брестской крепости, где часто играет со своей подругой, Аней. Их жизни очень типичные до 21 июня 1941 года. В этот день фашисты начинают осаду крепости. Саша и другие солдаты, конечно, сопротивляются. Но это очень трудно для русских солдат потому, что немцы их превосходят численно. Кинозрителям показывают противостояние защитников крепости, которое часто кровавое. Несмотря на кровь, фильм в основном показывает отношения между солдатами - Сашей и Аней. Мы видим широкий спектр эмоций, от любви до огорчения и от ненависти до заботы. Эмоции, которые актеры демонстрируют, так сильны, что зрители тоже их чувствуют. В фильме «Брестская Крепость», в противоположность другим фильмам о войне, кинозрителям невозможно забыть, что солдаты в крепости такие же люди. Этот фильм отличный, и я всем его рекомендую. Основанный на реальных событиях, фильм «Брестская Крепость» западает в память. Активная прекрасная, сюжет очень интересный, и достаточно действия для развлечения. Конец фильма печальный, но это ожидаемо в военных фильмах. В общем, «Брестская Крепость» - очень хороший фильм.    ""Активная прекрасная"" - ?"

For example, in the word, молоко, the first ""o"" is slightly more like ""uh,"" the second closer to ""ah,"" and the third is pronounced ""o.""  There will be some regional differences in the extent to which this reduction is exhibited in speech (I can't confirm, but they tell me that in Moscow the reduction will be even more noticeable than it is among people from the Urals, where I currently live).    A general piece of advice: don't try to learn Russian sounds as equivalents to sounds you're familiar with in English or any other language.  Don't think of и and ы as variations of ""i.""   Think of them as и and ы.  This advice extends to the language.  It helps in the beginning to think of ""У меня есть ___"" as ""I have __,"" but there is a point where trying to understand the meaning of words and grammatical structures as they relate to your native language will do a lot more harm than good.  I know a lot of people who speak Russian and know a lot more vocabulary than me, have been studying it a lot longer than me, but never really tried to forget English and abandon the idea that there should be a one-to-one analogue for every concept or phrase.  These people often sound kind of ridiculous when they speak Russian.  They use English phrases, only replacing the necessary Russian words (a common example I use: ""take a shower.""  If you use the word ""take"" as in to acquire possession of something, reaching out and picking it up, in reference to a shower, it has nothing to do with getting into the bathroom, turning on the water, and cleaning yourself off, which is what you had in mind).    Sorry for the sudden lecture, just thought that it might be useful to hear, and it applies to anyone learning any language.  Anyway, good luck and добро пожаловать в клуб!"

russian,31ewyx,jboehmer17,4,Sun Apr 5 04:00:00 2015 UTC,"The o-a shift is a feature of Russian (and other slavic languages). Basically a non stressed 'o' will be pronounced 'a'. I found that the best way to go about this at first is to learn words with the proper accentuation. After a while, you will start to get the hang of it and won't need to pay so much attention to it, as you will 'guess' where the stress is located.   As for 'и' and 'ы' those are actually two different letters. 'и' would be an 'ee' sounds in english, while 'ы' comes from the bottom of the mouth, here is an example of it. It might take some practice to get it right, but it is good fun to practice"
russian,31ewyx,morton_luthor,4,Sat Apr 4 12:49:56 2015 UTC,"The reason 'о' will sound like 'ah' sometimes is because of the way Russian stress works. Basically, in every Russian word, there is only one letter stressed. In половинка the 'и' is stressed, making all the other letters unstressed. This means you'll emphasize this letter more than any other. When 'о' is unstressed, it will sound like 'ah' and when it's stressed, it will make it's 'oh' sound. There is no real patterns to Russian stress so you'll just have to memorize the stress of every word when you learn it.  It's hard to explain the pronunciation of 'ы,' so I recommend you watch a video about it, (that's how I learned.)"

russian,31ewyx,supergnawer,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"1st problem   It depends on where the stress is. A stressed ""о"" stays an ""о"" In case of ""половинка"" the stress is on the third syllable(половИнка). In case of ""Тобой"" the stress is on the second ""о""(тобОй).  I am a native speaker and I can't really give advice on how to learn where to put the stress. I think it can be very irregular sometimes, e.g. compare ""зОлото"", ""болОто"" and ""долотО""."
russian,31ewyx,godlikesme,1 point,Sat Apr 4 12:49:53 2015 UTC,"It's ""nachnova"", not ""nachnoga"". Most native speakers don't even pay attention to this oddity. Fortunately this is regular, all adjectives that end in ""...go"" are pronounced with ""...va"".  Ы/И is tricky, as with most sounds that don't exist in your native language you have to struggle with it initially. You can approximate it this way: try transitioning between English ""ee"" to ""i"" (as in beet/bit). Notice how the the position of your tongue changes. You will probably observe that the tongue is pulled back somewhat. Now continue pulling it back even further, without changing your lips or throat configuration. That'd be your Ы sound. I'm not a professional phonologist so I'm sure I'm not explaining it perfectly. There are some tube videos, search ""how to pronounce ы""."
russian,31ewyx,ihamsa,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:17:33 2015 UTC,You actually do have to learn every word. And и/e also change around.
russian,31ewyx,rrssh,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, as everyone else has said, when the o appears in an unstressed syllable, it sounds like ""ah"". As far as the difference between ы and и - you need to be listening to Russian. They are two different letters with two different sounds and mixing them up can sometimes mean saying the wrong word. It's difficult to explain in words the difference, so if you're just reading about them, yes, they might sound like the same letter. But you'll get the hang of it if you listen to the difference closely."

russian,31ewyx,ruplumograenum,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"1st problem   This is difficult for most foreigners to learn. English is not as heavily dependent on stressed vowels as Russian is. O and A sound like eachother when they are not stressed in the word. In some Russian dialects it is easier to distinguish what the ""real"" letter is, but most words sound different from the way they are spelled (this is also the case for some paired constonants as well). Most words can be conjugated or otherwise manipulated into stressing an unstressed syllable in order to hear whether it is and O or an A. Aside from that, you may also need to learn all possible parts of a word. For example, there is no prefix ""ПА"", only ""ПО"". Therefore, if you know that the unstressed syllable is in the prefix, you know that it has to be an O. But that means you need to know your word parts and prefixes.   Unfortunately, there are also words that cannot be conjugated in any way to figure out a particular syllable - those are words the spelling of which you must memorize by heart or look up in a dictionary.   2nd problem   The Ы sound does not exist in English, so auditory exposure is pretty much the only way to learn to catch the difference. Writing-wise it is is also difficult to distinguish and often ends up in similar situations like the O/A mix-up. However this letter comes with it's own rules, so sometimes it is easier to figure out.  Personally, I think the Ы sound is similar to jutting out your lower jaw and grunting ""ugh"" without the u/a sound at the beginning, leaving only the ""gh"". At the very least, that should be a good place to start."
russian,31ewyx,VirtualInk,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, based on the 3 languages I've studied, excluding my native English, Russian is not something you can just semi-learn or casually pick up. It's just too complicated. Nouns change, verbs change, pronouns change, it can make your head spin. And it's not just 2 or 3 forms.  Look no further than all the forms of you, your, yours, and the plural form of you which doesn't exist in English. Then when you see all the changes verbs undergo. Forgetaboutit!  I say dive in. Take the plunge. Learn the language. Come on down here in the deep in with the rest of us."

russian,319bpd,Ass_cunt_666,9,Fri Apr 3 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry, no idea how to explain all this mess, since I'm a native speaker.   On top of that I'm a little confused about the meanings of ехать and ездить.    ""Ехать"" implies ""one-time action"". ""Ездить"" implies ""regular action"".    Another question: I'm so confused on (prefix)езжать words. I don't understand where it comes into play.   Well, I guess Russian is complicated. ""приезжать"" means ""to arrive"", ""уезжать"" means ""to leave"". ""Отъезжать"" means something in-between of these two, like interrupted action, but it is kinda complicated. ""Поезжать"" isn't used in modern Russian.   I'm not so sure on when to use, say ходить over идти.   This one is actually easy to explain. ""Ходить"" implies regular action. ""Идти"" implies one-time action.  EDIT:     But my question is what does по mean in the context of verbs of motion. (походить/пойти)?   ""Походить""  can be used in the context of chess/board games(e.g. ""Походить конем""), but it can't be used as verb related to a person. (I hope this makes sense).  ""Пойти"" can be used here. It is somewhat difficult to explain, but ""Я пошел"" is basically something like ""I've just left""/""I've just gone"". (Though it can be used as ""I'm leaving"")  EDIT2: Russian/English is a mess."
russian,319bpd,godlikesme,4,Fri Apr 3 01:18:30 2015 UTC,Don't apologize that was a great explanation! Thank you very much!
russian,319bpd,agrostis,3,Fri Apr 3 02:21:06 2015 UTC,"Походить конём is very rusticated and shouldn't be used by language learners. Better to say пойти... or сходить...  По- when used with iterative motion verbs has a regular meaning of moving repeatedly for a while and then stopping. So, походил, поездил, поплавал mean “he walked/drove/swam around for a while”. Btw., this use of по- is not limited to verbs of motion: покурил, погоревал, попрограммировал, etc. mean “he smoked/grieved/programmed/... for a while”.  With non-iterative motion verbs, the meaning is more complex: that the subject has begun or shall begin to move, but the motion is not over, or its outcome is unknown or unspecific. In the future tense, this is just the neutral way of saying that the motion is going to happen: я пойду на работу = “I'll go to work”, он поплывёт на тот берег = “he'll swim to the other bank”. In the past tense, the meaning can be that the subject has not yet arrived at the destination or returned to the origin (whichever is expected by the interlocutors). Otherwise, the arrival can be described by a separate verb in a coordinative construction: они поехали по магазинам и вернулись только к вечеру = “they went shopping and didn't come back until the evening”; они поехали ночным поездом и прибыли в Иркутск на следующий день = “they took an overnight train and arrived in Irkutsk the next morning”. Or else the arrival/return can be the unimportant, backgrounded part of the locution: после того, как Гагарин полетел в космос, он стал самым популярным человеком на планете = “after Gagarin went to space, he became the most popular man on the planet”; that Gagarin has come back from space is common knowledge and so less important than his going there, his becoming popular, and the causal relation between the two."

russian,319bpd,godlikesme,3,Fri Apr 3 02:27:56 2015 UTC,"Пойти is for going somewhere. Я пошел домой. Уйти is for leaving somewhere. Я ушел из дома. While one implies the other (я ушел из дома и пошел в магазин), most of the time you would use the one that's more important to emphasize."

It certainly entails that the subject has not returned or even arrived at his destination at the time of the event, but it doesn't imply that he didn't arrive or return later, or the other way round.

russian,312yvo,Deadpoliticosociety,4,Wed Apr 1 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"I'm on the 2nd course, lecture 22 and I'm a believer. I will be purchasing the accelerator course once I'm done. I took 3 years of French in High school and took Spanish in College. This course has been far more effective than any academic classes I've ever taken in a language before.   The lesson's obviously get harder, but as long as I stick to a new course every other day, and review in between, I'm golden. There are some points I need to spend a little more time on, but for the most part, most of what I've learned from this course has stuck and is really working for me. I'm a fan.  My study habits  Day 1- New lesson in the morning. I will always pause and write out and say each phrase and word. Aside from writing in a notebook all the examples, ect, I write all the new words and phrases on flash cards and hang them on my wall.  During the day, I sometimes spend 15-20 minutes going over the exercises for that lesson that are downloadable from the site. I don't do this every day because I'm at work and can't speak out loud, but I should as even the mental reps help.   Day 2 - I review the previous days lesson, writing in a notebook each phrase, words as if I hadn't had the lesson before. Also speaking everything. basically a repeat of the previous day, only it's not a new lesson and I don't make new flash cards.   Day 3 - New lesson, etc repeat same stuff I did on day 1.   On Saturdays, after my review or new lesson, where ever I'm at,  I spend extra time writing. I'll try to write a paragraph using everything I know.  Even if it's rambling sentences of what I like, love, live, etc. Anything to try and use the different forms of verbs and all the vocab and grammar.  I then try to write it in cursive using the Penguin Russian Course book. (I haven't used that book for studying yet. I just use it to practice cursive writing)  Through out the week, I message Russian friends I've made helping them with English and trying to use the Russian I know. it's here I learn how to type in Russian as I have Russian keyboards installed on all my computers, work, home, phone, etc. I'm finally to a point where I'm not lost on the keyboard but I'm still slow. I try to type each word as opposed to copying and pasting, but I do keep a word doc of most of what I know at work to reference.   I was skyping on weekends with Russians, but after the 4th time, I didn't feel I was getting anything out of it yet, as I don't know enough Russian to carry a conversation yet.   I also watch some Russian TV a bit during the week. Not a lot since I need subtitles. But I try to watch a couple of hours a week. In my car, I listen to Russian music periodically."
russian,312yvo,anubis_1993,2,Wed Apr 1 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe this doesn't answer your question but I'll give you some advice as someone who has been studying Russian for 3 years and lived here for the past year and a half. BY FAR the most important thing you need to do to learn Russian is find people to speak with and speak every day. You can feel like you have certain aspects of the language mastered in front of a computer screen or a book but as soon as someone comes up to you and starts speaking Russian, you lose everything. The way we really access language in our brain is by using it over and over in conversation. I still sound like an ignorant fool speaking in Russian, but I am becoming more and more successful at getting people to understand what I want to say"
russian,312yvo,diracula85,2,Sun Apr 5 17:04:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. I really don't have anyone i can speak to in Russian everyday in conversation sadly, Although my sister is now joining me in learning from Russianmadeeasy so we can practice off each other, i don't know how affective that will be but i guess its something. Where did you start leaning Russian."

So far I am only on podcast 3 so I dont want to get to ahead of myself.  My fear is that the farther I move on the things ive learned ill start to forget. Any tips to keep all that ive leanred fresh in my mind throughout learning all the new stuff?"
russian,312yvo,anubis_1993,2,Thu Apr 2 19:34:35 2015 UTC,"My 2 biggest pieces of advice are 1 - write it all down / take notes and 2 - be sure to review the previous lesson the next day. That helps a lot. If I make very few mistakes in the review (the day after my lesson), I'll start a new lesson the following day (day 1 - lesson day 2 - review  day 3-new lesson). If I make a lot of mistakes and feel the material isn't sticking, I'll use an extra day to review that lesson. But by writing everything and speaking, I'm helping cement it.   As you learn more, you'll notice that he keeps using previously learned material, so some of it you won't have to worry about. You'll see it again and again.  It's not like you learn something and then never see it again. He builds on what he teaches you. This will help cement it.  question: are you using the podcasts from the russian made easy website? I think these are missing the videos. If so, check out Udemy.com. Exact same course, only it provides those same lessons in video format so you can see how to spell the words.  All 30 courses are on there. The first 15 are free, and the remaining are $19.    After each lesson, I head to the Russian made easy website and download the pdf's to go over later in the day."

russian,30vjip,Ducreux4U,9,Tue Mar 31 01:21:37 2015 UTC,"One thing I love my literature teachers most of all for, is the idea that there is absolutely no sense in learning all the exact dates, year by year. What is the use of knowing, whether it was 1835 or 1836? Usually a decade is what matters the most - 1830's, while decades is what defines political, social and and any other kind of public life in any country. If you know what was going there in that very decade, you can easily see how it influenced a certain author and why he or she wrote this very thing.   It always disappoints me, when people know all the dates but can't draw the simpliest analogies between social events and literature movements.   This test is a waste of time. That's it."
russian,30vjip,Shurik_13,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"One good thing about this test is if you get the decade right, you'll get some points (or not lose too many). I made it through 18 rounds on the second try by guessing the right years on a couple questions— I just answered the beginning of a decade.   Your teachers are right of course, but I think the better you know the history that inspired the literature, the better you'll be familiar with dates.   I wouldn't say it's a waste of time. It's a way of knowing what writers you're familiar with, how much you don't know about them, and what  writers you don't know enough about.  It's a good concept. Whoever developed this test should make it a little bit easier.  *and let you review the questions and your answers."

And sure, it would be a bit too harsh to call it a total waste of time :) Still, if we consider the classical soviet educational system (which is the best in terms of teaching the Russian language and literature), my classmates and I have never ever been made to learn any other dates, but the years of life of authors. I guess, this test, being a kind of a game, is more American-like. And that doesn't make it less captivating :)"
russian,30vjip,supergnawer,9,Tue Mar 31 05:33:42 2015 UTC,"This test almost comically represents the way they taught Russian Lit in my school. I suspect it could even be a parody, not a real test. Basically, instead of encouraging students to think about the problems raised in a book, teacher would require them to memorize a set of facts about it, including key points of the one ""recommended"" way to understand its meaning, and some numbers like these. Attempts to find some meaning other than the ""recommended"" one would actually get you something like ""C"" (I've tried that). It's an easy way to teach it, because it's straightforward, objective, and doesn't require any creativity from either teacher or the students. I'm not saying this was the right or intended way to teach that, it was just a bad teaching, and it's not specific to this subject. Combine that with the fact that Dostoevsky and Tolstoi did not exactly write for 14-year-olds, and you'll see why many russians are not fans of classic literature."
russian,30vjip,dys206,4,Tue Mar 31 10:05:48 2015 UTC,My result - a toddler. I've got only one correct answer. I have no idea how is this test relevant to the Russian literature.

If you know a native speaker, you can read out loud to them and have them correct your sounds; that's the format of my phonetics class at russian University in moscow"
russian,30oj8g,randumtoon,7,Sun Mar 29 12:26:15 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound odd, but hear me out.  I think that each language/culture has a common combination of how people's mouths are constructed and how people hold their mouth and jaw.  If you emulate this, then your accent will improve dramatically.  For people who are fluent, they don't notice it, because they long ago stopped needing to exaggerate it.  Over time, try to de-emphasize what I am about to say, but it does work.  For Russian, jut your chin out and open your mouth wide on the vowels.  I imagine myself like Russian mafia :-)  I have tried to explain to my wife that all Russian speakers jut their chin out, and she thinks I'm crazy.  If I do it without telling her I am, though, she says she can understand me much better.  I think that Russian vowels require that your tongue has more room to move around on the bottom.  It is really helps for the difference between и (back)/ы (forward) and ш (back)/щ (forward).  I think it is also very much easier to emphasize ь properly with that extra space for your tongue.  If you say приветь with your chin out, it is actual almost impossible not to say ь.  Consequently, I first developed this theory when I heard that in Japan, it is extremely rude to show your tongue.  If you want to get rid of your accent in Japanese, try to pretend like you are trying to make sure no one ever sees your tongue.  I work with a lot of Japanese people.  I know this works.  Try saying ""watashi wa nihongo ga wakatimasen"" in ""English"" and then once more while hiding your tongue."
russian,30oj8g,MaunoBrau,5,Sun Mar 29 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"I think you're onto something with this advice. One thing along those same lines that helps me:  Listen to the way native speakers ""hesitate"" when speaking or add filler sounds like ""um"" and ""ah."" The vowel sounds in those ""um""/""ah"" words sound a bit different in each language and sort of reveal how the speakers' mouths and throats are positioned when making sounds."

You didn't learn grammar rules of your native language right away so don't fall into that trap with Russian. Russian is tough, so trying to tackle the hardest part right out of the gate will make it seem impossible. I would recommend checking out Russian Made easy on Udemy. The first 15 lessons are free and uses contextual learning. You'll learn 3 of the cases without even realizing it. Really makes it easier when you learn it by pattern as opposed to memorizing from a grammar book. But first, learn the Cyrillic alphabet. It's not as daunting as you may think and will go a long way to helping you learn the language. Work at it every day. Don't let how hard it is deter you, as there are harder languages.  Besides, anything worth having or knowing is usually hard."
russian,308x4k,kcnrd,2,Wed Mar 25 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"I am dubious about the idea of not paying attention to grammar rules. The context in which young children learn a language is completely different from that in which older people (usually) learn a language. A child has a couple of years just hearing things before starting to say anything serious, for instance. Learning the grammatical rules in a new language hardly seems like a ""trap,"" especially if you want to be aware of the correct way to speak."

I'm not saying not to learn grammar, I'm just saying don't get bogged down trying to learn all the grammar rules. It will only confuse you.  The old system of studying grammar and memorizing vocab does not work. That's why only a small portion of American's are bilingual. It's not the lack of interest in learning a 2nd language, it's the method in which it's taught. There are simply more effective ways to learn a language."

You cannot learn any skill without making at least a few mistakes (and probably a lot of mistakes when it comes to a brand new language).

Learn the stress in the non-declined/non-conjugated form. For verbs, learn the infinitive in both perfective and imperfective, and just note which conjugation type it is. Eventually you'll know the patterns for conjugation type by heart and won't need to continue doing this. A lot of words have a particular case that follows them, and some people say it's important to memorize this, but I think this can mostly be picked up naturally.   Good luck!"

russian,2zsz8k,AMDcze,2,Sat Mar 21 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"Since the most unpredictable are nouns, I'm gonna tell you something about them.

Exceptions: b') Singular instrumental has stem stressed (e.g. вошь). d') Singular accusative has stem stressed (e.g. спина). f') Singular accusative has stem stressed (e.g. рука). f'') Singular instrumental has stem stressed (e.g. грудь).      Nouns a b c d e f    Singular stem ending stem ending stem ending   Plural nominative (and accusative if inanimate) stem ending ending stem stem stem   Rest of plural stem ending ending stem ending ending   Example мотор вещество слой вино корень полоса    You don't really need to remember it but you should be aware these exist, so for example if you know the plural dative is stressed on stem, so will be plural instrumental and so on.    You should also know that sometimes the prepositions are stressed instead of nouns (e.g. за город).    I hope this isn't too overwhelming and actually helps."

Seems like a lot of these occur with kinship terms, as well as the occasional noun like человек or раз, which are the same in their genitive plural forms as they are in the nominative singular.

Practically, this effect suggests that ""cramming"" (intense, last-minute studying) the night before an exam is not likely to be as effective as studying at intervals in a longer time frame. Important to note, however, is that the benefit of spaced presentations does not appear at short retention intervals [quantify], in which massed presentations tend to lead to better memory performance.

I only add words that I've heard somewhere, in conversation or in a book, and that I wish to make sure I'll remember. I also prefer adding words with concrete rather than abstract meanings, and mostly I'll add words where the other side of the flashcard can be an image I ripped from Google Images (in fact, only 3 of the last 50 cards I added contain text).  Can you find graded readers in a library near to you? They're books with limited vocabulary, so you can read comfortably and pick up new words without being frustrated. They come in varying levels, corresponding to how big the vocabulary is they're based on. I found a few on Amazon as well.  You can also watch Russian television. I might be mistaken, but I think the news on Первый Канал is subtitled, which'll make it easier to look up unknown words."

russian,2zbfl9,CzarNicholas28,17,Tue Mar 17 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"First piece of advice: check up your imaginary names with a native Russian all the time. It doesn't cost you much in time (and sometimes has a null cost in resources), but really saves you the embarrassment it may cause to those who know Russian and read your badass-sounding name as something as silly as ""SS Pussykittenish"" just because of a few odd letters.  A spacecraft in Russia may be named after a prominent city, or a good person to honor their legacy.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_Russia_by_population http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_Russian_Navy_ships http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_people  And, if you don't want to reach somebodysetupusthebomb level of Rashan in your game, if a person is female, add an ""-a"" to the end of the surname (Olga Zelenina, not Olga Zelenin). Some surnames don't change based on gender: again, consult a native Russian all the time if you don't want a whammy.  A good point I take from the Strugatsky brothers: Russia is a multinational country. Remember how many countries were in ex-USSR? A lot of people from these countries settled in Russia, and a lot of them are really decent but unknown persons in their industries. Especially people from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and the like: they are like Mexicans in America -- hardworking, usually resorting to menial jobs out of despair, but the parents REALLY urge their children to become professionals and grace their families with great honor to pay off the hard work of the previous generations. One of the most famous photon reactor spaceships in a Strugatsky sci-fi cycle was named ""Takhmasib,"" after an Azerbaijani scientist and space researcher.  So, to add some truth, use names and locations from the ex-USSR areas -- especially those obscure to the general English-speaking population. It will sound awesome, and you will get mad respect from people from those regions. You have no idea how people like to see positive protagonists and nice spacecraft named after their copatriots or cities: imagine me getting excited over Minsc from Baldur's Gate and Samara from Mass Effect.  If you want especially mad props, give every second or third prominent scientist or general a surname from the ex-USSR republics, especially from Georgia, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and the like, and especially add some details from the culture of their native land (i.e. the ships pay respect to the national heritage of people they are named after in some way, or even serve as honorary protectors of good relations between various nations for their sake, rebel or not: a good lead-up to expand your universe).   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_Armenians http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Azerbaijanis http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_from_Belarus http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Estonians http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kazakhs http://www.catsystem.kg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=36&Itemid=173&lang=en http://www.behindthename.com/names/usage/kyrgyz http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lithuanians http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Moldovans http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_East_European_Jews http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jews_born_in_the_Russian_Empire_and_the_Soviet_Union http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_on_stamps_of_Tajikistan http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Turkmenistan_people http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Uzbeks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Georgians http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_born_in_Ukraine    If you are not afraid of potential controversy, you can add Ukrainian surnames, but it might tear up the fandom in the current situation. An odd title may come from Indian, Chinese, American Indian or even American names or landmarks, but it must be something really out-of-place, or a really honorable gift from that nation (say, a gift that helped overturn a war so much they left its name).  If you name universities, more likely they will have a lot of ""of"" (at least a single one) due to a popular translation mistake (we're more likely to say ""wall of stone"" than ""stone wall""). A particularily peculiar institution may even have a mistranslation in its title (Squirrel Institute or ""codename 'Institute Squirrel', based on what our informer said"" instead of Protein Research Institute, for example) if you want to say it is very low-level or mask its true nature.  And, since ""what I tell you three times is true,"" consult a native Russian on this point whenever you want to add something like that. PM me if you find my ramblings at least somewhat interesting. My experience in writing stuff for fantasy and sci-fi universes might help."
russian,2zbfl9,danila_penzanews,5,Tue Mar 17 09:21:15 2015 UTC,"One more point: some innocent Russian words may sound really imposing or scary for other languages -- or even alien. Just look through the names for Russian modules:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station#Pressurised_modules  These all are really innocent, but, really, for an American the word ""Nauka"" may sound like something straight out of an alien world, and ""Mrak"" or ""Yeralash"" may sound much scarier than ""Darkness"" or ""Silly Chaos"". Use them sparingly and with really good research.  With good use, it is going to be as badass as Japanese words littered here and there. Remember the ""nadsat"" lingo or the Shadowrun slang?

russian,2zachh,Rusty_Gadget,2,Tue Mar 17 01:19:47 2015 UTC,"""Let there be light!"" said the electrician and cut the wires.  That's pretty much a literal translation. Do you see the humor in it now? Some Russian humor is not translatable because it's tied so much into the Russian psyche."
russian,2zachh,veruha,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:08:19 2015 UTC,Is it funny because the electrician is stupid?  Or because the electrics are so bad the light is better with the lights off?  Or...?  Я очень хочу понимать...
russian,2zachh,Rusty_Gadget,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:58:39 2015 UTC,I think it's irony. The phrase is sometimes used when somebody makes a mistake. You know how it's customary to make fun of certain types of people? My memory of this is foggy by now but from what I remember it was not unusual to make all electricians/plumbers/other handymen to be alcoholic screwups.  Trying to explain a joke usually kills it. I'll wait for the pitchforks to come out.

There are a lot of very pop-ish and stupid love songs that kinda close to hip-hop tempo. There are just some shitty level wannabe woman rappers, like Альбина Сафарова.  You can try listening to songs with woman vocal from some other music styles: Ёлка Наадя Катя Чехова Маша и Медведи Мельница / Хелависа Краснознаменная дивизия имени моей бабушки Ночные снайперы / Диана Арбенина Мураками Жанна Агузарова Alai Oli АлоэВера Блондинка Ксю Tractor Bowling Louna Слот"

Her pronunciation is quite clear, and her voice is low-pitched enough to not annoy me. (I have a thing about vocal pitch.)

The most well-known Russian female rapper is Гидропонка, she's actually the only one I've ever heard of before. These two girls also seem somewhat popular, but judging solely by the lyrics I'd rather stick with the first one."

russian,2z75rz,kcnrd,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:13:30 2015 UTC,"That is a great bit of advice!  I will save up for that.  It looks seriously helpful.    The main issues I am having are:    When to use у, от, or вы.  Don't they all mean ""to exit from?"" When to use the transport or footwalking verbs.  Like the difference between проходить / пройти and проезжать / проехать.  I think I have the verbal aspect down, but in which situations do I use each respective form?   I thought it was as simple as, if they are going to another city or country, default to ездить / ехать. Otherwise, use ходить / идти.  However when it comes to the prefixed forms, that thinking seems to go out the форточка.   Those are my two biggest issues with grasping these verbs.    For reference, the prefixes we are learning in this chapter are:   при- у- в/въ- про- пере- до- вы- под- от-"
russian,2z75rz,spyrothefox,4,Mon Mar 16 05:13:37 2015 UTC,"When to use у, от, or вы. Don't they all mean ""to exit from?""     Уходить - when you were AT some place (has a more metaphorical meaning). Я ушёл оттуда - I left that place. Я ушёл домой - I went home. Отходить -  when you were NEAR something or someone. Я отошёл от него - I moved away from him. Выходить - when you were IN some place (has a more physical meaning). Я вышел из комнаты - I exited the room."

russian,2z5lqo,fishmael,10,Sun Mar 15 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"For ""check smth out"" there's ""зацени"" (imperative form), like in ""Check out my new phone"" - ""Зацени мой новый телефон"". For ""to hang out"" - ""зависать"" (infinitive), which is practically a literal translation, for example ""We used to hang out at my place all the time"" - ""Раньше мы постоянно зависали у меня дома"". Both are quite informal."
russian,2z5lqo,ilyuhman,12,Sun Mar 15 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"Зависать seems to be a novelty though. In my generation (mid-30s), the word is тусоваться or тусить."

Ну и ""hang out"" в моем понимании ближе ко второму, а для ""тусования"" есть то же ""party""."
russian,2z5lqo,ilyuhman,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:25:55 2015 UTC,"""тусовка"" предполагает какой-то движ   Да, вот в чем разница.  Обычно, когда ""тусуемся"" - значит, собираемся в баре, кафе или каким-то подобном месте, а не дома ""зависаем"".  Все-таки, по-моему оба означают ""hang out"".  Хотя бы я так и говорю по-английски, когда в баре тусуемся, we're hanging out, но ""party"" тоже можно сказать."

This takes years of practice for most people in most languages."

Although for a bunch of minor interactions, there are no subtitles at all.  I can't tell if it's a good idea to have the subtitles on, though, because I find I'm more likely to just read them and tune out the audio. I guess maybe I should just work on reading them in time with the audio."
