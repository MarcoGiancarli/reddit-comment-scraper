Some bubbles formed on my crust while it was baking and they used the same tool to poke the bubbles as they use on all the other pizzas.  I pointed it out to the guy behind the counter and he completely ignored me and said something like ""Yeah, when I started working here there was some concern about cooking them together with the same oven.""  I explained the problem again and was offered no apology nor did they offer to make me a new pizza.  Just told me ""Well, normally the gluten free crust doesn't bubble.""  I got sick."

UCSantaBarbara,3e47b8,TinKnight,11,Tue Jul 21 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"You can't get CS8 your first quarter because it's reserved for CS majors. You can't make honors your first quarter because you apply annually, not quarterly."
UCSantaBarbara,3e47b8,shrekluver,3,Tue Jul 21 20:50:28 2015 UTC,It looks like cs8 is actually open to pre-mathematical science from the start.   http://imgur.com/gI7uhvR  Edit: meant for this to be a reply.
UCSantaBarbara,3e47b8,IBleedTeal,4,Tue Jul 21 21:54:07 2015 UTC,I was Actuarial Science at orientation last year and they still didn't let me add it even tho I had it pass 1. Engineering makes sure all the CS majors are taken care of before letting anyone else in.
UCSantaBarbara,3e47b8,One_Bad_Guanaco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:17:56 2015 UTC,Seriously?  They should fix that on gold then because I'd be pissed if that happened.  Actually I guess it makes sense to make sure the freshman slots go to those in the major but that's still a bummer. Do you know if non incoming freshman can sign up pass 1?
UCSantaBarbara,3e47b8,IBleedTeal,2,Tue Jul 21 23:57:58 2015 UTC,"Just fyi I'm currently finishing up my last class to petition to transfer (CS40) and according to what Benji (the CS advisor)  has told us, we are probably the last ones who'll be able to actually successfully switch. It was pretty hard before but now it'll apparently be impossible with the new changes to the requirements. So if you're committed to CS I'd advise you to see if you could maybe still accept one of your other offers because it's pretty unlikely that you'll actually be able to switch here.   With that said, you will definitely not get CS8 at orientation since they save that class for CS majors only during fall. Other majors that are required to take it don't get priority until Winter and Spring. Also if you've programmed before you should just take CS 16 because if you're really serious about switching, you need to be done with all the requirements by next fall to have the best chance to switch, if its even possible at that point.   I hope I could help, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, its just the truth :("
UCSantaBarbara,3e47b8,One_Bad_Guanaco,2,Tue Jul 21 22:02:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't give up based on this. I think it's common for them to tell people they probably won't get in because it's extremely impacted and competitive. They'd rather discourage people from trying to switch than see them try and fail. I was told I most likely wouldn't get into EE when I was trying to switch from ChE, but I ended up getting in. You just have to really stay on top of your grades.       So it's very risky, but if you're serious about switching in, then it will take a fuckton of commitment"
UCSantaBarbara,3e47b8,UCSBEE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:13 2015 UTC,"It's true that when I asked professors about it they'd always tell me that it was impossible, but Benji, being the homie that he is, would always tell us that it wasn't actually that hard as long as you met the requirements. But now he's saying that its almost gonna be impossible even if you meet the requirements. So I completely believe Benji if he says that it's impossible that its probably impossible, but the OP should email him and see what he has to say, I'm just reiterating what he told those of us in CS40 rn."

CCS also has a reputation for being very rigorous but extremely supportive and communal, which it is. As for UCSB itself, it's very laid back but has an excellent academic reputation. I'll be honest, I didn't think I would get in with just my grades and test scores, so I was just happy that I got in to UCSB at all. It was also several hundred miles away from where I grew up!  10/10 would undergrad there again."

That's not what a job is for. That being said, most on campus jobs allow for minimal work hours (9 a week), and schedule for in between classes. I've taken about 19 units every quarter since I've been here and that's always been manageable. I'm not sure about mostly weekend hours, but for the three places I've worked weekend hours were minimal because campus activity is reduced.

UCSantaBarbara,3dsu1q,jaspershu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:36:08 2015 UTC,"I second all of these methods. I usually go the first week or two without my books to see if we need them. A lot of the time, the teachers have the books reserved in the library for use, so you don't even have to buy them. Last quarter, I probably only bought 2 books for my 16 units.  You can always share readers with a friend, since they tend to cost more and change every quarter. I have done this and saved a ton.  The book exchange is great, but I ended up buying a lot of books from Amazon. Scour the ""used"" section and a lot of books are heavily discounted. Sometimes, you can even find online pdf's for books for free (which has happened more times than not.)"

UCSantaBarbara,3douke,KingKyle,7,Sat Jul 18 01:08:21 2015 UTC,"I would always suggest a credit union because I like their philosophy and credit unions have never failed, unlike banks which are pretty much set up to fail. Golden 1 Credit Union has a location in Goleta somewhat near campus and also has an ATM right on campus at the arbor. Looking online they also have at least one branch in Fresno. People often complain about credit unions saying you have limited ATM access, but that's absolutely not true. You can use any credit union ATM that's in a credit union co-op network for no fee. So it doesn't matter that there isn't a Golden 1 outside of California, you can still access a ton of other ATMs for free.  https://www.golden1.com/checking/StudentChecking"

I was told that when I opened my credit union account about 7 or 8 years ago and believed it because it seemed plausible. I should have looked into it more myself. Not sure if it was old information (cursory research only finds credit unions failed since 2008ish but that might just be how the info is organized) or the agent opening my account was just completely misinformed. In any event, the list is much, much shorter than failed banks because of the generally more conservative nature of credit unions. But I thank you for pointing out my error."
UCSantaBarbara,3douke,trans-sister,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:32:20 2015 UTC,"I have a credit union and am generally pretty happy with them, but the fact that the only atm in town was in the arbor was annoying sometimes, since it's a long(er) trip if you're not on campus,  and you can't access it when the arbors closed."

Like the other commenter suggested it is a credit union which has a number of advantages over big banks (most notably much better rates). Additionally, the major disadvantage cited (not enough ATMs) is negated as MBT's policy is to cover any ATM fees you incur using another banks machine.

Careful though-you still have to follow parking rules on the street.  In other words, you can park forever for free in the SB public for-pay lots, but if you park right outside, and go over the 90 or whatever minutes, you'll get a ticket (don't ask me how I learned).

Other parts of SB are super uppity and fancy and everything is fine.  Ask around where you land and see how that particular street is.

Mine was an older high mileage bike, so it was upsetting but not the end of the world for me, never any major damage just scratched bars and frame sliders. The best thing is a cover, but I found a motion alarm helps a lot too, theyre cheap on ebay and dont drain your battery too much.

UCSantaBarbara,3dfwnq,electron_burgundy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:18:52 2015 UTC,There is a beach on campus which is covered by UCSB fire policy: http://policy.ucsb.edu/policies/policy-docs/bbq-open-burning.pdf  The policy is basically that you need a permit for any open fire.  I kind of doubt that UCSB would give you a permit for one as an individual but the Campus Fire Marshall is a friendly and reasonable guy and you could ask him.

From what I've heard, Trop's staff and facilities aren't up to par with UCSB Housing.    Also, I don't really see Trop being a freshman dorm... I know they're pushing to house at least half of continuing students in University housing, so along with the new apartments near FT, Trop will probably be turned into apartments for continuing students (like El Dorado and Westwinds)"

Trop was an incredible experience and community. The dining commons and the suites' living rooms were especially impressive. The RA-led activities were actually really fun and thoughtful. Visiting friends' dorms at FT and elsewhere made me feel very lucky to be at Trop. It would be heartbreaking if they replaced all of the staff. I can only speak for Del Norte's staff, but they were very kind, hardworking people. I still keep up with some of them now and again."

UCSantaBarbara,3db56g,piggychuu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:42:16 2015 UTC,"Everyone always says you shouldn't go to the same graduate university as undergraduate university. I did and I turned out okay. My buddy did and he's now a professor at ASU. Another old colleague did and he's a professor at Northeastern.  My perception is many universities desire their students to go to schools that are ranked higher in attempt to boost their own ratings. However, when it comes down to it, it should be a personal decision. Apply and attend wherever is best for you. I've yet to hear anyone be rejected from a position because they didn't attend a different university for grad school. Even if that does happen, would you really want to work some place where that was a decision criteria?"

UCSantaBarbara,3db56g,JaMMze,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"Mechanical engineering student here, in only a second year so I don't have that much experience. Pros: very small engineering department so you get to know your fellow engineers pretty well. It is also a great department all around and so far I have enjoyed all of my profs (besides my physics prof Freedman). Cons: might not get as much respect ad it deserves sometimes. People might say ""LOL party school"" but those people are usually the ones not smart enough to get into our engineering department anyways. Other schools can offer more hands on programs. For instance we don't have an actual baja team, just seniors work on it for their projects. And we only have one machine shop class at the moment."
UCSantaBarbara,3db56g,white_Steve_Nash,0,Wed Jul 15 23:59:58 2015 UTC,"tiring butthepeoplearecool...      But seriously: I would say UCSB's ECE program takes a HUGE toll on its students, mentally and physically. The professors are mostly good teachers and really interesting people to talk to, and most of your classmates become your very close friends. ECE is kind of broken, but I won't go into detail about it unless you really want to know."

UCSantaBarbara,3db56g,oceankissed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:38:53 2015 UTC,"This first point might also be true for the other engineering majors- the curriculum is so tight that many classes are only offered once a year and are pre-reqs to other classes that are also offered once a year. This means that if you mess up in one of these classes, you are for sure a year behind and since these classes are prereqs even for electives, you're kind of stuck in the dirt.      ECE specific things: I think they're changing up the lower-div circuits series (I'm not sure how exactly) but from what I've heard they're not considering how this will affect the preparation for upper divs which rely heavily on that lower-div series. This could screw a lot of people over. You may want to ask an undergrad advisor for more info.  We have the most personally expensive and I would say most time consuming labs on campus. We spend multiple sequential nights in the circuits labs slaving over projects that we...kinda aren't really meant to finish, and are not really given complete instructions for. That said, they're pretty useful and if they work, pretty fun. But going back to the cost - we spend HUNDREDS of dollars on buying lab parts that aren't guaranteed to work or even be the correct component. This is separate from tuition and a part of our program that I think is extremely unfair and broken.      All that said, I think the pros definitely outweigh the cons and I really like UCSB engineering. Going into my senior year now and looking back, I would not have gone anywhere else for my undergrad."

UCSantaBarbara,3d82rq,GauchoAlum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:46:20 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what noises your furniture is making but if it's the feet making noise on the tile floor when a chair is dragged or a non-level table wobbles then that can be helped with foam or felt furniture coasters that you can buy online or at Home Depot.  Putting anything soft or diffusing on the floor and wall to absorb the noise definitely helps.  With all hard surfaces at right angles the sound can bounce around without much loss.  Egg crate style foam on the walls is effective and cheap but not super unattractive.

I took the class about 2 years ago, but it was a guaranteed pass. There's only 1 assignment the whole year, which was a 1 or 2 page teaching philosophy. At the very end you get a LA evaluation.

No you don't go up to the front of the class to teach usually. You just walk around and answer questions. You're pretty much a TA that can't grade.

UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,ConvertsToMetric,2,Mon Jul 13 06:08:49 2015 UTC,Can Al not dunk lol? He had several chances for slams but instead settled for layups.
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,xc14617,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:01:44 2015 UTC,"Points are points, and dunks (1) take more energy (2) are easier to block."
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,sketchquark,0,Mon Jul 13 12:41:38 2015 UTC,Dunks are not easier to block. Al was hardly getting his shots above rim level. Shots above rim level are harder to block since fewer people can actually block those shots and dunks are more than likely to go in rather than a layup
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,xc14617,0,Mon Jul 13 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"Dunks are harder to block in IM leagues. In the NBA, layups are better because once the ball touches the backboard it is immune to being touched by a defender.  There are some NBA players than can get around this by jumping higher than the other players, but Al is not one of those."
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,sketchquark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:56:45 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but dunks are not easier to block. They have more force behind them and are in the air for less time giving the defender less time to block them. Unless you are playing dodgeball with the blackboard an NBA player is going to send a layup into the 5th row more than he does a dunk.  Source: can dunk and played very competitive highschool ball where dunking isn't anything special.
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,white_Steve_Nash,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:03:00 2015 UTC,"You clearly dont understand physics if you think a dunk is quicker than a layup; just think about the release point. Of course angle and all that matters too. And by the way, in the context of the discussion, this is with regarding to from a standing position beneath the basket, not baseline drives.   Dunking is just easier if you don't have to worry about a person getting between you and the rim. It also looks cooler because you can throw it down strong.   Source: could dunk and could block dunks. I only played for my high school soccer team but neither was the NBA with the fastest shotblockers so I dont think it matters. Is my Masters in physics relevant here?  PS Your name is pretty ironic if you can dunk."
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,sketchquark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:45:13 2015 UTC,"Steve was such a baller his white counterpart can dunk! But as far as release point goes, I'm saying the ball is in the air longer in a layup since you have to finesse it off the glass unless you want the ball to land at half court. If you watched the finals when steph would lay the ball up he didn't try to get the ball to touch the glass asap, he had to hit it off of the very very top to not get blocked. When dunk you can explode upwards and literally put the ball though the hoop in a quick motion. With big Al's size he doesn't even have to jump that high to get up. Furthermore you are far more likely to get fouled going up strong for a dunk than a layup. And even more so, a 4 who can't dunk that isn't named Dirk probably isn't going to be in the NBA so he should do it regardless to show he's athletic enough. I get that you're a grad student in physics but I'm a ME major so I do understand physics btw. Enough to apply to this at least."
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,white_Steve_Nash,2,Tue Jul 14 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"We aren't talking about finesse layups here though. This is a quick bounce off the glass, no English. Big Al has a standing reach of basically 9 feet, so he has to only move the ball a foot before its unblockable without goaltending. He has to move it twice as far as to dunk.  And as big as Big Al is, he is still undersized and will have to outplay down in the low post, not overpower.  I'm not saying you're wrong on your points, but just in this context there are plenty of reasons to do a quick layup over a dunk, and overall it is my opinion that it is the smarter play."
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,sketchquark,2,Tue Jul 14 03:10:44 2015 UTC,I can respect that.
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,white_Steve_Nash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:25:21 2015 UTC,"Just watch tapes on the elite shot blockers of today(DeAndre, Anthony Davis, Ibaka) and see how they accumlate their block totals. Far less do they stuff dunk attempts but instead make a living when guards try them in the paint on various layups. There is only one way to stop a dunk and that is a force meets force block. When blocking a layup there are more options such as pinning it on the backboard or getting the ball before its apex."

UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"Dunking is also a deterrent against potential shot blockers. If Al tosses up a lay up then that's a shotblocker's chance. If Al goes up for the slam the defender is less likely to try to block the shot because he doesnt want to get posterized, get a foul etc."
UCSantaBarbara,3cyeoi,xc14617,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:30:40 2015 UTC,"There is a lot less for an nba player to try to block on a dunk attempt rather than a layup. Dunks are higher percentage shots because you are literally placing the ball in the hoop, getting fouled or less frequently blocked. If Al is facing someone like DeAndre Jordan Al cant be tossing it up from 3 feet away. He has to be able to slam it down or else DJ will have a swat party"

When I took it, they gave us problem sets from like a year or two back which was great. If you can do the problem sets without too much trouble, you can do the tests.   Let me try to remember the pace of the course. Over 6 weeks, we mostly covered all that income/substitution effect type shit, which wasn't too bad. I cant remember a chapter count, but I think I remember spending about 5 solid 8 hour days before each test doing problem sets and shit. I got 88% on both midterms with that work ethic and then i got like 65% on the final - it was just hard lol. Ended with a B+ in the class due to the curve.. which i guess they've changed now?

UCSantaBarbara,3crgwi,ayoooogalileo,19,Fri Jul 10 04:32:31 2015 UTC,"Everyone's pretty much covered it but I'll throw in my $.02:    Regular graveyard shifts run seven days a week (10pm-3am Sun-Wed, 10pm-4am on Thurs-Sat).  Shifts consist of patrolling the interior and exterior buildings of on campus res halls and nearby buildings, general campus, and off campus apartments. There are four ""beats"": east (Chi 5 res halls) and west (San Raf and Manzi), San Clem, and FT with two CSOs assigned to each except FT which has four. These people will make sure everything's good as is no ones passed out, or that the doors to the buildings aren't propped open, etc. There's also two CSOs that ride around on bikes during this time patrolling the exterior campus buildings making sure nothings out of the ordinary; also they handle escorts if there are any. On weekends there's an ""escort shift"" that runs till 6am which is primarily just handling escorts or if not, just doing exterior patrol.    There's two CSOs patrolling the off campus owned apartments from 9pm-130am, until 230am on weekends, doing the same as the on campus people, but they too can field escorts if they start from IV.    The rest of the shifts are during the day which are bike duty (impounding and doing education/enforcement), office (answering phone calls and releasing impounded bikes), and general patrol. I won't go into more detail because as a new CSO you would most likely not work these as the more senior CSOs ask for these on their preference when we assign shifts for the quarter. Also the majority of the shifts are at night.    Lastly, events can be interesting or boring depending on what they are. They can be from concerts to simply watching a tent for a conference on campus. There are events that all CSOs must work which are Halloween, extravaganza, and commencement.    The job is fun and rewarding if you make it that way; it also has its boring, dull times too. I love the times where random (possibly drunk) people in IV will call you out saying that they love CSOs. I'd say your enjoyment will be influenced by your coworkers and their personality because hey it's just gonna be you and your partner for a couple of hours. Expect to work 2 times/10 hours a week. That's pretty much it. Sorry if this seems overwhelming.    Source: am currently a CSO"

Helmets are provided; if there are no new ones then you can borrow one from someone who is not working that night. You must wear a helmet whenever you are biking."
UCSantaBarbara,3crgwi,badumkshh,6,Sat Jul 11 00:09:11 2015 UTC,"I've never been a CSO, but I've heard that many work weird shifts (late at night to early morning). The upside is it's pretty good pay. And no, people don't look down upon them."
UCSantaBarbara,3crgwi,feartrich,6,Fri Jul 10 04:37:43 2015 UTC,"Also, if you do choose to be a CSO, you'll be working with one of the coolest bosses you'll ever have! While your direct supervisors are going to be other senior CSOs (pretty awesome in my opinion..), the coordinator who supervises the entire organization is a full-time police employee and treats it like a big family. Plus, depending on how much you put out, you can wind up making pretty good friends with some of the police officers, which is awesome for ride-alongs and overall career advice if you're hoping to eventually become a LEO.  Overall: awesome job, awesome boss, awesome team."
UCSantaBarbara,3crgwi,sundowntg,2,Fri Jul 10 23:10:19 2015 UTC,You have to give up to UCPD for creating a positive policing environment on campus. It's hard to think that CSOs are basically campus security. They seem more like watchful guardians that you can ask for help when needed.

UCSantaBarbara,3crgwi,catsxmaru,2,Fri Jul 10 14:11:30 2015 UTC,"I know a couple CSOs and they've had to occasionally work graveyards on school nights. Especially thursday nights. I'm assuming that you're an incoming freshman, so I would definitely wait until like midterms or maybe even until after the first quarter is over before you apply to be a CSO just so you can decide if you can handle it."
UCSantaBarbara,3crgwi,Pinatubo,3,Fri Jul 10 06:26:35 2015 UTC,Nah nobody looks down on CSOs. They're not out there trying to bust people or anything like that. They mostly walk people home and call ambulances/IVFP if something dangerous is going on.   From what I can tell a normal shift for them is just riding around IV on their bikes and responding to calls for an escort.   Upside: You get some good stories and I imagine that you become close friends with whoever your patrol buddy is. Pay is pretty good. Their shifts are a lot of cardio too so you'll definitely be able to stay in shape.  Downside: CSO escorts are offered every night of the week which means that somebody has to work the 3am wednesday shift. Eventually that'll be you.

Nice chapter house but it looks like a PF Changs.   ATO - still a ""top house"" but borderline declining. they have a good number of cool guys but they're are a few boners like every other fraternity, which seem to be growing. still have a nice house on the quad though.   Zete - less traditional, surfer frat. don't have the best house but I heard they're making renovations over the summer. just started up last year but have a good rep from SAE. parties can get a little crazy, which may be offsetting to some. smaller fraternity, but the brotherhood seems strong. they rarely wear shoes but the girls never seem to care. Upper-mid.   ZBT - used to be considered ""bottom"" house before they picked up a bunch of ex-Phi Sig and Beta pledges. brotherhood may not be the strongest but they party and girls love them. also since Beta originally ""commandeered"" them, they got Beta's old house which is also one of the four on the quad. Total change from two years ago. Upper-mid.   Sig Pi - a quarter cool guys, half good hearted guys that girls seem to like and, half boners. still throw good parties and have a nice house on the quad. Middle.  Sig Nu - filled with some cool guys but mainly boners and CC kids. but hey they got a nice house on the quad so that's nice. Middle  AEPi - rich, Jewish. may not have the nicest partying house but I believe it is the biggest property in IV since they own the apartment complex next door too  Middle.   DTD - few cool guys, rest boners. got a decent house on pardall. Lower-middle  Kappa Sigma - just got on campus late last year. filled with goobers and are irrelevant on campus. i feel they could improve if they get more involved on campus and participate in more philanthropies. and no more boners.

They give out a lot of bids, but be warned, they do it cuz a lot of people drop for... well you can figure it out.   AEPi - Jewish frat with lots of rich guys. Bottom mid.   ZBT - Bottom mid. It's hard to describe who they are since they took pledges from two of the houses that got kicked off so they may not have the best brotherhood. They seem to be mainly concerned with getting girls and raging.   Zete - Bottom mid. Chill dudes who don't give af about anything except girls, raging and surfing. Girls love them.   DTD - Bottom. Chill dudes who don't give af about their rank. They have pretty good quarterlies.   KSig - Bottom. They're kinda geeky, but that doesn't mean they don't TU.

UCSantaBarbara,3cp0tf,viva_la_evolution,6,Thu Jul 9 16:53:55 2015 UTC,"Ralph's is the cheapest in my opinion. It's a tad bit farther from campus, like 3 miles away down Hollister. Trader Joes is a bit more expensive, so I don't really ship there. The Albertsons by Costco is really expensive IMO so I stay away from it. Santa Cruz Market on Hollister is where I go for my meats and ethnic foods, good quality meats but some of the other goods are expensive."
UCSantaBarbara,3cp0tf,EyeballsMcgee,4,Thu Jul 9 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"Costco is amazing.  It's like $10 for 5 dozen eggs - I go through those rather quickly.  Same with the milk.   You can get frozen meats there (frozen chicken breast, beef, etc) for really cheap as well. I think it's like $12? for 12 or so breasts. It's ridiculous really. It's not the greatest but the quality isn't bad or even ""mediocre"" - it's quite good for what it is. I'm an undergrad so I have limited funds but it's definitely been worth the amount I've paid at Costco compared to other places such as Albertsons and IV Market (since I don't have a car - I have to get some friend to drive me up to costco once a month or so)."
UCSantaBarbara,3cp0tf,piggychuu,3,Thu Jul 9 18:19:15 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on getting in to grad school and welcome to UCSB.  I know you asked about grocery but beer is grocery right? Costco prices are probably the best you'll find on adult beverages. Supermarkets seem to really overprice their beer here. BevMo (in the same marketplace as Costco) has a great selection but their prices are very variable. Just FYI in California you don't need membership to buy alcohol at Costco  On the West Coast at least the same brewer makes both the Costco own brand beer (Kirkland) and also the Trader Joes own brand beers - its Gordon Biersch even though the Kirkland labels say something else. I prefer the Ales (and the prices) at Costco but TJ's has a better selection of lighter beers.  Costco is a much easier cycle ride from San Clemente. Cycling can help you avoid the impulse purchases....  If your budget is really tight then network with other grad students when you get here (ie at the Grad Student Association Bagel and Coffee hour (free food!)). I know some grad students that relish the art of the dumpster dive and know when and where to hit local bakeries. You can also get a lot of free food on campus if you learn all the free coffee hours and seminars with snacks and food.  Sadly the farmers markets here are not cheap (although there is one on Sundays and Thursdays at the Camino Real Marketplace - same place as Costco) but you can probably score all the fruit you need off people with fruit trees in their yards. Again, network with grad students, faculty and staff. When I have a surplus I often bring it in for the staff in one of the Departments I work in who have expressed an interest in the past who I know don't have yards of their own to grow food in."
UCSantaBarbara,3cp0tf,ccsfaculty,3,Fri Jul 10 06:17:12 2015 UTC,"It depends what you mean by near campus.  Theres a trader joes, which I am a huge fan of,  within 5 miles of campus.  Its great for basic stuff.  Milk is 3$ a gal, cheapest dozen eggs are like 2$.  I think its cheaper than albertsons, which is right next to costco, and it is a much better deal if you factor in quality/health.  I also like to buy in bulk, and I think costco is a good idea.  If you have friends you can split the costs of the membership.  Also, make sure you go for the executive membership because even if you dont earn enough cashback to cover the cost difference (like 40$?), theyll let you cancel it and refund you the difference (40$-cashback earned), and then you can sign up again.    I usually buy my meats bulk from costco and freeze them, frozen berries, their chips & salsa, and then my produce from TJs as well as dressings and stuff.   As a PhD student I assume you wont be living in Isla Vista itself, but theres the food co op and IV market."

Campus apartment rules are, I think, you can have a guest stay for 3 days at a time. If you really want to live with your SO you could start looking for a place in IV that isn't university owned.

UCSantaBarbara,3cpego,crazwomanyo,7,Thu Jul 9 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"A 4/5 person is likely to be Santa Ynez. You do also have RAs in the apartments, not exactly as strict as the dorms but they do check up every now and then. The apartments are also single sex, just some things to think about. If it were me and one of my housemates told me we'd be living with an extra person on the first day I'd probably say no. as I said before, 6 people is way too much for that apartment. Also, the beds are twins, pretty hard to sleep with two people on them, I've tried."

If you look at the major sheet, there are different areas you can focus on. http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/Sociology-BA_2013.pdf We have a strong faculty who really are masters in their field and integrate current events into their courses. Because there is more room and opportunity to make the major your own, you are not limited to the major. You're not limited to basic knowledge of globalization etc, but rather you can really focus on what you want to learn. You can tailor the degree to what you want, allowing you to go pretty much go into any job field you want.   Source: Sociology major"

UCSantaBarbara,3cjetp,LoneLion,6,Thu Jul 9 19:23:03 2015 UTC,"Greek life at UCSB is kind of a joke.  A relatively small proportion of the student body is involved, and unlike most schools where even those that don't join know about them and rely on them for parties, people at UCSB just party on DP and mostly either ignore or laugh about the frats.   Sorry to any Greek folks in the thread. I know you're having fun, I'm just letting OP know the general attitude."
UCSantaBarbara,3cjetp,GreatBallsOfFIRE,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:18:05 2015 UTC,Lol yeah especially because the frats don't let any guys in that aren't in the frat (you can know someone yada yada) so really they only people outside of frats that know about them are females.
UCSantaBarbara,3cjetp,white_Steve_Nash,2,Mon Jul 13 22:26:20 2015 UTC,"Coming from a guy involved in Greek life here, definitely come out if you'd like! I wouldn't say it's impossible or even hard to join at all. I'd say I speak on behalf of almost all my brothers that we'd love to have an international student come out and join if he was interested. If you were to rush and eventually pledge, you'd be activated after one quarter (fall) and you could have a full quarter of being an active and one of pledging.   The only way I can see if it wouldn't work out is if you werent full committed to being a part of it. It might be shitty knowing that you'd be leaving after two quarters but brotherhood lasts forever, and if you were to ever come back you'd always have a home/ place to feel welcomed.   I'm a part of a well established IFC fraternity so if you'd like you can message me for more details."

UCSantaBarbara,3cg99r,ittookawhile,4,Tue Jul 7 17:57:11 2015 UTC,It depends on how you did on AP Calc. Explained here: http://www.math.ucsb.edu/ugrad/placement.php  Then go here to see suggested plans of study: http://www.math.ucsb.edu/ugrad/courses.php
UCSantaBarbara,3cg99r,Louel512,4,Tue Jul 7 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"Go talk to the Undergraduate Adviser in the Math department.  If you aren't here yet, call them on the phone."
UCSantaBarbara,3cg99r,fengshui,4,Tue Jul 7 23:45:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a mathematical sciences junior for context... Our professors are all really smart people. And hired mostly based off of their researching abilities NOT their teaching abilities (I assume from my experiences, because some of them have a very limited grasp of English.)   I have had 2 math professors who didn't understand enough English enough to understand simple questions. They taught from handwritten notes that they just copied onto the board and read aloud. When asked a question they would just look puzzled for a second then reread the last paragraph or 2... I understand that these professors are really Good researchers, I just wish that they were all at least semi-competent teachers.  I hope that this is just the 2 math professors and the one black studies professor I've had that are horrible incompetent teachers.  All of the other professors I've had we're either pretty Good or amazing professors. And a lot of the time the TAs are just as Good if not better teachers.  Math is also one of the few majors the university doesn't actively try to make students quit by making the under division classes excessively  hard and competitive. (The professors are required to fail a set percentage of the classes) and we have a really low required GPA comparatively.   If this if poorly written it's because I am not an English major, and mathematicians are lazy. The way I see it, math is all about figuring out rules and shortcuts once, so that you don't have to do as much work the next time."
UCSantaBarbara,3cg99r,killerblonde42,3,Tue Jul 7 18:32:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to call ucsb math professors incompetent. Everyone has their own method of teaching. And their own personalities.   That would be my advice to op: you have to learn to adjust to different expectations and teaching methods.  Although it's not necessary,  I suggest using visiting hours as much as possible.  try to find out what type of work the professor expects. It's good to build relationships early on,  specially if you're interested in letters of recommendation in the future.   Also,  don't rush through things. Math can be a difficult subject if you miss the subtleties.  It's not enough to remember a proof to be good at math.  A good foundation in logic will help you see the overall picture."

If you get offered the job take a realistic look at the salary and the rental prices around here. If you are at that point in life where you want your own place make sure you'll be able to afford it. I think the North Campus Faculty Housing is, or is going to be, open for staff as well so if this is of interest you should inquire at the time of interview/offer to get on the list.  There's not much to hate about Santa Barbara. Once you've lived here a few years though you can start to hate on all the new developments, growth, housing, traffic etc. In fact I think once you've been here more than ten years you HAVE to start hating on all the development and how things aren't what they used to be.

Unless it is a senior position then there is unlikely to be a budget to pay to bring people in for interview. So most of the entry level-ish positions tend to recruit from a local pool - not just within the US but local to the region.   I think the University would expect overseas applicants to be eligible for employment - via citizenship, green card or visa when they applied. In fact I think there's a question on the application about that isn't there? I can only see them doing the H-1B visa for specialized positions where demand has outstripped local supply. I could be wrong - I have had no experience with the H-1B visa personally but I can tell you all about the J-1 or the K-1 (shudders at the memory...)."

I lived at a brand new Wolfe house on dp last year and they provided us with locks with our bedroom door.  They also aren't allowed inside your house unless it's 24 hour notice
UCSantaBarbara,3cd6h7,chronicpenguins,3,Tue Jul 7 01:03:08 2015 UTC,"That was what I was thinking. One of the thoughts that I had was that there usually is a lot of medical attention needed on this street. If the person they needed to help was trapped in a room with the door locked, and they needed to get it opened, they would have to do extra work. This extra work could possibly damage the house and make it harder to get inside. This could potentially endanger the person inside and could hold them being liable for any damages.    However, this is stupid also because it can lead to your stuff being more accessible to people and taken very easily."
UCSantaBarbara,3cd6h7,chronicpenguins,2,Tue Jul 7 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not buying it.    The front door could be locked, so do we not lock front doors?

I discovered that the nitty gritty MCDB stuff wasn't for me and that I excel in the EEMB field where things are studied in a larger conceptual frame work.   Ultimately it doesn't matter if you choose MCDB or EEMB if your goal is medical school...just keep the GPA up.   The easy EEMB courses:  EEMB 142A (Aquatic communities); half the course is taught be Even  EEMB 148 (Stream ecology); taught entirely by Even  Although I don't intend on pursuing anything marine/fresh water related, those courses were pretty neat and Even is definitely my favorite science professor I've had in my 4 years at UCSB. They aren't too tough either--but that doesn't mean you get to slack. You earn your A, but it's easier compared to MCDB courses.  Other recommended courses:  EEMB 108 (Vertebrate Evolutionary Morphology) EEMB 131 (Principles of Evolution)  Both of those courses were taught by Sweet. He's getting old though so I'm not sure how much longer he's teaching for but those are great classes.

UCSantaBarbara,3c8ng3,FrickenHamster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:40:18 2015 UTC,"I'd say 3 max, but 2 ideally.   And yes, some have a much higher work load than others. This is what I experienced:  Low amount of work: 170 (this one depends on the professor), 178  Medium amount of work: 111, 154, 162  High amount of work: 130a, 130b, 138, 160  But it also really depends on the professor you take it with, so your mileage may vary. Definitely consider who will be teaching the class each quarter. Feel free to PM me to ask questions about specific professors.   If you're thinking about electives, consider Math 108A and PSTAT 130. I found them both very easy, and most agree that PSTAT 130 is easy for CS majors, as it's basically a ""learn how to program using this language"" class for stats majors. Graph theory (Math 137) is also super interesting, but what is interesting for me might be different for you. What areas of CS do you find interesting?"

UCSantaBarbara,3c8ng3,numijokijikomun,3,Sun Jul 5 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"170 was the most time consuming class I've ever taken. Depending on yourself 162 can be a breeze or terrible. It's 7 projects for your entire grade. No tests or anything. For me, 177, 140, 111 were about no work. 176a was very time consuming and boring. 160 is very time consuming but interesting. 178 and the rest that are required were just average."
UCSantaBarbara,3c8ng3,Fluffaykitties,2,Mon Jul 6 01:56:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, I believe the usual consensus is that 170 is a lot of work, which is why I put a disclaimer next to my 170 categorization.  My 170 course was strange. I barely learned anything from lectures/homework and the projects were ridiculously easy. Then, BAM, the final was extremely difficult. The average on it IIRC was around 15/40, with a high score of 25/40 or so. It was a very strange class."
UCSantaBarbara,3c8ng3,Fluffaykitties,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:59:10 2015 UTC,"No problem! Yeah. I suppose that's the hard part of picking electives!  For me it was pretty easy to pick my electives. I did a double major in math so naturally I was inclined to pick the more ""math-y"" and algorithms-based elective CS courses.  I think when you're starting to think about electives most students have a few ideas as to what they may be interested in. I think the ideal way to go about it would be to try out some electives you think seem cool, and hope for the best. If you absolutely hate it, you could always drop and take another one either that same quarter or that next quarter, depending on how tight your scheduling is. If you're concerned about how easy the courses would be, you'll also definitely want to pay attention to who seems to teach which electives."

UCSantaBarbara,3c4hkz,beetling,-23,Sat Jul 4 18:19:39 2015 UTC,The last thing the IV foot patrol needs is more funding. What a massive waste of money having so many cops in IV. all we have now is innocent students getting MIPs and having their parties crashed.
UCSantaBarbara,3c4hkz,thejackajill,29,Sat Jul 4 19:42:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, so you're new here.  I'll start first by saying that I'm glad your freshman year went off well and without a hitch. I hope your honors program thing goes well.  Let's see. My freshman year.....I was lucky enough to go through  A) The death of a close friend + other UCSB students involved in a massacre that made international news  B) A riot with full blown riot squads that also made international news  C) Gang rape, the two guys of which I don't know if they were ever caught (howdy fuckin ho, I happened to look like one of the pictures. Got some meaaaaan dirty looks from a lot of people)  D) Some guy running around IV with a machete  E) Bacterial meng. which is not really something police related, although there was that guy with drug resistant TB running around Goleta.   F) ????  In the past year alone, there were way more home invasions / muggings than I remember from my freshman year (although many of those seem to have been connected). Additionally, there were some reported shootings and whatnot, but were additionally for other reasons.  So yes, IV only consists of innocent students looking to get drunk.  /s"
UCSantaBarbara,3c4hkz,piggychuu,15,Sat Jul 4 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"If you were here in 2013-2014, you would know that poor communication with IVFP has been a major problem in IV, and was part of what caused the 2014 Deltopia riots. I'm sorry if you've had a bad experience with IVFP, but its not like we can just gut it and hope everything gets better on its own."

UCSantaBarbara,3c4hkz,Redfdofjk,-15,Sat Jul 4 20:43:43 2015 UTC,You know why there were more robberies this year than last? Because throwing more cops at the problem doesn't help. Having cops walk in groups of five does not do anything to promote safety. All it does is make it so there are bored cops with nothing better to do than crash parties and give MIPs. I bet they could fire half the cops and the crime rate wouldn't increase

Police use of excessive force and over-militarization is a very real and extremely detrimental problem across the nation, and Isla Vista is no exception. If you need an example, how about the two IV cops who physically tackled my friend to the ground and threw him in the drunk tank because he stumbled, didn't fall over, just stumbled. He wasn't loud-mouthing, wasn't causing trouble, we were just taking him home and he was drunk and tripped and almost fell. It's no wonder the student population sees the foot patrol as their enemy. The word ""gestapo"" comes to mind."

Granted, some officers make mistakes - they are humans too. They are members of our community. Over militarization, excessive force, gestapo...It's really hard to take you seriously on your friend story when you're obviously over emphasizing everything else.   ""Geographically speaking, Isla Vista is small, yet it accounts for 25 percent of reported crimes in unincorporated areas of the county.   Plastino saw a slight reprieve earlier this month when the county Board of Supervisors approved funding for the department’s first-ever Isla Vista community resource deputy.  The move is unprecedented, since the county has never foot the bill for this post in unincorporated areas. It’s all the more special because Isla Vista residents lobbied for the change.""   I'd rather have more than enough cops than not enough when they are really needed.   Edit: Also, it's not about age. It's about experience. You're talking shit on the cops here and you haven't even been here that long. You've probably spent more time on the shitter than the amount of time you've spent seeing our cops."

They mostly give you more units that allow you to register for classes earlier. Physics 1-5 are mainly engineering, B.S. Chemistry students, and B.A. physics students while the Physics 20 series are mainly for the B.S. physics and CCS students. The 20 series thus is more theoretical while the 1-5 series are more practical.

ED118/math 94 is an easy A. I didn't take them but they're supposedly really easy. I think your first quarter is fine, even though it's usually recommended to start off with 12 units. There is definitely a jump from community college to university, lower division math to upper division, and semester system to quarter system, so be prepared. 120a is easyish, 108a can be difficult but it's not insane, haven't taken 137a but heard it's interesting.  In my opinion, your schedule looks too intense, but you may be different than me. Start off with your first quarter and go from there before deciding if you want to add a minor. I changed my major my first quarter from math/econ to fms. If you want to go to grad school for stats, you'll definitely need the 160 series, but I believe those can be used as misc electives part of your math degree."

More info on family housing can be found here: http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/family-students/general-information   There are two family housing ""campuses"" -- West Campus and Storke. West Campus (WC) apartments are somewhat old (built in 70s or even earlier), but overall quite OK and inexpensive ($1000 +/- ~$100, utilities included, depending on whether you have a 1 or 2 bedroom apt). Your application to West Campus may wait in the queue for 6-18 months (especially, if you target a 2-br apartment -- these are hard to get, unless you have kids). Storke is newer (and, presumably, nicer), the rent there is ~$200-400 higher than at West Campus. From what I know, it is much easier to get an apartment there (as most people try to get an apt at WC). Also, make sure you are eligible for Family Housing (if you are officially married, it is not going to be a problem; if you are in an informal relationship, it will).  P.S. There is a UCSB's construction project right next to WC, which will be finished in about a year from now, so it may be quite noise there (which very much depends on the exact location of the apartment). So, make sure that you actually visit the place some time between 9am and 11am Mon-Fri to check the level of noise before agreeing to rent there."

Don't jump right into it unless you're confident in your cs skills coming in.   I always recommend students to take cs8 if they're not sure if they should or not. Plus, Python is a good scripting language to know.   Worst case: cs 8 ends up as somewhat of a review for you so you build a better foundation and maybe boost up your GPA.

I think you'll have a great time, especially since it sounds like one of your main priorities is to expand your horizons.   I hope ucsb is diverse enough not only in race but the type of people.   Maybe not the most diverse place in the world, but you will be able to find people of all makes and models if you look.   I have little experience with females so I'm worried about that as well, especially since ucsb has so many attractive girls who are probably used to being approached so much.   Step one will be to avoid using the word ""females"" to describe girls.    I want to balance schoolwork with a social life, so where would be a good street to live on in IV?    I'd recommend Pasado or Trigo.   Also should I work out at the rec center or would it better to sign up for a gym somewhere in SB?   The Rec Cen is awesome."

UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,Z-Ninja,10,Fri Jul 3 03:24:44 2015 UTC,"Wassup man.  I literally just made this account to respond to this. The only real answer is the most cliche phrase you've probably heard a millions times before. ""PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE"".  I was a transfer as well. At first I knew just a couple people and never really tried meeting anyone new. At first it was alright, but over time I realized that I wanted more out of my time in college. The bottom line is, it really doesn't matter where you live in IV, a great college experience won't just walk into your apartment. You have to take the initiative to step outside and see what UCSB has to offer. I'm not going to self-diagnose myself, but I too sometimes have trouble in new situations and meeting new people. It took me a while to get over it but trust me, it was the best thing I did at UCSB. Much more so than any academic accomplishment. I know it's hard to go places by yourself sometimes, but when you first get to UCSB, go to as many club/sports meetings as possible. Most aren't as serious as they try to present themselves and they are all full of students who also want to have fun and meet people. For a gym, the Rec Cen isn't perfect but it is solid. It is also a good place to bring a new friend. 90% of guys here would be down to go to the gym haha. UCSB has 20,000 people, I am 100% percent sure that you can find a solid group of amazing people IF YOU PUT THE EFFORT INTO IT.  Good luck"
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,sunturtll,9,Thu Jul 2 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"Work hard, exercise regularly, be friendly to everyone you meet. Continue to do this after you graduate. You'll be fine, it's really that simple. Also helps if you don't refer to women as females."
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,Applegiraffe,4,Thu Jul 2 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"You are over thinking it man. This school provides a great experience for pretty much anyone. There is a huge social scene that you can participate in and make friends, but it's only there if you go to it. If you're really set on staying in to recharge for a night that's just as easy. You're gonna have a great time here, don't beat yourself up anticipating what it's gonna be like."
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,capnbossman,3,Thu Jul 2 21:15:08 2015 UTC,"Join a club that interests you and talk to people there. Also, don't worry about all the details so much you'll figure it out"
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,iambutters,2,Thu Jul 2 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"In terms of being Asian don't even worry about if you want to hang with other Asians there are plenty of cultural clubs and activities, but no one really cares about your race."
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,chexican111,2,Thu Jul 2 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"Hey man I respect that, not a lot of people are willing put themselves out there. And you did just that. And that was pretty big decision, I'm sure it will work out. If you come here with the attitude you have now, you'll have a great time. Honestly, join a club, sports team, whatever. Get involved with something you're passionate in and you won't regret your decision"
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,greenzebra3,2,Fri Jul 3 05:38:39 2015 UTC,"You can find whatever it is you are looking for. Ucsb is large enough that you can socialize with very diverse groups of students. There are plenty of south and East Asian student organizations, so that might be the easiest way to meet people right off the bat, but the best advice I can give you is that you have to reach out to make the first connection in pretty much every situation. It's large enough that if you don't do anything or talk to anyone, people will leave you alone, so don't expect people to walk up to you and attempt to befriend you because you live there. That being said, everyone is super friendly and if you make even a little effort to meet people, you will be greatly rewarded, but the onus is on you. :).   Good luck!"
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,hybridmoments04,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:31:26 2015 UTC,"A large part of the social life at UCSB revolves around drinking and partying. However, that does not need to be the case. There are plenty of clubs and organizations which are social without those aspects. You can choose to balance it however you want. But at the end of the day, you have to make an effort. Get out there and make connections and you will be fine."
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,chrispbacon88,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"First off,  welcome to the family,  new gaucho! I see a lot of parallels  between your mindset  and mine when I first decided to come here. Ucsb is a wonderful place where you can really discover yourself and meet tons of great people. Ultimately it is what you make of it, so you have to start out with the mind set of escaping your social anxiety.  It seems like you've already started on this path just by recognizing it. My best advice to help you with this is to just talk to everyone you see,  be friendly and realize that no one is out to get you, and tiny friendly advances are all it takes to make a new friend.  One great way to meet people is to join clubs.  Join everything that you're interested in, and then join things that you know nothing about, you could end up loving them. I highly recommend  the Excursion Club and I can tell you all about it and why I think it's so great if you would like.   As for housing, I didn't know who to live with my sophomore  year after leaving the dorms and ended up living with guys I found on Craigslist.  They're now my best friends.    There's plenty of room for socializing, but there's also a strong academic drive,  and you can find like minded people all around you.  Overall, push yourself out of your comfort zone and try new things, even if you have to go it alone at first,  because that's how you'll end up loving this place.  I'm happy to answer any questions you have, reply or message me and I'll get back to you later. Olé!"
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,Stoic_stone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:15:16 2015 UTC,"My first time i went into IV I was really nervous too. I was a freshman and my roommate and I walked to his friend's party in the middle of IV. I felt like such an outsider at the time and even the passing IVFP vehicals made me feel skitish.   At the party I played beer pong, which was fun, and akwardly attempted conversation with random folks. I felt better with every sip of beer and leaving the party, I felt much more relaxed.   Six years later I look back on my time spent in IV with extreme fondness and consider it to be among the best times of my life.   You'll be fine. Drink and be merry. Watch the sun set over the ocean as often as you can. Bring a bike."
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,tjrhodes,2,Thu Jul 2 23:08:07 2015 UTC,Not much of a drinker I would hate to rely on alcohol to be social
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,Redfdofjk,3,Fri Jul 3 00:33:04 2015 UTC,I find that it's less nerve racking to socialize with a random drunk person when I'm sober
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,tjrhodes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:19:23 2015 UTC,"Have you tried it? While I certainly do not advocate binge drinking, there are social benefits to drinking moderate amounts of alcohol. Studies have shown that the social benefits of drinking increases life span expectancy. Here's the article. Anyway, what's your favorite way to be social?"
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,bomerr,2,Fri Jul 3 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"Usually like some type of activity. I like to smoke weed socially, meaning other people smoking weed as well. Being high doesn't work around sober/drunk people, only other high ones"
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,fmsmajor,0,Sat Jul 4 00:58:46 2015 UTC,you change ur actions first and your personality follows. in other words you should do things you don't do before. Won't lie alc. and weed can really help your personality grow.
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,Redfdofjk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:25:32 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine man. People here are generally super friendly. I was worried about similar things you're currently stressing over, and everything turned out fine.  Just so you know, IVPartyScene and the big events like Deltopia/Halloween aren't an accurate depiction of the time you'll have here (unless you want it to be, you do have a choice). I'm socially anxious myself and pretty introverted and I'm still happy I chose UCSB. I transferred at 22 years old last year as well. You don't even have to party in IV or even party at all. Most people of age I know go downtown anyway.   It's pretty easy to have a good social/school/work balance. If it's not too late, maybe you can apply for the UCSB owned transfer apartments. I lived in San Clemente last year, which is pretty quiet and separated from IV, but I enjoyed the solitude when needed.  Unfortunately, UCSB isn't that diverse. You will find people here you relate to though, you're far from alone. Like others have suggested, join clubs and put yourself out there. You will learn to be comfortable yourself if you try.  The reccen is nice enough (I mean it comes with your tuition). I go to 24 hour since I like to work out at weird times and like a less crowded gym. Spectrum is nice too but have heard it's a bit pricey."
UCSantaBarbara,3bwro6,MeanMrMustardMan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:49:28 2015 UTC,"Dude, don't worry. I came to UCSB as a very shy person (literally 0 friends in high school), and it helped me open up. You don't have to go to parties, and you don't have to drink, if you don't want to. But you can if you want. If you want to not be too deep in IV, you can look at getting a campus apartment.  The party culture is greatly exaggerated by the outside world. Sure, we party, but we aren't monsters about it.  The campus' gym is nice.  Don't worry about not fitting in because you are Asian."
UCSantaBarbara,3bxy1o,frogman1096,4,Fri Jul 3 02:00:36 2015 UTC,"I lived in FT (Santa Catalina). I was just getting into surfing at the time so I didn't have my own board, I generally used Excursion's surfboards. BUT plenty of my friends kept their boards in their room. One even drilled a little into the ceiling to hang their boards with two pieces of rope.   The bathrooms in Santa Catalina are suite style, meaning you shared a bathroom with 3-5 other people and just them. I left my wetsuit on the towel rack with a gross towel underneath on the floor to catch the water.  There was an outdoor shower to rinse if I wanted, but I generally just took off my wetsuit in the shower. There is probably an outdoor shower near the other dorms in the Chi-5 area.   Feel free to ask any other questions you might have! I just graduated and really got into surfing during my time here."
UCSantaBarbara,3bxy1o,phichelle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:45:14 2015 UTC,What's the best type of board for the most common waves?
UCSantaBarbara,3bxy1o,wafflington,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"If you're just starting to surf and haven't yet, soft tops are the way to go. After surfing for a while, I got my own legit board, it's an 8' board. It's smaller than the big longboards but is much easier to ride than any shortboard. And from what I hear, UCSB doesn't have the biggest waves so shortboards are iffy at best there."
UCSantaBarbara,3bxy1o,wafflington,2,Fri Jul 3 03:02:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a very experienced surfer. I have a large array of short boards but Ivan only bring one. So, I want to make sure I bring the best one for the conditions"
UCSantaBarbara,3bxy1o,phichelle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:56:34 2015 UTC,"Oh! I misinterpreted your question. Yeah, I live in the area, but not in SB. There are great surf spots not 30 minutes from campus, but I couldn't tell you much about the surf spots on campus."
UCSantaBarbara,3bxy1o,ckuiper,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:13:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely can't go wrong with a foamie from costco. Lots of float and great for the mellow waves we have around here. Short boards are definitely doable at Sands, but unless you are already surfing on shortboards, its not ideal to start there.   My first board was a Stewart 7'4"" fun shape. It has enough volume to get me into whatever waves Santa Barbara is producing. I now prefer my custom 8' single fin just because I like what I can do with it.   Essentially, unless you're already comfortable surfing, get a foam board."

UCSantaBarbara,3bwhnd,porter_robertson,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:59:38 2015 UTC,gotcha but is there any advantage to having the gaucho health insurance other than the fact that your parents can't see you buying birth control/paying for std tests...like why is it automatically included in our tuition cost (automatically included as in you have to opt-out to not be charged for it).
UCSantaBarbara,3bwhnd,Shayreelz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:43:21 2015 UTC,Because with gaucho insurance you can get all of your medical stuff done locally I guess
UCSantaBarbara,3bwhnd,fghky,2,Sat Jul 4 02:15:57 2015 UTC,For as long as I've known it's been ~$2500 for the year or a little over $800 a quarter.

UCSantaBarbara,3bwhnd,utchemfan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:33:14 2015 UTC,"No. If you want to waive your health insurance, you have to have proof of an alternate plan. And besides, all US citizens are required to be covered by healthcare now or else face IRS fines (unless you/your parents are able to claim a healthcare unaffordability exemption, which is unlikely)"

Forget the trivial meeting and learning campus, you're missing a sizeable chunk of the course that will be tested upon. It sounds like you're in for a horrible game of catch up. Depending on the amount of units you're taking that might impact your g.p.a adversely. I would hate for that to undermine your self confidence in an emotionally challenging year anyways. If you decide to enroll in classes anyways please talk to your prof and do all the reading."

I've never taken the bus there, but it's probably a less than $10 uber ride, even less if you do uber carpool. If you end up going to the SB one definitely make sure you get off at the right stop, because the most common downtown one (the Transit Station) is at least a 20 minute walk from the station."
UCSantaBarbara,3bq996,OFFENSIVESHIT_,5,Wed Jul 1 07:37:12 2015 UTC,"The Goleta one is the closest to the school and is pretty easy to get to.

UCSantaBarbara,3bli2a,augustus_waters,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:05:42 2015 UTC,Take it first quarter so the info is fresh in your mind.
UCSantaBarbara,3bli2a,neukenindakeuken,7,Thu Jul 2 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I just graduated this past spring with a B.S. in Biopsych. So unfortunately the way ucsb works for class registration kind of sucks for Biopsych majors. Although general chem and ochem and the like are requirements for the major you will not be able to sign up during your first pass time unless you get cleared. While I was in school this required me emailing the advisors as soon as my first pass times started saying which course and course time I wanted to be cleared for so I could sign up. Unfortunately I don't think you can do that your first quarter so I would highly suggest signing up for the PSY 3 course (which is pretty boring I thought but don't let it discourage you from the major, the upper division courses are pretty awesome) as well as some GE's for your first pass time. Things may have changed for signing up for chem classes since I was a freshman so be sure to talk to your orientation leader because they should be able to help you with that. If not, don't fret you can always try and sign up during your second pass time and just drop one of the other courses you originally signed up for. Feel free to shoot me a pm if you want any additional information on easy GE's to take or anything related to the Biopsych major.   Hope you enjoy Ucsb, I know I did. I would have stayed their five years if they let me. Go gauchos!"

Daryl Cooper is the main teacher for that series- some people hate him, others love him. Personally I loved that class and thought it was an easy A because even though I'm terrible with math, attending every class + doing the daily homework got you a lot of credit, and he posts 3 variations (to the tee) of every test for you to practice. They're literally the test, but with a few numbers changed.    Welcome to the Gaucho family!"

Even some shitty looking bikes can get high valuations, and stealing high price bikes is grand theft, which is a felony.   A teacher I know used to collect abandoned bikes and restore them, like you do. Well, it turns out that one of the bikes he took was no-so-abandoned, and the owner hired a PI who nabbed him. He got convicted of grand theft and larceny, and because of this, he didn't get into grad school and it was almost impossible for him to find a job.  So you could probably get away with it (esp the ones w/o tires lol), but there is a risk."

It'll take a while after completing the course for it to show up on your transcript.  The host campus will have to send a transcript to UCSB and then UCSB will have to perform its usual process for evaluating and data entering incoming transcripts.

I graduated with Financial Math and can tell you that it is one of the hardest majors in the school, but very rewarding on your resume. Because you're split evenly between math and stats, you have to take arguably the most difficult series from each (math 124a/b and stats 160a/b). Depending on what you want to go into, this is a more marketable major than statistical science.  Either way though, don't skimp on your programming requirements. When you graduate you should know Python, Matlab, SAS and R (and SQL above all if they offer it now). Those languages are going to be more helpful than your degree.  EDIT: You may also consider actuarial science because it's pretty interesting, pays well, they offer a 5 Yr masters program and the career path is fairly straightforward once you past the actuarial exams."

The majority of the mathematic finance classes are apart of the stats department.   Just compare the syllabus and see what you want to learn.  The math portion of Econ math is all proof courses, dunno about the math classes in financial math.    I'd choose stats over financial math & stats.  I didn't choose fms because there wasn't a lot of focus on Econ.    You could double in Econ/math & stats like me.  I think fms and stats are too similar to double.  120a is a requirement for both majors, but 120a isn't considered a UD class for Econ/math, so I'm basically allowed 12 overlapping units versus 8.    I think I've essentially tripled major, I'd have to take 172a/b to completely fulfill actuarial science."

UCSantaBarbara,3bbgi3,chronicpenguins,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:08:26 2015 UTC,"Well I was both Econ/math and stats, so I couldn't tell you if I was blocked.  I believe 10a is a prereq for 101, and 100b  And 140a are pre reqs for 134a.  People in the Econ major will complain and say 10a is hard, but if you're confident in stats or fms major it should be easy for it.  100b is similar to 10a but some say it is easier (I actually got a b+ in 100b and an a in 10a).  The Econ department will take pstat 126 instead of Econ 140b, so I'm sure they'll let you sub 126 for 140a.  I tried to crash 134a last summer while taking pstat 171.  Hartman wouldn't let me, and he said they were similar classes.  I think 171 is more mathematical and 134a isn't.  I refuse to take a class with Hartman again.  I would send an email to the major advisor for the class you want to take and get a response from them.    Here are the relevant classes I've taken, technically I have finished by BS in stats. PSTAT: 120abc, 122, 126, 130,131,160ab,170,171,174 Econ: 10a, 100b, 140a, 171, 175?(negotiations). Math 108a.  I really wanted to take pstat 171 when I first transferred here.

UCSantaBarbara,3b5p2l,crenshaw213,2,Fri Jun 26 08:09:44 2015 UTC,He put up similar stats against good teams. I think he could be a Jordan Hill like player who would best be used as an off the bench boost for rebounds.
UCSantaBarbara,3b5p2l,tleilaxan,7,Fri Jun 26 13:17:33 2015 UTC,"Don't compare him to Jordan Hill lol he's light years ahead of Williams. Players his build never succeed or even more likely, fail to make it to the league."
UCSantaBarbara,3b5p2l,crenshaw213,2,Fri Jun 26 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"Rebounding translates. He could be a 10-15 minute bench big if he got in great shape and developed a respectable 17-foot shot. He's got long-ass arms (7'2"" wingspan), a big ass, and great instincts."
UCSantaBarbara,3b5p2l,ceelogreen5,2,Sat Jun 27 04:50:50 2015 UTC,"I really want him to get picked up but unfortunately I just don't see it. Every time I watched him play this year he underwhelmed and didn't dominate like NBA players should. He is also super, super undersized to play the 5 at the NBA level. He would either need to gain even more weight/muscle or loose a lot of weight and do nothing but work on his jumper. You never know though, I want to see a fellow gaucho achieve his dream!"

UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,omgitsjimmy,7,Fri Jun 26 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"I always say that someday I will donate. . . .that day has not yet come, but telling myself that I will makes me feel better about myself."

Say what you will about tuition going up, difficulty in getting classes, etc. We still got to go to an amazing school, and looking back the growth and maturity I experienced there will impact me for the rest of my life.  I'd love to be successful enough to give back, in the hopes future students can have that same experience. My two cents at least."
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,CockTipAmputee,20,Fri Jun 26 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"They raised the price of tuition continually while I was there, and made classes hard or impossible to get delaying my graduation.

UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,thunderkitty600,6,Fri Jun 26 05:12:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I especially seeing how poorly allocated the money is sometimes.
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,mma22664,5,Fri Jun 26 05:32:20 2015 UTC,"This. is the exact reason why I won't donate. The UC has money. The schools just decide to hold onto it, spend the funds in the wrong places that don't benefit the students, and then cry that they're underfunded."

UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,Panduhhh_,-3,Fri Jun 26 07:36:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. The other bad thing about UCSB is that UCSB is the only UC that punishes its incoming freshmen by reducing the number of quarters in which they are eligible for financial aid. For example, someone with junior standing only has 4 years of financial aid. What if this student wants to take a 5th year for research, retake a class, etc.? This student is screwed under the flawed UCSB's financial aid system."
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,2four,3,Fri Jun 26 05:56:50 2015 UTC,I've actually had great experiences with the financial aid office(admins not student workers). I feel like I've done enough research about our school's financial aid programs and I've never heard of this. Can you provide some evidence of people getting cut off? I know people who are 5th years who are still getting full financial aid.
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,feralrage,0,Fri Jun 26 09:37:58 2015 UTC,I know people who are 5th years who are still getting full financial aid.   These people did not enter as junior or senior standing (with lots of AP credits).   Can you provide some evidence of people getting cut off?   I got cut off after 5 years due to sophomore standing my 1st year. They cut off my friend after 5 years (where he needed a 6th year and he entered as sophomore standing). He appealed and it took several months for the appeal to go through. Why make people appeal at all? Just give them full 6 years without appeal regardless of class standing like the other 8 undergraduate UCs.
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,porter_robertson,4,Fri Jun 26 09:41:16 2015 UTC,No point in donating a penny until I pay off student loans.
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,feralrage,3,Fri Jun 26 16:37:42 2015 UTC,I donate specifically to the sports team I was part of. It's about $350 per year of donation each year.
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,porter_robertson,3,Fri Jun 26 15:27:16 2015 UTC,just curious was it a club sport or D1 sport?
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,feralrage,2,Sat Jun 27 02:34:32 2015 UTC,D1
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,Gmoretti,2,Sun Jun 28 01:16:05 2015 UTC,"interesting, I wasn't aware people donated to D1 sports teams considering their fully funded by the school"
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,k4ng,2,Sun Jun 28 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"Can you explain to me what you mean by ""fully funded"", please?"
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,feralrage,3,Wed Jul 1 16:15:59 2015 UTC,Graduated in 1981 and haven't made a voluntary donation since then for many of the reasons others have stated here. I'm impressed though that the Alumni Association still sends me requests for donations every year for more than 30 years anyway.
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,beetling,4,Fri Jun 26 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"Graduated in 2011, I've made a one time donation of $100. I asked a lot of questions about allocation of the funds, etc but I felt the call center provided a poor experience - couldn't give me straight and clear answers to my questions, felt like they were making stuff up they thought I wanted to hear. Since that donation, they've called me about 5 times, always while I'm at work, asking for more money and never accepting a no. Finally I had to get kind of stern and upset in order to get them to stop calling daily.  It's a stark contrast to my boyfriend's alumni group (he went to Cornell) when they call for donations - a student called him and had a real, personal chat - talking about the state of the school, what she was pursuing there etc. Did not pressure for a donation or come off like a robot reading for a script, etc. so he donated gladly.  I've worked at a call center myself as a caller as well as a recruitment manager and I think UCSB really needs to re-evaluate their process and caller training. The goal should be to make a connection and remind people how the school contributed positively to their lives - not just to hound them and try to annoy them enough for them to make a donation."
UCSantaBarbara,3b5lna,electron_burgundy,2,Fri Jun 26 18:17:04 2015 UTC,I hope somebody who can do something about changing the call center sees this. This is actually great and valuable feedback!

UCSantaBarbara,3b1ut4,jcoledagoat,3,Thu Jun 25 08:02:58 2015 UTC,"Ive heard its a decent job, but as alumni, its SUPER annoying getting calls all the time. Its even more annoying when i politely explain my degree has not amounted to be getting a job that allows me to donate money, after I already paid nearly $40k for my degree, and still have loans... and they ask again so they can get their ""prize"" or ""present"" or whatever.   I will donate, but probably not for a decade or two."
UCSantaBarbara,3b1ut4,Johnnyring0,3,Thu Jun 25 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"Not going to lie... it can be pretty soul sucking.  That being said I stuck around for about 3 years, so I obviously found something to stay for.  If you like talking a lot, and do not fear rejection, then it is generally a good place to work. I stayed for the people I met, and the good pay relative to other jobs. Yes you can get a library job and sit on your butt for $8 an hour, but I probably made around $10 an hour.  They used to let you use your phones and do hw, but they got rid of that when I was working there. If this gets reinstated I would say its the best job on campus."
UCSantaBarbara,3b1ut4,BigPhilly,11,Thu Jun 25 14:41:07 2015 UTC,What's the protocol on getting off the registry? I asked a few times to not be called but I still get calls.
UCSantaBarbara,3b1ut4,2four,5,Thu Jun 25 15:45:42 2015 UTC,About a year ago I told them to call me back in 10yrs b/c that's how long I'll be paying back the debt owed from attending UCSB. They haven't tried me back since
UCSantaBarbara,3b1ut4,noleta_loc,2,Thu Jun 25 17:55:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly what I did was add their number to my phone book and I just don't pick up when they call.  I've asked to be removed as well, but this is the only thing that has worked for me.  I don't have a lot of 805 numbers calling me, so I usually guessed it was them.  I'm guessing your situation would be different since your flair says staff.  If you want the phone number that I marked, which seems to be the only number they call from, PM me and I'll give it to you."
UCSantaBarbara,3b1ut4,Squeakopotamus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's just about being super polite and yet demanding at the same time (an art form in and of itself). Policy dictates they must put you on the no call list if you ask, but its up to the Individual caller whether they actually press the do not call button or the no pledge/hang up button. Thank them for the call but politely make it clear that you wish for them to press the do not call button/ be put on the no call list. (Management makes it clear this option is only used if they specifically ask for it). People who are assholes forget that the caller has the last laugh if he/she chooses to use it (though I'm sure you're not an asshat, they run into them every shift)  Edit: as u/squeakopotamus mentioned, annual fund calls ALWAYS show up as (805) 893-XXXX. Though I think calls from any official ucsb line show up as this."
UCSantaBarbara,3b1ut4,BigPhilly,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!   Unfortunately, I work for the university, so I can't ignore 893 numbers."

UCSantaBarbara,3b1ut4,BigPhilly,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:07:31 2015 UTC,"Great work experience for business or sales in general. I'm pretty sure the job I got after college looked heavily at my experience as a caller.  Also was able to say I raised tens of thousands of dollars cold calling which looks great on a resume (easy to accomplish if you stick with it). I'm also super comfortable on the phone now, especially in initially awkward situations.  I'd say do it, and if after a month or two you still hate it, then you can always quit. Its also the only job I know of where you can pick your hours, which is super helpful."

UCSantaBarbara,3au9f3,PurppleHaze,4,Tue Jun 23 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Lead TA for cs8 here.   Don't email the professor. They can't do anything. Professors don't have add codes and don't decide who gets to be added. It's all done by the automated waitlist now.   If you do feel like talking to a person in the department about it, Benji is the dude to talk to (again, not the professor). He's on the second floor of HFH in the CS main office. But he will just tell you to get on the waitlist. If you have general questions about the class, feel free to ask me. I took it as an undergrad and have TAed for it 3 times.   It's too late for this year, but you can also consider doing it next summer when it's slightly less impacted.   All of this being said, the best thing you can do is add yourself to the waitlist and just wait it out. After a few weeks into the quarter (I think it's about 3 weeks in) the waitlist stops and if you haven't been added by that point you'll have to try again the following quarter. A lot of people do drop, in my experience, because they are surprised by the difficulty. So, you have a chance on the waitlist (though a small one)."

CS/programming can arguably be learned more easily online or through books than any other discipline.  iTunes U Udacity TheNewBoston plain old youtube /r/learnprogramming /r/learnpython ...  I don't recommend codecademy though.
UCSantaBarbara,3au9f3,TinKnight,3,Fri Jun 26 02:47:53 2015 UTC,Change your major to stats or math for a quarter. You'll be in first pass.
UCSantaBarbara,3au9f3,kohossle,4,Tue Jun 23 16:08:10 2015 UTC,The department knows about that now.

It usually fills up really fast so you probably won't be able to sign up during pass 3, but sign up for the waitlist as soon as possible.  Emailing the professor won't help, they don't have any control over who adds it."

UCSantaBarbara,3askam,InfernoBA,7,Tue Jun 23 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"Nothing to phone home about but nothing terribly terrible. They sprinkle in a theme day here and there to keep us pleased, I suppose.   I only had a meal plan for my freshman year. Started with 14 meals, switched to 10 my 2nd and 3rd quarter when I realized I barely averaged 11/week because I was never awake during breakfast, so I could only catch the lunch and dinner times. Then I would actually finish my 10 meals and eat in IV, the Costco plaza, or have microwavables (instant noodles, mac n cheese, Hot Pockets, leftovers, etc). It comes out to ~$12.50/swipe whether or not you use it, so I figured I'll take my $12.50 and eat at Freebirds.   Go with what you want, and you can lower your meal plan before the following quarter, or increase it whenever you like (correct me if I'm wrong, this was 3 years ago)."
UCSantaBarbara,3askam,fghky,-6,Tue Jun 23 04:21:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, the meals are only about 2 dollars when you live in the res halls. I upgraded from 10 to 14 meals my freshman year (so about 44 added meals throughout the quarter) and it only charged me $90 to my BARC account."
UCSantaBarbara,3askam,Louel512,3,Tue Jun 23 15:12:40 2015 UTC,"That just decreases your average cost/meal. It doesn't mean your original 10 meal plan (110 total) was just $220.   If you were a 2nd year living in a San Raf double with 14 meals you'd pay $15,468 for the year. A comparable double in Santa Ynez with no meals is $646/mo * 9mo = $5814 for the year. Some of the difference can be accounted for by amenities (eg housekeeping, distance, facilities etc) but that sure as hell doesn't cost almost $9000/year.   Off campus meal plans come out to somewhere between $9.50 and $11 per. Guest swipes are $12 per. I'll admit I was off by $2-3 but a meal is no where near $2 per. They'd be bankrupt by all that organic food and bulking bros. Not to mention all the dishes and silverware that somehow end up in the dorm rooms."

UCSantaBarbara,3askam,SOwED,4,Tue Jun 23 04:31:15 2015 UTC,"I did a 14-meal plan. I'd go for breakfast during the week and sneak out a sandwich and piece of fruit for lunch later then go back for dinner. On weekends I ate a late brunch then dinner.   Carillo was my favorite. They had homemade pasta night on Wednesdays, eggs to order every morning (highly recommend 2 fried eggs overeasy between 2 pieces of sourdough toasted with salt), waffles, soft serve, good variety at dinner too like pizza, mexican, asian, american, all kinds of stuff. Yea the novelty of it wore off about halfway through the year but I always liked the food."
UCSantaBarbara,3askam,catsxmaru,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:24:03 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind there are four total meals on weekends while there are four total meals per day during the week. So three meals a day during the week then two left for the weekend is pretty reasonable. You can go out on the weekend anyway.  If you really eat a lot then go unlimited but hit those late nights every single night and make it worth it.   I'm a bit disappointed that the university made it so people have to make this choice. When I was a freshman, there was a 19 meal plan, which I'm sure is how many meals a week most of the unlimited kids use."
UCSantaBarbara,3askam,WantCookie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"I had the 10 which was enough for me. It gave me more options to eat outside of the dining commons without wasting swipes.   The food is okay. Nothing special. Each dining commons is different and is known for different specialties. In my opinion, Carillo is the best. They have the most variety & they have themed days sometimes. Apparently Portola has pretty good brunch. DLG has consistent ""Mexican"" food and Ortega has ""sushi."" Ortega also has a take-out option for lunch and breakfast where you cram as much food as you can into a take out box. A lot of the times the food are a hit or miss, but after a while you get a feel for what food is good."
UCSantaBarbara,3askam,lyssiecat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"I went with 10 meals/week as well, but that's because I also worked at the dining commons all 4 years so I got 1 free meal each shift."
UCSantaBarbara,3askam,Kryptics,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:47:09 2015 UTC,"14 is more than enough since you'll want to eat out in IV, etc. You can always bump it up if need be.  My friends and I always thought Carillo had the best food out of all the commons. They used to have awesome greek food."

I used to work there and as an employee you get 7 I think plus a free meal whenever you work. But I hardly ever swiped at the entrance because my coworker/friend would be there. I still swiped every now and then to keep up appearances, but I was pretty much alway eating there. It's convenient if you run out of meals and not that difficult to get away with."

UCSantaBarbara,3ahscl,mma22664,12,Sat Jun 20 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"That's definitely not ok, not even IV. Take photos and document everything. You should have a move-in inspection checklist that you're required to fill out as you walk through the place, noting any damage or wear so that it doesn't get taken out of your security deposit. I don't think that's required by law, but most reputable lessors provide them for mutual protection. If you didn't get one, you can find some online.  Point being, document everything with unequivocal proof and keep hassling your land-lord.

UCSantaBarbara,3a8x7f,DrBunsenHoneydewPhD,5,Thu Jun 18 22:18:59 2015 UTC,"I've never heard anything about that here, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Give the UCSB police a call and politely ask if they'll store guns for on-campus students. My guess is no, but there's no harm in asking.   Alternatively, if you're only looking to store pistols, you could just get a safe deposit box at a local bank. Check to make sure it's not prohibited or anything, but I've never heard of any issues.   Sorry about the reception you're getting here. I'm not sure what's up with that. Just ignore them; nobody's going to accomplish anything arguing gun politics here."

From what I understood the GPA requirement for some places is set by the school you'll be studying at, whereas in other cases it's set by the EAP office to ensure that you'll be able to do the coursework and not make UCSB look bad. So if it's the second case, then 0.1 GPA point shouldn't make a difference...."
UCSantaBarbara,3a0n9m,Merry34,11,Tue Jun 16 08:25:44 2015 UTC,"Hey! Do you surf or skate or anything like that? For me I found that solitary physical activities really helped me through my depression. Especially skating and lifting. There's just something about having an activity that gives you the opportunity to hang with friends but also lets you just escape into your own mind when you want to. Admittedly though there was a time when my own mind was the last place I wanted to be. Exercise has also been proven to ease depression so that's a plus. If surfing or skating doesn't work there's always cycling, running, swimming, hiking, etc."

You ARE succeeding, at the pace that works for you right now. Give yourself credit, and (I know it's hard) avoid comparing your results to the performance of anyone else.  Personally, my favorite recharge is reading good YA books, like the Little House on the Prairie or the Chronicles of Narnia or the Series of Unfortunate Events.  I also love The Bloggess--she cracks me up and has some very real struggles herself."
UCSantaBarbara,3a0n9m,djarchie,8,Tue Jun 16 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"The counseling center has many great resources. If your therapist is off campus it might be a good idea to also see someone at UCSB, there are different challenges when you're depressed at a university. They also have process groups that are a GREAT way to learn that you're not alone and that other people are experiencing similar difficulties as you. As someone else said, meditation can be great for clearing your mind. I found that meditation and the process group really helped me as a student.  As others have said, having hobbies helps a lot, too. It keeps your mind occupied, and any type of physical activity will help your mood. There are a lot of student groups on campus, if you haven't already you should check out a bunch of those. If you don't enjoy a specific group or the people in it, check out another group. Expanding your social group helps a lot in providing support. Exercise helps too, personally I've always enjoyed going on long walks to clear my head. If you're feeling lonely that might make you feel more isolated, or it might help you feel more peaceful being out in nature.  I've suffered from depression for basically my entire life, but it does get better and I'm building a life I very much enjoy now. If you'd like, feel free to message me and I can try to find more resources that might be helpful to you, or if you'd just like to chat."
UCSantaBarbara,3a0n9m,trans-sister,3,Tue Jun 16 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"For me, meditating or doing something that I can just get ""in the zone"" for helped.  At the beginning, I lost each of my passions one at a time.. until I wasn't passionate about anything.  Then as time went by I noticed each of my passions came back one by one.  Do not despair.  Your depression will lift.  Call upon your experience with depressions in the past and use that as a guide to getting healthy and staying healthy."
UCSantaBarbara,3a0n9m,floppybunny26,6,Tue Jun 16 09:56:34 2015 UTC,"When I was told I suffer from depression, I did not want to go to the Gaucho Psychological thing the university has for these things, I'm sorry I cannot remember the organization. I didn't go because I didn't want to, not interested in what they had for me. A few weeks later, after an especially hard day I went to my friend's place where I usually went and while I was sitting there eating dinner, I broke down and started just ranting about whatever was bothering me. I don't know why but they just sat there and listened to me, and that felt great. They gave me advice like finding something to keep me occupied and find something I would be passionate about, like other people commenting on this post are saying. Some things I tried were perfect for me and some things were a big miss. The most important thing was that I was lucky enough to always have a friend or two try these new things for me. Based of my experience I found it much easier to go try these new things with other people I knew. And that is how I found my passions on campus. That does not mean that I am always happy and running about doing fun and stuff. I still have days when I feel like I can't do anything and I just want to be at home and not e around people, but I am having those days less frequently and I genuinely feel happy when I am doing stuff I like.   I'm sorry if this seems more of a story than actual advice. I am very bad at giving advice, almost as bad as I am listening to other people's advice. But the internet is anonymous and none of you will know who freeze-dried-tuna is, Haha.

You can definitely look into getting an Emotional Support Animal. Granted, they won't do much to help you in class, and owning an animal is plain expensive and a HUGE responsibility, (not to mention finding housing with your peers can be nearly impossible if you mention you have a dog.) My dog is the best damn thing to happen to me at this school. Seriously. He helps me find a reason to get the hell out of bed in the morning (he needs to be walked. I must step foot outdoors no matter how badly my depression makes me want to stay indoors, thanks to him.) I remember to take my medication (that was absolute crap at helping me before I ever got him) in the morning when I feed him after our walk (which is exercise. Another benefit.) I'm pretty sure I'm really not supposed to, but I take him to class sometimes (hey, he helps me actually look forward to class. I'm usually sure to stick to the back of the class though. Don't wanna be too much of a distraction. But my point is, he helps to get me to class. Which is pretty huge...)  You can have an animal in university housing (or any housing in the US really, as you can't be denied housing for having an ESA under the Fair Housing Act), as long as you have a letter of recommendation from your mental health professional (I got one from my psychiatrist) stating why the animal is necessary for your documented disability (please note, an ESA is NOT a service animal!) I mean, I dunno about you, but it's an option. I worked out, ate in a way that would make any doctor proud, took my meds daily and didn't even mess with mind-altering substances and I was STILL as depressed as could be. Shit went downhill pretty fast after I realized taking care of myself just wasn't cutting it. The only real reason I've found to smile (or try to finish school/stay alive/etc) is my dog. Sometimes, pills just aren't the answer.  Also, it's okay. I was pretty sad to discover I'm still a sophomore though I've been at this school over two years now. Hopefully that changes this summer. As long as you're being reasonable and not spreading yourself too thin, things should get better. You definitely need to be realistic though. If you feel that maybe you can't succeed here, it may be time to take a short (or long) break and really, REALLY focus on improving your mental state. I finally realized I had to take a year off cause my alcoholism almost killed me and I wasn't passing a single course. Just be sure that you come back though! Or at least find a school to transfer to (I realize the transfer process can take an entire year. I wish I had taken advantage of the year I wasn't at UCSB to actually work on transferring. But I'm back here now, and thankfully feeling soooo much better about school.) Sorry for the super long response, but yeah. If you like animals and find their presence to be therapeutic, and are up for the responsibility, then maybe an Emotional Support Animal is for you."
UCSantaBarbara,3a0n9m,miau242,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:32:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't read through all the other comments so sorry if I am repeating anything someone else has already said, but I'm going into my final year at UCSB and looking at managing to graduate on time other than doing some summer sessions, and I've suffered from severe depression and other issues throughout all of it so I felt compelled to respond and hopefully help out a fellow Gaucho because I know how extremely difficult this is to deal with.   My first instinct was to recommend medication, but as you said you've been trying that (which, by the way, good for you, many people haven't yet) the only thing I could say depending on how many you have tried is to keep trying different forms. I personally take Welbutrin (300 mg) with a small (5 mg) dose of Lexapro and I've found that has worked best for me. A lot of people haven't tried Welbutrin so that's why I mentioned it, just in case.   As for exercise, going off your update it seems a lot of people have recommended that, and I agree it is a known way to help depression, but I, like you, really struggle to do that a lot of times. That's where medication helped me, it brought me out of the hole to a level where I could at least have the motivation to do what I needed to help my depression.   I think the main thing that has made me continue to push through despite taking time off school (I mentioned I am doing it in 4 years, but I had to take a gap year between HS and college and then I also took a quarter off), dropping below full time for a quarter, etc. is continually finding purpose and passion for what I'm learning. The hardest part for me is always getting to class or starting my work, but since I've always loved what I am studying once I manage to get there or start studying it helps because it distracts me. Sometimes I just drive to campus because it's the only way I can get the motivation to get to class because I'm too depressed to bike, which sounds ridiculous to someone that hasn't suffered from depression but I am sure that you can relate...so if you haven't tried that maybe that could help.   So in that, two tips: (1) find a subject you love and a career path that motivates you, forget about money or prestige, and (2) do whatever it takes for you to get yourself to class, just let go of trying to ""not be lazy""--those types of labels don't apply when it's depression you're dealing with, it's a whole other animal.   Another tip is the ocean--every time I go for walks on the beach or in the ocean that helps me a ton, doesn't even have to be exercising really. Sometimes I just go sit on the benches at the edge of campus on the cliffs.   I would also say diet can help sometimes. I'm not talking about dieting, but actual nutrition. There are a lot of new studies coming out saying that sugar and certain foods can be tied to depression so that could be worth looking into. It has helped me.   Writing is also huge for me. Do you keep a journal? I definitely recommend it if not. When you're feeling depressed just grab it and start writing, see what comes out. And continue going to therapy. CAPS is great, but I actually see a therapist outside of campus that I love and has helped me a lot, but a lot of my depression is situational as well as genetic, so it depends on the individual how much therapy can help.   The last thing I would say that's helped me is really great friends and also talking to my mom who also struggles with depression. I've been really lucky in that sense. Maybe look into some support groups or something they might possibly have through CAPS to meet people, or get involved on campus through student affairs or a club or organization. Feeling tied to the community really helps and it provides a distraction. The best thing for me with my depression has always been distractions. Having a job also helps me because I won't allow myself to miss work because in a job I am obligated to people other than myself in a way you're not with school, so i find I'm better at forcing myself to go and I always feel better after I do just for getting out. So maybe that might help too--seems weird because usually having a job while you're in school makes it harder but you never know.  Sorry that was long, but I just feel compelled to respond to people that struggle with this as well, because I know how horrible it is. I think there should be ropes at graduation for people that manage to get through it, its really not acknowledge enough how challenging college is with depression.   Good luck! <3"

My appeal was based on medical reasons that impacted my schooling fall semester so my letter was mostly facts and only about a paragraph was a personal statement on why I wanted to go to UCSB. I also included  all of my supporting documents (insurance EOB, doctors notes visits, current grades, unofficial transcripts, etc). I printed everything and mailed it. They started getting back to appeals on 6/1 so they got back fast for me. Just check your UCSB admissions page constantly they'll let you know there."

It's difficult, but he's a great lecturer and really knows his stuff. Prepare to think. A lot. And be challenged. But it's worth your while.   I'm planning on taking 230 in Fall. I've heard so-so things about it, but it's a pretty fundamental algorithms class which is why I want to take it.   Are you a new CS grad student?"
UCSantaBarbara,39tzgi,Fluffaykitties,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:21:24 2015 UTC,I'm a visiting grad student and I will study there just for one year then I will come back to Brazil.
UCSantaBarbara,39tzgi,vctoir,2,Mon Jun 15 11:37:07 2015 UTC,"CS235 should not be very hard, as long as you enjoy convex hulls, embeddings, etc. If you have no experience in mathematics and algorithms, it may be not a great option, though. CS230 is about approximation algorithms -- the problems you will deal with are (NP-)hard to solve precisely, so you will study/design your own (polynomial) approximation algorithms and prove their solution quality guarantees. Experience with algorithm analysis is required. CS279 is about hacking (things like network protocols, structure of executables, and how to break them). Finally, CS140 is a relatively simple course in distributed parallel computing. You will write some parallel C++ code (MPI, Cilk++), and, possibly, some MATLAB. It deals with fundamental parallelizable problems (e.g., parallel sparse matrix-vector multiplication). If nothing has changed, you will have a chance to work on a big computational cluster from San Diego Supercomputing Center (or one of UCSB's own clusters @ CNSI). Pick whichever course is closer to your interests."

UCSantaBarbara,39tfqo,OneFootOnTheGas,2,Mon Jun 15 23:01:09 2015 UTC,I'm fairly sure this isn't true even though it seems to be a popular belief. The responsibility is on the student when registering for classes. If you check out the schedule of classes you will see:  Instructors are not authorized to change the published time of final examinations. You are responsible for arranging your program so that your final exams will not conflict or fall in rapid succession.  Now that doesn't mean you won't find a sympathetic professor...  Note also that it less likely they will give you an early exam than a later exam.
UCSantaBarbara,39tfqo,ccsfaculty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"Huh, well you learn something new every day. Like how everyone thinks ""10 minute late professor means no class!"" when that's not true at all."
UCSantaBarbara,39tfqo,OneFootOnTheGas,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:40:12 2015 UTC,"Tbh I would wait until the second week of school to ask the professors. Just because the official day is that day doesn't mean you'll actually take the test that day. The professor may have it be a take home exam or a final assignment or a test during dead week. This quarter, two of my finals were not actually on the designated finals day. Check the syllabi for your classes and see the arrangements of the finals. If all fall on the same day, THEN as your professors to move it. It's completely up to them."

The core of IV (the part of the IV CDP that's not on the UCSB campus) is only about 400 acres, and 12,000 people live in this area. I really don't see the situation improving soon. The only real open space that's left are the vernal pools."

UCSantaBarbara,39mabx,axel_val,3,Sun Jun 14 01:12:32 2015 UTC,"Yes that would be the plan (tear down, and rebuild from the ground up), and I believe it is necessary. It wouldn't happen all at once, so displacement really shouldn't be too big of an issue. Plus it's already starting to happen; look at the buildings that hold CrushCakes or SpudNuts- that's proper urban design, 3 to 5 (?) stories, with commercial space on street level. Really these old motels from what, the 1950's, have to go, they are questionably legal now, and if IV wasn't an 'unincorporated' area there's no way they wouldn't be condemned!"
UCSantaBarbara,39mabx,maxfreakout,3,Sun Jun 14 02:02:25 2015 UTC,"I agree it should happen, definitely.  As someone who lives in a meh building right now I would like to see it change, even though I won't be here for very long.  Some of these buildings are pretty big though, and I'm sure a lot of people have more than the registered number of occupants, so we're already talking like 1.2-1.5x the number that should be displaced actually being affected.  I can't imagine how many people would be displaced back into the community if Garden Court got rebuilt.  But it really does need to happen."

UCSantaBarbara,39js6y,thatayshungirl,3,Fri Jun 12 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"Get a mountain bike or a road bike, something with thinner tires that will be more efficient. Also something with good breaks (not a beach cruiser). Then spray paint the shit out of it to make it look ugly and distinct. No one will want to steal it but you still have a decent bike to go around on. Plus you'll never lose it amongst the bike racks."

UCSantaBarbara,39js6y,WantCookie,3,Fri Jun 12 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"If you're open to other suggestions, I'd recommend perhaps looking into a skateboard/longboard. You don't have to deal with the horrendous bike lanes, and you don't have to lock it up; just take it with you to class. Although, for larger lectures people tend to leave their boards in the back, and they can get potentially stolen. A way to prevent this is to get a penny board, as they fit under your feet in lecture."

I don't know much about it, but that's the only organized 11-a-side team I know of (other than D1).   For a social league you're going to want to join and intramural team or two. You do this with friends you meet, or I think you can go to the intramural sports office and they will put you on a team.

UCSantaBarbara,39gp7s,combasemsthefox,2,Mon Jun 22 06:17:26 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation with Calc 2 at my C.C. I withdrew with a W and took a couple silly classes over summer for units.   Admissions said it was all good, just don't be short units. I took Calc course UCSB taught that was equivalent once I transferred.   Since I had a 3.9 GPA, and no previous W's, the one W seemed like a random deviation, and admission was aware of it so it didn't change anything. Definitely stressful though.   EDIT: this was back in Spring 2009/entering Fall 2009"
UCSantaBarbara,39gp7s,Johnnyring0,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:33:00 2015 UTC,Admission doesn't really care about W's.

UCSantaBarbara,39gp7s,NakedWildHoney,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:07:41 2015 UTC,"with your 3.9, I wouldn't have stressed out. it's clear that your situation was an anomaly.  on another note, how intense were upper division classes for Biopsychology? I was accepted as a pre-psych major and am considering biopsych (with a minor in music) but i don't know if i can handle a year of organic chem."
UCSantaBarbara,39gp7s,swearinerin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:06:25 2015 UTC,"the upper divisions in biopsychology were fairly intense, but not too bad. There are a good amount of options though, so you can pick and choose some of the not to hard ones. I loved all the classes I took with Janusonis. Super smart and nice guy. His exams were never tricky, and always included what he personally said would be on the exams   I took:  PSY 111- Concepts in Biopsychology (I think is reqd)  PSY 115 - Molecular Neuropharmacology - (absolutely loved this class, although the curve was much higher than the biopsych majors. This class is technically a pharmacology course, so there are loads of really smart students in there.)  PSY 116 Conditioning and Learning - This class was all around great, no slides, Clear course outline/reading. Really interesting class if youre into behavioral psychology. The class did have a weird grading scale. Top 10% got A's, regardless of %. So it became really competitive, which I was not a fan of, but still managed to score well in the course.   PSY 117 Human memory (took this over summer, and it was interesting, but I wasnt a fan of grad student who taught it.)  PSY 122 Motivation (Also took over summer, and really enjoyed the class, but again wasn't a huge fan of the grad student. maybe it was just the sped up nature of the summer courses)  PSY 123 Cognitive Neuroscience (really cool, interesting class. I think it was at embarcadero hall. Really great professor, really interesting material)  PSY 134 - psychopharmacology (another one of my favorites. In depth discussion on how drugs, addiction, and all different substances can influence brain structure, development, and behavior. Fantastic class, but one the much harder courses (coursework and exams.) taught by Dr. K, szumlinski. Shes married to one of the other professors there. Dresses intersting. Great class, highly recommend.)  PSY 137L - Endocrinology Lab (super cool class, spent most of your time in lab with a grad student. The grad student you get makes ALL the difference, seriously. There are multple labs for the same class/section and each is taught by a different grad student. You have lecture once a week with the professor. Your grade is the final exam, and your LAB final paper. So it was super stressful during finals. But really cool class, and really Lab experience with Rats, brains, dissection, brain staining, etc. )  PSY 164 - complex systems - Janusonis only offers this class  occasionally. It was 20 students, intermixed with grad students. I had to request to get into the class, and pass a short little riddle/exam with the correct answer within 2 hours to gain a spot. It was an interesting situation, and a very interesting class. All based on theory of complex systems. We had to purchase and use mathematica, and create elaborate networks, which was our final project. No exams, only weekly little quizes on the reading. One of the most fascinating courses I ever took, and not really related to neuroscience.)  PSY 166- brain states - (Another Janusonis course. LOVED this course. Super interesting, mostly about psychedelics and how they effect the brain. Different brain anatomy, just overall very interesting. highly recommend. coursework was not too difficult, and should be an easy A-B. Janusonis is just a really awesome guy. )"

UCSantaBarbara,39iu4f,SmartestDumbTeen,3,Fri Jun 12 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"I assume that you're a junior since you just recently visited the school. The competition to get into any UC is increasing dramatically, so there is not a 100 percent chance that you will get in. My advice for you would be to just try and write great essays that set yourself apart from the crowd. Some of my friends, who I thought would easily get into ucsb, were actually rejected, and I think that the difference between their applications and mine that determined their fate was the essays. One kid pretty much had the exact gpa, sat, and ec activities that I had and didnt get into ucsb even though he was very very capable compared to the other applicants. So yeah, if you can, get started RIGHT NOW on the uc essays (even if you only spend 5 minutes thinking about what you might write about) and have as many people proofread your drafts as possible."

UCSantaBarbara,39iu4f,dgream,2,Fri Jun 12 03:29:49 2015 UTC,"The whole point is to be personal so the admissions officers better understand whom you are. Maybe you're asking whether you need to talk about normally private matters, and the answer is that it's up to you. A lot of people talk about hardships they usually keep private, but there's no need for you to follow suit. As long as your personality shows through the writing, you're solid."

UCSantaBarbara,39894k,Applegiraffe,3,Wed Jun 10 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"As a Mechanical Engineering Major, its hella hard to get into College of Engineering. All of the Mech. E. transfers I know had to study three years in CC before they had the pre-reqs to transfer in. It is notoriously hard to transfer in also because you need to be in the major (or get special permission) to take classes you need to get into the major. A lot of the difficulty in transferring in may be intentional to maintain the exclusivity of the program, but the upper division courses are FUCKING HARD.   Switching in after taking classes for Poly Sci, you will have a LOT of classes to make up. In my experience, the undergrad advisers for mechanical engineering are super helpful, though! Suzi See (ssee@engineering.ucsb.edu) is retiring this year, but I think Katelynn Vargas (katelynn@engineering.ucsb.edu) is taking over as undergrad adviser for next year. I would contact one of them and I'm sure you'll get the advice you need!  Honestly, switching in from Poly Sci, unless you've already taken a year of gen. chemistry, a year or two of calculus physics classes and two years of math classes, I will be surprised if you can get in without another three years at CC.

I've also heard it's not possible to change your major to engineering once you transferred here at UCSB.   Tip: if you decide to take 10A take it serious from day one. Don't get caught up in the party scene and go to CLAS.
UCSantaBarbara,39894k,lemurdecatta,2,Sat Jun 13 03:48:00 2015 UTC,"What Stantes said is true, but you have to keep in mind that there is a waiting list to get into the major. There's always 40-50 kids on the wait list with 3.0+ in math courses. And, even if you do take the math courses and get above a 3.6+ GPA in it,there might not even be room in the major so they just turn you away.  Source: Talk to the undergrad adviser about going from econ to ME."
UCSantaBarbara,39894k,pconrad0,4,Thu Jun 11 23:07:49 2015 UTC,I would e-mail the college of engineering and get an idea of what they would recommend   coe-info@engineering.ucsb.edu

I'll check with the other moderators to see what they think."
UCSantaBarbara,392ue2,beetling,3,Tue Jun 9 03:34:49 2015 UTC,"I think if you had all the flair choices still readily available, and then a ""custom"" one as like the last option, that might help keep things somewhat serious."

UCSantaBarbara,392ue2,bboe,4,Tue Jun 9 05:37:00 2015 UTC,"Our ""request for flair"" approach was created prior to the ability for users to add custom flair. I personally preferred keeping things standard as it permits building useful statistics on the number of self reported users in this subreddit both by major and degree, and it was trivial to add new flairs as they were requested [0].  When custom flair became a thing on reddit, I chose not to make it an option and until now, no one has asked for it, as far as I can recall. Adding your major to your flair is trivial for the mods, thus I am still in favor of the give people the flair they want when they ask for it approach, rather than the let people do whatever they want with their flair approach."

UCSantaBarbara,391y6u,ladybug7373,4,Mon Jun 8 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"Some prefer to have the programs on their laptop and not have to go to the computer labs to use them. CAD lab can get pretty stuffy and gross sometimes.      Just pick something you're comfortable with and can run MATLAB and SolidWorks if you're looking to use those programs at home. If you just want something simple and cheap that will last...I'd suggest looking into maybe a Lenovo?      If you won't budge from Macs, then I'd just say go for whichever one is lightest. I think all 3 of the ones you mentioned have adequate processing power for all the simple stuff."
UCSantaBarbara,391y6u,UCSBEE,2,Mon Jun 8 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"This comment is accurate. Pick something light. Any heavy computation can be done with university equipment, and your computer will mostly be for coding and modeling. If I were to do it over, I would get a MacBook Air. Now I use Linux, so I would just choose a small and light windows laptop and throw Linux Mint on there."

UCSantaBarbara,391y6u,FrickenHamster,3,Mon Jun 8 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go for the air unless you want to be dependent on the labs.  I Just finished my first year as an ME and it would have been a huge pain in the ass if my laptop didn't run solidworks well. ME10 would have been a nightmare.   An air barely has the specs to run engineering software, and in a few years it just wont work. I'm going to get myself a new laptop for next year, and I'm pretty set on a 13 inch macbook. Its pretty portable, but still powerful.  I would recommend the same for you. A 13"" macbook  will run everything you need smoothly, especially with memory upgrade which could be worth it in the long run. You'll need to get a virtual machine set up for a few things, like solidworks. You'll figure it out, though; you're an engineer!  Any decent windows laptop will work well too, but I'm with you on the mac thing. Hard to beat such a swanky UI."
UCSantaBarbara,391y6u,manusvelox,2,Mon Jun 8 19:38:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'm really leaning towards the 13"" simply for portability and I don't think that the 15"" is necessary for what I'll probably be doing. This just helped me feel more comfortable with my decision :)"
UCSantaBarbara,391y6u,capnbossman,3,Tue Jun 9 00:10:23 2015 UTC,I'm not an ME but I always recommend against MacBook Air. It just doesn't compete with a MacBook Pro in really any category and it's not even that much cheaper if I remember correctly
UCSantaBarbara,391y6u,jasperarmstrong,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"The air probably won't be able to handle a lot of what you need, especially after a few years. The pro should work fine, and 13"" vs. 15"" just comes down to preference. I personally think the 13"" screen is too small, but to each their own. Also I'm pretty sure you can't get dedicated graphics on the 13"", if that matters at all to you. The integrated graphics should be fine if all you're planning on doing is school stuff, but if you ever want to do anything graphically intensive, you'd benefit from the dedicated graphics card."
UCSantaBarbara,391y6u,-buz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:04:44 2015 UTC,"controversial opinion: I'd say get the air. What a lot of people aren't considering is you can customize the hardware when buying it. You will probably want the ram upgrade and maybe any other upgrades you want, but it should be fast enough. If you look at the benchmarks, the macbook air actually ends up being almost as fast (or even faster in some cases) than the pro."
UCSantaBarbara,391y6u,iAnswerToNoOne,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"Look up the performance of the Macbook Air vs the pro. You should not get the 15"" pro because it's just too bulky to carry in a backpack, and the extra 'processing power' is really overkill.   I'm currently using a 13"" Macbook pro, running Matlab, Solidworks (on Bootcamp windows), LabView, and some FEA programs (also on Bootcamp windows). It works great. You will probably want to upgrade your RAM if its below 4 gigs (in my case it was). Regardless, you wont be maxing out your ram with Matlab, at all. The only program that ever maxed my RAM was some FEA program, which you wont do till your senior year if you choose to do so. Upgrading your RAM to 16 gigs costs about a $100, depending on the year of your comp. With 16 gigs of RAM you might be able to run Solidworks on a virtual Windows, which would be sick."

UCSantaBarbara,38jqj2,MoAlAg,-5,Fri Jun 5 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"I got the same thing last night and thought ""WTF?"" I don't actually know why it happened, but I have a theory.  U-Mail is actually kind of fucked up, especially for people who don't use the web interface. (Since using the web interface is about the slowest possible way to check your email, and restricts what you can do with your data, there are those of us who prefer to check our email with other clients.) In particular, sometimes the back-end for U-Mail, Microsoft Office 365, apparently just fucking decides to stop working and go to lunch (technically, the problem seems to be that SMTP requests time out). When this happens, there's really no way to tell whether the email actually went out or not, so the only way to be sure it went out is to re-send it. I've complained about this to the campus technical people, and their response is basically ""it's not our fault, we don't provide that service directly, so you're welcome to complain to Microsoft yourself and see where it gets you."" Which, of course, is nowhere, because Microsoft understands perfectly that the likelihood that the campus is going to decide to pay someone else instead of Microsoft for hosting our email service is approximately zero, just as the campus technologists don't seem to think that they should actually consult the people who are using the service before they make a decision about where to outsource it to, and don't seem to think that making sure that that service is reliable in terms that were perfectly possible in 1994 is important.  So I tend to think that this is a bullshit response from the campus technologists, myself, but then, they don't really seem to care any more about what I think than Microsoft does, because what am I going to do, stop monitoring my campus e-mail?  Anyway, my guess is that whoever's in charge of sending these emails attempted to do so, ran into an SMTP timeout problem, and tried again under the impression that they hadn't gone out the first time. Or the second. Or the eighth.  EDIT. Curious about the downvotes. Anyone want to articulate why they're downvoting, or is it just that campus technologists are downvoting because they dislike being criticized?"

If you really want to live in IV, you can always sublease from people who are studying abroad. There might be some openings further from campus. I'm not so sure about apartments in Goleta.

UCSantaBarbara,38hpm9,rarelyreadsreddit,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:02:03 2015 UTC,"I got the highest grade in his class fall '13. This is what I did:  It helps to go through the slides before lecture so you aren't overloaded. Go to lecture, don't just watch the recordings. Take the time to spend an hour after each class to rewrite your notes and make sure you understand EVERYTHING he said. Especially experiments he goes over. His tests are heavy on critical thinking and analyzing data.   Your TAs will go over specific problem solving strategies for problems on the test. He never re uses questions, but he follows pretty consistent themes. DO NOT skip section. They cover the problem solving that WILL appear on your test that Sears kind of just glosses over.   Don't wait until the day before to study. Just...fucking don't. Do the practice mid term at least a week in advance so you know right away if you don't understand something.   Go to office hours. He can be long winded, but if you ask good questions he often will ask you questions back that make you think about it. And three times, over the course of three classes I've had with him, those questions he asked me ended up being exam questions.   Allocate test time. Make sure you have an idea of all the questions before you blow 30 minutes on the first one.   It's a challenging class, but totally doable if you put the time into. And super rewarding because it's a break from the ruthless rote memorization most bio courses like to through down your throat. A B in this class is more rewarding that an A in, say, bac path."
UCSantaBarbara,38hpm9,Jagable,0,Tue Jun 9 00:28:31 2015 UTC,"Don't get to worried about it, people make a big deal out if it but getting an A+ is definitely possible. I would recommend going to class as well as watching the online videos. Focus on how the experiments he covers were done and how you would interpret the results if they were different. I took notes but only to help myself pay attention. I only used the online lecture slides during the test and focused on where I could find specific data quickly. Also, don't panic on the tests, try and put something for every question, don't spend to long thinking them over, and remember that the test will probably have a huge curve (last quarter I think a 65% was an A+ for his second midterm)."

UCSantaBarbara,38dyl0,Count_Sack_McGee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:40:34 2015 UTC,"I worked there as a Freshman 3 or 4 years ago for about 6 months.  Tell me if anything's changed, but here's what I really disliked.   1) Fighting for shifts - There were only so many open spots, and you had to sign up on Sunday night if you wanted the shifts you could actually make.  Can't work Sundays?  Too bad, you get the absolute most shit shifts.  Wednesday afternoon daytime callbacks here I come.  Show up to a shift that's overbooked?  There's a good shot you're getting sent home with zero dollars.  2) Low pay - before commission you're only making like 8 bucks an hour.  You can make more if you get donations, but I'll go into that in my next point.  8 bucks is ridiculously low for what you are doing.  3) Boss determines who you sell to - There's a bunch of sub groups (old futures, new futures, lapsed, 3 year donors, gold donors, etc).  Futures never donate, so that's where you start and they move you up to the better groups.  Well it turns out I was actually good at old and new futures.  I got a 1k donation, plus a whole bunch of smaller off people who never donate.  That means they never moved me, as I was one of the few getting donations from futures.  So my pay was waaaay lower than it would have otherwise been if they put me in a decent group.  4) Management treated me like a child - I had to pee.  I was not allowed to pee until break because ""you call during call times"".  Well sure, sorry I have to take a piss man.  I guess that's my fault.  I was berated and called a lazy worker because I got a cup of water twice in a shift.  I mean, all I'm doing is talking on the phone for 3.5 hours, it's not like my mouth might get dry or something.  5) Death threats - you know what's super cool?  Getting death threats every night for doing your job.  Dude, sorry I called during dinner, the computer dials for me, I can't help it.    Things I liked:  The other callers were cool people.  Devin Desai is a boss and his Thursday night rituals/pep talks are the greatest thing known to man."

Honestly I had trouble finding a better paying job that wasn't downtown.  Once I started getting gifts I was making more than most of my friends per hour at least.  3) Deven still makes this decision but to be honest when I got good at the group I was on he would move me up which I'm not really sure how else they could possibly do it.  4) Never happened to me personally but yeah that is lame.  5) Never happened to me or anyone I ever talked to too...is it possible this is a bit of an exaggeration?

It would happen once a week or so. I remember a specific one where a guy told me to go fuck my mom in spanish, then threatened to murder me if I ever called again. He was a ""remove from list"".  It only happened on futures for me though. Afternoon callbacks, senior gifts, and 1 year donors were all super nice to me.   Glad to hear Deven's still around and still gets his inner football captain on!  I think the most memorable one he was pretending to be Tom Brady."

The only thing is you have to apply to UCEN Dining as a whole and can be placed in any of the 9(?) units that include Route 217, Corner Store, Courtyard Cafe, Coral Tree Cafe, Nicoletti's, etc. Which may not be a bad thing, I've heard a few horror stories from some of them but most of the units are pretty great to work at I think."
UCSantaBarbara,38dyl0,ohshitfuck93,2,Wed Jun 3 19:56:20 2015 UTC,Seconded. Arbor was a great job and always cool people to work with.
UCSantaBarbara,38dyl0,iambutters,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:15:24 2015 UTC,I worked at the Arbor for 3 years when I was an undergrad. I enjoyed it so much. Still wish I had the free coffee haha

You work about 10 hours a week and it's nothing demanding."
UCSantaBarbara,38dyl0,pickleless,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:35:58 2015 UTC,I work in an office on campus and it is fucking awesome

UCSantaBarbara,38dyl0,OBEYthesky,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:24:57 2015 UTC,Yep just applied (last august) off gaucholink and interviewed and I've loved my job ever since. In a tech office in saasb.

Usually super chill jobs with good pay (10-12) and flexible hours...
UCSantaBarbara,38fqcc,zanekaiser,4,Wed Jun 3 22:31:24 2015 UTC,"it's recommended to take 2 upper division bio classes at a time, especially if this is going to be your first experience with upper division mcdb courses. 108A is a pita too."
UCSantaBarbara,38fqcc,Pr0line,2,Thu Jun 4 00:13:51 2015 UTC,"a bit rough, but do-able. I wouldn't do anything more than that, assuming that's 12+ units"
UCSantaBarbara,38fqcc,piggychuu,2,Wed Jun 3 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"I believe 112 is only offered in the fall, but you could always check the enrollment history on gold to see.  As everyone said, MCDB 108A will make you feel like crap.  Horribly hard class with a teacher who doesn't really give a shit.  I posted in a thread about it with some tips, so check that out."
UCSantaBarbara,38fqcc,pickleless,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty terrified of 108A now. So I guess get a good TA is the best option?   If I may ask, what grade did you receive in the class? And what's the best possible study strategy to get around an A range grade?"
UCSantaBarbara,38fqcc,pickleless,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:03:42 2015 UTC,"I actually managed to kill the final, so ended up with an A.  I would say understand the concepts as a whole and be able to apply them.  This is definitely not a memorization based class. Try to take your midterms and final in a computer lab and label all the slides with something you could easily read and know what they contain, so if need be, you can refer to the lecture material quickly during tests.  And yep, a good TA is the best option.  I would suggest getting Andy or Kyle as a TA if they are teaching it again next year.  You can go to any section, as long as there's room.  Hope that helps."
UCSantaBarbara,38fqcc,Pr0line,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:18:31 2015 UTC,Andy's the best
UCSantaBarbara,38fqcc,immutablebeauty,2,Thu Jun 4 16:14:14 2015 UTC,Have fun in the most horrible class you'll take within MCDB if Sears is still teaching 108.
UCSantaBarbara,38fqcc,IWatchWormsHaveSex,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:12:48 2015 UTC,"Can't vouch for 131 because I never took it, but I agree with everyone else that 108A sucks and will be really hard. I hope you get a good TA. 112 was the best class I took at UCSB, but it was taught by Kathy Foltz at the time, so I'm not sure how Montell is (it's a shame that Kathy isn't teaching it, because she rocks). It is a fair amount of work, but super interesting and the expectations are reasonable.  It also depends on what else is on your plate (are these your only classes? extracurriculars?). This schedule is probably doable, but it will be a lot of work. Do you have to take the 108 series? If not, you can take 110 in winter instead, and it will be much easier and better taught."
UCSantaBarbara,38fqcc,Jagable,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:54:08 2015 UTC,"Who is TAing for 108A? Your TA will make a huge difference on your success.   I did a similar load in fall '13 but replace developmental with genetics. On top of working in a lab. (As a transfer student from sbcc) It's work, but if you can organize it's doable.   Montell likes to tangent which makes figuring what's fair game tricky, but Hayes recently redid his class so that it's much easier. Plus, he seems like a snarky bastard but I find his humor hilarious and he's great at office hours. He's super amendable towards students who show they are putting in effort. Sears makes a challenging class but if you rise to the challenge, you will learn to think critically and feel more like a scientist than in any other class. Plus, his curve is SUPER generous. He makes everything really challenging because there are a few students who will still ace it, but that means the average falls really low. Don't stress out about the number grade."

UCSantaBarbara,38bnsg,dreasurvive,2,Wed Jun 3 23:05:27 2015 UTC,Parking is free on campus and there's like 3 parking garages on campus that have motorcycle spots and then there is scattered motorcycle parking around campus near certain lectures halls and stuff. If you're gonna live in IV id suggest parking it off the street( either in a driveway or next to your place). And I recently just brought my bike to school so I haven't done too much riding here but the mountains have some nice roads to ride !

UCSantaBarbara,38b3ts,sassattack,2,Wed Jun 3 04:16:14 2015 UTC,"I heard 111 with low is a lot of work just bu itself, 108a with sears is also very hard and chem 6bl is pretty time consuming and challenging as well. Maybe hold off chem till summer or senior year?"
UCSantaBarbara,38b3ts,Extreme8,2,Wed Jun 3 03:21:18 2015 UTC,"I had this schedule last fall (but with 6al and a GE) and everyone saying that it will be tough is right. 111 with low was very time consuming for me and 108 with sears almost felt like a crapshoot even when you'd studied. If you aren't on top of either of those they'll become a problem pretty quickly, but they can definitely be done at the same time.  That being said, since 6bl meets twice per week with a report due almost every time, you might want to leave that until winter, since you could have a lot pile up on you quickly. Find a GE or elective that looks interesting so that you have something interesting outside of the two tough classes to work on.  It really is up to you though and keep in mind that I'm probably only an average student, so your experience may be different. If those are your only classes and you think you can do it, go for it, but good luck."
UCSantaBarbara,38b3ts,IBleedTeal,2,Wed Jun 3 09:01:53 2015 UTC,"I signed up for biochem, pharm, genetics, and 6bl in one quarter and it quickly went downhill. Don't overload yourself."
UCSantaBarbara,38b3ts,Pr0line,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:36:50 2015 UTC,Thanks guys! Your responses have been really helpful. I think if everyone is warning me against it I should probably do myself a favor and focus on my bio classes for now

UCSantaBarbara,38aluo,dlubach,3,Wed Jun 3 02:41:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to throw something you should study thats a total curve ball, you dont NEED to take a class on it but it's a mathematical technique that is amazingly powerful in the biological sciences (and just about every other field) called statistical mechanics. Just give a look over that, and even though it's really hard sometimes if you can understand it well enough to just be able to run it on computers and optimize from there its already a big edge over other math-weaker bio grads. For example, a physicist with a strong background in stat mech and some bio came by in the fall this year and was currently one of the best people at tracking the evolution of flu virus, beating out many specialists in that field."
UCSantaBarbara,38aluo,sky_s,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:05:00 2015 UTC,Physics has good stat mech classes if you can take those as a bio student. Biophysics is basically all stat mech and thermo.

UCSantaBarbara,389sun,peenweenie,4,Tue Jun 2 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"You will be required to either take the real calc series (3A, 3B) or the 34 series. I do not mean to offend anyone, but if you have any interest in math and you don't realllly struggle w math, I would imagine you'd get veryyy bored with the 34 series. It is a roundabout way of playing with calculus concepts via algebra and word problems. It sets the bar very low, I would encourage you to rise to the challenge and take the 3series. There are some wonderful outlets for help if it gets tough, most notably the mathlab as well as CLAS, but you'll hear about that when you get here. Good luck future gaucho :)"
UCSantaBarbara,389sun,PetaPetaa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:23:26 2015 UTC,"I took the 34 series. Would I get a prerequisite block for 3A? I really want to take higher level calc to take higher level statistic classes for enrichment, grad school and job placement."
UCSantaBarbara,389sun,PetaPetaa,0,Wed Jun 3 01:32:38 2015 UTC,"I would guess that you could convince them that 34 A/B should satisfy prereqs that ask for 3 A/B. PSTAT 5A is the intro stat class w no prereqs, and from there you'd prob take pstat 101 whos only prereq is 5A or some other form of proof that you know what's going on"

I never took AP Calc in high school too, so I had to take the 3 series. It wasn't that bad. There weren't that many word problems and that in itself was neat.  If you're planning on going into pharmacology and applying to pharm school, taking higher math courses will make you more competitive. Idk about plain bio."
UCSantaBarbara,389sun,lyssiecat,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:44:29 2015 UTC,Did you take the AP test in high school?
UCSantaBarbara,389sun,fuckkitt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:19:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a biological sciences major, finishing up my third year here. AP tests gave me credit for both calc 3A and 3B so I do not need to take them and do not plan to. As far as grad school goes I think it depends on the school or program really. I'm in a similar situation with statistics. I also received AP credit for stats but the grad school programs I'm looking into require a college stats class and explicitly state AP credit doesn't count, so now I have to take stats here even though I already have credit for it. Hope this helps and doesn't make you even more confused.  But if you need to take calc and do not already have credit for it, then yes the 3 series is required for bio majors to take."
UCSantaBarbara,389sun,Fluffaykitties,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"according to this, biological sciences accepts the 34 series, though. then, do you recommend i try testing into the 3 series since i didn't take the AP tests?"
UCSantaBarbara,389sun,Fluffaykitties,3,Tue Jun 2 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"If you're considering grad school, then definitely do the 3 series. It keeps your options open for the future. Instead of 3C I would recommend taking PSTAT though. I didn't and I regret it. (I was a bio major at UCSB, now in grad school)"

UCSantaBarbara,38655k,FreeMaeson,13,Tue Jun 2 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"Here it is:  Campus Point: Not 100% sure about campus, but always SUPers closer to dorms, then at Campus point its half newbies tryn to surf and then the other half is either aggro freshman that are trying to get freshman ladies to swoon or just genuinely nice people out there that will share the waves if you are kind back.  Devereuax: anything from 12 year old family trips to 70 old G's kicking it with the Groms(youngster surfer). Mostly long boarders or chill rides. On the rare really big days(but el nino should be nearing soon) theres 100 plus people usually sharing pretty well, but theres always that one doucher on the long board paddling around everyone and snaking them. The point is usually a little more advanced surfers just because it curls a little bit faster.  Sands: Can be fast and quick. and the people is like playing the Lotto. You either get the super aggro paddle so close your hair gets knotted in theirs and they yell and shout and splash like the little baby they really are, or just a friendly gaucho out there having fun and sharing the rides.   As for the new surfers. If you are actually a surfer you will have absolutely no problem. You, as a beginner, are 100% better than the wavestorm kooks paddling straight out with their eyes closed. I wouldn't worry too much though, give it a few weeks and even the aggros will stop bothering your for the most part. You'll learn whose a dick and whose actually part of surf culture."

Then let UC students follow so that the beaches don't flood full on good days like it already does. I back that idea with 100% support. It is very similar to ""surfventurapoint"" or something like that on instagram that posts daily to let people know if the point of ventura is firing or not.

If you want a surfcam, I'd assume that you could probably plan something out with a bunch of people, collect some funds, and through some collaboration with UCSB and perhaps some website like surfline set up some sort of webcam. I wouldn't necessarily ask UCSB for the funding, but perhaps getting permission to post a surf cam somewhere . . .   Who knows, maybe you could get some Prof with a beach view to set up a camera in their room and leave it on or something. ha."

A lease is a contract and landlords make you sign it in case this exact thing happens. Don't let him guilt trip you into helping him for his own poor choices.
UCSantaBarbara,37sqpa,soop_nazi,5,Sat May 30 02:50:04 2015 UTC,"Bot's kinda right, its a group lease. You could try to immediately find some leaser or atleast summer session A subleaser and you could be covered for the coming month. You could check on Facebook or at the Community Housing Office on campus.   But your guy is a massive dick for leaving you hanging like this, Even though you guys signed up as a group and he is not individually responsible, he is bullshitting you when he says he wants his rent money back, especially after tell you so close to the rent date that he won't pay. Don't let him guilt trip you. He should atleast pay the first month's rent since it is his fault"

UCSantaBarbara,37r6yd,gnrsalvation,2,Fri May 29 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"Took this class Fall of 2013. Ya it's really, really hard. Not because the material itself is complicated- it's really not. It's that his tests/quizzes are bizarre and his grading is unfair. I'm a CCS student and decided to pass/no pass the class because my grade ended up as 10% above the average but I was going to get a C+.   Anyways, as far as advice goes, I'd say the best thing to do is religiously attend lecture and especially study the specific examples he provides. There isn't much memorization involved in the traditional sense (it's not very term based), but rather focus on the biological processes and their importance to the organic system as a whole. When studying, get yourself in the habit of his testing style, which is free response essay style. Try to write full paragraphs about important concepts whenever you go over them. What makes his class hard is his questions are pretty open ended, but he'll give you 0 credit if you don't hit on the one sentence he wanted.  Overall he's really not a bad teacher and the material is actually pretty interesting- it's the grading that makes this class frustrating. Good luck!"
UCSantaBarbara,37r6yd,eyedeegaffe,1 point,Fri May 29 20:04:14 2015 UTC,Oh god...thanks for the advice though! It's a required class for my major and I don't think I can sub it for anything else...
UCSantaBarbara,37r6yd,MoAlAg,2,Fri May 29 20:07:43 2015 UTC,"I took his course past fall and I did well in his course. I think that eyeddeegaffe gave a good description of the course. One thing that may help you in the course is thinking to yourself why something works the way it does. Note down examples and scenarios that Dr. Saurez mentions in relation to the biological system he is lecturing on. More importantly I would recommend that you visit his office hours to make sure that you actually understand the content. There were a few moments where I thought that I totally have a handle on a topic but, he gave me some caveats that were discussed in class.   The course is not like a traditional course where you regurgitate information. There is some data interpretation on some slides which not usually found in most bio classes; it is an imperative skill for any scientist but most students do not have a hang of it. So go talk to him after class! He can teach you but he cannot understand for you.  I also took his 154 class and I found that in both classes there were always groups of students that go into the class fearing the worst. Do not approach your education with fear; this class was not designed to fail you. Just like any other class your involvement with the content and the classroom will help you."

UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,bluescholar1,1 point,Thu May 28 21:20:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not in TMP, but I took TMP 21 this spring (the intro level class open to everyone) and it was absolutely incredible. John Greathouse is a professor who has generated over $800 million in value at companies such as GoTo My PC and GoTo Meeting, as well as bring a current partner in Rincon VC. UC Davis will not give you the opportunity to sit down and talk to a guy like that one on one and share your ideas.   The big class project was to make a product out of recycled materials and go sell it. Grades were based off of originality and profit.  UCSB is a very career-oriented school. If you're clueless about your future (which is fine) you may get lost in everything that's going on. But, if you have an idea as to what you want to do, UCSB can offer you so many more opportunities to network and find jobs, especially because sb and Goleta are tech startup hotbeds. This means that you can have a relevant internship at an emerging startup while you're at school, then immediately have a job as you graduate. Plus, the big 6 financial services still scout here and pluck the cream of each graduating class at UCSB.  In conclusion, UCSB is awesome and Davis sucks."
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,2four,6,Thu May 28 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"UCSB is a very career-oriented school.    At the risk of shedding bad light on UCSB, I have to disagree. UCSB is a research-oriented school, but not a career-oriented school. All the benefits you list are available at any equally-rated university.  At USC, graduates have an open-interview event, where upcoming grads can have dozens of interviews with leading industry right on the spot. At Cal Poly, they have a program to match you with prospective internships. UCSB has what? A career fair, grad fair, and some workshops? Even SBCC has more career fairs than UCSB.   UCSB's Career Center and entire career aid plan is, unfortunately, a joke when compared to other leading universities. I say this as a graduate of UCSB and 5-year staff member.   What are we good at, then? Getting students into graduate school and preparing them for research. We have an unbelievable amount of research on campus that other campuses do not, and getting involved in it is a surefire way into graduate school, medical school, law school, etc.  I'm not going to sugarcoat anything or insist that UCSB is the best at everything, and I'm certainly not going to pretend that our undergraduate career support and opportunities are satisfactory.   And if none of you believe me, then see for yourself:   http://bap.ucsb.edu/IR/UCSB%202013%20Graduating%20Seniors%20Survey%20Summary%20Report.pdf  I think a 35% employment rate at graduation is pretty sad for a world-class institution."
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,MyIVacct,1 point,Thu May 28 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're reading that report wrong. It has a 35% response rate, but the class surveyed has 53% going to full time jobs and 22% going to grad school. That means 75% of the graduating class is going off to do something full time after graduation. It's certainly not great but it's not a terrible number either."
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,bluescholar1,-2,Sat May 30 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"He/She's not asking about USC or Cal Poly, it's Davis. No university is going to hand you anything as far as Econ/TMP goes, and it is much better to be in Santa Barbara than it is to be in Davis for entrepreneurship opportunities. I was speaking for TMP itself which is an incredible program for networking, unlike bio or chem where you sit in a lab for 20 hours a week and then realize you're going to be unemployed when you graduate.   And that's not bad light on UCSB. It IS research oriented and grad school prep for majors where you need a Masters to be relevant anyway. For majors that don't require grad school, you'll find much more focus on how to apply skills to potential careers and networking opportunities. To me that's not necessarily a bad thing, its trying to prioritize a slim budget, and offer something unique from other UC's."
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,2four,2,Thu May 28 16:35:37 2015 UTC,unlike bio or chem where you sit in a lab for 20 hours a week and then realize you're going to be unemployed when you graduate.    Nice stereotypes. Do you actually know what you're talking about?
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,bluescholar1,-1,Thu May 28 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"Do you? You're the one slagging off UCSB's broad, campus wide career opportunities for a field with highly specific, internal programs... This is a pointless argument, the question was specific about the value of the TMP program at UCSB compared to other options at Davis and that's all I'm talking about, so let's leave it at my original comment."
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,2four,7,Thu May 28 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't claim to know anything about the TMP program, but I do know a lot about UCSB's career environment since I've been here for 9 years. Claiming that UCSB is a career-oriented campus is wrong and I've provided data and experience. Claiming biology has no job opportunities is wrong and naive. I'm working in a biology lab right now and have more than enough experience to show that at the very least your comment about bio is misguided.  Your shortsighted comments on top of you being a freshman with only one class in TMP shows me that you're not qualified to give OP advice about a potentially life-changing decision."
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,bluescholar1,-1,Thu May 28 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"Biology is not relevant to this question. You admit to knowing nothing about TMP which is what the question is about. The TMP program IS career-oriented, and your ""data and experience"" has nothing to do with the original question. If OP wants to disregard my opinion because of my class level, then he/she is free to do so, but that's not your call."
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,2four,4,Thu May 28 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"My call is this:  Your statements about UCSB being a career-oriented campus and that bio has no job opportunities is wrong. You brought up those two things that ""have nothing to do with the original question."" If they had nothing to do with the original question, then why bring those points up at all?"
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,bluescholar1,2,Thu May 28 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"I wrongfully assumed that other UCSB departments were as active as econ/TMP as far as helping their students advance their careers. Luckily, the one I was talking about is all that OP was asking about, so my overgeneralization didn't cause too much damage.  You mentioned that the campus as a whole is more research oriented, and aims only to send you to grad school. I used bio as a specific major that I thought fit that theory; an example to contrast to TMP. I am not bio so the 20 hours was an exaggeration and even though you initially suggested that UCSB is bad for employment, I guess me saying that bio is one of those programs offended you. Sorry."
UCSantaBarbara,37kpck,2four,6,Thu May 28 17:55:38 2015 UTC,"It's okay, no need to apologize. Just try to avoid making vast claims about things that aren't substantiated. OP has a real question that will affect their life, there's no need for exaggeration or misrepresentation.   We're college-educated people, we can disagree and retort and we can be wrong and we can fight. Shit, I'm wrong a lot of the time, and there's probably a ton of people out there who disagree with my comments here and have more reason to. I don't intend any hostility directed to you, I just like to get the facts straight."

That is just embarrassing that they go this school and are that fucking idiotic.  The way for progress to be made is not by pissing people off. Although the talk was something that most would disagree with, who cares if they have it?  Edit:  Holy fuck I was not saying that I agreed or disagreed. I was just saying that they handled that with very little class and it looked rather bad. If this was the other way around I would be just as pissed."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,11,Wed May 27 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"I pointed that out on a facebook post about the event and everyone ripped into me saying that disrupting them was the whole point and they shouldn't be nice to 'the oppressors.'  People then judged me for not attending the event and trying to 'judge' their actions.  For pointing out that the majority of people will receive this action negatively.  They promoted this event as a ""silent protest"" for days leading up to it.  But somehow chanting for 5 minutes is apparently silent and non-engaging.  *One of the people in that comment chain saw my comment here and posted a comment to me on facebook and didn't say anything here.  I love this."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,axel_val,1 point,Wed May 27 21:53:36 2015 UTC,Can you link to the FB event page?
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,kohossle,3,Thu May 28 05:41:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think I should, but even if I wanted to it's a private event that you can only view/access via invite."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,axel_val,-6,Thu May 28 05:43:53 2015 UTC,"I'm all for freedom of speech. You're entitled to say your peace, but don't be surprised if you get shouted down when you attempt to spout off a bunch of offensive horseshit on a college campus.   If someone got up and attempted to give a lecture on why interracial marriage should be banned would you expect the audience at UCSB to sit there and respectfully listen? Hell, I'd hope that you'd join in shouting the person off stage."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,BluesDeacon,8,Wed May 27 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"If it's horseshit, let it be heard and it will be self-evident."

A lot of times they don't, especially when you start talking about bearded white men in the sky and eternal damnation."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,9,Wed May 27 20:52:14 2015 UTC,It not up to me or anyone else to prevent people from hearing horseshit. I'm not their mother.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,cuppajoe123,-8,Wed May 27 21:23:10 2015 UTC,"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.  Bigotry is everybody's problem unless you're part of the bigotry."

UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,cuppajoe123,-2,Wed May 27 21:39:36 2015 UTC,"This would be valid if one group wasn't advicating to strip the rights away from another group. If they were arguing that their church shouldn't be forced to marry gays that's totally fine, but when they are arguing that gays shouldn't be able allowed to get married anywhere that's bull shit and it's counter productive for society.   I'll make a parallel argument.  Violence is wrong, we can all agree on that.    When is it justified to use violence to stop violence?  Every situation has a possible non-violent resolution, but that's not always the best idea. I'm sure glad that when somebody starts driving around and shooting people the police department's first idea is not to wait for them to run out of ammo and then begin negotiating."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,9,Wed May 27 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"Your analogy is not very analogous because a ""arguing"" and ""advocating"" is non-violent, whereas shooting people is."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,cuppajoe123,-3,Wed May 27 23:05:02 2015 UTC,I think legally forbidding people to get married is a form of violence.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,2,Wed May 27 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference between ""speaking out"" and ""silencing/disrupting."" This could be applied just as well to the free speech issue.   First they came for those against same-sex marriage, and I did not speak out— Because I was for same-sex marriage.  Then they came for the creationists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a creationist.  Then they came for the Christians, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Christian.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.  Free speech is everybody's issue unless you're part of the majority."

This is ridiculous. Nobody is saying they can't eat jesus crackers or count beads, but people get really, rightfully mad when a group of people passes laws that infringe on the basic civil rights of another group. Beliefs like that are as ridiculous as human sacrifice or forced marriage."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,2,Thu May 28 06:15:02 2015 UTC,"I understand that and agree 100%, but keep in mind that even literal Nazis have a right to freedom of expression. The Westboro Baptists would be a more recent example. Opinions, regardless of their backwardness or proposed limits on people's rights are not sufficient grounds for silencing."

UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,lifecmcs,10,Wed May 27 19:07:56 2015 UTC,You can say whatever you want. But so can I. Part of free speech is accepting that others have the freedom to call you out.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,BluesDeacon,10,Wed May 27 19:30:33 2015 UTC,I agree with that. I also think it's better to be respectful to everybody no matter what their opinion.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,0,Wed May 27 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"I would generally agree with that. I also didn't attend the talk so I don't know how it was presented. However, when one is arguing in favor of something that is particularly abhorrent the argument becomes inherently disrespectful.   At some point it's like asking a Biology professor to treat creationists who think the earth is 4,000 years old  or someone who thinks vaccines cause autism with respect. At some point an argument simply doesn't deserve to be dignified with respect or discourse."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,BluesDeacon,16,Wed May 27 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"True, but you don't see Biology professors wasting their time chanting and shouting to interrupt creationist talks. It's a waste of time, it doesn't further understanding in any shape or form.     People who go to these talks (either the one from the story or from the example) either already believe what the speaker is talking about, in which case interrupting the speaker won't change their mind, or they want to hear why the speaker thinks that way, in which case the interrupting is rude and annoying and probably does a better job of making the audience hate the group of interest.    Either way, they end up hurting their cause more than help it."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,saors,3,Wed May 27 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah your vaccine argument makes sense. Thanks! I guess it would be hard to keep your cool in a ridiculous argument. However, I feel like letting this presentation go wouldn't have done harm as their minds wouldn't change anyway."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,8,Wed May 27 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah shit that I disagree with gets talked about in campus everyday. Hell, half of our professors spend time spouting off random shit I disagree with but I don't disrupt their classes because it is their class."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,-5,Wed May 27 19:26:48 2015 UTC,"If a professor spent time spouting off how you should deny a group of people the right to live their life, it would be your moral duty to go disrupt their class."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,3,Wed May 27 19:30:18 2015 UTC,No it's not because they have the right to say that. They can get fired for it. But I have no duty to argue them.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,-6,Wed May 27 19:35:26 2015 UTC,If you care about the people facing the bigotry you have a duty to speak up.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,2,Wed May 27 19:39:47 2015 UTC,I do care but it's not going to change their mind so what is the point?
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,-10,Wed May 27 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I see you're pulling out MLK quotes I can't argue with that.   Or was that Gandhi?"
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,6,Wed May 27 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"He has a fucking brain, that's all he needs to know this is horse shit.   Religion should have absolutely zero power in deciding who can and cannot be married.   By their logic, since we're a Christian nation, we should keep the jews and muslims and sikhs and other christless heathens from getting married."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,8,Wed May 27 19:26:22 2015 UTC,"The problem with limiting speech based on opinion is that opinions change. Imagine if 1950s American had decided that, using similar logic, any pro-gay marriage speech should be banned. At the time, ""anyone with a brain"" would have said they opposed gay marriage. It probably seemed just as obvious to them as the opposite seems to be obvious to us. But if they had done that, we probably wouldn't even be having this conversation, which I think we can all agree would have been a loss."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,Anonymous3542,4,Thu May 28 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"and I completely agree with you. But opinion should not rule over free discourse. You are doing the same thing to these people what religious fundamentalists do to each other. Silencing people is not the way to go, especially if you are a patriotic American.   ""He has a fucking brain, that's all he needs to know this is horse shit."" Really dude? you are so full of shit when you say that. You do realize that is a cop out, something similar to ""This is 2014 and we still have (insert archaic subject here). It's intellectually fallacious because you are assuming that your point of view is absolutely correct and anyone who disagrees is automatically wrong."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,lifecmcs,4,Wed May 27 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"Marriage existed before christianity, christianity has absofuckinglutely no right to tell the government who can and cannot get married.   This doesn't even take half a brain to discuss."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,8,Wed May 27 19:38:25 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're having an argument with yourself right now. Nobody on this thread is arguing for or against gay marriage. Although I would bet that pretty much everybody on this thread supports marriage equality. I certainly support it. But the issue is about censorship. You may not like what this lady has to say, but she has a right to say it. If you don't want to listen to what she has to say that's fine.  But don't go to an event that was meant to give her a forum to express her ideas and shout her down. That's just censoring of opposing ideas. You came to a college campus to be challenged on your beliefs, to be made intellectually uncomfortable and presented with new ideas. You didn't come to college to be comforted and coddled with people who think the same way as you on every issue. Engaging in discourse with people of differing views helps us learn and develop a more reasoned understanding of the world and the people in it.  Protest is absolutely necessary in society, but there is a time and a place for it. Other times its better to just listen."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,kgauchite3,-1,Thu May 28 08:44:27 2015 UTC,"This isn't a matter of intellectual comfort this is basic human rights.   At a certain point censorship is a good thing and I'm sure you agree.   I think it's nice that I would be arrested for going to a children's soccer game and waving my dick at the children. I could claim it was free speech. Maybe I believe that man-boy love is real and valid and my dick waving is in protest of the laws we have against man-boy love. It's probably a good thing that this form of free speech is censored.   I'm not familiar with the laws regarding this stuff but I'm pretty sure it's illegal, what if I try to set up the next Jonestown or Branch Dividians?  Should my free speech be protected if I'm using my power to convince people to kill themselves or harm others?  If your free speech is promoting violence on another group of people it should not be protected and I'm 99% sure it isn't in this country. That violence could be physical, sexual or structural.   If crazy lady wants to rant about how some dude lived in a whale or how some deity impregnated a married woman, or how the earth is 6000 years old that's all fine and dandy, but if they are advocating structural violence against a group of people because of their sexuality those ideas aren't worth anybody's time."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,4,Thu May 28 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"You are entitled to free speech, not free discourse. Discourse implies that someone is listening to what you have to say and responding to your argument. You don't have a right to force anyone to do that and if your argument is about denying rights to a large group of people don't be surprised if you don't get it."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,BluesDeacon,4,Wed May 27 19:44:05 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference between allowing people to listen and having no one show up vs. preventing people from being able to  listen at all. The former is fine but the second is essentially a form of censorship and appears to be what the protesters were aiming for. Not illegal of course, as /u/innovativesalad pointed, but definitely goes against the intellectual principle of free speech."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,Anonymous3542,12,Thu May 28 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point: Freedom of speech, deal with it. Its a two way street."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,Project-MKULTRA,7,Wed May 27 21:08:46 2015 UTC,"Freedom of speech   This is not a freedom of speech issue as far as we know, though. The First Amendment does not protect anybody from private individuals disagreeing with them, disrupting them when they talk, or calling them names. It's A-OK with the US Constitution if private persons do that to each other until all involved are blue in the face. It only protects you from restriction by the government. Unless we have any indication that UCSB paid those people to show up and protest, I don't believe that argument can be made."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,innovativesalad,8,Thu May 28 01:40:45 2015 UTC,"Legal, yes. But not the mature or responsible thing to do. It still violates the spirit of free speech.  Thank you for pointing that out though. People trying to apply the 1st Amendment to individuals is a huge pet peeve of mine."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,Anonymous3542,-10,Thu May 28 02:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah bro so embarrassing that they care a lot about themselves and their friends.  Also,   The way for progress to be made is not by pissing people off.   Come on..."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,vladimirscootin,13,Wed May 27 18:28:42 2015 UTC,Most people are much more inclined to listen to an argument if you aren't a dick about it.   Let's say that you thought that the Nazi party should be revived and I wanted to argue that. Do you think that you would be more inclined to listen to me if I started toting around signs and disrupting your meetings or if I just talked to you respectfully?  That is what I meant about not pissing people off.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,-9,Wed May 27 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha  If I were to take that hypothetical seriously though, I would say this:   1) In what world is that an accurate comparison? If anything, your example has more to do with the people being protested (i.e. a group that is trying to quietly and innocuously argue for the restriction of others' rights). Of course they need to be respectful. They are, as-close-to-objectively-as-possible, wrong.  2) I think we are also operating on pretty fundamentally different paradigms. I see protest, you apparently see argumentation. These people clearly don't just disagree. These students see a group arguing that they or people they care about shouldn't have rights. To respond any other way besides rejection would be to validate the Anscombe Society's point of view. Why would you want to validate the arguments of a group who thinks you should not have rights?"
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,vladimirscootin,9,Wed May 27 19:48:27 2015 UTC,"These people clearly don't just disagree. These students see a group arguing that they or people they care about shouldn't have rights. To respond any other way besides rejection would be to validate the Anscombe Society's point of view.   Spoken like a true extremist.  You can disagree and have civil discussion.  Barking commands and demanding people stand in lock step with your cause is very much fascism. Doesnt have to be right or left wing.  I stand with my LGBQT friends, but when I disagree with your tactics Im the enemy now?  Good luck getting anywhere with that in the outside world."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,kegman83,-4,Thu May 28 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"Barking commands and demanding people stand in lock step with your cause is very much fascism   7/10 would probably rage again  If you're honestly advocating that the best response to someone invalidating you as a person (I know a person isn't their sexuality, but that's often how we are defined) is to be calm and accept it then you're just showing how sheltered you are.   your tactics   Since we're taking things to extremes, maybe you've heard of this guy during that week in school you were forced to learn about black people. Sure was shitty how he kept disrupting people and causing disturbances by demonstrating for rights."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,vladimirscootin,8,Thu May 28 08:27:47 2015 UTC,I was trying to think of an extreme example so sorry if it was a bit out there. I just don't think that if the students didn't protest it that this would have been validated. It just wouldn't have been protested. I see these people who held the talk as a waste of time because I really don't believe that their minds will be changed.   Thanks for taking it seriously though.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,14,Wed May 27 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"It's not just that. They can care and not be assholes. Really? A sign that says ""Anal is the most inclusive form of fucking"" is not at all appropriate and just makes them look stupid."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,-7,Wed May 27 19:22:01 2015 UTC,But it's true.   Both men and women can enjoy being reamed in the ass.   Also you just compared fighting for human rights to trying to revive the nazi party.   Don't feed the troll.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,8,Wed May 27 19:32:10 2015 UTC,I'm not trying to troll. I was using an example that I knew most people would be against. If anything I compared their argument against gay marriage to the nazi party. I put you as the speaker and me as the protester. It's an example.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,-9,Wed May 27 19:34:29 2015 UTC,You know damn well what you're doing and it's trolling.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,CuloIsLove,8,Wed May 27 19:35:36 2015 UTC,Really not. Just giving an opinion.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,-10,Wed May 27 19:37:39 2015 UTC,"A sign that says ""Anal is the most inclusive form of fucking"" is not at all appropriate    Sorry the mechanics of gay sex is yucky to you. Unfortunately it seems to be a big issue for the Anscombe Society, so why not be frank?"
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,vladimirscootin,7,Wed May 27 19:41:17 2015 UTC,"Nobody goes around campus with signs that say anything about normal fucking either because it would be odd. I was saying it was inappropriate  for the situation. Also, anal sex is not just gay sex so I don't really know what you are going for there."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,-12,Wed May 27 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"Nobody goes around campus with signs that say anything about normal fucking   Jeez, I wonder why? It's almost as if that's not a political issue..."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,vladimirscootin,10,Wed May 27 19:50:52 2015 UTC,I love the hole you keep digging yourself into.  You just keep making yourself look more and more ignorant.  You should try to grow up and look at it from an adults perspective.  Maybe that will help you later in the world where being an asshole doesn't get you anywhere.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,fyrew,3,Thu May 28 05:35:32 2015 UTC,Yeah after the huge ass disruption
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,SixthSnail,-7,Wed May 27 18:16:48 2015 UTC,"I don't care what anybody's view on the subject is.   This is a terrible way to start any kind of discussion, especially when you're trying to make a point. If you don't care what anyone's view on the subject is then you are immediately eliminating the possibility of having your mind changed via argument and/or evidence (regardless of what position is presented). You already have all the evidence and all the answers and you will not look at it any other way. This is exactly the opposite of critical thinking and everything a college education tries to address.   Thinking critically means that you should care about what other people's views are on the subject are. I don't agree with how the protesters handled this either, but I absolutely care about the opinions of both sides because understanding motive is another part of what enables one to have informed opinions."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,PM-ME-SMILES-PLZ,10,Wed May 27 19:24:49 2015 UTC,"I think you might be reading too much into the wording there. /u/SixthSnail probably cares and has opinion on the matter, but is making this particular point without respect to whatever that opinion is."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,Anonymous3542,-6,Thu May 28 01:47:03 2015 UTC,Then don't explicitly say that you don't care.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,PM-ME-SMILES-PLZ,8,Thu May 28 01:59:25 2015 UTC,"In context, what he said is a pretty common way of saying ""regardless of."" It could be better worded sure but it's generally understood."

UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,Arya_House_of_Stark,1 point,Thu May 28 03:05:39 2015 UTC,Yeah idk why everyone is hung up on the 2 minutes of disruption and some respectability bs. Like this woman is awful lol.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,Proud_Fag,12,Thu May 28 04:53:58 2015 UTC,They had a Q and A period.  Thats when you engage them.  Yelling at them and disrupting their event puts you on par with the Westboro Baptist Church.  At the end of the day this sort of SJW tactic doesnt get you very far.  It just makes you feel better and look bad to the outside world.
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,kegman83,4,Thu May 28 18:09:31 2015 UTC,They said they didn't want to engage anyone.  They didn't want to give them the satisfaction and said they know that these people won't change their minds.  Someone said the 'point' was to show solidarity with the LGBT community and stand up for themselves.  Which can be done in a variety of other ways without angering the opposition...
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,axel_val,6,Thu May 28 04:45:39 2015 UTC,"Anti-gay people dont go to colleges like UCSB looking for converts.  They went because a spectacle would probably happen, and they can film it and go fund raise off of it.  Look!  Gays are militant!  They are coming for your families!  Give us money to stop them!  Honestly if I was on the fence on either issue, I'd think they were both assholes."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,kegman83,5,Thu May 28 05:54:51 2015 UTC,"Someone else had commented earlier (before the event) that their professor for an ethics class encouraged the class to go to the talk and speak up during the Q&A, so I completely agree with you.  Events like this at colleges are usually more about finding negativity to report than anything else, I feel."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,axel_val,11,Thu May 28 06:04:38 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, and if you want to have your anti butt sex circle jerk in private then rock on.   If you want to have it at UCSB facilities then it's a public forum, much like when crazy people yell at sorority girls for being sluts in the Arbor- people are going to tell at that guy and that they should be free to do so.   Whether or not this is a productive use for one's time is a completely different matter- You'll notice that it doesn't look like anyone from this thread attended. I sure as shit didn't."
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,BluesDeacon,3,Thu May 28 06:09:51 2015 UTC,Why are people even arguing in this thread and not submitting video arguments in chant/song format?
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,milton_freeman,1 point,Wed May 27 23:25:49 2015 UTC,The title is very misleading.   The talk was in support bigorty.

UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,MeanMrMustardMan,-1,Thu May 28 05:40:13 2015 UTC,"Sure it was a disruption, but they left after 5 minutes and let the lecture continue did they not? They made a noisy statement that's all? I don't see why people are talking about freedom of speech and censorship here"
UCSantaBarbara,37hd6v,geoffreycrayon,3,Thu May 28 06:10:03 2015 UTC,"People throw around the phrase 'freedom of speech' a lot, but in this case they might be saying that this form of protest goes against the spirit of the free exchange of ideas at an institution of learning.   There was a Q&A where people could be critical. People did ask critical questions, many of which exposed flaws or resulted in the speaker in exposing flaws in her argument. For all we know, there may have been some people in audience who are still forming an answer.

UCSantaBarbara,37ixvx,Sgtweed,9,Wed May 27 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"If your goal is grad school, then CCS math will give you better preparation. It will introduce you to proof-based courses quickly and you can start taking graduate level courses by your third year. Grad schools consider GRE scores and letters of recommendation more than your undergrad institution.   However if you find out that you don't want to do math as a profession, then graduating from UCLA will look better for jobs.  Source: I was a CCS math major"
UCSantaBarbara,37ixvx,LingBling,3,Thu May 28 02:48:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. I am pretty set on going to graduate school and majoring in math. I know CCS will better prepare me for grad school, but will it also help me being admitted to a very prestigious grad school? I see CCS physics has students going to every Ivy League possible. Do CCS math students also get admitted to top grad programs?"
UCSantaBarbara,37ixvx,Horseshoe_Crab,7,Thu May 28 02:51:16 2015 UTC,"Current CCS Physics second year, came in as CCS math. First off, let me say that CCS is amazing for anyone who is self-driven and can make the most of the opportunities available for them at a research institution. This being said, there are some pros and cons of CCS that I'd like to highlight.  First off, the CCS majors are not equal when it comes to grad admission. Each major in the college has their own way of doing things, and the physics major is older than the math major and is much more established. Par for the course for physics majors is Ivies, and par for the course for math majors is UCLA tier things or a masters at UCSB. If you're looking for a fast track to the very top grad schools, CCS math is not it (although it is still a good program).  Furthermore, the CCS math major is in a state of tumult. Be warned that it has a very high attrition rate. One of the two main professors (arguably the more beloved of the two) is leaving indefinitely for New Zealand. The degree tracks change every couple of years, as well as the grading scheme; everything is disorganized and slapdash. Many of the professors you will have will not be used to teaching CCS classes, and the quality of teaching will vary dramatically. On the flip side, you'll also get professors who aren't afraid to step outside the normal curriculum, to treat you like mathematically mature individuals, to really ask a lot of you and demand you to put in a lot of time to figuring things out. This is the best thing you can get from a math education and I'm pretty positive you won't get that in a UCLA undergrad class.  CCS majors also have access to a rather unfair amount of perks. I personally make good use of our printing lab and early pass times. The thing that really shines though is the research opportunities (oh god the research opportunities). Seriously, professors will do work with you very early on in your undergraduate career if you express interest and capability. There's also SURF, which is funding for research exclusively for CCS majors who are usually completing their second year.  In short, be prepared for a lot of self-advocacy. Want to learn topology? Ask Maribel if you're prepared for the class. Or email one of the topologists that works here and ask if they have a research opportunity for undergraduates (flashing your CCS status in the process). Want to learn the math behind string theory? Ask Maribel if she can set up a meeting for you with David Morrison, the man who pioneered it, and maybe you can hop on as one of his advisees. You get so much one-on-one time with professors if you look for it that getting letters of rec is trivial. And grad classes--you get to take them as early as second year if you want, and they are so much more challenging than upper division undergrad classes. If you see one you want to take, talk to Maribel and talk to the administration and they'll set you up. If you trust yourself to find things to interest you in math and can see a clear direction you want to head, CCS is the program for you. But don't expect it to carry you through to grad school.  Feel free to PM me any other questions you have, I'd be glad to offer my thoughts."
UCSantaBarbara,37ixvx,Horseshoe_Crab,3,Thu May 28 14:18:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your detailed reply. I'm not looking for a fast track to an Ivy League grad school because that's based more on how well I do than where I go. Obviously, going to UCLA is by no means a guarantee of anything either. I'm just worried that the name of UCSB and the rather unknown reputation of CCS will hold me back in admissions, as it may have done for other CCS math majors. If that's not the case, then I think the opportunities at CCS will help me become a better mathematician than those at UCLA."
UCSantaBarbara,37ixvx,LingBling,4,Thu May 28 15:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a legitimate concern and one of the main reasons I switched to physics. I'll say this: the main draw of CCS is your ability to do research from a very early point in your undergraduate career. I know people who have gotten papers published by the time they're juniors, even sophomores (this is rare, but definitely doable if you're committed). For a public institution, this is pretty much unheard of. For admissions into grad school--from any university--you'll need letters of rec (easy in CCS), research (also easy), grades and GRE (this is on you, independent of school, but UCSB letter graded classes are fairly straightforward coming out of the CCS track), and a track record of strong students coming from your school (CCS math doesn't have this everywhere, but we've sent people to Stanford, Berkeley, etc). If you choose to go here over a slightly more renowned school like UCLA, then you're going to need the research and letters of rec to make up the lost ground, which not everybody is able to do, so take it into account for certain, but know that you'll have the chance to make up for it in research and connections.  Also bear in mind that UCSB does not have a bad reputation by any means in math. Grad schools recognize that UCSB is an academic institution and not just a party school. All things considered, UCSB is still in the top 50 universities in the world for math (and arguably top 10 in other fields like physics and materials science, if you want to go that route)."
UCSantaBarbara,37ixvx,daf1reinside,3,Thu May 28 16:20:43 2015 UTC,There are CCS math students that get into top grad programs. Getting into a top grad program is going to be based on how well you do as an undergrad. This can be accomplished at any math program in any university. CCS stands out because it better prepares you for what graduate school will be like.
UCSantaBarbara,37ixvx,ztxi,2,Thu May 28 04:34:14 2015 UTC,As far as I know. The two CCS math major friends I had went to Stanford and Dartmouth if that helps with the decision.

UCSantaBarbara,37jtp9,tyf21,1 point,Thu May 28 05:47:11 2015 UTC,20 units is a bit much try to keep it at most 16/17. Its all pretty manageable until 2nd quarter when you take 2 bio classes... The intro to bio gets harder every year due to the amount of weeding that takes place. Around 20% of the class gets weeded. And theres 4 classes so you do the math. Honestly keep the units at a place where you can effectively study for all of your classes consistently. What i did is that i skipped physics lab winter quarter (would highly recommend cause its usually the day before big tests) and im saving ochem lab for later as well. Good luck and hope this helped!

UCSantaBarbara,37ep9a,feartrich,7,Wed May 27 05:57:14 2015 UTC,"Econ/Accounting  Premajor Econ (1, 2, 10A):  I would honestly not take Econ 1 or 2 my first quarter at UCSB. Let your shitty Fall quarter go by, then take the important classes. You don't have to listen to this, just what I would do.  Go to lecture and pay attention. Most people in Econ 1 and 2 are on reddit/facebook/twitter and will bomb the midterm (myself included in Econ 1). These classes are curved so pay attention and punish those people when the midterms come. In 10A, Do the practice problems without looking at the solutions. Even if you take 2 hours staring at the same question, try to figure it out before looking at the answers. Econ has a weird way of seeming easy if you see the solutions. However, a lot of the tests (especially in upper divs) have to do with problem solving on questions that you may not be entirely familiar with. The tests don't exactly reflect the problems.  Premajor Accounting:  Accounting taught in schools is basically teaching you how to be an accountant at a company. Like putting together their books and financial statements. Most of the classes do not directly have to do with public accounting if that is your path. However, you have to take them to become a CPA.   Econ 3A and 3B are extremely straight forward. If you want to go into public accounting at a big/small/medium firm, do well in these classes. They try to recruit freshman and sophomores now and love if you do well in these.   For those 2 classes, read the book before doing the homework. The professors use the slides in class that come with the book when they buy it. This is really nice because if you read, you will ace the class. Do the practice problems (especially in 3B) after reading. Most are very straightforward and not very tricky.  Other Premajor Requirements:  Math--Take the 34 series. Easiest classes on campus and you will never use more calc than you learn in that class. Easy GPA boost also. Some people take the 3 series thinking it will help them later. I still have another year so I'm not positive but I haven't needed them yet.   Stats--PSTAT 109 is the new Econ Stats. It used to be PSTAT 5E but that is no longer what is accepted. If you took stats in high school, this class will be easy for you. The first half of the class is basic statistics. The second half gets a bit more in depth but the professors give plenty of practice. The biggest problem a lot of people have with this class is that the staff in the stats dept. is very foreign. Although this is not a bad thing in itself, it does make it harder to communicate.  Jobs in Public Accounting:  UCSB is a kickass school for Accounting. We have programs that help you get extra units toward your CPA certification and we even have our own career center for our dept. who are really great at helping prep resumes or give advice.   The Firms recruit like crazy. For Juniors and Seniors looking for Summer internships or full time offers, recruitment is in Fall (right when school starts). For Freshmen and Sophomores looking to get involved in other programs, recruitment is in Winter.   Freshman and Sophomores, go to recruiting events! If there is any chance that you want to go into public accounting, they are a great deal. The worst case scenario is that you go to the event, realize that you don't want to go into public accounting, talk to people for a couple hours, get killer free food, and go home. Sounds awful I know. I didn't get involved until this year so I only went through recruiting once. I wish I had gotten involved sophomore year. How awesome is it that you can be going into your junior year knowing that you have a pretty secure job when you graduate already?

The tests will test your knowledge of concepts and how to apply them.   Also, for Economics BA's, think early about what you want to do with your degree. It's not like Econ and Accounting where you have a pretty good idea going in, there are a lot of paths you can take. Knowing what you want makes decision making/internship hunting/life a lot easier.

I actually used to be a chem major my first year, but I got accepted into our ChemE program and that was pretty cool.  During freshman year, your classes will generally be pretty easy (well except maybe physics ugh), so as said before, try to aim for a high GPA freshman year because the upper division classes you'll be taking next won't be as forgiving.  Also, try to get your work done on your own. I know doing homework in groups fun and all, but trying to solve something as a group isn't the same as trying to solve something on your own in an exam."

Amusing:   A long-time resident who worked there as a teller in the early 80s said that on Fridays there would be a long line of people to take out a bit of cash for the weekend. Each shift had several men and women tellers, mostly young people who were students or recently graduated, and they all had a silent implied agreement that they would arrange for the next person in line to end up at a teller of the opposite gender, just for fun and potential flirting."
UCSantaBarbara,379gym,Tube-Alloys,2,Tue May 26 00:35:31 2015 UTC,Yeah! I found confirmation of the vault story here. The second story was told to me by the person. :)
UCSantaBarbara,379gym,ccsfaculty,2,Tue May 26 03:26:20 2015 UTC,Good stuff. I think the site was a Pool hall/video arcade for a while before it became The Graduate - a bar and live music venue in the mid to late 80's. The Ramones played there in 1988. In the early 90's it was the Anaconda and hosted a lot of punk bands plus a variety of up and coming artists. Tori Amos played there on her first US tour in 1992.

They are definitely a lot of work (short essays every couple weeks, final essays, quarter long group projects), but they are manageable.

Talk to some Class of 2017 people who are taking ECE 2C with Luke right now, maybe?      Good luck with the new series. You might be screwed for the 130 series because of these changes."

UCSantaBarbara,3711cw,pineapple_pizzah,6,Sat May 23 21:32:52 2015 UTC,I'm a minor in the department so I might be able to help a little. The department has a huge emphasis on field work (at least in the geology emphasis). I don't know much about the other emphases. The undergrads in the department seem to be a very close knit group and I always seem to be hearing about research opportunities available for undergrads. The department also has a lot of connections with industry that can be used for internships and jobs. If you have any questions let me know.
UCSantaBarbara,3711cw,kluckkluckma,2,Sat May 23 21:40:48 2015 UTC,"I love geology here. We are a small department, but a very friendly and engaging one. We have all sorts of resources and all sorts of interesting people."

UCSantaBarbara,3711cw,NakedWildHoney,1 point,Mon May 25 05:24:38 2015 UTC,"I graduated from there in 2010 and I loved the major. Long story short, I was doing another major for the first two years, but then transferred into the geology department end of my sophomore years and was able to finish it in two years (for a total of fours years in college) because most of the electives transferred.  The professors were all supremely knowledgeable and helpful. Not to mention, I've never had trouble understanding any of them (which I can't say for all classes I've taken at UCSB). I've gone to their office outside of office hours countless times and they never seemed to be irritated but rather welcomed the students with questions. The department also has a great computer lab and study room. Most undergrads hang out in either place between classes and work on homework / relax (which is awesome if you get stuck on a problem). The grad students / TAs were also a HUGE help. There were TAs who went way above the call of duty in my book (coming to campus on a Sunday afternoon specifically because we had a huge paper due on Monday, answering emails well into the evening).  Obviously, I have a minor bias if you couldn't already tell. I loved the department and the major and look back on it and the people with fondness. If you have the time, contact the undergrad adviser and see if you can get a tour of the department, maybe have some questions for the adviser.   If you have any specific questions, post here or PM me and I'll try and answer. Good luck in your studies, either way :)."

UCSantaBarbara,36xr6f,HexFlash,1 point,Sat May 23 00:35:17 2015 UTC,I switched majors a couple years ago and it would've taken 2-3 weeks after turning in the paperwork according to the undergrad advisor. So I bugged her about it a few days later and she handed the paperwork to me to run it over to some office (either registrar or Cheadle). It changed within 24 hours.
UCSantaBarbara,36xr6f,fghky,1 point,Sat May 23 06:37:06 2015 UTC,"Supposedly it takes 2-3 weeks, but the last two times I changed my major it showed up on gold within a few days. It probably depends on the department and how swamped the office of registrar is.  I actually switched into ES (and then back out of it) and it was reflected on GOLD less than a week after I submitted my petition. But the good thing about ES is that even if you aren't in the major yet, the classes are only restricted pass 1 and most of the time there's still adequate space during pass 2."
UCSantaBarbara,36xr6f,stinple,1 point,Tue May 26 23:49:44 2015 UTC,"For me it was within a few days, but I was a newly admitted freshman and did not even set foot on the school yet, so that might be a thing."

If you leave with good academic standing you should have no problem being readmitted. The application is here: http://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/read_rein.aspx  The application is super easy. The deadlines are posted in thw website as well. Once you know when you want to return, I suggest to apply ASAP. That way if problems do arise you'll have time to fix them.  As for your last question, I can't really answer it since I haven't return yet :/  Anyways, I wish you the best!"

There was literally no problem being readmitted back into the school, it's all paperwork and deadlines and making sure you're on top of pass times. Like someone else said, as long as you leave in good academic standing, it should be no problem.  Honestly, finishing my major was a lot easier because I was more focused. It wasn't fun seeing all my friends finish and graduate while I still had one more year, so I was more motivated to kick ass in my classes and graduate.   Good luck!

Bad reviews are to be expected of properties in any college town.

It's privately owned, a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom, with a large living room and decent sized kitchen. Our landlord is a great guy, and he's done so much for us since we moved in because the previous tenants did not take care of the apartment whatsoever.  I would suggest trying to get an apartment a little farther away from campus. I live on 67-block, and our rent is $2400 total every month (so $600 a person). I found that my friends who lives closer to campus pay more rent and get less space, and my friends who live on 68-block pay the same rent and get even more space than my apartment. Living farther away is great too because there aren't as many parties and it's a lot quieter than living on like 65-block or something."

So take the opporunity to experience it now so you have deeper appreciation later. I think the shitty apartments are part of the charm of living in IV. It's a total slum beach town with waterfront property prices but it's just you and your pals and a beach and that's hard to beat in a lot of ways. I still get nostalgic for my shitty IV apartment just because of the atmosphere of living there. And I was not a huge partier either.  My advice is find a decent landlord or rental company. The quality of living spaces is about the same across IV unless you go further from campus or completely outside but then you lose part of the fun of living in a college town like IV.  I rented from this place I can't remember the name of but they had a tiny office on Pardall and I lived in their big complex on the 6500 block of Cordoba across from a frat. The apartment was 1 room, tiny, but just like all IV places I lived. The rental company was super nice though. I went through 2 psycho roommate situations and a crazy neighbor while living there and they were extremely supportive. In the end I also got back my full security deposit which seemed rare at least when I lived in IV a few years ago.  Keep in mind that reviews online will tend to be more negative. Ask other students that have similar interests/lifestyles to you about where they have lived and which companies were good to rent from. Go by that word more than the reviews."

So, they're often very jaded and pre-judgy when it comes to new tenants (as they probably should be). I lived in one privately owned building on 65 block of seville and the landlord was terrible - he was very nonchalant about repairs and kept 100% of the security deposit. Then I moved to a KAMAP-owned building on 65 sabado and it was much better. Still very hands-off but at least they had a much more structured leasing and moving in/out process. And we got most of out deposit back. My advice would be to document everything, damage-wise, when you move in somewhere, keep a copy of your lease agreement, and ask for an itemized receipt for any deductions from your deposit when you move out. I did none of these things and paid significantly for it."

Therefore, the following clarification may be helpful to you and your students.  The Undergraduate Biology Program maintains its policy of not restricting qualified non-majors from enrolling into MCDB 1A during PASS 1. In other words all qualified campus students with the gen chem prereqs are still allowed to enroll into MCDB 1A during PASS 1 (along with the majority of all our Prebio Major students). -That is they will still be able to enroll into the traditional Enrollment #32417 MTWF  800- 850AM course in Campbell Hall (with BUCHN 1910 as an overflow room), which has no required discussion section. There is plenty of room with over 1150 available spots.  However, there is a new limited enrollment MCDB 1A course (120 students max) starting at the same time 8-850AM in IV Theatre, that will be restricted to Prebio Majors Only for all 3 Passes. This new offering will cover the same material and meet for the same number of hours, but will have a different format by requiring a discussion section.

UCSantaBarbara,36lb0s,chronicpenguins,1 point,Wed May 20 06:00:31 2015 UTC,"Econ/math requires the more rigorous calculus course, and more of them. If you didn't take them at CC, you'll have to retake them.  It requires PSTAT 120a which was fairly easy.  It requires 10a, all econ majors do, but it is not a part of the premajor GPA.  So I believe all you need to do is pass the class to get into the major.  Some classes might require a certain grade as prereqs tho. As a transfer student you have to meet the premajor GPa to get into the major.  For me, all I had to take was math 8 and Pstat 120a.  I got a b and A respectively.  If you're not interested or good at math, and by math I mean proofs, calculus and linear algebra, I would not recommend econ/math.  Econ10a isn't that hard. Just try your hardest, and don't think of it as such a huge challenge.  They changed the grading system, before with the curve only a certain amount of students could actually get Bs,As which often resulted in the class curve lowering your actual grade.  Now a 72% is a b and I think you can retake the final If you didn't meet the requirements"

UCSantaBarbara,36lb0s,SixthSnail,1 point,Wed May 20 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"No one is fucking with you. 10a is something transfers will undoubtedly have problems with. The speed of the course and the type of material covered is something you will have some trouble grasping. I know a lot of people who transferred here and didn't get in the major because of this one class. This one class changed the outlook of there careers and now they are either majoring in something else or simply transferring to another school because of it. ""Just studying a fair amount and you'll be fine"" is not what you should accept as a good response. This class requires a different type of thinking and reasoning that people just have trouble grasping. Why go through the trouble of meeting a certain grade quota instead of transferring to a different school that has granted you full major status in there department? A lot of transfers here aren't used to the way Econ is ran here not because of a sore excuse like partying. Econ taught here is extremely different from the way it was taught at your jc. Don't take the risk just go somewhere else where you don't have to face any of these problems."
UCSantaBarbara,36lb0s,SixthSnail,1 point,Thu May 21 02:16:23 2015 UTC,"This is one persons opinion. I know tons of transfers that are in the major with me and many that are graduating and working full time in the field next month. It is very doable (in my opinion) for transfers. It really is not that hard. The sorry excuse that people make up for failing this class is that they are not used to the way it is taught. If you don't do well in a class because you are not used to the way it is taught, you will do poorly anywhere in any major. That is not a good excuse.  Also, if OP wants to go into public accounting, we are one of the most heavily respected and recruited schools for accounting. If you put the effort in, jobs are easy pickings after you graduate with this major. Switching to a worse school just because of one class is pathetic.   The ""type of thinking and reasoning that people are not used to"" is called basic calculus. It's very light theory applied to derivatives.  This person is just bitter because they did not get in the major. Tons of people get in each year. If you apply yourself, you'll be fine."

You need a good sleeping bag and eating utensils, but that's about it, not many people bring tents. There is a little hiking but the cars will take you to the sites.

UCSantaBarbara,36jy9q,feartrich,1 point,Wed May 20 00:39:55 2015 UTC,"You need to bring your own sleeping bag. A $20 bag from Kmart should be good enough. You should also bring a sleeping pad if you want to be comfortable; a yoga mat should work. The Owens Valley can get very windy, so you might want to considering bringing a tent and guy lines if wind is in the forecast. Most of the time, it's unnecessary and you can just sleep under the stars.  Even if you go alone, it's still pretty fun. You can always talk to the professors about their experiences (they have tons of stories). It's a great opportunity to make friends.  If you don't like the outdoors, you should not go, unless you like awkwardly hanging out with geology majors, or you're truly interested in rocks. At this point, I feel like the class is over-recommended. When I went, it seemed like there were way too many people who didn't enjoy camping."

SB prices look really expensive, but there are some more affordable units 40-50 miles away if you have a car. Honestly though, that's not much stuff. It might be easier to bring it home, or if you don't live in driving distance, to store it with a trusted friend."

UCSantaBarbara,36iq5v,Thee_SBeezy,2,Wed May 20 14:46:14 2015 UTC,"It's not that much cheaper, actually. I only know because I checked it out hoping that it was $60 to store over the summer.   It starts at $40 dollars or whatever, but it's x amount per unit storage - that is, one microwave would be $40, minifridge would be $40, etc. It might be cheaper to rent out a, I don't know, a 4'x4'x4' storage space (I have no clue regarding prices) rather than to have to go through each individual item . It's nice if you only have a box or something, but if you're an out of state student (cough), then you probably have at least 2 suitcases and a few boxes...that's already around $200, which could probably get you another storage solution.  I'm surprised there's no option for bikes though..."

Chances of you getting a place is low, so if you do decide to do Summer Session, you'd have to sublease an apartment from someone.   If you're not going to take FSSP, i'd say don't bother taking summer session this summer. Relax and enjoy your summer.

UCSantaBarbara,36ekqz,chronicpenguins,1 point,Tue May 19 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what happened there but often times the company who makes the product such as the fridge either doesn't sell separate replacement parts or it is cheaper to replace it.

UCSantaBarbara,36ekqz,chronicpenguins,1 point,Wed May 20 18:17:07 2015 UTC,"there were replacement parts for both.  It is also possible to remove dents without replacing the door.  Luckily the damage wasn't my responsibility, it was my housemates before I began leasing it.  For the oven they used a cleaning solution that got rid of the rust like look, you couldn't really tell without be told about it.   I believe the housemates ordered a door at the end of the year, but it might of been the wrong model.  I agree, the defects would be unfair to the next tenants.  It's also unfair to replace completely functioning units except for cosmetic defects, when there are alternative methods.  I live in a brand new house right now and the garbage disposer broke.  I tried going through warranty, and I explicitly told wolfe that We would not consent to their maintenance replacing the unit of we were to be charged.  The unit was still under warranty, wolfe sent someone over to replace it. I asked the maintenance guy how much it would be or if we were would be charged and they didn't know.  Well  probably get charged for a new unit despite it being under warranty, because I doubt wolfe will go through the warranty company because it's much easier to just charge to tenant."
UCSantaBarbara,36ekqz,chronicpenguins,1 point,Wed May 20 19:02:20 2015 UTC,"What happened when you tried to go through the warranty? Why wasn't that successful.  I would say if you get charged, threaten small claims court. They might just not want to deal with it and give up."

I consulted my dad who rents out properties and he said it's the landlords issue and that I should let them handle it because it's their property. Especially with appliances, you don't want to go changing things without their consent and stuff.  I live wih 8 dudes, so getting everyone on the same page (we might have to pay for this what do you guys think we should do) is kinda difficult.  About a week passed by since our initial maintenance request, a couple days since the phone call with warranty, and wolfe just sent someone over.  They never said if we'd be charged or not.

Aluna George had some amazing music but not much of a stage presence. Good music; not much crowd response.   I wasn't really feeling Joey Bada$$ at all. Some points were super hype and by the end the crowd was gettin down, but too much of his set was spent rapping every other word (was he rapping over the studio version of his songs lol?) and being mostly drowned out by the instrumentals. Hard to understand.   Madeon was the only artist I knew coming in and he got things really hype. Not sure if I'm a fan of continuous sets like his or not though. He didn't really play any full songs and I would've loved to hear that. Maybe that's just a criticism of live electronic performers in general though.  I was at the very front for the whole show, but had to leave 3 songs into Miguel's set because the bass was so unbearably loud. The whole front of the crowd was visibly shuddering and plugging their ears. Me and my friends just dipped over the front and left after that. Seemed like some good music but I just couldn't hear him.  Overall a fun experience. Too many UCSB kids don't understand concert etiquette and it made the front of the crowd a war-zone at times. Plus I didn't get my deep-fried Oreos and got sun-burnt too all hell. But it was free and overall a day well spent."

UCSantaBarbara,36chxa,editedit88,1 point,Mon May 18 09:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'll have to disagree.    Math 117 has 2 classes this quarter, and both had waitlists of ~20 people. Before they opened that 2nd class, there were enough students waitlisted for the department to warrant cancelling another class for this one. I'd go for this one first.  Math 108A is required for a few majors other than pure math, but the dept has done a pretty good job of opening enough seats. I took it recently and I didn't have to be waitlisted.  PSTAT 120A would be the easiest to get into of these. It's been 2 years since I took it, but it was 1 lecture of 200 people and at the end there were 17 seats open."
UCSantaBarbara,36chxa,editedit88,1 point,Mon May 18 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"You're right. The Math 117 is going to be a problem. It has only two spaces left. + I've read that advisers give add codes to waitlisted people for math courses and not the professors. Is there a limit the number of people that can be waitlisted? If you demonstrate that you'll be wasting a year if you don't take this prerequisite, can an advisers give add code the class is already maxed out? + Can students hold a course for another one?"
UCSantaBarbara,36bs0y,NikolaiHabibulin,4,Mon May 18 02:41:20 2015 UTC,"The dorm food is pretty decent.  They have deals with local growers so there's always fresh produce that's really good. They bake all their own stuff, so there's always good dessert.  You can eat at any of the dining halls and all the menus are online and there's an ap to check what's at each hall. There are a lot of ways to meet people in the dorms, a lot of events.  But even if you live off campus you'll meet people through clubs, in your major, and in classes.  It's a friendly place."
UCSantaBarbara,36bs0y,shaylenn,2,Mon May 18 09:24:12 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thank you for the information
UCSantaBarbara,36bs0y,caitberg,2,Mon May 18 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"You'll meet people no matter where you live, as long as your living in or near IV. I transferred in but skipped the dorms because I didn't want triple at Santa Ynez, which is what I was offered. I found a place off campus in IV and had a great experience."
UCSantaBarbara,36bs0y,freshairr,2,Mon May 18 04:03:05 2015 UTC,"I can only attest to San Raf as I was also a transfer student, but I think staying in one of the on campus housing was great, especially as a transfer student.   Everyone on your floor is in the same position and so personally, I found it easier to make friends seeing the same faces everyday and especially my roommates.   Dorm food is great. Never had any issues with it. Just beware of the very real ""freshmen 15"", that just because things are unlimited, doesn't mean you should always indulge that 6th piece of pizza ;)  There's also a bunch of transfer events that goes on around campus and within the dorm itself.   Personally I'd do it my first year, then move off-campus with the friends you've made your final year."

That is way too cheap to be anything in Isla Vista or the majority of the Santa Barbara area. The closest you might be able to get to that would be a Garden Court apartment shared with 4 people. From what I hear, that comes out to a little over $400 a month per person.   Your best bet in terms of finding cheaper housing would be to go in person. Otherwise, you are just an email and a faceless name to them. Take a walk through IV and write down the names of complexes that look interesting to you, because some of them have their email addresses or websites plastered on the sides since leasing season is quickly approaching."
UCSantaBarbara,36819v,iwillfightwithfire,2,Sun May 17 03:47:51 2015 UTC,My fault I meant $600 per person. Would an apartment split between 4 people in garden court be 2 people per room?
UCSantaBarbara,36819v,iwillfightwithfire,4,Sun May 17 03:52:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would be two per room for that rent amount. I shot a text to my friend and she says that she knows people who live in singles, so two to an apartment. Of course, the rent is higher that way."

I had an ok experience, didn't have roaches, but it was noisy as hell all the time, and smells move between apartments. Also, parking is fucking impossible. It's cheaper and easier to rent than a lot of places in IV, so if you're hard up, it's a good to have the option."
UCSantaBarbara,36819v,ucsbscrewup,6,Sun May 17 16:31:34 2015 UTC,does anyone here know when fall apartments usually go on lease on craigslist? Because all i see are summer apartments right now.

This is how he works: if you took regular physics or ap physics in HS, his class isn't too hard at all.  Go to lectures if you want, and he had easy (that aren't worth very tbh) that helps for the midterm. First midterm tons of people got As. Since, he puts book problems that if you can solve (along with the hw assigned) you'll do fine.

AMA  Here is the new structure of the class (for transfers at least) -You get in the major if you get a B or higher -If you get a B-,C+, or C you get a chance to retake the final at the beginning of winter quarter and you need to score a B or higher -If you get a C- or lower you can retake the class one more time but you need to earn a B or higher.  Not too hard, i got in on the retake...a lotta students stress out a lot but this is an excellent period in your life to learn how to manage your stress."
UCSantaBarbara,364wff,_Poor_Username,2,Sat May 16 20:42:19 2015 UTC,Hi I have a couple questions if you don't mind.  1) when you say you need a B on the retake final do you mean a B on the exam itself are a high enough grade on the final so that your overall grade becomes a B.  2) are there any classes you recommend taking the first semester as a transfer. People have told me to take 2 easy classes and Econ10a.  Would you by any chance have a copy of the syllabus or any practice problems on you?  Or some kind of run down on how the class operates.
UCSantaBarbara,364wff,_Poor_Username,1 point,Sat May 16 21:34:35 2015 UTC,PM me with your questions and I'll shoot you my email.  I can answer your questions after I finish studying 4 this midterm yo
UCSantaBarbara,364wff,CEEJB,6,Sun May 17 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yes it's competitive, but its not as competitive as people make it out to be. I used to be an econ major before I switched to comp sci but I really enjoyed the two econ classes I took. I never did ECON 10A, but CS has a class called CS 24 and the two are basically equivalent when it comes to weeding people out. They split the best and the worst right down the middle, and anyone who couldn't take the heat was out.  I had a really hard time getting adjusted. I was determined to succeed though. I went to every lecture, recognized the professor's hints as to what would be on the test, and worked really fucking hard to finish all of my assignments. I passed with a B+ but I know I could have done better if I had given an extra 10%.   If you have a pulse then you can get 100% in that class, it just depends on how hard you try. You're smarter than you think, and you can succeed as long as you give a shit about yourself and your future.  Congrats on getting in, I hope you make the right choice."

UCSantaBarbara,364wff,jtranimal,2,Sat May 16 14:07:04 2015 UTC,"I'm transferring to UCSB as well for Pre-Econ/Accounting.   From the stuff I've read it's a class called Econ 10a that you need to get a B or higher in. You need a 2.85 or something in pre major classes to get into the Econ major, since we're transfer students the only thing UCSB has to judge us on is that Econ 10a class.  Supposedly UCSB is tweaking some things but in past years only 30% of the students can pass with a B or higher. and if you got a B- you could take Econ100b but I've heard they've changed that.  If you get a C or C+ you can't get into the major unless you win an appeal. So it's either get a B or higher or fail and try again next quarter."

If not, you really don't have that many cheap options. I assume you don't have on-site parking at your place, and you don't want to park on the street. Sometimes the parking staff don't/forget to verify your current address, so you can snag a C permit.  If you live in IV. What I would do is a get a Night and Weekend permit. Park your car in IV for the day, then in Lot 22 for the night. Lots of people do this, I think.  As tempting as it is, don't store your car at Goleta Beach or Camino Real Marketplace.

On the other, with universities being known to be overly biased against those accused of sexual violence, I feel uneasy about the immediate suspensions of those found ""guilty"".

I'm not sure why they included free tuition, housing, etc from the university in their demands either.

UCSantaBarbara,3631bt,CEEJB,7,Sat May 16 10:05:49 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying I'm glad that this is being dealt with.   However, I can't help but wonder: How is Weyrick's case assault?"
UCSantaBarbara,3631bt,shnicklefritz,6,Fri May 15 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"Passage: ""Weyrick was the final survivor to share her experience. Her assault occurred during Halloween 2013, shortly after she had begun a “friends-with-benefits” relationship with an old high school friend. On Halloween, Weyrick became intoxicated to the point of blackout. The following day, she learned that she had unwittingly had sex with the high school friend, which unsettled her a great deal.  “I don’t know if anyone has ever experienced being told that you had an intimate experience with someone and not knowing it,” Weyrick said, “but it’s incredibly violating. And I sat on it because I didn’t want to spend my only two years at this university dealing with sanctions, dealing with policies, dealing with reporting it… but I couldn’t sit on it any longer.”  Because she decided to report later, Weyrick fell prey to the 12-month statute of limitations for filing claims under Title IX. Additionally, at the time the assault occurred, sexual assault was classified as harassment under Title IX, making it unclear what sanctions are appropriate. She may not see sanctions for her assailant before they both graduate, but she is committed to the cause nonetheless.   See more at: https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2015/05/chancellor-yang-ucsb-meet-demands-of-sexual-assault-survivors-after-13-hour-sit-in#sthash.n4Zwl8qR.dpuf""   The article states that they were FWB before the ""assault"" , she doesn't remember the sex, and then she reports it as sexual assault more than a year later... So confused  Let's reverse the roles (because gender equality and such), and say it was a guy who doesn't remember having sex with a FWB.  They wait until the statutes of limitations are over, and then reports it.  Profits with a funding for school and living expenses... Dunno if that's a full ride, but if is, that's a lot of money."
UCSantaBarbara,3631bt,chronicpenguins,4,Fri May 15 22:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, doesn't sound like assault to me either."
UCSantaBarbara,3631bt,Triprere,3,Sat May 16 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to be controversial, but I too am deeply confused.. they were already getting with one another (assuming there was consent since she herself mentions they were a thing) and there was one particular night where she ended up getting drunk and going home with the boy she's already been getting with.. I am struggling to put this story in the category of sexual assault."
UCSantaBarbara,3631bt,PetaPetaa,4,Sat May 16 01:40:00 2015 UTC,"As most of us know, intoxication affects our memory and consciousness as well as our inhibitions and judgement. Some things you might do if you are buzzed or even black out drunk (i.e. acting like a fool, saying things or doing things you wouldn't normally do) you might regret the next day, or say something along the lines of ""That's not who I am.""  Same exact situation in regard to sexual assault.  If a person is so intoxicated that they black out, consent is a really dark grey area.  It's grey because even if they say 'yes,' they are inebriated and their judgement/inhibition is impaired. If the other person isn't as intoxicated or doesn't acknowledge the fact that their ""partner"" is obviously out of their mind drunk, that counts as taking advantage of them. And on the subject of ""they were already getting with one another (assuming there was consent since she herself mentions they were a thing)"": Rape and sexual assault can happen between anyone.  If a married person assaults or rapes their spouse, it is still rape or assault.  This goes for any type of relationship; friends, FWBs, dating, etc.  It doesn't just happened between strangers."
UCSantaBarbara,3631bt,ucsbthrowaway2014,2,Sat May 16 03:53:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that it should be but I think there are important factors to consider before just blaming the victim. Deciding to get blacked out is consciously forfeiting your right to decide what happens to you and putting your life at the hands of those around you. If someone gets black out drunk then gets behind the wheel and kills someone, it doesn't matter how much they insist that they didn't plan on driving drunk, they are still held responsible because they made the decision to drink and forfeit rational thought. Why is it different if someone drinks and sleeps with someone with whom they didn't plan on sleeping?   Should the blame be distributed differently because there's a second party (the alleged assailant) involved? Some important factors here IMO: whether the sex was forced or the girl consented (even in her intoxicated state), whether or not the assailant was aware of the girl's level of intoxication, and, importantly, whether the girl was drinking on her own accord or was tricked into drinking too much or secretly slipped a pill.  These factors all make this a very complicated situation to assess and deal with judicially.   I don't mean to ramble, I just want to start a discussion. Assault, especially in the form of ""date rape"", seems so bad in IV that if I had a daughter I wouldn't want her living here. In order to solve the problem we need to clear up what that word actually means. Too far in one direction and all the blame goes to the victims, worsening the problem; too far the other way and people get wrongfully punished, which discredits  real victims and decreasing their chances of seeking help.  Anyone have some thoughts? How do those factors help determine the blame? What other factors should come into play?   Edit: By ""date rape"" I mean both pills and forced/tricked drinking"
UCSantaBarbara,3631bt,whybethis,8,Fri May 15 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I'm trying to genuinely ask a question, I'm not trying to blame anyone for anything. I'm glad that rape and assault will be taken more seriously.   When two people drink, have a prior history of hooking up, then engage in sex, how can one member be blamed? Both are intoxicated and decide to engage each other in that moment. I get that it's not consensual if you're drunk, but when both parties are drunk, along with the other aspects of the context, how can you just call one party a rapist?"
UCSantaBarbara,3631bt,shnicklefritz,1 point,Sat May 16 01:07:57 2015 UTC,"I wanted to say the same thing. I would have said it too, but I was too afraid of being accused of promoting ""rape culture."" Especially because my username is linked to my actual name (If you haven't downloaded  my chrome extension RateMyGold then please reevaluate your life and do so now).  Rape is a very serious issue, but this kind of stuff really bothers me. Honestly, if thats all to Weyrick's story, then she could also be the rapist in this situation. A woman can rape a man too, and her situation is too cloudy for the school to offer her a full ride and ruin her ex FWB's life.  If this article incorrectly summarized her story then I'm wrong, and thats fine. But I still think the school shouldn't be involved in this shit. Go to the police, get a DNA test, give your assailant due process, and then the school can take action.  Any other method may sound good on paper, but I promise you it will  turn to shit in the long run."

UCSantaBarbara,35wtdw,UrethraPlug,23,Thu May 14 04:09:30 2015 UTC,"idk how many calories are in the nachos but I'll tell you why the website is wrong. IIRC Freebirds was started by two brothers and they eventually began expanding with more locations. At some point they realized they had different visions of what they wanted freebirds to be, so the brother that wanted to expand took all of the restaurants in the freebirds chain, except for the freebirds in IV, the other brother took that one. The Freebirds in IV is not part of the Freebirds chain, so it has different recipes and portions than the rest of the freebs out there. If you go on the general website they don't even list the IV freebirds under the locations."
UCSantaBarbara,35wtdw,MyIVacct,6,Thu May 14 04:24:54 2015 UTC,"The chain Freebirds is garbage, only the IV one is good."

UCSantaBarbara,35wtdw,beetling,12,Thu May 14 18:39:12 2015 UTC,"You could look up the individual ingredients and make an estimate. For example:   Tortilla chips - 100 grams is 500 calories, and in these photos of 100 grams of various foods, tortilla chips look like this. I haven't had Freebirds nachos in a while, but that looks about right, or maybe 150 grams (750 calories). Sour cream - 1 ounce has 50 calories, and an ounce is about the weight of a key. Let's say there are two ounces of sour cream, which would be 100 calories. Chicken - a cup of chicken breast without skin is 230 calories, which sounds about right. Beans - a cup of pinto beans is 250 calories, and I'm guessing there's about half a cup for 125 calories. Cheese - I don't know what kind of cheese they use, but part-skim mozzarella has 70 calories in an ounce, and I'm guessing there are four ounces of cheese for 280 calories. Lettuce, salsa, etc. - trivial amount of calories.   That would add up to about 1235-1485 calories, with some bulky fiber from the beans.  I learned to estimate calorie counts when I was eating in a disordered way during my last year of high school and first year at UCSB. I don't know what to say other than to be kind to yourself."

There's some followup in this recent Nexus article, but it would be interesting to hear more about how effective it's been. I know there are still long-term IV residents who are unhoused or living in cars/vans, but I don't know how the numbers have changed.  These tiny houses don't have plumbing, and I don't know how you'd convince a landowner to give permission to put them on their land, so I can't imagine them being practical for IV. This reminds me of the story of Tipi Village in the mid-70s - a bunch of mostly young people decided to set up big tents in an empty lot on Sueno and live there, using the bathrooms in nearby houses of friends and so on. This only lasted for a few years because other residents complained about sanitation problems. There was a campaign to get Tipi Village formally turned into a campground with public plumbing facilities, but in 1979 the village got evicted.

Practice rooms are not limited to majors only, but I am fairly certain you do need to be enrolled in a music performance class of some kind (so either private lessons, or one of the MUS A classes like wind ensemble, etc) to 'prove' that you have good reason to need a practice room. The good news is, once you put in the deposit for the practice room key, you can keep it as long as you want even if you don't consistently enroll in music classes.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure that's how it's done, though it can't hurt to try your luck and go ask at the music department anyway - go see Patrick Chose in Music 1251. He's also the guy who will take care of your deposit, etc.  EDIT: You could also find someone with a practice room key and have them let you in every once in awhile.

UCSantaBarbara,35tsm4,hashk,8,Wed May 13 13:22:52 2015 UTC,"Senior Here, when I was a freshman I lived in FT and really enjoyed it, but that FT no longer exists. Instead, FT is but two towers standing amidst constant construction work that will not be finished by the time you start. What was once a quiet parking lot and large grass field has been turned into a hectic dirt lot filled with construction workers and machines. FT will not be enjoyable next year. On top of that, I believe the way they do FSSP now is that they keep everyone in it in the same dorm(san nic iirc) even after FSSP ends, to create a smoother, easier transition.  EDIT: if you want to do outdoor adventures just join the excursion club"

There's always a handful of people who move in/out of building each quarter.  And themed floors really depend on the RA and the effort they put. I heard the Outdoor Adventure floor in FT is pretty fun this year. However, keep in mind that not everyone on that floor requested to be on that floor. If they don't have enough people who request that floor, they just fill it up with regular residents. So don't sweat it if you think you can't keep up/ don't think you ""fit in."" The LLC's are really chill and are there to bring together people with similar interests."

This happened 3 times and finally the TA called one of them out and told her to move to the back of the lecture hall to finish the test. I couldnt hear but apparently they were whispering too. Despite all of this, there was no punishment which is really upsetting because I studied so much for this test"
UCSantaBarbara,35r9zy,tyf21,24,Wed May 13 00:24:16 2015 UTC,Just because there was no punishment during the test doesn't mean there was no punishment.   I am a TA and we normally decide the punishment after the exam. We will mark the tests of the cheaters when they turn them in so we know who they are.

UCSantaBarbara,35r9zy,Breathe_the_Stardust,6,Wed May 13 04:40:06 2015 UTC,Aren't you better off letting them finish the test in the event you were mistaken? It's also much less disruptive to the remainder of the class to move students you suspect of cheating and deal with it after the fact rather than creating a scene during a test.
UCSantaBarbara,35r9zy,metalreflectslime,4,Wed May 13 06:39:48 2015 UTC,"I usually start with a general ""everyone keep your eyes on your own paper"" while making direct eye contact; then watch them like a hawk. After that, I move the student if caught again. If it's still and issue I would pull them out of the room and handle it as not to disturb the rest of the class.   If it's something blatantly obvious, something more than stealing a quick glance, I'd adjust the severity of my response and possibly move past the warning and just move them right away."

The TA in the class was telling multiple people to keep their eyes on their own paper, NOT THREE TIMES DIRECTED AT THE SAME PERSON. The last time this happened, he asked a girl to move seats. This girl was SITTING NEXT TO A GIRL WITH AN APHI SHIRT ON.   That's it! This isn't some crazy cheating scheme, this is a girl being asked to move seats because the TA thought she was looking at another person's paper.  People are being disgusting about this. The ridiculous things I've seen said on Yik Yak about how all the Aphi girls are cheating whores, how pictures of them should be posted, how their pledge class is ugly, Jesus Christ people!

A gun has been recovered. Two UC Santa Barbara students and the two suspects were hurt during and after the apartment violence last night about 7 p.m.. Three were transported from the scene to Goleta Valley Cottage hospital. The fourth person drove himself to the hospital and the Sheriff's dept. says he claimed to have hurt himself in a car accident on campus. Injuries are not believed to be life threatening. (One was an abdomen shot, another was a through and through wound to the upper left chest.) After the incident began, others in the apartment jumped in and we're told they ""subdued"" one of the suspects who has head injuries.

Now it appears as if it's being qualified with 'pellet gun' and 'drug deal gun wrong' and ""they all knew each other"" (domestic dispute?) so we all can feel better about it in some twisted, manipulated way. I do not know the truth, as I doubt anybody here does. Of course weren't there three other armed assaults in IV the past week? There is a very strong motive ($$) for the 'institutions' (county, university) to play down these incidents, right?"
UCSantaBarbara,35o6qr,feartrich,4,Tue May 12 03:56:07 2015 UTC,"In 2013, IV had a violent crime rate of 598 incidents / 100,000 hab.  Los Angeles had a violent crime rate of 408 incidents / 100,000 hab.  The amount of crime that affects UCSB students is much much lower, something like 100-125 violent incidents per 100,000 in 2012, way below the national average. More than half of the crime in IV affects people who are from out of town or not well off. http://police-statistics.universityofcalifornia.edu/2012/ucsb.pdf"

UCSantaBarbara,35o6qr,-Richard,4,Wed May 13 00:58:59 2015 UTC,"UPDATE:   Dear Members of our UC Santa Barbara Community,  Earlier this evening an incident off-campus in Isla Vista caused us to alert our community and secure our residence halls and campus buildings. After a quick and thorough search by the UC Police Department and assurances by the Sheriff’s Office that all the suspects were in custody, we notified our campus community that it was safe to resume normal activities.  We have also been notified that those who were injured are currently receiving medical care. While we await more information from the Sheriff’s Office regarding the incident, given the events that took place in Isla Vista almost a year ago, we want to make sure that every member of our university family knows where to turn for counseling and other support, day or night as needed.   We are grateful for the vigilance and quick response of the Sheriff’s Office and the UCPD to keep our campus and our community safe. The safety of our students and campus is our highest priority, and we remain fully committed to continuing to work tirelessly with all partners and stakeholders to address the challenges in Isla Vista and improve the living and learning environment there, for the sake of our students and all Isla Vista residents."

UCSantaBarbara,35o9g4,AwesomeKermit,3,Tue May 12 23:04:38 2015 UTC,"Based on this info, I would strongly recommend cs263.   It's taught by Chandra Krintz, so you should have an idea of her teaching style since you're doing capstone.   I am a theory person, but have to take ""non-theory"" courses for my degree requirements. I took 263 because I knew Chandra as a good professor, and I'm very happy I did. I learned SO much because she presented everything very well and in an engaging way. And, there's one major project (web-based) that you work on throughout the quarter. I think it'd be right up your alley."
UCSantaBarbara,35o9g4,AwesomeKermit,3,Tue May 12 23:24:38 2015 UTC,"How did you become a TA. Just apply or were you selected somehow?   Since you're planning to teach, do you eventually plan on going phd or do you have some other route in mind?   Thanks!"
UCSantaBarbara,35o9g4,AwesomeKermit,1 point,Tue May 12 06:20:23 2015 UTC,"I did undergrad here, so I am close to a lot of the professors in the department. This helped a lot because they already knew me as a good student, and assumed I would be a good TA. I also took some time off before grad school and taught math at CLAS, so I did some some teaching experience already. But, yes, there is an application process in the CS department. Before the quarter, you fill out a form stating which classes you have taken, the grades you earned in them, and if you've taught or graded for any classes before. Then there's a part where you can pick which courses you'd be willing to teach (I think it's 3 lower div and 3 upper div you can list). There's also a part where you can write some words about why you would be a good TA.  Rumor has it that each professor can try to request one TA that they want for the quarter (again, in the CS department). So, I always talk to the professor in advance (well in the quarter before) and tell them why I want to TA for them. I think this helps, a lot.  Oh! And CS TAs must take a 1 unit course about how to be a good TA either before they TA, or during the first quarter they TA. The course is offered every fall quarter.  Right now the plan is just the masters. I think I want to teach at the community college level to focus more on teaching (rather than research) so hopefully I will be able to do that with just a masters. We will see."
UCSantaBarbara,35o9g4,kjorg,2,Tue May 12 06:28:46 2015 UTC,Rumor has it that each professor can try to request one TA that they want for the quarter   Instructors can specify up to three preferences on the TA selection form from the list of potential TAs. The list contains some students who are labeled as must-hire if they are a Ph.D. student as they are guaranteed funding. One or two of the professors is responsible for the actual matching after the forms are completed.
UCSantaBarbara,35o9g4,AwesomeKermit,1 point,Tue May 12 14:30:43 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification!
UCSantaBarbara,35o9g4,AwesomeKermit,2,Tue May 12 21:33:11 2015 UTC,Do you ever get questions from students that make you think the student is an idiot? I've never really been that comfortable talking to my TAs because I feel like I don't know anything
UCSantaBarbara,35o9g4,AwesomeKermit,10,Tue May 12 06:34:45 2015 UTC,"Long answer/story time: I mostly TA for the intro CS course. I do this on purpose. I really really like teaching students who are just starting to learn how to program. When I started my undergrad degree in CS, I had no idea what I was doing. Almost everyone in the program had engineering parents and had been coding for many years (or at least it seemed like it). I came into the program with virtually no programming experience. And it was really really difficult for me to learn. I struggled in my courses. I was also afraid to ask for help for the same reason, so I didn't. I found a good group of friends late in my 3rd year that taught me that it's okay to ask for help, and I finally started to realize that everyone, even the people who seem the smartest in your class, asks for help. Computer Science is a difficult subject for many reasons. It's challenging, and there is a lot of various topics. There's no way to know everything. This, coupled with many other factors, often inspires this phenomenon called impostor syndrome. Basically, this is a situation where you feel like you're too dumb or don't belong in whatever you're doing, and the only reason why you are where you are right now is because you faked your way through it. In short, it's a really sucky feeling that I battle myself, and do everything possible to minimize this feeling in my students. I 100% relate to feeling uncomfortable talking to people because I don't feel like I know enough, and one of my priorities as a teacher is to combat this feeling in my students as much as I can.  Some TAs will be dicks. If they are, try as best as you can to brush it off and try with another TA. There are some really good ones out there that will make the difference. If you don't feel comfortable talking to your TA after talking to them, it is not your fault.  tl;dr No. If anything, I just see myself in them.  Edit: if you're clearly making an effort, no TA should put you down about not knowing stuff. The only time I don't help my students as much as they want is when they just aren't putting in effort on their own and are fishing for answers."
UCSantaBarbara,35o9g4,bboe,3,Tue May 12 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"Impostor syndrome:       Impostor syndrome  is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be. Notably, impostor syndrome is particularly common among high-achieving women.

At first I thought it would be beneficial and that it would be a reasonable study environment for a physics major with a relatively challenging schedule. Big mistake. It was by far the hardest partying floor in the entire tower and everyone came from the other floors to party there instead. I spent a number of nights before midterms sleeping in the library because the ""quiet"" hours were not enforced at all. Waking up to pounding club music at 6am gets really tedious after the 45th time or so. It was the antithesis of a studious environment and while I'm sure that plenty of people on that floor had done well in high school and considered themselves ""scholarly"", the only thing I ever experienced on the scholars floor was hedonistic irresponsibility and childishness. That is not to say that I speak for scholar's floors in general, because some of them are probably alright. Go for an actual quiet floor if you need that kind of study environment. Otherwise any floor is probably going to offer you a decent experience. It's the students that happen to be placed in the individual halls that dictate its character, and that's mostly just a coin toss."

UCSantaBarbara,35mozc,MrUppercut,1 point,Mon May 11 20:41:01 2015 UTC,I actually already know how (thanks for the offer though!). The issue is that the gorillas that installed the previous filter on this car essentially super glued it on there and I would rather have a shop deal with it than risk screwing it up myself. It's pretty bad.
UCSantaBarbara,35mozc,Tuesday93,1 point,Mon May 11 21:25:47 2015 UTC,Do you have a filter wrench? They're pretty cheap and you can get stand alones or one that fits a socket wrench.   If you plan on changing your oil yourself in the future its probably worth the 5-6 bucks it costs.
UCSantaBarbara,35mozc,Importchef,1 point,Mon May 11 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"I have several different filter removing tools, but the filter on this car is tiny (36mm I think) so they are too big for it. The auto shops that I checked around here didn't have anything that small, so a tool will probably have to be ordered online. For a while, OSH had a tool that would have worked, but it looks like they don't carry it anymore."
UCSantaBarbara,35mozc,vairuh,2,Mon May 11 21:47:43 2015 UTC,I had an oil filter screwed on tight by a shop before. I literally had to jam a screwdriver right through the side of the filter and use that as leverage to unscrew it.   Conspiracy theory is that shops will continue to tighten the filter so you have to go back to a shop.

UCSantaBarbara,35gqk9,KarazyBrian318,2,Sun May 10 05:48:11 2015 UTC,"Depends on your definition of ""good."" If you want to do production, there's plenty of resources, you just need to get involved. I recommend taking the 106 course which is similar to making a thesis film project. Naturally as a freshman or transfer, you're most likely going to be an intern or have a lower position on crew, depending on your experience. Lots of fun and you make most of your friends in 106.   Currently, it's ""reel loud"" season, which is the biggest film event in our film department. Students make silent films, accompanied by live music, and present it to a large crowd. The film co-op, film studio, and the writers room are other organizations that you can get involved with as well.   At the end of the day, the industry doesn't give a shit about what school you went to, as long as you have a degree. Basically get involved, intern as much as you can (only about two hours away from LA), and create a community for yourself. I would take UCSB over USC that's for sure, many of my friends that graduated now work on Workaholics, Silicon Valley, and The Bachelor to name a few."

I can't speak to co-op living, but I'm almost certain that the fraternity idea won't be an option for you: partly because rushing takes time so you'd have to find housing anyway, and partly because this isn't rural America where frats can get big houses for a reasonable price to provide housing for all their members.  Many, perhaps most, fraternity members don't live in the chapter house here.  Start checking out craigslist for housing options.  I found one of my roommates on there, and it worked out well.

UCSantaBarbara,357mcx,manusvelox,1 point,Fri May 8 05:53:58 2015 UTC,"Here's a fun story or rumor going around. Netflix used to have an initiative to provide an alternative to HTTPS. They said the some of the security parts weren't just needed.  Then, a home router came on the market with a ""Netflix Accelerator"". What this router would do is capture Netflix logins and use them to download movies into a pool when Netflix wasn't used. It would get around the Netflix screen limit by also handling multiple logins and using inactive Netflix logins to download content.   Netflix flipped their shit about this and scuttled efforts to promote their HTTPS alternative.   It was an ""unknown home router"" so maybe that ""router"" was a Peerapp cache? I don't know. Either way, Netflix doesn't like caches they can't vouch for such as Peerapp. It does make sense and Netflix has started to serve content via HTTPS. Without support from them to serve a cache like this, I don't know how Peerapp would ever work.  Anyway, this is all heresay from the circles I hang around with. I don't know its veracity.   What is definitely known is that Netflix would like connections to their content servers secure and by nature un-cacheable by anybody but them, approved CDNs (Akamai), or hardware they own like Open Connect."

Live in the dorms and make memories. I wish I could go back and have that experience."
UCSantaBarbara,358fbs,mrsweaters,5,Fri May 8 05:37:24 2015 UTC,I highly suggest you don't when you are a freshman. All of the freshman are either in FT or the chi5.

UCSantaBarbara,358fbs,kingbong15,1 point,Fri May 8 06:16:33 2015 UTC,a lot of transfer live in san raf or manzi. a few also find places in IV by using craigslist or some of the UCSB facebook pages.
UCSantaBarbara,358fbs,gwenzx,4,Sat May 9 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do it. You make most of your friends in the residence halls, because well, you're living with them, and most freshmen live in the residence halls. Unlimited swipes are nice, but you can't use them in the university owned dining commons, so if you're on campus, you're SOL getting food unless you go all the way back to Trop or use your own money to buy lunch. Plus you can get unlimited swipes with a dining plan anyways.   As for all the amenities, eh. Each res hall has TVs in their rec room, FT has them in each floor lounge. You can bring your own if you're dying to watch TV, which, well, most people don't nowadays. Santa Cruz has its own movie theater too, I believe, like Trop advertises. You have pools by Manzi and FT, and Chi-5 are all by the beach. Also, the few people I've met who live in Trop are all SBCC students, and while they're definitely friendly, it's always nice to be able to connect with more UCSB students. There are obviously reasons why some may choose Trop (slightly cheaper) but ultimately, I don't think it's worth it."
UCSantaBarbara,358fbs,mma22664,2,Fri May 8 08:35:56 2015 UTC,"I heard the food sucks. Also, as a freshman, you're going to miss out on making friends and being involved on campus. I highly suggest you do not live at trop"

UCSantaBarbara,354h9w,kub0n,5,Thu May 7 01:09:49 2015 UTC,Reverse osmosis will get rid of more particles but it is pretty inefficient  using around two times more water than traditional filtration methods.  The filtered water tastes closer to what you might get out of a tap but lacks the chalky taste Goleta water is known for.  In the end it is up to you to choose the superiority!

On top of that, Madeon is a decently big artist who puts on bat-fucking insanely good sets, and AlunaGeorge also makes great EDM music so don't whine about getting an EDM-based festival when you're going to get an amazing experience.

UCSantaBarbara,352og8,SixthSnail,1 point,Wed May 6 22:49:03 2015 UTC,Every class is easier over summer. Especially if you are only taking 1-2 classes. I got an b+ over summer but believe I would have gotten lower with the amount of effort I put in if it was in the school year.
UCSantaBarbara,352og8,ballaboy,0,Wed May 6 23:30:19 2015 UTC,"3b is much easier than 10A, so it's more likely that you get the A in that class and the B+ in Econ. I took 10b two summers ago now, I heard the curves are being changed so this might be different but I got 88% on my first two midterms - and i studied incredibly hard, like for 5 days straight - which was an A- at the time. I ended up getting like 66% on the final though. I had studied as intensely for the final as the other tests, I just didn't do as well... I ended up with a B+ in the class for it. I think the class was hard as hell and required a good amount of effort.   On the other hand, 3b with Harmon is just an extension of 3A, but with some more basic accounting knowledge thrown in. I think shit like time value of money is covered again, and shit like how to prorate depreciation and whatnot. It's been a while so I've forgotten but the class is easy. That's not to say that there isn't a bunch of studying to do, but I did all the required studying and work and I ended up with an A. I did all the required studying and work and ended up with a B+ in 10a. I think if 10a is too hard for you the econ major itself might be too hard. Econometrics and 100b are kinda harder versions of this shit."

I would just like to point out that I think as a transfer, you're considered pre-psych. So you still have to try to get into the major itself when you're there. I'd say take one upper division class and get an A or B+ and apply to the major and you will be in."

UCSantaBarbara,34x1fv,mw291,1 point,Tue May 5 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"I get this issue on both chrome on my laptop and my Xbox One. Every 5-10 minutes it will stop and give me an error saying ""Whoops, something went wrong"" on my laptop and something similar on my xbox. Sometimes, instead of an error message, my xbox will start buffering again and permanently get stuck at 25%. I called resnet and they told me that I just had a terrible connection in this corner of the room (where my xbox is) and the corner of my bedroom (where my laptop would be), but I also get this problem in the living room with my laptop. I live in santa ynez by the way. I also had this problem spring quarter of freshman year in FT, and occasionally throughout last year in San Rafael.  I was advised to try using an ethernet cable, which made netflix load faster, but did not prevent it from crashing after a few minutes. Sometimes i'll get a full episode in and it will crash on the second one, but i've stopped trying lately.  I don't really care anymore... I'm just dealing with it for five weeks, but i'll mention that changing the playback speed on my computer didn't work. I tried all of the options (low, medium, high, auto- aka 360p, 720p, 1080p/i), none of them worked. However, I noticed that the quality of the video stream didn't lower when I lowered the playback data usage, so i'm not sure what to think about that...  I know one of my roommates has the same problem on his laptop, but a different roommate (same room as him) does NOT have these problems on his xbox one. He says it's because his corner of his room has the best signal in the apartment.  When I submitted a ticket for this, I was told I could ask for them to come check out the apartment's wifi signal and see if they could boost it or something, but I never replied because they made it sound unlikely to help.  I will also mention that I tracked my data usage for a week or two and noticed that this problem persisted regardless of how much data I had used in the week/day/last two hours, so my original theory that I was being throttled never panned out, and was replaced with hatred for whoever thought it was a good idea to keep accepting more students every year without improving the infrastructure.   If the school wants to accept more and more students every year, they need to build more dorms and make sure the wifi can handle the load before the students get here. You (Not you, but whoever didn't think about these obvious consequences before pushing this school to the brink of overpopulation) need to be fired.  Fuck triple rooms, fuck this slow ass wifi, fuck the admissions staff.  Tl;dr I've had this problem on xbox and laptop every year around spring quarter, and your 'solution' has never worked."

UCSantaBarbara,34x1fv,fyrew,5,Tue May 5 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"I had a longer reply written, but the long and short of it is, we're not.  We're pretty well on the cutting edge of available technology of this type, we just get traffic jams in the evenings.  Networks of this style and this size are really unique, so problems can arise, and are often difficult to solve when they do.  As for speed, hook into our wired network at any off peak time and do a speed test. At 3am you can get gigabit speeds.  At 10am you'd likely get 100+mb/s.  You can download all of GTA V (60GBs) from steam in minutes.  Wireless is fairly limited in speed and reliability because that's literally a physical limitation of wireless internet"

Another alternative, assuming that you meet the pre reqs, is to go ahead and take the classes needed for the cpa and major in something else.  You won't get an econ degree or be apart of the department, and it'll probably be really tough to get classes.  I've heard stories of the big 4 still extending job offers after switching to dif majors (off the top of my head one was comm).   It's a lot tougher if you don't have an internship though."
UCSantaBarbara,34vkol,chronicpenguins,1 point,Mon May 4 23:08:28 2015 UTC,You cannot take the upper div accounting courses without being in the major.  Edit: Also did you not get into the Econ major or the Econ accounting major?
UCSantaBarbara,34vkol,constc8,2,Mon May 4 23:38:48 2015 UTC,Neither.  I took all 5 classes and got a 2.65 econ GPA and something lower than that for accounting.
UCSantaBarbara,34vkol,chronicpenguins,2,Tue May 5 00:04:31 2015 UTC,"If you havent, I would recommend talking to the counselors.  A lot of people give up without talking to the department counselors."

UCSantaBarbara,34vkol,chronicpenguins,0,Mon May 4 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"How sure are you about this?  I considered switching majors, but decided switching schools was better because I don't seem any other major taking me anywhere in life.  No matter what I do, i'm going to pursue a CPA license. If I transfer, I have a year off that I can and will fill with relevant accounting work. If I switch majors, I stay at UCSB but with a useless major."
UCSantaBarbara,34vkol,chronicpenguins,1 point,Mon May 4 23:35:21 2015 UTC,"The people I've talked to were already in the major, but decided to major in something else.    On gold, it says restricted, but if there's room and you get an add code from the professor, the add code overrides everything. As long as you've met the pre reqs, the professor should give you an add code (assuming there's space).   I wouldn't say all other majors are useless, you could very well major in something else that has a lot of benefit (stats, FMS, actuary, econ/math, heck even physics  etc) but considering you didn't get into econ/ACC, the odds are you wouldn't do well in these majors.   Yeah, a comm degree is less useful than an ACC degree, but all that really matters is the courses for cpa and your first job.   It's probably still better degree wise  if you transferred out, but assuming the school you transfer to doesn't have the same network / job recruiting as UCSB, you're in another pickle.   Would you rather have SFSU - econ major w/ cpa or UCSB- best major you can pass in - w/ cpa .    This method is difficult, but you asked for a way so here it is."
UCSantaBarbara,34vkol,TheSanctified,1 point,Mon May 4 23:57:24 2015 UTC,I skipped a bit when I said I would end up with a useless major.  I don't have what it takes to do financial math or stats. I failed both calc classes the first time I took them and I can only assume i'll do poorly in every other calc class as well.  I just have to weigh Economics degree vs. UCSB I guess
UCSantaBarbara,34vkol,TheSanctified,1 point,Tue May 5 00:03:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would focus on making sure you have full IGETC if that hasn't been accomplished yet.

UCSantaBarbara,34vty9,shnicklefritz,5,Tue May 5 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"You might want to try the new surface. I have heard fantastic things about using One Note on it for handwritten notes (it has OCR and pressure sensitivity). You might want to try it before you buy it though.  An advantage of getting a Mac is that it's Unix based which is useful if you do any programming (which I think physics ppl often end up doing if you go into research at all). Additionally they tend to last a long time. Mine is 6 years old and still going strong. Another advantage is that they wok really well with other apple devices (e.g. iMessage on the Mac, iCloud syncing, FaceTime, etc.).  Chrome books are great for the price, but sometimes certain classes use some sort of software that doesn't run on them. You might want to just install Linix on it.  I totally agree on getting something lightweight though."
UCSantaBarbara,34vty9,jgthespy,0,Tue May 5 06:50:24 2015 UTC,Why does the fact that it's Unix based make it better for programming?  edit: I mean if you're not a CS major.

UCSantaBarbara,34vty9,jgthespy,2,Wed May 6 05:52:19 2015 UTC,"I went off on an internet adventure to learn more and he's not the only one saying it though.  It sounds like Macs are pretty unbeatable for web stuff.  Plus they're the easiest way to do iOS stuff and you can install the other two big OSes on them so they're the most versatile.  I don't think any of that is relevant for a physics major though.  Macs aren't any better at computation.  And for me, as a math major, C# and F# beat the piss out of everything else for actually getting things done.  A Macbook is going to be worthless in physics lectures too.  If you get a laptop with a digitizer, you can actually take mathy and diagram-heavy notes with it and they'll be waaaay better than anything you could ever accomplish on paper or on a regular laptop."
UCSantaBarbara,34vty9,-buz,7,Wed May 6 06:03:22 2015 UTC,No it doesn't matter. Although if you were a CS major i'd recommend a Macbook.
UCSantaBarbara,34vty9,numijokijikomun,6,Thu May 7 21:37:02 2015 UTC,Don't know why this is getting downvoted. A Mac is seriously the best option for a programmer. Reasons for this were stated in the other comment. But it really just comes down to personal preference. Don't sweat it.
UCSantaBarbara,34vty9,fasthall,1 point,Tue May 5 01:50:37 2015 UTC,"Didn't mean to argue here, but Mac is the best option only if you need a quick setup or to develop iOS app. I always told my students there are many good Linux distributions they should try."

UCSantaBarbara,34vty9,jgthespy,2,Tue May 5 06:41:06 2015 UTC,"Unbelievably good with OneNote.  I've been using it for all of my notes and all of my homework for a little over a year now.  I'm a math major so I do everything with the pen, although typed notes are really nice in OneNote as well.  It's everything pencil and paper is and then about a billion things on top.  I'm just going to make a list of all of the things that I use every day that make it awesome.   Colored pens and highlighters pinned to the menu for quick access Moving and resizing text Undo, Copy/Paste, normal computer stuff Insert blank space between lines Instant erase with the back of the pen.  People who don't believe that it's better than pencil and paper like to scoff at this one but it's actually a huge deal unless you and your professor both do everything perfect the first time. Instant erase of huge blocks of text with a selection box You can change the paper to have lines or make it graph paper.  I take most of my notes on college ruled lines but any time I need to make a graph I can just change it to graph paper, make the graph, then change it back to lines. ""Print to OneNote"" lets you send anything that you can print into OneNote.  Good for PDFs. Screen clipping lets you draw a box around anything on your screen and sends the picture to OneNote.  I use this to insert stuff from the textbook or send the homework problems to my homework pages so that I don't have to copy them or refer back to the book. Onedrive integration makes my notes accessible anywhere I have an internet connection without me having to do anything.   It also integrates with everything else in Office so you can send slides or spreadsheets or whatever else you're doing to OneNote and modify it without going back and forth.  The pen isn't like one of those nubby iPad styluses.  It has a pen-sized point at the end and pressure sensitivity so you can vary the thickness of lines by pushing harder.  I'm not sure if the new N-trig pens have removable tips but mine has a Wacom pen so I replaced the tip with a felt one to make it feel a little more like paper.  It also disables the touchscreen once it's about a half inch above the screen so you can rest your palm wherever you want.  So yeah it's awesome.  I will never buy a laptop without a touchscreen and digitizer again."

Yes you need to try harder, but since you're above the average you'll definitely pass. When I took physics 3, the midterm average was something like 30%. And don't most physics classes replace the Midterm with your final exam if it's better? Either way, physics classes are most always curved due to low scores like that.   As for studying, CLAS is extremely helpful. They also post practice exams on the clas website. The specific clas instructor for your physics class will have knowledge of the teacher's past tests and question types. They will really help you out for the test. You don't even have to pay attention, just listen when they talk about the types of questions the teacher will ask and when they give out practice tests.   Also just do random practice problems."
UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,Fluffaykitties,2,Mon May 4 03:31:52 2015 UTC,It's really unclear if he'll replace our midterm grade with the final grade. He deviates from the syllabus which doesn't have much information in it anyway so I don't really know what grades I need to get for an A (which is still my goal).  I'll definitely make better use of CLAS resources. Thanks.

UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,MildMannered_BearJew,3,Tue May 5 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"For W's without a medical excuse, you have to take all W's. You can only take selective W's with a medical excuse. So assuming he does not have a medical excuse, it is either 1 D all A's or all W's."

I exaggerated a bit about how unrelated to the material the midterm was (emotions and stuff), but I'll look over the midterm again and see if I can find concrete examples."
UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,-buz,4,Mon May 4 03:31:17 2015 UTC,"Hey bud, physics major here. Can you link the midterm? I can tell you how to study for it when I see it.   Also, who is the prof?"
UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,ogredan,2,Mon May 4 21:23:17 2015 UTC,"Would someone PM me who we're talking about?  I'm biased as hell given that I'm a physics alum, but holy shit does UCSB need more difficult physics courses for engineers and other stem fields.  It's a complete joke how little people actually understand when they move on from the 6 or 1-5 series.  Students often try and take it on by memorizing the textbook or plugnchugging equation sheets, completely oblivious to the notion of understanding the basic principles and constructing logical arguments for themselves.  Yeah, it's hard.  But if you're pursuing science, it's fucking important.  You're going to need to know it.    Don't be one of those biology grads who memorize cute little stories for each concept they learn.  Focus on general knowledge that you can apply to new scenarios."
UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,feldspathoid,2,Mon May 4 05:55:25 2015 UTC,I know people who've had him fro the 1-4 series. They had similar experiences but in the end I've heard he curves it so much that your 50 pct will be a B.

It wasn't that hard, you just had to have a working understanding of the material and a good grasp on the homework. His tests are considerably easier than the tests one of the professors last quarter gave out, so consider yourself lucky. Just go through his slides and memorize definitions/conceptual things and do the reasonable sapling problems. He teases bio majors frequently because he knows that they generally suck at physics and treat it as a chore. He's not nearly as bad as you're describing tbh."
UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,Caglow,1 point,Mon May 4 05:31:27 2015 UTC,"I'm in this class. Most people hate him.   The worst part of this whole ordeal is on the first day of class he told us we have one midterm worth 25% of our grade, it still even says just one midterm in our syllabus even.  Now all the sudden we have multiple midterms, and when someone raised their hand and asked exactly how many we would have and when they would be he told us not to worry about it.   The midterm was mostly inline with the textbook and homework, just way more conceptual than 6A. Some of the questions were kind of tricky, and required very precise definitions of words.   I got a 60% on the 6B midterm, 75% and 80% on the two 6A midterms."
UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,feldspathoid,2,Wed May 6 23:08:32 2015 UTC,Hate to be the buzzkill but professors reserve the right to update their syllabus whenever they want.

UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,Caglow,2,Tue May 5 15:49:31 2015 UTC,"The syllabus is a general idea of what to expect for the course. There is no requirement for one, and if a professor does make one it is for the students' benefit and does not require acknowledgement, signature, or approval from the student. From what I've read on this thread, the professor added an exam with notice and notified the class about the change. I highly doubt it was added ""without legitimate reason,"" so it wouldn't be against what you have in bold."
UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,Project-MKULTRA,2,Tue May 5 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"Professors can update their syllabus verbally. It doesn't have to be written.

UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,Project-MKULTRA,2,Tue May 5 16:35:52 2015 UTC,"Syllabi are violated all the time though usually for pretty minor things like schedule changes. In this case, I would imagine that unless the grade percentages where specified and it's now changed, there may not be much of an argument. Otherwise, I can see an argument for getting the midterm % to be reduced to what it says on the syllabus.  Either way, it sounds like a talk with the professor should settle most of the concerns brought up. THEN (still in a timely manner), take it higher up if it doesn't work out. It's never a good idea to go on the offensive before you need to."

UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,Applegiraffe,2,Mon May 4 19:10:54 2015 UTC,He's the only 6b teacher this quarter. I've heard that his finals in the past have been worse than his midterms so I'm not sure if that would help.  edit: Removed his name.
UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,beetling,5,Mon May 4 21:07:15 2015 UTC,"I had him for Physics 2. I thought that guy was the nicest of the physics profs honestly.   He mocks biology majors/medical school hopefuls in class. He explains concepts using derivatives/multi-variable calculus in class when basic calculus knowledge is not a prerequisite for the class.   Maybe he thinks he's teaching an accelerated version of Physics 2? That could be a problem.  Also, he doesn't seem like kind of guy who would seriously mock bio majors. He even did a whole lecture about how non-physicists are valuable to society and about physics needs more diversity etc etc. Though ironically he did like to throw jokes out there, which if you're struggling, could really taken in the wrong way."
UCSantaBarbara,34s6yz,WantCookie,2,Tue May 5 20:10:51 2015 UTC,"I probably did misinterpret his comments. He may have been joking, but nobody was laughing.

UCSantaBarbara,34oc3i,thissickguy,2,Sun May 3 04:28:11 2015 UTC,"Gainer does expect his students to understand the material and be able to apply it. He does not just want people to regurgitate facts written in the book or on a lecture slide. I would say this sets him apart from other professors somewhat, but all in all he has pretty standard expectations/difficulty. Overall, I think he is a great prof 8.5/10."

UCSantaBarbara,34oc3i,Breathe_the_Stardust,2,Sun May 3 03:52:06 2015 UTC,"Gainer was not only the worst professor I encountered in my entire time at UCSB, but also one of the few people in my life that I can honestly say had a purely negative impact on it.  His lectures are a monotonous wash of him running through problems as if he's practicing them for himself as opposed to explaining then to others.  And his expectations and grading systems are completely asinine.   In 109B, we once had a midterm where the average grade after the curve came out to a low D (I think it was something like 35%). The next morning he came in and lectured everyone about how we were obviously not trying hard enough and he was really disappointed in us... took absolutely zero personal responsibility for it."

UCSantaBarbara,34ltj8,capnbossman,3,Sat May 2 08:30:45 2015 UTC,Santa Cruz is the best of the chi-5!
UCSantaBarbara,34ltj8,jsand25,4,Sat May 2 11:27:51 2015 UTC,Anacapa gave me a great freshmen year.
UCSantaBarbara,34ltj8,tundoopani,1 point,Sat May 2 15:48:58 2015 UTC,Me too :)
UCSantaBarbara,34ltj8,sdraz,6,Sun May 3 03:43:08 2015 UTC,"Current RA here. Here's brief rundown for next year. I'll separate it by area:  San Cat: Made up of two towers, south and north. Each tower is 8 or 9 stories. There will be construction, and no parking; but all the rooms are going to be doubles, which is cool. I lived there my first year and loved it. Portola is the best, don't believe the lies. You'll end up biking a lot or bussing a lot if you live here. The bike ride isn't that bad, and it keeps you fit. The rooms are suite style, so you'll have a two rooms connected by a bathroom. And given that it's only 2 people to a room, sharing a bathroom with 4 people is super chill.   Chi 5: Only Freshmen live here and it's made up of 5 residence halls. Majoriy of the rooms will be triples. You'll probably eat at DLG or Ortega a lot. I dig Ortega, DLG is whatevs.    Anacapa: Shaped like a swastika, divided in the middle. Currently one side houses the scholar floor upstairs which is divided in the center by gender. The lower floor is non themed, separated by gender similarly. The other side houses the API (Asian and Pacific Islander) floor upstairs, and the lower floor is non themed. These are both separated by gender in the middle too. The gender separation is pretty much negligible though, as you're all technically on the same floor anyway, just different sides. Each floor has two bathrooms, a male one on the male side and a female one on the female side.  Santa Cruz: Probably similar to Anacapa, with different themed floors. Bathrooms similar to Anacapa I think.  Santa Rosa: Shaped like a really long snake. No gender separation. Has some themed floors, not sure which ones. Bathroom situation similar to Anacapa.  San Nic: Houses the students from the Freshman Summer Start Program(FSSP). Unless you do FSSP, I would recommend not choosing this as a top choice because (1) it will be hard to get because it will be mostly full already, and (2) everyone in San Nic will have already formed their friend groups if you do get put there. San Miguel: Tbh, I don't know too much about San Miguel. Sounds like the floors are single gender, which I think is less fun. I do know that there are more single rooms here though. So if you really want a single room, you can try to get put here.    Far Side: This area mainly houses second and third year students, but some freshmen do live here. You'll eat at Carillo a lot, it's cool at first (brick pizza oven, pasta a lot) but I got tired of it fast. It's v carby, ""pizza, pasta, and potatoes"" is how my friends and I would describe it. Though I think a lot of first years in the Chi 5 tend to like it.    Manzanita: This is a ""village"" composed of 17 different houses. Some of the houses have themes, such as the Continuing Scholars House . Some are non themed. If you get a top floor room the ceilings are p high, which is neat. Single bathrooms, of which there are like 4 or 5 on each floor.   San Raf: I'm actually not sure if any freshmen live here at all...But I'll give the information anyway. It's made up of a tower and 2 clusters. A lot of it is suite style, so you'll have like a living room, bathroom, and several rooms in one suite. It's pretty cool  if you have a group of friends to live with.    I personally think San Cat is the best choice. I loved living there and made so many friends. Portola is bomb dot com. The construction will be kinda lame, but I think current residents have said it's not that bad.   Regardless of where you get put though, you'll have a good time if you make the most of it. I'm sure if I had lived anywhere else my first year, I'd be recommending that res hall to you. So go where you think you'll like the best. Also consider applying for a themed floor (formally known as LLC's or Living Learning Communities). They're nice because you'll be living with people who already have a similar interest, and so it will be that much easier making friends!  EDIT: Yes, I am part of the minority opinion that Portola is good. But when they're on, they're ON."

And for the bike ride, some of my friends hate it, some don't mind. Regardless it is a major inconvenience forcing either to rely on the bus system or to bike some ways away to get on campus.

Santa Cruz is close to Campus Point by a few yards and that's really the only difference.   And don't really worry about ""social"" dorms and whatnot. There's literally nothing you can really do about that. One dorm might be more social than another because of the people who are in it, not because it's that dorm. One dorm may seem more social because more social people may happen to live in that dorm that year.   And don't worry about San Nic. True, a lot of people have formed friend groups, but a lot of people have not! A lot of people move in/out of San Nic after FSSP, so don't worry about trying to join a hostile environment."

It also has a movie theatre that is available to all residents, where you can borrow movies from the front desk or attach a laptop or an Xbox with an HDMI cable. Santa Cruz is also right next to DLG, the best dining commons on campus (not that Anacapa is much farther!) Santa Cruz is also closest to Campus Point, the most beautiful beach on campus (that is why I chose it.) Anacapa is slightly closer to campus; if you're riding your bike back to Santa Cruz, you always pass Anacapa. But beyond that, it really doesn't have any advantages.

Downsides: Your room will be claustrophobic, hot, and dark. You'll get to listen to people screaming on the sporty thing outside at all hours, all day. You will likely live with people who haven't discovered the idea of cleaning up their messes yet. You'll live with three dudes and 3,500 ants.

UCSantaBarbara,34e5hs,capnbossman,7,Thu Apr 30 15:08:08 2015 UTC,I live in the freshman dorms right now and there is an exchange student on our hall who is older than all of us (we are all 18-19 and he is probably 22) but we all get along really well with him and hang out with him regardless.

UCSantaBarbara,34e5hs,drewadrawing,6,Thu Apr 30 16:58:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly in a college setting it's really hard to distinguish between people's ages, and no one makes too much of an effort to do so. People at UCSB are pretty friendly.  Welcome! :)"
UCSantaBarbara,34e5hs,jgthespy,5,Thu Apr 30 23:42:40 2015 UTC,"The worst part is only ever being around people in a different universe of maturity than you.  My favorite thing about going to office hours is that I actually get to talk to an adult for a few minutes.  It's not like CC where there are a whole lot of working adults taking classes.  Other than that, it's no big deal.  No one is going to know how old you are and they're all really bad at guessing.  I usually get 22-23 which is 10 years off.  Like someone else said, you'll have a lot more school work to do and it's going to be a lot harder.  Unless you accidentally end up studying with a drama junkie, maturity isn't even really a thing when it comes to school work.  Everyone is in the same boat regardless of age."

The fact is that you're about to go through some of the hardest classes, longest hours, and most ridiculous psets of your life and of your peers lives. It seemed to me that nobody made any distinction over age, transfer status, or anything else except ""is this person going through the same shit I am and do they know the answer to problem 3"".

I get along okay with younger students, though this experience definitely accelerated my feelings of the ""late 20s crisis."" You probably will get along with your grad student TAs better than some of your classmates. It also depends on your major. My department (Earth Sci) is definitely a bit older on average.   Also, the Non-traditional student center is mostly geared towards student parents. I didn't find much there for me, but maybe you might find people to mesh with.   Tl;dr: Yes you will feel old but don't worry about it. :)"
UCSantaBarbara,34e5hs,OBEYthesky,1 point,Sat May 2 20:54:50 2015 UTC,Sounds as though you are looking for dorm type of arrangements. I'd recommend you consult with the student housing (don't know what the formal name is) office to try to get in to a facility that is geared to older students. There's a huge difference in maturity level and general outlook of a 27 year old compared with an 18 year old who's away from their parents for the first time. If you end up in a dorm with incoming freshmen I predict you will be hating life immediately. Good luck to you.
UCSantaBarbara,34e5hs,Nekona,2,Thu Apr 30 22:01:01 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at the transfer community at San Rafael, which at least means 20 year olds who are away from their parents for the first time, but I'm kind of thinking I'm going to end up feeling like the scoutmaster no matter what I do."

UCSantaBarbara,34cwnq,Tweeblee,2,Thu Apr 30 03:25:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely take it if you think you can keep up academically. If Aue is teaching in fall you might get a little demotivated because well, he's a little boring and not quite as good as Lipshutz. If you can make it through 109A, even if you don't particularly like it, I definitely recommend it. If Bruce Lipshutz takes over again in winter quarter (109B) like he did this year, its amazing.  Lipshutz is really helpful and an amazing professor. He assigns his grad students and even some times post-docs to groups of students in the class so you can study with them. His lectures and tests are straight forward and well explained and he always has review sessions before tests. Like JDBizzle mentioned, the class is a lot smaller so you can get a lot more individual attention. In terms of grades, the class is HEAVILY curved because you're competing with basically the top 50 or so students. I think something like 50% of the class gets A's.   From what I've heard, a lot of regular Ochem professors basically read directly from the book and most people don't even show up to lectures. In honors, I haven't opened the textbook once.   If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me."

AFter, with a mild crook in his back from stooping down to write the last portion of the 50 step mech, he'll turn around and give a toothy smile about how this mechanism makes some sort of drug....He'll then go on a colorful story about how that drug was used to treat cancer but some isomer of it was deadly, or how it was used as a date rape drug and was known as ""knockouts"" or something.   It's like an awesome, educational rambling of sorts from a wizard. I wish I could learn all of chemistry from him."
UCSantaBarbara,34cwnq,piggychuu,1 point,Wed May 13 09:57:44 2015 UTC,He taught us how to make Ether from plastic handle vodka one time. I knew I was in the right place right then and there!
UCSantaBarbara,34cwnq,poddan,1 point,Wed May 13 18:26:08 2015 UTC,"Oh he definitely is more quirky, but I'm not sure it was in a good way for me haha. I just thought he was kind of monotone and was really focused on all his ""calculations"" with numbers and things."
UCSantaBarbara,34cwnq,Grignardpls,1 point,Sat May 2 04:53:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! Are exams for Aue/Lipshutz pretty straightforward? If I were to do book problems and such, would it be enough to do well in the class? Or do they like to throw in ""adventure problems"" like Kunkel, if you're familiar with her. This makes me excited! I think I'm leaning towards taking it :) From what I hear from others, if you just keep up with the work then it should be a doable class."
UCSantaBarbara,34cwnq,Grignardpls,2,Sat May 2 07:28:30 2015 UTC,"I would say Lipshutz's exams are really straight forward. Very occasionally he'll throw in very small ""tricks"" but will even say in the problem that it is tricky. Aue's tests were always pretty straightforward but I didn't do as well on them as on Lipshutz's because Aue never really made the subject too interesting for me so it didn't stick with me well.   Remember that this course is difficult at times and do not be surprised if at some point you even get a 40% on an exam. We've had two exams this year where the average has been around a 50%. Don't worry about it, just make sure you keep studying and go to the review sessions. If you think its necessary, talk to Lipshutz personally and he will do whatever he can to help you."

UCSantaBarbara,34cwnq,JDBizzle,1 point,Fri May 15 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"I would recommend taking it. It's definitely tough, especially because you're grade will be curved depending on the other honor students (I think only the top 10% from gen chem get invited, not everyone); although, it might be curved a little higher (depending on the teacher) and several students slack off once they're in and just try to pass (I managed to somehow get an A,A, and A+ and I felt like everyone there was way smarter than me). The real advantage is that there will probably be only about 40 students (and even less the third quarter) compared to the however many hundred there are in the regular sessions. This means it's a great learning environment (don't have to worry about asking questions in a packed auditorium) and a good opportunity to build a repertoire with some great teachers. Also a good way to knock out three upper division honors requirements if you're in the program."

CLAS drop-in is an awesome place to do homework, which is paramount to doing well. Its like sports, it's not that practice makes perfect.. mindlessly watching hours of khan academy isn't the best thing.. but rather perfect practice will make perfect.. actively working on hw with the focus on learning, not just getting the hw over with, in a constructive setting where you can talk to someone about concepts, is the best way to get better.  Thoren is a wonderful teacher btw, shame you got her when she was expecting.   Tbh you're lucky if you get a math teacher whos lectures you really enjoy, but the homework will be youe best barometer for what's expected of you on tests and stuff so that's where I say the focus should be.

Also, doing a big set of problems, starting out from ""I've got no idea to what I'm doing"" and leaving a few hours later with a ""I think I've got this"" attitude. I loved chatting with the tutors over the at the drop-in lab. Talking the steps and methodology over really helps you like nothing else I can think of.  Btw, you freakin rock for tutoring at CLAS.

I enjoyed almost all of my classes, lower and upper div, and the professors and TAs were excellent.    I think if there is any advantage in doing HPP over history, it would have to do with what you are considering after undergrad. I would go speak with Prof. Bergstrom about HPP and see if it is something you are interested in. Feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions."
UCSantaBarbara,3480dh,GOE32,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:17:38 2015 UTC,Umm I don't have any specific areas at the moment but what are some of the more interesting courses in the department?
UCSantaBarbara,3480dh,GOE32,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:01:58 2015 UTC,"I focused on US history, so my favorite courses were American Women's History (Hist 159B, 159C), Southern History (160B,C), History of California (Hist177), and History of the Present (Hist 5).   One of my favorite classes of all time was History of Science and Religion with Prof. Keel. Blew my mind.   Outside of US, I really enjoyed History 2B and 2C (world history 1000-1700, 1700-present)."
UCSantaBarbara,3480dh,gwenzx,3,Thu Apr 30 04:41:03 2015 UTC,"Also biased, as a double major in history! I'm currently taking my lower divs in history, and all my TAs and professors have been fantastic. Quite a bit of reading, as you can expect, but I think this is a wonderful department. We offer a class labeled ""History 9"" every quarter just for freshman/sophomore history majors to get a feel of what research and seminar discussion is like at the upper div level. The class material varies from quarter to quarter - I'm taking it currently and it's focused on Ronald Reagan and his foreign policy. Last quarter, I believe it was on feudal Japan. I strongly suggest checking out the history department website to get a feel for the classes!  I have a friend in HPP and from what I've seen, a lot of people choose that major to go into a pre-law track. As /u/GOE32 said, it's all really about what you plan to do with your degree. HPP may have more degree requirements than history does, and it's strongly recommended that you take a foreign language or internship when completing that major."

If that's too out of the way for you I would definitely suggest Cafe' Bustelo.

Just pour a little into a cup and give it a taste, they won't mind if you just want to get a sense for the flavors.  If you find something you like you might as well chill out with a cup, the shop is beautiful and a great place to unwind!

Leave your bike there and head West past Naples and all the way to El Capitan. That part of the coast feels incredibly remote.  If you like the hills then Farren Road is really quiet and a good workout although its out and back (Hollister west, over freeway at Cathedral oaks to Calle Real to Farren Road).  For longer loops Cathedral Oaks is very useful and you can use the bikepath along Maria Ygnacio creek (by Ribera drive) to connect with the Atascadero bike path without major road crossings (it passes under the freeway and Hollister).  To add variety to Ellwood bluffs throw in loops through Coal Oil Point Reserve pond trail and also you can cut through the Devereaux property. You can enter right at the Coal Oil point gate and also on the IV side by the West Campus Faculty housing. If no-one has made a zombie movie there yet they should..."

From San Clemente I go for around 7 miles one way and then double back for a 14 mile (you can totally extend this by going further) ride. I've seen joggers/walkers on the bike path. But there seems to be some parts of the route with pedestrian paths along it.  Just watch out for the horses/horse dung :P

I would say Santa Rosa and San Nic/ San Mig are closest to the Ucen, if that makes any difference. Anacapa and Santa Cruz and Manzanita are closer to the beach. By cultures, I'm going to assume you mean themed floors. Some buildings have themed floors (like multicultural, scholars, etc.) you should research ahead of time to see if you're interested in any of those living communities.  For FSSP, you will stay in San Nic. After, you have the option of moving out to another building if you want. It's actually not uncommon for people to move out, but the majority of people stay. Just talk to your RA and as about the process.  Just take any classes during FSSP. You'll probably end up taking GE's anyways. You're going to be faced with large lecture halls regardless in the school year. Any class you choose will be a little more easier than when you take it in the school year. The teachers are more chill and some of the teachers aren't the regular teachers for the school year, hence some classes might be easier. You'll probably take 9 units. (Two 4 unit classes and one required 1 unit class.) You can take some freshman seminars that fill up SUPER fast during the regular school year."

But its funny because myself and the rest of my company (4 other people) were sitting there trying to figure out how to solve a problem.  Everyone else from MIT and me from UCSB.  We all sat there as it boiled down to a statistics problem. Finally after everyone staring at the whiteboard for a few minutes as we all knew what it was, our boss said, ""so did anyone take stats in school?""

A lot of my friends are down to go downtown to shop or for some better/different food (Zaytoon, Palazzio, etc.).   I've been interning somewhere downtown for almost the last two years, so I'm very appreciative of the 24x. That's something else that people probably don't take into consideration -- downtown SB has a lot of career and internship opportunities that UCSB and Goleta might not be able to offer.   I wouldn't say that downtown SB is super amazing or super intriguing. State Street reminds me of Old Town Pasadena, if you're from the LA area.

UCSantaBarbara,33z6g7,blandfruitsalad,5,Mon Apr 27 05:07:07 2015 UTC,"Just a warning: if you're planning to do a lot of recreational activities outside of the IV area, you're probably going to need a car. Hopefully, at least for your freshman year, you have a decent time at UCSB itself. I don't think partying is nearly as prolific here as some people will have you believe, and it's calmed down noticeably since all of last year's events. If you want to party, you can. If you don't want to, you won't have a hard time finding people who feel the same way. (I don't ""party"" in the stereotypical UCSB sense, and I'm still having a great time here.)   I've done the Tangerine Falls hike before. Pretty good hike, except the ""waterfall"" at the end is probably even more depressing than I remember it: http://www.hikespeak.com/trails/tangerine-falls-in-the-los-padres-national-forest/  I haven't done any camping around here, so I'm sure someone that's more informed can chime in on that. Regarding a city to explore... downtown Santa Barbara has a lot to offer! You've got the courthouse, some good food, the art museum...   If you want something a little more novel, I've seen that a lot of my friends have gone to Solvang. I haven't been myself, so I can't speak too much about that. But the photos look neat!"
UCSantaBarbara,33z6g7,blandfruitsalad,2,Mon Apr 27 05:21:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help! Just as a side question, as someone who doesn't party a whole lot, what do you personally do for entertainment and all?"
UCSantaBarbara,33z6g7,catsxmaru,4,Mon Apr 27 05:29:14 2015 UTC,"No prob! I'm part of Epic, which is a Christian group on campus, so most of my friends don't really ""party"" either, which makes it easier. Joining any sort of group or organization helps a lot with just giving you people to hang out with. Going along with that, I think one of the best parts about college and having so many of your best friends in close proximity is that you can just go over to someone's apartment and hang out for no real reason. For example: on Friday after work, I stopped by a friend's apartment to say hi. Ended up staying for four hours. Watched the NBA playoffs. Cooked dinner at their place. Had a really great time, but it doesn't fit neatly into an entertainment category, haha."

UCSantaBarbara,33z6g7,sundowntg,4,Mon Apr 27 07:01:44 2015 UTC,"There's quite a few hiking spots in the area if you can drive or carpool. Los Padres National Forest isn't too far away which has Lake Cachuma where you can camp at and other hiking trails. If you go north of UCSB a bit there's Refugio State Beach, where you can also camp, and Gaviota State Park which has some great hiking trails. If you're into fishing there's countless spots up and down the coast (except for IV since it's a preserve). You don't always have to party to have fun, there's still plenty to do if you're willing to venture out a bit. I would highly recommend looking into UCSB's Excursion Club which a is focused on outdoor activities."

There's some party buses that go and of course you'll find people who know spots, but it seems to be pretty evenly split, if not more skewed towards staying in IV from what I've seen.  The city bus lines stop pretty early relative to other cities too, so it's a lot easier if you have a car."

UCSantaBarbara,33z6g7,TheSanctified,2,Mon Apr 27 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"If you're a strong enough biker than you probably can, I've seen people biking along the roads, but it depends on why you want to go downtown and how late you'd be out.  I wouldn't recommend biking at night for such a long distance for anyone.  I've only gone once, but there's a bus service or two that have old city buses/charter buses that take large groups downtown to clubs.  You pay like $15 for the bus ride there and back plus a bracelet that gets free admittance to the club/lounge and sometimes discounts on drinks or whatever.  For non-partying in downtown like I said a lot of things close pretty early, including restaurants and shops, so there's not much to do after like 10PM-ish.  But again it depends on why you're going and what time."
UCSantaBarbara,33z6g7,catsxmaru,4,Mon Apr 27 01:31:55 2015 UTC,"Not that often unfortunately. It's kinda sad actually, I've met like 10 people who don't even know what Patterson Ave is, and that's right off the 217 next to the university. Most of the people who hang around Downtown SB are tourists, locals, and SBCC students, rarely UCSB students.  That said, I'm everyone has explored Downtown at least once. The 24X makes it really convenient."

UCSantaBarbara,33zw62,dreasurvive,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:38:09 2015 UTC,"I was wondering what the grade distribution is like at the school, especially for science classes?   I would assume this would answer that question:  https://www.myedu.com/course-grades/   How engaging are the teachers, do they seem to genuinely like to teach students or are there to just do research?   When it comes to biochem faculty, Shea, Plaxco, and Kahn are the most engaging ones that come to mind.  I think Buratto and De Vries were pretty good too, but my memory is a little fuzzier when it comes to my experience with those two.  There were maybe only 2 professors I can think of from the chem department that I truly disliked, but I'll let ratemyprofessors inform you on that.   How easy is it to get a research opportunity within your first year at UCSB?   If you are in CCS Chem and/or in the honors program taking the 2-series intro chem (if they still offer it), you probably have a decent shot.   How much more competitive/ difficult the honors program is than the regular classes?   I didn't wind up taking any of the honors intro chem or o-chem courses, so I honestly don't know.   What are the minimum number of honor classes you have to take in one quarter?   http://www.duels.ucsb.edu/honors/staying   How many people are in the avg honors class?   ~40-50 for intro chem honors class and roughly the same amount for the honors O-chem class.    If you could do it over again would you have joined the honors program, why/ why not?   I liked the early registration perk, but it becomes somewhat pointless after year 2.   If you want to have a social/ fun time would you not recommend the honors hall?   Never been   What opportunities do students interested in pre-dental at this school get?   No idea.  My advice would be to pick a different major though.  Chem-biochem is a real grind and more suited towards those who are interested in a career in research.   Are there any stats for the pre-med/pre-dental acceptances?   I don't have any hard numbers here, but I do know of a number of UCSB undergrads who got accepted into highly prestigious medical schools (eg. UCLA).   What made you choose UCSB?   For me it was between UCSB, UCI, and UW.  I picked UCSB because it seemed to have the best overall vibe of all three.  If you are someone who would like a well-rounded college lifestyle, it's certainly the place to be."

Dr. Kahn's lab series is the most intense experience he will ever have. For a whole year he will sacrifice all to live and breathe biochemistry. Dr. Kahn will push you to your limit and then some.   Not joking or exaggerating. It is the most challenging year I have ever had, and I've aced both of the two prior quarters and am looking to ace this quarter - additionally have a 3.82 average GPA. Biochem through chem is not for those who think biochem is just a cool major. You have to love it or you will fail.  You come out as a real goddamn scientist with real goddamn skills though."

UCSantaBarbara,33yle0,smistguitar97,4,Sun Apr 26 21:36:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you put FT as #1, you will get it because not THAT many people actually want to put that as #1 so you should be fine! Anyways, FT sort of has its own community with the pool, recreation rooms, study rooms, and the dining common (which many people say is horrible but you get used to it). I feel like FT gives the real college experience."
UCSantaBarbara,33yle0,nymets500,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:15:17 2015 UTC,"FT is awesome. About half of freshmen live there, and way less than half put it as their #1 preference... so those that do, are basically guaranteed to live there.  As for your roommate, it's probably a 99% chance you'll be together. Whether it's you two in a double, or you two with a random third roommate is completely random."

Don't put the same preference for all 7 choices...the computer looks at your first choice and assigns it to you, if it's not available then it just goes down the list of your preferences.

UCSantaBarbara,33yle0,Vitate,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:41:37 2015 UTC,"I am writing you as a freshman currently sitting in my dorm room in FT.  First, you'll hear a lot of people say that the dining commons, Portola, is shit. While it has its shitty days (so does every other dining commons), it is honestly pretty decent most of the time. One of the things I like the most about it is how varied the food offerings are compared to some of the other dining commons. I came here a picky eater and I have been doing just fine eating at Portola all year. You can usually find SOMETHING to eat, and even if you can't, there's always cereal or one of the many delivery food places in IV (peep SBmenus.com). There is also plenty of opportunity to eat at the 3 other dining commons on campus between classes or if you're feeling adventurous and don't want to stay at home for dinner.  Second, it's really easy to meet people here, especially at the beginning of the year. There are 10 floors full of people in each tower, and I've made friends on just about every one by virtue of living here and expanding my friend network from the ones I met on my floor and in Portola.  Third, you'll love the suites. It's amazing having your own bathroom and sink without having to leave the room. I happen to have made very good friends with the people in the suite connected to my room, so if you luck out with cool suitemates, you'll have a great time. If you enjoy smoking weed, it's perfectly safe to smoke it in the bathroom without worrying that you'll get caught by an RA or something.   Then you have the study rooms, pools, and south tower game room,which are all as awesome as you let them be. During midterms and finals, the study rooms are invaluable if you enjoy a quiet place to study away from the distractions in your room. And if you love swimming like I do, having a pool on the grounds is a pretty awesome perk, considering it's warm enough to use it pretty much year round here. The game rooms have a bunch of seating, which can be cool to play something on the TV or to hang out with friends and play board games. If you're into pool, the 3 pool tables are great, and if not, there is air hockey and ping pong.  As for getting to class, you have two options: biking or bussing. The bike ride to the science or engineering buildings will be about 10-15 minutes depending on how fast you ride, but for classes on the side of campus closest to FT, you should have no problem making it there in 10 minutes or less. The bus system here is pretty cool, because the bus stop across the street (NOT RIGHT IN FRONT) will take you to campus in around 10 minutes and it comes every 5-15 minutes during the day.  As for going to the beach or IV, you're not much farther than the kids on campus. Going to the beach on Del Playa (DP) is about a 15 minute walk or a 5 minute bike ride, and I happen to like the beaches you can access from DP better than the ones on campus.   In closing, living in FT can be an incredible experience. You live in your own freshman oasis with very easy access to everything else IV and campus has to offer. You'll have the superior suite system instead of having to deal with communal bathrooms. Almost all the floors have lounges, which are a great way to socialize with those on your floor; just be sure to go out of your way to make friends with good people (especially those in your suite and on your floor) and you'll have a great time living in FT.  If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask them here!"
UCSantaBarbara,33yaeo,extraquestial,5,Sun Apr 26 20:07:49 2015 UTC,You can bring tupperware and put some food in those. But bring a backpack because they will question you if they see you with it. And yes they do allow backpacks at the UCSB dining halls

You're allowed out a piece of fruit or dessert. I've gotten away with walking out the door with three slices of carrot cake in one hand. Just don't draw attention to yourself.  Also, you can get unlimited swipes and go to Ortega. Ortega has ""take out"" which means you shove as much food as you can into a take out box. It's meant for those who don't have time to eat breakfast/ lunch in the dining commons. You can eat one meal inside the dining commons, leave, swipe in and get take-out.  Also, there's late night at DLG. They serve food from 9pm to 12 am or something. Usually burgers or munchies."

UCSantaBarbara,33soes,Fluffaykitties,3,Sat Apr 25 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"I did arth series. I'd recommend it. It can feel frustrating/useless at times but overall Its pretty important to understand human culture and important art works. You also learn learn a lot of history incidentally. The classes are basically all structured the same. 2 or 3 five page essays and a midterm and final. The essays are just image comparisons. The tests are memorization of random art works. Lecture isn't needed, it is just raw memorization."
UCSantaBarbara,33soes,-buz,2,Sat Apr 25 06:31:25 2015 UTC,As did I.  I actually use a lot of what I saw in Art History when I traveled in Europe for Education Abroad and after I graduated.  It was probably one of my more favorite classes.  The classes aren't that hard as long as you go to section.  I always had my TA look over my papers prior to me turning them in.
UCSantaBarbara,33soes,Shwap,3,Sat Apr 25 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"I personally took the history 17 series. I really liked it, history in college is nothing like history in high school, and it really wasn't that difficult and each one fills a writing requirement. The TA I had was the best TA I've ever had though so that probably makes a difference."
UCSantaBarbara,33soes,MC_Kreeper,2,Sat Apr 25 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"The classes in the ARTHI6 Series truly are the super G.E.s for engineers and i recommend them to all.  3 classes from the ARTHI6 series (consisting of one class from a-c and two classes from d-k) clears -The depth requirement -European Traditions Requirement -3 writing classes -1 D&E course -2 F&G course    Then just choose 1 course that simultaneously fills writingrequirement & ethnicity requirement & D&E. There are a fair amount classes that achieve this, and you can check with myedu and ratemyprofessor to see what class might be the easiest. I recommend RG 14 which is usually in the fall.  Those 4 classes fill every requirement besides the ""6 classes from d,e,f,g,h areas"" thing which hopefully you'd have a couple course AP/IB credits but if not you could just take another couple easy courses with no restrictions.  There are other ways of completing all the requirements in only 4 classes but ARTHI6 series  + a writing ethnicity course is the best way to go IMO because it has the best flexibility and the classes aren't super difficult especially if you cherry pick specific courses and teachers within the series. You can check myedu and ratemyprofessor to gain a general idea of which courses these are."

UCSantaBarbara,33ow18,bluescholar1,4,Fri Apr 24 17:32:39 2015 UTC,"That's difficult. Find a friend, and if possible, have it stored inside the house or at least in the back yard.   So there's an underground industry of bike theft in IV (along with the grey market of curb-side furniture pickups). During school breaks, windowless vans patrol IV and swoop on any bikes that appear abandoned, unlocked, or easily taken. 90% of the thefts of bikes in IV I hear when my friends get back from vacations."
UCSantaBarbara,33ow18,AlexanderTheLess,-3,Fri Apr 24 18:41:17 2015 UTC,Maybe by the library. Unless it's a nice bike. Maybe ask a co-op for a spot.
UCSantaBarbara,33ow18,MrUppercut,11,Fri Apr 24 09:54:26 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend leaving it on campus over the summer. The bike may be tagged as abandoned and it will eventually get impounded. CSO allows you to leave your bike with them during the summer for a small fee too.
UCSantaBarbara,33ow18,houseofballoons28,-7,Fri Apr 24 15:30:32 2015 UTC,Honestly just find an apartment complex that has a outdoor bike rack that is somewhat hidden from the road. A lot have them
UCSantaBarbara,33mj0s,feartrich,33,Thu Apr 23 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"I never understood why the school promotes ""Just vote! It only takes a couple minutes!"" If you don't know anything about the issues/candidates, you should not vote unless you take the time to research them. Then it takes longer than 5 minutes.   This is the same with US elections. You could ask half of the people voting for president random simple trivia on the candidate they are voting for and they would get it wrong. People don't understand that voting while uninformed hurts the process as a whole."
UCSantaBarbara,33mj0s,SixthSnail,0,Thu Apr 23 19:06:29 2015 UTC,"You are correct, they do encourage everyone to vote regardless of their education or experience.   Would you want voters to take a test before voting?"
UCSantaBarbara,33mj0s,recursionsturgeon,0,Fri Apr 24 16:13:35 2015 UTC,I didn't say anything about education. We all go to the same school. I just don't think you should vote if you don't even know what you are voting for.
UCSantaBarbara,33mj0s,SixthSnail,12,Wed Apr 29 06:04:43 2015 UTC,Don't they need a certain % of the students to vote in order for it to count?
UCSantaBarbara,33mj0s,Squeakopotamus,5,Thu Apr 23 20:17:44 2015 UTC,"Sorta relevant: I voted the other day (abstained on everything but fees and President), and received an Election Receipt via email.

UCSantaBarbara,33mj0s,editedit88,3,Thu Apr 23 20:45:46 2015 UTC,I saw that they are having issues with the receipts. They said that your vote was registered correctly but that the receipt was generated incorrectly. You can't be certain though!

Judging by most of their majors they probably just realized they can't do much in their field and came to the conclusion that they better have something that looks like they did something of importance
UCSantaBarbara,33mj0s,nineninetyfive,7,Fri Apr 24 00:41:36 2015 UTC,I have the exact same feeling.

UCSantaBarbara,33qdj6,PaulaShin,6,Fri Apr 24 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah that question structure... not the best way to get a response.   Anyway, I'm not a film student but I've taken the class on Hollywood Industry (FAMST 54). Every week someone in the industry drives up from LA and talks about their work, their process, and their progress. The professor and her husband wrote for Cheers (among other things) and she manages to get some very important people in to speak to us. We've heard from the costume department, casting managers, the VP of animation at DreamWorks, directors, producers, screenwriters, execs from TV networks, etc. I thought that was pretty cool, dunno how SFSU stacks up.   As mentioned, UCs are research schools so they are more theory focused. Regardless, UCSB has pumped out some very successful alumni. Off the top of my head: Michael Douglas, Michael Westmore (costume/makeup design for Star Trek), Don Hertzfeldt (Rejected). I know a few people in the major and they have worked on film projects for classes, so they DO learn how to compose and produce. Also, check out the Carsey-Wolf Center."
UCSantaBarbara,33qdj6,fghky,7,Fri Apr 24 18:53:53 2015 UTC,UC's tend to be more theory focused.   Take with that what you will.

It wasn't required for almost any of the classes."
UCSantaBarbara,33qdj6,universe34,3,Fri Apr 24 20:24:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I recently talked to an alumna who had been a frustrated film major. She said it was hard to get access to equipment and opportunities for making films unless you had personal friendships/connections."
UCSantaBarbara,33qdj6,beetling,3,Fri Apr 24 22:26:55 2015 UTC,That concept applies to most of life - better to practice making connections than having everything available in school and disappear once graduated ;)
UCSantaBarbara,33qdj6,pirate_starbridge,6,Sun Apr 26 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend spending as little money as possible on a film degree. The degree doesn't matter that much, its all about portfolio and work."

CSU over a UC?  UCSB is lightyears better than SFSU.  When I was going to UCSB, Film and Media Studies was a difficult major to get into, and Im sure it's only gotten harder.  So I wouldn't say its bad by any means.  Almost all of my posts in this sub are praising UCSB, so I might be a little biased but deciding to go to UCSB was probably the best decision I ever made in my life."

It was a pretty fun class. The TA was awesome, and we got a lot of hands on. The lectures were not my thing, but focused on the culture. I didn't read at all and did pretty well. More focused on the lectures and hands-on experience. Overall, not a bad class. Turned me on to some cool music too."

UCSantaBarbara,33lwy5,passagenoises,5,Thu Apr 23 16:18:34 2015 UTC,"Cruisers are the bane of all other bikers here. In terms of getting around, a road bike should do you just fine, it's fast enough to where you can get anywhere quickly if you need to, and if you get one with different speeds then that can help you with hills/underpasses that can be difficult with a fixie. As for getting it stolen, invest in a strong U-lock (and if you are really serious about keeping it safe, a chain for the other tire). I have had no problems with just my U-lock, just be sure to lock both the frame and the wheel to the rack. Also if you can get your wheels (or seat) bolted on, do it. The ones with the latch that you just pull to open are more likely to get stolen."
UCSantaBarbara,33lwy5,Tsurutops,3,Thu Apr 23 16:57:29 2015 UTC,"As for bikes getting stolen, just get a good U-lock. Always try to lock a wheel and your frame to the bike rack. Don't get something super shiny and new looking. (A lot of people ""dirty"" their bikes.) Don't get something too expensive either because the salty ocean air will make it rust faster. Also, do NOT get any bike with ""quick release"" wheels."
UCSantaBarbara,33lwy5,catsxmaru,5,Thu Apr 23 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"Quick release axles are easily replaced with locking axles, no matter what hub is in use.  Just ask the guys at the shop to switch it out for you if the bike you do like has quick release.  /u/catsxmaru I didn't mean this directly for you, just anyone who reads this thread.  Definitely don't run quick release axles, but they're easily swappable if the bike you like has them."
UCSantaBarbara,33lwy5,OneFootOnTheGas,5,Fri Apr 24 01:18:12 2015 UTC,"Don't get a beach cruiser - annoying handlebars.  Don't get a fixie either - coasting is awesome, fixies are really only for hipsters and velodrome racers.   Maybe get a single speed if you're a bike dude, but you're probably not since you're asking this question.   Get a ""hybrid"", also known as a ""commuter bike"" - sturdy and enough grip to handle dirt paths, can still add baskets/panniers for hauling groceries and 30 racks. Get a cheap mountain bike - Handles well on dirt/slippery conditions, pretty tough, hard to mount baskets to. Get a cheap road bike - Get to class the fastest, hard to ride on dirt, hard to mount baskets to.    Of these three, Hybrid/Commuter bikes have the lowest likelihood of being targeted for theft. Spiffiness is your enemy for mountain or road bikes - if your bike looks too snazzy be sure to cover it in dirt / a can of cheap spray paint."
UCSantaBarbara,33lwy5,swrrga,4,Fri Apr 24 03:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a single-speed over a fixie.  Fixed gear bikes have a pretty high learning curve to begin with, and with how crowded the bike paths are, you don't want to be worried about just riding your bike.  A fully geared roadbike is overkill unless you want to go on rides up into the mountains.  Everything besides the mountains around here is dead flat."

Keep a 3.7ish or higher in your math and physics classes and take one or two engineering classes, talk to the undergraduate adviser in whatever field of engineering you want to go into. I however believe that our physics department is amazing and now I've decided to stay in physics because I love the field. Also you might say to yourself that it will be easy to keep a 3.7, but it is really hard in physics classes to get an A. They are highly difficult classes and I have felt lucky getting a B- and B+ in physics 20 and 21. But good luck."

Now its not impossible to switch in, but it ain't easy either. You need to keep up a really good GPA and even with that it may be no guarantee, it also depends on which engineering you want to switch into since more people want to do certain engineering disciplines than others. If you any more questions feel free to ask, I'm a first year ME."
UCSantaBarbara,33lnuu,white_Steve_Nash,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:56:44 2015 UTC,"So as far as I know, you can only switch in when someone drops out. Considering engineering has a high-ish dropout rate (since its pretty hard), there are always spots. What makes it hard is our engineering department is extremely small, somewhere around 300 engineers per class. So there are limited spots and you are competing with all the other people who wanna switch in."
UCSantaBarbara,33lnuu,white_Steve_Nash,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"No problemo, and it varies from year to year since some people may drop out of a certain discipline depending on the year. But it seems like most people I talk to that want to switch in either want to switch into mechanical engineering or comp sci, so I would assume those are probably harder than the rest. As far as which one is easier, maybe EE? not a lot of people wanna take that many physics courses aha. EE requires the most physics out of the engineering disciplines."

About 25 days later (2 May 2014), I got the email that I have successfully switched into chemical engineering. I was so happy! Yes, it is possible to switch.

The Naan Stop and Eclectic IV (Angry Wings/Otaco) renovations are...not particularly inspiring, but not terrible. Woodstock's/Little Asia (Super Cucas)/Javan's (Aladdin Cafe) got hit with the ugly stick though, and the renovation even removed a nice mural from the 80s, which is frustrating.

He decided that we were all probably stressed out from all our other finals that he cancelled our final. If you show up, you'll get an A. MWF. You just exercise and it's not like you have to meet a certain standard for running/swimming/push ups, as long as you try to improve. You learn a bit of material and have a quiz or 2, but they're super easy and it's just a bit of common sense stuff. 2 unit class."

UCSantaBarbara,33g00y,feralrage,6,Wed Apr 22 08:20:32 2015 UTC,That link has at least two places from a quick glance that I can see that are not open anymore (Angry Wings and Javan's). I graduated in 2010 so maybe someone who is more current with the places that serve alcohol can give a better list of what constitutes the loop these days.
UCSantaBarbara,33g00y,HeadingtoFall,3,Wed Apr 22 15:22:02 2015 UTC,This is why I posted a new one. I saw that link but I was hoping for an updated list.
UCSantaBarbara,33g00y,feralrage,5,Wed Apr 22 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"Just editing that list with my knowledge of what's changed. I can't verify all these places personally, though most are definitely on there  Angry Wings otaco  South Coast Deli  Dublin's  Super Cuca's not sure about this one  Woodstock's  Pizza my Heart  El Sitio  Sorriso's   Gio's   Sam's  Study Hall  Kaptain's BBQ is on you, but probably counts as the same as study hall even if they let you drink in their half  Freebirds (I honestly didn't know they sold beer)  Javans Aladdin's  Deja vu  There's a few new places I haven't been inside like the other Mediterranean place, but I don't think they serve alcohol and a few on his list I kept cause they haven't changed but I'm pretty sure they don't do pitchers so they're out in my  opinion too"
UCSantaBarbara,33g00y,feralrage,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:15:52 2015 UTC,Is the loop just places with alcohol (so should IV deli and 7-11 be included) or just where you can consume it on the premises or where they serve pitchers? I think cuca's has bottled beer but no pitchers. I could be wrong on that though.

UCSantaBarbara,33g00y,calebthelee,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:03:45 2015 UTC,"From my understanding it's a pitcher at every place that sells pitchers, more if your group is large enough.  Even if it's not, you certainly have to be able to drink there because you must finish everything before going on to the next place.  Neither the deli or 7-11 serve alcohol anyway. The market, co-op, and all the liquor stores do."

UCSantaBarbara,33fn0z,universe34,3,Wed Apr 22 03:25:44 2015 UTC,Food is average. I started at 14 per week and went down to 10 because I was wasting mine and wanted to save money.   Some dorms have specific floors where international students can live together if they so choose.
UCSantaBarbara,33fn0z,bluescholar1,2,Wed Apr 22 03:30:51 2015 UTC,"The food at the dining commons has its days where it's pretty good, and days where sometimes the food isn't that great. But I always find something to eat just in case I don't like the food they're serving that day, like salads, toasts, cereal, etc. so it's not really a big deal. Most of the time the food is pretty good!"
UCSantaBarbara,33fn0z,catsxmaru,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:06:27 2015 UTC,"The food is what should be expected of any typical college dining commons food. They have their ups and downs, but after a while you stop caring. I started with 10, which is super nice so I'm not forced to constantly eat in the dining commons.  Weather is pleasant. The mornings are gloomy, but it quickly clears up. It can be really breezy/windy too so it definitely cools down the temperature. I think this winter, it never dipped under 50 (night time always and can drop lower.)  All residence halls are open to internationals. I know this year San Nic had a lot of internationals who opted to do FSSP. Otherwise, Manzanita usually houses upperclassmen and internationals."
UCSantaBarbara,33fn0z,djarchie,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:47:30 2015 UTC,"If you're an international student, your housing will depend in part on if you request ""break housing"" that allows you to stay at Thanksgiving, Winter, and Spring Break when everyone else needs to be out of the halls. That's one of the reasons they cluster students in Manzanita (which is AMAZING by the way)... Dining commons have a ton of options for food."

UCSantaBarbara,335y1m,Linkdown91,2,Mon Apr 20 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"I personally liked FT because I liked keeping a distance between ""school"" and ""home"" (Might just be me being weird though). I also liked having the bathroom connected directly to my room, and the fact that I was slightly closer to camino real market place (I liked going to the movies a lot).  My only complaints were being so far away from campus during finals and being so far away from DLG."
UCSantaBarbara,335y1m,Random_Ass_Guy,2,Mon Apr 20 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"Reading some of the other comments, yes, everyone is going to be biased toward the dorm they live(d) in.  That said, the on campus dorms are all very similar. Anacapa, Santa Cruz, and Santa Rosa are all right next to each other and have nearly identical facilities/layouts. I don't know much about San Nic/Miguel, but I've heard great things about them. You'll have a communal bathroom that you share with your floor, but depending on your dorm the beach could be about a two minute walk from your room.  FT (Santa Catalina) is the dorm that is most different from the others. It's a bit off campus and getting to classes will require a bike ride or a pretty long walk. However, there is a pool and you'll have your own bathroom that you share with another room, suite-style. There are a ton of freshmen there and floors are coed.  Overall, there are pretty minor differences between the dorms. Don't sweat this process too much, you'll end up somewhere you'll love (but choose Anacapa ;)).  Edit: Manzanita includes all classes, not just freshmen, so it's not a typical first year experience. Apparently it tends to be quieter/less social than the other dorms if that's what you prefer. Not speaking from personal experience though so take this with a grain of salt"
UCSantaBarbara,335y1m,ladybug7373,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"Another incoming freshman here, is there a way to increase my chances of living in Anacapa or Santa Cruz(my first choices)? Someone suggested requesting living in the API LLC in Anacapa, but I am not sure about doing that if I am not committed to all that asianess. Any suggestions?"
UCSantaBarbara,335y1m,Random_Ass_Guy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:57:52 2015 UTC,"It's essentially totally random. To maximize your odds, just make sure you fill up as many choices as possible with your desired dorm. Most of the rooms are triples, but it's worth putting one option as ""Santa Cruz double"" and the next as ""Santa Cruz triple"" to increase your chances. My first choice was an Anacapa triple and requesting a triple may have increased my odds. Not sure exactly how it works though.  Edit: Also, if you don't want to live on the API floor, don't request it. You don't want to be stuck there if you were unsure about living there in the first place."
UCSantaBarbara,335y1m,phugnguyen,2,Mon Apr 20 10:09:13 2015 UTC,"2nd here EE here. I definitely recommend San Miguel or San Nicholas, even though their buildings are older per day, you will meet a lot more people in these buildings.  Think about it, these buildings are towers and have only one or two ways of getting into the building or up to your dorm. This causes a funneling effect, allowing you to see more people everyday, more people that could potentially be your friends.  My friends from the other dorms at the time would tell me how they envy my building and how many people I actually know in the building.  If you choose the other dorms you will be mostly limited to seeing the people that are directly in your hall, probably never seeing people in the lower/upper level on the other side of the building."
UCSantaBarbara,335y1m,poopbaby21,2,Tue Apr 21 10:03:20 2015 UTC,"I live in Santa Cruz as a freshman right now, and I can personally testify that it is a TON of fun here. A walk from the beach, meeting your hallmates (your floor) is a lot of fun, and making friends from other halls is alot of fun if you want to get together and play vball on the sand court right outside or the bball court also right outside. Some of second floor had a view of the ocean. SC is awesome. I am in the substance free hall. Message me if you have any questions"

However, it is a bit of a hike from campus but it has its perks. Olympic sized swimming pool, food downstairs, etc. The other shorties you mentioned, Santa Rosa/ San Miguel / Santa Cruz etc are in very close vicinity so there will be plenty of people there as well.   Overall won't make a big difference. It's a big school and there are a ton of awesome people in every direction. I hope you have an amazing freshman year."
UCSantaBarbara,335y1m,Your_Worst_Daydream,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:08:16 2015 UTC,"I was in Santa Rosa and it was awesome because the wing I was in was the closest to DLG, so the food trek wasn't really a trek.

UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,Sasuke510ca,13,Mon Apr 20 09:27:24 2015 UTC,"The Santa Barbara area is actually surprisingly active with startups and new businesses springing up everywhere, much more so than Davis. I'm not sure what direction you want to go with econ, but there are countless new tech businesses that are constantly hiring UCSB grads.  Also, we have an excellent TMP (Technology Management Program) department that would offer you a way to broaden your degree and be more attractive to future employers."
UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,bluescholar1,2,Mon Apr 20 15:23:38 2015 UTC,Wow that's amazing. I definitely am interested in a program that is tech related. I'll more into it!  I got accepted for Pre-econ to be precise. Is that much of a difference? And is it as secure as my acceptance to Econ at UCD.
UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,bluescholar1,2,Mon Apr 20 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"So everyone starts as pre-econ because you have to get certain grades in specific, basic econ classes while maintaining a solid GPA in your other GE classes before they let you into the major.  Class size, difficulty, and grading methods would likely be very similar to Davis. However, you have less margin for error here and IV can be distracting if you get caught up in the lifestyle. I personally think it's worth it because of the employment opportunities, TMP department, networking quality, and standard of professors."
UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,Furzil,2,Mon Apr 20 22:26:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely suggest the Tech Management Program. You can finish in 3 quarters but give yourself some more time. I guess it's the future of biz programs because it was born out of the engineering program and it's super hands on. Plus, its a foot in the door at a lot of the tech companies around SB."
UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,Leelyak,0,Tue Apr 21 22:20:29 2015 UTC,That sounds really interesting. I kinda wish I had SIR'd at UCSB now
UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,RobotKitten,5,Sat May 2 06:57:38 2015 UTC,I don't know about economics for either campus but both Davis and UCSB are big bike campuses. But UCSB doesn't smell like cows.
UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,Squeakopotamus,7,Mon Apr 20 11:52:28 2015 UTC,"all the students I know that went to Davis really liked it. I don't think you can go wrong, however, UCSB really is paradise on earth. I miss my regular walks and bike rides on the cliffs. The epic beaches and mountains were wonderful.  Isla Vista is a fantastic place, but Davis isn't such a bad college town itself.  Can't tell you much about economics between the places."
UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,phugnguyen,2,Mon Apr 20 09:47:23 2015 UTC,UCSB really is paradise on earth.   This is where a lot of freshman get into trouble.  They can't prioritize school and end up dropping out.
UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,taztic,2,Mon Apr 20 15:15:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this applies directly to Econ but the Econ Accounting here is actually quite prestigious to my understanding. I know lots of Econ accounting students that get internships with the big 4. That is, the Big 4 actively recruit here at UCSB."
UCSantaBarbara,337tbm,fakename23,5,Mon Apr 20 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, the econ and accounting department here at UCSB is incredibly prestigious. The ""Big 4"" that are mentioned are the four largest international accounting firms: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst & Young, and KPMG. They don't recruit just anywhere; UCSB is one of the colleges where they do."

UCSantaBarbara,333lvu,Fireworkerss,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:58:54 2015 UTC,"I met up and discussed CCS bio with one of the faculty members. The general consensus is that if you're looking to pursue medical school, you should just go to L&S. The course load required to apply to medical school in conjunction with the amount of research they make you do each week a lot. You should try to get in contact with John Latto."
UCSantaBarbara,333lvu,sjsoo,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:23:15 2015 UTC,Maybe I should've made more clear about what I meant for medical school. I wanted to go into MD/Ph.d or just pure graduate school. MD/Ph.d is more heavily reliant on research and they usually end up researching at a university hospital. Sorry for the confusion and thanks for the response
UCSantaBarbara,333lvu,piggychuu,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:40:03 2015 UTC,"Woah. Med school with research? Interesting.  Laptops abouto to run out of battery so I'll keep this quick. Sorry for fragments. Literally just about to thought diarrhea so get ready; can clarify where unclear (lel) and whatnot once I get back   You may already know this but usually CCS is focused towards research (and thus grad school) - I haven't heard many people going to med school since i heard it was frowned upon in the CCS, but unsure of that.   First year is pretty easy. Chem/bio/physics maybe, along with some otehrs. Really not too bad.   If you're doing med school, you're going to have to take a loot of extra courses that you otherwise wouldn't have had to take. HONESTLY I'd suggest that you think about / learn more about the differences between grad and med school, since the requirements are significantly different, and unless you're doing an MD PHD it might not be wurf the time investment. For example, IN CCS theres a huge research part of it - that helps for grad school. Med school wants you to do stuff liek shadow a doctor, etc etc...very different from grad school. You are also required to take some other labs for med school (chemistry lab, orgo lab, etc), which are not required for CCS majors since they are usually going to be doing more relevant / actual lab work. Think of it this way: you're going to have, say, 16 units of courses (ucsb says something like 4 hrs of work per unit per week? Can't rememebr the exact metric). LONG STORY SHORT, you have class and lab work, which is like an additional 10-20 hrs a week of work. If you really want to apply to med school in addition to grad school, it's a metric fuckton of work.   Researching experiences. Basically walking around begging to get into a lab. Somewhat (yet not really) joking.  You have a lot of time, so I wouldn't worry too much about med/grad school since it's definitely something you're going to learn a lot about in the upcoming future. However, you have a great start being in the CCS your freshman  year - I got in my second year and the changes to my...uh...can't remember the word, req's for graduation, hurt a bit.   Feel free to msg me more about CCS, school, etc. I'm usually pretty active so I reply back quickly.   tl;dr grad school, 1st year ezpz no worriezbbq"
UCSantaBarbara,333lvu,raspberri,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:27:46 2015 UTC,Haha I should've specified. I'm leaning towards MD/Ph.d or just grad school. But I worked at a lab and my professor suggested for my interests MD/Ph.d is the best path if I can get in.
UCSantaBarbara,333lvu,ccsfaculty,2,Sun Apr 19 06:54:17 2015 UTC,Yeah if research is your interest over medicine then CCS is better suited for you. Doing CCS Bio with the intent to do medicine is pretty looked down upon.
UCSantaBarbara,333lvu,Trypt0phan,2,Sun Apr 19 20:43:40 2015 UTC,Yea. I want to be more of a medical researcher/scientist. Not an actual physician/surgeon. So research is my life haha
UCSantaBarbara,333lvu,Fluffaykitties,2,Sun Apr 19 21:21:43 2015 UTC,"Some good advice here already but let me add that, like most things in life, it's a bit more complicated...  CCS is simply not the best option for most students who know they want to go the MD route. Our end goals are different and getting into Med School is very different to getting into grad school. So its not that we frown on or look down on such students - its more that we worry we might be hurting your chances of getting into med school.  But each year we get a few students who want to fully explore a research option before deciding on their future direction. Some decide to embrace research (often medical research) and go on to a PhD realizing they don't need an MD to do what they want. Others opt for the highly competitive MD/PhD route. In that latter case having a 3-4 year research experience AND good grades will probably help your chances significantly.   Straight Med School bound students though are better off with a more limited research experience because they need to balance that with all the clinic and volunteer hours, getting good grades and eventually studying for the MCAT. Students often feel that research will help them on their med school applications and so apply to CCS. The problem is that some research will certainly help but we ask students to be ALL about the research and with only 24 hours in a day if you spend 20+ hours a week in a lab your grades may suffer a bit and you'll simply not have time for all the volunteer hours.   For grad schools though the odd B or B+ instead of an A or A- will make virtually no difference, and the letters of rec and publications that hopefully result will make a huge difference."

UCSantaBarbara,333gxl,edtropiax,3,Sun Apr 19 05:28:45 2015 UTC,i did FSSP and i would alos suggest staying in San nic. After the 6 weeks you won't want to move.
UCSantaBarbara,333gxl,eazy_25,2,Sun Apr 19 17:03:58 2015 UTC,I did this way back in 2002 and it was the best decision I ever made.

Enjoy it while it lasts.

UCSantaBarbara,333gxl,NachoBabyDaddy,3,Sun Apr 19 17:38:13 2015 UTC,"It was infinitely better in my experience. There are far less people, so you get to know everyone really well. The friends you make will become some of your closest friends for life. You will already be ""experienced"" by the time the rest of the freshman arrive and you will know the campus and IV. The campus is less crowded and the weather is perfect. You can get to know the gym and use it while it is less crowded. You won't feel as much like a freshman by the time you start in September."
UCSantaBarbara,333gxl,jlevangie,2,Sun Apr 19 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"Hi, FSSP participants will stay in San Nicolas for the entire year; however, the normal room change request process still applies... you can ask your Resident Director to move after the 2nd or 3rd week of fall quarter.

Just ask your RA in the summer how to go about that. People always move out/in each quarter for various reasons.  Also, yaaaaay, you chose to do FSSP. It's honestly so chill and I really enjoyed it."
UCSantaBarbara,333gxl,catsxmaru,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:15:24 2015 UTC,What was your favorite part about FSSP? I heard its a nice close-knit group.
UCSantaBarbara,333gxl,catsxmaru,2,Tue Apr 21 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"My favorite part was the work load, honestly. During orientation, my orientation leader recommended me to take no more than 9 units. I took two 4 unit classes and one 1 unit freshman seminar (which everyone in FSSP is required to take. It's a free A/ GPA booster.) The work load is pretty light and you'll never take this little number of units ever again.  This leaves a lot of room for play. The first welcome weekend is jam-packed with activities to get to know FSSPers. It's super chill, fun, and relaxed. It's also summer so there's plenty of time to enjoy your summer at the beach. You have more time to get to know people, explore the campus, and the beach. A lot of people found their friend group during this time, and I guess that's where the ""close-knit"" idea comes in. It's not like everyone knows everyone. However, not everyone found their group in FSSP and that's totally okay! That's where fall comes in. It's just a great segway into college. It's super chill and fun."
UCSantaBarbara,333gxl,aaperezk21,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:34:35 2015 UTC,This has been such a helpful comment! I can't wait to do FSSP!   If you go during the summer do people still dump water on you at DP? I've heard that's a thing they do to freshman.
UCSantaBarbara,332wc4,ladybug7373,4,Sun Apr 19 00:25:39 2015 UTC,"If you're an incoming freshman then it will not be hard to switch at all. As an ME, I know I can say that mechanical engineering is very rewarding when something you have designed is put to use and works as intended, as well, you learn a decent amount of electrical knowledge (nowhere near as much as electrical obviously) as well as knowledge in many other parts of science including programming, dynamics, thermo, etc. That being said the junior is insanely difficult and the senior year capstone is really fun, as well as the many clubs you can be apart of. I wouldn't know much about the electrical engineering degree."
UCSantaBarbara,332wc4,MC_Kreeper,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"The classes are just about the same for an ME and EE the first year (at least this was true in 2010). Coming from the same position as you (admitted as an ME, then switched after a year), I was told to stay in ME since that major was impacted, and only switch if absolutely sure (the EE transfer was easy).   As for difficulty, you will probably hear every engineering major claim their major is the most difficult (I am still convinced EE is the hardest, but I am sure someone from ME would disagree), so I wouldn't worry about this as much.   My recommendation is to spend your first year working on projects (something very rare as a Freshman) Join some of the engineering clubs (I joined IEEE, but there are many others out there), and go to discover engineering day (I think this is usually the Wednesday before classes start on Thursday). Also, if they still offer it, take ME11, it is an hour a week of professional MEs talking about what they do in their career. Highly useful I think (and the reason I finalized my decision to switch to EE). The differences are not hard to overcome later, there are ME professors with EE degrees and vice versa. Also, talk with professors, (is Tacy still there? She was awesome in setting this up), and overall try and discover your interests and what you enjoy doing. You are in an ideal position, so don't stress!   I hope this helps, let me know if you have any other questions!"
UCSantaBarbara,332sag,0OO0O0,7,Sat Apr 18 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it depends on the CC you're transferring from and your major. From my experience as a transfer (social science major):   Most lower division classes are the equivalent to most CC classes. Upper division classes tend to just have more reading and your midterm/final/paper is a larger part of your grade. It's really not that much more difficult per say, it's just more work.   I personally enjoyed the switch from semester to quarter. For me, semesters drag on for way too long (my CC was 15 weeks). With quarter, you get right into the meat of the course, have a midterm, a paper and right when you're bored/tired of the class, its the final and the quarter is over. Also you can't take nearly as many classes within a quarter as you could with semester. It balances out though since there are three quarters (excluding summer) within the year.   Registration is determined by what year your're in or if you're in any special programs through the university. Overall, I had a much better time adding classes at UCSB than at my CC. Depending on the class, if its full by the time you're registering, you can usually just email the professor or sit in on the first day of lecture to be put on a wait list. Depending on the drops/extra room available, you can get added. They may sometimes give priority depending on if you're a 3rd or 4th year. Again, this mostly depends on the class. Most lower div classes tend to be larger with a lot more people trying to add.   I had a great time at UCSB compared to my CC. The work was more challenging, but by the time you're a 3rd year student, you should already be focused on your major and studying. Since CC is mostly general education classes, I found being able to focus on my major was much more enjoyable and beneficial. You just need to effectively manage your time and put in the effort for your work and you should be fine."
UCSantaBarbara,332sag,Militantpoet,2,Sun Apr 19 00:08:43 2015 UTC,"You're right about semesters. Mine are 16 weeks, and they drag on for quite a while. I thought quarters would be harder since they are shorter, but since its spread out a little more it should be cool.  I think I just need to tweak my mindset and look forward to challenging work; that's why I'm going to university anyway. Thank you so much for your response, I really appreciate this!!"
UCSantaBarbara,332sag,jgthespy,3,Sun Apr 19 04:40:15 2015 UTC,"I transferred as a physics major and the jump in difficulty was staggering, although I'm sure most of that was the jump to upper division.  Outside of physics, classes are still more difficult here and require more time from you.  Your teachers don't really know you and they have much less time so everything seems a bit more harsh and impersonal.  Most of them aren't even good at teaching because they're really just researchers.  Instead, you'll mostly be interacting with TAs who have varying levels of competence and enthusiasm.  Quarters are great.  I had 17 or 18 week semesters at my CC and they were awful.  I'd get tired of my classes after 10 weeks and I'd still have 2 months to go.  With quarters, I start getting tired of it around week 8 but then I'm just about done.  The extra variety is really nice too.    When you get here, go overboard with your study habits at first.  Yours probably suck since CC was easy for you.  I came in cocky because CC was so easy and I paid for it.  It took me months to actually get my shit together because I didn't realize I had no study skills until I was already struggling.  I didn't know what working hard really meant.  Pre-read the first few chapters of your books at the end of the summer or during welcome week and get off to a very strong start in all of your classes.  You'll be able to gauge how much free time you'll have after a couple weeks.  That all sounds really dour but it's actually a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.  I'm essentially repeating my junior year as a math major now and everything is going smoothly.  My classes are way more interesting than CC and I feel myself getting smarter in a way that I've never felt before.  It's awesome."
UCSantaBarbara,332sag,Fluffaykitties,2,Sun Apr 19 03:22:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, I'm a computer science major if that means anything. CC is a lot like high school, because virtually all of my classes had ~30 students in them and we all got to interact with the professors. I've never had a TA, so that will be interesting.  CC was (is) easy, and I spend not nearly enough time studying as I'm supposed to (I think the rule of thumb is like double the number of units in hours per week? I'm not even close to that).  These replies made me realize that I should be excited about all of the stuff I'm going to learn, not ""afraid"" that it will be a lot of work. It'll be nice to finally be at a level that I find challenging. I really look forward to going here or wherever I decide to go. Not sure yet, but I'll probably go here :)"
UCSantaBarbara,332sag,orrade,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yo. CS person here.   I was at UCSB all four years for CS.   At the beginning of my third year, the transfers came. A lot of us didn't like them at first, because they seemed like they knew more than us. They came from SBCC.   So, don't sweat it. Not sure where you're transferring from, but you will be fine in classes. The only annoying thing will be dealing with quarters rather than semesters."
UCSantaBarbara,332sag,Nekona,2,Mon Apr 20 09:23:23 2015 UTC,"If you're worried the best is to keep from overwhelming yourself. Take the minimum amount of units and take any lower division classes you may have left (you might not have any though - I did because not everything for my major was available at my CC).   The reason for this is that the biggest jumps are between lower division to upper division and from semester to quarter. On top of it is anything else (adjusting to living away from home, trying to make new friends, etc) that can add stress and make things more difficult.  I kept my limits in mind when I transferred and had a great first quarter while I know others who didn't and essentially crashed and burned."
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,TrufflesTheSaint,9,Sat Apr 18 01:48:25 2015 UTC,If Bibilashvilli teaches Physics 20 take it from him. He's one of the CCS instructors. If you do REALLY well in that class and develop a relationship with him you may have better luck applying during freshman year.   Don't be too disappointed if you don't get in. UCSB physics is really good anyway.
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,kluckkluckma,4,Sat Apr 18 02:42:36 2015 UTC,Is there a textbook I can get now that would prepare me for his class?
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,hayjude99,3,Sat Apr 18 02:45:12 2015 UTC,"I believe PHYS 20 uses Physics RHK Volume I, but CCS Physics uses that plus Classical Mechanics by  klepner and kolenkow.  2 people from L&S Physics were able to transfer,  but you're basically just taking the spots of people who switch out.   If you want to look at the problem sets from Dr. Tengiz Bibilashvili's last freshman class you can see them here. He'd be your advisor so the problem sets should be similar."
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,kluckkluckma,5,Sat Apr 18 03:08:16 2015 UTC,You are right except that phys 20 uses kleppner and kolenkow as well as hrk. Don't bother getting hrk though. Kk is the better of the two.
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,party5353,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:25:21 2015 UTC,But actually do get hrk because you will need it for phys 22 and 25
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,hayjude99,3,Sat Apr 18 08:14:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you for all of the info. I ordered both books last night, and I cant wait until they get here!"
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,PetaPetaa,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:24:21 2015 UTC,Good luck!
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,ZombieLabrador,2,Sat Apr 18 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"20 does use both but as someone else mentioned, K&K will be much more applicable to CCS style problem solving."
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,piggychuu,0,Sat Apr 18 18:43:31 2015 UTC,It's top 10 in the world
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,sky_s,3,Sat Apr 18 07:47:33 2015 UTC,"If you can, talk to the advisors often. Visit their office hours, have them get to know you. For example, Dr. Latto is the bio CCS advisor, and he has office hours (X). One could go and talk to him about some cool research going on, etc etc / talk about CCS bio."
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,kluckkluckma,2,Sat Apr 18 02:32:00 2015 UTC,is it really that hard to get an A in Math 8
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,TheSanctified,0,Sat Apr 18 06:42:31 2015 UTC,"Not from what I've heard. Also, ccs math is less competitive as far as I know."
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,mathdestruction,1 point,Sat Apr 18 10:03:29 2015 UTC,"The professor emailed him telling how much of a great job he did--so there is that too. If you can get a professor to vouch for your ability to be in the CCS program, that can work too.   Math 8 is a new language to most people. The instructor makes a HUGE difference. You just have to get yourself thinking in a new gear and do all the work the Professor assigns (ask around first)."
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,sky_s,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:29:54 2015 UTC,Here's some cheap physics books written by the masters:  http://amzn.com/0486417131  http://amzn.com/048660361X
UCSantaBarbara,32zma1,Le_Canotier,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"Do I have to have any experience in a subject beforehand so I can understand those books, or will I be able to comprehend them with only ap physics 1 and calc bc under my belt?"
