Even if you can live with 1.5mbit down the up speed is preposterously slow, I seem to recall its 200kbps or something stupid slow.  I would definately try century link if they have a reasonable speed in your area, if you are very lucky they have gigabit in some extremely limited areas."
boulder,3dvy57,FearTheCron,2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:37 2015 UTC,"Was with Comcast, tried CenturyLink for 30 days, and switched back to Comcast.   CL kept having service 'hiccups' where it wouldn't work for anywhere from 5-30 minutes, modem reboots only occasionally helped. Much happier with internet 10X as fast as CenturyLink.   Make sure you call Comcast every year with a low offer from CenturyLink to get a good deal. I have their fastest internet, basic non-HD channels (it's cheaper even though the box isn't hooked up), and HBO which gives me HBO Go."
boulder,3dvy57,thebabaghanoush,2,Mon Jul 20 19:34:33 2015 UTC,"You're stuck between slow internet here and the god damn devil. Here is my advise: get Comcast and keep a record of every interaction you have with them. I signed up for a good deal online, then went through two weeks of bull shit to get them to actually give me that rate instead of 2x what I signed up for. They will make you do all of the customer service stuff through online chat. Copy and paste every single one and save them (or it might have some save transcript button). You will basically have to use a combination of threatening to cancel your service and calling them out on their lies to get the deals they advertise. I'm pretty bitter... Maybe you'll have a better experience than me."
boulder,3dvy57,furrald,2,Mon Jul 20 02:20:20 2015 UTC,same thing happened to me.  I just threatened to cancel and switch to CL.  They gave me the rate eventually with no problem.
boulder,3dvy57,PoonKoon,2,Mon Jul 20 04:03:51 2015 UTC,"Figure out the speed you need, and select accordingly, maybe adding 1 or 2 mbps because you rarely get exactly what they advertise all the time. Don't let them tell you what you need. https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306  I've had both Comcast and Century link in Boulder, and I'd just go with whichever one is cheaper or has more favorable contract terms. For example, century link often requires a 1 year contract or longer, and Comcast usually doesn't. Comcast has more speed options. Century link was slightly cheaper for me when I signed up. The introductory price of Comcast seems to fluctuate more than the price of Century link.  Century link doesn't have high speed available everywhere. I can get 20mbps or whatever where I live now, but where I used to live it was limited to slow DSL speeds, 7mbps down and mystery upload speed.  I couldn't find the upload speed on the website!   Overall I slightly prefer Comcast."

boulder,3dvy57,Dsiegrist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:41:48 2015 UTC,"Comcast is getting their shit together because they are terrified of Google and/or Boulder getting muni fiber together as a going concern. Their customer service and streaming problems / reliability has really only massively improved within the last 18 months after net neutrality and FCC made it clear they wouldn't stand for any throttling bullshit.  I mean we still don't have much leverage here, not if you want any kind of reliable service that allows you to stream stuff live in HD - Comcast is your only option. But they are improving, and it's the fear of God that's been put in them from the potential ramifications of actual good competition."
boulder,3dvy57,lonefrontranger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"I was in this same situation. I just wanted internet, but it was $10 cheaper to bundle basic cable with it. Makes no sense, but oh well. I don't know about you needing 50Mbps, but I certainly wanted more bandwidth than that.  The biggest problem is that the upload speeds are crap with Comcast. The plans they offered me were 25/5, 50/10, or 105/10. I wasn't about to get 5Mbps up, and 105/10 was only 5USD/mo more, so 105/10 it is."

Boulder's really lucky to have such an outstanding clinic available at affordable rates to the community.    Were you from another state where you had insurance?  Even if your insurance lapsed due to non payment you likely are experiencing the qualifying event of moving and would be able to sign up for insurance today.  Kaiser, an HMO, is generally the cheapest in the area.  I would call them ASAP this morning to see if you would qualify for a Special Enrollment Period for insurance.  You don't have to sign up with them, but if they would allow you any of the carriers will.   If you're under 30 you may be eligible for catastrophic coverage only, which would be cheaper than normal insurance.  In the past 2 weeks I've watched someone unexpectedly incur 2 mil in hospital costs, and counting.  Insurance is nothing to skimp out on!"
boulder,3dljfs,DeviatedNorm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:06:46 2015 UTC,I moved here from Pennsylvania a little more than two weeks ago. I had insurance through my old job which ended when I left the company. I'll have to look into that insurance that you suggested today. Thank you!
boulder,3dljfs,DeviatedNorm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:22:05 2015 UTC,So an insurance company is likely to see your Special Enrollment Period as 60 days beginning when you left the company.  You absolutely have to have paperwork signed and submitted before those 60 days are up or you will have to wait until 2016 to get insurance :/

I lost my job and health insurance a few years ago while I was still in grad school (and my school's private insurance was a joke and very expensive), and I've had nothing but great experiences there.  Yes, you will have to wait a bit, but make an appointment and it's just like any other doctor's office.  I liked my doctor.  They have a sliding scale system and will work with you if you can't pay immediately, just talk to them and be forthright with your financial issues.

Their salsas are thick and flavorful to perfectly smother over their street tacos http://www.tacosdelnortetruck.com/ La Choza.  2 locations in Boulder, one is a restaurant off Violet & Broadway, other is a truck further east off 47th st & Pearl. http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-choza-boulder Sancho’s Authentic Mexican Restaurant - killer tortas, tacos and gorditas http://sanchosmexican.com/   Efrains is pretty good, love that they are not afraid to hold back the spice level, but not my favorite compared to the three above. Final shout out to Papusas, though it is not strictly Mexican http://www.yelp.com/biz/pupusas-sabor-hispano-boulder"
boulder,3dick5,DarthBarney,2,Thu Jul 16 22:50:40 2015 UTC,"I like La Panda in Longmont, but Efrains (one in Lafayette) is the best around IMO."
boulder,3dick5,TKubs91,2,Thu Jul 16 22:57:05 2015 UTC,I'm just happy that no one said The Rio or Cantina Loredo. My first choice is always Efrains.
boulder,3dick5,polis79,2,Fri Jul 17 23:51:36 2015 UTC,Looking at the menu of Efrain's.. it is Tex Mex. I grew up eating in Mexico...   I don't normally go out to eat Mexican food but I will be checking out La Choza
boulder,3dick5,why_earth,5,Sat Jul 18 00:47:16 2015 UTC,I agree with those who say effrains. Plus their premier margarita is insane.
boulder,3dick5,thebabaghanoush,9,Thu Jul 16 15:59:58 2015 UTC,Efrain's hands down.
boulder,3dick5,fjacobs1000,13,Thu Jul 16 14:56:16 2015 UTC,Efrains blows. ...my opinion
boulder,3dick5,fjacobs1000,2,Thu Jul 16 15:25:40 2015 UTC,"Fjacobs, which is good?"
boulder,3dick5,thehappyheathen,5,Thu Jul 16 16:01:30 2015 UTC,"La Choza, Wapos, Sanchos..."
boulder,3dick5,enzomatic75,2,Thu Jul 16 17:01:18 2015 UTC,I agree. I went to the one in Lafayette and got a burrito or enchiladas. It was just a plate of generic enchilada sauce with something soggy underneath.
boulder,3dick5,dtdv,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:28:46 2015 UTC,"Gotten sick there before. Food is good, jury is out on kitchen cleanliness."
boulder,3dick5,Captain_Arrrg,3,Thu Jul 16 17:01:47 2015 UTC,If you like hot then Efrain's hands down
boulder,3dick5,DarthBarney,5,Thu Jul 16 15:47:23 2015 UTC,The Mexican food in Boulder is sad compared to the rest of the state. I'd recommend driving to the other side of the open space to where Mexicans can afford to live.   Case in point? Both La Choza and Efrains are chains from elsewhere: La Choza is from Denver and Efrains is from Louisville. There are entire blocks of burrito shops and taco stands in Longmont and Louisville. Boulder doesn't even have a single 24 hour taco stand. This makes me a confused and sad Coloradan.  But at least the property taxes are high enough to keep crime down!
boulder,3dick5,paintball312,8,Thu Jul 16 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"Efrains is NOT a chain.  Three brothers opened the original in Lafayette (not Louisville) 20 years ago.  It was so successful, one brother opened a similar (not identical) menu in Boulder, and then the third in Longmont, also not an identical menu."
boulder,3dick5,thehappyheathen,7,Thu Jul 16 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"What, there's a La Choza in Denver? I mean, if you ever went to La Choza when it was a little trailer by the Sinclair on 47th and Diagonal, or even when they moved the trailer to North Broadway it sure wasn't very ""chain"" like. I haven't been to the brick and mortar restaurant yet, but I assume it's just as good as the shack was."
boulder,3dick5,jonathonApple,2,Thu Jul 16 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I came here to recommend they drive down to Denver. Longmont has good Mexican though, so it's kinda the same advice. My favorite in Boulder county is probably Santiago's or Casa Alegre in Louisville."
boulder,3dick5,thehappyheathen,4,Thu Jul 16 18:39:57 2015 UTC,"... And we have two posts that show why people in East Boulder County get so annoyed with Boulderites: both Efrain's and Santiago's are in/from Lafayette, not Louisville.    Lafayette /= Louisville/= Longmont"
boulder,3dick5,TheDentite,4,Thu Jul 16 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"I lived in the Prana apartments by Exempla Good Samaritan's on 287 for 2 years. I'm pretty aware of where Louisville, Lafayette and Longmont are. I wasn't trying to imply Santiago's was in or from Louisville. I intended it to be read, ""My favorite in Boulder county is probably Santiago's (or Casa Alegre in Louisville).""  I'm really sorry I hurt Lafayette's feelings though. I'll try to remember to send a card to the one block of South Public Road that entirely encompasses anything worth doing in Lafayette."
boulder,3dick5,polis79,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"Multiple locations doesn't mean a chain.  La Choza can't possibly be considered a chain by anyone, even if the owners have another location in Denver."
boulder,3dick5,el_perro_negro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:30:25 2015 UTC,Can afford to live...nice.
boulder,3dick5,stabzmcgee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:40:09 2015 UTC,"Effrain's: Lives up to the hype, especially if you like your food spicy. Get a taste of the green chile on the side if you are weary. Longmont location is better.  La Choza: The greasey spoon of Mexican food in Boulder. Authentic AF. Not as fresh as Sancho's. No booze.   Sancho's: One of the most authentic and fresh in town right now. No booze, but that keeps the prices down.   Wapo's: Decent but overpriced. $11 for a three taco plate. Coin style Margs aren't really coin style but they jack the price up on them.   Rincon del Sol: ""Family"" Mexican restaurant. A little under seasoned /bland for my liking. Go there for Happy Hour only.  Rancho Grande: Good food. I remember the rellenos being really good. Margs sucked, avoid at all costs."
boulder,3dick5,Old_Grau,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:06:08 2015 UTC,I love efrains green chili bowl but it blows my ass up every time :0

boulder,3dkl1h,swampking,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:52:01 2015 UTC,It really depends on the type of camping you are doing - hiking or car camping. Mountains get cold at night - typically in the 30s.  Run a search on the r/boulder.

boulder,3df1ab,my_boulder_throwaway,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:32:54 2015 UTC,"North or South Boulder, gunbarrel, superior, and Louisville have good schools and tons of families. I have heard not good things about the Lafayette elementary schools, but that could be rumors - they are likely better than the schools I went too. Lousiville is just as expensive as Boulder IMO. Nitwot also has good schools and a super cut downtown like Louisville."
boulder,3df1ab,DougHamilton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:40 2015 UTC,"Some of the Lafayette elementaries are not that awesome, but one is supposedly good, the district does open enrollment, and last time I looked into it, Lafayette residents got special consideration for getting into other Lafayette schools to mitigate the odds of having to trek to another town just to escape one disliked school.  All that said, while Lafayette's Main Street has somewhat improved, it still doesn't hold a candle to a Louisville or Niwot. You just have to decide it that is worth the steep premium in home prices."
boulder,3df1ab,skirlhutsenreiter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:16:37 2015 UTC,"Premium for Boulder? Or Premium for the Denver, CO metroplex?"
boulder,3df1ab,MadManuel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:07:58 2015 UTC,"Lafayette is less exspensive than Louisville and very nice. Good schools, main street is always buzzing, the library is a great safe place for kids and adults, and there is actually some notion of diversity here. I feel that it is a safe and comfortable place, but you really cant learn about Boulder through a online comment."

boulder,3dchao,microcline,2,Wed Jul 15 05:03:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on your price range! (Not your lunch meat preference)  Downtown can be super expensive, but Pearl Street is incredible. The Hill is also super expensive, and it's full of fraternities and spoiled 19 yr olds. If you want cheap, look at North or South Boulder, if you want really cheap look at Westminster, Lafayette, Nederland or Longmont, among other nearby suburbs. Rent is crazy expensive in central Boulder.   Hope this helps!"
boulder,3dchao,STINKdoctor,-1,Wed Jul 15 05:13:55 2015 UTC,Price range is on the lower side for now (thanks student loans). How accessible are the suburbs? We're used to Chicago where the suburbs are dark and scary places that only old boring people choose to live in.
