Felt just like you said, a regular episode, and I'm happy about it.  Hopefully people who have been so negative to him in his comments about his schedule will try giving some positive reinforcement/feedback a chance (though I noticed there were people already asking for modded for example!)."
ethoslab,3dzk31,K_nikk,4,Mon Jul 20 23:10:35 2015 UTC,"To be honest it was about time. I've been used to about one MC episode per day but recently It was more like one episode per week. Good that the focus seems to be MC again. It's like sleeping in your own bed again after a two week vacation abroad in unfamiliar, foreign beds.  My vacation by the way was watching all the UHC videos from Ethos and SethBlings viewpoints. I hadn't done that before."

ethoslab,3dzk31,rock_buster,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:22 2015 UTC,I watched through Etho's season 11 UHC recently.  Have never watch Sethbling's viewpoint (outside of this most recent one).  Any reason in particular you chose those two as a pairing to rewatch?
ethoslab,3dzk31,K_nikk,3,Tue Jul 21 00:05:53 2015 UTC,I watched Seth because he has a soothing voice like Etho (cannot watch Let's Plays when the narrator's voice is annoying) and he does imho one of the best redstone circuit research videos.  EDIT: Also season 13 afair is one of the best UHC seasons from Seths viewpoint imho. The one with episode 5 or 6 being the one where they are on one hill and their adversaries on the other hill. They craft a music box there as well. So much fun watching

ethoslab,3dzk31,K_nikk,8,Mon Jul 20 21:09:20 2015 UTC,"Great building, it was neat to see him start the first block placements on camera.  I think he has a keener eye than he gives himself credit (or atleast he's been training these kind of design muscles) cause it came together rather quickly during that first bit before breaking for off-camera work.  Love the descent into the basement, and the interesting wall feature that that creates inside the house.   I like the wood pile in the back, and the windows to the wheat field and flower garden.  Nice touches. Wonder if he could build a massive tree nearby with a rope swing (fence posts and slab?).  Feels like just the right place for an ancient oak.  He does have quite a big oak tree in that area - maybe that would be big enough.  Edit: Forgot to mention - Very clever nether hub light program idea!  That simple thing turned out very cool.  I'm glad the chickens didn't work out."

ethoslab,3dzk31,Compieuter,6,Tue Jul 21 15:40:00 2015 UTC,in real life people build windows for three main reasons: 1. to look outside. 2. to get sunlight in a room. 3. to get fresh air into a room.  For reason number two your windows need to be oriented towards the sun and on the northern hemisphere the sun is more towards the south so windows on the south side provide sunlight in the house. So Etho didn't feel the need to put houses on the north side because where he lives (in the northern hemisphere) those windows wouldn't provide direct sunlight.

ethoslab,3e23ey,_Poncan_,15,Tue Jul 21 10:48:25 2015 UTC,Hasn't this topic been discussed enough?
ethoslab,3e23ey,theartofelectronics,5,Tue Jul 21 14:14:10 2015 UTC,Nope. Terraria gets puts out on a regular basis at the same time for both etho and zistaeu. It just looks like there is less Minecraft because of it
ethoslab,3e23ey,ShaneH7646,2,Tue Jul 21 11:08:01 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but I also kind of understand it from etho's perspective. He's done so much in SSP that there's not all that much left to do. I think thats why he started modded and ark and stuff.  I'm not complaining though, I loved the SSP series and mindcrack/hermitcraft episodes, but ark and modded are my absolute favorite series of his"
ethoslab,3e23ey,Urgaano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:19 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way - to make Terraria episodes with Zisteau he might play 4 hours, add another 2 hours for editing (Pretty much just jump cuts), and that's 6 hours, with 8 episodes ready to release. If he plays Minecraft, he can spend days making a single episode. His Minecraft world is at the point where any new projects take a good amount of time, and it's not always worth the time investment to views. Don't get me wrong, the Minecraft content Etho puts out is still my favourite, but I get why other series can take priority sometimes."
ethoslab,3e23ey,Dabien,0,Tue Jul 21 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"I think so too, which is why it's interesting to see what will happen when 1.9 finally releases."
ethoslab,3e23ey,JFSOCC,0,Tue Jul 21 11:21:18 2015 UTC,"I think your analysis is correct. Minecraft is getting old now. It first came out on PC on 17th May 2009. The same year as Borderlands 1, Demon's Souls, Dragon Age: Origins, FEAR 2, Killzone 2, and Left 4 Dead 2, which all feel like another age now.  I think if it wasn't for the mods and fan-made adventure maps, etc., Minecraft would just be a small cult game, even with the official patches taken into account. What these long gaps between patch releases has shown is how tired the game feels when they aren't constantly coming up with new stuff.  I don't think anyone would disagree when I say Minecraft won't be enjoying the heady days of 2012-13 again. The official patches and fan-made mods will help keep its head above water, but unless some sort of Minecraft 2 comes along, with features we can't even comprehend right now, I think the franchise will start leaking into nostalgia territory. It already has for me a bit."
ethoslab,3e0hdp,Chermonix,17,Tue Jul 21 00:34:15 2015 UTC,"Never, unless there is a terrain change so radical that the world pretty much requires it."
ethoslab,3e0hdp,bnm70,7,Tue Jul 21 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  Even if a few new biomes are added, his world is small enough (since it's just him) that he can just walk a few thousand blocks and find them.  There's also the 20-something unfinished projects he will never hear the end of. And he needs time to actually use the Nexus after working on it for so long."
ethoslab,3e0hdp,WhitzWolf,6,Tue Jul 21 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think that there are only 3 reasons for making a new world:    As /u/bnm70 stated, if a radical terrain change occurs, although he did change his world gen from a normal world to a amplified one, so I think he could work something with that as well.  His current world becomes too big (in terms of file size) and/or too laggy. Now I don't see this happening as he does not expand that much into the world nor does he do a lot of laggy redstone or similar in his spawn chunks.  Something happens with his save file and gets corrupted and he doesn't have any workable backup and the all the planets align against him :))   TBH, I don't see any reason for this change any time soon."
ethoslab,3e0hdp,spamaelMC,2,Tue Jul 21 08:58:31 2015 UTC,"He's constantly making backup, so I don't think 3 will happen, terrain changes... well, as you said he can do the same as amplified, and 2 I don't see that happening either. So, not any time soon."
ethoslab,3e0hdp,Kiwi_Gamer8060,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"The only reason he reset his previous world was because of a major update which broke most of his builds. And I don't see another update like that coming along any time soon.  EDIT: Though honestly, if he managed to get all of his major projects out of the way (which is nowhere near to being accomplished), I'd be all for a reset. It'd be nice to have a little change."
ethoslab,3duhpp,ChannelBot,11,Sun Jul 19 16:30:33 2015 UTC,Poor Zisteau - I think Etho might need to work on his active listening. :)  I'm sure the people who've been watching and aggravating about the equipment slots had a huge sigh of relief today.   Comparing who's grappling hook was longer....  Hm.

But man, oh man, lots of examples of him not hearing Zisteau in this episode (and evidence of it from previous): the gold crown, selling to vendors (it was on the second mention that he caught it), the grappling hook slot...  Kinda funny (and kind of frustrating!).  I wonder if it could have anything to do with his headphones actually.  Zisteau does talk kind of quietly at times, and we know Etho has headphone issues.  Or Etho is just easily distracted - that could be the case too  :)"

ethoslab,3dvtq1,Jadja-,32,Sun Jul 19 23:18:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think Hermitcraft is much better, at least for Etho. 16 other active members on the vanilla server alone, and they are all extremely competent, motivated, and excited when it comes to Minecraft.  In comparison to Mindcrack, where there's what? 3 active members, that have been known to drop off for long periods of time, and a few other sporadic members, all fairly mediocre at the game, as far as endgame gameplay goes."

ethoslab,3dnofv,Twiggy02,6,Fri Jul 17 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"HAha!  Great update!  I love the nod at the Ark repeat.  Very clever!  I voted - continue as he is.  Minecraft is not going anywhere on his channel - it will ramp up again eventually.  Terraria and Ark however, will not be as long lived and so if he enjoys playing them should get to play them as much as he wants, and lucky us we get to see  them.  With updates on the horizon for Minecraft, this timing actually works out perfectly."

I have had a terribly stressful week at work (stupid vacation season with all my colleagues who are taking vacation setting me as their ""out of office""; so all their emails/work gets directed to me - sigh) and I've been watching these on my lunch breaks!  Edit - post watch: I like the idea of having a separate area that they visit for their tombstones to periodically build a large graveyard (multi-tired instead of just along the ground).  If they keep track of how frequently they go to refill, they could track their death counter/play time progression.  Maybe first tier for first X episodes/area, another tier for deaths during the next X episodes/area and so on.  Would give some context to the deaths instead of just to place them and see how many.    From what I can tell, they're doing pretty good.  Poor Etho had to walk into the eye of cathulu a few times, just to feel something.  That captain America shield is my favourite melee ""weapon"" so far!

ethoslab,3dn5ry,K_nikk,3,Fri Jul 17 18:45:50 2015 UTC,They waited far too long to do this IMO.  Wasn't as fun as it could have been watching them with gear that was far too good for the boss fight and just owning it.
ethoslab,3dn5ry,Resys,3,Sat Jul 18 00:40:59 2015 UTC,"I wonder if they were expecting it to be harder than it turned out to be.

I miss the abundance of LP videos to watch but I just tell myself not to resist the change because in the end his current content is still some of the best on YouTube. I value Etho's family friendly content that appeals to all age ranges, his humor, the style of videos, and a great deal of other attributes. He clearly wants to continue the LP so I am not worried.   EDIT tried to improve the grammar"
ethoslab,3dig30,SquaredCubed,15,Thu Jul 16 16:47:28 2015 UTC,"This post is not directed solely at the OP, but in general to this reddit.    My major concern with the frequent comments about Etho's upload rate of a particular series, in a place where it is known he will see it, is the self-fulfilling prophecy it generates.  I think a part of what makes Etho's content so good is that it comes out of an actual enjoyment of the game and what he is doing and desire to share with an audience for the positive feedback loop that generates.  When he is excited about something, there may be more, when he is less so there are fewer episodes.  When his audience is excited it encourages him, when his audience is unhappy/negative it does not.  Complaints about his performance in UHC episode comments did not encourage him to do better next time - it made him (in part) avoid it altogether.  He has mentioned that people would even post those complaints on non-UHC episodes and that caused further stress.  I see the same thing happening now with his vanilla minecraft schedule, and upload schedule in general.  We've had months of people complaining about it in his youtube comments, people complaining about it in the episode threads on reddit, people complaining about it in posts created solely for that purpose in a place he is bound to see it, people complaining about it (in this case minecraft episode uploads) in youtube comments of Terraria.   The pattern here is that this not likely to motivate him to make more, but further cause a negative feedback loop on his minecraft content - until he dreads reading youtube comments, dreads having to address it in the beginning of his episodes, dreads clicking into reddit to see what people are saying to be faced with it again, forces himself to come up with something to film even when he isn't inspired to try to stem those comments.  I can already see it in the way he frequently apologizes for the lack of uploads in the beginning of his episodes, gives excuses for delays, comes up with formula-like ways to come up with new ideas (like making the book of unfinished projects - so that if he doesn't have inspiration to work on something he can use that to atleast find something to do).  That is just the kind of frame of mind that would lead to reduced enjoyment and inspiration in playing those games and therefore less frequent content.  What's worse, I see people only speak up to highlight the decrease in episodes, and not engaging positively when an episode is posted.  So that there is a growing negative feedback loop of discouragement and a diminishing positive feedback loop of encouragement."

ethoslab,3dig30,BlueCyann,11,Thu Jul 16 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"It's funny; I hadn't considered it, but I actually haven't sat down and watched any of his content since his last single-player LP.  His content is good, and I enjoy his content all around. I'm happy to see Terraria and Ark, they are fine series. I dunno, though. Personally, I came for the LP and I stay for the LP at the end of the day. There's just something about it that other channels don't have and the person representing the channel, Etho, also has a very amiable persona that goes with those videos. He really shines through in them and I appreciate the fun mix of content in the LP itself - jokes, tutorials, stories, projects, etc. It's like watching ""This Old House"" where every week they work on the property and have segments about the methods used for the property, not to mention fan feedback is taken at the end and responded to.  At some point I'll binge watch his current series - that's mostly because content has somewhat slowed down, I feel. I find it kind of hard to watch 20 minutes a few times a week. That could be bias, though.  In all honesty, he's about the only YouTuber I watch regularly. Maybe two or three others, but Etho really started it for me.  I'm not suggesting that this is a sign of things to come, him moving on to other games, etc. He is definitely expanding his portfolio and influence, though, in doing so. I don't think he'd ever move on from Minecraft for those of you worrying - he's made that very clear in the past. He's also made clear that such things aren't his concern, and he's more than likely having fun with his new games.  Bottom line, I look forward to more LP episodes, though I have no problem with new content. He has a reasonably sized audience that enjoys his other series, and that's fantastic to see."
ethoslab,3dig30,Beardalelist,15,Thu Jul 16 21:40:18 2015 UTC,I understand the people who downvote this post. But you guys have to understand that some of youtube watchers don't have the time for watching hours of videos. I'm watching Etho just for his minecraft (especially LP) content and I agree with OP. I miss Etho making videos on Mindcrack (Hermitcraft nowadays) or finishing his builds on his LP world.

ethoslab,3dig30,Weefreemen,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:10 2015 UTC,"I think one problem with producing Minecraft videos right now is the lack of game updates, not to bash the developers, they can update it whenever they feel is right.  It's just that when they add something like water temples or horses it practically creates a free episode of content for LPers like Etho, they spend an episode just exploring the new content; whereas the lack of new content means that LPers have to come up with increasingly original ideas. This can take much more planning and preparation, which in-turn makes creating high-quality videos take much longer compared to newer games such as ARK or Terrararia 1.3."

I do enjoy his other content but it isn't the same as his LP. The new game he started, dinosaurs and stuff, doesn't catch my attention one bit. I like etho because of his solo plays and dedication to progress, though awkward at best. I really enjoyed a lot of his series but when he was playing with others I just cannot get into it, I'm there for etho. He is trying to serve a different status quo but it isn't for the LP fans, it isn't as technical or as direct as the LP. I love terraria, but it seemed to me that when he's with others it's more about the quest to getting something, while LP is the something already got."

ethoslab,3dig30,Grantus89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"A part of what makes it great is that it comes from real enjoyment of the subject matter and wanting to share it. I think he avoids some of the more businessy type things (like merchandising, thumbnails, set schedules, patreon accounts, donations, twitch subscriptions etc.) in order to remove a feeling of obligation and therefore keep that level of personal enjoyment that allows his content to be what it is.  I think the more people get personally invested in what he does the more they feel they should have a say in how it is done, when it is done, and what is done.  All that obligation he has been avoiding is coming back and instead of being able to allow his enjoyment of what he makes dictate the frequency and content, he allows these outside obligations and not wanting to let his fans down force his hand.  Then it becomes a little more stressful, a little more pressure, making content when not inspired, making content not from enjoyment first but to satisfy other people and that results in not getting the quality he is comfortable with, and that leads to chucking the material, making fewer uploads, or even just playing less frequently. Which leads to more external pressure and the cycle continues.  (In theory anyway)  It's such a delicate balance to express love for a particular content while not adding to a sense of obligation that would make it harder for him to create it and be himself.  (again, in theory)"
ethoslab,3dig30,Teraka,6,Fri Jul 17 02:36:14 2015 UTC,"People are going to down vote because they think there favourite youtubers can do no wrong, but the fact is at the very least Etho should give a reason for the lack of uploads recently or at least acknowledge it. For many people YouTube is TV and people rely on it for entertainment, imagine if Game of Thrones just went off air for 3 weeks in the middle of a season without any explanation, people would get annoyed and rightly so, that's essentially what's happening now, people are used to a video every day(except maybe weekends), and that's no what's happening, and what is being uploaded is mainly terraria, which while awesome, is probably much quicker to record then a minecraft video."

If he doesn't post LP videos, nothing bad will happen to you, you'll just be disappointed.  I'm sure Etho isn't not recording LPs because he doesn't feel like they're important or because he feels like nobody watches them, the reason is most likely that at the moment he lacks inspiration or motivation to record them. And if it's one of those two, there's really nothing that he or us can do about it. If he forces himself to record an LP just because they've been sparse in the last few weeks, it's going to show in the episode, and it'll be sub-par as a result. You don't want that, and I know Etho doesn't want that either, he's mentioned multiple times that he already scrapped whole episodes in the past because he wasn't happy with how they turned out.  My only advice would be to try to get into his other content if you really want to get more Etho. I started watching Terraria 1.2 with him and Z because I really wanted to get the banter between the two, even if I really didn't care about the game, and I ended up actually really enjoying the series as a whole, and now watching their 1.3 series with great pleasure."

If he doesn't post LP videos, nothing bad will happen to you, you'll just be disappointed.   Of course it's a service, like TV is, like I said before, if a TV program isn't going to be on like it normally is, the network will say so and if possible say why, they wouldn't just not show the scheduled show.   the reason is most likely that at the moment he lacks inspiration or motivation to record them.   Then he should say that, all he has to do is say ""sorry the vids have been a bit sparse lately, I've been lacking a bit of motivation, when the first snapshot comes out I'll probably pick up again"", then the problem would be solved, but nothing, he puts out a LP episode and just acts like everything is normal and it hasn't been 10 days since the last one.  And if he lacks inspiration in minecraft, play something else, upload some hearthstone, or some Don't Starve, or whatever else he is playing.   My only advice would be to try to get into his other content   I watch everything Etho puts out, but becasue there hasn't been a lot I'm having to find other things to watch, and if I find something else which is good and regular and Etho isn't, then I'm going to fall behind on Ethos stuff, it's happened before with other youtubers and it will happen again, and I don't want it to happen because I really like Etho, but I need something to watch every night."

He only has to say in a video or tweet that he's going on vacation or something and I wouldn't have a problem, but wondering every night if there is going to be a video or if I'm going to have to find something else to watch sucks, and is easily avoidable by Etho communicating better."
ethoslab,3dig30,HowDidIEndUpOnReddit,2,Thu Jul 16 22:48:25 2015 UTC,"Why do you assume his schedule aims at releasing a video every single day? I don't think he's ever said that. It's your own fault if you assume that a video should go out even though Etho never said anything about it.  Also, I think you're underestimating the time it takes to make even a simple, ""unedited"" video. On top of the recording, you still have to make some cuts (Even if it's only the beginning and end of the recording), for some videos add an intro/outro, render the video (which can take a while), and then upload (which takes even longer with Etho's shitty canadian internet). It's perfectly understandable if he doesn't want to do it every single day."
ethoslab,3dig30,Grantus89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:15:15 2015 UTC,"i think youre just too ungrateful at that point then to call etho content a service.  hes mentioned time and again how he pushes both quality over quantity and him being able to have fun over anything else.   as much as etho puts in (and gets for it) id be willing to bet if he felt forced to do something he didnt enjoy as much then he wouldnt be doing it, despite the fanbase and i just cant fault him for that.  hes been putting in a lot more time to each ssp video and has had a lot of fun in ark/terraria so it doesnt seem like theres a need for him to tell us why he doesnt upload this or that. besides, hes already given us his reasoning if he uploads less of something and more of something else for a bit"
ethoslab,3dig30,Bunsan,0,Fri Jul 17 09:35:31 2015 UTC,"People keep saying quality over quantity, but for years now Etho has uploaded great videos basically one a day. Now Etho is uploading the same quality of videos but only getting them out about every other day so the equilibrium has changed. We are getting a net loss of quality content compared to the last few of years. If the quality had gone up then that would be fine but it hasn't. So if things are taking longer now, but not leading to significantly better videos then he should go back to his previous balance because it was better.  Now it there is a reason for that then fine, if Etho has stuff going on in his life, or lost motivation or whatever then thats fine. But i think he has a responsibility to his viewers to not leave them in the total dark, now again i'm not saying he has to divulge anything personal but some indication to his viewers that videos are going to slow down or not come out on a particular day is just the polite and respectful thing to do, otherwise the viewers just have to wait around wondering if we will get a video today or not.  And as for being ungrateful, Etho is not doing me or anyone a favour by producing videos its a two way relationship he makes videos and gets payed for it by me watching his videos and the adverts before them, I don't have to be grateful for that any more then i have to be grateful that a shop will sell me something."
ethoslab,3dig30,HowDidIEndUpOnReddit,5,Fri Jul 17 10:53:31 2015 UTC,"He has acknowledged it, and an obvious reason for his lack of LP is the time consuming nature of the projects he does in it, such as the nexus, which required him to spend multiple days on each episode containing it."
ethoslab,3dig30,Talon2863,2,Thu Jul 16 19:18:03 2015 UTC,"No he hasn't, there has been about 4 minecraft episodes in the last 3 weeks, and in none of them has he said a thing. Normally he uploads basically every day but for the last month or so it's been more like once every other day and he hasn't said a thing apart from saying he went away for a weekend, which he mentioned after, not before.  And as for time consuming projects that isn't an excuse, he has always done big projects and always put out a video a day, the quality of his videos has not significantly improved but the quantity has dropped. If he is spending too much time on a project then he should re-prioritise and do other things to get a video out."
ethoslab,3dig30,the_human_oreo,2,Thu Jul 16 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"He had an episode in which he discussed how many of his ongoing series involved a ton of behind the scenes work and that this was greatly effecting his upload rate. This was a good part of the reason he stopped his TFC series. He even asked for feedback about it. I believe this was the reason for some of the smaller minecraft map series, the expansion into other games and for a while the streaming of some of the grunt work. He also spoke about his enjoyment of Hearthstone and agar.io, which he said make poor YT content and that he had spent too much time on for a bit.   Sure none of this has been said in past few weeks, but if you keep up on his content I'm sure remembering back a few months isn't that hard.   I hope he starts streaming more again. Personally I'd love to see him do a live stream series of TFC with a small group."

It's rare if I give a game three months. When you're into a new game, it feels like there's billions of things to do, but when it gets old and stale, you struggle and eventually move on to other things. Etho can't do that because it's his job now.  I didn't think it was that few LP videos over the past five and a half weeks but I looked it up and you're right. I remember thinking, not long ago, that it was the LP he was posting too many of."

They'd prank on the server of course but they made much more Team Canada content in CTM map collabs (Ruins of the Mindcrackers I & II, Animosity).  It's actually pretty crazy. Beef's Animosity series was created on June 24, 2014 or over 1 year now. I think that's been the last ""full"" Team Canada series right now and every map playthrough from there on out has been Beef & Pause (From Flames, Diversity 1 & 2, Terra Restore) but no Etho. I want another Etho CTM map series soon :( I liked the Crypt Crawler series for example haha"

ethoslab,3dhhue,Valeriun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:17:01 2015 UTC,"Although one thing people tend to point out is that Etho could record a bunch of CTM episodes that a good amount of viewers enjoy for days without a ""normal"" (which means extremely high quality lol!) LP episode. The YouTuber's forced to record a CTM episode with 20-40m gameplay, otherwise you get too far ahead in an episode, compared to an LP episode which takes 6-10h and sometimes over a few days (dang it Etho, over-commitment issues!).  Etho literally just started Terraria 1.3 with Zisteau though lol. That comes out every 2 days and fills that ""low effort, high quantity"" content quite nicely. I'm hopeful for a CTM series after that's ended though :)"

ethoslab,3dhhue,torbray,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:38:24 2015 UTC,I'm sure all the extra views would be helpful... And why should they care about comments like that? Maybe they can do a Team Canada CTM at the same time too.
ethoslab,3dhhue,Kiwi_Gamer8060,2,Sat Jul 18 16:12:37 2015 UTC,"(Disclaimer: These are all my observations, not facts. I hope it provides a little insight into ""dead subs"".)  tl;dr - if Etho did prank videos, people would lose interest over time. YouTube would then see they watch less Etho and filter some of Etho out according to the viewer's watching habits. Etho then gets less views over all his videos because he appears less in people's subscription feeds.  The problem with only doing Minecrack pranks videos is it's not a sustainable series. I'm a small-time YouTuber and I've had a inactivity experience with my channel. In order to sustain any sort of healthy growth with your channel (in other words, high video ranking in YouTube searches), you need 2 somewhat similar but on the other hand highly different things:   You need to have traffic sources to your channel. Most YouTubers pursue this in terms of YouTube SEO (search engine optimization - changing descriptions/ titles/ tags for specific YouTube searches) although YT also ranks your video higher in search rankings if they came externally because you're bringing people to their site, therefore more ad revenue for them. For example, SkyDoesMinecraft's videos have higher search rankings because his username includes ""Minecraft"" whereas SethBling's videos grew from people coming from highly-upvoted Reddit posts on /r/Minecraft. More specific to this comment, you need to have high viewer engagement. In other words, your current sub base needs to keep returning to your videos. You need to have a high number of views for more YT ad revenue, high engagement through likes/ comments/ shares and the longer your viewers watch your video, the higher YT ranks your video because you're keeping YT's market on its site for longer.   How does this relate to returning to the Mindcrack server? There's a YouTube algorithm people think exists called ""viewer burn-out"" (made popular by Game Theory) which you might've heard people like Biffa talk about. The theory is that YouTube automatically filters a viewer's subscription feed according to what YouTubers they watch more/ less of because they earn money from a viewer who watches all of a few videos rather than a few of a lot of videos. For example, if I watch 100% of Etho but 40% of Beef but they released 5 videos in 1 week, YouTube may show me all 5 videos on Etho but only 2 videos of Beef. The theory with this is if the viewer is therefore more likely to watch to the end of the video and has more opportunities to be shown ads. One negative side-effect of this though is that when viewers start losing interest in an individual YouTuber's content, they begin being cut off from that YouTuber's content over time because of this filter.  To link this specifically back to ""Why not do one-off pranks on the Mindcrack server?"", the problem is that a viewer can't really invest in a prank series on Mindcrack. In the very beginning, I doubt there would be any negative effects apart from ""Why don't they return to the Mindcrack server?"" comments - there'd be high views, high watch times, a few laughs. Over time though, viewers would expect more from the series - an example of progress or some base building from Etho. This requires time on the Mindcrack server which he's addressed he's already done and burnt out on because he was mostly alone on the server. Then, worst of all, viewers would stop dropping off mid-point in the video because the viewers would start to expect ""just another prank video"" and the content would get repetitive.  Suddenly, Etho is in a dilemma. People are now skipping over the 1 extra Mindcrack prank video every week, they're now only watching 90% of Etho instead of 100% of Etho. He could invest into a proper Mindcrack series again but we know his opinion on that. Now, YouTube is filtering the prank-skipping viewers' sub feed occasionally and Etho appears less. Now, Etho gets less views. YouTube is like a rolling boulder - as long as you keep up the momentum, you will continue with steady growth. If you don't, you start to lose that attention no matter how hard you try - for example, AntVenom is not getting the views he technically should for 2.3mm subs. Biffa's channel is stagnant and is getting 1k views with a 100,000 subscriber channel because people have skipped so many of his videos. Etho's got some very very high engagement on his videos and he'd be risking a portion of that if he did Mindcrack prank videos.  These are things even I, such a small YouTuber and an ant compared to Etho's size of a channel, need to consider before starting a new series - would people be engaged by it? Would people watch it long-term? Would people be more likely to watch an episode the whole way through? This stuff is so incredibly important for someone like Etho."
ethoslab,3dhhue,torbray,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:52:02 2015 UTC,I don't think people are talking about him making a series of it. But occasionally joining them for prank videos.  I think you underestimate how popular Team Canada pranks were.  A few videos randomly across the year is not going to have some crazy devastating effect.
ethoslab,3dhhue,K_nikk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:52:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was kinda what I was thinking when I said they should do a few pranks every now and then. And maybe the server will become popular enough with 1.9 that Etho will do a few base building videos and stuff like that on the midcrack server as well. Like not a tone, but a few per month/year."
ethoslab,3dhhue,Kiwi_Gamer8060,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like that he is using Hermitcraft for his SMP base building.  I think the blend of youtubers there with their building skills, and redstone skills, and projects would provide him with greater inspiration for building.  I think Mindcrack's strength over Hermitcraft has been his interactions with the others that allows him to be a little evil (pranks, anvil kills, being a goof, death games).  It was just the right blend of personalities to allow a little harmless animosity/rivalry.  So if he can take advantage of that it would be best of both worlds.    However, torbray has made a good point in a previous post that even one episode of that and you would have people complaining every week after ""when is the next prank!"" - another reason why the whole complaining about his schedule bugs me - we lose out on potential good stuff because Etho knows his fans might complain about lack of the stuff they do want, or complain if the new content doesn't get more episodes, etc."

Although Etho didn't display any interest in it outwardly (he may have been lurking), maybe your post and the ideas in it might be more to his liking. Who knows?  Edit: As I posted this I got an idea. Something that might be fun is to have small command block contraptions (like Etho's mad bomber challenge) that could be speed challenges of some sort, that added something the game doesn't normally have. I'm command block savvy (more or less) and I could make them if Etho and his viewers are interested."

It clocked in at a lot longer than Etho's normal speed challenges but I think the quickest I got it down to was about four hours.  Anyway, what I had to do was start a new world and discover ten spawners. For each spawner I tunnelled to the surface and built a tall tower with a big coloured wool number at the top of it as a monument. After I had discovered ten spawners, I then had to get to, and kill, the Enderdragon.  So what this meant, was a lot of caving, farming sheep for wool, finding ten different coloured dyes, collecting enough ender pearls and blaze powder to find and activate the end portal, and enchant gear good enough to kill the dragon.  The caving bit would probably make it unsuitable for Youtube because viewers don't seem to like caving much, but it's a nice little quest if you've got a few hours spare and don't know what to do."

Especially when you or the video producer is under-geared and you've gone from a bit of resource gathering to trying to find your way out alive! I use to get lost so much in the old days. Most of the time if they do caving on videos they do Abba rules or something where it's super fast rather than slow and careful like you get in UHCs. Hopefully with the new combat stuff coming in the new patch, adventuring will be fun once again."

ethoslab,3czb46,timeddilation,34,Sun Jul 12 03:39:41 2015 UTC,"Etho, I hope you get to see this, because I need to point out to you a major design flaw in your system, and you're not going to be happy about it.  I discovered that dropping the items into the ice, and having them pushed up into the ice stream result in item loss at a rate of about 2-4/64. Occasionally, the items glitch through completely and end up somewhere random. I flipped the droppers around so they're front-facing, and added additional storage space.  Love you videos, you inspire a lot of my minecrafting."
ethoslab,3czb46,ThimbleStudios,6,Sun Jul 12 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"Items ""spitting"" into ice blocks is a very random chance operation, droppers rotate the angle at which the items are projected, and depending on that, coupled with the fact that when an items is floating its way out of a block it can move in any of four directions... this is defiantly not a 100% chance reliable operation. You are correct in saying the items could glitch past the ice stream, or end up outside the desired location. I have found it is always preferable to spit the items against a solid confinement area, then sweep them away from below. Good work btw, for debugging this one."

ethoslab,3czb46,jubale,5,Sun Jul 12 16:53:06 2015 UTC,They build it because they like it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. They fix it because it's broken. They share the fix because that's helpful.

ethoslab,3czb46,K_nikk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:27:29 2015 UTC,I guess sort of like back seat gaming in a way?  Suggesting an idea or inspiration or fix  is one thing probably where it can be tweaked into his own design. Finishing something he's working on before he can do it himself feels a little different.   Edit to add:  he has asked for ideas on minecart bases in one of his early hermitcraft episodes - I think something like hoping people would build alongside and see what they come up with. I really thought we'd see a lot of designs on here for that. Maybe that is something the community could do if people want to build things to help him and inspire him at same time. Aside from some interchange rails posts I haven't seen much else.

Which tells me they adapt their level of play to the level of difficulty - and they would underplay at times to keep it interesting.    So I'm curious, now that we are 4 episodes in - does it seem like Etho and Z are changing up their game play style to match the higher difficulty in contrast to how they played in 1.2 or even earlier this series?  I know they are still missing some things that people in the comments appear to know about (related to new(ish) mechanics and items) but just in general play style have people already started to see that kind of adaptation?  I'm not familiar enough with the game to recognize changes in style."
ethoslab,3covuw,K_nikk,7,Fri Jul 10 00:29:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, the biggest challenges presented by expert mode are the bosses, and they haven't fought any yet.  I imagine the first time they fight a boss will be a rude awakening and then they will step up their game."

I'm not sure either one could be as willing to derp it up with anyone else except each other. Them playing over their head will give them opportunities to show each other up, which will, in turn, cause more derp moments, which is the train-wreck that everyone is waiting to see! I have the utmost confidence in EZed. The series will be interesting and entertaining no matter how long it takes them to master it."

ethoslab,3clz8z,K_nikk,7,Thu Jul 9 22:20:51 2015 UTC,"And, it was appreciated! :-) To carry this conversation further. I think Etho sometimes has some small trouble with co-labs with people. He's ""Etho"" and that can affect how people react. The most telling example of this was on the Mindcrack server, when Guude and Bdubs were wanting to make a zombie spawner trap and they had Etho come by to help.  (a classic episode.) This was the first time these guys worked together other than in passing in a ""RFW"". Zisteau gets some of the same kind of behavior from people, I'd imagine, as well, but he just pushes through it. He is a very dominant force. The two of them together work to embolden Etho (as a defense against Zisteau) and soften Zisteau a bit. You get Etho playing pranks on Z (something I don't think many would have the balls to do) and you get Zisteau telling Etho how to do things, (something I don't think many would have the balls to do) The combination really, REALLY works well and is very entertaining."
ethoslab,3clz8z,NobodySpecial999,3,Thu Jul 9 23:03:20 2015 UTC,"Edit - I essentially said a page of stuff that was just stream of consciousness.  No one needs to read my stream of conscience.  Enjoying the interactions, for what I realize is basically they reasons you mention.  [Now that I deleted my post - ruins context for the reply below.  To correct that, here is the summary:  Embolden was the key word.  Zisteau's self confidence is so strong it steam rolls (in a good way), whereas Etho's is more accommodating.  When collaborating with people who are less confident, Etho tones himself down to not overshadow/overwhelm them and let them lead - which can be awkward if that person isn't sure how to/wasn't expecting to lead.  When with people with a lot of confidence who are able to carry the collab, he can loosen up and be more himself and plays off them, but accommodates their direction and restrains himself from overtaking them.  With Zisteau, not only is he able to be even more free, but also is challenged to try and one-up him, because Zisteau doesn't need accommodating and seems happy with a bit of rivalry.  Those were my clumsy thoughts that I felt embarrassed about after I posted them and deleted them right away.  They're an overly simplified observation, but was fun to think about in the context of understanding why this particular match up is so satisfying to watch]"
ethoslab,3clz8z,K_nikk,3,Fri Jul 10 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, yep... you're right on target. And you brought up some things I didn't consider.... Etho is accommodating. That's exactly it. I was thinking about when he and Doc work together, which you would think would be similar to Etho and Zisteau. I mean, Doc is as forward as a guy can be. Super-confident. But his style is to lead and Etho tends to accommodate in those circumstances when he should be leading. This causes what seems like somewhat awkward moments, (and spawned the infamous ""Get to the Dang land, man."") Z seems more cognizant of these things. He knows when to speak up and when to tease and when to shut up. He knows Etho is a completely capable player and he doesn't need to constantly ""lead"" him around. He doesn't force Etho to accommodate. I think this comes mainly from Zisteau's long experience of playing very hard things on his own. CTM maps and such. But also, I just think it's his way of doing things. Think back to Life on Bogota. Those guys who played with him were real life friends. Guys who were not at all as dedicated to the series as Zisteau was. Sure, they had fun together and their shows were very entertaining, but when something needed to get done, Zisteau just did it. If you were one of the other guys and you didn't like it then too bad. You should have done it yourself. It's that mindset that let's Etho and Zisteau kid around with each other while still moving the game forward."
ethoslab,3clz8z,NobodySpecial999,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:59:50 2015 UTC,Just watched old BDubs episodes from early Mindcrack where they are building the skeleton trap (Mindcrack Server - Episode 9 and Mindcrack Server - Episode 10 on BdoubleO100's channel - less edited).

ethoslab,3clz8z,DMonitor,5,Wed Jul 8 23:25:15 2015 UTC,"That was Minecraft though. This is Terraria. While I don't doubt that they can, it will take forever and be extremely frustrating for them. In MC, you can just grind for the best gear and come out okay. In Terraria, there are brick walls that you face and the only way to beat them is with skill.  Their expert mode will eventually dissolve into cheesing all the bosses, or at least that's my prediction.  If things ever go too bad, they can always just create a new world anyway."
ethoslab,3clz8z,K_nikk,3,Thu Jul 9 02:49:16 2015 UTC,I'm really curious to know how bad expert mode gets.  Do you know any good videos on youtube of players in expert mode which show the combination of level of difficulty with the skill required to overcome it?

I notice for most of the fight he stays at quite high health and is using primarily two weapons (melee) and heavily reliant on a well planned, well timed, efficient potion/buff hot-key schedule.  Certainly EZ doesn't have this skill yet, but does look like something they can learn eventually, or atleast do with adding the benefit of ranged weapons and losing a bit more life.  Do bosses get harder for multiplayer?"
ethoslab,3clz8z,DMonitor,3,Thu Jul 9 03:20:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Their health scales with the number of players, but the wiki does not specify by how much.   If they can get good enough gear, I think they can beat this game. The potions are going to be important for them."

ethoslab,3clz8z,Xanthelei,8,Thu Jul 9 05:09:42 2015 UTC,"I more consider the fact they're messing up so much to be a challenge to them, based on how they've reacted so far, which hopefully means it'll be going a lot longer than if they weren't playing expert."
ethoslab,3clz8z,DragonGodGrapha,-1,Thu Jul 9 00:30:03 2015 UTC,But what I'm afraid of is that they won't even be able to progress through the game.

ethoslab,3clz8z,Dead_Moss,2,Thu Jul 9 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling if they run into major trouble they'll switch to a lesser difficulty, relearn the game, then come back to expert and demolish their current world.

Just look at all the Super Hostile maps they've conquered, including some of the rom-hack-hard sections."

He keeps a jar of each essence full near the altar and has a computer set up in the basement to re-fill them and see their status etc.  Also, you should consider using at least alumentum to fuel the alembic since that breaks the goop into pure essentia faster. Also, arcane bellows speed it up as well.  I would link to the relevant episode but it's spread around several episodes since he's tweaked it, but it starts in Episode 57. You can start looking from there.  Or if someone has made a replicated tutorial for it, feel free to link that as well."

ethoslab,3bwzkb,morgoth95,2,Fri Jul 3 09:28:28 2015 UTC,"/u/ethoslab to address the issue with providing pressure to the aerial interface without explosions, the pressure gauge maxes its redstone output (15) at 7.5 bar since its output is (2 x Pressure) making it kind of useless. The best suggestion I have seen is to use a redstone timer to turn on the compressor at regular intervals and use security upgrades to release the pressure if it gets too high. I think you might be able to use regulators somehow as well"

ethoslab,3bwzkb,ultradolp,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:05:32 2015 UTC,Golem is pretty easy to setup for automation. The trick though is that it can easily bump into walls/obstacles and stray away.

ethoslab,3bwzkb,TobiasCB,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:04:42 2015 UTC,So I put together a setup at my essentia jar room: http://imgur.com/a/9WTNV#0. Nothing too fancy. This is the newish setup (almost three months ago I made it). There was an older one which also connect to the crucible but ultimately I ditch it because I changed the whole storage. Feel free to ask any question about the setup.
ethoslab,3bxq9j,Open_flame67,17,Fri Jul 3 00:49:11 2015 UTC,"Well, that's impossible, because that would require Pause playing Minecraft /s  But seriously, with Terraria is EZ being thrown into the mix, Etho will have five active series: vanilla singleplayer, modded singleplayer, Hermitcraft, ARK Survival, and Terraria.  I'm not sure how many series Pause and Beef have, but I think that throwing another series into the mix at this moment is a very bad idea."
ethoslab,3bxq9j,rock_buster,2,Fri Jul 3 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"It would still be sweet to see Team Canada make a return at some point. Sure not now, but some time in the future, maybe when he finishes ARK or Terraria."

ethoslab,3btu0f,EdgeDomination,2,Thu Jul 2 03:12:35 2015 UTC,"Nice!  130 in 2 weeks overall (ARK primarily I presume at the moment) still pretty decent.  I only go to work 80 hours over the same period of time. I like that the stuff he chooses to do videos for, he really goes for.  It shows in how capable he is in a game right at the first video of a series - he's invested the time needed to get to that level - and his capability is a huge draw for me."
ethoslab,3btu0f,K_nikk,8,Thu Jul 2 03:21:05 2015 UTC,I think it would be awesome if Minecraft counted hours like steam does. I think Etho likely has put in 10k hours and that really does show his commitment for quality videos.

ethoslab,3btt2e,Boingboingsplat,18,Thu Jul 2 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"I have opposite reaction to his series, I mean it is good to see Etho play other games, but I would have hoped more Hearthstone etc.  Ark itself looks horrendeous, UI, land, characters ( even if made look natural ) and so on.   Everything in-game looks just a mess, and I can't really get into."
ethoslab,3btt2e,Miguli,9,Thu Jul 2 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"UI (temporary, work in progress), Land (what do you mean specifically?), characters (well here i agree on you, why do they give people the ability to look like that?).  However eventhough there are some flaws, it still is an interesting experience, and it fits with etho's playstyle aswell. Whereas hearthstone that doesn't suit etho that much. Atleast compared to his other content. It is comparable to lets say being a channel for adults, and then suddenly you decide to make content for 12 year old girls. Your subscribers wouldn't want to watch that."
ethoslab,3btt2e,Impuredeath,6,Thu Jul 2 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"I do enjoy the series, but I completely agree that the UI in the game is just bad. I hope they improve that over time. It is, after all, an early access game."

ethoslab,3bptlj,K_nikk,3,Wed Jul 1 11:50:54 2015 UTC,"My aunt lives in Arizona and I'm currently residing in Florida. There is a definite difference between dry heat and the high humidity heat of Florida and other areas. Dry heat can be obviously uncomfortable, but I never found it really bad. I didn't really sweat much considering it was 115F, but here in Florida, an 80F day can leave you drenched in sweat just from sitting outside in the shade. There is a huge difference, and some people try to write that off as BS, but sorry, it's not.  I'm also originally from the North, so I really do understand the difference between people who are used to the cold vs used to the heat. I've dealt with the changes first hand. When I first moved here at age 16, 50F weather was warm to me and I could easily wear shorts. Now that I'm used to the heat though at 50F I'm shivering cold. Your body naturally adapts to your local temperature over time. Etho living in Canada has him used to the cold like I used to be, where I could keep my jacket open at 0F and not be cold. But 86F (30C) for someone who is not only not used to it, but also doesn't even have AC is just ridiculously hot."

EDIT: Didn't notice your edit! Yes, whenever I think of Kakashi I think of him with Etho's voice for some reason... Thank you very much my good friend!"
ethoslab,3bn2ev,Linked_Up,2,Tue Jun 30 23:28:28 2015 UTC,Aw man that's a shame. Do you think he'll be invited to UHC as a special guest for fun one time?  I kinda wish Etho was the voice actor for Kakashi in the English dub.  EDIT: I'm kinda watching and it looks good but I'm not gonna make an account.

I really don't want to take that away from him just because I have nothing better to do with my life than to wait for him to upload. Some may think it's his responsibility to upload daily, (to an extent it is) but it actually isn't.  I think we often fail to consider the possibility of him having to deal with personal issues. Maybe he got another job, or just wants to take it easy for a month. Maybe he's dedicating more time to his family or a SO. He probably would never share something like that with us, which is completely fine.  He very VERY rarely takes a vacation, so I think it's fine if he just takes some time off and focus on other things for a month or two."
ethoslab,3bfzcv,Dobert,3,Sun Jun 28 23:13:32 2015 UTC,Came here to say exactly this. There's no reason to complain- Etho is only human and has a life outside of YouTube.
ethoslab,3bfzcv,grant_gravity,2,Mon Jun 29 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"has a life outside of YouTube.    Many people would find this hard to believe, but I assure you, it is true"
ethoslab,3bfzcv,jrhjr9375,3,Thu Jul 2 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I think it's definitely not unreasonable to ask that he at least keep us up to date. As much as a tweet saying he's taking a short break would be enough for me. I don't really need to know how long; just that the gap in video uploads is intentional. I can respect that. Everyone needs a break."
ethoslab,3bfzcv,ZykeP,10,Mon Jun 29 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"Agar.io, hearthstone as well as ark also he binged watched a series (destiny? I can't remember) and has been out of town. Anyway he has been busy maybe a little burnt-out (he also spent two days working on the Nexus).  The terraria 1.3 update comes out tomorrow so expect some episodes of that.  Just be grateful when an episode does come out feeling entitled to content is just the wrong mentality to have."
ethoslab,3bfzcv,jugemscloudmc,5,Sun Jun 28 22:54:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think OP comes across as ungrateful- it's precisely why it makes them sad instead of ""angry"" to see fewer videos.  Etho and his videos are something that make OP and a lot of people really happy and knowing they could one day stop is scary (let's hope it's not for a very long time)."
ethoslab,3bfzcv,BlueCyann,2,Sun Jun 28 23:49:50 2015 UTC,Exactly!
ethoslab,3bfzcv,Twiggy02,2,Mon Jun 29 05:09:26 2015 UTC,I'm not ungrateful nor entitled; I just like to know what's going on and whether the gap in video uploads is intentional or not.

ethoslab,3bfzcv,geulach,9,Mon Jun 29 05:09:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not watching him as much as I used to, the inconsistency is killing me.  I have a list of Youtubers a mile long that this has happened with, and I hate to see it happening with Etho too, but it is.  When my favorite content doesn't turn up for over a week sometimes, eventually I just stop looking.  It's his job, his decision, I'm sure he's not blind to how it affects his view count.  Nothing I can do about it but whine every once in a while.  I will watch the upcoming Terraria for sure -- not least because it's certain to be uploaded regularly!"
ethoslab,3bfzcv,Grantus89,3,Mon Jun 29 11:20:19 2015 UTC,"In the past 3 weeks hes not had a week where he releases more than 3 episodes. Maybe this is the new schedule? I kinda hope not. Regardless, Id recommend checking out some other channels (Xisuma, Mumbo, Zisteauetc) and see if you like them. If you do, till be like Ethos schedule became more regular, but that he tampered with his mic and become a tea-drinker!"

ethoslab,3bfzcv,Lordthom,3,Mon Jun 29 01:00:23 2015 UTC,"The worst part in my opinion is the fact that he doesn't let the viewers know at all.   For example the other week he said that he had gone away for the weekend which was why there weren't any videos, but he said it afterwards, if he had mentioned that before hand in a video or even just sent a tweet, then expectations would be set.  I think viewers are understanding enough to know that stuff happens but if we aren't told anything then people are going to get restless and lose interest."
ethoslab,3bfzcv,Dave_lol,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"Just speculation tho I believe the reason for this is due to security and privacy, some people know where he lives and have come to his door -I don't believe he has moved, although he did mention it a year ago.   Announcing to hundreds of thousands of people your house will be empty just seems like a bad idea."

I really just wanted to try using a cool technique that I recently learned. Maybe I'll figure out a better logo later, but I don't think Etho or many of his subscribers would be interested in a new logo despite how compacted the current one is.  So if you are really curious, you can check it out here, and I'll put it back on the post so future readers can see it in all its terrible glory... :P"

However I do remember there was a problem with getting the brewing going. I think you have to put water bottles in the brewing stand before you activate the system. Once the brewing has started it should continue without any problems until all the resources are converted into potions.

I was reinstated by the skin of my teeth: my appeal was actually denied and I spent a day thinking that was it until somebody must have changed their mind and given me another chance.  Though I didn't talk about it in my appeal because I didn't think it would help, like you I believe that kind of insult is incredibly hurtful and demeaning, and I hate seeing it anywhere, much less in a place I want to be a part of.  If it hadn't bothered me, I wouldn't have said anything and would not have been banned.  Lesson learned: sometimes the word itself is enough no matter how it's used, and be smarter in the future.

ethoslab,3as8p2,TheFrunj,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:04:39 2015 UTC,"I tweeted to Etho a day or so ago with what I think is exactly the problem:  ""@EthoLP SSD Space Problem - I had it, Windows Indexing Service took up my entire drive. Disable or delete the index to refresh or fix.""  Freed up a huge amount of space that no other cleanup process could even see."
ethoslab,3as8p2,Tetrajak,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:07:40 2015 UTC,"As mentioned by /u/FHR123, use CCLeaner to free up diskspace; it removes temporary files which are usually cause your OS drive/partition to fill up.  I also recommend that Etho install all his programs onto his HDD instead, including things like web browers or any other software that would otherwise sit under C:\Program Files\ ."
ethoslab,3as8p2,FHR123,2,Tue Jun 23 21:17:27 2015 UTC,Nope. Browser and those frequently used apps got to stay on SSD. That's the whole purpose of the SSD.
ethoslab,3as8p2,Tetrajak,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree, especially since Etho's SSD is only 100GB. The only things that need to be on his SSD are those which run all the time (OS, obviously), or those that struggle to run fast enough on the HDD. If he had a bigger SSD it wouldn't be a problem, but I don't imagine he'll get one and use it anytime soon."
ethoslab,3as8p2,FHR123,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:04:02 2015 UTC,"And you don't run browser all the time? You are weird :) When I had Windows 7 on my SSD (Crucial M4; 128GB) I had my frequently used apps, including browser on that SSD. Even some games fitted there. Minecraft, Mass Effect 3. I still had some free space (20gigs IIRC).    BTW: Now I have Linux on my SSD. Everything but movies is on SSD. I got 80GB of free space. System boots in 5 seconds (cold boot)."
ethoslab,3as8p2,Tetrajak,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:02:20 2015 UTC,"I've got a 256GB SSD and I certainly run my browser and other common programs from that drive, but all my games sit on my 2TB HDD, as Windows 8 takes up a decent size on the SSD. However, what I'm talking about in my first reply is my recommendations for Etho, not how I personally manage my drives."
ethoslab,3as8p2,rusins,0,Thu Jun 25 20:55:36 2015 UTC,"He mentioned that his Windows installation takes up 60 GB alone. Is this normal? (Linux user here, I wouldn't really know.)  Another fact to keep in mind, is that because of how SSDs work, it is best to keep a few GB free for efficiency. (5-10 should be ok, but the 1GB left currently is not)"
ethoslab,3as8p2,masozravapalma,2,Tue Jun 23 11:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yes Windows do need as much space. 40-60 GB is relatively normal. It looks silly compared to standard Linux install, where I give 20GB for / (while having /home and /usr on separate filesystem) and have almost no chance of filling it up And the core system in /boot 200Mb is enough for several versions of kernel..."
ethoslab,3as8p2,Neamow,0,Tue Jun 23 16:29:56 2015 UTC,No it's not. My 2 year old installation is barely over 30 GB.

ethoslab,3apail,Impuredeath,4,Mon Jun 22 13:02:36 2015 UTC,"Well, from the fact that he needs the nexus to store everything in Minecraft - yeah, kinda."
ethoslab,3apail,FredFS456,13,Mon Jun 22 19:54:10 2015 UTC,It takes him a while to truly switch things. When he bought his new PC it took a while for him to actually start using it

On the other hand, there has been a slight artifact in the sound (maybe once per episode) that sounds like a buzzing, and it only started after Etho got his new mic.

ethoslab,3amn3v,Unrealdinnerbone,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:01:41 2015 UTC,I say Etho makes a secondary channel that is for him to be less family friendly and more adult.

They are similiar in their vocabulary choices, but actual content can vary, as their main series' are redstone showcases and more infrequently Hermitcraft and GM4. Regardless, taking a couple of hours to search for yourself will probably give you some good results, as everyone likes different things and perhaps a YTer mentioned in this thread has a small quirk which most people are fine with but you may find irritating."

So the things he is doing feels new and are entertaining to me. I have also started watching Xisumavoid regularly, including the videos of his livestreams.  They are obviously very different, but something about him just fell into place nicely for me in comparison with Etho's content.  He has been satisfying my craving for random/spontaneous multiplayer content - especially from his livestreams on hermitcraft.  (My grammar is terrible in this post - really having trouble trying to summarize)."
ethoslab,3akw5m,K_nikk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:52:13 2015 UTC,I'd agree with most people that there would be none. Still...some time before I even found etho's channel I was quite the monkeyfarm fan. He has an equally calm voice (I usually don't enjoy youtubers who yell at every possible opportunity) and usually tries to build technical stuff while making it aesthetically pleasing. I just don't know what he's doing right now because I haven't had the time to follow multiple channels lately.
ethoslab,3akw5m,shjzo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:20:27 2015 UTC,So from what I understand the hermitcraft members are the best place to start? I'm looking for a minecraft youtuber that is able to create the same level of technical minecraft creations and quality.  I am less concerned with commentary although I do really like etho's.  If any one knows of youtubers who fit this description I would love to know! Thanks for all the suggestions by the way!
ethoslab,3akw5m,K_nikk,2,Sun Jun 21 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"I think people have given you a lot of examples to start out with that would fit that narrower definition.  Some that come to mind would be tango tek for his Iron Giant or Boom Box, or Ruse game, ImpulseSV has a wither tree farm (not sure if he came up with it),  Xisumavoid has come up with a lot of passive mob farming over several iterations of minecraft.  Start checking them out.  Once you have looked into a few, it'd be great to hear what you think."

His is maybe the best one out there, along with Slipg8r. Biffa is a Brit, like Xsuma, but he has a pretty soothing voice and great sense of humor. He likes to do pranks and is also completely family friendly. Give 'em both a shot. :-)"

ethoslab,3afqsf,frogyurt,2,Fri Jun 19 19:43:06 2015 UTC,I feel that the real issue is that he might just not have time. He spends hours off camera for every episode of Minecraft and with Terraria 1.3 coming soon and the ARK series starting I do not know how he would manage it all.
ethoslab,3afqsf,SquaredCubed,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:26:52 2015 UTC,"Actually trying a new game would probably help out with this if it has less grinding, and more of something that he can just sit down and start recording. Never played Titan Quest so I don't know if that's the case with this, but he should definitely try it if he feels like it."

ethoslab,3a94ma,Antice,10,Thu Jun 18 11:39:40 2015 UTC,"ARK actually has a lot of content already. There are loads of things to explore and do. new stuff is being added more or less daily at this point in time, so I think you are a bit too pessimistic about the number of episodes Etho can get out of this.  The only worry I have is that the content he does get is not family friendly enough for his channel. I really don't want to see this series go the way of the fly boys, but If this series ends early, that is going to be the reason. not a lack of content to show off."

It's also easy to recognize creativity within the game due to familiarity.  GB is a very creative individual and he shines with minecraft.  It's less obvious with games like stranded deep. At that point it's all about personality. Which is fine, GB seems like a cool guy, but many of us watching want to be able to easily recognize the creative parts.  That's for me though, it may be a completely different set of reasons for you."
ethoslab,3a94ma,joaopms,5,Thu Jun 18 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"Well... I discovered Minecraft and LP's when I was in college, and I enjoyed the laid back air of getting onto a server with a group of your friends and building anything and everything. I like to watch LPs to see talented people build beautiful stuff. I really like players like Etho and Bdubs and Doc who break it down, 'show their hand' as it were. It's taking something very simple and creating complex things.  With these other survival games it seems like it's taking something complex (the graphics, supplies, animals, etc.) and making something simple (whatever those thatch shacks I've seen in both Stranded Deep and Ark are.)   Of course the commentary and personality are really important. I've tried watching a lot of youtubers and I just keep coming back to the same four or five individuals. At this point I've been following Etho for at least three years, and in a way feel something of a connection, sorta."
ethoslab,3a94ma,Antice,2,Thu Jun 18 17:20:05 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference between minecraft and other survival games. the focus in minecraft is creative building, making contraptions out of blocks and redstone and so on, while in Ark,Rust,the forest and other games like that, it is survival that is at the forefront. buildings become just a means to an end then, and how they look becomes less important.  Terraria got some of that minecraft magic going on, and so does space engineers (albeit a little less so). There are a couple of titles out there who might be able to get some of that minecrafty feel ported onto a more visually appealing platform, but meh. it will never be the same tho, it will just be prettied up clones for the most part, nothing that can really replace the original."

I do think the chicken is being sucked through the ground though.  Not 100% sure why it has to come up inside the camp - unless it has something to do with the feeder or needing an incline for the momentum."
ethoslab,3a3y5x,K_nikk,6,Wed Jun 17 03:08:15 2015 UTC,"About the thaumcraft base, there is actually quite a lot of thing to make the process of crafting/infusion easier, depending on how far down in the research tree you are. (Spoiler of thaumcraft research)  The first priority in my opinion is to sort out the wand recharging aspect as it is very crucial for automation. Energized nodes allow you to provide essentia from node directly to your devices without needing any manual interference. It allows you to Recharge wands through vis relays, speed up crystalizer significantly using terra vis, speed up infernal furnace significantly using ignitis vis, and provide aer vis for absorbing those purple goo during infusion. All you need are Node stablizer and Node energizer. You don't need the advanced version if you have grown the node before flipping the switch on. Do note that once you have switched on, don't switch off the devices unless you want to Loss your node or blow up your space in magical style.  For infusion it is probably easier to have all essentia jar put in one place nicely and have a pair of Essentia mirror linked together. My old thaumcraft base design uses the crystalized essentia at first and only put in the exact amount in the furnance to produce the exact amount of essentia. However, I run into trouble when instability kick in for more difficult infusion, in which one of the effect is increase the essentia required for the infusion, making it troublesome as you will need to constantly add in the additional essentia or putting in little excess in the beginning, usually 1 or 2 is enough if you have thing to stablize the process. So I still recommend going for the jar approach rather than the crystalizer approach.  Finally, there is a way of enchanting in thaumcraft. It allows you to add in desired enchantment at the cost of essentia, your level (much cheaper than going for a blind level 30 enchant) and material (on a bit expensive side, especially requiring the balanced shard). So you can tailor made your own equipment."
ethoslab,3a3y5x,ultradolp,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:35:52 2015 UTC,"I found my favorite 'set it and forget it' system for essentia jars was using golems with the alchemy core to fill void jars. That way no messy pipes are needed and you only need one jar per aspect. The only problem I ran into was when I tried to infuse something that requires more than 64 essentia in the recipe.  Also, Etho should probably use the ceiling there for crystal clusters, candles and heads for infusion stability. (The best source of info I found on instability was here.) Otherwise, when he tries more complicated recipes he is gonna have a bad time."
ethoslab,3a3y5x,Crayon_in_my_brain,2,Wed Jun 17 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"Also, you don't need to use the ceiling for stability items, as you can pack way more than is ever necessary into the floor beneath the altar and never have to see them."

ethoslab,3a3y5x,ultradolp,2,Wed Jun 17 16:31:59 2015 UTC,If he wants to not have to refill wands as for this machine he should consider crafting a wand with a Blaze rod as the core. That can regenerate a small amount of ignis vis automatically.

I do agree with him, perhaps Etho shouldve just dropped a tweet to say hes out of town, but it was the manner he went about saying it and the wording he used which I thought wasnt apprropriate for this subreddit. Apologies if I misinterpreted what was being said or how it was being said."
ethoslab,3a2uhw,Twiggy02,2,Tue Jun 16 21:18:14 2015 UTC,"i Don't think you need to apologize for the downvote or misinterpretation.  The post was ambiguous at best.  I interpreted it as well as someone complaining about Etho not giving advance notice in a thread where Etho IS giving advance notice.  Then I thought maybe he/she was being sarcastic about the people complaining about Etho not giving notice about what he does day-to-day when we already know Etho doesn't post daily, but with no /s to indicate it was sarcasm.  That made it difficult to understand the meaning - and therefore was not useful.  Turns out it was neither of those two and it was actually about Etho not giving advance notice that he would be out of town and therefore not to expect an episode for a few days.  Whatever the case, it was ambiguous from the start and when you can't make out the point of a comment it doesn't bring much to the discussion.  The downvotes alerted poster that his comment was not clear, and he/she came back to clear it up, and I think that is a good and helpful outcome of downvoting.      With regards to whether Etho should have given advanced notice of being out of town - I think this would be unneccesary.  We already know that Etho does not have a daily schedule -  in fact his pattern is 2 - 4 days between episodes for the past few weeks on average.  Him posting today puts him within that schedule, so his heads-up was actually more notice than we should have expected.  If he was going to be out of town for longer than 4 days - then I would say it is breaking his quasi-schedule and maybe a headsup would be nice.  Those are my two cents."

ethoslab,39wp0g,BlueCyann,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:04:33 2015 UTC,"CTM stands for complete the monument, and it's a type of survival challenge map where you collect blocks (generally different colored wool and refined ore blocks) to place on a victory monument. After you've collected all the required blocks and placed them on the monument, you win. As an example, Vechs's Super Hostile maps are probably the most well known CTM maps.  OOGE is an abbreviation of BDoubleO, Guude, and Etho, and they teamed up to do several CTM maps together."

(Legendary, for instance.)  The one he did of Spellbound Caves (after he'd already played the map with Guude and BdoubleO) is short (3 or 4 episodes) and unique in it being a map he'd played before that he was just trying to get through as fast as he could, but might give you an idea of the genre without too much time investment.  Also a few with VintageBeef and PauseUnpause -- not my personal favorites usually but lots of people like them."

I don't think he has, but I've seen a number of people mentioning that it's related to mobile (possibly a bug, not sure, I don't use mobile).   Is there any other way Etho communicates with his viewers?    He's usually semi-active on here or Twitter.   Why exactly did Etho split from Mindcrack?   He wasn't comfortable with signing contracts when Mindcrack expanded into a legal entity.   What's he been up to lately?   Pretty much the same as always. Slightly more variety as of late, but that's not a bad thing."

ethoslab,39tu0c,skaplo98,6,Sun Jun 14 18:50:14 2015 UTC,Etho did not raise money he just want to thank the old donation from when he was a small You Tuber by making the donation tree place look better.

ethoslab,39tu0c,HelloitsAntonio,3,Sun Jun 14 18:59:11 2015 UTC,He didn't. I think the guy was confused about the donation post. A fan tallied up how much Etho got from donations.

ethoslab,39mbi4,QuiteSoIndeed,6,Fri Jun 12 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"He did live stream his grind work for a while, but commented that it wasn't really as efficient for him, he would procrastinate and talk to chat instead of doing the tasks and so probably stopped streaming it for the same reason (or just hasn't been in the mood since). He does do some filler-ish stuff on Hermitcraft, interacting with other people and such. I think that's good enough.   I don't really think his channel should put up 'filler' episodes with less content or less of an entertainment value. He just can't upload stuff 24/7, he does other stuff too."
ethoslab,39mbi4,Nirogunner,3,Fri Jun 12 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the positive feedback! His videos in the past 3 weeks have been a little inconsistant. Perhaps something like Crypt Crawler would be appropriate as filler content, as it still entertained the masses"

ethoslab,39mbi4,_Draven_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:51:52 2015 UTC,"I did the math, if we assume he works 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, then his videos account for less than 3% of his work time. If we're a bit harsher and make him accountable for all of his waking hours (assuming 8 hours sleep per night) then his videos account for just over 1% of his waking hours.  Etho is definitely in a slump."
ethoslab,39mbi4,revereddesecration,3,Sat Jun 13 06:09:05 2015 UTC,"He has provided exact, anecdotal numbers on occasion.  The video length vs recording time varies greatly depending on series and project, but he has said that a typical Let's Play episode definitely costs him 8+ (in fact, from memory he said something like 9-12) hours of his effort to record, edit, and post.  Some series are far less time consuming - for example, the Crypt Crawler series would have been near 1:1 record time.  The thing is, his video quality is a direct result of the time he puts into each episode, which is exactly why he has all of these fans.  Sure, some folks would be ok with a drop in quality in exchange for more quantity, but since high-effort high-quality is what made his channel what it is today, you can't really blame him for sticking with it."
ethoslab,39mbi4,_Draven_,2,Tue Jun 16 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"Well, you're not factoring in grind work and editing, but I agree, he's not as into it as much as usual. I can understand feeling burnt out though. He should really get into other games or somethin."
ethoslab,39mbi4,Fort_Colorcastle,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:29:15 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is, if he is working constantly then he is spending at least 30 times as much time on grinding/editing than recording actual content. I just don't believe that could possibly be the case. He's avoiding doing videos or he is recording things but not uploading them or he has other shit going on in real life that he isn't telling anyone about."
ethoslab,39mbi4,revereddesecration,2,Sat Jun 13 06:32:31 2015 UTC,"You're right, I highly doubt that's the case. He probably only spends anywhere from 2-8 hours in a day to record and edit one LP video, depending on the content. He's very private about his personal life, but he did say he's just been preoccupied with other games like Hearthstone and Agar.io, among other distractions. Seems like he's just kinda not feelin like recording."
ethoslab,39jv6z,DrMcTaalik,2,Fri Jun 12 06:08:38 2015 UTC,"I like the form and I see it's going along with Etho's interestingly jungle/temple of doom feel on the HC server. I'd like to see another block other than gray stone or brick added to give it more texture/color and perhaps depth without sacrificing cleanliness of the overall design. Granted, this is something I'd like see all over Etho's base, but I feel he'll probably add plant life or what not to break up the stone eventually. Good job :)"
ethoslab,39jv6z,theblindrunner,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. The issue is that there is a very limited selection of blocks with stairs.

I considered using quartz and ice to create an ""Ice sculpture"" look, and thus kill two birds with one stone, but I decided against it."

ethoslab,39d5bq,moonlam,13,Wed Jun 10 23:35:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a good idea. The creation of a new channel would imply not being able to make money until he has a substantial subscriber base on his new channel. I think it would be a huge waste of time and a big gamble on potential money he could make compared to how much time he will spend on making videos.   I think if he wants to play other games and makes videos of it, he can upload them to his actual channel. He already have a huge audience and 'old' subscribers will watched them and maybe it will bring new subscribers who aren't interested by minecraft content at all."

ethoslab,39d5bq,I_EatPonies,5,Thu Jun 11 01:06:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly, other games videos get less views so imagine on a new channel.

ethoslab,39d5bq,khoitrinh,2,Thu Jun 11 10:33:05 2015 UTC,"Your logic is faulty. He doesn't stop uploading videos because of a lack of views/likes. He doesn't have some massive store of videos sitting around not uploaded just because he doesn't think they'll get views.  When they don't get enough views or likes, he stops making the videos simply because they are no longer worth it. He doesn't have an infinite amount of time each day.

I understand his reluctance to upload it, since it is very unlike anything else he has on his channel and I haven't read enough comments to see the reception that one video had.   Streaming, though, I feel is a different story, people don't usually mind different games on Twitch and it is much more casual.   But maybe he simply doesn't like recording Hearthstone and is a game he enjoys playing on his own, which is completely understandable."

Also, throughout his YT-profession, with a month before leaving Mindcrack up to now, I've notice his behaviour change slightly, especially when he totally stopped UHC (but he did explained that during one of his caving videos), but I feel etho is starting to chhange a little, and his breaks change from 6vids/week to 4/week to now 3days video - 5 days no video, which is alarming, both for us the viewers, and for etho who's main source of income is through YT"

ethoslab,38ldkv,Boingboingsplat,11,Fri Jun 5 00:48:24 2015 UTC,Not all of us will.  I fear he is getting burned out.

I'm bad in that regard.  But there is a point, for me personally, when it feels like a channel owner is losing or has lost interest in putting out content -- whether it's just the content that I enjoy, or content in any form, at all.  I almost always wander off at that point.  Something in me can't handle it psychologically.  I really don't want that to happen to Etho's channel on top of so many others in the last year or so.  I mean, he's always been my favorite and still is in a lot of ways.  I'm not going to debate it.   I hate to be negative like this.  I'm just sad and not seeing good things to come right now."

And that was working just fine but for some reason he decided to drop all of them (he did 3 episodes of Crypt Crawler recently but i assume that isn't enough breathing room for how hard he works on his other sries), maybe he wanted to try to put only the best content possible on his channel but if it means less videos and him being burned out it's not worth it"

ethoslab,38jv31,BillyBadBoy,3,Thu Jun 4 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"I remember watching that soooo long ago. It was one of 2-3 videos that got me into etho. The other ones were TerraFirmaCraft 1 and the last battle of FTB, the one where he made the huge castle to spite the others  Etho doing Parkour is hilarious. He should do something like that again imo. Perhaps even a retry if this map."
ethoslab,38i8iz,naliuj2525,41,Thu Jun 4 11:43:11 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts (from a designer): in short it feels very cramped and a little confusing to read  -Everything is pushed to the left and sort of smooshed together. Compare to Mindcrack for example: there is more than 2"" between the left side of the screen and the beginning of the title of the post, whereas on Ethoslab everything happens within 1"" of the left side of the screen. The rounded edge adds to the cramped look because it minimizes any air space (and breathing room)  -The upvote/downvote icons are very tiny and without color it seems (unless you upvote)? and as you said the onion is not obvious to understand at first look  -The flairs don't line up: looking at the main page I see 'Vanilla', 'Fan Art', 'Discussion', 'Meta' all kind of staggering back and forth- my eye doesn't know what to focus on or where to go in order to read from one post to another and quickly understand the information  -Another comparison to Mindcrack: notice how there is always a space between the upvote/downvote icon and the flair (in that space you'll see the mindcrack logo or a picture)- that layout is easier to look at. It's consistent and easier to look through. You could create an Etho icon to serve as a place holder and it will make everything look more consistent  -I would suggest to make each post bigger in height- adding more air space in general will greatly improve the main page  -The word coloring: I would suggest only letting the title differentiate in color from the rest of the words. The title poster's name and the # of comments don't need their own color. It's distracting from the post title and again my eye doesn't know what to focus because it's getting pulled to all of the colors first rather than the title  -Someone mentioned that the banner looks like it's for kids- yes Minecraft is for kids but Etho has a lot of older viewers (like myself) and has himself created a more mature environment. I agree that it looks very young. (also it looks like he's farting his name...)  But, I will say it was a nice surprise to see the difference this morning. It's a good start and a few details will make it a lot nicer. Simpler is always better. Work on stacking like-items in an invisible column down the page so that each post has the same information in exactly the same place. Also increase the air space all around and it'll look really good! Not that we need to be like the Mindcrack or Hermitcraft page but their layouts are done very well!"
ethoslab,38i8iz,yodaloda,11,Thu Jun 4 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"Looks great! The giant ""You've been Etho'd"" blocks the comment box for me on empty posts (like this one just was). Also, there doesn't seem to be a link post button anymore (though I can see it with the CSS disabled) and Aubron has the same flair as Etho, which is kind of confusing."
ethoslab,38i8iz,TheBigKahooner,2,Thu Jun 4 11:51:26 2015 UTC,"You can still post links, go on the post stuff button and then you can click if you want to post a link or a text post"

ethoslab,38i8iz,fdagpigj,6,Thu Jun 4 12:08:23 2015 UTC,"In the stylesheet, there's a line that says .sidebox.submit.submit-link {display: none;}, that hides the link submit button. Why do people blindly copy-paste other subreddits' stylesheets?  The userflair is a bit messed up, for example on your comment here it's displayed below the above comment. I'm guessing it has too low of a z-index (quick edit: okay that's not it, I don't think). Also, I would personally prefer the text only displaying on hover.  The spoiler tags you had before also broke, as seen in the sidebar. Of course people can always use the traditional spoiler tags that work everywhere (by typing [hover over for spoilers](/s 'jk this is not a spoiler') which shows as hover over for spoilers).  The beta icon for reddit beta testers is a bit weird, but it's just a minor complaint."
ethoslab,38i8iz,Aubron,5,Thu Jun 4 12:47:57 2015 UTC,"Many thanks, sorry. I had to make some last minutes style changes that broke a few things. Plugging holes now.

Just a personal opinion, though.  Also, the upvote icon is reeeally hard to tell at a glance whether you're already upvoted or not. The greyscale redstone should be lighter with only the outline visible, or something."

ethoslab,38i8iz,Nonresemblance,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:08:01 2015 UTC,"I think Minecraft was meant to be a game for all ages.  It's not a super simple game, and the lack of tutorial (on the PC versions) implies that they assumed some maturity in their audience to figure stuff out.  I hear a lot about parents getting this game for kids and the difficulty of it forcing the parents to have to learn to play it in order to teach their kids.   Anyway, that's a point open for debate I'm sure.  Relevant for this thread, Etho has commented that he has a high percentage of older viewers, and his tag line is ""minecraft done technical"", he doesn't talk to the audience like a kid's centric channel - all these things together make a somewhat childlike banner for example (not ""childish"" - I want to make that distinction because I think it's a great fan picture, just that it has a kid's aesthetic to it) doesn't really speak to me about what his channel is about."

ethoslab,38i97r,jugemscloudmc,3,Thu Jun 4 15:59:13 2015 UTC,"Basically the game feels disconnected from immersion, then next to that the world is of course made out of plastic, meaning reflective surfaces is a big thing. What do you get when you have reflective surfaces on voxel worlds, you get very bright reflections and then strong shadow next to it. This creates a lot of visual clutter and giant contrast, which is very bothersome for the eyes.  Then gameplay wise its a screw around sandbox, with no immersive world. It would be good for kids who want to screw around, like you see people mess about in gta, but not like on a serious field.   This is why."

(hence the snot. it's the body's way of clearing it out). washing the pillow itself might help, or get one that isn't permeable to dust particles.  what is known to help clear it out however, is a nice nose washing session.  there are several products on the market with varying effectiveness, But the easiest is to just wash your face in warm water, and let the steam from the water loosen up the snot so you can blow it out."
ethoslab,384pfm,johonn,2,Tue Jun 2 09:19:03 2015 UTC,I commented on the video but not sure how buried stuff gets on there nowadays...  Edit: better explanation below
ethoslab,384pfm,johonn,2,Tue Jun 2 04:03:03 2015 UTC,"Actually it is even easier. Your system can ""know"" where the carts were last called to - just save your button press in a t-flip-flop. Then, when you push the call button from somewhere else, the set t-flip-flop causes the incoming call signal to trigger the release mechanism - otherwise it would just pass by. The incoming call signal would also reset the t-flip-flop so it was ready for the next sequence. Finally, as in my first comment, when you press the button, it sets the track at your location to receive the minecarts, which resets once the carts arrive (I'm sure you could figure out how to do that)."
ethoslab,384pfm,monolithdigital,2,Tue Jun 2 04:07:26 2015 UTC,"whichever solution is used, there has to be redstone stretching from one base to the next, or tracks running a primer minecart.  but I'd rather go with the redstone, easier on resources, and simplet then a cart running around hitting buttons for you"

(lack of vocal cord use during the night causes mucus to build up during sleep)  Other causes: breathing through the mouth while sleeping (dries vocal cords), acid reflux, eating a big meal or spicy meal before bed  Solution: Sleeping with head elevated or drinking two glasses of room temperature water with a squeeze of lemon in the morning (before coffee because coffee can make it worse, unfortunately)"
ethoslab,384pfm,Plex128,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:08:08 2015 UTC,Concerning the minecart storage system: Maybe he could order the stations in a star-like shape instead of a ring. See here. That way the minecarts would travel faster and the call mechanism would be easier: Simply send the same signal to every station and set a big junction in the middle.

ethoslab,384pfm,monolithdigital,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"I thought of that, but at some point, there has to be a signal sent to the pistons holding back the railcarts... really no way around it, and each button has to hit them at some point."

I think Etho said (but I could be wrong) that he doesn't get many views for pvp, which surprised me.  He's pretty good.  (That video where he falls off a high ledge, and bows someone as he falls past them was awesome)"
ethoslab,380b3j,danbcdanbc,5,Sun May 31 22:47:32 2015 UTC,"I believe that was Cluster Chunk, but he didn't upload his perspective. I think only OneWolfe (same team) and three_two (opposing team) uploaded complete videos of that game, which IMO was one of most exciting games of Cluster Chunk they played."
ethoslab,380b3j,mudfloss,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:28:35 2015 UTC,"There are multiple problems he has when he records with the Midnight Society:  Not everybody has decent mics and people have complained about that in the comments. imo it would help if they had a call in mumble and Etho would record the mumble overlay since you could see and not only hear when somebody talks.  Another big thing is that with a group of ~5 people it is kinda difficult to keep it w/o swears, and these guys don't come together all that much anymore, and i could imagine Etho would feel uncomfortable to ask them every time they play not to swear.  And addicionally he doesn't get a whole lot of views on these vids, so there is that. And even when he uploads one he probably never knows for sure when the next pvp vid might be, so viewers will get impatient and complain even more about the lack of pvp vids.  i would like to see a comeback tho :-)"
ethoslab,380b3j,Zwockl9001,2,Mon Jun 1 14:57:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of the points. For example, Zueljin swore quite a bit in that game, probably the only one on the team to do so. Most of the others were clean. Many who did swear were sorta guests, whereas most MS members didn't in videos with Etho. You can even find Rixiot promising to keep it clean for him in one video, not by Etho's request :)  IMO the views were low (still not that low) because the viewers were never properly introduced to MS, hence were unwilling to commit. Kinda like Flyboys, I think. It will take more videos for people to be willing to invest in the series. The views will probably not reach those of his long running series but they are easy to record (if he wins, some games can be stressful though) and are quality content.   I'd love to see a comeback too, MS Etho is ... diferent. More laid back and not ""at work""."
ethoslab,380b3j,mudfloss,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:45:22 2015 UTC,"The more I think of the ""proper introduction"" thing, the more I think of proposing some kind of (re)introductory thing to Etho when I try bringing MS back into being.  Next time you catch me streaming, bring this up again. I'd like your thoughts and opinions on a few things."

ethoslab,37vqvs,mssmjkta,7,Sat May 30 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"Hey Etho, I think I know the reason why you're having trouble with the top interface for your automated infusion computer.  Your program wraps the peripherals only once at the very beginning. The problem is, if you start the program while the top interface is missing (to access the computer) and then place the interface afterwards, it the program has already gone through the wrap and has assigned the top to nil.  The solution to that is instead of having one line to wrap each side, try to wrap each side on a loop until it is successful. That way the program will freeze at the wrapping part when it starts, and it'll only continue once you've replaced the interface in its place, wrapping it correctly."
ethoslab,37vqvs,Teraka,22,Sat May 30 20:41:05 2015 UTC,"no, the solution is very simple.... he forgot to power the bridge. XD"

ethoslab,37vqvs,TheMerricat,3,Sun May 31 00:44:13 2015 UTC,"Hi Etho,  If you are using the XLR version of the mic, you need phantom power. You can't just plug it in the jack input of the PC, you need an audio interface that support 48V phantom power and that has a built in pre-amp for mic."
ethoslab,37vqvs,DanyTheRed,0,Sun May 31 18:24:28 2015 UTC,The Behringer XENYX Q502USB for example. Has an EQ and compressor built in which is useful!  I don't know this one specifically but it was the first one I could find. I'm sure there are lots of other options.  edit: Staying with Behringer... The U-PHORIA UM2 is cheaper and for basic recording it would do the job as well.
ethoslab,37vqvs,alphanimal,1 point,Sun May 31 22:43:18 2015 UTC,Berhinger mixing tables are not really recognized for the quality of their mic amps.  The Focusrite Scarlett series is a better option IMHO. There are a few good option with different brands that out-perform the Behringer.

ethoslab,37xo9r,PandaPantiesLP,24,Sun May 31 06:56:33 2015 UTC,"I think it is mostly because they have already been in the server for a long time and therefore have a lot of resources.  For example, it would be more challenging to gather iron by exploring, but way ignore the giant iron farm at spawn?  Same goes with getting some TNT from the other players, I believe."

ethoslab,37xo9r,AmethystZhou,21,Tue Jun 2 02:03:22 2015 UTC,The quality of Etho's work is way beyond gathering materials. He excels at building concepts and trickery. There lies his challenge day by day.  Presents given by other players will not affect that in any sense. It will just be some grinding work he will not put in a video. That's why watching Etho keeps on being interesting.
ethoslab,37xo9r,OuweMickey,16,Sun May 31 11:47:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Etho minds this, he takes a lot of resources from automatic farms himself."
ethoslab,37xo9r,TheTurtleTamer,13,Sun May 31 09:30:02 2015 UTC,He still does A LOT of work on his own. More than what the gifts help him with.
ethoslab,37r5tf,Twiggy02,17,Fri May 29 18:59:32 2015 UTC,This will be very useful to consult when you want to rewatch or link something to someone but you can't remember which episode it was!
ethoslab,37r5tf,Wulfruna,8,Fri May 29 19:35:49 2015 UTC,Agreed
ethoslab,37r5tf,Dobert,13,Fri May 29 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"Not only it's a good summary of each episode, but you link every specific moment. Can't get much better than this as far as recaps go really."
ethoslab,37r5tf,fdagpigj,7,Fri May 29 20:56:08 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the feedback!
ethoslab,37r5tf,rock_buster,5,Fri May 29 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"Do you mean ""Ethopians' Recap of Etho's Activities""? It's a bit hard to interpret correctly if you leave out the apostrohes. Also, I don't think there's a reason to use the abbreviation as the title, since it's not that long.  Anyway, if this is meant to be a community project, surely it would make more sense to not have any links in the post itself and leave it up to the commenters to gather the peak moments?"
ethoslab,37r5tf,rock_buster,3,Fri May 29 19:09:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! I might experiment with different set-ups throughout these first few weeks. Perhaps I could have a few and as I received comments I'd add them to the main post?
ethoslab,37r5tf,fdagpigj,6,Fri May 29 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"You could just call it the Etho Recap, really. Simple is best."

ethoslab,37lwnk,AlwaysLateToComments,7,Thu May 28 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"I think a second reason Etho wanted like the way he has it, is so he can start remembering things better. Learning item codes is, for some people, easier than undoing a load of work that's already been done.  Remember when he started working on that memory game (that he hasn't finished (yet))?"
ethoslab,37lwnk,RiddlerFish,4,Thu May 28 16:13:48 2015 UTC,Which memory game? xD

ethoslab,37lwnk,EpikYummeh,0,Fri May 29 06:44:02 2015 UTC,"this,  it will still only get dropped 1 at a time from a dropper, just needs a clock.  ISTR that he mentioned the quantity selector before he built the hexydecimal decoder as a generalised idea of his plan, so now that he has the hexydecimal decoder, it may have changed, unless that's what the lever in the middle at the top is for.  And if he wants truly massive quantities , like an inventory full of sand, he can just take it out of the chests directly"
ethoslab,37lwnk,NealWard,1 point,Fri May 29 10:30:29 2015 UTC,That was the idea.
ethoslab,37lwnk,EpikYummeh,1 point,Fri May 29 16:09:27 2015 UTC,I would think an item frame selector would work perfectly for quantities. Each tick could be a power of 2.
ethoslab,37lwnk,s_s,1 point,Fri May 29 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"Also, you would have to have another wire going to each light which takes up a lot of room."
ethoslab,37lwnk,Captainfoo,1 point,Fri May 29 03:11:15 2015 UTC,"you wouldn't need a new wire as the wire that feeds into the dropper can just go to the light as well, adding a couple pieces of redstone per chest."
ethoslab,37lwnk,Captainfoo,1 point,Fri May 29 18:10:36 2015 UTC,Oh I see what your saying
ethoslab,37lwnk,fdagpigj,1 point,Sat May 30 02:01:37 2015 UTC,"Good luck redoing all that wiring...  Or do you mean he would simply have a constant signal instead of a pulse going through the item request line? It would still spit out one item each time he turns it on, but I guess that's not a big deal especially when you're there to get an inventory full of something. Otherwise, he could only have it blink when the items are being requested."
ethoslab,37joys,CrankkDatJFel,26,Thu May 28 02:58:35 2015 UTC,Is there any way it could tell you when Etho is currently streaming? I think that would be really awesome :)

ethoslab,37joys,EpikYummeh,2,Fri May 29 03:21:47 2015 UTC,Good idea.  Will add to list.
ethoslab,37joys,mielleman201,2,Thu May 28 19:05:21 2015 UTC,You can check a box on Twitch to get email notifications when certain streamers go live. You could set it to only notify you when Etho goes live and not when any of your other follows go live.
ethoslab,37joys,EpikYummeh,21,Tue Jun 2 20:15:00 2015 UTC,"WOW, that site looks really nice. But it could be made more Etho like. Maybe grass? xD"
ethoslab,37joys,kerbalweirdo123,2,Thu May 28 06:36:31 2015 UTC,I wish!  I'm not much of a designer.
ethoslab,37joys,Bloq,1 point,Thu May 28 19:09:35 2015 UTC,Grass would be easy to do with the repeat-x flag for the background-image property.
ethoslab,37joys,Bloq,2,Tue Jun 2 20:16:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, would be easy.  I just don't think it'd look very good."
ethoslab,37joys,superbentley,17,Wed Jun 3 00:05:23 2015 UTC,You should embed etho's twitch channel at the top of the homepage if he's streaming.  Perhaps like this
ethoslab,37joys,spyman510,6,Thu May 28 04:53:27 2015 UTC,"I think it should be a separate page. In the top it should say ""Livestream"" and a red dot will appear next to it if he is live."

ethoslab,37joys,kerbalweirdo123,2,Thu May 28 19:05:46 2015 UTC,Also remember to embed the chat if possible! :)
ethoslab,37joys,Aarilight,8,Thu May 28 19:55:26 2015 UTC,Nice job! If it wouldn't take too long could you add an info page to show the specs of his pc and stuff like that?
ethoslab,37joys,kroimon,5,Thu May 28 03:32:31 2015 UTC,Thanks!  That's a good idea.  I can grab his YouTube about content and throw it on it's own page.  Will do!
ethoslab,37joys,ThatPaleKid88,7,Thu May 28 03:35:18 2015 UTC,On my screen the playlist drop down menu is too long and continues outside the window. I cannot see all the choices unless I decrease the page size. I am using a 1600x900 resolution.

ethoslab,37joys,Moparx,4,Thu May 28 03:44:30 2015 UTC,Just make that menu scrollable.
ethoslab,37joys,fdagpigj,2,Thu May 28 12:16:38 2015 UTC,Unfortunately not as easy as it sounds.
ethoslab,37joys,bigDon_001,2,Thu May 28 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"Nonsense, just add  overflow-y: auto; max-height: 90vh;   to the css for the dropdown menu.  the unit vh stands for viewport-height, and 100 of those are equal to height of the viewport.  However, not every browser supports vh so you're better off using javascript to set the max-height in pixels if you really need to support IE/old browsers.  Edit: image  Also, this is what it looks like with that blue replaced with the green color #12b400, and the background replaced with #e3ede3: http://i.imgur.com/fU6qw8k.png"

ethoslab,37joys,fdagpigj,1 point,Thu May 28 22:33:46 2015 UTC,You should add an   overflow-x: hidden    for that so that the lower scrollbar doesn't show up.  http://puu.sh/iaGxA/052934dbf0.png vs http://puu.sh/iaGyy/23979dca9f.png

ethoslab,37joys,fdagpigj,5,Thu May 28 19:26:12 2015 UTC,a twitter feed BUT one that ignores the automatic posting of youtube videos. So that only important self-written tweets are seen.

ethoslab,37joys,autowikibot,6,Thu May 28 05:49:21 2015 UTC,Thank you.  I used Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) for all the styling.  View the source of the page for specific classes used.

ethoslab,37joys,notwhereyouare,3,Thu May 28 21:20:22 2015 UTC,It looks amazing! I think one cool feature would be the option to choose between newest videos/ oldest videos for the playlists so people can go straight to the latest Etho vid of the series :)
ethoslab,37joys,PandaPantiesLP,2,Thu May 28 08:37:59 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I cannot do this due to a limitation of the YouTube Data API.

ethoslab,37joys,NealWard,3,Thu May 28 08:37:24 2015 UTC,Even better would be to detect when Etho's live and change the link when he is!
ethoslab,37joys,InfiniteNexus,3,Thu May 28 10:03:34 2015 UTC,I like the idea of dynamically changing the link depending on if he's live.
ethoslab,37joys,NealWard,2,Thu May 28 19:11:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for doing a mobile version
ethoslab,37joys,NealWard,2,Thu May 28 10:44:04 2015 UTC,Great job! Hopefully this can become is official webpage.
ethoslab,37joys,notwhereyouare,2,Thu May 28 12:19:09 2015 UTC,I suggest that you add a system where you can register and then tell other users which videos you've watched. (Just for us crazy rewatchers)
ethoslab,37joys,NealWard,2,Thu May 28 17:33:01 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this will require a lot of work.  Maybe if Etho was involved and wanted this feature I'd go for it.
ethoslab,37joys,notwhereyouare,2,Thu May 28 19:21:39 2015 UTC,Perhaps adding a list of links to his LP world downloads?
ethoslab,37hekz,mielleman201,10,Wed May 27 17:30:19 2015 UTC,he said he might do more of it when major updates happen
ethoslab,37hekz,morgoth95,9,Wed May 27 17:39:25 2015 UTC,They are rewriting the mod for 1.8+ so that might take a while
ethoslab,37hekz,Atanar,5,Wed May 27 17:52:37 2015 UTC,This would be a good idea if he could do things he hasn't done before in his episodes. Which he can't.

ethoslab,37hekz,Xanthelei,4,Wed May 27 23:33:01 2015 UTC,"This would be awesome, especially since Twitch records and saves the streams automatically, or he could do a Bdubs and chop up the stream into Youtube videos. It'd be a nice excuse to stream, and give viewers a bit of TFC stuff, AND give Etho ready-to-go episodes that would just need to be split apart and rendered.  I dunno if Etho would go for it, though. It seems a bit not his style, and I can understand not wanting to commit to a weekly stream time that he may not be able to keep for whatever reason."
ethoslab,37hekz,tindam188,5,Thu May 28 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"I am unsure its the best mod to play, it can get very grindy very quickly, dont get me wrong, its a great mod, but Etho has mentioned a few times that he has a lot of series that take a lot of time, another might be too much."
ethoslab,37hekz,Fort_Colorcastle,2,Wed May 27 19:14:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe in the future when one of his current series stops. It is a little grindy, but is it more grindy than Etho Plays Minecraft? Or Modded series.  lets hope TFC2 is less grindy and has more content"
ethoslab,37hekz,Grantus89,1 point,Wed May 27 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"When you watch a stream, you typically expect grindy stuff. Especially in minecraft, so I'd be interested in watching this and those who don't want to watch grindy games could stick to his YouTube channel.  And since he can do all the grindy off-camera stuff on-camera, this wouldn't take too much time off of his regular episodes."
ethoslab,37hekz,Gravija98,1 point,Thu May 28 22:31:13 2015 UTC,"But not boring to watch, in vanilla watching him mine for more redstone is boring, in TFC watching him find ores is way more interesting, due to the interesting terrain and difficulty to find them."

ethoslab,37dnl8,Holyrapid,3,Wed May 27 16:22:55 2015 UTC,I think the barrel would look better if he used iron and maybe spruce or dark oak instead. At least iron for the bands. Or maybe use iron trapdoors on top of the wood for the bands?

That being said he seems to pronounce it the normal way most of the time.

The French closely follow with lave, and while I am no linguist, or even bi-lingual (unless you count American/Australian/English), I would venture to suggest that a) they can't spell and b) the proximity to Italy and the historical (or not) preference in the top part of the UK for France over the bottom part suggests a pronunciation of l<A>v,   which I always thought of as a bog, the merkins call a restroom and pretty much everyone is faintly embarrassed to ask the whereabouts of when in a foreign location  As Etho is Canadian, all are equally correct, with the possible exception of Italian (did they ever get north of Neow Joiseee?).

ethoslab,37d5jv,spyman510,2,Tue May 26 20:59:51 2015 UTC,I agree. He talkes about episodes taking so long to prepare for but that's because he goes way overboard with the tunnels. He should just make a tunnel big enough to get a horse through and have a track. maybe 3x3. and he could still make it look nice without have a tunnel that is very wide and high with all sorts of intricate detail. in most of his videos he cuts out the tunnel rides anyways.

Since he does a lot of technical builds, he could do an episode after you finish a build where he tears it apart, shows the guts, and talks about it. (in a world copy)  It would put a unique spin on the replay thing. But yea, every now and then, having a recap episode would be cool."

ethoslab,374hgr,amphicoelias,1 point,Tue May 26 15:44:10 2015 UTC,"He's addressed why he doesn't liked doing that - mainly because rather than fixing a broken area, he'd just rather build a new and better version of it. Or - it's not needed anymore. So why waste time building broken things? Or even tearing broken things out?  Perfect example of this is the cave spider farm. He might be able to fix it so that the farm works as originally intended (or close to it), but what's the point? Cave spiders don't work the same way anymore, and he has much easier ways of getting XP. In reality, XP isn't even that important anymore. The better thing to do is do what he did - leave the old structure as is, and build a new spider farm that makes use of the cave spiders (collects string) and works when he needs it to work. The alternative would be to spend a lot of episodes tearing out/fixing old areas when he could be building new and better projects."

Re: the Guardian farm.  Is it possible that it's losing items somewhere along the way?  My Guardian farm is very small (just the treasure room in an otherwise drained ocean monument) and I didn't drain the ocean around the monument so the ""wild"" Guardians take up a lot of the mob cap.  Thus the spawn rate in my farm is pretty low.  Still, I get a little over two double chests of drops if I AFK overnight, which is sufficient for my needs and then some.  I could see just from that bit of video that Etho is (unsurprisingly) getting a MUCH higher Guardian spawn rate than I am -- mine just come in dribs and drabs, not a constant flow -- but it sounds like he's actually getting  a slightly lower drop rate.  That's what's making me wonder if the items are getting lost or destroyed somehow (maybe in the lava blade, I've heard some people say they have that problem).  I know he mentioned lighting caves in a recent video, but from this video it sure doesn't look like the spawn rate is the problem.

In one of his live streams he talked about the angel ring from Extra Utilities that allows you to fly with creative mode flying, and he called it ""cheaty"" but he would ""probably use it eventually.""  If he did go directly to the angel ring then he would have no use for the jetpack or the grappling hook which would be content that he'd miss out on.  Same thing with infinite power generation.

I think that could become a common thing he does, where the second half of an episode he goes and tries to wrap up some loose threads from the open projects book.  As long as he keeps creating new loose threads in the first half of the episode - that will make a nice perpetual system. :)  About his potential voice change:  I think it's cute that he is preparing some of his audience for the possible change in his voice - makes me think of the jokes about Silent Movie stars in their first Talkies when people hear them for the first time.  Makes sense that he would bring it up, considering how many comment on loving his voice.  Never fear though, Etho! If it turns out it was all because of that old microphone, I have a solution!  Make use of the hours and hours of previous recordings and create a speech-to-speech system that uses your real voice as input and outputs the same text but in cutup snippets from your old recordings.   Solved!   Kidding aside, I like his voice best in his PVP episodes like the recent Infinitri, where I imagine he is paying less attention to how it picks up and therefore is a bit more natural.  So I'm very interested to hear how a different mic will work out in regular LPs, if he doesn't feel he has to push his voice so much in order for his inflections and tone to be picked up."

Are you going to make a series out of gamemode 4 (probably not like he said in the livestream)? Is there any chance we'll see a Team Canada reunion soon? Are you guys at least going to play Ruins of the Mindcrackers 3 when it comes out? Are you going to continue/finish your terrafirmacraft series anytime soon? Are you going to finish your current projects on the Mindcrack server (it's very unlikely, I know)?   Just so you know, I respect any decision you make Etho.

ethoslab,36ob0c,EbuVitaeProductions,24,Thu May 21 01:49:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I think it could be the old fireproof wooden slabs that you'd break with a pickaxe."
ethoslab,36ob0c,Kroteux,14,Thu May 21 02:07:39 2015 UTC,They are. Zisteau recently ran into some in Pantheon.
ethoslab,36ob0c,Beakerbite,2,Thu May 21 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's how I knew that the slabs had a missing texture, but I wasn't sure if there was any other block in the game that has one too."
ethoslab,36ob0c,Kroteux,3,Thu May 21 11:13:39 2015 UTC,I think some old jungle leaves have a missing texture too.
ethoslab,36ob0c,Logg,3,Thu May 21 13:34:52 2015 UTC,I ran into some old oak leave textures that were like that too. They were from ~1.3 or so.
ethoslab,36ob0c,the11devans,2,Thu May 21 15:18:06 2015 UTC,They only have a missing texture in item form.  Placed they look like normal slabs.
ethoslab,36ob0c,dado3212,7,Thu May 21 06:47:07 2015 UTC,"Aw man, I was hoping that he was going to make the Firework room into like a little hidden away spot behind some shrubbery with that narrow hallway - like all those illegal firework trailers haha."
ethoslab,36ob0c,MezzanineMan,5,Thu May 21 16:33:47 2015 UTC,About the grey carpet:  Would placing some different colours in help?  Like 5 grey then 1 red then 5 grey etc etc.  That would make it look like you're going faster.

It's broken beyond repair. I'll try get a new one soon.     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]
ethoslab,36oed9,locojoco,19,Wed May 20 21:27:03 2015 UTC,I agree. These episodes are easy to record (at least they look easy to record) and are fun to watch. Looks like a Win win situation to me.
ethoslab,36oed9,ultra_sabreman,14,Wed May 20 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"The only downside of this is it ruins interaction with viewer - there's no way to act on comments that come up after the video, because he would have prerecorded the next bits.   I like that he reads the comments and modifies his gameplay the next episode.  PVP episodes though would be different - I think random PVPs could be a nice filler since that comments-interaction stuff wouldn't be necessary.    Or he just keeps doing what he's doing... that works for me too. :)Gives me a chance to catch up on random old videos of his if I'm really missing a new one."
ethoslab,36oed9,K_nikk,4,Thu May 21 01:19:31 2015 UTC,When he did ctm maps he didn't need interaction with viewers for it to be great
ethoslab,36oed9,davidknag,3,Thu May 21 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"On the recent crypt crawler he specifically goes back to find missed hidden doors that were pointed out in the comments. We would lose that if it was all recorded at once and then sprinkled onto YouTube as filler. Even zisteau makes commentary that references things that happen between episodes of his pantheon series (like what he observes in GOB).  For a long running CTM especially if played with others I can see that single sessions would be best broken up into multiple episodes just because scheduling playtime can be so difficult. But I do like it when there are some opportunities for feedback occasionally.   Just something I like, but to each their own."
ethoslab,36oed9,K_nikk,3,Thu May 21 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, he didn't go back. He said specifically that he missed it and that he's too lazy to go get them."
ethoslab,36oed9,Fort_Colorcastle,1 point,Thu May 21 23:03:27 2015 UTC,"Ah perhaps that is true; I thought that the fireworks one was definitely back tracked, but he certainly did not go back for all of them.  It did feel like the viewer was more involved however, when he commented on the comments, and gave the appearance of changing his door-detecting strategies; which made it more engaging for me personally and less frustrating too - since in the previous episode I cringed at the doors he was missing. :)  I'm glad that that did not continue into the second episode."
ethoslab,36oed9,K_nikk,6,Thu May 21 23:25:34 2015 UTC,"Something else he could use as ""filler"" that wouldn't need viewer reaction to be great would be public server stuff. He wouldn't even have to play as Etho on some of them, since being able to change your visible name is so common. They could be PvP games, DvZ style stuff, parkour, etc. Another option is trying to get together with others for a collab, as those tend to not include viewer reactions and are recorded in mini marathons. Plus I miss OOGE and Team Canada stuff.  I do still think he'd do fine with adding a series that doesn't have grindy stuff in it, and setting days he wants to upload even if he doesn't tell us what the schedule is.  I personally don't mind the sporadic uploads, but I've been watching him since alpha and am probably one of those rabid fanboys everyone talks about. :P If he's needing to find ways to maintain and grow the channel, going by what I'm OK with is probably not the best idea."
ethoslab,36oed9,Xanthelei,6,Thu May 21 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"Challenges (if anyone could think of new ones) would be great too, since they wouldn't get dated and their would be few enough episodes (one usually) to just drop it in."
ethoslab,36oed9,fleshrott,1 point,Thu May 21 01:16:56 2015 UTC,Personally: I'm happy for etho to do whatever the heck he wants.  I really really don't want this to feel like a normal job for him.  It's important for people to have time off now and then.  I can cope going for a few days without videos.
ethoslab,36r5yu,Blade00000009,14,Thu May 21 13:49:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, he comments and even posts every now and then. Often in his episodes he'll even credit a reddit post with helping him out (like the recent enderporter upgrade)"

ethoslab,36nrty,Dobert,2,Wed May 20 20:30:06 2015 UTC,I think his headset breaking set him back a couple days. He's probably waiting for the new one to arrive

ethoslab,36k5gt,Rexistence,43,Wed May 20 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"To respond to your argument regarding the distance from the man cave, Etho set up an enderporter at the nexus, meaning instant travel from the man cave. Also, he has a reference chest with the codes for every item in there, so he does not need to memorize it. One of the purposes of the nexus is for storing large quantities of materials without the cluttering of unorganized forgotten chests, like the one storing his dragon egg."
ethoslab,36k5gt,LewisAndQuark,16,Wed May 20 00:24:32 2015 UTC,"It's not really meant to replace his chest room. It's a place to keep items (256 of them, and large quantities) without a massive, massive chest room running back and forth.   If he wants an inventory of cobblestone he'll go to the nexus, because there's no point in keeping mass quantities at the man cave"
ethoslab,36k5gt,andymcb1,26,Wed May 20 03:36:15 2015 UTC,"You don't understand the nexus then. It's  long term, bulk storage."
ethoslab,36k5gt,sag969,12,Wed May 20 03:50:06 2015 UTC,"It's about the build, designing it, doing little test setups of seperate components, combining them, compacting them, figuring out a complex redstone puzzle, debugging it when it doesn't do exactly what you wants and finally the gratification when it all comes together. There is much more pleasure in this for him than using the thing, using it is an optional afterthought. This is why he likes to start new projects, the challenge of figuring it out, not the grindy building stuff."
ethoslab,36k5gt,BaldrickTheFifth,2,Wed May 20 10:21:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of cold storage, like all of his items don't fit in the man cave so he has to put the extras somewhere."
ethoslab,36k5gt,davidknag,2,Wed May 20 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"You are forgetting that Etho has recently taken steps to streamline and automate his mining, a bit more, too. This makes a HUGE difference in how the NEXUS will be functional within his world. You do remember how he loaded the Nexus to begin with? All he has to do to put block into the NEXUS is send them down the rail lines from where he mined them. Then the NEXUS is where they will go, and he will have to go there to retrieve them, I grant that the primary use of the NEXUS will be for mined blocks, but he can add rail lines from any of the mob farms he has in place... I see this system in my next world, but there will be no fancy numerical retrieval system, just an array of chests."
ethoslab,36k5gt,ThimbleStudios,2,Tue May 26 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"He has plenty of space for mass storage. I mean. how many double chests of cobble do you think is worth storing? his speed mining operation can net him stacks upon stacks of smoothstone and cobble in short order. his nexus can store 3 double chests of any item+whatever fits in the hoppers. that should be plenty enough. He might never use it for simple items like cobble and stone tho. there is just so much of it laying around all over at any given time for him to bother with the trip. but for stuff like colored clay. yes i think so.  he would probably rather spend a decent amount of time mining that stuff at the clay mesa mining outpost, rather than having to go back whenever he needs some of it.  Etho also likes to make item transport systems. I bet he is going to connect his farms to the nexus for centralized storage of mob farm items as well.  that means colored clay, bones, arrows, zombie flesh, spider eyes, ender-pearls and gunpowder are all probably going to be automatically put into nexus storage. once he get's his witch farm up and running, bottles, redstone dust, and sugar become farmable too.  almost forgot. the ""flower farm"" will net him red flowers and ""dirty"" iron as well.  There are probably many many more farms that can output a lot of goods automatically into the nexus.  There is also a way to make a remote ordering system for special items as well. altho the cost in redstone is pretty steep when taking into account distances. not to mention the chunk loading needs. I don't think the nexus is within the spawn chunk area."
ethoslab,36k5gt,Antice,-4,Wed May 20 12:18:00 2015 UTC,"Of course he won't use it. The repeater delay is waaay to long for anything of this scale to be time efficient. That's not why he's building it.  Also, while we're here, does the design he is using for the hexYdecimal decoder using account for order of input? From the quick glance I could take at it, it didn't seem like it could, but I might be wrong. Can he differentiate from say, 1A and A1? What about 11? If not, he'll need a memory layer to store the first press, and only fire at the second button push."
ethoslab,36k5gt,vilkav,3,Wed May 20 10:27:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked at it, although I'd say it stores it, so all 00-FF would be useable."

ethoslab,36jz16,Dobert,10,Wed May 20 00:47:22 2015 UTC,"Not only did he figure them out so early, he rediscovered how boats worked every update, when something inevitably broke. Until about 1.6, that is. No one understands boats now."

ethoslab,36fcl7,ikillspacies,2,Tue May 19 09:25:19 2015 UTC,"Other notable advantage: much better recording fidelity.  Get a SM58, preamp, decent sound card, stand and pop filter. Can't get much better than this."
ethoslab,36fcl7,Artefact2,2,Tue May 19 12:23:17 2015 UTC,The SM58 isn't really good for recording spoken voice (or recording in general) It's more a live mic.  A condenser mic would be better for recording.
ethoslab,36fcl7,DanyTheRed,1 point,Tue May 19 20:52:13 2015 UTC,You're probably right. But it'll still be lightyears ahead any headset mike (while being affordable and virtually indestructible).

ethoslab,36fcl7,TweetPoster,9,Mon May 18 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"I recommend getting a very nice set of headphones and a good XLR microphone or a very nice USB condenser microphone like the Audio Technica AT2020 (Which also comes in XLR.) He may need to throw in a sound card if he really wants to get some extremely good headphones, but if he wants to go and grab some Audio Technica Ath-M50X's he would probably be fine.  EDIT: /u/EthosLab, if you see this and you're considering getting a Logitech G930, DO NOT GET THE HEADSET. It is known for having many connectivity issues as well as many other miscellaneous ones."
ethoslab,36fcl7,daytdog,1 point,Tue May 19 05:18:28 2015 UTC,The AT2020 and the M50X are very good products and not too expensive either.

Both are consider to be amongst the best budget piece of equipment you can get for your home studio (in their respective category).

ethoslab,36fsx7,K_nikk,1 point,Tue May 19 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"I agree about the building thing - and so many of his series are building based.  I watched Impulse's Gamemode 4 the other day, and his explanation for his plan for that series got me thinking about the issues with Flyboys for Etho.  So Impulse is approaching gamemode 4 as a sort of test venue to build things you only could do with those modules and take them as far as they can go (paraphrased), rather than approaching it like a Let's Play series.  For example, what crazy thing can you come up with if you can put spawners on minecarts.  I LOVE this idea for the series, and made me the most excited of all the Gamemode 4 videos I've seen so far - and all he did was explain his concept!  I was wondering if that same spark could happen with Fly Boys if one could find a similar frame of viewing the series.  How to take advantage of a modded, combat, aircraft minecraft series with building leading up to a final battle - something that would be challenging and exciting as a concept and where it would have to be done in Flyboys, otherwise you would lose the opportunity to do it, which would make it more rewarding to do.  This is sort of a mental/creative exercise and what I came up with as a first pass was building aerial battlefields.  These would be structures and traps that you have to navigate through while flying and with well placed shots trigger traps on enemies in pursuit (or have passive traps waiting to be sprung on enemies up ahead).  I sort of picture it like the Death Star combat sequence in Star Wars, but maybe more zig zaggy.  This would be something that isn't really building as a main focus, it allows for coming up with potentially new ways of employing game mechanics, and something that even while building he can be testing out and improving his flight skills (a skill he can't really work on in his other series).  Anyway, it was just an exercise to see how one could think about a series in such a way that it becomes incentivizing and rewarding."
ethoslab,36fsx7,Remembermybrave,23,Fri May 22 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"As harsh as it sounds, I think that Etho needs to come to a decision on that series. I don't think it's fair to the others on his team to have an indecisive/inactive member.  Edit: I do want to say that I enjoy the series, but Etho has a habit recently of just not posting a series until we can only assume it's cancelled. I just wish he would give us definitive ending to some."
ethoslab,36fsx7,Xanthelei,6,Tue May 19 04:35:21 2015 UTC,"Ha, I know; he does that with his projects in his single-player world. I was really into that battle arena he started building, and then, poof, no more. It's alright. I know he needs to jump around to keep up his interest."

ethoslab,36fsx7,torham,4,Tue May 19 06:02:58 2015 UTC,We here are fine with how Etho's been handling Flyboys. Skirmishes and battles along with the occasional so I built this for strategic reasons works. Not everything has to be done with such clockwork regularity. Sometimes it's nice to have a Flyboys surprise in amongst the regular videos.
ethoslab,36fsx7,fdagpigj,3,Wed May 20 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"I was really looking forward to seeing his response to Bdub's ""design"", which I believe Etho said he had lined up with schematicraft.  Pungence briefly showed a building that Etho made, but he didn't show it up close because he didn't want to spoil the reveal.  The video is here.  Anyway, as others have mentioned, Etho has talked about it in his Twitch live streams.  I'm pretty sure he mentioned it in the May 17th stream, I think towards the end of the video when he was working on the nether tunnel, and it did seem like he might do the final battle but that's it.  I guess he has felt the need to scrap most of what he has recorded as he didn't think it was entertaining enough."
ethoslab,36fsx7,Dead_Moss,1 point,Tue May 19 05:26:33 2015 UTC,"Really, I remembered it being towards the beginning of the stream that he said it, when he worked on the nexus... I guess I might be misremembering."

And honestly, if Etho's not happy with it, then we probably wouldn't be either. Etho's been doing this long enough to have a good sense of his limits.  Personally, I didn't enjoy the building parts of the series, but the finale was awesome. And Etho's said before that he likes variety and new things (List of Unfinished Projects anyone?) so I imagine, the constant building is grating on him (just my personal theory)."

Less interaction is best if the community is somewhat controlling itself.  Mods are doing their job even if it's behind the scenes.  If you're talking about from a community building focus - maybe more could be done. Not sure if this subreddit is large enough for it, but I wouldn't mind having weekly small questions threads, or weekly free-talk threads. This is something an ordinary user could potentially start as well, but for a regular thing probably makes more sense if it's scheduled by a Mod.  Again, don't know if there would be enough interest in the community to justify it though."

ethoslab,36dgwj,JaysRooted,2,Mon May 18 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"Thats not entirely true. The amount of moderators isn't useally based on the amount of content, but on the amount of time the moderators are avaiable. For example to moderate the subreddit for 24 hours a day with 2 active moderators would mean that both need to be online for at least twelve hours a day. Then there is the problem of timezones. If both moderators live in the US, then there are gaps in which there is no moderation."
ethoslab,36dgwj,TranceRealistic,7,Mon May 18 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Moderation is almost entirely based on the amount of content, number of subscribers, and the general community.  This community is relatively self governing, there aren't that many subscribers, and there isn't a whole ton of content.  The number of moderators is HEAVILY linked to the amount of content, not on the times they're available.    Six moderators is frankly too much for this sub.  There's no way that most of them have any impact on the sub *coughrestylingcough*"

This subreddit has on average 7 posts per day, that is, if no posts got removed the last few days, but I doubt that would change the numbers a lot.

ethoslab,36b3fk,KoolbIade,2,Mon May 18 05:21:05 2015 UTC,He actually started doing 'normal length' videos rather soon. From episode 13+ the length is about the same as it is nowadays. (source)
ethoslab,36970c,davmc,22,Sun May 17 11:55:20 2015 UTC,"Redstone Device Tutorial: He talked about doing a tutorial video on basic redstone devices - hopper clocks, randomizers, T-flipflops  etc.  Please oh please yes.  I agree that the redstone can be daunting when you don't know the basic devices.  I can do digital logic on paper, and knowing how that translates into redstone would demystify it and help me build my own stuff.  Reading through wiki's can be confusing for me - I do better with hands on - module based direction of the basic elements - what its doing, what the pen and paper equivalent is in digital logic, tips for using them in ways that aren't obvious (like using repeaters to prevent side power).  Hermitcraft GM4 and ""too many series"" comments:  I appreciate the thought he puts into what becomes a series or not, and what he decides to post.  Knowing that he films and does a lot of things that he doesn't post (and he's done that for a while) to me shows that he also genuinely likes playing these games.  Even if he doesn't show his GM4 perspective, I hope he still will play it on his own time.   He was up to his old hijinks again, lighting stuff on fire, joking around - he seemed so relaxed and if that was because he wasn't worried about turning it into a series, then I'm all for it.  As long as someone is able to capture that stuff now and then. :)    His chemistry with the group is starting to find its groove and I'm very happy about that - really liking his interactions with Sl1pg8r..  Regarding Microsoft Office - There are tons of software that can do very similar things.  Needing to understand/be comfortable with using Microsoft Office comes down to standards.  When you are working jointly on a project, or start a new job, having to relearn all the processor/spreadsheet/database/presentation software is a stumbling block.  It's a good idea to be strong/competent in the industry standard in order to be efficient and keep your skills competitive.  And in most places, Microsoft office is the industry standard for productivity software.  Was he joking about the Microsoft Office stuff?  Hard to tell.  Anyway, our IT person had suggested we use Open Office for a coop student, and so this topic had recently come up.  EDIT:  That post did not look so big in the edit."

ethoslab,366gww,torham,2,Sat May 16 20:06:31 2015 UTC,What makes you think he stopped just because he hasn't done it in a few weeks?

Also you can tell at this point Etho feels a bit uncomfortable talking and doing a commentary. I thought it was hilarious watching Etho being so careless and taking damage on Hard mode :D When Etho started building his subway station, he used even numbers! (Something Etho would never do now)"
ethoslab,364qvt,GummiB12,6,Sat May 16 12:47:13 2015 UTC,"Perhaps only do that on days when Etho doesn't upload, and perhaps also on weekends? I'm mainly just worried that people mightn't have time to watch an old episode every day."

ethoslab,364qvt,Zwockl9001,1 point,Sat May 16 10:34:47 2015 UTC,"Althoug i have been around for a very long time i don't really feel the need to go back to these first episodes. I have never played those early versions of Minecraft and i never heard of Etho when these Videos were released. A while ago i took the time and started watching from Episode 104-200 (i joined at 200 thanks to Doc) and while i didn't watch every single Episode i have a pretty good idea what was going on in most of these/i now know all the projects in his world.  So what i instead like to do is rewatch the other older Series. I watched his Harvest Moon LP three times now and all of his playthroughs of CTM maps at least twice.  I also watched all the PVP videos again and the RFW tournaments that i had never watched before, very entertaining!  So yeah, i won't really watch the early Episodes of his LP-World, but i tend to bingewatch his older series."
ethoslab,364qvt,Xanthelei,2,Sat May 16 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"I completely get why you don't feel like watching the older episodes, but feel I should warn you the world he started on isn't his Man Cave world, meaning there are projects he didn't or couldn't recreate, and there are a lot of things you'll miss out on if you decide to not watch them. A lot of those things have been inside jokes for long time Etho fans, and its always made me sad when people didn't get them. Things such as Spaz, evil chickens, the clay, bad monster AI shenanigans (such as standing next to a creeper and holding a conversation with it for minutes), hilarious and epic Etho derps, and so on. Plus all the times he switched to peaceful to avoid creepers blowing his contraptions up... Only to have the explosion happen anyway.  If you ever get bored, it really is worth watching. Partly because it's amazing to see how far he's come, a little bit to marvel at the old mechanics and what they allowed, but mostly to watch him evolve as a let's player. There are so many times he got himself into major trouble and couldn't get out (or barely pulled off a miracle escape!), and his reaction to those has always been funny.  So I get it, but I want anyone who's deciding if they want to watch the older episodes or not to really know what they're passing on. Informed decisions and all that. :)"
ethoslab,364qvt,Dabien,1 point,Sat May 16 18:29:45 2015 UTC,"Ethos voice in these early episodes really reminds me of Nebris - It was odd seeing coal only give 1 piece per block for the most part as well. It's been years and years since I've watched these though, great idea!"

ethoslab,364qvt,Dirtland,1 point,Sun May 17 00:28:04 2015 UTC,"I just watched his first video. Not hard since it's only 15 minutes long. He had his funny dry sense of humor then, too. When he referenced a link, that's what you click on: ""this link"". Did any of you click on it? I did; it's only a few minutes long. It was uploaded Dec 6 without a mic; and then 11 days later he uploads his first lp - with a mic. It's funny how even back then he jumped right into a project."

ethoslab,3604g2,blazingxstar,15,Fri May 15 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"This was great.  Really enjoyed the PVP and all the interactions.  Was sort of put off by Docm's commentary - seemed kind of .... passive aggressive in tone (not sure if that's the right description?), but it made me very aware how positive Etho was as a player.  Genuine compliments when the others are doing well (called Python a elite sniper, compliment False on her fast reflex), laughing off being killed, having huge fun with grenades (""Surprise!"") even in tense moments.  I feel the others enjoyed that too.  Slip also stood out as enjoyable commentary.  He did some ""trash talking"" (good naturedly; I don't think either False's or Slips' qualifies as real trash talking), but it was so good natured, and so peppered with random things like ""tee-hee"",  and ""Etho! You're good at this game!"" that it was really fun.  Happy to hear they are thinking to do more of this if people like it - now just hoping enough people liked this as much as I did.    Edit:  at the end of False's POV she shows the score.  Etho came in second, just behind PythonGB.  Third was a long ways away.  Not too shabby.  I really recommend watching all the POV's, and Doc's last three minutes are interesting because it's a different level of tense where just get to hear the others comments and see the scroll of kills and otherwise have to imagine what's going on and what will come around the corner.  PythonGB had a good video too - used a kill counter - made me wish everyone had that."
ethoslab,3604g2,K_nikk,4,Fri May 15 00:02:43 2015 UTC,"so glad he's back to playing pvp and posting it. I know it won't get as many views, but personally those are some of my favorite Etho videos."
ethoslab,3604g2,sag969,3,Fri May 15 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"""Etho should put more videos up"" is pretty much the #1 complaint he gets, and hopefully PvP vids don't take much off-camera stuff so I highly support him posting more of these.  Also, it's fun watching etho PvP. Looking at othellomc's KD ratio list, etho carried his team so hard in terms of kills, and also got the most kills of the game. WOOOT #ETHOP"

He was using it for race for the wool and it went like this:  You have chests at your spawn full of your valuable items so that they were easy to access in demand.  To access them, you would toss a pearl up and then have a teammate kill you so that you went to spawn, and then after you get the needed items from the chests you tp back to where you died.  This could also be exploited as a way to regain entry to any pvp scenario.  You can probably see why that was changed now."

ethoslab,3619m6,Talon2863,3,Fri May 15 06:32:38 2015 UTC,"I like your idea of adding new commands in a not hard coded way, but this code has one big flaw: it's not persistent. Each time you restart the program or the minecraft world you will lose your store commands in the table. Using the file = io.open(""filename"",""w"") and file:write() commands you can store information as files on the computer.    Also I don't think you can use the jTable variable across different programs. (When using the shell.run(""addCommand"") instead of putting the code in the main program.) You can fix this by letting the 'callee' write to a file and let the 'caller' read it. (I don't think lua lets programs return a result like c/c++ does.)"
ethoslab,3619m6,Tonlim,2,Fri May 15 10:07:16 2015 UTC,"jTable is a global variable, so it can be used across other programs by default. As long as a variable is declared as local, it defaults to global. (at least that's how it worked for me).  Also return in this case actually exits the addCommand program. It returns to the main program since addCommand is being run from inside the startup program. It kinda threw me for a loop at first, cause I'm used to return meaning something else. :)  Thanks for catching the other bit though! I'll fix it right now."
ethoslab,3619m6,Tonlim,3,Fri May 15 18:10:29 2015 UTC,You've got me. I have no idea how lua works interally. It's not like java or c++ as it turns out. ;)

ethoslab,35w4jz,kyronalextaylor,14,Thu May 14 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: REPLACE THE SOUL-SAND WITH A SLIME-BLOCK FOR MUCH BETTER* STABILITY.  (the ender-pearl will never directly hit the slime-block, like in Etho's current design, but will still bounce while it's glitched into the block. I've stress-tested it and with the slime-block, I've never had a problem.) http://i.imgur.com/tfDmgpJ.png (just a thought, maybe adding a soul-sand-block on top of the slime-block would increase the stability if you're having problems? Although, from my experience, this seems to work perfectly.)  I didn't create a tutorial as it's a fairly straight-forward design and you can copy it fairly easy just by looking at it. Whatcha think?  *As far as my testing has gone (and I've done a looot of testing.) it's 100% effective. Though a couple of redditers have reported some problems with the pearl dropping sometimes."
ethoslab,35w4jz,QQII,7,Thu May 14 00:26:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool, it looks like it relies in the same idea as test's design, but it is much smaller.  How stable is it? Does it trigger when there is a lag spike like Etho's current design?"
ethoslab,35w4jz,dado3212,2,Thu May 14 07:16:23 2015 UTC,"Yesterday, it seemed perfect, however, today, I tried messing with some insta-wire elsewhere and it seemed to trigger it.

ethoslab,35w4jz,_ladyofwc_,8,Thu May 14 16:47:46 2015 UTC,This is awesome!  The only thing that was weird was that I constantly had a visual glitch of the Ender Pearl floating downward before the game relocated it to in the soul sand.  I did some testing and the highest you can have it above the initial launch is ~35 blocks (how far up the Ender Pearl can go).
ethoslab,35w4jz,thesnakeinyourboot,2,Thu May 14 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does have a slight visual glitch. Thanks for testing that. (: Neat info."

ethoslab,35x05n,Veloxiczz,12,Thu May 14 05:25:58 2015 UTC,"Nexus is the name Etho assigned to the item sorter/delivery system, he could have just as well named it ""The Sorta-Farter"". But, he didn't, he calls this machine ""The Nexus"". It is not a native term to the game. I think that is where the confusion found you... it is a very complicated machine, with many parts built over several episode, I am surprised that more confused questions have not turned up."
ethoslab,35x05n,ThimbleStudios,9,Thu May 14 11:17:59 2015 UTC,"A Nexus is a place where things meet for example, a big server spawn might be considered a nexus.  Nexus generally means to connect multiple thing together."
