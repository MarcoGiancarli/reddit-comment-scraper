tonsilstones,3dx73n,Redeemd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:33:22 2015 UTC,The big group is actually all connected. They look to be separate stones morphed together. Anyway it's been a year since I got any stones and I got the ol cough bad breath. I knew right away I was in for a treat. I pushed ONCE and all these guys came shoot in out. I rinsed my mouth well and went to bed. Woke up to a couple more in the back of my throat!
tonsilstones,3d3abu,Tuvaluan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:27:39 2015 UTC,I pop them like zits.
tonsilstones,3d3abu,GiveMeHopeIn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:32:06 2015 UTC,What about a zit poper? Or a hair pin?
tonsilstones,3czqp5,pandroidgaxie,7,Sun Jul 12 06:44:08 2015 UTC,"Great post. It should also be noted that the tonsils are one of the body's earliest defense mechanisms from infection, which is why they shouldn't just be taken out for the fun of it. Tonsils are meant to protect you from infections, and unless they are the ones causing infections or other serious problems, leave them in!"
tonsilstones,3czqp5,MarvinHubert,2,Sun Jul 12 06:48:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I've added your very important info above, I think you present a very excellent point. indeed I pondered this risk even though I had ""legit"" reasons for surgery. I hope my post reflects the proper tone - scientists get things wrong, and we are the ones who will be stuck with it."
tonsilstones,3czqp5,blakedev,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:09:52 2015 UTC,"I had kinda intended on the sub being just pictures and videos of tonsil stones. Not long after I created it a lot of posts came up about tonsillectomies, but a lot were spam and ads, which I removed.   If there is enough interest I can add some sort of FAQ to the sidebar, but it may take some time since I'm pretty busy with work and moving at the moment."
tonsilstones,3czqp5,Bagofgoldfish,2,Sun Jul 12 21:40:36 2015 UTC,"np, if people aren't interested or it needs to wait, it's okay. I definitely don't want to see spam and ads, and you have been great about deleting those!"
tonsilstones,3czqp5,Dragin410,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:39:51 2015 UTC,"Many years ago I read about a woman who removed most of her own tonsils. I can't  find anything about the story now, but she had no insurance. Every so often, after a night of drinking, she would cut out a bit from each tonsil. Somehow she didn't die from blood loss or infection. She finally got in to see a doctor, and was told she did a pretty good job."
tonsilstones,3czqp5,BeatingHattedWhores,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:20:06 2015 UTC,Please source this. Im nearly to the point of doing this myself.
tonsilstones,3czqp5,drowningwithoutwater,2,Sat Jul 18 16:25:09 2015 UTC,"Please don't, you could really hurt yourself with amateur surgery."
tonsilstones,3bglg5,matttheman11,8,Mon Jun 29 01:19:19 2015 UTC,"I don't like flushing them down my throat. I like the satisfaction of digging them out, smelling them, and smushing them around with my fingers."
tonsilstones,3bglg5,iminakvltlol,3,Tue Jun 30 08:31:12 2015 UTC,Amen!
tonsilstones,3bglg5,cindyyyy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:14:32 2015 UTC,Found out there was a subreddit for this thanks to google and can't believe I'm not the only weirdo who does this. The fuck?
tonsilstones,3bglg5,readyfuels,2,Mon Jul 20 06:21:57 2015 UTC,I'd rather use a q-tip if it means I don't have to swallow it.
tonsilstones,3bglg5,User-With-No-Name,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:21:09 2015 UTC,That looked like a big one that was missed at 0:32s
tonsilstones,3bglg5,ckelly4200,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:48:31 2015 UTC,I looked at the video again and couldn't see anything.  Sometimes the light reflects off of the water to give the impression that something is there.
tonsilstones,3barhc,SirP3rry,8,Sat Jun 27 12:24:03 2015 UTC,"Ouch. Guess you should go hunting in your tonsils for more! And video it, of course."
tonsilstones,3barhc,Spikekuji,4,Sat Jun 27 14:20:23 2015 UTC,Honestly I can't see any more and I only get these once every few months. I would love to know how I can search for more and how I can remove them as well.
tonsilstones,3barhc,Spikekuji,3,Sun Jun 28 00:02:46 2015 UTC,"Youtube, my friend. It will be your greatest ally."
tonsilstones,3barhc,pandroidgaxie,2,Sun Jun 28 00:11:33 2015 UTC,"damn, it's almost the size of a tooth!  Have a look at my playlist (that sounds weird.) http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfogrA91v5KqmZ5JorGpZoMGR503AF06O The first 4-5 are mage-epic third world vids. But after that, just regular folks at home. As much as I love watching these, it's best to leave your tonsils alone to expel them naturally. Digging in there is for desperate victims suffering from the smell. The playlist has a text description explaining. Enjoy!"
tonsilstones,39xw9p,WardofFame,3,Mon Jun 15 18:13:53 2015 UTC,"You're fine. Tonsil stones are normal. A lot of people - my husband and myself included - get them from time to time, often for no apparent reason. When we get them, both of us notice it because we'll feel a hard bump when we swallow. I will use a q-tip to dislodge them if it really bugs me. I've heard that gargling with apple cider vinegar can help prevent them, but I get them so rarely I don't worry about it.  The human body is a weird place, but not everything is a sign of something bad."
tonsilstones,39xw9p,rbaltimore,2,Tue Jun 16 00:18:12 2015 UTC,thank you!
tonsilstones,39xw9p,ArtimusX,2,Tue Jun 16 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"Keep a strict oral hygiene and floss everyday. At age 15, you probably don't have crypts in your tonsils so I wouldn't be concerned about food particles being trapped there.   I believe tonsil stones are common as everyone should get them especially after a cold or a serious case of allergies. Tonsils act as filters from Upper Respiratory infections, so tonsil stones may just be a by-product of that. Also be careful prodding your tonsils, don't do it with a dirty nail finger. Use something that is clean and sterilized, and not sharp. If you poke your tonsil and it starts to bled, just stop."
tonsilstones,39xw9p,ArtimusX,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:10:14 2015 UTC,could it be that it was a coincidence? My tonsils look fine and today even though I still had that tickling in my throat there was no thingy coming out when I coughed. thank you anyways!
tonsilstones,39xw9p,pandroidgaxie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:17:25 2015 UTC,"When you swallow saliva and feel like there's something in your throat or feel as if you have a piece of popcorn stuck in your throat, chances are that it's probably a tonsil stone. Even a tiny tonsil stone can feel larger than it is. It should probably go away after a few days, but if it persists for weeks, I'd take another look."
