hacking,3dx72y,Callico-Jack,8,Mon Jul 20 20:43:39 2015 UTC,"CRC32 basically just runs and keeps tabs on shit detecting errors if they occur.  But it is vulnerable to an overflow attack since there is an open port.  Page 13 of this PDF shows you how to code a simple program that could have prevented this  This new code implemented into SSH1 uses an algorithm to detect CRC-32 compensation attack exploitation by passing SSH1 packets received by the system to the detect_attack() function.  In English, when someone dials in, the new code will check to see if someone is trying to use this exploit.  In the code excerpt above, buf is the SSH1 packet received, and  len is the length of the packet.    A valid packet when received is actually a number of blocks of cipher text of size set by SSH_BLOCKSIZE.  Each of them is checked against the others to verify that different packets do  not have the same CRC value, which does not normally occur in  an SSH1 data stream.    Basically, the Matrix turned on CRC32 to check for errors, but the program itself HAS a flaw that can also be hacked.  If the Matrix anti-virus had done his homework, he could have prevented this, but that also would have introduced a fix to a zero-day that isn't supposed to be known in the simulated time-line, which is probably where his manager stepped in and said, ""Don't worry, nobody knows this zero day exists yet"" or some bullshit."

I find it very strange for a home connection to come under a sustained DDoS attack are you 100% sure it isn't an issue with your connection or ISP? Have you called your ISP and told them what has been going on? They may monitor your internet traffic and block any attacks or see if there are any other issues with your connection. Have you tried other PCs on the network, do they encounter the same issues? The problems with KiK and your phone doesn't sound like anything related and is probably just a random glitch with that app. I don't believe there is any way somebody could prevent your phone from charging.  Now on to DDoS attacks. Assuming you have a dynamic IP (most people do these days) rebooting your router would usually allocate you a new address, or at least every few hours it would do, but this depends on your ISP. This IP change would usually be enough to stop a DDoS attack. If it is a targeted attack somebody would be obtaining your IP each time you have been allocated a new address. You need to find out where the person is getting your IP from. The most common method is through the skype API, it's easy to prevent this. Just go into the connection settings on Skype and select the option ""Allow direct connections to your contacts only."" - delete any persons from your contact list who you don't know. There are other methods people could use to get your IP but they are less reliable, maybe an admin of a forum you go on regularly or admin of a game server you play on?   If you have a static IP the only way to sort the issue would be to contact your ISP and have them change the address, I've never had to do this before so really not sure how that would go down. I imagine it is a service your ISP would offer for free if you are being attacked.  Also, if you haven't done this already It's worth checking for malware on your PC, I find the best program for this is Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. Go and download it, if you already have it make sure it is updated the the latest version. Once updated, click the Settings tab, followed by Detection and Protection and tick Scan for rootkits. Click the Scan tab, ensure Threat Scan is selected and click Start Scan. You may see the following message, ""Could not load DDA driver"". Click Yes, allow your PC to reboot and continue afterwards. If threats are detected, click Remove Selected. If you are prompted to reboot, click Yes.  If you want me to look over the Malwarebytes logs I would be happy to do this, upon completion of the scan (or after the reboot), click the History tab. Click Application Logs and double-click the Scan Log. Click Copy to Clipboard and paste the log to pastebin.com and provide the link to me via a PM. I may be able to give you some more detailed information about any threats you had on your system."

Every website has it's own architecture and then you will need to find vulnerabilities depending on it. I'd say LFI is very underestimated, LFI allows you to read arbitrary files on the server and let's say you want access to the DBMS because that gives you a strong foothold unless you only have USAGE permissions. Any web application will always have a file that contains a DBMS username and password in clear text, you can always use that to read that file and boom, you have access to the DB and can get all the hashes. Even though pretty much XSS and SQLi are the most common ones, it's INDEED an ART to successfully exploit. It's not just as simple as typing queries in a URL. Consider, WAFs, large amounts of data, boring means of exploitation such as blind-based. My advice to you would to master SQLi and XSS first before looking for others.

If you have a device with a wifi client that just shrugs, says, ""Oh well,"" and silently connects to an open network on a profile that has been configured to use a PSK, something is dreadfully wrong.

Some of it is you need to figure out what it is you want to hack. And perhaps a more important question - why? For example, if you're pretty savvy with coding, you could pour over code and find vulnerabilities. Then you could report those vulnerabilities to the companies who create the software. And disclosure policy is really a whole thing in and of itself. You can actually make really good money just doing that, because if you do this a few times you'll start earn a name for yourself and could eventually be hired as a consultant.  In my case, I'm learning more about network protocol because I want to be a professional Penetration Tester, specializing is exploiting Wireless and web-based vulnerabilities.  If you're looking at learning how to hack because it could land you a career, I'd recommend continuing doing private education. If you decide you like it, consider attending a vocational school or college, and/or getting some certifications. Net+ is a good initial goal.

If you want to write scripts to do your hacking for you (and you do), I recommend learning how to write SHELL scripts. Automating tasks is way better than typing each and every command yourself.

So, the hacker would need the key and to be able to inject themselves into communication between the website and the end user.  Obviously, if they could do so at the server or data center, then having the key wouldn't be any more helpful with that level of access.  So the key would need to be used close to the end user.  The end user would need to be identified, then a MITM attack or network snooping setup on them.    While it sounds all insecure, really, there are far easier ways of doing that attack that don't require hacking an email, then finding and setting up an MITM style attack or snooping on a connection.

First of all, you don't need to hack an email; these are sent in plain text unencrypted, so anyone on the network path it was  on can see them. Second, if it's so useless, why don't you publish all your SSL keys for all the websites under your control?  Third, what ""easier"" method is there for passive decrypting https connections or actively mitming an https connection than this?    The end user would need to be identified, then a MITM attack or network snooping setup on them.   Or set up a proxy server, then mitm all https connections through it that you've got the key for."
hacking,3djz5q,dczx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:12:30 2015 UTC,"First, very few emails now days are sent in plain text unencrypted.  Almost all users have started using TLS, which means the emails would be transmitted encrypted in transit.    On the third point, if you have the key, then you have to be able to see the traffic between the site and the user in order to decrypt it.  That means you have to be tapped in very close to the server or very close to the end user.  Neither of those are easy, most require physical connections at the location.  True a proxy server would be a great way to go, but the user would still need to be using the proxy server.  It is simply too much work to steal an SSL key and then try to get that traffic.  Sure, if it were Amazon or Bank of America, then yea, go for it, having a key like that might be really useful.  Having a key for Bob's Putty Store who sells putty to 20 people a month isn't going to be as useful."

It's about understanding the system you administer and being able to use and understand the code it runs. If you can't code at all you can't really understand what it is you manage. So much hacking comes from clueless admins that don't even understand how to use the services they run. The IT deficit is staggering.

There was way too much misunderstanding about it all.  To answer one outstanding question: 15.247 covers DSSS as well as FHSS, and I think 802.11g/n/ac/ah all count as DSSS.  Those rules, though, also apply to non-spread-spectrum digital signals of at least 500 kHz bandwidth, and certainly all forms of WiFi meet that definition.  While field strengths are painstaking to measure, you can get a theoretical field strength by slapping some math on it.  I think the actual power level ends up being really, really small (orders of magnitude below 1W).  This might bolster the belief that WiFi isn't under 15.249 because devices up to 500mW are readily availble and FCC certified.  73, KC2IDF"

By using slang and internet/SMS style language, the hacking community can communicate under the radar of an automatic translator, requiring a native to understand.     meaning that with the right now how, you can create code that is only known by the creator(s). so if you and me created some slang terms and was able to include this within our coding, the only people who would understand or know the slang terms are you, myself and anyone we tell.

In actuality, the web administrator will either ignore you or mentally credit himself with finding the error. You feel morally obligated to help other people when they're in trouble. This is why you spend so much time on community service, why you often give 30% tips, and will contact the administrator anonymously and not receive any credit. I didn't think so.   Reasons not to tell them   Hackers deserve to be paid and acknowledged for their hard work. Giving your work away for free only takes away potential business from other people in the security community. Another hacker might have fun discovering this vulnerability, just as you did.

I started learning, achieved a basic knowledge of x86 assembler and brushed up on my Memory & stack knowledge.  And boom, took me like 5 minutes.  See its not about learning how to hack, its about learning the things required to hack.   Hacking is simply an outcome of knowing the functions of a computer.

That aside though, your assertion that this is ""clearly illegal"" remains faulty.  There have been some suggestions that it runs afoul of part 97, but that's pretty well debunked at this point, both legally and logically, to wit:  This thing is just a RasPi plugged into an off-the-shelf 900mhz bridge.  If running encryption over it runs afoul of part 97, then every such bridge would essentially suffer from the same problem, as exactly zero people in the world are going to say, ""Well, we're using a wireless bridge - guess we need to broadcast everything in the clear!""

I didn't get to demo one, so I don't know if it's 'Just a RasPi plugged into an off-the-shelf 900mhz bridge'. I didn't know you got to test one.   The fact that 'Ham' was in the name, at least suggests that it's using ham frequencies, though again, since I didn't get to use one like you did, I can't say for sure.   If course, I never said that I had used one.I didn't realize anyone had. So far as I knew, there was an announcement and everything that anyone has said about technical details is really practically baseless.   I didn't mean to suggest that anyone 'threatened' them.

They tend to be 900MHZ <-> wired ethernet instead of 900MHZ <-> 802.11, but we're not talking about a particularly daunting engineering task to change that.

They are resume fodder for individuals and brochure fodder for companies.  There will never be another GOBBLES sec presentation.

Once you understand that the entire thing is just a marketing opportunity, it's not a far walk, at all, to, ""Oh, look, yet another stupid DEFCON talk marketing stunt.""  In fact, for far less effort, you get vastly more benefit from a suddenly-canceled talk than you ever would from the talk itself.  Had this presentation gone on as planned, most of the industry would have gone, ""Oh, he plugged a RasPi into a 900MHZ bridge.  Cute.""    Someone - Violet Blue, perhaps - would have written an on-point and technically accurate piece focusing on the social and political aspects of such a device in thwarting the surveillance efforts of oppressive regimes.

hacking,3d7frz,aydiosmio,3,Tue Jul 14 06:00:42 2015 UTC,"That default seems ok and is much faster, but if I have time, I figure, why not scan all ports.   Because it's largely pointless, as very little is hosted on ports beyond that range, and even less of it is worthwhile.    Imagine you want to go deer hunting.  You live in a mostly urbanized area, but there's a small, wooded game preserve nearby.  If you have the time, I guess you could go scope out the intersection of State & Main, and then maybe hit the Whole Foods parking lot... but you're probably not going to do that, right?"

It's very important to be mindful of your footprint on any network, especially during a pentest. You should always start small. You don't want to tell nmap to say hi to every single port on a /8 in one go, like a highschool freshman hopped up on Red Bull trying to pick up chicks at the mall; Paul Blart might take notice and cockblock your ass. Instead, start with common ports, and direct more verbose scans to smaller ranges of targets as you increase your familiarity with the network."

Ultimately, I will split up my scans to the best ports at first, and have separate scans later for some ports that I still want to scan but are less desirable. I was monitoring my throughput . 40 concurrent nmap scans running on polite speed -T2 was 10,000 bytes/sec.  However, it was a continuous stream for many hours and never completed.

This is harassment and defamation of character, so your aunt could speak with a lawyer to go over options for pursuing the perpetrator. The only ""hacking"" advise might be to find the unique ID (not just fake name) associated with these fake profiles and keep a list of these UID's with dates you discovered them, and the dates you reported them to Facebook. These UID's will help build a case. I don't have a facebook account so I can't tell you how to find this UID."

Just keep reporting the pages and eventually they should lose interest in this. It my take a while but there isn't much else you can do (legally). Once you get their IP you could always scan the address with NMAP to see which services they are running, and take it from there if you aren't worried about the legal ramifications and have the technical skills.

Anything on computing devices isn't going to last a lifetime so I put nothing on them I would be unhappy to lose or others view. My favourite photos are collected and printed into bound books, I only listen to the radio so don't store music. For everything I type if it is important it is either on a blog or in self-published book, so its on the web somewhere. Outside of corporate work I only work on and use open source projects so they are all replicated elsewhere. Inside corporates its up to them to backup the work I do for them. I don't root my Android phone. I never do Internet banking/shopping outside my home. My bank uses two factor authentication via an electronic key. I use only web based email. I don't use social networks, Anything else auto-syncs to cloud storage. I don't live in a big city so I'm not worried about WiFi hacking (some people round here have never owned a computer). I have a long and different password for every account but don't use a password manager, just an algorithm I can run in my head to generate the password. I know what processes should be running on my devices so I can kill anything suspicious.I never backup my systems as I've only had two disk failures in thirty years of computing and when it happens it's usually time to invest in new hardware and reinstall the OS for a clean start."

Then, NYSE releases the following explanation as to the halting of floor trading...     The exchange said the root cause of the problem had to do with the configuration compatibility of a software update[1]     I am not privy to the going-on's behind the scenes of the NYSE but I highly doubt that all of a sudden and out of the blue, the NYSE experienced a ""configuration compatibility"" issue with a software update. now I could be 101% wrong here, but I'd assume NYSE out of all institutions would run patches on test environments before fully implementing them just incase of issues like they are now claiming.    Edited to add the full statement for those interested in reading it. it comes from the same source.   ""On Tuesday evening, the NYSE began the rollout of a software release in preparation for the July 11 industry test of the upcoming SIP timestamp requirement. As is standard NYSE practice, the initial release was deployed on one trading unit. As customers began connecting after 7am on Wednesday morning, there were communication issues between customer gateways and the trading unit with the new release. It was determined that the NYSE and NYSE MKT customer gateways were not loaded with the proper configuration compatible with the new release. Prior to the market open, gateways were updated with the correct version of software and stocks opened at 9:30am. However, the update to the gateways caused additional communication issues between the gateways and trading units, which began to manifest themselves mid-morning. At 11:09am, NYSE issued a Market Status message that a technical issue was being investigated. At 11:32am, because NYSE and NYSE MKT were actively trading but customers were still reporting unusual system behavior, the decision was made to suspend trading on NYSE and NYSE MKT. NYSE ARCA, Arca Options and NYSE AMEX Options were not impacted by this event and continued to trade normally. NYSE and NYSE MKT began the process of canceling all open orders, working with customers to reconcile orders and trades, restarting all customer gateways and failing over to back-up trading units located in our Mahwah, NJ datacenter so trading could be resumed in a normal state. In consultation with regulators and industry, we determined that we would implement a complete restart and that NYSE MKT primary listings would resume trading at 3:05pm and NYSE primary listings and NYSE MKT Tape C symbols would resume trading at 3:10pm. Trading resumed as scheduled and the closing auctions accepted orders and executed normally. All NYSE and NYSE-MKT listed securities traded for the entire day either on NYSE and NYSE MKT or other market centers.""

hacking,3csxuu,-STIMUTAX-,7,Fri Jul 10 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"I was just discussing this with a friend yesterday.  What's also interesting is the Chinese stock market crashed 32% that day. The NYSE halt prevented a sell off of US investments by Chinese investors (who own a shit ton of US debt, commodities, and assets). Had the halt not occurred we could have seen a major crash in the U.S. markets that day which could have triggered further disastrous global events.   In theory, the same team that hacked the Hacking Team didn't actually have to be responsible for the attack on the NYSE. Since the HT data was leaked several days before any super power with a sophisticated IT team, such as China or even the NSA/USA could have downloaded the exploits and tools and then used them to prevent a sell off. It is even possible that the Chinese crash was inevitable and the intention for hacking the Hacking Team was to get what they needed to shut down the NYSE, and this whole thing was orchestrated.  My suspicion is they tested the tools on the Wall Street Journal and United Airlines first to make sure they worked, then took down the NYSE.    The Chinese market somehow miraculously rebounded the following day (granted it was mainly due to the Chinese government manipulating the market), and the U.S. mainstream media quickly buried all stories of a cyber attack.  Which means there's a few likely explanations:  1) The people who hacked the Hacking Team attacked the NYSE. It is possible that the Hacking Team was possibly even hacked by the U.S. or China, and the data was purposely leaked to misdirect suspicion as anyone with the proper knowledge and resources can now make use of these tools. Which makes it easier to blame Anonymous or even point the fingers at each other in case the truth ever comes to light.  2) China used the HT tools to take down the NYSE to prevent a sell off they would unlikely be able to recover from.  3) The U.S. Government hacked the NYSE to prevent a sell off that could have severely damaged the U.S. economy and relations with China.  4) A 3rd party such as Anonymous was responsible for the attacks and did it for the lols. You also have to keep in mind anyone can be a member of Anonymous. So a major government could easily throw up some tweets or a YouTube account and claim to take credit for an attack as member of Anon. Ironically Anonymous has set itself up to be the perfect fall entity in the event of a major attack.   Personally my money is on 1-3 as possibilities. These cyber attacks were perfectly timed to prevent the collapse of both the Chinese and U.S. markets and economies. They bought China time to correct their market and prevent a further crash, and kept Chinese investment in the U.S. The implications of what just happened on Wednesday are insane to think about and the fact the mainstream media went to such great lengths to cover this up is equally insane.  Speculation aside, whatever actually happened Wednesday even if you believe the official stories is frightening. If all of this was truly a side effect of incompetence that's probably far worse then any conspiracy theory. If your and my suspicions are correct then things are about to get much worse. Personally I believe we are in the middle of a cyber war right now, and with the upcoming elections a lot of information is about to come to light. Take into consideration the recent attacks against the Federal Government, the Health Insurance companies, and major retailers there's enough data available to easily socially engineer and manipulate our government agencies and major corporations. Factor in the global instability surrounding Russia, ISIS, and Greece and several major economic bubbles in the U.S. the next few months and years are going to be straight out of a science fiction novel."

hacking,3csxuu,lovedetroit,3,Sat Jul 11 00:18:37 2015 UTC,"The real coincidence here is the Chinese marketing crashing on the same day.  If this was just some random hack job the NASDAQ would have been a more visible target since they're mostly consumer brands.   Now here's the real kicker, maybe the U.S. had a hand in bringing down the Chinese market, so then China responded by hacking the NYSE to prevent a sell off. Maybe it was the U.S. intention to economically harm the Chinese and have Chinese investors pull out of the U.S. market on their own.   There's so many different possibilities.   It could have also been a 3rd party trying to bait the U.S. and China into a war. Or maybe the NYSE wasn't even attacked and they shut it down to prevent a sell off before it happened and just blamed it on this glitch and planted the seeds that it was hackers.   Unfortunately we will probably never know the truth. However, my intuition tells me something happened they aren't telling us, and whatever did happen is likely a precursor to future events."

Lulzsec had a member in their secondary ring that was involved in the BeEF project.  But what other members of the coding team for BeEF seemed unaware of was that BeEF was basically becoming a trojan for data-mining and zombifying any computer that had it installed.  Since BeEF was going to be standard issue with BackTrack, it was going to give LulzSec access to boxes used by top pen-testers for fortune 500 companies (well, that was their plan anyway).  This was supposed to be useful to their ""cause"" related to the 99% Occupy Wallstreet movement.    Well, someone from their Google chat rooms spilled the beans because LulzSec was testing the code on its own followers and fanbase.  This defector guy started touting himself as LulzSec 2.0 or something.    I'm not sure how much of this was true, but if they were delayed and then later succeeded in their plan, perhaps they could have just waited for a more opportune time to manipulate wall street.

In terms of computers it was when my primary school got computers with an internet connection and logging on as a pupil didnt allow you to open a browser, (it was for staff use only!)

hacking,3csto4,energyinmotion,2,Fri Jul 10 22:20:10 2015 UTC,"(The following information comes from my studies in network/IT security, I am not claiming to be a guru or anything.)    Some of the ways I've read up on involves spoofing of mac addresses, this allows more time for a hacker or group of hackers to cover tracks and distort evidence linking them to anything.    Some hackers also use zombie-systems, which is a system connected to the internet which has been hijacked (but allowed to continue normal operations to not alert the user(s).) and then used when the attack is implemented. to give a better visual, think about this... Let's say you're an hacker, and you want to launch a DoS or DDoS attack against a company or organization servers to take them offline for some time. first you'd recon and figure what server(s) are to be attacked, then you'd hijack a large number of pc's. once you're ready to launch the attack, you simply broadcast your commands to the zombie-systems and like loyal dogs, they'll DoS the s*** out of your target.    A hacker can protect themselves by wiping the logs on networking devices such as Routers, Switches, etc. if they're able to which would mean no log of ip's and nothing to search back through (although I believe most organizations and companies have some form of log keeping just in case of such event, so I am not sure how successful this method would be.)    And finally, installing backdoors into infected systems will allow you admin level access and therefore allow you to clear your foot-print when maneuvering through the infected system(s).

In addition to the return receipts, which you can configure mail clients like Outlook to send, you can embed a tracking pixel or bit of executable code into an image or HTML based email. As I mentioned, such a solution will not work in all cases and has significant downsides. For one thing, it is malware and a form of spam. For another thing, a securely administrated mail-server will not deliver messages of this type - strong mail servers deliver email as text, and advanced ISP and AV will pick up this sort of thing. Finally, sending such messages as part of a messaging campaign will degrade the reputation of your IP address as spam monitoring organizations blacklist your IP, making it impossible for you to send email to mailservers that use RBL's.

Filter {ForwardingAddress -ne $null} :- filters the output with an forwarding emailaddress is not equal to $null (no empty) ft Name,ForwardingAddress,DeliverToMailboxAndForward : again filter the output with only these columns (name, Forwarding address, deliver to mailbox and forward). -Autosize : if your output is too big, the full output is not shown and items that are over a certain entry are not shown, to avoid this and to output all details we use -autosize you can also re-direct this output from the screen to a file using 'Export-CSV' parameter. e.g.  Get-Mailbox -Filter {ForwardingAddress -ne $null} | ft Name,ForwardingAddress,DeliverToMailboxAndForward -Autosize | Export-CSV g:\Email_forwarding_output.csv Note : Please try the command at your own risk, the owner of this blog takes no responsibility for anything that may go wrong on your exchange server.

Dont get me wrong, art is subjective and as it stands writing is an art, therefore I fully respect/support your opinions and am not trying to berate. However, if you are self proclaimed ""not a writing type"" then I fail to see how you can give definitive input as to what is so bad about it.  IMO this show is very clever. Predictable in a few areas and a bit hollywood in others, but all around it isnt cookie cutter, especially the main characters. Add on top of this that it is, for the most part, technologically accurate to a 'T', I think it is a very well done show."

hacking,3ckaq3,hmblm12,2,Thu Jul 9 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"While I see your point, I dont really understand your example (except to prove my original point.  What im getting at is I find it hard for someone to be critical of writing but then not be able to pinpoint what it is theyre being critical about.   As far as your example, that doesn't really do anything to support the idea that the writing is bad. When writing is bad, its a little more in depth than just character-specific one-liners. Its about the plot, the idea, and the direction of the story, as well as how the writer goes about those things.   That character's definition, at its core, isnt inaccurate. The way he went about describing it says nothing about the writing of the show, only about the writing of that specific character, which can very well be deliberate. Things like this are done all the time in order to paint a picture of what a certain character is supposed to be like. Now youll see him as pretty vulgar, rude, and somewhat shallow. Whether the character was written as articulate or vulgar, he is still describing the same thing with the same accuracy."
hacking,3ckaq3,Happyysadface,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:08:04 2015 UTC,"This line stood out as very awkward to me as well. The simplest explanation may be that it broke up the delivery of a technical term, and its dictionary definition to soften the show for non-technical viewers. I find it hard to believe someone wrote that line thinking it was uproariously hilarious.   If I had to read into it further I'd guess that since the remark was somewhat inappropriate and with Angela's dismissal during the technical meeting with the CTO the writer may be making (or leading up to making) a statement about the difficulty women in this industry face."

hacking,3cm8vr,DeathHamster1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:26:31 2015 UTC,"The ""Most"" used in the headline is incredibly misleading (and was written by the University of London and not OP). The post is a short summary of ‘A Glance through the VPN Looking Glass: IPv6 Leakage and DNS Hijacking in Commercial VPN clients’ which I read last week. Its a solid paper that identifies some serious issues that many VPN users do not consider when purchasing these sorts of things. The paper also draws attention to just how dishonest some of the claims of these providers are - the consequences to this sort of technical failure are among the most serious possible, given users in many countries could find themself imprisoned or worse based on what a certain class of snooper finds in their web traffic.  With all that said, the paper looks at 14 VPN providers. 14 is not ""most internet anonymity software"". 14 is not even most VPN providers. Maybe 14 is most VPN providers currently doing business in the city of London? That would be a more reasonable claim. While the paper doesn't make the same claim the post did, it still makes some weird, unproven claims, like the 14 VPN providers they looked at were ""the most popular ones"" - despite the fact the paper makes no mention of a survey of the number of users in a larger pool of VPN companies or a reference to similar information published elsewhere."

I don't know how much you know about computers/Unix, but here we go.   First off, to jailbreak you'll need a specialized tool. There's heaps of tools available but you need to get the right one for your iOS version. Do not, I repeat DO NOT pay for any jailbreak tool or any advertised tool. These are mostly viruses and/or scams.   For iOS 8.1.3, 8.2, .3 and .4 you can use [TaiG](taig.com/en/). Search on /r/jailbreak for tools for other versions, and find a good tutorial.   Jailbroken devices rely on the ""jailbreak equivalent of the App Store"", Cydia. Cydia is built on a Debian/APT system.   First thing after jailbreaking, open Cydia and find ""iOS Terminal"" and/or OpenSSH. One of the default repos is hugely focused on commandline tools. There are heaps available, just search for what you need. If you can't find anything, there might be a version in a different repository, try Google.   Ssh access works pretty much as normal. The default password for root and mobile is ""alpine"". Make sure you change this with passwd.   Now you should be good to go! If you have any questions feel free to ask 😄"

We would need to know more (type of database, are you positive it's encrypted and not just overwritten, or random pieces of data?, what type of operating system is he using?, is this a physical box or a VPS?, etc). If it truly is encrypted and the attacker used a decent password (probably likely) there most likely isn't much to be done, especially if it's a virtual machine on a server. Restoring from a backup is pretty damn painless and is probably the best solution. Why wouldn't that be cost effective? It should be dirt cheap to restore from a backup.

Are you certain that your provider isn't proxying all web traffic through a logging system with MITM SSL termination? Do you check certificates on everything you access to make sure it's the real cert?   Lastly, proxying your browser is one thing, but what about all your other services and clients on your computer?

I personally only use an SSH tunnel if I can't use the VPN to my servers as a method of at least obscuring what I am doing on a public wifi hotspot, this only covers up what I am doing with things in my web browser and only while it is been carried over the open WiFi."

Basically, encryption is reversible whereas cryptographic hashing is a one-way function, meaning that it's extremely computationally difficult to recover the original plaintext password given just its hash. Salting the password, which means adding a pseudorandom value to the plaintext password before it is hashed, makes this even more secure because an attacker would have to spend a great deal of time trying to recover each password one by one.

hacking,3by7g2,TheBird47,8,Fri Jul 3 03:52:14 2015 UTC,Off the top of my head the simplest way to do it with two radios is with directional antennas.   Example: you and a buddy set out with directional antennas and compasses to try to triangulate a rogue signal in your neighborhood. You drive / walk a known distance away from each other and then each find the direction in which the signal is the strongest and record this with a compass. You now have one known side and two known angles of a triangle which is enough information to describe the entire shape and find the source of the broadcast.

You wouldn't need to verify the integrity of the VPN, as long as it follows SSL protocol and returns a certificate so you know you weren't re-routed, you can then connect to Tor from the VPN. But once again, who's to say the tor node isn't malicious.   If you need to be completely anonymous, the only real course of action is to launder money to buy a disposable computer, run a Linux distro that's built around anonymity, walk (don't drive) to a crowded place with wifi access wearing a hat, sunglasses, and covering clothing (or even better, connect to the network with a long range antenna from an area with no cameras/people), spoof a MAC address on the network, connect to a VPN paid for in Bitcoin, connect to Tor, do your business, destroy the laptop and evidence.

If someone wants to kidnap you, and they know where you are enough to gain access to your fucking fitbit, they don't need the data and wouldn't bother trying. It's too costly.  Therefore the risk is nearly non-existent to virtually all end-users. Why does it warrant more than a ""nice-to-have"" on the product roadmaps?

Nature of a threat is far more important than threat occurrence.

A wrist device that would provide attackers with your fitness routine is neither a threat or a reasonable use of time. Despite the archetype ""I did it because I could"" isn't a powerful motivation for attackers.  The problem here is this will weaken consumer trust and create unnecessary concern.

All it's going to take is a number of of high profile senators to die in a set of mysteriously correlated self driving car accidents traced back to international espionage, international hacking, and then whamo, legislation piggybacks on must-pass bills to require a level of security on self driving cars that makes it so expensive, that the common man can't afford it.  Delaying the eventual saturation of a driverless car society by a decade or two.  We might as well spearhead this problem, by making everyone a hacker, because world war 3 is going to be fought by ecosystems and cornucopias of internetworked autonomous agents.  And the last thing you want is that sort of thing switching sides (being reprogrammed at last minute) to attack the people who originally built it.  I just thought of a Sci Fi Thriller movie plot line:  Country builds vast autonomous war machine, and then programmers fight over who has root.  And eventually the AI gets fed up with the constant struggle for who owns it, and decides to kill anyone who wants to harm anyone.  Ushering in a global dystopia for 1000 years where nobody harms anyone else, and everybody wears painted on smiles and pretends to be happy while they try to destroy the thing that enforces harmony, without having an evil thought or committing an act of aggression or violence."

Everywhere I look, it is either super-advanced or not real, and the howtohack subreddit is no use.  If you are willing to help a novice, thank you. If not, sorry for wasting your time."
hacking,3bbzcj,1337m4x0r,9,Sun Jun 28 00:37:43 2015 UTC,"Obviosly you need to have at least some experience in a high level programming language you can use for webprogramming. Lots of languages can be used for that through cgi. Here it's Python3 through uwsgi. The best way to learn it is practice. Go step by step, try one thing after another (file manipulation, socket connection, etc). Just google and try it out.  It's hard to describe how to learn to create something like 'this'.. I can roughly describe how it works though, so that you get an idea what to look into: Everytime somone opens the page the python script runs and creates the html code (keyword: cgi). On the server there's a data folder with a subfolder for every indexed address, everyone of those contains two files: the html data of the address and an info file (keyword: filemanipulation). When a search requst is coming in: the scripts makes a list of all the address-folders (code: listOfEntries = os.listdir(datadir)) and goes through them with a for-loop. For every folder it loads the html data and info files and looks for the searchstring in those. If the searchstring is found it adds the html list entry for this address to the html code. When the for-loop is done the footer is added and the html gets passed to the client (in the script that's just ""return html.encode('utf-8')"").  The address folder is populated by another python script that runs in the background. ipv4 addresses are just a 32bit number. The script uses a for-loop to iterate over blocks of 10000 addresses. Every address has to undergo several steps, as soon as one of them fails (flag indexThisIp=False) this address is dropped. For each address the script tries to connect to the address on port 80 (code: ""self.result = self.sock.connect_ex((self.ip,self.port))""). If that was successful it gets the whois information (code: ""whois = ipwhois.IPWhois(self.ip).lookup_rws()""). It checks whether the address is from a blacklisted hoster (like amazon), if so it sets  indexThisIp=False. If it's not on the blacklist and indexThisIp is still true it gets the dns (code: ""dns = socket.gethostbyaddr(self.ip)[0]""). If after all this indexThisIp is still True this address is ready to get indexed, so it downloads the html data into the coresponding address-subfolder using wget, additionally checks the data for keywords (listed as ""Tags"" on the webpage). It also writes the whois,dns,dateOfScan,pageTitle information in the info-file.  Which address blocks the second script should scan is determined by the first script. The first script records for each client from what address block the request came from and increments a number in a file named the address of this block. The second script looks up which file has the biggest number (therefore many clients from within that block) and uses its for-loop to iterate over that block (except when this block has been scanned just recently, that's just handled by similar files, just with the timestamp of the last scan in them)  I hope this gets you a rough idea about how it works and what things to look into. As proposed further down I'll make this open source, I'll notify you when the code is on github :)"

The users could test by hand but that's just annoying, so I think throwing out password protected entries would enhance the quality of the index more than it would diminish it. (My goal for this is that the user clicks on an index entry and gets something fun to play with, not that the service has each and every device in it's index) Every 24h the whole index gets checked, offline addresses (or with now uninteresting data on them) get thrown out. New devices in the address block can be discovered as early as 36h after the last scan of this block and under the condition that some user from this block visited the service my service checks only for port 80 (since it's popular, http and no ssl)"

(it may not look like a usb, it'll use an internal connector, 4 wires, white plastic plug).  I wonder if the bios is actually physically disabling the wifi card itself, or if it's just ignoring the cards usb id?  It might be interesting to try another internal wifi card, and see if that works.  If the bios is just ignoring the cards usb ID, you should be able to fool it.

hacking,3b8azh,aydiosmio,4,Sat Jun 27 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"Quantum key distribution:       Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses quantum mechanics to guarantee secure communication. It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is often incorrectly called quantum cryptography, as it is the most well known example of the group of quantum cryptographic tasks.  An important and unique property of quantum distribution is the ability of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system. A third party trying to eavesdrop on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using quantum superpositions or quantum entanglement and transmitting information in quantum states, a communication system can be implemented which detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to be secure (i.e. the eavesdropper has no information about it), otherwise no secure key is possible and communication is aborted.  The security of encryption that uses quantum key distribution relies on the foundations of quantum mechanics, in contrast to traditional public key cryptography which relies on the computational difficulty of certain mathematical functions, and cannot provide any indication of eavesdropping at any point in the communication process.

I was on my college's network so they obviously just sent the letter to my college's IT department and they cross referenced it to my Ethernet jack my computer was plugged into to find out what building and room I was in. I woke up one morning to two sickly looking IT department student-interns handing me the letter including the files/torrent and data usage. I don't think they knew how to handle the situation or what they were doing at all. They questioned me a bit and told me the ""upload"" is what flagged it. Not sure if I really believed that. They told me I could keep ""downloading"" but the ""uploading"" needs to stop and to just shut that off because that is what makes it ""file sharing"". I just closed the door and ripped the letter up.   I suspected it was the amount of data I downloaded/uploaded because I usually reach a ratio and then stop but I downloaded a bunch of stuff one weekend and left it on for a few days while I was out of town and I must have uploaded like 40-50 gigs worth to the torrents. Who knows. But I do know that it was a specific torrent that was listed. It was only one album so they can just target by honeypot and not data usage. Either way. I never stopped my file habits. I am just more careful about where I get my torrents from. I keep to low-key, PRIVATE or invite-only boards and torrent sharing for the majority of my stuff. Not a peep since."

hacking,3b2lwk,HorseRaper,4,Thu Jun 25 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"Well he posted a single picture of his face(shoulder up).  Back then a lot of the image hosting servers didn't strip exif data from uploaded images which usually contained fstop info and some other variables used to take the photo and often would include things like camera information, camera or cellphone model and date of which the photo was taken.  Some even included gps data if gps location features was enabled so that could narrow down an exact location of where the photo was taken, so they could instantly know where you live if you've uploaded a picture of yourself that was taken from home.  Now the contents of the photo can also be used for reverse image searching.  It could have been tracked back to his facebook profile, or any other social networking user profile which he previously used that picture from.  So now they can collect a name, and all of your information you voluntarily posted to any webpage or profile page.  They can then search for your name through simple websites like pipl.com for more info or even do background checks on you.  Tor literally doesn't do anything to protect against you leaking your own information on it's own.  It simply routes you through different tor nodes and makes you appear to be coming from a different IP address as well as encrypting your traffic until it reaches the tor exit node.  In this case, it didn't matter if he was using tor or not.  It didn't matter if his IP was hidden or his traffic was encrypted, other means of basic forensics could be used to find him out since he posted sensitive information."

Each node is randomly assigned a value of 1-200 (weighted for more lower node values) and they would pass their output to upper nodes, which would use the most common words as their input. This would progressively continue, until the 200th level would turn the words into a color and pick out a color based on a chart.   The nodes output at each level would be iteratively judged as to how close it was to mona lisa or some other random art each day. Then they would be reassigned output based on which keys were pressed until one day, they would start to approximate the art in question.

So, as long as the original tickets can't be reverted to a previous state, I think it should be good enough.

Some people have released Android apps to automatically recharge, clone or otherwise modify those cards. This apps became obsolete for one reason or the other, but it has been done.  You must keep in mind, these cards usually work both online and offline. Charging money and buying a ticket is done offline so it can be instantaneous, but eventually that information gets synchronized to a database. I don't think it would matter if you can buy the card anonymously, but I wouldn't play to much with it if you have to register with your name to obtain it (the system will see that you keep discharging the card but never charging it officially).   That being said, I think the only way of getting any money out of that vulnerability is reporting it 'anonymously' to some TV show who's opposed to the government.

Make it very clear you dont want money or other compensation for the disclosure. However, after they fix the issue you would like to make a blog post about it after they review the post.   Make it a point that you are into info security. Explain in great detail how you arrived at exploiting the system.   Explain in a way that you didn't actually steal anything you just created a proof of concept.   Most importantly give short term and long term solutions to the problem.   Last item dont notify some low level person.  Make sure you notify the top CEO's better if you notify more than one top cheif. If local government make sure you notify the city council.

HTTPS supports a number of different protocols these include SSL version 2 and 3 as well as. TLS version 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.  Many of these are considered cryptographically insecure and as a result the web server (Google) will not accept them, but they are configuredwithin the web server for backwards compatibility, but not accepted.  With the discovery of the POODLE vulnerability, web servers are much more stringent in the protocols which they will accept, as there is the possibility of a downgrade vulnerability.  For some reason you web browser is attempting to connect using a non cryptographically secure protocol.  Check that TLS 1.1 and above is supported and this issue should not reoccur.  No one is trying to hack you or read your packets. In fact this is in place so you can't read server memory and attempt to steal the servers private key."

Here's the lowdown: The only current, generally accepted way that SSL/TLS traffic is intercepted and decrypted is using a man in the middle """"attack"""" that you would have to agree to and it is REALLY easy to check for. Typically this is in the form of a corporate security solution whereby: A) Your outbound connections are signed using a corporate cert that is decrypted for sniffing/applying security policies by a company proxy server B) the secure traffic is then re encrypted and sent to the web server with the proxy server pretending to be the requesting browser C) the traffic is returned by the remote server to the proxy server where it decrypts the info, sniffs again and re encrypts before sending to you: Your browser is happy because it receives only encrypted connections and the remote server is happy because it sent the transaction over a secure tunnel(to your company's server). Now, unfortunately, some consumer Antivirus solutions are providing this ""service"" for you in a similar fashion and your ISP can technically do the same, IF YOU ALLOW THEM TO INSTALL A CERT IN YOUR TRUSTED ROOT STORE.   NEVER ALLOW ANYTHING TO INSTALL CERTS TO YOUR TRUSTED STORE MANUALLY.

Start fresh from there and see what happens. If it happens again, I would recommend switching out your SIM and getting a new phone number. Whatever it is, its either a malicious app in your phone, or a breach of your apple id, both of which should be corrected by doing what I mentioned.  If you are going to back up your data prior to resetting it, don't use iTunes to perform a full backup, as this could grab whatever app is potentially causing a breach. Use iFunbox or similar to selectively copy data over to your computer.  As /u/Reynolix mentioned, if your phone is indeed jailbroken, it could be easier to accidentally download something malicious.

hacking,3aju8d,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:44:21 2015 UTC,"Triangulation:       In trigonometry and geometry, triangulation is the process of determining the location of a point by measuring angles to it from known points at either end of a fixed baseline, rather than measuring distances to the point directly (trilateration). The point can then be fixed as the third point of a triangle with one known side and two known angles.  Triangulation can also refer to the accurate surveying of systems of very large triangles, called triangulation networks. This followed from the work of Willebrord Snell in 1615–17, who showed how a point could be located from the angles subtended from three known points, but measured at the new unknown point rather than the previously fixed points, a problem called resectioning. Surveying error is minimized if a mesh of triangles at the largest appropriate scale is established first. Points inside the triangles can all then be accurately located with reference to it. Such triangulation methods were used for accurate large-scale land surveying until the rise of global navigation satellite systems in the 1980s.

hacking,3afev5,eatsa_pizza,5,Fri Jun 19 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that stored XSS is slightly more dangerous than reflected xss solely for the reason that a user who wouldn't click on a risky link can still be targeted when visiting a though-to-be-trustworthy site.  Just my two cents, but regardless xss is still a vector for exploitation.  I actually rediscovered an XSS vuln in the independent.co.uk site and getting a response from them was like pulling teeth. In fact it still hasn't happened but they are patching it IIRC.  In another case, my university has constant emails warning students about phishing attacks, yet has and extremely easy to find redirect vuln in the post-auth part of the student portal.  Which I reported....  Which they still think is trivial to fix...  Hell, I even got the CSO to click my malformed link and he didn't seem to see the problem when it redirected to my custom page.

Privatization is a bit scary, but just like, I think it was shoes, were provided to the citizens of the Soviet Union, and they probably couldn't think of a situation where they could produce their own shoes without the government giving providing them, yet we know that we don't need government to provide that to us.   I think it's just a matter of it hasn't been done before and so people are nervous about it, just like when democracy was first instituted in the modern world people and King George's time probably thought ""how can we let all the people decide how they're going to be ruled?

hacking,3a4wwk,thecustodian,5,Wed Jun 17 12:43:53 2015 UTC,"I have a CS background even though my programming is very rusty by now.   This has nothing to do with programming, but testing. In fact, the best programmers are never good testers, as they would never be able to impartially look at an app, from an external user's viewpoint.   Anyone have some input or experience doing this?   The way they used to do it in my last company is called Monkey Testing. Once you pass the usual test case scenarios (such as the labels and widgets are positioned correctly, you get desired output for given input, etc.), that's when the Monkey Testers take over.  What Monkey Testers do is try and break the application - the way hackers do. If you go by the usual workflow for an app, you will never find any hard-to-find bugs. For example, the test case says that you have to tap/click a certain button on the app to save your data. But what you do is create different scenarios: What if you click the back button instead of that save button? What if an incoming phone-call arrives while you are entering the data? What if you change from portrait to landscape mode whilst entering the data (in many poorly designed apps, the scrolling either gets stuck or the widgets get scrambled all over). If you try all the permutations across many apps and devices, I'm sure you will find many bugs!"

hacking,39y5z8,Anslab,17,Tue Jun 16 10:41:20 2015 UTC,How is that an improvement? You've gone from a cloud platform specifically designed with secure storage of passwords in mind to a general file syncing platform.
hacking,39y5z8,CodedChaos,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:51:24 2015 UTC,"Because the syncing is only part of the puzzle. Hackers would have to completely break open Dropbox's entire system, then after cracking the passwords to every account, access all those accounts to see if they store KeePass DBs in them (which would instantly look suspicious as fuck when thousands of accounts start being accessed from a few IPs), then download all the KeePass files from all those accounts, then start on actually bruteforcing the DBs. The fact that it's such a multi-step process is what (to me) makes it far less likely that your stored passwords will be compromised than if LastPass was compromised. LastPass is a much juicier target too.  And the other thing that makes KeePass safer is the option to use key files in addition to a password. So for example, my DB is synced with dropbox, and it needs my password and my key file (which never entered dropbox - I transferred it to my devices offline) to unlock. So even if my DB was stolen, I still know my passwords are safe because they'd still need the keyfile to open it."

It's a multi-step process that involves interaction on both the client and router side.  Session-specific information is exchanged (nonces, etc.), and this session-specific information wouldn't be valid were you to simply replay a handshake.   As a very basic, naively implemented example, suppose we agreed on a password/PSK, and an authentication protocol where I give you a random word, and you respond with the MD5 of the word concatenated with the password.    So the password is ""strudel"" and you come knock on my door and want to come in.  I give you a challenge word of ""Apple"" and you give me back MD5(applestrudel) and, if the MD5 you gave me is, indeed, that of applestrudel, I let you in.  A little while later, along comes Eve, who watched that exchange, and knocks on the door and wants to come in, but now the challenge word is ""Cherry"".  She doesn't know the password, so she can't MD5(cherrystrudel), and the value you gave me, which Eve spied on, is no longer valid, so she can't just replay your response, because I'm no longer looking for MD5(applestrudel).  Note that, as described, this WOULD be vulnerable to a MITM attack - it's certainly not a secure protocol - just a basic example of how a replay is prevented.  If you want some terms to Google, try ""challenge response authentication""."

Someone sent me a FB message about this thread on Reddit so I decided to post here asking for help.  I got an alert early this morning and contacted my host (Dreamhost) about this incident - they said they are looking into it and after a few hours sent me a long and rambling email with a bunch of files/directories saying that they are 'infected' - none in the said ThirtyIR domain though (I have several other sites etc.).  I went through each line of that email and deleted all the infected files but the site still seems to be 'hacked' - the defacement is still there.  Needless to say, I am extremely frustrated and don't know how to fix this.  Is there a programmer and/or WordPress expert here who can help? Is this an easy fix or has the entire site been compromised in terms of being able to recover it to its earlier state (as of yesterday)?  Surprisingly, I can still login to the backend - something I did this morning and changed the admin password etc. However, that seems to have done nothing.  Would really appreciate some help with this.  In the meantime, please check out my YouTube channel to find out more about ThirtyIR - gaming in 5K w/ quad Titan X w/ 5960X OC'd!

Deleting files off of a separate domain most likely won't help, it shouldn't be too difficult to spot. After a quick check in a vm it looks like the page plays/downloads a youtube file, it also makes some facebook, twitter requests and there's more obfuscated js going on.

The wild west will be roped off into ""tourist safe"" areas with security guards and the ""fairness police"".  And if you want to perform an illegal process, or do something the authorities have not approved, then they can see it all from the central location and do a truck roll to check it out.  There is a plan to stamp out fraud and cybercrime, it's to eliminate the ""anything is possible"" component from the masses access to computers.  The war on general purpose computing will finally be at an end, where anything is possible is replaced to: ""Anything is possible if you are rich to afford people to go over all the barriers put in place"".  And we will wake up in a world where the computers use us, rather than where we use the computers.    We need to educate young people in creating new operating systems from the bare metal on up.  One as an alternative to the big three operating systems that will eventually all be centralized and monitored.  The big three Operating systems are slowly being replaced with: ""human client access, monitoring, regulation and service systems"".  One where everything is magic, and no you can't change how it works, and at every turn you can complain about unfairness and get a representative to smack the other person.  But a system you will not have any control over.  Like a pet in a beautiful garden with beautiful waterfalls and almost everything you could want, but with tall electric fences around the edge.  Just don't go over those fenced areas without prior approval, and your every whim will be catered to.    Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt over cybercrime is a ruse to establish a single point of control over all computing that takes place on the planet.  The founding fathers said not to do this with the central banks, and look how they screw everyone over, they are getting ready to hyperinflate the doller out of existance to get rid of their own debt, don't let the same mistake be made with the internet.  Instead of people just depriving you of the figures in your bank account, they will be depriving you of the access to entire areas of possibility.  Free market will prevail, if you don't want to be hacked, buy a different product that is more resistant to hacking.  The solution we are being lead into is the ""pet control"" system for the mass of men.  A middleman between you and your computer that ""keeps you safe"".  I have news, that middleman who wants to keep you safe from (the boogeyman) does not have your best interests in mind.  He just wants ""taking access"" to your assets.  Not your money, your soul, who you are.  And through that, all of your money, without you noticing.  Like the founding fathers prophesied, if angles control this process, pocket utopias might be created from them, if natural and evil men as they are control it, dystopias will be created, we have to expect evil men to control it, and put in systems that cause greedy and evil men to crave to do the right thing for all.  Pet playpens are coming, and they will be very safe from the attackers."

Illegal stealing of money has been shown to provide astonishingly high return on investments that are astronomic over legal endeavors such as ""working at a grocery store"" or ""Trying to make an honest living"".    More news at 11.  Where we will provide ongoing coverage on why the pope is still catholic and water feels wet.  Cybercrime is not some new and strange phenomenon.  This has happened before.  After the proliferation of easy to acquire pistols, outlaws found it easier to steal for a living and escape justice.  Articles in the newspapers back then might have read: ""Outlaws get 1425% return on investment using horses to hijack a train!"".  Well Duh, the question is: ""How do we create a system that stops these horse-riding mustache-sporting outlaws from riding around and strong-arming the local shops/trains and taking the silver and gold?"".    If only there was some kind of way to invent a system to employ the locals down at the church to catch these outlaws after they pull the heist.""  Some kind of thing we could do to hunt down these outlaws and bring them to justice.  But we can't, nobody knows how to use a gun here, and even if they did, they have other things to do than go hunt down outlaws.    So these problems have happened before.  Complaining about the illicit gains of the criminal is just the problem restated.  How do you preserve freedom of thought over computers while having a centralized law enforcement system in cyberspace that isn't going to turn into skynet where we all turn into mindless cells/drones?    Answer:  Go down to the common, propose a new profession, make a name for them, give them badges and have formal training, pay for them to every day go and hunt down these savvy criminals.  It's what our immune system does.  Detect threat.  Identify Threat.  Create a program to eliminate it but not healthy cells.  Clone the program into the neighbors.  Search for threat.  Destroy threat.  Eradicate it.  Decommission the program.  Keep the program on file.  Then repeat.   This isn't rocket surgery.

Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Now they see these and just give up or remove them if they reach a certain level of nesting.    It could also work on crashing a system if a user is dumb enough to just click extract all.

Since this partnership will be covering over 60% of the global GDP (in conjunction with TTIP) many people want to know how this will be affecting them as it will cause great changes in many walks of life. To the latter question its a secret because they know everyone without a vested interest in the TPP will certainly disagree.

This is the main reason to run a virus scanner.  Funky search bars, link redirects, popup ads all can be spawned from these attacks.  Not as dangerous as a traditional virus, but they can be very annoying and difficult to find.  A good virus scanner will also prevent the unintentional  installation of RATs and other snooping software.    If users don't want to run a virus scanner on their computer, one can be added to their firewall.  By using Snort, and Squid/Squidguard with CLAMAV, a lot of stuff can be blocked at the firewall reducing the need for a scanner on each computer.  My personal preference is to run both.

Browser hijacks can and will infect your system, as it forces your system to run code, that's how a buffer overflow exploit works. A buffer is overrun, and properly crafted code will force the system to jump to a known memory location and execute code the attacker wants the system to run. User permissions can sometimes prevent malicious code from executing at a high enough privilege level to do any damage, but there are some exploits that allow privilege escalation attacks that circumvent that protection. The browser is one of the biggest attack vectors, blocking plugins and scripts prevents the vast majority of attacks.  Getting the user to run code, especially if they are running as the admin/root account is a far easier attack, but to say you can't be infected by a browser hijack is incorrect."

Any Kernel-level exploit can escape it, and there's no lack of user-mode vulnerabilities that can escape it. Here's a presentation on the subject from two men that I have a lot of respect for, one being my boss and the other being a colleague.   I mean, if your security model honestly relies on hoping one sandbox can play nicely inside of another sandbox without their hooking engines literally murdering eachother and one or the other or both getting thoroughly fucked or disabled, you're better off just using Chrome with EMET."

As Senator Tim Scott mentions in the interview above, the IRS receives $1 billion each year for IT work.    They spend MILLIONS of dollars for nothing. They had multiple warnings to improve security. They get a BILLION dollars each for IT work.   So, would it be possible for them to overhaul the entire system in a timely way? Probably not. Could they have done SOMETHING in the meantime? Most definitely. Did they spend millions of dollars on things which were completely unnecessary? Yes. Do they use taxpayer money for all this? Yes."

When it's no longer accesses it's relocked. Full disk encryption should be the first layer of defense, as its weaker. In most implementations if the machine is on, the HDD is readable and unlocked. Obviously if you do it wrong, you'll strip the full disk and have access to the file by file keys. Store them in something like a TPM or HSM (smart token/card), or at worst a removable drive.  File by file is a second layer, so even if they strip the outer layer (full disk encryption) you still have to break or find the keys for each individual file. That's like ultra-paranoid, fuck off you're not taking my IP level though. Honestly, it will probably end up the norm to have encrypted files and disks by default. There's no reason NOT to use at least some encryption - just be sure to have good backups (either of keys, data, or both) or not store anything that important, because data recovery could prove a problem if the disk takes a dump."

But my point is, you made it sound as if getting system wouldn't matter provided they're using EFS.   With system you can dump keys, and get access to EFS (although not on my machine you can't) but without system, you're going to have to perform a manual RAM dump, which is not a particularly simple or easy process for most PysAccess jobs (like red-teaming)"

If it was a true brute-force attack it would be just as easy to break as this goes through every possible combination of chars.  If it was a custom brute-force attack (where the attacker knew that you were using only characters) it would be easier as the char range is drastically reduced meaning brute-forcing is sped up.  If it was a dictionary attack it would be entirely dependent on what dictionary was in use. Many password lists don't contain ""characterless"" passwords.  However, no system developer who has any security understanding at all will allow for single char-range passwords...

The exploit sent a string of OOB (out of band) data to the target computer on TCP port 139 (NetBIOS),  causing it to lock up and display a Blue Screen of Death. This doesn't damage or change the data on the computer's hard disk, but any unsaved data would be lost.  The so-called OOB simply means that the malicious TCP packet contained an Urgent Pointer (URG). The Urgent Pointer is a rarely used field in the TCP header, used to indicate that some of the data in the TCP stream should be processed quickly by the recipient. Affected operating systems didn't handle the Urgent Pointer field correctly.  A person under the screen-name ""_eci"" published his C source code for the exploit on June 7, 1997.  With the source code being widely used and distributed, Microsoft was forced to create security patches, which were released a few weeks later. For a time, numerous flavors of this exploit appeared going by such names as fedup, gimp, killme, killwin, knewkem, liquidnuke, mnuke, netnuke, muerte, nuke, nukeattack, nuker102, pnewq, project1, pstlince, simportnuke, sprite, sprite32, vconnect, vzmnuker, wingenocide, winnukeit, winnuker02, winnukev95, wnuke3269, wnuke4, and wnuke95.
