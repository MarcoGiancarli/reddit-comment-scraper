After spending several years in the beer industry I have come to one conclusion. IPA drinkers are ruining craft and here's why. So when you go out to eat at a restaurant, you might order the house merlot right? No specific brand, just the house merlot. It could be the 2 buck chuck from trader joes for all you know. Packed full of bugs, twigs, and whatever else got mixed in with that cheap wine. But when you order beer you order based off the brewery. You ask for a New Belgium or an Oskar Blues because they have a particular style you like. That's called branding. (That's what separates us awesome beer drinkers from the wine snobs) The successful breweries have mastered the art of branding. They associate their brand with good beer. So how does this correlate to IPA's? Well to put it simply, IPA drinkers have no brand loyalty. Every brewery on the face of this earth makes an IPA, why? Because there's such a demand for it. IPA's have amassed a cult following unlike any other style. Everyone makes an IPA and it doesn't even have to be good, as long as it says IPA and its hoppy. It's the 2 buck chuck of beer, and soon enough restaurants will have house IPA's. Now don't get me wrong, I love a good palate wrecker by the pool but I keep my palate wide open and enjoy the saltiest of gose's, the earthiest of saisons, and the richest of stouts, but I don't seclude myself to one style like so many IPA drinkers do. I've noticed over the years that my customers, friends, and family members who take a liking to IPA's tend to get stuck in this style. They refuse to try anything else and so now the market is saturated with IPA's. Breweries slap IPA on just about anything so that it'll sell. As a result we now have lost branding and diversification in the craft beer market. As a whole the millennial generation isn't even drinking as much beer as previous generations, and the few who are are loyal to a particular style and not a brand. When brand recognition is lost, craft beer will be on the same plane as wine. gasp ...breweries that, well...let's face it, shouldn't be in business stay in business because of the primitive palates of IPA drinkers who will buy anything they slap the IPA logo on and throw a ton of hops in. Hops are great but they aren't all that beer is about. Craft beer is about trying new things, new styles, and new breweries. If you find yourself stuck with one style, branch out. Try something new. I promise you there is much more wonderful beer out there beyond your bitter and hoppy IPA's and I challenge you to find it. I really hope as a community of beer drinkers we can change Americas palate so that breweries who deserve recognition and branding get it, and the IPA bandwagon breweries either diversify or fail. Cheers guys and gals!"

He lived in Portland and loved craft beer (only drank thick, roasty, malty, viscous stouts) One day he went to this hipster bar where there wasn't even one beer that wasn't an IPA. At first, he just went with the flow and ordered the oldest IPA. But, even in its faded state, his discerning beer genius taste buds couldn't handle it.   He stood up on his bar stool and gave the mustachioed hipsters in the bar a lesson on how IPA's are actually terrible and they are only popular because the brewers had to cover up mistakes.   Then he told them about how no one actually likes hops they just like to look cool and IPA's are just a trend. He told them about the rise of sours. After that, all we know is that the hipsters stopped waxing their moustaches, took off their ironic glasses, and closed in around him.   When they finally left his corpse for the buzzards, this was all that was left of him. Hops killed my brother and they'll kill you too if you dare to speak out against them."

I have a doctorate in IPAs from Yale, and masters degrees in sours and barrel-aged stouts from Oxford and Princeton, respectively. Over the years I have drank an average of one gallon of Stone's beer every day, but recently those gallons have gone straight down the drain. The only beer of theirs in recent memory that has been any good was Enjoy By 4.20 and that's only because I was so blazed off of smoking marijuana and hops. Stone needs to do what's best for their business and cut back to a ten barrel production line to ensure consistent quality. It's the only way they can remain profitable, and I know everything about beer."

beercirclejerk,3c56sd,Pablopubes,3,Sat Jul 4 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"Just want to add, for the record, that I have a cousin and an uncle who are brewers and certified tasters for IPAs.  I'm not the only one thinking this, and they both seem to have pretty good training when it comes to beer tasting and all that.  In talking with them, they suspect that Stone simply outgrew itself and it's farmers.  That besides Escondido, they have Virginia and Germany as well.  In doing that, they have (to the best of our knowledge) tripped the amount of beer they can produce.  This means, triple the malt, barely, hops, etc etc etc.  Well, if you buy THIS hop from Farm A and THAT hop from Farm B and you have for 20 yrs, you know exactly what you are getting.  Well, not you are growing and growing and Farms A and B are really struggling to keep up... So now farm C, D, and E get involved, but no worries, they are high quality producers as well.  Well, now triple everything!  That means we need to go all the way to Farmer O for those hops.  And we're competing with a TON of others all of a sudden, for the best and top quality hops.  Long story short, the 2.0 beers and ""new process"" are (in my opinion and thru deduction and guesses only) nothing more than a process to try to mix GOOD Stone quality product with the shit that AmBev uses when it comes to quality and try to match flavor profiles.  They just couldn't do it.  So, instead of slowing down, scaling back, finding a solution, they 2.0 the beers.  The fans will love it... no one will care or know the difference.    I did notice.  I do care.  It IS different.  So, I will take my business elsewhere.  I will not drink Stone any longer.  I will mourn the passing, as it really was my first craft beer.  The little San Marcos location for those who know it.  Greg was actually working the tasting room that day.  Gone are those days and now I look at Greg and his double speak and Stone and how they grow... A micro version of AmBev.  Instead of buying others, they come into the market with their reputation and blow everyone else out.  They dominate shelving space and bully retailers.  They might have even jumped into politics here and there (Looking at you WI).  So, that's my rant.  That's my story.  That's why I am done with Stone.  FanBoys, down vote all you want!  SD Beer drinkers... please find your other craft breweries and support them.  Let Stone know that it can have the tourists, but it can no longer have San Diego!"

beercirclejerk,3bixs9,TakesJonToKnowJuan,6,Mon Jun 29 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"I've started noticing (at least around San Jose) a sour rebellion.  As new craft beer drinkers are getting into the scene they are starting to figure out they don't like highly tart beers. But most of the seasoned craft beer vets have embraced the wild. So it's not uncommon these days to see 6 of 8 taps devoted to wilds and gose. I think this is providing a barrier to craft beer adoption. These newbies want to get with the crowd and drink local craft beer, but they don't know a pilsner from a pale ale and end up with a earthy brett beer they hate. Next time they are at the bar they go back to bud light. But a few of these new craft beer explorers keep trying beers and learning about them and have discovered wilds = funk = bad, hence the rebellion. I hear more and more people complain that bars/breweries have too many wilds on tap, which I also think is usually true. I've also heard people condemn entire breweries as funk factories because they tasted a couple beers and didn't like them. So people are starting to blame anything they don't like on brett, lacto,  brux or the merlot barrels.  The solution isn't an easy one...  it's education. People need to learn what styles they like and seek them out. Beer festivals would be a great place to start this education, but they are dropping the ball. I blame both sides here. The new craft beer drinkers often get caught up in the all you can drink aspect and end up trying a few beers until they find one or two they like (often a beer they already know they like) and then proceed to drink a gallon of that and stagger home with no new knowledge about beer. It's true that some of these new craft drinkers don't really want to learn about beer and just want to get hammered, but I think most have some interest in learning about beer. This is where the festival organizers are dropping the ball. They are catering to the seasoned craft beer drinkers, offering rare exclusives and odd styles, which I love, but it alienates the new people.  I'd love to see more general signage at festivals explaining styles, ABV, IBUs, barrel names, etc...  And more descriptions of the individual beers. Some breweries don't send anything to these festivals other than a few kegs. No sell sheets or anything with descriptions.  When I am pouring a festival I always take it upon myself to read up on the beers I am pouring so I can answer questions about them. But I think I am in the minority here. Often the people pouring know NOTHING about beer. They can't even tell you what style the beers they are pouring.  I'll toss some blame at breweries too. I find it maddening when I look at a beer in the store and there is no mention anywhere of ABV, IBUs, STYLE...  Just a bunch of words that tell you NOTHING about what the beer tastes like. Sure I can whip out my phone and go to beeradvocate or ratebeer and figure it out, but with so many options I usually just move on.  I'd also like to see more educated bar staff. This is where many new craft drinkers get their first taste of good beer. It's not easy or quick to talk to a patron and figure out what beers/flavors they like and suggest a craft beer that might fit their pallet. I will say this is changing. I am seeing bars get all of their servers ""cicerone beer server"" certifications. But it's still not uncommon for a server to know nothing about the beers they are serving.  As for the wild rebellion, I think it's a good thing all around. There are so many other great styles out there that are being ignored. Not everything needs to be super tart or wine barrel aged. And I think we are heading in the right direction, I just want to see craft beer continue to grow and not stall out because of ignorance and confusion."

Arrived to Founders on BoltCutter Release Day #1, November 11th, 2012. We made our presence known as the first in line at this ticketed event. We were greeted by a kind-spirited employee, who'se heart bears the striking resemblence of St.Nicholas on the magical eve of Christmas, suggesting we join our fellow beer brethren in the masses of the parking lot....We were obviously early. When the Clock stuck noon we were ushered in to the sound of the chicken song. As beer geeks frantically rushed to the store, our excitement reached epic proportions...would our trials and tribulations be worth the anticipation? Skip ahead to minutes later, after purchasing our bottles and appropriate bolt-cutter glasswear, we trekked across the street to experience our gift from the brewers, perhaps aj offering from the benevolent gods above. We poured the liquid gold into our glasswear. Gather round pals, for the tale of Boltcutter....  A: Pours a Bright copper red-orange, reminiscent of the rare Bengal Tiger pelt. A fluffy egg-shell white head rising from the depth of this untamed beast. Gives way to an elegant spider-web lacing (most likely resemembling the fierce Sydney Funnel-web spider (atrax robustus)  S: A bouquet of fresh Hawaiin Pineapple, Dark amber maple syrup from the majestic maples of Vermont. A slight tone of biscuit, just as grandma would prepare on our bi-weekly sunday brunch. The aroma truly fills the nares with gifts of joy and happiness.  T: Heavy Tropical Overtones with a mellow presence, giving one the feeling of an awe-inspiring autumnal sunset. The aforementioned pineapple dominates like a stallion with it's mare. As one sips the brew, the warmth of red dying coals of a huntsman midnight fire. A Floral Hop bitterness, as bitter as the loss of the beloved family ferret (RIP Gerdy).   M: Thick like a swollen Baboon rump. Creamy like fresh-churned butter as would be applied to grandma's bi-weekly biscuits. A light carbonation teases the tongue.  O: As this review comes to a close, the experience shall not be forgotten. The legend of the BoltCutter shall be passed down from generation to generation just as the stories of our time that define a people....I miss Grandma"

beercirclejerk,382ryr,singsadsong,13,Mon Jun 1 13:07:59 2015 UTC,"Now, I understand you're probably thinking ""why should I care what some random guy on reddit thinks about IPA's"" but hear me out on this one. After spending several years in the beer industry I have come to one conclusion. IPA drinkers are ruining craft and here's why. So when you go out to eat at a restaurant, you might order the house merlot right? No specific brand, just the house merlot. It could be the 2 buck chuck from trader joes for all you know. Packed full of bugs, twigs, and whatever else got mixed in with that cheap wine. But when you order beer you order based off the brewery. You ask for a New Belgium or an Oskar Blues because they have a particular style you like. That's called branding. (That's what separates us awesome beer drinkers from the wine snobs) The successful breweries have mastered the art of branding. They associate their brand with good beer. So how does this correlate to IPA's? Well to put it simply, IPA drinkers have no brand loyalty. Every brewery on the face of this earth makes an IPA, why? Because there's such a demand for it. IPA's have amassed a cult following unlike any other style. Everyone makes an IPA and it doesn't even have to be good, as long as it says IPA and its hoppy. It's the 2 buck chuck of beer, and soon enough restaurants will have house IPA's. Now don't get me wrong, I love a good palate wrecker by the pool but I keep my palate wide open and enjoy the saltiest of gose's, the earthiest of saisons, and the richest of stouts, but I don't seclude myself to one style like so many IPA drinkers do. I've noticed over the years that my customers, friends, and family members who take a liking to IPA's tend to get stuck in this style. They refuse to try anything else and so now the market is saturated with IPA's. Breweries slap IPA on just about anything so that it'll sell. As a result we now have lost branding and diversification in the craft beer market. As a whole the millennial generation isn't even drinking as much beer as previous generations, and the few who are are loyal to a particular style and not a brand. When brand recognition is lost, craft beer will be on the same plane as wine. gasp ...breweries that, well...let's face it, shouldn't be in business stay in business because of the primitive palates of IPA drinkers who will buy anything they slap the IPA logo on and throw a ton of hops in. Hops are great but they aren't all that beer is about. Craft beer is about trying new things, new styles, and new breweries. If you find yourself stuck with one style, branch out. Try something new. I promise you there is much more wonderful beer out there beyond your bitter and hoppy IPA's and I challenge you to find it. I really hope as a community of beer drinkers we can change Americas palate so that breweries who deserve recognition and branding get it, and the IPA bandwagon breweries either diversify or fail. Cheers guys and gals!"

beercirclejerk,37m1cl,BornAgainNewsTroll,4,Thu May 28 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"Imperial IPA is a British term, and isn't really considered an IPA by most American beer scholars. In actuality, IIPAs are much closer in nature to other fruity froo froo British beers such as ESB. For a decent American attempt at the style, see Dale's Pale Ale. I think they actually do, but since the style was developed at least 20 years after the fall of Nazi Germany I'm not sure that I understand your question. East coast DOUBLE IPAs are neither. If you see a DOUBLE IPA on a shelf, that's a pretty good indicator that it's a shelf turd."

The Yuengling part was removed during prohibition and unfortunately never made its way back.  Some other interesting tidbits of Yuengling trivia:  At the first Thanksgiving, the pilgrims shared Yuengling with the native Americans. Upon tasting the crisp, consistent lager, Squanto remarked, ""Wow. This would be perfect to drink on a hot day when you are out in the yard planting corn with fish."" One pilgrim, Joseph Miller-Coors, overheard this remark, and was inspired to brew beer with corn. Another pilgrim, Samuel Calagione, was likewise inspired to brew beer with rotting fish."

Ok, I mean, that's not terrible advice, but you fill in all these unnecessary details about having a good recipe and shit, when all you needed was:   Supply can't outstrip demand   This is the heart of the matter right here!  Make sure you make enough to get everybody's pussy's all wet, then be a total cocktease and make sure that only a small fraction of the people that want your beer actually get it.  Then, watch those Beer Advocate reviews rocket your whalez to the top of the ISO:FT lists as the people that actually got it desperately try to unload this beer for something that is actually good.  Then there's this laughable piece of bullshit:   Better ingredients tend to make better beer!   I hope that by better ingredients you mean Pappy Barrels, because other than that, who really cares.  We're talking about WhalezBro, not the yinlinz where things like malt actually matter.   Make sure you be careful during the brewing process and leave plenty of time to do things right.   This should read:  Make a hugely alcoholic and sweet beer to throw into Pappy barrels; if it doesn't turn out right, then add chiles and chocolate and shit and just call it Mexican Imperial Stout.  And remember, don't rush that Pappy aging process   corks and cages optional.   Jesus, dude, how are people gonna take that shit seriously if there's not cork and cage?  Also, you forgot to mention that each bottle needs to be hand-numbered, so fellow neckbeards can know exactly how rare your bottle is (and, consequently, how big your dick is) when you bring this über whalez to a bottle share  As to step 5....not bad.  Though you should add that everything will be better if you start a club for your rare beers and only sell it to club members (a group of people that will pay whatever outrageous price you ask them, because whalez).  Also, to increase demand, host a special event for the release, but sell more tickets than your supply can support a la Cigar City.  Those riot videos on YouTube will ensure that everyone knows that you make the most sought after whalez in the industry, even if it's nothing but a saccharine, unbalanced, overpriced, and unpleasant BBA adjunct stout!"

beercirclejerk,34vl3d,singsadsong,12,Tue May 5 02:46:00 2015 UTC,"just some tips I've learned from my years of courting liquor store clerks:   That gross folding chair that somehow manages to support your chunky bourbon barrel butt isn't just for waiting in line for releases. Bring it to the store so that you can sit down and talk to the clerk for prolonged periods of time. When you buy your six pack, pay with a fifty-dollar bill and tell the employee to keep the change. Small gestures like this let them know that you are a good customer. Come into the store on the days of rare releases and buy all of the beer except for the rare one. This will help build trust, and the next time a whale hits the shelf it will be understood that you are a good customer. Learn which car in the parking lot belongs to the beer guy, and make a habit of washing it every time you stop in to get beer. Car chalk can be used to write ""I like hard-to-obtain sour ales and barrel aged stouts but also I understand the importance of buying a brewery's flagship beers"" on the windows. Take the liquor store employee out to dinner at a five star restaurant and order a simple, year-round beer. Make sure you explain to the waiter that purchasing these beers is important, as they are the lifeblood of breweries and liquor stores."

Plantation owners would give their slaves (lawn mowers) the beer as a way to hydrate and stay nourished throughout the day.  The first half  of The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is actually just hand-written beer reviews.  The Boston Tea Party didn't actually involve any tea -- it was actually a large-scale drainpour of British ales. While the hops helped preserve the beer during its journey across the Atlantic, outraged colonists deemed the hops to have dropped off.  Lewis and Clark's expedition was intended as a way to find a reliable trade-source for fresh Pliny.  During prohibition, all beers were considered whales. Newspaper classified sections were flooded with advertisements that simply stated, ""ISO""."

How many times I've seen guys clearing shelves of rare stuff just to have as many as possible leaving everyone that comes in after him with little to nothing. Every beer you buy, your taking it away from someone else, whether you drink it or put it on a table never to be seen again. It's understandable that your always going to end up with a bit of a stash either to age or save for a bottle share with friends or trade for beers you can't get in your area, but this is ridiculous.

There's a reason those places are renown for their water - it's special. You see, long long ago, before the great explorer Cristoforo Colombo discovered the long lost continent of N. America, there lived a species of worms that munched on the droppings of indigenous animals local to the native biosphere of the natural region (if I'm going too fast for you let me know). These worms went on to migrate (over time) to the headwaters of the mighty Misiisiisiispsipie River, flowed down it's mighty, frothy surge, into what is now modern day THE GOLF OF MEXICO. From there they set sail, 'round the golden coast of La Florida, back up the eastern coast of what we now call AMERICAN COAST LINE (technical term) and made their homes on the carbonated shores of el coste Calagione de Sam, otherwise known as Rehoboth Beach, DE. Over a many great millennia, these worms, and the ancestors of these worms, did their very best to leave traces of the mighty DFH 120MIN IPA for future Head Spiritual Brew Master, his holiness, Sam Calagione, to decipher over lunch and a couple Sam Adams patriot lagers.   So you see, there isn't really anything special about the 120 that you can't find in any other beer. Except the worms. So pray you, good sir, look deep inside yourself and ask ""What do I want to find at the bottom of a pack of chewing gum, my friend?"" And your answer will be right there staring back into your beautiful blue eyes. God speed to you.  EDIT: picture of his holiness, S. Calagione, HSBM"

beercirclejerk,319elv,HaydenPlanettierium,8,Fri Apr 3 11:27:45 2015 UTC,":( damn me for not screenshotting. in the context of a girl drinking somebody's headyz, the post said that girls don't understand that beer isn't just something for getting drunk, and that girls can't appreciate that somebody would wait in line 3 hours for a bottle. there are still plenty of good (bad) posts in there about the tragedy of non-sissyronis drinking fancy beer."
beercirclejerk,319elv,Dr_King_Schultz,0,Fri Apr 3 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"Exaggerating a bit? I said SOME girls don't understand, and I said I waited in line for a little more than an hour. I deleted it because I realized I was being a little too judgemental."
beercirclejerk,319elv,Dr_King_Schultz,3,Fri Apr 3 16:21:56 2015 UTC,Maybe exaggerating a little bit -- I can't 100% remember the original post but the fact that you deleted it suggests it was pretty bad ;)
beercirclejerk,319elv,Dr_King_Schultz,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"Well, you got me there. I know lots of girls that appreciate good beers. In this particular instance the girl drank beers that are very hard to get, and tried to replace them with shitty beers that you could find in any store around the country. I think most people would agree that's a pretty shitty thing to do. But, I shouldn't have suggested that it happened because she was a female. I realized my mistake, and deleted it."
beercirclejerk,319elv,Dr_King_Schultz,4,Fri Apr 3 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"No worries. I would play devil's advocate though and say that what she did really isn't that catastrophic. You had beers in your fridge and they had Star Wars cartoon pictures on the label. Sure, it'd be better to ask, but she wasn't that far in the wrong for assuming that beers in a fridge were fair game for drinking. I keep beer in my fridge like any other grocery, and when friends are over they know they're welcome to have a beer without having to get clearance first. Likewise, because she didn't seem to know about the cost of craft beer, the fact that she tried to replace it with a load of other beers that she perceived as nice shows that she was apologetic. Not really a shitty thing to do, simply a mistake made by somebody who doesn't understand your hobby. I'd rather lose a bottle of beer than have my wife's friends think I was a prick."

If you like sourzbro, you should try Linenkegels. If you like locals, you should try your local bro, they're like really local and hip and local and small so your gonna pay more but they're local so it's cool you know. If you like stouts, have you ever tried Ginnez? I don't know if any other beer exists, maybe you should try cocktology if Yinglind doesn't do it for you."

If you like the taste you should try adding oranges to Yinglling because it will taste the same. If the hopsy serra las begas is older than 2 weeks get Pliny (ALL HAIL) its the best

The darker line is from Google Search Trends (the higher the line, the more the term is searched).  Basically, there is a big uptick in reviews at the end of 2011/beginning of 2012 and Heady Topper started getting searched for more and more.  However, the interesting thing (for me) was the fact that there were sporadic reviews as early as 2004. So, there was a ""switch"" that flipped (not sure what cause it?) and then everyone thought Heady Topper was the bomb."
beercirclejerk,2v7je5,adamjackson1984,10,Sun Feb 8 20:10:31 2015 UTC,"Heady topper began to be canned. Before the spike, it was alchemist brew pub only. You'd have to visit Waterbury Vermont to order a glass when it was available. Then cans started and people could trade it. September 2011 Irene hit VT. The alchemist brewpub was destroyed but they had already started work on building a cannery. Despite the tragedy of the hurricane, alchemist got a ton of press both in a sad story and ""oh btw, their cannery is opening soon"" great beer plus support your local brewery tragedy lead to a lot of hype. Heady is a great beer but it was a perfect circle. Good beer, sad story, packaged beer after a decade of being draft only and a huge growth in popularity for Vermont beer in general. That explains the spike and subsequent google searches.   Heady was not the best beer alchemist brewpub made but it was a local favorite. I don't think alchemist intended to only can Heady. But it was so popular, they never had a chance to brew anything else for the first 2 years.   Check the 2013 oscars date as well. Heady was a part of the celeb swag bags 13 or 14.

beercirclejerk,2uft3f,unlimitedzen,11,Mon Feb 2 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"I'm so relieved to see that so many beer drinkers really don't give a shit about what other people drink.  One of my biggest peeves/disappointments are the late to the party hipster/crafties constantly talking about beer like it is some intellectual badge.  I was at a local brewery Saturday enjoying a pint and down sits two neck beard, beanie wearing hipsters asking the bar keep ""What is new?"". (Forgive me the cliched description) She hands them the list and they both comb over it like it is an encyclopedia dispensing the secrets of the female anatomy. They both look up to the obviously underwhelmed waitress and say.   ""So nothing new?""  She says, ""We brew every day so everyday we have ""new"" beer.""   I start laughing/chuckling/smiling and give the waitress a ""wink"".   The neckbeard/hipster/beanie wearing flannel shirt wearing boys groan with disappointment.   She says, ""Boys, what can I get you?""   They pause and she simply walks away. Did not even turn around.  About 2 minutes later the waitress brings me a fresh beer (an Imperial Red), unsolicited. My eyes light up and she gives me a wink.   I say, ""A beautiful woman bringing me a fresh cold beer is one of life's greatest pleasures. I thank you with all my heart.""  She smiles and says, ""Your very welcome. We love our beer and we love when people enjoy it.""  No shit. I was just taken a bit by the emotion of it all. I may have teared up a bit. The wink was an added plus. (We are simple men.)  Now the hipsters scramble for a decision and she places both hands on the bar in front of them and leans in waiting for them to make a decision. To be honest her pose, her boobs, her smirk was extremely sexy. She wanted a decision and there was some moxie behind it all.  They say nothing. Heads still buried in the ""list"".  She says, ""Boys let me know when you've made your decision."" and walks away.  I raise my glass to the hipsters and say, ""Heres to beer. May it be cold, refreshing, satisfying and true.""  They both look at me with dismissive nods and try and waive down the waitress. I swear I was so enjoying this whole thing being played out and could not wait to see what would unfold next.  The hipsters start to waive down the waitress and she either is ignoring them or teaching them a lesson, I am not sure. So to give you a time line here, the boys are sitting at a brewery with approximately 25 - 30 beer choices and we are about 10 minutes into their beer choice dilemma and still they have not ordered a beer.  She finally walks over and says, ""Boys, have you decided?""   They order two IPA's. She smiles and says ""Good Choice"".  Most of us really love beer. Never be ashamed of loving beer. Ever.   And when a beautiful woman leans over the bar in a power position with cleavage, an amazing bosom and an amazing smile and asks you what you want, Deliver your order with confidence, pride and joy.  Edit: TL;DR - Don't be indecisive with what you drink. Be proud of what you drink.  Edit 2: Fuck the down votes. The story is not only true but a lesson in enjoying both who you are and what you drink. If you can't fucking decide on what to drink, what does that say about deciding who you are or want to be.  Edit 3: Clearly I pissed off some hipsters with what I thought was a funny story about getting a free beer and watching two jerk offs studying a menu like there was some sort of test at the end. Fuck off.  Signed,  Greg ""Stone_One"" Koch"
beercirclejerk,2uft3f,I_love_Hopslam,11,Sun Feb 1 21:02:20 2015 UTC,close the sub. no man can jerk harder. it cannot be done
beercirclejerk,2uft3f,codytownshend,6,Mon Feb 2 00:30:31 2015 UTC,"Awww man. I just love beer. The story happened yesterday at a brewery that I frequent. I also brew beer. Been brewing for about 7 years now. I just love beer.  No I did not make it with the bartender. As I said I frequent the brewery and she serves me often. We often have wonderful conversations about beer and brewing much like writers talk about books. On several occasions we've discussed the evolution of both beer, and beer drinkers. We've discussed the ""hipster"" element within the beer brewing community and I do have a flair for words and thoroughly enjoyed writing the post to share an experience I had yesterday.  Power stance. When a bartender places both hands on the bar and hovers over you while you decide what to order.  Being indecisive because you don't know what to order is not a problem at all. Having an expectation that a brewery should always be offering up ""new beer"" can be a challenge and one that can be frustrating for a brewer. But it also can help the creative side by experimenting and pushing to explore new ingredients.  Knowing who you are and what you want to drink was said tongue in cheek and draws from my upbringing. I am considerably older than most of the Reddit crowd. Maybe the difficulty in making decisions today comes from either or the following.   Too many choices. Lack of confidence.   Neither makes you bad or less deserving. I just thought the story was funny and I enjoyed writing it.  Sorry to have offended."

beercirclejerk,2si9qz,BornAgainNewsTroll,7,Thu Jan 15 14:56:46 2015 UTC,Pairing is for newbz.  You need to take a crisp well balanced german beer and randallize it with the cookie of your choice. Hop tonez are only used to cover up mistakes in the cookie flavor.

beercirclejerk,2s40y0,316nuts,14,Mon Jan 12 01:45:45 2015 UTC,"I am reminded of a story I heard on NPR a number of years ago of a couple who bought a very expensive wine bottle of wine early in their their relationship. The kept it around for over a decade saving it for just the right occasion. To bring only the brutal point out of a short telling of a longer, much more eloquent story, she is diagnosed with ass cancer and passes away and they never get to share the wine together. He is obviously bothered by the bottles presence in his life and does a noble thing and gives it to a young a couple as a gift with the story of why you should enjoy things in the moment.   To add insult to injury, when the young couple opens the bottle, they discover that the cork dried out and the wine was spoiled. Not only that, but it turns out the bottle is cursed. So, without knowing it, the couple introduces a wine demon into their house. The wine demon hides in the shadows for the first few years, mostly just spying on the couple when the dude is getting his rocks off. For some reason the demon has a fluid fetish. But as time passes, things start to escalate and get out of hands. Objects are moved. The wine cellar is shuffled. Underwear is sniffed. Long story short, that sour bottle of aged wine didn't just ruin one anal canal.  This story hits me again very personally as I have always been a bit of a hoarder when it comes to such things. I have cases of Hopslazmsmzs in my basement. I still have CBS and I'm sure the maple notes are still there, just more subtle. I have seen things go bad waiting for the right time to have them and was reminded of my propensity for this on Friday when the wife pulled out a bottle of Boulevard's Grainstorm that I had stashed in my beer cellar, and as I opened it I noticed that best by date was sometime in 2013. And sure enough, that night, I discovered a particularly nasty polyp while raw doggin' her.   The beer was still drinkable, though she liked it more than I did. All I could think of was how much better it might have tasted had I waited to open the beer until after the funeral. At least this way I would be widowed, but not widowed and haunted."

I have to admit I did this rather tongue in cheek, but that vast, overwhelming majority of my readers this time around don’t know me personally. Oops. I’ve read the discussion going on here and elsewhere and many of you are 100% right. Small pours and flights are a good way to meet the beer, if an imperfect way to assess it or rate it overall. Trusting your palate begins with you, and the way you see best to indulge, flight or no flight. In the end, it is just about finding something new. With the staggering growth in the industry, beer drinkers of all stripes will continue to have fantastic opportunities to try new things and sharpen their teeth on new takes on styles old and new. The 4000 breweries that will exist in this country by year’s end need new converts to keep up, and education, in any form it may take, will keep the happy craft beer ship sailing. No, flight drinkers, you’re not dumb. Some of you are leading the charge toward a more inclusive industry and culture. My concern, and the one I very haphazardly ventured to voice here, is that flights may be seen to craft beer novices as a “one-size-fits-all” solution for getting into beer. I hope I’m wrong. Starting a discussion on these terms, however, will not at all be productive or meaningful. That’s my bad. So, while I have earned your scorn and backlash, I do challenge you each to find a friend or a loved one who is on the fence about beer, and show them all of the wonders that can be found inside a glass, no matter the size."

beercirclejerk,2rj3mu,Muhs,6,Wed Jan 7 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"Horrible article. It implies that Boston lager was the only beer they made until the new IPAs. The truth is that they make like 50 beers, the most expensive beer, and have always been innovating. Boston brewing has developed many new strains of yeast, new malts, and new beer styles unique to them. And all before their competitors founded breweries. No one else has a $200 beer. The only reason IPAs are popular is because the Sam Adams commercials saying that more hops is better. Only new comers prefer IPAs. Most people are only just now discovering craft beers, and they start with IPAs. Sam Adams barrel aged beers (of which the are 6 i believe) are some of the best beers out there (though little promoted or known). They're unique beers that are truly special, but expensive."

They are mostly in unlabeled bottles from small breweries that no longer exist, but that's how I roll.  In terms of hiding bodies and or bottles, make sure you hire a private contractor. You'll have to bribe them to avoid paying property fees and getting the local government involved to make sure you meet all the regulations and requirements to do major construction on your property. Also, I recommend having a cellar bellow your cellar. Use your main cellar as a friendly front in case any neighbors or K-9 Units decide to inspect it! This way no one will stumble upon your bottles!! Cheers."

beercirclejerk,2nzn5r,ProdigalPunker,3,Tue Dec 2 05:26:57 2014 UTC,"Cantillon Feestbier was a one-off gooseberry lambic that wasn't really sold ever, so that is why it was so rare, and only two bottles were ever auctioned off to my knowledge.  Our group thought the flavor on the Feestbier was very good, no off character and the gooseberry was present, bright, and sharp. The aroma though was very musty, almost mushroomy, which has happened a few times tasting various other special lambics. For instance, I had a mushroomy aroma from a Drie Fonteinen 1998 50th Anniversary Oude Geuze that was bought at Akurrat in Stockholm that had been cellared properly. Then last month, I tried the same lambic from the same vintage at The Festival in Los Angeles and it was divine. So it is possible our Feestbier bottle had some sort of ""off"" character that can happen with old lambic.  The 1999 Framboos was much better and totally worth it, it doesn't taste too much like the new Framboos released in 2011 in that it wasn't very seedy or puckeringly sour. Much softer overall.  But in general, there is no bottle of beer that is worth that much money for the taste alone. I think collectors and beer nerds like me are willing to pay just for the experience knowingly perfectly well that it will not the best beer ever by any means.  EDIT: For more specific reviews of the Feestbier bottle that was bought at auction, they are found here. All the reviews from 2012 were from the two bottles auctioned off: http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/cantillon-feestbier-hbl/78507/1/1/"

But the science is probably pretty solid, as long as they know what they're doing with the results. Some breweries use similar equipment to quantify flavor components for QC purposes. The company running the app doesn't need detailed identification/quantification data, they just need a fingerprint for the beer. Then they could use statistical methods to identify your preferences without even being able to articulate what flavors you like or don't like.  But yeah, they'll probably only ever log, and of course their camera feature will only ever work with, beers with high production and broad distribution. And if you like beers from your local breweries that the app probably doesn't work with, you already know what you like and don't need an app to tell you."
