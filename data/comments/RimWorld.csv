RimWorld,3dxoxc,BlizzCounty,2,Mon Jul 20 11:58:08 2015 UTC,"Sandbags won't protect turrets since they are considered buildings, you might as well use the steel for more turrets.  However, I disagree with focusing on the scythers first. It all depends on the weapons the centipedes have.  If a centipede has an inferno cannon? I always focus most of my turrets on those first and have a turret or two focus on the scythers.  But yes, turrets are the way to get rid of these. You can also build an EMP mortar to stun the mechs quite easily for an extended period of time.  To OP: Make sure your power conduit (And other turrets for that matter) is 4+ spaces away from the turrets so they don't get destroyed if the turret blows up. Depending on how wealthy your colony is, you might need much more than 4 turrets."
RimWorld,3dxoxc,slayerxvi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:16:29 2015 UTC,"That's why I said to set up the sandbags+walls behind the turrets.  If you don't have snipers I assume the amount of mechs that spawn will be pretty low. If you run out of turrets before they run out of scythers you're going to loose limbs or organs. Centipes can't hit shoot for shit and the inferno cannon doesn't deal an insane amount of damage. But yeah, focus the centipede with inferno first after the scythers."

They also don't do anything but temporarily disable mechs and possibly other electronics, so they should be safe to use in close proximity to buildings and colonists.  Oh, and for traditional mortars, I find that it takes a battery of 7+ (the shooting skill of the colonists manning them has no impact on accuracy, from what I've heard and seen) to reliably land rounds on, say, a siege force or sappers, landing one or two rounds on target for every few full volleys. Mortars are just inaccurate as shit; incendiaries may be the way to go just to create huge hazard areas, but that has the unpleasant effect of destroying any salvage..."

RimWorld,3dwmmt,willkydd,5,Mon Jul 20 03:41:12 2015 UTC,I would say its worth it. Seems like every patch adds new stuff. Plus theres alot of mods that can change the gameplay as well.
RimWorld,3dwmmt,R3dcell,2,Mon Jul 20 03:52:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  It's a fully functional game on its own with enough random variables to keep replays very satisfying, and variables you can choose yourself that add another layer to the experience (IE only taking old colonists or starting in a harsh climate).  Throw on top of that the solid modding community and the fact the dev keeps adding more content, I would say that it's worth more than the 30 dollars I paid for it. :p"
RimWorld,3dwmmt,BlizzCounty,3,Mon Jul 20 04:44:59 2015 UTC,It always was worth it!
RimWorld,3dwmmt,Smiffsten,2,Mon Jul 20 11:17:52 2015 UTC,I personally would wait till you can get a steam key but if you don't care about that then yes definitely worth.
RimWorld,3dwmmt,PoLoMoTo,3,Mon Jul 20 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say it is. I have to admit I torrented Rimworld a few alphas ago to give it a look see before buying it (early access and all, 30 bucks is a lot for an EA game imo) and wasn't impressed. It was cool but it didn't really intrigue me. I recently torrented it again and found the game has changed quite a bit (new biomes, the AI is a lot better now, the sapper AI in particular) and then discovered the modding community. I picked it up a few days later. The vanilla game is good but for me it's all about the mods. Get the ultimate modpack and it's an entirely new game."
RimWorld,3dwmmt,winowmak3r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:31:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely the Dev has announced he will be taking a holliday (he's just one man after all) and so has been pushing to have the game virtually complete before he goes.

RimWorld,3dwmmt,kaptain_kavern,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"let me ask you this, why should it be ""worth"" more later than now.  is it because you believe that if you buy it now and later on the game improves you will have to buy it again or something like that ?  if you plan on buying it what dfference does it make if you pay now or pay later?"
RimWorld,3dwmmt,Beefstaek,2,Tue Jul 21 07:15:22 2015 UTC,"It's an early access game. Meaning that sometimes games can be abandoned by their developer. If there's not enough content in there to warrant a purchase in the current state, then the only thing I am banking on, is that the content I was promised gets added. Like Spacebase DF-9 for example."
RimWorld,3dwmmt,Beefstaek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:23:07 2015 UTC,so still if you plan on buying it anyway whats the difference if you buy it now or later ?  since you dont ask if to buy at all i assume you already made up your mind about buying it and as you explain you only want to know if its worth buying now or later... so again my question remains whats the difference if you want to buy it anyway?  the only reason that comes to my mind not buying now is simply waiting for it to be on steam but then again theres no problem buying it now and asking for a steamkey afterwards probably it will be that everyone will get one automatically send to his mail anyway... so yea  buying it now or later makes no difference.
RimWorld,3dwmmt,akicebear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:26:34 2015 UTC,"Well you're just reading too much into it. When I say I'll buy it later, it doesn't always mean that I'll 100% buy it later. It means that I'll buy it in the future date if there's some reason that convinces me to do so. I.E.- sale, big update, full release, bundle, etc.  And like I said initially, I wouldn't end up buying it later if it gets abandoned by it's dev like Spacebase. So I was wondering if it's promising but also if there's enough content in the current state to actually play the game."

RimWorld,3dr5k9,smutticus,2,Sat Jul 18 21:06:00 2015 UTC,"Your colonists will also fight fires when they're drafted.  Tell them to stand next to a fire and they'll automatically put out any fires on the adjacent tiles.  So you can wake them by drafting and directing them exactly where you want them to fight the fire.  This is a much more hands-on method because you have to actively manage them, but it can be really effective at prioritizing specific sections to put out so the fire doesn't spread where you don't want it to.  Drafting/undrafting to wake them should also work.  If they refuse to fight a fire, it may be because it's not in a home zone region."
RimWorld,3dr5k9,slayerxvi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:02:35 2015 UTC,"Will have to try this, better than telling them to prioritize every single fire.

They also get dementia at around 40%-60%.

If the pirate bands can afford to send 50 people at you, have all of them die or be captured, then send another 50 people after a few days, imagine how many people they have sitting at their base. Maybe if small colonies were added to each world only for the purpose of being attacked by you it could work, but I think the existing factions would be to big."

The adaptive and engineering processes that have branched baseline humanity into these uncounted variations have also applied to our flora and fauna. Where we colonize, we bring our ecosystems of plants and animals with us.

Relationships are my next hope (friends/family/romantic/enemy). Then tools (drills, axes, wrenches, pickaxes, hammers).  Judging from the change log this is going to be a HUGE change on the level of temperature or the health system. I mean seriously I don't know about you but I'm going to be partaking in husbandry on an industrial level which will no doubt require a base of much larger size than currently.  Also this is going to change the dynamic of raids so much more. There's no way I'm letting them steal my precious animals. Or hit them with mortars. No more hiding and waiting it out, or heading to a safe room.  And I've got to assume that this change will also allow for the side-step into pets. Surely we'll see wolves/dogs/cats as domestic pets.  Imagine if a raider kills your colony dog. Or... jesus I hadn't even thought of this... but imagine a bad winter where you have to euthanize, butcher and eat your colony dogs.  I love this game so much."

RimWorld,3dgsx8,Valindore,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"I actually did just this built a ""temp"" room with a bunch of coolers and a few heaters for cold snaps. It actually isn't the best. I wanted to avoid having to but a cooler per room as you need a space behind the cooler and I like for my base to look neat. I have a large base with almost 30 colonist rooms connected with vents to my temp room. And although it does keep the temp around 70 during normal times it doesn't work well enough for heat waves and cold snaps. So just in my small common room I have a cooler and a heater. So in the event of a cold or heat wave they have a place they can seek a desired temp.   If I could go back I'm not sure if I would make a temp room again. As with a large base like mine the vents do not seem to work 100% of the time. My ""cool"" view (when you double click on coolers to see where the hot and cold air goes) doesn't show my ac'ed air getting into every room in my base. However when I double click my vents all the rooms ""share temp"" so if your making a base that will support under 15 colonists and is on the small to medium size go for it. But if you are making a long term base (trying to make it crazy) then make sure you have rooms that are constantly 70 so they can go there during severe weather."

Once the escape pod pawn is able, they will leave.  If you want to capture and try to recruit them for your colony, you need a room with beds marked for prisoners. Then do the same as above, but select capture instead of rescue. Just make sure you have a pawn marked to prioritize wardening so the prisoner will be fed.

RimWorld,3de3fe,metaldragen,2,Wed Jul 15 15:53:29 2015 UTC,"Make another bed in a seprate room, click the bed, set it as prisoner, click your warden then right click the injured guy and hit capture."
RimWorld,3de3fe,Oakislife,2,Wed Jul 15 15:51:41 2015 UTC,"Annnnd... in hindsight, this seems so obvious. Thanks to everyone that answered.  I'm really enjoying this, so far."
RimWorld,3de3fe,AllenWL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:12:08 2015 UTC,You have two choices.   Rescue.   Make a bed(or sleeping spot) then mark it as a medical bed. Rescue the poor sap. Treat him/her. Say bye as they ditch you the first chance they get.   Capture.   Make a room. Put a bed in the room. Mark it as a prison bed. Capture the refugee. Treat & recruit.
RimWorld,3dc8la,Deveyus,14,Wed Jul 15 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"It will be after another few seconds awake. Look at the space meter current reading and estimated target after adjustment. I think the reading only changes when awake, not asleep, which is why spacious bedrooms don't matter soooo much in the current alpha - unless they are duel use."
RimWorld,3dc8la,akicebear,20,Wed Jul 15 03:55:16 2015 UTC,"unless they are duel use   Sword fights in the bedroom are awesome, but -I agree- they need more space..."

RimWorld,3dc8la,BlizzCounty,6,Thu Jul 16 14:52:33 2015 UTC,Beauty and space bars don't move while they're sleeping so it's not necessary to have big bedrooms or put art in them.

RimWorld,3dc8la,SkyNTP,2,Wed Jul 15 22:51:44 2015 UTC,"This issue is exactly why I always give my colony 2*3 rooms, light, bed and door. It's much more efficient and space saving."

RimWorld,3dc8la,hopeseekr,6,Wed Jul 15 18:54:17 2015 UTC,"I wish they would get used to stuff. After butchering almost 150 people, I feel my colony should be a bit desensitized to the moral qualms of butchering humans."
RimWorld,3ddrnc,QuotesUnquotes,4,Wed Jul 15 14:03:27 2015 UTC,"There are no mods for world generation that I know of. I'd enjoy the challenge though.  As for biomes and AIs, just try them and have fun with it. This genre of game is really about experimentation and learning from your mistakes and building your next colony to fix those mistakes."
RimWorld,3ddrnc,Blitzkriegsler,3,Wed Jul 15 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"Ive mostly done temperate forest and jungle mountain bases, my next stop is the dessert, you can change storyteller/difficulty in the options so if you want a bit more punch after starting you can get it"
RimWorld,3ddrnc,n00bslyr,2,Wed Jul 15 15:02:18 2015 UTC,"I want to second desert, especially if you do a nice flat map. It's not really hard, but being limited on where you can plant crops plus the whole walled city vibe gives a unique experience that's pretty different from what you're used to.  If you really want ""hard"", do the coldest piece of ice sheet you can find. It's the only biome I fully expect I'll have to resort to cannibalism on."
RimWorld,3ddrnc,TrashCanWarrior,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"I'm currently playing on the coldest spot I could find in the ice sheets. It gets down to -95C in the Winter and -20C in the Summer. The only real hard part is the beginning: you have to act fast to survive the first night. One of my colonists lost a toe. Then you build a greenhouse over the biggest/most convenience place with a little farmable strip of land. You might have to resort to a bit of cannibalism if you take too long to build the farm. My colonists butchered the first wanderer because he was useless, but it turned out they didn't really need the food (though it was close).  From them on, it because easier than most places, with the caveat that you need to be watchful of how long your colonists spend outside, and during Winter they can't do much outside. I say it gets easier because visitors will often die of hypothermia, and you get an endless stream of human meat and leather to sell (there's only one grave in my 4 year colony), clothes and weapons, not to mention the cold deals with sieges for you. You can just sit and wait, and they all drop dead eventually."
RimWorld,3ddrnc,gullale,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:39 2015 UTC,"I like to play ice sheet too, but with a no cannibalism policy. It's tough, as there are no animals to hunt. Making a 'warm house' on top of a thermal surrounded by soil is the only way to survive long term. Don't use wood for construction, keep it for camp fires. Final tip, build comms unit fast so you can buy food and fuel from the Bulk Suppliers."
RimWorld,3ddrnc,CMSpunkmeyer,2,Wed Jul 15 21:56:33 2015 UTC,I enjoy playing cassandra classic in the mountains on the coldest part of the map. The scramble to stay alive is immediate as hypothermia sets in quick. Then you have to try and find food and usually end up resorting to canniblism
RimWorld,3ddrnc,skroflek,2,Thu Jul 16 02:20:01 2015 UTC,"If you're really interested in ""fsck you, your dog and your dog's fleas with a rusty metal pineapple"" types of challenges, try this :   1) Download and activate the Crash Landing Mod. This mod will literally have you landing just a minute ahead of the rest of your ship landing. On you. In bits. And in flames, which don't trigger the auto-rain/snow function of the game when large flames are burning, so you need to manually put it out. Oh, and if you're REALLY lucky, it might drop a highly radioactive reactor on you, so your colonists will have the pleasure of dying by radiation poisoning, flames or angry insane prisoners. Or just having bits of ship crash landing on you.  2) Embark on the coldest spot on the map. To find it, just switch the map view in the Embark screen to Temperature, then find the white spots.  3) Choose your Storyteller. I personally play Randy Random on Rough Difficulty.  4) Choose your starting peeps. Start the game.  5) Set survival goals for yourself : Initial landing, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year. See which one you can reach.  If that is not tough enough for you, try downloading and activating Marvin's Hot & Cold Pack This ensures, amongst other things, that all parkas, regardless of quality and materials, do shit against temperatures above -50C."
RimWorld,3ddrnc,Rauffie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:23:43 2015 UTC,Has anyone been able to survive an Ice Sheet start using the Hardcore SK set of mods? I tried but it seems far too long to get any type of power and farming going. Is it an impossible task?
RimWorld,3ddrnc,Bloodweaver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:08:28 2015 UTC,"It depends.  For example, the tundra gives you a entirely new threat level(cold, hunger, etc) but makes raids easier to deal with, and you don't have to worry about rotting food.  A desert lacks wood, so building is hard, and animals are scarce, but once you get a stable food source, it's not so hard.  It just depends on how you play, and how lucky you are. I've thrived in freezing tundras by luck and planning, and I've been slaughtered by a double mechanoid attack in a temperate forest. Just go to wherever interests you, and play however you want.  I personally prefer randy random on challenge mode(Ancient ship crash in the first month! Whee!) in a boreal forest. Small hills or flat, and no killboxes. Killboxes are for the weak!(evil laughter)"
