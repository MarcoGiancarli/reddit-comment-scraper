Not quite the same as the stuff you listed, but you might find it interesting. Ocoeur, TRDLX are part of this sort of thing, and there's a lot of stuff that's textural at Transient Festival in Paris. Access to Arasaka probably falls into the heavier side of the genre(?) too, and is from Colorado. If you look at some of N5md and Tympanik Audio's catalogue, you'll find a lot of stuff that's a cool mix of dark, textural and ambient beatwork."

futurebeats,3dxsyj,LustForLife,4,Mon Jul 20 12:28:05 2015 UTC,"Via FACT   Titled Assertion of a Surrounding Presence, the seven-track EP will be housed on Kuedo’s own Knives label, which debuted earlier this year with J.G. Biberkopf’s Ecologies and Jlin’s Dark Energy (an album released on Planet Mu, but A&Red by Knives). It features collaborations with Egyptrixx, Mind:Body:Fitness and Roly Porter, who previously worked with Kuedo in Vex’d.  Fans of Kuedo’s Severant album will be in luck – there’s plenty more of those intense hi-hat rushes that draw from Southern hip-hop and Chicago’s drill here (though Jlin’s violent footwork also feels like a key inspiration) – but the corners feel even sharper and the colours even more vivid. Throw in some seriously evil gamelan and a healthy dose of Ghost in the Shell worship, and you’re looking at something special. It’s also worth noting that Biberkopf’s theatrical sound design seems to be an influence on the record, suggesting a nice dynamic where Kuedo’s already bouncing off other Knives artists.  Kuedo tells us that he “felt the presence of ambient power systems” while making the record. “Planetary computation as a militarized zone. Latent potential for states, psychological and infrastructural, to destabilize, disrupt and dissolve. For such ambient presences to physically materialize and assert themselves. For known systems to become uncanny. Emergence out of complex systems. The here, the now. Cold rush. Engagement with musics that have described these concerns – 90s techstep, video game sound environments, anime soundtracks.”  The artwork is by Melbourne-based artist Joshua Petherwick, who “connotes the album’s aesthetic and concept with a nod to sci-fi writer Anthony Burgess’ fictional conceit of Nadsat – a cryptic systemisation of order in a dystopian environment – in his abstract yet acutely evocative geometries”.   Collabs with Roly and M:B:F, sounds pretty sweet."

futurebeats,3dgkl1,timesnewboston,9,Thu Jul 16 12:13:26 2015 UTC,"Seriously it just seems so awkward and forced. It's like he's really forcing his the whole ""TV show host"" persona.   I love him on Eric Andre Show and when he does stand up, but this show is not doing it for me."
futurebeats,3dgkl1,troywww,2,Thu Jul 16 16:08:11 2015 UTC,"You could tell he really didn't have much say in it, and that CC probably just used a formula they've seen work. I had/still have such high hopes for this show because he's so funny in an offbeat way, but it just doesn't mesh with what the network might want."
futurebeats,3dgkl1,jboogie216,8,Fri Jul 17 00:16:39 2015 UTC,Too bad the first episode was turrible
futurebeats,3dgkl1,gammalbjorn,3,Thu Jul 16 12:01:49 2015 UTC,What's the deal with the show? Premise and such?
futurebeats,3dgkl1,chumshot,4,Thu Jul 16 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"It's bad so far, but really hope it picks up. It's basically another Chappelle Show type deal, same format as like Tosh.0 or Key and Peele. Live audience, some jokes, some sketch videos played back...that's about it. It just doesn't feel right for Hannibal, you can tell he's stressed out in this new role."
futurebeats,3dgkl1,gammalbjorn,4,Thu Jul 16 17:21:36 2015 UTC,"Somehow I was hoping for philosophical comedy. With the title, and FlyLo, it just seemed right."
futurebeats,3dgkl1,taotechill,2,Thu Jul 16 17:39:32 2015 UTC,Yeah. That is what it should have been.
futurebeats,3dgkl1,jastund,4,Thu Jul 16 18:54:44 2015 UTC,Because TV is just another job in this town. SAG/AFTRA benefits + ASCAP/BMI royalties in addition to the negotiated fee for the appearance... Ain't no shame in TV!

futurebeats,3ddsi1,trynafindgoodmusicok,3,Thu Jul 16 02:59:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I dont know why people are complaining. They add character to the track. They aren't clipping in an amateur way; its very controlled and going for a certain effect, like many artists have done (sleigh bells, how to dress well, Hudson mohawke, etc.)"
futurebeats,3ddsi1,digmachine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:17:55 2015 UTC,Its litterally called intentional clipping. Its not easy to do. And Rustie does it better than just about everyone else tosay with his kicks. Its definately intentional and meant to sound like that. People need to chill..the tracks good enough to look past it anyway if it really bothers you that much.
futurebeats,3ddsi1,ogbrowndude,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:43:34 2015 UTC,"yeah, it just comes down to aesthetic preferences and sphere of references, if you will. Some people can hear intentional clipping and fit it into a framework of other styles and effects in their mind; others just here clipping."
futurebeats,3ddsi1,digmachine,4,Sun Jul 19 02:46:24 2015 UTC,Interesting to hear Rustie do a remix of a UK Hardcore song.  Would have never thought!

futurebeats,3ddsi1,yayapfool,2,Fri Jul 17 02:45:12 2015 UTC,Great to see a bit of Gammer featuring in /r/futurebeats ! Interesting take on it but can't beat the original IMO

After a few listens I sooorta dig it, but it's just a tad cheesy even then. Gotta admit though, on the first listen, hearing that groove kick off after all that was oh so satisfying. Still, it's like the only ""hump"" in the album."

futurebeats,3d4f0d,lewdite,8,Mon Jul 13 17:32:29 2015 UTC,Specifically for future beats tho? Not that I've seen...
futurebeats,3d4f0d,big_shane,6,Mon Jul 13 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"Well I mean for starters, ""future beats"" isn't so much a genre as it is a movement (there's no definable qualities that make a song sound ""future"" rather it's a term to loosely applied contemporary electronic music that deviates from the mainstream ""EDM"" sound), so what you might consider to be ""future beats"" may really just be trap/juke/ghetto tech/RnB/hip hop.... The term ""future"" is not one that artists apply to themselves (except maybe Kanye West... It's an incredibly presumptuous term to use in a corner of the industry that is by and large quite humble).  So even if your blog took off, there would be another one of these threads in 6 months. And now let's assume your blog did take off and you had to start paying $200+ a month for hosting to keep your site from crashing... You think you're going to bring in enough ad revenue by posting up tracks from bedroom producers? No way! The reason why all music blogs cover major news and other genres of music is because you attract more viewers which in turn earns more ad dollars which allow you to keep paying for better hosting to accommodate all the viewers that keep coming to your site! You need to have breadth in order to keep the cycle going... Or else you can't pay your hosting, your site crashes, viewership drops off and the cycle spins in reverse..., which is fine if you're okay with paying out of pocket for a few hundred readers a month... But these two reasons are why you won't see any ""major"" blogs that feature ""future beats"" exclusively. Plus it gets s super boring to write about the same shit all the time!  Gl hf dd! <3"
futurebeats,3d4f0d,lewdite,6,Mon Jul 13 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree with all of your points. Yes, futurebeats is a umbrella name for smaller genres. Yes, there has to be a lot of luck to get the blog to take off. Yes, The chance of making money is veeeeery slim in this business. But that all doesn't matter for me. I want people to see the genres we love the same way as we do. I want them to learn about things they didn't know before, and fill their life with great music.  The money I spend a month on the hosting will be spend with love, because I know that I spend it on something I love.  The genre thing was something I was thinking about as well, and my idea is to split the site in to 3 category's:   BEATS (For DJ Shadow/Kaytranada/ATU type music) BASS (For Ganz/Rustie/Mr. Carmack type music) BLEEPS (From Pusher/Eprom/PC music type music)   Of course there are artists who fit in 2 or 3 catagories, but that's no problem!  Thanks for the feedback! I really like feedback like this because it makes me rethink, and in a way better shape the website, but with all the positive feedback in this threat I am set on doing this! I already got some mails from people with writing talent who would like to help, so I am going for it!"
futurebeats,3d4f0d,Turbodeth,3,Mon Jul 13 22:20:00 2015 UTC,"$200/month for hosting a blog is absurd. A $50/month server would happily serve 100k+ pages per day, and that'd be a very popular blog. I'd say a music blog (with no marketing expenses) is doing pretty well at 10k page views per day, and that'd cost $10/month, if that."
futurebeats,3d4f0d,big_shane,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"While all very true points, I definitely think of certain artists as the ""future"" niche of their genre. For future house, there's Tchami, Oliver Heldens, Jauz, etc. None of their music is textbook ""house"" really, and a blog that combines news and songs from all of the artists who are at the driving edge of their genre, say like Skrillex back in 2009/20120 with dubstep, would probably have a decent readership among producers and avid listeners trying to stay current on the changing tides of music. I'm just sick of all the banger blogs like thissongissick and all that shit, so something for the breaking edge of music would be tight. It sounds a little pretentious or hipster, I guess, but I'm tired of the same sounds coming through over and over."
futurebeats,3d4f0d,Turbodeth,5,Mon Jul 13 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"Why not just stick to the subreddit? Since everyone here seems keen to write for the ""blog"", wouldn't the blog just be /r/futurebeats users posting /r/futurebeats content? This subreddit is basically a blog featuring a core group of users posting music. Just post your reviews in your threads and you've already achieved a blog, but with voting."
futurebeats,3d4f0d,domotobin,3,Mon Jul 13 22:15:53 2015 UTC,"With a blog, you have editorial control, which may or may not be important to OP. I do think more reviews/discussions in the sub would be great, though."

futurebeats,3d4f0d,cookmesomebacon,2,Mon Jul 13 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"So you need to have a name that makes the genre clear. What about a simple idea like ""Different Beats""? Maybe beats is the wrong word given the shitty earphone manufacturer...but do you get what I mean? It needs to be elegant and clear for what it is. OR another - ""Not Just For Dancing""? 4 initials make for fun logo ideas :)"

I was really put off at first by Another Eternity because it felt too poppy and lacking depth, almost generic at times, but I agree, the album has really grown on me. It's still not as good as their first, and there are a few songs that feel lacking, but I'll be interested to see where Purity Ring go from here."

It's pretty complex. 10k worldwide digital in perpetuity for this song would be pretty high. Rates spike when broadcast comes into play.

futurebeats,3cdt53,OKDokeComputer,96,Tue Jul 7 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"maybe on /r/futurebeats but 99% of people watching a mcdonalds ad will have no idea who sophie is.  also the post-irony thing was a tongue-in-cheek comment on how absurd it is that the PC music aesthetic of faux consumerism exaggerated to the point of irony is now being used by McDonalds, one of the most famous and notorious consumer brands (the likes of which PC music was mocking in the first place)"
futurebeats,3cdt53,vmcreative,39,Tue Jul 7 03:37:02 2015 UTC,"In the words of the Homestuck character Dave Strider, ""The upper echelons of irony should always include measures of sincerity. And if the satirical practice is executed faithfully it will achieve something bona fide in its own right regardless. Through an intense commitment bordering on religious devotion to the absolutely inane, absurd, or plain fucking stupid, a very different kind of sincerity begins to materialize. One of reverence to the ridiculous. You begin to ""mean it,"" but what exactly it is you mean is never quite what appears on the surface, and is utterly inaccessible to obtuse and literal minds. That you ""mean it"" then becomes inseparable from the joke, and additional rich strata of humor may be stripped aggressively from this irreconcilable truth."""
futurebeats,3cdt53,pohatu,8,Tue Jul 7 05:06:46 2015 UTC,Wow. How did anyone put words to that. I didn't even think it was explainable. That's incredible. Beautiful. Fucking brilliant.

futurebeats,3cdt53,Pantstown,18,Tue Jul 7 04:29:38 2015 UTC,"I really recommend this article. It changed my perspective on the whole PC Music thing. From the ending:    “We’re trying to subliminally send a message through my [GFOTY] music, that you’d never be able to hear because it’s subliminal.”  So what’s that message?  “The thing is, it’s a secret because if I say message, people won’t listen any more because they’re gonna know about it. But it’s basically: ‘Bang me and give me your money.’”  Perhaps it’s best not to overthink it."

It's just playfulness. Maybe the materialism came before the success for PC music but it's not as layered as people are making it. It's just fun and materialism.

futurebeats,3cf65e,reidburial,0,Tue Jul 7 18:02:44 2015 UTC,Discussing leaks is just as bad for the artist as sharing the leak.
futurebeats,3cf65e,Cody2o0,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:08:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry, can't say I agree with you. It gives people a discussion forum to be able to talk about the album, and whether they will buy it or not."
futurebeats,3cf65e,Cody2o0,0,Tue Jul 7 13:19:08 2015 UTC,"Lets say for arguments sake that nobody ever shares the leak, no one would ever know that the album was leaked, causing no harm whatsoever to the artists, but if what you say is true, then people can listen to the album free of charge.   If everyone is given this privilege, then the artist loses a potential sale just because someone decided they didn't like it. That definitely affects the artist is a negative way."
futurebeats,3cf65e,Cody2o0,0,Tue Jul 7 13:27:45 2015 UTC,"What you are saying makes sense in a perfect world. But in an age of Spotify, AppleMusic, YouTube, etc. anyone can preview the album before buying it, therefore giving them the option to listen to it for free.   Also reviewers get the albums early, and post reviews all over the internet. Their opinions will influence potential sales."

futurebeats,3cbfhn,TroySamuela,4,Mon Jul 6 16:49:18 2015 UTC,why did you change your name from samuel truth to troy samuela?
futurebeats,3cbfhn,purpledrankk,2,Mon Jul 6 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"i was never really happy with the name, my friends just started calling me truth and i just took that and ran with it. i changed it to troy because i can never be unhappy with my real name lol. it also represented a change in direction for me i guess"
futurebeats,3cbfhn,TroySamuela,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:23:09 2015 UTC,Respect. I just really like the way Samuel Truth rolled off the tongue haha. I understand you wanted to go in a different direction but I still feel like you are essentially still in the future beats genre just like before. This song trouble is definitely darker than your Sam Truth stuff but I don't see why can't produce both the dirtier stuff and clean melodic vibes under one name just like Carmack. Idk im just ranting because im literally listening to Sam Truth stuff while I'm typing this and I honestly miss your older sounds. You had the dreamy melodic vibes perfected and it was like no one else in the game. I just dont understand why you would change what you were so good at producing.   P.S. I still listen to Trout is Salmon almost everynight before I go to bed. It's honestly one of my all time favorite songs and it makes me happy whenever I listen to it.
futurebeats,3cbfhn,purpledrankk,2,Wed Jul 8 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely man! I haven't completely strayed from the Sam Truth stuff, I have just been enjoying making the darker stuff lately but I do have a few works in progress that are a lot more melodic and laid back :) Haha that's awesome man, that song was such a weird trip to make, glad you can appreciate it!"
futurebeats,3cbfhn,TroySamuela,2,Wed Jul 8 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"This track is pretty fucking nuts compared to your sam truth stuff, but the dopest way. It's got so much to it that I don't even really know where to begin, but I love it. everything just feels really pushed to the max. What inspired this dramatic change in sound?"
futurebeats,3cbfhn,milkeggscoffee,3,Tue Jul 7 03:54:32 2015 UTC,thank you man! i guess i wanted to do a complete flip from what i had been known for. i noticed a lot of the trends on soundcloud started to box me into a certain sound and i wanted to break out of that in the most dramatic way i could. i still enjoy making that music but i really love making darker music at the moment.
