bostontrees,3d498r,quackers_82,2,Mon Jul 13 17:46:01 2015 UTC,This is looking like it will be a real dispensary. Not like what Salem's ATG is trying to be.  You can actually walk in and see the strains and products in person?  Great!   I went to Maine's Wellness Connection recently (paid the extra $50) and it was awesome.  Got my number just like at the deli counter and ordered what I needed when it was my turn.  Something like that closer to home will certainly be welcome over that long drive.  Hopefully Salem will come around with the competition.
bostontrees,3d498r,JiggyJack,2,Tue Jul 14 03:03:47 2015 UTC,Can you share a bit more info about the Maine process? Not optimistic that I'll be able to buy in MA before late fall..
bostontrees,3d498r,postmasterp,2,Tue Jul 14 07:30:18 2015 UTC,"Maine will accept MA patients if you have the following documentation: your MA medical card, the ID used to get your card (usually driver's license) and a Maine Certificate printed on special paper from your certifying doctor.  I used Cannamed for my initial certification so I went back there and they charged me $50 to get the Maine cert.  I went to the Portland (mainewellness.org) because I thought it was the closest but there is another company (canuvo.org) that is in Biddeford which is 30 minutes closer to Boston.  You can only have one registered dispensary at at time so it is probably easier to pick one and stick with it.  If nothing good opens around here by the time I need to resupply I will probably make the switch to the closer one.  As a first time patient in Maine you need to schedule an appointment (after that they take walk-ins).  Once there you fill out a bunch of paperwork (basic questions) and then you meet with someone who explains everything to you.    She gave me lots of info sheets, a coupon for a 3 gram sampler for $41 (and 5% off everything else) and a ticket like at a deli counter.  Once they call your number you go up to the counter (3 budtenders) and tell them what you want.  They had a good selection of strains and edibles (good enough for me anyway).    It took about 30 minutes from the time I got there for them to verify my documents/paperwork and sit down with me.  All in all I was there about an hour.  I saw plenty of people come in and out in under 5-10 minutes while I was there.  Parking is around the back of the building, plenty of spaces when I was there.  Easy to get to off exit 5 on Route 1/295."

The price per gram ranged from $15-19 depending on the level.   I think I saw maybe $280/oz. for one of those levels.  Not sure if that is the high, mid or low end.  You can call them though and I'm sure they can give you an idea of the range.  It was around $6-8 for capsules and cookies (2 of each).  Maybe $15 for 1/2 oz. of tincture."

It is not really primary care physicians issuing these but specialized docs (I wouldn't really sweat getting one at all). The dispensaries are just opening and nothing like what you are used to but hopefully will rapidly improve. There is a caregiver system working now that works to get you what you need.

Mixed reviews. I thought a couple of the professors were really awesome and really on top of their shit (cultivation, science of cannabis). It's more of a general studies thing where you spend equal time on 12 (?) subjects so if you're not really interested in cannabis PR and history of hemp it's a little rough to sit through. It is good knowledge about cannabis though and enhances your credibility when speaking about the subject, contrary to u/americaandjesus's assessment. They are also involved with Bill Downing which is the ultimate reason I decided not to continue to associate. You can form your own opinions on him, but do a little research. It's not a grow school and they don't promise you a job in the industry. It's a great place to make a LOT of great connections in all parts of the actual industry, not this bullshit the DPH is ring leading.  I've also heard from multiple people that Mike at NE Grassroots was full of shit, his operation was rinky-dink, he has no idea what he is taking about and just taking people's money. He's probably a great guy and clearly runs a good operation from the feedback of his clients, point is people say all kinds of shit about everyone. I'd stop by an open house if you'd like to get a better idea of what they do in both cases.  The real advice here is to get involved in the actual community, the dab warz, anything MCR labs, grey area events in RI, secret cup. The schools are a good way to dip into that pool."

bostontrees,3ckgvi,jeffiethepirate,2,Wed Jul 8 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"~By Sara DiNatale   Mayor Martin J. Walsh says he knows medical marijuana dispensaries are coming to Boston and has no intention to try to block them. Yet three years after voters approved the medical use of marijuana, a proposal to open the city‚Äôs first ‚Äî and, so far, only ‚Äî dispensary in Downtown Crossing remains contentious.  Patriot Care Corp. has a license to sell medical marijuana and wants to open a dispensary at 21 Milk St. But the Zoning Board of Appeals, which must approve the location, deferred a decision until Aug. 4 after the issue attracted droves of passionate supporters and opponents to a City Hall hearing Tuesday.  If the Milk Street location is rejected, it could take Patriot Care ‚Äúmonths, maybe even a year or longer‚Äù to find an alternative site, said Patriot Care attorney Michael Ross, a former city councilor.  The mayor‚Äôs office recommended the deferral, encouraging Patriot Care to talk to opponents. Ross said the company will heed the mayor‚Äôs advice.  Patriot Care is the only company so far awarded a state license to sell medical marijuana in Boston. It is opening dispensaries in Greenfield and Lowell and is operating in Arizona and Washington, D.C.  Ross said the Downtown Crossing location is ideal, despite criticism from neighbors that it is too close to places frequented by children, such as the Freedom Trail and nearby bus stops.  Those critics said the dispensary should be attached to an existing medical facility.  Ross said the Milk Street site has been vacant for a decade and its central location and proximity to several subway lines make it convenient for those needing the drug.  Walsh, who was not present at Tuesday‚Äôs meeting but had stridently opposed adoption of the medical marijuana law, said Tuesday during a meeting with the Globe's editorial board that he recognized dispensaries are inevitable and that a shop could ‚Äúpotentially work‚Äù on Milk Street.  ‚ÄúI think a lot of people are concerned about the unknown,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSome neighbors are worried about the clientele it‚Äôs going to attract, others are worried about the location.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSix months from now,‚Äù the mayor said, ‚Äúwhen we have a medical marijuana facility in the city, it might not be an issue at all.‚Äù  Patriot Care is proposing a 6,000-square-foot facility that would be open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, including weekends. Ross said the dispensary would not be directly accessible from the sidewalk but ‚Äútucked away‚Äù in the building, which would also have office space.  The dispensary would have no signs on its exterior, Ross said.  City Council President Bill Linehan said the dispensary should be attached to, or near, a medical provider.  ‚ÄúMy mother suffered from Parkinson‚Äôs for 21 years and just passed months back, so we all know this is something that‚Äôs needed in our city, but this is not the right location,‚Äù Linehan said.  He said Downtown Crossing is ‚Äúfinally starting to take off‚Äù and the dispensary ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt send the right message.‚Äù  Kristen Mansharamani, who owns Torit Montessori School, said her school is just outside the 500-foot zone that must separate dispensaries from educational facilities. She said that residents and business owners had fought to eliminate the Combat Zone and its unsavory elements from Downtown Crossing, and they view the potential arrival of a medical marijuana dispensary as a throwback.  Boston police Deputy Superintendent Bernard O‚ÄôRourke said at the meeting the police department opposes the location. He said he foresees problems with on-street drug dealing and the ‚Äúgreat unknownness‚Äù of the location.  Ross said Patriot Care spoke with Boston police and plans to hire off-duty officers to help with security. Ross also said the dispensary will never shift to selling marijuana for recreational use, even if Massachusetts voters approve such sales.  The Midtown Cultural District Residents‚Äô Association conducted a survey of residents and found that of the 86 who responded, 59 percent were against the dispensary.  Rishi Shukla, a leader of the association, said he was concerned that a dispensary would exacerbate parking woes in the neighborhood. The company estimates 100 people will use the facility each day and does not foresee a problem with street parking.  Councilor Josh Zakim, whose father, Leonard P. Zakim , died of cancer in 1999, said he was troubled medical marijuana is still not available in the city, despite being approved by voters in 2012.  ‚ÄúMy father was suffering from something that turned out to be terminal cancer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHaving something like this available, legal, safe, clean, and accessible on the T, and by car, in a central location like this would have made a huge difference.‚Äù ~~"

Nope, DL has a blue background and dph requires white/off white background. Yay. So I uploaded another and it took 3 more weeks for the temp to show up. This was several months ago and during that time dph went from saying 2-3 weeks for a temp when I first applied to ""at least 4 weeks"" when I called after the first 3 weeks. I got the rejection 34 days after applying.  Pay close attention to their pic sizing guidelines too cuz I know someone who got rejected over that about 2 weeks ago.

I tried uploading it three times but the thumbnail still showed the rejected pic. I submitted anyway, hoping it was just a site/browser error.

After like the seventh try I said fuck it and submitted with the license pic, then found this thread a few hours later and got nervous. So today I called the customer service number on the ""We'll get to your application whenever the fuck we feel like it"" page, explained that I didn't want to wait a month to get rejected for a bad pic and asked if they'd just go in the system and reject my application today so I could try again.

Did I have a right to refuse a search? Of course I did. He also had a right to make me dump my medicine and fine me several hundred dollars. By both of us being polite, understanding and respectful we both left the situation with a great taste in our mouths (do to speak). And not only respectful of each other, but of the processes that we have to follow.   I intend no offense, but your comment made me think of a teenager. If everyone upheld the whole ""I know my rights and I'm sticking to them no matter what"" mentality we will not see progress in the amount of direction we all want to see. I am not a teenager. I'm a fairly responsible adult who is almost 30. I'm married, about to buy a house. I pay taxes. I vote. I am, in most ways, a positively contributing member of society.   I would love to be able to hold on to the hostility and angst about law enforcement but as I said in my original post, they are people too. He did not want to have to deal with me in a negative way and I did not want to deal with him in a negative way. By being respectful to each other, and lenient to each other, together we made one tiny ripple in the pond that will ultimately contribute to a changing of tides.   I am very happy with the small amount of progress made on the side of I-95.   Plus the fact that I made about $28 dollars during the whole ordeal. That helps too. :)"

If people didn't pay those prices they would come down but the younger generation, yes I'm waving my old fist in the air, never questioned or leveraged down the prices. Now they will go sky high with these dispensaries opening up, like a previous post said to $300 oz plus. If you smoke a half to an oz a week you will go broke.

bostontrees,3bkogj,JiggyJack,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:44:17 2015 UTC,What is your objection to the timeout?  The clock only starts when you are not drawing.  Most people say they turn it off between hits anyway given the sub-5 second re-heat time.  Just curious about your reason.

bostontrees,3bgyp1,based_peppep,4,Mon Jun 29 15:26:05 2015 UTC,"It's legal though so that seems excessive.  It's not uncommon for caregivers to have ""menus"" etc.  Even if a caregiver is acting outside the regulations, the patient can't get busted for that, the caregiver can, and even then it's likely to be a ""cease and desist"" order.  Some caregivers have been busted and so it has caused others to be more cautious.  My guess is that is what is happening in OP's situation, just caregiver paranoia because of the quasi-legal status.  And I'm aware the feds reserve the right to bust people anywhere in the US, but until they actually do that around here I'm not worried for the time being."
bostontrees,3bgyp1,jjjttt23,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:07:25 2015 UTC,It's still federally illegal. It's a shame how little people care about computer security. Signing a message with PGP so a savvy patient could verify who sent it isn't difficult.

I ended up downloading Leafly before he did to help research things for him. It feels like (especially in this area) delivery services pop up and disappear just as quick. That's why he chose someone who was based more metro Boston thinking he'd not be a fly by night type of thing. Dude had a long post history on the caregiver forum, Instagram for quite some time and then it figured that two orders later, he's gone. I'd imagine the sudden disappearing act happens often because of the ""system"" currently in place but that just makes things difficult.

bostontrees,3b13kz,indicagrrl,3,Thu Jun 25 16:50:57 2015 UTC,"Your right that is worth $7.  I was just hoping the ""official"" prices were going to be a lot cheaper.  The doctor I went to spoke of the dispensaries having $200-$250 oz. so I am a little disappointed that it ended up in line with what prices were to begin with.  The fact that they ran out of product in three days because the state royally screwed up the implementation of the whole system is another bummer.

bostontrees,3b025e,LMAOItsMatt,5,Thu Jun 25 11:05:43 2015 UTC,"SALEM ‚Äî Roughly two dozen patients were waiting in line when the doors opened for business at 10:40 a.m. Wednesday at Alternative Therapies Group, the first dispensary to sell marijuana for medical use in Massachusetts. Patient number one was a gray-haired man with a walker.  Nearly three years after voters approved medical marijuana, access to the Salem dispensary in a converted brick factory building was by appointment only. A police officer stood by the building‚Äôs entrance, and a private security guard checked off patients‚Äô names from a clipboard as they waited in line under crystal blue skies.  ‚ÄúWe fought a long time for this,‚Äù said Peter Hayashi, a 59-year-old disabled neuropsychologist.  Hayashi, who said he suffers from a neurological condition that makes it painful at times to feel cold air on his skin, said he has been getting marijuana from a Maine dispensary to ease his symptoms. Without marijuana, he said, he has often resorted to spending hours in bed with covers over his skin to protect against painful temperature changes.  ‚ÄúMarijuana has helped me be up and around more normally,‚Äù he said.  Also waiting in line was 53-year-old Wendy Atwood, who said she has long used marijuana to ease knee pain from arthritis, depression, and anxiety.  ‚ÄúI am a law-abiding citizen, a mom with two kids, and a day-care provider,‚Äù Atwood said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be very exciting to walk into the store,‚Äù Atwood added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy that it‚Äôs not under wraps anymore.‚Äù  More than 18,000 patients have the required physician certifications to legally use marijuana for medicinal purposes in Massachusetts, according to state records, and about half have completed registration with the state to shop in dispensaries.  Fourteen other dispensaries from Northampton to Boston have received preliminary state approval and are finalizing plans to open. At least two of those are expected to open this fall.  The executive director of the trade association representing dispensaries issued a statement saying the industry welcomes the opening of the first dispensary, but raising concerns that the state‚Äôs testing standards for medical marijuana are too stringent.  ‚ÄúMassachusetts has the most conservative testing limits in the country,‚Äù Kevin Gilnack, executive director of the Commonwealth Dispensary Association.  Alternative Therapies was able to open after receiving a temporary waiver last week from the state that allows it to sell cannabis that has not been fully tested for pesticides and other contaminants.  The one-time waiver was granted because laboratories in Massachusetts are not yet able to complete the quality testing required by state health department rules, Governor Charlie Baker‚Äôs office said last week.  But chemists at two labs poised to test dispensary products said last week the problem isn‚Äôt operations at the labs. The problem, they said, resides with the state‚Äôs guidelines, issued just six weeks ago, that set standards that are too stringent for lead.  The trade association said in its statement that the state made an errant assumption about how much marijuana patients might consume.  ‚ÄúA survey of available data showed that the heaviest users consume about 2 to 3 grams of cannabis per day,‚Äù Gilnack said in the statement. ‚ÄúConnecticut assumed a patient might consume 2.33 grams per day while Nevada assumed a patient might consume 5 grams in a day, yet [the Massachusetts Department of Public Health] based our testing limits on the assumption a patient could consume 28 grams -- about six to 12 times more than what we‚Äôre seeing in other states.‚Äù"

bostontrees,3b025e,FuuurSuuure,3,Wed Jun 24 22:03:57 2015 UTC,So who has been and what was it like?  I have an appointment on Friday but a post somewhere else makes it sound pretty expensive and limited in options.
bostontrees,3b025e,Boss_NOML,2,Thu Jun 25 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"Just got back from my appointment at 10:30.   Pretty simple, waited outside while a security guard took our names and had to wait 10 min for them to open.   Let people in one by one. Once I got in, there was a window and a door. Gave them my MMJ card and my ID. Got buzzed through after the guy typed in some numbers. Went through the metal detector in the next room and went through the other door.   A nice lady greeted me and gave me a packet with three forms to fill with a LOT of literature about marijuana, drug abuse, strains, methods of how to take your medicine, and the rules of the dispensary.  I sat down filled out the forms as we waited for all the other patients to sit down to watch at 5-10 min video. Talking about how marijuana can help relieve symptoms of various illnesses and the regulations for the dispensary. They then informed us pretty forcefully that there is NO smoking allowed on the premises or in the parking lot. They will call the cops if they find out you are smoking. Totally reasonable. Wouldn't want to cause trouble as they are the first place in MA to legally sell marijuana medically.  After all that was done they called two names to come up to the desks so they could get your card information and general information about you. If you are under 21 but over 18 you should have no problem. In their rules it says no one under 21 is allowed in but they let me in no problem. I then was told to wait in line for the pharmacy window and once I was up at the window I got my medication, paid for it, and left. Simple as that.  Currently they only have two strains. White Rhino and Serious  Happiness. I got an eighth of each. Total cost me $94.00. Used to paying that much. High quality. Worth it IMO.  It's $47 for an eighth, $94 for 1/4th. I think it was $188 for 1/2, and $370 for an oz? Can't remember."

bostontrees,3az1vy,jeffiethepirate,4,Wed Jun 24 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"Went through it.  Got 1/4 of each of the 2 strains (sight unseen) and it cost me $186.  I got in the car and opened it. Some of the best looking and smelling buds I've ever had. Right after work I'll be trying it.   I'm a weed snob, no way around that.   I value terps and smell and flavor quite a bit. I only vape and I use some VERY efficient vapes.  For me going by looks and smell I'd say I'd pay again.  I vape all day and still use less bud than someone who smokes a joint or 2 a day by far.    Lots of hassles for day one but I'm happy to have a source of guaranteed top shelf quality even if it is expensive."
bostontrees,3az1vy,LED_oneshot,3,Wed Jun 24 18:19:25 2015 UTC,Sight unseen? Can't believe they actually are doing that.
bostontrees,3az1vy,LED_oneshot,2,Wed Jun 24 18:44:46 2015 UTC,I was VERY surprised about that myself.  Luckily it turned out to be very high quality and I don't think anyone would turn it down.  I'm a bit of a weed snob :/ but I'm very happy!  I'll come check you out of course buddy when you guys open I'll be there!
bostontrees,3az1vy,LED_oneshot,2,Wed Jun 24 19:02:08 2015 UTC,What were the test results?
bostontrees,3az1vy,LED_oneshot,3,Wed Jun 24 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"Both were 16% thc 16.xx and the CBD was under 1% in each I believe.  The bud looks MUCH better than other buds that have supposedly tested higher.  I'll give it the good test, my vapes :)"
bostontrees,3az1vy,scriptmonkey420,5,Wed Jun 24 19:21:03 2015 UTC,No it's not
bostontrees,3az1vy,LED_oneshot,2,Wed Jun 24 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"Samples can be displayed but have to be behind lock and key. Patients are allowed to look/smell. There isn't anything from the state restricting that. It is up to the dispensary themselves how they operate. Salem is clearly going to the ""pharmacy style"" route while mostly everyone else is doing the typical retail style dispensary setup.    http://www.netacare.org/ they have lots of display as well."
bostontrees,3az1vy,Miz_pizzyizz,2,Wed Jun 24 23:33:37 2015 UTC,I'd agree its more pharmacy than retail store vibe.
bostontrees,3az1vy,Miz_pizzyizz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:37:05 2015 UTC,Why are none opening up in the Worcester area? All are either on the boston side or Springfield...
bostontrees,3az1vy,Internet_Big-Timer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:45:29 2015 UTC,No idea
bostontrees,3az1vy,jeffiethepirate,0,Thu Jun 25 15:51:28 2015 UTC,Sorry but that way of doing business is absolute bullshit. You have to buy without seeing/smelling the product first for $380/oz??? No. Shame on the commonwealth and shame on those who are exploiting a massively screwed up situation to profit off of sick people.
bostontrees,3az1vy,jeffiethepirate,3,Tue Jun 30 13:11:12 2015 UTC,"You should be able to see it. 100% agree there.   Despite the cost being high I'm not sure $380 ounces are exactly exploiting people.  Again it's VERY high cost, but its paying for employees, the location, security, the large grow to have constant supply, and on top of all that the state has to get their cut.  I don't know the business details at all so its possible they are making a killing, but its also possible that they are not trying to screw anyone.  Lots of state involvement.  Remember cheaper caregivers have no overhead cost or any involvement with the state.  No taxes or fees etc."
bostontrees,3az1vy,jeffiethepirate,2,Tue Jun 30 20:06:29 2015 UTC,"Every business has start up costs, continuous operating costs, and specific expenses to their industry and I've considered those factors. I still think the pricing is incredibly out of line. Many of us here are lucky enough that we can afford these insane prices but there are a significant number of folks who are disabled and sick, some critically, who can't pay prices like this, not even for the smallest amount these people will sell. And a ""compassionate discount"" isn't a discount at all when you start at the top of the friggin' mountain. I voted for safe access not this bullshit and I hope things are very different when the next few shops open."
bostontrees,3az1vy,legendofsteve,4,Thu Jun 25 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"Daaaamn, that's pricey, but I guess expected since they're the only legit option for people that have been skeptical of going the caregiver route. I wonder if prices will come down as more dispensaries open (hope so). Salem is already over an hour drive for me, so I can't say I'm as excited to go check it out now, especially if I have to spend that much extra time doing orientation and watching videos."
bostontrees,3az1vy,Internet_Big-Timer,5,Thu Jun 25 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"For an hour drive I'd wait 2-3 weeks if you can, just so you can get more strains.  If I were in your shoes I'd want 8th of multiple strains so I could find out what I wanted."
bostontrees,3az1vy,considertheinfinite,3,Thu Jun 25 21:42:28 2015 UTC,"IF you were in my shoes, youd probably have extra room, theyre size 14 EE"
bostontrees,3az1vy,jeffiethepirate,4,Wed Jun 24 18:22:02 2015 UTC,Maybe I like to wear those skeeter valentine clown shoes?
bostontrees,3az1vy,twiztedice,3,Wed Jun 24 18:33:46 2015 UTC,You know what they say about guys with big  shoes?  Big socks
bostontrees,3az1vy,twiztedice,3,Wed Jun 24 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"You know what they say about big socks?  Big toes!  Truth be told I do happen to wear 1980s-esque skateboarding ""high-top"" socks lol.  I can pull my socks half way up my shins if I want.  Fuck trends haha."
bostontrees,3az1vy,twiztedice,3,Wed Jun 24 19:02:32 2015 UTC,"Nice man, Im an ankle sock kinda guy, and i have fucking Fred Flinstone toesies, like regular little toes, but my big toe is like FUCK YOU IM A TOE. Seriously id probably be more like a size 12 if i lost that thing"
bostontrees,3az1vy,JiggyJack,5,Wed Jun 24 19:05:23 2015 UTC,Toe tuck surgery is the new nosejob.
bostontrees,3az1vy,considertheinfinite,4,Wed Jun 24 19:06:21 2015 UTC,This was an interesting conversation.
bostontrees,3az1vy,jeffiethepirate,2,Wed Jun 24 19:12:26 2015 UTC,That's the new plan. Thanks again man!
bostontrees,3az1vy,LED_oneshot,3,Wed Jun 24 19:21:21 2015 UTC,"No problem at all.  Glad I helped save you a trip.  Don't get me wrong, those people were awesome, but because of the testing stuff its not worth it for you YET when you can get like 300% more options and less hassle if you wait a few weeks."
bostontrees,3az1vy,LED_oneshot,3,Thu Jun 25 16:12:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Doesn't seem much more expensive than what I've been seeing on Leafly. The lack of variety is disappointing but I'm sure that'll be solved with time. I hope my temp card arrives soon so I can check it out for myself.
bostontrees,3az1vy,considertheinfinite,5,Wed Jun 24 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"You can use leafly, or the links on the sidebar to find new caregivers, but 380 for an ounce is Wiggedy wack"
bostontrees,3az1vy,justinxduff,6,Wed Jun 24 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"Its pretty high.  The way I see it is no caregiver has a BUILDING I can go to yet.  Thats overhead cost etc.  So far its been a huge hassle mainly with reliability from caregivers.  I don't see much quality like this around either.  Plus I'm sure the state is getting their cut.  I get WHY its more expensive, but if I was smoking joints and blunts I'd be pretty sad to pay almost double what I pay on the street.  Because I vape 1/10th of a gram or less at a time, I don't care AS MUCH as someone who was smoking a gram in 5 minutes."
bostontrees,3az1vy,HMG-CoAReductase,3,Wed Jun 24 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"im currently looking into vaping buds and was curious where to start, im sure i could google this but is there a site or subreddit i could check out?"
bostontrees,3az1vy,otallday,3,Wed Jun 24 18:33:09 2015 UTC,Fuckcombustion.com is the best place.  Would you want a portable or desktop vape?
bostontrees,3az1vy,HMG-CoAReductase,2,Wed Jun 24 19:05:04 2015 UTC,definitely would want a portable vape
bostontrees,3az1vy,otallday,4,Wed Jun 24 19:23:47 2015 UTC,"Check out the firefly, the pax 2, and the mighty.  Those are 3 good high quality portables each with their pros and cons.  There's others out there.  My favorite is the firefly.  It's got a huge learning curve compared to some, but its not too bad.  The mighty is a powerful long lasting vape that will get over 10 bowls per charge."
bostontrees,3az1vy,JiggyJack,2,Wed Jun 24 19:40:58 2015 UTC,sweet thanks ill check those out :D
bostontrees,3az1vy,jeffiethepirate,2,Wed Jun 24 19:45:11 2015 UTC,Look into the Grasshopper too.
bostontrees,3az1vy,JiggyJack,2,Wed Jun 24 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"If you aren't in a rush and don't mind waiting, possibly forever, to get the thing.  I'd definitely not want to be an early adopter after they struggled so hard to even start production.  Might be good but doesn't seem like a good idea to jump to early."
bostontrees,3az1vy,FuuurSuuure,3,Wed Jun 24 20:16:21 2015 UTC,I bought a Pax 2 a week ago - my first vaporizer - and I absolutely love it.
bostontrees,3az1vy,otallday,2,Thu Jun 25 02:22:35 2015 UTC,The lack of variety is expected to last 3 weeks.  It's because they can't test for all the pesticides yet at the labs.
bostontrees,3az1vy,otallday,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:54:19 2015 UTC,Can you take pics of the packaging they use?  Oddly interested.
bostontrees,3az1vy,doubtitslegit25,4,Wed Jun 24 20:48:06 2015 UTC,"Here is a 2 picture album.  One of the packaging with some info blacked out, and the other is a quick shot of the serious happiness.  I have the worst camera ever, so it is what it is lol.  http://imgur.com/a/lMnTL"
bostontrees,3ay1f5,konsickwence,7,Wed Jun 24 12:27:46 2015 UTC,"Be careful, Smoking in City Parks can get you a citation."
bostontrees,3ay1f5,jeffiethepirate,6,Wed Jun 24 13:03:58 2015 UTC,I once got caught by a cop smoking in the gardens...he just told us to get the fuck out of there and don't smoke here again. I love this city.
bostontrees,3ay1f5,ziggygersh,4,Wed Jun 24 13:44:34 2015 UTC,"I think on my next day off I'm going to take my Pax to the Arboretum. I haven't smoked outside in like ten years, and never in Boston."
bostontrees,3ay1f5,considertheinfinite,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:23:15 2015 UTC,If you haven't smoked/vaped outside in years what was the motivation to get a pax in the first place?
bostontrees,3ay1f5,darkrom,2,Thu Jun 25 15:50:22 2015 UTC,so I could start :p (and mild health concerns)  I just got it last week - first vaporizer.
bostontrees,3ay1f5,considertheinfinite,2,Thu Jun 25 16:00:04 2015 UTC,"Oh haha.  Gotcha.  Yeah vaping is the way to go.  I don't care if my friends want to smoke etc, but I turn down free joints and bong rips etc.  Just not appealing to me at all.  No flavor in smoke, burning more than half of the actives, less healthy, AND it costs more.  I'm definitely not going back.  Dabs and vapes for me personally."
bostontrees,3ay1f5,darkrom,2,Thu Jun 25 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"Was in Boston for the Parade two weeks ago and smoked a J on the common for the first time, was awesome."
bostontrees,3avbgw,captaindoctorchef,5,Tue Jun 23 20:10:44 2015 UTC,"I went to MMJ Physicians in Salem, MA 2 weeks ago on Saturday and was in and out in just over 1 hour. You will meet with the receptionist first to go over your basic info and ailments after which you will discuss how medicinal marijuana could help your ailments. After you finish the forms you will meet with the doctor. For me it was a quick physical check and then some in depth discussion about how medicinal marijuana could help alleviate my ailments. I ended up being approved for lower lumbar pain, anxiety/ADD and carpal tunnel. It will cost you $200 for the visit (regardless of approval) and $50 to register with the MA DPH.  http://mmjphysicianpractice.net/"
bostontrees,3avbgw,justinxduff,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:16:03 2015 UTC,how much does pot go for at MA dispensaries?
bostontrees,3avbgw,wikifreaks,2,Tue Jun 23 21:17:25 2015 UTC,It depends on the dispensary. ATG in Salem is saying it should be around $15/g.
bostontrees,3avbgw,justinxduff,0,Tue Jun 23 21:20:13 2015 UTC,thats expensive
bostontrees,3avbgw,wikifreaks,7,Tue Jun 23 21:21:15 2015 UTC,Seems pretty average to me.
bostontrees,3avbgw,justinxduff,3,Tue Jun 23 21:24:58 2015 UTC,It'll go down once they have some competition I bet
bostontrees,3avbgw,KageG213,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:01:41 2015 UTC,"Or even just supply. Things are tight right now- they're probably selling at a price that can sustain them. Also remember this is supposed to be medical grade weed. Not just whatever your deal ""has"". I doubt many people know exactly what strain they have with exactly what levels of thc/cbd."
bostontrees,3avbgw,Yeats,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:00:10 2015 UTC,So how seriously do they question/examine you? Can I tell them I have bad eyes/eye strain and a nagging shoulder problem that I can't afford surgery for? I'm afraid to waste $200 for an appointment.
bostontrees,3avbgw,08livion,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:32:51 2015 UTC,"The doctor I saw wasn't an idiot let's just put it that way. I can tell you that when I brought up carpal tunnel, which I do have, he specifically asked which part of the hands, wrists and fingers it bothers me most and since carpal tunnel only affects specifics parts you can't BS through it. Please don't BS your way through this, this is a legitimate source of medicine for most people that go."
bostontrees,3avbgw,justinxduff,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:38:23 2015 UTC,I would love to hear more responses than just u/justinxduff but thanks for your input!
bostontrees,3avbgw,funnyhowthings,2,Wed Jun 24 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"That just about covered it. My experience was very similar.  I went to a Canna Care Docs office, which is a walk-in clinic (no appointments). I filled out a clipboard of medical information, just like at a traditional medical practice. The website suggests printing the medical history pages ahead of time and bringing them in, so that saved me some time. The receptionist took a copy of my ID and ran my credit card.  The first part of the appointment was a counseling session, in which a guy took my blood pressure and went through a basic packet of information about marijuana. He talked about types, methods of ingestion, etc. Nothing groundbreaking.   Next, I went to another office and spoke with a nurse practitioner. He looked over my paperwork, asked me a little bit about my medical diagnosis, and then signed the recommendation form and wished me luck.  I went back out to see the receptionist, who explained the process of registering with DPH and verified that all my information was correct. She gave me a print-out with my PIN and step-by-step instructions.  The whole thing took maybe 45 minutes.  After that, I went home and opened the DPH email, which was automatically sent as soon as the receptionist at the clinic started the registration process. The process was easy. I uploaded a scan of my ID, and my photo came up automatically from the RMV records. I was charged $50 and got a confirmation email.    After that, it's just waiting. The temporary card, which can be printed out, will be ready as soon as the application is processed (3-4 weeks?), then the plastic card comes in the mail later."
bostontrees,3avbgw,Pizzabagelpizza,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:17:01 2015 UTC,"Went to CannaCare, had my blood pressure taken and was talked to about various strains and the law, then talked to the doctor for five minutes before receiving my recommendation. Easy as that - however, nearly 4 weeks later and I'm still waiting for my temp card."
bostontrees,3aqiyx,darkrom,4,Mon Jun 22 18:15:10 2015 UTC,Got my appointment confirmed.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,jeffiethepirate,5,Mon Jun 22 21:03:38 2015 UTC,You know this means youre about to be one of the first dispensary patients in MA
bostontrees,3aqiyx,indicagrrl,5,Mon Jun 22 22:43:09 2015 UTC,Indeed. Opening day in fact :) I had my medical card in January when it was first possible.  I'm an eager beaver.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,indicagrrl,2,Tue Jun 23 01:28:34 2015 UTC,When is your appointment?  Is it soon?
bostontrees,3aqiyx,indicagrrl,3,Mon Jun 22 23:15:04 2015 UTC,24th. I'll post a review here.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,indicagrrl,2,Tue Jun 23 01:28:50 2015 UTC,That's awesome!    You will be one of the first :)
bostontrees,3aqiyx,JiggyJack,3,Tue Jun 23 18:53:40 2015 UTC,Pretty excited.  I got to do the whole dispensary experience back in Maine a while ago.  It was interesting (but expensive).
bostontrees,3aqiyx,indicagrrl,2,Tue Jun 23 19:33:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've been going up every month or two.  It is not cheap but I get baker's mix or small flowers and make oil.  That is what I use for my medicine then I grab a couple of grams for pleasure vaping.  They have specials,  2 baker's mix for $120-ish, not bad."
bostontrees,3aqiyx,LED_oneshot,2,Tue Jun 23 20:39:59 2015 UTC,I finally got my email and I have an appointment the 24th too!  I'm beyond excited.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,jeffiethepirate,2,Tue Jun 23 22:54:58 2015 UTC,How did it go for you?  I go on Friday.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,justinxduff,2,Thu Jun 25 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"It wasn't bad.  They were running a bit late because it was their first day of operation but besides that it was fairly straightforward.   I showed my id to the security guard outside the door, showed two ids inside the door (DPH and id used for DPH, in my case my license), get buzzed into a security checkpoint with a metal detector then you walk into the facility.  The place isn't fancy.  It is a big room with chairs where you watch a video and wait to meet with someone.  I met with a guy who took my name and order.  I think I got the jerk but everyone else including the security guard seemed nice. They had two strains and I chose an 8th of each.  After you order at the desk you walk over to the pharmacy, pay and pick up your Rx.  They deduct the amount you purchase from your limit in the computer.  I believe the state tracks the amounts.  You show your ids at the desk where you order and again at the pharmacy (yes, four times) when you pick up your meds.    All in all it was okay.  I'm glad I'm in.  They are no longer making appointments until further notice.  I can't wait until they have more strains, I read eight plus but I heard a member of the staff say ""lots and lots of strains"".  Fx.    I got Serious Happiness and White Rhino.  I love the White Rhino.  I moaned a little when I tasted it.  Yummy."
bostontrees,3aqiyx,indicagrrl,2,Thu Jun 25 06:12:24 2015 UTC,Did they give you a time on how long your visit will take?
bostontrees,3aqiyx,justinxduff,3,Wed Jun 24 01:35:45 2015 UTC,I read something about 10-20 minute orientation type thing. Had a similar experience at the Portland dispensary.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,indicagrrl,3,Wed Jun 24 02:05:51 2015 UTC,Just got my email. let me know how it goes!
bostontrees,3aqiyx,justinxduff,3,Mon Jun 22 19:02:01 2015 UTC,Waiting for my email!
bostontrees,3aqiyx,indicagrrl,2,Mon Jun 22 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"Did it come?   I have been on the mailing list forever :/  no word yet,  though."
bostontrees,3aqiyx,considertheinfinite,2,Mon Jun 22 23:14:36 2015 UTC,Nothing yet myself either. I am still waiting on my card to come in the mail anyways so I am in no rush.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,Boss_NOML,2,Mon Jun 22 23:56:35 2015 UTC,I am!  I'm in a rush!
bostontrees,3aqiyx,considertheinfinite,3,Tue Jun 23 00:26:50 2015 UTC,A rush for some kush?
bostontrees,3aqiyx,LED_oneshot,3,Tue Jun 23 12:37:58 2015 UTC,Hecks yeah!
bostontrees,3aqiyx,Boss_NOML,2,Tue Jun 23 19:04:23 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. How long have you been waiting? I'm just over two weeks out now.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,JiggyJack,2,Tue Jun 23 15:50:43 2015 UTC,"It took me three weeks to get my temporary card emailed, then another 2 for the plastic card to show up in the mail."
bostontrees,3aqiyx,justinxduff,2,Tue Jun 23 15:59:53 2015 UTC,Do you know if ATG will accept a temporary card? Mine should be coming next week if there's still a three week turnaround.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,considertheinfinite,3,Tue Jun 23 16:22:23 2015 UTC,Temporary card is 100% able to be used.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,Boss_NOML,2,Tue Jun 23 22:29:15 2015 UTC,I don't see why they wouldn't. It has an official DPH registration number they would be able to look up.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,indicagrrl,2,Tue Jun 23 18:10:24 2015 UTC,Same time frames for me.
bostontrees,3aqiyx,considertheinfinite,2,Thu Jun 25 02:41:46 2015 UTC,2 weeks as of this last Saturday so it seems about 1 more week for my temp. You can always log into the DPH website with your account to check the status as well.
bostontrees,3alpzg,Pizzabagelpizza,3,Sun Jun 21 13:22:03 2015 UTC,"I just connected with a delivery service for the first time yesterday.  Found them on Leafly, on recommendation for someone else on reddit.  Worked out great for me.  They have top quality, great prices, really nice people.  I live in western mass., so had to meet him, but they come to the door in eastern mass.  I called the number, sent a scan of my MM card and license.  They called to say they received them, told me to look over the menu and call back with an order.  Next day service.  Cash only.  Totally safe, in my opinion.  I would feel safe inviting the driver inside.  He was an older guy in his 50's, not a kid.  I didn't tip--never occurred to me.  A great experience overall.  If you want the details of my delivery service, feel free to PM me."
bostontrees,3alpzg,raindog67,3,Sun Jun 21 14:04:19 2015 UTC,"+1 to everything said here already. Honestly the best advice I got was to just treat them like an employee from a traditional prescription delivery service. I usually invite them inside my apartment into the living room for some privacy while they check my card and count the money.   I usually place larger orders less frequently as I live out west and don't have a car, so I always tip at least $20 because who knows if these guys are even getting paid mileage for using their personal vehicle, and even if they are - I've been there and it pays for your oil changes if you're lucky.   FWIW I really like Caregivers United. Nicest dudes you'll ever meet and the product is top notch."
bostontrees,3alpzg,based_peppep,2,Tue Jun 23 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"I used Leafly for same day delivery. I tipped, which the driver definitely appreciated but did not seem to expect. He didn't come up to my apartment, but he did ask to go inside the vestibule rather than making the exchange outside. No complaints here."
bostontrees,3alpzg,considertheinfinite,2,Sun Jun 21 15:21:33 2015 UTC,Leafly is a good site thats what i use. i always invite them in and always tip at least a couple bucks. Hope this helps.
bostontrees,3alpzg,DctrKevorkian,2,Sun Jun 21 16:18:31 2015 UTC,Can you tell me a little bit more about what happens when you invite them in?
bostontrees,3alpzg,DctrKevorkian,3,Sun Jun 21 16:28:35 2015 UTC,"Normally they just ask you to check if everything's there, take the money and go."
bostontrees,3alpzg,member_member5thNov,3,Sun Jun 21 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"You make awkward conversation (or sometimes not awkward at all conversation), offer them water or a drink which the almost always refuse, make a financial transaction and they go on their way to the next patient.   Old school delivery drug dealers you used to have to decide if you were going to smoke them up but generally caregivers are on a more professional schedule and have places to be.   You can still offer if you like. Or not.   First time they usually need to inspect your paperwork and ID.  Other than that it isn't a lot more complicated or fraught a social interaction than getting food delivered.   I usually ask them to double check my cash count right then just so they don't have to come back if I fucked up.  Be polite and prompt."

bostontrees,3ae5fi,Altaira99,9,Fri Jun 19 11:33:19 2015 UTC,Since all dispensaries must grow their own product at least within a given dispensary it will be much more likely to be consistent.   Personally I'm always a little sceptical of the name brand claim unless it comes out of a labelled bin in a dispensary or coffeeshop.  It is worth remembering though that almost every strain is a hybrid and there can be quite  a bit of variation within even a pretty stable strain.  Two seeds from the exact same plant can grow up with a good bit of variation within them.
bostontrees,3ae5fi,member_member5thNov,4,Fri Jun 19 12:17:20 2015 UTC,This happens because there are different phenotypes when growing from seed. A clone will be just like its parent exactly the same. But when grown from seed traits from each parent can differ including looks taste smell THC level. Example would be you have Blue Dream. Which is Blueberry crossed with silver haze I think.  Each Blue Dream seed you grow will be similar but have different traits from each parent. This is why growers pheno hunt tell they find the perfect plant with the best traits to use as a mother to clone out. I hope I explained this well. I'm not a very good writer. I
bostontrees,3ae5fi,BDH420,2,Sat Jun 20 21:29:14 2015 UTC,"You explained it very well, and you write just fine.  I knew about hybrids from seed, since I grow flowers. The other kind.  My question was really about professionalism, I think.  I mean, why are they growing from seed?"

bostontrees,3abf67,EDante,5,Fri Jun 19 15:51:17 2015 UTC,I think it'll pass if it comes to a ballot initiative but those numbers seem hopeful.   Selection bias probably has a large effect on numbers like the ones from that site (or any site that isn't doing a representative poll).

bostontrees,39y973,no-mad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"Lets be real, you can't be arrested for being poor, you can be targeted for being poor unfairly.  If you are poor and want to be targeted less do your best to look like a regular person, don't drive around in a car with missing tail lights etc.  At that point you are being pulled over BECAUSE you are doing something wrong, not because you are poor.  If they search a buick because its a buick thats old and cheap, thats targeting.  If they search your buick because you have bald tires showing cords, bulbs out, cracked glass etc, then they are stopping you because you are giving them a cause to.  My whole point was if you look like an upstanding driver, they are less likely to pull you over."
bostontrees,39y973,darkrom,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:10:12 2015 UTC,Homeless people might disagree with you.   If you are poor a cracked headlight can be a serious burden. Might have to drive around like till Friday and constantly stress about it. Even with payday cant afford to buy a new one and have a mechanic put it in like regular people. Got to go to the junkyard. Better make sure they give you the right part. You do the work at night or on your day off. If you get a ticket for the busted taillight. You cant afford take to take off from work and fight it. I used to help feed the homeless when I was younger. Many people live on the edge of financial collapse. A $150 for a new taillight is a lot of money for some people.   A wealthy person fixes it because they are personally embarrassed to be driving around in something that even remotely seems funky. Two different realities. Poor people understand they will be targeted if they drive around in a crappy vehicle. Drug dealers also understand this and drive around in clean cars.
bostontrees,39y973,no-mad,2,Thu Jun 18 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"I get it man.  I've been there.  Junk yard parts for my $600 civic hatchback.  Junkyard parts for my taurus.  It sucks ass, but people need to know its the reality.  My point isn't ""just make more money"" obviously its not that easy.  My point is that if you can't afford that tail light until payday, understand that you are WAY more at risk and try not to carry bud on you.  If you have to, just know the risks.    I've been poor and it sucked.  Now I'm not poor, but I'm FAR from wealthy.  I was just passing on my experience that when I had a shitter for a car I got pulled over all the time, and had to act accordingly.  Better job hiding the stash, only bringing what I ABSOLUTELY needed etc.  Now that I have a decent car I get pulled over way less (almost never) and have my MMJ anyway so I don't have to worry.  Its not fair but its the reality.     As far as drug dealers driving clean cars I've had drug dealers using cars that would NEVER pass inspection, and other dealers have used an AMG Mercedes.  Contrary to popular belief drug dealers aren't ""rich"".  I know a guy who sells all day every day and he makes $700 a week.  Hes doing more work dealing to make that $700 than the guys working 9-5 to make the same cash.  Then of course theres the real bigger guys either moving TONS of weed, or hard drugs.  Those are really the only people making significant cash.  You can't sell a bag or 2 a day and make the same $ you would at a real job, its got to be at LEAST as much work and probably more hours to make a living selling weed.  And with the trend in prices dropping ($300 an oz is the super high end IMO now) they will be making less and less.  Especially with the competition growing rapidly.  Its a much shittier market than most people realize.  It makes me glad to be a patient not a dealer."

bostontrees,39y973,NIGHTFALIS,2,Thu Jun 18 16:40:23 2015 UTC,This is not true. Where is the proof of this? I know we have wiretapping laws that a person can't be audio recorded without being AWARE of it. You don't need their permission though they just need to know its happening. A camera pointed at them is pretty telling. I never said film secretly.   Also police may saying it is illegal or tell you to turn it off but they don't have that authority. Unfortunately there is no law preventing then from lying. So don't get in a debate with them. Best thing to do is not answer their questions.

You want them to know they're being recorded. They'll act a lot more polite that way and if they don't like it they can leave you alone. I'm glad your bringing it up because in MA we do have wiretapping laws but its important to understand how they work and what's allowed it and what isn't so your not being taken advantage of.

Put some Dryer sheets in there, and if you want a sock over the end to contain, and just blow your smoke out that.  Or spend like 20 bucks and buy a smoke buddy, but the sploofs work just as good"
bostontrees,39ct58,jeffiethepirate,4,Wed Jun 10 23:38:48 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought of that. My friend used to do this in his dorm. Not a bad idea. Thank you.

bostontrees,39ct58,jjjttt23,3,Thu Jun 11 02:48:24 2015 UTC,Take snaps though. I lived next to my RA this year at school. The sploof wasn't nearly as effective because of the smoke coming off the bowl was still enough to smell a hit.

bostontrees,39ct58,member_member5thNov,2,Thu Jun 11 00:23:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry. Errl is the nickname for a specific looking concentrate. It was the only stuff I could find around that time.

bostontrees,39ct58,member_member5thNov,3,Thu Jun 11 00:37:14 2015 UTC,I love my volcano. Had it for four years and never had any kind of problem. Runs like a champ.   You can make strong as fuck edibles from the left overs.   Not very good for oil or concentrates though.
bostontrees,39ct58,member_member5thNov,3,Thu Jun 11 01:58:36 2015 UTC,Nah errrrrl is just a funny way to say oil haha.
bostontrees,39ct58,snortsnort,5,Thu Jun 11 09:57:44 2015 UTC,"My rule is always to smoke in the place where I know it'll be least likely to bother someone. That said, I am still able to vape in my apartment, with a fan blowing towards an open window! I just like to be nice, I find it awkward to knowingly keep bothering them, lol. And in my case yes they do have every right to evict me (the building is no-smoking). I was just glad they were nice and asked me first rather than going right to the landlord!  I have also found it tremendously easy to smoke outside in Boston. I'm sure it depends on the neighborhood, but I live in a fairly crowded area (Back Bay), and by staying out of people's way, I've had no problems. I smoke in the back alleyways, or on the Esplanade at night. In fact I just yesterday saw this guy straight up whip out a little bowl and start hitting it walking down one of the alleys haha."
bostontrees,39ct58,snortsnort,4,Thu Jun 11 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I didn't think I was bothering them. I've lived here for a year and they've been my neighbors ever since. They never uttered a single word about it, just like I ignore them fighting at 2am on a tuesday. I thought it was one of those things, you know?  The worst part of this whole thing was though, the woman came into my apartment while my wife and I were fucking. She just let herself in, came up stairs and told us we needed to knock it off with the weed. I don't want to raise an issue with the landlord or police or anything so I'm going to let it go, but it was uncalled for. She could have rung my doorbell first."
bostontrees,39ct58,kman418,9,Thu Jun 11 00:22:32 2015 UTC,That's definitely a violation of your right to quite enjoyment.  Once she entered your apartment without permission she lost all moral high ground.
bostontrees,39ct58,undercoverballer,4,Thu Jun 11 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, but like I said I don't want to raise a stink about it. She seemed pretty drunk when she came in, and she yells at her husband a lot so I wanted to avoid a shouting match. There is an old woman who lives in the building on the bottom floor, and I don't want to disturb her. She's the sweetest lady.   I really thought they smoked pot too, or their son does. Because I've smelled weed in the stairway on my way home from work several times. My wife doesn't smoke so it's not her. I betting she smelled him smoking (he's probably 19 or so) and he blamed the smell on me."
bostontrees,39ct58,undercoverballer,5,Thu Jun 11 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"Complain to the landlord not the neighbor I meant.   I'm sure you did the right thing in the moment. Shouting matches with drunk people who enter your home illegally are something to be avoided.  Her kid's definitely been blaming his stank on you folks though. ""Ma I swear it ain't me! It's those hippies upstairs!"" I guarantee it."
bostontrees,39ct58,maple_sizurp,3,Thu Jun 11 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"Wait, you're their upstairs neighbors? I mean, yeah it'll definitely travel into the hallway a bit, but if you're above her I would figure it would pretty much just rise before she could even smell it down there! Plus you said it's been two years no problem. I'm sure their son just started smoking recently (19 is when I started!), and has been blaming you on the smell. And she sounds like this lady has problems of her own...damn. As suggested before I'd tell the landlord about her drunkenly entering your apartment. It's kind of getting like more and more innocent on your side the more I piece it together, so I don't think you're really up for eviction."
bostontrees,39ct58,justinxduff,2,Thu Jun 11 10:16:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, I started smoking weed when I was 19 and I also lied to my parents about it. Thing is we lived in a single family house and my bro was away at camp, so I eventually just fessed up as they pushed. Turned out the didn't care as long as I wasn't driving around smoking in my car."
bostontrees,39ct58,gmasterrollie,3,Thu Jun 11 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"Damn! Weird lady. Well, I suppose despite everything, I figure even if there's nothing in the lease, unless you have medical, they may be able to evict you...."
bostontrees,39ct58,LED_oneshot,3,Thu Jun 11 01:21:57 2015 UTC,I would post up in the back of Baystate behind my ex's apartment and watch storow drive while hitting my 1 hitter on the communal bench for the building. Boston is cool with weed and if your not bothing people the police tend to not notice/look the other way
bostontrees,39ct58,pdeluc99,3,Thu Jun 11 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"I lived with not-so-420-friendly roommates and pulled off using my bong daily. I got this window fan, taped around it so no air leaked back in. Its great because you can choose to have air blow in, out, or one of each. I set the air to blowing out and just kept my bong right in front and aimed my exhale at the fan. When I was done, I switched the fan to exchange (one blowing in, one out) and it really clears out my room fast. Good luck :)"

bostontrees,39ct58,Tsunamiii,3,Fri Jun 12 00:15:13 2015 UTC,"Get yourself a 4in inline fan and carbon filter from any grow shop and run it in the room while you smoke. It'll set you back about 150, they're can be a little noisy but it will scrub all the smell."

bostontrees,39392x,LED_oneshot,2,Mon Jun 8 23:01:47 2015 UTC,"Very exciting stuff.  The comments the interviewer made on the pricing, while concerning, is to be expected with the current market.  Sounds like it'll range from $350-$500 for an oz depending on the quality.  Although I assume even the low end of the spectrum will be pretty high quality."
bostontrees,39392x,Rizzalso,3,Tue Jun 9 14:25:18 2015 UTC,There will be nothing over $400 oz. they were doing straight gram pricing. We will have price breaks. All of our products are going to be top notch.

bostontrees,38y3ou,FuuurSuuure,3,Sun Jun 7 22:00:52 2015 UTC,Yep
bostontrees,38y3ou,TaintShredder,2,Sun Jun 7 23:20:06 2015 UTC,A little off topic but can anyone explain how a caregiver is able to have more than one patient when the state law only allows for one? Is there a gray area?
bostontrees,38y3ou,FuuurSuuure,3,Mon Jun 8 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the law itself does not specify a limit to the number of patients a caregiver may have. The Department of Public Health has formally stated that there is a limit of 1 patient per caregiver. As caregivers may be violating the wishes of the DPH, they are not breaking any state law."
bostontrees,38y3ou,TaintShredder,2,Mon Jun 8 01:51:19 2015 UTC,Very interesting. Thank you! Any consequences for disobeying the DPH?
bostontrees,38y3ou,FuuurSuuure,2,Mon Jun 8 01:59:02 2015 UTC,Several cease and desists have been issued by the DPH. It seems like state and municipal police have no desire to enforce a measure they know is not related to law.

Then one day that guy couldnt make it so he sent another guy. Normally id be like, eh whatever.  I used to live in a small complex, but lots of apartments faced inwards towards the parking lot.   The new driver calls me up, and i tell him to ring my buzzer and come on in. He calls me back and asks me to come out to the car.  Okay, middle of the day, not too worried, checked out my window and recognized him from the original basement location.  I had assumed I would be getting into the car. I assumed wrong. guy pulls out a manila envelope with 4 quarter bags in it, and just dumps them on the trunk of his car. Right out in the open in my partking lot in the middle of the day.    On top of that, they screwed up the order.   Never again."

bostontrees,38sgva,Nerdybird92,6,Sat Jun 6 12:36:40 2015 UTC,"I went to Canna Care. You walk in, fill out some forms describing your conditions. If you're a resident then no medical records required. You give them $200 before you go in to get vitals taken. You then talk with the nurse about the laws and regulations and the healthiest ways to consume. Then you go in for an interview with the doctor. Mine was pretty short, and we talked about proper use and what strains would be good for my issues (migraines, anxiety, depression, and some stomach issues). He signed my recommendation and I got my DPH PIN and applied with the state. If the doctor denies you for whatever reason, they give you $150 of your payment back."
bostontrees,38sgva,bchambs915,3,Sat Jun 6 14:37:27 2015 UTC,What use is the card at the moment? I gear there aren't any dispensary's in MA yet. Are there alternate means to get weed legally with a card?

bostontrees,38sgva,member_member5thNov,4,Sat Jun 6 16:27:59 2015 UTC,Its a straightforward process. No one in this sub has ever reported being denied.
bostontrees,38sgva,justinxduff,4,Sat Jun 6 14:06:41 2015 UTC,"I literally just walked out of the office my certification. The doctor was great and really down to earth. We went through my syptoms and how medical marijuana could help  them. I ended uo being approved for anxiety, lower lombar pain and ADD.   I used MMJ physicians in Salem MA and was in and out just over an hour. The process includes filling out forms with the receptionist then meeting with the doctor for 30 min or so. They do a quick physical check and then complete the registration process right there with you. It will cost 250 for the visit and state certification and an additional 35 if you want them to register you while in the office.  Their site is: www.mmjphysicianpractice.net"
bostontrees,38sgva,TheIsletOfLangerhans,2,Sat Jun 6 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"They register you with the DPH on the spot? Man, I wish I'd known that before hitting up Cannamed. I've been waiting for my online application to get processed for weeks now..."
bostontrees,38sgva,justinxduff,2,Tue Jun 9 16:38:21 2015 UTC,They register you on the spot but you still have to wait the 2 weeks for processing. The 2 weeks applies to everyone AFAIK.

But it doesn't make sense you registered in April and are still waiting."
bostontrees,38sgva,jeffiethepirate,3,Fri Jun 12 03:30:53 2015 UTC,"Its super easy going and very relaxing. There are some directions on the sidebar as well.  Depending on where you live, you can find many doctors offices near you to get a mmj rec.  If you are a MA resident you do not need your medical records, just a state issued ID.  You go into whatever office it is and it works like any other doctors office.  You speak to an administrative person first to take you info and moneys and then you have an appointment with the doctor and discuss your medical needs.  Done."

I read something about needing to have records from a doctor before stating any medical problems you have and bring those to another doctor who can then decide if you get the card, and then after that you have to find a caregiver (but from what I'm seeing there's now dispenseries opening in the area)"
bostontrees,38sgva,jeffiethepirate,2,Sat Jun 6 17:55:24 2015 UTC,"I am going to stop by CannaCare tomorrow in hopes of getting approved for medical marijuana. I do have several symptoms that I do consider MMJ a legitimate relief for considering I currently self medicate and it does help quite a bit (insomnia, depression, some weird knee issue I've been dealing with for three years now), but I'm still anxious about them trying to call my bluff and sending me off MMJ-recommendation-free, especially because I haven't seen a doctor in a couple of years and don't even have a primary care physician in Mass. And should they give me a recommendation, since it doesn't seem like they register with the DPH on-site, do I have to be concerned that it won't be approved by the DPH when I go to submit my information?"

Understanding others reservations we implore everyone to tune in tonight and listen to Brianna and hear her side of the story.

They are a useless scam organization IMO. They talk a big game, but in reality they do virtually nothing besides combine sex appeal and weed to cash in and collect money. They masquerade as some kind of pro-cannabis activism group/charity yet charge $80 for a ""420nurses intern starter kit"" to become an OFFICIAL 420NURSES INTERN. Literally charging people to promote their shitty website. This ""Boston Baked"" girl might only be one person, but the concept as a whole depicts cannabis in a non-serious/tacky/otherwise negative light and does a serious disservice to people that are actually doing their best to make positive steps towards improving the current state of medical/recreational cannabis in the US."

Groups do have to make money, and they are selling products and a chance to be a part of their community. Lots of people get to feel sexy, or show off a side of themselves they enjoy, or just get to have fun doing what they do. No one is getting scammed, people fully know they have to pay to become an intern.   I mean to each their own, but there are a lot of models interested in combining their two lifestyles (or maybe more than two)  So if someones having fun and not hurting anyone else, why get bent out of shape?    On top of that, fresh weed is not using a 420 nurse to promote themselves, they are actually friends with each other and are promoting her on their show."

bostontrees,38n6yd,member_member5thNov,3,Fri Jun 5 14:42:51 2015 UTC,"No! I know it sounds weird, in my head I've just still been playing the game of whether it's worth it in terms of how close legalization is- and at this point it's inevitable, but I suppose for how long it may take, it's worth it to have a card.   I think I'm going to try again, maybe even this week! It was just easy to put off because of school and stuff haha. But I just graduated, so I guess I have some funemployment time now to do these things lol."
bostontrees,38n6yd,jeffiethepirate,3,Fri Jun 5 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"The closed the boston locations, but the card opens up options for you. On top of that, when we legalize in 2016, it will be several months if not years before we have wide spread rec dispensaries, so medical may be the best option even then"

bostontrees,38n6yd,maddprof,2,Fri Jun 5 15:29:47 2015 UTC,Important question: does yours include delivery?  I don't at all mind paying a little bit more to not have to drive to someone and make awkward conversation on their couch while shitty reality tv plays too loud on their TV. A $20 premium seems well worth it to me.  I know people in Vermont who think anything over $150-200 an Oz is ridiculous... Then I ask them how much they'd charge me to drive it to my apartment and they shut the fuck up.
bostontrees,38n6yd,member_member5thNov,3,Fri Jun 5 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"It does! (Well, actually, he charges $10 to deliver but it's worth it!)"

Guess I should renew my attempts to find a new source...  But those prices are pretty reasonable from what I can tell, for a state with a lack of competition (I'm from California)."
bostontrees,38n6yd,member_member5thNov,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:57:21 2015 UTC,The good news is that prices are much cheaper at neighboring states with medical infrastructure.  Vermont in particular is quite a lot cheaper. Possibly this means prices will fall in the future. Possibly not.  Boston area prices are more in line with NYC--especially for delivery services in both.
bostontrees,38n6yd,maddprof,3,Tue Jun 9 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, Vermont is much cheaper. I grew up there and still have friends and family there but it's quite a ride esp in winter so not always a viable option.  I guess I'm a bit ruined by living in areas where $200/oz for dispensary quality was high but ffs $300-400+/oz is exploitative and absolutely feckin insane. I don't begrudge anyone making a living but wtf good is safe access when you gotta get a second job or win the damn lottery. What's the choice? Have no quality of life from side effects of ""traditional"" medicine but a positive balance in the bank account or be a productive contributing person hoping to afford some ramen for dinner. Hell of a choice.  All apologies for the rant, extra bad rheumatologist appt today, and am totally disgusted with all the ""what can you do for me today"" people."
bostontrees,38n6yd,member_member5thNov,2,Wed Jun 10 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"Well most of the prices listed here are about what I'm paying now.   The problem I really have is that since I'm from California, not only is it more expensive here, but realistically, it was all but legal in name there. Now, my extremely limited choices is what is getting to me - especially when my current source is super flaky and will not deliver at all (due to lack of car ownership). And of course, being that I'm in my 30's, hanging around a college campus would be super creepy to try and find alternatives."

bostontrees,38n6yd,member_member5thNov,2,Tue Jun 9 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"Personally, given how new medical access is to MA, I'd rather not abuse the system for minor ailments. Especially, not at the current price to obtain one.   Back home, the ""medical ailments"" list was so unbelievably broad, it was just a thin smoke screen for recreational use. ""Doctors"" who could prescribe mmj were doing so at under $50/appointment.   I guess I should compare the medical ailment list to see how stringent it really is or if it's essentially become California equivalent early in the mmj lifecycle and the market saturation of doctors here in MA just hasn't reached the point to drive the cost down."
bostontrees,38n6yd,maddprof,2,Fri Jun 12 14:33:00 2015 UTC,"it's essentially become California equivalent early in the mmj lifecycle and the market saturation of doctors here in MA just hasn't reached the point to drive the cost down.   That's pretty much where we are.  And it isn't at all ""abusing the system"" if it is a helpful treatment with fewer negative side effects over available medication.   The acetaminophen in Tylenol is highly liver toxic if abused (or combined with even minor drinking) and is a common treatment for minor ailments for example. Cannabis is far and away the healthier choice of medical options available for many of things you'd pop a few Tylenol as treatment.   Most sleep aids are massively addicting--a high cost for a minor ailment. A few puffs when you wake up in the middle of the night would do you just as well without the risk.  Should you need a special card to do so? Nope, but here we are nearly a century into prohibition. Can you get a card for those ailments? Absolutely."
bostontrees,38n6yd,member_member5thNov,2,Fri Jun 12 14:49:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. I had no idea that MA mmj laws were so liberal in acceptable forms of ailments.   I guess a trip to canna care will be in order (once I have $200 to spare for the appointment)."
bostontrees,38n6yd,otallday,2,Fri Jun 12 16:35:11 2015 UTC,"Nothing was specified in the law as voted on so it isn't like there is an ""approved"" list.   No one on this sub has ever reported being denied but I guess that doesn't mean it hasn't ever happened.   And quite honestly most everyone has shit wrong with them. If you counted everyone who'd qualify for a prescription for an anti anxiety pill, painkiller, nausea or bowl disorder,  or sleep aid medication it's most of the adult population."

bostontrees,38icgr,Palindromer101,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:20:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, let the hatred flow through you."
bostontrees,38icgr,member_member5thNov,8,Thu Jun 4 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"As if Mayor Marty Walsh wasn‚Äôt already busy enough boosting the Olympics. Now he says he‚Äôd be willing to spend more precious time and political capital leading a fight against legalizing marijuana, too.  Let‚Äôs leave aside, for now, concerns over how thinly that would spread a mayor who already has plenty demanding his focus. Purely from a policy perspective, it‚Äôs the wrong fight to take on.  There are, by some estimates, at least half a million marijuana users in Massachusetts. Keeping pot illegal hasn‚Äôt done anything to stanch demand. It‚Äôs easy to get, and it‚Äôs everywhere; ask any high school or college student.  Users support an industry worth millions upon millions each year in this state, said Matt Simon, New England political director of the DC-based Marijuana Policy Project. In the illicit market, sales are neither taxed nor regulated. Dealers, some connected to violent worlds, don‚Äôt card customers. We can‚Äôt stop people from smoking pot, but we can diminish and maybe crush the role of gangs and cartels by bringing the trade out of the shadows.  The laws we have now are not only ineffective, they‚Äôre oh so unevenly applied, with black users targeted way more heavily than white ones ‚Äî even though the two groups use at the same rate. An ACLU study found that in 2010 ‚Äî the year after possession of an ounce or less was decriminalized here ‚Äî black people were four times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession in Massachusetts. In Barnstable County, the imbalance was more shocking, with black users 11 times more likely than white users to be arrested.  Inequities like that should stop the mayor of a city that is 25 percent black in his tracks.  To be fair, Walsh didn‚Äôt go looking for this. He was asked whether he‚Äôd lead opposition to a 2016 ballot question to legalize pot, and said he‚Äôd ‚Äústep up if nobody else did.‚Äù And his position is heartfelt. He‚Äôs a recovering alcoholic, and his opposition to legal pot is based on a fervent belief that it is a gateway drug.  ‚ÄúI have known plenty of situations, plenty of families and individuals out there that will say they began drug use while smoking marijuana, which led to other drugs,‚Äù Walsh said yesterday. Legalization ‚Äúwill open up a whole potential new world of addicts.‚Äù  Here‚Äôs the problem with the mayor‚Äôs position: The marijuana-as-gateway thing is based on shaky science. There is a correlation between using marijuana and using harder drugs (a person interested in getting high might be more likely to try other mood-altering substances), and that is worth our attention. But that‚Äôs not the same as saying marijuana causes somebody to use harder drugs.  ‚ÄúJust because marijuana smokers might be more likely to later use, say, cocaine, does not imply that using marijuana causes one to use cocaine,‚Äù says FactCheck.org, which took New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to task for making the gateway argument in April. Some research ‚Äî inconclusive so far ‚Äî has found paths whereby marijuana primes the brain for other drug abuse, but similar results were found for tobacco and alcohol.  So if marijuana is a gateway drug, then tobacco and alcohol are, too. It makes little sense for a society in which tobacco is legal, and alcohol cheered, to make marijuana ‚Äî no more intrinsically harmful than they are ‚Äî illegal.  Walsh is resolutely unmoved by those arguments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a scientist,‚Äù he said, and he doesn‚Äôt want to argue about studies. He said he knows what he knows, and that any addiction counselor will back him up.  Look, even without the dubious gateway claims, marijuana can be dangerous. I worry especially about its effects on adolescents. But we have a better chance of addressing its dangers if we bring pot out into the open. The money we waste enforcing marijuana laws could go into the kind of education efforts that have so effectively cut tobacco use.  This is a losing battle for Walsh, and not just because he hasn‚Äôt got time for it. Legalization is not just inevitable. It‚Äôs right."

bostontrees,38icgr,Palindromer101,6,Thu Jun 4 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"The whole gateway thing is bogus.  IF cannabis is a ""gateway"" drug it is due to it being illegal.  Buy cannabis in a state where it is legal - go to store, pay taxes that fund shit.  Buy cannabis in a state where it is not legal - give money to drug dealer, occasionally get offered harder drugs.  If people could buy Cannabis at the store, they would.  They would then not be exposed to other ""harder"" drugs.  Similar to alcohol.  If alcohol was prohibited, organized crime groups would sell it - along with their other wares."

bostontrees,38cqg5,jeffiethepirate,5,Wed Jun 3 11:09:39 2015 UTC,"Patriot Care Corp., the only company awarded a state license to sell medical marijuana in Boston, would not sell the drug for recreational use at its controversial downtown location if a widely anticipated 2016 ballot initiative for legalization wins approval, the company‚Äôs lawyer vowed Tuesday.  The pledge came as leaders of several other marijuana companies, squeezed financially by months of bureaucratic delays in the state‚Äôs medical marijuana program, have said the prospect of legalizing recreational use is luring new investors. Many observers expect the marijuana legalization initiative to include a provision that would give existing medicinal dispensaries preference for recreational-use licenses.  But Patriot Care, backed by a New York financial company that has dispensaries in other states, would not wade into the recreational arena in Massachusetts, former City Council president Michael P. Ross, now Patriot‚Äôs lawyer, said in an interview.  The company is ‚Äúputting a hard line in the sand that says we will not sell recreational marijuana at 21 Milk St.,‚Äù said Ross, who also is a Boston Globe contributing columnist.  Patriot Care will stick to medicinal marijuana because the company is ‚Äúin the business of healing sick people,‚Äù Ross said.  View Story State Senate president open to legalizing marijuana ‚ÄúI think people should be allowed to do what they‚Äôre going to do unless they are going to hurt somebody else,‚Äù said Stanley Rosenberg.  He was slated Tuesday to argue the company‚Äôs case for a Milk Street dispensary before the city‚Äôs Zoning Board of Appeals, but asked for a deferral until July 7, a last-minute action that surprised dozens of advocates and opponents ready to speak at the hearing.  Ross said the company needed more time to sort out several operational issues, and to work closely with Mayor Martin J. Walsh, who has been a vocal opponent of medical marijuana. He declined to specify what issues needed to be addressed.  ‚ÄúWe are here to get it right in Boston,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúWe know that there are a lot of moving parts to it, and an education process that we know we have to bring residents and community leaders up to speed on.‚Äù  Walsh‚Äôs office released a statement saying that it supported the company‚Äôs request for a delay, and that it will ‚Äúwork with Patriot Care to address ongoing neighborhood concerns, including hours of operation and signage.‚Äù  Patriot Care has not announced a time frame for opening its Milk Street dispensary, which is across from the historic Old South Meeting House near Downtown Crossing.  The company‚Äôs planned location has infuriated the Downtown Boston Business Improvement District, a coalition of commercial property owners. Patriot‚Äôs pledge to shun recreational marijuana sales, should such use become legal next year, apparently didn‚Äôt change the business group‚Äôs thinking.  ‚ÄúThe input we‚Äôve received from these neighborhood stakeholders makes clear that their opposition is not to medical marijuana itself or the legalization of marijuana more generally; rather, it is about the fact that issues in the surrounding area make 21 Milk St. an inappropriate place for a medical marijuana dispensary,‚Äù the group said in a statement.  Ross said Patriot Care recently fared better with another neighborhood organization.  ‚ÄúWe were really proud to learn that the Midtown Cultural District Residents‚Äô Association voted in favor to support the dispensary,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúIt was a narrow margin.‚Äù  However, Rishi Shukla, the association‚Äôs cofounder, said it ‚Äúhas not yet taken an official position on 21 Milk St.‚Äù Shukla said a recent poll of its members drew only a 14 percent response, not enough to reach solid conclusions.  Patients at Tuesday‚Äôs City Hall hearing, hoping to support Patriot Care, were disappointed about the continued delays.  ‚ÄúI was extremely impressed by their plan,‚Äù said Brianna Morrell, a 22-year-old Boston resident who said she uses marijuana to treat irritable bowel syndrome, a chronic condition that causes cramping, abdominal pain, and other symptoms."

Basically he's saying he doesn't want to legalize because it's a gateway drug. Too bad that still illegal, it's still a gateway drug. If legalized, you have control over it. What don't they fucking understand?! Legalization will be beneficial and support the community. Ugh. They say they're looking out for kids or whatever, but less kids are smoking today than ever. You know what they're doing instead? Drinking and shooting heroin.   I really hate the politicians making weed a big fucking deal when heroin is the biggest problem in Massachusetts at the moment. You know how many people I know who have died from ODing just this year? 5. 5 of my friends dead because of it. They need to throw funding into providing naloxone to every police department in the state instead of fighting the inevitable. Weed will be legal, whether they want it or not."

Alcohol is legal and as such wasn't included in these surveys. Even though most addicts will tell you that booze was their first drug experience. That and cigarettes.

bostontrees,382fgv,BrutalTea,5,Mon Jun 1 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"ith a major battle in the making over marijuana legalization next year, Mayor Martin J. Walsh, a recovering alcoholic and a passionate advocate for those struggling with drug addiction, is emerging as the most likely face of the opposition.  Walsh said he would ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be willing to take the lead opposing the anticipated referendum in 17 months, presuming no other high-profile leader steps forward.  ‚ÄúI just think it would be a mistake to legalize marijuana in Massachusetts,‚Äù said Walsh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen too many lives ruined by starting to smoke weed and then, eventually, going to other types of drugs.‚Äù  Governor Charlie Baker, Attorney General Maura Healey, and Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley all oppose legalization, but none appears keen to lead the charge against the expected 2016 ballot question to legalize marijuana for recreational use.  There is political risk in opposing a referendum many pundits and elected officials expect to pass. Strong majorities of Massachusetts voters approved measures that decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana in 2008 and allowed its use for medical purposes in 2012.  View Story At Urban College, Walsh reflects on struggles ‚ÄúI realized that detox wasn‚Äôt the end of my life, it was just the beginning,‚Äù Boston‚Äôs mayor said at the college‚Äôs commencement.  But Walsh‚Äôs position is a matter of conscience, according to aides. Even as mayor, he still personally helps people struggling with addiction find beds in rehabilitation facilities, they said.  One adviser said Walsh feels strongly enough about opposing legalization ‚Äúthat he is willing to use his political capital to let people know that he is not in favor of it.‚Äù  While efforts to get a statewide ballot question have been in the works for years and a handful of groups are building infrastructure and raising money for a push, the opposition appears to have less formal organization and a less public and passionate voice.  Walsh, viewed favorably by about two-thirds of Boston registered voters, according to an April poll , could change that.  ‚ÄúThe most important thing you need for a ballot question is to introduce emotion into the debate,‚Äù said Steve Crawford, a Democratic strategist who has been involved in a number of state ballot campaigns. ‚ÄúAnd on this issue, no one has greater credibility than Mayor Walsh, and he is a formidable voice for families struggling with substance abuse.‚Äù  In a telephone interview, Walsh was animated about the issue, saying legalization in Colorado, one of four states and the District of Columbia that have approved it, has been no panacea. And he dismissed arguments proponents make for marijuana legalization.  ‚ÄúI view it as a gateway drug,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSome people can, I guess, smoke it recreationally and they don‚Äôt get addicted to it, but there‚Äôs a large number of people that are in recovery now or that are struggling on the streets with addiction, and they got their start by smoking weed.‚Äù  Asked about arguments from legalization backers about racial disparities ‚Äî that marijuana arrests disproportionately affect people of color ‚Äî Walsh had a sharp response.  ‚ÄúSo because of racial disparities we legalize a drug that potentially could kill people, lead to death?‚Äù the mayor asked with incredulity. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good enough reason to do it.‚Äù  Advocates pushed back.  Matt Simon, New England political director for the Marijuana Policy Project, which is involved in the push for legalization in Massachusetts in 2016, said the mayor is ‚Äúin denial‚Äù about the reality of marijuana use in the state.  Despite the best efforts of law enforcement over decades, marijuana is ‚Äúwidely available and widely used,‚Äù Simon said. And ‚Äúmarijuana is not known to have ever caused a fatal overdose.‚Äù  Beyond the familiar arguments though, is the question of who might lead the antilegalization charge or, at least, be its political face.  In a State House interview, Baker, a Republican, said he isn‚Äôt afraid to speak about his opposition to legalization when he is asked.  Yet, the governor said, ‚Äúwhile I‚Äôll certainly make my opinion known, I fully expect I‚Äôll be working on other stuff most of the time that‚Äôs related directly to the job I‚Äôve got here.‚Äù  Healey, the Democratic attorney general, reiterated her opposition to marijuana‚Äôs legalization through a spokesman, Christopher Loh. But, he added, she is ‚Äúalso mindful that any ballot petition‚Äù would have to come through the attorney general‚Äôs office and she ‚Äúwill respect that process.‚Äù  A spokeswoman for Conley, the Suffolk prosecutor, said in a statement that all of the state‚Äôs district attorneys have voiced opposition to legalization.  But, the spokeswoman, Renee Nadeau Algarin, emphasized that elected officials are not the only people ‚Äúwhose voices need to be heard.‚Äù She said leaders in the ‚Äúmedical, education, and youth services fields all have important roles in informing the communities they serve about the consequences of legalizing marijuana. Conley certainly hopes to hear those voices echoing the same opposition and deep concern raised by the state‚Äôs political leaders.‚Äù  Speaker Robert A. DeLeo has expressed opposition to legalization, but is not expected to campaign against it in 2016.  As with any political campaign, there is the question of money.  Joe Baerlein, a veteran state ballot question strategist who is not currently involved in either side of the legalization debate, said he expects any 2016 legalization question to be a tough and expensive ‚Äî millions of dollars ‚Äî campaign for both sides.  For the ‚Äúno‚Äù side, beginning ‚Äúwith Mayor Walsh, that‚Äôs a hell of a start,‚Äù and he could be a significant catalyst for helping to raise funds, Baerlein said.  But, he continued, ‚Äúyou have to build a statewide campaign.‚Äù"

There are a lot of jobs out there right now. Network and talk to as many people as possible. Go to events like patient meet ups there have been a few in RI. Also hit any trade shows there has been one every couple months it seems. Be friendly and talk to as many people you can. The cannabis institute is your best bet for job placement. Hope this helps.

A few days ago I decided I would finally go khighaking (high kayaking). I put my phone, a lighter, and a medicine bottle with three joints inside of it inside a fanny pack around my waist and put on a life jacket. I started out in a bay, but it was an unfamiliar place where I had never been on the water before. I passed the bay into the ocean but it was really windy. I decided to go back into the bay to smoke, since there would be significantly less wind as there would be on the open water. But the wind picked up, and kept pushing me further away from the bay's opening. There was a small isolated strip of sand that jutted out from the mainland, and I went there to see if I could wait for there to be less wind. But the wind picked up, and I was struggling to even get back in the boat. The sides of it were sharp and cut my legs as the waves pushed it against me while I was trying to get back in it. Finally (after maybe a 1/2 hour of struggle) I managed to push off from the sand and get into the water again. The wind was so bad, even though I was paddling back towards the bay, the wind was actually making me go backwards. One wave came and capsized the kayak, and dumped me out into deep water. I'm sort of afraid of like deep-ass ocean water (idk what it is, just the feeling of not knowing what could be underneath you?) and it took me a minute of swimming furiously to make it back to the strip of sand I had been stranded on. I was exhausted and my arms were #rekt, and I flopped dramatically on the sand coughing and breathing and crying (lmao). The kayak was still out in the water, and sinking (it's still out there tbh lol, I had to call the coast guard and tell them) but thank god the fanny pack around my waist had kept my phone dry. I was able to call for help and get picked up once I walked to the mainland off of the strip of sand. I went home, showered, cleaned my cuts, and generally rested my weak-ass arms. Then I looked in the plastic bag to get the joints and the lighter out, and they were still dry! I smoked them as a congrats for surviving almost drowning. Still not afraid of kayaking though! I just wouldn't ever do it on the ocean again I think.  Btw, always wear a life jacket cause it probs saved my life.  </end pointless story>"

The Dr said that without any physical symptoms or medical records she would have trouble providing a recommendation.  She asked if I could provide any docs from my primary care or other Dr showing a diagnosis.  She even had me call my Dr right from her office to see if he could fax something over.  He wasn't avail at that time, but he called me later in the day.    I explained to him that I needed a diagnosis printed on his letterhead or a scrip pad stating I suffered from anxiety / depression.  He asked what it was for and I told him mmj.  He paused for a sec and said I was his first patient to ask for this...then said ok come over to the office and I have a note ready in 15 min.    It took me a second trip up to Cannacare, but once I had the Dr's note they took my vitals, wrote up the recommendation and I was done.    As I understand it, the Cannacare Dr's can not (or will not) diagnosis you.  They expect you will provide some proof of your medical condition. It doesn't have to be an inch thick medical file, but they need something that documents your condition(s) so they can determine if mmj will help."

bostontrees,36653v,jeffiethepirate,4,Sat May 16 14:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's great that people who truly need it for medical reasons will have a reliable option, but the level of regulations and ""safety"" circle-jerking is ridiculous. Personally, I'll wait for 2016 and the legalization ballot initiative. Anything less is just a way to convince the public that a slight loosening of the systematic prohibition and control over their personal rights is something they should be grateful for."
bostontrees,36653v,EDante,3,Sun May 17 02:24:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the tide is heading towards decriminalization and recreational acceptance on the level of tobacco and alcohol. Packaging and hiding it behind curtains seems a bit much.  It's not friggin' OxyContin!  Edit: I'm happy for a dispensary to finally open, but I feel I don't need an evaluation. I know about the plant and its effects and I want what I know and like, but this place is great for those that are truly foreign to cannabis, and from that pov it's good for the patients that truly need it."
bostontrees,36653v,nykwil3281,1 point,Sun May 17 22:50:00 2015 UTC,"Bingo. The extreme regulation measures suggest that the plant is at least somewhat as dangerous as its opponents suggest, which only furthers their arguments imo."
bostontrees,36653v,EDante,1 point,Sun May 17 23:10:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah but when nothing dangerous happens, that argument is shit.  ""Its dangerous!!!!""   can be followed up with ""0 patients have had issues, no it is not""."

But my assumption is you call and they simply meet you at the otherwise empty (for some unknown reason) dispensary and let you in.  I don't think you'll have to order blind but we will see."

If they gave a shit about the patients we'd actually be hearing about what products they will have etc. At least some information. Instead, you have a group that is otherwise unheard of, working incredibly closely with the local govt but NOT including the patients.  Sketchy"
bostontrees,363c41,dvnfhy,9,Fri May 15 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"Unless you specifically release your medical records, the only people who have access to the information are law enforcement and the Department of Public Health. Law enforcement can only confirm or deny that you are a patient, whereas the DPH is able to see certification history, caregiver status, and purchase history from dispensaries (once they open). Federal agencies wouldn't normally have access unless they are investigating you for something.   -Medical marijuana evaluation office employee in MA"
bostontrees,363c41,wizard_82,4,Fri May 15 20:47:53 2015 UTC,Purchase history from dispensaries? Great..
bostontrees,363c41,dvnfhy,3,Sat May 16 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"Essentially the same as a doctor being able to view your prescription history. They want to ensure that you're under the 10 oz./ 60 days limit. Lack of dispensaries aside, we certainly do not have the best medical program around."
bostontrees,363c41,DctrKevorkian,6,Mon May 18 02:44:42 2015 UTC,I have been wondering the same.

bostontrees,363c41,wizard_82,4,Fri May 15 20:10:14 2015 UTC,This is no longer true. Patients need to be registered with the MA Department of Public Health to be recognized as a legal MMJ patient.
bostontrees,363c41,Telogos_,2,Fri May 15 20:58:20 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure mass police can check to verify a medical card.
bostontrees,363c41,CharlieScroggins,5,Sat May 16 02:57:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it would seem that this is covered by HIPAA and that DPH cannot legally share its records with anyone. That being said, I have heard from various people in the medical cannabis community that they know people who had the results turn up as part of a background check. It seems there might be strange legal loopholes because it's still illegal federally. I expect that this will likely need to be hashed out in court before we have a clear answer about where the records may spread."
bostontrees,363c41,BDH420,1 point,Fri May 15 22:05:03 2015 UTC,"HIPAA is a federal statute which applies to covered entities (healthcare providers) and their business associates (generally vendors who have access to protected health information). DPH is neither but that doesn't mean your information is not legally protected.   The MA Data Privacy law sets the standards to be met by persons who own or license personal information about a resident of the Commonwealth. Personal information includes a Massachusetts resident's first name and last name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements that relate to such resident: (a) Social Security number; (b) driver's license number or state-issued identification card number; or (c) financial account number, or credit or debit card number, with or without any required security code, access code, personal identification number or password.  There are two aspect to federal access to a Massachusetts patient's medical marijuana related information. In both cases a federal agency would need a court order to compel the patient's physician from sharing the medical record or DPH from sharing the patient's registration."
bostontrees,363c41,BDH420,3,Wed May 20 13:29:30 2015 UTC,I have a friend who was recommended for cannabis but they receive housing benefits for being disabled. A person she knows is not cannabis friendly and heard them talking about it. A Week later they were called into housing and made to sign a pice of paper stating they where not a medical cannabis patient. If they still where they would lose their housing benefits. They can no longer use cannabis to help their disability. If they are registered can housing find out? Thank you to any one who can help with an answer.  :edit: Just my 2 cents. They have a hardship to grow and some other hardship clause for low-income or disabled patients. If some one receiving government benefits can't be a patient then why offer the hardships to them?
bostontrees,363c41,darkrom,3,Tue May 19 21:02:29 2015 UTC,Still no one who can anser whether government groups like housing can see if you're a patient. I can't seem to find a lawyer of any one who knows the answer to this. My friend would love to be able to medicate again but they fear loosing their house because some one already called them and they were made to come in and sign a paper stating they would no longer be a patient or they would lose there housing.
bostontrees,363c41,Rizzalso,4,Sun May 24 18:07:37 2015 UTC,"Federally, assume anyone federally can.  I believe they have access to all state computers, but when it comes to information privacy, its been quite clear that the federal agencies do WHATEVER they want with no recourse at all.  If they are logging all of your personal cell calls/texts/emails illegally, chances are quite good that your medical records in state dabases are not somehow off limits."
bostontrees,363c41,LED_oneshot,2,Fri May 15 19:55:14 2015 UTC,A quick google search found these 2 links: http://patientprivacyrights.org/basic-health-privacy-faqs/  http://patients.about.com/od/yourmedicalrecords/a/Who-Has-Access-To-Your-Medical-Records.htm  TL;DR:  Employers who don't provide your healthcare need written permission to access them.  Insurance agencies and law enforcement do not.

bostontrees,35udp0,lolwwww,2,Wed May 13 23:55:25 2015 UTC,~550$ an ounce in my country with average salary ~1000$. You guys are lucky.

bostontrees,35udp0,indicagrrl,2,Thu May 14 11:50:30 2015 UTC,Yeah! That is happening! What the fuck?   Everything was much cheaper initially with med cards.
bostontrees,35udp0,EpicNameGuy,2,Thu May 14 11:58:51 2015 UTC,I've noticed that the prices have come down a bit.  There is one supplier for many of these delivery services so it's the same shite no matter the price.
bostontrees,35udp0,EpicNameGuy,3,Fri May 22 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"230-260 a zip tops as an MMJ patient. And whether its top-shelf or not is irrelevant to me. If it has the looks, the smell, the taste, and the effect, that's all that matters to me.   I'm not going to pay a huge premium just for bragging rights. I'll leave that to the kids."
bostontrees,35udp0,otallday,2,Fri May 15 12:56:45 2015 UTC,The question about top shelf is more about making an apples to apples comparison.   It isn't at all about bragging about whose stuff is the best. If one person is paying $100 an Oz but it is brick weed that doesn't give too much information about the overall market.    The forbes article that is linked to seems to presume an overall high or medical grade (for whatever that particular social construct might mean across the nation).  This is still very subjective but it's worth trying to compare similar grades of cannabis.
bostontrees,35udp0,jeffiethepirate,2,Sat May 16 00:07:55 2015 UTC,"For sure, without taking quality into consideration, the context is completely lost. Good point."

The alfa uses way less herb than a pax at once due to the heat pin design, has no mouthpiece to stick and require a cleaning (frequently anyway) and its got the auto time mode and auto puff mode.    I think its a pax on steroids, with smaller loads."

For something that is so mundane in almost every other country in the world the US seems to pit alcohol against weed for whatever reason. Highschool kids and college kids are going to drink, whether they want to or not. Peer pressure is a very real thing and getting caught up in that shouldn't have lomg lasting consequences. That's just my opinion so I can't hold you to that belief."

I often use AVB in my baked goods and have to use trial and error to dial in the dosage. You folks did a great set of posts on reclaim and resin.   Any chance you could see what's left behind in some AVB?
bostontrees,34znfy,member_member5thNov,4,Tue May 5 23:03:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind words!  We did a small study on ABV - find it here.

Oil on top, black scum water on the bottom.  I do this twice then add lecithin so it doesnt emulsify the water and make it harder to separate.

It isn't really a good idea but to each their own. The garage roof has beautiful views that are well worth checking out post smoking elsewhere or after the movie anyway.  Stay away from smoking directly in front of the theater as there is a daycare by the entrance.  The cambridge police station is a few blocks away on 6th St. so try not to smoke directly around there and be aware that anywhere in the kendall area will have police cars rolling through fairly frequently on their way to and from the headquarters.  But it's cambridge so as long as you aren't smoking directly around kids aren't generally a dick about it no one really cares at all.

I brought a bunch of charts, MRIs on a disc, reports, etc from the past few years.  I went in, paid my $200, and waited. Went in to see a dude (not sure of his position) that just talked to me about marijuana, answered questions, etc. I've been smoking for 15 years - I didn't really have any questions. But we chatted for a bit and it was cool. Then back to the waiting room.  Then went in to see the doctor. He did a very quick exam (reflexes,  stethoscope, etc) and talked to me about my issues/symptoms. He glanced at my records but no longer than needed to make sure they were legit (like, 1 minute max) and told me hes recommending I try medical marijuana.  They printed my paperwork and I was off!  Then I had to register with the state online ($50 fee). Got an official plastic card a week or two later in the mail.  The whole process was super easy, though it did eat up an hour and a half of my day.  PM me if you want more candid details/you have any questions."
bostontrees,34d3e5,xzxzyog,3,Thu Apr 30 14:56:37 2015 UTC,Alright thanks for all of your help this will definitely help!

bostontrees,34d3e5,xandarg,2,Thu Apr 30 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"I literally just went in and said I have back pain due to anxiety and stress. The doctor asked me a few questions (have I tried other treatments, does marijuana help, etc) and listened to my breathing for about 1 second and then sent me on my way with my rec in hand. It's very easy. No sweat.  When I went it cost $200."
bostontrees,34d3e5,jeffiethepirate,2,Thu Apr 30 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Call your doctor, ask for a copy of your medical record, bring it to any doc that advertises as a medical marijuana doc (so canna care, etc etc), then tell them exactly what you just told us. Doesn't get any simpler than that. There're no hoops to jump through. If you have any specific questions, call up the office of the medical marijuana doc you've chosen and they'll tell you everything while you set up an appointment with them.

bostontrees,34b6k5,jbcg,3,Wed Apr 29 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify: DPH can issue up to 35 licenses total, as the regulations stand. They've issued 15 provisional, plus MMM's 3 = 18 awarded. They are required to license at least one license per county (there are 14 counties in Mass.) but no more than 5 per county.   MMM allocated 50% of its gross revenues to a management company in order to compensate its Board of Directors, among other reasons, because non-profit BODs cannot legally receive compensation.   Paying a management company isn't necessarily an issue, but 50% is extremely high and certainly doesn't match the actual contributions (read: actual work performed) of Delahunt and his cohort.   We're talking millions and millions of dollars to launch a RMD, so there must be some way to offer investors a return. The MMM ruling sets precedent for this management structure ... hopefully within reason. Dispensary revenues should also be spent on executing the non-profits' missions."
bostontrees,34b6k5,JiggyJack,3,Thu Apr 30 19:57:57 2015 UTC,Great details. thanks!
bostontrees,34b6k5,sushi_sandwiches,2,Thu Apr 30 20:14:34 2015 UTC,Current status of Dispensaries can be found here: http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/hcq/medical-marijuana/current-status-mmj-dispensaries.html.  Currently 4 are approved to grow and three are in process of getting approval to sell.
bostontrees,34b6k5,sushi_sandwiches,3,Tue Jun 2 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article?    A judge has ordered state regulators to allow a company previously headed by former congressman William Delahunt to move forward with plans to open medical marijuana dispensaries in Mashpee and Plymouth, ruling it was improperly denied licenses last year.  In a 22-page ruling Monday, a Suffolk Superior Court judge found that the Department of Public Health failed to follow its own regulations in June when it rejected a bid by Medical Marijuana of Massachusetts to open three dispensaries, after initially supporting it.  The denial came five months after the company scored the highest among 100 applicants and was among 20 selected to move on to the inspection phase. It also paid a $50,000 registration fee for each of its three proposed dispensaries.    Seems like a good thing to me. The state has been dragging ass on approving these dispensaries. 3 years and not 1 dispensary?? cmon now   Since Massachusetts voters in 2012 overwhelmingly approved the medical use of marijuana, not a single dispensary has opened, despite the state‚Äôs goal of having the first facilities open last summer. Fifteen licenses were awarded last year."
bostontrees,34b6k5,fightONstate,3,Wed Apr 29 20:07:16 2015 UTC,Delahunt is a former congressman and now a lobbiest.  Despite a process that excluded the majority of applicants Delahunt's company imporbably managed to garner three licenses.  The process so badly reeked of cronyism and favoritism that the award of licenses was overturned.  This ruling overturns that process.  Are you not familier with Bill Delahunt and the embaressment that was the initial licensing awards?
bostontrees,34b6k5,fightONstate,3,Wed Apr 29 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"I am familiar with William Delahunt and the embarrassment that has been the licensing process in MA, including Delahunt's involvemnt. Since then, Delahunt has resigned from MMM, and stands to gain nothing from this ruling (behind closed doors, who knows, this state is fucked anyways). Regardless of the licensing debacle, the state has yet to open a single dispensary 3 years after the people of the commonwealth agreed to allow Medical Maryj. Meanwhile, states like CO and WA have generated millions in taxes, yet MA hasn't done shit. At this point, one would almost welcome cronyism and favortism if it means legal access to medicine for the people of the Commonwealth."
bostontrees,34b6k5,LED_oneshot,3,Wed Apr 29 20:35:55 2015 UTC,The issuing of licenses to Medical Marijuana of Massachusetts will preclude others from receiving them. They have already demonstrated that they will act unethically. I want access as much as the next patient but in no world is this specific business monopolizing three of the available possible licenses good for the patients of massachusetts.
bostontrees,34b6k5,fightONstate,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:01:02 2015 UTC,"Monopolizing three of the available licenses...    They are all in different areas. Presumably there's a geographic component to markets here. Also, 3/100 licenses is not anywhere close to enabling monopoly pricing. Guess how concentrated general health care (assuming were talking about an extension of the health care system in MA) is in MA, and the US in general? I hardly see an issue with one company having 3% market share."
bostontrees,34b6k5,LED_oneshot,2,Thu Apr 30 02:23:53 2015 UTC,It's not out of 100 dude. There are only 20 areas available for licenses. And that's for the entire state. They aren't really demographically proportionate. The eastern part of the state is around 80% of the population. these three licenses represent a significant amount of the population.   No one else was awarded three licenses. They are consuming a significant proportion of available licenses.

bostontrees,346g0a,LED_oneshot,4,Tue Apr 28 19:31:55 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Here is the PDF I was looking for earlier.  http://www.southhadley.org/DocumentCenter/Home/View/295  Page 1, 2nd question   Are qualifying patients eligible for medical marijuana under the new law starting January 1, 2013, while DPH is drafting its regulations?  During the time DPH is crafting its regulations, the ballot measure allows the written recommendation of a qualifying patient‚Äôs physician to act as a medical marijuana registration card. The law allows a written recommendation to serve as a limited cultivation registration, meaning a qualifying patient may cultivate his or her own limited supply of marijuana during this period. Under the law, until DPH issues its regulations, it is not involved in regulating any medical marijuana recommendations between physicians and patients, or in defining the limited cultivation registration. Even once final regulations are put in place, patients may continue to visit physicians for certification, and to possess legally allowable amounts of medical marijuana as defined in the regulations, before DPH‚Äôs anticipated online registration system is available. DPH will notify the public on its medical marijuana website, www.mass.gov/medicalmarijuana, when this system is operational and must be used.    He is correct. Anyone with a REGISTERED card can grow right now. Has been that way since day 1 of 2013  http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/quality/medical-marijuana/law-enforcement-guidance.pdf   Until DPH begins to process hardship cultivation applications patients or their caregivers may conduct limited cultivation at their primary residence, but may only grow a sufficient amount for their sixty day supply as certified by the patient‚Äôs physician. They must remain in compliance with all DPH regulations regarding Hardship Cultivation. DPH will announce when applications for Hardship Cultivation Registration will be required for home cultivation."

bostontrees,33zkz8,AK-48,2,Mon Apr 27 12:30:04 2015 UTC,"Personally I wouldn't use a pipe cleaning service.  Chances my glass would get broken in transit or cleaning are just too high for me to be willing to risk my pieces.  But I also generally like my pieces with a little patina from use. I clean them when they get disgusting, get clogged, or I want the reclaim from a rig.  Since I switched to Amsterdam rules and change out the water in my rigs and bongs after every use they generally already stay quite clean.  But to each their own and good luck to you if you think you can make a go of it."

bostontrees,33zkz8,AK-48,2,Mon Apr 27 15:11:35 2015 UTC,"Not my idea or business but just trying to help.  I've cleaned pieces with black cake that were left to sit for 2+ years with this method.  If ISO was like 6/10 for how strong it cleans, this shit is a 9 or 10.  Its made to strip labels off of beer bottles."
bostontrees,33zkz8,member_member5thNov,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:53:49 2015 UTC,Oh haha whoops.  Cool beans man thanks I'll give it a bid.
bostontrees,33zkz8,darkrom,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:56:10 2015 UTC,You try soaking it for a few days with hightest iso? Not 91% but the next step up--95% or 98%.  Really clogged tree perks will usually respond to that. Especially if you dump the stuff after it's been sitting a few days and then do another wash & shake with fresh and a few warm water runs.
bostontrees,33zkz8,member_member5thNov,3,Mon Apr 27 15:39:39 2015 UTC,That pbw I linked to has taken care of gunk that a week of soaking in 95% ethanol couldn't touch.  Its like the best kept secret of glass cleaning.
bostontrees,33zkz8,darkrom,2,Mon Apr 27 16:54:58 2015 UTC,I've found a major difference in using the high test ISO vs the lower 90s stuff. Those last few % make a big difference.   I have yet to find a clog high test ISO and time cannot handle. Except for a very curved one hitter. That piece is just clogged forever and serves me right for buying something that clog prone.
bostontrees,33zkz8,member_member5thNov,4,Mon Apr 27 17:45:19 2015 UTC,Give it the pbw challenge.   This could clean up congress its so strong.
bostontrees,33zkz8,darkrom,2,Mon Apr 27 17:59:22 2015 UTC,It clogs in like three hits under any circumstances. I keep it as a reminder of my hubris.  But good to know I've got the option.
bostontrees,33zkz8,member_member5thNov,3,Mon Apr 27 18:50:38 2015 UTC,Haha sounds horrible.  I wonder if it would last longer with vapor vs resin from smoke?
bostontrees,33zkz8,AK-48,2,Mon Apr 27 20:01:47 2015 UTC,It is curved so aggressively that unless you immediately clear it with a pipe cleaner after every use it clogs.  I'm sure vapor would be better but I'm not sure why I'd bother using it that way. I'll just keep hitting my 'cano bags as is.
bostontrees,33zkz8,member_member5thNov,2,Mon Apr 27 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I still have to dilute it with water, would be expensive as fuck to even fill the whole three feet with iso."
bostontrees,33zkz8,AK-48,2,Mon Apr 27 16:55:52 2015 UTC,Is it three feet worth of percs? My larger pieces I never need to fill all the way with ISO. Usually I can get every bit soaking overnight with some tipping and creative suspension.   I don't think I've ever used more than half a bottle at most cleaning any of them.  Also let me put in a plug for changing the water after every use like they do at coffeeshops or at the very least dumping it that same night. Even the next morning is better than nothing.   If you don't let the water sit for long nothing has a chance to get that clogged.
bostontrees,33zkz8,member_member5thNov,2,Mon Apr 27 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"It has three tree percs stacked up probably like 18"" worth.  And true thats my problem I change my water once every week or two lol it takes too long to fill."
bostontrees,33zkz8,AK-48,2,Mon Apr 27 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"You should be able to soak those with much less ISO just by plugging the top, laying it on its side, and rotating after a day or so.  Just think about cleaning segments at a time like slices of a pie.  You may see fewer clogs if you even change the base chamber water more regularly."
bostontrees,33zkz8,member_member5thNov,2,Mon Apr 27 17:41:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll deffs do this once I go back to using this piece.  Staying concentrates only for a bit :)
bostontrees,33zkz8,member_member5thNov,2,Mon Apr 27 17:44:30 2015 UTC,Did you feel like having that many percs gave a good hit?  I've always steered clear because they seem like a huge pain in the ass to clean.
bostontrees,33zkz8,wobwobwob42,2,Mon Apr 27 17:46:45 2015 UTC,And if you are diluting the ISO with water that might be your problem right there. Straight ISO is a good solvent. Mixed with water it's going to be pretty crap.

I've stopped though since a person's piece is their personal peace.  I do cringe inside whenever I pick up someone's filthy resined up piece though. Just cuz I'm so OCD. No amount of fresh water or hot fire dank, in a super resined up bong/pipe can get rid of that stale taste, that you know clean glass wouldn't give.   Hasn't stopped me yet though. :)"

You can still go to the MMJ clinic and receive your certification and also see your other doctor. Clinics like CannaCare and Integr8 and MMJ Physicians help you realize the benefits and concerns of medical marijuana, but they do not give you any. Help can be found though for finding a caregiver as well,"

For some people with specific conditions it can be not a great idea.   Best of luck working through the process and do ask any questions as you might have!

bostontrees,33iyvu,tweeprise69,3,Thu Apr 23 06:21:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions.. I will not just stop taking my current meds .. I just need a primary care doctor who will still prescribe me my meds while I try this alternative method and if trees dont work let me continue on what meds that trees are not helping with.. Both my doctors are against it so if I try trees and get tested I will lose the trust and probably the ability to get these meds fro those doctors (1 specialty doctor and my primary care doctor) If I am so lucky that trees work and let me get off the meds I will be less worried because I wont need those meds anymore .. but it seems to be a one way road unless you have a primary care doctor who is supportive of trying this.

bostontrees,33dpxh,jeffiethepirate,3,Tue Apr 21 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"By Yvonne Abraham  How much longer does Father Joe Quinn have to wait?  Sometimes, when the Franciscan friar says Mass at St. Anthony‚Äôs Shrine downtown, he is in so much pain that tears roll down his face. He has Ogilvie‚Äôs syndrome, a rare gastrointestinal disorder that has put him in the hospital for months at a time, required multiple operations, and left him dependent on a feeding tube. It hurts, all day every day, the agony an 8 or 9 on a 10-point scale.  ‚ÄúAfter a while, the pain becomes unredemptive,‚Äù he said, his eyes welling. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt serve any purpose, except to be in pain.‚Äù  He can‚Äôt take painkillers, because they exacerbate his condition. His doctor told him there is nothing she can do for him, and recommended he use medical marijuana. That should be possible for Quinn. He got a permit to buy medical marijuana months ago. But like thousands of others, he has been held hostage by the debacle that is this state‚Äôs medical marijuana program.  ‚ÄúI have walked down in the lobby and smelt smoke and I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄòI know that‚Äôs not incense,‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù Quinn said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all around. I just do not understand what the big deal is, when you can get heroin for a fraction of the price on the street.‚Äù  The art, and science, behind growing medical marijuana  State revamps marijuana licensing process  Delays threaten Mass. medical marijuana firms  Others might risk going to that street for what they need, but he‚Äôs a priest. He wants to get help legally and properly.  Massachusetts voters legalized medical marijuana back in 2012. The first dispensaries should have opened last summer. But the implementation of the system has been a case study in ham-handedness. The approval process for vendors became such a bog of questions, confusion, and scandal that some applicants fled.  One company, Patriot Care, survived the state‚Äôs messy approval process (and several unflattering Globe stories) to get licenses for three dispensaries. It is hoping to open the first in downtown Boston, on Milk Street, a short walk from St. Anthony‚Äôs Shrine.  But some powerful neighbors won‚Äôt have it. The Downtown Boston Business Improvement District, a coalition of commercial property owners in the area, is opposed. The group‚Äôs president, Rosemarie Sansone, was kind enough to call from vacation on Friday to explain the group‚Äôs reasoning, but after a long conversation, I‚Äôm still mystified.  She said the BID worries the dispensary planned for Milk Street would be too close to day-care centers, the Old South Church, the Freedom Trail, and the Irish Famine Memorial. Those tourist attractions bring ‚Äúmany young people into this area on a daily basis,‚Äù she said. That part of downtown, home to several homeless shelters, already sees many 911 calls, she said.  ‚ÄúWe are working very, very hard to make this the comeback neighborhood everybody wants it to be,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not there yet, and this is one additional challenge.‚Äù  Why should a dispensary be an additional challenge? We‚Äôre not talking about a strip club, or a brothel. A marijuana dispensary is not like a methadone clinic, or a shooting gallery where heroin addicts gather and get high. It‚Äôs not as if a dispensary is going to bring hordes of potheads onto Milk Street, who will then park themselves on the sidewalk outside to toke up and gorge themselves on Funyuns.  Is it possible some of Patriot Care‚Äôs customers, carrying permits they don‚Äôt deserve, will use the marijuana they get from Milk Street recreationally? Of course. There will no doubt be abuse of the system, but that‚Äôs on state regulators, not on the dispensary. And it‚Äôs certainly not on the Father Joe Quinns of the world, who deserve a chance to get the medicine they need, somewhere near their homes.  ‚ÄúThat is why they have medications, to take away people‚Äôs pain,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I am asking all that much.‚Äù  In May, the city‚Äôs Zoning Board of Appeal will decide whether to allow the Milk Street dispensary to open. It would be easy for it to give in to the alarmist and uninformed concerns of opponents. The board should listen, instead, to the concerns, and the crying need, of people like Quinn."

Idk anything about The Holistic Center. Some docs require records. I got both recommendation and renewal at CannaCare in Southie. They didn't ask for any records but ymmv. I have two qualifying physical conditions both of which are obvious so idk how much questioning might be involved w/ the more subjective qualifying conditions.

bostontrees,32l6c5,DestinationCO,4,Tue Apr 14 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is the mess I thought MA was still in. In CO, Caregivers are only loosely tracked or regulated, but I worry MA will make it next to impossible to become legitimate unless you are rich and politically connected. Keep watching RI have their caregiver battle too. Good luck out there!"
bostontrees,32l6c5,darkrom,4,Tue Apr 14 22:07:12 2015 UTC,caregiving here is near impossible to do legally.  You are expected to grow for just one patient and no one else.
bostontrees,32l6c5,member_member5thNov,3,Tue Apr 14 22:10:34 2015 UTC,The regulations for caregivers are still extremely unclear. The wording of the law and current DPH interpretation seems to suggest that legally speaking a caregiver may have only have one patient.  That isn't in the law as written though and there are caregivers filling the niche opened by the DPH and State's failure to efficiently and effectively implement access to medical cannabis. They may be operating in a legal gray area. The state keeps saying it is entirely illegal. I think it'll unfortunately take a court case to make it clear.  The situation should clarify a little after the dispensaries begin opening.
bostontrees,32l6c5,otallday,2,Tue Apr 14 18:24:09 2015 UTC,So care givers can't legally pay/acquire some type of license?
bostontrees,32l6c5,fuckapuke,2,Tue Apr 14 21:29:20 2015 UTC,"You can get a caregiver's license but you may have only one patient.  The law was written so that there could be up to five patients per caregiver so yes, that sounds like something that might have to be hammered out.  You can, however,  be a caregiver for multiple immediate family members right now."
bostontrees,32l6c5,member_member5thNov,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"Not as far as I understand it. I believe, and someone please do correct me, that caregivers can only be designated by a single patient.   As the regulations are worded a caregiver isn't a vendor. They are someone who drives to the dispensary and picks up your stuff for you and cannot be arrested while doing so."

bostontrees,32gdif,jeffiethepirate,5,Mon Apr 13 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"marijuana institute in Natick is trying to attract a new crop of students by offering them scholarship funds to cover a portion of their tuition fees.  From now until April 20 ‚Äî or 4/20 ‚Äî any new students who enroll at the Northeastern Institute of Cannabis will not only qualify for a $420 scholarship, they will also be entered into a drawing for a chance to win a full ride at the marijuana-centric learning center.  The initial deposit to take classes at the school is also being scaled back, from $700 to $420, in celebration of the number that bears symbolic meaning for marijuana users. The usual total cost of the program is $2,000.  ‚ÄúWe hope that enthusiasts will choose to come to the Northeastern Institute of Cannabis and learn more about the plant and the science behind it ‚Äî this makes it a little easier to enroll,‚Äù said Cara Crabb-Burnham, the school‚Äôs administrator.  The significance of the term ‚Äú4/20‚Äù can be traced back to a group of students who smoked pot together in California in the 1970s. Crabb-Burnahm said since then, the 4/20 following has become more of a symbol of ‚Äúcamaraderie of fighting the war‚Äù on marijuana.  In Boston, on April 20, marijuana activists gather on the Common to smoke and advocate for the legalization of the leafy drug. People also commonly light up when the clock strikes 4:20 p.m. on any given day.  It‚Äôs become a ‚Äútime to smoke cannabis in celebration of cannabis,‚Äù said Crabb-Burnham.  The Northeastern Institute of Cannabis, a two-classroom school located in an office park in the suburbs, prepares students for careers as medical marijuana dispensary workers and medical marijuana educators.  During their studies, students learn about cannabis law in New England, cultivation, and even the science behind the growing process.  The school opened up in anticipation of the burgeoning marijuana industry.  Massachusetts voters approved a ballot question in 2012 to legalize the use of medical marijuana. The first dispensaries to sell the drug have yet to open their doors.  Close to 200 people have enrolled at the institute since it started offering classes last year, and over 30 have graduated from the program so far.  The 12-course program ‚Äî each course is four hours long ‚Äî is capped off by a competency exam at the end.  Students only learn about the aspects of the marijuana industry during their studies, and don‚Äôt actually work with the plants on campus.  The school also runs extracurricular programs, beyond their classes, including support groups and trips to off-campus conventions.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been great since we opened. It‚Äôs just such an active community here,‚Äù Crabb-Burnham said.  Steve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @steveannear. Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the tuition price for the Northeastern Institute of Cannabis. The cost is $2,000."

bostontrees,323vim,jeffiethepirate,5,Fri Apr 10 10:54:35 2015 UTC,"Just say no!  Nancy Reagan first uttered her unforgettable anti-drug mantra in 1984. More than three decades later, most of our state leaders seem to be following the former first lady‚Äôs lead. But while high-level, bipartisan embrace of a hard line on, say, the deadly opioid epidemic makes obvious sense, top officials‚Äô please-keep-off-the-grass consensus on marijuana is head-in-the-sand stuff.is matters because Massachusetts is likely to be deciding whether to join the District of Columbia and four states (Colorado, Washington, Alaska, and Oregon) in legalizing recreational use. If the necessary signatures are collected, the question would be on the November 2016 ballot. A few legislators are even trying to leapfrog direct democracy by making it legal the old-fashioned way, on Beacon Hill.  But with the governor, attorney general, district attorneys, and Boston‚Äôs mayor so far just saying no in unison, the odds of that are slightly less than the T running on time in snow‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâor sunshine, for that matter.  Last month on my radio show, the governor was unequivocal in his stance on outright legalization: ‚ÄúI oppose it and will always oppose it.‚Äù At the same time, he said he sees the effort initiated by the Senate president (who says he is currently agnostic on the issue) to study ‚Äúthe practical real-life experience‚Äù of first-in-the-nation Colorado ‚Äúincredibly valuable.‚Äù On that, I assume all would agree.  While we await the results of that research, some things are already known. In year one, Colorado, which has a slightly smaller population than Massachusetts, took in about $44 million in taxes on recreational sales; lots of that money is going to schools. You thinking what I‚Äôm thinking?  The most often advanced objections‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhere, and there‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâappear to fall into two categories: the gateway drug concern and the dangers of driving high.  On the former, it is a gateway for some, as is alcohol, as is gambling. Will opponents move to outlaw them, too? And has six years of decriminalization here caused any of the problems opponents fear full legalization will? For the vast majority of users, it‚Äôs not a problem. Jeb Bush, Barack Obama, Charlie Baker, Maura Healey‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äânone of whom support legalization‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâadmit to having smoked weed. All of them turned out pretty well, or at least most of them did.  A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last year asked American voters which of four substances they viewed as most harmful to a person‚Äôs overall health. Tobacco was at the top, picked by 49 percent of survey respondents. Second on the list was alcohol, chosen by 24 percent. Marijuana came in a distant fourth at a mere 8 percent. Know what was in third place? A substance that nearly twice as many respondents considered more dangerous than weed? Sugar. Let‚Äôs ban it!  The worry about driving under the influence may also be a little overblown. In a study the authors described as the ‚Äúmost precisely controlled‚Äù of its kind yet conducted, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration declared in February that while driving drunk dramatically increased the risk of getting into an accident, there was no evidence that smoking marijuana alone increased the risk in a statistically significant way.  All this research aside, what I find particularly odd is that our leaders seem to have forgotten that old saying: If you ignore history, you are doomed to have voters embrace an imperfect marijuana law come November 2016.  In 2008, the then governor, the DAs, and the attorney general all opposed decriminalization of an ounce or less, yet 63 percent of the voters rejected their advice. Four years later, it was a similar result, with 65 percent of us saying yes to medical use of marijuana, despite near-unanimous opposition at the top. It‚Äôs now 2¬Ω years later, and not even one dispensary has opened (though the first, in Salem, is finally scheduled to in early summer). Maybe if the Legislature had done a more effective job drafting the measure than balloters did, we wouldn‚Äôt be in the middle of this mess.  Beacon Hill should also take a few minutes to look over FBI crime statistics. The American Civil Liberties Union released a study in 2013 called The War on Marijuana in Black and White. It found that in the year after decriminalization, a black person in the Bay State was 3.9 times more likely to be charged with possession of marijuana than a white person. That‚Äôs despite federal surveys showing blacks and whites use the drug at comparable rates.  Bottom line is that the people of Massachusetts are ahead of their representatives yet again. National polls show most support legalizing recreational use; the numbers have been moving up in this state, too, and are now at nearly 50 percent. You don‚Äôt need to be Nostradamus to see what‚Äôs coming. The public does‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthree-quarters of Americans, including a majority of supporters and opponents, say marijuana use will eventually be legal around the country.  So why not complete the Senate study, debate the issues, carefully craft a bill that makes the product safe while regulating and taxing it, then make it law. There are plenty of causes that could make good use of 40 or 50 million bucks in new revenue.  Maybe it‚Äôs time to get Nancy Reagan to reconsider. Maybe it‚Äôs time to just say yes.

bostontrees,31vhqz,jeffiethepirate,2,Wed Apr 8 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"Medical marijuana licensing process to be streamlined By Kay LazarGLOBE STAFF  APRIL 08, 2015  The current process to license medical marijuana dispensaries in Massachusetts has ‚Äúclearly‚Äù not worked, the state health commissioner said Wednesday, as she announced a new streamlined system.  ‚ÄúWhat we have in place now is a confusing, overly lengthy process that has delayed appropriate patients from getting access,‚Äù said Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel, to a meeting of the state Public Health Council, an appointed body of academics and physicians that creates health regulations.  Dr. Bharel said the problems that plagued the process under the administration of former governor Deval Patrick made it far more costly than expected, leaving her agency with a deficit of more than $1 million.  ‚ÄúClearly, this process did not work,‚Äù Bharel said.  Bharel said under the new system, marijuana dispensaries will be licensed in a format similar to other health care facilities, such as pharmacies.  View Story Delays drive away some investors Months of controversy and bureaucratic delays in the Mass. medical marijuana program have driven away some investors.  She said the revised process will be launched May 15, and will operate on a ‚Äúrolling‚Äù basis, to establish high safety and standards, particularly regarding security and background checks.  Those are two issues that plagued the process under the administration of former governor Patrick.  Bharel also said her agency is preparing the new guidelines, which will also review the current requirement that marijuana companies be non-profit organizations. Marijuana company leaders and some investors have said that requirement has hampered the licensing process and scared away potential investors, leaving some companies short of cash.  Bharel also said that starting Wednesday her agency will post updated information on its website about the status of each of the 15 applicants that have been granted licenses for dispensaries, in addition to information about the numbers of patients certified by their physicians and registered with the state to legally use marijuana for medical use.  Patients, marijuana company executives, and unsuccessful applicants have complained for more than a year that the process under Patrick‚Äôs administration lacked transparency."

bostontrees,31qptw,jeffiethepirate,4,Tue Apr 7 12:41:46 2015 UTC,"By Kay LazarGlobe Staff  April 06, 2015  Months of controversy and bureaucratic delays in the Massachusetts medical marijuana program have driven away some investors, stranding several of the companies awarded the first dispensary licenses and leaving them short on cash.  The uncertainty and mounting costs have pushed back the opening of the first dispensaries -- originally expected last summer ‚Äî to this summer, with some owners now saying they are unlikely to be ready until late this year.  The delay leaves thousands of patients in limbo. State figures show roughly 14,000 patients have received doctor certifications to use marijuana medicinally, and 7,100 of them have completed the state‚Äôs registration process, paying their $50 annual fee to legally shop in the dispensaries.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs despicable,‚Äù said Nichole Snow, deputy director of the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance. ‚ÄúWe need our medicine for relief from serious conditions.‚Äù  Twenty provisional dispensary licenses were initially awarded by the administration of former governor Deval Patrick in January 2014, but regulators were forced to freeze the process soon after, amid questions about applicants‚Äô finances and misrepresentations, along with concerns about potential conflicts of interest and political influence.  Massachusetts had intrigued many potential investors with its 2012 voter-approved law that made the state among the first to adopt a medical marijuana dispensary system. But during the five months the licensing process was put on hold amid controversy last year, at least five other states adopted medical marijuana laws or regulations for dispensary systems.  ‚ÄúWe started looking around, and other investors started looking, and they said Massachusetts is a pain. People got fed up with it, walked away, and went to friendly states, like Illinois,‚Äù said Douglas Leighton, managing director of Dutchess Capital, a Boston venture capital fund.  Leighton has personally bankrolled dispensaries in Washington state, Vermont, and one in Massachusetts, Coastal Compassion Inc. in Fairhaven, which is expected to open in late December.  In addition to the state‚Äôs contentious licensing process, its regulations require dispensary companies to operate as nonprofit organizations, further discouraging investors, Leighton said.  ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt live in the state of Massachusetts my entire life, I wouldn‚Äôt invest [in marijuana companies] here,‚Äù he said.  The dispensary licensing system crafted by the Patrick administration‚Äôs health department is distinctly different from the process the department uses to license other health facilities, such as hospitals. The system for hospitals scrutinizes a facility‚Äôs proposed health services and the need for those services in surrounding communities.  But with dispensaries, potential health services took a back seat to zoning, security, and other considerations, and companies were required to bid for a license in much the same way vendors selling the state computers would vie for the business, known as a government procurement process.  Patrick‚Äôs successor, Governor Charlie Baker, is expected to revamp the medical marijuana program soon.  ‚ÄúThe current administration faults the use of a procurement process, as opposed to a licensing process, faults it for the delay in getting these places open, and getting patients served, and the overall negative public perception that many folks see as an insider‚Äôs game,‚Äù said Tim Buckley, Baker‚Äôs communication director.  William Noyes Webster Foundation Inc., in Dennis, is among the marijuana companies dealing with the fallout from the delays. The company received one of the 15 licenses ultimately awarded by the health department last year. Regulators revoked several other provisional licenses after more carefully vetting the applicants.  William Noyes‚Äôs business plan, similar to those of other applicants, assumed the state would award the full 35 licenses allowed by law, which called for up to five licenses per county. But William Noyes ended up with the only license in Barnstable County.  Scarcity often makes a commodity more valuable ‚Äî and more attractive for investors ‚Äî but for several of the marijuana companies with Massachusetts licenses, it has had unintended consequences. William Noyes suddenly found itself unprepared to grow the amount of marijuana needed to serve many more patients. The company realized it would need a cultivation facility at least three times as large.  ‚ÄúAll of a sudden, the cost of putting the whole thing together escalated, and when it did, our backers didn‚Äôt have the money to do the deal,‚Äù said Paul Covell, William Noyes‚Äôs chief executive.  The company is talking to potential investors, and Covell said the prospect of a 2016 state ballot initiative to legalize marijuana for recreational use has intrigued investors. Many observers expect the initiative to include a provision that will give preference to existing medicinal dispensaries to win licenses for recreational sales.  Despite its setback, William Noyes expects to open later this year.  Executives at two other dispensary companies declined to speak publicly about their financing challenges, saying they feared any publicity after last year‚Äôs tumultuous process might jeopardize their company‚Äôs license.  But a consultant who advised four successful Massachusetts applicants said the financing problems William Noyes faced were not unusual.  ‚ÄúEven groups that were fully capitalized have had to raise significantly more money,‚Äù to expand cultivation centers, said Kris Krane, managing partner of 4Front Advisors, a consulting company.  Krane said cultivation centers are the most expensive part of the business, because they require sophisticated lighting, heating, and air conditioning systems. The state‚Äôs licensing process under the Patrick administration awarded extra points to applicants who had secured a cultivation site when they applied. Several companies leased buildings during the application process, without having the chance to scrutinize the buildings‚Äô infrastructure, Krane said.  Many discovered that structures were in worse shape than previously thought, and faced upgrades of $1 million more than anticipated, Krane said.  ‚ÄúThere is generally more erosion in buildings in the Northeast,‚Äù said Krane, who previously advised marijuana companies in more temperate climates.  ‚ÄúSome of this is new, even for industry veterans,‚Äù Krane said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a pretty universal challenge here.‚Äù  Still, industry leaders said they believe the worst of the licensing-related problems are behind them.  ‚ÄúAll new industries face challenges, but Commonwealth Dispensary Association members are confident that the process is moving forward in a responsible manner,‚Äù Kevin Gilnack, the trade association‚Äôs executive director, said in a statement.  ‚ÄúIn the coming months, we expect that some dispensaries will be in a position to begin providing patients with medicine, and more will complete the licensing process,‚Äù he said.

So a MA resident with a shiny MA mmj card can purchase medical cannabis in Portland (with a small amount of additional paperwork).  But a ME resident cannot do the same in Boston. MA dispensaries cannot sell to anyone but MA resident patients.    It's stupid, and it is wrong, and it is how the system has been set up here."
bostontrees,31nu9d,member_member5thNov,3,Tue Apr 7 00:57:26 2015 UTC,What about if I'm carrying my medical stash with me in MA but with a Maine card? Am I now criminally liable under MA legal statutes?
bostontrees,31nu9d,OnlyMySofaPullsOut,2,Tue Apr 7 01:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, sadly you are. Only MA cards are valid here.  Upside being that Massachusetts decriminalized an Oz and under.

bostontrees,31nu9d,LED_oneshot,2,Tue Apr 7 19:24:35 2015 UTC,A few people on this sub already have. Or at least reported doing so.  They did so by filling out more paperwork. Does ME just have a program for out of state patients? or where those dispensaries in error selling to them?
bostontrees,31nu9d,member_member5thNov,3,Tue Apr 7 19:28:47 2015 UTC,Looks like it is one specific card issuer that is doing it and only some ME dispensaries. It doesn't seem to be the norm. I know MA patients are definitely not allowed to buy from RI dispensaries but we can get from caregivers.  http://www.d9medical.com/ http://www.d9medical.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Maine.pdf

That is too bad, more generally, I'm going to be in Maine for a few weeks this summer and was looking forward to using their dispensaries.  Reciprocity is the next frontier for medical marijuana. Weirdly I think the state reciprocity on concealed handgun legislation that many states have introduced in the last ten years is the best model for multistate reciprocity for medical cards."
bostontrees,31nu9d,member_member5thNov,3,Tue Apr 7 19:45:36 2015 UTC,As long as you have a MA driver's license you can get a MA med card. But that isn't so much a work around as it is actually establishing MA residency.

bostontrees,30ijo0,member_member5thNov,2,Fri Mar 27 18:11:02 2015 UTC,Hot tea is an old hippie trick to bring it on faster. If nothing is happening in twenty-thirty minutes after the tea nothing is probably going to happen.  Edibles usually work better if they follow something you ate.  But sometimes they are also just don't work at all.

bostontrees,30e3yx,member_member5thNov,3,Thu Mar 26 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's very interesting being in the science part of this field, especially as its just starting up.

There's a lot of variability within the strain. This doesn't mean there is nothing relating the Blue Dreams, but Max THC potency is not the common factor.  Edit: link fix"
bostontrees,30e3yx,member_member5thNov,2,Thu Mar 26 19:01:57 2015 UTC,Do you think there is that much variance within strains or that they aren't all the same thing?

Caregivers who brought these to MCR Labs to get cannabinoid profiles said this was Blue Dream, which is the same thing they likely tell their patients. They may have been misinformed.   To say for sure, to have an accurate genetic test, who will be the authority on what is genetically Blue Dream? If 3 major seed companies claim to have Blue Dream but their products differ - then what do we call Blue Dream?"

You won't get dehydrated from eating fruit.  And you can eat as much as you want without feeling utterly disgusting.

bostontrees,300ka4,LED_oneshot,2,Mon Mar 23 15:16:27 2015 UTC,We are very actively working on it - we know how important this is!
bostontrees,300ka4,darkrom,4,Mon Mar 23 16:02:58 2015 UTC,Sadly it might be less important if the DPH is really limiting the use of solvents to Co2 more or less. :(
bostontrees,300ka4,LED_oneshot,3,Mon Mar 23 18:01:42 2015 UTC,The DPH is not limiting to just Co2. Co2 isn't even an approved solvent according to the regulations. It's the fire departments that are the issue.
bostontrees,300ka4,darkrom,3,Mon Mar 23 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"Ahhh ok so the fire department is the one saying no butane, and now no co2?  I thought Co2 was all was all we were getting here?  Its almost like they just want us to stick to dirty ass finger hash lol."

The cannabinoid profile, our most popular test, is $50 for any type of sample. We quantitate 10 cannabinoids and give you the option to post results to our website.   We need 0.3 grams flower, 0.2 grams extracts, or one serving for edibles."

bostontrees,300ka4,darkrom,4,Mon Mar 23 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"Hey guys- What's your favorite strain? What has had the highest (hehe) potency you've tested?  Also, I've been seeing some stuff coming out with claims of pure (98 or 99%) thc or cbd. It basically looks like crack or coke (just a crystalline or powder substance). Any thoughts on that? Is it actually possible to refine to that level?"
bostontrees,300ka4,reddan,3,Mon Mar 23 15:46:20 2015 UTC,"Hey! Favorite strain: to each his or her own, and depends on mood, of course. Some favorites: Kosher Kush Mothership Crippy Green Crack  Its certainly possible to refine a product to that level, and it should look like a white or off-white powder when it gets there. That said, to truly trust a claim like that I would have it tested for potency by a third party."
bostontrees,300ka4,reddan,3,Mon Mar 23 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"Haha I wanted to save the sample I got and send it to you...but I smoked it. That said, it didn't get me any more or less high than anything else I've smoked. If I see it again I'll save some and send it over."

bostontrees,300ka4,jeffiethepirate,2,Mon Mar 23 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"Probably just synthetic THC blends :/    I'd be very careful smoking loose powders sold as ... well anything really.

bostontrees,300ka4,darkrom,4,Mon Mar 23 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"There are some fertilizers that could have plant growth regulators, or that might contain heavy metals, both of which may be much more toxic than butane.   Butane itself is not very toxic. There may be other contaminants found with butane that are much more toxic. Also, it doesn't taste very good when you inhale it.  We do test for heavy metals but not for butane or or PGRs just yet."

bostontrees,300ka4,BDH420,3,Mon Mar 23 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"Not everyone has to be a patient to work here, although many of us are patients. We are going to be dispensary agents to work with RMDs, however.  Most potent THC: Wizard Tears Double Double by The Boston Bake Shop  Edit for clarity  Most potent CBD: Harlequin Live Resin by Remydees"

Its awesome to see how much MA is stepping things up.  Love seeing high CBD stuff around.  A couple of years ago no one gave a shit about anything other than THC content."
bostontrees,300ka4,reddan,2,Mon Mar 23 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"So basically going by these results, decarbing your product will artificially increase your THC results in your tests?Something about that in your tests hasn't sat right with me for a long time."
bostontrees,300ka4,BlankittyBlank,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:15:54 2015 UTC,"Good point!! If we are going by THC Max then yes this gets inflated - 100% THCA will read as 87.7% THC Max. At the same time, 90% THC will read as 90% THC Max.  So in this case, one gram of Wizard Tears will have at most 884 mg THC  One gram of this Starlet Kush (87.5% THCA, 4% THC) will have at most (0.8778*875 + 40) = 807.4 mg THC  We calculate this way to measure how much THC can theoretically be had from that product, because that's the psychoactive molecule. We assume perfect decarboxylation of THCA to THC in that calculation.  edit example"
bostontrees,300ka4,lucrativelion,2,Mon Mar 23 18:38:15 2015 UTC,Maybe an additional metric of Total THC is more appropriate? What are your thoughts?

bostontrees,2zrs3i,darkrom,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:09:18 2015 UTC,"Housing gets complicated because much reduced or publicly supported housing is funded by federal grants. Since it is still very much federally illegal there are multiple provisions punishing breaking federal law while receiving federal funds. It makes a big difference if they are section 8 renting, in city public housing, or any of the other dozens of very complex subsidized housing scenerios.  I'm not at all sure what your friend's specific situation is but I'm guessing those are factors in it.   However, at least in my city, the medical marijuana law has been considered to trump city ordinances banning smoking in public housing enacted by the city."

bostontrees,2zrs3i,therealbigbudz,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:18:29 2015 UTC,Sure you can get your med card if you have a FID. But it is possible that you may then lose your FID.    You'd need to ask someone who knows more about MA and federal gun laws. We're mostly just potheads here. try the mass firearm sub reddit.  All the worry about the implication of a med card for gun ownership is on the gun end not the pot end. I believe the marijuana question on the licensing is a federal requirement.  But I would say that California has successfully had a med program for near on two decades and there must be thousands of people already dealing with this issue.

bostontrees,2zlj18,darkrom,6,Thu Mar 19 18:55:00 2015 UTC,All this proves is that crystals fall off the buds into the shake. Would love to see what they both test at after they both are bounced on a screen.
bostontrees,2zlj18,danzello,3,Thu Mar 19 18:06:19 2015 UTC,"It depends how the bud was stored and what you consider shake. If you've got a big bag where a lot of kief has fallen off, the bottom of that bag will be as strong or stronger than the bud. If the ""shake"" is mostly made up of sweetleaf trimmed off buds, that will be lower strength than flower."

bostontrees,2zi2wg,darkrom,7,Wed Mar 18 19:58:58 2015 UTC,MCR Labs is a Cannabis testing and research Laboratory. We provide cannabis testing for patients and caregivers - to know whether the product is right for them. We provide full cannabinoid profiles and do contaminant screening. We also work with growers and extract artists to help them improve their work by knowing whats in their products.
bostontrees,2zi2wg,darkrom,7,Wed Mar 18 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Hey Rob, thanks for posting!  I'd like to see and hear more things from people in the legitimate industry on BostonTrees.  It keeps us entertained and educated."
bostontrees,2zi2wg,jeffiethepirate,6,Wed Mar 18 21:17:52 2015 UTC,Thats great to hear! We'll keep posting!
bostontrees,2zi2wg,danzello,5,Wed Mar 18 22:22:33 2015 UTC,Do you know what the final regulations are for dispensaries? I know every strain will need to be lab tested right? Hopefully by independent labs like you guys?  Every batch or once per strain etc?  I really hope the dispensaries I use get tested by you guys.  I submitted my oil WAY back to you guys via Bill D haha.
bostontrees,2zi2wg,jeffiethepirate,3,Wed Mar 18 22:59:52 2015 UTC,"Hey Rom! I remember your Blue Dream shatter, it was the first shatter we ever ran for a client!  Yes everything from dispensaries has to be tested by an independent, ISO-17025 accredited laboratory. Each batch has to be tested. The bigger the batch, the more subsamples from that batch have to be tested, and a batch will be made of one strain."
bostontrees,2zi2wg,danzello,3,Thu Mar 19 02:12:17 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome.  How many other accredited labs are there? I hope the go with you over the other guys as I totally trust your results and I've definitely seen some fishy numbers from other labs.

bostontrees,2zfmvj,BluntsWithHash,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:09:16 2015 UTC,I dunno. haven't been downstairs in a bit. Never used to be a problem but not sure of current policy. They used to wristband and stamp and you could come and go at will.  If you can go out for a cigarette you can have a joint and it'll be no problem.

bostontrees,2zdxbn,darkrom,3,Tue Mar 17 20:32:47 2015 UTC,That stuff looks SO good.  So whats the latest on dispensary concentrates?  We in stock for a shitload of Co2 and nothing else?
bostontrees,2zdxbn,darkrom,4,Tue Mar 17 20:42:07 2015 UTC,yep
bostontrees,2zdxbn,darkrom,3,Tue Mar 17 21:13:24 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about co2 as someone who has bho dialed in damn perfectly?  Strictly as a consumer I think its great because you don't have to worry about crappy oil with solvent in it, but at the same time it automatically excludes high end oil like yours.   I kind of feel like it pushes everything into a middle of the game oil.  Definitely safe and clean, but probably no crazy terps.   Unless they have made major improvements to co2 oil.    I've been dabbing some co2 oil that is high in cbds and very low THC, but it almost tastes like alcohol so I'm wondering if it was thinned out somehow.  Gotta purge it anyway."
bostontrees,2zdxbn,darkrom,3,Tue Mar 17 21:52:44 2015 UTC,I am still 100% against it but it is not a fight I am going to win right now with our schedule. Too many moving parts to get away from Co2.   I wouldn't say it excludes higher end oil. If I end up running the co2 machine (current plans are to have the chef do it but he falls under my management) then I am going to do my damnedest(sp?) to get the best co2 oil possible. It's a completely new process to me so learning and getting to a point where I am comfortable and producing quality product will be awhile. I won't be putting anything out that isn't purged of all the water and polished up.   If it tastes like alcohol it sounds like they didn't finish evaporating off all the ethanol when winterizing it.

bostontrees,2z79rv,member_member5thNov,2,Mon Mar 16 12:40:16 2015 UTC,Guess I'll try there as well.  I was just hoping since this place was so close.  It's quite a bit more though.  Looks like it'll be $350 but they said they give you something to file with insurance that could cover the visit.  Any of you do that?
bostontrees,2z79rv,member_member5thNov,6,Mon Mar 16 14:17:26 2015 UTC,That is significantly more cash than anywhere else. I do believe there might be an option in Salem that is even under $200.   Keep in mind it is also an additional $50 to the state on top of whatever any pot doc charges you for a consultation.   If you are in Cambridge just remember it is a short redline ride to the southie cannacare. From East Cambridge/Somerville you've got some other green and orange line accessible options as well.  I'd be delighted to support a cambridge based place but those prices are out of line with other doc's offices.
bostontrees,2z79rv,darkrom,4,Mon Mar 16 16:41:22 2015 UTC,Highly doubt your insurance company will actually pay you anything since they aren't required to.  Also thats crazy high price....  Everywhere else is $200.
bostontrees,2z79rv,jeffiethepirate,4,Mon Mar 16 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah This is the first I have ever heard about a company giving anyone information for insurance. and 350 is outrageous.

bostontrees,2yy8y6,Patisagod,2,Sat Mar 14 00:34:44 2015 UTC,"Very good to know. I've seen it on GrubHub for a while now and have considered using it but haven't pulled the trigger. Any idea how it's configured? I assume they don't have their own inventory, do they just stop at a store and buy the stuff you order or have partnerships with various stores? And sorry for peppering you with questions, but what's been the average for delivery times?"
bostontrees,2yy8y6,Kingindanorff,1 point,Sat Mar 14 18:38:09 2015 UTC,"No worries dude no worries!  I'm not really sure where the items come from... But if you download the app the inventory is always updated with what's in/out of stock.  I've never really investigated it.  The app is the way to go, some of the prices on foodler/grubhub are definitely raised.  First time I ordered was from foodler and the delivery driver showed up with a pamphlet explaining why ordering direct was better... And 15% off my next order!  The longest delivery time I've experienced was 45mins on a Friday night.  And by ""night"" I mean 1-2am in the morning lol.  The shortest has been under 20mins which left me baffled.  They even throw in a free gift every now and then.  I've received a couple lighters (complete with bottle opener attachment).  And a buddy of mine got a free plastic grinder.  Not the top of the line, but still pretty cool."

My friend got one of the iTaste MVP vapes. That thing is sweet. Battery is great on it, and you have full control over the voltage to control your heat. If you get harsh hits, cool it down a little and you conserve battery and wind up with better tasting hits, etc. It's about $100 but I think he needed to get the right attachment for it. It comes with a couple, but not the right ones for wax."
bostontrees,2yxkgm,Handsomeme,2,Fri Mar 13 18:54:52 2015 UTC,"For me the Pax seems worth it. I need to get into that vape lyfe since the smoking can be harsh on my lungs‚Äì plus it's more discreet and I can only smoke outside. But I would never pay full price for it. Definitely in the market for a used one though, I'm definitely thinking about it!"
bostontrees,2yxkgm,Im_A_Steam_Shovel,3,Fri Mar 13 18:43:42 2015 UTC,"Yea I had smoked herbs every day forever. Always a cougher. I got into oils about two years ago and my lungs feel a lot better. I primarily smoke wax/oil but a little flower as well. I usually don't cough at all even if it's flower, huge bong rips, gravities, whatever. Switching to wax helped me out a lot."
bostontrees,2yxkgm,ShpongledPanda,2,Fri Mar 13 18:46:47 2015 UTC,Pax is definitely worth it. Coming from someone who's owned it for almost two years.

bostontrees,2yxity,Casem0,3,Fri Mar 13 22:54:44 2015 UTC,Wish someone would answer this. Second time hearing about it and I have no clue exactly what it is.

bostontrees,2yxity,member_member5thNov,2,Fri Mar 13 18:23:14 2015 UTC,I heard it got shut down
bostontrees,2yxity,jeffiethepirate,4,Sat Mar 14 14:17:34 2015 UTC,It didn't get shut down completely. The fire alarms went off because the event oversold their abilities to handle the vaping. Everyone had to clear out but people came back but they weren't allowed to dab. They announced the winner (me) at 12 and then we all left.
bostontrees,2yxity,LED_oneshot,2,Sat Mar 14 17:05:16 2015 UTC,Congrats man!!!!!!!!!

Pretty sweet though until the fire alarm, the two ceiling fans just weren't gonna cut it with all that dabbage. Also, got a chance to try some of that moonshine haze yesterday, crazy terps, appropriately named deliciousness."

bostontrees,2ywes6,0012399457,0,Fri Mar 13 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think I would recommend supporting anything Frank Shaw is involved with. The guy is super sketchy. I have heard some really unsavory things about his predatory nature towards younger men/teens. I'm really not sure what his angle is with this Cannabis Society thing but it seems very strange to me. I noticed a few months ago that Frank is one of the founders of this group and showed it to my friends who used to rent an apartment from him (the most disgusting piece of shit place I've ever seen) and they all thought it was completely bizarre. I mean maybe the guy's attitude on pot has changed, but my impression is he is not a cool guy."
bostontrees,2ywes6,MichaelLatulippe,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:47:48 2015 UTC,"This is totally ridiculous.  Frank is an HIV Positive man of some 15+ years and is a survivor not only of disease but of being persecuted by the local community and others who were homophobic.  According to every bigot, gay men are predators and I have no doubt this post is rooted in bigotry against homosexuals.  Cannabis Society accepts all races, creeds, and sexual orientations.  This kind of ignorance has no place in the cannabis community and certainly the Wicked Good Weed Expo will be a testament to the openness of our group and the weed community in New England."
bostontrees,2ysfks,ebenny,10,Thu Mar 12 12:55:24 2015 UTC,Huge news for NH.  Iirc they were very tough on possession of small amounts.
bostontrees,2ysfks,therealbigbudz,5,Thu Mar 12 15:04:23 2015 UTC,Felony up to a year in jail and $2000 fine for possessing under an ounce.
bostontrees,2ysfks,therealbigbudz,6,Thu Mar 12 18:00:50 2015 UTC,Now that should be criminal
bostontrees,2ysfks,member_member5thNov,6,Thu Mar 12 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"They brought the amount down to 1/2 ounce, but it's progress. The bill now goes to the NH Senate, which will be a much harder sell."
bostontrees,2ysfks,darkrom,3,Thu Mar 12 13:02:55 2015 UTC,Not even a full ounce? still better than nothing.
bostontrees,2ysfks,darkrom,3,Thu Mar 12 13:57:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, step in the right direction. Let's hope the Senate doesn't modify it further."

bostontrees,2ysfks,member_member5thNov,2,Sun Mar 15 16:25:59 2015 UTC,They could kick it down the road until early next year. Let's hope the overwhelming yes vote will force them to take it up sooner.

Just make sure that once you get the state issued ID you carry it all the time. Better safe than sorry, but having the card should have no major impact on your life in these ways."
bostontrees,2ypdcc,jeffiethepirate,3,Wed Mar 11 18:34:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the quick response! Can you think of anything else that you might not be unsure of either? Just so the community can also chime in on them.
bostontrees,2ypdcc,jeffiethepirate,2,Wed Mar 11 18:52:21 2015 UTC,/u/thatssomething mentioned job issues. Answered that below.
bostontrees,2ypdcc,darkrom,2,Wed Mar 11 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"How about operating vehicles while under the influence? If I was medicated but still functional, what would happen?"
bostontrees,2ypdcc,jeffiethepirate,4,Wed Mar 11 19:34:10 2015 UTC,If you are stopped you NEVER admit to anything.  You would have to fail a field sobriety test if you admit nothing.
bostontrees,2ypdcc,thatssomething,2,Thu Mar 12 10:30:59 2015 UTC,"Well you aren't allowed to medicate while driving, and they are coming out with breathalyzers that detect thc, but not sure on how police will conduct theyselves"
bostontrees,2ypdcc,darkrom,5,Wed Mar 11 19:48:39 2015 UTC,I can't answer you questions but would be interested to know how it would affect someone in a job that drug tests
bostontrees,2ypdcc,Palindromer101,4,Wed Mar 11 18:55:40 2015 UTC,You are not protected against discrimination here in MA. If you get drug tested and then tell them about your MMJ they can tell you that's nice and fire you anyway.  So shitty.
bostontrees,2ypdcc,darkrom,3,Thu Mar 12 10:29:56 2015 UTC,"Well, that needs to change..."
bostontrees,2ypdcc,darkrom,3,Thu Mar 12 10:53:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it won't.  Their argument is that it is federally illegal.  When there is a federally sanctioned MMJ law, then they should be able to argue discrimination successfully.  I'm not SURE, but I think that Rhode Island has an anti-discrimination clause or something.   Some employers might allow it with a MMJ card, others won't.  They don't have to by any means.  It could spell bad publicity for them though if you were to threaten to make a big stink.  I know if I had a planned drug test scheduled I'd use synthetic piss anyway."
bostontrees,2ypdcc,thatssomething,2,Thu Mar 12 12:21:50 2015 UTC,"So if they randomly drug test me and I pass, can they still fire me under the pretense that i'm still doing something federally illegal?"
bostontrees,2ypdcc,jeffiethepirate,2,Fri Mar 13 02:47:27 2015 UTC,If you pass why would they fire you? They won't know you are a mmj patient unless you tell them.
bostontrees,2ypdcc,Palindromer101,2,Fri Mar 13 02:53:06 2015 UTC,Well that sucks
bostontrees,2ypdcc,jeffiethepirate,2,Thu Mar 12 11:59:33 2015 UTC,"If your job drug test, confirm if they are testing for cannabis. If so, having a med card could possibly save you. As it is not just recreational but medicinal. But companies can make their own choices on that. No real answer that i know of."
bostontrees,2ypdcc,Palindromer101,3,Wed Mar 11 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"So far, having my med card hasn't changed anything. Since there are no dispensaries up and running yet and I haven't found a caregiver, I'm still getting bud and dabs through the black market. I really hope MA gets the ball rolling on getting these places open."
bostontrees,2ypdcc,jeffiethepirate,2,Thu Mar 12 10:54:52 2015 UTC,Tried any delivery services?
bostontrees,2ypdcc,Palindromer101,3,Thu Mar 12 10:59:09 2015 UTC,"I have been in touch with xotic, but I haven't ordered anything because, and I know this is cliche, but their prices are higher than I'm used to and I can buy similar quality on the black market."
bostontrees,2ypdcc,jeffiethepirate,2,Thu Mar 12 11:16:32 2015 UTC,"It is pretty high priced, the quality is pretty good though. They work in a pinch."
bostontrees,2ypdcc,Palindromer101,3,Thu Mar 12 11:19:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think I'll give them a go though. The quality of bud I've been buying from my friend lately hasn't been the best, so I think I'll try xotic because they had some purple bud that looked incredible."
bostontrees,2ypdcc,jeffiethepirate,2,Thu Mar 12 11:27:25 2015 UTC,"Just got some Sour D from them, fantastical stuff"
bostontrees,2ypdcc,Palindromer101,2,Thu Mar 12 11:33:38 2015 UTC,I just shot them over an email. Hopefully they can help me out before I go to work at noon. Lol. We'll see. Thanks for suggesting them. They posted a picture of some purple weed on their IG account the other day and it looked amazing. I hope they still have some.

I have mine for depression and pain management. My mother-in-law got hers to treat arthritis and insomnia. You dont need to go to your primary physician if you chose to go to a MMJ clinic, just speak to one of the doctors there and they will determine if cannabis is going to help you. Which for most conditions it will."
bostontrees,2yoj8i,jeffiethepirate,5,Wed Mar 11 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you this is very helpful. I'm also in the depression, anxiety and insomnia boat. I'm currently living out of state (but will be moving back to MA this summer), so I'm totally unfamiliar with the whole process."
bostontrees,2yoj8i,jeffiethepirate,4,Wed Mar 11 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"No problem, It helps with all of those immensely. Just make sure you get the right strains to help you out."
bostontrees,2yoj8i,Wetzilla,4,Wed Mar 11 15:34:39 2015 UTC,"It CAN help with all those immensely, but it also can make depression and anxiety worse. People react to it differently, it's important for some people to know that it might not actually help them, and that they should also try pursuing other treatments for those issues."
bostontrees,2yoj8i,jeffiethepirate,5,Wed Mar 11 16:19:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I am a big big supporter of medical cannabis, but that doesnt mean that its a cure all. There are so many strains and methods that people have to find what works for them. And sometimes, cannabis doesnt work well at all"

bostontrees,2yoj8i,jeffiethepirate,5,Wed Mar 11 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"No she used to smoke when she was younger, but she saw a lot of the things I post on FB, IG etc and just kind of asked me about it.   So I started talking with her, my wife and her were both concerned that the other would judge them. Until we went over there and I brought a ton of studies and paperwork, explained it to her.  She took one hit with us, then a few more, but hasn't smoked in 20+ years ish?  So she got a tad freaked out, too much for her. But tried it again the next day, took one small hit. Felt great the rest of the day. We gave her a small supply and I took her to MMJ Physicians in Salem, got her card and reupped my wife and mines as well.  Took her to Witch Dr. Got her a PAX, which she likes a lot more.  Then we ate lobster rolls."

bostontrees,2ykjlu,checosafai,7,Tue Mar 10 16:16:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not currently in the custom game per se, but i often take requests on specific colors or variations of my existing designs such as penguin dabbers or ice cube pendants etc.   Lately i have more ideas than i have time to make those ideas into a physical piece so i have to get my own ""custom"" ideas out of the way before i take on someone else's.... I think this is something many glassblowers experience once their skill level opens up more and more possibilities."

bostontrees,2ykjlu,jojos_mojo,3,Tue Mar 10 16:24:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer! Totally understandable.   PS - your penguin dabbers are ridiculously cute and they pretty much make me want to start dabbing.
bostontrees,2ykjlu,Sirbubbles710,6,Tue Mar 10 16:24:54 2015 UTC,Thanks! Those were an outgrowth of these very small penguins i used to make when i used to do craft shows. All of my work was a bit too pricey for that crowd and i made tiny penguins to have a cheap item that would get people into the booth and buying. They became really popular and kind of backfired in a way because it seldom led to bigger sales and i ended up becoming the penguin guy but once i started into the pipe world i embraced it and modified them to become dabbers. I really like the fact that it's a link to my older work and my journey as an artist!
bostontrees,2ykjlu,Sirbubbles710,3,Tue Mar 10 16:32:17 2015 UTC,"Aw that's great it lead you to a lot of opportunities. Good luck with the art, even though I'm sure you've heard it many times looove the penguins"
bostontrees,2ykjlu,Sirbubbles710,5,Wed Mar 11 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"What was the point in your life where you said ""hey I could make a living at doing what I love"" and dropped the normal lifestyle to support lampworking? Also anything specific that helped you get started?  Thanks for doing this btw."
bostontrees,2ykjlu,RobertoBroberto,7,Tue Mar 10 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"Another awesome question, this is fun! I started lampworking at the age of 21 back in 2004. Honestly i was too young and naive to realize how hard one must work to be self-made but I am so glad that i pushed through and made it happen. I had to forego the money, the stability and security of a regular paycheck, but that really made me hustle! What really helped me was my own background as a drummer. I've played drums for over 20 years (i'm now 32) and back when i started lampworking i knew that, just like drumming, persistence and hard work would make me proficient. I also knew how to build a style from drumming so I applied those ideas to lampwork and kept at it. I'm the kind of person who has respect for a craft to a point that i feel i should ""pay my dues"" before publicly displaying my work or feeling that its anywhere near up to snuff, as i had learned from music. ultimately i choose my own path and take responsibility for that, wherever it may lead. The actual point where i stopped doubting that i could do this full time came only a few years back maybe in 2011, because i was having serious doubts about being able to support myself when i was doing jewelry and sculpture at craft shows. now that i have no doubts, I can focus on my work and truly open up to the possibilites!"
bostontrees,2ykjlu,drinktobones,3,Tue Mar 10 17:39:09 2015 UTC,I really appreciate that answer. You are definitely  the type of artist I love to support. Modest yet confident and you have an actually understanding and love for the artist rather than just a cheap dollar to be made. You are exactly what this world needs in a person.

bostontrees,2ykjlu,xSlats,4,Tue Mar 10 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"It's just refreshing to hear and see such a baller of  a glass artist that has respect and love for the culture. Some artists lose touch with the culture and turn eveything into a profit.   So no, thank you."
bostontrees,2ykjlu,connor726,4,Tue Mar 10 17:55:02 2015 UTC,Can you speak to your transition from glass art and sculptures to functional pieces and pipes? Was that driven by the greater demand for functional glass or something else?
bostontrees,2ykjlu,connor726,9,Tue Mar 10 17:02:52 2015 UTC,"Good question! I was making my living doing retail at craft shows up and down new england, It was fun in the beginning but i got pretty burnt out. I was doing 20+ shows a year and the run up to christmas was about half of my revenue for the year. I paid attention to trends, made my process quicker and developed products in the right price point... I was making turtle and flower pendants, christmas ornaments, tiny penguins, bracelets, earrings etc. but for what? to do it again next year? I was sacrificing passion for a paycheck and making a bunch of products that were under my skill level and hampering my growth. That's when i realized i was just working to live and had lost the initial and original reason for getting into making glass, which was to grow and challenge myself!  So after seeing my contemporaries like joe peters and even my teacher robert mickelsen (RAM) move from purely art glass to making pipes i said ""what's stopping me from doing that? Only myself!"" and so I stopped doing shows and began exploring all the ideas i had for making cool pipes that i would want to own myself and would be proud to call my work. The pipe movement allowed me to explore a darker side and not worry so much about pleasing people and making stereotypically ""cute"" work. I would've never been able to sculpt skulls and make ""death goddesses"" and sell them at craft shows. That market was too family focused, older and clean to be able to satisfy my own artistic needs. Also many people who attended those shows had a wal-mart mentality and i just couldn't stand to hear the word ""expensive"" one more time lol. So i got on instagram and realized there was a much more appreciative and art-loving community that embraced me for what I wanted to do, and i ran with it! Iam forever appreciative of all the folks at the craft shows who DID understand the value of my work and they frankly told me i shouldn't be there, i should be making better art, so i finally listend to them, I made that transition in 2012 -2013. Thank you!!"

bostontrees,2ykjlu,jeffiethepirate,4,Tue Mar 10 19:19:11 2015 UTC,What's your best advise for someone looking to find an apprenticeship?
bostontrees,2ykjlu,kimo0_0,3,Tue Mar 10 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"start by familiarizing yourself with how this is done, watch youtube, read contemporary lampworking, and soak up knowledge by watching someone work, if they'll let you. Find a glassblower who is willing to teach you and offer something to them in return, be clear about your terms at least for the near future and put in 10 hours a day once you get a torch haha. If you can only do it part time or in small chunks of time, try to do it often enough that you can make progress, at least four three-hour sessions per week. there are also formal glass classes taught at colleges and universities that offer lampworking. hope that helps!"
bostontrees,2ykjlu,MassachusEnt,4,Tue Mar 10 20:35:36 2015 UTC,When did you try glass blowing for the first time?
bostontrees,2ykjlu,MassachusEnt,3,Tue Mar 10 20:44:44 2015 UTC,"summer 2004, i took a rod of glass and heated it, gathered up a ball and flattened it to create whats called a maria and began adding bits of color to try an implosion style pendant, the first month or two i didn't do any glassblowing, it was all solid work using rods of clear glass and color glass and then shaping that glass with heat and graphite tools, i got hooked pretty quickly and after a year of messing around i decided to do it full time..."
bostontrees,2ykjlu,pettercottonmouth,4,Tue Mar 10 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"Hey Chaka! Hope I'm not too late to ask questions! I met you briefly at the Boston Freedom Rally this year, and a good friend owns a slyme penguin and ice cube drip pendant that I always love to sesh. I'm hoping to pick up some of your work at the show on the 28th!   To get to my question, I'd like to know what led you to the motifs you use in your glass blowing? It's awesome to see the variety of penguins, ice cubes, and reefs that you put out and the various twists on that style. What inspired you to use these themes? And what are some you hope to try out in the future (potentially of course)?"
bostontrees,2ykjlu,leola710,4,Tue Mar 10 21:31:31 2015 UTC,"very good question! the penguins came from my craft shows when i used to make nonfunctional work, they were small and i sold them as figurines. Once i went full on making pipes i knew they would be a popular motif and i wanted to find a way to make a small signature piece that i could produce enough of to get it into peoples hands. I thought about pointing the beak up and making them bigger and voila - The Penguin Dabber was born! The ice cubes came as an extension of that motif and it really hit me on a hot summer day in june or july of 2013 when i was cooling my brow with an ice cube from the shop fridge. I was already making some work with clear drips on it and the idea came to me of a dripping cube pendant, it took awhile for the idea to evolve but i'm really glad i stuck with it because glass is really the only medium where i'm able to express such an idea and freeze it in time (pun intended). The reef stuff comes from my teachers milon townsend and robert mickelsen whose work i draw a fair amount of inspiration from, even though it's been years since learning from them. I started sculpting octopus about 2 years after i began lampwork and they looked better and better as i progressed. I also used to make these simply as sculptures and  wanted to eventually incorporate it into a functional piece. I found it to be a good way to distinguish myself even though there are many artists who do aquatic motifs. Mine looked like mine because my hand had evolved over the years and so it was still distinctive despite the widespread use of that theme. Each motif really takes time to develop into a style so I have built up a backlog of ideas that i want to eventually pursue such as a series of pipes that are not even functional but are purely art. Basically flipping the whole idea of art that are pipes on its head. I really want to make a sherlock or bubbler or spoon that has no holes and sits on your table as an ""ode to pipes"" haha. but i digress.... the current motifs i'm using are enough to keep me busy for a lifetime!"
bostontrees,2ykjlu,leola710,2,Tue Mar 10 21:57:19 2015 UTC,"My apologies for being so late, but thanks for responding! Really cool to hear about your ideas"
bostontrees,2ykjlu,leola710,2,Mon Mar 16 22:04:28 2015 UTC,Thanks again!  I have a question!  What piece are you most proud of making?
bostontrees,2ykjlu,therealbigbudz,4,Tue Mar 10 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"For technique and skill I really enjoyed making the Death goddess series because human form is hard to nail down and I loved using that to learn how to sculpt hands. But honestly, I'm proud and happy to make a perfect penguin dabber. My journey over the last few years consisted largely of making repetitive, small pieces of sculpture and jewelry. Through that process the hand evolves and eventually perfects the moves needed to make those pieces. It is a beautiful thing when all the color works perfectly smooth, when the curves line up in a way that pleases the eye, and when the finished piece has a prototypical ""perfect"" and cohesive quality to it. This doesn't happen everyday but when it does, the feeling is amazing. It's also very subconcious and only occurs when the hand has been trained. That's why I stress to my students the importance of repetition and process. Thanks!"
bostontrees,2ykjlu,danzello,2,Tue Mar 10 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"You have students?  I have no artistic ability. (seriously, all my stick figures have scoliosis) But my wife is VERY interested in learning the trade!"
bostontrees,2ykjlu,danzello,5,Tue Mar 10 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"Haha, right now I have a full time apprentice which keeps me busy but I offer lessons in my studio for 1 student at a time, unfortunately we don't have space for students to practice, some people have their own setups so they take a lesson on making cane for example and then practice at home... pm me for rates if you're interested, thanks jeff!"

I think its years of abusing my body skateboarding + the generally miserable posture of IT work and generally being attached to a PC since I was very young.  I expect the only way to progress is exercise, since no doctor can find a single thing wrong.  Since they can't find anything that kind of rules out a lot of the scarier stuff.  Its both good and bad that they have no idea lol."

bostontrees,2ygh7t,PotViking,5,Mon Mar 9 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"It is very hard to actively ride a bike and smoke a joint. It can be done but you lose a lot of the joint to the wind. Usually it is better to get high then cycle.   In Amsterdam I'm extremely law abiding and mostly only smoke in Coffeeshops. They are so great! and cozy! and they went to all the trouble of setting up nice indoor places to hang out and smoke pot, it seems rude not to use them.  Mostly the dutch cops will just yell at and shame you if you are breaking the law. (It's kind of awesome. Ever wanted some jackhole to pay for being a douchenozzle in public? watching dutch cops yell at someone for bad behaviour is just so great. ""You are a stupid person doing a stupid thing!"" true life quote). But yeah, you can get in trouble. It goes yelling, fine, jail so if you are just smoking a joint you probably aren't going to be arrested.  Honestly it is the cycle part that makes Amsterdam so great for hicycling. It is totally flat (except for bridges) and there are bike streets (not bike lanes, bike streets, whole streets just for biking) and bike highways and bike parking garages.  It is just an amazing place to ride a bike."

bostontrees,2xwcsd,LED_oneshot,3,Wed Mar 4 13:47:15 2015 UTC,I've been hearing rumblings of auto-flowers for a few dispensaries first runs....
bostontrees,2xwcsd,member_member5thNov,2,Wed Mar 4 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"Understandable, they are the quickest to flower aren't they? And you'd have to worry less about fine tuning lighting setups and timing with auto-flowers.  For awhile there was a lot of auto prejudice. People said they tasted weird and weren't as strong. Think they've been crossbred enough to resolve those issues?"
bostontrees,2xwcsd,LED_oneshot,4,Wed Mar 4 14:28:23 2015 UTC,"No, they are junk. They may be high in CBD but they are worthless to grow in any type of facility. You cannot clone them or have a mother so you can never have identical plants, EVER. You have much better options if you want to go all CBD plants. Autoflowers are good for really dry climates. It is basically hemp.   In any type of medicinal facilities such as these, they should never be used."
bostontrees,2xwcsd,member_member5thNov,3,Wed Mar 4 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"Well shit, that sounds like garbage. I'll have to keep an eye out and avoid anywhere that uses them for their first grow."

They all decided independently that they aren't even worth growing. Let's hope the dispensaries are smarter than that."

bostontrees,2xwcsd,darkrom,3,Wed Mar 4 14:32:58 2015 UTC,That is so upsetting. It'd take generations to recreate it from crossbreeding wouldn't it?
bostontrees,2xwcsd,darkrom,3,Wed Mar 4 14:46:20 2015 UTC,"Jesus man.  That ratio is insane.  It must be SO frustrating knowing that you could just swap it in and the assholes at the dph would never even know! That being said no one wants to break the rules AND be at the very forefront of medical here.  I don't blame people for not doing it.  They really should have said starting from seed...after this one time exception period.  That would have been you know, reasonable and intelligent."
bostontrees,2xwcsd,LED_oneshot,3,Wed Mar 4 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"Also, you ever make any oil from that?  I can only imagine what that would do for my pain.  I bet I could take much bigger dabs than usual and get more benefit without the side effects from overdoing it on regular high THC oil."
bostontrees,2xwcsd,darkrom,3,Wed Mar 4 18:07:43 2015 UTC,Not yet. I haven't flowered it in my own garden. I gave the clone to my friend who is also working with me at the dispensary to keep a mother and flower it out.

bostontrees,2xt5wj,gnarmans_best,8,Tue Mar 3 18:09:53 2015 UTC,"Hey man, how hard was it to get a legitimate MJ business going in the city? I've been toying with the idea of a career change, and baking edibles is something I have been investigating heavily."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,8,Tue Mar 3 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"It's not difficult to get going. But there are risks involved. Namely: caregivers like myself are not violating the law, but we are violating the will of the DPH. We need to show the state that the caregiver program in MA is thriving as a result of their gross negligence.  That said, my business has transformed into more of an R&D company, than a product and retail business. If you have techniques, recipes and procedures (intellectual property) that you could license out to dispensary groups and others, that significantly mitigates the risks involved with being a caregiver."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,gnarmans_best,5,Tue Mar 3 18:27:47 2015 UTC,Makes perfect sense. I was wondering why you guys started to push heavily on those delivery services on Instagram. Have you run into any legal trouble so far? And do you have any recommendations on people or groups to talk to that might be able to provide guidance on doing this process correctly so we don't run into trouble down the road?
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,5,Tue Mar 3 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"We have been incredibly blessed in that we've avoided the legal pitfalls in MA so far. But the fact is, there isn't a lot of precedent for what I'm doing so the best advice I have for you is: if you like taking risks, go for it and help as many patients as you can. If you're risk averse, stay clear as the risks are great and numerous! But get a lawyer you can trust. Odds are, you'll need to rely on him or her at some point."

bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,8,Tue Mar 3 18:08:39 2015 UTC,I'll totally start!  How did you get into creating edibles?
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheCoolestEver,10,Tue Mar 3 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"Hi, Jeff! I started making edibles as an amateur about 6 years ago, when I began growing cannabis.  Prior to starting this business, I was a fine dining chef in Boston for over 10 years. So my affinity to tasty food and cannabis is well documented haha. Also, my mother suffers from a chronic pain disorder and, at the time, I was looking for a way to get her some relief without poisoning her with opiates, like her doctors were and are so happy to do. My mom hates the taste of cannabis so from day 1 I've been on a mission to lower the cannabis flavor while maintaining an effective dosage. I had access to a fair amount of material, so I would make pills and some sweeter medicated treats for her as well as harder hitting stuff for my restaurant industry friends. Most people knew me as the guy who would bring medicated Fernet Branca to industry events and parties. I started The Boston Bake Shop about a year ago when I realized the state had failed at bringing meds to patients in need in a reasonable timeframe. 2.5yrs after we voted on the medical bill, not a single dispensary has opened."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Tue Mar 3 18:22:09 2015 UTC,I find this very interesting seeing the number of dispensaries popping up in CO and CA. Is there a specific reason you believe MA has taken so long to get started? Is the legislation that made it possible for meds in MA different from those other states I mentioned above? Sorry for the barrage of questions just trying to wrap my head around why the difference in MA and if its due to legal risk.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,GreyBeardEnt,5,Tue Mar 3 19:04:34 2015 UTC,MA has a very storied history of anti business behavior as a result of over regulation. I'm speaking as someone who has and does own several small businesses in The Commonwealth. Running ANY kind of business in this state is incredibly difficult as every government agency wants to tell you what to do and how to do it.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Tue Mar 3 19:12:28 2015 UTC,medicated Fernet Branca   I'd love to learn more about this.  Is it a blend of tincture and red wine?
bostontrees,2xt5wj,InstantKarma420,6,Tue Mar 3 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"It's a blend of an alcohol based tincture, mixed with Fernet! I used to call it Fernet 420 haha."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Tue Mar 3 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"You, sir, would be a hit in Nantucket (during season)."

bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Tue Mar 3 19:50:37 2015 UTC,This sounds awesome.    Just last weekend I tried replacing the bitters in an Old Fashion with a cannabis tincture with good results.  Thanks again for answering all our questions.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,bchambs915,4,Tue Mar 3 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"Now you're speaking my language, for sure. I've found that a nice canna tincture works well in most bitters. Angostura and Fernet being the ones I have the most readily available access too. But I used to make Unicum 420 as well. Thank you folks for having me!"

bostontrees,2xt5wj,GreyBeardEnt,5,Tue Mar 3 23:12:32 2015 UTC,Any simple butter recipes for the home baking enthusiast?
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,11,Tue Mar 3 18:10:42 2015 UTC,"Of course! The ratio I used to stick with was 1oz of plant material, 1lb of butter, 1 pint of water. Or in may case, I've always used coconut oil. It's much more efficient at extracting cannabinoids than butter due to it's high saturated fat content. So: 1lb coconut oil (or butter) 1oz fresh plant material 1qt water   Grind your plant material coarsely by hand or with a grinder.  Lay it out on a parchment paper lined sheet tray, in as thin a layer as possible.  Bake at 220F for 2 hours. Cool. This process is known as decarboxylation or ""decarbing"". Cannabis needs to be activated (converted from THCa to THC) before consuming so your body can metabolize it and reap the medicinal and psychoactive benefits. Add your decarb'd plant material into a medium size pot along with your coconut oil (or butter) and water. Cover and simmer on medium heat for 18hrs. Cool to slightly warmer than room temperature.  Strain your liquid using a fine mesh strainer into a container of suitable size. Make sure to press all of the material to extract as much liquid as possible. When finished, discard the now dryish plant material. Refrigerate your strained liquid for several hours or until the coconut oil has solidified. Discard the nasty smelling water that sits underneath.  Now you're left with a beautiful, verdant green butter that you can use in your baking recipes. Or even spread it on some toast, as it's fully activated and requires no further cooking or heating to be enjoyed!   EDIT 220F, not 250F for decarbing!"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,GreyBeardEnt,6,Tue Mar 3 18:43:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for doing an AMA and for sharing a recipe.  In step 3, you decarb at 250F for 2 hours.  Is this for fresh flowers?  As someone who is used to using dried and cured flower this seem like a very long time."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,5,Tue Mar 3 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"My pleasure! That was actually a typo as I meant 220F for 2 hours, not 250F. I just edited it to correct my mistake. It's been a long time since I've made edibles using flower! Dried and cured at 220F for 2 hours will work great. For fresh cut buds, decarb for an extra hour or so to lower the moisture content. But be aware, using fresh cut and uncured can pass a lot of chlorophyll into your butter or oil and taste a lot like grass clippings."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,otallday,4,Tue Mar 3 19:47:51 2015 UTC,That is still longer than I do (240F for 40min).  Maybe it's time I try a longer decarb.  Thanks!
bostontrees,2xt5wj,GiMLiiii,3,Tue Mar 3 19:49:36 2015 UTC,Give it a shot! 240F for 40min will surely get the job done. And stink up your house for a lot less time than my time/temp.

bostontrees,2xt5wj,checosafai,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:10:03 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, the 18hrs. in step 4 is not a typo?"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:11:34 2015 UTC,Correct! Not a typo.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,checosafai,4,Wed Mar 25 09:52:16 2015 UTC,"Have you worked with ABV, or do you work solely with fresh cannabis?"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,7,Tue Mar 3 18:42:22 2015 UTC,"I used to make pills using ABV from my Volcano all the time! Truth be told, further refinement is necessary as the amount of ABV you'd need to get stoned will make the gases escaping from your body smell like a frat house, thereby destroying any discretionary benefit you'd receive from consuming edibles. I.e. don't just pop ABV into gelcaps and expect your farts to not smell like bong water. :-) But, since ABV is already fully heat activated, you could use the same recipe I posted above to make a kickass cannabutter. Just skip the decarbing step and the recipe works exactly the same."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,Brock_MowMow,5,Tue Mar 3 18:51:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer! Follow up - have you ever made golden dragon or any other tinctures using fresh or ABV herb?
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,6,Tue Mar 3 19:43:17 2015 UTC,Absolutely! The best method I've found is to use grain alcohol. Soak your ABV in grain alcohol (1oz ABV to 1pt of grain alcohol) and stick in the freezer for 3 days. Shake twice a day. Strain and enjoy!
bostontrees,2xt5wj,Brock_MowMow,5,Tue Mar 3 19:49:56 2015 UTC,"I have a question that's not about edibles, per say, but still cannabis products that you make at home, so I hope it's okay!  Have you heard about a product called Foria that is a topical cannabis lubricant (primarily for women)?  Northwest Cannabis also just came out with one called Liquid Liberty.  As a Canadian, I can't buy it, so I'm super interested in making this at home, somehow - I have a whole bunch of shake and tons of butter in the freezer left from the last batch I made.  I've heard that Foria is coconut oil based and also that it contains caffeine to help the cannabis absorb into the skin.  I have no idea a) how to get the coconut oil into a constant liquid state (which would be ideal), or b) how caffeine might be used as an ingredient, or c) what other ingredients I would need to make this.  Any thoughts, tricks or tips?  Thanks!"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,6,Tue Mar 3 18:22:08 2015 UTC,"Of course this question is perfect. Topical's are gaining popularity in the cannabis industry. It's not something I've delved too deeply into, but I'll give it a shot! I would think you could use the recipe I posted above to make your medicated coconut oil extraction. But you are correct, in that it is extremely solid at room temperature making application difficult. I would suggest making a very light starch-based slurry using either a tiny bit of cornstarch and some hot water or an even tinier amount of methyl cellulose and hot water. Then you can melt your coconut oil into that and it will emulsify very well. I would think if you added a small amount of high proof alcohol to that concoction, like Everclear, you'd have a pretty easily absorbable lubricant that would stay liquid at room temperatures. Does that make sense? I'm kind of talking out of my ass on the subject but that should steer you in the right direction."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,Brock_MowMow,4,Tue Mar 3 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"That totally makes sense, thank you! So just to be clear ‚Äì the alcohol will turn it into a topical agent? No caffeine necessary? Also, I have seen some coconut oils for sale that are already in liquid form ‚Äì would you recommend staying away from those? Thanks for your replies and for the AMA!"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Tue Mar 3 19:56:53 2015 UTC,The alcohol aids in absorption. Caffeine would work as well but caffeine absorbed topically can be pretty overwhelming for some folks. I think coconut oil in liquid form would work pretty well it's just a bit harder to wash off than a water/starch based solution with a bit of coco oil added to it.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,contagiousyawns,5,Tue Mar 3 20:01:00 2015 UTC,That's super helpful - thanks so much!
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Tue Mar 3 21:11:40 2015 UTC,Of course! My pleasure.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Tue Mar 3 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"Random extract enthusiast checking in:  1) What's your preferred method for decarbing hash/hash oil?  2) what ratios do you prefer of coconut oil to decarbed oil,  3) which is your favorite type of extract to cook with, and  4) what what's the most unique dish you've infused cannabis product into?"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,ProfessorRatcow,5,Tue Mar 3 19:18:07 2015 UTC,"These are great questions! I decarb concentrates simply by heating them to 280F, usually in a metal bane marie, very quickly then removing from heat. My test results from MCR Labs have shown this to be a very effective way of converting THCa to THC without oxidizing too heavily so as to degrade into CBN. I don't really have a favorite ratio that I stick with. All of my recipes use either very small amounts of coconut oil, or none at all. You'll need to figure out what works best for you and your recipes.  My favorite concentrate to cook with is by far the Wizard Tears clear concentrate that I've developed in our lab. It's a heavily refined, solvent free, decarboxylated concentrate that starts as low purity BHO. It is extremely clear and extremely potent with no discernible flavor or smell. We are using it across the board in all of our edibles starting this week. It looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/pN2qnYh.jpg  I've done some fun stuff with cannabis over the years. I used to host 10-12 course canna tasting menus at various restaurants during off hours. A couple of my favorites:  Warm duck blood gelee, lap cheong, pickled quail eggs, ginko, enoki, cannabis: http://i.imgur.com/DPgzpTG.jpg  Veal marrow, apple, lichen, honey, cannabis: http://i.imgur.com/EQg8lhX.jpg"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,ColeS707,3,Tue Mar 3 19:37:50 2015 UTC,OMG THOSE LOOK AMAZINGBALLS
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Tue Mar 3 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, brother! I does what I can."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,darkrom,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:42:20 2015 UTC,How do I sign up for tastings like these around the Boston area?!
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,5,Tue Apr 7 18:27:07 2015 UTC,What's the strangest edible you guys have cooked up? Also any combinations that just did not work out?
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Tue Mar 3 20:16:12 2015 UTC,"Strangest? Probably this course I did for a private canna dinner a few years ago. Veal marrow, apple, lichen, honey, cannabis: http://i.imgur.com/EQg8lhX.jpg  Patients uniformly hated our vegan gummies. And rightfully so! They were pretty whack."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,darkrom,4,Tue Mar 3 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"Lets talk dosage.  How do you ensure consistency in the same batch and different batches?  What do you think a ""starter"" dose should be?    I've always reacted weirdly to edibles.  I want to like them, but I feel like I need dispensary levels of consistency before I can really give them a fair shot again."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Tue Mar 3 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"Great question. I started refining high purity concentrates to aid in solving this exact problem. If you make cannabutter and such using flower, it's very difficult to know what the concentration of THC in your butter is without knowing the exact purity of your flower. I.e. some flower is 12% THC some is 27% THC and everything in between. I started making my edibles with concentrates a while back to help increase accuracy in dosing. But that's still problematic as concentrates can range from 40% THC to 70% THC so without knowing purity, you're basically estimating the dosage. A few months ago I began a quest to refine the highest purity concentrates and that's how I came upon my Wizard Tears product. I'm dialing it in to over 90% THC (lab results pending) which will help me accurately dose lower dosage products with very little margin for error. I would like to start folks out on 5mg and work from there. With high purity concentrate I am able to get down to low dosage numbers consistently and accurately."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,darkrom,3,Tue Mar 3 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"You were talking about a 1:1 ratio for flower, what do you do with concentrates?"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Wed Mar 4 00:38:25 2015 UTC,It really depends on your desired dosage per portion and the amount of concentrate you have to start with.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,darkrom,3,Wed Mar 4 01:37:53 2015 UTC,Well that makes sense...
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Wed Mar 4 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"Even with known 90% THC oil, how do you make it so each dose is the same as the next?  For example if you made 10 brownies, how can you tell that there isn't 3x as much of the oil in the brownie on one end compared to the other?  Thats the part I can never imagine.  You can do the math to figure out 1000 mg of thc over x amount of brownies, but how do you get it to actually disperse evenly like that?  Thanks for taking the time to do this.  I feel like being a multiple time daily vaporist for years and years now, and having no problem dabbing, I'm really missing out by not enjoying edibles.  They just seem to set my anxiety off something FIERCE.  I'd love to try some low THC high CBD edible with CBD strains becoming huge lately.  I feel like I'd rather be underwhelmed and still get some medical benefits than sitting in my bed wishing for a benzo shaking violently lol.  I still think its insane I can take a few dabs but edibles just put me in a bad place so far :("
bostontrees,2xt5wj,darkrom,3,Tue Mar 3 22:27:29 2015 UTC,The key is proper homogenization. You really need to mix this stuff in at the right temps and for a very long period of time to allow for evenly distributed concentrate across all portions. I would love for you to try some of my low dosage products coming out very soon. I'll be in touch and thank you for the well thought out questions!
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,5,Wed Mar 4 01:30:09 2015 UTC,Low dosage sounds KEY for people like me.  Almost as important as standard dosage.  Do strain effects carry over into edibles much as far as you can tell?  I'm wondering if the terps being cooked off at higher decarbing temps means they are more similar than when vaporized.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,KDAB_OilSlick,4,Wed Mar 4 02:55:23 2015 UTC,There is talk of an entourage effect that comes along with consuming or vaping terpenes and cannabinoids. I'm doing quite a bit of research into exactly that and will let everyone know my findings soon. I've been using terpenes in some of my edibles as a bioavailability enhancer  for a couple of years now. It seems to have a noticeable effect.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Wed Mar 4 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"All the reading I've done on terps suggests they play a role in the effects from strain to strain.  I never really thought of them being lost in edibles until now.  I've heard lots of stuff about the terps in black pepper being able to calm/dull a strong THC high, even simply by sniffing it a few times.  That might be an interesting terp to try adding to edibles for people like me, a stress reducing effect ideally."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Wed Mar 4 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I created a product called The Soberizer which is a vaporizer that immediately negates the psychological effects of over consumption of edibles, after a few puffs. There are a few ingredients out there that work against THC."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,member_member5thNov,4,Wed Mar 4 03:15:35 2015 UTC,Do you sell the soberizer or tell people what is in it? Sounds incredibly interesting.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Wed Mar 4 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"Available for sale, soon. It's a mixture of hemp cannabinoinds and anti-psychotics. I originally created it for myself, as I have been my own guinea pig for years and recently, higher doses of cannabis have begun triggering panic attacks for me."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,member_member5thNov,4,Wed Mar 4 11:19:19 2015 UTC,Hey there! Huge fan of your products and can't wait to try them some day. Feel free to get in touch if there is anything we can ever do to help support!  Kristopher @ Oil Slick  IG@oilslick TW@oilslickpad
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,5,Tue Mar 3 21:33:22 2015 UTC,Thanks so much you guys already support us a lot on IG and I really appreciate it!
bostontrees,2xt5wj,member_member5thNov,4,Tue Mar 3 22:06:39 2015 UTC,What do you do to negate the taste of cannabis in you products?
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,4,Wed Mar 4 00:38:55 2015 UTC,I refine my concentrate very heavily. I remove all the chlorophyll and terpenes. So very little flavor and odor is left.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Wed Mar 4 01:39:13 2015 UTC,Do you have an ideal strain for that purpose or do you use multiple different strains? Does it matter that much to you what the starting material is if it will be that heavily refined?
bostontrees,2xt5wj,member_member5thNov,3,Wed Mar 4 01:48:44 2015 UTC,We go after strains that offer the highest yield for hydrocarbon extraction. That's pretty much all I look for. But all the other facets of the strain are pretty much irrelevant to my refinement process.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,2,Wed Mar 4 01:52:11 2015 UTC,That's really interesting. And what strains are those? Mostly super high THC sativas?
bostontrees,2xt5wj,member_member5thNov,3,Wed Mar 4 01:53:31 2015 UTC,"We work with: super silver haze, GSC, blue dream, star killer, the hulk, death star, and a few others that test at high THC and are suitable to our extraction methods."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Wed Mar 4 02:04:31 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, thanks!"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Wed Mar 4 02:05:44 2015 UTC,"What method do you use? Is it a hexane wash, or just a water wash?"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,member_member5thNov,3,Wed Mar 4 01:44:14 2015 UTC,"Those techniques only polish, they don't do much by way of purification. Check out my IG feed for more info on my techniques."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,member_member5thNov,3,Wed Mar 4 01:45:59 2015 UTC,"Can you point to anything in particular?  A quick look over your IG, it seems you're using closed loop Co2? You mention Limonene a few times as well. But it's all fairly lightweight."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Wed Mar 4 02:56:56 2015 UTC,It's basically intended to be. A few of my techniques are patent pending but all the equipment I use is represented in my IG feed.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,LED_oneshot,4,Wed Mar 4 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"I guess I can take 'trade secret' as an appropriate response. As an Aussie, i'm deeply jealous of your setup and ability to do this.

bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Wed Mar 4 03:25:46 2015 UTC,Have you ever cooked anything from The Hashish Cookbook?  The sesame hash balls are my go to edible. I usually fuck up brownies one out of four times.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,LED_oneshot,3,Tue Mar 3 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't but thanks so much for sharing that link! I've never read this book but I will tonight, for sure."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,LED_oneshot,3,Tue Mar 3 18:53:21 2015 UTC,It is an amazing artifact of cannabis culture.  First published in 1967 on handmade paper and hand printed by buddhist monks old beats contracted it out to in Nepal. A bunch of the recipes are from beat morocco and hippie freak street nepal. The author was a friend of Brion Gysin who slipped the original pot brownie recipe into Alice B Toklas's cook book.  It is always my favorite rare book to request in special collections. I giggle. The librarians giggle.   Enjoy!
bostontrees,2xt5wj,LED_oneshot,3,Tue Mar 3 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I love the librarians giggle. I have a collection of ancient cookbooks and would love to add this to my collection. Does it come up in print, ever?"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,OliverAtom,3,Tue Mar 3 19:19:11 2015 UTC,Found one on Amazon  http://www.amazon.com/The-Hashish-Cookbook-Panama-Rose/dp/B000UC9Q6W  For $110. :(
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Tue Mar 3 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Jeff! Looking out my window, I'm pretty sure it's Christmas time so I may as well get myself a present."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,member_member5thNov,3,Tue Mar 3 19:52:28 2015 UTC,And that is reasonably priced one.  There is a reason I read it only in archives.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,bluehat9,3,Tue Mar 3 20:12:05 2015 UTC,There are some later 70s editions on ebay. Sometimes they aren't too expensive.  The original printings are very rare and all in personal collections or rare book libraries.  You can have the pdf printed up very cheaply.
bostontrees,2xt5wj,TheBostonBakeShop,3,Tue Mar 3 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"When dispensaries do open, are your products going to be available at any?"
bostontrees,2xt5wj,member_member5thNov,3,Tue Mar 3 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"A few MA groups have reached out to me about licensure of my IP so ...potentially. Many more groups from states including AZ, WA and CO have reached out to me as well with much more compelling proposals. Oddly enough, it's likely that you'll see The Boston Bake Shop products on shelves in those states, before you will in MA."
bostontrees,2xt5wj,bluehat9,4,Tue Mar 3 18:46:49 2015 UTC,Well I am going out to WA soon......need a sales rep? haha JK

I think I saw you posting on my FC thread that you had some success with the soilgrown solventless technique I posted about.  I haven't had any luck yet, but I think I was going too hot on the fancy iron and just vaping away my oil perhaps."
bostontrees,2xsdwq,darkrom,2,Tue Mar 3 15:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's me on FC.  I'm in North Andover.  How old is the material you're using?  I tend to have much better luck with fresher buds.  I tried old, dried out buds and couldn't get anything.  I'm new to concentrates in general so getting the oil off the parchment paper is the hardest part for me so far haha"
bostontrees,2xsdwq,Rizzalso,2,Tue Mar 3 17:46:15 2015 UTC,Oh wow so close.  Yeah I have mostly drier buds right now. That could be a factor as well.   I bet you could just swipe a dabber over the little flakes of oil. They should stick to each other on the dabber fairly easily I'd think.

bostontrees,2xd54s,member_member5thNov,6,Fri Feb 27 19:13:45 2015 UTC,This! Lately I've been Vaping out of my arizer solo. I smoked a joint last night and got dumb high.
bostontrees,2xd54s,Jukebawks,2,Fri Feb 27 20:43:28 2015 UTC,That mix of combusted cannabiniods will catch you off guard after vaping won't it?  Sometimes even after months of bho a joint will rock my world in unexpected ways.   I personally subscribe to a bodily confusion methodology.  Mix it up from time to time and your poor tolerance will never know what hit it.
bostontrees,2xd54s,member_member5thNov,3,Sat Feb 28 02:33:46 2015 UTC,Hell yeah it does. It's definitely a different high.
bostontrees,2xd54s,Jukebawks,5,Sun Mar 1 02:50:42 2015 UTC,Only right answer
bostontrees,2xd54s,member_member5thNov,8,Fri Feb 27 19:22:18 2015 UTC,Everything in it's time and place. Different strokes for different folks. Don't knock it until you try it and all that.  Some days a joint in the park. Some days oil for breakfast. One hitters before bed. bowl with a friend. blunt with friends.   Also: smoke weed e'ryday.
bostontrees,2xd54s,snortsnort,3,Fri Feb 27 19:24:48 2015 UTC,"When you wrote ""smoke weed e'ryday"" it bothered me so much that I didn't know what type of contraction that was. TIL"
bostontrees,2xd54s,autowikibot,3,Sat Feb 28 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"Apologetic apostrophe:       The apologetic  or parochial apostrophe  is the distinctive use of apostrophes in Modern Scots orthography.  Apologetic apostrophes generally occurred where a consonant exists in the Standard English cognate, as in a' (all), gi'e (give) and wi' (with).  The practice, unknown in Older Scots, was introduced in the 18th century  by writers such as Allan Ramsay,  Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns as part of a process of Anglicisation. The 18th century practice was also adopted by later writers such as Sir Walter Scott, John Galt and Robert Louis Stevenson. It produced an easily understood spurious Scots that was very popular with English readers and on the English stage. It was also sometimes forced on reluctant authors by publishers desirous of a wider circulation for their books.   The custom ""also had the unfortunate effect of suggesting that Broad Scots was not a separate language system, but rather a divergent or inferior form of English"".  The use of the apologetic apostrophe became less widespread  after the appearance of the 'Style Sheet'  in 1947 and is now considered unacceptable,  the apostrophe-less forms such as aw (all), gie (give) and wi (with) being preferable.

bostontrees,2xd54s,undercoverballer,7,Fri Feb 27 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"Yup! Converted to 99% vape in August to save my lungs.

Those awesome rips where you don't think you got any until you exhale a cloud big enough to start a snowstorm. But since August I'm 99% smoke free, I bought an arizer solo to save my asthmatic lungs.

bostontrees,2xd54s,undercoverballer,3,Mon Mar 2 01:59:31 2015 UTC,"Okay cool. Can you hit the bag, seal it, and wait like 10 mins to hit it again? I just have to try a bag sometime so I can figure it out on my own :)"

bostontrees,2xd54s,member_member5thNov,2,Mon Mar 2 16:46:17 2015 UTC,I want to get an Herbalizer more than a volcano
bostontrees,2xd54s,member_member5thNov,3,Mon Mar 2 17:28:47 2015 UTC,never had the pleasure.  had my volcano for three years and have never had a single problem with it. use it daily (and sometimes all day long) and it works flawlessly every single time.
bostontrees,2xd54s,BOOBS_BOOBS_BOOBS,2,Mon Mar 2 18:32:38 2015 UTC,"It works the same, in that it uses a bag, but you can also use it to hotbox a room, or with a hose"
bostontrees,2xd54s,Captinfucker,2,Mon Mar 2 18:34:15 2015 UTC,Pretty sure I could hotbox well sealed room with my 'cano but I haven't tried to yet.  the filler basket works just fine without a bag.  smells like making popcorn or cotton candy.  you should get a herbalizer! then I could try yours.
bostontrees,2xd54s,undercoverballer,2,Mon Mar 2 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"Yes. The bags are great. A single ""bowl pack"" can fill up at least 3 bags, which is good for small groups (2 - 4 people maximum). I have actually gotten 5 bags out of one bowl before, but the vapor quality was significantly worse after the 3rd. It still worked, but just ok. Anyway, I really like my EQ so far. You should get one."
bostontrees,2xd54s,undercoverballer,3,Tue Mar 3 01:14:34 2015 UTC,"You can just hold the stem tight into the downstem or where the bowl goes, won't be perfect but still works great. But compared to the awesomeness of a PVHE GonG its a bit lacking unless you're using a tiny bong"
bostontrees,2xd54s,snortsnort,4,Sat Feb 28 05:02:53 2015 UTC,Good point. I actually have a mini bong so maybe it'll work! I'll experiment and report back :)

bostontrees,2xd54s,Taste_like_Burning,5,Fri Feb 27 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"When I was in Israel I wasn't risking it but we were talking to these kids/guys who were college aged, rolling a cigarette, and they said you're best bet is hash (This was Jerusalem if it mattes, shout out Mike's Place, has Sam Adams).  anyway, you got hat cupcake, that's whats up.  Enjoy Israel!"
bostontrees,2xd54s,nykwil3281,5,Fri Feb 27 18:20:56 2015 UTC,One of my favorite ways to smoke is hash in a glass.   Some people call it the cups method. You roll a thin stick of hash like the size of a match stick or pin or nail. You flip a pint glass upside down. You stick the hash stick on a pin or (wedge a cigarette in to support it) and light it. cover it with the pint glass and cover the bottom of the glass with a coaster. When the glass is full of smoke tip it over enough to sip the smoke out of the crack.  It looks very impressive. You look like you are drinking clouds of smoke.
bostontrees,2xd54s,HarvardCock,3,Fri Feb 27 19:18:25 2015 UTC,Dude.. I know you?
bostontrees,2xd54s,nykwil3281,4,Sun Mar 1 17:30:04 2015 UTC,Asking bartenders is often helpful. And if you are in a beach setting or tourist area finding the store or street stall selling a bob marley t-shirt is usually a good sign.

There is a lack of ipa and hop driven beer.  Lager and Jameson is my M.O. around here.   The guys sitting next to us shared their shwag spliffs, which was nice.

Going to headscapes first, then either Buried Treasures/Blue Moon/Greenside up.  Going for a simple Ti nail.  Only reason I'm going to headscapes first is because i called last week and they were pretty helpful and the prices were very reasonable.  just doing a simple setup for now, to see how often I dab/if i I like it."

bostontrees,2x5ktq,nykwil3281,5,Thu Feb 26 03:33:57 2015 UTC,That happened to me too.   there is an email address on the submission  site you can use to contact them or if you reply to the email they sent you an actual person will reply to you.  I believe that all you need in addition to your license is to also upload a picture of a piece of current mail but I'm not entirely sure.
bostontrees,2x5ktq,member_member5thNov,3,Wed Feb 25 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"I actually found a number to call for the MMJ program. I had a conversation with a lady which pretty much boiled down to ""We can't do anything for you. We can't do anything to mark your record to note your address has been changed with the RMV. We can't add any additional documents to your file to prove your address is where you say it is. And we can't tell you what steps you have to take to make sure your next application goes through.""  So basically after waiting two weeks for my application to be processed and denied, I have to wait another two weeks until they get around to it again with no guarantee that I will be accepted. I'm going to call again today to see if I get a supervisor because the lady I spoke to yesterday around 4:45 sounded like she was just trying to get me off the phone so she could go home."
bostontrees,2x5ktq,member_member5thNov,3,Thu Feb 26 14:38:54 2015 UTC,Did you get a name?   Also write an email to your state rep to complain and ask for assistance. A large part of their job is constituent service and they call state agencies and tell them to get their shit together and fix their voter's problems all the time.  I'm going to. It may be the only way to fix the DPH.
bostontrees,2x5ktq,snortsnort,3,Thu Feb 26 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"No, I should have. I'll call again and hopefully get a resolution this time. If not I'll definitely write an email."
bostontrees,2x5ktq,member_member5thNov,2,Thu Feb 26 15:10:39 2015 UTC,"Just called again and got the run around from the first person I talked to and the supervisor. Apparently because I resubmitted my application again there is nothing they can do about my old one and I just have to ""give them the time to process my new application.""  I think the problem was that I scanned my license on two pages instead of one, front side page 1 and back side page 2. I think the person reviewing just saw the first page, didn't bother to look at the second, and denied my app.  I took me three weeks to get an appointment at CannaCare because doctors kept no showing in South Boston, two weeks to get my app screened and denied, now its going to take God knows how long again for them to review it and I'm not even guaranteed that it will be accepted. This whole process has been way too frustrating."

bostontrees,2wfzi7,swiese12,3,Thu Feb 19 21:52:18 2015 UTC,It's great because literally almost everyone grows..so the only product that remains 'on the market' is the absolute piff. People from my part of Maine put a lot of time and energy into weed because there isn't much else to do :P
bostontrees,2wfzi7,swiese12,2,Thu Feb 19 21:58:53 2015 UTC,Lol same here. Where are you from?

They both rip hard or soft etc, have good battery life, and are easy to use. I just want something that can do wax and has more control over the temperature, the PAX can't do wax. I also like how the Ascent is easier to hook up to a bong and has a car charger that you can use while its in use.  There are hundreds of reviews and comparisons of each, do your own research don't take me for it, and I wouldn't say one is quantitatively better than the other."
bostontrees,2vnn6t,AnthonyD1987,2,Thu Feb 12 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"""The one"" meaning the best portable vape option out there. Im not looking for something that vapes wax or connects to bongs or anything tho, just something i can conveniently carry around with me in my pocket. One thing i gotta ask is: how was the maintenence factor with the ploom? Is it a pain in the ass to keep clean and running smooth?"
bostontrees,2vnn6t,Snaffuuu,2,Thu Feb 12 17:01:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a clear cut answer to which one is the best. I've personally tried an MFLB, a PAX, an Ascent, and a few different pen vapes. MFLB wins in terms of ease of packing and value for your dollar, PAX wins in terms of portability and battery life amazing taste too, the ascent wins in terms of wax/dry herb vape. The major downside to the DaVinci is it has an all glass pathway, an upside for taste, so if you drop it you can potentially break the fuck out of it.  The PAX is way easier to clean than people make it out. What I do is I get a cup of really hot water and a piece of wire. Then I use the hot water to clean the mouthpiece and the wire to clear out any resin in the pathway. Alcohol swabs for the oven part cuz you don't really want water in there haha. Takes 5 mins. The PAX kicks the shit out of the DaVinci for discretion and portability its much smaller and you don't really have to worry about dropping it that much theres nothing that breaks easy in it.  EDIT: I can provide some wire and the lube that came with the mouthpiece as well."

Those first nice spring days--no fuck that--those first barely tolerable spring days are like a national holiday.  You'll feel like you woke up in some bizarro world version of Massachusetts with beautiful weather where everyone is nice, and happy, and in a good mood. People are overjoyed that first 50 degree day. Everyone is so friendly and smiling and I swear to fucking god its like cartoon birds are singing everywhere.  The weather is going to be shit for a good while and it'll probably rain through most of April but like once a week it is going to be beautiful and the entire city seems to go on cognitive strike. You see lawyers laying in the grass, bankers basking in the sun with their pants rolled up, children goddamn frolicking.  Those first spring days its like someone doped the water supply with ecstasy and it is fucking glorious."

bostontrees,2uzcow,jeffiethepirate,7,Fri Feb 6 13:25:55 2015 UTC,"By Terry Franklin BOSTON, MA ‚Äî After several delays due to weather, a marijuana legalization bill was introduced Wednesday in Massachusetts by more than ten legislators, with Representative Dave Rogers of Cambridge taking the lead.  There is as yet no bill number. Its temporary House docket number is HD 3436, and is titled the ‚ÄúCannabis Regulation and Taxation Act of 2016.‚Äù  The proposal would legalize the personal cultivation and possession of marijuana by adults 21 or older, and allow for commercial  sales and cannabis cafes in the Bay State.  Though some activists in the state may find the regulatory provisions in the bill more restrictive than they would desire, the bill has many good provisions, including expungement of past convictions, and a very generous home grow provision with no limit on numbers of plants, provided those plants were grown for personal use, and not intended for sale.  Personal possession limits outside one‚Äôs home would be set at ten ounces of marijuana or ten pounds of edible marijuana products, but there would be no possession limits imposed within a person‚Äôs home.  In view of the rapid collapse of cannabis prohibition across the country, the introduction of a bill this year is more significant than many past efforts. For decades, bills such as this have routinely been tabled in the MA Legislature‚Äôs Judiciary Committee. This time however, the Committee‚Äôs new chairman, Senator Brownsberger, himself a co-sponsor of the bill, plans to give it a fair hearing.  Despite these positive developments, politicians are a timid bunch with respect to this issue, and the repeal of Prohibition in Massachusetts is much more likely to be decided by the voters in 2016. Bay State Repeal and at least one other group are currently working on wording of an Initiative.  So, with a number of different proposals in play, things are still up in the air to some degree; though with this bill as a starting point, hopefully the final form Cannabis Freedom takes in Massachusetts will be one of the best in the nation."
bostontrees,2uzcow,MisterFatt,15,Fri Feb 6 13:27:23 2015 UTC,I would be so proud of our state if our lawmakers could actually be proactive about something and make a wanted change without being forced to by their constituents.
bostontrees,2uzcow,member_member5thNov,3,Fri Feb 6 15:47:55 2015 UTC,I like that we're sticking with ten ounces.
bostontrees,2uzcow,darkrom,3,Fri Feb 6 15:52:13 2015 UTC,"Why?   Just curious.  I can't see myself carrying 10 oz lol.  I don't travel etc.  I rarely carry more than a few grams since I just vape.    I'm of the mindset ""who cares if I have 20lbs in the trunk its just bud"" but obviously that won't fly haha.   Just curious what you like about 10oz.  Seems like a good number.  I know I sure as hell can't afford 10oz at a time and if I could I wouldn't even want 10oz of the same strain."
bostontrees,2uzcow,member_member5thNov,6,Fri Feb 6 15:56:05 2015 UTC,"I like it because it is now the MA standard and so much more than anywhere else.  I think I understand how they arrived at that number for medical. A thirty day supply of three joints a day works out to about ten ounces. I always assumed the law was written either by someone who last smoked in 1970 or by Snoop Lion. (Old head: ""well back in '68 a lid would last about three days so ten for thirty sounds about right."" Young head:""suuuuuuuuuure. Yeah. Ten ounces is.... Reasonable."")  It's sort of ridiculous.  But it's also enough to cover things the law rarely accounts for like transporting from a grow to a store.  I like it. I enjoy telling folks that although our med laws are currently nonfunctional at the moment at least we can posses ten Ounces.  edit: I believe that works out to .5-1g joints every three hours over an 18 hour day for thirty days, not three HUGE joints a day, but maybe someone else will check my math."
bostontrees,2uzcow,Spatulamarama,4,Fri Feb 6 16:08:47 2015 UTC,Those are some big joints.
bostontrees,2uzcow,member_member5thNov,4,Fri Feb 6 17:15:31 2015 UTC,"What, you want should cancer patients smoke lil baby pinnners?  But I just rechecked my math and I think that works out to 9g joints. Sooooo even if you are smoking Archer-esque joints the size of tampons that'd be a bit much.  Even at Snoop Lion standards of 81 blunts a day I'm not entirely sure you'd run through that  much.  So I present to /r/Bostontrees a challenge for the coming medicalized and legalized future: Is it possible to singlehandedly smoke ten ounces in thirty days?  I dunno if I could do it but I'm willing to take on sponsors to make a run at it."

bostontrees,2uzcow,wizard_82,4,Fri Feb 6 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"It's more for people who would possibly need that much, or that they can stockpile.  I can't imagine someone needing 10/oz per month, but what if it's a person who is elderly and has a hard time getting to and from places.  A caregiver could give them a larger amount to hold them over, if that were the case.  But yeah, I wouldnt travel with it."
bostontrees,2uzcow,member_member5thNov,6,Fri Feb 6 15:57:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely makes sense.  Also for patients who make edibles or concentrates.    Interesting loophole in the way MA is worded counts concentrates by weight.  Meaning you can have 10 oz of hash oil.  If you REALLY can't make 10oz of bud last long enough, you can condense 40-50oz of bud to 10oz of hash oil and still comply with the law.    That being said 10oz of hash oil is enough to last me possibly the rest of my life lol."
bostontrees,2uzcow,member_member5thNov,2,Fri Feb 6 16:05:55 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly!  Grow 9 oz, convert to oil, repeat."
bostontrees,2uzcow,member_member5thNov,2,Fri Feb 6 23:31:45 2015 UTC,and TEN POUNDS of edibles.
bostontrees,2uzcow,2_dam_hi,6,Fri Feb 6 15:52:55 2015 UTC,Still 10 Oz of hash and oil!  In texas that'd get you life. In Singapore that'd get you death.
bostontrees,2uzcow,FuuurSuuure,6,Fri Feb 6 17:42:20 2015 UTC,"In Massachusetts, that'd get you high."
bostontrees,2uzcow,member_member5thNov,3,Fri Feb 6 17:44:06 2015 UTC,sooooooo very high.

bostontrees,2ux3yp,jeffiethepirate,1 point,Thu Feb 5 22:58:53 2015 UTC,"Even with legalization, there will still be medical marijuana in the state. If you look at WA and CO, the prices and options are much better for medical patients."

bostontrees,2ux3yp,member_member5thNov,3,Fri Feb 6 13:42:31 2015 UTC,"yes.  As far as I can tell.  Not making it easy on us, even in parsing the fucking legalese.  the card fee at least has a financial hardship provision to be waived."
bostontrees,2ux3yp,beantowntreeparty,2,Thu Feb 5 22:37:45 2015 UTC,They must be raking it in on those fees! So fucked up
bostontrees,2ux3yp,member_member5thNov,2,Thu Feb 5 22:40:12 2015 UTC,What's the yearly fee for the mmj card?
bostontrees,2ux3yp,member_member5thNov,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:59:06 2015 UTC,Infrastructure and upkeep of the system? I think that was covered in the millions they made on applications and the dispensaries themselves. For a department that hasn't really changed since they took this program on I'd be curious to see where the $ is actually going. I don't remember paying $50 a year for my drivers license either and there's a bunch of RMVs everywhere. No need for a $50 yearly fee.
bostontrees,2ux3yp,member_member5thNov,2,Fri Feb 6 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"So very fucked up.  I still haven't gotten my temp card, which I filed for on friday, although they took my cash oh so very readily."
bostontrees,2ux3yp,member_member5thNov,2,Fri Feb 6 00:31:20 2015 UTC,three days makes me feel better. I'm not sure it's even been three days if you discount the snow days.
bostontrees,2uv4x9,CaptHandsome,3,Thu Feb 5 12:18:09 2015 UTC,Question for the community... I'm paying $200 for my certification from CannaCare. Has anyone else had any luck with other participating doctors at a lower rate? I was hoping to hear someone say their doc charges closer to $50 or something similar.
bostontrees,2uv4x9,member_member5thNov,3,Thu Feb 5 12:20:19 2015 UTC,Wish I had better news but that's the best I could find too.

If I barely understand it, I don't know how he will.  I imagine (though I could be wrong) that the appointment will be covered under insurance."
bostontrees,2uv4x9,OMGItsNotAPhaseMom,1 point,Tue Feb 10 12:15:26 2015 UTC,"No, it won't be covered by insurance. I remember reading a bit about that last year, it's not considered an insurable situation. You'll need to go out of your way to a place like CannaCare, and pay it all out of pocket. Not cool, I know, but maybe that'll change in the future too."

bostontrees,2urte7,jeffiethepirate,3,Tue Feb 17 17:16:37 2015 UTC,"I personally never get much either from edibles, but i guess that happens. I got some flower and shatter from them, very good"
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,3,Tue Feb 17 17:34:50 2015 UTC,edibles can be hit or miss but usually it's because something happened in production. Do they never work for you?  I guess if some people are super sensitive to 11-hydroxy-THC some folks must also be very insensitive to it too.
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,2,Tue Feb 17 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"No, I love medibles but I have had better luck with my own creations."
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:28:41 2015 UTC,I generally only eat my own too. Other people's dosage is always kinda hard to figure out anyway. With my own I make a big batch and then dial in dosage.
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,2,Thu Feb 19 19:31:19 2015 UTC,I'm excited and a bit frightened to try shatter.
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,3,Thu Feb 19 19:29:47 2015 UTC,That is the correct attitude.
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:31:31 2015 UTC,200mg should be a lot. A single bowl pack usually delivers around 25mg if I recall correctly.
bostontrees,2urte7,kg2bee,2,Tue Feb 17 18:05:38 2015 UTC,I don't use huge amounts when I'm vaping.  I just made abv oil and it knocked my socks off so I know it's not just the way my body processes medibles.    I wish I could just buy plain butter or coconut oil.  I can't wait for the dispensaries to open.
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,3,Thu Feb 19 19:25:57 2015 UTC,coconut oil from abv? thats my preferred method as well.   We use all the parts of the buffalo in my house. no waste.  Plus it is a nice relaxing stoney high.
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,2,Thu Feb 19 19:32:40 2015 UTC,I want to buy a tiny slow cooker so I can make smaller amounts.  That's my latest fantasy lol.
bostontrees,2urte7,jeffiethepirate,2,Thu Feb 19 21:35:24 2015 UTC,Do they make tiny usb slow cookers? That might be your best bet.
bostontrees,2urte7,nykwil3281,2,Thu Feb 19 21:38:31 2015 UTC,They make 16 oz slow cookers.  I figure that is just about enough room for some oil and about a week's worth of abv.
bostontrees,2urte7,tweeprise69,1 point,Fri Feb 20 07:20:42 2015 UTC,0.45 kg?! That's 1565.52 bees
bostontrees,2urte7,TaintShredder,2,Fri Feb 20 07:20:46 2015 UTC,I hate to see anything go to waste as well.   That's one reason I love vaping.
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,2,Thu Feb 19 21:37:10 2015 UTC,vaping is fantastic.  I even harvested the condensed thc oil on the inside of my old volcano bags by simmering them in a crockpot for days. All my edibles have an extra strong kick now.
bostontrees,2urte7,nykwil3281,2,Thu Feb 19 21:40:01 2015 UTC,I soak my stems every night or two.  I'm not sure what to do next.  There is a lot of sediment.   I figure I'll just keep going for the moment.  I don't know how long I should save or what it should look like.
bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,2,Fri Feb 20 07:23:28 2015 UTC,I just toss my stems in with my abv when I do coconut oil.

bostontrees,2urte7,member_member5thNov,3,Wed Feb 4 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"Xotic Delivery   Never heard of em. I'd probably avoid non official forums for delivery services. I would suggest the Marijuana-Caregivers forum, but some of the members decided to stop taking patients because a certain delivery service (BHO) was caught with a bunch of weed delivering in a parking lot on the T. You're only supposed to have 1 patient as a caregiver.  There always seems to be someone new each day on that forum though, but they have a rating system for caregivers and from the 2 that I've purchased from, good guys, pretty straight forward."

bostontrees,2u7n3n,Bruins1,3,Fri Jan 30 16:49:33 2015 UTC,Maybe just from Boston working in NYC.   Either way the story could apply to both cities. I don't know of any delivery services on the scale of what's available in NYC but there are plenty of people who deliver in Boston. I'm sure most people stopped during the storm in Boston though.
bostontrees,2u7n3n,MisterFatt,2,Fri Jan 30 17:28:43 2015 UTC,I always thought that those NYC delivery services would be amazing

bostontrees,2u5ztf,darkrom,1 point,Sat Jan 31 02:14:40 2015 UTC,"Ordered 1 now.  Thanks for the link.  Either way it should be fine for the purpose of a mouthpiece, but did you do the simple test to see if its REALLY platinum cured silicone?  Most suppliers seem to have no problem calling anything platinum cured these days, so you could be lying to your customers with the best of intentions :(  Just fold some part of it REALLY tight and see if it turns white at all.  I was surprised to see how many brands of oil containers I had were called platinum cured, and honestly only the budder blocks and oil slick brand stuff really was.  Like I said I'd feel safe using it either way, but if you are paying a supplier for platinum cured silicone, you should be getting it.  If its actually platinum cured, then this is a product I've been waiting for for a long time and didn't even know I needed.  I'm always wiping glass before and after every hit.  My vapes too.  Its gotten so bad I don't even want to share.  This should help quite a bit.    If I really like it I might get spares for my guests lol.  No dirty mouths on my glass making me sick you god damn savages :P"
bostontrees,2u5ztf,darkrom,2,Sat Jan 31 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the order again!  As far as the platinum cured thing. We did get it tested by an outside 3rd party lab and it is definitely platinum cured silicone. If it wasn't we would be able to sell it for less.   That being said it does still turn white when bent. We called several US silicone manufacturers (DuPont, SmoothOn) and spoke with the scientists and sales people and they said the white color has nothing to do with the type of cure. Anything will change color if you stretch it enough. What they said was the only true way to tell other than a lab test is if it is clear silicone then it will be see thru rather than cloudy.   Hope this put your mind at ease!"
bostontrees,2u401x,jeffiethepirate,7,Thu Jan 29 19:12:56 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this. Look at Wahsington. Look at Colorado. Look at statistics.   Crime is down, money for schools and public projects/whatever is through the fucking roof. Business from tourism is booming. There are very, very few negative things to come from legalization.   How can someone weigh all that evidence and STILL day ""well, it MIGHT be a good idea. Well have to study it...""  Fuck that and fuck them. It is clearly a good idea.   Politicians can be such cunts."
bostontrees,2u401x,PotViking,4,Fri Jan 30 04:37:39 2015 UTC,Are a majority of the reps in the statehouse progressives in their last term with no higher political aspirations?  No?  Then this is (sadly) just a pipe dream.

bostontrees,2tqv35,BluntsWithHash,3,Mon Jan 26 18:34:52 2015 UTC,"If you have a bong and it's under 12"" with minimal diffusion/perc stems you can buy a male quartz nail drop it into your downstem and start dabbing for real cheap on that. Smaller rigs/ lesser diffusion/ simple hole percs = better for dab flavor and potency. Less reclaim condenses on the rig or the slits. IMO you wont need to add any ice to it since that will increase condensation, increasing reclaim etc, etc..  I have a bed bath and beyond creme br√ªl√©e torch and it's worth it. Supposedly they have some sort of lifetime guarantee if your torch fails, you can bring it in and get a replacement. They also have a $15.00 silicone baking mat you can use to prep your dabs and rest your rig on. Remember to use their 20% coupons. IMO skip the head shop for these items.  As for butane I've bought Colibri from Blue Moon for $10 for a large 300ml. All their butane is the same price.  I agree if you want a simple rig you can find most of the cheaper pieces you would find from a local head shop cheaper from dhgate like say: HERE That is if you're willing to wait for it. You can also use sites like ioffer, but they are a pain in terms of communication sometimes. Sometimes I've known head-shop owners are very willing to help you find a piece that can also fit your budget if you don't want to deal with an online sale. Many are willing to bargain as well.   edit: something like THIS is a perfect starter rig. It has a standard sized joint so you can upgrade to better nails (quartz, ceramic, ti) simple hole percs, room for water, small, simple, the glass is thick, and if you ever fall out of love with dabbing you can just get a female flower bowl for it. And if you find something like that in a head shop you can probably bargain it down."
bostontrees,2tqv35,nykwil3281,2,Mon Jan 26 19:37:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't bother getting glass locally unless the uniqueness of a locally handcrafted piece (and you know it's actually local and unique) appeals to you. But unless you're getting a one of a kind rig it's much cheaper to just buy online. 95% of the glass in my local store is all on DHgate for 1/10th of the price.
bostontrees,2tqv35,Captinfucker,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:57:22 2015 UTC,Any recommendations for the best starter units?  What pieces do i need?
bostontrees,2tqv35,Captinfucker,3,Mon Jan 26 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'm not into dabing with rigs. I prefer them in vapes, same as my bud."
bostontrees,2tqv35,nykwil3281,2,Mon Jan 26 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"I'd skip titanium and go quartz domeless in a bucket banger style. like THIS for a nail. Once seasoned, it takes just as much time to heat as titanium, holds heat longer, better for cooler dabs, the see through style matches glass better and lets you see where you're placing your dab, you wont lose your dab to the intake hole as easily, and you can cap it with a glass jar lid to do a low temp dab, and the jointed fitting is great for unrestrictive airflow...ie better hit. They're also cheaper than titanium, more durable than glass, it tastes better I think. Ceramic is nice but damn it takes forever to heat and you will waste a lot of butane. Titanium would come after. Try to avoid nails that go into your piece that usually come free with starter kits. They restrict the airflow when you pull on your piece."
bostontrees,2tqv35,ZackD89,2,Mon Jan 26 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"You can get setup for $200 for sure! I just got into dabbing a few months ago. I went to a few different spots, but made my purchase at Blue Moon. I was able to get an American rig, adjustable Ti nail and dome, torch, butane, and a dabber for $200 even. They let people do water tests there too, so you can check the piece's function before you buy it.  Here's a pic of the goodies. I really like the rig. One honeycomb perc and a splashguard. The Ti nail is in that pic facing down and the included dome is one the right. There's also a Quartz domeless in the pic that I bought later. I also bought the Oil Slick pads later, which I definitely recommend for conservation and keeping your table clean."

If you're going through Leafly there will be a menu available or they will text it to you.  One of the services limited my order to 1/4 oz for the first time, the other one didn't seem to care. (BTW, I can highly recommend the ""variety quarter"" from one of the services, dig around a bit on Leafly and you will find which one I'm referring to.)  When it came time to connect in the ""real world"" they came to my address and I showed them my ID again (although I have to say they weren't really rigorous about that). I handed over the cash (no credit) and they handed over the goods. Total time elapsed was less than 5 minutes. At no point did I feel weird or nervous, both of the delivery guys were pretty chill."

bostontrees,2temyd,member_member5thNov,11,Fri Jan 23 14:56:35 2015 UTC,"It's amazing that one of his statements was that we need to wait and see what CO and WA have accomplished.  What more do you need to see? More tax revenue, lower crime rates, etc....It's all there"
bostontrees,2temyd,member_member5thNov,9,Fri Jan 23 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"That sort of wait and see thing is just entirely disingenuous.  Study after study has confirmed that even the half assed legalization of the Netherlands drops use by teens, reduces crime, and reduces hard drug use.  There are four decades of results to see.    We've seen even better results with full legalization.  $60 million fucking dollars in tax revenue in the first year in CO alone.    Unlike vermont or rhode island drug tourism to Massachusetts would hardly impact overall tourism at all and a few more too stoned people would hardly be a problem for a city used to college drinking issues.  Because of federal regulation all pot business is going to be local small businesses too, isn't that the sort of thing Baker campaigned as being in favor of?"
bostontrees,2temyd,scriptmonkey420,3,Fri Jan 23 15:28:54 2015 UTC,And CO is building more new schools than any other state.
bostontrees,2temyd,mikeisagift,2,Fri Jan 23 19:18:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the wait and see thing is entirely disingenuous. Sure it's been going pretty well in CO and WA for the most part, but legalizing obviously is a pretty revolutionary change, and there's definitely a lot of kinks that those states are fine-tuning. Giving a little wait time to see how they fine-tune everything could mean for a smoother transition for us with less problems to run into. That being said, legalize that shit."

It was almost a perfect day for football, no snow and the temperature was warm.   That being said, I disagree with the rule. I think every team should be able to inflate the balls to their liking. That way no one has an advantage because everyone can hold the ball in a way that makes them comfortable. Everyone has different sized hands so I don't see how having a standard as they do, makes things fair for everyone. Look at what Aaron Rodgers said, he over inflates his because he has big hands. I think the rule should be no foreign substances can be put on the ball and you can't put any gas in the ball other than regular old air.  Anyway, that's my two cents ... Time to shmoke!"

bostontrees,2sjazh,jeffiethepirate,9,Thu Jan 15 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"BOSTON, MA ‚Äî Representative David Rogers (D) of Cambridge will introduce a marijuana legalization bill in the Massachusetts legislature this week for the 2015-2016 legislative session.  The bill was developed by attorney Richard Evans of Northampton, along with a committee of lawyers and activists.  Though some activists in the state may find the regulatory provisions in the bill more restrictive than they would desire, the bill ‚Äî as drafted ‚Äî has many good provisions, including expungement of past convictions, and a very generous home grow provision with no limit on the number of plants.  Also included in the bill are provisions for allowing both retail cannabis sales and cannabis caf√©s.  The deadline for filing bills for the current legislative session in Massachusetts is Friday, and the text of the bill should be available early next week.  We will update this story as more information becomes available.  Meanwhile, residents of Massachusetts are being urged to contact their legislators over the next week, to encourage them to sign on as co-sponsors.  In view of the rapid collapse of marijuana prohibition across the country, this development is more significant than many past efforts. In previous decades, bills such as this one ‚Äî also authored by Mr. Evans ‚Äî have routinely been tabled in the Legislature‚Äôs Judiciary Committee almost without acknowledgement.  However this time, the new chairman of the committee, Senator Brownsberger, is expected to give the bill a fair hearing.  That being said, legislators are a timid bunch, and the repeal of Prohibition in Massachusetts is much more likely to be decided by the voters in 2016. Bay State Repeal and at least one other group are currently working on wording of an Initiative. So, with a number of different proposals in play, the final form of Cannabis Freedom is still up in the air."

bostontrees,2sjazh,EDante,6,Thu Jan 15 19:49:31 2015 UTC,"Just taking a guess here, but possibly provisions relating to age, restrictions on public smoking (outside designated cafes), and dui-related restrictions."
bostontrees,2sjazh,wizard_82,3,Thu Jan 15 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"I think their should be age restrictions, public smoking I think can fall into a grey area if police are reasonable (park bench when nobody is around.. who cares?)...  Dui related restrictions are to be expected I think.  I'd just like to see some actual investment in being able to determine intoxication as opposed to going by metabolites...

I'm kind of frustrated honestly, I dont think its that worth it so far, unless you grow, which I'm not.  I think if I find the right caregiver or coop it will be worth it... but I'm not sure.

bostontrees,2s8p5b,PotViking,6,Tue Jan 13 04:00:09 2015 UTC,"Growing is a bit of a grey area at the moment, as are most things having to do with mass medical marijuana.  the mmj law allows for ""hardship"" grows that must be registered with the state.   Hardship is defined as an inability to get to a dispensary. As there are none open at the moment we all, theoretically, qualify. But the state does require you to register your grow with them--slapping up your patient card on the wall of a grow tent alone isn't enough.  No one in the sub has reported any issues with the state--yet. But most people on here either do not grow (personally I don't have space) or do not talk about their grows here (smartest policy for the moment even with the mmj law).  As dispensaries will, supposedly, begin opening this year some stuff the state has ignored will most likely become issues. They are have already been cracking down on some grey market caregiver sales and will mostly increase as dispensaries open.  Generally what people seem to think is that if you have your card, register with the state, and keep your grow small and clearly for personal use (nine plants or fewer is a good rule of thumb) you should be fine.  But because there is such a lack of clarity and the state regulation is such a clusterfuck be aware that you are still taking some risk by growing.  Your card may get charges dropped against you eventually but you could still face a huge legal headache if your local law enforcement decides to raid you anyway.   They most likely will not but be careful, tell no one, and do not sell or give any away.  Somewhat paradoxically Marty Walsh's stalling on dispensaries theoretically opens up the entire city of Boston to hardship grows. As long is there is no local dispensaries anyone within the city can claim that they must grow their own. His dumbass grandstanding actually produces a significantly larger unregulated production system.  tl;dr yes, the law says you can grow but whole bunch of shit is unsettled so be very careful if you do and keep it small."

I have heard of people printing their temporary card right away, but I am supposed to receive an email after my registration has been processed and if it is renewed I think I can print it then.     CannaCare offered a discount for my renewal, money off per each month you are early but I am not loving them.  The doctor I saw at their Newbury Street office has opened a practice in Salem and he was offering early renewal for $70 though I think it is based on how far you are from your renewal date and mine is in July. I really liked him, though.  He was sweet and compassionate."

I'm still unsure about this re-registration every year thing. I started a thread about it a few weeks ago and have been getting mixed reports as to whether annual re-registration with your doctor is actually needed, versus just the state.

bostontrees,2qy22o,member_member5thNov,1 point,Wed Dec 31 22:08:37 2014 UTC,How are vape leftover edibles for you? They're often a little less intense.
bostontrees,2qy22o,darkrom,2,Fri Jan 2 02:37:26 2015 UTC,Still either nothing or WAY too much.  I just don't even mind anymore. I just avoid edibles lol.
bostontrees,2qy22o,member_member5thNov,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:48:08 2015 UTC,Bummer. Avoiding them does seem like the best idea then.

If I read another ""my mom..."" or ""bad grades..."" thread I'm going to go insane.  Anyway, I'm with you completely. I keep it a secret from the majority of my friends, especially coworkers. It would be nice to be able to be more open about it without the negative stigma."
bostontrees,2quans,Scrapzs,3,Wed Dec 31 01:19:43 2014 UTC,Sucks dude! You shouldn't be shamed for it!
bostontrees,2quans,PotViking,5,Wed Dec 31 01:27:50 2014 UTC,Definitely keep it from coworkers. You never know when there can be a rat in the office. If your company has a random pee test policy you could be screwed. Though I was told by a manager at a company I used to work for that if you pee hot simply say you need help. The company can't fire you and helps with getting help. Not sure of the validity of this.

Daily smokers, gonna grow soon.  Although at parties I just say im gonna smoke a J or whatever and don't hide it. And I usually invite whoever i'm talking with in case they want to join me.

bostontrees,2quans,HugePens,5,Fri Jan 2 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"Turning 30 next year  I'm kinda in the same boat, my main smoke friends moved out of state over the years, still have few friends left that smoke but I barely hang out with them due to work schedules. I know they go out drinking often but I'm a lightweight so I'm not too interested in that. I also don't have a car so that doesn't help either, sigh."
bostontrees,2quans,expat22,7,Wed Dec 31 00:07:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah Buddy, I hear ya.  I just hit 32.  Friends scattered across the USA at this point in my life and just a small group of friends that I have met out here.  I smoke daily, but of course have to hide it from everyone I work with to maintain appearances.  My lady will smoke on occasion, but outside of my ""guy"" that's about it.  Probably like many of us, the bar scene just isn't interesting anymore unless we are in the right mood.  But wearing that MJ Cologne can be uncomfortable, especially when around people you don't know."

bostontrees,2quans,User_Not_Recognized,3,Thu Jan 1 15:36:37 2015 UTC,The pax is all but obsolete now that the air is a more portable solo with a lot of issues fixed. My $0.02
bostontrees,2quans,member_member5thNov,3,Wed Dec 31 01:00:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much. I'm ""officially an adult"" as of a few months ago, and am a daily smoker of several years. I have friends at work who smoke regularly, but we almost never hang out together outside of work. My wife used to in college, but hasn't in years, and most of our friends don't (anymore/hardly ever) either. I am often flying solo."
bostontrees,2quans,member_member5thNov,5,Wed Dec 31 08:23:19 2014 UTC,"I'm the same age and for a while was in similar circumstances. Many of my friends have picked up smoking, thanks in part to my influence, but also because the social acceptance has changed dramatically in the last decade.   A number of friends have found it a better alternative to drinking as they enter their thirties. No calories and suits dinner party thirties sociality quite nicely.   It helps, I think, that I'm fairly successful in my profession and accomplished. It helps get over their DARE stereotypes of stoners who never do anything. For years and years I offered folks a puff when I ducked outside to burn one down. Mostly no one took me up on it.  Now many do.  Modeling that you can be a stable grown up who likes weed and can remain in control under the influence will bring some of your friends around eventually.   So don't worry about stinking. Stink proudly my friend. If anyone mentions it ask if they want some. 9/10 times that's why they mentioned it.   In the meantime come puff with the fine folks of this sub."
bostontrees,2quans,PotViking,5,Tue Dec 30 20:29:45 2014 UTC,"You're right. A lot of people, like a couple of my friends, won't even try it because of the stigma they've attatched to it.  I feel bad for them."
bostontrees,2quans,pemjr,3,Tue Dec 30 23:28:13 2014 UTC,"That sort of thing used to make me feel bad. Now I just feel bad for them too.   Even shitty judgmental comments now I just reply ""Your loss."" or ""You're missing out.""  I have a few friends with terrible migraines for whom it would make a real, medical, improvement to their lives. And yet they refuse. Their loss."
bostontrees,2quans,PotViking,3,Wed Dec 31 01:19:31 2014 UTC,"I'm lucky to have three close friends who smoke. My wife rarely vapes with me, and I generally don't smoke/whatever around her. She has a friend or two who will smoke, so when we go out (with her friends or mine or both or whatever) there's usually someone else who does.  If you're worried about the smell, try vaping dude! I absolutely love my vape and very rarely actually smoke anymore. They're small, discreet, don't smell anywhere near as much as smoking does, and they save weed like a mofo!  I'll talk your ear off about vapes, let me know! :)"
bostontrees,2quans,pemjr,4,Tue Dec 30 20:10:07 2014 UTC,Which one do you use?
bostontrees,2quans,PotViking,2,Tue Dec 30 20:32:39 2014 UTC,"I have the MFLB, and I love it. One trench is about .1 - .2 grams, and will get me to a [4] at least twice, probably more. I don't get absolutely out of my mind high anymore, or at least very, very rarely. I'm too old for that shit now! :D  I've also heard good things about the Pax, the DaVinci, the Vapir, iolite, and Solo..  The MFLB is by far the cheapest, but it does have a slight learning curve (not bad, you'll be hitting it like a champ after a day with it), and uses re-chargeable AA batteries. The others are more expensive, but have more features such as allowing for more precise temp control, etc."
bostontrees,2quans,darkrom,3,Tue Dec 30 20:43:29 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the thorough reply! I have the MFLB and the Arizer Solo, been very happy with both. Happy vaping."
bostontrees,2quans,snoogins355,3,Tue Dec 30 20:53:51 2014 UTC,I'm leaning towards buying a Pax myself. Ever try one? How does it compare to the solo if you have?
bostontrees,2quans,PotViking,3,Tue Dec 30 21:03:37 2014 UTC,Hits harder and is much more portable. Uses a bit more herb but IMO worth it for the portability.
bostontrees,2quans,snoogins355,4,Tue Dec 30 22:38:09 2014 UTC,"I got the pax, Feb 2014. I love the damn thing.  It is silent (uses an electric battery) and looks like something apple would make. People have no idea what it is.  I use it all the time before a movie and enjoy it very much.  The bowl packs less than half a gram and is plenty with the three setting thermostat for temp. The great thing is with the three temperature settings, you can use the bowl three or more times! (at least with me, but I am an conservative smoker) The lightest setting I think you would like, and its color coded yellow, orange, red. Never go to red on a new bowl!!!! (CODE RED!)  Down side, it is on the pricier side, its $250.  But I view it like a prius, it costs along upfront but you save over the long term.  If you would like a ""test drive"" let me know.  I love walking my dog and vaping after work.  EDIT: I've also owned an iolite, which is good as well.  Very portable but it uses butane, so need to but butane to refill the tank on it.  Also when it is heating up it burns the butane making a loud shhhhh noise. I had one for about two years and was happy with it.  Biggest down side was the ignition is like a gas grill push button and can wear out.  I'd have to push the click button at least twenty or more times until it finally lit.  The pax is the best."
bostontrees,2quans,PotViking,3,Wed Dec 31 02:47:13 2014 UTC,"Sounds pretty nice! I'd love to give it a go one day, whereabouts are you? I'm in Plymouth, but I often travel to/through the city for work.   How would you say it compares with the MFLB (if you e used one)?"
bostontrees,2quans,CanoDonta,3,Wed Dec 31 03:45:23 2014 UTC,"Sure, I'm in Somerville.  Never used the MFLB, but I have heard good things about that.  The design and battery are better with the pax (I heard the boxes battery drains fairly quickly).  The pax is kinda price, but it was a good buy."
bostontrees,2quans,Captinfucker,3,Wed Dec 31 15:55:44 2014 UTC,Awesome. Next time I'll be in the area I'll PM you first!
bostontrees,2quans,member_member5thNov,3,Wed Dec 31 23:35:37 2014 UTC,I got one about a year and a half ago. I agree with everything /u/snoogins355 said.
bostontrees,2quans,heytheregirlsimacunt,2,Wed Dec 31 23:45:36 2014 UTC,"Best for portability, better than the MFLB in terms of usage. On the other hand the Solo is not as portable (better for home, car, not as much walking around) and amazing for usage. I think the Firefly is close in price to the Pax and is apparently amazing at everything."

bostontrees,2qh7mv,elephantbuttons,4,Sat Dec 27 02:53:55 2014 UTC,I'm back in town tomorrow. Maybe Stoney Sunday brunch or something?

bostontrees,2qeodo,lights_are_pretty,4,Fri Dec 26 01:47:49 2014 UTC,"Considering this is going to be a huge event with people from all over attending we should try to be on our best behavior if we intend to get more people on board with legalizing. Just dont be stupid, make smoking bud seem normal, but dont be obnoxious. dress nice, smoke away from people and be happy"
bostontrees,2qeodo,ACannabisConnoisseur,5,Fri Dec 26 07:11:10 2014 UTC,"There isn't usually a huge 4/20 event in Boston. The Freedom Rally, which is really the Boston equivalent,  is always in september."
bostontrees,2qeodo,member_member5thNov,5,Fri Dec 26 15:33:45 2014 UTC,I remember this past 4/20 most public spaces were full of people toking and the police were cool with it unless there was any distribution or violence.
bostontrees,2qeodo,member_member5thNov,1 point,Fri Dec 26 15:53:21 2014 UTC,That is very true. I guess it is most accurate to say there isn't a huge organized event.  I do quite enjoy the unorganized ones in all the parks. I might even like it better than a rally.
bostontrees,2qeodo,AK-48,2,Fri Dec 26 19:22:58 2014 UTC,"Additionally it happens to fall on the April vacation (spring break) of alot of schools in our area, so it will be even more crowded."
bostontrees,2qeodo,jtet93,5,Fri Dec 26 01:36:37 2014 UTC,It's a legal holiday in the state anyway. Most public schools schedule April break around Patriot's Day; those that don't still have to close schools that Monday. As far as I'm aware most universities (public and private) are also closed for Patriot's Day.

bostontrees,2qb230,jeffiethepirate,7,Wed Dec 24 20:19:05 2014 UTC,Wife and I met when we both worked at the same Starbucks.  Picked this up at Char So Bees in Weymouth. Awesome find. Can handle nails and bowls.

bostontrees,2q8iqv,Pariguayo,3,Wed Dec 24 02:01:07 2014 UTC,I was thinking about making the exact same thread. If you have too many offers let me know!

It's in great condition, I picked it up in like February and have taken pretty great care of it imo. I myself am also interested in grabbing a bong so if you have one that you're trying to trade...."
bostontrees,2q8iqv,Ender2309,1 point,Wed Dec 24 09:55:10 2014 UTC,"Might I suggest a log vape?   http://underdogvapes.com/vaporizers/vapes-available  Small, direct draw, you can bong vape with it, and if you're a fan of wabi sabi the oils in your hand will make it your own.  Only problem is you need to plug it in. Upside, nothing to charge.   Given the option I'd pick this over a pax, more utility, It's super efficient too, people get it for it's efficiency."

Is that accurate??  Ain't nobody got time for that. Get a Pax, it's the most stealth thing out there, heats up in 30 SECONDS or so, and delivers killer hits."

I bought it off Reddit and the guy swore up and down it was legit...paid nearly full price...still mad about it...  Anyways, doubt anyone is interested in it, but hit me up if you are. I wouldn't even charge half as much as I paid for it, and it comes with one metric shitload of pipe cleaners."
bostontrees,2q2ccq,jeffiethepirate,2,Mon Dec 22 12:46:14 2014 UTC,Time to pay the Southie location a visit then.
bostontrees,2q2ccq,nykwil3281,2,Mon Dec 22 16:29:53 2014 UTC,Anyone know why? did they just loose the space or is it something more worrisome?
bostontrees,2q2ccq,member_member5thNov,3,Mon Dec 22 17:35:39 2014 UTC,I would assume the price of rent on Newbury was too high for the amount of traffic they got.    Edit: today is the last day the Southie location will be open until after the holidays so if anyone wants to make sure they get a registration number hit up your local canna care. I just got my registration #  ...aaaaaaand now I'm registered.

bostontrees,2q2ccq,nykwil3281,2,Tue Dec 23 17:15:05 2014 UTC,What a pain in the ass
bostontrees,2q2ccq,stonah,2,Tue Dec 23 17:17:21 2014 UTC,The doctor I saw at CannaCare Newbury St has opened a practice in Salem.   I received a postcard.  Right now he is cheaper.  He has discounts for people who saw him at the Newbury St location.
bostontrees,2q2ccq,mainegrrl,2,Wed Dec 31 14:55:04 2014 UTC,Awesome thanks for the info
bostontrees,2q2ccq,mainegrrl,2,Wed Dec 31 20:28:30 2014 UTC,No problem.  It seems this process is as confusing and difficult as possible.
bostontrees,2q0y3p,PotViking,6,Mon Dec 22 01:53:04 2014 UTC,"I'd definitely like to hear more about the experience, especially any details you'd like to share on the condition you were seeking the rec for, and the amount of documentation of the condition that was in your medical records.  I ask this because I'm interested in trying to get a card for anxiety and sleep issues, but I'm not sure if that would fly.  Especially since there's nothing about this in my medical records, as I've been self-medicating for years.  Thanks!"
bostontrees,2q0y3p,macanaman,2,Mon Dec 22 03:26:32 2014 UTC,"Went to the one in S. Boston. Walk-in, no appt. Talked to the girl at the desk, she took my info and payment ($200, did not get the card), and I filled out a pretty standard medical questionnaire (with a few extra pot-related questions in it).  After that, I waited ~10 minutes (one guy ahead of me) and went in and sat with a consultant who took my blood pressure/o2 levels and talked to me about pot; the status of it legally, effects, etc. He was pretty cool, and relaxed. We joked some about weed, etc. Then back to the waiting room.  Fifteen minutes later, I sat with the Doctor in another small office/room. Talked about my reasons for wanting MMJ, asked how it helped, etc. He used his stethoscope and tested my reflexes, and entered some notes in his computer.  I have spinal tumors (schwannomas) which are benign but do cause me some nerve pain. I am a high candidate for Neurofibromitosis type 2. The first hour or so of the day, for the past three years, I have severe intercostal pain from a tumor rubbing an intercostal nerve. Makes moving around pretty painful. The other day my wife tied my shoes for me, cause I couldn't bend over to do it. Laying down also hurts, as does sitting for long periods of time.  Anxiety and sleep issues are pretty legit, but you're going to want to see a couple of doctors about them and bring in some medical records to back up what you tell them. I would start with your PC, and he/she can refer you to a specialist that can help you. Once you've spoken with them, get a copy of your records/charts from the visits and bring those.  I brought charts from a pain clinic I've been to recently, all my records from a couple of ER trips, as well as a fuckton of MRI scans on discs. He only looked at the pain clinic ones."
bostontrees,2q0y3p,macanaman,2,Mon Dec 22 03:57:11 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the info, that's very helpful.    I guess I'll have to think about talking to my PCP about my anxiety/sleep stuff.  My problem is that I don't really trust the normal medications that get prescribed for that sort of thing. I had a parent with severe anxiety issues who spent decades on all sorts of different meds and they really took a huge toll on her and the family.    But thanks for the info, and good luck with your condition.  I've never heard of that before, that sure doesn't sound like fun. I really hope the MMJ helps with your pain.  Take care."
bostontrees,2q0y3p,levitatingchicken,3,Mon Dec 22 04:04:53 2014 UTC,You don't need to go through all that. I went into Cannacare in Seekonk and told them that I had issues sleeping and weed helped. I never talked to my primary care about it because I didn't want sleeping pills. I walked out with a recommendation and a couple days ago completed my registration with the state.
bostontrees,2q0y3p,beantowntreeparty,2,Mon Dec 22 12:52:24 2014 UTC,"I agree with Lev Chicken, skip the PCP waste of a trip and copay.  I went to integr8 and they were great. Offered accupunture, chiropractic and cold laser as well."
bostontrees,2q0y3p,Taste_like_Burning,4,Mon Dec 22 17:32:03 2014 UTC,"Send me a message and I'll introduce you to my caregiver. Great guy with flowers, shatter, and edibles."
bostontrees,2q0y3p,graalrasta,3,Tue Dec 23 22:16:54 2014 UTC,"Well, now you're in limbo! There are a few options:   Go to a site like this one and look around on the forums for someone willing to help you out. Regarding the 1 caregiver to 1 patient rule, my understanding is that it is the caregiver who is taking the risk if they have more than that (as a patient how are you supposed to know?). They are also not supposed to accept money in exchange for mmj (only ""donations"" for transportation/equipment, etc.) and they are also not supposed to consume mmj. Currently it seems that the state is cracking down on caregivers who completely flout these laws (such as the people on the Cape who were busted with 70 pounds) but otherwise are not really interested in the other stuff going on.    My limited understanding of the situation is that as a patient, you are pretty much in the clear as long as you have legit documentation, so look for people with good reps and clear communication skills. If your ""radar"" goes off and you feel like something is not quite legit, then listen to that and stay away.   The second option can take longer but is probably more stable: sign up for a grow class. There are a bunch of them like this one in the area that cost $50 or so. The point here is not to learn how to grow for yourself (unless you want to), but to make connections with people who can help you out. There is a pretty big network out there who can provide as a caregiver, you just have to be willing to work a little bit to find them.   Good luck, it's a pretty absurd situation at the moment, but hopefully the dispensaries will begin opening in 2015."
