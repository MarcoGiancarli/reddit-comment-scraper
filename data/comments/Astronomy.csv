The distances are great, so they go into sci-fi style cryogenic suspension or hibernation, with the ship blacked out, moving by momentum and gravity (passively - engines off) on some trajectory to the target star system.  Maybe they sit like this for a hundred years or maybe a thousand or maybe longer (not even accounting for relativistic effects that would alter our own perception of their travel time interval).  Maybe they then arrive at the target planet, spend a long time quietly setting up civilization, and sometimes fail because the conditions aren't right or something goes haywire.  Sometimes they become very active and the target planet becomes a hot spot of activity for a hundred years or so until the resources are exhausted, and they pack up and move on (going back into silent suspension for decades or centuries).  In this scenario, the universe could be teeming with advanced life, but all of it tending to spend way more time blacked out in suspension during travel, than actually active on some planet and making noise for a brief period before moving on."

What were the odds of each event?  Now what are the odds of all those considerations (and many more) happening all together?  People like to use the argument that we ""shouldn't be that special in the universe"" for the notion of E.T. space-faring intelligence. But is it really unreasonable to entertain that we just might be that special? Not because of something divine, or fate, but because our existence is due to extremely slim odds?  Isn't it more arrogant to consider it only from the optimistic perspective, that there should be an abundance space-faring alien races out there due to the sheer number of stars and planets and the age of time for all these things to be happening as we speak?  We should consider both extremes. The Drake Equation puts it in a simple mathematical format. However the unknowns remaining in the equation vary too greatly for us to do anything but speculate, at the moment. Maybe we're the only space faring (albeit in its infancy) life in the entire observable universe, though I highly doubt this by mere gut feeling. Maybe, in our Milky Way galaxy alone, there are millions of highly advanced space faring civilisations; a galactic community thriving far more than we've ever dreamed and envisaged in any of our sci-fi fantasies in books and in film."

Basically the new planets density falls in between the density of a rocky planet and the density of a gaseous planet. Its equivalent to being the density of aluminum if you take the entire planet to be homogeneous.   I suspect the way to expand the analysis would be to take into account the radius and composition of the Earth's core and the strength of the magnetic field at the surface and calculate what the required radius of the core must be to generate an equivalent magnetic field on the new planet's surface assuming the same core density. Then using the size of the new core, calculate its mass and subtract that from the new planets mass. Then calculate the rest of the planets average density using the new mass and the volume of the planet that isn't the core. I am a physics major in college but am just starting my junior year so the calculation for the strength of the magnetic field eludes me. I thought about treating the core as a point charge but then I need to know the charge of the particles contributing to the magnetic field and their velocity both which seem to be budding fields of research.  I also tried using ratios. I took the ratio of the mass of the earth's core to the total mass of the Earth minus the core and found that the core represents a very tiny percentage of the total mass...almost so much so that you can ignore it and assume the density to be homogenous.

Astronomy,3dxxah,nutsacrilege,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:52 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I suppose it is more than possible for an element that is still to be discovered to have the same magnestism as iron, yet have a density far less.   Also, would I be right in thinking that, supposing a planet like this does exist, it wouldn't be possible to hold any more of an atmosphere (volume-wise) than Earth? If so, the larger surface area would cause a thinner atmosphere, making the planet inhabitable."

Astronomy,3dxxah,danweber,6,Mon Jul 20 15:02:29 2015 UTC,"AFAIK the atmosphere is what deflects the charged and non charged particles, but the magnetic field is what prevents the atmosphere from being blown away by the solar winds.  At least I remember reading sometime ago an article saying that there was a theory of that happening on mars, where the atmosphere is much thinner and there's no magnetic field like on earth. If I'm wrong I'd be happy to be corrected, though.. :)"
Astronomy,3dxxah,Namocol,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:07 2015 UTC,"The earth's magnetic field is only partially responsible for the sustainability of our atmosphere. We're the only rocky planet with a magnetosphere of any significant strength in our solar system, yet Mars and Venus both have significant atmospheres.  The magnetosphere deflects the charged particles of the solar wind, and that accounts for a large portion of our shielding. However, heavy ions, atoms, and CME's often make it through the magnetosphere. These collide with the upper atmosphere and carry away atmospheric mass into deep space. On earth, this atmospheric loss is more than compensated for with natural processes like volcanism.  On Mars, there used to be volcanoes, but because Mars lacks internal heating it eventually solidified and the volcanoes dried up. With this solidification of the mantle and outer core, the magnetosphere quickly disappeared. Add to that mars's low mass and over the millennia, mars's atmosphere has slowly dissipated.   On Venus, there is rampant volcanism, but it lacks a magnetosphere. This is because Venus is theoretically liquid all the way through and is nearly tidally locked with the sun so it doesn't get any of that good Dynamo action. Add to that the high mass of Venus (about 89% that of earth I think) it has the gravitational force to hold onto the gas surrounding it despite the constant wear on the atmosphere. It's like filling a bucket full of holes. Water is going to get everywhere, but as long as you keep filling, the bucket will never be empty."
Astronomy,3dxxah,Echo104b,4,Mon Jul 20 18:53:20 2015 UTC,But a nearly-constant magnetic field is what prevents the atmosphere from getting blown away by the solar wind.
Astronomy,3dxxah,craigiest,3,Mon Jul 20 15:32:13 2015 UTC,"It's mostly gravity. Venus has no magnetic field, but its gravity is strong enough to retain a thick atmosphere."
Astronomy,3dxxah,jswhitten,3,Mon Jul 20 16:07:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that atmosphere is almost totally carbon dioxide, which is a relatively heavy molecule. It's thought that lighter molecules like water were stripped away from Venus.   Similarly, Mars has had its atmosphere almost totally stripped, and what remains is almost exclusively carbon dioxide."
Astronomy,3dxxah,thebiggestbooty,3,Mon Jul 20 16:44:05 2015 UTC,"Venus' atmosphere has about as much N2 as Earth's does, and N2 and O2 are about the same weight.  It's true that Venus lost its water, and the lack of magnetic field likely made it easier for that to happen, but there are a lot of variables. The greater mass of this hypothetical planet, plus its location in the habitable zone farther from the sun, would make it better at retaining an atmosphere than Venus. Venus' oceans vaporized due to the runaway greenhouse effect, which made it lose water much faster.  I can't say whether a planet as described would have a magnetic field like Earth's, and if it didn't whether it would be habitable, but it's plausible."
Astronomy,3dxxah,jswhitten,0,Mon Jul 20 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"However, the atmosphere wouldn't nearly be as effective as it is on Earth. If we had a planet with twice the surface area, and the same gravity, the atmosphere it can hold will be the same mass and volume. However, this atmosphere would be spread more, meaning it would be thinner.  That, coupled with a weakened or non-existant magnetic field would mean solar wind has a far more devistating effect.  I imagine it would be similar to the situation on Mars in terms of atmosphere loss and solar radiation."

We can speculate and assume, but it is unlikely we will ever know anything more than short term effects.

Volume grows by the cube of the radius, so assuming the same density, a planet with double the surface area would have four times the mass. yes, you'd be further away from the center of the planet, but it would still be more than double the gravity.   However, what they want is double the surface area with no change to the gravity. So they need something a lot less dense than the earth (but not quite a quarter, because you're further away from the center).   Question is more if you could make the earth out of something that would hold structural integrity at that size with that density, and if it would then support life through magnetics fields etc.   It's a complicated problem!"
Astronomy,3dxxah,jama211,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:39 2015 UTC,"Since surface area goes as the square, to double it you need a factor of sqrt(2) increase in radius. Since volume goes as the cube you would have a volume increase of 23/2, or a little under 3 times the mass at equal density. Then, since surface acceleration goes as mass over radius squared this works out back to sqrt(2) increase, which is easy to see since at equal density and for the sake of proportions we've basically got mass equal to volume so acceleration is radius cubed over radius squared and we're back to just the first problem of radius change given surface area change. You put the wrong factor somewhere in your first paragraph."

Also, note that right now would be an awful time to try finding Pluto visually - it's currently crossing through the Milky Way in Sagittarius, and would be impossibly difficult to pick out against all the other 14th magnitude stars in the field of view.  Imaging would make this a bit easier, assuming you have a good enough camera. The scope wouldn't need to be nearly as large since long exposures will find Pluto in smaller scopes (but you'd still need to have ample magnification since the motion of Pluto is very minor).

Even with that amount of light, it wouldn't really heat the planets up super quick like you may think. Most of the effects would come from the huge amounts of energy in the higher end of the EM spectrum (electromagnetic.) This would include things like X-rays and Gamma rays.

The stars that are visible in the night sky naked eye, no, the vast majority of them are not dead yet. Most of the stars you can see there are within 2,000 light years of Earth (and most are much closer than that). As u/Tmurr95 pointed out, spectroscopy is used to determine the type and therefore approximate age of a star. We know about the time when many stars are about to go nova / supernova. Most of the stars you see in the night sky are those ""long burners"" - not likely to go supernova anytime soon, and even the 'fast burners' (the hot, large, blue-white stars) aren't either.   There's really just a few red giant stars that are 'close' to going nova/supernova (such as Betelgeuse). And by 'close,' that means sometimes in the next 10,000 to 100,000 years. If Betelgeuse went supernova in the 1400's, well, we'll know pretty darned soon as it's about 600 light years away. If it went supernova tomorrow, our ancestors in the 2600's will know, as its light takes ~600 years to reach us (there's some debate over how far away Betelgeuse really is, but that's another matter).  But if you're talking about stars in far off galaxies, well, SOME of them have ""died"" and gone nova/supernova without us knowing - and professional astronomers catch supernova popping off pretty regularly - but that's still only ONE supernova per galaxy, which are filled with billions of stars each. On top of that, many galaxies you can see with a small telescope are on the order of millions/tens of millions of light years away (some hundreds of millions), and many stars last billions of years. So even many of those stars haven't died yet, even though their light won't reach Earth for millions of years."

Astronomy,3ds4sd,grapp,4,Sat Jul 18 22:50:22 2015 UTC,"First, let's recall the first two requirements:   It is in orbit around the Sun: This way we don't classify satellites as planets. However, this does become a little vague when considering systems like Pluto where the largest satellite is nearly as massive as the ""planet"" it orbits - begs the question about binary planets (same could be somewhat said for the Earth-Moon system). It has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium: This way, we don't consider very small bodies as being planets. In many ways, this requirement is a bit redundant since there would be very few cases where this requirement wouldn't be met while requirement #3 would be met.   So, let's imagine a case where these are the only two requirements to be called a planet. For the first requirement, let's ignore the binary planet problem and assume the most massive body in the planetary system is the only one that can be considered a planet. This leaves us with only the current 8 planets and the 5 known dwarf planets. However, these 13 are the only ones that we have currently discovered. As of right now, there are also 10 other objects that may be classified as dwarf planets in the future, which could bring out number now to 23. In the future, as telescopes continue to improve, it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility that many more objects in the Kuiper Belt and beyond could be found that satisfy these two requirements, making the list of ""planets"" ever-longer. So, cue the third requirement:   It has ""cleared the neighborhood"" around its orbit: This way, only bodies that are dominant in their orbits are considered as planets, essentially ruling out Ceres in the asteroid belt and all the big objects (including Pluto) in the Kuiper Belt that we've found thus far.   So, in short,  TL;DR: Because there could possibly be way more than 13, and no elementary/primary school kid wants to learn the names of 23+ planets. 8 is just a nice number."

Why would they need to? They could just learn the 8 major planets, whether dwarf planets are considered planets or not. Just like they might learn the names of the Galilean moons but not Jupiter's other 60 or so satellites.

But, in the case that dwarf planets are considered planets, why learn those eight planets? What would make those eight stand out above any other set of eight? That's the whole purpose of having that third requirement - it tells you why those eight are significant, albeit in a vague and not 100% future-proof kind of way.   No one has a problem with the current definition of ""star"" even though there are far too many stars for kids to memorize their names.   You bring up a really good point, but I disagree in the analogy. We can [relatively] easily define a star as any ball of gas that has enough mass to sustain hydrogen burning, whereas the planet thing is a little harder since there are so many variables. Plus, in the case of stars, the naming thing has been and never really will be an issue, since there's only one star that has a significant amount of importance to us and doesn't really need an inclusive category, but I digress."

Astronomy,3ds4sd,AndrewT81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"The problem I've always had with the ""cleared the neighborhood"" requirement is that it means to be classified as a planet bodies need to be more and more massive as you go farther out in the solar system.  If there were a Earth sized body out somewhere past Neptune it almost certainly would not have ""cleared the neighborhood"" because its orbit would just be so huge.   That just seems weird a ""dwarf"" planet that's around as massive as our home planet and more massive then two other ""normal"" planets.   Go far enough out from the Sun even the gas giants might not be massive enough to remove any other orbit crossing bodies.  While WISE ruled out any other gas giants lurking out in the solar system, there are other solar systems that have gas giants orbiting much farther out than our own."

Seems contradictory, but it's not.   Anyway, storm got worse last night, and just sort of set up right over us. Before it had finished, power went out, and our basement flooded. Fortunately, we long ago learned how to prepare for that kind of thing, so nothing ruined. Just a fair amount of wet mess still this morning that will take a few days to full dry out, now that power's back on and the sump pumps have removed the standing water."

It uses the shadows and light direction as reference points. It is used mostly to depict the surface of sculptures, to give an idea of how it would look in 3-dimensions.

Better yet, would be LiDAR data, used to create acurate digital elevation models (DEM's) of the planets surface. Basically any 3-D program uses the same process to texture a plane or model using these grey-scale images as a bump map. GIS software does the same thing, generally overlaying orthographically correct images on one of these DEM ""bump maps"" to produce 3-D topography. From there you can use ArcScene (part of ArcGIS) or qgis2three.js (plug in for the fine FOSS GIS software: QGIS) to produce these interactive models and animations. At least, that's how I'd do it."

In other words, its crust was made of rocks like our ocean floors, and didn't have much of the granite that makes our continents.  This new data shows the presence of granite forming minerals in a number of samples.   They then combine that result with other measurements of the density of the southern hemisphere (it isn't mentioned but I assume that data comes from gravity measurements made by orbiters) and conclude that mars does have significant amounts of the sort of rocks that make up our continents.

Astronomers expected Pluto to have a moderate amount of cratering on the surface due to repeated collisions with objects from the Kuiper belt. The first hi-res image had none. The mountainous terrain confirms that Pluto must have had some level of geologic activity. The lack of craters confirms that it was recent. Changes on the surface of the planet will tend to ""clean off"" the impact craters.  When I say recent, I'm parroting the New Horizons team. I think the time-frame they determined was within the last 100 million years - very recently considering that the solar system is ~4.6 billion years old.   It's all evidence that Pluto is far from the ice ball that many people expected. Pluto was, and still may be, geologically active. Very exciting!"

It wouldn't make much sense to send the probe at some random little rock we don't know anything about whatsoever.    Fun Fact - Pluto almost wasn't picked due to project requirements and timing, not budget.  Jupiter had to be in the right position and the only possible launch date happened to be when Pluto was against the background of the Milky Way.  Funding had been approved on the condition the probe could visit two KBO's, yet it would be impossible for Hubble to find another KBO candidate beyond Pluto until it had cleared itself from the bright plane of the galaxy.  Based on the Kuiper Belt density and distribution, the team statistically proved it would be impossible for fewer than 3 candidates to exist and most likely there were 5 objects behind Pluto which could be found later while already in transit.  Statistical proof was good enough for the US government's money men and Pluto was approved."

Of course, that could lead to Jupiter being classified as a super-cool Brown Dwarf Binary with the Sun... which would certainly make for a more interesting 3rd grade science class.  Before New Horizons reached its destination, though, I always wondered what we would have sent if Voyager 1 would have opted for a Pluto rendezvous rather than Titan.

Astronomy,3dezmt,Patius,0,Thu Jul 16 05:26:54 2015 UTC,"""Closer"" is relative, if I'm at exactly the north pole with minus 60 degrees i can step a little closer to the tropics, a few miles even, it wouldn't be actually warmer.  Neptune is really far ways from the sun, Pluto is even more, and in those rare years when it's closer it's not that warmer.  Just look at titan in Saturn."
Astronomy,3dezmt,esmifra,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:42:52 2015 UTC,"Look buddy. Closer may be relative but it sure fucking counts with pluto. When it is close the gases get energy and vaporize. When it is far they refreeze. Did you read anything of these?  http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/feb/HQ_10-033_Pluto.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Pluto  ""Pluto's elliptical orbit is predicted to have a major effect on its atmosphere: as Pluto moves away from the Sun, its atmosphere should gradually freeze out. ""  ""Pluto's seasons are asymmetric because of its elliptical orbit. Spring transitions to polar summer quickly in the northern hemisphere, because Pluto is moving faster along its orbit when it is closer to the sun. ""  Read things."
Astronomy,3dezmt,Iamadinocopter,0,Thu Jul 16 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not your buddy, moron and if I write without an attitude I expect the same thing from others on a constructive conversation. If you don't know how to communicate with people avoid discussion threads.  I read things, and i know how to communicate with others, i wished i could say the same for you! But if you want I'll bring the discussion to your level.  As I wrote, the changes in temperature, although Pluto has a elliptical orbit, are not enough to melt or liquify most materials. Maybe methane and a few other gases but only a marginal part of it, if you know how to read (looking at sources you even provided) the atmospheric pressure, you'll realize (if you are capable of such) that the amount of ice/liquid formed from such slim atmosphere would not be enough to change or cover any surface in any meaningful way. You understand what micro bar is right?  Mars for example has an atmosphere thousands of times thicker than Pluto, and the variations between seasons are a lot more significant than Pluto, and you still see craters on the surface.  So learn how to communicate or stfu before looking like a stupid stubborn moron that is contradicting everyone that are telling you that the atmosphere alone wouldn't be enough for the lack of craters."
Astronomy,3dezmt,esmifra,0,Thu Jul 16 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"Mars doesn't have an atmosphere that freezes.  The attitude is because all of everyone's questions were provided in the links. The links show pretty well that the change in orbit is a significant change and that it makes the gases change phase. Gases changing phase means that they get off the ground from being solids and come out from the ground as gases then go back down when thy get too cold.  It is so simple, there is a wiki article that explains it.  But NOOOOO, everyone has to go argue that despite the clear evidence to the contrary the change in distance to the sun is meaningless."
Astronomy,3dezmt,Iamadinocopter,0,Thu Jul 16 17:20:35 2015 UTC,That's a nice thought but if that were the case then our moon would be more smooth as well.
Astronomy,3dezmt,TheSilentSpoon,6,Wed Jul 15 22:49:03 2015 UTC,absolutely not. The moon doesn't have the same materials pluto does.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Pluto
Astronomy,3dezmt,Iamadinocopter,0,Wed Jul 15 23:31:44 2015 UTC,Absolutely so. The moon has virtually no atmosphere so I don't see what you are trying to compare.
Astronomy,3dezmt,TheSilentSpoon,0,Sun Jul 19 20:57:46 2015 UTC,"Still no. The moon has no atmosphere because it has no volatile materials like water, methane, etc that are abundant farther out in the solar system. Pluto has a significant amount of the volatile materials that change phase when it comes closer to the sun. The moon is volcanic rock and it sits in the same distance from the sun.   There is absolutely no evidence that would support what you say about the moon would be crater-less if pluto is."
Astronomy,3dezmt,Iamadinocopter,0,Sun Jul 19 21:12:55 2015 UTC,"Shaking my head at why I'm even bothering responding to this... but here it goes. The moon is not geologically active, therefore whenever a crater is formed, it stays there for a long time. The moon is exposed to the same amount of solar wind that the earth is. Pluto however, is still geologically active. Therefore, it's surface is 'refreshed' after a meteor creates a crater. Pluto is so far away from the sun that heat generated from solar wind can be considered negligible, even at its points of orbit inside the orbit of Neptune. The evidence supporting my claim is that the fluence of solar particles follow the inverse square law. If you would like a further explanation or still do not understand, just ask and I can keep going. I'm on mobile so sorry for not typing an entire chapter."
Astronomy,3dezmt,TheSilentSpoon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:12:03 2015 UTC,So despite the many sources that say that the solar radiation change from pluto's varying orbit is significant you're insisting that it isn't.  Ok buddy. The geological activity on pluto I'm willing to bey a lot of money on is entirely dependent on the orbit and the change in radiation.
Astronomy,3dezmt,Iamadinocopter,2,Sun Jul 19 22:39:42 2015 UTC,Bingo.    I read in the AMA the surface temperature in the day is something like -350ºF.  Very little radiation from the Sun for sure.
Astronomy,3dezmt,drpinkcream,4,Wed Jul 15 23:09:12 2015 UTC,Well there you go missing a whole lot of variables. The composition of the moon is mostly volcanic rock and virtually noting else. Pluto is an icy body with frozen gases.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Pluto
Astronomy,3dezmt,Iamadinocopter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:33:09 2015 UTC,"The fact that basically nothing has collided with it I guess is important. I don't think that should really be unexpected though, considering how low Pluto's mass is."
Astronomy,3dezmt,xXISCOPEIXx,15,Wed Jul 15 21:14:25 2015 UTC,"It is quite unexpected and quite important. Pluto may be small, but it's still big enough to have plenty of gravity, as shown by the number of moons, and it's in an area heavily trafficked by other smaller bodies (which is actually the reason it was demoted from planet status, since it has been unable to clear the area of its orbit). Look at Mercury, for example, which is heavily cratered despite being not that much bigger than Pluto.  To answer /u/AvengeTheEve's question, the fact that it doesn't show significant cratering is an indication that it is potentially very geologically active, which is important, unexpected and actually rather exciting. It's not likely that the craters didn't happen, it's just that they've been covered up by constant activity. Given the tiny amounts of energy avaialble from the sun at that distance, we were expecting a cold dead rock, or a cold dead ball of ice. Pluto seems very much alive, we're discovering."
Astronomy,3dezmt,cecilkorik,6,Wed Jul 15 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"Mercury's cratering can be attributed to it's being so close to the Sun, which pulls pretty much everything out past Pluto towards itself. So there should be a higher density of shit to run into it there, right? Pluto is so far away from the Sun that the only thing pulling objects towards it is its own gravity, which isn't much. This is all conjecture and I'm not a scientist."
Astronomy,3dezmt,xXISCOPEIXx,6,Wed Jul 15 21:34:49 2015 UTC,"Yes I was just using that as a rough comparison, but you're right it's not a perfect one. There is no perfect comparison in the solar system, Pluto is very much on its own, doing its own thing and has no direct analog that we can point to and say ""it should be like that"". At least none that we have yet studied, which is part of why this mission is so interesting. The fact remains that by all accounts significant cratering was expected on Pluto. We have found basically none, and that is fascinating as people try to figure out exactly why, although the theories that have already come up seem to fit all the new facts we have so far quite nicely."
Astronomy,3dezmt,cecilkorik,3,Wed Jul 15 21:42:54 2015 UTC,"The surface of Mercury is extremely old, and it's made entirely of rock, so the craters only degrade due to micrometeorite impacts. There's a lot more debris out in the Kuiper belt than near Mercury, because there are no large planets in the Kuiper belt to capture the debris. Pluto still gets impacted regularly (all solar system bodies do), but its icy surface can melt and flow in ways that a rocky surface cannot."
Astronomy,3dezmt,Gorthaur111,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:55:07 2015 UTC,"But isn't the Kuiper belt there just because of the low impact rate that far out, while Mercurius is so swissy just because it is central and has been bombarded so much more?   AFAIK the traffic have been much denser closer to the sun but they have all impacted other stuff and formed larger stuff, while at Pluto's place there's plenty stuff left just because a lack of mergings.  Is activity really more probable than just low rates of impact?"
Astronomy,3dezmt,Ballongo,3,Wed Jul 15 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"Right. Collisions aren't that common, but it's theorized that the left lobe of Pluto's ""heart"" might actually be a decayed impact crater."

Astronomy,3dezmt,islandjustice,13,Wed Jul 15 19:32:28 2015 UTC,"I came late to the conference, did I understand wrong or they said something about possible thermal activity from Pluto itself?"
Astronomy,3dezmt,lalop,36,Wed Jul 15 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"Brief synopsis:  Since there are no significant external tidal forces acting on Pluto (since Charon is too small/distant/tidally locked), and since no impact craters are visible in this photo, then models suggest that the surface we see here is only a few hundred million years old at most.  That means that there must be some sort of thermal activity from Pluto itself refreshing the surface.  They briefly discussed two possible mechanisms for internal heat:  Radioactive decay (which drives a lot of heat on Earth), or a vast underground ocean that is in the process of slowly freezing and releasing heat to the surface."
Astronomy,3dezmt,wildgurularry,19,Wed Jul 15 20:36:58 2015 UTC,"And as for the ice, there are giant mountain ranges akin to the Rockies in the US. Because other types of ice (like methane) are too brittle to support the weight, they have concluded that it must be water ice."

Astronomy,3dezmt,wildgurularry,40,Thu Jul 16 10:59:34 2015 UTC,Also that the planet is still active.   The DWARF planet is still active.  Don't let Pluto get too big of a head just because we're paying attention to it now.

Astronomy,3dj6z6,MahMetaMeme,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:26:57 2015 UTC,He might not be entirely knowledgeable about the Pluto debate but I think he's dead on about the AU jumping the gun. Pluto is closer in scale to the earth than the earth is to Jupiter and yet we see gas giants that make Jupiter look like a joke. We still call them planets. Our sun is barely comparable to some of the other stars out there in our own galaxy yet we still call all of them stars once they hit a critical mass. If you want to argue that is different because it's a a binary dwarf system then please consider that earth and the moon is also a binary planetary system (even though we aren't used to thinking about it in that way). If we keep up this arbitrary criteria of what a planet is then we are going to end up finding more and more planetary-non-planets.  And as far as being able to clean up its orbit: It doesn't take a lot of geometric knowledge to understand that the larger a circumference the larger the distance traveled and area covered and the larger an orbit the longer it takes to make one pass. Pluto and other kuiper objects haven't (and might never) have enough time to achieve that kind of clearance. And what if Pluto was once in a nominal orbital plain before it became locked to Charon's influence and that cause the odd inclination? Does that mean it was once a planet and it isn't now? The rotation of Venus is longer than its year and unlike the other classical planets it spins backwards. We don't take that into consideration as to what constitutes a planet because in the end this is all just an exorcize in trying to keep our model of the solar system simple and classical and I find that scientifically dishonest and somewhat cowardly.
Astronomy,3dj6z6,kotzwuerg,2,Fri Jul 17 08:19:38 2015 UTC,"Oh we do take the history of Pluto (or Venus) into consideration, that is one of the strongest indicators as to why we don't call it a planet: Pluto formed outside the ""Planet zone"" and was part of a debris disk until the late heavy bombardement cleared most of it and only a small fraction remained (see this image for the biggest known trans-neptunian objects). Pluto not only not cleared its neighborhood, it is trapped in a 3:2 resonance with Neptune together with thounsands(or more) other objects. On the other hand when Venus was formed, it was not part of a debris disk, it is also way bigger and gravitationally not dominated by another planet (like Pluto is dominated by Neptune).   You finding scientists dishonest and cowardly without knowing what you're talking about is just an exercise in trying to keep your model of the solar system simple and classical and I find that scientifically dishon... ahhhh I meant I think you're stupid."
Astronomy,3dj6z6,MahMetaMeme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:50:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm stupid and totally not taking into considerations that other solar systems have far more extreme examples such as large gas giants orbiting 4x that of Pluto's/Neptune's orbit with a comparably host star.  What about planets (or whatever the AU decided to classify them as) that are in orbital sync with multiple host stars and might even swap host stars from time to time. Most of the outer gas giant's moons were kuiper objects (the kuiper belt would extend closer in if not for the giants) so what about examples of other systems that lack giants or still have them in close orbital lock and ""moons"" like Titan or Ganymede sit between Saturn and Neptune. It's likely that the entire solar system as we know it was reshuffled so please don't accuse me of wanting to defend the classical model when I actually apply my ability to extend my observations beyond our solar system and also beyond our current time.  The bottom line is that there will always be fringe examples but the line we drew in the sand was and is still is the only thing here that is stupid and as we discover more we're going to have to re-investigate our own definitions. Also, as far as I can tell all the planets are in resonance so that example is useless. And I covered the whole aspect of orbital clearance and why that just doesn't apply that far out.  Even Neil Degrasse Tyson admits that if we started out on a gas giant we wouldn't consider Earth a planet. It's still arbitrary.  Also I like how you think there's consensus on the matter.  EDIT: Calling someone else stupid when they've already addressed the points you bring up is repugnant."
Astronomy,3dj6z6,kotzwuerg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:01:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't call you stupid because of your argumentation. I think you are stupid because you called scientists, experts in their fields, ""dishonest and cowardly"" because you disagree with them without being an expert yourself.  To your arguments:     The IAU definition is only for the (our) solar system.  The ""reshuffling"" of the solar system is a well known and accepted hypothesis (see ""Nice model"", we still don't know if something like this happened though). No two planets are currently  in a resonance (The Nice model actually proposes a Saturn-Jupiter resonance about 800Myr after the formation of the solar system which caused the Late Heavy Bombardment).  Why should ""orbital clearance"" not apply after a certain distance to the star? I mean that's the point, only in a certain region around the star is enough material and the timescales are short enough to form (giant) planets. According to the standard planet formation model, Earth and the other terrestrial planets formed after the giants. There formed planetary embryos close in, but not with enough mass to explain our planets (still up to 50 times more massive than Pluto). Jupiters gravity made the embryos overcome isolation again, which made them collide and grow into our terrestrial planets.     In the end it is just a mostly unimportant definition which will probably change in the future, and we will settle on a definition for brown dwarfs, gas giants, terrestrial planets and many other objects. Even if there is not a clear distinction possible. But in the meantime have some more trust in scientists, they (mostly) know what they are doing."
Astronomy,3dj6z6,MahMetaMeme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"they (mostly) know what they are doing.   I completely agree with you there and what I meant was that I found the decision, and to be more accurate, when they made it to be a bit stupid. I thought that facing the idea of having to classify a whole range of objects as planets and then decide to denounce them instead is a bit cowardly because I am privy to at least the main arguments presented. I did not mean to call the actual scientist stupid or cowardly as that is basically an oxymoron.   The IAU definition is only for the (our) solar system.   Oh, well actually that is kinda straight up stupid shortsighted. Does completely break my argument because then you can also argue that it only represents the sol system as it is presently.   No two planets are currently in a resonance   Depends if you count Charon and Pluto as planets :P but I would argue that resonance in a stable system like our own is almost guaranteed. I would also argue that Venus' nonsensical spin and huge hot atmosphere is due to it being one of the more recently (and probably more violent) reshuffles of the solar system. But yes, still just theoretical with little in the way of definitive proof.   Why should ""orbital clearance"" not apply after a certain distance to the star?   Massive terrestrial planets can be found at the outer regions of solar systems but not in the case of Sol so that's were I guess the argument has to stop. Well, there is Ceres... it's about 1/3 of the asteroid belt mass and along with Vista has done a pretty good job in that regard. But I think this is the region of our solar system were orbital clearance gets really hard due to the larger area to clear over the same time frame and also being at the edge of the gas giant's influence. Now I understand that Ceres is really tiny but it is rounded by it's own gravity and pretty much would be classified as a planet if not for it's minute size."
Astronomy,3dj6z6,kotzwuerg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:51:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe the definition was a bit shortsighted, but it can easily be generalized to other systems. Remember that the first exoplanet was discovered in 1995! This is all very new to us and we have a hard time explaining for example hot Jupiters and very far out Jupiters, so before we know how, when and where they formed it would be a bit fast. Although many questions about them are unanswered, we can explain very far out Earths, they probably were just scattered there by giant planets. Additionally we never needed the definition for exoplanets because currently we can only detect more massive planets close the the star or really giant planets very far out. Who knows how long it will take to actually confirm the first small body far out where we actually know that it's part of a debris disk. That is a really hard task (impossible with current technology) and will probably still be a really hard task in 50 years.  Well if our current solar system configuration is stable, there will never be a resonance again. Resonances can only happen when the bodies are moving and migrating. Also most resonances are unstable and scatter the smaller body.  Do you have a source for Venus being in a resonance recently, or being ""reshuffled""? I've never heard about that."

My hopes are with this  The idea that Venus is a recently reshuffled planet is more a hypothesis afaik. It's just a means to explain why it has the characteristics you would expect from a newer planet and no one that I know of has any plausible explanation for its anti-spin other than it being caused by a foreign force. I'm also using ""recent"" in the astronomical sense. This is something I heard a long time ago so I would pretty much have to re-source it."

Venus also have extremely well preserved craters, no matter what age you attribute them to. Either (by estimates I've only just looked up) it's 400-600 million years old in formation because Venus heats up and melts its crust periodically or it went through some massive turmoil that scarred the ever-loving shit out of it and hasn't had much change since then.

Astronomy,3d8qc9,sswavess,21,Tue Jul 14 17:15:35 2015 UTC,Pluto is about 4.5 light hours away. And I guess this image was taken from a million km or so. Also they will release the closest approach pictures on Wednesday. Stay tuned!  Edit:Spelling
Astronomy,3d8qc9,flashbunnny,7,Tue Jul 14 18:00:51 2015 UTC,"4.5 Light hours actually but the transmit rate is about 1kB/s 2Kbps (thanks /u/giantsparklerobot and /u/ASovietSpy) so it will take a while for the best pictures to get to us.  The probe has 2 cameras, the high res camera will be sending us the huge pictures it took during the flyby for the next year or so, it's gonna be a long download.  We will probably still be seeing amazing new pictures in 2016."
Astronomy,3d8qc9,esmifra,9,Tue Jul 14 13:42:47 2015 UTC,"Small correction there, the downlink data rate at Pluto is about 2 kilobits per second with both transmitters active. With checksums and error correction that's likely a data transfer rate of about 1.5kbps. At that rate it takes between 45 minutes to an hour and a half to receive a single channel image from the LORRI sensor. When only a single transmitter is active the data rate is cut in half so it takes twice as long to get that data. New Horizons is like a 1200bps BBS where the only door game is Deep Space Probe Adventure: Pluto."
Astronomy,3d8qc9,giantsparklerobot,6,Tue Jul 14 13:50:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed explanation. Didn't knew Horizons has 2 transmitters. But the bandwith is truly limited.  I've always wondered how does the communication protocol works... With a 9hour latency when some data is lost and wasn't received does earth requests to repeat it or do we use some system in order to guarantee they can recover some of the lost data?
Astronomy,3d8qc9,esmifra,7,Tue Jul 14 15:22:09 2015 UTC,"To be a bit clearer, New Horizons has two radio amplifiers. One is a backup but both can be powered simultaneously for a stronger signal and thus a higher downlink rate. In radio communications the signal to noise ratio is a determinant in the data rate. Increasing the power of the signal (using multiple amplifiers) increases the signal to noise ratio and allows more data to be sent. If you were whispering in a loud room it would be hard to understand what you were saying. If you spoke a little louder it would be easier to hear what you were saying.   New Horizons uses a technique called forward error correction. This adds redundancy to the transmission in a correctable way. If some of the data is lost the loss can be detected. The received data can also be processed to figure out what data was lost. The data stream is also packetized so if retransmission is required only the corrupted packets need be sent.  The other aspect of the probe's communications is that they are handled by the onboard programming. The probe is programmed to gather data, aim itself at Earth, and then begin transmitting. Because the science instruments and main transmitter are mounted on the body it needs to aim itself to either collect science data or transmit to Earth. NASA doesn't need to send it a command and then wait 9 hours for a reply for all the data the probe sends. There's also no need to acknowledge every packet the probe sends. NASA just sends a list of packets that need retransmission and the probe assumes all the others were received properly. This works because of the error correction/detection."

Astronomy,3d8qc9,giantsparklerobot,4,Tue Jul 14 22:13:31 2015 UTC,"Okay. So, just for us noobs - how long does it take to transfer one of these images?"
Astronomy,3d8qc9,pearlmuter,4,Wed Jul 15 02:02:21 2015 UTC,The LORRI sensor is 1024x1024 pixels with 8 bits (one byte) per pixel. A single uncompressed image from the sensor is one megabyte. The 1kbps data rate works out to about 125 bytes per second. Forward error correction adds redundant data to the transmission so errors can be detected and corrected without retransmission. This can potentially increase the data needed to be sent by 75%.   The image data can be losslessly compressed on the probe to not only save storage space but also reduce transmission time. This compression can offset the redundant data needed for the error correction. Compression could take the 1MB image down to about 840KB (a 20% savings) and then error correction takes it back up to 1.5MB.   All that means if New Horizons took a picture with LORRI right....now and started transmitting it we on Earth would begin to receive it at 13:12UTC and would complete about 16:25UTC. The transmission time per image is about 3 hours and 15 minutes (based on my calculations which have several guesses).

Astronomy,3d8qc9,Royal_Hustler,-2,Tue Jul 14 12:44:36 2015 UTC,"If new horizons is slowing down, the  Voyagers are too.  Unless they have reached the suns escape velocity (which I assume they have) they will eventually return to the inner solar system, but while they are in the suns area of influence gravity will affect them and slow their velocity to a point.  So with that in mind, new horizons may eventually be further out, but it could take centuries.  n.b. I never said they would return, I merely stated that they only could if they hadn't reached escape velocity. Sorry for trying to be internally consistent and skeptical of myself guys!"
Astronomy,3d8qc9,obliviious,0,Tue Jul 14 22:47:29 2015 UTC,"None of them will return to the solar system.

But, just to keep you happy, here is what I found out.   To summarise, New Horizons will never 'overtake' Voyager on terms of distance from the sun, because both of the Voyager spacecraft benefited from multiple slingshot manoeuvres on the way out of the system, which boosted their speeds to the point they are now travelling at around 17km/s. New Horizons is currently travelling at 14km/s, but will have slowed down to around 13km/s in 32 years (which would put it chronologically on par with the Voyager comparison).  Your turn.

Astronomy,3d8qc9,obliviious,8,Fri Jul 17 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"Anyone know how bright it would be if we were there looking at it? I'd imagine that it would be barely visible and this picture was just taken as a long exposure with a large aperture.  Edit: decided to calculate it myself:  Pluto's orbital radius is 39.48x larger than earth's. Since solar irradiance varies with the square of the distance then:  Earth's irradiance/39.482 = Pluto's irradiance  Consequently Pluto's irradiance is 0.000641of earth's. Or the day on Pluto is 0.06% as bright as a day on Earth.   Even on Pluto the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full moonlight on Earth, a distance of about 500 AU (~69 light-hours) is needed; there are only a handful of objects in the Solar System known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them 90377 Sedna and(87269) 2000 OO67."

Astronomy,3d8qc9,Silverlight42,4,Tue Jul 14 14:58:58 2015 UTC,"At this point we can only guess, but the ""heart"" looks relatively smooth and featureless as compared to the rest of the catered body, so the relative aging is that it's a more recently developed feature. Now it could be a basalt flood but I don't  believe Pluto is very geologically active. It could be an erosional feature like a sandy desert but I doubt there is atmosphere enough for significant aeolian features. My guess would be some sort of recent thaw/freeze event due to the fact that Pluto is an icy,  rocky body. It could lead to a smoother area from the distribution of the ice."

Astronomy,3de369,eclipse75,5,Wed Jul 15 15:32:54 2015 UTC,"It's because when you look at stars in the night sky, you are actually seeing its brightness, not its apparent area.   Even with a telescope, probably the only star we could see of just its area would be Betelgeuse, because it's so big and close.   The fact that you can see it is because stars shoot off a LOT of photons. Much more than a flashlight like you mentioned somewhere before. Imagine taking something as blinding as looking at the sun, then cutting off a basketball sized chunk. Even from really far away it's still visible. I think the flux of the sun is like 6,000,000 watts per square meter. So take like 60,000 100 watt light bulbs, condense them all to the size of a 1 meter box, and then put it 4,400 miles away. It's not as crazy to imagine seeing that in a night sky (I know it's not a basketball but still).  Also the human eyes seeing brightness logarithmic, not linear. I'm not entirely sure how that works, but it does make seeing light not as linear as you'd expect. I challenge you to look that up some more and tell me about it, I'm just a Junior in college :p"

Astronomy,3dgtbv,sflamel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:22:49 2015 UTC,"I hope it's something as  simple as that.   Having Identified Saturn immediately, I was easily able to view it on my 60mm telescope tonight. With the rings and the gap between them and the planet clearly visible. And Titan a dim spot off to the side.   So I knew what point I was looking at.   And the 114mm scope was pointed at the exact same object. I even wandered the sky for about thirty minutes trying to find it."
Astronomy,3dgtbv,bvillebill,3,Thu Jul 16 06:58:37 2015 UTC,"Almost certainly you weren't looking at Saturn.  Using a 4mm and a 3x Barlow is giving you a magnification of about 700x, which is WAY too much to be useful and would make it completely impossible to find anything.  Start out with a 20mm you have.  Even with that Saturn will obviously be Saturn.  Once you get it in sight then you can step up to slightly higher magnification.  Your maximum magnification with that scope will be 150x - 180x, any higher than that will not gain you anything and will just make it dimmer and harder to track.  Good luck."
Astronomy,3dgtbv,BeanerSA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:22:32 2015 UTC,Thank you. I seem to have sorted it out. Even at 20mm the 3x barlow was crap and I couldn't find anything at all.   Today I managed to use reference points of a tree to find what I was looking for and managed to land on Saturn.  [Without the Barlow lens]  It was gorgeous with the 8mm eyepiece and I could see a lot of detail. (But not the cassini division.)
Astronomy,3dgtbv,BeanerSA,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:18:26 2015 UTC,There might be a chance that the telescope isn't collimated correctly. The most often linked guide to check/perform is this one.
Astronomy,3dgtbv,BeanerSA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:43:22 2015 UTC,"I thought of that, but I don't have a laser collimator.   I've used it to focus on other larger stars and what should have been Saturn. They where all pin points of light with no collimation problems.   I also viewed Venus the other night and it was sharp and detailed. You could see that it was a crescent shape."
Astronomy,3dgtbv,BeanerSA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:11:31 2015 UTC,"You don't have to use a laser collimator, and if you research it, lots of people recommend against anything but the most expensive laser collimators. You can do it with simple home made stuff.  To check collimation initially, you want to de-focus on a star, and you want to see a nice even donut shaped ring of light. If it is fat on one side, then you should collimate.  Venus doesn't really have any sharpness or detail IMO. Plus it's the biggest object in the night sky after the Moon, so it isn't really a good test."

Astronomy,3dedam,lunarimpact,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, supernovae are such energetic events that they can act as particle colliders. This creates many unstable isotopes which later decay (fission). This is often referred to as a ""r-process"" (r for rapid since the nuclei are smashed together quickly).  It is this latent decay of unstable elements that explains the extended afterglow of many supernovae which should drop off in brightness faster, but are given extra life by the energy of decay."

Astronomy,3dddls,talon04,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:52:57 2015 UTC,"Third weekends are bring-your-own-telescope nights and also meetings of the local Astronomer organization.

I figure this will get me in contact with all the local astronomers so I can still meet up with people to help me with the hobby, even when they don't have a good local meeting place. I'd rather have contact with people who share my interests, even if our refuge is gone. I suspect that the local organization will turn towards hosting parties rather than relying on the observatory.   Losing the observatory isn't a good thing by any stretch; however, I found that even though I could see amazing things through the Lake Afton telescope, having one of my own is just as amazing. To a child especially, I imagine showing them a planet through a telescope that they can literally pick up and take with them is just as inspiring.  I'd encourage you do to the same thing - you never know how your children could be inspired by even one visit, even if they can't go back. There are other observatories, one in Topeka and one south of Overland Park, for which you could make sporadic visits.  if you happen to make it tomorrow night, I'll be the pasty white guy with the orange Celestron telescope.

With Lake Afton closing, probably the best science attraction (besides the cosmosphere) would be the Kloudbusters in Argonia. They're the largest rocketry club in a large area, and they're authorized to make flights up to 50,000 feet. They have weekend flights a lot, but their major meet up is over Labor Day.  I feel very regretful that I haven't looked into science centered hobbies before now, there's so little to do here that interests me (especially in the rose hill area) on weeknights/weekends and I planned to make trips to the observatory my reason to go outside on saturday nights.

The Cosmosphere is having their yearly fundraiser event on Aug 8th (edit, the 22nd). Jim Lovell and Fred Haise from Apollo 13 (45 anniversary) will be there for a dinner. Somewhat expensive though.

Astronomy,3dcl4c,Vinef,12,Wed Jul 15 05:27:14 2015 UTC,"I like barley, so we'll take that as the example.  You have a wide pot of water on the fire, but the heat isn't even across the entire pot because the fire is at the center. You take a handful of barley and toss it in the middle to cook.  Some of it spreads to the sides and cools, but the stuff at the center cooks a little faster, expanding more than the barley at the outer edges of your pot of water.  Time is relative to the observer only if you watch the barley expand, but if you watch the barley expand, space is relevant in this hypothetical pan of boiling water.  You can take a constant like the speed of light to measure the age of THE UNIVERSE, but it becomes meaningless if you can't observe beyond a certain distance. We think the Universe is a certain age based upon current observation, but what if it's initial expansion had been a little faster?  Those primordial galaxies or a cloud of dispersing hydrogen could be beyond our observation capabilities now. So the Universe could be 17 billion years old, or 20.  We just don't know enough as a species to even guess at some of this stuff yet. We may be an expanding pimple on the face of a much more vast Universe we know nothing about.  Half cooked barley mixed with strong tea leaves makes a good astringent to get rid of unwanted pimple Universes. Apply while still relatively hot."

Pluto is small and 3 billion miles out.  It's the size of the US 3 billion miles from Earth.  You wouldn't be able to produce a worthy picture.
Astronomy,3dbr4z,soybean311,5,Wed Jul 15 01:20:51 2015 UTC,"Size, and angular resolution.   Pluto is fucking tiny as compared to the things that hubble images.  It's like saying, how come when I'm outside I can see ants, but I can't see bacteria on the sidewalk?  Given our eyes (or the hubble) our angular resolution is limited, so we can see bigger things (ants, galaxies, nebulae), but not smaller ones (viruses, pluto)."
Astronomy,3dbr4z,yawg6669,9,Wed Jul 15 01:18:49 2015 UTC,"Few reasons:   Size - Pluto is quite small compared to the objects that Hubble aims, which are typically a few lightyears across.  Available light - Pluto is very far from our Sun and only gets a small fraction of the light of which a small portion has to fall on Hubble's sensor and combined with the next point Albeido - Pluto has very low ""reflectivity""; which means, the small amount of light that does reach the planet doesn't get reflected well back out into Space.    But of all the above reasons, #1 has the highest influence."

Astronomy,3d7zvw,comrad,2,Tue Jul 14 09:58:18 2015 UTC,I would assume you'd use an algorithm that identifies stars in an image and also matches in planet location data. Google Sky Map would probably give you enough detail.

Astronomy,3d7zvw,120decibel,2,Tue Jul 14 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"Sound is a great analogy as it illustrates the same concept in distance scales that are more practical.   Starting from a distance of only a couple hundred feet, you can hear a delay between what you see and when you hear it. Playing baseball growing up I would be in the outfield and see the ball leave the bat a split second before I heard the crack of the bat.  The same thing is happening in space with light instead of sound, and the sheer size of the universe and the distances involved mean just about everything we look at is in the past (from our reference point)."
Astronomy,3d7zvw,120decibel,5,Wed Jul 15 01:38:16 2015 UTC,Actually you didn't.. ;) You took a picture of Pluto about 13 hours before New Horizon will pass it.

As I mentioned I want to refrain as much as possible on revealing where and what exactly it pertains to. I fear it will alter peoples perspective and cloud what the see or interpret.   However, this I can tell you: There was a series of steps every day for seven days that when completed would reveal on segment of the overall image. Each day the website had a geomantic figure that had to be manipulated to be the geomantic that represents that day of the week. This would then take you to a website that had a indistinguishable image. Some very smart individuals were able to decipher the images(usually involving fourier transform filters?). Once the image was deciphered it revealed one segment of the overall diagram in question. After the 7 days the segments were pieced together to make one big image with said diagram.

And once every Earth year, we can download data from the station, and once every Pluto year data would be sent back.  This is preposterous of course.

If we were to stretch a cable from Earth to Pluto, the inside of the cable would be subjected to a much stronger gravitational force than the other end. As a result, there would be an immense amount of tension on the cable. This tension would easily snap copper, or indeed any other hypothetical material under our current understanding of the laws of physics.  I suppose you could make it work if every so often there was a rocket holding up that length of copper. But now you're stuck trying to figure out how to run a rocket pretty much indefinitely without nearly enough fuel. If we were able to solve that problem, it would be a lot easier to just build a much, much, much more powerful transmitter on the probe and transmit at a higher speed."

So I guess it's somewhat comforting to know that, in the event that we really really needed to lay a copper line all the way to Pluto, we could theoretically do it in a reasonable amount of time.

The craft had a communication rate of 38 kbit/s at Jupiter; at Pluto's distance, a rate of approximately 1 kbit/s is expected.   I read here, that New Horizons has a 25 megapixel camera. A 25 megapixel image on a lossless compressed format would be 12 megabytes. 12 Megabytes would take 27.3 hours to upload to Earth."

On July 14, it will arrive! After a journey of nearly a decade, its Close Encounter phase will last just 48 hours. During the busiest hours of the flyby - including the moment of closest approach - the spacecraft will be too busy to communicate with Earth as it soaks up all the data it can during its mad dash through the Pluto system. Once it resumes transmitting, it will still take an additional four hours for its signals, traveling at the speed of light, to reach Earth! But a lot could go wrong. At the speed it's moving, it wouldn't take much of a high-speed impact with any undiscovered moon, possible ring, or other unseen debris to disable or destroy the spacecraft just as it's making its closest approach to the planet. Will New Horizons survive long enough to ""Phone Home"" and send us its treasure trove of images and measurements? We'll know the minute that NASA does! We'll be presenting a Live NASA TV broadcast from the Mission Operations Center, including interviews, videos, and status updates, right up until the receipt of the spacecraft's ""I survived"" chirp (expected at 9:09 pm)! Afterwards, if it's clear, we'll have telescopes on the roof aimed at Pluto's location in the sky (plus other targets of opportunity). Pluto is too faint to be visible even in our telescopes, but it's possible a few photons reflected by the planet may hit our retinas! It should all be great fun, as we'll have a raffle, photo ops in front of an artistic Pluto landscape, 3-D-printed models of New Horizons, and who knows what else! This will probably be the last time in our lives that we will be seeing a ""New World"" up close for the very first time. Don't miss your chance!

Especially the narrow-band filters are usually a waste of money, invest it in fuel to get a few miles out of town.  I live in a city with 241000 citizens, and just a mile out of town (with a view away to the south) I can see the milky way -faint, but it's there. So sometimes you don't even have to go all that far. Avoiding direct lights can make a huge difference.   If driving is no option, I would either get a telescope good for observing the planets (but only Jupiter, Saturn and Mars show noteworthy surface details) and some brighter DSO, or get something portable you can fit into a back-pack (AWB Onesky / Heritage 130p, 127mm Maksutov, good Binoculars...)."

Astronomy,3d7lc4,cecilkorik,2,Tue Jul 14 03:33:36 2015 UTC,"I can understand some anxiety. It's a relatively frightening possibility, although it is a very remote possibility with a very low numerical risk, it's certainly still a possibility and it's right that this should give us some pause and concern. This is why we need more investment in asteroid detection and countermeasures, to improve the amount of time we have to react if an asteroid on a collision course were ever to be detected, and to develop and prepare numerous response plans that can to be done to avert a crisis if one is detected.  Keep in mind that the odds are still very much in our favor. The Moon does a good job sweeping our orbital area clear of any asteroids and either crashing into or flinging any strays well out of harm's way. Meanwhile, the Earth's atmosphere easily protects us from all but the largest of space rocks, and the larger they are, the easier they are to detect when still very far away. An asteroid would need to be very large indeed to cause anything more than localized damage, and since 2/3rds of the Earth's surface is water, and even most of the land is very sparsely populated if at all, any impact will likely cause no significant effects at all to humans. The chances of an impact event on any major city is so small it's unbelievable, it would be like winning the lottery of bad things. Much more likely that a large city gets hit with a serious natural disaster like an earthquake or strong tornado, and even that is fortunately very very rare."

Astronomy,3d16gl,SiS-Shadowman,21,Sun Jul 12 22:22:35 2015 UTC,"The velocity pattern comes from the Sun's gravity pulling back on the probe as it's shooting away from it. The reason why they get out of the solar system is basically that sun can't slow it down fast enough to bring it to a full stop before the pull of gravity towards the sun fades into insignificant amounts. The force at which the sun is pulling back on the probe is getting smaller faster than the velocity of the probe. If it wasn't going fast enough, it's velocity away from the sun would eventually reach zero and it would then get pulled back towards the sun.  The reason why it speeds up during flybys is because basically the planet spends more time pulling the probe into the direction it's traveling in than it spends pulling it in the opposite direction which is achieved by making the probe go ""behind"" the planet in relation to the direction it's orbiting. Cool thing is that you can slow the probe down by flying past the planet on the opposite side."

Also, since we are still only describing distances within the solar system, we can afford to use smaller units to be more descriptive and precise. The kilometer only starts to lose meaning once we go beyond the trillions into the quadrillions and quintillions because these numbers are beyond what we can comprehend.

What they failed to realize is how much less sunlight there is at Pluto's distance.  It's like taking a picture of a clod of dirt in a dark, all-black room, with only the illumination from the sunlight shining through a keyhole.         Even with the highest tech cameras possible, it's still hard to get a great photo."
Astronomy,3cz132,giantsparklerobot,8,Sun Jul 12 19:50:18 2015 UTC,"It's not so much an issue of Pluto's illumination but people not having a grasp of how Voyager and Cassini images were generated or the conditions under which they were taken. Voyager's narrow angle cameras were sensors called vidicons, they were a CRT that could detect rather than display images. The vidicon tubes in the cameras could sample roughly 800x800 pixels at 8 bits per sample. To generate color images the cameras had a filter wheel that put a color filter over the camera during the exposure. Each color channel was stacked (like channel layers in Photoshop) to make true color images. Finally these 800x800 pixel images were stitched together in a mosaic to get an image of the whole target. So the super high resolution Voyager images are stitched together mosaics rather than single images.   In addition the Voyager and Cassini images were taken at altitudes of tens or hundreds of thousands of kilometers. The New Horizons images thus far have been gathered from millions of kilometers away. At millions of kilometers distant Pluto's apparent size has only been a few dozen or hundred pixels on the image sensor. During the close approach of the next few days Pluto will be close enough to be captured by the entire sensor so we'll have full frame high resolution images.  If you were at the opposite end of a football field from me and I took a picture of you with my iPhone you'd fill only a tiny portion of the frame. I could probably tell what color shirt you were wearing but not make out a logo or writing. As I move closer to you taking pictures each step your apparent size increases and I get more detail. By the time I am arm's length from you I can see the Nike logo on your shoes and the Star Wars print on your t-shirt in my pictures. The light available for the photos plays a role but it just means images need longer exposures to capture enough light."

Astronomy,3cz132,ChaseGr,3,Sun Jul 12 03:48:47 2015 UTC,This might seem really stupid but how couldn't we have good quality pictures of Pluto when we can have great-perfect quality pictures of distant galaxies?
Astronomy,3cz132,ChaseGr,7,Sun Jul 12 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"The answer to this is that even though galaxies are much farther away than Pluto, they are unimaginably larger and much brighter.  Take for example Andromeda, the nearest galaxy to our Milky Way. It is 2,538,000 light years away from us. (that's about 4 BILLION times farther away than Pluto is) If your eyes were sensitive enough to see more of the light leaving Andromeda, it might look something like this in the night sky. Notice how much larger it is than the disk of the moon. To get a better understanding, now try imagining Pluto was orbiting earth at the same distance as the moon. Pluto would appear smaller than our moon in the sky since its diameter is smaller than our moon. However, Pluto isn't in the moons orbit at 238,900 miles (384,400 km) away, it's 4.67 billion miles (7.5 billion kilometers) away, or 39.5 AU. That's nearly 20,000 times farther away than the moon is, which makes it incredibly tiny from our perspective. More on this here  Furthermore, Pluto is remarkably dim which makes taking pictures of it very hard. Unlike a galaxy which produces its own light from billions of individual stars, nearly all the light illuminating Pluto comes from our one star. (which Pluto is very far away from) All this adds up to the reason we need to send a spacecraft to Pluto to get really good images.  Edit:correction"

Christianity as a term encompasses all sects including Born Again to Lutherans to Methodists.    The thing that separates these sects are general approach to the same basic literature/teachings.  How literal the bible is taken happens to be one of these major differences.  The popular example would be the Creationist Christians.  They see everything that happened in the as extremely literal which is why they believe the universe is only 10,000 years only (or something).  Contrary to popular belief, most Catholics are quite forward thinking.  They don't take the bible literally (they haven't for quite some time, actually).  The stories are seen as something that contains moral truth that should be learned and adopted into one's lifestyle.  The Catholic concept of god's impact is more of a spiritual nature rather than a physical.  They do believe in miracles.  But, you gotta admit, there are some things that even our known science can't explain.  Like people having cancer and then the cancer just suddenly going away.

And I'm considering the harvesting of every planet and moon in a solar system for building material, you would still come up far short of your goal.  Even a Type III civilization would be leaking energy from every star they harness unless they were able to shred a large amount of stars as material, then transport that to the desired location to encompass other stars.

You should consider what goal you have. $300 will buy you a 6"" with very basic accessories, tops.  I've bought five 5"" reflectors for ~$50 each and built simple rockerbox mounts to turn them into more sturdy dobsonians. If you are patient, you can get 4.5"" reflectors (114/900) for under $50 used, occassionally for $59-$93 at Amazon - new, but on a weak mount.  With just $5 of materials and simple handsaw-cuts, you can turn them in pretty decent telescopes...  For half or third the price of a Orion XT4.5 that'll perform about the same.  Just the mirror costs ~$29 at Surplusshed, if they have it in stock.  Of course a 8"" telescope such as the Zhumell z8  (more & better accessories) or xt8 (currently in stock) would be the best bang for the buck. But that'll cost $369-399 plus at least one or two eyepieces ~$30 ea.  Of course there are also a few decent options for $100-$200 (table top dobsonian, c90, AWB Onesky, ""2nd"" xt 4.5) but they have some down-sides especially mostly regarding planets."

It's really hard to think about cause humans for the most part link the size of something and mass of it together cause we see that most of the time. When our star becomes a white dwarf it will have the mass of the sun but only be as big as the earth and neutron stars are only the size of Manhattan but also have mind bending mass. Scientists say a spoon full of neutron star material would weight 100 ton or more. The hole of a black hole that big could be as large as Jupiter or maybe our sun but have millions and billions times the mass of our sun. I guess you could say it would be like the mass of the whole galaxy but the hole the opens everything falls in would only be as big as Jupiter or the sun.

Problem with this is that merging would increase both stellar mass and black hole mass simultaneously. One would need to prove that merging somehow stimulates the growth of black holes more then growth of galaxies. Some people claim that this is the case, but this is still open question. Also it is entirely not clear what amount of mergers would such a galaxy experience up to this point.  Standard paradigm is the astronomy community is that the ratio between black hole mass and galaxy mass does not change with redshift. Objects like these test that picture. I personally have been working on these question and have been having that quite strong redshift evolution (i.e. more massive black holes at higher redshifts) is needed to explain various observations (such as this one, but also others).  EDIT: below there are some excellent questions! Keep them coming, I will do my best!"
Astronomy,3ctlim,jlink005,8,Fri Jul 10 20:01:30 2015 UTC,Could this galaxy have originally been 20 times larger and then another galaxy passed through and slung 19/20 of the stars into space?
Astronomy,3ctlim,OsianII,4,Fri Jul 10 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"It would be extremely unlikely. 20 times more massive galaxies basically do not exist, especially at those redshift. Mass of galaxy has been estimated at 5*1010 solar masses. 20 times larger would correspond to 1012, which is the mass of the absolutely most massive galaxies today and there are basically no such galaxies at redshift of 3. Also, such massive galaxies would dominate all gravity around it -> it would not get destroyed, it would be the ultimate boss to destroy everything else. What I am trying to say, it is very hard to actually strip down stellar mass from galaxy (it is basically unseen in local Universe), especially in such large amounts from a massive galaxy."
Astronomy,3ctlim,edjumication,5,Sat Jul 11 00:55:34 2015 UTC,Fascinating. Thanks for explaining what you do!  Could the extremely high ratio be simply caused by random chance? Could the trajectories of bodies in the galaxy just happen to intersect the black hole more often?  As amazed as I get I am not surprised when astronomers find monsters like these with how vast the universe is.
Astronomy,3ctlim,OsianII,6,Fri Jul 10 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"This is extremely important point and very good observation!   Even thought there is some mean relation between galaxy and black hole mass, we know that there is considerable scatter. So we do expect to see ""some"" galaxies where this ratio is very different and extreme. That is why it is extremely hard to make any conclusions if this galaxy is very special and if there is some special processes or just random realization (or in other words it is not possible to do statistical analysis on the sample of one object).   I know that my colleague is try to catching more of these objects as we speak. Some other arguments (size of the surveyed sky, mass of the galaxy, some local observations of very massive black holes, etc) suggest that we should see more of these at high redshift."
Astronomy,3ctlim,hatperigee,5,Sat Jul 11 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"Could it be that there was just a much greater concentration of matter here due to a (or series of) quantum fluctuation early in the Big Bang, such that when things expanded enough a disproportionate amount of mass ended up in the location that became this large black hole?"
Astronomy,3ctlim,OsianII,3,Fri Jul 10 22:46:58 2015 UTC,"That is a fair point. Initial mass of the black hole could have been large. I am not expert in this, but our friends who do theory claim that is basically not possible to create initial black hole above the mass of 105 or 106.  So this black hole still had to enlarge by huge amount (at least factor of 1000) since it was created.   Also, just to be clear, black hole mass is large, but it is not unheard of. What is special here is that the mass of the galaxy is quite low. How come that it also did not grow so much as it other galaxy friends?"
Astronomy,3ctlim,hatperigee,2,Sat Jul 11 01:04:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. What's the reasoning behind the claim that the initial size couldn't be this much?
Astronomy,3ctlim,OsianII,3,Sat Jul 11 01:32:38 2015 UTC,"Again I am not an expert, but basically my understanding it that is very hard to put such huge amount of mass into small volume that the in-falling gas does not fragment and create new stars. Or in other words it is very hard to devise scenario in which huge amount of mass get squeezed in very small volume without triggering processes which oppose this contraction."
Astronomy,3ctlim,hatperigee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:49:46 2015 UTC,"Ok I think I know what you mean.. the pull of gravity would be weaker towards the edges, stars would form, etc.  Another idea: what if this galaxy survived a merger, and came out the other side with a good number of the stars stripped away such that it's black hole ended up being 10% of the total mass of the galaxy (as observed)?"
Astronomy,3ctlim,OsianII,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:15:47 2015 UTC,So this is very similar to the question asked by /u/jlink005. I recommend looking at that answer as I feel it is exactly what you want!

Astronomy,3ctlim,OsianII,2,Sat Jul 11 04:31:39 2015 UTC,"If this is still directed to me; no, I do not believe in God."
Astronomy,3ctlim,Ravaen769,3,Sat Jul 11 06:47:05 2015 UTC,"Question. The energy emitted by the black holes as x ray's. How much does that correlate with how much the black hole ""eats"" or it and arbitrary number that is random. Basicly I'm curious that if over time the expulsion of x rays might in some way act in a way similar to the evaporation theory?"
Astronomy,3ctlim,OsianII,3,Sat Jul 11 00:17:29 2015 UTC,Luminosity of the black hole is proportional to how much it east. So this black is eating quite a lot of material and that is why we can see it.   I am not exactly sure what do you mean by second part of the question and the evaporation theory. This black hole is not evaporating and the luminosity which we see is created by the matter falling in and not by evaporation of the black hole. So this black hole is definitely still growing.
Astronomy,3ctlim,Ravaen769,2,Sat Jul 11 01:09:45 2015 UTC,Hmm I guess what I'm asking is if a black hole losses mass from ejecting x Rays
Astronomy,3ctlim,OsianII,3,Sat Jul 11 02:51:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understood. No, the black hole does not lose mass by  x-ray emission.   This x-rays that we see are created by the material which is in-falling to the black hole. This material, as it falls, gets heated up and creates luminosity that we see. Things like evaporation are totally negligible for black holes of this mass!"

Astronomy,3csv84,mcpaddy,11,Fri Jul 10 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"Imagine walking outside on a sunny day with a 100 mm (about 4"") wide magnifying glass, and focusing the sunlight onto a 1mm diameter circle.  The light at that point would be 10,000 times brighter than regular sunlight.  You can use that light to catch leaves on fire and roast ants.    Now imagine the sun itself shone 10,000 times brighter, and everything around you had light hitting it as intensely as under your magnifying glass (you put on really good fire entry suit just before it happens).  Watch everything in the world scorch like those leaves in a blinding flash of light. People's skin sizzles like those poor ants did and everyone is very sad.   Now take out your magnifying glass again and focus that intense light onto another 1mm point. The light in that point is now 100 million times brighter than normal sunlight.  You can use that light to melt glass, steel beams, and silica rock, pretty much anything you want. Any living material the light touches bursts into flame immediately.   Now imagine you make the whole sun shine as brightly as that light. Surface water boils instantly, all living things and their husks explode in a worldwide firestorm, and Earth's crust melts from the surface inward. There is no safety except for on your Nasa-developed ceramic lava raft wearing your fifty layers of insulation. Earth weeps joyful tears of molten glass that the wickedness of man has been burned from her surface... until she notices your dumb wicked ass with your magnifying glass, which you're again taking out of your pocket.   This time, focus the light onto a 1.6 mm diameter circle, not quite as intensely focused as the other times. That little circle is 400 billion times more intense than our regular sunlight, and you can use it to vaporize the lava around your raft.   Just before Mother Earth can kill you with a lava wave, you make the whole sun shine as brightly as under your magnifying glass. It was you or her, and you chose both."
Astronomy,3csv84,cuddlesnuggler,0,Fri Jul 10 22:02:54 2015 UTC,"edit: math fail  I get the sense that this is understating things a bit, though I'm not sure how much.  This 0.75 m2 magnifying glass is 100 times larger than the magnifying glass I used when I was younger to burn things (paper, leaves, plastic toys...).  I'm having a hard time estimating what you can do with ~800W in a 0.75mm2 circle, but I'm fairly certain you can start to do some real damage even in stage 1.  ... A few searches on youtube later, it seems that you can indeed get pretty close to melting metal with just the stage 1 magnifying glass: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDEfDB99yWg  (video showing the size of the lens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIwr6o-T6QY)  Note that while that lens is probably bigger than 0.75 m2, it's also not focused on a 0.75mm2 area.

The first stage in my scenario is a hand-size magnifying glass with our current sun, with a 1 mm diameter focal area.   The second stage's intensity is the equivalent of a 10 meter diameter magnifying glass with a 1mm diameter focal area.  The third stage's intensity is the equivalent of a 560 meter diameter magnifying glass with a 1mm diameter focal area."

However, astronomy is often different from what people actually expect. You don't really know until you experience it.  In that sense, it would be good idea to visit any astronomy/stargazing club close to you, and go to a stargazing night if they organize any, or go with a specific member if anyone invites you.  If you already did that or at least stargazed for a(some) night(s), then I'd  suggest going for something a bit cheaper and user friendly, and not spend your whole budget on your first scope. Dobsons can be pretty powerful and impressive for very cheap.   You probably don't need the best optics and mirrors ASAP and since you haven't mentionned astrophotography I figure you don't wanna start that yet, so something cheap but big can provide plenty of fun.  An intelligent scope is also very nice to help you find things, and show things to friends or whoever wants to see, without needing much knowledge. You wont learn your sky as much if you rely on it too much though.  You might also wanna be a bit more specific about things like transportation, where you live, what you plan to do with your scope etc.   Someone who lives where the sky is usually very dark and has a nice terrain probably does not need to care for transportation much, but someone who lives in an urban area should mind that."

The two-body problem can be re-formulated as two one-body problems, a trivial one and one that involves solving for the motion of one particle in an external potential. Since many one-body problems can be solved exactly, the corresponding two-body problem can also be solved.

In the animation, the center of mass is not changing. This is correct, then? If their center of mass always remains at exactly the same position, then I can  solve this no problem. I guess I was under the assumption that the center of mass of the system would constantly be changing.  EDIT: I understand now, the center of mass (or the combined system of the two bodies) cannot accelerate unless an external force acts on it. Now, if I were to add a step of complexity, I would have the Pluto-Charon system orbiting the Sun as well, causing the center of mass to change, but I can deal with that since I will be able to describe the motion of the center of mass based on the Sun's gravity. Thanks for pointing me to that page."

Most of the stars you can see without a telescope are bright massive stars, and those stars are much more likely to be part of a multiple star system.

Astronomy,3cqtk8,colbycheese123,2,Fri Jul 10 01:06:29 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the hobby! An aperture of 8"" will show you a lot. I assume you have a Dobsonian telescope with you. What eyepieces do you have?  As planets get close to the horizon, they get quite blurry. I've never seen them become red. Binary stars, open and globular star clusters, galaxies and planetary nebulae are pretty good visual targets for this scope. Diffuse nebulae, dark nebulae are best with light-pollution filters or astrophotography.  Ring nebula, dumbbell nebula and M81 should be quite easy to spot. You just need to visualize where in the sky the object should be and then point your scope in that area. To narrow down to the correct location, you can either star hop or just pan and scan. Star hopping works quite nicely if you have a magnifying finder. If you have a reflex sight, unfortunately you must resort to pan and scan.  Do you use star charts (electronic or paper)? What finder scope do you have?"
Astronomy,3cqtk8,dupemada,2,Fri Jul 10 01:56:17 2015 UTC,I have a 10mm and either 20 or 25mm (can't remember now). The finder scope is right angle prism with some magnification. In terms of charts I use the program stellarium on my computer and an app on my phone that shows you where stuff is when you point it. Also what is a light pollution filter do and are they worth getting?
Astronomy,3cqtk8,TravelBug87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:37:44 2015 UTC,"I would try to avoid using the app on your phone, at least while you are using the scope. Even when set to red and black night time mode, it can disrupt your night vision, making nebulae and galaxies much harder to spot.   I think star hopping is really great and I'd you do have the magnifying scope, it's really a good skill to get into. I recommend getting the pocket star guide... Not sure who publishes it since I'm on mobile but I find the book very handy while using the scope."
Astronomy,3cqtk8,schorhr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:02:34 2015 UTC,"This! :-)  A lot of great advice here already!  Check out these ""beginner objects"" for the summer. They are visible in small telescopes, so they should at least be somewhat visible in a 8"" if you are observing under moderate light pollution:   Double stars:   Albireo. Red & blue contrast, different temperatures Eps Lyra.  Open star clusters   CR399 (The coat hanger), h&chi Persei (NGC869, NGC884) - like fireworks in the sky!  Star clusters   M15, M11, M13, M3, M92  Nebulae   M24, nice part of our Milky way with a lot to explore M57 (the ring nebula) and M27 (dumbbell) - Small objects, not ideal for the small telescope, but worth a try. NGC 7000 (dark sky, adapted night vision) Orion Nebula Messier 42 (later this year - magnificent!!!)    The coat hanger is a nice object and relatively easy to find with the lower power eyepiece. All the collinder list star clusters make nice targets, see https://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/collinder-catalog-pdf/ and http://astroheber.bplaced.net/collinder.php  ""Turn left at Orion"" is available as PDF for download, you can take a look at it. But the paper version has some advantages when hunting for dim deep-sky objects (together with a dim red light it'll preserve night vision much better then a cellphone display in night/red mode). The only way is a deep red transparency sheet (stage lighting, anaglpyh transparencies). Also check out the objects in Stellarium to get a sense of scale & direction (images do not represent the visual view). You can set up finder, telescope & eyepieces to see how large (or small) the apparent field of view is.  Looks like the telescope just includes the 25mm and 10mm kit eyepieces, lacking a bit more magnification and a larger field of view for easier orientation.... but still, a lot should be visible.   Light pollution filter can help, but the only way to really eliminate light pollution is to get as far away from it as possible. I have one, I rarely use it. Narrow banded filters such as OIII and UHC on the other hand can help a great deal for certain types of nebulae, but the good ones cost quite a bit and for now I'd suggest observe with what you have :-)  Clear skies, good luck!"
Astronomy,3cqtk8,bvillebill,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:06:36 2015 UTC,"There is a general rule o thumb that it's best to observe when your target is more than 30 degrees above the horizon.  Not an absolute, but the amount of atmosphere you're looking through increases rapidly at low angles and makes observing worse.  It can be hard to find DSO's because they are usually much smaller and fainter than you expect them to be.  I've gone back and forth over an area for minutes before finally realizing I was looking at my target, it just didn't look like what I was expecting.  It's best to look at sketches rather than photos to give you a more accurate idea of what to look for.  Dark sites don't matter for the planets or the moon, but are critical for trying to see galaxies, nebulae, etc.  Get to the darkest spot you can, especially since an 8"" scope is honestly on the small side for trying to see DSO's.  You might start with some globular clusters, they're easy to find and very attractive to view, check out M13 for an easy one."
Astronomy,3cqtk8,VoijaRisa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:29:49 2015 UTC,"If you're using an 8"" scope, the Ring Nebula should easily be visible. I've found it with little effort even in the city. This one is a super easy one for star hopping to. Start by finding Vega. Hopefully, you're at a dark enough location that you can see the trapezoid that hangs off it. Go to the short end of the trapezoid furthest from Vega. With most finderscopes, you should be able to get both of those stars in the finder and center up right between them. If your finder is properly aligned, you'll be right on it.  M81 is going to be the next easiest of these to find due to it being located nearer to brighter stars. The Dumbell Nebula is pretty isolated so you'll need to be at a fairly dark location to make it easy.  If you haven't seen these objects in a telescope before, you might want to have someone find them for you. It's entirely possible you've looked right at them and just didn't realize it. The Ring Nebula is quite often just a fuzzy spot that, unless you know what you're looking for, can just look like an afterimage of having looked at something bright. Similarly, you might mistake things for internal reflections in the scope.  To try to get your eyes adjusted to fainter objects, it's best not to look directly at them. You actually have a blind spot there. Instead, look just off to the side and they'll jump out. Additionally, slightly moving the telescope back and forth will help because a real deep sky object will move with the rest of the stars, whereas internal reflections or afterimages won't. It helps them standout."
Astronomy,3cqtk8,tommytimbertoes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:39:12 2015 UTC,"The higher in the sky, the less blurry an object will be. Notice that stars twinkle faster near the horizon.   Also, make sure to let the scope reach outside air temperature before viewing or you'll get more distortion in your eyepiece. Dark adapt your eyes too. Once you find an object, STARE AT IT for many minutes. Don't just peak and move on. REALLY LOOK AT IT."

Astronomy,3cqll0,schorhr,2,Fri Jul 10 10:29:24 2015 UTC,"Hi :-)  Do you have binoculars, or do you observe with the naked eye?  I basically pick a few  targets (for the telescope) but spend a lot of time just looking around (low magnification binoculars or telescope).  I also try to see current high-lights such as ISS passing, meteor showers, random satellites. Sadly here there's too much light pollution to see Andromeda or even M33 with the naked eye.  Even in red/night mode, the display can ruin your night vision. If you are trying to observe faint targets, every bit helps :-)  A deep red transparency sheet (astronomy supplies, stage lighting supplies, anaglyphic red transparency) can do the trick... or old-school, paper maps and dim red light. Never fails.  Clear skies!"

Astronomy,3cqll0,ellengris,2,Fri Jul 10 10:32:21 2015 UTC,"How dark is your location? (Can you see the milky way? Also this or that)  Binoculars will make things visible you can't see with the naked eyes, even under some amount of light pollution. Galaxies like Andromeda, M81/M82 or M33, Nebulae such as NGC7000 or the Orion nebula.  Depends on light pollution though (Example).  ISS: Yes, it's often visible in the morning or evening, see   http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/ https://www.heavens-above.com/PassSummary.aspx?satid=25544 Stellarium (enable Satellites)    Personally I favor low magnification binoculars <10x, as above 10x it gets difficult to hold steady and observe for a long time.  Even some cheaper binoculars can enhance the night time views, but of course the cheap optics usually have flaws.  As much as I like binoculars, I love the AWB OneSky / Heritage 130p. It's lower focal length is not ideal for planets (but still decent), but makes a nice wide-field instrument even with 1.25"" eyepieces. I often put it in a back-pack and observe from a location behind the city borders, a lot of fun (and shows quite a bit more then binoculars).  The 5"" telescope is just enough to see a bit of structure in many deep-sky objects under dark skies... I did not expect to see more of Galaxy M51, 81&82  then in my smaller telescope, but it was pretty great. The Cassini-division of Saturn's rings and the great (not so) red spot on Jupiter where also visible on a night with good seeing.  (10x50 binoculars show ~6.5-7° field, The AWB/Heritage can show ~2.6°, so a bit more then your average dobsonian with a more expensive 2"" eyepiece)  Also check out ""turn left at Orion"" if you haven't already, it's a great beginner's guide for small telescopes, binoculars and visual, showing you the objects worth observing in mall objects, with drawings on what to expect, and where to find them.  Stellarium is great, but it's sometimes hard to tell which objects are worth observing :-)  Turn left at Orion is currently available as PDF download, but the paper version + dim red light preserves night vision much better."

Astronomy,3cklg2,ak_toxik,3,Thu Jul 9 14:17:38 2015 UTC,"Sensors only sense the intensity of suitable light and not each individual photon's wavelength.   By suitable light, I mean light energetic enough to free electrons in the sensing material. For something like silicon, this is below visible and in the near infrared. Silicon can also detect above visible into the ultraviolet. You can see this in action when you point a remote control at your phone camera. You will see the IR light flashing. Its colour is just an effect of the way colour is interpreted by the sensor.  Most consumer cameras use a mosaic-looking filter called a Bayer filter. Colour is interpolated from the relative intensities of the filtered pixels. So it doesn't capture true colour data. Some cameras have a  dichroic prism setup and 3 sensors, but those are expensive for obvious reasons  Another way to get RGb is to take exposures with different colour filters in place and combine afterwards on the ground. You don't always need a full colour image for science; in fact, it'd probably be detrimental to have only RGB available!  And humans have terrible colour detail resolution. Most of our visual information is taken from luminance (""black and white""), and that feature is the basis of a lot of image/video compression!"

Astronomy,3cmx4m,ThickTarget,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:29:09 2015 UTC,"Hubble is actually plagued by the earth's magnetosphere. It's in a modestly high LEO orbit and so intersects the Van-Allen Belts. In particular the South Atlantic Anomaly is prone to ruining any data taken in it. As such it has suffered damage, raw Hubble pictures are not what they were because of charge transfer inefficiency. See small example. The streaking is artificial, created by the damage. It can be computationally corrected to an extent but it is still an issue and affects the sensitivity.  JWST won't have the problem because charge transfer doesn't work well at low temperatures, so infrared detectors don't use it.  TL;DR: JWST is immune to the most common damage from cosmic rays."

Astronomy,3cj2zu,TomaTozzz,2,Wed Jul 8 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"Nope. The size of a star depends on its mass, metallicity and its age, or to be more accurate, on the reaction rate in its core (which increases over time). Highly evolved stars are bigger than younger stars of the same mass, if they hit the giant phase, they are also bigger than more massive stars.   However, main sequence stars grow in size with mass. From the article i knew that each stars was smaller than the sun, as the size of the sun was to scale. Since none of them was the size of our sun, the only conclusion was, that they are less massive as well.   After reading a paper to the system (link), I found out that this was indeed the case as expected, all of the stars happen to be K type main sequence stars, which are smaller than the sun and won't go supernova, even in case the contact binary would merge. The combined mass of both stars is approximately the same as the mass of our sun."

Astronomy,3cm0tn,alluran,2,Thu Jul 9 01:59:05 2015 UTC,"Not going to say it isn't amazing, but I think you're underestimating the data available.  Yes, Pluto was sub-pixel, but they had lots of sub-pixels to work from.  For a rough idea - Imagine a cube spinning through space. Your sub-pixel image comes back with a blue tint. You can assume that the side you're looking at is blue. As it rotates, the pixel changes to have a red tint. So you extrapolate that the next side is red. Then, it rotates some more and you get a green tint. Now you know a rough idea of the color of 3 sides of the cube.  Repeat this for a long time, at a lot of different angles and rotations, coupled with a solid understanding of the movement/rotation of the sub-pixel subject you're trying to photograph (and an assumption that it's going to be a particular shape), and you're able to give a best-guess image.  Things like machine learning are extremely useful here, because you're trying to balance a model of what a planet looks like, based on a set of average colors.  You can do similar stuff to determine the shape of the planet too - especially once you know the light you're expecting to get back from the sub-pixel segment, by re-positioning your pixel in a basic form of edge-detection.  Of course, things like clouds, or large geographic features that change color rapidly, would easily throw these techniques off (though not prevent them entirely) - so we got lucky with Pluto on that one."

(You can click to see the sample (top left) and where the camera was pointing (top right))  Once they had that kind of data, they could fairly easily map multiple passes from different angles, onto a sphere - do some more magic to account for the different angles of the shots, and get the really rough images you saw.  I'd map just this single pass onto a sphere - but that's way more JS than I feel like writing right now :P"

Astronomy,3ces64,T-RexInAnF-14,4,Tue Jul 7 18:37:17 2015 UTC,"Section 23. Pluto flyby of article  New Horizons:       On May 15, 2015, New Horizons‍ '​ imaging resolution of Pluto exceeded Hubble's,  which will last until two months after the flyby. From the May date forward on approach the probe should be able to detect any rings or any additional moons (eventually down to 2 km diameter), for avoidance and targeting maneuvers, and observation scheduling. New Horizons‍ '​ best spatial resolution of the small satellites is 460m/pixel at Nix, 1.1 km/pixel at Hydra, 3.2 km/pixel at Kerberos, and 3.2 km/pixel at Styx. Estimates for the diameters of these bodies (assuming albedo 0.35) are: Hydra, 61 to 167 km (38 to 104 mi.); Nix, 46 to 137 km (29 to 85 mi.); Kerberos, 13 to 34 km (8 to 21 mi.); and Styx, 10 to 25 km (6 to 16 mi.). This translates to a minimum of 55, 100, 4, and 3 pixels in width for Hydra, Nix, Kerberos, and Styx, respectively.  New Horizons is intended to pass within 12,500 km (7,800 mi) of Pluto, with this closest approach date estimated to occur on July 14, 2015 at 11:50 UTC. New Horizons will have a relative velocity of 13.78 km/s (49,600 km/h; 30,800 mph) at its closest approach, and will come as close as 28,800 km (17,900 mi) to Charon, although these parameters may be changed during flight. Starting 3.2 days before the closest approach, long-range imaging will include the mapping of Pluto and Charon to 40 km (25 mi) resolution. This is half the rotation period of the Pluto–Charon system and will allow imaging of all sides of both bodies. Coverage will repeat twice per day, to search for changes due to snows or cryovolcanism. Still, due to Pluto's tilt, a portion of the northern hemisphere will be in shadow at all times. During the flyby, LORRI should be able to obtain select images with resolution as high as 50 m/px (if closest distance is around 12,500 km), and MVIC should obtain four-color global dayside maps at 1.6 km resolution. LORRI and MVIC will attempt to overlap their respective coverage areas to form stereo pairs. LEISA will obtain hyperspectral near-infrared maps at 7 km/px globally and 0.6 km/pixel for selected areas.  Meanwhile, Alice will characterize the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules (airglow), and by dimming of background stars as they pass behind Pluto (occultation). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI will sample the high atmosphere and its effects on the solar wind. VBSDC will search for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX will perform active and passive radio science. Ground stations on Earth will transmit a powerful radio signal as New Horizons passes behind Pluto's disk, then emerges on the other side. The communications dish will measure the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal. The results will resolve Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth (""downlink""). Low power and extreme distance means New Horizons will be the first such ""uplink"" mission. Pluto's mass and mass distribution will be evaluated by their tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal will experience a Doppler shift. The Doppler shift will be measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics.  Reflected sunlight from Charon will allow some imaging observations of the nightside. Backlighting by the Sun will highlight any rings or atmospheric hazes. REX will perform radiometry of the nightside.   Characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and Charon Map chemical compositions of Pluto and Charon surfaces Characterize the neutral (non-ionized) atmosphere of Pluto and its escape rate   Loss of any of these objectives will constitute a partial failure of the mission.   Characterize the time variability of Pluto's surface and atmosphere Image select Pluto and Charon areas in stereo Map the terminators (day/night border) of Pluto and Charon with high resolution Map the chemical compositions of select Pluto and Charon areas with high resolution Characterize Pluto's ionosphere (upper layer of the atmosphere) and its interaction with the solar wind Search for neutral species such as H2, hydrocarbons, HCN and other nitriles in the atmosphere Search for any Charon atmosphere Determine bolometric Bond albedos for Pluto and Charon Map surface temperatures of Pluto and Charon Map any additional surfaces of outermost moons: Nix, Hydra, Kerberos & Styx.   It is expected, but not demanded, that most of these objectives will be met.   Characterize the energetic particle environment at Pluto and Charon Refine bulk parameters (radii, masses) and orbits of Pluto and Charon Search for additional moons and any rings   These objectives may be attempted, though they may be skipped in favor of the above objectives. An objective to measure any magnetic field of Pluto was dropped. A magnetometer instrument could not be implemented within a reasonable mass budget and schedule, and SWAP and PEPSSI could do an indirect job detecting some magnetic field around Pluto.

I was wondering if we could get better long term science out of a scalable space array made up of five or six 3 meter mirrors. Similar to the ALMA array in Chile... Just in space.  You could add to the array as funding allows.  This might also alleviate some of the risk of a launch failure.
Astronomy,3cfr0u,YossarianVonPianosa,2,Wed Jul 8 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"Optical/IR interferometers aren't there yet. Even in space they are extremely lossy, they are much, much less sensitive. Unlike in the sub-mm with ALMA light must be directly recombined rather than done electronically, that's difficult and looses most of the light. They just can't replace monolithic telescopes right now. The technology to do it at optical wavelengths in space has also never been demonstrated.  On a practical point an open budget is not a good idea, you either build them all at once or drive up the cost per unit by a huge amount. ALMA was built all at once, it just took time to assemble the whole array."

However, this has more recently been disputed as you would have expected to see much stronger radio and x-rays.  From a 2D perspective, the cloud looks like it's already hit the pillars. But in fact the cloud is positioned slightly towards us (i.e. between us and the pillars). It will, however, hit the pillars (as we see it) in about 1,000 years.  Because the pillars are around 7,000 lightyears away though, the cloud would have actually hit the pillars 6,000 yeas ago.  Either way, the pillars will be changed. If it's a supernova shockwave it'll wipe them out. If it's just a cloud of gas from something else then the pillars will sort of erode over a long time."

I find that shooting with anything with a little longer focal point and wide open is fine, for example my 10-22mm canon lens looks wicked sharp at it's wide-open 3.5, but my 8mm fisheye looks awful at wide open.

The unit attached denotes the distance the light travels in that time period.   Duder211 (hedidthemath) has it right- but besides the cultural convention of pointing out that its a measure of distance, not time; whenever we refer to a light year/day/month/second we simultaneously reference the speed of light, distance traveled, and time elapsed during travel.   To conclude, it takes radio signals traveling at the speed of light (1.079x1012 m/hr) roughly 4.5 hours to reach New Horizons which is, again roughly, 4.828x1012 meters away from Earth."

Astronomy,3cay7a,GenXer1977,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:38:06 2015 UTC,More or less. Shielding is important but lots of internal redundancy checks too because no reasonable amount of lead is going to stop some of the particles flying around up there. Elon's (engineers) idea was to simply put more (modern) processors in and have them cross reference each other. In a case of an a high energy particle hitting a transistor and causing an irregular result the other processors just correct it (like minority report but with several more oracles and a 99.99999...% surety).  I'm sure someone else here has a far better understanding of the design than I do.

Astronomy,3cb36p,burzmali,2,Mon Jul 6 21:54:56 2015 UTC,"Short answer is no. This work is actually not that exciting. The preprint is available here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05120 but if you'd asked any astronomer a year ago what they expected to see, they would have said this. This is important, because it is a validation of our current theories, but it is not in any way game changing or revolutionary.  As to the why of it: we already could see the gravitational effects of the mass (in the velocities of stars and gas around the galaxy centres). The point it that these observations confirm super massive black holes are the source of the mass, not super dense star clusters or something else weird. But then these are type 2 Seyferts - of course they're SMBHs!!   In fact, if you read the preprint, the paper doesn't claim anything as spectacular as the press release (surprise surprise!) - all they're claiming is that they have better characterised the column densities obscuring these specific black holes. This is a really important measurement for future statistical studies - but again it is not a change from what we already though - they've just done some very good work to put a number on a previously unknown quantity."

The two star clusters Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 are the youngest clusters in the association, but Trumpler 15, Collinder (Cr) 228, Cr 232, NGC 3324, and NGC 3293 are all considered members. Trumpler 14 is one of the youngest known star clusters, at half a million years old. Trumpler 16 is the home of WR 25, currently the most luminous star known in our Milky Way galaxy, together with the less luminous but more massive and famous Eta Carinae star system, and HD 93129A. NGC 3293 is the oldest furthest from Trumpler 14, indicating sequential and ongoing star formation. The nebula lies at an estimated distance between 6,500 and 10,000 light years from Earth. It appears in the constellation of Carina, and is located in the Carina–Sagittarius Arm. The nebula contains multiple O-type stars.  The nebula is one of the largest diffuse nebulae in our skies. Although it is some four times as large and even brighter than the famous Orion Nebula, the Carina Nebula is much less well known, due to its location in the southern sky.
