Ebay,3e6r2t,NEHOG,2,Wed Jul 22 12:13:54 2015 UTC,"A buyer does not need your PayPal address to pay you.  He's not asking for your email to complete the sale outside of eBay; he needs it to send a fake ""you've been paid"" email, hoping that you will ship the item without checking your PayPal account.   Never give a buyer your email/PayPal address. If a buyer has paid, you will see the payment in your PayPal account (it might be on hold if you are a new seller). When you look at the details, it will tell you if it's OK to ship the item. (Assuming he doesn't pay) After 2 days, open an Unpaid Item case. After another 4 days, close the case manually to reclaim the Final Value Fee you have been charged.  Don't relist the item until the Unpaid Item case is closed, or you could end up with two buyers for one item, which will probably result in negative feedback."

Ebay,3e6oqf,funchy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:24:57 2015 UTC,They need the name.  It goes on the package.  The seller must send the package to the correct name/address.  I caution against doing this.  Some sellers might feel you're a scammer.     I also don't know if it would invalidate your buyers protection?
Ebay,3e6oqf,ThrowAwayForeBay,2,Wed Jul 22 12:45:23 2015 UTC,"I sometimes get buyers who enter (say) ""24"" or ""A B"" in the name field. It looks strange, and makes me wonder if they're some kind of scammer, or just overly paranoid. Maybe they don't realise I can (usually) see their name on the  PayPal email I received.  What legitimate reason would you have for not including your name in the address?"

Ebay,3e5f1h,justrun7,2,Wed Jul 22 02:26:13 2015 UTC,Best bet would be call eBay in this situation.
Ebay,3e5f1h,Notsellingcrap,2,Wed Jul 22 03:09:53 2015 UTC,Calling eBay is your best shot but they are almost certainly going to side with the buyer. Your best bet is to ask the buyer to return the item in exchange for a refund.
Ebay,3e5f1h,gmurnane,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:42:31 2015 UTC,"Since the buyer is being a jerk, the best you can do is cover yourself with eBay with regards to the item not being a fake. You have 2 problems on your hands, a buyer who has opened a case and another issue with selling a counterfeit item (even when it is not).   At least get the counterfeit aspect covered as that will hurt you more than the simple defect / SNAD case.   Yes by all means, call eBay and talk to a US rep."
Ebay,3e5tpx,COL_Brightside,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:35:02 2015 UTC,Accept the package. If you refuse it ebay will side with the seller.  Open a case (if you have not and the seller still does not communicate). Having the case open ebay should give you a return label (sometimes they just let you have a refund and keep the item). Or you can pay for a new label yourself and upload tracking so ebay knows you returned it. Once it has been delivered they will take a few days for the seller to manually do it. If they don't ebay will give you the money back.
Ebay,3e54uq,loyloyismyboy,0,Wed Jul 22 01:02:15 2015 UTC,Probably. You may not offer positive feedback nor threaten negative in exchange for anything.
Ebay,3e54uq,RevDan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:37:06 2015 UTC,Mmkay. So I should just not say anything and leave the feedback unless he offers and try to get a partial refund through ebay? I'd be willing to remove the negative if he did give me it since he's a new seller and maybe just doesn't know how to deal with buyers yet but he has been pretty rude so eh.
Ebay,3e54uq,RevDan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:35:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can do it, you just can't tell him it'll be quid pro quo. IMO."

Recently i have been trying to send money to someone, everytime I try it says to verify my account by recieving a text and entering the code from the text. Every time I do this it makes me do it again. Paypal might have not allowed me access to the money becuase they think i am a scammer due to the fact that I have tried again many times. Another possible reason is that I don't have my paypal linked to a bank account."

Ebay,3e3p5z,Myndo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:34:48 2015 UTC,I think many sellers are unaware that individuals can use credit cards via Paypal even without registering for a Paypal account. The replies here reflect that.

Here is the catch #1... the seller is required to ship to the address provided by eBay - no exceptions.   Here is catch #2... the USPS will take their lowest priority time to return the item to the seller. It may be a month or more before they see the package again.   Here is catch #3.. you can't open any form of case such as item not received as eBay sides with the seller when an item is returned / refused / wrong address.   The best you can hope for is that the new residents actually shipped the item back vs. wrote ""return to sender"" on the package. The seller is still in a bind as they can't just send it back out to a different address without loosing seller protection."

The guy backed off. Not to say this will always work however.   Whatever you do. Do not issue a refund right away.   Call his local post office and tell them About it.

If they bought on Thursday, two business days would be Monday. No one is perfect, but it is perfectly fine to feel frustrated when a seller is late. Good customer service would be if the seller let the buyer know he was late. Without communication from the seller, the buyer has no way of knowing what (if anything) is going on."

From the instructions that immediately follow, it's clear that you have to enter the redemption code at checkout. If the balance were actually deposited into your account, you wouldn't need to enter a code.  I've redeemed dozens of eBay gift cards and this is always the way it works.

Ebay,3e105x,Notsellingcrap,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:39 2015 UTC,Geez. I gotta find another platform to sell on. Seems every third sale is some sort of scam. Thanks for the info.

Ebay,3e105x,east100th,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:34 2015 UTC,"I am in a very similar position.  Buyer claims the item (in my case, a pair of headphones) is damaged, but cannot actually describe the damage.  Only that they ""don't sound right"".  I have instructed him to return them for a refund, but I am sure when I test them they will be fine.  Am I within my rights to not refund the return shipping?"
Ebay,3e105x,shihchiun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:00 2015 UTC,"You can't prove that kind of claim, so if this turns into a case you will lose."
Ebay,3e105x,MashedPotatoh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:42:13 2015 UTC,"It is always possible that it broke during shipping. These things happen. Request pictures from your buyer and for a claim with your carrier. They will request to pick it up in a few days at which point you will refund the buyer. A week or so later, you'll receive the item back and a check to cover the damages. Usually I'm reimbursed the full same amount and given the item back to sell ""for parts"". Damage during delivery doesn't happen often, and sometimes how well you pack won't make a difference. Hopefully it is fully insured.   When issues happen, it is rarely a scam. Try to remember that when communicating with your buyer. I'm sure they are just as disappointed as you.   If you receive the damaged item back and it is definitely not what you sent out, let the carrier know and they can handle it the way they want."
Ebay,3e105x,funchy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:16 2015 UTC,"Treat it as if it may have broken during shipping.  Ask for pics from buyer.  Submit an insurance claim.

But considering the packaging was opened, it's possible that it left the seller in the condition he described it in -- and someone tampered with it along the way.    If this is the case see if seller can send you a replacement and or file a shopping insurance claim.  I would not damage his selling record with bad feedback or Item Not As Described unless he refuses to work with you on this."
Ebay,3e0y59,funchy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"Just curious, did the seller get your address wrong or did the post office misdeliver?"

Ebay,3e0y59,NEHOG,4,Tue Jul 21 11:16:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on who opened it! If it was the neighbor, then it is not the seller's fault. Was both the shipping carton opened, and the item, or was the shipping carton sealed and the item opened?   If the shipping carton was sealed then file an item not as described.   If both were opened, you're kinda going to have to fall back on your morals--your neighbor was at fault, though probably he/she didn't realize the error until it was already opened.

Before meeting him, I printed up 2 copies of the packing slip (with 'bill of sales' verbiage on it) for both of us to sign, one copy for him, one copy for me.  Also took a picture of him holding the item with packing slip in hand.  It worked out fine, but not sure if any of this would have been proof enough that he received the item had he decided to open an INR or chargeback."
Ebay,3dzltf,iwillcallyoudude,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:50 2015 UTC,There is no protection with local pick up. It's very risky. You can have the buyer send you an email via ebay saying he picked it up and it's great and have him leave you feedback before you let him leave with it but even this will not protect you from an item not received case if the buyer is a scammer.
Ebay,3dzltf,JohnFromTSB,2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:02 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Think i will stick to craigslist cash and carry in that case
Ebay,3dzltf,TheKid72,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:12 2015 UTC,"Just my 2¢ on local pickup, eBay and Craigslist. Depending on your area and the item, sometimes it is still better to list an item on eBay as local pickup only vs. the local Craigslist. Example - a friend of mine listed a very collectible Magnavox stereo that received no replies on CL. Finally placed it on eBay and it did sell. The buyer drove from 2 states away to pick up the item.   It's the ""unofficial norm"" to pay at pickup. For convenience to the buyer, we moved that vintage 2 piece stereo phono to my house (no stairs, easier access to the Interstate highway). The buyer was going to pick up a postal money order, however due to time - trusted me with cash, which I passed along to the seller.   I restore vintage audio, including top-end Magnavox consoles (which can pass the $1000 mark) and large speakers. People are willing to drive, and they are also taking a risk that you won't screw them over too."
Ebay,3e0s5q,popcornchick2,2,Tue Jul 21 02:01:54 2015 UTC,"If the buyer is no longer registered you can go to your sold folder and click ""Sell Similar"" to the right of the item, it will re-create the listing in a new draft which will allow you to list.  If you get an error stating ""This item would cause you to exceed your limit"", you may need to call eBay to have them increase your limit. Tell them you had a buyer who purchase an item that is no longer registered and they'll increase your limit to allow you to relist."
Ebay,3e0s5q,Jotatoe,2,Tue Jul 21 02:28:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm concerned because it still has an amount showing up in the money ""not received"" column and the item is still on my ""sold"" even though it didn't sell."
Ebay,3e0s5q,Jotatoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the user is no longer registered, so there is no way they can pay. Honestly the system can be a little stupid sometimes, even though the user isn't on the site anymore the system still hasn't gotten around to cancelling the transaction. You can re-list using the sell similar feature without worry, there is no way your buyer could submit payment at this point anyway."
Ebay,3e0s5q,Jotatoe,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Update: tried to relist for the first time since 10 days ago and pretty much the same thing happened with another account (the account was just made today with no rating, etc..). They offered full price so I declined. Then they offered again for more than what I was selling for....-_- are you kidding me? Its sad but I'm done with ebay."
Ebay,3e0rgw,CatanX,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:33 2015 UTC,"Shit. If the tracking shows as delivered, the seller isn't responsible. You can contact them and see if they could help, but eBay is just going to tell you to take it up with the post office."
Ebay,3e0rgw,Jotatoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:40 2015 UTC,"This is why I always pay with a credit card on eBay. If eBay sides with a seller, I can protect myself from being screwed.   I recommend contacting the post office before taking any further action."

Ebay,3e0rgw,secularlogic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:42:15 2015 UTC,Paypal is both a payment method and a payment processor. So when you have to pay with Paypal--you can use them as your method or chose to use a credit card.
Ebay,3e0rgw,secularlogic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"I would appreciate if you would read the original posts and my posts a little more carefully.   First, lets remember that the seller lied about the status of the item multiple times and tried to bully the buyer into closing the eBay case. This strongly suggests that they may not be acting in ""good faith"". Another possibility is that they are simply woefully incompetent. Either way, there is a strong possibility the buyer might experience problems. For example, the seller could misaddress (out of spite or stupidity) the package. This could easily result in tracking showing the item delivered and eBay siding with the seller. EBay only looks at the zip code and delivery status when deciding an INR case, so a misdelivery due to the seller's error could easily result in the buyer losing a claim which they are rightfully entitled to.   Secondly, I explicitly said to contact the post office first. Please don't berate me for something I didn't suggest. Perhaps you couldn't be ""bothered"" to read my post before attacking me.  Talk about jumping to conclusions."

Ebay,3dx6hn,jasonc113,2,Mon Jul 20 19:45:44 2015 UTC,A little difficult to follow since no way to know who is talking to who.  Did you ship a phone but it didn't get scanned as delivered?  Then the buyer admitted to having it?  Did you actually call the PO and did they really say they remembered delivering it?

I called the post office 4 times because the person that delivered it wasn't there. Well, yeah that could be right, but that's what I was told and I guess I called the buyer's bluff with relaying that.  Tracking shows that it was out for delivery, but it was never updated to delivered. Instead it showed, Delivery status not updated. Guessing the guy thought he could get his money back and a free phone because of that.  Buyer didn't say anything after I asked if he could ask others in his household if maybe they had taken it. After 3 days with no response, I ask for an update and he says, ""yes i have it thank you"""

In this case though, if the bag really does have dog hair on it, as a buyer, I would want to have it professionally cleaned too. It's not really rational, but it's pretty gross to get a bag with someone else's [dog hair, cracker crumbs, gum wrappers] included. Especially a bag you intend to put your kid's bottles and pacifiers in. I buy and sell bags and belong to a few handbag forums, and you'd be amazed by the condition some bags arrive in, and how deeply grossed out many buyers can be by things that may seem insignificant to the seller.

Send something like the following to the buyer:    Dear Buyer,  We apologize for the negative experience you have received in your buying experience with us.  Sadly, we cannot cover your expenses for cleaning the bag.  However, we will be more than happy to refund your purchase price.  Simply ship the item back to us and once we verify that it is the same item we shipped to you we will immediately process your refund.  Also, we would highly appreciate it if you could take a photo or two of the bag and the shipping package if you still have it.  If you could send those images to us as an email attachment we can investigate how this happened to the bag.  The packaging photo is especially important as the hair may be from a canine inspector during the shipping process if the package was opened for inspection while in transit.  Best Regards, etc. etc.    In the future OP, I suggest the following:   Take a video of you packaging the item for sale, make sure the video has closeups of the item and completed shipping package. On the same day you ship the package post the video to Youtube as an unlisted video.  That makes the video unsearchable.  It also provide you with dated, visual proof of the condition of the item and the shipping packaging when you shipped it."

Ebay,3e06ov,Pokabu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:40:57 2015 UTC,"In general, any gifts under $60 won't be charged duty.  You can ship this item through DHL, FedEx, Canada Post, etc....and if the declared value is less than $60 then you usually don't pay duties.  If any item is more than $60, I find that carriers such as DHL and Fedex will charge you duties.  However, shipping through Canada post, they do not.  This is because USPS has so much stuff to go through, they're not going to care about something that's $100 or $150.  However, the higher the declared value, the more likely the item will get opened, and charged.  Also, for the purposes of taxing, it doesn't matter where the item is manufactured, it's all about what country the item is being shipped from.      Your best bet, is to have the seller ship through Canada Post, and have them declare a low value.  The seller may or may not do this, as it's an expensive item, and he may want to insure the item, and of course he'll need to insure it for the correct value - but you can ask."

Ebay,3dy42n,MacLeodCuckooLand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:06:06 2015 UTC,"That is a very good idea. For the low cost of having it graded by them you verify that it is really what it is (such as a box with rocks in it that someone resealed) and they give it a grade. Im not totally sure but they can also possible appraise its value for you. I could be wrong. If they dont do appraisals, the next step is to have it appraised for an accurate value.   eBay may or may not be the best avenue for you if you are not very experienced with selling on eBay. Its easy to scam a seller if they are new. In that case going through a broker or reseller that consigns items would be a great option. They would take a certain percentage as a cut (But ebay takes their cut as well anyway), but you dont have to worry about losing the item and money."

Most items are opened, at least to inspect for illegal substances or items not safe to ship via air or legal for the location.   One suggested option for very fragile items that require special packing that is seller has provided is to add a packing slip outside of the box, such as in a packing slip envelope. Also sometimes having a packing slip just inside a box flap and well marked will prevent the package from being completely opened, or at least inspected and resealed.

I'm not saying that is what happened, buy Paypal doesn't have any proof otherwise. So the seller keeps their money, Amex refunds you, who's going to foot the bill? Paypal will probably send the balance to collections in order to make up the loss, so be prepared for some phone calls and a hit to your credit.  From Ebay's page regarding the Business Equipment Protection Program:   You receive an item that has undisclosed damage, and the item was described as being less than 10 years old.   and   You have 3 days from your receipt of the item to either contact the seller in writing or file your Business Equipment Purchase Protection claim.

I won't be over drawing my account or freezing my bank for this transaction. It just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  I was hoping to sell my game library of games that aren't made anymore to people that want them and would play them. I'm not a fan of throwing working things out. Not to just throw my hands up and curse the game when I should be hating the player but I probably won't try to sell anymore on eBay after this.  Yeah it's kind of like killing an ant with a shot gun because most of the buyers are probably legit. This isn't my primary source of income it was something I do on the side to make a few bucks clearing out my house.

Ebay,3dw3q3,autospamfighter,0,Mon Jul 20 02:01:40 2015 UTC,While I wouldn't mind using my Debit Card I was wanting to know if this process is the only way PayPal goes now before I simply cease using it on Ebay.
Ebay,3dw3q3,ThrowAwayForeBay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:17 2015 UTC,"The speed of the transfer depends on the payment method being used.   PayPal balance: if you have enough money in your PayPal account to cover the purchase, this will be used, and the funds are transferred immediately. Credit card: if you have a credit card set up on your PayPal account, payment is immediate. Instant transfer (from a bank account): Payment is immediate. To use this, you must have a credit card or debit card set up as a backup payment method. eCheck (transfer from a bank account): it usually takes between 3 and 5 business days for an eCheck to clear and the money to appear in the recipient's PayPal account."
Ebay,3dw3q3,mamashlo,0,Mon Jul 20 03:11:23 2015 UTC,While I keep my PayPal balance at $0.00 this use to never happen when I payed with PayPal. It would still remove money from my bank account automatically. Now I have to wait weeks.
Ebay,3dw3q3,rydan,0,Tue Jul 21 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"But you already received the purchased items, right?  Sounds like maybe it's PayPal's Pay After Delivery service. More info here under See Terms. You might not have noticed it during the checkout process and activated it (or were opted-in by PP). Was that mentioned in any of the emails?"
Ebay,3duuru,hisrobu,5,Sun Jul 19 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a long time seller and buyer. In 15 years its maybe happened to me twice. What types of items are you buying and is it coming from China? It sounds like your buying in a high fraud category. (Cheap knock off toys, sd cards, ect)  The way the defect standards are for sellers your out fast if your giving refunds for not delivering items.  Another point is its WAY too easy to sell on ebay. I've had a bad run with new sellers that dont have any idea how after sales work. I won a cheap listing,  paid and never heard back. I contact the seller and they said it had shipped with no tracking, ok, I wait... it shows up damaged with postage due. I take pictures and send it to the seller. She gets super pissed at me and mails me a paper personal check as a refund on the postage due. There are so many mistakes there its not even funny. I'm rambling now but it may be better for you to spend a little more with a experienced seller."
Ebay,3duuru,Pikafreaks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"All those items which never arrive are from sellers with thousands/tens of thousand sales, but now that you mention it... yeah, most of the items I buy on Ebay are along the 5-15$ range (Various electronic tools/parts, accessories, clothes, things for DIY, sporting goods, earphones, memory cards and etc). And most of the sellers are indeed from Asia (not just China).  I'm pretty sure that this is a system and not a matter of a discrimination against the seller- since none of those items ever arrived, the price of winning was indeed 40-50% cheaper than a standart buy,and in fact I reminisce that it happened in all the instances where I won the item with a noticable discount.  So, you think it is just a matter of buying from Asian sellers and other countries are more honest?  Okay, but is there still something I can do against them? And would love to hear any other thoughts on the matter as well."
Ebay,3duuru,drifting_on,0,Sun Jul 19 21:02:44 2015 UTC,"If the seller doesn't send the item but returns the money, always leave negative feedback and report the seller to ebay"
Ebay,3duuru,funchy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:16:25 2015 UTC,"Where are you buying from?  This shouldn't happen, at least with domestic orders.   Ask for a tracking number.   I've never had this happen to me.  But if you're talking international especially places like china, who knows."
Ebay,3duuru,RobertTheSpruce,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:50:06 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, every order is an international order for me (Not an american :P)."
Ebay,3duuru,RobertTheSpruce,2,Sun Jul 19 21:07:06 2015 UTC,"First of all I think you are waiting way too long for your item. If you haven't got it in 2 weeks, there is a problem. Either with the seller, or with the postal service they used, unless they specify it will take longer than that, and give you a very good reason.  How I would do it is wait two weeks at the most (one if it's domestic). Then contact the seller, asking where your item is, and (politely!) request their proof of postage, which every good eBayer will keep. Unless they come back within 24 hours with a good reason for the delay or proof of postage, hit them with an item not received report and request a refund.  If they refund you promptly, or give you a decent reason for the delay, say thank you and shop elsewhere. If they do not, let eBay refund you and hit them with a well deserved negative feedback."
Ebay,3duuru,RobertTheSpruce,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:05:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, wait, I can recieve money without the seller consent (as in recieve the money and still leave a negative feedback)?  Huh, I didn't know that.   I never used ebays complaint system because I'm not normally litigious and I'm also kinda lazy, but thank you, today I got angry enough (I now need to buy an expensive module in a hurry which on ebay normally cost only 4$) so that the next time I won't back down.  The month, though, is just the estimated arrival time so I don't have much choise (or do I?)."
Ebay,3duuru,RobertTheSpruce,2,Sun Jul 19 21:21:44 2015 UTC,"If you report that you did not receive the item to ebay, they will contact the seller and request proof they sent it.   I believe it might be a bit simpler if you do it via Paypal. I have never had to myself though.  But yes you can report that you did not receive the item, and if the seller does not refund you, or send you the item, they will return your money.  I believe you do have to wait until after the estimated delivery time."
Ebay,3dusjw,MasonForest14,3,Sun Jul 19 18:03:47 2015 UTC,It can take a couple of days.

Ebay,3dusjw,Jotatoe,2,Tue Jul 21 01:23:15 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for replying to my comment I really need some guidance.  I'm a sorta new ebay seller (skill wise) and I'm pretty sure I'm still under the ebay new seller limitations.  I've been a member a year with around $1000 I'm guessing in sales although I probably haven't sold 25 items.  In this short this is what's going on, sorry If I come off a little annoyed I've typed this story several times today.    On July the 12th I sold a video game on eBay, I printed a label with ebay and shipped it that day.  The item was recieved by my buyer on the 16th and he left positive feedback on the 18th.  It's now the 21st and my funds are still being held by PayPal.  Like an idiot yes I know, I committed to buying a product on eBay yesterday expecting to pay with my paypal balance but didn't notice until it was too late that it was still not available.  I'm a little rushed to get my money so I can pay this guy and why is paypal still holding my money?  Help"
Ebay,3dusjw,Jotatoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:22:40 2015 UTC,"Call ebay, sometimes there cab be error releasing the funds if you do certain things with the tracking, but they should be able to release the funds for you if that's what the delivery date shows."

Ebay,3du1i0,wesleyt89,6,Sun Jul 19 13:42:41 2015 UTC,"The buyer sent pictures of the damage to you. All you have to do now is to file a claim with USPS uploading a screen shot of the eBay sales record and the pics of the damage and ask for the purchase price back. USPS will send a check, you refund the buyer, the buyer keeps the item and everyone is happy. This is the way to solve this."
Ebay,3du1i0,FatCampus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"That's what I wanted to do, but wouldn't that mean he would have to take the item to USPS with the packing and all that to show them before they decide is the claim was to be honored?  Because if so, I mentioned this and he didn't want to take it up there."
Ebay,3du1i0,420big_poppa_pump420,6,Sun Jul 19 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"Nope. As long as it has insurance, all you need is the photos.   Ask him to hang onto the item until the claim is approved in case they need additional photos. It which shouldn't take longer than a week for the claim go be reviewed. In the meantime, refund him his money. It's a very simple and pain free process which I've done a few times."
Ebay,3du1i0,NEHOG,4,Sun Jul 19 17:34:55 2015 UTC,The process is simple: your buyer returns the item to you (with packaging that was damaged) and you file the claim and do the work. Generally you don't ask the buyer to do anything other than return the item to you.
Ebay,3du1i0,NEHOG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:45:37 2015 UTC,"Ohh okay.  I thought about that but thought maybe USPS would argue the damage happened when the item was being shipped back, or that the 2nd shipping would void the insurance or something.  I'm still new to this.  He acted like shipping it back would be a hassle though, he actually used the word hassle when I inquired about him returning it, so did I do the next best thing or no?  What to others usually do when the buyer doesn't feel like returning the item?"
Ebay,3du1i0,ThrowAwayForeBay,4,Sun Jul 19 14:56:01 2015 UTC,"If this was me, I'd give his money back, tell him to keep it, and move on. Not worth the problems of shipping, claiming, etc. (Just no profit there...) I see you offered a 50% refund, and he accepted. Just do that."
Ebay,3du1i0,roboticbobwhite,3,Sun Jul 19 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"There is a possibility that the item was not damaged, but your buyer is angling for a refund (or partial refund), as well as keeping the item.   I would send them a message, stating that you will issue a refund as soon as you receive the return. If they don't return it, don't refund."
Ebay,3du1i0,roboticbobwhite,2,Sun Jul 19 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"For an $11 item that cost at minimum $5 to return ship (the cheapest priority is generally just a hair under $5), I don't see an upside to asking for it to be returned.   This tactic rewards possible scammers, but it will add another $5 cost to the seller. For a $30+ item I would generally ask for it to be returned, but not for a $11 item with buyer-provided photos of the damage."
Ebay,3du1i0,Teawouldbelovely,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"The reason I listed it for so cheap was because even though it was unopened the box had nics and shelf wear, which I listed in the auction pictures.  One sold for $30 that was in mint.  My mindset behind offering 50% off was that even though the box did get smashed the toy inside it is still good.  Idk I might have did wrong, I am still new to this."
Ebay,3dtxpo,Many_Many_Questions,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:55:29 2015 UTC,They pressed a button that basically approved and initiated the returns process.  Now all you have to do is ship it back.  there should be a complimentary shipping label there.
Ebay,3dtxpo,Enferrari,2,Sun Jul 19 13:04:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I saw how on some ebay community forums show the sellers list a RMA to ship back (return merchandise address), guess I have to wait for that then."
Ebay,3dtxpo,aussie770,3,Sun Jul 19 13:21:21 2015 UTC,"RMA is a Return merchant authorization.  It is generally used by larger sellers so that they can identify your return.  If they accepted the return, you should have received a label to ship your item back. No need to wait for anything else."
Ebay,3dtxpo,Enferrari,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:46:04 2015 UTC,"No problem.  And nah if it's a small seller, they likely don't need RMAs and if the seller did, they would have left a note.  All you need to do is ship it back and when it says ""delivered"" you're all set"

Odds of a successful sale with getting ripped off: close to zero if you follow these rules, and exactly zero if you don't. IOW, you won't do well selling these on eBay.

Ebay,3dtztz,NEHOG,0,Sun Jul 19 14:41:54 2015 UTC,"In this case, the seller provided tracking that isn't working and isn't answering messages. To me that is not 100% proof that it was actually mailed."
Ebay,3dtztz,NEHOG,4,Sun Jul 19 14:54:40 2015 UTC,"Means nothing. Tracking often is bad coming out of China, in fact often bad from many non-US locations. As to answering questions, the seller is poor at communicating? After all they may not have an English speaker handy every day, or someone who is readily available to answer questions.   Regardless, the rules say not until after the last estimated delivery date."
Ebay,3dtztz,laurier112,2,Sun Jul 19 15:00:31 2015 UTC,"Most tracking from China simply doesn't work, wait until after the last estimate delivery date before you open a case.  I've had cases where I've opened a case only to have the item arrive after the item arrives."

I order from China all the time (mostly small toys and accessories - phone cases, barbie shoes, dollhouse miniatures, etc) and rarely do I get a tracking number, or the seller will input something random. I receive about 98% of my purchases. Remember that unless you pay for faster shipping, most stuff from China will take between 3-8 weeks to get to you."
Ebay,3dtztz,PeeQueueAre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:09:54 2015 UTC,This happened to me. It's probably in transit and it may have missed a scan.  My package arrived a week late and the tracking info showed up on the day it was delivered.
Ebay,3dtztz,Pokabu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:05:52 2015 UTC,When buying from China it can take anywhere between 2 weeks to a month to receive your package.  Most upload a weird tracking number/custom number. Mostly the custom number that way they can at least determine if it made it through customs.   I've very rarely ever get a real tracking number with Chinese but I always get the package. Just wait it out until the final date said for receiving.   In the future of you want tracking you can ask chinese sellers although it costs a handful more. Just ask for DHL or EMS. Usually they want to keep stuff cheap to make it available for everyone.  Just be patient :)
Ebay,3dtmge,Big_Daddy_65,3,Sun Jul 19 09:48:56 2015 UTC,"Before you list any item on Ebay make sure you know how you're going to ship it. Put it in a box, weigh the box, measure the dimensions and then calculate postage. I've had my worst problems when not figuring out how to ship ahead of time, or not having the supplies after a sale.  Make sure you have payment before you ship. Ebay will let you know, so don't fall for the scam emails that say it's been paid. Always check for yourself on Ebay.  Once you get payment, ship immediately. How fast you ship can get you good feedback, along with excellent packing. Always have tracking on all your packages.  Take very good and very accurate pictures. If there is a fault in the item clearly state that. It's better for someone to receive an item happily surprised than to be disappointed.  To see how much things will sell for check the 'Sold Listings'. That way you know what people will pay. If you just look at the auctions, those prices are the hoped for price.  There are you tube videos and free kindle books. I haven't found them valuable. I read a lot on Ebay's rules/blogs on the official site. I also follow groups who sell on Ebay.  You don't say why you're selling on ebay. If it's to de-clutter then you really don't need books. If it's to make a few extra bucks to cover a pet's surgery (like I'm doing) then you might want to check out some forums, videos but I'd skip the books. They just re-hash what has been said on forums.  Good luck!"
Ebay,3dtmge,sirius_moonlight,2,Sun Jul 19 15:07:18 2015 UTC,Honestly I beer ready any books or stuff like that. Just go on eBay and search for what  items to sell. Check sold listings on those items and see what they sell for. Then give it a shot
Ebay,3dtmge,Ineeditunesalot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, this. When doing a search for a particular item you select a box to show sold items in the search settings. Then you can see what recent items have sold for and how frequently etc."
Ebay,3dtmge,kaspins,2,Sun Jul 19 12:41:54 2015 UTC,You don't need books.   You don't need to over think this.   Go on there and look up items just like the ones you have.  Be sure to look at the price of sold items (completed auctions) to get a real idea of demand and value.      Ebay has some how to pages. But it's just a form you fill out for each item.  Do take several good photos of each item.     You'll want a paypal account to accept payment and pay ebay fees.   Then just list a few things and see how it goes.    Sometimes it's a learning process.   The more items you sell the better you'll get at it.
Ebay,3dtmge,funchy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:27:15 2015 UTC,"I've learned a lot from the ecommercebytes blog. I recommend that.

Ebay,3dtmge,Uberhip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:38:41 2015 UTC,"Very desirable items are good for auctions, mostly you should stick to Buy it Now for 30 days.  So what you want to do is look up the item in eBay and under refine results click completed listings and sold items. That will tell you how much and how often the item is selling. So if you don't mind waiting a little while set the price higher, if you need it sold fast, set it a little lower. I almost always do free shipping and include that into the price, there are shipping calculators online you can use, but generally you can gather that info from the listings. Then when someone buys the item, make damn sure it's paid for (don't trust emails) and ship the item out.  Be sure to take plenty of pictures and describe any and all defects. Don't try to use a cheaper shipping method than you advertised. Be sure to carefully pack the item (imagine the ups guy is going to play a full game of Rugby with it) and make sure you get a tracking number. If you have a scale print labels online, if not just go to the post office and do it there or fed ex for heavier items."
Ebay,3dtmge,Lawrencium265,2,Sun Jul 19 14:11:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, you definitely should NOT stick to Buy It Now for 30 days.  If a buyer is just casually looking for something they might want, what is going to make them buy an item that will still be fore sale in 4 weeks?  You want to ignite a flame in them and make them feel like there is a time constraint to get the item.  If there is a desirable item that has a Buy It Now for only 5 days, the buyer does  not know if the seller will relist it.  I've had much more success reducing the Buy It Now listing duration."

Ebay,3dtya1,Jotatoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:15 2015 UTC,"right? and the worst part is, if there js any problem they will definitely leave bad feedback"
Ebay,3dtya1,Jotatoe,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly positive feedback doesn't mean much. It doesn't help your defect rating, it doesn't earn you discounts, and having a handful of positive feedback is just as good as having thousands.  Ultimately, are you using eBay to make money, or to earn feedback?"
Ebay,3dtya1,Jotatoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:27 2015 UTC,If you get one negative feedback and detailed seller ratings it will bring your account below standard and limit your selling unless you have 98 positive feedback and detailed seller ratings to balance it out.
Ebay,3dtya1,Jotatoe,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:43 2015 UTC,"Getting a negative feedback does count as a defect, but your account only falls below standard if you have higher than a 5% defect rating AND 8 or more defects.  Also your defect rating is calculated based off of the number of transactions you've had and how many of them had defects, not the number of positive feedbacks or DSR's you've received. It doesn't matter if they leave a positive feedback or not."
Ebay,3dtya1,Jotatoe,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:18 2015 UTC,I thought that DSR's and feedbacks where what made your account above or below standard. I'm an eBay buyer too and I've left negative feedback before but I didn't see a defect option. What are defects and how is it determined that a transaction is a defect?
Ebay,3dtya1,Jotatoe,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:54 2015 UTC,"Your defect rating and seller performance are confidential, so you can't check other people's seller rating. If you click My eBay at the top right, then click Account on the left hand side, then Click ""Seller Dashboard"" also on the left hand side, it will give you a look at your selling performance, there it will show you your defects.  You can receive a defect for multiple reasons:  1) Cancelling a transaction after the item has sold even thought the buyer still wanted the item (Selecting out of stock or could not fulfill order for other reason)  2) Receiving a Low Detailed Seller Rating (3 star's or lower in any category)  3) Having a return request opened for Not as Described (Including counterfeit/Broken/Damaged in shipping, these stay on the account even if the request is closed by the buyer)  4) Having a request opened for Item not received (These stay on the account even if the item is received, unless tracking shows as delivered within the stated shipping and handling time)  5) Receiving Neutral or Negative feedback.  You can call eBay for defect removal in some circumstances, but honestly they are rarely removed. Your accounts performance is determined by the last 12 months of sales, so it takes that long for a defect to fall off. (Unless you do more than 400 transactions in the last 3 months, in which case your accounts performance includes only the last 3 months of sales/defects)."
Ebay,3dtya1,ThrowAwayForeBay,2,Tue Jul 21 01:44:58 2015 UTC,Thank you! The only defect that I would have there would be a low detailed seller rating or neutral/negative feedback or very very rarely a return case so having low amount of positive feedback would make it must easier for the ratio to drop below standard.
Ebay,3dtya1,trialstroublestribs,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:42 2015 UTC,"Take the number of defects you've had in the past 12 months and divide it by the number of transactions you've in the past 12 months. If that number is greater than 0.5, you're below standard.  Positive feedback does not come into play when referring to Below Standard."
Ebay,3dtya1,laurier112,2,Tue Jul 21 01:57:56 2015 UTC,"Really? So its just based off of total transactions vs defects, not good transactions vs defects?"
Ebay,3dtya1,trialstroublestribs,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Sometimes there are certain restrictions that require you to have 25 feedback before doing certain things, but beyond that its just a number.  The only benefit from having large amount of positive feedback you get, is that every 1000 positive feedback, you get an additional 5 feedback revision requests, but rarely are those needed anyway."
Ebay,3dtya1,ThrowAwayForeBay,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:29 2015 UTC,"From what you've shown it looks like you've done a good job as a seller, I would just focus on that. Its good to have re-assurance that your buyers are happy with your item, but you don't need feedback to prove that."
Ebay,3dtya1,ThrowAwayForeBay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:12:39 2015 UTC,"wow, did not know this, thanks!"
Ebay,3dtya1,trialstroublestribs,5,Tue Jul 21 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"When sellers send me a message reminding me to leave five star feedback I find it, at best, highly annoying. If I haven't left feedback, it's because I chose not to.    By sending these messages, you may prompt buyers to leave negative/neutral feedback, or positive feedback with low DSRs. It only needs a tiny fraction of crazy buyers to mess up your reputation. I would far rather receive no feedback, than 99 positive and one negative."
Ebay,3dtya1,Amylacetate,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:58:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah for years before I became a seller I never left ANY feedback for things I bought on eBay. Why? I didn't have any idea how important it was to sellers and honestly I don't care.   When I order a product from Target.com or any other store I would never consider taking another moment out of my day to write them a review. I think that people just aren't used to the paradigm of leaving feedback when you order online and how it's an important part of the process.   Now that I sell, I leave feedback for everything I buy. Buyers just don't care and IMO they shouldn't have to leave feedback if they don't want to. I have a handful of pos-feedback but I don't really care too much, just keep listing."
Ebay,3dtya1,breeclaire,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, someone on here said that positive feedback actually doesn't affect your selling limits at all. The only thing that matters is amount of defects in relation to total transactions."
Ebay,3dtya1,nedomedo,-3,Wed Jul 22 02:02:13 2015 UTC,It is very hard for sellers have a decent feedback rating because people don't want to wright a review of a transaction was good or on par because that is what's expected so sellers ratings look worse than they really are. Messages like this try to get people to take 10 seconds to leave positive feedback and reminds them to message if there's a problem instead of just leaving negative with no contact.  Why would it be 'highly annoying' for someone to ask you to take 10 seconds to give them a review after they took the time to make the transaction smooth?
Ebay,3dtya1,stripeytee,2,Sun Jul 19 15:10:21 2015 UTC,"The other posters are right...sending messages asking for a positive feedback can be annoying.      This is what I do to get feedback, and even then, only get 15-20% of items sold will get feedback.      I ship the next business day.  All items I ship get wrapped in multiple layers of gift wrap tissue paper, I leave a hand printed card, and then wrap the whole thing in kraft paper.  I prewrap everything on a weekend afternoon while watching baseball, so it the time comes to send it, all I got to do is print out an address label."
Ebay,3dtya1,ThrowAwayForeBay,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, want good feedback? Make sure your operation is tight as you can get it and don't put off shipping an extra day so you can watch TV, get up and go to the post office.  Also I leave my feedback on the day their package arrives. Hoping they will see the package, be excited, notice they got a new review on their eBay and then return the favor."
Ebay,3dtya1,Skeetx2,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:44:22 2015 UTC,I'll try leaving feedback when they receive the item. Thanks!

Ebay,3dtya1,trialstroublestribs,3,Sun Jul 19 19:30:29 2015 UTC,"If, as a buyer, I didn't give feedback, it's usually because I wasn't 100% satisfied with the service I received, but it wasn't bad enough to leave bad feedback. By spamming me with your ""leave me 5 stars"" message, you are far more likely to change that ""no feedback"" into a neutral/negative, than to get a 5-star positive."
Ebay,3dtya1,trialstroublestribs,-3,Sun Jul 19 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"That's why it also says to contact me before leaving bad feedback. I can't read your mind and know what's wrong without you contacting me which is why that's part of the message.  I truly don't understand how you could possibly be offended and think it's spam to send someone one message that is not demanding they leave feedback, but saying: when you get the time, could you please.."
Ebay,3dtya1,Remarksey,3,Sun Jul 19 15:25:39 2015 UTC,"As an eBay buyer, I already know that I can leave the seller feedback. eBay will automatically send a reminder after 30 days if I don't.

Ebay,3dtya1,accountforreddit123,-6,Sun Jul 19 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"It is not meant for people who specifically chose not to leave feedback or contact their seller with a problem, ( I was unaware that angry people like you existed haha ) it is meant for people who forgot or don't know how to leave feedback (like the person I sent the message to) or people who would otherwise leave negative feedback without contacting the seller first.  I don't understand your anger or your mindset, it is irrational to ny leave feedback to someone who you had a good transaction with or to not contact someone who you've had a bad transaction with to try to fix it, which is why my message addresses both."
Ebay,3dtya1,Scrapper69,3,Sun Jul 19 15:56:55 2015 UTC,"Throwawayforebay is not angry or do they have a bad mindset in relation to feedback. He is stating a very common feeling of many sellers and buyers, including me (veteran seller). Buyers get annoyed when you hassle them for feedback. If they wanted to leave it they would have.  Feedback will come in time. Concentrate on providing excellent service and products. Accept that feedback is voluntary. Your best way to get a buyer to leave positive feedback is to provide them with an excellent transaction, not hassle/beg for it after the fact.    Throwawayforebay is trying to give you good advice and you are choosing to ignore it/argue about it. If you were not interested in replies than don't post.   BTW ebay already sends your buyers a feedback reminder. When you also do it it starts to seem spammy to the buyer."
Ebay,3dtya1,Scrapper69,3,Sun Jul 19 18:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, please do not ask buyers to leave feedback that will get you a bunch of negatives. I don't even like mentioning the word feedback. I just leave them positive immediately after they buy from me. I have 100% positive currently, but that one crappy buyer that you can't satisfy will come along and leave you a negative. Then you have to wait a year for it to disappear. Usually I get negative comments by people who have English as their second language. However sometimes when they do I call them on the phone immediately and try to work something out. I usually say something like ""Hi this is ___ your purchased the item from me on eBay. I apologize for anything that happened is there any way we can work this out? I can replace with new one, or I will send you all the money back and you can keep it etc. etc. please revise your feedback"" always just pushing to work things out and that they are right and you are sorry. That is how you will get resolution usually. I also try to get them to revise while they are on the phone with me so that I can guide them to the right spot.  Also like everyone else said some people are new and don't know where to go to leave feedback. New people are more likely to give you a negative anyway so why ask them to do it? Many times they also think they are reviewing the item and don't understand how feedback works.  Also perhaps they already were pissed about the product and they moved on. Then a month later someone messages them to contact them in case of any problems. Maybe then the guy will be as a matter of fact YES there is.  When I first started selling on eBay I was told that 40% of buyers leave feedback. When I count my transactions it comes out to exactly that.   Don't worry so much about feedback it will come. Some people wait almost 2 months to leave it. They wait to see if the item will break at some point so they have feedback as their ammo against seller.  If you know there will be a problem, do not respond to buyers email call them on the phone right away. Do not leave a voicemail try a few more times to get it resolved person to person over the phone. If you cannot then respond to messages. If you speak in person chances of a negative will go down dramatically.  Oh and always offer something to resolve the issue, ALWAYS.  Thats my tips for you"

Ebay,3dtya1,Slicktorine,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:03:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, you, like most buyers, know they can leave feedback. The eBay message is merely a reminder to do so as it is well within reason to conceive that although a buyer may know they can leave feedback, they may not have done so because they have simply forgotten. As a seller, we understand once a product has been received, leaving feedback for the transaction may not be priority in the buyers mind. This is not an unreasonable assumption by any stretch of the imagination. To assume the buyer has the mindset that you have just spoke about in terms of leaving feedback is just ridiculous. You're the type of person everyone rolls their eyes at when it comes to this sort of thing."

I was a little pissed when I saw it, but honestly I'm just going to keep truckin'. When you deal with the public, and seemingly especially those on eBay, you're bound to have something stupid like this happen.

But a piece of advice, anytime a customer asks you to provide something like pre-paid shipping or a label, just do it. Often times a customer will want to do as little as possible, especially if the issue is not their fault. I actually know someone else who received a negative because they didn't offer a label ahead of time. But in that case the buyer still sent the item back. In that situation try to make the customer do as little as possible to finish the return, here is a label, please place the item in a similar envelope, you can schedule a pickup at your door at this website, ect."
Ebay,3dt8vu,Notsellingcrap,2,Sun Jul 19 12:39:26 2015 UTC,"I generally offer prepaid labels if people message me, but since I'm opted in to hassle free returns, as soon as someone opens a return, it is supposed to automatically send them a pre-paid label, which what I told him...

Sure you might strike a huge gold nugget, but most prospectors made it by selling shovels, or collecting gold dust and smelting it. In other words, look often, and deals will be found everywhere. Find stuff others want, sell it, then buy what you want; or look often and everywhere to get specific items."
Ebay,3dr1zw,Notsellingcrap,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:26:21 2015 UTC,"Yup, make your own luck for sure. (That's a saying) Eventually you will strike gold. With any market there are things you can get easily and others that are difficult, and price is proportional. Maybe you start with gamecubes and N64s from Craigslist and thrift shops and move on to the older stuff as you get more experienced.  It doesn't matter what you're selling, putting yourself out there and doing the work will eventually pay off"

People can sell their used games there and get store credit to buy others. The store then resells those games. You might want to check those kinds of places, too.   If you're looking for certain games in particular networking can be good for that. Maybe find some game forums. Many people on forums will trade or sell without trying to make a huge profit.

The long answer is, you can change your site registration, but it won't allow you to bypass that. eBay matches the address you have on file with the site you're registering to sell in. If the two do not match, you'll receive the block you're getting now.  If you put down an address that is not yours then you won't be able to pass verification to establish selling limits."

A pair of dice should have been a quick, easy, trivial sale for him to build up some positive feedback and pad his transaction count with a drama-free sale.  Instead he tried to scam you with very obviously damaged goods.  I would request a refund, and if he is appologetic and granted it right away I would not leave any feedback (neutral and negative are the same thing in ebay's eyes) and move on with life.  If he gives me any bullshit I'd file a dispute with ebay, get my money, and leave him a middle finger in the form of negative feedback.  As a seller myself there's no reason for this to happen.  It's possible that he's a bigger seller and has employees that just don't know or don't care about the details of each sale, but even still it's his job to make sure his operation goes smoothly.

Ebay,3dnjj7,phascolarctos,4,Fri Jul 17 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"Sellers cannot give buyers negative feedback. To answer your questions, I have a few of my own.   How much was the item? Was the item completely useless? Why did you ask for a partial refund on a broken item rather than a full refund?"
Ebay,3dnjj7,gmurnane,-4,Fri Jul 17 18:53:20 2015 UTC,"The case was just broken so that's why I asked for a partial refund. I just gave him a neutral rating because it wasn't packaged well, in my opinion, I could be wrong. Is it possible to change my rating to positive? Even though he was pretty rude I was just want to smooth things out."
Ebay,3dnjj7,gmurnane,10,Fri Jul 17 19:11:09 2015 UTC,"To me, the seller deserves a positive. It really isn't very nice to approach a seller with a problem and then give them a negative or neutral when they fix it in a way you requested."
Ebay,3dnjj7,CaptainColeslaw,3,Fri Jul 17 20:53:17 2015 UTC,Yes. Ask the seller to send you a feedback revision request.
Ebay,3dnjj7,StanS2,5,Fri Jul 17 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"The feedback (positive) I would have left: ""DVD case arrived broken but seller gave partial refund."" You can buy a new case for the $1 he refunded you."
Ebay,3dnjj7,Griffin-dork,3,Fri Jul 17 23:20:20 2015 UTC,"First off, he is right, it is an issue with the postal carrier, not the seller. Its a Disc case, even with bubble wrap, whatever happened to it to break the case would of still broken it.   As for the ratings, you have to understand that a neutral rating is just as bad as a negative. It  still gives them a defect and eBay is incredibly harsh on sellers when it comes to defects.   There is also the point that sellers cannot give non-positive feedback to buyers, which is complete bullshit. So thats not something you have to worry about.   Honestly I would of just filed a claim with the carrier if it mattered to you that much. The seller didnt do anything wrong. They are rightfully angry, however its not professional to express that to a customer unless a customer is being very unreasonable."
Ebay,3dnjj7,Griffin-dork,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree that I should've given a positive rating. I just didn't know that it could be the postal carrier's fault as stupid as that sounds. I'm not even mad that it came broken at all. I didn't know a neutral rating was just as bad. I didn't think he should've been angry because I was literally just too stupid to know that he would be. I thought it was normal. I also found it unprofessional how he accused me of scamming and getting so angry. He should've just politely explained why he was unhappy with my rating. You don't start a message with: ""Are you kidding me!"""
Ebay,3dnjj7,hypntyz,2,Fri Jul 17 19:17:12 2015 UTC,With the rampant fraud/scams on eBay in many categories (99% buyers scamming sellers) I find it understandable. You can go and revise your feedback. So if you would like to do so go ahead. The seller more than likely will be more than happy to help you.
Ebay,3dmmai,yagofp8,2,Fri Jul 17 14:31:17 2015 UTC,"Can you explain more what you mean?  I've been buying on eBay for 17 years and it's always been a proxy bid system in my experience. The best strategy as a buyer is usually to place a single bid as late as possible so that you don't find yourself in a bidding war (but there may be exceptions to this strategy).  There are snipe services that will put in that single, late bid for you if you aren't going to be around at the very end of the auction. Is this what you are referring to? Those are all third-party services, there is no way to delay your bid directly through eBay."
Ebay,3dmmai,MacLeodCuckooLand,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:39:03 2015 UTC,I think he's talking about submitting your maximum bid and it will automatically increase your bid in increments up to your max if someone outbids you.
Ebay,3dmmai,roma1625,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"I thought so too, but that's been the way eBay works going back as far as I can remember.

Ebay,3dmmai,MacLeodCuckooLand,0,Fri Jul 17 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I recall when they didn't have that. Not sure how long ago, though. Time flies when you're having fun."

I'd message the seller and ask for a refund. If they don't help you, open a case for significantly not as described and eBay will force a refund."
Ebay,3dmg1f,redslaundry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:43:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info.  The seller has a great rating.  I'm going to open a case with them now.
Ebay,3dmg1f,TheKid72,2,Fri Jul 17 13:52:13 2015 UTC,"Before you open a case, work with the seller. Before a case is opened through eBay, a good seller will do their best to work out the problem. When the seller files a claim with the USPS, it does take some time - so at least keep the lines of communication open.   However if you open a case against the seller, they are penalized by eBay and no longer have any incentive to help you as eBay takes over, refunds you, thrashes the seller as eBay considers this the fault of the seller.   If this is a small item, most sellers will just refund you without eBay intervention."

Ebay,3dmg1f,Pokabu,0,Fri Jul 17 21:54:43 2015 UTC,Id say contact seller and let him know what's up. He will most likely ask you to open a case with USPS. if it was priority mail it'll be insured up to 50$ unless he paid for more. I am not sure however if it is your job to take it up with USPS or the sellers job.
Ebay,3dm1qc,ziplock9000,3,Fri Jul 17 10:50:45 2015 UTC,"If a return is required, then you return the item in order to receive the refund.   Keep in mind that the seller is obligated to pay for return shipping (either by sending you a prepaid label, or working with you and refunding your cost to ship the item). Depending on the value of the item, many sellers don't request the item back and simply issue a refund.   Due to the very harsh penalties from eBay, many sellers work extra hard to avoid having you open a case. Once a case is opened, it is out of the seller's hands and the seller has been penalized regardless of the outcome. In other words, there is no longer any reason for the seller to help you."

EBay s return process is pretty cut and dry in the case.  Most times eBay Will send you a prepaid return label, charge the seller for it, and then automatically refund you upon delivery confirmation by the carrier if you open a case.  If they refuse the package it takes a little longer but you get the item and the cash."

However, they can still open a Paypal case. But I wouldn't be worried for several reasons. First, opening a Paypal case isn't as easy/obvious as opening an eBay case. Secondly, Paypal is more seller friendly and requires buyers to pay for return shipping."
Ebay,3dk3ii,redslaundry,3,Thu Jul 16 23:47:01 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer. Had a similar experience
Ebay,3dk3ii,Enferrari,3,Thu Jul 16 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"If you sell on eBay, you take returns. If a buyer wants to get their money back, they can. 99.9% of people are not jerks, but if someone really wants to return or get their money back for something they purchased on eBay, they can."
Ebay,3dk3ii,bigblacksquirrel,2,Fri Jul 17 00:06:03 2015 UTC,"What was the reason given for the return?   Early on, eBay stated that the difference between those who opted in to hassle free returns and those who did not simply changed the way the return was handled with regards to opening a case vs. opening a return.   If this is an instance where the buyer simply changed their mind, you really are ahead to allow them to return the item, shipping out of their pocket, and refund them (less shipping if applicable).   If they open a case for item not as described (say it's the wrong shade of Puce), you will eat everything."

Ebay,3dj3xf,long218,8,Thu Jul 16 18:04:51 2015 UTC,Dont sell it on eBay. You clearly dont know what youre doing. eBay is not a good platform for you. Just use a local selling platform like Craigslist.
Ebay,3dj3xf,Griffin-dork,-14,Thu Jul 16 18:26:58 2015 UTC,Wow you're such a great person.
Ebay,3dj3xf,Sokid,4,Thu Jul 16 19:08:34 2015 UTC,"What? Its honest advice. The phrase ""How should I do it so I will not get chargeback"" is blatantly something someone who has zero clue how to sell on eBay would say. If you dont know what you are doing it is very easy to get scammed by a buyer. Especially on something like an iPod touch, an item that has high scam/fraud rates.   The advice I gave is very common in this sub. When someone is looking to sell a personal item, especially something like an Apple product, they are often told to forget eBay because of its hostile environment to sellers, and the fact that if you are only trying to get money out of one or a few personal items, eBay isnt worth it. Craigslist is easier, safer, and will net you more money in your pocket."
Ebay,3dj3xf,Griffin-dork,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:22:21 2015 UTC,& he's 100000% right about it. Hes actually a great person for giving such great advice. EBay will offer little to no protection if something goes wrong & would all be for nothing. Sellers get shafted beyond belief at times. Its not worth the risk if you can do it elsewhere.
Ebay,3dj3xf,CraziBoi94,4,Thu Jul 16 21:43:13 2015 UTC,"By putting it on Craigslist and selling it in person for cash, only.  Ebay doesn't have enough protections for sellers, anymore.

The % rate is just a broken mechanism that doesn't accurately weigh the damage a bad transaction does to the ""good faith"" participant. Look at the mega sellers that still generate thousands of negatives and neutral transactions a month but not enough to impact their account on a % basis. Those are thousands of buyers who are given a reason to not use eBay again on a monthly basis.  The same deal with the sheer amount of fraudulent buyers that sellers must deal with. If you have no experience selling anything online, eBay and PayPal are terrible choices to try and move the most common of resold items in the market today: electronics.

Ebay,3dh1t1,nate51595,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:01:35 2015 UTC,"Please, please folks: please stop recommending ""Take a video"" or ""Take pictures"". Neither eBay or PayPal will care one bit about videos or pictures. Nor would any court. Taking a video of you packing or opening a package is a colossal waste of your time."
Ebay,3dh1t1,NEHOG,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:05:31 2015 UTC,"I am curious as to why you think this. Obviously no court would take this as evidence because you could fabricate a video of you opening a package very easily. Any defense could easily make it inadvisable in court but very few cases ever make it to court. My point is that taking a video helps more than it hurts. For example, a situation in which someone ships books instead of a ps4 you will never see that case making it outside of eBay or PayaPal. Showing a video of you receiving the package and opening it might be enough for a scammer like that to give up right away. Also they will ask for photos (probably not videos) of the incorrect item so showing a process in which you opened the item to receive the incorrect will will help more than hurt.  In this users situation I would go with your gut feeling. If it feels ""too good to be true"" then I would shy away even if it is a good deal. I have never gotten scammed in a way where a user sends the incorrect item or no item at all so I have no knowledge on how eBay processes claims like that."
Ebay,3dh1t1,nate51595,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:31:41 2015 UTC,"I know of no cases where eBay or PayPal asked for pictures of a seller packing, or a buyer opening a shipment. And I've been in this for years. The reason is the same as with a court: too easily faked.   Pictures they ask for a typically to show undisclosed damage."
Ebay,3dh1t1,StanS2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:39:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, have you heard or dealt with any cases of a scam or improperly shipped item? In the case where they ask for ""undisclosed damage"" that would apply to an ""item not as described"" case, not in the case where you are being scammed. In the case where you are being scammed they would ask for pictures of the item you received. It couldn't hurt to show you opening the item. Before I ship out anything with a value of over $400 I always take pictures of me packing the item. Again, it could be argued that what I did was faked but its nice to have those pictures. All it took was 40 seconds out of my life to take the pictures but if I run into a case where I am getting scammed that 40 seconds could prove very useful."
Ebay,3dh1t1,nate51595,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:48:56 2015 UTC,"After taking the pics, a dishonest seller could open the package from the bottom, remove the item, fill the package with rocks, reseal. Your pics will prove nothing, I'm afraid."
Ebay,3dh05n,Volkodavy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:04:21 2015 UTC,"You won't have a problem if you can't pay. However just to know if the transaction might go through at some point, you may want to call PayPal. They likely can't tell you the reason due to privacy issues, but they can advise you to go on or wait for a problem to clear.   Most likely this issue saved you from a problem with the seller!"

Ebay,3dg4bc,OrangePhantom20,3,Thu Jul 16 00:22:28 2015 UTC,"They require the ability that they (eBay/PayPal) be able to check independently from you that a package was delivered.

Ebay,3dg4bc,NEHOG,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"Unless it's a very expensive item, seller protection only requires tracking, not signature on delivery.

Ebay,3df5nz,CatanX,2,Wed Jul 15 20:54:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I was sorta worried about this too but I'm figuring I shouldn't be as worried as you since my items are professionally graded and sealed. Have you sold any smaller type items since then or was that your one and only experience?

Ebay,3df5nz,CatanX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:04:36 2015 UTC,Did you ever have someone claim they didn't receive their item on a lower priced item that you didn't use a tracking number for?
Ebay,3df5nz,TheKid72,2,Wed Jul 15 22:29:54 2015 UTC,No I always use first class or priority mail
Ebay,3df5nz,americanpzycho,5,Wed Jul 15 22:45:18 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is your selling limit. If you aren't setup as a seller, go ahead to do so as well as set up your Selling Manager page if you haven't already (it's free).   On that page will be your quantity of listings and dollar amount limit per month. A mega high ticket item may exceed the amount, and fixed price / immediate payment required (where that limit will really come into play) might be a problem. Auctions are risky due to non-payment problems.. too many kids playing with the computer with no intention on paying will be a major issue for you. That's why Buy It Now with Immediate Payment Required is a really good idea.   If you take the auction route, worst case with selling limits would be that you may not receive all of your funds - just your limit, per month.   I'd really work up a good selling reputation first, so that buyers can see your good feedback as a seller. That will really help when selling a high ticket item, as a new seller selling a high ticket item always raises a red flag even when the seller is legit.   Just watch out for the scammer PayPal messages about payment (fake messages), ship fast and don't hesitate using an adult signature confirmation below the required level if something is truly special. Believe me when I say this, there are more scammers on eBay as buyers than there are as sellers! Be careful! Don't hesitate to ask us about anything you aren't sure about."
Ebay,3df5nz,CavalierEternals,2,Wed Jul 15 22:30:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thorough answer. I think I am going to build up my reputation first. It will at least give me some practice with the whole process.
Ebay,3df5nz,bigblacksquirrel,2,Thu Jul 16 05:14:03 2015 UTC,I have sold 3-4 Tag watches and a Breitling. All over 2k and no issues.

The guy asked me to use his UPS account and that he would cover the shipping. Worked out great and he even allowed me to use his UPS account to package the item. I rarely if ever have had a problem selling on ebay however I usually only sell like 5-10 things a month.
Ebay,3df5nz,ihaveb4lls,2,Thu Jul 16 05:46:06 2015 UTC,"The number of scammers on eBay is blow way out of proportion on this sub, and the eBay forums.

I posted about this previously, so I'll just copy and paste my previous post.   A buyer is allowed to open both an INR and a SNAD for quite good reasoning. If they couldn't open both, then nothing would prevent the sellers who do choose to actually scam from waiting to ship an item until the INR was opened, then shipping something like rocks etc. There would be proof of delivery, thus closing the INR, but the buyer would have actually received rocks."

I've bought quite a few things on eBay and I've had sellers not ship for a few weeks and when I file for my money back they reappear and get all defensive.

What eBay does is give the seller the option of just refunding the money - which would apply to a situation such as shipping the wrong (low cost) item or if you had already worked out something with the buyer, but eBay automatically assumes there is a return.   As you have learned, there is no such thing as no returns on eBay. There are exceptions, but they need to be handled on a case by case basis - often after the item has been returned."
Ebay,3ddyqg,TheKid72,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:11:10 2015 UTC,THe thing is this is a non defect return. They marked the item as no longer needed and said it was the right size but ran too small for them. I had the option to reject the refund.
Ebay,3ddyqg,Cboy808,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:22:11 2015 UTC,Just don't do anything. Eventually eBay will close the return and refund the buyer and they keep your item. You don't get dinged or lose money. That's usually how it goes anyway.
Ebay,3ddyqg,Cirqued,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"You should reconsider accepting returns. Not only is it good customer service but it will increase sales. Dont worry about a flood of new returns. There have been studies that show the rate of return is lower the longer the return policy is. Not only will you get more sales but your items will also get increased visibility. eBay gives you a search bump, meaning increased visibility in the Cassini search engine when you have a 14 day return policy. What that means is that if we both offer an item for sale at the same price and same sales velocity ebay will give my listing prominence over yours for having a 14 day return policy. So not only do customers feel safer buying from me but then ebay gives me a search bump. Boom! Just like that I've double the sales on that item."

Since virtually no eBay buyer has any idea what FOB is, IMHO it is best to ignore that option. So local pickup.

You can ship heavy items by either local pickup, a car shipper, or by a freight company. We dealt at one place with a company that gave you the best price between freight companies. It's pretty expensive, but worth it if the customer pays. Local pickup is good too, just post the option along with the freight option. We had people drive from states away to pick up things sometimes (we sold tons of industrial stuff).

I should have said     Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT / 350D 8.0 MP Digital SLR Camera - Black - (Body Only)   The buyer is just uninformed, and believes that any camera that can't take pictures out of the box needs to be listed as ""Parts - Not Working""  or at least is trying to use this to get his money back fraudulently."

It would be helpful if the buyer could write you something that would lessen his chances of an outcome in his favour.   I should have said    if you just omitted 'black' also.   get his money back fraudulently.    worst case is paying international shipping, ebay fees,  a defect and a negative feedback on your account and then getting back a different camera that doesn't work and feeling thankful that at least it wasn't a box of rocks."

Some sellers attempt to personalise the experience (thank you notes, nice feedback, chocolates), this can work and make the buyer more amenable to negotiation when they're not happy.  returnable, depends on what you're selling. The 'no questions asked return' is a very American idea, and it's used by big stores to help people impulse buy, it works for volume, it works for ebay inc. but I don't think it works for casual sellers.

Ebay,3ddcnv,Enferrari,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:05:41 2015 UTC,Yup just gotta pick charge to bank instead of PayPal balance.
Ebay,3ddcnv,Enferrari,2,Thu Jul 16 08:20:18 2015 UTC,"Your transaction will be processed as a credit card (you aren't entering your PIN during the transaction), thus the process will be the same."
Ebay,3ddcnv,atheos,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:16:23 2015 UTC,But what happens if I don't receive my items? How would I get my money back?
Ebay,3dd3xo,evaMart,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:30:36 2015 UTC,"I would most certainly use some sort of program to create a mailing list and print your envelopes. I believe that there is some sort of functionality in Microsoft Word and Outlook to do so, especially if you already have those addresses in a contact list. It should be as simple as formulating the list, loading the envelopes into your printer, and clicking ""print."""
Ebay,3dd3xo,tpeiyn,3,Wed Jul 15 15:15:41 2015 UTC,"This is called a Mail Merge - figured having the right name would help finding it in the help of whatever program is being used. Microsoft word has the option.   My recommendation (as someone who used to do LOTS of these at work) is to set it up to print on labels, and when you are ready to print, print the file as a PDF. This lets you look the file over to make sure things turned out the way you expected them to. Then print one page on regular paper and hold up against the label sheet to make sure things line up. Once everything looks good, print those labels and get sticking. Sure, it's a little less work to print directly on the envelopes, but unless your printer handles envelopes really well (in which case go for it) you'll have a hell of a time with paperjams and unjamming those envelopes. If you're paying per 'click' on your printer too, rather than by toner used (some busiinesses have a contract of sorts that does that) you'll be paying for way fewer clicks by printing label sheets too."
Ebay,3dd3xo,PasgettiMonster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:57:38 2015 UTC,There most certainly is. Haven't used it in quite a while but had to do regular mailings for work a while back and we always imported a mailing list from Excel into Word and printed the labels en mass.
Ebay,3dd3xo,Hebetude,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:54:27 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone! Thanks for helping. I figured out the best way for now. There is actually a way of printing the labels straight from Amazon. Once you have the pdf for each customer, the only thing left to do is print them out with a large label printer - I have dymo 4XL. Will definitely look into Royal Mail business account in the future."
Ebay,3da9zr,PlanetSmasher666,8,Tue Jul 14 18:46:01 2015 UTC,You should be able to dispute it.
Ebay,3da9zr,kriegers-clone,5,Tue Jul 14 18:50:37 2015 UTC,"You can't leave them negative feedback and even if you could how does that help? You can dispute it, and may win. I just had feedback removed for the same. You can also just talk to the buyer and tell them that you shipped out the same day and USPS just took a long time to deliver it and ask if they would remove the feedback."
Ebay,3da9zr,ihaveb4lls,-6,Tue Jul 14 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"Why  can't I? I am being blamed for the USPS's screw up, I shipped same day, I followed all the requirements and now my perfect seller rating is screwed up. I took the high road and messaged them about it. If they don't respond I will dispute it and see what happens."
Ebay,3da9zr,ihaveb4lls,11,Tue Jul 14 19:20:45 2015 UTC,There is no option to leave buyers negative feedback... Only positive.
Ebay,3da9zr,Bearcat26,-5,Tue Jul 14 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"I never noticed that, that's bogus. Well, if they don't remove the bad feedback I'll have to report them."
Ebay,3da9zr,NEHOG,7,Tue Jul 14 19:24:50 2015 UTC,You are the exact reason why ebay got rid of negative feedback for buyers. Though I understand you are upset and negative feedbacks a are never fun. The buyer doesn't deserve a negative.  As long as he has paid and provided an address he is done. He didn't decide how to ship the item he didn't right descriptions of the product or (usually) choose that particular shipping.   Do call ebay but go in with a level head knowing that ebay looks at feedback as an opinion and just because you don't agree with the buyers doesn't mean it can be taken down. You can always report them and I highly suggest doing that as well.
Ebay,3da9zr,Bearcat26,3,Tue Jul 14 20:31:08 2015 UTC,"He didn't decide how to ship the item he didn't right descriptions of the product or (usually) choose that particular shipping.    Generally a buyer is presented choices for shipping.   The problem this seller has is that the package arrived within the date range provided by eBay, but he still got a negative and a 'ding' for having done nothing wrong."
Ebay,3da9zr,RobertTheSpruce,0,Wed Jul 15 00:12:44 2015 UTC,I agree generally you are given options but not always.   Also in what line of business do you ever know how the buyer/customer is going to behave until you have some sort of transaction with them.   You don't know if that person will be pleasant or try to shoplift from you. The point is that the world doesn't work with businesses reviewing customers it's the exact opposite. I agree that it isn't a fair feedback and hope seller can find resolution with what's happening. But never does a case described as this fall back on being the buyers fault. It's simply a buyers opinion of his business that it was upsetting to see the package took 9 days to arrive.
Ebay,3da9zr,kool_moe_b,6,Wed Jul 15 01:24:59 2015 UTC,Buyers that are unreasonable about shipping time of course deserve negative feedback and it's a tragedy that they can't be given it in order to warn other sellers about them.
Ebay,3da9zr,hkq,4,Tue Jul 14 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree. This buyer left an unwarranted neg, which affects the seller's future business. If ebay still allowed negative feedback for buyers, this would be an instance where it would be justifiable. Other sellers need to be made aware of bad buyers just as bad sellers need to be exposed to the community.  As far as reporting this buyer goes, I don't see how the buyer's actions fall Into any of the categories for reporting (made unreasonable demands, abused buyer protection, etc)."
Ebay,3da9zr,NormThaPenguine,2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"made unreasonable demands,   I would think wanting an item faster than the agreed shipping time would fall under that."

Think about the last part of that. The buyer isn't required, and probably not thinks you're a dick for asking them to change their feedback lol."
Ebay,3da9zr,NEHOG,0,Wed Jul 15 10:37:38 2015 UTC,Never asked to change feedback. Just asked them why they gave me negative feedback due to the USPS screwing up.

Ebay,3da9zr,NEHOG,7,Wed Jul 15 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yes dispute it with eBay, in fact media mail should have no estimated delivery date as it is not handled that way. Media mail goes space available and when eBay (who forces you to use it) says there is a delivery date, they're being ass-holes."
Ebay,3da9zr,kool_moe_b,0,Tue Jul 14 19:19:42 2015 UTC,Ebay forces sellers to use media mail? Under which conditions?
Ebay,3da9zr,Ineeditunesalot,3,Tue Jul 14 23:12:43 2015 UTC,"I believe books is one category. There was a big stink about this a few years ago, because media mail was really bad at the time.   Edit: maybe part of their 'maximum shipping cost program' which limited shipping costs."
Ebay,3da9zr,NormThaPenguine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:08:21 2015 UTC,"Media is not our niche, so I've never come across this. Does ebay somehow force all books to be sent via media mail? Or is it more along the lines of you can't possibly compete on price unless you use media mail?"
Ebay,3da9zr,bobbaphet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:24:36 2015 UTC,No lol EBay can't force you to use media mail. It is however way cheaper but that guy is wrong.

It is my understanding that unless they make changes to your account there is no record of the call. If you did everything correct the neg will be taken off because it mentions shipping. If he just gave you a neg because he said you suck then you would be stuck with it, but neg for shipping is the same as lying.   Good luck and let me know how it turns out."

Ebay,3db331,RoboConducto,4,Tue Jul 14 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"This is the way it works.  Say there is an item at $10 and you make a mid of $100.  It doesn't jump to $100 rather to slightly over the amount of the second highest bidder.  So say the items shows $10, but the first person entered a max bid of $50.  You come along and bid $100, the item is now at $51 dollars.  The price going up just means that other bidders are bidding, but still less than the $100 dollars you bid."
Ebay,3db331,Slicktorine,2,Tue Jul 14 22:14:24 2015 UTC,Weird.  So I'll be fine with my high bid till they catch up or don't at all
Ebay,3db331,Pokabu,2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:24 2015 UTC,"Yes. Basically if you win you pay what the lower bid was that lost to you. In this person's scenario of your max bid being $100, if the other bidders went up to say $85, you will only have to pay $85.   However I think that if people stop bidding at a certain amount you may be accountable to pay a bit more if your max bid created a huge gap. Again I'm not certain on that last part, but it's better to be prepared in case :)"
Ebay,3db331,Griffin-dork,2,Wed Jul 15 04:50:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, its a bidding system that is the second highest bidder + 1 basically."

Ebay,3dbzcf,redslaundry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:37:59 2015 UTC,Don't worry! Sometimes the post office doesn't scan it right away! You get lazy mail people or just someone who might have missed scanning it at that time.  The only time it becomes worrisome is when it hasn't been scanned for over a week. In this case it's best to call the PO to see if they can find it. It rarely happens though.  But to simply answer your question. Yes it is normal. Give it at least 24-48 hours. I'm pretty sure it states somewhere that scan updates don't always happen immediately:)
Ebay,3dbzcf,Pokabu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:00:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys, I really like eBay. I don't know if i'm allowed to do this but I have another question. I sold a iPod Touch 5th Gen 32GB, I plan to put insurance and tracking, is that enough to fend off anyone who plans to try to scam me? Also I plan to get a USPS flat rate box (small) put the ipod into a yellow padded envelope. Line the bottom of the box with newspaper, put the yellow envelope, then put more newspaper. Is that good enough for the insurance to pay out if anything goes wrong?"
Ebay,3dbzcf,StanS2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"is that enough to fend off anyone who plans to try to scam me?    Nope, sorry. The buyer can always claim that you sent a brick instead of an iPod. Things will go downhill (for you) from there."

When I went back to college to upgrade my degree, I was full time and sold on eBay part time. The money wasn't great, just like the part time job I had when I went to college the first time. But it helped with the bills (both times).   Over in /r/flipping you will find a lot of good information. Just stay focused on 1) not being scammed into some get rich quick scheme and 2) eBay will become a high priority when you make a sale. Just a couple days ago a person placed a post here about being in school full time, working part time, and then they placed their eBay shipping on the back burner... they won't be on eBay for long.   What you should have done was hit the garage sales over the summer and sell through the year. Summer is a great time to buy winter items, provided you have the space.   But let's also be honest, you might make more money at a regular part time job too. So don't loose sight of what is most important... if you dig in deep with eBay, you won't have time to party!

Ebay,3dcnso,Griffin-dork,0,Wed Jul 15 07:06:37 2015 UTC,"In eBay extortion policy, threats pertaining to forcing a return, partial refund or anything outside the goods and services provided by ebay are considered to be against policy:  http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/feedback-extortion.html  I mentioned the feedback reflecting my experience with the seller, which is true in all cases of feedback. Communication is a star rating that you give out in a feedback.  In this case the policy is being used as a blanket clause and is effectively so subjective it is being used incorrectly.

You mention ""I am going to leave a yelp review based on my experience"", you are already trying to extort them for ""special treatment"" to get what you want, trying to twist their arm.

Ebay,3d9vqe,NEHOG,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"Alright, I didn't want to mess anything up by keeping the item. I mean, it's pretty much a useless motherboard but wanted to make sure if the case closed meant that it's done. Thanks."
Ebay,3d9qtc,LarsonLE,2,Tue Jul 14 16:35:30 2015 UTC,USPS Priority International does not offer tracking to all countries. Search USPS Edelcon for a list.
Ebay,3d9qtc,JohnFromTSB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:38:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. Looking into it at the moment.
Ebay,3d9qtc,JohnFromTSB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:06:43 2015 UTC,USPS Edelcon offers delivery confirmation as long as the package is Priority International. The USPS does offer delivery confirmation to even more countries with a Medium Flat Rate box and up. I haven't been able to find this list though. You would need to check country by country with the Post Office.
Ebay,3d9qtc,NEHOG,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:13:47 2015 UTC,You may want to check which countries have compatible tracking. Then check which countries are supported by GPS. I suspect you'll find a 1:1 match.
Ebay,3d9qtc,Pteromys44,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:48:01 2015 UTC,"Because of GSP, I now consider any foreign eBay sale to be high risk. I no longer sell on eBay outside of the US, not worth it"
