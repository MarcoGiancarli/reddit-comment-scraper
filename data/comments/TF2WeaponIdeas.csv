Lower the pellet penalty as well, it's crippling AF.  Another thing i don't understand is what's the problem with engie? You can't haul while carrying it? That's it? Did you know that short circuit and rescue ranger have alt fire as well?  But please for the love of saxton, stop trying to make multiclass shotguns a thing. Look at how horribly it ended the last time. Settle for one or two classes and do something of quality instead of throwing stats around."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3e4ko4,EpicLegendX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:08 2015 UTC,The - 20% damage is a bit hard imo. Maybe if you boost the accuracy (since it is a laser afterall) by a bit would balance it out
TF2WeaponIdeas,3e4ko4,cye604,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"The ""No crits or minicrits from outside sources"" stat seems to make this weapon a bit underpowered. Pyros with the Phlogistinator get not only over 5 seconds of crits, but also get full health after activating. Kritzkrieg Medics and Buff Banner Soldiers are still able to affect these pyros, so the Heavy should be able to get crits from outside sources as well."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3e2vj0,silver_nuke13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know how useful the shoes will be because the sniper cannot scope in or fire his bow while airborne. His class does not really benefit from speed, either. This would be a lot more useful if you were solo-ing jarate and bushwacker, but it takes up the secondary slot.  However, the temple dwellar is a really good idea for a more support oriented sniper. He can shut down areas and cause players to be marked for death. however, a better rework would be this-  -Players cannot be trapped in it, but are only slightly slower.  -The temple is larger but does not have collision regardless of team. To visualize this better, imagine a big circle surrounded by sticks topped with team colored feathers.  This gives sniper an entirely different role; area denial. Sniper is mostly a class used to just pick medics or slower classes, but this helps him disable the enemy at chokepoints and even control points beyond what jarate could do."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3e2vj0,Diva_Dan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:28 2015 UTC,I don't think you got the idea of the weapon. It's about using the shoes mobility to find and create cool sniping areas. Think of it as the Girder from worms.

The Utilitarian: Instant cloak after a backstab isn't worth not being able to decloak and not having the damage resist. Really weak and its stats counter itself with the reduced damage resist.  Clockwork Chronograph: How big is the move speed buff? I don't want spies just mashing the cloak button to catch up to scouts.

TF2WeaponIdeas,3dto58,cye604,3,Mon Jul 20 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"It is basically supposed to be sticky bomb launcher meets sapper, so yes, you can have multiple activated at once."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3dto58,secondgenesis,0,Mon Jul 20 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"Every spy will start using this just so he can place the sapper, get the engie to chase him, and destroy the buildings while they fight when the engie is far enough away. It will really force the engie to turtle and have a pyro constantly around the nest because the damage control strategy won't work anymore. Not sure if that kind of gameplay is good for TF2 or not. Interesting idea, though."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3dto58,secondgenesis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"That's the thing about this weapon.  It is very effective at quickly putting absent or distracted engineers out of commission, but if you're paying attention at all, you have an extra 3 seconds to react before your buildings are even hurting.  Turtle engineers would be able to solve this problem without too much trouble, your concern is with battle engineers.  When an engineer is more relaxed, sappers are a huge problem in the vanilla game anyway.  I can't tell you how many times my stuff has been heavily damaged or destroyed because I was even the slightest distance away.  And with a battle engineer, they aren't watching their stuff anyway, and they are usually using minisentries, which aren't a huge liability.  Due to the nature of this weapon, team engineering is also rewarded.  Because buildings are not disabled upon applying the sapper, spy would have to keep his disguise on until he reached a safe distance.  This totally eliminates the viability of backstab, then sap. you would have to sap, distract the engy before he notices the giant sapper stuck to his machine, and then activate the sapper.  This sapper revolves around timing and tact.  That said, I was thinking about two possible statistics to make this a little easier to counter.  (one, the other, or both)   The sapper makes a quiet beeping noise when armed/arming The sapper is reduced to 1 health when activated   Tell me what you think, does it need one of these changes?"
TF2WeaponIdeas,3dto58,HabberTMancer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:09:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty balanced as it is as long as there would be some kind of audio/visual feedback if an engineer has removed a sapper that hadn't activated yet. Maybe it should have a downside of not disabling the buildings while it damages them since it's more about lone wolf destruction than coordinated disabling. I do think we'll see many more turtling engies as a result, though. It used to be OK to leave your nest for a few seconds to help a fellow engineer or get more metal from spawn, for instance. Maybe not anymore."

The Useful Medi-gun: I really like being able to transfer pickups to your buddies, but as we've seen even having a weaker uber sets up a medigun for failure, so no uber at all is really underpowered.  Tactical Medic: Also a neat idea. Reduced overheal and overheal rate keeps the medic and his heal target killable. I approve of this one even if it will make every sniper on the planet angry. Actually that could be cool, maybe reduced max health to 125 while using this? You can get buffed to over 150 just for healing people so I think reduced overall HP is fair.  The Over-Healer: Not again... While the secondary effects of this medigun are again nifty, max overheal increases are not a thing that should be in the game, doubly so now that heavies can get damage resistances just for spinning up. When people balance overheal with slower heal rate it just encourages pocketing."

This seems like it would be a worthy side grade on Heavy with the versatility on the Sandvich and all, but for the other classes I'm not so sure. Would Engie get more ammo through Sentry damage? If not then I'd honestly be fine with it. And in general, is it 100 damage per enemy that'd give you an extra shot? Or is it just flat out 100 damage done?  But for Pyro and Soldier... it feels a bit too strong for them, honestly. Because you deal so much burst damage as Soldier, you can easily load up enough shots to get you out of a really tight spot without much penalty, it seems. I could say the same for Pyro, especially with the Degreaser. You're going to be in people's faces anyway.  Maybe an Accuracy/Fire Rate Penalty?"

I would really appreciate your input on how to make this a weapon that could actually be used in game. Basically I just want a cool cowboy revolver for the engineer, so I'm not entirely sure if this should go to the spy too, or not. With some tweaking, I think this could be a really fun/interesting weapon  Edit: Changed Fires as fast as you can click to 20% faster firing speed, making it fire slightly faster than the stock pistol and preventing script abuse. Changed cannot receive ammo from dispenser while active to 20% slower weapons switch when switching away. Both should make for a more balanced weapon. Thanks for the advice!  Edit 2: Realized that I messed up the new firing speed thing. I switched it back to fire as fast as you can click until I can redo some math here, so that anyone checking this out can get a better sense of what this weapon is supposed to do.

As for your scenario, the 10% extra speed wouldn't make a major difference if a scout is chasing you. You should pop the kritz if you have a teammate near to deal with the scout and his allies.

TF2WeaponIdeas,3dcvgg,Grunlag-RAZ,3,Wed Jul 15 07:31:37 2015 UTC,"Nah, at the moment there is no need to fix up the Vita Saw. The addition of Medigun drops extremely nerfed this weapon (assuming your team can hold ground long enough for you to pick up the Medigun you dropped). Dying in a bad position as a Medic influences whether or not you want to use the Vita Saw now. You can either chose to use the Vita Saw to make up for bad position (but making the enemy capable of picking up your Uber, but you are guaranteed some of it back). Or you can keep the extra health for your better positioning and never die in a bad position. The new system rewards good game sense and good positioning.  Valve added something that changed how matches worked in comp for the better. If the comp leagues want to knee-jerk ban picking up Mediguns that's their fault. Not Valve. Trying to rebalance TF2 weapons specifically for 6s and HL doesn't work, and if you don't believe this statement just look at what Valve did to the poor Vaccinator.    Edit: Also   and praise it as the new meta in MVM.   You literally cannot pick up dropped weapons in MvM. They don't even get dropped on the ground. Please read patch notes. And MvM is entirely revolving around Ubers, yet a single Uber there is not as emphasized as much as in 6s or HL."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3dcvgg,Meanderingstories,2,Wed Jul 15 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised people didn't get how the vita-saw worked. Also, good luck getting that 20% exactly stored - I've used it extensively and it caps at 19% about 99% of the time.  Either way, it's not too bad atm anyway (it goes very well with the quick-fix for borderline non-stop powerful ubers) and it works how it works because it is a reference to Bioshock.  I'm not sure why valve added it but I think it was a labour of love on one of the TF2 team's part for the Bioshock franchise. This is also probably why it has never been changed - despite the fact that it is considered a bad weapon in pubs but also not allowed in comp. Whoever added it loves it as it is and they work at valve so they get to decide haha.  Your idea is valid and quite good considering the gun mettle changes but, as has already been said here by /u/SileAnimus , it already has a role that people are happy with regarding positioning and ease of getting your uber back.  Shortly after the gun mettle update I actually thought that using the vitasaw would deplete the uber on a dropped medi-gun by 20 actually: https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3c6uuw/if_mediguns_now_retain_uber_levels_when_the_medic/"

Therefore, landing on your enemies heads would be viable.   You rocket jump(with reduced self damage), shoot a rocket at them midair, then land on them. Rocket deals 100 damage, your mantreads deal 60 damage. Congratulations, you can kill 5 classes at full health and severely maim the rest. Besides, if you are on a map with major elevation changes, like badwater second, you might be able to even get over 100 damage dealt on an enemy from stomping.  Your stomping ability seems interesting, but I'd like to leave it out. I do think this would be a viable shotgun sidegrade without the weighdown ability like you suggested.

However everything else just makes it a crap weapon.   3rd just seems annoying to play with. Against would be easy enough, but playing with it is just annoying.  Nobody but newbies sets traps exclusively. Demo is, despite what the devs thinks, a offensive class. Longer arm time is going to make the weapon bad. Traps is just a very boring play-style."

The first is more like a Detonator with features of the Beggars. I have yet to hear someone complain about the Detonator.   2nd: If the second one simply trade off Damage for Speed that would be rather dull. And as shown by the Family Business, Shortstop, and Force a Nature, people prefer to hit slower for more damage. Also, the Quickiebomb Launcher already does that.  3rd: You could easily use it for firing stickies like the SBL as much as with traps. Think about it: Firing two stickies per pop (think of doing this over the barriers on viaduct mid) could overall be faster than the stock due to the stickies immediately arming when in range of another. Paired up with the lower self damage you have more mobility.   The only one here that would be specifically useful for traps would be the 2nd one (and even then it could make for powerful bombs). The other two are more useful on the offensive rather than defensive. They merely require a different midset to use when compared to stock.

TF2WeaponIdeas,3d6a5e,Meanderingstories,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need one, it's just an idea that I'm attempting to balance out. I may add another downside, such as it having a shorter duration, or not being able to use it until the cloak bar is full. I even considered not being able to see anything you can't interact with, or there being monsters in the other plane of existence that can hurt you while you're cloaked, but I figured these would be harder to implement."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3d6a5e,derborgus3333,2,Mon Jul 13 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"I think that would be interesting. If the spy was astrally projecting then he wouldn't be able to see/ interact with the world so it makes sense thematically. I'd add the ""enemies are not visible to you either"" stat.  It also adds a risk to using the watch as you may decloak right in front of an enemy group you can't see. This would encourage the user to communicate with his team (to check if he can decloak safely where he is) or to have good gamesense e.g. knowing where to decloak so the spy won't get spotted."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3d6gqt,WheatleyIsDaBest,3,Mon Jul 13 22:09:12 2015 UTC,Does this replace the sentry? I feel it can't be worth losing the sentry for this. Perhaps remove the Can't be moved aspect as that seems unnecessary.  Weapons should also have a slightly higher accuracy for stuff like this when mounted: bipod stabilisation can be really improve any weapons recoil handling and therefore accuracy.

On a weapon with no clip, an action can be put on the reload key, if necessary, but you've still got one too many."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3d4piz,WheatleyIsDaBest,3,Mon Jul 13 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"I like it, because it fits soldier, but throwing out your ammo is a big sacrifice as a beggar soldier."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3d4piz,maximal881,2,Mon Jul 13 20:21:20 2015 UTC,It's not a terrible idea (although similar to one of mine) but I can't help but feel most Soldier mains aren't willing to sacrifice primary weapon ammo for this.   I also feel - like my idea - that it may not be able to compete with the gunboats/shotgun in terms of players wanting to use it.

The Knife-Gun could possibly give the Spy a stock Revolver to use with whatever knife has been placed in his melee slot.  This way, the cloak device could possibly be avaliable when the disguise kit or sapper are out.  As an alternative, The Knife-Gun could be a cloak device replacement.  This might make more sense as it completely disables cloak.  This way, you can use whatever revolver you like with whatever knife you like."

On a more related front, I think that this could be interesting, but I don't think that some of these shotguns would really fit scout's style, mainly the default shotgun.  These weapons just don't seem powerful enough to be a primary, the only class that wields these shotguns as a primary is engineer, and he has sentries to help him out.  I also believe that they don't quite fit scout's visual style either (very short, broad shotguns).  Maybe some of these ideas could be applied to new scatterguns, however."

The longer reload time isn't all that significant when you consider the fact that five perfectly accurate bullets are much more potent than an even an infinite clip of the Revolver's less-accurate bullets from after the first shot, and the fact that you can reload while invisible just lessens the effectiveness of that downside even further. The Spy's primaries lose accuracy after the opening shot for a good reason."

As for the rest of the idea, it could encourage spam and all that, and the downside makes it quite unviable. The extra knockback should give more mobility, right?   BUBBLY BOUNDER   Ok this one i like. Airblast jumping. Instead of nerfing the range and the refire rate, you could just make it not deal minicrits on reflects, have less afterburn etc. I feel like the extra ammo is also unnecessary.

Twice the speed of a crossbow would mean this would be the fastest projectile in the game. I'm pretty sure the crossbow speed is enough.

Bubbly Bounder: I like it, but I think that that's more of the Detonator's job. Once they un-nerf the Detonator (Why did they nerf it in the first place? Nobody even used the thing besides Sketchek) Pyros will be set for mobility again.  Digital Demolisher: That's a great idea! I think that you've given me an idea, actually... I'll put up a link to it and give credit to you when I'm done with the post.  Brute's Ballista: That's an absolutely amazing idea! How do you come up with this stuff? That's just great! :D  Agrandizer: Very overcomplicated. IMO, if anyone gets a Mech suit, it should only be the Engineer. I've been working on a Mech idea for Engie for a while now, but almost scrapped it... This is TF2, not Titanfall. Maybe I will post a mech suit idea.  Sharpshooter's Salvo: Bleh. I've seen 5 ideas just like this, and liked none of them.  Blink: What? Another teleportation device for Spy? That's Engie's gimmick! Once again, I've seen 3-9 ideas for this, and I don't like any of them.  Overall you've got a whole lot of good ideas in there! The weapons for Pyro, Sniper, Spy, and Engie, I've seen a million times, but your original ideas more than make up for it! Soon enough I'll post something about a Titanfall suit for Engie, and a bowling ball for... I don't know who I'll give it to. Maybe multiple classes! I'll give you credit for inspiring me.

Neat though.  Digital Demolisher: Fun, unique, balanced. This is what all weapon ideas aspire to be. Good work. The reduced projectile speed would make it really easy to avoid though.  Brute's Ballista: A slow firing weapon on the heavy? I'll bite. Even then I'm really not a fan of giving the heavy a giant medic crossbow, he shouldn't have that kind of range or damage on such a fast projectile.  Agrandizer: This weapon is too confusing for new players. Actually, anyone. Even then engineer shouldn't be able to upgrade his allies like that. Kind of medic's job don't you think?  Sharpshooter Salvo: I have some problems with giving the sniper a burst fire rifle as his primary, but this one doesn't seem so bad. max 300 damage per burst is still enough I'd rather use a huntsman though.

TF2WeaponIdeas,3cstu6,TNTyoshi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"it's a decent idea, but a mini-crit is only 42-62 damage, which is about the same damage as your stock revolver anyway. With the 6 seconds of bleed, it's a good 90-110 damage, which isn't nearly enough to kill anyone, and could be dealt with the revolver faster. A full crit may be a better choice, otherwise this thing is only good at picking off weak targets, which the revolvers have no trouble doing in the first place.  I'm not quite sure how i'd fix this. More damage, perhaps? Maybe throwing the knife doesn't break disguise, but plays a unique animation similar to the sapper?"
TF2WeaponIdeas,3cstu6,PixelLexi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:41:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! Yeah I hear you, and agree with you on how the revolver might make it redundant. Personally though, I don't think the solution should be that throwing it doesn't break disguise. Personally never been a fan of the concept of dealing damage and keeping your disguise (exception being the Y.E.R), especially with the recent Enforcer change. But, I do think the ""full crit"" idea is more effective, what do you think about if it is...  -Deals 20% less damage  So base damage would be 32  Thrown Knifes deal mini crit damage  So if it hits targets from anywhere it deals 37 to 50 damage? (My Math may be wrong)  Deals Crits to targets and makes them bleed for 6 seconds when thrown at their backs  Making the crits deal 96, with bleed damage doing an additional 48 damage. Bringing about a total of 144 damage.  Would this change be to much or is this plausible when considering spy has a revolver?"
TF2WeaponIdeas,3cstu6,PixelLexi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"This makes it pretty damn plausible. 96 damage is enough to kill most classes if weakened, and the extra bleed will whittle down the more powerful ones. This setup seems more like a complement to the revolver, where you hit someone silently with your knife at a distance, then hit them with a shot or two to finish them off... Or just take out that pesky medic that your scout got a good meatshot on before getting mowed down by his pocket."

The loch and load today is...+20% Damage to Buildings  Seeing is that the D-Sentry is the same health as the sentry A.K.A. 175 Health. So meaning, a d-sentry can be 2 shotted by the LnL.  I'd also rather use a seperate dispenser and sentry imho. Its easier to RR them because of the sheer easyness of it. Changes:  Change the D-Sentry's health.

TF2WeaponIdeas,3cgc5n,MovkeyB,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:24:51 2015 UTC,"In the other thread people said it would be OP (and they may be right). The thing, is you do not have to be around as medic when the patient profits from the immunity (he can jump away or go flank the enemy without you, having the immunity on him when he needs it).  It's a significantly different thing, but you are right in that no good timing is needed (not on a scale of fractions of seconds at least)."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3cgc5n,xAlfafllfflx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:03:59 2015 UTC,"I disagree.   You still have to deploy your charges manually. It has to be the right damage type. If you do it way too early, the charge will be triggered by some random spam before it's useful.   Also, given the immunity lasts only 2.5 seconds I think it's important that the patient knows about it ahead of time. Currently it's like: “Oh, a charge was popped on me, what do I oh it's over.”  I always found the vaccinator to be super awkward both as medic and as patient since it's so hard to sync (I play pubs without voice communication though). Well, maybe they intentionally nerfed it to uselessness because to found no way to make it fun and balanced."

The Ruler's Ruler: What is defined as attacking? I think it's a bit underpowered. A melee weapon with that much vulnerability is GOING to get you killed.  The Peacekeeper: Also seems a tad underpowered. On the topic, I'd really like to see a demo launcher that deals extra damage with rollers.  The Battering Ram: A targe with bullet resistance? With the normal targe, bullet is the most commong damage type. Having their only weakness be other demos and soldiers doesn't really sit well with me. Would also be too good on a half demoknight set with nade launcher and eyelander, stopping you from getting quickscoped.  Bobby's Baton This weapon sounds a lot cooler on pyro actually, since a lot of enemies would be running back to health packs after getting lit on fire. I fear full crits is a bit much though, give it a 25% damage penalty, instead of switch penalty."

You could mow down a heavy with this. I am so sick of melee weapons with damage penalties, you aren't going to use the default axe/bottle anyway, it needs a passive downside to actually matter, and switch time is important as a pyro/half demoknight. You are right, the battering ram is op, let me change it.  EDIT holding down M1 is a better definition for attacking."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3c7d1i,ryanfranke,2,Sun Jul 5 19:50:50 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting idea. It gives the spy another chance if they mess up in a way. I know I sometimes miss a backstab next to a sentry or something and this can be useful. But I do have some issues with it:   1.) Does this make the spy 'too difficult to kill'? Imagine a comp-level player using this. They would be able to undo any damage received, and if you don't kill them right away, they can just disappear back 5 seconds ago and try again.  2.) Should there be a downside for a cooldown on top of the recharge? What would happen if you recharge it fully within 5 seconds of using it? would it undo the first teleport?  3.) Using this will undo damage done and ammo spent, but not for the guy you're attacking. I think it may be a problem where I can use the diamondback to use my crit shots to kill or would players, and rewind to get the crits back to take out more players. If I make sure I stay in a fight for less than 5 seconds, I shouldn't be able to lose any ammo or health.  Don't get me wrong, I do like this idea a lot. I think it needs some more work to make sure the weapon is fun to use and fun to fight against. While this may be against the concept of the weapon idea, I might recommend losing the 'keep the same health, ammo, and status as 5 seconds ago'. Using this as a ""teleport rather than cloak"" watch by itself can be useful as a quick getaway. It can also be use to teleport behind guys chasing after you as well."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3c7but,Clueless_Hands,5,Sun Jul 5 15:44:11 2015 UTC,Do you want to know what kills a player faster than 6 seconds?  A backstab.

Example: An engi is sustaining Heavy fire from soldiers. The spy comes and stabs him. The engi has the choice of searching the spy to prevent his own death or die after 6 seconds of slapping his sentry. Maybe if the delay was smaller, this could distract people easier."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3c302a,SileAnimus,2,Sat Jul 4 12:24:31 2015 UTC,When playing as Scout I've been known to take out Heavies...  A Scout should not be able to overpower Heavies.

TF2WeaponIdeas,3c1ksn,Clueless_Hands,2,Fri Jul 3 22:32:40 2015 UTC,"First of all, if the Quick-Fix taught us anything, being unable to overheal is a massive penalty almost impossible to overcome for a medigun. And your mechanic seems to be a more situationally dependant version of the overheal.  Second, the insanely slow uber rate means it will never be used in comp play because uberadvantage is very important there.  Third, the functionality is complicated, the beauty of being a medic is taking a (at first sight) simple mechanic (point and shoot at target to heal) and do it so well you outclass others. This design however is dependant on too many variables. Multiple people will feel forced to stay with you, balling up will become a problem.  If the targets you were healing suddenly left, you're left with nothing, that kinda sucks. Also the lack of crit heals (which is a core mechanic) is too alien.  tl;dr: Too complicated, lacks too many of the core aspects of a medigun."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3c1ksn,Deadonstick,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:39:25 2015 UTC,"The idea is medic is not a pocket with this, just latch on and fight with melee or primary and heal that way. OVerheal is remove because of bonus maximum health.  This a battle medic not a pocket."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3c32fm,SinisterPixel,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:31:34 2015 UTC,"I don't entirely believe so, the main problem with the concept of this weapon is that it heavily encourages balling, which is going to have bigger disadvantages than advantages."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3bx8yk,epicawesomeness5,2,Thu Jul 2 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"yeah we get this one pretty often. i think it could be balanced if you add some minuses:  Once a building has been fully downgraded, it must be fully upgraded before use.  Traitor buildings can not be repaired, destructed, fed ammo or moved.  Traitor sentries can not be wrangled.  Traitor dispensers can not heal allies  Traitor teleporters have their exits reversed and teleport at the rate of a level 1  Basically, the first stat says that the building has to take the full time to shrinks to level 0 (red tape recorder time), and then another interval of that time to build back up. So it takes twice as long as the rtr to take over a building. Seems fair, its very hard to keep a building from being saved by an engi for that long.  The second stat says that when you make a building traitorous, it can't be repaired, destroyed via pda, given more ammo if its a sentry, or moved, by ally engies. This way you avoid an engi having essentially 2 of each building, since eventually they will die.  The third stat says that traitor sentries must be on auto-pilot. Along with the fact that they cant give ammo means than eventually they just become roadblocks that cant fire. Roadblocks can still be helpful, though.  The fourth stat says that traitor dispensers can not heal. The complex healing mechanisms are broken when a dispenser is sapped, but the mercs can always punch one and use the metal that falls out for ammo.  Lastly, traitor teleporters have their entrance and exit swapped to be more useful, but can only teleport at the rate of a level 1 teleporter. They still have the health of their level, though."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bx8yk,djloreddit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:32:45 2015 UTC,"How about the firing speed when it turns is reduced? I can imagine an engineer building in front of the spawn and waiting for a spy to sap the shit out of it.   Also, what about it still damages, but it damages itself? So basically the sapper and sentry still works but it slowly damages itself?"
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bwwha,epicawesomeness5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting concept, but the source engine is already nearly crashing from entity overload. Adding another spy with a weapon and up to four items attacked to the Spy would break servers.  From a technical standpoint."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3bvzsl,Patrik333,4,Thu Jul 2 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"I can see this being a serious idea actually. Two problems with it though.   The recoil mechanic makes it seem like a better force a nature. Looking at you, Soda Popper. It has a little too much DPS at short range and does literally nothing at long. I would reduce the accuracy penalty to -100% accuracy instead of -300% and give it a 40% damage penalty (which is still almost double the DPS of a scattergun)"
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bvzsl,HabberTMancer,2,Thu Jul 2 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I did think about the FaN and Soda Popper when I was writing this. The idea came to me from some thread on a physics subreddit/what-if XKCD about how rocket jumping isn't feasible because it's too instantaneous, but firing enough machineguns continuously could get you off the ground... or firing just one machine gun and being light enough...  And yeah, I try and make most of my ideas fairly balanced, but with this one I just went for ""what would happen if Scout tried firing it"" - it would still be as powerful as the Minigun, but he wouldn't be able to handle it at all... I didn't really think about how balanced it'd be.  Plus... Sneak attacks would be really hard... Heavy has the advantage that if he is caught out, he has enough health to deal with it, and also that once he's spun up he can do lots of damage... even if no one saw Scout before he spun up, he'd possibly get one kill before everyone turned around, or before he flew out of range...  The air strike idea looks really cool in my head but it would be impossible to get right in practice, especially since you'd have to guess where the enemies/walls were, or maybe flick round, staying spun up but not firing, then shoot for half a second as you pass overhead, and then flick back round again before you slow down too much..."

TF2WeaponIdeas,3bvbik,tdogredman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:21:16 2015 UTC,"Really? 20% Damage is pretty severe (unless it just means melee damage...?) but having 20% damage resistance for any length of time would be pretty awesome - I like the synergy with Eng, too.  I guess Soldier's not a high priority class to use the Tele - it'd be nicer to have this as a Medic Weapon or so (fast enough that they can reach the front line after teleporting, too...).   If you don't use melee much on Soldier (unless I'm trying to work out how to use Gardner, I barely use anything but Escape Plan) it could be a really good weapon for leading a push, or teaming up with a Medic for resist + heals.  Could be abused, too - an Eng sets up both Tele buildings in his nest, and then whenever Soldier needs the buff replenishing, he just jumps back to the nest, teleports and heals on the dispenser, and then jumps straight back out..."

The sticky launcher does the same job as the new LnL niche just fine and more. I guess shield demos may get some use from it but other wise.... Personally I would have been fine with a lower fire rate instead.  Gunslinger... well, the way you should play it (or should have played it as the case is now) was  just more open to different playstyles. The nerf mostly makes you more passive, It's still quite usable but just not quite as viable in as many situations. As you stated though jagging lvl 1 sentries goes up in the exact same time ( I think) as an unpunched mini now so.... the main difference will be metal cost and time investment. Punched minis deploy even faster than before the nerf now though so if you if you have your team backing you you can still play fairly aggressively. Anyways, yeah it sucks that it's locked into a more passive playstyle but the engie himself got buffs that make it so he can be more aggressive at the same time so... direct combat engie will just need to be figured out  again (at least for mini users, as I have seen some pretty aggressive stock gameplay)."

I dunno. I'm not quite sure when it woudl be usefull, on a practical basis. (still prefering mini-crits or speedboost when making a push)  hmmm ... I was thinking, how funny it would be if it actually created a sort of supply drop. when you blow the horn, instead of an aura, a lvl 1 dispenser drops right in front of you (for instance, stocked half, can't be healed, and only 25% life), or like, 5 small ammo packs and 5 small health packs"

TF2WeaponIdeas,3bt64q,alfredjoeface,2,Wed Jul 1 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"I had a spy idea that was basically the same, but the invis watch idea seems just annoying to use :("
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bsvu6,alfredjoeface,3,Wed Jul 1 21:43:27 2015 UTC,"Wowowow. Let me stop you right there. I love the idea of the first item. I LOVE IT. But 4 deg is too much, and based on distance kinda sucks since the accuracy is bad. You'll need to think that a bit more. Is the damage on individual projectiles the same as the crossbow too? Can you kill a scout at point blank with one shot?"
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bsvu6,silver_nuke13,2,Wed Jul 1 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"Edited the primary a bit, but just telling me the melee's bad doesn't tell me much about it, just your opinion."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bsvu6,silver_nuke13,2,Wed Jul 1 23:35:12 2015 UTC,"Why even add a faster swing rate, if the melee is meant for utility? It cancels out the downside, resulting in a similar DPS.   The minicrits part is extremely gimmiky and unnecessary and the part where it instantly gives uber, even if it has a cooldown, makes it broken, since it gives a huge uber advantage. Just like DDS, it forces the enemy to equip it too. What was the niche? A burst healing melee, counterpart of amputator? Then drop the healthpack crap, and make it work like disciplinary action: on hit, it heals allies. Voila. Not hard."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bsvu6,silver_nuke13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:09:04 2015 UTC,"The problem with a disciplinary action type heal means you can just stay inside someone and give them more health than your medigun would, essentially just making it a harder to aim medigun. With the healthkit, you get ranged burst healing, while not being able to spam it. I increased the cooldown and reduced the uber gain as well. The minicrits from it are meant more to give a short boost to the primary. Like a couple of other melees, (atomizer, GRU, vita-saw, etc.) the melee itself is meant as more of a utility item over a pure combat item."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bsvu6,chevron_colon_3,3,Thu Jul 2 17:09:51 2015 UTC,However the melee sucks. Bad. No.
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bt0ov,hs-paradox,4,Wed Jul 1 22:20:18 2015 UTC,"""Useful for ____ class who can't make up their mind.""  This is something that I see far too often.  You can't do this with items. Combining two items makes the original two combined items inefficient and takes away any purpose they had before.   Your idea is a less extreme example, but a good one is combining all the banners for Soldier into one single banner. If that was in game, why would anyone who uses banners NOT use the one single banner? It would completely negate any use of the other ones.  This weapon would negate the use of shotgun and flare gun, making most Pyros use this one thing. Choices are necessary in a game like this with so many items.  Also, this is a half-assed idea I've seen MANY times. Add fire, make a small damage penalty DONE! Weapon created!  No. Not how it works."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bt0ov,technicolorAPRIL,0,Thu Jul 2 01:45:17 2015 UTC,"Despite the damage penalty, it still feels much more overpowered, does more damage, compared to stock shotty. I feel that you should add a firing speed nerf or a reload and or clip size nerf."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bt0ov,DragonSlapz,2,Wed Jul 1 22:29:47 2015 UTC,"While mid to long range shots would deal more damage, close range shots would rely on your target to burn for longer than 5 seconds before reaching a health kit, friendly pyro, or medic. (Unless they have afterburn immunity). The way I see it, this weapon encourages a puff and run away tactic, as oppose to the puff and sting tactic."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bs7r2,derborgus3333,2,Wed Jul 1 18:51:10 2015 UTC,The name is a mouthful and the damage is quite low. Not that great as it is atm.   I'm not quite sure what it is for/ why it would be used? It does less damage at close range than any minigun and has no mid-long range capability. It'd be good as an ambush but it's still not as good as Tomislav. Movement speed buff is good but what's it for?
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bs7r2,Meanderingstories,2,Wed Jul 1 21:27:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I was hesitant to add more damage for the fear of making it op, but if the damage is to be cranked up, so be it.  I originally got this idea while playing as heavy, one of my teammates used the term ""steamrolling"" and I got the idea for a literal steamroller.  It is designed to quickly dismantle a group of enemy players, at the cost of long-range effectiveness."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bs7r2,Meanderingstories,2,Thu Jul 2 00:46:24 2015 UTC,"ahh, that makes sense. More damage makes sense if you give up mid-long range effectiveness."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bs7r2,Meanderingstories,2,Thu Jul 2 08:54:36 2015 UTC,I was hesitant to add more damage because this weapon is essentially a million times better than the melee now.  Can you think of anything to make it serve a distinctively different function?
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bs7r2,Meanderingstories,2,Thu Jul 2 09:48:16 2015 UTC,"Not really, it's got a role anyway and most heavy melee's are used for utility over damage anyway e.g. FoS, GRU etc"
TF2WeaponIdeas,3brsbb,Clueless_Hands,2,Wed Jul 1 17:00:35 2015 UTC,"I dunno... Using this with the Rescue Ranger would make it a bit too good, since it trivializes both downsides. Give it a different downside and you're golden."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3brsbb,HabberTMancer,2,Wed Jul 1 17:05:55 2015 UTC,Like what? I did the more metal to heal to remove camping. Any ideas?
TF2WeaponIdeas,3brsbb,HabberTMancer,2,Wed Jul 1 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"Why not -20% attack speed? Reduces DPS and tanking ability at the same time. It still combos with the rescue ranger, but it's not a direct upgrade using the RR with it anymore.   Alternatively, just make buildings have -33% healing from all sources, including allies and RR bolts and keep the marked for death."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3brsbb,Bolbi_The_Destroyer,2,Wed Jul 1 18:02:40 2015 UTC,"I liked the reduced healing idea, Thanks."
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bquux,randomsword,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:25:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty new to this but I feel this weapon doesn't have any downsides. I think it should have less reserve ammo or something.
TF2WeaponIdeas,3bquux,BjornVioarr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:26:15 2015 UTC,You mean less healing when maxed out? I halved it if that is the case.
