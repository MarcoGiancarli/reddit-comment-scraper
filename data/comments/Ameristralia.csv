Ameristralia,3dfihe,caddyhoff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:31:55 2015 UTC,"Baseball and cricket: there are three bases, two of which are scoring. Stealing to the non scoring base is acceptable. To score, the two runners must run either clockwise or counterclockwise. A run is scored when either runner touches either scoring base, and, if it is the base upon which they started, they must also touch another base.  The batter has three strikes and four balls, if the pitcher throws the ball. If he elects to bounce it,  then the batter must protect the strike zone, as a wicket. A bounced pitch need not be run on, but a thrown pitch is a forced play. Force outs and double plays exist.  The game is three innings of nine outs each side.   The field consists of an equilateral triangle on the ground 30m in length, bordered by a roughly ovate field. The two scoring bases shall be on the side of the triangle parallel to the minor axis of the oval, no more than 50 m from the nearest apex, and no less than 125m from the farthest apex.  A ball that is batted directly out of the field of play is a 6, and one that bounces is a 3.  If the pitch is thrown and does not bounce, it must be hit ""fair"", which means that it must be within the base lines of the available bases of the batter hitting.  The pitcher must deliver the pitch from anywhere in fair territory, respective to the batter, behind the base line which is farthest from the batter.  The game is forfeit if a player states, in an Australian accent, that he enjoys Foster's, or, in an American accent, that he does not understand Metric."

The bull-pup design seems to be much more finicky when it comes to loading and charging because you load the mag in at the back and then charge up front, which is opposite to most rifles that have been produced. On a personal note, I've used AR15 pattern rifles all my life, so the M4 style comes a bit easier to me. When firing though, no doubt they are similar because they use the same round .223 caliber (5.56x45 NATO) round."

Ameristralia,396knq,caddyhoff,26,Tue Jun 9 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"Down South I'd say that we have six distinct accent classes that fall into two groups, some with their own subclasses. I'll do my best to outline them here.  Group - Classes (Subclasses)  Occa - Country (Genuine, Fake), Bogan, Indigenous  Metro - East(Queensland, The Rest), West, Immigrant  Group Occa (what you hear us all sound like in movies)  Classes: Country, Bogan, Indigenous  Country is what real, genuine country people sound like, someone who grew up out in the sticks in farming or mining communities and usually still lives there. Country has two subclasses, genuine and fake. Genuine is as above, fake is hollywood's bastardised version that any aussie in a movie is forced to sound like. Both of these accents will usually be evident before the person speaks by the presence of an akubra. Crocodile Dundee and Steve Irwin are good youtube searches for these accents.  Bogan is an over the top accent caused by fucking yobbos putting way too much of a twang on everything and dragging out their words, it's painful to listen to. You can identify someone with a yobbo accent from a fair distance off, because they are usually shouting and you are wondering why your ears hurt, or their wearing a flanno shirt with smokes(""Durries"") in their top pocket and lots of tat's and/or a mullet in special cases. Has it's own very special set of slang, the largest of any subset. Just searching Bogan in youtube will give you a good idea here.  Indigenous Australian accents are an interesting take on the traditional aussie accent because they are 100% aussie, but aboriginals generally speak English as a second language (really well most of the time mind you), but it's aussie with strange inflections in slightly wrong places. When people with these accent types shout they can get a bit screechy. This accent also varies widely, so I would have two subclasses of City and Outback, with Outback being much thicker, slower and more pleasant. I have no good idea what to google for a reliable accent here, they vary too wildly - some sort of history docco would be a good bet.  Group Metro (basically if you youtube an aussie newsreader, a much more subdued accent that the majority of us have - think Rebel Wilson or Hugh Jackman)  Classes: East, West, Immigrant  East is the predominant accent in Australia, it's immediately recognisable as Australian, but not iconically so like Country is. It's softer than country, and has it's own set of slang. It tends to be fairly nasally especially among women. Subclasses here are Queensland and The Rest - Queenslandish is a touch (or a lot, depending on where you are) more Occa then The Rest. Youtube Kath and Kim (the only aussie version) for a quick primer on East coast accents.  West (is besthahaha) and is similar to East but lacking the nasally twang and at a more normal pitch relative to the Occa group. It also has it's own set of slang words that make a westerner stand out over east and vice versa. I can't think of a popular westerner youtuber for reference, sorry mate.  Immigrant is really hard to explain as it varies wildly person to person, but it's basically someone who's been in Australia for a long time, or was born here to thick accented immigrant parents, and has learnt an Aussie accent over the top of their native accent. It's usually a bastardisation, but still Aussie. Search Lebbo on youtube and I'm sure you'll find something.  I may have missed some classes, but hopefully this will suffice mate. It's been bloody tricky trying to characterise our accents into a written format!  Edit: added the Immigrant class."

There is the generic accent which you will see over almost all of Australia, then there are variants on this. Most notably: Queensland, has a much broader accent, closer to the ones that you might see in films.  South Australia has a more British accent. This is super interesting, as it is because all the other states were founded as penal colonies, but South Australia was for non convicts. Hence the different accent.   I am told that us Melbournians have a slight American (Californian) accent. However I can't hear it."

If you are none of those, you do have to take the long way  Sorry if this is a few days late, just found this subreddit!  Anyway, I literally just had this done a few week ago for my Visa application and I thought it was going to be a huge pain in the ass, but it was actually super easy and fast.  You don't need to send to the FBI directly (unless you are told specifically to do so), instead you can use an FBI Channeling service. They are approved by the FBI and the turn around for them is usually 5-7 business days instead of months. Here is more information on the immigration website (click the last link under Police Check).  I used these guys as out of the 4 approved channelers, they are the only ones who will send back your results via e-mail (if you choose, it is fast and free) and I am pretty sure none of the channlers will sent results overseas via mail.  Just go to that link and click the big CLICK HERE button, it is the form and it explains everything. Only costs $50 and got my results about two weeks after mailing everything.  As for taking your fingerprints, I really wouldn't do them at home, you can have rolled inked done for you at your nearest police station. They did mine for free (just print a few printouts of the immigration request for your background check so they know why). They wouldn't do mine on that standard FBI form as they said they have their own standard South Australian fingerprint form (they do take a lot more prints than what is asked for on the original FBI form, my entire hand was inked) and my prints were accepted just fine.  If you have any questions, seriously just ask."

The trick here was that my mum needed to register the birth of her children with the Australian government before we all became adults (I think it was before we turned 21 (Edit: looks like it's 18) but if you're in this situation do confirm with the appropriate consulate yourself).  There are actually seven of us siblings and we each invested varying amounts of energy trying to get her to sign the paperwork, so a couple of my siblings didn't actually get Aussie citizenship before mum passed away. All of those were actually Aussie residents and got it all sorted out in the end, but if you are in a dual citizenship marriage I'd urge you to do the paperwork for your kids' sake as it definitely make it easier if you do it sooner rather than later.  And be aware that if you're registering kids with the U.S. government (which I had to do as mine were born in Canada) that the Yanks will require a fair bit of supporting documentation. Because I'd lived a fair part of my life outside the U.S. I had to go back and obtain primary school records so I could show that i'd lived the required number of years in the U.S. before becoming an adult. When I did this I was quite surprised to learn that I would only be credited with nine months of ""service"" for each school year I'd spent in the U.S., as apparently I ""could have traveled to Australia each summer"" - (yeah right, I was definitely jetting around the world at the ripe old age of six).  One more wrinkle - one of the siblings who didn't get the paperwork done in time eventually became Australian through the Aussie naturalization process. When he notified the U.S. consulate of this, they actually took away his American passport, telling him that he'd abandoned his U.S. citizenship! Fortunately, after a bit of back and forth and apparently a change in U.S. law/policy, they actually returned his U.S. passport so he, too is a full blown dual citizen Ameristralian in good standing...  So, it would appear that OP needs to go down the traditional naturalization path, but for others, there's value in talking to your foreign-born parents about getting some paperwork processed..."

Mom was not interested in US citizenship, but like you, I wanted to be able to vote. I simply applied for naturalization at the beginning of my senior year of college, went through the biometrics, interview, and ceremony and that was it. Because you've held permanent residency for at least seven years, you're eligible for naturalization. Nothing happens to your Australian citizenship when you become naturalized. You're just expected to ""uphold the US Constitution"" if the US and Australia ever went to war which would never happen."

Ameristralia,36rnrl,johnau,5,Fri May 22 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"ANZUS:       The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS or ANZUS Treaty) is the 1951 Collective security agreement which binds Australia and New Zealand and, separately, Australia and the United States, to co-operate on military matters in the Pacific Ocean region, although today the treaty is taken to relate to conflicts worldwide. It provides that an armed attack on any of the three parties would be dangerous to the others, and that each should act to meet the common threat. It set up a committee of foreign ministers that can meet For consultation. The treaty was one of the series that the United States formed in the 1949-55 era as part of its collective response to the threat of communism during the Cold War.  New Zealand's protest against nuclear-armed American warships visiting New Zealand waters led to a partial suspension of the New Zealand-U.S. relationship in the mid-1980s. The issue was resolved in 2010, and the New Zealand-U.S. relationship was fully restored.

Ameristralia,36rnrl,figec,7,Thu May 21 23:28:36 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect. As of about 2002, both countries allow dual citizenship.  Here's a pointer to the Aussie government website that states this explicitly:  http://www.citizenship.gov.au/current/dual_citizenship/  And here's what they say:  ""People can become dual citizens automatically, or after being granted citizenship of another country.  For example, an Australian citizen may automatically gain citizenship of another country through marriage, while a permanent resident of Australia may become a dual citizen by becoming an Australian citizen.  Prior to 4 April 2002, Australian citizens who became citizens of another country lost their Australian citizenship automatically.""  The equivalent page on the U.S. State Department website is giving a 404 error, but here's a FAQ page at the U.S. embassy in Canberra that has the following question:  ""MY CHILDREN AND/OR I HAVE BOTH U.S. AND AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS. CAN WE TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATES WITH ONLY OUR AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS AND ENTER ON THE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM?""  The answer given is:  ""No. The U.S. regulations require all U.S. citizens to enter and depart the United States at all times on their valid U.S. passports, regardless of their ages or how many foreign passports one may have. There is no guarantee of entry to the United States without a valid U.S. passport. Please refer to Dual Nationality for further information. (For travel to other countries please contact the relevant foreign embassy or consulate.)""  So implicitly, they're acknowledging that U.S. citizens can hold multiple passports.

I know you can go the other way, too: born an American and gain another citizenship abroad later without renouncing."

The oath has fairly severe wording about renounce foreign allegiances, but some countries wont let you renounce citizenship, others don't care and the U.S. does allow them, even for naturalized citizens (see /u/hctiwsblade13's posting elsewhere in this thread for an example of someone with this status).  I've tried to find a U.S. government site with more details on this but the page they all reference is bork'ed and returning a 404 error.

Ameristralia,361cwv,Lathaal,4,Fri May 15 07:18:15 2015 UTC,"Personally I've only attended in Australia, by my American gf and sister have both attended American college. I think a lot depends on where you want to live. I've had trouble getting my university recognised here (I live in Texas) but i can imagine it goes both ways. Also the small differences, American uni is more structured and there is a lot more general education. Australia they don't really seem to care if you go to class, just turn your shit in and that's it.   Other thing to consider is price. American scholarships are good but without them it's really expensive. Aus is expensive too but our hecs system has much lower interest and doesn't need to be paid back until you earn over a decent amount. Hope that helps at all!"
Ameristralia,361cwv,Edward_abc,2,Fri May 15 11:50:10 2015 UTC,"This is pretty late, but I attend school in the States and went to University of Melbourne for a semester last year. I think all yours & other's points about cheaper and quicker education are definitely true. It seems like Australia starts more individualized education during high school to get people ready for uni earlier, which the States doesn't do consistently at all - I found that school in Melbourne was much harder but that I had less help to get through it. Which is potentially more realistic to ""the real world"", but I think generally provides an environment with less support for each other -   One thing I really missed about my school back home when I was in Melbourne was the small classes and just the small school in general. It's true that I go to a school of 2600 in the US and Melbourne is about 40,000, but I don't think you can go to a small school like that in Australia. My teachers back home all know my name, so they can help me outside of class and it's way more personal, I walk around campus and see people I know. I think that it many ways, the benefits that that sort of experience provides can be so valuable and maybe even worth the cost (well...maybe...it's fuckin' expensive...) because you feel like a person and not just a number. Also, the States has the whole dorm system, so people are more likely to go far away from home for school but then actually live there so the campus is like a little city with all your friends, which is so nice.   Overall I think that the two systems can't really be labeled better or worse because they're quite different. From my knowledge the American system has way more variety in terms of what school you can go to, but definitely has its drawbacks, and the Australian system at face value seems ""better"" but has its drawbacks too, from an American perspective. But I do like how it arguably sets people up for success earlier.  :)"

I think the major reason i've chosen Australian over American is that I can actually start and get into my chosen program without doing 2+ years of general prerequesites that have nothing to do with my degree.

Ameristralia,35dwk9,The6ftPianist,2,Sat May 9 16:41:20 2015 UTC,Who knows? We suspect the cat tried to go the snake and came off second best. Somewhere my parents have photos of the hind legs of the cat sticking out of the snakes mouth.   While it was curious and amazing it was by no means pleasant seening a pet you have known and loved eaten but at the same time it made you realise to the snake it was just food. Seeing that was a growing up moment for me.
Ameristralia,35dwk9,Troub313,3,Sat May 9 13:48:25 2015 UTC,How did you not just beat the snake to death? I would have destroyed that thing.

Sometimes it gets to the point that death is the best option. There is a right time for everything, even death. This maybe the right time. My grandmother died a few years back and death came far too late. For me, knowing what she was going through the months before her passing was far worse than the death. She was a proud and independent woman that was trapped by her body. Watching her suffer through that was one of the hardest things that I have ever seen. Edit: I got to say goodbye one last time and I wish I hadn't seen her at all. I don't think she knew who I was and it killed me to see her like that.   This is probably kind of rambley, but I hope it helps a little bit. PM me if you need to talk. I'll be up late."
Ameristralia,34oq8x,SuperRedneck,5,Sun May 3 03:32:45 2015 UTC,"This. My mum passed in Oz while I was in college in Canada and it sucked big time. We were lucky that most of my siblings lived in Oz so she wasn't alone, but I felt so powerless through the last months of her illness, unable to help either her or my brothers and sisters.   I was fortunate that I got to go down to Oz a year or so before she passed and we knew then that she was sick, so I was able to come to terms with the fact that we would probably not see each other again. Still, the actual process, when it came,  was tough.  I was also lucky to have my wife to help me through the process. She had already lost her father (in Canada) while we were living in Oz so we could talk about how it felt like such a game changing experience and how powerless it made us feel.  The big take away for me was to realize how little we control the timetables of our lives, so we need to savor every moment with have with those we care about. I wish I could help you with your loss, but what helped me was to reflect on all the good times we had together, and to try to appreciate the time you have with those you care about. Perhaps you can reflect on the good times and take solace from those around you. All the best..."

I was moving to the other side of the country because I had real used I was gay but needed the space where no one knew me to discover myself. About a year later I visited again with a boyfriend and she was totally cool but everytime I left I had to mentally go through the ""saying good bye"" thing again.  Long story short she made it to 103 so there were 100s of trips home  and 100s of goodbyes. She was a very strong woman but I n the end she was tired of living and we told her it was ok to go whenever the time was right.  I was still living away the night my mum called to say that the nursing home had called as the end was close. I went home to the BF and we opened a bottle of Bollenger to say good bye.   I knew it was for the best but no matter how many times I'd said good bye in the past the last one still hurt."

Each man that’s in the side that’s in goes out, and when he’s out he comes in, and the next man goes in until he’s out.     When they are all out, the side that’s out comes in, and the side that’s been in goes out and tries to get those coming in out.     Sometimes you get men still in and not out.     When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out, he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in.     There are two men called umpires who stay all out all the time, and they decide when the men who are in are out.     When both sides have been in and all the men have been out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including the not outs, that’s the end of the game."

Ameristralia,2zp68v,I_snot_the_sheriff,18,Fri Mar 20 13:50:03 2015 UTC,"I work closely with the federal government, so the biggest issue for us is that all the feds were home for 17 days, and there were a lot of restrictions on what emails we could and couldn't read, what computers we couldn't log onto, etc.  As far as the public, it's because honestly, the public is bored with politics.  They're so used to the showboating and panic and grandstanding that they just don't pay attention anymore.  Every other day some politician or media organization is predicting the upcoming end of the world and the utter collapse of American society.  The media desperately wanted people to care, but for the most part, it had no real impact on the general public, save for a few national parks being closed.  One factor is that it wasn't a true shutdown.  They only closed ""non-essential"" things, which amounted to a tiny fraction of the government.  The post office continued operating, air traffic continued to flow, obviously the military continued operating as normal.  If the federal government ACTUALLY shut down, and there was no mail, no air traffic, no military, no Medicare payouts, no FBI, etc., then you can bet people would have paid more attention."
Ameristralia,2zp68v,scottevil110,8,Fri Mar 20 14:57:30 2015 UTC,The post office runs on its own revenue so shutting it down would make no sense.
Ameristralia,2zp68v,majoroutage,9,Fri Mar 20 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"You're right, that was a bad example, but you know what I mean.  People didn't see everyday services, essential services come to a halt.  So the perspective from most people's POV was ""Well, if this is what the country looks like with no federal government, why do we bother to have one?  This is fine..."""
Ameristralia,2zp68v,scottevil110,2,Fri Mar 20 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"...which is a pretty fucking stupid POV if you think about the micro parts of government, say, the emergency system. If that shut down then people would actually realize what shutting down the government means."
Ameristralia,2zp68v,waka_flocculonodular,3,Fri Mar 20 20:58:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Which is what I was saying at the time.  If you're going to ""shutdown"", don't be a pussy about it.  Shut down the air traffic.  Stop forecasting the weather.  Stop sending social security checks.  Close the federal courthouses.  Send the military home.    All it basically amounted to was:  A few federal employees weren't allowed to go to work and give loans."
Ameristralia,2zp68v,scottevil110,2,Sat Mar 21 00:32:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. It clears things up a little... But then I read the other comments (up until now) and I got all confused again because people have said the shutdown did make them mad so their response (which aligns somewhat to yours) is apathy. How can that be? No one mentioned protesting though many expressed dissatisfaction or aggravation with the system. Isn't SOME action a more appropriate response than the population simply giving a collective shrug of the shoulders? I don't mean to pass judgement I simply don't understand - Die Hard and Lethal Weapon movies set me up for more anti-establishment than this.
Ameristralia,2zp68v,scottevil110,3,Fri Mar 20 22:07:10 2015 UTC,"Some people were undoubtedly pissed about it, but most people really couldn't care less.  We're so used to the media hyping everything up, that we just assume whatever they're talking about isn't actually that big of a deal.    Also, I think the days of mass protest are largely over.  People have gotten a bit jaded by the system, in that legislators really don't give a shit what we think anymore.  If a million people are lined up on the Washington Mall to protest something, it won't change the minds of Congress for a second, so people figure, why bother?  Basically, the protesting spirit is broken."
Ameristralia,2zp68v,A_Soporific,2,Sat Mar 21 00:30:57 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with that assessment. We had protests resulting from that whole mess in Ferguson, and not just the local riots.  Really, the big Occupy protests were not effective use of protest and when they (entirely predictably) resulted in no change those people who were on the bandwagon jumped off. A protest, in order to be successful, must draw attention to a problem and provide an outlet for the response. Those giant unfocused protests didn't have the outlet because they never agreed on what they were about in the first place. So, even if the Occupy movement got everyone up in arms and mobilized to do something then it wouldn't have worked because they simply weren't ready to do a thing.  Previous and successful waves of protest, like the civil rights movement and the overthrow of communism in Eastern Block countries in 1989, occurred in several contractions as opposed to all at once. The first set of protests got everyone interested in setting up for large periods of time in touch and organized. They went through several iterations where they refined tactics and came to consensus on message. THEN they had the giant, irresistible rallies that people couldn't ignore if they wanted to and commanded the undivided attention of the entire nation for an extended period of time.  A one-off protest against a financial crisis or a manufactured political crisis like the shut down obviously wouldn't trigger the sort of society changing wave of protest, simply because there's no consensus, preparation, or opportunity to build those things.  Once we have a series or ongoing political problem that has a solution that a broad range of people agree upon a solution for then we'll see protest explode on the scene seemingly from nowhere. But, until we have the right situation and people using protest effectively it's going to be seen to be a waste of everyone's time and effort, mostly because it is when talking about national issues that everyone already knows about."
Ameristralia,2zp68v,Snakebite7,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:34:01 2015 UTC,Yeah the biggest issue was more that it screwed the workers.  My friend was a contractor at the library of congress at the time.  Since he wasn't a federal employee he didn't get back pay and since he worked in a federal building he couldn't go to work.  Basically he was forced to take 3 weeks of vacation time
Ameristralia,2zp68v,scottevil110,4,Fri Mar 20 15:15:36 2015 UTC,"Luckily, my particular employer leases out space inside this federal building, so we were still allowed to come to work during the shutdown.

Agreed, no one I knew gave a single fuck about it.  The Admin closing the woods to people was just their backhanded way of trying to make the average person feel effects of this and get media spin on it favorable to them.  What a joke it is to try to close the forest, the national forests belong to the populace, it was pretty shitty of them to think they even have the right to close them at all.    The thing that really bothered me was that the President is the one who literally chose to shut things down by refusing to sign a bill he didn't like, which is his right as POTUS.  However, to be able to twist that around and blame it on the people who actually passed a bill is fucking ridiculous.  He wouldn't play ball with congress and neither would the Senate, and the House wouldn't budge on defunding the ACA.  These are all within their rights as legislators and POTUS, but the fact that only one party receives the blame when no one cared to negotiate is just pathetic.    He could have signed the bill and funded the Govt, just like the most recent where the went to defund the illegal amnesty at DHS.  He is the one making the final choice to not pass a funding bill.  Both were avoidable, but the POTUS acts as if his viewpoint is the only good one and takes his ball and goes home."
Ameristralia,2zp68v,captain_craptain,4,Fri Mar 20 15:14:43 2015 UTC,"I'm no fan of a lot of his policies, and in the case of this, I'm libertarian, so I'm usually on the side of defunding things, but I'm inclined to agree that it was mainly the stubbornness of the GOP that led to that shut down.  He did agree to cut billions in spending, as did the Senate, even from very popular programs that are essential to the Democratic base, but the GOP refused to budge on anything, namely the ACA and raising taxes by even a single cent.    They knew that he would never agree to completely defund the ACA that they spent years crafting and negotiating, and since the House is typically the initiator of new legislation, they decided to use it as a pawn, sending bills that anyone with any sense knew he would never allow through, so that then they could try to turn it around and say ""Well, we TRIED to keep the government open..."""
Ameristralia,2zp68v,scottevil110,-6,Fri Mar 20 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"The House originates all spending bills, yes. Except when Nancy Pelosi is ramming the ACA through congress before anyone has a chance to read the bill.  I don't care that they were being stubborn on defunding the ACA, that is their right and their role.  That is what their constituents want and they were fighting for it.  That is what helped them win the midterms I think.  It certainly didn't hurt or we'd still have that asshat Harry Reid leading the senate."
Ameristralia,2zp68v,Sirspender,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"That is what their constituents want and they were fighting for it.   Well, actually that wasn't what their constituents wanted.  Ignoring the fact that this is from the Huffington Post, this is a summary of surveys taken in the days leading up to the shutdown  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/30/obamacare-polls_n_4018888.html  Each one showing public opposition to completely defunding the ACA.  What they did was purely political, which is why, despite being pretty conservative myself, I detest the GOP as much as I do the Democratic party.  They play politics.  They do what THEY want, not what their constituents want, and certainly not what's best for the country.    Whether I agree with Obama or not, I'm never going to support a bunch of people who are on record as saying ""Our primary goal is to make sure this is a one-term President.""  When their goal isn't about issues, or prosperity, or freedoms, or anything except ""making sure our team wins"", then they can go fuck themselves.    The Democrats are equally guilty of this, but I'm not about to pretend like Boehner is up there just looking out for my well-being.  And this particular group of GOP reps is about as bad as any have ever been.    If Obama really wanted the ACA to thrive, his best move would be to publicly call for it to be defunded.  It would pretty much guarantee that the GOP House would fund it for the rest of eternity."

Ameristralia,2zp68v,captain_craptain,2,Fri Mar 20 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"You shut down the parks because you need to cut back the people currently working there to a skeleton crew.  You aren't going to be paying people to maintain the parks when you aren't getting funding.  The same goes for the monuments.  It isn't just trying to ""hurt normal folks"", it's enacting the practical ramifications of a shutdown"
Ameristralia,2zp68v,Snakebite7,-2,Fri Mar 20 15:14:00 2015 UTC,"You don't need people to maintain the parks or the National Forest, its what normal people call 'the woods' and I don't need some morons in Smokey the Bear costumes bugging me when I go innawoods.  They could have been furloughed like the rest and caught up with whatever 'work' they do when they come back.  Instead they were made to evacuate people and work closing nature.   The same goes for the monuments. It isn't just trying to ""hurt normal folks"", it's enacting the practical ramifications of a shutdown     This could not be more wrong.  The open air monuments are not manned by anyone, period.  Capitol Hill police actually called in overtime with their officers in order to enforce the closing of open air, unmanned monuments.  These are places that don't have a permanent staff so spending the time and money to put gates in place and have police enforce these stupid gates is the opposite of enacting anything practical about a shutdown.    It was purely for show."
Ameristralia,2zp68v,captain_craptain,7,Fri Mar 20 15:19:15 2015 UTC,"You need rangers patrolling, maintenance crews to be checking the bathrooms and other features, need response crews available to help out if people get in trouble.  The parks aren't just trees.  And the open air monument are visited by thousands of tourists every day.  Tourists litter, have trash they need to throw away, do stupid things that need to be prevented, the list goes on.  The Lincoln Memorial has a bathroom in the base of it.  It doesn't clean itself.  The Vietnam Memorial doesn't have self cleaning sidewalks.  Each individual place doesn't have permanent staff, because that staff is responsible for all of them (perk of having so many monuments close together).  The security would've been there anyway, they usually are easily visible.  It takes an hour to set up a fence, not some massive jump in tasks.  Take it from someone who actually has lived in DC for the past 7 years.  You have no idea what you are talking about."

Ameristralia,2zp68v,RuTsui,3,Sat Mar 21 14:37:24 2015 UTC,So to understand why Americans don't care you have to understand how fucking stupid it is.  So this is how spending in America works:  The congress makes the budget  The president then legally has to enforce the budget  If the spending in the budget is more than the money that the US has the president has to borrow money  The president can't borrow over a certain amount (called a debt ceiling) without congressional approval  Congress gets on a high horse and blames the president for wasting so much money when the president has no power over that  So congress made a debt inducing budget knowing that it costs too much then blames the president when he says he needs more money to enforce their budget.  It's so fucking stupid that it's hard to even care.  They eventually make a deal because either he president or congress will get blamed in the media and make concessions.  If I were to march in the streets over it it would just be to ask that we get rid of this stupid loophole

Ameristralia,2zp68v,Mercarcher,3,Sat Mar 21 05:23:56 2015 UTC,"It has happened more than a few times. The shutdown is caused by a law that says if federal funding can't be secured and decided on by a set date, then the federal offices shut down, because it's important that we seriously (""seriously"") consider where our money is going rather than just let it be an automatic thing.  Usually (I'm pretty sure every time) the shutdown happens when one side of the legislative branch can't agree on some matter with the other side, and there's even enough numbers that they split the vote. It's basically one side saying ""I don't like the game so I'm taking my ball and going home"". Additional laws exist that would continue normal government functions, such as getting mail, paying soldiers, keeping embassies open, etc., and basically what happens when this point is reached is that certain offices (Congress and the HoR) get a paid vacation. This is what we should really be upset about, is that our representative don't feel any repercussions for their actions and inactions. They just get to stop doing their jobs while still getting paid.   I believe this last issue that shut down the government had to do with the National Defense Authorization Act. The NDAA basically sets out the budgeting and mission statements for various organizations, mostly within the Department of Defense. This last year, something was slipped into the NDAA that one side didn't like, and they demanded the entire thing be reworked. The NDAA is ones of those things that has to get done here, and it was going to pass, but not without a lot of flak. This happens a lot here, unfortunately. One party or the other will attempt to slip in extra little shit to further their agendas into bills they know will get passed.  All that extra stuff that happened, the closing of national parks and such, was President Obama attempting to light a fire under the legislature so that they would do their fucking jobs. Of course, news outlets, politicians, and even the states turned it around and used it as an opportunity to make themselves out as heroes. Yeah, good job Mr. Representative, giving your word to keep this memorial open. That's very noble of you. By the way, normal people don't get paid when they don't show up to work, but they do still have cough up the taxes that go into your paycheck, so how about you get back in your fucking chair and do your fucking job.  I think the general public wasn't too concerned as it happened because we quickly realized that it affected little to nothing in or day to day lives, and some of us have more immediate issues, like car payments. That's combined with a general lack of understanding because we like to get our political insight from opinionated news stations."
Ameristralia,2zp68v,xXrambotXx,3,Wed Mar 25 02:59:20 2015 UTC,"My Southern brother: The sad fact is that the vast a majority of Americans do not pay any attention to politics. They complain about all the campaign ads and can't wait for each election to be over. And they don't vote. So, they paid very little (or none whatsoever) attention to the government shut down. Just like they pay virtually no attention to the wars we have been fighting for 12 years. (Please note that Redditors, who seem to be very involved in politics, are a very small minority of the U.S. population.) I believe the apathy stems from 4 phenomena:  1 - Comfort: The U.S has had such a high standard of living, and virtually no conflict on our own soil, for so long, that we all feel safe. No matter who is in office, most of us have really good lives most of the time.  2 - Size of the electorate: When there are potentially over 200 million voters, one vote doesn't seem to matter. Why follow politics if your vote can't change anything?  3 - Money in politics. Especially since the Citizens United decision, people and organization with a lot of money dominate our politics. They decide who runs, they pay for campaigns, and they have tremendously outsized influence with elected officials. What individual citizen can hope to match the resources of the Koch brothers or the deep pockets of Exxon Mobil?  4 - All-volunteer army: Most of us have no ""skin in the game"" when we send the men and women of our armed forces to make war. No one we love, or even know, will be risking his/her life. And we are at no risk of being personally drafted into combat. Combine this with the myth of ""surgical strikes"" and war seems to have no consequences to most individual Americans."

Ameristralia,2zi6ig,doublebeefnbacon,2,Wed Mar 18 23:18:59 2015 UTC,A working holiday visa is a good choice for her assuming she is under 30 (or whatever the age limit is now).  She'll be able to stay for a year and if she doesn't like it she goes home.  If you guys fall madly in love you can get married and she can stay.  She's going to have to spend the best part of 1500 on her ticket to get to Oz (return to satisfy immigration she is leaving afterwards) so she will have to find a job unless your are supporting her.  Immigration will probably want to see more money in her bank account so they know she can support herself initially at least.

Ameristralia,2zj070,howlingchief,3,Thu Mar 19 08:02:01 2015 UTC,"1975 Australian constitutional crisis:       The 1975 Australian constitutional crisis (often known simply as ""the Dismissal"") has been described as the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australian history. It culminated on 11 November 1975 with the dismissal from office of the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, who then appointed the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser, as caretaker Prime Minister.  Whitlam's Labor government had been elected in 1972 with a small majority in the House of Representatives, but with the Opposition controlling the Senate. Another election in 1974 resulted in little change. While the Whitlam Government introduced many new policies and programs, it was also rocked by scandals and political miscalculations. In October 1975, the Opposition used its control of the Senate to defer passage of appropriation bills, which finance governmental operations and which had been passed by the House of Representatives. The Opposition stated that they would continue to do so unless Whitlam called an election for the House of Representatives and urged Kerr to dismiss Whitlam unless he agreed to their demand. Whitlam believed that Kerr would not dismiss him, and Kerr did nothing to disabuse Whitlam of this notion.  On 11 November 1975, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock. When he went to seek Kerr's approval of the election, Kerr instead dismissed him as Prime Minister and shortly thereafter installed Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all ALP parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies were able to secure passage of the appropriation bills, and Kerr dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority.

If the queen no longer appoints them how are they decided. Should we copy birth ameristralia? Should we get rid of the position?

But I'm not sure, maybe it's cause it's contributing to the 'bushman' culture of the late 1800s which patriotic Australians wanted to emphasise in order to demonstrate themselves as British subjects in heritage, yet capable of being a distinct nation in of itself. This was a re-occurring theme for many Aussies at that period and while I can't say why that one in particular has been immortalised above any others though.  I should say again, this is ONLY my opinion, but yeah Australians like Alfred Deakin, were trying to carve an identity for Australia politically, and in doing that there has to be culture to go with it. There was that very blue-collar image then. A hard-working, tough, socially mobile, democratic nation-to-be. At least that was the thinking.  Also it's the middle of the night when you posted this, that's why you're not getting many replies haha."

Ameristralia,2z4oic,Fishfake2,6,Mon Mar 16 03:26:19 2015 UTC,There are a few reasons.   One is it can have a slow tragic tune.  Another is simply that it's something that's been passed down culturally. I remember hearing it during Anzac day a lot and that gives it more impact.  The third reason is it's one of the few originally south Ameristralian songs. It came about while South Ameristralia was still coming into it's own and it's sorta a culture classic

Ameristralia,2z4oic,akrebsie,1 point,Mon Mar 16 08:11:25 2015 UTC,"Why is it so meaningful to Australians? Songs are funny things and can convey a lot of meaning without meaningful lyrics, the lyrics in Waltzing Matilda are meaningful they just don't have a coherent plain message. Songs often have nonsense or vague lyrics which allows people to have their own individual interpretations and feelings.  The song has history in Australia's hard times esp the great depression when men would wander through the country side looking for any work (mostly farmwork, shearing, fencing) he could get, he would walk and carry his billy (kettle) his swag (bedroll) and a few other personal effects, this was called his matilda.   When he needed to rest he would stop boil the billy, have a cuppa and make some damper (very basic camp fire bread) He would live on little to nothing so that he could send his earnings home to support his family.   Here is a clip from the movie ""The Shiralee"" about a swagman who took his daughter from his adulterous wife, and raised her as a swagman. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcR9mBNDsgg  I have never wandered the bush on foot in search for work but sometimes when I go on long road trips I pull my ute into the bush somewhere discreet and start a little fire and cook up a bit of something maybe have a coffee, it is very enjoyable and reminds me of a time like when the swagmen wandered. Of course for the swagmen it was lonely, hungry, desperate and hard, but it is in hardship we find our true selves, not when the times are easy.   When it is easy anyone can do well, but your true character shines through when no one is watching and life sucks, yet you keep pushing.   Thanks for reminding me why I am proud to be Australian."

The toads were eventually introduced and multiplied in numbers and have since caused large amounts of destruction to the natural environment. In the process killing large numbers of native animals such as green tree frogs, skinks and natural flora and fauna that provides sustenance for other native animals.    Household pets are often victims of poisoning from toads.  99% of people hate them they are gross. Almost every Australian child has at one point killed one with a cricket bat, golf club or hockey stick. In the end they didn't do much to get rid of the cane beetles."

The major centre for commerce are in the SE corner around Brisbane and running in an approximate 100Km (60m) circumference. This is where most of the state business HQ's are concentrated as are Universities, major sporting clubs etc. As you go up the coast you have a number of varying sized cities that have major hospitals and even national sporting teams. There are also major cities inland, mostly based around mines or agriculture. Like most 'city' folk we tend to call most people outside of Brisbane and the Gold Coast demeaning names like, hicks, yokels, rednecks etc.  But saying that unless you really get into the bush, most of them don't have two heads and have more that two teeth in the family.

It is the most conservative state and has a big chunk of the religious population, along with the largest rural population in Australia. However it isnt really like Alabama since it has a very strong economy centred around resource extraction, agriculture, tourism and manufacturing.   Fun fact, Queensland refused to adopt the Australian national anthem ""Advance Australia Fair"" for several years after it was instituted as the official national anthem. This is because Queensland was still staunchly in favour of keeping ""God Save the Queen"" as its national anthem.   Queensland also has a history of quasi slavery in that it mass imported Pacific islanders to work in the sugar cane fields through the 1880's - 1940's. Many of these workers brought out were kidnapped/ not paid/ severely abused.   So yeh, Queensland is basically Texas."

Ameristralia,2xxnhp,lach88,2,Thu Mar 5 05:11:33 2015 UTC,No need to tip at bars/restaurants/cabs.  On Anzac Day there's a gambling game called Two Up.
Ameristralia,2xxnhp,Crinneh,1 point,Thu Mar 5 07:50:34 2015 UTC,"Two-up:       Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated ""spinner"" throwing two coins or pennies into the air. Players gamble on whether the coins will fall with both heads (obverse) up, both tails (reverse) up, or with one coin a head, and one a tail (known as ""odds""). It is traditionally played on Anzac Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with diggers through the ages.  The game is traditionally played with pennies – their weight, size, and surface design make them ideal for the game. Weight and size make them stable on the ""kip"" and easy to spin in the air. Decimal coins are generally considered to be too small and light and they don't fly so well. The design of pre-1939 pennies had the sovereign's head on the obverse (front) and the reverse was totally covered in writing making the result very easy and quick to see. Pennies can often be observed being used at games on Anzac Day, as they are brought out specifically for this purpose each year.

And I know that his secret service detail was called off of the back of his car, and even they seemed confused. (sorry it is a real conspiracy video, I'm too drunk to sift through the chaff)  We'll never know what exactly happened, but it would take evidence that doesn't exist to make me believe the story as told in history class.

Ameristralia,2xa0bc,psychonavigator,4,Fri Feb 27 04:18:06 2015 UTC,Gas dryer?!   Huh.
Ameristralia,2xa0bc,Rimbosity,8,Fri Feb 27 04:31:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of houses in the US are plumbed for gas all over, just like your water heaters, stoves (cooktops) and ovens. It's reasonably common to have one in the laundry for dryers. You can get electric, but gas it where it's at.  Instant heat, lower energy costs, quicker drying time... They're awesome. Honestly, if I ever get to owning a house here, I'm having gas plumbed for one.  That said, nothing beats the cost of free. And outside is free."
Ameristralia,2xa0bc,psychonavigator,3,Fri Feb 27 05:30:28 2015 UTC,"Get my condo complex. It was built by a mob attorney in the early 70's. The gas line feeds half the units on my street, comes down to next to my unit... and then just ends. Couldn't be bothered to go the rest of the way.  The kicker? We get charged for electricity on the same fee schedule as the units down the street -- and no consideration for size. A 2-bed 1-bath with gas is on the same schedule as a 3-bed 2-bath with electric only.  That just ain't right."
Ameristralia,2xa0bc,Kclndavis,3,Fri Feb 27 05:47:09 2015 UTC,"Woah!  I just spent a little while reading about gas dryers - They seem way better. Like twice as quick cost less than half the price of an an electric dryer.  But since no-one uses them over here they seem to cost over $2,500 (electric dryers can be had for are about $300). Plus a gas line/extraction vent has to be run to the laundry...  Oh, and lots of homes don't have plumbed gas coming off the street and have to rely on gas bottles which have to be delivered. Bottled gas costs about three times as much as 'piped' gas, so I guess there goes all your cost savings..."

I like being able to hang clothes out to dry, they smell better, you don't have to worry about your jeans shrinking, you save on your electric bill, and you aren't adding extra heat to your house on an already hot summer day.  I have a dryer and an indoor clothes line but I pick the outdoor clothesline as long as the weather allows it. Even watching the forecast and doing laundry on the nice days just so I can hang it out."

While Honolulu is a great idea because it's kind of in the middle I fear it would be a politicians holiday location.   I am proposing somewhere like Alice Springs or an equivalent in NAm. Right in the middle of the country and in the case of Alice Springs nowhere.   Pros - safe from attack. Only real option of warlike attack would be by air and even then it wouldn't be easy. Long way from any coast and harsh environment to try and attack by land.  - regional so the politicians can see first hand the issues felt by those outside capital cities.   Cons - middle of nowhere (I really see this as a pro)   Maybe both Alice Springs and the NAm equivalent with a mandate that the two meet by video conference to cut down on overseas travel."

You could stake out your allotted portion of land and over a course of years you were expected to improve the land.  One requirement was planting harvestable trees.  eucalyptus trees grew very well in California, so when they were required to grow 10 acres, they chose the eucalyptus.

Ameristralia,2v6n2s,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Feb 8 11:34:15 2015 UTC,"Flag of Australia:       The flag of Australia is a defaced Blue Ensign: a blue field with the Union Jack in the canton (upper hoist quarter), and a large white seven-pointed star known as the Commonwealth Star in the lower hoist quarter. The fly contains a representation of the Southern Cross constellation, made up of five white stars – one small five-pointed star and four, larger, seven-pointed stars.  The flag's original design (with a six-pointed Commonwealth Star) was chosen in 1901 from entries in a competition held following Federation, and was first flown in Melbourne on 3 September 1901;  this date has been proclaimed as Australian National Flag Day.  A slightly different design was approved by King Edward VII in 1902. The seven pointed commonwealth star version was introduced by a proclamation dated 23 February 1908.  The dimensions were formally gazetted in 1934,  and in 1954 the flag became recognised by, and legally defined in, the Flags Act 1953, as the ""Australian National Flag"".  In addition, there are other official flags representing Australia, its people and core functions of government.

People spoke differently, had different ideas of fun, acted in really strange ways, had entirely different values about society, and were extremely overconfident in everything. The only ""Cultural"" alignment we seem to have to them is having US Television shows. So I really can't say I know what you're on about when you say that the culture is ""a lot more aligned."" It's incredibly not, as much as you would like to think so. Australia is still VERY much similar to the major countries of the Commonwealth, I would have to say that America was possibly the most different place I've ever been to. Yet I've traveled around Europe, I've found a lot of us Aussies just don't like to affiliate ourselves with Poms. :P"
Ameristralia,2v3u6e,lizardking91,1 point,Sun Feb 8 02:40:58 2015 UTC,"Heh, I am very similar, father is British born, in Lincolnshire, England.  I would have agreed with you pre WW2. But the world is different. British and Australian people have very similar sensibilities you are right. We play similar sports, and have a strong cultural bond.  But Australians today are a lot more akin to Americans. Frontier civilizations, massive countries, our media / fashion / music / TV, is ALL American today. Very few Australians are involved in anything British beyond ""top gear"" etc.  Australians have no real cultural alignment / link to Europe anymore, unlike the British who are fully involved in the EU.   Britain is seen as far more 'other' pompous and old. While America is seen as young, fashionable, new.  You mustn't have traveled very much, because the USA from an Australian POV is not THAT 'other'. I KNOW what you are talking about, but I think you are overall exaggerating.   Americans truly have their own 'civilization' but if you grew up, an Australian, over the last 20-30 years. You grew up, heavily indoctrinated by American TV, music, clothing, games, websites, everything. You may as well have grown up just like an American youth, without the Reeses pieces and Walmart (hell we have our own equivalents of those anyway..)  I guess many Australians still drink Twinings Tea so theres that?"
Ameristralia,2v3u6e,lizardking91,2,Sun Feb 8 13:41:50 2015 UTC,"I think sensibilities would be a great way to put it. The American and Australian 'Societies' are incredibly different to one another. We're definitely influenced by them in the media and fashion among other things. However, I would have to say that I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that the American way of thinking is just completely foreign to us, New Zealand and the UK.  So you're right in terms of what surrounds us, but I don't think we're ever going to see eye to eye with them on a wide variety of topics. Simply because we're influenced by their 'Entertainment' so to speak. I think British terminology and values seem to be quite embedded into our society. I believe that's why I found it so easy to come back and talk to fellow Aussies and Vice Versa. However, when speaking to American's things are just always incredibly different, especially in debates. So as much as I know you hate to see it said, Australia, in terms of people... is impeccably different from the United States. On a lighter note in some ways, that's a good thing.  Edit; Just try and go to both countries some time in your life. I think you'll quickly understand where I'm coming from and which seems more like home."

I was so interested in it, wasn’t quite sure why it existed? I mean they were just our colonial brothers too right? Why is that sort of like ‘weirdness’ in every conversation?

These are things I definitely didn't really think of, I think the cultural element with the revolution is a big one, that is absent from commonwealth countries.   What you have said does in some sense reinforce my understanding of seeing us as ""other"" while we don't see americans as ""other"".

But the United States is indeed separated by that revolutionary spirit we gained through what we perceived as British tyranny. Being a history student, I dare say that I'm not 100% supportive of the ""British oppressed us"" narrative, but I'm not completely supportive of what Lord North and the British governments of 1763-1775 did to assuage the colonists -- the Thirteen Colonies were the second largest British territory at the time, I feel like common sense would've pointed out to Tories and Whigs alike that they couldn't just expect the Americans to fall into line like their other colonies -- before the conquest of India, Philadelphia was the second largest city in the Empire, only behind London. Glasgow, Edinburgh, Liverpool, etc. etc. were all smaller than Philadelphia! I feel that many Americans, even Patriots, didn't want to sever their ties to Britain, they just wanted better representation and to be treated as Britons, not filthy colonists. Oh well, 'twas about 240 years ago.  Though if you look at America's gossip rags and our culture, many of us adore the Royals."

You are not playing softball. You are playing SLOSHBALL. Beer drinking is as much as part of the game as making outs and scoring runs. If you try to avoid drinking beer to enhance your play in the field, you suck and should be punched in the nuts. * Play as many innings as you want. Be sure to account for the amount of beer you have. * Teams do a boat race to determine home and away teams. The team that wins the boat race, chooses home or away (in the field first or batting first). * Pitch to your own team. There are no walks. * Strikeouts occur when a player does not hit a ball in fair play by the 3rd pitch. * 2nd Base * Play as many innings as you want. Be sure to account for the amount of beer you have. * Teams do a boat race to determine home and away teams. The team that wins the boat race, chooses home or away (in the field first or batting first). * Pitch to your own team. There are no walks. * Strikeouts occur when a player does not hit a ball in fair play by the 3rd pitch. * 2nd Base     When a player reaches 2nd base, that player must stop at second and chug a beer (size of beers determined by the commissioner and each team must be treated equally) before moving on to 3rd base. That player can leave 2nd base anytime after the beer has been finished whether its on the same play or a future play. Multiple players can accumulate at 2nd base and 2nd base only. There is never a force out at third so a player is never forced to leave 2nd base. Players must advance from 2nd base in the order they arrived, no passing. Although multiple players can run at the same time and score together.

Settle all REASONABLE disputes like gentlemen, through boat races. A dispute over a play between two players, such as being thrown out at first, or tagged out at home can be settled in a 1-on-1 boat race to save time. Larger disputes such as disputes over the rules that cannot be settled by the Commish, should be settled in a team vs. team boat race.

I remember reading about him last ANZAC Day. It seems every year around that time I read an account that makes me realise yet again that war would probably do my head in. I'm not a small bloke and I like to think I'm reasonable tough, but I don't think I'd do well in those conditions.   Part of me wonders if part of what causes issues after war is people having their identities challenged so forcefully. I.e. a regular Joe who considers himself to be a good provider for his family, a good mate, and a generally decent person. He is then thrust into a situation where he is away from his family with the possibility of dying and not providing for them, he's powerless to stop his friends being killed around him and he's forced to kill someone he's never met and has nothing against. I can see why this would cause huge problems as I think they would in me.   Maybe Bull decided he couldn't not be him. If there was still blood in his veins he was not going to sit about while he could make a difference. Even if it cost him his life he wasn't giving up who he was. I'd like to think it helped him cope with it all after the war, but I can't really know. I'd also like to think I would have a similar integrity, but that too I will hopefully never know."

We have ""bush"" country in the states, but it's known more as brush country or ranch country, or just flatly as high desert. We get large fires in those areas for sure, but the Aussie fires always seem to be way more intense. Makes me wonder, is it more the fuel loading across Australian land, or the species of vegetation in those areas?"
Ameristralia,2rcz40,Son_of_a_Jackal,2,Tue Jan 6 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the US is very minimal when it comes to your wild fires.  Most of our cities are surrounded by national parks, forrestry or bush/scrub lands.  The current fire in South australia Is burning through our foot hills which has all of the above.  Our bush is thick and dense and is generally made up of huge eucalyptus trees and other gum trees which shed a lot of bark. In summer due to the extreme heat the trees will also drop limbs to reduce the amount of water they need. Eucalyptus trees also have a unique oil in them which just adds to the fuel load when burning.  The bush/scrub floor is covered in thick barks, tree branches and bush scrub.  Then you throw into the mix Paddocks for livestock, Wheat/pea straw farming, properties and towns.  When the fires hit the paddocks and farm fields it will race across them at an alarming rate.  Our summers are known for being hot and dry with high winds which contribute significantly to the behaviour of the fire, not to mention the terrain, Quite often it is impossible to get into some of the places to fight it so its more of a case of setting up a parameter and waiting for it to come to you.  In this fire the parameter is 240km (149miles) and had been burning in all directions."

Ameristralia,2r61c2,Fgrira-Fpevoare,1 point,Fri Jan 30 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"Queen Victoria:       Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 – 22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she used the additional title of Empress of India.  Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III. Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She inherited the throne at the age of 18, after her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no legitimate, surviving children. The United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy, in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments. Publicly, she became a national icon, and was identified with strict standards of personal morality.  Victoria married her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1840. Their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent, tying them together and earning her the nickname ""the grandmother of Europe"". After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration.  Her reign of 63 years and seven months, which is longer than that of any other British monarch and the longest of any female monarch in history, is known as the Victorian era. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover. Her son and successor, Edward VII, belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the line of his father.

My mother (an American) is convinced that when he admitted to his adultery with Camilla, he basically lost his right to the throne... She's convinced that Prince Andrew will succeed when Her Majesty dies -- I had to correct that quickly, since she had no idea how the British line of succession worked. XD  In all seriousness, abdication in an Edward VIII-esque style may be the saving grace for him; he can be the elder statesman and an advisor to his son, who has a very promising future as King."

I had ferrets a couple years ago and feeding them a raw diet cost about the same as feeding them super premium ferret food, and was better for them.  If I ever get another dog, I plan on at least seeing if it's cost effective to feed them a raw diet vs feeding them super premium dog food.  I imagine that it wouldn't be for a large enough dog, but I prefer little yip dogs anyways, so it might work for me."

You said in the other thread that you and your kids are into sport too, and glenwood has a soccer and cricket club, but if you're a little home sick, there is a baseball club about a 5 min drive away in a suburb called kellyville.

Ameristralia,2qoias,soda1337,4,Mon Dec 29 14:25:30 2014 UTC,Driving anywhere in Sydney is a nightmare. Its not really made for cars like most cities in the US are. Find a suburb on an express train line far out of the city and commute.

Ameristralia,2qoias,d_c_h,2,Mon Dec 29 20:59:54 2014 UTC,"I'd recommend Parramatta and surrounds - Northmead, Winston Hills, Baulkham Hills. It's classic suburbia, has a great range of selective state schools (James Ruse, Baulkham Hills). It's a culturally diverse area, Parra has great food and shopping and the public transport to the CBD is streamlined. You can probably rent a 4 bed apartment for your price range and there's plenty of parks etc in the area. Townhouses are a viable alternative. It used to be rough - 20 to 30 years ago... but since it has diversified culturally, the area is very family friendly. EDIT: It also has a solid range of catholic schools as well."
Ameristralia,2qoias,Violet_Dream,2,Mon Dec 29 13:06:17 2014 UTC,"If you're rich, Eastern Suburbs near Bondi. Want middle class between Sydney and the West, opt for Ryde and its surrounding areas. A little bit lower than middle class, head for Parramatta and those areas surrounding. Don't go past Blacktown because it becomes a lot more dangerous, people are rougher and it takes ages to get to the city. Applies to Campbelltown, Fairfield, and others in that region.  Also trains will be your solace so find a suburb on the express North Western, West, Eastern lines etc. Go onto the NSW Transport site for routes and you'll find suburbs you can google further from there."

He closed and persecuted the Catholic Clergy, and closed the Protestant churches and only permitted a church based on his ideology.   After the war Churches would not be allowed to build and would be pushed out of the new Nazi society.  So yeah, Hitler wasn't Christian."

Ameristralia,2pb4l5,freetheducks,3,Mon Dec 15 11:40:29 2014 UTC,Wow....just wow.  So are you telling me that there aren't any sieges in the US?  Any time there looks like being one Captain America with a concealed weapon stops it?  The difference between this situation and something similar in the US is this disturbed individual was armed with a shotgun whereas a disturbed individual in the US can be easily armed to the teeth with automatic weapons and able to kill dozens of people before the police can react.  Maybe you should look at our gun laws as the government hasn't banned all guns but you do need to have a reason to own one.
Ameristralia,2pb4l5,Numquamsine,0,Mon Dec 15 15:21:41 2014 UTC,"Any time there looks like being one Captain America with a concealed weapon stops it?   /r/dgu     The difference between this situation and something similar in the US is this disturbed individual was armed with a shotgun whereas a disturbed individual in the US can be easily armed to the teeth with automatic weapons and able to kill dozens of people before the police can react.     For starters, anyone who knows anything about guns knows that you can do a lot more damage effectively in a short span of time with a shotgun.  Plugs can be removed so it can hold more shells and it isn't hard to reload.  The nice thing about a shotgun is that you don't really have to aim, shooting the big scary black guns I'm sure you are afraid of is not easy.    Second, it is not easy to get an automatic weapon in the USA.  Any automatic weapon before a certain date (I believe 1986) is prohibitively expensive as they are mostly collectors items at this point and anything manufactured since then requires an FFL (A Federal Firearms License) and a registered stamp per weapon.  FFL holders are almost exclusively gun dealers and gun shop owners.  An FFL lets you buy and sell as well as handle sales for others (paperwork involved here).  It also allows you to own automatic weapons, which are still prohibitively expensive.  So NO, it is not easy for any maniac to get his hands on automatic weapons and that doesn't even touch the fact that background checks will bring up mental health if it is a big enough problem for the individual.    I want to repeat the last part of what you said though.    disturbed individual in the US can be easily armed to the teeth with automatic weapons and able to kill dozens of people before the police can react.    Maybe you should look at our gun laws as the government hasn't banned all guns but you do need to have a reason to own one.     Ignoring all the reasons I laid out as to why a nutjob cannot be 'easily armed to the teeth with automatic weapons' let's say this was possible here and this was the case for a siege here.  If there were a concealed carrier in the vicinity then you won't have to wait for the police to react, there is already an armed law abiding citizen who can act to stop the threat to others.  If he can't eliminate the threat then he can provide cover so others can escape or pin the shooter down until help can arrive.   So you should tell your government that being able to use a sidearm to protect yourself or others at a moments notice in case of a situation like this is your reason to own one."

Fuck you very much, no one is happy with school shootings but we also aren't a nation of naive children who think you can stop this stuff by punishing millions of innocent people.  The amount of school shootings is also completely over sensationalized and plastered in the media making it seem a lot worse than it really is.    Police the mentally ill folks and track them and stop trying to ban inanimate objects.  The mentally ill are the problem, not guns.    Port Arthur killer was known to be crazy and people let him collect guns anyways even though he had a history of extremely erratic and disturbing behavior.

Another place with similar effort to theme is the ""Tap Inn"" there's actually a driving range in there and you shoot golf balls toward the toilets. It's pretty fantastic going to the bathroom and having golf balls hurled toward you as you pee.

Ameristralia,2mnt46,account_117,18,Tue Nov 18 18:28:25 2014 UTC,"It's a picture of Simone de Beauvoir (1908-86), a French existentialist and feminist. Like her lover Jean-Paul Sartre, de Beauvoir believed that existence precedes essence, i.e. 'human beings--through their consciousness--create their own values and determine a meaning for their lives because the human being does not possess any inherent identity or value'.  Following from there, de Beauvoir uttered perhaps her most famous quotation, ""One is not born a woman, but becomes one."" Your identity as a woman (or man, whether you're butch, femme, a housewife or a sniper) is a product of your choices and actions, not something essential about you that you don't have control over. You'll want to take a look at her 1949 treatise The Second Sex.  So OP is saying that no one is 'born' an Ameristralian--you have to express Ameristralia-ness through your actions and commitments (like moving to Australia from the states and getting PR)."

Ameristralia,2lg0uv,EmilioTextevez,1 point,Thu Nov 6 21:11:24 2014 UTC,Ya I saw that. It looks like it's happened on more than one occasion though. Even temporary locations are cause for celebration!
Ameristralia,2lg0uv,SansBeanieBoulderer,2,Thu Nov 6 21:26:53 2014 UTC,Agreed.  Living in California I feel spoiled... I'd be happy to spread the wealth to our southern brothers & sisters.
Ameristralia,2lg0uv,EmilioTextevez,4,Thu Nov 6 21:31:02 2014 UTC,speaking for the eastern North Ameristalians.. we still have not received these. I raise you our Chick-fil-a's

Ameristralia,2lg0uv,jubelo,2,Thu Nov 6 16:22:12 2014 UTC,I'd say someone high up at in n out recently went on holidays to Melbourne and decided they needed a reason to go back.
Ameristralia,2lg0uv,Cormophyte,2,Fri Nov 7 02:46:01 2014 UTC,"Oooooh, man. If the burgers turn out the same as they do here you're in for a treat.  A four by four, medium rare, animal style, with well done animal style fries is what you want, in case you're wondering...unless they've totally screwed up."
Ameristralia,2lg0uv,leftofmiddle,1 point,Thu Nov 6 05:13:58 2014 UTC,...with a Neapolitan shake to top it off.
Ameristralia,2lg0uv,sikamikanicoh,2,Thu Nov 6 17:00:00 2014 UTC,"Ok my northern brethren, what's the big deal? Why is this in n out joint so much better than maccas or whatever other random shitty fast food burger place.   On the topic, what the fuck is up with A&W? Tried it on holiday earlier this year. Seriously even by fast food burger standards they're total balls. And their root beer float tastes like arse."
Ameristralia,2lg0uv,SansBeanieBoulderer,1 point,Thu Nov 6 13:27:59 2014 UTC,"Fries are made with peanut oil, patties are fresh, greens are crisp. Look up the secret menu and you'll find an amazing treat. I always recommend a double double animal style, with animal fries. Everyone here will tell you to grab a Neapolitan shake. But I recommend an Arnold Palmer with a lemon wedge inside."
Ameristralia,2lg0uv,beardedjack,1 point,Thu Nov 6 18:02:39 2014 UTC,A&W has not been a good burger joint since the 80s. The only ones I see anymore are usually in the less fortunate parts of town and typically are joined with another businesses. They basically survive on legacy at this point.
Ameristralia,2lg0uv,Troub313,1 point,Thu Nov 6 18:51:59 2014 UTC,Quality made to order burgers with fresh ingredients. That's In-N-Out's quality promise.  God bless.

Ameristralia,2lg0uv,Lethal21,1 point,Fri Nov 7 00:43:27 2014 UTC,"Seriously though, In N Out is one of the best burgers available. They keep it simple: Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Fries, and drink. Thats it. Nothing else. They also keep everything fresh. They cut their potatoes right in front of you, never frozen. They also pay their employees above average wages, so your customer experience should be above par as well. In fact, Ive never had a bad experience at an In N Out, ever.   The classic the the Double Double: two beef patties and two slices of cheese. Animal style means they grill the onions (delish). Animal style fries means they top the fries with sauce, grilled onions and I think cheese (I dont dig the Animal Style fries that much, I prefer plain fries)."
Ameristralia,2lg0uv,seattleque,2,Thu Nov 6 16:26:31 2014 UTC,"We need an in 'n' out in Melbourne cause I can't afford a return trip to California everytime I want a burger. Btw, 4x4 animal style."

Ameristralia,2lg0uv,Troub313,1 point,Thu Nov 6 17:10:39 2014 UTC,"So not cool. California should really bring this to America first to make up for all the less than cool things they force on us, like emissions laws before they start expanding in n out to south Australia."

Ameristralia,2krde0,Samuel-L-Chang,2,Sun Nov 16 23:23:51 2014 UTC,I guess it just sounds a lot better at a faster pace in a band. I've heard it played many times by our Army bands and it is always at the same kind of pace as the one played by the Marines here.
Ameristralia,2krde0,AussieStig,2,Mon Nov 17 06:49:24 2014 UTC,"Waltzing Matilda, is actually the anthem of 1st MAR DIV. It comes from when we were stationed there, during WW2, the Aussies would play it, as our boys went off to kick Herohito in his hind end, and give them what for."
Ameristralia,2kd9o3,ShutUpHeExplained,20,Sun Oct 26 13:44:05 2014 UTC,"Listen online to Triple J. It's billed as 'Australia's Youth Station' and essentially caters for the 15-25 year old market.   It is very very popular, though it does have its detractors. Many people listen when they are aged 15-25, but come to dislike the station when they age out of the target demographic.  For example - They were one of (if not THE) first station/s to play grunge music in the 90s, but they play next to none now. So lots of people my age listened to JJJ, but no longer do because they don't play the music we grew up with.  JJJ do a lot for unsigned Australian artists, and upcoming Australian artists, but there has been a lot of recent controversy because they are (arguably) seen as dictators over what becomes popular.  I'd say give it a listen and decide for yourself. Monday - Thursday nights 9-10 there is a show for new Aus music if that's what you're after.  If you were born in the 70s or 80s, I'd recommend their sister station Double J"

Ameristralia,2j9v19,HDZombieSlayerTV,1 point,Wed Oct 15 06:53:28 2014 UTC,"We have two main codes in the South, NRL (played in 2 states) and AFL (which is played in the other 4 states),  The road to the the NFL is a lot lot easier for the AFL guys due to it being a more kicking orientated game. Its going to be a lot harder for NRL legend Hayne to crack it and here is why.  To be a good AFL player you have to be able to kick extremely long distances (50 yards or more) with pinpoint accuracy. Due to the nature of the AFL game and how it is played, your average AFL player would be able to outkick 99% of the best US punters. Its easy for these guys to transition and most NFL coaches would hire an AFL import over a local guy due to their superior kicking skills.  NRL however is a totally different game to AFL, these guys are big and fast, but where they struggle is in the strategy side of the NFL game. And this is due to the fact that that NRL is more continuous and free flowing and much less strategic.   The AFL punter guys dont need to know how to read the play since their job is just to kick, with Haynes it will be a different story, he will have to be a real quick study because due to his rugby background he will be playing anything except a punter."

I hope he does well would be awesome to have more international players in the NFL would hopefully help spread the sport.
Ameristralia,2j9v19,DAVYWAVY,1 point,Wed Oct 15 02:27:10 2014 UTC,"Its difficult to transition, AFL have tried importing college recruits from Basketball (perfect skill set for centre tap outs) and Northern College Football and they have never been quite able to cut it.  Gaelic football AFL imports are the only cross code recruits I have seen work well and that is only because Gaelic Football is pretty much the same game as AFL only with a round ball.  AFL NFL imports work quite well as punters in the NFL too. NRL guys however find it much more difficult.  Not saying Haynes cant transition but it is going to be tougher for him, unlike the AFL import punters, he is going to be out on the field and as a result he will have to learn how to read NFL plays.

Running back is more likely--he can learn how to hit holes then use his speed and athleticism to make things happen."

Ameristralia,2fiq0y,alfrednugent,9,Fri Sep 5 06:58:09 2014 UTC,"It is a well ""known"" sport especially the more educated you are. It's a pretty popular college intramural sport especially in private colleges and universities. It's definitely growing but if you ask a randomized amount of people to tell you the different rules for the different leagues/levels a majority would fail.  One of my local pubs is popular with rugby fans and an assistant editor of this website comes in often. He's a nice guy and likes to talk rugby over a couple beers. http://www.rugbytoday.com"

The brewing process for this beer developed in the mid 19th century when Gabriel Sedlmayr took pale ale brewing techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany and applied it to existing lagering methods. This approach was picked up by other brewers, most notably Josef Groll of Bavaria who produced Pilsner Urquell in the city of Pilsen in the Czech Republic. The resulting Pilsner beer - pale coloured, lean and stable beers were very successful and gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today.

Ameristralia,2cccgn,Pm-me-your-pineapple,0,Fri Aug 8 16:35:29 2014 UTC,Tightening our restrictions on the gun laws we have similar to what you did in '96 would be a good start in my book. It's ridiculous seeing all the mass shootings year after year.
Ameristralia,2cccgn,bcrabbers,2,Fri Aug 1 17:07:46 2014 UTC,"Firstly, Aussie gun laws have nothing to do with the quality of life. It's simply a damn good country where everyone can see the doc without being charged up the ass, there's plenty of opportunity, and the people are fantastic.  Secondly, as much as people talk it up, those gun laws in '96 didn't change shit. Gun-related deaths were declining since 1990 and continued to decline at the same rate afterward (that massacre of '96 was the only exception). The total homicide rate, on the other hand, didn't start to fall until early 2000s. So people kept on killing each other at the same rate as before, they just didn't use guns."
Ameristralia,2cccgn,ranky26,5,Fri Aug 1 20:04:01 2014 UTC,"Actually, the gun laws in '96 changed quite a lot. From '84 - '96, there were 13 mass shootings. Since '96, there have been 0. For there not to have been a single mass shooting since, it's hard to argue that there is any other reason for this.  Now I'm not saying that it would or even could work in the US, but it certainly worked here.  source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Australia"
Ameristralia,2cccgn,bcrabbers,1 point,Fri Aug 1 22:39:45 2014 UTC,"Mass shootings disappeared yet total homicides either remained the same or went up (1999 being the highest according to AIC), before finally starting falling in the mid 2000's. Is it better that people were not killed with guns? Is it better that there were more people killed separately than less people killed at once?  That same wikipedia articles lists 4 events post '96 that should be considered mass-murders. 3 deliberately lit fires that killed 15, 10, and 10(possibly 21) and a shooter in 2002 that shot 7 people (but only 2 died, lucky for our mass-shooting count).  But getting back to the original point. Those gun laws didn't have an impact on the Australian quality of life, didn't dramatically slow homicide rates and (according to stats on paper) didn't do anything that wasn't happening anyway."
Ameristralia,2cccgn,brandonjslippingaway,1 point,Fri Aug 1 23:39:35 2014 UTC,"How do you know that the murder rate wasn't set to trend upwards during that time before the policies went through? A lot of factors influence the crime rate (a point most frequently put out there by people who do not want restrictions of that nature) and there's not much to say it wasn't about to head up.  Saying every attempted homicide would be successful with knives, fists, poison, or otherwise, rather than firearms seems to be a bit naive in my opinion. Guns are very fast and effective at causing harm. In addition, since the legislation passed, suicide figures have been lower and number of mass shootings (by which I mean shootings in which 3 or more people are shot in succession) have been almost a non issue."
Ameristralia,2cccgn,bcrabbers,1 point,Fri Aug 1 20:17:25 2014 UTC,"How do you know that the murder rate wasn't set to trend upwards during that time before the policies went through?    Are we guessing on hypotheticals here? What I am commenting on is that stats show the firearm-related homicide rate was trending down pre gun ban (and continued on the same path after) and total homicide rate didn't fall till years later. That's historical data. We can take guesses at how many homicides didn't happen, but we're simply reversing the debate that happening in the US (""How many crimes are not committed due to people carrying guns?"" It's impossible to measure events that don't occur.)   Saying every attempted homicide would be successful with knives, fists, poison, or otherwise, rather than firearms seems to be a bit naive in my opinion.   Agreed, but that's not what I'm saying and that's not what the stats are about. I didn't state the number of ""attempted"" homicides, I stated the total number of homicides. After the gun ban, gun-related murders declined but total murders did not change. I'm also not talking about suicides as that is a separate issue.   mass shootings ... have been almost a non issue. You're right when you say mass shooting are a non issue. Since '96 there has not been one mass shooting event. Of course, in 1999 there was the highest number of murders on record (according to the AIC), but at least they weren't all shot at once."
Ameristralia,2cccgn,brandonjslippingaway,1 point,Fri Aug 1 20:59:16 2014 UTC,"It seems to me, you've got to speculate on at least one unknown factor- in the actual time line, or in a hypothetical one. Now seeing as crime rates are of course subjected to many variables, you could posit numerous reasons for why that happens. However, I do not think viewing crime as only a statistic helps when considering regulation of firearms. Each crime occurs under different conditions which of course makes it hard to quantify for the purpose solidifying an approach to tackling the problem. Perhaps restricting firearms seems a practical approach because it's the most tangible proactive move that can be taken. It creates certain differences in expectations in public environments.   And now ""at least they weren't all shot at once."" You're damn right about that. How much worse could many of those instances of criminality be if those with ill intent had an automatic weapon handy? I would suggest considering your crime rates are significantly higher, that fear of retaliation doesn't phase as many people being armed encourages.  In society gun massacres may be outliers, however the impact on outliers like those incidents I believe offer a potential insight into the benefits of regulation as a whole in areas harder to quantify.  Even after a sweeping legislation could be passed, it would naturally take time to phase guns out both practically and culturally and this is both why the U.S would have trouble adopting something like this and also why it took time for homicide and gun related homicide to fall here.  But my main point to you was something like this; ""if the majority of guns in America were to suddenly vanish, do you really believe all the murders that were to take place otherwise, still will through other means?""   Now I know guns can't just vanish over night, but I do believe there's some merit in that idea."

I actually totally agree with you here.   And now ""at least they weren't all shot at once."" You're damn right about that. How much worse could many of those instances of criminality be if those with ill intent had an automatic weapon handy?    With this, I disagree. If 20 people are going to die, would it be better for them to be murdered one at a time by 20 different people? In the former, you have 20 different murderers out and about. At least in the latter, it's only one, albeit a more tragic, single situation. But that's only to explain the differences in comparing times of mass murders to times without. It's total change we need and I know we're in agreement there. (I won't worry about addressing you comment on automatic weapons. They are already banned in the US and are not an issue anyway.)   In society gun massacres may be outliers, however the impact on outliers like those incidents I believe offer a potential insight into the benefits of regulation as a whole in areas harder to quantify.   But should we create laws based on outlying events? Should we make massive changes to traffic laws and licensing because of the outlying 20-car pile-ups or should we look at how individual drivers are being trained and educated and make sure measures are in place to ensure everyone who owns a car is able to operate their vehicles safely without endangering those around them?    But my main point to you was something like this; ""if the majority of guns in America were to suddenly vanish, do you really believe all the murders that were to take place otherwise, still will through other means?"" Now I know guns can't just vanish over night, but I do believe there's some merit in that idea.   The opposite also holds true. Many people in the US who own guns do so for self defense (and there are regular occurrences of defensive gun use (/r/dgu). If all guns were to simply disappear, how many new crimes would take place due to victims who are unable to defend themselves? It goes both ways. We can't say one way or another what murders would still take place, but what we do know is that violent people will use whatever means they can to overpower others, with guns or otherwise. A gun, however, more than any other weapon, is an equalizer. A gun is still as powerful regardless of who holds it and while there are bad people with guns, let's hope there are good people with them as well."
Ameristralia,2cccgn,blackeyedcheese,2,Fri Aug 1 22:39:17 2014 UTC,"Nah, gun crime has actually dropped quite a lot in the US since the 90's.

Stein of the U.S. 404th Signal Company left the hotel where he had been drinking when it closed at 6:50 pm and began walking to the Post Exchange (PX) on the corner of Creek and Adelaide Street some 50m further down the road. He had stopped to talk with three Australians when Private Anthony E. O'Sullivan of the U.S. 814th Military Police Company (MP) approached and challenged Stein for his leave pass. While Stein was looking for it, the MP became impatient and asked him to hurry up before grabbing his pass and arresting him. At this the Australians began swearing at the MP and telling him to leave Stein alone. American MPs were not well regarded by Australians as they were notorious for their arrogance and use of batons at the least provocation. When O'Sullivan raised his baton as if to strike one of the Australians, they attacked him.    One private is a prick to another private, Aussies call him a cunt, fight battle breaks out."

Most things you'll probably be better off replacing when you get here, but to better judge you might wantto check out some Australian web sites for prices.  I can tell you that bicycles are very expensive here. If i were doing it again, I'd ship a couple of new racing bikes a sell them off down here for an amazing profit.  For a price ckmparrision try theses sites. : (note that GST is included. In the advertised prices.  Jbhifi.com.au  Tvs., stereo equipment, music, movies and home appliances  Cplonline.com.au  Computer gear  Will add more later Note that you can get a region-free blueray or Dvd to play your US region movies but a Dvd player is easy to pack id bring yours provided it takes 220vpower.  Ditch anything that doesn't accept 220 v power.  You can get stepdown transformers if you must but they are bulky and a pain.  I beleivethat you don't have limits on alcohol, tobacco and the like when you first immigrate but check the relevant websites.  I'm on my tablet or I'd post acouple. Since you're moving here I'm sure you know them. Smokes are super expensive ~25aud for a pack."
Ameristralia,2ajg0k,squished_frog,0,Sat Jul 12 22:29:11 2014 UTC,110v you mean? 220v is for large appliances like stoves and your washer/dryer.

Ameristralia,2ajg0k,HeinrichGustav,6,Tue Jul 29 05:47:47 2014 UTC,"I know you already know about clothes, but I just want to make sure you really know. I moved from Hawai'i to Sydney in the beginning of 2013, and before that I lived in California, so I can only really compare west coast prices. If you care about name brands, stock up. A current season Ralph Lauren shirt was 89 at Macy's when I left and at the equivalent department store here the exact same shirt was 179. Levi jeans were 20-50 state side and 100-200 here in Sydney unless you find sales. You could even bring over a bunch and sell a few for profit. (Not sure of the legality of that)   The best thing I did was bring over comfortable underware and socks in bulk. They are better made and much cheaper in the US. Also dress shirts and business suits. You can get a decent suit at Macys or Nordstroms for a third of the price for the equivalent here.   Computers and new phones are a little bit more expensive, but the wage/salary difference more then makes up for it. Don't expect ridiculously good deals on phones with contracts over here, if you want a quality phone you will have to pay for it one way or another. They will add the price of the phone on top of your service contract (eg $60/month service + $19/month phone) and they will tell you that you have a minimum spend with them of 1600-2100 with them before the phone is yours. Even if you buy your phone here, buy it independently and then shop for your phone service. That way you also get the added bonus of not having the shitty bloatware installed.  Yes, alcohol is more than double the price, but it is kind of on par with the rest of the cost of living increase such as rent, utilities, gas, lunch, etc. Surprisingly dairy, meat, and bread were similar if not cheaper than what I was used to in Honolulu.   Don't forget lots of socks and underware. I'll say it again and again. Cheap socks over here fall apart in a month or two, and quality socks are expensive."

Ameristralia,2afm56,Sdison,3,Sat Jul 12 06:29:13 2014 UTC,Use AirBNB. I've stayed and hosted through it and it's great. If you get a cool host they'll probably be flexible and let you stay as long as you need to.   My partner and I hosted an Italian couple in April doing the same thing as you and I think they really appreciated having a local to get advice from as well.
Ameristralia,2afm56,motorcycle-manful541,3,Fri Jul 11 21:53:27 2014 UTC,"Go to Kings Cross, there are a lot of hostels there and most of them do weekly rates in the $150 range (maybe more because you will be closer to high season). Check out Chili Blue or The Palms Backpackers.  Get a phone and get on Gumtree. Have a resume and make sure that you mention you are a native English speaker whenever you apply to a job. Texting a short summary of your resume usually works better. You should be shooting for at least $16/hr. but $20/hr. is closer to what you need to save any money."

I'm proudly from an area called the Inner West which represents suburbs such as marrickville,  Dulwich hill, Leichhardt, Petersham,  Newtown etc. It's a great place to live as it is really developing a multicultural bohemian style vibe while distinctively Sydney. Marrickville is where I'm from and we have great Vietnamese and Greek restaurants along with the best thai food outside of Newtown. Hope you consider our town!"

Performing arts and sports-centric schools are also a preference."
Ameristralia,2adxjc,bcrabbers,3,Fri Jul 11 15:34:16 2014 UTC,What are your personal circumstances e.g. Family. Where will you work (commuting in Sydney bites and needs to be minimized). Are you a beach person? A bush person? An arty person?
Ameristralia,2adxjc,whatsupskip,3,Fri Jul 11 08:42:04 2014 UTC,"It's me, wife, and three primary-school-age kids. I'll be working just a block from the Opera House in city center (may not be calling these things by their proper names).  My priorities are as much house for my money as I can get (bigger is better), we live in Florida now in Orlando, which is an hour from the beach. So being on the water isn't really a priority, but would be a bonus for any potential place (would prefer it, but not a top priority by any means).  Really my biggest priorities are safety, good schools, a good neighborhood crawling with other kids, and as much house as I can afford."
Ameristralia,2adxjc,whatsupskip,3,Fri Jul 11 15:31:32 2014 UTC,"We are an active family, and I'd love for their to be lots of sporty activities for the kiddies within walking distance (courts, fields, playgrounds, etc.).  Sports are my thing as well, so the more soccer fields in the area the better, for me and for my kids."
Ameristralia,2adxjc,bcrabbers,3,Fri Jul 11 15:32:59 2014 UTC,"Working in the city CBD makes things much better for you. (if we were to qualify whereabouts in the city your office is, we might say City North, but not North Sydney which is the other side of the harbour bridge and sort of a second business district).  Good and bad suburbs track pretty closely to the household income stats.   http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/04/18/1226623/850500-sydney-income-map.jpg  School quality also tracks closely the income areas at an primary school level (because of the small area they draw from, the kids will be from a similar area) - once you move into High School, they vary more widely because of the larger draw area putting rich kids and poor kids into one school which can drive a lot of conflict and distraction from education.  House prices are mainly driven by the intersection of two factors, proximity to the sea, and now even more, proximity to the CBD.  Note - personal crime (muggings, assault) are not much of a problem anywhere in Sydney.  Property crime (car theft, theft from cars, burglary) are more of the thing to worry about as income levels drop.  I live in the Sutherland Shire, and think it is the best part of Sydney (as all Shire residents do, and cop a lo of derision from the poor unfortunates that live elsewhere for it).  I think you will be disappointed at the size/quality of housing here compared to the US.  In established areas (i.e. those closest to the CBD and Sea) houses tend to be smaller, but on larger blocks.  the big 'McMansion' areas are a long commute from the city, around Campbelltown, Blacktown, and Kellyville, and usually big houses squeezed onto small blocks.  Most professional expats tend to migrate towards the Eastern Suburbs, Randwick, Maroubra, Matraville.  They are a pretty good mix of proximity to the city, good environment, and good culture, but very expensive because they are highly desirable areas.  a 40 minute commute is about the minimum for most people living with a family in a house.  Sydney roads suffer from terrible congestion, and our public transport system is better than none (see what I did there).  Somewhere on the trainline is best.  The Eastern Suburbs are mostly served by bus, which isn't as fast or reliable.  Parking in the city is very expensive, but still the way a lot of people (especially from the Eastern Suburbs get to work).  The Inner West is gaining in popularity because it got the the point where, an affordable new house was such a long commute, people were willing to sacrifice space and environment for proximity to the CBD.  Living there is a trade off between those two things, and the prices are sky high there as well.  Often the suburbs border a low income area, so crime can be a little out of step for the area.  I would only suggest you avoid what is known as the South West, but more specifically areas around Bankstown, Liverpool, Fairfield, Auburn and Granville.  They are the lowest income areas, with the highest number of low income immigrants, their disaffected youth, and highest personal crime.  Personally, I would also stay away from the Northern Beaches (Dee Why, Colaroy), because they just don't seem to have an easy way to get into the City - it is all busses on congested roads.  Manly might be an exception because of the Ferry, but I'm not sure.  Last thing - I hope you are on a good Salary - PM me if you want to discuss in private.  Sydney is about the most expensive city in the world to live so to support a family well, you need a very high income."
Ameristralia,2adxjc,lizardking91,2,Sat Jul 12 00:11:38 2014 UTC,"Oh, I should mention that I'd be willing to make an epic commute for the right neighborhood/area for my family. I currently commute minimum of 45 min each way here in Orlando. Just so long as my commute isn't worse than that I should be fine.  I'm actually looking forward to a decent commute by public transit (ferry, train, bus, whatever)... I'm a big reader and I rarely have time for much pleasure reading nowadays, so I'd love to get in some regular reading time during my commute."

Ameristralia,2abmtl,stepox,2,Fri Jul 11 01:31:53 2014 UTC,"Prosopagnosia:       Prosopagnosia (Greek: ""prosopon"" = ""face"", ""agnosia"" = ""not knowing""), also called face blindness, is a cognitive disorder of face perception where the ability to recognize faces is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g., object discrimination) and intellectual functioning (e.g., decision making) remain intact. The term originally referred to a condition following acute brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia), but a congenital or developmental form of the disorder also exists, which may affect up to 2.5% of the population.  The specific brain area usually associated with prosopagnosia is the fusiform gyrus,  which activates specifically in response to faces. The functionality of the fusiform gyrus allows most people to recognize faces in more detail than they do similarly complex inanimate objects. For those with prosopagnosia, the new method for recognizing faces depends on the less-sensitive object recognition system. The right hemisphere fusiform gyrus is more often involved in familiar face recognition than the left. It remains unclear whether the fusiform gyrus is only specific for the recognition of human faces or if it is also involved in highly trained visual stimuli.

I take whatever it is back, explain the problem and if I'm in a hurry I'll ask for a replacement, if not I basically let them chose their preference.   Don't usually ask for refunds because I basically only buy what I 'need' so if it breaks I still need one and I've normally researched well enough that I've bought the best one for the job, but was unlucky and got a dud.

While diverse in the amount of variation available in the dance, b-boying consists of four kinds of movement: toprock, downrock, power moves, and freezes. B-boying is typically danced to hip-hop, funk music, and especially breakbeats, although modern trends allow for much wider varieties of music along certain ranges of tempo and beat patterns.

I think part of the reason we Americans can have such a seemingly inflated sense of patriotism is that because we never hear anything good about America (other than outlets like this). We always hear how racist America is, how much we hate poor people, how we are an empire hungry for oil, etc, etc... We realize we have our faults but goddamn, do people (even our very own!) act like we are the most vile country to ever have existed. So, some of us feel that our country (not necessarily government) deserves some praise and cheerleading because, despite our flaws, we are overall a fantastic country. Hopefully our southern friends can relate."

Ameristralia,29ty1d,WilhelmXVI,7,Fri Jul 4 16:53:02 2014 UTC,"First of all, a motorcycle accident in which you were not at fault isn't going to cost an American $100,000 either.  It is going to cost the at fault party's insurance whatever it costs them, up to and including your insurance company's lawyer's fees.  Barring that it will cost you your deductible for uninsured motorist coverage up to whatever amount they will pay.  Though I understand the point you are trying to present, perhaps a better example would have been an uninsured person without homeowner's insurance falling off their own roof or growing ill.  With regards to the costs of higher education, student loans, their immunity to bankruptcy and other problems in that area there is no doubt that there are some problems.  But that is not to say that education is inaccessible.  However obvious the liberal lenses through which you see these matters, it falls to the same problem by and large that the Democratic party has today in the North.  These solutions propose paying off the people and masking the symptoms while ignoring the root causes of the problem and allowing them to go unchecked.  You say it cost you $16 to recover from your injury as if all that matters is what came out of your pocket.  But you also will pay a certain amount of your income every day of your life whether sick or ill.  How long will it take for that to actually equal the cost of your injury's care?  To surpass it?    It goes beyond that here in the states.  We believed ourselves a land of individual opportunity and with that we expected individual responsibility.  We don't care if a bunch of people get together and want to help each other if anyone gets sick.  Some of us just don't want to be forced into that group.  For the last 4 years we've been bickering over a bill that changes on a president's whim but not by anyone else's. As if we have the liberty to stand still any longer.  Me?  I'd much rather we attack the trunk of the tree than prune the branches.  Fight drug and medical device patent extortion.  Fight the exorbitant costs associated with malpractice insurance and the litigious attitude that equates the slightest fuck up to a lottery ticket.  Fight the root causes of why we are so unhealthy in the first place.  Fight the employment epidemic that has caused so many to be uninsured at all.  If everyone was able to get a good job with benefits and hold it, do you think this would be nearly the deal it is?  Instead people like you and many of my fellow countrymen say, ""Who care's what it costs them as long as it doesn't cost me.""  That is unsustainable, and for as much trust our government has earned I certainly don't trust them with more.  For the life of me I don't understand how people can feel such hatred towards these big corporations that ""fleece & abuse"" us while begging to have their health care controlled by their golfing buddies and investors."

Ameristralia,29ty1d,blagojevich06,5,Fri Jul 4 19:10:30 2014 UTC,"And if I'm not mistaken the case I made is actually to help them not be poor, not to make it so being poor is ok because you get free food, healthcare, and cell phone.  That doesn't make being poor much better.  I am not sorry to admit I have a problem trusting our government with money management, and being forced into allowing them to manage more and more of mine.  If they showed some fiduciary responsibility with that money it would be an easier pill to swallow.  Or at least it would be free I guess.  And while I personally do care about the poor even if my methods may differ from yours, I certainly have no liability to subsidize someone else's random chance, bad luck, or poor choices.  I don't expect that for mine, and I've had my share.  It is also a false equivalence indeed to try and paint me with a demonic brush as if not wanting to do one thing to help certain people means I don't want to do anything to help those people."

Rest assured that not all of us a biggoted ""America first-ers."" Some of us are working really hard to try to change the things we feel need work in our country, and would dearly love to see our tax dollars spent on universal health care and education instead on on having the biggest motherfucking and most useless god-damned army in the world. Alas, change is hard and large corporations, especially defense contractors, have an iron grip on our elected leaders. Since our Supreme Court seems determined to make money the only viable political currency in the U.S., changing how politicians get elected and how much they are influenced by wealthy corporations is unlikely to happen in the near future.

As you get a little older, and start drinking (most people between 16-18), you all get together somewhere and get hammered, with all sorts of merchandise covered in Australian flags.  As you then mature, you make the most of the other events on the day. There's always a game of cricket on, so you can go to the game, or go watch it at a pub (most will have an Australia Day event, drink deals, meal deals, live music etc), or at home (usually a part of the family BBQ as well. Also, almost everyone listens to the Triple J Hottest 100 -- a countdown of the top 100 songs of the past year, as voted on by almost everyone as well. It's usually quite good, and streamed worldwide, I'd recommend giving it a whirl.  For me (I'm in my mid 20s) I'd get together with a bunch of mates, go to someone's place (pool essential) watch the game, listen to the hot 100, and drink more beer than could ever be recommended.

See almost all of the rest of the pacific were administered by either South Ameristralia, or south East Ameristralia.   A couple are still aligned to the Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys, but the less said about them the better.   About the only exception is Samoa. Samoa, aka Western Samoa is aligned with South East Ameristralia, American Samoa is aligned with North Ameristralia, mostly through it's close tied to Hawaii.   I.e in Western Australia, they are in the same time zone as South West Ameristralia. Fly 30mins to American Samoa and they are the 24 Hours back in time.   In Western Samoa they drive on the left hand side of the road, in American Samoa, the right (aka the wrong).  In Western Samoa they live and breathe Rugby, in American Samoa Gridiron.

Ameristralia,26m0kc,SunMoonTruth,3,Tue May 27 15:40:41 2014 UTC,"Fatback:       Fatback is a cut of meat from a domestic pig. It consists of the layer of adipose tissue (subcutaneous fat) under the skin of the back, with or without the skin (pork rind). Fatback is ""hard fat"", distinct from the visceral fat that occurs in the abdominal cavity and is called ""soft fat"" and leaf lard.  Like other types of pig fat, fatback may be rendered to make a high quality lard, and is one source of salt pork. Finely diced or coarsely ground fatback is an important ingredient in sausage making and in some meat dishes.  Fatback is an important element of traditional charcuterie. In several European cultures it is used to make specialty bacon. Containing no skeletal muscle, this bacon is a delicacy.

Ameristralia,26m0kc,ShadowRancher,8,Tue May 27 15:37:59 2014 UTC,The flavor of meat is mostly from the fat. Marbled meat is much better tasting than a leaner cut (In my opinion).
Ameristralia,26m0kc,DVSsoldier,4,Tue May 27 16:14:48 2014 UTC,"American bacon doesn't strike me as being marbled meat as much as it's fat. Cooked right it's tasty for sure but it's not really marbled meat. Australian bacon doesn't have to be crisped as much in the cooking though when the rind goes crispy that adds a whole new level of flavor. The meat itself is very tasty. Think loin but with some fat making it different to Canadian bacon, which IMO, is way too lean."
Ameristralia,26m0kc,Simplerdayz,6,Tue May 27 16:36:42 2014 UTC,"Oh that part is great, but the fat seems to drain away on American bacon if you cook it crispy; the popular way in Australia."

Ameristralia,26fqwy,blagojevich06,3,Sun May 25 15:54:37 2014 UTC,"Make sure to check out something on Broadway (or off Broadway) while in New York! If you wander around Times Square, some guys with ipads might offer you discount off Broadway tickets. Do it. My dad and I saw Avenue Q for about fifty bucks a ticket, and it is to this day one of my favorite plays.  And if you're there in NY in a Sunday, check out the Upright Citizens Brigade. It's an improv comedy group that's fairly famous. Several people from Saturday Night Live have come from there, like Tina Fey. On Sundays, they offer a free show, but you just have to get in line pretty early.  If you do make it down to San Diego, PetCo Park is a really gorgeous stadium, even if you don't like baseball. Sea Kayaking is a lot of fun, and you might see a lot of tiger sharks (at least, I think they were tiger sharks, I can't quite remember now). Miramar AFB has a really incredible golf course if you're into that, but I'm not sure if they let civilians in. Look into it if you're interested.  Chicago also can have some really incredible plays happening as well. Make sure you go up in the Willis/Sears tower, the view is worth it. Navy Pier is pretty famous as well, but I don't think the Ferris Wheel there is worth the ride. Rogers Park near Loyola University has a really cool wall on the beach that gets painted over every year by the citizens. There are a ton of music venues, so even if lolla didn't interest you, I'm guessing you can find some artist that does. If you like amusement parks, Six Flags Great America is really close, and they just put in a new roller coaster this year. Michigan Ave. is great for shopping. Museum of Science and Industry is always interesting. Shed Aquariam to look at some fish.   Lots of stuff to do everywhere you're going :)"
Ameristralia,26fqwy,blackmajic13,2,Sun May 25 14:27:31 2014 UTC,I would add to Chicago the Art Institute and Field Museum. Those are two of my favorite places in the world. I can get lost for hours and hours in either one. :)

I settled on Comedy Cellar, but I think I should be able to squeeze some more comedy into my trip :D  I wasn't aware there was a Six Flags nearby! I'll definitely look into that!  Thanks for all of your suggestions, they're really helpful."

Ameristralia,26fqwy,azgeogirl,5,Sun May 25 11:20:32 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I have heard big things about the countryside. I plan to drive from San Francisco to Lake Tahoe and then from Vegas I'll be driving out to Hoover Dam and also up to Zion National Park. I know that's not really very much, but I thought it might be a good option for my first trip over."
Ameristralia,26fqwy,azgeogirl,3,Sun May 25 11:41:10 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind that you will be in Zion during the busy season.  If you do the Angel's Landing hike it will be full of people; crowded but still a great view.  If you want to get away from the masses.  Head up to the northern end of the Park to the Kolob Canyon entrance. I do also recommend making the drive up to Lava Point.  It is the highest elevation in the park, with a breath taking view looking south over the park."

If you want to burn an entire day see if you can take a trip out to Catalina Island (It's a bit of a boat trip). Disneyland, Hollywood, Go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, or King Taco. Check out old Town Pasadena, Long Beach, Venice Beach, Santa Monica, I mean there's billions of things you could see/do especially depending on what you're into.   The biggest problem you're going to have is going from one end of the city to the other. Also, make time to go down to San Diego, it's worth it.

Ameristralia,26fqwy,Palindromer101,2,Thu May 29 03:25:54 2014 UTC,"I used to live in New Orleans, so maybe I can be of some help here.    walk around the French Quarter. Take in the sights, sounds, smells, do some people watching. You will not find bad food. Jackson Square has a couple of museums around it that are loaded with history about the area. There is also a wax museum and a voodoo museum in the Quarter. Have breakfast at Cafe du Monde. In the evening, head to Bourbon Street for some serious fun. Lots of great music, even more alcohol, and some interesting people. take a ride on the Natchez head uptown on the St. Charles Streetcar (made famous in the play Streetcar Named Desire). Your destination is the Garden District. Again, this is a place to walk around and take in the sights, sounds, smells. There is a cemetery right in the middle that is one of the famous ""Cities of the Dead"": Lafayette Cemetery. If you are a fan of the author Anne Rice, this will be like walking through one of her books. if you are into sports you can visit the Superdome. City Park has lots to do: art museum, botanical gardens, Storyville, an amusement park, and the list goes on. If you are going to be renting a car you can head to one of several nearby plantations: Oak Alley and Destrehan are probably two of the more well known.   There is so much more, but since you will be there for a short time, I have listed the main attractions that most people try to see when they are there. If you can squeeze in another day or two there, I would highly recommend it. It is such a unique place in America, it would be a shame to miss anything. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did when I lived there. :)"
Ameristralia,26fqwy,chijourno,2,Sun May 25 18:01:01 2014 UTC,"Holy shit. Your help is so appreciated.  I don't think I'll have a minute to spare in New Orleans now!

Ameristralia,26diyd,kepaa,6,Sat May 24 13:54:43 2014 UTC,"Mate I'm gonna help you out as best I can. First of all there are two kinds of rugby. League and union. I will assume you played union as it's the most popular version globally. Union is the version that the wallabies, all blacks and springboks play and the movie invictus is based on. In South ameristralia it is most popular at international level. Below that there is Super Rugby where teams from South new zanada, South ameristralia and South Africa ( and soon Argentina, which could be great for you time zone wise) play one another. It's not widely popular here though. Don't get me wrong there are people who love it but at the moment it is in the periphery of Australian sport. As it is the teams here in South ameristralia are the Queensland reds (Brisbane), New South Wales waratahs (Sydney), Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Brumbies (Canberra), Melbourne Rebels and western force (Perth). The brumbies and reds are the two most successful South ameristralian teams (the Canterbury crusaders from Christchurch NZ being the most successful league wide).  By comparison league is a game played predominantly in Eastern South ameristralia, Auckland NZ, Northern England (Leeds/Manchester area) and to a fanatical but low publicity extent Papua New Guinea. The major competition down here is the NRL which has 15 teams in South ameristralia and 1 in Auckland New Zealand. In my opinion it is a faster paced game with more tries and excitement but it should be said the technical aspects of scrums, rucks, line outs and other features have been reduced in order to speed the game up. Teams are given a set of tackles (similar to downs) each possession so that should be easy for you to follow.  In terms of teams well both Melbourne and Brisbane have 1 each, the storm and broncos respectively. Sydney, being where the competition started 100+ years ago has 9 teams. Back to the storm and Broncos they are both young clubs as they are both less than 30 years old but both have had success though with some controversy. Between 1988 and 2006 Brisbane won 6 premierships (championships) and as the first club/team in Qld they have an enormous following. By comparison Melbourne has never been as enamoured with either rugby code so their fan base is relatively small (Melbourne prefers Aussie rules football, so the storm and indeed the rebels are like the LA Kings in hockey) but they too have had success winning 4 premierships since 1997(ish). HOWEVER it was discovered that they won two of their premierships with an illegal roster (they cheated the salary cap) so they were stripped of two of their premierships (2007 and 2009) but they have since won a premiership in 2012 (to the chagrin of other clubs supporters).  On top of all this state of origin starts this Wednesday. It is a best of 3 series of the best players of NSW and Qld, the states where most of the players come from. Sort of like all-star games if the players were extremely passionate about the matches. Qld has been dominant for the last 8 years (and probably this year too :( ) but it is still amazing year in and year out. Here is a highlight reel from the last half a dozen years or so: http://youtu.be/9A-IMC3sZJA Anyway I obviously know tons more about league than I do union so feel free to ask any questions you like about the game and check out /r/NRL for heaps more info.  EDIT: I see you're a kings fan. I would say Melbourne are similar to the kings in that they are in a non traditional heartland of the sport and they are successful at the moment. Be wary though, they are largely disliked by other fans and may potentially slump in 5 or so years. I have a decent knowledge of hockey myself (go wild!) so I'm not completely talking out of my arse here."
Ameristralia,26diyd,Thrustcroissant,3,Sat May 24 17:36:36 2014 UTC,Rugby League or Rugby Union?

Ameristralia,26diyd,Lutheus13,3,Sat May 24 15:20:29 2014 UTC,"I do watch international rugby whenever I get the chance. I was looking for a team to follow during the season. Much like I follow my favorite hockey team. I was doing some research and I just don't get it. For some reason they don't seem to have that kind of structure. They have their international sides. They seem to have lots of club teams, and they have a ""hometown tournament"". That is where players from all over play for their states in a tournament. It just seems weird."

Melbourne Rebels could do with all the support they can muster since no one in Melbourne follows rugby. Brisbane along with Sydney and Canberra are actual places that produce rugby players as opposed to Perth and Melbourne whom just poach them. However, I would recommend you choose a team whose home games are in a time zone most convenient for you.   Teams. And time zones. I suspect for you in the north it would have to be a South African team.   Me, i support the Reds in super rugby and the Springboks in international games."

In fact, just get some sausage meat from the market, butcher or wherever you usually get meat from, throw in your favorite meat spices, add onion and maybe some shredded carrot.  Roll it all in some puff pastry (get the frozen kind, no need to be fancy) and toss the lot into an oven at about 180 degrees Celsius (about 350 Fahrenheit) for 20 minutes or until golden.  You can brush an eggwash over the top if you want to tart them up a bit, but its not really necessary."

Ameristralia,23mk13,6APe9,7,Tue Apr 22 00:46:42 2014 UTC,That is the age old question. Violet Crumble has more of a hard honeycomb compared to Crunchies. Both taste good to me

Vegemite is a fun novelty but for northerners new to southern cuisine the taste is usually a bit shocking.  I also didn't really notice a lot of vegemite in use outside of people's homes when I was in AU.

TimTams - with a TimTam slam! 2. Vegemite - to say that you have tried it. 3. Burger Rings - a burger in chip form. 4. French Fries Chips - basically toothpick style chips (in a packet). 5. Cheds - cheddary cheese crackers. 6. Iced VoVos - the ultimate public servant morning tea. 7. Sweet Chilli, Soy Chicken and Sea Salt - very tangy chips. 8. Cadbury Chocolate - Including the popping candy stuff! 9. Twisties - Cheese chip things. 10. Chokito and Crunchie - More chocolate goodness. 11. Some sort of Shapes crackers - little crackers with stuff on top! 12. Bundaberg Rum - Dark and Stormy - The angry man drink (alcohol)!"

Ameristralia,23mk13,super_toker_420,4,Tue Apr 22 16:31:34 2014 UTC,Less of an acquired taste and more of an inherited taste. Australians are just sort of 'raised' liking it.  A rule of thumb for foreigners; use less.

Even a LARGE amount of Vegemite is still smaller than, say, how much peanut butter you'd put on something. But yeah. Lots of butter, light layer of Vegemite. Try it, and then gradually shift the ratio so that you're lessening the butter and increasing the Vegemite. Don't go overboard, though, as in the end you should still only have a moderately light spread with a decent amount of butter on there anyway. That's the standard for most people.  Some people like more, but I don't think it's actually possible to train a foreigner to like large amounts of the stuff or to be able to eat from the jar. I think those skills can only be possessed by those of us born here."

If you are flying through Minnesota you might want to take a day or two in Minneapolis. Its my home town so I am biased but its a beautiful city with lots of outdoor activities like kayaking/windsurfing on the lakes 2 zoo's a waterfall just south of downtown etc. Along with great museums and music scene.  I lived in seattle for a few years and that city is gorgeous and green. It rarely rains in august and with Puget Sound to the west and the Cascade mountains to the east there is plenty to do outdoors. The music is good and the cafe/coffee scene is one of the best in the world.  San Francisco is great as well. Lots of culture, Wine country is an hour away while Yosemite National Park is 3 hours (traffic dependent) away.  As far as NYC its across the country from the others but well, its fucking New York!

The thought is that while guns can be incredibly dangerous in the hands of irresponsible people, they are also incredibly safe in the hands of the right people.  In this sense, they are no different than cars.  I could go murder an entire school full of children with my car, yet no one thinks twice about letting me drive it, because I'm a responsible person who hasn't committed any crimes with my car (or anything else).  The same rationale applies to guns.  That we shouldn't take the right away from responsible people in the interest of keeping them out of the hands of a very small insane minority.  All of the talk about efficacy and self-defense and all of that aside, for me the argument is one of principle.  That you don't take rights away from people who've done nothing wrong.

My second point was that most regulations here in the north are against firearms such as assault rifles which are built to mow down people. I'd assume that you can't kill hit twenty people in less than three seconds with a pistol. You can, however, shoot a burglar with a knife to your kid's throat with one.

Airplanes I think have been amply demonstrated as capable of serious damage, and yet we haven't banned flying.

Ameristralia,21cwez,Not-Now-John,3,Wed Mar 26 01:44:06 2014 UTC,"May I offer a rebuttal?  With cars, most nations (America and Australia included) have fairly rigorous examinations in order to to their best to ensure that the vast majority of people driving are able to keep themselves and others on the road safe. There is an acknowledgement of the need for safe control on both sides (government and driver), generally.  On the other hand, guns. In America, as far as I am aware, gun control is very lax. There is little-to-no background check, and it is ridiculously easy for people to obtain firearms they do not need in their lives (for most people; I do admit there are people who require firearms). The right to bear arms was conceived for the case that a civilian militia be needed- that is, for those times when the civilians may have to fight in an organized manner to protect their homes and nation. There is no such event going on in America, that so many people should be able to carry firearms around (unlike cars, as in much of America, one needs to be able to drive in order to obtain essentials of life). There is no need to allow so many people to easily obtain firearms- and thusly, the current American gun control laws are fairly outdated for a modern life.   It is therefore the question of the intent behind the gun that is at question. Yes, other deadly objects are allowed to American citizens- but it is also understood by the same citizens these objects are of use for other practical purposes than killing people. Guns are designed primarily for causing deadly wounds to others- and people will inevitably see it as that. Remember Columbine. Remember all the mass shootings that go on in the United States so often- and that other nations, with similar demographics and somewhat similar habits (if not the same net population size), that severely restrict access to firearms tend to have fewer gun-related homicides. A baseball bat will suffice just as well in domestic situations should someone with hostile intent enter your house. A gun will likely result in collateral damage that you don't want.  In all cases, the ease with which Americans can obtain firearms is ridiculous. In any case, the right to bear arms can be there- just for a very good reason, and only a very good reason."
Ameristralia,21cwez,The_Last_Y,5,Tue Mar 25 23:58:16 2014 UTC,"Solid rebuttal, if I may go point by point...   have fairly rigorous examinations...   Unfortunately, this is very much not the case in the US.  It is laughable how easy it is to get a driver's license here.  It's considered basically essential to life to drive here, so any effort to make that more difficult for anyone is met with extreme resistance.  Driving is almost treated like a god-given right.    And contrary to belief, guns do generally require an amount of training.  Any state that allows concealed carry requires a training course and licensing at least as rigorous as that required to operate a car.  I don't need training to have one at my house, but I also don't need a license to keep a car in my driveway.     Guns are designed primarily for causing deadly wounds to others   This is not true.  People do not buy guns here with the idea in their head that someday they're going to use it to kill someone.  People use guns for sport, for hunting, and only for defense in extreme circumstances.  Millions of people have guns, and a trivial minority will ever use them against a person.    But you've brought up a larger point that strikes at what so many people will recoil at here, the idea that it is up to someone else to decide what I ""need.""  I would argue that if I've done nothing wrong, if I've done nothing to betray anyone's trust, then why should I have to justify my actions, my intentions, or my need to anyone?  The same argument could just as easily be applied back to cars, or knives, or pain killers.  Should we really risk you running someone over with your car if you don't ""need"" to be out there driving?"
Ameristralia,21cwez,hojuuuu,3,Wed Mar 26 00:57:22 2014 UTC,"I agree with the driver's license point, I may have fallen into hyperbole in order to stress my point (I admit my guilt). Perhaps there should be stricter examinations behind driving- which is something I am also in favour of.  With the design of guns point, the recreational usage of guns was not something I addressed; the main idea behind that was that guns are so obviously designed (from their very conception) to be killing machines. Sure, they can be used for recreation, and are, in the modern day- but well, this is too minor a point to quibble about.  Alright. If we start questioning the idea that others can tell us what we ""need"", then we could say that we do not ""need"" freedom of speech. We could argue that not every single person ""needs"" certain essentials to life as much as someone else. For items that are essential to life (in general, not just life in America), there are very few restrictions on obtaining them- for good reasons. Are guns essential to life, from any logical viewpoint (assuming the life of an ordinary citizen with extremely little actual violence)? I would argue not, but your view may differ. Cars and pain killers have certain restrictions on them, for obvious reasons of safety and need. Are these abused? Of course they are. But the point still rests that there are attempts to restrict them, which are not being contested greatly. It is the intent behind the contentions against gun control that I would prefer to speak of. The car point- I would prefer not to drive due to the large possibility of physical and/or monetary harm coming to myself and others on the road. However, when I do go to attain my license, I would only do so after I feel comfortable with driving at the level I would be testing for. I can only wish that every single person would exercise similar control with any dangerous artifact, but it is impossible. So would we risk extreme dangers for something we do not logically need to live (life in general, and life in America), or do we continue to not restrict sales of armaments to a greater degree? As I said, if stricter gun control laws were to be put in place, then the right to bear arms would be there, just the same as the right to drive.   I thank you for being logical and rational, and also calm, with your reply.  Edit: I a comma."
Ameristralia,21cwez,Not-Now-John,3,Wed Mar 26 01:19:11 2014 UTC,"This is true, I won't pretend like guns aren't meant to be powerful enough to kill.  Whether hunting or defense, they're meant to either kill, or be capable of killing to the point that they persuade someone to change their course of action.  Were it just a matter of sport, that clearly doesn't require deadly force to bring down a clay pigeon.  I would likewise never argue that anyone ""needs"" a gun for basic survival.  Certainly not me.  It's basically a part of a larger beef that so many of us have with being told what we need and what's excessive, and who has the authority to draw that line.  In this particular instance, it's a gun.  But in another debate, it's how much money one person ""needs"" to earn, or needs to have before we start considering it excessive and saying that they have too much of it.   That's not my own motivation for it quite as much as the idea of basically punishing people who've done nothing wrong, essentially punishing the potential that they could do something wrong.  Because anyone could do something wrong, and I can guarantee that any given driver on the road is more likely to kill someone with their car than I am with this shotgun.  Because I am a responsible person, and I've done nothing to be told that I can't own this gun, which yes, could, however unlikely, save my life someday.    I'm not of the insane type that would say literally anyone who wants to should just be able to walk out of Walmart with a deadly weapon, although honestly I probably should be, because again, I have no problem with people buying knives...so it's difficult to reconcile why I'm ok with someone buy knives on a whim, or a bunch of fertilizer that could be used to make a bomb, but not a gun.  I recognize the value of background checks, restrictions on letting clearly violent people have firearms, and even mandatory education.    However, in my ideal world, we would punish crimes, not the potential for crimes.  Until you prove otherwise, you should be assumed and trusted to be a good person, and if you betray that trust, then we will bring down the hammer of the law upon you for making us look stupid. Just as we don't punish someone for drinking until they actually do something dumb, likewise should we treat guns."
Ameristralia,21cwez,Mr_W0lf,1 point,Wed Mar 26 01:47:48 2014 UTC,"Firstly, I appreciate that you pointed out that it would be ""another debate"" for us to argue the similar matter of how much money one person ""needs"" to earn.  Secondly...  Aye, punishing the potential for a crime is not ideal. However, because such an ideal world is difficult to achieve (due to the inevitable corruption and abuse of powers that always seem to arise), perhaps gun control should be a little more strict than it is in the modern day. Even a small difference could be helpful. And perhaps we could examine rather the psychological factors behind the abuse of guns. In particular, I have issues with how publicized mass shootings are in the modern day- but then again, as you said before; that's another debate for another day.  Also, is it that we are necessarily punishing the potential for crimes? Is it rather not that we are arguing about the reduction of potential for crime? It could just be semantics, but to me, it seems that we're not talking about the PUNISHMENT for the potential to carry out a crime. Rather, we're arguing about whether it's logical to reduce the potential for a crime to occur.   I apologize that I am currently not able to offer more cogent refutations at this moment, I am overly tired at this junction in time to formulate proper logical and organized replies."
Ameristralia,21cwez,Mr_W0lf,2,Wed Mar 26 02:04:19 2014 UTC,"To your point about reducing the potential for harm, that's a valid point, and this then becomes just another example of the same question we ask of just about anything.  Where is the balance between safety and practicality?  Because, going back to cars, we could literally end drunk driving by banning either alcohol or cars.  End it.  No more drunk driving deaths ever again.  So naturally we must admit that at some point we are willing to sacrifice the guarantee of safety when it conflicts with another interest.  On the other hand, we don't just hand people nuclear weapons, so we acknowledge that we're also willing to deny total freedom.  So guns, along with everything else, just become a point on that spectrum, and that's where this debate comes from.  Is it worth the reduction in gun deaths to tell people that they can't have guns, or have to jump through more hoops to get them?  At that point, I think it's just a matter of opinion and culture..."
Ameristralia,21cwez,Mr_W0lf,2,Wed Mar 26 02:11:00 2014 UTC,"So then, we come to ask this question...  To what extent are we justified in restricting gun control with the intent of preserving public safety?

More guns equal more gun crimes, I know that point is debated but I'm not sure you're representing the opposition opinion accurately.   I'm not convinced that the insane minority, as you judge them, would exist in a culture without guns, at least not to the same scale they do now. Since guns serve a mostly recreational role in our culture I don't feel it's a stretch to say we should just get rid of them all in order to prevent a few Grand tragedies."

Yes, more guns does equal more gun crimes. And more cars equals more car crimes. More alcohol equals more alcohol crimes, and more pencils = more pencil stabbings.  Eliminating guns would absolutely lower gun crime, that much should be obvious (although it's not working in Chicago).    You're opening up a serious Pandora's box here if you start saying that we should ban things that are recreational in nature but have the ability to lead to harm.  For example, alcohol.  Pretty much entirely recreational, and directly or indirectly linked to thousands of deaths every year.  Why in the world am I allowed to keep drinking in the face of those kinds of statistics?  Why aren't we doing background checks to make sure we don't let crazy people drink?  The same reason I get to have my shotgun.  Because I've done nothing to suggest otherwise."

It seems like its an extremely common thing because of the shit that CNN spews out on a daily basis, but these are VERY rare occurrences and are no justification for making it harder for law abiding citizens to get firearms. I'm not going to bother having this discussion for very long as you probably have never touched a gun in your life. Regarding background checks, you BET YOUR ASS they do background checks.

Ameristralia,20s4qw,elsiniestro,5,Wed Mar 19 05:25:31 2014 UTC,"Not sure if its popular, but they are usually heavily advertised around the end of Christmas time (for the next Christmas) on the premise that that is when people are most aware of the stress of buying everything. I don't think that people who don't fall for this marketing gimmick would pay for a hamper all at once instead, they would just buy everything they needed at the supermarket at their convenience.  I think the concept of a hamper preexisted this business model as mentioned elsewhere ITT. I don't think that a hamper given away at a raffle would be sufficient to cover the Christmas catering needs of most South Ameristralian families."

I'm getting that this is widely viewed as a rip-off, but I'm still not sure what the concept of a 'hamper' is.    so, christmas is over, you're settling up the bills, thinking maybe you overextended yourself this year, so you think ""okay, the perfect solution to my conundrum is to pay a few bucks a month towards a bundled, pre-selected themed 'gift basket' for next christmas?""    is that what a 'hamper' is?  a sort of lay-away for a bundle of products that are related to each other, that gets delivered to you or a gift recipient, or that you might win as a prise, that may or may not also come with a few cheapo bonus items related to the product (like a 'coke' trivia game that comes with a your order of a bunch of cans of coke)?"

I don't have any American beers to draw comparisons but a brand I could recommend and describe a couple brands I drink. James Squire: is a really nice boutiques style brewing co. They do several beers ranging from a pale ale to a porter and each has a story and distinct flavour. Probably the most expensive but definitely my favourite and popular among a few beer drinkers. Coopers: is one of Australia's last truly owned beer company. They brew in the bottle which makes things cheaper and produces mixed results. They tens to be sold at music festivals and you can almost always find coopers pale on tap in any typical pub. Popular among Uni students as their sparkling ale is almost 1.8 standard drinks in a single bottle. Boags: is a Tasmanian brew that is slightly watery and light but still very tasty. I would say this is pretty similar to Heineken or becks but again I don't have a huge experience with American beers. Tooheys: can be found in every pub everywhere. It's cheap and it's beer and it's not bad. Tooheys extra dry and Tooheys new are my preferred of this brand. XXXX: the only reason they named this beer XXXX is because they weren't allowed to print SHIT on the bottle. Awful, cheap, nasty and not worth it. Not even once    There's a bunch of others like Cascade, Hahn, VB, Melbourne Bitter, the list goes on. The above is just a list of some of them worth trying (or avoiding.) hope that helps."

If you've never been inside one, expect to spend 3 hours in there possibly.  The layout varies slightly from store to store but overall is very consistent. You'll be hit with seasonal items in the front, like now there's winter clothing, then there's electronics though a limited range but the TV's are quite nice and well priced. The home theatre systems are ugly as sin, but some people like that shit.  You have appliances, whitegoods , office supplies, cleaning supplies, automotive, power tools, furniture, books, dvds, games, alcohol...  The food aisles... Man I can't even begin to explain. The meat department is fucking stellar, the selection and quality is just top notch, and you can see the butchers working.   Cheesecakes, apple pies, cakes, they're huge as fuck, and good quality. Bagels and croissants...  I don't even know where to start. Here's the thing. Every person that's ever bitched about having to pay $60 upfront, they've no idea what they've got going for them.  On my first trip in, i recovered my $60 just in buying the esky that i was going to need to buy all the meat, refrigerated and frozen goods.  Honestly, I can't even go into the depth of everything they have, all I can say is trust me and everyone who's been there and seen it for themselves.  They've got pretty much everything. Make sure you grab yourself a hotdog and soda for $2 from the food court on the way out. The hotdogs are huge too."

You're spot in with it being smoky, I had never been able to put it into words. Tapatio is huge in my area. Every Latino person swears by it. But to me it's just pepper juice with preservatives, not much taste and too spicy/hot for me. IMO Valentine adds flavor and spice, which is what salsas are.

Fun semi-related anecdote: I worked with an Aussie dude a few years ago, and one night we took him to Outback Steakhouse. This is a chain of (you guessed it) steakhouses with an Australian theme. We know it's not genuine. The steak is actually not bad.  Anyway, Don is sitting with the rest of us, and when he orders, the waitress gets a look on her face.  Waitress: ""Hah, hah, very funny.""  Don: ""What?""  Waitress: ""Your fake accent.""  Don: ""It's not fake!""  Waitress: ""Uh huh. You don't even do it very well.""  Don and the rest of us: facepalm."

Once popped, take your Toasted bread and spread a generous amount of butter on one side of each of the slices of Toast. Take a small amount of vegemite (seriously, it's not fucking nutella, jam, peanut butter or any of that weak as piss sandwich spread you northerners make) a really small amount, and spread it evenly on the buttered side of the toast until you have a nice black matte finish. Eat the bread with the spreaded side of the toast face down onto your tongue so your tastebuds have the best access (a lot of southern Ameristralians don't do this, but you should develop good habits early) Fucking enjoy your piece of Australia mate here is a good example of what ever little tuckers brekky plate looks like"

E.g: We voted to keep the Queen (sort of, complex issue).  Main reasons why: There's too many cunts here who think you cunts are full of nutjob-right-wing-cunts, maate. South Ameristralia is a long-ass way left of the North. We'd get along with California and WA, but we wouldn't touch the mid-west or Texas with a cattle-prod. Examples:   We think stuff like ""Socialised healthcare"" are basic truths, not something that is arguable. Downgrading from our current system to something as cruel as Obamacare would be an instant vote-loser. Same with gun control. We make California look like the wild west.  We elected a unmarried atheist female. Obama is somewhat right-wing by our perspective. The Republican party comes across as something that should be in the Onion. We get the odd candidate that would be about as right-wing as the republicans, they get ~10% of the vote. Our current prime minister is considered to be somewhat odd because he's actually a practicing Catholic (defined as ""Says he's Catholic in public and goes to church each Sunday""). The previous 30+ years of prime ministers did not claim to be religious. He was considered unelectable until the other party engaged in a six year orgy of back-stabbing."

Ameristralia,1ze7ng,scottevil110,10,Mon Mar 3 01:30:24 2014 UTC,"Yep, always left Santa (he was more known here in the 80s as Father Christmas) a beer and carrots in the front yard for the reindeer. No stocking, just presents under the tree."
Ameristralia,1ze7ng,soundawake,6,Mon Mar 3 03:03:07 2014 UTC,South Australians still call Santa Father Christmas.
Ameristralia,1ze7ng,TragicEther,7,Mon Mar 3 05:23:09 2014 UTC,"Pretty much exactly the same, with maybe less of a focus on cookies and milk etc (but that could have just been my household).  Some families with primarily British backgrounds prefer to call Santa ""Father Christmas"", but Santa Claus is the general name.    You see a lot of greeting cards with ""Australianised"" Santas in boardshorts and shirtless drinking a beer. But that is still in the minority compared to the amount of ""traditional"" Santa imagery.    Santa Claus is largely the same here as in the States, as is a lot of other Christmas traditions. Caroling is quite rare in Australia outside of televised Christimas pageants etc. But we still have all the same holiday specials on TV, same Christmas songs in stores, same cheesy Christmas-themed advertising. Same huge amount of tinsely crap flooding the stores from early November.  The main difference I suppose is the weather (which I guess influences a lot of the activity at Christmas). Being that it is Summer here during the holidays, our idea of a Christmas gathering is more likely to include a cold beer, a game of backyard cricket, a BBQ lunch and a dip in the pool than rugging up or having a snowball fight. It's still an excuse to have a big family get-together with relatives you rarely ever see.    That said, even in winter, it rarely snows in Australia anywhere but in the mountains. My girlfriend and my housemate have never seen snow outside of movies/photos/etc!"
Ameristralia,1ze7ng,elsiniestro,2,Mon Mar 3 04:03:07 2014 UTC,"Oh and as /u/live_rice said, there is still all the ""Santa coming down the chimney"" imagery for kids although most houses here don't actually have chimneys. Older houses do, like my parents house, but in most cases they are bricked up and the fireplaces are purely ornamental."
Ameristralia,1ze7ng,elsiniestro,1 point,Mon Mar 3 04:13:46 2014 UTC,"I don't know about a lot of this, I come from coastal NSW and to be honest there's a lot of Chrissy lights (yes we even shorten the word Christmas) but not so much reindeer and santa stuff (there is a lot just not as much) and I have never seen a Christmas special outside of Doctor Who. I think you're more likely to have the cricket on.  Also correct me if I'm wrong but I think Christmas is still a bit religious up north and it rarely is for families here, more about gathering your family from as far around the island as you can."
Ameristralia,1ze7ng,Crazy-Legs,2,Mon Mar 3 08:23:12 2014 UTC,"I guess by ""Christmas specials"" I just meant Christmas episodes of certain shows etc... they show episodes of The Simpsons or Family Guy set at Christmas, and so on. But I do remember (from the last time I bothered with free-to-air TV) that they would show a couple of Christmas movies and Christmas kids specials ie Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer etc on Channels 7 and 9."
Ameristralia,1ze7ng,elsiniestro,6,Mon Mar 3 23:29:35 2014 UTC,"So all the imagery is the same (at least in my experience). Santas sleigh and all that. We left Santa cookies and milk. Usually some carrots for the reindeer. You can't see a Santa outside because they would die wearing those suits in 35 degree (Celsius) weather. I think a lot of families here left Santa a cold beer. Also talk about chimneys even though I don't think a lot of Aussie houses have them. *edit: Awake Australia time, nice."

Its a public holiday, and for everyone I know, its just about relaxing, spending time with the friends & family you actually like (as opposed to the ones you have to see on Christmas), eating all the leftovers, and drinking copious amounts of alcohol. Best part - all outside!!!  Cricket/beach/pool optional.  It really is my favourite day of the year."

Ameristralia,1ze7ng,unaspirateur,2,Mon Mar 3 07:06:06 2014 UTC,"His was a typo -- definitely the 25th! :)    Usually he looks exactly the same as in American depictions (we all get the same greeting cards etc).

Ameristralia,1yfmd5,autowikibot,0,Fri Feb 21 22:15:50 2014 UTC,"Frankston, Victoria:       Frankston is a suburb of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, located in the local government area of the City of Frankston. It is located 41 km south-east of the Melbourne city centre, near the northern-most point of the Mornington Peninsula. Due to its geographical location, it is often referred to as the ""gateway to the Mornington Peninsula"".    European settlement of Frankston began almost immediately after the foundation of Melbourne in 1835 – as a fishing village serving the early Melbourne township.  The ""village at Frankston"" was officially established after formal land sales took place in 1853, and was named following an official survey of the area in 1854.  It became a suburb within the metropolitan area of Melbourne as a result of the urban agglomeration of the metropolis during the 1980s. Today, it lends its name to the broader local government area of the City of Frankston, and serves as its major activity and administrative centre.  Situated on the eastern shoreline of Port Phillip, Frankston has been a popular seaside destination of Melbourne since the early 1880s.  Today, Frankston Beach is still one of the most popular in Victoria,  and is recognised as one of the cleanest in Australia.   It also hosts the largest annual sandsculpting exhibition in Australia.    Localities within the suburb include: Frankston central business district (CBD), Frankston East, Frankston Heights, Karingal, Long Island, Mount Erin and Olivers Hill. According to the 2006 Australian census, the suburb of Frankston had a population of 34, 457.  The demonym for someone from Frankston is a Frankstonian.

A general rule of thumb is that 1 case of alcohol is a personal use quantity - although travelers are still subject to state restrictions which may allow less.

Ameristralia,1wvzsl,MgFalcon,2,Mon Feb 3 19:52:31 2014 UTC,"The intention of tackling in American football involves trying to stop your opponent from gaining anymore ground forward. So instead of trying to dislodge the ball or just take him down, you try to stop him dead in his tracks by any (legal) means possible. Often involves running at him and hitting him with full force. The pads don't prevent pain, only distributes it and prevents broken bones. It also gives the players a stronger sense of invincibility and causes them to hit harder."
Ameristralia,1wvzsl,-iPood-,-19,Tue Feb 4 11:02:35 2014 UTC,"I've played both, not professionally of course, but the hits are harder in rugby."

At least professional football, anyway. The pads allow players to tackle with a reckless abandon that you simply don't see in rugby. Not saying rugby isn't a tough game, because it certainly is. But, the hits/tackles do not compare."
Ameristralia,1wvzsl,-iPood-,8,Mon Feb 3 19:58:31 2014 UTC,"As a player of rugby league, in the south, (at a semi professional level) I can tell you that we don't hold back. We give it everything we have."
Ameristralia,1wvzsl,potentscrotem,18,Mon Feb 3 20:29:09 2014 UTC,"I should clarify...I don't mean in terms of effort, of course you're giving it your all. Aside from the padding argument, the nature and purpose of the tackles/breakdowns are fundamentally different in the two sports. In rugby, as you know, the tackler's purpose is to change possession of the ball by poaching it from the tackled player, who must release it once he is off his feet. This makes it imperative for the tackler to remain on his feet. In American football (with the downs-for-distance system) the purpose is to stop the defender ball carrier from making any forward progress. Because there is little chance of turning the ball over, American football tacklers are more akin to battering rams, using their own momentum to stop the runner without worrying about their body position afterwords.   Then there is also the danger of being blindsided in American football – quarterbacks and receivers can be so focused on the play down (or up) field that they don’t see or hear the tackler approaching them from behind. Because the offside law in rugby requires the ball carrier to be the lead man on his side, blindside hits are very rare.  Both sports are full contact, but in terms of pure force American football is harder, simply because it can be, since its players are protected by helmets and padding. Rugby would have a similar level of contact if players were protected to that extent.   Rugby though, in my opinion, is tougher on an individual player overall due to the continuous nature of the game, there are no breaks between plays, minimal substitutions and players must continually fight for the ball in rucks and mauls.  edit: defender ball carrier"
Ameristralia,1wvzsl,table3,2,Mon Feb 3 21:20:23 2014 UTC,"You have the sports mixed up. In rugby league there is very little chance for change in possession unless the ball carrier drops the ball from the force of a big hit or the ball is stripped in a one on one situation. When we tackle the purpose is to limit the ground they make, hurt them and tackle them in a way that makes the ""play the ball"" as slow as possible. But yes you are correct about being tackled from behind or the side, that is rare. Rugby is very different to rugby league."
Ameristralia,1wvzsl,cuttlefish10,6,Mon Feb 3 21:26:36 2014 UTC,Rugby is very different to rugby league.   Interesting.  What are the main differences?
Ameristralia,1wvzsl,potentscrotem,4,Mon Feb 3 21:35:58 2014 UTC,"Ill give you a tl;dr for that wiki link posted:  The two most noticeable differences are:   the attacking team, similar to American Football, get 6 tackles per 'set' to do what they can with the ball the ball is NOT contested after a tackle. This one is a bit iffy, as 'dirty'/illegal play can see the ball come out and turned over after tackles without the referee seeing and thus cause a turnover.   Then we get into other key differences, such as the elimination of the ""contested scrum"" now, a League scrum is still contested, but in a much less intense fashion; the ball is only allowed to be hooked by 1 person from each team (the hooker) and you may only push after binding with the other team (although this rarely causes a scrum loss).  This rule allows for less of an emphasis on short, dense players, allowing for a more athletic forwardpack.   Then there is the 10m rule, which is key in this discussion we are having. Once each tackle is made, the defending team (other than two ""markers"") must retreat 10m toward their goal line from where the tackle is made (if the tackle is within the 10m before the defending team's goal line they must get to the goal line itself).   That rule means that players will gain momentum not only in attack from the free running space, but also allows (and demands) the defenders to move towards the attacking team to suffocate them of free running metres. It's because of this 10m rule in Rugby League that you will see far greater hits than in Rugby Union, and also a much better technique for different circumstances of defending. (I know I made a comment about League hits>Union hits, but as a 10year and 8 year Union player I feel I can make that assumption)  Now for our discussion, i'm not an avid watcher of NFL, iv never made time other than yesterday to watch a game, just if it ever comes on the tv when i'm looking for something to watch. But what gets me the most, and what I think is the biggest differing factor between our sports, is that the runners and receivers aren't aware of defenders. In RL/RU, you can be (and most of the time MUST be in order to run a correct line) aware of exactly where the defenders are, but in NFL it seems that they aren't. Now, in my experience of being 'blindsided' by defenders, your body is not ready for the hit, even if you know you're about to get hit a second later, making the hit seem bigger not only to yourself, but also to a third party as it causes a ragdoll effect.   I feel like this is the only reason NFL hits seem bigger, if their balance was a bit better when receiving the ball it could be lessened. But you can never be fully aware of defenders and that is a pretty cool and unique part of the game.  tl;dr the 10m rule in League means that momentum gained by each team closing the gap creates larger hits.  EDIT: here's a video of big hits from the NRL (Australian Rugby League competition) from 2013 if you're interested :)http://youtu.be/Zi6CeVU-WX4?t=18s"

Ameristralia,1wvzsl,Del_lobo,0,Tue Feb 4 00:11:09 2014 UTC,"Argument about being harder is not entirely valid. What about in terms of pain felt on similar hits, most of he guys are not even carying the ball or involved in the direct play whereas rugby leauge, every man is a ball carrier amongst other roles. Surely brute flesh contact vs a hit to your pad or helmet is going to be softer. Again, I have never strapped on the pads myself, but it seems like your likeliness of feeling pain is lessened with the protection added by all that padding. Edit:typo"

The big difference between the rugby codes and American football is when you get tackled in rugby, you keep playing. There's no stopping and slapping butts and high fives and re-setting the line. The game goes on."

With little protective equipment, players sustained gruesome injuries—wrenched spinal cords, crushed skulls and broken ribs that pierced their hearts.

Ameristralia,1wvzsl,EskimoJesus,3,Tue Feb 4 04:08:56 2014 UTC,"The Australian Football League also starts its season soon I believe. For northerners that haven't seen it, I suggest you watch this video. It should give you a good idea of the sport. The simplest way I've heard it explained is that its basically the sport that would exist if you could only draft punters, but they're built more like the other positions."
Ameristralia,1wvzsl,IDoDash,1 point,Tue Feb 4 10:55:15 2014 UTC,"When I was introducing Northerners to Australian Rules (AFL) I would always show them this link. (Or a similar one, there's probably a hundred different videos on YouTube). Aussie Rules is described as a cross between soccer and rugby. I would call some of the hits in AFL bigger than even the NFL or Rugby because of the 360 nature. Very rarely in the NFL would you not see your tackler coming. In the AFL, more often than not you get smashed from all directions, including while you're running backwards.   Not to mention the guys in the AFL may not be as heavy, but most move a bit faster and as a result have the same sort of momentum going in. The game has become a bit more sanitised nowadays to try and protect players (as Rex Hunt mentions at the start) but you'll still see the occasional shirtfront."
Ameristralia,1wvzsl,SigfaNeith,2,Tue Feb 4 01:59:26 2014 UTC,"Very rarely in the NFL would you not see your tackler coming.   That's not true at all. Quarterbacks get sacked all the time with no idea that a tackle is coming (there's a reason the Left Tackle is called the ""Blind Side""). Wide receivers are at the highest risk of not seeing a tackle, and more often than not, they are hit just before, right as, or just after catching the ball with no time to react. Like in this gif.  I also have to disagree with them moving faster than most NFL players. The only players in the NFL that don't run at competitive 40 meter dash speeds are the linemen. And even they sprint faster than most people. AFL and Rugby players can certainly run faster, longer but not at short sprint distances. But many NFL players were collegiate level or Olympic level sprinters (Like the Redskins quarterback).   They're different kinds of athletes, and being able to hit harder (which I undoubtedly believe NFL players do, hence why they where pads and AFL/Rugby players don't) doesn't make you a better one. These kinds of comparisons are stupid."

Ameristralia,1wvzsl,Alcoholic_Satan,7,Mon Feb 3 23:47:21 2014 UTC,"I would think not, in rugby you don't lead with your head as they do in football. They are taught to put body first.

Ameristralia,1wp0ud,Akya,3,Sat Feb 1 22:03:17 2014 UTC,It is awesome for vegetarians to add an umami flavor to sandwiches.    I have a large jar of it shipped to me from Amazon every 3 months.
Ameristralia,1wp0ud,6APe9,8,Sat Feb 1 09:20:58 2014 UTC,Make some toast and apply butter quite liberally. Then put a thin smear of vegemite on. Delicious.  The worst thing you can do is put too much vegemite on. It will taste like shit.
Ameristralia,1wp0ud,tuiznew,3,Sat Feb 1 03:38:54 2014 UTC,I just realised/realized I'm vegemiting wrong. I've not been using butter. I'll try it in the morning

Ameristralia,1wp0ud,Simplerdayz,3,Sun Feb 2 07:15:27 2014 UTC,"It's really quite simple, get some sliced bread, butter one side, add lots or some vegimite, and then layer on cheese.  Put on the other slice of bread then put it into a sandwich press."

Now this doesn't mean they don't have them here, just that I haven't seen them.  What about making S'mores for your friend?  No one I've met here has heard of or had a S'more, and you could bring the graham crackers (not available here as far as I can tell).  Many Pop-Tart flavors aren't readily available either, all the really dessert-y flavors anyway (S'more, Cinnamon, fudge brownie, whatever else they've come up with).  Also, canned pumpkin, interestingly enough...I bet your friend hasn't ever tried a pumpkin pie.  Hope this helps."

A Day where we can Celebrate all the wonderful things we share in common and the things that make our countries speical.  April 15th is about in the middle of Australia Day and Independence Day so it feels Natural.   Celebrate it like we would our own national holidays but celebrate together rather than alone.   Enough years go by and enough people get into this. We could get it recognized as a Joint National Holiday.

No, I just loved that I was expecting somthing thick and malty when I poured it, but it was so delightfully crisp I couldn't get enough of it.  It was that perfect balance I've always searched for in the label I'd call mine. I urge to to try it again after over bitter IPAs and skunky darks had burned out your taste buds over 12 years of diving head first into the world of beer.  It's the subtler ones that surprise you after that.  This was one of them.  Keep searching, and find your own."
Ameristralia,1vqc5b,grshirley,1 point,Wed Jan 22 02:12:35 2014 UTC,As a proud Australian who has just come back to OZ after 5 years in the US unfortunately I've found very little good Aussie beer but that might be because there are so many amazing American micro-breweries I'm comparing them against.  Don't get me wrong - there's plenty of Australian beer that is Ok to drink but in general its all mass produced and lacking soul.

Ameristralia,1vqc5b,SluggaSlamoo,1 point,Tue Jan 21 20:01:23 2014 UTC,"Crown tastes like piss IMO. A good aussie brew on a Sierra Nevada'ish scale would be James Squire or Little Creatures. Heaps more but those are the main ones. I don't think we're as good in the actual micro brewery department, but our middle sized breweries are really really good in comparison. Our mass produced ones I think are pretty bad but a lot of foreigners actually like VB and Fosters/Carlton so I dunno, I can't drink that stuff."

Ameristralia,1vqc5b,adam_logic,2,Wed Jan 22 22:50:37 2014 UTC,You can get Cooper's at a few bars in NYC. Mainly the sparkling ale but occasionally the pale ale which i prefer.  Nearly always in bottles although occasionally places will have the sparkling on tap.    Some of the specialized beer places like Good Beer have them occasionally.  On the left coast there was a wine store a few towns north of Laguna Beach (can't remember where right now and my internet is dodgy).  Where are you?  I could look it up if you are in SoCal.
Ameristralia,1vqc5b,WalkonWalrus,2,Thu Jan 23 05:18:46 2014 UTC,"Also make sure to roll it if you get the bottle.  ""Coopers bottled beers are characterised by their secondary fermentation technique - some yeast remains in the bottle after bottling - thus the bottled beer contains some sediment. There are two schools of thought with regard to the sediment - some drinkers like to mix the sediment throughout the beer by tipping or rolling the beer before drinking, while others prefer to decant the beer into a glass leaving (most of) the sediment at the base of the bottle.""  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopers_Brewery"

Coopers is known for making a variety of beers, the most famous of which are its Pale Ale and Sparkling Ale. The brewery sold 69.7 million litres of beer in the 2013 financial year. It is also the world's largest producer of homebrewing equipment. Its shares are primarily owned by the extended Cooper family, and the company's constitution and classes of shares makes it difficult to sell shares outside the family.

Ameristralia,1vcl1l,supergalacticcaptain,3,Thu Jan 16 16:32:27 2014 UTC,"I don't know if pesticides will work on them, we usually smash them with something long like a bat end or something.  For the mother, I recommend juicing her with WD-40 (an all purpose oil spray), and she'll either suffocate, or just drop on the ground.  Then you can step on her.  For the eggs, I would drop them in a jar, and either seal it and throw it away, or do something, but I don't think you want to smoosh it, the eggs might stay on your shoe, and then hatch in the house like roach eggs.  Either way, check the house crawl spaces for more nests.  If it's an infestation, they either are, or soon will be everywhere.  If that's the case call an exterminator.  It's expensive, but they have sprays that drive spiders away for about 6 months, and although one bite won't kill you, the amount of bites you'll get if you or a loved one will get if you stumble into a nest could be fatal."
Ameristralia,1vcl1l,RogueRaven17,3,Thu Jan 16 19:01:21 2014 UTC,"You could probably get accurate information somewhere, but if you're checking the property for nests, your best bet is anywhere dark, but with a little wind.  Wear thick leather gloves, and watch everywhere you step, and place your hands.  Use a walking stick or something to turn over boards, boxes, containers, anything that's large enough something could scurry out from under to your legs.  Let the hunt begin.  Where I live, they've been known to lounge behind and under toilet lips and such, so check that too, as well as electrical boxes and stuff.  If you find more than 3 or 4 nests you got an infestation.  Also, where I live it is very humid.  Because of this, when I go outside in the morning, and there is dew everywhere, you can see the irregular shapes of the black widow webs.  If there's humidity in your heatwave, I suggest you do that, as misting with a hose might be a bad idea if you guy's heat is causing a drought.  Above all please be careful."
Ameristralia,1vcl1l,puppitmaster,5,Thu Jan 16 19:13:54 2014 UTC,"Alright, about the one time I have something up on a southie. Live in Florida, so spiders aren't really strangers. Bought a used lawnmower, had one of those riding along, put it in a jar and kept it as a pet for a week, while it slowly died cause you know, jar in all. They one day I noticed a web forming up by the little glass panels by my front door. Went out with the industrial bug spray, with the nozzle that shoots about 20ft, basically like hitting a guy with bear mace point blank. So I go out, and yep, one of these pricks is sitting right by my door handle staring at me, so I hit him with the spray. As he's dying, he starts crawling down, seemed normal to me, except that he was crawling to another one that I didn't see, he was going for fucking reinforcements. Little bastard had a friend, so I killed him too, and he started crawling to a small stand we have by our door, which had ANOTHER friend. So all in all, chain reaction of me killing one, and it showing me where the others are hiding, I ended up killing six. Thats right, I had six of those mother fuckers sitting their happy asses right by my front door, but now their dead, and I am happy. Damn near gave me a heart attack though."

Ameristralia,1v9w9n,momomojito,1 point,Thu Jan 16 02:22:36 2014 UTC,Air conditioning in the south is pretty much mandatory in most areas.
Ameristralia,1v9w9n,j03l5k1,3,Wed Jan 15 20:42:08 2014 UTC,"I've been to Winnipeg when it hit -40 celcius. I walked outside and my mucous froze on my nose, which pulled my nose hairs out from the inside, which made my eyes water, which made my eyelashes freeze together when I blinked - which is to say I went outside without covering my face and was instantly in agonizing pain and blind. But you fumble back inside, defrost, abuse your friends for not warning you about the risks of that kind of cold, put a scarf over your face and then plan your routes better to avoid going outside. Vastly better than  Australian heat.  People who live in brutally cold places build infrastructure to make it managable. Australian houses for the most part are freezing in winter - even though on the coldest day of winter where I live, it's still not hitting freezing temperature outside - and stupidly hot in Summer. Airconditioning is generally one or two rooms per house only - and not great at actually coping with the realities of heat. Central air is largely reserved for the ludicrously wealthy as everyone else just toughs it out.  Canadian winter beats the crap out of Australian summer for me. That said, I've worked on a mine in Central Australia where we were averaging above 50 celcius for 6 weeks of summer, and we were seeing peaks of 65 celcius ground temperature. It was however almost zero percent humidity, and for the most part - nobody went outside of the air conditioning for more than 5-10 minutes at a time and everywhere was built to survive the ludicrous weather. That wasn't nearly as bad as summer in a coastal city at 45 degrees. But I'd still take Canadian winter as a preference, as long as I didn't have to personally shovel snow."

Ameristralia,1v3kmn,electricdandan,26,Mon Jan 13 10:13:18 2014 UTC,"Three weeks is plenty of time to road trip the continent coast-to-coast one way. I made a similar trip in '06 when I got out of the service. First and foremost, consider your budget before road tripping. 3-5000 miles worth of gas is expensive and you should expect at least one break down or accident along the way. If it's not in your budget, consider hitchhiking via ride share websites. I haven't done it myself, but I know folks who have. That said, here are my tips.   Hit up Chicago to get the metropolitan trifecta of NYC, CHI, and LA. Don't skip the ""flyover"" states. These really give North Ameristralia depth and context the way the comment threads do for Reddit.   If you do drive, I recommend bringing TWO traveling companions; not one and not more. If you roll alone you will fall asleep at the wheel 150 miles from civilization. Go with one and you'll hate each other's souls before you clear the Rockies. Parties of four or  more develop factions.   Travel with two mates and you'll have someone to vent to when the other one pisses you off. It's the ideal number for reaching consensus. If one of you has a shot at a romantic interlude along the way, you've got a wingman who won't be left twiddling thumbs alone while you skoodilypoop the night away.   On a more practical level, three drivers is great for endurance driving. Your driver on the wheel can have a co-pilot in the passenger seat while the third catches some z's in the back. You can easily pull 24 hours on the road with the right rotation, especially important if you plan on tackling a vast expanse like West Texas.  If you don't have traveling companions right now, get on your social networks. You've got plenty of time to find two co-drivers on sites like Couchsurfing.  When picking a car, go with a mini-van, station wagon, or a proper SUV. These models are ideal for carrying copious baggage and still leaving enough room to serve as an impromptu hotel room should emergency accommodations become necessary.  This last bit may seem obvious, but it's easily overlooked. Bring hardcopy maps and study them beforehand! You don't need to define your entire route in advance, but know where you are going a couple days in advance and know the major roads you're approaching. Spend your time immersing yourself in the local sights and sounds rather than getting lost and confused.  Other than that, be ready to improvise and have fun! We're pretty hospitable here in the north and the road trip is a time honored tradition. Tell folks your story and you'll become instant celebrities for the night. Drive safe and have fun!  Edited for clarity and grammar."
Ameristralia,1v3kmn,BobEWise,2,Mon Jan 13 14:39:13 2014 UTC,"I don't think I'd do the full length of the continent, but I'm pretty sure I'll be getting a car at some point and doing a bit of driving. Doubtfully enough driving to need companions with me.  I have to say though, you've got some amazing insight/wisdom there. The 2 companion rule is bloody genius and I like that you even considered skoodilypoop in the whole process.  I hadn't really though about navigation until this point, but I think you're definitely right about getting some hard copy maps. I'm too dependent on my smartphone.  Oh also, because of your message and a lot of others with the same suggestion - I'm definitely gonna drop into Chicago.  Thanks for all of your help!"
Ameristralia,1v3kmn,combatspork37,2,Tue Jan 14 00:36:26 2014 UTC,"You can do a coast-to-coast trip if you don't want to really see some sights in the big cities and you would rather just travel across the US but if I was visiting another big country, I'd rather just visit a couple of big cities. The ones that immediately come to mind are Chicago, NYC, Miami, San Fran, and Vegas. I'd pick three of those five or four max just because you want to have multiple days in each city. NYC, Miami and Vegas you're gonna find some good electronic night life, more-so Miami and Vegas but there are still definitely some good places in NYC (Pacha NYC is a great place to visit). But yeah so while it can be done, I would advise against cross country, just because if you've never been to the US, it can be more fun to just take in a couple of different big cities."

I've driven through 38 states and some of my best experiences were on the open highway in the middle of god-knows-where. America has such a diverse landscape, making that drive a uniquely American experience. Don't get me wrong, many of the cities were great, but the small towns and beautiful wildernesses in between the cities are some of the most amazing places.  Of the top of my head, some of the best were; Wallace, Idaho; Yellowstone, the NorCal Redwoods, Monument Valley, Southern Illinois, Butte, Montana; The Blue Ridge Parkway and the Adirondacks (to name but a few)."

It gets hot up here like it does down there, and there's a whole lot of nothing to get lost in with no water or gas for a loooong way. Treat it like you would the Outback. Though if you want a truly unique experience, drive through Death Valley National Park in California. 86 meters below sea level with temperatures that reach up to 53 C, with a landscape like another planet.  BBQ: we northerners like our meat, and prepare it different ways across the country. Different cities and states pride themselves on different methods, but they are all good: Kansas, Texas, St. Louis, Memphis... While on your trip, make it a beer and barbeque tour. The two were made for each other!  Talk to people when you get here. Your South Ameristralian accent will make you a hit just about anywhere you go.

I am gonna look into going there now, but don't worry, I wouldn't be flippant about the trip.  We actually have a place down here in the south called Coober Pedy. It's almost always stupidly hot there, so society has gone underground.  I am big on BBQ, big on beer and I am big on meat. I think I'll fit right in.

I wouldn't necessarily suggest that, but you could take the train to see the Grand Canyon! It's seriously amazing. I haven't been, but I once flew over it in a plane and I plan on going someday. Additionally, in my opinion, it's relaxing if you get a state room. You have a way to view the scenery without worrying about paying attention to driving. There are dining cars on the trains, but I would suggest trying to bring your own food, since it'll probably be more expensive. I would suggest stopping in Austin, TX if you take the southern states route (that would be my suggestion since you're flying into California). Some stops suggested: Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, Albuquerque (home of Breaking Bad), Austin (live music capitol of the world), and past that I don't know much since I haven't visited them more than in passing."

You do not have to stay in peoples houses or let them stay in yours you can attend local meetings and meet locals and travellers. Many people meet people at these events and take day tips together or give each other lifts to the next city or meet travel buddies and go off together for weeks. It is what you want it to be and mostly is is people in the same boat as you looking for a friendly face to connect with on a trip.

Ameristralia,1v3kmn,ElTimablo,1 point,Mon Jan 13 23:42:29 2014 UTC,"I've been to beer festivals, but sadly never toured an actual brewery.  My friends and I have gone to the Pechanga Microbrew Festival in Temecula each year since it started (the first one was about a month after I turned 21, which worked out awesomely). Last year it was held July 13, so you'll likely be arriving after it has passed. The date of the next one has yet to be announced, so check around the site to see when it is. For US$45, you get all the beer you can drink and chili and barbecue you can eat for 4 hours. Some amazing local breweries come, and it's also in a casino so you can go gamble afterward. There are also several vineyards in the area if you're interested in wine tasting as well. If you miss the microbrew festival, I highly recommend making a day of biking or hiking in Temecula, followed by a tasting at a vineyard or two, topped off with lunch or dinner at the vineyard's restaurant (any vineyard; in my experience, they're all amazing).    Not sure if Stone is sold down south, but Stone Brewery is in Esondido (just north of San Diego) and they make some fine beer in my opinion. A couple hours north of there is Miller Brewing Company. I have not been to Miller, but I am told they also gave some experimental beers you can try.  My hometown, Huntington Beach, actually has a place called Brewbakers where you can design your own beer by choosing your own ingredients and such. They have all the equipment and ingredients, and you can ferment and bottle it there.  Los Angeles has several breweries. I currently live there and am finally finishing my final semester of uni.  In terms of bars to check out, I've been to tons in the 5+ years I've been able to legally drink. Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood has some interesting places, as well as Hollywood overall. Downtown Fullerton (a.k.a. ""DTF"") has a great bar crawl, as does Old Town Pasadena.  I'd be happy to answer any more questions."

Advice:  1) Choose your location wisely. Cost of living varies widely across the States, but it is overall much cheaper than living in the South. 2) There is no shame in hard labor. I feel like part of the reason so many highly educated people are without work for so long is because they feel it is 'below them' to take a 'less skilled' job. The job market is competitive, and it will take time to find a job in the field you want. Be prepared to work wherever you can get it until you find the job you want."

That's sort of what Houston does - UTH, Baylor, MD Anderson, Rice... people come from all over the world to work at those places.  If you're in another field... sorry to hear that, bud. :("

Ameristralia,1ub06g,cometpants,6,Fri Jan 10 14:35:43 2014 UTC,"I moved from Oz to US (Colorado) about 15 months ago.  Depending on the stage of life you're in (I am married with kids in school), things may look different but it's nothing you can't handle if you plan ahead and manage your expectations.  You'll need a place to live and food to eat straight out of the gate, so you'll need a job or enough money saved. Unless you already have connections, you can safely expect it to take 2-6 months to find a job (others might say longer!). If you can stay with friends/family when you arrive, things will be easier. MUCH easier! But don't bludge off them...contribute to their household or you will wear out your welcome fast. Do whatever you can so you are a blessing instead of a curse (believe me, I speak from experience!)  If you don't have friends or family to use as a landing pad, do your homework and study the areas you are interested in. Zillow.com is an equivalent to realestate.com.au and will give you fairly good mortgage and rental rate estimates. The cost of living varies greatly from state to state. (FYI, Your monthly mortgage payments should not be much more than 40% of your total monthly salary.)  If you don't know where you want to live and have no specific preference, try to find the bigger cities that have a concentration of your skill set. Don't move to a small town. Look for cities where the economy is better than others. Good economy = more jobs and you will need a job like you need breath!  Your travel insurance will cover most major medical emergencies and you can pay extra to keep it valid for a year. That's not a bad idea when moving to a country known for its pathetic healthcare and will tide you over till you get a job that provides health insurance.  As for jobs, glassdoor.com may help you to find salary comparisons for difference industries or positions/companies. Search for jobs on LinkedIn, Indeed.com, etc. even Craigslist will have some decent jobs mixed in with all the shit. Monster.com is popular but I gave gotten NOTHING but spam from them! I personally recommend finding a recruitment agency to help you. Others may disagree, but I have always had good luck with those. Alternatively, start your own biz. Working for yourself has it's merits (as well as it's challenges).  I don't know what else to tell you. If you like the snow, move here to Colorado. If you love the beach, hit up California or Florida maybe.  Start looking into the states/cities you know of - there is usually a reason you've heard of it rather a place like Delaware. I mean, WTF is even in Delaware? (No offence to those from there!).  Oh shit...I nearly forgot about the damn credit ratings. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, here relies on your credit score. It's basically a number that tells whoever how trustworthy you are with money and if it's not high enough you can't borrow shit. And you won't have one! You can't get a car loan, home loan, credit card or possibly a home to rent because, as far as they are concerned, you don't exist.   So, once you get here, go talk to a local bank about what you need to open an account (it will probably include having a social security number and proof of address). Then open an account and start making deposits. Then you can ask them about opening a credit-starter credit card (like a credit card for babies with a really low limit). Regularly using 10% of your limit and paying it off completely every month will help you create a good credit score. I recommend talking to a financial planner or a mortgage lender. They know what it takes to get a good score and will help you to do so. The good news is, no credit is better than bad credit. So you have that going for you.  Feel free to ask anything else. I'll try to help. Best of luck with whatever you decide!"

Ameristralia,1ub06g,Kurtcm81,1 point,Fri Jan 3 13:42:25 2014 UTC,"The big thing is to get some practical experience beyond academic to get your first job.  Once you have your first job there are all sorts of things you can do with computer science.  Thing is the IT/Dev industry in the US doesn't actually give much of a damn for your degree, they want people who have actually done work in the IT world for a cycle or two.  If at all possible try to get a job in Aus that involves some kind of IT work - even if you're a secretary, get with the IT department and work on some project for the business even if it's not ever used and done entirely on your own time.  This makes much more of an impression on interviewers than just saying you have a degree from somewhere.   Even if it's never used, you don't have to tell them that, and you do have a topic of conversation where they ask you questions about the problems, techs you used, and so on.  IMO, having any experience at all in technical stuff means a lot more than your education in the US computer industry.   Now places like Google, Apple, and etc are much more receptive to bringing in completely inexperienced but academic people and training them up."

The Man - I haven't had much time to look into these guys but I love what I've heard so far. I like their beat which us a major part of their songs.   Washed out - I was just down this artist just a month ago but the music is incredible. It is very VERY chilled out so I have to be in the mood but boy is it cool. Its good to get high to.  Vampire Weekend - probably my all time favorite band. The use of strings and organs in their songs is incredible. I have yet to find a song I don't like by them. They have an incredibly amazing lineup of songs and continue to release quality music throughout all of their albums with regressing much if at all. Some might even argue they just keep getting better.   Givers - last one. Way cool band that has a sounds that is very hard to describe. As a rock group, they switch beats many times in their songs making them sound like multiple different songs, but they do this exceptionally well and I love to listen to it while in an upbeat mood.

Priority Mail would be about $40, and it takes 6-10 businesses days (about 2 weeks). Basically, it's going to be slow and expensive.  You will need to fill out customs forms. If you pay the postage online, which you should, the USPS website has a guided process, which means it is slightly less painful than recovering from wisdom tooth extraction. WEIGH EVERY ITEM BEFORE YOU PACK IT! The customs form needs a description, value, weight in pounds and ounces, and the country of manufacture for each item. I have no idea how you categorize things like homemade or handcrafted items. Make sure to indicate that it is a gift if you're shipping to friends or family (as opposed to eBay or etsy), as the person who receives it is responsible for duties and taxes. If it is a commercial shipment, make sure your recipient knows that they have to pay duties/taxes on the commercial value of the shipment as well as the cost of shipping, which can be quite expensive."

They are really good for the best variety of stuff--I've purchased everything from chocolate soy milk to furniture in the last year. eBay would probably have many sellers willing to ship internationally.   There are also quite a few websites that compile the sales info for the most popular retailers. Also take note of cyber Monday, when lots of places have post-Thanksgiving sales for online-only purchases. http://blackfriday.com/ seems to be pretty good. You'd have to check their shipping policies individually, unfortunately."

A number of years ago I was housesitting for my parents who have a little bit of a wine cellar. I invited my girlfriend over for dinner and decided to grab a bottle of wine. I find a 2003 Marquis Philips Shiraz with this logo on it. It didn't look like anything too fancy, so I figured we could drink this. Well it was really good. So good that I had to go online to figure out what we just drank.  The first thing I see on google are prices: $100, $150, $250. Uh oh.  Did some more digging, and found that there were a few different levels of Shiraz from them that year.  I finally found the correct bottle, $15.99.  Went out and bought a case."

I sort of see it as a place to fly into/stay while visiting Uluru. Who wouldn't want to see the worlds largest rock? No-one. Who wants to drive more than 6 hours to see it? No-one.  The Northern Territory is pretty big and almost all desert once you get off the coast. Darwin (the capital of NT) is nearly 2000km from Uluru or about a full days drive. Meanwhile on your side of the globe The Grand Canyon (what until I see will be referred to as the ""Inverse Uluru"") is a 5 hour journey from two major cities, LV and Pheonix."

Ameristralia,1q4won,TheNewsies,12,Fri Nov 8 09:15:47 2013 UTC,"I'm from Alice Springs. It's really not too bad. Give me 5 and I'll jump on my PC.     Okay, so the town is the largest (pop. of roughly 24,000) in the area and acts as a main hub for goods going between stations and communities (Aboriginal townships) and villages in and around Central Australia. It is also a large tourist hub as we have Ayers Rock (Uluru) & the Ulgars and Kings Canyon. The town it self is very beautiful after even light rain but it is usually really dry and there can be a lot of dead grass (which is a massive fire hazard) however, we do not get as large bushfires are other parts of Australia. It has had a large cultural significance as telegraph outpost between Adelaide and Darwin, however it eventually grew into a town.     I guess everyone mainly wants to hear about the people of the town. Our population is around 18% Aboriginal. However a large number of Aboriginals do come in from Outbush to use the town's services (this goes the same for white people out on settlements Outbush). The largest Aboriginal Group is Central Arrernte.  There are major issues with alcoholism in both the aboriginal and white communities in this town. As seen in the BBC World Service's Assignment, titled Battling Booze in Alice Springs the programme talked about alcoholism in the town, primarily in the Aboriginal population. The programme mainly focuses on the issues at the Todd Tavern and the Drive-Thru Bottleshop (Bottle-O) next to it and the banning of casket and fortified wine in the town. The report is a pretty accurate depiction of the opinions in the town brought on by alcoholism.   I'll point out now that the ""Stabbing Capital of Australia"" is a half-true, while we do have knife crimes, it mainly is contained in the ""Town Camps"" (poor, Aboriginal housing estates) and the surrounding communities, also, it is based on population size, not the amount of people stabbed (e.g. if a town had a population of ten and one of the people got stabbed the rate would be 10%, compare this to a town with a population of 100 where one person got stabbed, that would equal 1% of the population. Bad analogy but its the easiest way to explain it). We also have a very low reported crime rate, we have few murders or any other violent crimes (besides assaults, which are mainly alcohol fueled; Liam Jurrah being one the most recent noteworthy) that either occur or are reported. We had one gruesome murder a few years back where someone killed his ex-wife and one double-rape that occurred last year.     There is a minor ""Black Vs. White"" mentality in the lower classes (mixed race consider themselves Aboriginal) and there is a massive ""Black Vs. Black"" mentality where the lower class Aboriginals feel threatened by the African migrants.      We also have the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap (also known as the Space Base) which is a US and Australian satellite tracking station which brings in large amounts of you North Ameristralians to work here. The Base owns houses in parts of town where the majority of the Americans live (half of my neighbours are American).        Overall, the town isn't really as bad as the media and other people portray it as. The youth hate it here because there is ""not much"" for them to do (we don't have big malls) so that's where part of the negativity has come from, but you can't really judge it until you experience it yourself.  Also, we have a boat race in our dry river bed every year."

But also like buttered popcorn, you can put on too much butter or salt which makes it nasty. Spread a thin layer on buttered toast. Tim Tams (chocolate biscuit) are also Australian and won't disappoint.  Beer situation is not as great as the USA. If you don't like lagers you're going to be disappointed. It's basically all we drink (few exceptions, few and far between in bars anyhow). Of the standard beers you will find almost every bar, Fat Yak (pale ale) or a Golden Ale is probably the best. The main brands like VB, XXXX, Carlton or Tooheys are all average lagers, drinkable but its about quantity not quality. I apologise in advance.  You may also want to brace yourself for folks telling you ""Melbourne is better than Sydney"" or vice versa. Huge rivalry for no particular reason, just ignore it, both cities are great - we can be a bit arrogant at times (just don't mention sport ugh..).  Also, /r/sydney and /r/melbourne"

Im in college so Im used to drinking some pretty terrible beer.   Bud/Coors/Miller < Australian baseline < Australian craft beers < American craft beers. You'll be just fine.   what is the typical social view of most towards Americans there?   Mixed. We have plenty of idiots here too - some people associate American ~ Iraq, Afghanistan, wars generally (our army follows yours). These people don't distinguish between the US government and the US people as we still feel like we have a (slipping) grip on democracy - and as a democratic state - so should you and thus its your responsibility as its your government, type thing. They don't understand the gun situation and but will certainly tell you have stupid it is (they have no comprehension of how difficult it is to change anything with a voting population that big). Or how much better Australia is (we can be quite arrogant) - sport will get these juices flowing. Just walk away.  We also swear a lot. You will be surprised. Don't be offended.  Everyone else: freaking love you. I hope you're single because you are going to clean house. Our popular culture very closely mimics yours. Ever been flattered about your accent before? You know that thing you have virtually no control over? It's funny (although I guess I would say in the USA finding an Australian is more difficult than finding an American here).

It's not a secret anymore that we're flying drone missions in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Iran, etc. There wasn't any public outrage about 'mission creep' or the parameters of our unending 'war on terrorism' when this became apparent so I don't get all the secrecy still.  So if the public could see the framework for the RoE when it comes to tracking and killing terrorist targets, I think that would make the .05% of people who actually care far more comfortable.  Other than that, I love them. They save not only US and ISAF troops' lives, but the lives of civilians all around the world, they cost far less to operate and refuel and deploy, and they're incredibly effective precision killing machines."
Ameristralia,1oywkl,alpicart,2,Tue Oct 22 23:14:35 2013 UTC,"I agree with their use. They are just tools. These drones are not automated killing machines. They would still bomb people with or without drones. When they say ""it save lives"" they're taking about our pilots."

That doesn't seem like very sound logic to me, could you explain your statement further? In nearly everything we do in our daily lives we take measures to minimize the risk of injury or loss of life and it seems like you're arguing that we shouldn't use these drones as tools to do so."
Ameristralia,1oywkl,alpicart,0,Tue Oct 22 23:22:49 2013 UTC,"That is exactly what I'm arguing.  Why do you only care about the loss of life when it comes to our men and women, but not the ones who are on the recieving end of the drone strikes.  Nobody gives a fuck about all of the innocent (non-militant) men women and children that have been killed as a part of these drone strikes.  If you cant do tactical drone strikes that take out the target and ONLY the target, then don't do it at all.  Otherwise, if you feel it's going to be complicated get men in there to do the job. If you believe in your cause so much, then put your men at risk. Stop treating this like a goddamned video game.  These drone strikes killing innocent people the way they do, it fosters the hatred for America, and breeds terrorism. What's our solution, more drones?  We shouldnt be there in the first place, and if the idea of sending men in to do the job makes you say ""wait, what?"" then you should be asking yourself why we are putting value on our lives but not the lives of others when it comes to this shit.  Drone strikes are messy as fuck. The disconnect only makes everything worse."

Ameristralia,1o8pbb,wetasaneagle,1 point,Sat Oct 12 06:54:15 2013 UTC,It just is. Jumper is a cotton/blend pullover or sweat shirt or woolen pullover. It has no gender specific definition. Hoodies are just cotton/blend pullovers with hoods. I don't actually remember ever hearing anyone call a hoodie a jumper but I suppose it must happen. We have always just used jumper to describe any warm thicker-than-a-t-shirt type of torso covering clothing that is not a jacket.
Ameristralia,1o8pbb,da1inchpunch,1 point,Fri Oct 11 20:34:39 2013 UTC,A customer came in my store and asked for a jumper and then saw a zip up hoodie and said perfect and bought it
Ameristralia,1o8pbb,elemental_1_1,2,Fri Oct 11 21:17:40 2013 UTC,Jumper == anything warm you wear on your upper body really  A hoodie needs a hood  A hoodie is a type of jumper

Ameristralia,1o8pbb,WattaWallaby,1 point,Sat Oct 12 03:53:16 2013 UTC,Jumper = Sweater.  Hoodie = Hooded sweater or Jacket  Perhaps your customer was looking for a Jumper but came across a hoodie and just purchased that instead. I call jumpers jumpers because i dunno Sweater is a derogatory term for people who follow a band around and suck up to them and constantly claim they're a particular bands #1 fan. So I don't like to use it.

Ameristralia,1o3p8x,SlyKook,10,Wed Oct 9 23:59:34 2013 UTC,I find the older I get (and presumably more I eat it) the more I enjoy a thick spread slab of Vegemite toast.
Ameristralia,1o3p8x,danieljr1992,4,Thu Oct 10 01:54:13 2013 UTC,"Alternatively, use cheese instead of butter. Cheddar, not the orange, canned, northerner stuff.  Also, vegemite and eggs/baked beans/bacon/avocado on toast. Do it. It's heaven."

Ameristralia,1o3p8x,danieljr1992,2,Sun Oct 27 19:00:30 2013 UTC,"Well I remember there was an episode of the View or the Doctors or something, where they asked the audience (which was mostly stupid women) which of the cheeses they had lined up wasn't real cheese. They had cheddar, mozzarella, Swiss, some other stuff, and American cheese. When they revealed that American cheese wasn't real, they were all shocked. I know that's not the same stuff as the cheese whizz, but if your country makes cheese in a spray can, surly you wouldn't be surprised that your cheese isn't real!  Also, I've seen cheese whizz featured on TV shows as a symbol for a bachelor's lowest point. On the couch with no pants and spraying cheese into his mouth. I didn't think everyone used it, but maybe poor uni students or something."
Ameristralia,1o3p8x,MaleFascistAdvice,2,Sun Oct 27 23:38:32 2013 UTC,"Even poor uni students (at least my friends) don't eat it. it's Top Ramen or rice for them.

Ameristralia,1o3p8x,Deeds568,2,Thu Oct 10 00:02:20 2013 UTC,Did you have it on toast with heaps on butter?
Ameristralia,1o3p8x,Churba,3,Thu Oct 10 00:54:07 2013 UTC,afraid not is it worth buying some to try it?
Ameristralia,1o3p8x,Deeds568,3,Thu Oct 10 01:02:04 2013 UTC,"I think so. You can always let your friends try it too, and give it to the one that likes it if you don't. Basically, the rule of thumb is that if you like Miso or other Umami flavors, you'll propably like Vegemite.  Not that hard to find, either, you get get little jars on amazon pretty cheap.  You never know, it might turn out alright. Might be like my mate at RIT, try it once, love it, run Wegmans completely out of vegimite over the next few months, and then go without until you order a half a kilo of the shit from Amazon upon discovering that Amazon stocks it."
Ameristralia,1o3p8x,Churba,2,Thu Oct 10 03:19:08 2013 UTC,I think I'm gonna give it a shot again. I hope its good for me now.
Ameristralia,1o3p8x,Deeds568,2,Thu Oct 10 13:18:37 2013 UTC,"It's been said before, and I'll say it again - A little goes a long way. Spread it thin on butter. And when I say thin, I mean real thin. You're only starting out, and it's a strong flavor - if you hit yourself with too much, you're gonna hate it.  And then you have bastards like me who grew up eating it, if I'm hungover, I'll just grab a teaspoon of it, flip it bowl-down, and just suck on it for a while."
Ameristralia,1o3p8x,HighestLevelRabbit,3,Thu Oct 10 13:29:35 2013 UTC,That seems like to much to handle at once so yeah a little on toast and butter is something I'll try later today.

If you havn't been following Australian news lately i'll break it down a little bit so you guys know what you're signing a petition for:  So basically, the previous government were constructing a FTTH/FTTP (Fibre To The Home/Premises) system in order to boost upload/download speeds though replacing the outdated copper system.  The newly elected government, the Liberal Party (conservative by nature) are against this policy and will cease the implementation of FTTH and replace it with FTTN (fibre to the node). This means that the fiber wires will run to nodes ~500m along every street (I could be wrong on the 500m statistic, it's just off the top of my head) resulting in the rest of the wiring staying as copper (i.e. the wiring into the homes).  The alleged positives of the new government's policy is that 'It will be done much faster' and 'It will cost less', but in order for the government to maintain the copper wiring system; the maintenance cost will override the initial cost of just implementing fiber.  So, and i'm not going to spit out specific numbers here because I havn't slept for 28 hours, the new governments plan will provide 1/45th  of the old governments internet speed policy, and we think that's ridiculous. If you really have an issue with this, which i'm sure you would if you read into it, I highly recommend you take the short time it takes to sign this petition.  TL;DR: Old governments internet implementation was going to be a lot faster, the new one is crap and will need replacing, do this so they can recognise we need it."

Another perspective I didn't think about is how it also impacts national scientific research (and perhaps non-scientific, but I'm not familiar with that). Think about it: The NIH hands out tons of money, typically to high-quality labs, for research that focuses on some clinically relevant issue. Now... you're either going to have to wait for your money, hence slowing you down potentially a great deal, or, depending on what solution is reached, you may not even see that money.

We don't need this system anymore because it is no longer holding the executive brand accountable. Congress deals with our federal budget largely now so really it is just making sure they pay the bills they already racked up. It is an antiquated procedure that allows minority parties to hold majority parties hostage over political concessions. We need to get rid of the debt ceiling all together. These vastly more intelligent people agree:  Clinton apointee's, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers think we should get rid of it.  Bruce Bartlett, H. W. treasury office/policy adviser, agrees  W's first SoT, Paul O'Neil is also on board  (Tim Geithner)[www.politico.com/story/2012/11/timothy-geithner-end-debt-ceiling-for-good-84428.html], our current secretary, is on the wagon as well. EDIT: I can't make this damn hyperlink work.  Prominent rankings group, Moody's, sees that it is ineffective   Alan Greenspan, everyones favorite ex Fed head, thinks it is silly too  Libertarian investor, Peter Schiff would do away wtih the debt ceiling.  The Brookings Institute: from Marshall Robinson who believed the debt ceiling was a complete failure back in the 50s to Isabel Sawhill in the modern era.  While the Congressional Budget Office doesnt advocate for the abolition of the debt ceiling they have said that it was basically useless  In 1979 the Government Accountability Office argued the law ""has brought into quest the need for the Congress to consider the debt ceiling separately from the budget process.""  And in 1979 you had Richard Gephardt establishing a resolution that allowed the debt limit to be raised without the need for a separate (and unpopular) vote which lead to two decades of relative stability until republicans waived when they took over congress in 1995.

I wouldn't worry about getting a job prior to getting here, we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world, you will get a job within a week.  Also we dont tip here......period.

Ameristralia,1morr4,DerJawsh,5,Thu Sep 19 06:32:14 2013 UTC,"yes, but you also have to consider their ""cheeseburger"" is a pretty large double cheeseburger, and no matter what size fries you get, they throw that size cup in the bag then just fill the rest of the bag with fries."

Ameristralia,1morr4,super-rad,6,Thu Sep 19 07:54:55 2013 UTC,"Yes, sometimes as it depends on what kind of shop you're in.  Often condiments like ketchup, mustard, bbq sauce, mayo, etc. are in a station available after your purchase in the usual burger joints.  In a lot of the newer ""made to order"" sandwich shops, after you tell them what kind of sandwich you want, they then dutifully await while you tell them what toppings you want which may include sauces and spreads.  For instance, at a burrito joint, salsa and guacamole are added at that point at your direction.  Once the sandwich is complete, you move on to the register to pay and collect your sandwich and beverage cup."

Looks like a joint base (US SOF, US Medevac teams) so I'm thinking that multicam might just be the way to keep everyone consistent. I don't know too much about Australian ""standard"" forward-deployed issued gear and how likely it'd be to see m4s and the m110 out there in the wild since I've never run into any other than stateside so I'm just speculating here.

Then ... the same people who put her in, got rid of her and put Kevin Rudd back.  The Australian vote basically said:  ""We'd rather have this idiot, than the other sorry bunch"".

He was basically a catholic priest before becoming a politician so he is very conservative, some might say outdated, in his views. Consequently popular issues like gay marriage and abortion will be put to the side because they clash with his ideals.  Also he's going to give us really slow internet"
Ameristralia,1ly7xn,jtj-H,3,Sun Sep 8 04:57:43 2013 UTC,"I'll try to give some insight. The Australian poltical system is divided between the two largest parties, the ALP and LNP. The ALP is the closest to your democratic party and they've been in power since 2007 but their party has had constant squabbling and changed leadership from Kevin Rudd to Julia Gillard and back to Kevin Rudd a few months ago. Most people quite like Kevin Rudd but the constant infighting left a bad taste in most people's mouth, hence why LNP won this time. I turned 18 a few months ago and was quite excited to be able to partake in the election, I've adamantly against the LNP parties stance for several reasons they are:  Immigration: Tony Abbott's LNP party line has been ""Stop the Boats"", we're quite near Asia so we get a lot of refugee's and most people hate the fact that our country is getting swamped by immigrants, but the LNP has a fanatical almost Nazi-like hatred of foreigners. His plans to turn back boats, even damaged ones is illegal, dangerous and most of all expensive. He's making huge budget cuts to schools and hospitals to fund his draconian policies. My parents are immigrants here so I've got a soft spot for migrants but anyone with a brain can see that these policies are dangerous for Australia to follow  Budget: Tony has a ridiculous view of the budget, he wants to reverse Kevin Rudd's policies which kept Australia out of the recession and increase our mining industry based on cheap Chinese labour and sell uranium to the Asians, what he doesn't get is that the mining boom is over and he's basically sucking us dry without a back-up plan. This is the man who said that climate change ""is a load of crap"" and instead of slowly replacing mining with renewable energy sources that will provide a smooth transition into the future of energy economics he's going to leave Australia richer but careening off an economic cliff when the mining runs out which it will within the next decade or two. He's cutting the Medicare programs that Australia relies on, my dad is disabled and really relies on our public funded hospitals and pay and that's coming to a swift end for us, we're slowly turning into a corporate-controlled country based on the capitalistic morals that we scoff at the US for having  Backwards thinking: I love Australia but we've always been behind the world with culture, technology and politics, we're the people that didn't recognize our indigenous population as citizens until the 1970's. Tony is a strictly conservative Christian, which is fine except he's forcing his beliefs upon the entire country by removing any pro-gay marriage legislation and making comments saying that men having more power than woman is traditionally a good thing. He's got very little experience dealing with foreign powers like China and the US, our two biggest allies and is openly contemptible of other nations he considers unimportant and right now Australia has huge oppurtinty to become a major world power. He's looking at Australia with a 20th century views and he's going to thrust us back to a place we've been crawling away from.   TL;DRI'm not saying he's evil, he's got a lot of good policies and it's nice to have someone fresh in government but looking at his track record his policies are outdated and harmful in the long run to Australia. I guess only time will tell"
Ameristralia,1ly7xn,yes_thats_right,2,Sun Sep 8 05:55:28 2013 UTC,hate the fact that our country is getting swamped by immigrants   is not a fact boat people are the tiniest % of immigrants as well as all refugees in general   the mining boom is over   that just means there not building as many any more but the mines are still mining other then that everything else is correct

The fact that Abbott doesn't agree with the logical definition of marriage doesn't make him homophobic. There is no evidence he is xenophobic or a misogynist.

If you think Misogyny and sexism are similiar GET THE FUCK OUT LOOK UP MISOGYNY, a misgoynist doesn't even have to be a sexist.  The disabled support exactly what I said is the facts. I will explain it in basic terms for you.  Area A received the new disabled support scheme, I live in area B and would qualify for the disabled support, but since area B did not receive it I did not get it. Hence I move too area A to receive it but oh no I still do not receive it cause I had to live in area A when it was introduced to reduce the costs of the scheme because it was  the typical POS that labor puts out i.e. ill thought garbage.  In regards to Julia Gillard I agree as prime minister she was those, She has been the single worst prime minister in the history of our country (well maybe Whitlam was worse but it's a toss up).   You using those quotes and the like is the typical BS that Labor ran as their campaign Oh look at this Abbot will make a terrible pm because he said this once........................................................................................................  Please go read some decent economic articles from the time Labor was government personally I would suggest the Financial review (I live in Sydney by the way) and then you may begin to appreciate what they did to our economy.

Basically we have Uni education nice and cheap with a reasonably extensive scholarship system, Whitlam is elected he makes University completely free. Liberals are elected because Whitlam is completely hopeless and pathetic and couldn't even fund the country.   Free University just doesn't work, Liberals however do not go back to the old system Whitlam gave them the opportunity too introduce a compeletly different system (i.e. the current Hecs etc. bla bla) something which costs the average student more then pre-Whitlam."
Ameristralia,1ly7xn,unsalted-butter,1 point,Thu Sep 19 05:44:38 2013 UTC,Whitlam couldn't fund the country because the Liberals didn't let the necessary bills to be passed - he was under a minority government at that time.   And I doubt that we would have the current HECS system if Whitlam hadn't made it free in the first place - the Liberals would just do nothing to change the fee-paying system (just like America).
Ameristralia,1ly7xn,unsalted-butter,-1,Thu Sep 19 12:58:53 2013 UTC,"Firstly, I didn't 'buy into populist labour bullshit', it could just as easily be said that you bought into liberal party bullshit. Don't assume that just because my viewpoint is different to yours that I'm an unthinking drone. Yes, Abbott's sister is lesbian, but he has said on record that he feels threatened by homosexuality. Just because someone related to him has a particular viewpoint doesn't mean he shares it, a case with a great many families.  I agree that perhaps misogynist is perhaps too strong a word to use, but his views on women and women's rights are a good few decades outdated. It's not funding to the universities he wants to cut, it's the student assistance and HECS debt that he wants to cut, which is the only way in for a lot of students.  The disability issue seems to be very hard for most people to understand who have never had to live with it, but my brother can barely move on his own, cannot fully speak, cannot feed himself or use the toilet independently, and requires therapy, equipment and medication that cost thousands a week. My family were barely scraping by even before he was born, and, without some form of disability assistance, will not be able to survive. It might be, by your measure, 'easy' to get disability assistance (and I agree, some people do abuse the system), but what's not easy is caring for someone with a severe disability."
Ameristralia,1ly7xn,imgurtranscriber,-1,Fri Sep 20 00:20:57 2013 UTC,"maybe populist labour bullshit is a little strong it's did you hear Kevin Rudds defeat speech it was ridiculously long and positive for the worst labour result in 100 years. What I generally meant by it was the labour campaign which was ridiculously negative trying to make people hate the liberals sort of.  Don't know enough of the Uni thing to talk about it, the internet filter was actually my local member who is seriously stupid and thankfully one of the other liberals renegged what he put out on it saying liberals wouldn't do a filter essentially.  In regards to gay marriage I doubt I am the only person who supports gay marriage but not so much as to elect a prime minister who will be irresponsible in other areas as a result, in any event I am pretty sure he said he would do a conscience vote so it doesn't really matter his views it won't effect running the country.  You are still being too harsh on abbot in regards to women yes he has shown a slight leaning towards women staying at home having children but nothing that extreme, remember the deputy of the liberal party is a woman for one so he literally can not be sexist to a degree that it will effect his prime ministership or the liberals would not have elected him leader.  In regards to the disability thing you are still looking at wrong just because it is working for you does not mean the system that labour put in place is working because it is not if you lived outside of the areas they have implemented it you would not get it the system is completely ridiculous and broken.  but I mean at the end of the day if you did not like John Howard as prime minister (excluding his terrible handling of work choices at the end) you probably won't like Abbot, and visa versa.  personally my problem with the previous Labor government is that they have spent money on all these social reforms (essentially undoing the fiscal work of the Howard government), now don't miss understand me I don't have problem with social reforms I am not an extreme right winger my problem is they spent all this money on it AND IT WASN'T EVEN FAIR. I truly belive Abbot will govern all of Australia fairly those parts that voted for him, those that didn't, the cities and the those in the country. The labor government gave me the complete opposite feeling not too mention the stupid policies like the carbon tax ..."

We had numerous issues with large investment banks screwing over the common folk by selling them stock that they knew was going to fail. The price of gas went up, people had less money to spend, people were afraid to spend more. Less spending = less jobs = less money = less spending = less jobs and so on and so forth.

How are they going to do it? Fuck knows!

So I looked up a list of prime ministers and became even more confused when I saw some guy right before this new guy and after the girl only served a couple months. I became even more confused when I tried reading why.   Can someone explain the deal with Kevin Rudd?
Ameristralia,1lwxkk,coollikecody,1 point,Sat Sep 14 01:01:52 2013 UTC,"Girl PM - Julia Gillard. Some guy right before this new guy: Kevin Rudd. New guy: Tony Abbott.   So what happened was: 2007 election - Kevin won. In 2010 (before the next election in 2011), there was a leadership crisis within Kevin's own party. As a result, Kevin got booted out and the then deputy PM, Julia Gillard, got in as PM.  2011 election saw Julia once again as PM, but only narrowly.   During all this time, Kevin and Julia have been 'fighting' for leadership (leadership spill, or crisis) and finally, a couple of months from the election, Kevin won and was installed as PM once more. And a few months later, lost to the moron Tony Abbott that we now unfortunately have as PM."

About 3 inches from the picture is this statement;   Notes: Australia is more than three times the size of Greenland, the largest island. Australia is sometimes dubbed ""The Island Continent"", and sometimes accorded the role of ""Earth’s largest island but smallest continent"".[1] Antarctica is a special case: if its ice is considered not as land, but as water, it is not a single land mass, but several land areas of much smaller area, since the ice-bedrock boundary is below sea level in many regions of the continent. If its ice cover were to be lifted, some rock that is currently below sea level would rise as the weight of the ice would be removed, [2] although this would in part be counteracted, and in some areas of the continent overtaken, by eustatic rises in sea level.[3]   In Aus. schools kids are taught that it's the largest island but smallest continent. Not that it matters."

This would then make Eurasia the largest island. Obviously this isn't the case.

I'm not sure how much research you've done, but this is the visa you'll want if you are eligible.  http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday/462/usa/  If you aren't eligible for that visa, either because of age or something else... You're pretty much out of options unless you're willing to do seasonal farm work instead of serving.  Immigration is very strict in the south, and normal work visas are both costly and difficult to obtain on your own.  If you are eligible for that visa, I would guess the best time to go would be when students are in school, just because of the way the minimum wage works. A southerner who knows better is free to correct me though, if my guess is incorrect.  edit: I forgot one thing. I've heard there are companies that you can pay X amount of money to, and they'll ""sponsor"" you so you can come over on a sponsored work visa. I think they can also do a lot of the paperwork for you too. I'm not sure if you can work for another employer once you come over though, but it's something to look into if you're too old for the working holiday."
Ameristralia,1kzsgg,oiransc2,2,Sat Aug 24 08:43:30 2013 UTC,"I always forget that I'm thirty years old now. Probably excludes me from the visa.

I was not thinking about the immigration factor at all. I forget our freedom isn't limitless between north and south. Maybe someday our kids won't have any paperwork to get through."

If I were you, I'd just email them and ask. It's possible the south's government cracked down on it (cause it is a bit shady, tbh) but it's also possible that they just don't want to offer it because it's more work.

(Think Sydney and Melbourne)   Might want to do your climate research there: the weather is basically identical relative to the difference between Michigan and Florida seasons.   When I add tips to it I bring in $15-20 an hour.   Tipping is not standard here (although I prefer your tipping system).  Minimum wage is like $16 or something for any industry. If you work at the right bar/restaurant you can do a lot better and if it is a fancy place then tips can be decent. The US style of serving I think will get you far.   I would love to come visit for a good season   Aka spring/summer, the opposite of your fall/winter (yes, Christmas happens at the beach).   I usually go for several months at a time finding a job and getting a small apartment.   Anywhere worth living while on a working holiday (i.e. access to stuff/lifestyle) you will pay through the nose for. Welcome to the South. Consider share houses for financial sanity - plenty around and plenty of people in similar situations (try somewhere like gumtree.com.au)   Would anyone be willing to compare their own experience serving? Monetary and possible cultural differences?   No experience but just a general observation: in the US people work hard for tips. They remember what you ordered, have fun conversations and just generally ensure everyone is having a good time. They are earned. Here I feel the service sucks relatively speaking because people don't have to go that extra yard to get that money - all they have to do is show up and get paid. I think you will find it easier but potentially less fun."

Ameristralia,1kzsgg,0x0000ff,3,Sat Aug 24 19:44:41 2013 UTC,"There's a difference between shitty service because the server is new or because the kitchen isn't performing well and shitty service due to a shitty server. If I know the server is new or if they're friendly or apologetic I tip them above average (usually >50%). But if they're just a shit server and obviously don't give a fuck, then I don't give a fuck whether they get tipped or not. I'm not obligated to tip regardless of the level of service, that's the whole point of a tip system. If you think that's a ""prick"" move, find another line of work.

They're respected in their scenes. Songs like Contour Lines and even Beauty In The Bricks are more representative - Amazing was the introductory track to their album Sunday Gentlemen, and it serves that purpose. They're great lyricists, even if it isn't evident from this song. I enjoy it, but I wouldn't pick it as representative of them as artists."

Ameristralia,1k896g,knoblauch,2,Tue Aug 13 14:09:59 2013 UTC,Usually but some brands also have squeeze bottles now too. They have nozzles that make it easier to get good layer without a knife but I still use a knife anyways just to guarantee consistency.
Ameristralia,1k896g,o917383,1 point,Tue Aug 13 14:29:42 2013 UTC,"Jam and jelly are pretty much the same thing:   Jelly is a clear, bright product. It is generally made by cooking fruit juice and sugar with pectin as a jelling agent and lemon juice as an acid to maintain a consistent texture. Jelly is firm and will hold its shape. Generally, jelly contains no pieces of fruit, although specialty jellies, like pepper jelly, may include pieces of jalapeo or other pepper.   Jam is made from crushed or chopped fruit cooked with sugar, and often pectin and lemon juice. Jam can be a pure of fruit or have a soft pulp, but it does not contain chunks of fruit.    However, if you go to the store, in the isle with the jam's and jelly's, most people will just pick one with the flavor they want and ignore whether it's jam or jelly, all pretty much the same at that level.  If you buy the more fancy stuff, it matters.  JELLO however is something else and is totally disgusting.  It's gelatin with food color and sugar then put in the refrigerator(fridge) to make it solidify.  so gross."

Ameristralia,1k2ijk,ColonelBrutus,18,Sat Aug 10 03:11:13 2013 UTC,"Holy. Shit. Did you just ask about Mareeba? As in Mareeba, Queensland? Excuse me for a second while I come to terms with this. That's my home town and I never EVER thought I'd ever see anyone mention it online. EVER. I'm in Brisbane now for uni but still... it's a big surprise. I gotta know, what takes you to Mareeba?   Anyway, Mareeba is alright I guess. There isn't really much to do there so don't too expect much, though our Target Country is not to be missed... :P But seriously, there are a few things to do up and around Mareeba. On my holidays back home I work at Skybury Coffee and so I'm advised to tell you to go there for lunch, a coffee and to take the plantation tour. Nah, I'm not gonna vouch for Skybruy over any of the other places around town; I don't like that job that much. The Coffee Works is probably just as good and Jaques Coffee is there, but it's meh at best. You just missed the local Rodeo which might have provided some entertainment but the Maco Trak (a local go-kart track) is pretty fun for kids and adults and a lot better than the track down in Cairns. Also, Lamington National Park has some really specular sights to see and some adventurous hiking tracks etc. As a kid my family and I used to go to Daves Creek (a creek in the park) for a swim. It's very nice there.  If you're looking for more to do, I'd suggest going down to Cairns. There's a lot more to do in Cairns. For starters, there're a few shopping malls, cinemas and restaurants around the city. Cairns has some nice beaches too; I'd definitely recommend heading out to Port Douglas while you're there, is a really great day out. Right in the CBD, the Esplanade is good place to take the kids for a swim by the ocean and to have some lunch.   For more adventurous days out, there're trips out to the Great Barrier Reef where you can snorkel in the coral with the fish, plus you can take a day trip out to Green Island which is fantastic. For just the adults, there are a number of adventure sports available in Cairns too. AJ Hackett Cairns boasts Australia's only bungee tower. There's also skydiving, hand-gliding, white-water rafting, etc. etc.  Another attraction that might be worth your while is Sugarworld (a water park with slides and whatnot) in Edmonton (not far out of Cairns). It was always a favourite of mine growing up. I haven't been there in years but I remember having a lot of fun there.   Another stop you could make is a small town in the rainforest between Mareeba and Cairns called Kuranda. The people are crazy hippies but there are things to do around Kuranda. The Kuranda Markets are pretty good sometimes and the Barron Falls are beautiful (though I'm not too sure how high the Barron River is at the moment). There's also paintball which is awesome and a Skyrail which takes you down the mountain to Cairns over the rainforest.  Oh, and word of warning, don't, under any circumstances, go to Atherton. That's where dreams go to die... in the perpetual rain.  Anyway, those are just my travel tips. Hope they help. Have fun."

When we travel, especially travelling abroad, we like to spend most of the time off the beaten trail away from other tourists.  We want to experience the culture and food the way the locals do (as much as we can).  I really want to see more of Australia's natural beauty rather than her cities on this trip.  Kuranda sounds like a place I really must check out while there.  You asked how I landed on the idea of Mareeba... 300 sunny days a year!  Why not?!"

Ameristralia,1k0chd,Angerwing,2,Sat Aug 10 04:40:32 2013 UTC,"Pro-tips?   When you purchase something, the tax is included on the ticket price.   I prefer Melbourne to Sydney, but Sydney is definitely worth seeing.  Canberra has some nice buildings to see, but isn't worth hanging around for long, though if you're going to be around there in mid-late September, you'll get to see Floriade (a flower festival thing... it's pretty).   Australia is pretty safe in the cities, so unless you're strolling around King's Cross or other disreputable parts of town, you should be right.   You've heard of all our dangerous animals, but I doubt you'll see one. A good rule of thumb is if it can house a dangerous animal, treat it like it has one. Don't go traipsing about in long grass and don't leave your shoes outside. If you're out in the bush at all, watch where you put your body parts.  The people are basically the same no matter where you go (apart from northern Queensland). A bloke from Perth will sound like a guy from Coffs Harbour, a half week drive away.  If you plan on coming through Canberra at all, I can help you out with that."

People who react negatively to straight MSG react identically to foods like this that try to disguise it.   The problem with MSG isn't the sodium, it's the free glutamates, which this contains in abundance. So, ya, same thing as far as health effects go. It's basically ingesting mass amounts of a deformed version of natural neurotransmitters which then bond improperly with receptors in our brains. Enjoy."

Ameristralia,1jqczt,Protuhj,4,Mon Aug 5 13:01:27 2013 UTC,You can get pulled over for flashing your lights.
Ameristralia,1jqczt,anndor,2,Mon Aug 5 14:15:46 2013 UTC,"(in the north)  Historically, law enforcement officers give citations for headlight flashing under three types of laws:   (1) laws prohibiting a person from obstructing a police investigation,  (2) laws prohibiting a person from having flashing lights on their vehicle, and  (3) laws prohibiting shining a vehicle’s high beams at oncoming traffic.  (in the south)  Headlight flashing to warn drivers of traffic enforcement cameras is illegal in the state of Queensland, carrying a $30 fine and one demerit point, or a $1500 fine if the fine is unsuccessfully challenged in court.[51] Officers may either fine a driver for improper use of headlights, or may even arrest and prosecute for hindering police.[51]"
Ameristralia,1jqczt,Protuhj,3,Mon Aug 5 12:44:21 2013 UTC,"Regarding (2) - So, you should get pulled over for driving with your hazards on."
Ameristralia,1jqczt,sir_mrej,4,Mon Aug 5 14:21:56 2013 UTC,Technically you're not supposed to drive with your hazards on. Aren't they only meant to signify a car that is stopped?

It just shows which states allow driving with them on.    The times I've seen hazards on when driving are mostly when a sudden downpour occurs, and pulling over is impossible. (I'm in South Carolina, summer downpours occur pretty regularly."
Ameristralia,1jqczt,sir_mrej,2,Mon Aug 5 19:36:39 2013 UTC,"I always put hazards on if I have to slow down IMMENSELY. Like pouring rain (see the other person below), or if there's a traffic snarl around a corner and I don't want people to speed around and ram into my ass."
Ameristralia,1jqczt,Teh_Hicks,3,Mon Aug 5 21:22:20 2013 UTC,"Oh, I've definitely driven with them on as well, in blizzards or whatnot. That's why I said ""technically"".  Just like in NY, you're technically not supposed to have any sort of cover on your rear license plate, but everyone has one (and dealers/garages put them on whenever you get work done). I only learned that because a cop ticketed me for it instead of giving me the +15mph speeding ticket I probably would've gotten if my birthday hadn't been the next day (and I hadn't been dressed like a pirate, with a car full of other girls also dressed like pirates)."

In the South, it's usually, as the picture says, a camera hidden to catch you speeding. In the North, it's usually an actual cop, who will pull out of his hiding spot and pull you over to give you a ticket if you're caught speeding.  And, as others have mentioned, there are wholly useless laws in place to prevent signalling to others throughout the nation, and everyone proceeds to ignore those laws and get on with their lives."

Ameristralia,1jr6dj,AKaviator,4,Mon Aug 5 18:59:21 2013 UTC,"The chocolate ones are a good introduction. I tried caramel first, and as a result I only thought the original ones were okay. Instead of having just frosting sandwiched between two biscuits, the caramel ones interrupt the frosting with a center strip of chewy caramel. It's similar to the caramel you find in a twix but with a slightly richer flavor. Anyway, so when you bite into it, it's caramel in the very center, frosting to the right and left of that, biscuits at the top and bottom, then the whole thing dipped in chocolate.  I read on Wikipedia that Target is supposed to import the original and caramel Tim Tams during certain times of the year. Maybe look there?  Oh yeah, you should also try Mint Slices if you ever have the chance. They're made by the same company that makes Tim Tams. They're very similar to Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies, except there is a layer of peppermint cream (tastes like a cross between an Andes Mint and a York Peppermint Patty) placed on top of the biscuit before it's dipped in chocolate. Very similar in structure to a Girl Scout Tagalong."

The Tim Tams aren't called Tim Tams though, they're packaged as Arnott's Original or something.  Anyway, I bought some Mint Slices and Caramel Crowns but was dismayed when I actually went to eat them. They weren't past their expiration date by a few months, but the biscuit in the Mint Slice had become extremely hard, while the biscuit in the Caramel Crown had become that soft, mushy, unpleasant sort of stale. Definitely nothing close to what they taste like when you buy the in the south.  Since it's summer here in the north, it's possible they were exposed to too much heat while being imported and spoiled (I've found that makes them not as good once, even after then cool off). I'm willing to give the imported ones another try in the future, but I wanted to warn you in case you ran into them. I wouldn't want someone's first Mint Slice experience to leave a bad impression."

Ameristralia,1jk2kk,ChuqTas,22,Fri Aug 2 10:49:33 2013 UTC,I think it's because your deadly creatures are much smaller.  You'll never find a bear in your shoe when you try putting it on.  These would terrify me.
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,wallybinbaz,3,Fri Aug 2 13:04:23 2013 UTC,Now I fucking feel shit on me. Just keep telling myself its all in my head.
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,BigWillyBilly,8,Sat Aug 3 03:51:06 2013 UTC,"Actually, I have a theory as to why - they're not used to it. We both become inured to it over time, and we're raised with strategies to deal with these matters(Ie, don't stick your fingers in gaps and crevices you can't see into, don't fuck with snakes, if you're walking through long grass, beat the grass ahead of you with a stick, don't jump in random waterholes without looking for harmful shit, hospitals have antivenom so remember as much as you can about what bit you, etc, etc) so it's not bothersome to us.  On the other hand, I don't know what I'm doing if a cougar decides to come and have a go. Punch it in the face? Would that even work? And Bears, I know nothing about bears, other than the fact that I'm moderately sure the bear would win that little brawl, and there's probably better ways to deal with that shit.  It's a matter of what you're used to. And we get a big rep for it, because we've got a lot of animals not found in other places very often. Cassowaries are strange to them, whereas a bear in America and a Bear in Russia will both do bear things to you in much the same fashion, so nothing new about that."
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,Churba,3,Fri Aug 2 16:47:11 2013 UTC,"Exactly!   Also...if you're in bear country, make lots of noise. Most attacks happen when you accidentally sneak up on the bear. If you're being attacked by a cougar, try to protect your neck, that's how they usually kill their prey. And go for the eyeballs. No wild animal will stick around something that's trying to poke their eyeballs out."
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,hochizo,2,Fri Aug 2 17:35:14 2013 UTC,"I'll be sure to remember this advice, just in case. Always nice to know how to get something to stop actively attempting to rip my face off and consume it like one of those tasty little salmon on a biscuit things that go around on trays at fancy parties. Except it has lips."
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,Churba,2,Fri Aug 2 17:58:56 2013 UTC,"So I have a story for you.  I grew up in Idaho, a smallish state in the Northwest.  My grandpa was a mountain man through and through.  He grew up logging with his dad and brothers, owned an evergreen farm, and would always take the grand kids (me and my cousins) out logging when we needed firewood.    One day we were driving up to a camping spot in his old beat up Chevy truck, we found a black bear cub sitting in the middle of the dirt road.  Now this road wasn't big enough for us to go around the cub, so what does my grandpa do?  He gets out of the god damn truck, picks up the bear cub, carries it to the side of the road, and high tails it back to the truck.  Apparently he heard the momma bear rustling around and heard her growl.  I thought he was the coolest person ever.  Looking back, he could have just honked and probably scared it away without risking the ire of the mother."
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,TheRoadHome,1 point,Fri Aug 2 20:54:45 2013 UTC,"There's a story in one of the Oh Ranger books about a park ranger who found a bear cub that had slid down the side of a drift into the road.

Ameristralia,1jk2kk,imnotacrazyperson,1 point,Sat Aug 3 05:43:28 2013 UTC,"Also...if you're in bear country, make lots of noise.   And carry either a 12 gauge loaded with slugs or a .500 S&W."

Ameristralia,1jk2kk,imnotacrazyperson,2,Sat Aug 3 03:17:38 2013 UTC,"This is true, most bears are skittish.  The ones that have been habituated to contact with human food handouts are the ones that don't scare off.    Also, don't hike with fried chicken, it's like bear crack, they love it.

Ameristralia,1jk2kk,Emberglo,2,Sat Aug 3 04:57:16 2013 UTC,"Yea, but they're pretty easy to kill.  Most of my friends that hunt them use .22s.  Cougar attacks are so rare, but there have been a few near me lately, so I carry a good stout belt knife when I'm out alone."
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,kgb_agent_zhivago,2,Sat Aug 3 08:31:38 2013 UTC,Why would you hunt such a pretty kitty?
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,Emberglo,2,Sat Aug 3 08:39:19 2013 UTC,"Well, partly it's population maintenance.  When there are too many they start coming into town and killing pets and such.  We had three right in the middle of the capital city last year.  And partly it's for sport.  I've never done it.  I prefer to hunt things I can eat or use somehow."
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,kgb_agent_zhivago,2,Sat Aug 3 08:57:22 2013 UTC,Ah that's fair. I take it you're probably in Alberta or somewhere up around there. At least you're not in Florida--since it's definitely illegal there.
Ameristralia,1jk2kk,Emberglo,2,Sat Aug 3 09:03:57 2013 UTC,I'm in Idaho actually!  We have a huge density of them here.  One hunts where I like to hike and I find kills pretty often. It's really cool.  Apparently it's really only the young or very old or sick ones you have to worry about. A healthy adult will pretty much never hunt a person.

CHARLOTTE  Food:  Price's Chicken Coop - Widely regarded as some of the best fried chicken in the South  Bad Daddy's Burger Bar - if you want a big greasy North Ameristralian burger and a cold beer to wash it down, this is the place.  Booze:  The Philosopher's Stone - I haven't spent too much time in Charlotte at legal drinking age, but this bar stood out to me.  Far too many bars in Charlotte try hard to be upscale and glossy.  This place is divey like a bar should be.  Pool table, decent beer selection, good tunes on the jukebox, no buttoned-up ex-frat boys.  Neighborhoods:  NoDa - Cool artsy neighborhood.  Walkable with a number of restaurants, bars, music venues, etc.  Plaza Midwood - This was the cool area to hang out when I lived in Charlotte.  Funky shops and restaurants.  Very diverse (or at least it was in the early 2000's)  ATLANTA  Food:  Gunshow - this place is supposed to be awesome.  All my ATL friends swear by it.  Also my friend cooks here and he's incredibly talented so I stand by this place even though I haven't been yet.  Empire State South - ridiculously good.  The chef Hugh Acheson is a master of Southern cooking.  Booze:  Brick Store Pub - If you like beer, go here.  'nuff said.  Sweetwater Brewery - Take a tour of Atlanta's best brewery.  By tour I mean look at some machinery and then get super drunk.  They even have a beer that is meant for drinking while smoking weed.  Good stuff.  Clermont Lounge - ""where strippers go to die""  That sounds bad, but this place is great.  Epitome of a dive.  Drink some tallboys and enjoy the ancient strippers.  This place is seriously an Atlanta institution.  You must go at least once.  Neighborhoods:  East Atlanta Village aka EAV - cool, young, hip area.  Definitely a good neighborhood just to walk around and see what's good.  Little 5 - the hipster hood.  lots of hip shops, bars, venues, street art.  Check out Criminal Records.  Miscellaneous:  Turner Field -  Go see a Brave's game!  Turner field is awesome and the Braves are having a pretty good season this year.  Music venues - The Earl, The Tabernacle, Variety Playhouse, The Drunken Unicorn.  There are lots of good music venues in ATL to check out.  Some of the bigger bands to come out of Atlanta include The Black Lips, Deerhunter, Mastodon, not to mention loads of hip hop."

What season did you go in? the dry season is so much easier because the humidity is down around 40-50% and the wet isn't too bad but the bit in between is the worst humidity ever because the rains haven't come yet.

We have well insulated houses which can cope with the winters without much heating (our winters aren't lady justly harsh, just our homes are designed to cope with them well with minimal heating.) so this keeps the heat in. We have no AC, and fans don't work with the current humidity.   I've done 35C in France and Florida. It was uncomfortable (I'm Scottish, of course it was harsh for me), however I'm finding the current 25 as bad as 35 in Florida due to our insulation and lack of AC.

Ameristralia,1inysd,patgeo,10,Sat Jul 20 18:49:21 2013 UTC,I think almost a thousand people have died now from the heat wave. Maybe it is actually a serious problem?
Ameristralia,1inysd,SmallJon,5,Sat Jul 20 02:14:24 2013 UTC,"I'm finding it's actually cooler outside than in. It's not just not having AC etc. but it's the furnishing that are supposed to make the house feel more warm and snug. The thick carpets, rugs, curtains. Then there's the heavily insulated walls, roofs and triple glazing windows to trap as much heat in as possible. That's what we Brits invest in to deal with our climate.   What I don't get is people here believe that Brits have never experienced heat above 30c or 40 and don't know how bad it is. I've been to various countries around the med and I would much prefer to live in 40c+ weather I've experienced there, in a white walled, tile floored air conditioned building than 29c where I am now. It's especially bad at night because the heat just doesn't escape. It feels like a green house with the stagnant air."
Ameristralia,1inysd,kanjinamer,4,Sat Jul 20 05:47:50 2013 UTC,"My mother collapsed this week and broke her arm, it's very serious. Unlike America or Australia, we don't have air conditioning and our houses are built for cold, not heat. We can't stand it."

Turn off your AC. Turn off your ceiling fans. Lock yourself in a small room padded with thick insulation that's designed to keep cold and rain out and heat in. Come back in 6 hours and let me know how it goes.  30C isn't hot when you live in a white-walled home functionally designed to repel heat, pumping AC 24/7, has a pool, ceiling fans, etc. But here in the UK our houses are designed to keep heat in, and very few people have AC or a pool or AC etc. That is why these weather warnings have been broadcast."
Ameristralia,1inysd,ChoPT,3,Sat Jul 20 05:36:09 2013 UTC,My grandparents lock the house up and heat the stupid thing to 30C in Winter (and still complain about the cold). I can't stand being in the lounge-room (where the heater is).  Yet I've worked through many a 45C+ day outside with no breeze or shade just fine.    I suppose it would be something similar to the problem the UK is having.  My body is primed for the 10-20C normal weather not 30C.

It'd be best to set up in Freo or another nearby suburb and take the ferry when you want to go out.  There is a half-price Tuesday option on one of the ferry lines, I can't recall which.

Ameristralia,1ijm17,imnotacrazyperson,16,Thu Jul 18 15:27:39 2013 UTC,"We have that too:   Jelly: Reduction of fruit juice and sugar, often needs to be thickened with pectin.  Best for PB&J sandwiches. Jam: Reduction of mashed whole fruit and sugar.  Best on toast. Preserves: Reduction of un-mashed whole fruit and sugar, to which additional whole fruit is added later in the process.  You end up with a consistency somewhere between jelly and jam, with chunks of whole fruit suspended in it.  Best on English muffins."
Ameristralia,1ijm17,anyways_vs_anyway,10,Thu Jul 18 19:38:40 2013 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot about preserves.  Usually when I see it, it was purchased by accident."

Ameristralia,1ijm17,famousonmars,16,Fri Jul 19 06:02:23 2013 UTC,A clarification about 'biscuits and gravy' may also be in order.
Ameristralia,1ijm17,Ninjapork,18,Thu Jul 18 19:35:47 2013 UTC,"That's a southern Northern breakfast food and it is damn delicious.  Also, a bajillion calories per tablespoon.  Sadly, it is a rare treat where I'm from.  Biscuits would be the small hunk of bread variety that are a little hard on the outside but soft and flaky on the inside.  The gravy is a white creamy sauce usually with chunks of sausage.  You usually serve the biscuits to your plate first, then ladle the gravy over that and eat with a fork.    Then you try not to cry about the blissful party playing across your palate, and enjoy.  EDIT: and yes, the gravy is so thick, you only need a fork."
Ameristralia,1ijm17,famousonmars,3,Thu Jul 18 19:52:16 2013 UTC,When I was going to college in the 1960's sausage and gravy was 35 cents.  I ate that shit for 3 years straight.  Tasty.

Ameristralia,1ijm17,SmallJon,8,Fri Jul 19 05:09:25 2013 UTC,"here's an image. Biscuits and gravy are a breakfast meal in North ameristralia's southern states. They are made with these biscuits, which are soft like a pastry, and sausage gravy. It is possibly the best tasting breakfast you can have, if made right, and is usually eaten as the only part of the meal since it's pushing 700 calories. If you're in the NA South and you feel like you could eat a whole horse, get some for breakfast ""with a side of home fries"", which are these, at almost any restaurant or diner."
Ameristralia,1ijm17,famousonmars,4,Thu Jul 18 21:30:11 2013 UTC,"I gotta say that the best biscuits and gravy I ever had was ironically in a little breakfast joint in Los Gatos, CA."

Although being Australian we seem to use cookie more than the Brits when referring to a softer sweet biscuit, presumably due to NorthAmeristralian influences.  So to summarize I would make some cheese and vegemite bikkies for the kids if we ran out of chocolate cookies and they didn't want a scone with jam and cream."

Teach him how to tip - Australian's never tip. Never. Not waiters, not taxi drivers, nobody.  If you as a passenger round up a $19 taxi fare to $20 in Australia it's a big deal.  Take him to a restaurant with bottomless drinks or fries.  The insane amounts of food you can get cheaply in the US is stunning.  Show him the poor neighborhood.  I was always shocked when I went to the US - that you could turn down the wrong road, and there would be white-washed houses made of wood (shotgun houses?), and people sitting oustide them.  The stark contrast between rich & poor in the USA is astonishing to me - considering its meant to be the richest country in the World.  Show him mountains - because they are virtually non-existent in Australia.  If he likes sport, then take him to a game. Football, Baseball, Basketball .. whatever's in season.  Tell him to make sure he has Travel Insurance - because he might not have thought of it. Medical care is free in Australia.  Going to a doctor is free.  Prescriptions cost $30. Going to ER or Hospital is free. I've heard that the US is a bit different."

A shotgun house is a specific style architecture. There are plenty of low income neighborhoods with other forms of small houses.   The stark contrast between rich & poor in the USA is astonishing to me - considering its meant to be the richest country in the World.   So I'm curious, are the rich less rich in Australia or the poor less poor? If one does not have a job in Australia, what are ones living conditions? I would think that government provided housing would be apartments, so that a house with a tiny yard would be superior.  I've been to Canada, England and the Philippines. Obviously the Philippines, being a third world country, has no social safety net so there are children so poor they live in the streets and in garbage dumps. As far as the other two, I never ended up being in a poor neighborhood, but I never went looking for one. What does a poor neighborhood look like in Australia?"

What kind of house does a person making average salary for Western Austrailia (Apparently A$72,800)  live in and does such a person tend to rent or own?"
Ameristralia,1ilbs4,illyarrie,1 point,Sat Jul 20 10:46:55 2013 UTC,"That is highly subsidized housing. Owned by the State Government.  Rented out to people on low incomes. Rent = 25% of gross assessable income.  Eligiblity Criteria to be put on list = Assessable Income less than $430 - $930 per week depending on how many people would live in the house.  You can be on the waiting list for a few years before you get State housing.    Example of how it works: If you're a couple, and earning less than $670 per week, then you could get a Homeswest State government housing and pay no more than $170 /week rent.  If you were a couple on unemployment benefit, you would be paid $430 by the Federal government per week (for both of you).  Then the rent would be $110/week.  The lowest normal market rent here is $350/w for a 3 bedroom house (which is high by australian standards - but wages are high here at the moment)."

Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens lava tubes, Multnomah Falls, Columbia River Gorge, etc.  Go floating down the Sandy River close to Oxbow Park. Bring a cooler of drinks with you (no cops on the water) and float for a few hours. On a hot day it's amazing, the river has spots that are perfect for swimming as well. Here's a video I found of the potential, there will be other people doing the same thing who you can befriend while tubing. It's seriously my favorite thing to do in Portland.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1mDeW3fitw  Go shopping. Stuff is way cheaper here than in Australia and Portland has no sales tax. Foreigners always seem to like outlet malls for some reason. Timbers game if possible might also be fun.

My wife is not arachnophobic but she doesn't like them being in the same room as her so I usually have to relocate them which is usually done with some kind of jar or bug catcher because they do bite if they feel threatened.   I have only been bitten once, when one crawled into a sock that I decided put on. It was inside the house so I wasn't checking for spiders. It was like a good little scratch, well two little scratches. It hurt a bit to put a shoe on but the pain was gone in a few minutes. In general you can pick them up if you want to but most people wouldn't."

I once drowned one in a cup for her (long story) but refused to get rid of it, made her take care of it. She couldn't deal with it still being in the house even dead, so she went to flush the dead spider and cup of water. She poured it in the toilet and flushed the second it hit the water. As she back away from the toilet, the strand of web that it had attached inside the cup while alive PULLED THE DEAD SPIDER OUT OF THE SWIRLING TOILET AND LAUNCHED IT AT MY SISTERS FACE.

Ameristralia,1ib23n,anndor,9,Mon Jul 15 09:53:42 2013 UTC,I have never picked my feet off the ground so quickly. You have completely ruined my night with these tales of spiders.
Ameristralia,1ib23n,RobotApocalypse,9,Mon Jul 15 03:35:14 2013 UTC,Spiders in your pillow.
Ameristralia,1ib23n,RobotApocalypse,3,Mon Jul 15 03:54:35 2013 UTC,"A couple years ago our Christmas tree was infested with what we later found out were harmless jumping spiders.  We didn't know what they were, at first, just that suddenly there was a spider on the ceiling, then a second, then we saw a third, then a fourth, then we saw the tree was almost covered in them. In the space of 15 minutes we'd killed like 30 spiders, but we eventually just gave up.  I decided to take one for the team and figure out what they were. My roommate had gotten a really good, terrifying, picture of a couple of them with his SLR, so I had good odds of finding one. In the process of killing them we saw them jumping around, so I figured ""spiders that jump"" would be an effective Google image search.  So I'm sitting at my computer, skin crawling as I scroll past all sorts of awful spider pictures, one foot tucked up under my knee and the other swinging near the floor.  Suddenly I feel a brush of something against my leg. I have never in my life moved that fast. I screamed in a way I didn't even think I could anymore and was suddenly in the living room, hyperventilating.   It turned out to have just been my cat walking under my chair and I started laughing, but it took quite a while for my heart rate and breathing to go back to normal. I also decided to call it quits on the Google search, haha."
Ameristralia,1ib23n,squat251,6,Mon Jul 15 17:50:33 2013 UTC,"slightly  You should be able to just shoo him away, they are very timid, basically harmless and rarely bite.  Great for eating cockroaches and mozzies."
Ameristralia,1ib23n,RobotApocalypse,9,Mon Jul 15 01:19:51 2013 UTC,"True, I never kill them but doesn't stop you from getting a bit of a shock when they just appear on something unexpectedly.  A spider that is bigger than your palm always commands some attention."

I'm not ashamed to say, I ran away, hid in another room with the door shut and had a few smokes before I came back out to deal with them.."
Ameristralia,1ib23n,RobotApocalypse,3,Mon Jul 15 11:17:03 2013 UTC,"Huh, never seen a huntsman act that agro before.  Maybe it was because you had them cornered in that cupboard?"

Ameristralia,1i8qnq,TragicEther,9,Sun Jul 14 01:44:57 2013 UTC,"from wikipedia for those interested   Axe was launched in France in 1983 by Unilever. It was inspired by another of Unilever's brands, Impulse.     Unilever were keen to capitalize on Axe's French success and the rest of Europe from 1985 onwards, later introducing the other products in the range. Unilever were unable to use the name Axe in the United Kingdom and Ireland due to trademark problems so it was launched as Lynx.[1] The European launch of the deodorant was followed by success in Latin America and moderate impact in Asia and Africa. In the new millennium, the brand has launched with great success in the United States and Canada."

Especially considering the brand started in France as Axe. Also the fact that the company sells it as Axe in more countries than it does Lynx."

Ameristralia,1i8qnq,CDBSB,1 point,Sun Jul 14 17:36:35 2013 UTC,I think there is a very fine line between the first two - doesn't deodorant just mask odor by being an alternative smell?

Ameristralia,1i7smj,chaseisbarber,3,Sun Jul 14 02:31:38 2013 UTC,"Never seen it in a can, but it's still surprising that a glass bottle can contain all of that flavor."

Ameristralia,1i7smj,BeardedDuck,12,Fri Jul 26 09:40:42 2013 UTC,"Barq's is a bit different than most others. For one, it's caffeinated; not many root beers have caffeine added. Two: ""the bite"" makes it an acquired taste (I, for one, don't like root beers with ""bite"")."
Ameristralia,1i7smj,Adult_Username,2,Sat Jul 13 19:30:24 2013 UTC,"I was going to dispute your caffeine claim but a little research reveals that Diet Barq's contains no caffeine, but regular Barqs does.  I usually drink the Diet variety."

Ameristralia,1i7smj,stoshumala17,14,Tue Jul 16 18:03:19 2013 UTC,"I personally think A&W root beer, straight from the tap, is the best pop EVER! However, from a can or 2-liter I don't think it is as amazing.  Also, if you like root beer, you will probably love ginger beer. (non alcoholic) so much deliciousness squeezed into one drink! It's hard to find but when you do... Holy smokes! The BF is a a home brewer and we are going to try our hand at making ginger beer for our kegerator as soon as we are done brewing what we have now. Boo-yah!"
Ameristralia,1i7smj,exatron,5,Sat Jul 13 16:39:48 2013 UTC,"It's funny, I had some Aussie ginger beer, had a kangaroo on the bottle and such, was the best I have ever had."
Ameristralia,1i7smj,stoshumala17,3,Sun Jul 14 00:11:25 2013 UTC,Is there a difference between ginger beer and ginger ale or is it just 2 names for the same thing?
Ameristralia,1i7smj,Mastershroom,7,Sat Jul 13 18:59:51 2013 UTC,"Actually, yes. There is a huge difference. They are made differently, to start. Ginger ale is just carbonated soda made to have a ginger taste while ginger beer is actually brewed and fermented with ginger. Ginger ale is much more carbonated, almost like 7-up or Sprite with a slight ginger tang. Ginger beer, while still slightly carbonated, is a little thicker than a pop and much sweeter than ale. (Think more syrup-y, like an old school Coke) Typically, ginger beer tastes better from a glass bottle while ginger ale tastes fine anyway. I can not drink ginger ale straight but I could drink loads of ginger beer.   Hope this helps!"
Ameristralia,1i7smj,Squeakopotamus,5,Sat Jul 13 19:13:42 2013 UTC,And the best ginger ale is Vernor's.

Ameristralia,1i7smj,BALRICISADUDE,3,Sat Jul 13 21:44:30 2013 UTC,"Yes it does.  Another question.  If ginger beer is brewed and fermented, how is there no alcohol content to it?  Is there just not enough sugar to start with (would also explain the slight carbonation) or is it distilled off?"
Ameristralia,1i7smj,Zebleblic,5,Sat Jul 13 19:29:56 2013 UTC,"There is alcohol content, but it is too low to count as an alcoholic beverage. It is something like .5%, I doubt you could even get tipsy if you drank a ton of these :)"

Ameristralia,1i7smj,tlock8,3,Sat Jul 13 20:55:23 2013 UTC,"It's funny we have ginger beer everywhere here and I do love it, both alcoholic and non alike. Root beer just is very rare in comparison.   Me and a mate made a batch of homebrewed ginger beer many years ago and when it was ""ready"" we tried it and thought it tasted awful. So we tipped most of it out and only saved a few bottles that we sort of hid at the back of the fridge.  One drunken night a year or so later we pulled out a bottle and said ""why not give it a try now"". It was so good after that extra time we almost cried that we had tipped the rest out.  So give your HB ginger beer the chance we never did.  Edit: I became It as it should have read in the first place"

Ameristralia,1i7smj,iamnotacola,3,Sat Jul 13 18:08:59 2013 UTC,"Dads has really good flavor, but it lacks carbonation.  It's like drinking flat root beer."

Root beer has been available in Aus on and off in several incarnations, more notably as a flavour of Jolt cola. Jolt creamy soda has always been my ideal beverage, and I still lament it's disappearance. I also wish cherry cola was more readily available here..."

Ameristralia,1i7smj,Tuskuul,2,Sat Jul 13 18:42:11 2013 UTC,A&W is amazing if it's from a restaurant that makes it fresh on site.  A bottle or can from Pepsi or Coke (can't recall who makes it) is sub par crap.
Ameristralia,1i7smj,sheriff1980,2,Sat Jul 13 19:01:45 2013 UTC,"I live in New Mexico. Here, there's a local microbrewery which makes the absolute best root beer I've ever had."
Ameristralia,1i7smj,squat251,2,Sat Jul 13 19:13:26 2013 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Jones when it comes to root beer. They're mostly famous for their unusual soda flavors (around Thanksgiving time, for instance, they make turkey & gravy soda) but they make a mean root beer. And, if they haven't changed their recipe, they use legit sugar instead of corn syrup, which makes a big difference."
Ameristralia,1i7smj,BigWillyBilly,1 point,Sat Jul 13 19:56:41 2013 UTC,I was in the States a few years ago and I couldn't understand why Coke tasted so different over there to what it tastes like here. It wasn't until I learned you use high fructose corn syrup and we use actual sugar cane sucrose. They both tasted sweet but a very different taste.
Ameristralia,1i7smj,Warbalist,2,Sun Jul 14 13:55:29 2013 UTC,"If you're looking for good root beer, I'd highly recommend Barq's: it's sweeter than most of the other big-names (like A&W and Mug), it seems a bit thicker then them, in my experience, and it has a nice little bite to it.  That said, I'd also recommend trying out some of the small-time brands, typically the ones that come in glass bottles.  Also, don't immediately discredit and ignore generic or store-brand root beers, as they can still be pretty good, and are typically a LOT cheaper than the big-name brands."
Ameristralia,1i7smj,Squaby7,2,Sat Jul 13 20:15:31 2013 UTC,"1819 will always be my favorite. A&W is best from the tap, along with other drinks."
Ameristralia,1i7smj,GreenEggs_n_Sam,2,Sat Jul 13 20:18:20 2013 UTC,"There are several different options here, I'll outline the big four and how they differ.  So the big 4 root beers you can get just about anywhere are: Barqs A&W Mug IBC  Understand I am not placing any of these on a higher level of prestige than another.  It all depends on personal taste and what is better in the moment.  Also I'm sure there are thousands of ""not big chain"" brands that people will swear by.  But this is the main 4 I've seen all my life and how they compare....  Barqs has a sharp flavor.  Their slogan used to be (is?) ""Barqs has Bite"" which fits because the sassafras flavoring is much sharper than other root beers.  Its a full flavor for sure.  It tastes great when its super cold because the temperature combined with the staccato flavor is a great combination.  On the scale of flavor Barqs is on the far end of the sharp flavor scale.  A&W is the opposite of Barqs.  A&W was originally (still is kind of) a restaurant.  We had an original one where I grew up, they had incredible chili dogs and they kept their frosted glass mugs in a freezer so when you ordered a root beer the glass would be frosted with ice and freezing.  The flavor of the A&W root beer is creamy.  The sassafras is smoothed with a cream flavoring that gives it a silky taste.  While Barqs is a sharp stinging flavor, A&W is a smooth dripping flavor.  (also A&W makes an Orange Cream Soda that has the same silky creamy sensation, but orange soda instead of root beer.)  Mug is a cheaper chain soda.  On the scale it is closer to the A&W side.  I personally find it way too sweet, like it has too much HFCS.  Mug has more flavoring than A&W but not in a good way, instead of creating a signature flavor, its just over syruped like the HFCS.  Not my favorite.  IBC is a great root beer.  It almost always comes in a glass bottle which instantly makes it taste better than any canned soda.  It has a stronger flavor and the flavor is sharper, it falls more on the Barqs side of the scale.  It also has more carbonation than most other root beers so the fizz gives it a stronger bite.  Its flavor is more signature than Barqs with a darker richer taste.  I never pass up the chance for a cold glass bottle ICB.  Hope this gives some perspective.  A&W is a very good root beer to start with, particularly if you can frost a mug before drinking.  If you could try to get a Barqs and an ICB.  Both are worth trying and are quite unique compared to each other and A&W."
Ameristralia,1i7smj,othergeneration,2,Sat Jul 13 20:25:03 2013 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to write that out mate, that's a great perspective on the various brands. I really enjoyed the creamy finish to the A&W I tried, it did remind me of creaming soda.  The sharp Barqs has me intrigued, I do like a sharp edge to drinks. I'll see if I can track some down.  And I now have a mug frosting in freezer to do them justice.  Cheers mate!"
Ameristralia,1i7smj,MotuiM,2,Sun Jul 14 03:01:49 2013 UTC,"There is a beer brewery, Abita, who also brews root beer. By far the best I've ever had."
Ameristralia,1i7smj,squat251,2,Sat Jul 13 20:34:33 2013 UTC,Easiest to get ahold of and delicious would be IBC. Best rootbeer I've ever had? A Louisiana beer brewery called Abita does the absolute best non-alcoholic rootbeer.

I lived at a field research station and that was the only cheese they would offer us. Even the cheapest american cheeses taste better than that to me.

I've tried it several different ways and even had my grandmother attempt to sneak some into a sandwich on me once.  I'm sorry, but I find it disgusting.  And I know I'm not alone - including my cousin who was born, raised, and is still living in Sydney.  To call vegemite an acquired taste is a bit of an understatement I think.

Ameristralia,1hu476,swedemanqb04,0,Mon Jul 8 05:08:44 2013 UTC,In America we are supposed to take pride about our colors. We even have a set a rules to treat the flag. I love my nations colors first.
Ameristralia,1hu476,stevo1078,6,Mon Jul 8 05:13:32 2013 UTC,"Well fuck me in the ass and call me chipper. Flags are pretty serious business around here? It's a piece of decorated fabric.  To be fair Australias colours are also Red, White and Blue.  As are Chile, Cambodia, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Samoa, United Kingdom and Russia.  To get your knickers in a twist over a logo designed to designate your country of origin of which you had not choice of being born in is just ridiculous. I appreciate the U.S.A and the majority of its people but ""I love my nations colors"" is just pig headed to think your country owns those 3 specific colours when it comes to flag design.  Damn..."

As I stated in a comment thread below:   There's a difference between protesting by burning a flag, and honorably discarding.

Ameristralia,1hu476,bmlbytes,6,Mon Jul 8 07:33:26 2013 UTC,"Yes, OP colored it. The first part was humor.  And it's some harmless fun with a novelty flag.   It's also technically illegal to wear the flag as a piece of clothing. You can not use it as advertisement or hang an advertisement below the flag. It can not be printed on anything meant for temporary use.  I think you can see how ridiculous some of the prohibitions in the flag code are in today's society."
Ameristralia,1hu476,NymphoCpl614,-5,Mon Jul 8 07:44:56 2013 UTC,"The difference between you and I is I don't see it as a novelty.  I look at the flag and I feel proud. Not of our government, but of this nation.  What I think is ridiculous is that people have blatant disregard to it. It's not hard to NOT right or color on it, to NOT print it on napkins, plates, and disposable table aprons. Use red, white, and blue, but not the flag.  Do I agree that some stuff could be updated, yes. I would love to see my wife in a US Flag bikini on 4th of July. lol  But since it's written, I just won't do it, and I would hope some people have respect to not do so, either."

Ameristralia,1hm0ft,UtterFlatulence,3,Thu Jul 4 09:26:47 2013 UTC,"I wish that, today of all days, South Ameristralians were able to visit us Northerners.  On the 4th of July dieting is strictly forbidden.  Overconsumption is mandatory--both food and beverages.  Clothing, what little is worn, must be comfortable and good for lying in the grass or on the beach.  Lots of classic cars come out of storage and cruise Main Street or along the beach.  People attempt to partake in some sports they haven't done since high school--often with amusing results.  Radios tuned to classic rock provide the backbeat for the day's festivities.  Overconsume some more.  Maybe some afternoon delight. Probably some afternoon delight.  Two aromas are commonly sensed:  grilling meat and coconut-oiled skin.  The sun shines a little brighter on this day.  The hotdogs tastes a little better.  Neighbors are out, and people speak to each other more than they will for the rest of the year.  You consume some more--just waiting for the evening. Life is good.    And then...nightfall...  The first airburst is usually a loud, singular blast,  and then the fun begins.  Indescribably beautiful blooms, firefalls and whistling curlicues blossom, burst and blast accompanied by the oohs, ahhs and cheers of the gathered multitudes.  The displays are often accompanied by patriotic music in synch with the launchings and detonations.  This goes on for several minutes before the grand finale- when fireworks are blasted nonstop, time after time intertwining and overlapping each other with visual and aural awesomeness.  When it's over, the crowd cheers and claps, and then packs up to head back home--satiated with food, beer and explosives for one more year.  Kids say, ""That was the best time ever!""    They're right.  Every year, the 4th of July is the best."

We had a young family living next door a while ago, where there was clear problems and we reported them multiple times. Police were called more than once. Those people have moved now, but I see them around town and the kids are still with them. The father is a raving lunatic, and a drug addict. The mother is not a terrible person, but she is quite neglectful and possibly a drug addict herself.   The kids were taken from them for a couple of weeks after the father flipped out and threatened everyone with a broken bottle. They got the kids back, but nothing changed. It's just so frustrating when you try your hardest to help, but nothing really happens. I really hope I never have to hear about something horrific happening to those kids :("

Ameristralia,1hcqqc,bohmapik,1 point,Sun Jun 30 19:44:34 2013 UTC,"A great number of automotive enthusiasts don’t quite know the difference between a muscle car and pony car, and even many “experts” disagree on how these car classifications are defined. We consider muscle cars to be full-size cars or larger, built with the focus of serious straight line acceleration, and equipped with high-horsepower big-block V-8 engines (or larger). On the other hand we consider pony cars to have slightly smaller body dimensions (typically midsize cars) and feature a less powerful V-8 engine than muscle cars.  Additionally, we think that a pony car cannot contain the highest output engine available for that model, otherwise we would classify that vehicle as a muscle car.  Although we recognize some of the differences between pony cars and muscle cars; we generally use ‘muscle cars’ as a catchall term to describe factory produced hotrods, including pony cars. Check out the cool graphic from CarDomain.com below that shows some information on perhaps the three most iconic pony cars of all-time. Make sure to cast your vote below on which American pony car that you think is the greatest.   TL:DR You're being a pedant."

I've never heard anyone go out of their way to say a camaro isn't a muscle car. It made me curious so I went to look it up. So, I googled ""pony car vs muscle car"".   The first hit, from which I quoted, was: http://www.zeroto60times.com/blog/2013/04/classic-american-pony-cars/  The next one, http://forums.motortrend.com/70/9180626/the-general-forum/muscle-car-vs-pony-car/index.html , is fairly indicative of all of them. The distinction between pony car and muscle car, and whether or not pony cars are muscle cars is so blurry as to be ridiculous to argue over. No one can agree on anything, so picking a hard-line stance is silly.   Your post just reminded me of the people in youtube commenting on what genre a band is.  ""I love hardcore.""  ""u ideeot. This is metal.""  ""u guise are dumb. It's metalcore.""  ""Well, technically, going off the rythm base and the use of the 7-string guitar, it's grind-core.""  ""NO! They wrote it while homeless.

Maybe that wouldn't be a good enough source for you either? I could plan a road-trip and drive to their headquarters for you, except they don't list an address. The registrant of the domain lives in  St Augustine, Florida. I could drive for ~20 hours and personally ask him for the exact specifications required to be a muscle car versus a pony car, and whether muscle cars are inclusive of pony cars. Is it okay if I just get clarification on models, or should I get a database export of engine size, horse-power, wheel-base, body-length, etc so we have an exact definition?"

The Aboriginal's/Koori people cook it in a coal earth oven traditionally. The tail portion seems to be prized. The fillet cuts are similar to lamb backstrap and are excellent with a robust rub like a morrocan ras el hanout then pan seared. The mince is excellent but it does need a splash of oil. I use it all the time in Mapo Tofu Chilli warning. Use pressed silken tofu and freshly crushed schezuan pepper.   The sausages, colloqially know as ""Kanga-Bangers"" are invariably terrible and best avoided. Lean, dry and often under seasoned. I've never had a good one.  I've never tried it with the skin on or any of the offal so I can't speak to that but I have the sudden urge to murder a roo and eat try its liver. Bad luck skippy."

If you cook it really slowly, it will eventually fall apart like pulled meat, and make for excellent stews.  The best way of all is to wrap a tail up and chuck it under the coals overnight.   If you cook it anywhere in the middle, it will be like eating boot leather. This is why its not been very popular, if you cook it like a regular steak, its horrid."

Cheap as chips, nearly 0% fat due to the lean nature of the beast and pound for pound the best place you will find protein in any meat/food I suppose. So it is an amazing bit of meat. A lot of the time esp. in Coles they will be marinated steaks but fear not, mince, non marinated etc can be easily found as well. Whilst I love roo meat, emu meat is where its truly at ;)"

Ameristralia,1h4889,simoalley,1 point,Thu Jun 27 19:05:49 2013 UTC,"Well, that's a complex issue, but it boils down to a few basic points.  First, there's a set of guidelines for classification in Australia. If it fails one of the major guidelines - one of which is sexual violence, the one used in the case of SR4, due to the anal probe weapon - then it's refused classification until it's edited or passes appeal. Which doesn't seem like a reason, until:  Two, our system works differently from the US. In the US, it's an industry rating board, and games that are unrated are still legal for sale - though in practice, many retailers won't sell content that's not rated by the ESRB, nor with Microsoft licence content for release without an ESRB rating.  In Australia, the Ratings board isn't an industry board, it's a government-run board, which gives their ratings far more legal power. It's not a case of refusal of sale due to policy, it's a case of being illegal for sale by Australian retailers.  Three, the ratings board tend to be very...varied in their ratings. They'll pass games which should be 18+ as M15+, an unrestricted sale category, because there wasn't a rating higher before this year. But they're also extremely strict on any Drug depictions and certain types of violence. It doesn't help that the ratings guidelines haven't changed in quite a while, and when they do, it's generally only minor updates, so we're still working on standards from long, long ago."

It would have been improved, if not for the fact that gaining the 18+ rating for video games changed fuck all, it's just a slightly tweaked and re-badged M15+ rating. Once we fix that, it's a lot better.  As for not having as much freedom, well, I suggest a revision to your stance, fellow matriot."
Ameristralia,1h4889,Churba,2,Fri Jun 28 03:10:06 2013 UTC,clearly koalas and dingos were holding that author hostage...
Ameristralia,1h4889,Atekae,3,Fri Jun 28 03:11:27 2013 UTC,What games have been banned? I have clearly been living under a rock. Also unsubscribed from all gaming subreddits because of all the circlewanking.
Ameristralia,1h4889,Churba,3,Thu Jun 27 03:54:31 2013 UTC,"Well, recently in Australia, we've RC'ed Saint's Row 4, and State of Decay, an open world Zombie game.  So far, we've banned 35 Video games, with 17 either being banned after release or still being banned, 13 being released in an edited form and thus allowed classification, and nine being released with a rating, unedited. Saints row 4 and State of decay not being included in that total, since they've not completed the full review process yet."
Ameristralia,1h4889,simoalley,2,Thu Jun 27 04:28:02 2013 UTC,I didn't even want State of Decay until now. Now I must have it! Surely there are other ways that we can get these games though right? I used a proxy to get the proper L4D2. Surely that will still work?
Ameristralia,1h4889,simoalley,2,Thu Jun 27 04:42:55 2013 UTC,"Of course, there's always Grey market imports - which will get far larger in the future, as the next gen consoles have no region locking.   Or, of course, you can use a proxy with steam, or go the simpler route of having a trusted American friend gift you the game in exchange for the money via bank transfer or paypal or something."
Ameristralia,1h4889,Churba,2,Thu Jun 27 05:04:28 2013 UTC,Woah! Can you be gifted banned games? I guess because it's only illegal for them to sell it to Australians.
Ameristralia,1h4889,simoalley,2,Thu Jun 27 07:25:09 2013 UTC,"Yep. I picked up a non-censored copy of L4D2 that way, and I have Syndicate on Origin because a friend of mine bought a key and sent it to me.  It's illegal for sale, but not to own, or for a private citizen to import, AFAIK. It IS a violation of Steam's terms of service, I'm pretty sure, but I can't think of anyone that's had their account banned or game revoked as a result."
Ameristralia,1h4889,Churba,2,Thu Jun 27 07:34:24 2013 UTC,"Yeah, Gifts are acceptable. This is what I will be doing."
Ameristralia,1h4889,simoalley,2,Thu Jun 27 07:35:39 2013 UTC,I will try to find a friend with Steam overseas. I know a fair few people from playing co-op and stuff on Dark Souls.
Ameristralia,1h4889,Churba,1 point,Thu Jun 27 07:34:54 2013 UTC,"As long as you feel you can trust them with your money, that'll do fine. Be warned, it is against Steam's TOS, but I can't think of a case ever where a person has had their account banned or game license revoked for it."
Ameristralia,1h4889,Miroholic,2,Thu Jun 27 07:46:41 2013 UTC,"Yeah, there is that. I am pretty safe with one of them I think.  As far as illegal goes, I don't think there is anything that Steam could do if payments are outside of Steam. I just gave him 50 dollars as a gift, and in unrelated news he gave me this awesome game that is illegal to buy in Australia as a completely random gift. We are such good friends and all about love, peace and harmony."
Ameristralia,1h4889,simoalley,1 point,Thu Jun 27 11:30:36 2013 UTC,"While that's basically the attitude they take, you're completely wrong on the point that Steam can't do anything - they pretty much write themselves a strong Carte Blanche in the service agreement for using Steam. To use an absolutely ludicrous example, if they decided to ban an account because it was narrowed down to your account out of all steam users with a long series of coin-flips, they can absolutely do that.  BUT - They effectively never do. Really, they can do practically whatever they bloody well like, but generally they only stop playing nice when you fuck them around either in a very big way, or at length. But, they've historically never given a shit about this in the past, so as much as they CAN, so far they DON'T."
Ameristralia,1h4889,Atekae,2,Thu Jun 27 12:10:59 2013 UTC,Fair enough. That all seems pretty much what I was expecting. While I am not disputing any of that I just have a question.  How do they know? If giving games to friends are ok right? I have actually given heaps of games a gifts with nothing in return. So how do they know if you have arranged this?
Ameristralia,1h4889,panzerkampfwagen,1 point,Thu Jun 27 12:21:58 2013 UTC,"Valve track practically everything that goes down on steam, other than voice and conversations(I presume). The easiest way for them to know is to simply overlay which games have edited versions for Australia, and which games you were gifted by your foreign friends.  They can't know for absolute, concrete sure that I know of, but they can certainly establish a pattern that indicates it to be likely. They've got a shit-ton of data to play with, after all. Steam knows a hell of a lot about us, and can find out even more by establishing patterns between the data-points they have - I mean, they know when we play, where, with who and for how long, where and when we talk even if they don't know the content of the talk, the timing of our gifts, etc, etc."

As a northerner with a moderate interest in the political situation in the south (acquired from the southern TV program 'The Chaser's War on Everything'), my feeling has been that her moderate unpopularity has been her opposition to gay marriage (despite being an atheist), among other things, but not because she is a woman. This new guy, Kevin Rudd, supposedly has a short fuse, however. I think some tapes of him were leaked after he won the election in 07."
Ameristralia,1h3lnx,magniatude,6,Wed Jun 26 15:21:44 2013 UTC,"The situation is basically; Nobody likes Tony Abbot (leader of the opposition Liberal party), most people dislike both Julia Gillard (now formerly PM) and Kevin Rudd (2nd time PM now and Labor leader).  The party is in huge panic mode because they are getting smashed in approval rating to Abbot, and the election is right round the corner, so they are desperately doing anything to retain leadership.  Tony Abbot is just so unlikeable (I'd comparing him to say Mitt Romney except not quite so robotic), and everyone knows that the only reason our economy is doing alright atm is because of the last Liberal Leadership."

Ameristralia,1h3lnx,CDBSB,9,Wed Jun 26 16:08:09 2013 UTC,"And now for some facts:  Labor got into power after the September 2007 election. Gillard replaced Rudd as parliamentary party leader (and, therefore, PM) in June 2010 - which is a bit longer than ""a few months"", incidentally. Then there was an election in August 2010, which she narrowly won and was able to form government with the assistance of the Greens and Independents.  Rudd tried to get his old job back in February 2012... and lost. This cost his his job of Foreign Minister and saw him exiled to the outer darkness of the backbenches, publicly swearing fealty (but really plotting revenge). There was another challenge in March this year... sort of, given that Rudd didn't even show up for the caucus meeting and the vote ended up not happening. Cue months of frenzied media speculation about Labor's leadership woes (which had been an ongoing thing since the Feb. 2012 challenge, and conveniently ignored little details such as two Liberal state leaders being rolled, one of whom wasn't even in the country at the time), which resulted in Gillard trying to call the bluff of those who wanted Rudd back in... which didn't exactly work out for her.   some dumb slut   ಠ_ಠ  And when Gillard called people out on this sort of bullshit, she was accused of playing the ""sexism/misogyny card""..."

All Labor are doing is digging themselves a hole which they won't be able to get out of for at least 2 terms, so we're going to have the Liberals in until at least 2020.

While there isn't outright equality, homosexual couples do have some rights ( not marriage though) and its generally fairly well accepted. They are still discriminated against but things are slowly moving in the right direction. There's a general feeling that it shouldn't be too long before total legal equality (more and more politicians are saying that they're in favour of gay marriage - wether or not theyre pandering to constituents is unknown) but I still think we're a fair way off from total acceptance within society.  Australia could probably go toe to toe with the US in terms of bogan/rednecks per capita, especially in terms of racial and religious discrimination, but I don't think our society does so bad on the gay front. Seriously - the Gay Pride parade in Sydney each February is pretty huge, and nationally televised."

In reality, Rudd was becoming more unpopular, and also refused to be a part of or bow down to the union factions which ruled the party. The unions thought he was a megalomaniac and they weren't happy they weren't in control of their Labor party anymore, so they had him removed.

Ameristralia,1h2yej,LackingTact19,3,Sat Jun 29 12:28:43 2013 UTC,"I've also lived in Australia, and I have a degree in Australian Studies (yes, the field exists) so I'm not just pulling this completely out of my ass. Here's a bit of my reasoning:   Let's assume that the main difference between the two colonies at their inceptions (the cause of the dimensional split, so to speak) was sentiments towards the United Kingdom. The US colonists, while largely still considering themselves British, were effectively separatists. Most of them wanted to be there for one reason or another.  The Australians mostly started out as (largely petty) criminals. Those guilty of violent crimes were actually fairly few and far between. Mother England was becoming overcrowded and she saw this as a way of clearing out the ""riff raff,"" so to speak. (Steal a waistcoat? That's seven years transportation.) As a result, many of the Australian colonists longed for home, which they considered to be England, even for some time into the colonization process.  This can be seen in the way the two cultures developed. America tended to diverge, whereas Australia was more likely to mirror the trends of the UK. For example, a good portion Aussie art during the colonial period was landscapes, which were painted in a style reminiscent of English gardens and countryside (google John Glover). Americans tended to favor portraiture.   Australians have many of the same sports as the UK (rugby, soccer/football, cricket) whereas the most popular American sports (American football/gridiron, basketball, baseball) aren't as widely played in the UK/Australia. (Mind, I'm not saying no one plays these games, or that there's no overlap. I'm just looking at popularity trends.)  We can also look at the humor of the two countries. Australian humor tends to be more understated, relying on sarcasm and dry wit, whereas Americans prefer physical and observational comedy. Australia has more panel-style television shows (Good News Week, Your Gen). Off the top of my head, I can't think of a single American panel show.   These are some of the big cultural differences that can be attributed to pro- or anti-English sentiment. As someone mentioned, America had a war with the UK early on, which surely further informed our opinion of them. And Australia has since developed it's own unique culture, independent from the UK, but it took a bit longer.   Now for some similarities:  Architecture: Standing in various points of Sydney, you might swear you were in New York, San Fransisco or Vancouver.  An indigenous population ripe for fucking over: Trail of Tears, Stolen Generations, etc. A low-income, low-class group of people that tends to act horribly: White trash, bogans (you could probably say this about any country, but I personally think there are more similarities between these two groups than are shared with an analogous group of another country, e.g. cheap beers and mullets)  That's all I can think of at the moment, but I'm someone else could contribute more . Also, if any of this is incorrect or misleading, please don't bite my head off. I'm under-caffeinated, speaking in generalities and writing this from memory, so there are bound to be some lapses.   Also, I'm going to post this to the main thread."

Really, I don't know of any specific ones, but I know they exist. You should be able to find them easily in between asking your School(if you have one), and looking up Australian university study abroad programs. I know a few people who've done study abroad programs, I'll ask them for details and any advice on getting under the wire.  Most of the major east-coast cities have excellent universities - I can personally rate both Queensland University of Technology and University of Queensland extremely highly for Engineering(as well as a plesant climate), as well as RMIT, the Royal Melbourne Institute of technology. I'm not saying any of the Sydney schools are bad, just that I don't personally know them well enough to recommend them. I assume Perth, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra all have good schools too, but again, I don't know enough to say."

Ameristralia,1guuxl,GatorWills,1 point,Sun Jun 23 01:10:18 2013 UTC,About how much are you spending? Is it comparable to american universities?
Ameristralia,1guuxl,plopliar,2,Sun Jun 23 03:33:13 2013 UTC,"Yea actually. Despite how expensive everything else is, tuition is pretty similar - unless you compare it to going to a state school on in-state tuition. I'm in a masters program and it's about $15k per semester. I did my undergrad at CU Boulder and I was initially paying $16k per semester - until I got residency and then I was paying like $4k a semester. But when I was applying for grad school all of the other programs I was looking at in the states were around the $15k mark.  Also, although the necessities like groceries and booze and whatnot are more expensive the minimum wage is more than double here than it is in the states. I make in 2 weeks here (at a shit job) about the same that I'd make in about 6 weeks back in the states (at a shit job). I will say though, until you get a job it's a bit hard adjusting financially - just make sure you have plenty of extra cash for those first few weeks and you should be golden."
Ameristralia,1guuxl,JediCapitalist,1 point,Sun Jun 23 04:03:28 2013 UTC,"So, slightly off topic but not quite... You were paying $16k per semester at CU boulder but then ended up getting residency and paying $4k. How? I'm at Nebraska (lincoln) paying about $16k and (out of state) and have no idea how I could even ask for residency rates.  Regarding AUS prices, that's good to hear. I expected that all the necessities would be pretty expensive but I figured if I were to go down there I would try and find a shit job or something. What about financial aid? Do they help international students much?"
Ameristralia,1guuxl,Dark_Vulture83,2,Sun Jun 23 04:15:55 2013 UTC,"Oh man, getting residency is a huge bitch. It was definitely the most bureaucratic, drawn out, bullshit process I've ever had to deal with. I doubt the requirements are exactly the same for Nebraska, but just google ""in-state tuition University of Nebraska"" and you should find something with the requirements to obtain in-state tuition. For Colorado there were two ways you could get status as an in-state resident: (1) you could wait until you turn 22 and just submit an application, or (2) you could emancipate yourself from your parents (which essentially means that you can't receive any financial assistance from them, at all) and then submit an application. (There are other requirements too, but those are the sink-or-swim requirements). Either way, with all the forms you have to fill out and evidence that you have to produce and people you have to talk to, it is a bitch and a half, but totally worth it - $12k a semester is fuckin huge!   And for financial aid, like I said I don't know what it's like at other Aussie Unies but here at Melbourne Uni I get US federal financial aid. So I just have to fill out the FAFSA every semester and I get my loans."
Ameristralia,1guuxl,eggbert194,1 point,Sun Jun 23 04:56:43 2013 UTC,"That's what I was afraid of. I have contacted our financial aid office before with general questions and they seem to think that it's the most asinine request anyone could ever make. I was just wondering if you found a way to cheat the system or something. They said something once about withdrawing from school for a year and working a full time job as a state resident. But yeah, being able to save $12k per semester, even if only for my last year and a half at the university would be huge savings.  So I assume it's pretty much the same process then. Just fill out the FAFSA and get more debt, haha."
Ameristralia,1guuxl,Masquerade41,2,Sun Jun 23 05:54:45 2013 UTC,"Yea, they weren't too helpful in CO either - which doesn't come at any surprise really as you're essentially asking them to help you rip them off for almost $25k a year.   And yea, financial aid is the same. If you do decide to come, make sure you pick a school where US financial aid is offered. It's my understanding that it's only offered at certain international schools."

I was asking because I remember many years ago my mom telling me that I missed my opportunity for dual citizenship because I had to apply before I had turned 18.   I just surfed around starting with the link you provided and it would seem - I hope I'm interpreting this correctly - that anyone born since 1949 to an Australian citizen may be able to receive ""Citizenship by Descent"" status.  That's fine.  I just want the passport and the status any way I can get it.  Thinking about my first trek down under next year and contemplating looking for a job there.  I teach at a state college here in the US and I have no idea what opportunities would await me there.  But I can't wait to find out and I can't wait to find out if this is all possible.  Just called my mom (bloody hell, should I start saying mum?) and asked her if her passport was current and she has her original birth certificate. No to the first, yes to the second.  This will probably be an uphill battle fighting two countries worth of red tape, but I think I'm gonna give it the old college try!  Cheers!"

So our stereotypical view on the mexicans in the north is that they are (forbid  my ignorance if i'm wrong) they're annoying, much like our Tasmanians, this means that 'cunt' is used as a derogatory term, not used to show mateship.  TL;DR: call cunts mate, call mates cunt, call cunts cunt, call mates mate."
Ameristralia,1gna1t,cuttlefish10,2,Wed Jun 19 23:21:15 2013 UTC,"So, when referring to something's actual mate (i.e., the one it gets jiggy with), do you refer to those too as cunts?  For example, if the late Steve Irwin didn't know his American audience quite so well, might he say something like, ""This beaut' here attracts his cunt with a ritualistic mating (cunting?) dance""?  Edit: somehow a random ""l"" appeared at the end of the comment."
Ameristralia,1gna1t,AbeLincolnsFreckles,3,Thu Jun 20 04:26:00 2013 UTC,"ahh but you see, that's where it gets tricky, you cannot call someone a 'cunt' when you are attempting to mate with/start a friendship with them. Calling someone a cunt without them knowing that it is a friendly gesture is very off-putting and can lead to a confrontation."
Ameristralia,1gna1t,cuttlefish10,1 point,Thu Jun 20 05:11:32 2013 UTC,"So until you have officially established ""cuntship"" it is not okay to refer to the other as ""cunt."""

Instead of jumping fences and crossing deserts they cross an ocean and end up a continental United States worth away from anybody who gives a fuck or thinks they could even survive.

My roommate and I just used to call it peanut butter & fluff sandwiches...but we did have a friend who called it ""Fluff Nutter"" and another person I knew called them ""Nutter Fluffers"", so maybe that's a regional name for some of us Northerners.  And yeah, ""Fluff Nutter"" can have another meaning..as my roommate and I used to giggle when our friend called our sandwiches such.  Another good recipe that I use marshmallow fluff for is ""no cook s'mores"".  Spread some marshmallow fluff on one graham cracker, Nutella on another graham cracker, put together like a sandwich.  (I don't know if you have graham crackers in the South, but you can use something like a wheatmeal biscuit or digestive biscuit...a sweet biscuit essentially.) I used to do these with kids I looked after, and now with my nieces and nephews. Even though they were a treat for the kids, I couldn't help but eat them because they are so good!"

Straight off the line the biscuit pieces are so crunchy it is ridiculous. This makes such a difference it would blow your mind.  And then there is the frankentime. We used to grab one off the line and walk it over to the magnum line and dip it in the molten magnum chocolate, pull it out and let it harden from the cold of the gaytime and then redip it into the magnum chocolate and then eat it. Because of the second dip the magnum chocolate was now just setting into a semi hard chocolate state and as you bite through this you hit the crunchy biscuit pieces, then the caramel and vanilla icecream.  It was over the top and made you feel a little sick by the time you finished but I would love to have one of those just once more.  I also made myself sick on the vienetta line about 4 times.

Ameristralia,1gappm,lextori,3,Thu Jun 13 21:54:27 2013 UTC,"Serious talk here, my fellow matriots.   Whilst the fair treatment of both genders and all of their sexual orientations is a definite moral imperative, there are clear reasons why militaries want to 'modernise' themselves in these ways.  Be under no illusions, my brothers and sisters; they want a more effective fighting force to wage the wars of the future.  A future that must control ever more limited resources and provide 'security' for the interests that wish to exploit them.  These dinosaur elements (i.e. bigots, misogynists, sexual-harrassers, rapists, etc.) are limiting the potential combat effectiveness of our fighting forces by excluding entire segments of the population.  Demographics that would be entirely combat effective with the right nurture.  The question remains, as it ever has: Why and Should we use our military forces in any given case.  Again, of course we should pursue such social reforms with the greatest determination and vigor.  These should happen anyway and certainly not be limited to our armed forces.  But like the technological advancements of the past -- e.g. the helicopter, which made war 'safer', by saving more lives of our soldiers wounded in action -- this does not avoid the underlying moral questions which face us.  Remember, we're all in it together.  Humanity has got to learn how to moderate itself, in all things, if we're gonna make it."

Of course these are ripped from the ADF Pay scales and you pay can be effected by heaps of things, all outlined in the document. There are allowances for everything, field pay, deployment and anything in between. Plus you can get paid more if you hold advanced qualifications, or know second languages etc.  There's also another publically viewable document, which has all the Pay  and Conditions for ADF members, called PACMAN!.

Ameristralia,1g8kfc,CasualClone,4,Thu Jun 13 09:09:55 2013 UTC,I know some people that came from the UK and they droped one rank. You drop one rank until the equipment specific training is complete then get it back. (usually). Pay is about 60K a year for an Able Seaman (E3) For a Senior Sailor (I think E7) pay is around 80K. When you go to sea there is an instant pay increase of 10K a year for 0-3 yrs at sea about 15k for 3-6 and 20k for 6-9.

Pints of bells Oberon are 4.50-5 dollars at every bar in town. In Florida I do a lot of 2-4-1 drinks at about 5.50 an order so rounds would be very easy down there.
