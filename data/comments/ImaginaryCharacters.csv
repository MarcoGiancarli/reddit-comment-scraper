ImaginaryCharacters,3d6g3v,themcybermen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:23:18 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Thank you for the kind words it really means a lot to me! :) Hmm honestly it just takes a lot of time,dedication and hard work. When I first started I literally dropped everything to work on my art and improve. I stopped playing video games, I didn't do a lot of homework (but still tried to maintain  a decent grade to satisfy the parents) and I minimized hangouts with friends in order to improve. I found myself painting 7+ hours everyday after school for about 2 years now. I think it's been about 2 years and a half since I started taking art seriously. Now that I am at a decent level I am having fun experimenting with different styles and working towards that professional portfolio while constantly learning and exploring all aspects of art. There are tons of research out there to help you progress and move forward. It just takes a lot of will power and dedication to find and make use of it. It is very tough, but in the end when you get to see your progression and see how much you improved it makes it all worth it. You have the rest of your life to catch up on the things you missed. The energy and amount of effort you put in the beginning of your art journey is probably the most important. Afterwards it's just constantly applying what you've learned and continuing to learn new things in order to better your art and ideas.   Anyway I hope this helped! Happy drawing :D"

The only thing that keeps them going is the sheer necessity that they do. They avoid confrontation at all costs with anything foreign, often making mistakes. Their journey isn't whimsical, it's almost tragic.   Idk, that's not exactly what's going on in the art, just made me think. Lovely pic btw"

ImaginaryCharacters,3bwdwt,Nika00,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"The Raven Knight, Lord Gwynn of the County of Briarsdale was in fact Lady Gwyndolyn of Briarsdale. Her brother had died quietly three winters past and with a heart of iron and blood of fire, Lady Gwyndolyn, who had never been of noble bearing or of a woman's posture, took up his identity and armor, even altering her features to match her twin brother's and impersonating him without the steel, cutting her hair short, deepening her voice until it happened on instinct, and even wearing cuts or bruises to given herself a rougher look in person.  Since the impersonation, Gwyndolyn had many close calls and dire strains and stresses where she was nearly exposed. The Lady Hapshire courted her with an aggressiveness that rivaled her own towards matters of combat...even after discovering her secret. But her heart belonged to The Oberynth Lord, Sir Hale the Onyx Knight whom she married in secret and who swore himself to her and her secret, saying that he would rather fight by her side than have a woman live under his protection.  Now he was held hostage, perhaps fighting for his live in the Mireshall, where the Grand Duke held his council, by an elite contingent of dreaded Lune Knights of the Southern Lands. Battle-crazed and hardened warriors, they only lived for their bloodthirsty gods. Gwyndolyn had fought hard for everything in her life, she had to claw and bite her way to a position that was simply handed to most men of her station. She was not going to give her husband up to lunatics for their heathen deities. Gripped by indecision about the hostages during a siege, the command was bickering amongst themselves. Unwilling to wait, Gwyndolyn stepped forward, knights and men at arms watching her, waiting, tensely ready for action against these Southern Men. She raised a spear and pointed the other at the Mireshall.  She took a deep breath and cried out with all of her being. ""SAVE THE DUKE!""  Inside, she whispered, Save the Oberynth Lord."

He swallowed firmly before regaining his posture. It seemed the Crab were willing to go the full measure in this conflict, if it continued.

ImaginaryCharacters,3bkv66,FumbledAgain,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:25:30 2015 UTC,"Beautiful image.  I know it's completely unrelated, but this reminds me of Little Fuzzy by H. Beam Piper, an excellent book that's now public domain, and thus, freely available.  The relation to this image is a] the small, fuzzy creature, and the glowing gem-like object in the pool, reminding me of the sunstones in the stories.  (Little Fuzzy is part of a series of books.)"
ImaginaryCharacters,3bj5lm,Torvusil,18,Mon Jun 29 17:33:30 2015 UTC,does this remind anyone of Theoden and Grima Wormtongue?
ImaginaryCharacters,3bj5lm,MithrandirTheIstari,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:47:51 2015 UTC,"Just Grima, but I can see the resemblance to Theoden now."

ImaginaryCharacters,3bhyuj,razerxs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:12:45 2015 UTC,Looks like some Pathfinder artwork. It has the iconic characters from the game.
ImaginaryCharacters,3bhyuj,BisonST,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:57:07 2015 UTC,Yes actually its from the new Occult Classes book coming out in a few weeks I believe.
ImaginaryCharacters,3bhyuj,whodoyouVoodoo,0,Mon Jun 29 19:54:10 2015 UTC,Looked to me like some of the characters were coming uncomfortably close to infringing white wold content. Actually came here to see if it was from exalted 3rd edition!
ImaginaryCharacters,3bh2jz,qizzer,11,Mon Jun 29 04:02:10 2015 UTC,Cool drawing! They look more like Ratmen to me though.
