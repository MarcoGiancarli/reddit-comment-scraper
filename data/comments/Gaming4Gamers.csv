Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,MBArceus,43,Mon Jul 20 17:57:23 2015 UTC,I just don't understand how anyone could be attached to a job like that enough to not quit... Literally any other retail job would be better and pay you for all your hours.  Also roger that
Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,stewmberto,20,Mon Jul 20 19:27:11 2015 UTC,This is a no skill/teenager/college student job. It's work at a store that sells the hobby you love... or work at McDonalds. I'd be willing to take a lot of abuse to avoid working at McDonalds.
Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,TheTaoOfBill,5,Mon Jul 20 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"I'd also really like a comparison piece on EB Canada or Gamestop in the USA. I'm not sure how closely connected they are with the Australian branch (or if its more like a Target situation) and if so if it's anywhere near as bad over here.   I'm just kind of shocked by this article, with that many eyewitness accounts and the guy's name you'd think someone would have been able to do something about him. So fucked up."
Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,rookie-mistake,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:43 2015 UTC,"My advice is to not compare the two.  The Gamestops here are atrocious and have very bad business practices that come from their corporate office.  I'm sure EB Canada may have some bad deals but without looking into Canada for the ones that it affects, it's really hard to see what the big differences are."
Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,Inuma,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:34 2015 UTC,"...and that's how EBGames can get away with how poorly they treat their workforce.  McDonalds is a Fortune 500 company with tens of thousands of employees with billions of dollars in revenue. They have executives that started work as summer students and worked their way up. Many people retire, happy, as assistant managers of managers of their stores. They have continuing education programs, management training, they're masters of supply chain management, and have one of the most robust business models in the world.   I'm not sure what you'd learn at Gamestop, aside from how to bilk customers from their trade ins and sell them extra warranties. And you get to watch the same corporate promo demos in store 24/7."
Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,dbcanuck,25,Tue Jul 21 14:38:25 2015 UTC,"... Wut?  McDonalds is a franchise.  It houses a mere 90000 employees while maintaining the idea that each franchise is owned by an independent franchisor and they have no say in how those managers give raises or anything else.  According to Mother Jones, that's 750,000 employees that aren't getting a raise to the recent Fight for $15.  In regards to Gamestop, their business keeps a very centered Board of Directors which ultimately decides who gets promoted and how raises are allocated, etc.  This brings about the incentives of a Gamestop to always extract money from employees for maximized profit.  Credit cards with high interest rates, low wages for employees, managers that are always incentivized to high imaginary sales quotas that you don't see from the CEOs...  Those are but a few examples of how management can make life worse for their workers as well as consumers by proxy.  McDonald's really isn't doing anything different.  It's just hiding how the company works under franchisor licenses."
Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,Inuma,10,Tue Jul 21 20:41:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at first I misread the title as ""Inside EA Games"", so the first bit was more understandable when I was imagining someone getting a job in actual game development and putting up with all kinds of shit to stay there. But it's absolutely not news that retail jobs are shitty and many retail managers are assholes. The two people they talked to definitely had especially horrible experiences, but taking frequent verbal abuse from the higher-ups, and getting told to do way more than you're paid for because you're a naive kid who doesn't know better, are absolutely standard in my experience."
Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,sempersapiens,3,Tue Jul 21 06:10:05 2015 UTC,I worked for Eb Games in NZ and can confirm everything in this article is true. We were constantly harassed about selling extended warranties and if we didn't sell enough our store would be punished with fewer hours. Two of us also had to complain about our assistant manager who was sexually harassing one of the female employees. Nothing ever came of it. Guy literally drew a cock on a drink cup to identify it as his then asked our colleague if she thinks his cock looks like that. I quit shortly after that. It was once a fun job.

I had like 4 separate mangers who all wanted different things so no mater what I did, at the end of the week I would be in trouble for something, either from the store manager, assistant manager, regional manager, or a letter from corporate.   Eventually they said I would be fired unless I sold more of the ""power up scam cards"" and what not, to witch I gave my two weeks notice.

I constantly got conflicting information from my managers (and corporate), and when I couldn't complete everything I'd get in trouble. All of my defenses and explainations were met with ""you knew what you were signing up for. You should manage your time better."" And the push for pre-orders and magazine subscriptions was awful. I felt like a freakin' bully trying to get people to buy them.  When I finally put in my two weeks they just didn't schedule me again."

Whether you've got retail experience, or maybe you're just a teenager looking for some extra cash during the summer or school year, why not take a job that involves something you're really passionate about?

To begin with I was working a tiny number of on-the-book hours, and a vast number of off-the-book hours, probably illegal. I understood it to be the dedication that was required to get the job.  Eventually I did get more on-the-book, contracted and paid hours. At busy times the manager would ask me to work extra hours, and at first I'd ask about marking it on my time card. He just said to ""not worry"" about it. Because I trusted him, I didn't worry. Then I noticed that I got paid only for my contracted hours. I confronted him about this, and he denied all knowledge of me having worked extra.  I got a lot less eager after that."
Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,Soluzar,3,Tue Jul 21 12:02:52 2015 UTC,"The way that article was written is atrocious. I got about 1/2 way through. For one thing, the way it just drops rape in without actually describing what happened is extremely disingenuous. Was it actually rape? Why isn't that the focal point of the discussion then? I would think being raped would be a little bit worse than working at EB and being pushed to volunteer hours just a little bit.  Also.. ""dream job.. becomes a nightmare"" is the most trite, detached way the author could describe it. In the first four paragraphs the term dream job is dropped five times. No one on earth truly thinks of retail as a 'dream job'... so once again we have the author overriding reality with their own subtext.  Fucking gawker media. Great topic of discussion flushed down the toilet by poor writing and editorializing."
Gaming4Gamers,3dyzgt,papersailboat,13,Tue Jul 21 13:39:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think they should have even mentioned the alleged rape, honestly. It has pretty much nothing to do with anything, unless you're trying to imply that if you work at EB you might get raped, which is a ridiculous claim.  I guess their point was ""management did nothing about her rape claim,"" but she waited two months to tell the company and it was indeed her word vs. his. There's no outrage to be had here, if she wanted justice she should have gone to the police soon after the incident."

In this case, its an opinion piece which I'd argue is no better than a random /r/games post from a first person perspective.  They're part of Gawker media, which is bottom of the cesspool level filth and ethics. They deliberately attempt to stir up controversy; they've consciously stated they don't subscribe to recommended journalistic standards (e.g. SPJ's) as they don't apply to new media. Personally, I prefer to consume my content from sources that offer subjects an opportunity to respond; where 2 separate sources of independently verified fact are the standard for publishing; and where the articles are written in a neutral voice (including headlines)."

If it's anything like Fallout's Tale of Two Wastelands, you'll need the esp/esm files of each game to use the content, as it's against the EULA/illegal to rip the content from those games and use them solo."
Gaming4Gamers,3dwqdy,linkinkampf19,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:12 2015 UTC,Great answer!  And the way we are doing it is when you install the mod it will run a check for any installed copys of Morrowind. If it cannot find any you will be asked to locate the EXE of your morrowind install. We do it this way (rather than ripping from ESP/ESMs) because we have replaced almost every asset in morrowind.

I've always thought that those kind of demos where the developers are choosing to show their game at the full potential were kind of cool, as long as the same thing would be theoretically achievable by a player's hands. Showing the atmosphere a game could have if played as intended is something I like to see, rather than a more realistic portrayal of the game being abused by some public lobby.

They are a business, so there is obviously a disconnect between what sounds real or not, I'm not defending that. But at the same time, these are new games, and there aren't any communities formed around them yet. Like, I'm sure I could make a pretty good 'real comms' trailer for BF4 at this point (or maybe hardline), but the players wouldn't have gone through the motions enough to be able to play as fluidly. Or maybe not. But I'd imagine that there would be some logistics issues with having players do the same thing when they don't have very much experience playing the game."

And as you say, they want the absolute most, which means perfection. They don't want a stutter, they want the perfect level and quality of mic distortion, they want voices that sound nice, and they want to tell a very precise story with a particular sequence of event that shows off all the features that they're trying to sell. The end result is something that lacks soul, but we know that humanity isn't a value that modern game corporations consider these days, unless they can quantify it and add it as a bullet point to the back of the box.      8 Classes 3 Specialisations Hundreds of weapons Genuine emotions A novel upgrade system"

Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Throwaway_4_opinions,77,Sun Jul 19 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"Spore. The earliest I saw of Spore was a half-hour tech demo at GDC back in 05, that showed off the tech of the creature creator and the gameplay, with Will Wright creating the Willosaur. Just prior to release, I'd heard of the art style change, and wasn't too fussed, but when the game itself came out, it was as though it were for children. The art I could get past, but the gameplay was such a watered down version of what had been shown. It felt like the first four stages were a rushed checklist of things to do to get to the space stage, which itself was huge but repetitive as all hell."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,WhapXI,16,Sun Jul 19 19:20:01 2015 UTC,I watched the same demo and thought that it would be such a fun game to play again and again and see how the decisions early in the game affected later on. But in the end it was just a series of minigames barely connected and not that fun. Seriously let down as I was super-hyped about that game
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,thepencilsnapper,13,Sun Jul 19 21:43:57 2015 UTC,Fans are doing a realistic game that aims to be the original Spore before the googly eyes. Can't remember what it was called though...
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,aprofondir,9,Sun Jul 19 22:32:04 2015 UTC,It's called Thrive.
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,VeryLargeArray,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:56:45 2015 UTC,No Man's Sky also looks like it's basically the Space Stage of Spore done right.
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,-Sai-,7,Mon Jul 20 04:02:05 2015 UTC,"I am a firm believer that the reason that Spore was such a let-down had nothing to do with Will Wright or Maxis, but rather a heavy-handed managerial approach from EA.  Wright, and Maxis by proxy is one of the greatest creative minds to ever grace the video game world, in my opinion. Maxis pretty much single-handedly put the city builder/simulation genre on the market. SimCity, SimAnt, SimTower, those were amazing games that defined my childhood. Even the flops, such as SimLife and SimIsle (Which I never could figure out how to even play) were able to spark creativity and imagination. It still blows my mind that the Maxis team came up with SimEarth, an entire evolution simulator that could run on hardware from 1990.  The problem is that Maxis also developed what is arguably EA's most successful franchise: The Sims. Rather than give Wright total creative control to create his opus, they wanted something that was first and foremost profitable, which also leans toward approachability. Making something that the casual gamer, as well as children, can pick up and enjoy meant throwing out 90% of Wright's original vision.  I have not seen it and a quick google search didn't pull anything up, but I'd heard that Wright did an interview about Spore after it was released and he just seemed forlorn and defeated. It didn't surprise me that Wright left Maxis a year after Spore to start Stupid Fun Stuff. It was also equally unsurprising, but incredibly heartbreaking to hear that Maxis was disbanded last year after the SimCity debacle.  In short, don't blame Will Wright for the undelivered promises. I am quite sure that he would have kept Spore in development for as long as possible to give his dream a reality. Blame the execs who demanded a release of a half-finished product that they could shell out under the name of one of the most respected game studios for over 20 years."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Zilvreen,6,Mon Jul 20 06:03:07 2015 UTC,"That's the story with a LOT of early companies and even now, you see it with the hope for indies and developers going the crowdsourcing route.  The development teams of the 90s that were powerhouses and made great games got crushed by someone looking to make profit over the people that produce great titles.  Bioware, for example, was two doctors that made money to create games.  Well, EA went from a development studio to a publisher.  That means they made games to make money.  You can only do that so long before you have revolts.  The signs were there for people to realize that the publishers were not always going to be on the developer's side.  The innovation that developers need is not something you can put a financial cost to.  Sadly, with how the game industry has progressed, you have to rely on making more with less and the studios that these people helped create are getting the less informed and untrained workers to do the same work.  It's really unsustainable."

Beta rolls around, and it's the same area. Figured alright, still just testing out the servers and what not.   Real game comes around, story was flat, single player was flat and it was an all around meh game. Gunplay was awesome, which meant the multiplayer was solid. But when there's only so many maps and game types, there's only so much you can do.   The only reason I kept playing was because my friends would all get together each night and game, which is normally hard to do when we're an hour to 2 hours apart.

Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,SnoFenix,9,Mon Jul 20 05:26:54 2015 UTC,"Aliens: Colonial Marines.  I'm a huge Aliens fan and remember reading about this game in a gaming book geeze, back in like 2010.  There was some concept art and a few preliminary screenshots and I was so excited.  Then it went through developmental stages of Hell.   When it finally did come out I really wanted to love it.   I remember trying to justify it but it was just...so...bad.  I think what was so disappointing is not that it was just a terrible game but that everything needed to make a great game was there and Gearbox just failed miserably.   Isolation somewhat made up for it but I really wanted a great run-n-game Aliens game that captured the nuance of the second film."

The single player was decent, but definitely below standards. It could be criticized for being short, gimmicky, and frankly forgettable. But, oh my lord, that multiplayer. The world missed out."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Emberwake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:17:41 2015 UTC,Do you think some of it ended up in Overwatch?
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,JeddHampton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:42 2015 UTC,"No, completely different games. Ghost's multiplayer was a console 4v4 shooter, but it was the respawn/point system with the variety of SC units that made it awesome. Everytime you got a kill, you got a point. When you respawned, you chose what unit you would spawn as.  For example, the Zerg could spawn as a zergling for 0 points, a hydralisk for 1, an infested terran for 2, or a mutalisk for 5. Zerglings moved and attacked faster the more of them were together. Hydras were mobile and shooty. Infested Terrans were slow and tough, but they could shoot and self destruct. Mutalisks could fly, shoot, and even grab enemies off the battlefield.  It was amazing. The last build I played had the Terran and Zerg complete in multiplayer, and I saw a later version with a Protoss Zealot unit."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Emberwake,28,Mon Jul 20 14:29:24 2015 UTC,"That does sound great.  I was following loosely, and I was excited for it.  I remember even seeing promotional material in the local mall.  Then, it got canned."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,JeddHampton,7,Mon Jul 20 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"Dead Island is classic example of this. The game's first trailer had just about everyone super hyped and hoping this would be more than just a zombie game, focusing on some of the more dramatic elements of a zombie apocalypse and stressing survival, hard decisions and general doom and gloom.  Instead we got melee-focused zombie Borderlands and every attempt to elicit some kind of emotional response fell flat or felt tacked on to whatever quest you'd just taken. And more importantly you never felt like you were in any kind of serious danger, nor was there any ""survival"" element. As a game and ignoring anything pre-release it was OK - but Dying Light which came out just this year improved on all the good aspects of Dead Island and removed all the bad ones IMO.  I noticed they decided to go more towards a ""silly"" approach similar to how Saints Row did to differentiate itself from GTA but now Dead Island 2 is basically dead in the water and every other spinoff game has been... not good."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Azba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:27 2015 UTC,This one always bothered me. OMG this trailer is soooo good!

It was billed as Diablo II meets FPS, but to me it ended up being too repetitive without enough substance, and the writing and character were too juvenile for my tastes.  edit: By juvenile, I didn't mean I was looking for something high brow, just wasn't in the mood for a game aimed at the teenage demographic."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Suppa_K,17,Mon Jul 20 04:27:47 2015 UTC,I hated Borderlands. The gunplay wasn't bad though but everything else turned me off and it got very repetitive.
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,markherrington5,5,Sun Jul 19 19:54:57 2015 UTC,Bullet sponge enemies ruined the game for me.  That and the super unimaginative quest system that had the player running back and forth a lot.

Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,SnoFenix,3,Mon Jul 20 00:13:27 2015 UTC,"If someone tells you that Borderlands 2 is better. It is. Somewhat.    Generally speaking, the story is good, the writing is... decent, i guess, and the gunplay is slightly different, but not much. Overall though it is fun, I have sunken about 200 hours into BL2, but it does get boring when you finish the story. And possibly even before then."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Kheron,8,Mon Jul 20 01:01:52 2015 UTC,"I agree on the repetitiveness, though I don't find the writing juvenile. There's some immature jokes, sure, but that's just a little harsh, and I don't need some high brow shit in my video games."

I played it when it came out and it just felt so generic and it just didn't hold my interest. Another game was Watch_Dogs, I mean I still enjoyed it but it also didn't feel like it lived up to the hype. Also Fable 3, I loved the first two games but 3 I was disappointed in."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Link_In_Pajamas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:58:15 2015 UTC,"H1Z1 for me.   The game looked great in the development stage and the devs regularly got on Twitch and streamed them selves making various parts of the game while also doing Q&A. They also hopped on the subreddit and chatted with the fans and took in suggestions, heck I remember once on stream someone suggested making barbed wire for home defense and by the end of the stream a dev had an early version up and running. It was really cool and everything seemed pretty open.  Then it hit early access for 20$ to enter the Alpha. I know its still not out but it is such a rough game to play. The sheer amount of cheaters is ridiculous and the ""Ban"" system is so bad. I remember playing 1 day and seeing the same person get ""Banned"" 3 times in the global chat message.  People no clip into your base, fly over your base and come right on in. Shoot your doors off with 1 bullet. Everyone uses ESP and sees you coming miles away, half the servers players run like they are the Flash. Your guns, ammo , food and vehicles get stolen on a daily basis. It's been in EA for like 6 months now and I played it for atleast 2 months on and off up until a month ago before I dropped it entirely. The devs are getting dumpstered so hard by the cheaters its ridiculous.  The game is optimized pretty poorly as well. When I played it was extremely easy to farm up hundreds of an item called Ethanol. As you can guess its fuel but it can also be used as an item to raid bases as it explodes and then leaves behind fire that does damage to base walls and doors. Well Fire is optimized to a state of hammered dog shit. Long story short cheaters and griefers set your base on fire with an extreme amount of ethanol and ethanol torches and the surrounding area around your base becomes one of the laggiest locked up messes you will ever see in any game. Have fun putting out the fire in that slide show.  So what do the devs do? Optimize the fire a bit? Nah. Lets introduce molotovs whats the worst that could happen.  This game could have been so cool. The base building and defense options were really nice and the idea that you could one day build your own ""Woodbury"" like in TWD was a really cool concept they just completely forgot to deal with the cheaters in any real significant way."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,dannaz423,2,Sun Jul 19 19:37:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't read all your comment because it's huge, but H1Z1 is still in early access right? So I'm sure it can change. I'm not against judging early access titles, but ruling them out before they are finished is a bit rough."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Link_In_Pajamas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:12:53 2015 UTC,Yup its in Early Access.   I was on the fence about even posting that because of the fact that it's in EA. How ever the experience in the game left such a bad taste in my mouth I decided to just post anyway.  The game can be fun but I feel like the devs don't have their priorities straight when it comes to dealing with optimization and the fact that a majority of the game population are cheating in some form or another.
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,YetAnotherRCG,6,Mon Jul 20 02:55:05 2015 UTC,The problem with that entire genra is it requires you to care in order to be fun. Which means that hackers can get a huge rise out of the people they screw. Thus they go further to hack this type of game.

Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,Kheron,11,Mon Jul 20 10:59:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, I LOVED Hellgate: London, and was sad when it shut down. Especially because I'd just started to get to a good place in the game and started soloing Stonehenge, didn't get too far in.

They signed a contract with the developer, XL Games, and gave them waaay too much freedom to dictate the direction of the NA release. If Trion want to make a change, they have to submit it to XL Games, wait, and then implement it if they get approval.  Sounds like a nightmare, especially since it ruined Trion's reputation in the process. AA was definitely, definitely a disappointment, but I'd be hesitant to put it all on Trion's shoulders since all of their other games have pretty ethical cash shops."

Everything was in place, but there was no consideration to how they fit together,  and worse, how fun any of the elements were.

You spend a lot of time just walking with your shield up, being cautious and cheesing your enemies one by one around the corner to kill them safely.  Bloodborne on the other hand is a lot more offensive, you don't have a shield anymore and you're a lot more agile. I also like the Victorian setting a lot more. It's still very similar to dark souls, but the more offensive play style makes it a lot better for me."

RTS combat across multiple spherical planet maps is pretty good, but the planets as a general rule lack the strategic depth of a traditionally crafted map, and the ""space combat"" is still kinda tacked on and basically about who blobs more. add to that the fact that all the teams use the same units as opposed to their own factions, and you kinda realize that all the little concessions that Uber had to make for such an ambitious project just kinda killed it."
Gaming4Gamers,3dut7a,igncom1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"Well the same units thing was supposed to be apart of a wider roster of units, considering the lore of the commanders all being the same and otherwise stealing each others stuff.  Multiple factions wouldn't make sense unless they were fighting something actually different from themselves.  Basically the game really lacks the foundation for why the hell they are even fighting in the first place. TA's conflict was a battle between forcibly uploading people or retaining their body's, and so galactic destruction. Supcom was a very human war between terrorists, fascists and zealots, so has roots in all of human history.  PA? Well....they all have brain damage, and are psychotically fighting and brainwashing each other, crapping their pants about the return of humanity who ended the previous war.

The story (as far as I got anyway) was good, the grasp of Lovecraftian tropes was dead on, and the idea of the inventory system looked brilliant. But the execution was just tragic to the point they had an option in the game to skip through it like DVD chapters without unlocking them by beating them first, which sounds like a pretty screaming acknowledgment that parts of your game are, for one reason or another, totally unplayable. A little better optimization to fix the broken tech bits (I managed to drive too fast through one part and it failed to create the world under me, I spent about 20 minutes thinking I was trying to do it wrong until I figured out I had to drive just fast enough to beat the impending death, but slow enough to let the game load things) and some improved gameplay like make the world slow down when you go into your little jacket inventory (which was a great sounding idea, but felt very rough in execution)."

Gaming4Gamers,3dt6wn,piggybankcowboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"To clarify, that game is not what the (Western) simulator community is into. We want realistically modeled interiors (and exteriors for that matter). The sounds have to be exactly the same as the real train. There needs to be all kinds of different camera angles and whatnot. The UI needs to be uncluttered. That game doesn't seem fit those criteria."

Gaming4Gamers,3dt3n1,davidpatonred,6,Sun Jul 19 14:52:33 2015 UTC,Definitely try our Grid 2 and Grid autosport. It had local multilayer too so everyone can join in if you use controllers or wheels :)
Gaming4Gamers,3dt3n1,ElectronicWar,7,Sun Jul 19 05:12:51 2015 UTC,I would only recommend the original Grid as well as Grid Autosports. Grid 2 was just... meh. Especially the really extreme rubber band AI was so annoying.
Gaming4Gamers,3dt3n1,Caveat53,3,Sun Jul 19 07:46:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can skip Grid 2. Grid Autosport is the best in the series IMO.

Gaming4Gamers,3dt3n1,davidpatonred,2,Sun Jul 19 11:00:08 2015 UTC,I guess so. I mean it was pretty arcadey too. Which is what OP was goin for. Goes on sale for 15 bucks complete sometimes. Good deal i rekcon!

If you want an arcade racer you can check out:   Grid series that others pointed out, the first or Autosports are the most recommended ones.   Need for Speed series, there's quite a few of them that were released in the last few years.  Dirt series from the same studio as Grid.As the name suggest it's primarily Rally racing, but there is a few street events in the more recent titles. I believe the new Dirt Rally is in early access and is getting great reviews.  The Burnout series is also a pretty good one, sadly the last one to come out was Paradise, which is a few years old but still great fun. I'm not sure if Burnout is still in Steam since Origin came out.   That's all I can think of off the top of my head."

If you're looking for Arcade racers, steer clear of Project Cars. That one plays well after tweaks, but it's a full on sim.  If you're not averse to EA and Origin, almost all of the modern N4S games are great fun. Especially Most Wanted, followed by Hot Pursuit and then Rivals. The Shift games are fun, but they're also sims (They were the spiritual predecessors to Project Cars)"

Pretty interesting as it completely changes the game (given that you have 24 hours you heavily optimize your moves and think a lot about your next moves and strategy). Overall the rounds took usually around 6-12 month which in turn again changes on how you play the game. You risk way less and there is a lot more diplomacy and backstabbing involved.

It is both a cut throat last man standing game at the end and a top-notch cooperative community organization game. Premise is that you and 39 others are surviving the zombie apocalypse in a makeshift fortress that you must improve daily by scavenging for supplies in the surrounding desert and returning them to town to be built into defensive and utility buildings. The zombies attack at night and if you don't have the defense required they get in and kill some people. Goals are to last as long as possible but also to be the last man standing at all costs. Days in it are real time and while timing when you are on matters you don't need to babysit the game.

But I'm also a huge fan of modded skyblock, particularly Agrarian Skies just from how much it changes Minecraft. Suddenly there's no infinitely generating terrain to rely on, but the automation scales well with game progression.  I definitely agree that mods have squashed the MC competition in many ways. Which is good because it prevents relatively low-effort clones from flooding the market, imo."
Gaming4Gamers,3dotdt,wugs,21,Sun Jul 19 09:05:18 2015 UTC,"This is just a personal opinion, so some will likely disagree, BUT...  I kind of feel like it's similar to how new MMOs struggle to compete with a 10 year-old WoW.  Blizzard has the benefit of 10 years of polish, bug fixes, balancing, new content, etc., where a lot of newer MMOs don't.  Minecraft has been getting steady updates for years, so while many games might come out with new takes on the block-building idea, Minecraft just has lots of depth and polish that's hard to overcome."
Gaming4Gamers,3dotdt,Citizen_Gamer,10,Sat Jul 18 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"I also think that because of the large playerbase, they're really the only people who would be interested in a minecraft clone/minecraft-esque game, but since they've been so used to minecraft, why would they move to a newer, possibly worse game that they aren't familiar with? Or why would they play a game that obviously doesn't do it as good as minecraft and like you said, has so much in terms of updates and stuff like that. Coming from a 4 year player, if that matters any."
Gaming4Gamers,3dotdt,treeman798,8,Sat Jul 18 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"I would doubt that. If there is one game that doesn't have a lot of polish and depth, then it's minecraft. The fact that the one most popular mods for the game is a pure performance booster (optifine) says enough for the polish. The amount of content in the game is actually quite miserable too. Of course, they have a very small team, but with the amount of money they got from sales they could've hired at a couple of extra developers to, for example, improve the rendering engine."

Gaming4Gamers,3dotdt,another_programmer,13,Sat Jul 18 13:24:40 2015 UTC,If you don't like the building aspects of Minecraft so much then definitely try Terraria. For adventuring and combat it makes Minecraft look 1000 times worse. The worlds are much more detailed and there are hundreds of different mobs and a lot of bosses.

Joe Price on YT has some stuff but there's way more. Lego Worlds will likely be the only good 3D alternative to Minecraft, but that will take years unless they're planning it from the start."
Gaming4Gamers,3dotdt,Kraelan,7,Sat Jul 18 18:49:21 2015 UTC,"I've been playing the launch version of Trove recently, and in my opinion I think that'll be the game to get close to what Minecraft does. It still has a ways to go as far as development to put it on an even plane with Minecraft, but people are already doing some crazy things with their club (guild) worlds.  Like this guy, who translated the entirety of ""Through the Fire and Flames"" into the game's music system. And this is just his little section of the world.  There was another club world that built themselves an entire city, complete with recreations of Pallet Town from Pokemon, Green Hill Zone from Sonic (a basic version), and a Gundam just because.  If you haven't checked it out, I highly recommend it. And the F2P model seems very fair to me, since the only things behind a pay wall are cosmetics and fun mounts. Classes can be bought, too, but they're also mostly for fun and really easy to earn. It also helps that all the weapons, armor, and (most) dungeons in the game are made by the community.  Here are some screenshots I took if you're interested: http://imgur.com/a/PlcHL"
Gaming4Gamers,3dotdt,outbound_flight,3,Sat Jul 18 06:08:13 2015 UTC,"In perhaps a weird way, I don't consider Trove and Minecraft in the same genres or even comparable. I guess because one is full-on MMO, while the other really is a builder, with mobs and optional survival play.  It's probably due to why I decided to try Trove (and I'm enjoying it so far): because it's an MMO. I haven't even attempted to remodel my starting house since I've been learning about and exploring the traditional MMO gameplay first."

Anyone else watch the yogscast playthroughs of Tekkit, back before they got a bit bloated with their ""Storylines""?  They were Dirt Farming Peasants compared to some of the stuff i built.  Then... i discovered factorio.  Remove all the crappy aspects of survival Minecraft, and distill it down to the factory building. I must have at least 400 hours in Factorio, and its an alpha.   But... really, i didnt enjoy Survival Minecraft all that much. It was the Factory mods that made me play Minecraft at all. I just had other games to play if i wanted to do things like survive in Minecraft.  I never had the creativity to build structures. So, its where the mechanics came in that made me interested. And...

If you have the top loading PS3 there is a gamebreaking bug with certain disk copies of God of War 3 that will stop you from playing past more than the first half hour and there are no fixes, at least not that I've found. If anyone has heard of this bug and knows how to fix it please let me know, I really want to play God of War 3 but the audio cuts out and cutscenes freeze up the console causing me to hard reset the whole thing."

One to add: Armored Core V or it's verdict day spinoff. Theyre probably dead / unsupported but  still worth playing it's a very math / customization / strategy / preperation based mech sim.

But I assume it's great as well.  Also yeah honestly I don't how you got yourself to get into consoles, but good for you! I have a ps3 and a bunch of games that I've had since before building a ""gaming worthy"" PC, especially now that I have a high end machine I just can't get myself to really play it anymore. I really only ever turn it on at all for Guitar Hero, which even that's not too often anymore.  Oh yeah, I recommend Guitar Hero as well, if you haven't played that. If you can find a guitar controller for a decent price (the GH5 one is the best(this one)). One of the best reasons to own a console imo.

Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,Bearowolf,22,Thu Jul 16 17:05:17 2015 UTC,"The DS4 is arguably the best controller for PC right now. There are a couple different programs that allow you to change damn near anything about the controller. For ex: color of the light bar, individual button mappings per game/profile, dead zones, using the touch pad as a mouse, and lots of other things.  I've been using DS4 Tool, and the only issue I've had is it not registering when I have it plugged in before I run the software. To remedy this I just unplug it and plug it back in without ever closing the software."
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,nohpex,3,Thu Jul 16 17:41:16 2015 UTC,+1 for DS4 Tool  Been using it for as long as its been available and it has only gotten better with time. My only want is for more games to recognize the DS4 and show the appropriate button prompts.

Since switching to the scp driver package it has been awesome, it's just plug it in or push the ps button, no need to open an interface at all even if you need to pair it initially. Setting up the Bluetooth dongle is a bit confusing but there is a really good video on YouTube that explains it perfectly.   Motioninjoy is complete garbage."

Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,nohpex,7,Fri Jul 17 17:05:26 2015 UTC,I love it and have already convinced one of my other PC gamer friends to use a DS4 as well. Though I have a PS4 and extra controllers are always good to have around.  DS4Windows works great and will get you working easily.   If you do not plan on EVER buying a PS4 just get an old wired x360 controller it'll be cheaper and is pretty comfortable.
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,Another_Mid-Boss,2,Fri Jul 17 17:07:26 2015 UTC,"It's great. It's not as comfortable as the 360 controller, but the build quality is much higher all around. The d-pad is excellent and makes 2D games much more enjoyable and the sticks are more sturdy and precise.  I use it for every game except Dark Souls, because the claw is very uncomfortable with the dual shock 4.  You should know that the touchpad is not accurate enough to do anything with, really. I thought I could use it for DS emulation. No way.  You also will probably want a Bluetooth adapter. There's 4ms of lag over usb. It's not unplayable, in fact, the consistency might be better if you get used to it, but over Bluetooth the limit is smaller than 1ms, if there is one."
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,singe8,3,Fri Jul 17 17:11:56 2015 UTC,It has more lag wired then wirelessly? Stange
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,dougiefresh1233,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"I've not used the DS4, but I do have a Xbox One controller for PC gaming and I love it.  Once you install the official drivers, the controller pretty much works without issue.  From what I've read, the DS4 seems to take a little more tinkering to setup.  Not a huge deal of course, but I like that the X1 and 360 controllers are a bit more 'plug and play'.  One other nice thing is, for games that natively support gamepads, the button prompts are typically Xbox one buttons."
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,so_what_who_cares,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:58:34 2015 UTC,The main reason I use the DS4 over the XB1 controller is that the trackpad on the controller can be used as a Windows track pad.  Great if you're playing from the couch and something happens or if you have a game with no controller support that you forgot to map an action to the key and have to use the mouse.
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,jace100,2,Thu Jul 16 18:00:00 2015 UTC,I've been using my DS4 for the past few months and it's been working great. You can even use the touch pad to move the cursor around.
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,Seedless_cantaloupe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:22:30 2015 UTC,"The official DS4 controller is amazing, super comfortable and basically addresses every single problem I had with the DS3 while also adding even more great bells and whistles (bluetooth connectivity, touch pad, cuatomizable color-changing light). It feels 1000% better than the 360 pad to me, but I haven't tried the XB1 controller.  I use the DS4Windows driver, which is a branch of the Ds4 tool, and I have never had a single game fail to work with it hassle-free since. No messing with button mapping or other weird issues, just plug and play for everything I've tried so far, except when I had to button map for emulators which you'd need to do with almost any coontroller anyway.   The only issue is that the driver works by mostly making your ds4 look like an x360 pad to your system, so games will give you xbox button prompts, but once you learn those that really doesn't matter.  I have used it with n64 and ps2 emulators and had zero problems.  That said, I have not attempted to use the bluetooth wireless functionality because my computer lacks bluetooth."
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,Pseutri,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:41:33 2015 UTC,"As for controller feel, the xbone controller feels pretty much the same as the 360, sans the finger cramping battery pack extrusion and with more sharp edges.   The triggers feel a lot nicer than the 360s though, and the dpad isn't total shit anymore. I still prefer Sony style dpads though."
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,nige111,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:15 2015 UTC,DS3 was also bluetooth.
Gaming4Gamers,3divo9,riomhaire,0,Thu Jul 16 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"I don't have much to add, because everyone already said it.  Anyway, I bought a PS4 controller just to use for my PC, and I love it. It comfortable, and will work with just about any game/emulator either natively, or with 360 controller emulation.  The only issue I have is with the bluetooth. When I use it with bluetooth, it sometimes cuts out for a second or two. That's more likely a problem with my software/adapter, and not the actual controller.   It also uses micro USB instead of mini USB. Micro USB wears out a lot easier than mini, in my experience."
Gaming4Gamers,3dln1c,A_Light_Spark,6,Fri Jul 17 07:16:19 2015 UTC,"I bought this game as soon as it arrived on PC. Deluxe Edition, in fact. I have no regrets supporting D4 and I hope we see a follow up soon."

Edit: Played through the demo, definitely has potential and some things I really liked were how you could play the three characters and switch between them easily.  Also they each had their weaknesses and strengths.    What I didn't like was the momentum it felt like I was on ice at all times, also the scrolling background is alright if you are moving right but really screwy looking if you are moving right.     Somethings I assume are because it is a demo, such as enemies didn't drop anything and the map was slightly confusing, also ran into an invisible wall."

If they just made a Diablo clone with a Warhammer theme that would honestly be enough for me, it's not like there's a lot to live up to in terms of 40k games.  I'm a little disappointed that you're locked into an inquisitor role though. So few of the licensed games for 40k let you play as anything other than human (or Space Marine, which is effectively human from a gameplay standpoint)."

Neocore games feels like a company with poor source control or possibly executives who understand just enough about tech to be bad at executing it.  This is just my personal experiences with their games and assumptions drawn from clues and what those clues have meant when dealing with past game companies.  None of this should be taken as fact.

Space Marines have dominated the WH40K video game world, and even though we're technically staying human, the story that'll be told with an Inquisitor is significantly different than the story to be told with a Space Marine.   Inquisitors present a LOT of potential for some really cool ground-level exploration of the 40K universe. Not giant warzones, but the tight back alleys of a hive world, fighting through mutants to find cults on the tip you got out of bribing a rogue trader. Cool stuff that WH40K games haven't done much."

Your job is to unravel a mysterious chaos cult that's spreading throughout worlds.

Don't skip Gothic 1, its got much better pacing than Gothic 2 and you'll miss out on some amazing moments in Gothic 2 if you skip 1 (returning to the valley of mines has no impact if you never played 1).  Most people would say 2 is better overall but honestly I think the combat overhaul made the game worse.  If you do end up playing 2, a crucial piece of advice: the only way to fight animals as a melee character is to abuse the iframes on your backstep.  3 is okay with the fan patches but its not great, it does however have an incredible soundtrack.  Arcania is shit.  Oh yeah, and the controls in G1 and 2 are really strange.  Mouse support is lousy and its designed to use almost no keys, every action is either 'control' or 'alt' along with a directional button.  Despite how incredibly clunky they are, they've got some of the best level design and atmosphere of any game ever made."

Of course there are also the huge amount of bugs but they never really bothered me and with all these patches i believe the majority was fixed.  Arcania on the other side is a total disaster. Take this statement with a grain of salt though since i never made it past the tutorial island(i believe it was an island?). The lines are corny, your hero is reduced to a generic, snarky ""good looking"" guy that you typically find in bad hollywood movies or series. I understand that this was the tutorial but holy fuck these missions were really boring. After 2 hours i just stopped playing.  Risen 1 was waaaay better compared to that even though it went the same stylistic path that turns away from that typical, grim, dark, brutally honest and witty gothic feeling.  A little bit off topic: As someone who played the original(german) gothic as one of my first rpg i got so sucked in that i still consider it as one of the best rpgs ever made(fuck you witcher). Arcania and Risen tried to ride on that level of success and failed horrible and only continue to drag it down. Risen 3 shows a lot of promise to me but since i only heard about it last week and didnt manage to run it on my laptop im a little skeptical of its quality right now. It looks (from the trailers) as the gothic 3 everyone always wanted."

For major outlets, games with high review scores are ones that they believe will be widely enjoyed.  Game critics would rank games very differently from this list and among one another.

Fo3 has inferior world building, writing, quest design, player freedom, gameplay and atmosphere. I don't care  or mind which game you personally like most, but none in their right mind would think that Fo3 is actually a better game than NV."
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,Cadenas,8,Wed Jul 15 13:46:32 2015 UTC,"I liked the world, charisma and story a whole lot more. Seemed like a realistic situation. The main plot line; purifying the water supply.  I have to be honest I barely played new vegas because that's how much I found it boring. They didn't make me care about my character and the world felt like an actual wasteland. It's a video game not a simulator.   I wanted places to explore and things to do. Every corner I turned in FO3 there was something fun and entertaining to do. In Vegas i just didn't care about anything making me drop the game just a few hours in. The one thing I'll give it is that they had that faction joining thing, it sounds very interesting and since i haven't experienced it yet i already feel overwhelmed by it.  I personally get attached to my characters i make and hate beating the game and starting over as a new character as most people might do.  I'm hopeful to try it out again before FO4 with mods since that might make it better.  This is my opinion, you have your right to your own."

Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,Cadenas,4,Wed Jul 15 15:23:34 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention that specifically, in a sense you are right.  One can have more than another but still be better and the other still lacking."
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,Civil718,2,Wed Jul 15 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"Based on what? That you enjoyed it more?   Should there be any other metric? Its an opinion. I see further down you're trying to say that a game's quality is totally objective, which just isn't true. You're just applying an ""objective"" label to an opinion you have, and are insisting you're right.   New Vegas had some great writing, and some not so great writing. It had areas that were phenomenal, and there were others that felt half-baked and incomplete (looking at you, Freeside). I prefer Fallout 3 because it was a cohesively great experience, as opposed to a good experience with moments of brilliance.  I will say the New Vegas DLCs were some of the best DLCs I've ever played, way better than what came in Fallout 3."
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,Elij17,-2,Wed Jul 15 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"Based on what? That you enjoyed it more?   Should there be any other metric? Its an opinion.   No, it isn't. To like something more than something else is a preference. To believe something is better than something else is an opinion. These are separate things.   You're just applying an ""objective"" label to an opinion you have, and are insisting you're right.   Gosh, I forgot to put ""I believe"" in front of every statement I make.  I know that opinions just like preferences are subjective, but the difference is that we can actually try to look at things as objectively as possible when we form our opinions. I prefer that to stating that since opinions are entirely subjective and don't mean shit, it will forever be pointless to define the quality of something."

He has a preference for Fallout 3. That is quite a fine hair you're splitting.   Gosh, I forgot to put ""I believe"" in front of every statement I make.   No, I realize you're stating your opinion. I take issue with you offering it up as objective fact. Seriously, you listed ""better atmosphere and world-building"" as a fact about New Vegas. That isn't objective. Those things aren't quantifiable. You just liked them more. You could say you have a ""preference"" for them.   I know that opinions just like preferences are subjective, but the difference is that we can actually try to look at things as objectively as possible when we form our opinions. I prefer that to stating that since opinions are entirely subjective and don't mean shit, it will forever be pointless to define the quality of something.   I see you're going all ""Reductio ad absurdum"" on me here, so I'm not even going to bother. There are a bunch of things New Vegas did better, there are a bunch of things Fallout 3 did better.

Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,HireALLTheThings,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:22:43 2015 UTC,There's another link for top 500 games
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,pickelsurprise,3,Wed Jul 15 13:51:43 2015 UTC,"I can understand parts of this list, but it also feels like a rather lazy aggregate. It seems to combine a lot of different criteria into a single list that doesn't really make a lot of sense.  For example, things like Call of Duty are extremely popular and they would reasonably deserve to be on a top list based on popularity or sales. Something like GoldenEye, however, deserves a spot on a top list based more on the influence it had on games that came after it. I personally don't really think it holds up anymore, but it revolutionized the world of multiplayer.  Basically all these games certainly do deserve recognition, but many of them should be recognized for different things. They shouldn't really all be on one overall list, and it's not like putting them all together here is going to introduce anybody to any new games. We all know about all of these already."
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,Catvoca,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"I feel like your analogy here is a little faulty. Call of duty 4 is arguably the most influential game of last generation, not to mention one of its best (both it and Goldeneye have changed multiplayer shooters forever).I think in 20 years it will probably still be in these top 100 lists. I agree with the sentiment though, breaking out the list into different catogaries and subsets would make for a more interesting read."
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,13th_story,6,Wed Jul 15 23:55:52 2015 UTC,"How do we accomplish this? By compiling and interpreting data from 78 relevant ""top game"" lists (from a variety of sources around the web) and outputting the data as a ranked list of games;1-500.   Whelp... there are some flaws with that method that should be pretty obvious. The main one is a lack of consistent standards, imo. It's not worth much at all to just average all rankings from 78 lists when each list probably has a different set of standards for what constitutes ""great"".   All we really have is a reflection of hive mind, lacking any real nuance. That said, it is really interesting to break down the rankings.   That Oblivion is even on the top 100 list is a travesty. Twilight Princess, Final Fantasy 7 and 10 should be lower, Baldur's Gate II, Mega Man 2, Pokemon Gold/Silver, Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy IX, Journey and Donkey Kong Country should be much higher. Beyond Good and Evil (452) should be much, much higher.  Notable games left off the 500 list: Donkey Kong Country 2(!) which is a huge surprise. So is Mega Man X and Sonic The Hedgehog 3."
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,Hibbity5,6,Wed Jul 15 15:43:34 2015 UTC,Super Metroid and Metroid Prime not even being in the top 25 is just pathetic. Skyrim beating out Super Mario Bros is just plain wrong. It's just a bad list. Simple as that.
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,TheRingshifter,4,Wed Jul 15 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like a great list like this is possible... we just need waay better lists to aggregate.   I mean, look at the ""They Shoot Pictures, Don't They"" list for films - that is also and aggregate list... the reason it's so much better is because there are tons of amazing lists of films to pull from (and he cheats a bit by only choosing ""reputable"" ones). But it ends up with a great list."
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,13th_story,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:45 2015 UTC,"Well there is a huge difference between film critics and game critics. Most film critics study film in college. And not just one area, but they'll study how to make film, how to analyze film, film history, and film criticism (I know this because my major in college was in the same college as the film department at my university and they offered all these classes and I even took a few for Fine Arts credits).   Then most major newspapers and media outlets have a place or two on their roster for film critics, not to mention syndication groups that will hire critics of all types.   So working at publications with decades + of history and at least some gravitas, plus studying their area of criticism and how to critique properly leaves film critics very, very educated about their topic.   Game critics on the other hand don't have those opportunities in college because games aren't studied (yet) the way films are. Most major outlets don't review games (yet) the way they review films. So a game critic at IGN probably studied English or computer science, maybe journalism if they even went to college. While a film critic at your big regional newspaper likely studied film criticism. He has studied and picked apart every important film of the past century at the collegiate level. They understand what makes a good film at every level.  This means, of course, that there is a consistent and regular standard for what film critics consider ""well made films"" whereas game critics are still figuring out their industry. They're still in the process of setting standards of what is good. It doesn't help that the quality of gaming has progressed at an amazing speed, so people still remember a game like Ocarina of Time very fondly from their childhood despite the fact that it doesn't hold up the way a movie from the 90s might. And they're not studying that game in any important way outside of maybe their own interest. So someone might remember loving Ocarina of Time more than they ever loved any other game despite not having played it in 20 year or ever really thinking critically about it and put it at the top of their list. A film critic who puts Citizen Kane on the top of their list has studied and analyzed every aspect of that film.  A great list is possible, but I think we need way better game critics. Which will require a process of training better game critics."
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,TheRingshifter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agreed. Only thing I disagree with is...   so people still remember a game like Ocarina of Time very fondly from their childhood despite the fact that it doesn't hold up the way a movie from the 90s might.   I mean, I do think Ocarina of Time is vastly overrated... but that has nothing to do really with the time it was made in - it just has mechanics and decisions that aren't that great IMO. Like, IMO Super Metroid is still one of the best designed games ever made... just like many people will have considered something like ""Intolerance"" or ""The General"" a great film many years after it's release, despite technology moving on."

Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,freelancer799,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:54:26 2015 UTC,Can you honestly give an argument against HL2 though?
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,unkillable94,5,Wed Jul 15 13:58:48 2015 UTC,"It's overhyped and put on a pedestal. The character development is really good, but the gameplay is boring and repetitive. And the boat. The godawful boat. It's fun, but it's hardly one of the best games ever made."
Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,Marsdreamer,3,Wed Jul 15 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"I have little emotional attachment to the characters whatsoever, they don't build realistic human relations within the story arc.   The FPS play is fun and relatively fast paced, but the puzzling aspect boils down to ""We just got a Physics Engine! Lets use it!"" and ""Press this button."" And while the puzzles break up the gunplay a bit, they often seem out of place and exist simply to exist.   The game was (and is) pretty overhyped in general and I think many people suffer from 'nostalgia glasses' when they play it. It only mildly holds up to today's standards and suffers from the limitations of the day causing some somewhat unrealistic environments.   Was it a great game? Absolutely. Was it a landmark title for the time? 100%. Best game of all time? Eh, I don't really think so, but that's just me.   IMO the ""Greatest Game of All Time"" argument is pretty mute anyway. There's so many genres, so many purposes, so many types of games that you're trying to compare apples to oranges to kiwis to bananas. How do you weigh the merits of an incredible story to the gameplay of excellent mechanics? How do you compare mind blowing graphics and character motion capture to well written dialogue, story, or lore?   You can't.  Every game often chooses a specific set of criteria that they will excel at and uses that as their anchor or hook for the playerbase.   A personal example from me would be comparing The Last of Us to Portal. I had significantly more fun playing Portal than TLOU, but I liked TLOU more. In fact I have never had more fun playing any game than the first time I booted up Portal. But TLOU had such a moving, incredible story with such real human relations that built over the plot.   I couldn't possibly say which I consider to be ""better."""

Gaming4Gamers,3dde3z,kentathon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:21:12 2015 UTC,"I think what needs to be focused on is the question of what the defintion of to what defines a top game of all time.  In my opinion the number  factor criteria of all times is the matter of influence. There are some games that fails recognize the value and the influence it has and still will continue to have on not only gamers and gaming culture, but pop culture  and the human experience itself.  Aswell and as always one also have to try to think about the popularity of the time, units sold, fan base following, critical reception and gamers response.  One can say Beatles was a shitty band and disnt like them - but to furthee deny the impact they had not only for the time being but for the many bands that came after is a huge de-valuation.  Most of the internets top 100 lists out there are like the imdb top 250... really great - but... very biased to newer generations and especially high of the mainstream of whats going on at the present moment. Which means a game that may seems popular at the moment. (Ie: Diablo 3) comes of as a top game but will fail to stand on the shelf at a longer period in comparison to other big titles.  Although Skyrim is a fun game and worthy its recognition, its in my opinion not a top 10 game. And that #37 Grand theft Auto IV, was the weakest title of them all and doesnt fit in the top 100 and same goes for Dragon Age origins which was a good game but still not top 100 recogntion.  Whats missing on that top 100 in my opinion, are atleast the following titles :  Wolfenstein 3D, Duke Nukem 3D, Warcraft 1, Diablo 1, Quake 1, Morrowind, River City Ransom, Aladdin, Lion King, Contra, Duck Tales, Sonic 2 and 3, Worms, Banjo Kazooie, Grim Fandango, Theme Park.  Especially the shooter games as Wolfenstein 3d and Quake which just caved the way and pushed the limits to FPS games and gaming as we know it.  Ant note to say most of the things on that list doesnt even list any sport games (except wii sports) and any mmorpg besides World of Warcraft."

You can buy it in a bundle with the soundtrack too if you want to kill two birds with one stone."

Gaming4Gamers,3ddbal,jWalkerFTW,13,Thu Jul 16 00:28:18 2015 UTC,"Most of the songs from Halo: Combat Evolved actually. A Walk in the Woods, Under the Cover of Night, No More Dead Heroes, Covenant Dance, etc. are all smooth, chill, spacey, synthey songs. Some of the spacier songs from Halo 2 are great like High Charity Suite, and most of the crossover songs from Halo 3 like Tribute.  But if you really want chill from Halo music, go with Halo 3 ODST. Soft piano, beautiful saxophone and horns, with a smooth jazzy, noir-like theme. Not to mention some soothing sounds of rain.  I can make you a YouTube playlist once I get home today! You'll be listening to Deference for Darkness every rainy day from then on, I guarantee it.  EDIT: Here is the playlist!  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4YGcRoiU14wM8YDaQBvemE5oA-em2XgR"

Marty O'Donnell (and Michael Salvatori of course) are musical geniuses. They went from creating the Flintstones vitamin and Mr. Clean jingles, to the orchestral and synth masterpieces of Halo and Destiny"
Gaming4Gamers,3ddbal,HavocsCall,2,Wed Jul 15 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"Just updated the comment with a link to the playlist! A few things:  1) Certain songs are kindof a mashup of multiple songs, most notably the ""suites"" from Halo 2 (it's just the way they were put together for the CDs) and in the ODST songs, which are all technically suites. So if you come across any of the ""suites"" or a particularly long song, there may be some more intense parts of it, but they wont last long and the rest of the ""chill"" part of the song will be 100x worth it.  3) I excluded most of the ""scary"" music involving The Flood, with the exception of Black Gate. Definitely wait it out (it's not very long) or at least just skip to the end, because the last minute or so is in my top 3 favorite songs of the series.  4) If you like this music, there's so many more songs that are simply badass and fun to listen to while driving or working out or something. I highly recommend checking out the rest, and I'd be absolutely willing to make a playlist of more upbeat songs if you're interested!  Oh and on a side note, I haven't included any music from Halo 4, Halo Wars, or Halo: Spartan Assault. The exclusion of the latter two is simply because I'm not very familiar with the soundtracks, though I do know Halo Wars has some beautiful music in general if you want to check it out. As for Halo 4... Well let's just say the music in that game is sub-par. But it's not from either Marty and Michael, or the Halo Wars guy so it makes sense it wouldn't be as good.  Enjoy!"

Found a bow that has the mod +1 to bow gems. I still need a five link bow that does that which also has 1 red, 2 green and 2 blue gem sockets. (skills are gems, support skills are also gems). So I can link my Poison arrow (green) with: Slower Projectiles (more dmg, green), Concentraded effect (smaller AoE but more dmg, blue), AoE for more AoE(blue) and Empower (+1 or +2 to gems; more dmg, red).

If you want to do a hard mode run, or grind for the best possible units, it will take some time. I'm grinding on my current run and am at about 24 hours at about halfway through the story.   FEA was one of nintendo's first ventures into dlc. They did a lot right imo, there's a lot of free dlc in terms of unique teams to fight and items to earn. There's also paid dlc which I haven't played. It ranges from fights that give more money/xp, to story missions. You can find a lot of those on YouTube if you don't want to pay for them."

I'm enjoying the hell out of the game. The tank is fun, although probably a bit overused. The side missions are entertaining. Gameplay is top notch. It really has been a fun ride.  Rocket League. After hearing some hype about this one along with the fact that it's a PS+ game I decided to give it a go. A fun, hectic soccer game. If real soccer was this entertaining I just might actually watch it."

It's an adventure game from Suda51, so of course there's going to be a strange story and an unusual way to play. So far I'm really fascinated by it. Rather than just looking for items by hitting the A button everywhere, you need to observe carefully at the clues then enter the correct number.

Gaming4Gamers,3dd1wg,morecowbell24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"Less to share this week, but I'm still going strong, beating games with consistency.   Aliens versus Predator (1999)  So you get 3 brief campaigns. The Alien one is decent. The marine one is bad. The Predator one is pretty good. This game is mostly fun for the differences in each character. The alien crawls on walls and through ducts to get in close and bite peoples heads off. The Marine has to be careful and mind his motion tracker. The Predator basically just takes all comers. Couldn't find any matches online, so that's dead. I do recall playing one a few years ago when I first bought the game with like 2 people, and it didn't seem great back then.   Unreal Tournament (1999)  Couldn't really find a good lobby to join in my time yet, but fortunately the bots hold up pretty well. I played through a singleplayer tournament and defeated Xan. These arena shooters are fun, but it's easy to see why they've fizzled out. The skill difference between the people still playing and a more casual player is just too extreme.   Unreal Tournament 2004 (2004)  Same story as the original. Bots are still good, so I played through a singleplayer tournament when I couldn't find a good lobby.   Command & Conquer: Renegade (2002)  Man, this game was shaping up to be so rad. When it started off, it still felt like C&C, but I was on the ground. After that nostalgia trip wore off, I realized the shooting was kind of meh and the most braindead of all AI in the history of AI became more and more of a bore. While the multiplayer is down, i tested it out with bots, and it seems quite similar to what Halo 5's Warzone mode is shaping up to be. There is some Renegade X mod/thing out there I haven't really looked into yet for multiplayer. Conceptually Renegade is one of the coolest FPS games I've played. But its AI is just so damn bad, like literally the worst ever."
Gaming4Gamers,3dd1wg,corporateswine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"Alien Isolation; Exploring Sevastopel station give me the System Shock 2 vibes that I crave once more, the environment is truly masterfully designed down to every nook and cranny, and they nail the 80's sci fi aesthetic perfectly.   The Alien is initially terrifying as hell, and even once the scare factor wears offm evading and outsmarting the Alien is still an incredibly fun experience (something I find many survival horrors with a central monster/hunter often struggle with).   I find as far as the Survival + Horror + Action balance goes, Alien Isolation really hits a good point akin to the original Resident Evil trilogy, combat is there and although its not the most polished it is still a fun experience, but resource scarcity and really good stealth mechanics make evading combat just as necessary and entertaining as naught.   The story is okay, the voice acting for the main character seems to stand arms and legs above every other character and its very noticeable. The story so far (I have yet to finish it) is very standard to the point of underwhelming so far, but serves well in furthering the gameplay, and along with visual and audio aesthetics does a perfectly fine job of building tension never the less."

Gaming4Gamers,3dd1wg,kentathon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"Two console games, Lego Jurassic World and Elder Scrolls Online. Jurassic World is a blast and the first lego game I've played since one of the early Star Wars ones. Closest thing we'll probably ever get to a game that lets you explore in this world. Elder Scrolls I got for no other reason than to play with a few co-workers who have the game. For a console-mmo it's better than I expected, and a nice break from Skyrim which is long since stale.  On PC, a bunch:  Oceanhorn - It's an okay 'zelda style' game. Not amazing, but not awful. Got it during the Steam sale and only just recently had time to try it out. It's one of those games I'll complete, but won't bother fully exploring to 100% unless some new mechanics later in the game hook me.  Republique Remastered  - Another Steam sale game I'm only getting into recently. A very unique twist on typical stealth games and way, way better than I could have expected. Unfortunately it's an 'episode' style of game which means it's actually incomplete at the moment.  Guild of Dungeoneering - I'm barely into it, but it has me hooked already. It's shaping up to be exactly the kind of game that Hand of Fate failed to be. I'll see how it holds up once I get further and see all it has to discover, but it's looking good.  Dirty Bomb - Trying it out to get my fps fix since every other fps I have is boring at this point. It feels like Team Fortress but with way, way better gunplay(similar to CS). It'll probably hold me for a few weeks, but the in game shop has me weary of taking the game seriously, since I'm not willing to spend real money for the best gear.  World of Warcraft  - Gotten sort of hooked on the game lately after an almost five year hiatus. It feels kind of odd having left the game in more or less a 'top 1% of players' position and now seeing content that is so dumbed down and easy than anyone can do anything. I'm just leveling alts and taking small pokes at the end game content, since I don't want to get back into the habit of raiding regularly, especially when the content is so simple. Progressing through end game raids means nothing compared to what it used to."

It seems that at its time, the game must have been amazing both production wise and general quality wise. Even though no single gameplay element is amazing by itself, the rotation of mechanics make the game more enjoyable. The writing and the story seem to be picking up so I'm excited for what's to come.  I'm also about to start System Shock 2 . I looked for mods, downloaded them and made sure they work and I'm just waiting for the night to come because I'm told that the first levels are scary as hell.  Finally, I have been playing some Skullgirls . It's the first fighting game that hasn't made me feel overwhelmed. I started playing Filia and getting to a level that I feel competent. I'm trying Parasoul now and I'm getting the hang of her. Enjoyed my break into fighting games so far and recommend Skullgirls for other fighting game beginners (however mouse+kb didn't work out for me - instead I'm using a controller) ."

(If your wanting to fly cap ships or the like.)    Combat is usally not so action packed from your view either.  Your best served to pull way out, see a lot of different colored dots and try to quickly assess and react to the situation.    If your right behind your ship in your battle getting that nice cinematic view, your probably doing it wrong.  If you noticed they don't show combat with the HUD up. Thats because its a lot less cinematic, its not 1 for 1 control, and involves a lot of menu and button clicking.   Having said all that, eve is fun and worth your time, but I think if you are thinking of playing it you should watch more videos than just this to get a feel for how the game actually plays.   o/"

Gaming4Gamers,3d9evj,SulliverVittles,15,Tue Jul 14 19:48:06 2015 UTC,"Here's a link to a good video that has more of the comms from the Bomber's Bar section.  To explain why he's so excited:  Bombs in eve travel a certain distance then explode doing massive aoe damage, they're not targeting like most other types of weaponry. You can very easily ""miss"" with a bomb.  Stealth bombers are very small ships that are able to fit these bombs. They are able to be stealthed, decloak then deploy bombs in a short space of time (usually ships can't do much just after they decloak).  This means, coordinating a group of extremely fragile ships that can all decloak each other if they get too close, getting them to decloak simultaneously (or in stages, hence gold group etc being used in the video), then bomb at exactly the right range to catch the group of ships they are aiming for then warping off immediately to avoid getting trapped is a very difficult, skilful and exhilarating thing.  Bonus: Here is a hilarious video of the game's best worst FC, DurrHurrDurr in his classic calm and serene style. Do not watch if easily offended (or at all)."

It's not the best RPG; it has a pretty mediocre combat system, horrid inventory management, and is almost impossible to beat without a walkthrough. However what it lacks in gameplay it more than makes up for in humor, charm, style, and story. I replay this game once every couple of years and the jokes in it still land on me. It's absurd but earnest. If you play this game PLEASE take the time to talk to all the NPCs. That is where the game shines."

That is why most Pirate releases these days are just a cracked steamclient.dll file that has broken the code for a particular game, and allows that game to run when placed along side it.  DISCLAIMER: I could be completely wrong, but I'm a developer, and I've seen this DLL get included in a number of pirate releases - makes perfect sense to me that the DLL would basically be hashing some value that the game provides, in some kind of key exchange scheme to offer similar protection to what SSL provides."

It's called Guns of Icarus Online, and you play on a crew of 4 people and man a Steampunk style airship and battle it out against other ships. One person gets to fly the ship while the others can be engineers or gunners. It's a lot of fun if you have your own group of people to play with. There is 1v1 up to I think 4v4 (ships, not players; making that 16 players per team at 4v4). It also has it's own in-game chat with multiple channels; one for chatting with the crew of your own ship, another for chatting with commanders of other ships on your team (if playing 2v2 or higher and you are a commander), and maybe a general?"

Gaming4Gamers,3d11ku,pitaenigma,3,Mon Jul 13 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"See, I don't get that. I'm a huge Song of Ice and Fire fan, and I keep marvelling at how people all over are discussing something I was mocked for loving ten years ago. I find it wonderful that all of these people share an interest with me even though ""I liked it when it was obscure"" because really, it wasn't that obscure. And I love Bakker, and if he gets lucky enough to have a film made of his books I'll be entertained by it as well. Just because other people like what you do doesn't make it worse. And you can enjoy niche comics and superhero ones, but don't pretend that Transmetropolitan or Preacher or other non superhero fare is niche. You'll still see tons of comic book fans who love them. If I go to Comic Con dressed like Spider Jerusalem, people will know who it is.  Seriously, I'm looking at my comic book shelf and it is severely lacking in superheroes. I realize I'm only a casual collector and not a representative, but Sandman, tons of Moore, Preacher, The Walking Dead, Starcraft (kind of crap, btw), some webcomic collections (Penny Arcade, Order of the Stick), and yes, some superheroes. Deadpool (two volumes), Red Son, It's A Bird, Punisher MAX (one volume), and Watchmen. And some George R R Martin adaptations because I'm one of those fans. And any exposure to something I love is great. So if a filthy casual decides he likes Game of Thrones, great! If the new American Gods show leads to more Gaiman fans, great! And if I only read Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth because I hear the game is based on it, that's also great. Because Grant Morrison is a great writer and it's better if more people know about him than less. And Rocksteady really proved themselves with the Arkham trilogy."
Gaming4Gamers,3d11ku,KotakuSucks2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:10:02 2015 UTC,"My interest is not based on obscurity.  I got tired of superhero shit years ago and then they hit it big in film and now I can't go anywhere without seeing them.  Every superhero piece of shit I see is a reminder of how every aspect of the medium as a whole got fucked over by Marvel and DC at every possible opportunity and in return they reaped nothing but rewards.  I don't care that superheroes are popular, but them being popular results in me having to see and hear shit about them all the goddamn time and each one is a little point of aggravation.  So I want to see them go back to being a small niche so they're easy to ignore.  Sorry thats too hipster for you, that someone doesn't like a homogenous group of stories that have completely destroyed a medium I was really into.  I have no idea what on earth you're going on about with your comics collection, its basically a greatest hits collection, nothing wrong with it but theres nothing remarkable either, its stuff everyone interested in the medium has read.  If you're trying to impress me or something, you don't have to.  Its irrelevant to what I'm talking about.  The medium is dominated by two markets, three if I'm being generous.  One is the superhero crowd (DC, Marvel, some Image), one is the artsy fartsy TCJ crowd (FG,D+Q, Top Shelf, all the super indie publishers), and the other is the small but growing scifi/fantasy crowd (Dark Horse, IDW, Image).  I hesitate to include the  last group because really its a cycle of a single comic becoming popular, the flavor of the month, everyone buys into it for a while, it gets optioned for a movie and then everyone forgets about it to move onto the next thing (see: prophet, manhattan projects, Invincible).  I lost interest in following comics as a whole because over time I came to hate the first group, the second group cares a bit too much for message and too little for craft, and the third tends to be pretty homogenous.  I still pick something new up now and then but the medium's stuck in a rut and its not likely to ever change since Marvel and DC will always be the dominant forces.  As far as the things I do like go, I'd be happy to see em get popular, I wish that I could talk to people about them with a common frame of reference.  If I still liked superheroes I would be happy about the current pop culture landscape, unfortunately I don't and I'm not."
Gaming4Gamers,3d11ku,Fafnesbane,3,Mon Jul 13 01:45:54 2015 UTC,Why would you want that? The only way the medium and industry in the US would get more diverse is if it get more popular and attracts more readers and people to work in it.  Also there are loads of great series that are neither superhero nor 2Deep4u.
Gaming4Gamers,3d11ku,KotakuSucks2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:01:51 2015 UTC,"Medium's been dead in the US since the late 90's when all the distributors folded and the only one left was Diamond who only distributes to comic shops.  You will never see comics make a return to the mainstream when the only way to purchase them is in dedicated shops, they'd have to come back to grocery stores, convenience stores and pharmacies.  Unfortunately these days the comic market is solely focused on sucking the money out of adult fans so comics are too expensive for a kid to buy with pocket change even if they were available in places that kids could get them.  I love comics but I'd rather see them die than continue limping along as fanboy pandering garbage.  Moebius' death barely registered as significant in the US while The Avengers was breaking box office records, Bob Kane gets his name on anything Batman related while Bill Finger continues to get jack shit in terms of credit.  The industry never recovered from the self-imposed censorship of the comic code and the loss of EC, it looked like it might finally be recovering in the 90's only for DC and Marvel to flood the market with trash, resulting in the industry managing to get even worse instead with every single independent publisher folding outside of Image, Dark Horse and Fantagraphics."

Similarly, the online modes in 3 and 4, in which ive spent close to 1500 hours between the two, taught me to be a competitive player and how to excel at online games, specially shooters.

It taught me concepts of controlling area, mind games, twitch aiming and reactions, and multiplayer strategy.  After years it just became easy to know the timing on the shield belt naturally while defending areas and knowing based on teammates positions what parts of the map were under your control and what weapons your team had and they didn't have (TDM) or if it was a good time to steal a flag/push or to fall back and regain positioning (CTF).  These skills now carry over into nearly every style of FPS I play in some manner.  It's sad this style of shooter isn't popular any longer.  I miss having aim be laser accurate and the skill ceiling was outer-space high.  Devil May Cry (series).  Focus and precision.  This game is all about doing what you want to do when you want to do it, and making sure it's even a good idea to do it.  The harder difficulties are punishing to mistakes.

Usually, the best way to beat a level (and coincidentally get an A+ time rating on the level) is to go full bore and don't slow down. You'd be surprised how much the traps seem to flow around you if you don't stop. This meant that I had to trust in my inputs and not psyche myself out. Definitely helps in future fighting games I play!  Ninja Gaiden II  This gem taught me patience. This is one of my favorite games and I have beaten it on all difficulty levels save Master Ninja. The patience lesson came from me just getting my ass handed to me again and again (Chapter 6 Lycanthropes anyone?). So I literally just sat for about 10 minutes and watched enemy attack patterns tear Ryu to shreds. Utilizing that technique of patient observance, the rest of the game was a cakewalk...more or less.  F-Zero GX  Older brothers can be especially ruthless when they play you and mine, love him though I may, was especially asshole-ish sometimes :D F-Zero probably taught me more about humility and perseverance than any game I think. I practiced hard and often to beat my older brother on as many stages as I could and even though I was way less apt at the technical mechanics of turning and such, I still managed to go about 50/50 with him on wins. One course, however, I had mastered and would beat him mercilessly at it. I spared him the gloating and he stopped underestimating me. This also applies to fighting game mind manipulation against opponents. Practice hard and be humble, you never know when the tables will turn."

Gaming4Gamers,3cy00z,riomhaire,5,Sun Jul 12 07:17:04 2015 UTC,"That game was a disaster. An amazing, fun disaster.   The only memory I really have from my brief time there was working in a diner that actually had real job activities (take food to tables, clean up, etc) and then going home to run a bed and breakfast with some dude I met when I first played. We were next door to a big party house so we made shitloads of money, it was incredible."
Gaming4Gamers,3cy00z,unkillable94,2,Sat Jul 11 23:32:06 2015 UTC,"I regret not having a subscription to this, even for just a month, when I was little. The Sims is my favorite series. I remember finding the box for this game on the shelf at the store and BEGGING for it, but not getting it. Even if it sucked, I would've liked to experience it. There's no real video or anything of it because it was from before the time when people recorded their stuff and you can't play it now to record it posthumously.  I got a sealed boxed copy a year ago, it's on my shelf of collected stuffs. I love it. I want to open it and read the manual. The box is so heavy."

I never was able to spend much time until the end of the cycle because of the subscription, but I did replay that month or whatever a hundred times. By the way, there are no subscriptions, or any of the limitations that the original had.   It also gets some fairly regular updates!"

At least, where I'm from, a customer is not entitled to a refund or reimbursement if an item comes as a ancillary bonus to another product.  If the product was more expensive due to the presence of the item - that is, if the item could be bought seperate, for a cheaper price... I dont know. I have no idea what occurs at that point."

Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,BrainSlurper,4,Sat Jul 11 06:32:21 2015 UTC,The fact Arkham Knight will still sell shitloads in the steam sale next year I doubt they will be worried to much.
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,PaleWolf,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:03:27 2015 UTC,I'm sure $5 sales of the complete edition will really help them.
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,BrainSlurper,6,Sat Jul 11 12:53:40 2015 UTC,Yes it will... That's how sales work. The sell you something you wouldn't have bought normally that's £5 profit straight away.
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,PaleWolf,2,Sat Jul 11 12:57:47 2015 UTC,"For a AAA game, $5 is a disaster. Early sales make or break a release, the money from sales two years down the road is just a bonus."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,businesstravis,6,Sat Jul 11 13:00:40 2015 UTC,$5 for a game you wouldn't have sold is great though.
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,I__Just__Wanna__Help,-1,Sat Jul 11 13:36:27 2015 UTC,Yeah but not for a game you invested millions of dollars into making.
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,greenthumble,5,Sat Jul 11 14:52:05 2015 UTC,Better $5 than $0.
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,flashnexus,3,Sat Jul 11 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah this thread is weird. Obviously game sales taper. Once you hit a critical threshold, opening it up with a $5 sale suddenly pumps that graph right back up for a little while, an infusion of cash that obviously would not have existed."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,AJT217,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:52:53 2015 UTC,But it's better to have sold 100 at $60 then 100 at $5. Initial bad press cost them the players who would have paid full retail and are now waiting for discounting GOTY versions
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,ours,0,Sat Jul 11 19:05:35 2015 UTC,If you think the complete edition of arkham Knight will be $5 anytime in the next 3 years you don't pay attention to game prices.

Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,Deutschmarxist,2,Sat Jul 11 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"They are saying that it didn't meet their own standards, but they released it anyway.  That doesn't seem like a good thing.  How can anyone trust the quality of what they release anymore?"
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,darkpassenger9,8,Mon Jul 13 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of negative comments here on something that isn't necessarily deserving of it.   Of all the things they could say, this is pretty decent. They are taking full responsibility and are apologising. Sure, they released a broken game but I don't think it's fair to constantly rake them over the coals even when they are taking responsibility. It's not going to help anyone."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,xenoxonex,5,Sat Jul 11 06:35:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was shocked when I saw what sub I was in. Thought I was on r/games for a while, with all the pitchforks out."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,notdeadyet01,9,Sat Jul 11 16:24:35 2015 UTC,No. They've constantly releases shit ports. The entire industry releases broken games all the time. It's not time to put the pitchforks down over some meaningless lip service.
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,Deutschmarxist,11,Sat Jul 11 07:33:44 2015 UTC,"I mean... MkX and Arkham Knight were shit ports.  Arkham Asylum, City, and Origins (Eh, the game itself was pretty buggy, i wouldn't blame it on the port), not to mention all of the lego games have been good."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,Keming_Matters,5,Sat Jul 11 08:56:44 2015 UTC,"Fine. Then condemn them for THAT, not for saying ""Sorry, we apologise and take full responsibility.""  No one is asking you to forgive and forget because they apologise, but shitting on them even when they are being contrite just validates the stereotype of gamers being cynical and impossible to please. Reward good behaviour, condemn bad behaviour. Not everything has to be ""this is the worst"" or ""this is the best"" all the time. The hyperbole and extremism doesn't help anyone. Take everything as it comes and exercise perspective and understanding."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,MrCookiepants,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:36:04 2015 UTC,"But an insincere apology is just words not behavior, an easy PR statement that means nothing. It's the same as when a politician or celebrity apologizes after saying something abhorrent, they don't actually regret anything. They were fine releasing shoddy ports until Steam refunds happened, so of course people are going to condemn them for it."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,acarlrpi12,8,Sat Jul 11 08:12:59 2015 UTC,"What more do you want them to do? They actually took a step in fixing their problems, which is more than what can be said about the tons of other game companies. Suspending their sales is a huge move to make, and you guys all just seem to gloss over that fact. Yes, the port was terrible, and they probably should have had processes in place to stop it from happening. They didn't, but have since said that they are changing their practices to ensure it doesn't happen again. By all means, if the next port for a game of theirs comes out as bad, go nuts all you want. But don't do it yet, when they are actually trying to fix their shit."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,Ptylerdactyl,-2,Sat Jul 11 10:39:56 2015 UTC,"How about now release buggy ports games that are clearly not ready for release? It's good that they are fixing it, but its impossible that  they didn't know the state it was in before release which means they were fine with fucking over their customers up until their customers had some way to get their money back? There is absolutely zero chance that WB was not aware of these issues before launch."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,koeleskab,5,Sat Jul 11 11:16:37 2015 UTC,You know what else is impossible? WB going back in time and fixing this before it launched.  They're apologizing repeatedly and fixing it. I'm not sure what else people can demand.
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,Ptylerdactyl,0,Sat Jul 11 12:48:35 2015 UTC,"less talk, more work."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,Deutschmarxist,3,Sat Jul 11 17:31:51 2015 UTC,It's Saturday. I'll work on Monday.
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,MrCookiepants,2,Sat Jul 11 22:59:56 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by this? Not posting an apology and an update and staying quiet while fixing the game?   We all know how that would work out. ""WHY AREN'T WB KEEPING US INFORMED? THEIR COMMUNICATION SUCKS! THEY'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT US! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US!""  This is the point I was trying to make. When you condemn a company even when they're saying sorry (regardless of whether or not you think they are being sincere, and no, you don't know either way for sure) you put them in a completely unwinnable situation and make yourself look completely unpleasable and unreasonable.  Not helpful to them, not helpful to you. Unless you're addicted to catharsis."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,Keming_Matters,2,Sun Jul 12 02:42:02 2015 UTC,"I have the game, and I played it. I experienced nowhere near the problems people are complaining about. The port does work, but not to the graphics standard some people want it. Companies often don't listen to their customers, but this time they actually did and are actively trying to fix it. Keeping the insults flying at this point does nothing. But of course, this is the internet, so you guys are going to rage no matter what happens."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,MrCookiepants,5,Sat Jul 11 11:34:58 2015 UTC,"That's great it works for you, I have a 960, I'm above the recommended settings yet the game runs at 12 fps with everything on low. The idea that people are just upset because they can't run it on 4k ultra is just as pointless as insulting WB. I'm glad they've owned up to their mistakes and pulled sales, but it doesn't change that they tried to get away with it in the first place, people are still going to be mad at them and that's understandable. But you do have a point, there's not much point in insulting them at this point, all we can do is hope they do change, I get that, and if they actually do change I'll be happy to buy their games again.   But of course, this is the internet, so you guys are going to rage no matter what happens.   That's a real nice attitude to have. That's what I'm really tired of. I'm goddamn sick of this ""us vs them"" attitude. I'm fucking sick of people dehumanizing others into some strawman hivemind so they can feel superior. I'm fucking sick of nobody ever treating people they disagree with any respect or kindness. I'm fucking sick of this shitty condescending attitude treating people like caricatures instead of actual goddamn humans and the absolute refusal to even contemplate anything resembling empathy.  Edit: I know you're not doing any of those things specifically, but I've seen it so much and that last comment was just the straw that broke the camel's back. I'm just having a shitty day with my dog being put down. =("
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,Keming_Matters,5,Sat Jul 11 15:14:08 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry about your dog. I know how that feels and it sucks. Just hang in there.  I don't get how you could only get 12 fps, when I got around 25-30 pretty stable, with only a 750 TI. The game was definitely playable for me, which is also why I spent 20 hours playing it. It's not in any way good enough, but I just didn't experience the things people are claiming is making the game unplayable.  The attitude might not be ideal, but just looking at what has been happening on reddit in general in the last week or two, or how gaming subreddits looked at the launch of the game, can you really blame me? Please use incredibly harsh language to convey their points, completely ignoring the human on the receiving end of those messages. I've worked in customer service, I know what it's like to get contacted by people like them. The people who keep complaining and insulting them after the company try to do their best to fix their mistakes are not helping anybody."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,xenoxonex,0,Sat Jul 11 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"That was one of the problems, a lot of people were getting mixed results irrespective of systems.  I can't really blame you either, people like that can be terrible. But not everyone complaining about Arkham Knight goes on to harass customer service people, a lot of them are just venting their genuine frustrations about a company online, and they don't deserve some of the callous remarks I've seen like ""whiny little shits"" and ""crybabies"" either.  People on both sides just need to remember the human."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,NanoNarse,0,Sat Jul 11 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not interested in fighting stereotypes. Not everything has to be 'this is the best/worst' all the time, and while hyperbole and extremism don't help anyone. writing some angry comments on the internet don't qualify as hyperbole and extremism. Releasing a game that's not broken should be something that happens by defaul - instead, it's the opposite. Yet another broken game in the long long list of games. Some text in a blog post for the company isn't enough.  delaying a game when necessary is what's enough, and that's not happening."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,StrikeAnywherePanda,-1,Sat Jul 11 22:18:52 2015 UTC,"At this point, they're just words. And words are so incredibly easy for a PR rep to pump out.  What matters are actions. Pulling the game to fix it is a start, but only a start. People will only let up on them when the game is actually fixed, and will only forgive when their next PC port is a good one from release."
Gaming4Gamers,3cvae6,bigchiefmsu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:17:38 2015 UTC,"To be honest, as a console gamer, the PC market got so fucked because of this game that I think the people who kept it should get the season pass for free."

Gaming4Gamers,3cuh83,obsidianchao,10,Sat Jul 11 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"There are two possibilities. The first is that (at least before this expansion, I don't know if they changed it) this game really doesnt start to payoff on builds until you have gotten through a bit of it. The gameplay in the beginning feels slow, clunky, and all around like your character is bad. Its not until you've leveled and gotten parts of your build together that things pick up. I'd recommend looking at some build posts online and don't even read them, just watch videos of people showing how their build works. If the builds and gameplay look fun to you, give it a go and use the build guide as your bible. You'll start to learn all the mechanics and why builds choose certain characteristics. Though this expansion may make it harder to find ready to go builds, there should be some out there since the beta had been going for a bit. The second possibility is that you just don't like the game, and that's fine too. But for the price, you can't go wrong giving it another shot."
Gaming4Gamers,3cuh83,PenguinoMcDirt,4,Sat Jul 11 02:33:28 2015 UTC,Did they add new map content with this patch? I've never liked replaying the same game over and over but really liked the first play through a lot.

I was never added before, despite having the requisite experience level; I could never find any explanation for that either.  Since you aren't able to post items to poe.trade without being on the ladders somewhere, I kinda lost interest in the game after this as I feel like I am losing out on things that other players my level have access to that I, for some reason, don't."

There was no waiting for turns, I would just go about my life and take the turn whenever it suited me, or I would see that he hadn't taken his turn yet and I would just check back later.  I'd love to have a little holographic chessboard floating or sitting on a table or sitting on a digital table. Hologram furniture. No chance of bumping it and sending the pieces flying, just go about your daily business while you wait for your friend 5000 miles away to take their turn. Maybe even a voice command or gesture to switch from board to board, so you can take on multiple opponents (in different games, even!) at once.

The drastically varying environments is something I want to see with ""my own eyes"". Plus, the world has a sense of immersion and really brings you into the world. I think putting it into VR would give it a great experience.  That, and Firewatch. An explorative game like that would be great to see in VR."

Heck, you could go on virtual tours of anywhere in the world, or historical re-enactments of real places, or even fictional places.  Plus, maybe all the travelly stuff is going on outside the train, and you can observe it from your private car, of course... or you could take in the sights from the comfort of the dining car, where you can share the experience with a few dozen other people who have boarded the same virtual train."

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,lordofpurple,25,Sat Jul 11 13:25:53 2015 UTC,"Bioshock would be the first one to come to mind. I loved the original so much I've simply stayed away from the sequels. It's just a perfect game in my mind. Second would be The Last of Us, absolutely stunning game, loved the gameplay as much as the narrative."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,rehsarht,10,Fri Jul 10 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"I loved the storytelling in bioshock. The way it slowly revealed more about the characters in the game, up until the end where we realize that everything is the opposite of what we've assumed from this point forward was incredible. Getting to hear everything in audio, coupled with the incredibly well crafted atmosphere was perfect.  Were there more cutscenes in the game than the beginning and ""would you kindly"" or is that it? Cause thats some pretty strong use of the difference between cutscenes and audio files for storytelling.  The sequels are also really good too. Bioshock 2 wasn't as well liked, but I really enjoyed the story. If you're a fan of 1 then you HAVE to play the DLC from Infinite. Burial at Sea episode 2 has to be my favourite DLC I've ever played, but playing Bioshock 1, infinite, and Burial at Sea 1 were pretty heavy prerequisites for getting the full enjoyment out of it.  The Last of Us was also incredible too. It definitely drew strong emotions from me with the story. It was really well-written and the world was very well thought out and crafted. It felt like I was actually in a post-zombie world."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,xX_BL1ND_Xx,2,Fri Jul 10 23:42:50 2015 UTC,"I loved all three of the Bioshocks, but Infinite really fucking my head. I loved it, but every time I hear Booker, I just get a sudden sense of fear for some reason."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,t3hcoolness,72,Sat Jul 11 13:11:44 2015 UTC,"The whole Ezio trilogy from Assassin's Creed. It's the first time I've ever played through someone's entire life. I watched Ezio as he was born, then raced his brother on the rooftops of Florence when he was a skirt-chasing teenager. I saw him become a angry, vicious killer after he witnessed the executions of his father and brothers. After that, he managed to find inner peace, and truly became a man when he put the principles of the Order above his personal vendetta.  Then finally, I played him as the Mentore of the Assassin Order, with salt in his beard and grey around his temples. I watched as he found Altair's tomb and fulfilled the purpose of his life.  I've never experienced something like that in a videogame since. I was a couple years too old for the Harry Potter craze but I think the concept of growing up with Harry is probably why the series holds so much sentimentality for my younger friends."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,metsuken,8,Fri Jul 10 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"If you never got a chance to see Assassin Creed Embers, I really recommend it. It's a CGI short about Ezio in his first years, and I thought it brought some great closure to his story."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,ZakTH,4,Sat Jul 11 00:58:26 2015 UTC,"I was hoping this would be here. I feel like this kind of story is why the newer ass creeds have been lacking, aside from the lack of gameplay innovation. assassins creed 2 will always be in my top 10 favorite video game list just for its story."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,BRUH_BRAH,3,Sat Jul 11 04:01:54 2015 UTC,Yes i'm glad AC2 is someone elses favourite. Just the theme of revenge throughout the game and actually understanding the main characters choices and feeling the way he felt. The only Assassins Creed game to grip me that well and really play with my emotions.
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,SimplyPodly,2,Sat Jul 11 05:15:29 2015 UTC,"While a revenge story is pretty accessible, I liked AC best when Ezio moved past vengeance and focused on the values of leadership and wisdom. That, to me, made him much easier to root for."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,gianttabby,6,Mon Jul 13 00:12:19 2015 UTC,This. So much. People bag on revelations when this is the exact reason it's my favourite in the series. It concludes Ezio and Altair's journeys and is such a great conclusion to their stories.
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,vakda,2,Fri Jul 10 23:45:55 2015 UTC,"I like how we feel like we grow up along with characters in a long term experience. You're not just hearing references of off-screen events because chances are you were there when it happened so-and-so characters. It works well with getting invested in a character that has alot happening. Not just with Assassin's Creed, but also Persona 4 and The Walking Dead. Same applies outside of games, such as Game Of Thrones. The deaths in the books/show are shocking not because of how brutal the death is, but because you witness the death of a character you were invested in and wanted to see keep going."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,gianttabby,15,Mon Jul 13 00:11:16 2015 UTC,This may be a bit of a weird one for this topic but Gears of War 3. I lost my dad when I was young so Marcus' journey throughout that game really affected me. The ending hit me really hard and has stuck with me ever since.
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,rabidassbaboon,2,Fri Jul 10 20:38:29 2015 UTC,Not weird at all that game series had a above average plot and characters.
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Civil718,15,Tue Jul 14 03:57:31 2015 UTC,Homeworld.  When it came out there was really nothing like it. The fact that it was so disassociated from anything humanoid (we didn't even really know if they were humans) made the story more ethereal for me.   They mixed in the tribal with the technological before the new Battlestar Galactica did. That long lonesome road back to home. Just powerful.

I'm going off memory, so if the quote is a bit off, then be kind. I played that a decade ago i think.   Still. For a story with no real central characters... it was incredibly endearing. I still remember when I lost the barge full of cyrogenically sleeping people. The game voice / fleet commander somberly tells you how many of the last of your people were lost.  This is an escort mission... I'm not supposed to feel this way..."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,WiiWynn,12,Sat Jul 11 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"Ghost Trick's plot really hit it with me. The puzzle elements are cool and all, but hell, I don't think I'd even remember the game if it weren't for the plot. The puzzles mesh really well with the story as well; it's not like Professor Layton where it's like ""you've finished this scene, solve this irrelevant puzzle to advance to the next scene!"" I really recommend that everyone play it; it's a severely underrated game."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,MBArceus,14,Fri Jul 10 21:13:02 2015 UTC,"Mother 3. On the surface, it's a weird JPRG unlike any other outside its series. Delving in, one learns it's playable literature with a story just as deep and winding.  The game is split up into chapters, you play as multiple characters, and you see many points of view that are parallel, convergent, divergent, and even on opposite sides. You learn about the unfolding plot from different people who caused it, were affected by it, or helplessly stood by as it happened all around them.  I can't really go into it without spoiling the entire game, but I strongly recommend you check it out."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,fyrenwater,2,Fri Jul 10 23:03:34 2015 UTC,I cried many tears towards the end of that game. It truly is a masterpiece.
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,foxywolfy0,24,Sun Jul 12 04:56:07 2015 UTC,"Persona 4  This doesn't really spoil plot points, but more touches on some of the games core themes.  The idea of having different faces or 'personas' that come out when you're around different people or groups really hit home with me. It was something I actually struggled to accept before playing because I'd never really been able to rationalize the concept. Is it really that odd to think that we all act different to, say, our parents than our friends? Or act differently when we're alone than with certain people?  It's tough to accept that they're all 'me', but doing so was really important and helped me be more accepting of who I am."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,data_double,7,Fri Jul 10 19:08:06 2015 UTC,IMO Persona 3's story was a bit better
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,rlbond86,3,Sat Jul 11 01:10:02 2015 UTC,"I preferred the story significantly more in P3P, but I think P4G hit the point I mentioned a bit harder."

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,fishmanssu,3,Sat Jul 11 06:18:14 2015 UTC,"I've seen people give P4 a lot of shit because of its plot, but personally I think it was written and drawn out really well and I actually felt really sad when it was over."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,ShawnWilson000,3,Sat Jul 11 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"As far as supernatural mystery plots go, I agree with you. Everything was in place and gave you a chance to deduce the killer's identity from the very beginning. It's like playing challenging but fair game like Dark Souls. Everything is subtly telegraphed and hinted for you to anticipate before it happens. Nothing felt out of place, so when the big reveal happened I was like ""Oooooohhh, I should've seen that coming!"""
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,gianttabby,2,Mon Jul 13 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"I'm playing through the game right now, and it's already in my top favorite games of all time. I'm going to be legitimately sad when Yu finally leaves Inaba."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,ZakTH,2,Sat Jul 11 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"P4 is so, soooo good. The main plot works on a very thematic/emotional level, and I sometimes just miss interacting with all of the party members."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,foxywolfy0,2,Sun Jul 12 04:55:15 2015 UTC,"Congrats, you summed up Jungian psychology.

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Colbey_uk,6,Fri Jul 10 19:50:46 2015 UTC,What about Mass Effect made it memorable for you?
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,13th_story,22,Fri Jul 10 20:29:28 2015 UTC,"I felt that they pulled the trigger. They didn't play it safe. It was a story on an epic scale and they went for it. Were there issues? yeah sure, but i'll always remember the story, as well as the characters in it.  It also felt like you existed in a living universe. They managed to write so many little bits in here and there (merchant places calling out your name, news stories in lifts, crazy fans, emails from previous people you've interacted with and the running romance stories) that it felt alive."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Colbey_uk,19,Fri Jul 10 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"It also felt like you existed in a living universe.

Oh yeah, that was one of the best parts of the game. Or seeing people in ME:2 that still remember you and talk about decisions you made in ME:1. I think people forget, but at the time decisions from one game carrying over into the sequel was really out there stuff. It was really ambitious and awesome."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,13th_story,7,Fri Jul 10 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"Mass Effect had phenomenal world-building. The universe felt rich and lived-in and had politics and explanations and history, and the characters themselves all had a rich backstory they'd be more than happy to vomit into your ears (but I mean thats what you get for asking) and I loved it."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,lordofpurple,3,Sat Jul 11 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"Shame about that ending, though. Such a broken promise."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Levy_Wilson,12,Sat Jul 11 04:33:51 2015 UTC,"As a huge, huge Mass Effect fan, I never felt betrayed by the ending.   I saved Wrex and the Krogans. I brought peace to the Quarians and the Geth. I saved the council and elevated Humanity in the galaxy. Sure, the decisions I made didn't ultimately make the final decision for the story, but rather the way the story was told to me.   Mass Effect ended the way Bioware wanted it to, but the ride to that ending was entirely decided by the player.   And what a fucking ride that was."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Marsdreamer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:05:46 2015 UTC,"It was stupid, but it was just one part of a larger whole so I'm pretty relaxed about it."

It's great exercise of skill and all, but it disproportionately affects my enjoyment of the piece. I can't really look back on those games fondly without remembering how heartbreaking it was to be in the fanbase at that time."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,BrainSlurper,9,Sat Jul 11 05:46:24 2015 UTC,"Ico - simple, perfect visual storytelling.  Okami - Not once, not twice, but three times, the game builds to an epic climax, then instead of just ending, it ups the ante, expands the world, and keeps you hungry for the next adventure.  Metal Gear Solid 2 - In my opinion, the greatest metanarrative in gaming history.  Commentary on hype/expectations, freedom, relationships, child soldiers, the problems of social media distorting context...  Every aspect of the game, from it initial press releases to the ZOE demo, to the game itself, feels like it is meant to be looked at as part of a coherent work of postmodern art.  Even the most disappointing aspects of the game are by design.  Red Dead Redemption - What can you say?  It's a cowboy shooter, sure, but the story is so cynical, bleak, and naturalistic, it feels at times more like a fatalistic independent film than a mainstream action game.  Ezio trilogy - Great characters, and one of the few games where I cry (running with big bro - ""it is a good life we lead, brother"" ""may it never change"" ""and may it never change us."""
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Xeuton,3,Fri Jul 10 21:35:38 2015 UTC,I replayed MGS2 a couple years ago for the first time in about ten years. Made a whole lot more sense at 26 then at 16. Made the game a lot more enjoyable too. Great game. I can't wait for The Phantom Pain.
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Sirusavath,2,Fri Jul 10 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"Haha I felt that too.  First time playing during high school: Wow, those were some neat twists and mind screws.  Years later into adulthood: IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW!!!!"
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,gianttabby,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:31:13 2015 UTC,"This right here.  You and I might even be the same age because I played MGS2 originally when I was about 16, and loved the crazy plot.  Played once more at 18 and enjoyed it again.  When I played at 26, all of a sudden I fully understood what I was ingesting and there was actually a moment I dropped the controller and went ""HOLY SHIT."" As if I experienced some plot twist in a game I HAVENT already played twice.  After that holy shit moment I played through the rest of the game and experienced everything in it deliberately and paid close attention.  It fucking blew my mind how MGS2 was always my go-to for best story yet I didn't even realize how GOOD it really was until ten years had passed."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,poomcgoo8,2,Tue Jul 14 17:13:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like MGS2 still holds up and remains relevant today. Everything about the flow of information, censorship, how to distinguish reality, and all that stuff is just so legit when it comes to the digital society.  Anytime I can't tell what's true or not, this is the game I reference when thinking about empirical information. In fact, one of my most critical experiences in life was almost like a reenactment of MGS2's conspiracies."

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Autonomoose,4,Fri Jul 10 20:17:59 2015 UTC,Old BioWare was amazing. I remember renting Jade Empire just cause I thought the box looked cool.   Ended up getting completely blown away by how amazing it was. I should replay that.
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,thefuckingswampking,5,Sat Jul 11 05:22:27 2015 UTC,Origins really stuck with me.  I still remember watching the entire closing credits with a sense of true satisfaction.

I found it had a pretty captivating story, and its characters were likely the deepest I've come across in any game by far. Throughout playing the games, I grew more attached to the two main characters Rosa and Joey, to the point that I genuinely cared about them when a plot twist makes things go from bad to worse for either of them.  I wish I could have my memories of my first time playing these games wiped so I could replay them all and still be able to cry."

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,hAND_OUT,9,Fri Jul 10 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"The story of Tactics never stuck with me. I was a little young when I played it, so I only really remember the gameplay of FF Tactics (which was awesome). I should probably go back and play it again.  That said, the plots never really stick with me. What I like from a video game story is more world building and character development. Which we see really good examples of with Spec Ops: The Line and Final Fantasy IX.  Mass Effect managed to make the actually plot stick with me really well, but I think that's more due to making decisions about the direction of the plot more than the plot itself.   Portal and Portal 2 both have good plots that are made great by the characters that live in that world.   Honestly, the best answer here (for me anyway) is Metroid Prime. If you want any plot info at all, you basically have to find it yourself. So you scan and read everything to get any kind of information about what's going on. The way things were hidden and the mechanics you used to find them really found a great balance between tedious and immersive. And it just sucked me into the story."

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,mfranko88,3,Sat Jul 11 05:15:54 2015 UTC,"Metroid Prime has an amazing story, told in an unconventional way. Literally nothing is spelled out for you, the entire story is told through hundreds of different informational logs. This means that anybody doing all of the scans and reading all of the logs is slowly piecing together information. The Chozo, the origins of Samus, Phazon, the biology....it all tells a pretty remarkable story.  They could have reshaped the game and introduced NPCs to help tell the story. It's good enough for a conventional presentation. But that undermines the piecemeal/puzzle aspect to the story and removes the quiet sense of isolation from the game. There are few cutscenes, no dialog, no loading screens. It's just you and the beautifully crafted environment.  It's my favorite game of all time. I love it."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Kpervs,2,Sat Jul 11 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"I highly appreciate that you said Prime. Everything you said is fantastically well done in Prime. It really created a breathing world, rather than a box for exploration. It is by far my favorite video game (although I kinda like Echoes more due to music and art style, plus the awesomeness that was the Sanctuary Fortress)."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,UnclaimedUsername,7,Sat Jul 11 02:25:28 2015 UTC,"Dragon Age: Origins. It somehow takes a bunch of standard fantasy tropes and combines them into something new. There's just a lot of great lore ""hooks"" that make me interested in the world (even though I haven't played either of the sequels). The Deep Roads, the Fade (yeah the Fade level was boring, but the concept is really cool), the idea that magic users are treated like they could become demonic killing machines at any moment, there are a lot of interesting twists in what at first glance looks like a pretty standard fantasy setting."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,sEcKtUr8,7,Fri Jul 10 22:58:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of people bashed Farcry 4 for basically being a reskin of Farcry 3, but the plot, in my opinion, was tremendously more memorable.  Spoilers ahead, for anyone who hasn't played  Ajay comes to Kyrat for one reason: to scatter his mother's ashes as per her wishes. You cross the Kyrati border in a bus filled with revolutionaries, and are caught up in the fracas that ensues when they are discovered. The country's eccentric dictator, Pagan Min, meets with you and speaks to you like an old friend, and escorts you from the bloodbath to his palace in the mountains. It is there that you meet DuPaul, his henchman, and the old man on the bus with you. Pagan is brutal as he interrogates the man in front of you, but displays a fatherly care toward you and you only. He leaves the room to make a five minute phone call, and returns after 5 minutes to take you to scatter your mother's ashes, and then takes you to ""tear shit up."" Now, if you actually play the game, you learn the true extent of Pagans brutality toward the followers of the Golden Path, a brutality that you learn is fueled by his hatred for its founder, your father. Pagan despises your father because he left your mother alone to start his revolution, and Pagan was in love with your mother. He took care of you and your mother until she was able to make it to the US, where you grew up. Until your return, Pagan wreaked havoc on the members of the Golden Path because, while Mojan Ghale was dead, he saw your father in each of the revolutionaries. After leaving the palace, Pagan speaks to you calmly, dismissive of your transgressions, but proceeds to get more distressed with your actions as you take out his generals one by one. He never personally attacks you, because he can't bear the thought of you, his step son, following in the footsteps of your father, the man he hated so much. He reveals that he is tired of these years of fighting, and he regrets all of the bloodshed and killing. You have the option to kill him in the end, completing the circle and following in the footsteps of your father, or sparing him, and accomplishing the task you set out to complete. If you spare him, he leaves on good terms, telling you that Kyrat is yours to do with as you please but that he's ""keeping the helicopter,"" as he flies away.  Farcry 4 is memorable to me because I can't think of a game that I've played in the past where the ""villain"" is actually more likable than the main character (at least in my opinion). I had the option to kill Pagan in the end, and I just couldn't do it. He had done so much to the people of Kyrat, and yet I felt sorry for him, because he was doing it all for you and your mother, those he cared about the most in the world."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,BoredomHeights,3,Fri Jul 10 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm  disagreeing that FC4 is a great game, because I really liked FC4 and especially Min, but I'm just curious how much people will remember 10 years from now. A truly memberable game like OP seems to be asking for should be something you can remember details of decades in the future. I loved FC4 but probably wouldn't remember much about it 10 years from now, except maybe that Min was interesting if I can even remember his name.   A game like Bioshock on the other hand I will definitely remember details of. The setting is ingrained in my memory and the twist obviously is the most memorable part. Bioshock's 6 years older than Far Cry 4 and I already feel like I can remember parts of it better."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,sEcKtUr8,2,Sat Jul 11 00:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a feeling FC4 won't be remembered, as good as it is. What it lacks, and what Bioshock has, is uniqueness. Before Bioshock and Rapture, nothing like it had been done before. It was wholly unique and original (in the realm of video games; I'm sure it had outside-the-industry inspirations). Farcry 4, on the other hand, is not as unique. It's a Farcry franchise game, for starters, and runs off a lightly enhanced Dunia engine used in FC3, so it felt very much like it's predecessor. That being said, there's really only so much a change in scenery and VAs can do to set a game aside as a classic. (Then again, Blood Dragon...)  By the way, I only mentioned FC4 because it was fresh on my mind. I was talking with a friend last night about it so I thought I'd put it here haha.  One classic I can think of that sticks with me that's older than a year is Metroid Fusion. Ho-baby that game is a wonder on the GBA."

I'm currently progressing through Xenogears, so I hope it keeps up with the great storytelling, so far it hasn't disappointed me.

That game is like clinical depression in video game form and for most first time players, it ends with you locking yourself into an unwinnable position which I think is definitely intentional.  There aren't many games that are so draining I absolutely could not bring myself to go back to them.  Another one, for very different reasons, was Ghost Trick.  Its plot is so complex and convoluted, it seems impossible that they'll be able to make a satisfying conclusion.  And yet the storyline is one of the best I've ever seen in a game and it manages to wrap up every loose end with an extremely satisfying conclusion.  I'll never understand why Capcom doesn't port it to PC, it clearly looks incredible at higher resolution if you look up the HD ios version and it has a lot of similarities to the very best games in the Point and Click adventure genre but it seems Capcom is allergic to money."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,mnemoniac,4,Fri Jul 10 20:39:12 2015 UTC,"A few come to mind, some have already been mentioned:   Homeworld 2 - It fixed the gameplay issues that detracted from raw enjoyment, but what is relevant here is how they presented the plot.  Everything, from the voice acting and music to the visuals and setup spoke of an epic scale.  Events transpiring on a stage that spans the universe, ancient secrets and legacies revealed and awakened.  It was sweeping, beautiful, tragic, and inspiring. Legacy of Kain series - A complex and subtle plot with heavy philosophical implications if you care to look.  The writers for this game did a phenomenal job weaving an amazing narrative.  Sometimes I still think about Raziel and Kain, the consequences of momentary madness, and overwhelming hubris. Final Fantasy VI - Terra is one of my favorite characters of all time, and that is because of the narrative this game weaves.  She isn't the only mover, not even the prime mover, of the game.  Her arc in the game is about despair and how love gave her purpose and hope.  But what makes FF VI amazing isn't that Terra has such an awesome arc.  It is that every character you can party with has an amazing character arc.  They all suffer, grow, and learn throughout the game and who they end as is informed by, but distinct from, who they started as. Half-Life/Portal - I mean the entire universe here.  Half Life 1, 2, and the episodes along with Portal 1 & 2 and all the events that transpire in both franchises.  The simple set stage with a single event and the incredible cascade of events that result from it.  A game that did the 'silent protagonist' thing incredibly well, and it did it by not trivializing characters or their implications.  The Vortigaunts aren't just enemies, but a race that adjusts to events.  Alyx isn't just a 'spunky action girl', but an actual mover and shaker.  The atmosphere, the character presentation, the enemies, everything is fucking awesome."

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,mnemoniac,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:04:57 2015 UTC,"God people overhype VI so much, mostly because for some reason they dislike VII. VI is no better than VII, it's got all the issues VII has in the plot department. Terra is no better of a protagonist than cloud. She spends most of the early story moping around unsure of herself and her history, and the more she learns the more she mopes and wallows in self pity. ""Will I ever be able to love, what is the purpose to life without love?"" To the point the resident edgelord (Shadow) just tells her to shut up and she'll figure it out. Imagine if Vincent (VII's resident edgelord) had said something like that in VII. But somehow Cloud gets a bad rap compared to her because he spends most of the early story moping.  And let's not get on the antagonists. Everyone praises Kefka as this mad genius, instead he's just a hackney Joker who gets a bunch of power by accident and goes insane before murdering most the world by accident, and is praised as some sort of god. Sephiroth actually has a plan and follows through with it. He wants to destroy the world for a reason, not because he thinks it'll just be fun.   VI and VII tread on many of the same plot threads. In VI Kefka is mad from the start but serves the evil empire until he sees an opportunity during the main plot of the series to seize power. In VII, the mad soldier Sephiroth already betrayed the evil empire before the beginning of the story, and our protagonist is one of the only witnesses to this event. VI and VII both have an evil empire sucking out the power of a benevolent magical force that is in turn killing the world purely for the sake of their own lust for power.   VI and VII both have threats to destroy the world - VI radically changes the surface of the world and kills a large portion of its population when its antagonist seizes power, in VII the heroes band together to stop this level of destruction from happening, but if VII's antagonist had been successful nobody would have survived (whereas in VI Kefka seemed to have some desire to rule his mostly destroyed world). Both our protagonists suffer from amnesia and their pasts are given to us as the story progresses, both are angsty for the first half of the game and slowly turn into likeable characters near the end.  Don't get me wrong: I enjoy VI (I'm doing a playthrough on twitch right now!) but it is the most overhyped Final Fantasy outside of VII. Both are imperfect, both are overrated - and I am tired of the circlejerk that VI is somehow better than VII. The only advantage VI has over VII is it was created with pixel art and has thus visually aged better than VII which is damn near unplayable in an unmodded state.   Chrono Trigger is vastly superior to everything in the Final Fantasy series, IMHO."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,theswerto,5,Sat Jul 11 04:53:34 2015 UTC,"Whoa dude, at no point in my original post did I compare VI to VII, or even mention VII.  I wrote about VI because it is a game which has stuck with me through the years, and which I remember with fondness.  I also didn't mention Kefka, nor even imply a comparison of antagonists between VI and any other game.  Nor did I mention the plot of the game.  I spoke about the characters and their development throughout the game.  I'd be happy to talk about these two games' respective strengths and weaknesses if you'd like.  Now to the 'for the record' statements:   FF VII is an amazing game, and is one of my favorite RPGS of all time. Chrono Trigger is vastly superior in the gameplay department, although I don't agree about it having a better plot.  I'd be happy to discuss this game with you too, if you'd like.

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,mnemoniac,0,Sat Jul 11 05:25:55 2015 UTC,"Whoa dude, at no point in my original post did I compare VI to VII, or even mention VII. I wrote about VI because it is a game which has stuck with me through the years, and which I remember with fondness.   Wasn't implying you did, if you read the first part of my post it is ""People overhype it"" it's just me eye rolling that once again VI comes up in a 'best stories' post.   I actually had a huge post boiling down the stories of VI and VII and how they're very similar, and how VI is just more fondly remembered by the non contrarians because of its better aging art (because pixel art > first generation 3d). Its cast was far more shallow than VII's.   Three of VI's characters (Mog, Yeti, Gogo) have practically no story behind them, two of them have very little story (Gau, Seltzer), and Shadow, Relm, and Strago only have a bit of story near the end of the game with most of the game Shadow being the resident edgelord who's too cool for school. The game mostly revolves around the stories of Terra, Locke, the twins, and Celes - most of the other characters being ultimately inconsequential to the plot.   VII on the other hand jumps deeply into each of their characters backstories. The most shallow of them is their resident edgelord, Vincent, who has most of his story still kept shrouded in mystery because he needs to be too cool for school.   VII also feels longer than VI, VI is at most a 20 hour game without grinding. VII on the other hand has far more things to do in a much larger world. VI may make itself seem like a larger world by redoing the world map at about the 80% point through the game (when the world of ruin takes over), but these aren't the locations you're running through. VII has a ridiculous amount of cities and dungeons to explore, and I found it far less of a grind to get to high levels in VII than VI (VI without using the vanish/doom exploit will require you to be at certain level thresholds for dungeons, and does very little to prepare you for these, you'll just run in and die).   I like both, but I am extremely tired of the VI circlejerk, sorry if I insinuated you were part of it.   As for why I like Chrono Trigger more than Final Fantasy, I kind of touched on it in my post before my reply"
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,body_catch_a_body,3,Sat Jul 11 05:35:25 2015 UTC,"No worries, man, I get where you're coming from.  It is part of the reason (the other being the relatively low quality of recent FFs) that I don't frequent FF boards or track recent FF games.  VII was awesome, comparison between it and VI are rarely fair.  Nostalgia is basically impossible to beat, after all.  Which is also the reason I remember VI so fondly.  It was the second Final Fantasy I played (IV was the first), and one of the first video games I played.  Memories of playing it are hopelessly intertwined with the pleasant and contented feeling of lazy summer days and the carefree days of childhood.  I admit that, and as much as I like the game, it is genuinely hard to recommend it these days.  Random encounters is a stupid system and should have been killed in the womb.  A lot of the characterization I enjoy (Gau's father, or Shadow's cutscenes for instance) is almost hidden or just hinted at.  It's easy to miss, and you're right, a lot of the plot turns on Terra, Locke, Edgar, Sabin, and Celes.  My memory of VII is a bit hazy (which is one reason I didn't bring it up), so my reply will be a bit limited.  I don't remember either game being more or less grindy, they both had their fair share of absurd stuff to do for the best items (Paladin shield?  Knights of the Round?  madness).  As for characterization, you're right, all the character got some attention (although I always though Yuffie and Cait Sith were silly) and serious development.  Vincent also has some amazing nuggets sprinkled to whet the imagination that I loved.  I read your reply to the thread too, and you make great points (Loved both the games you mention).  One thing that did kind of bug me about the game was the silent protagonist.  It can be really useful as a storytelling device in some circumstances (Half Life did a great job with it), but I don't think RPGs are one of those.  I understand the purpose of his being silent, he's suppose to be an expy for the player, to allow us to stand in bodily, but that hurts him as a character.  He was little more than a bundle of statistics and some (really bitchin') combat moves.  Which does little to detract from the overall story, which is freakin' awesome!  Generally speaking, I hate time travel stories.  Mostly because time travel seems to get thrown in to make a story 'more sci-fi-y' and the consequences aren't dealt with or explored.  Chrono Trigger is an example of an implementation done well.  The ramifications of actions are significant, it is core to the story rather than just incidental, and while the implementation may be a bit simple, the whole aspect of the game is incredibly enjoyable.  Chrono Trigger is a game I can feel comfortable recommending even now as an incredible experience.  It has crushed the test of time and emerged on the other side covered in glory.  If anyone reading this hasn't played it, do yourself a favor and go do that."

The slow acceptance of his role as a Galactic hero in the first. The twists of the second's plot, with Ratchet's growth, realizing that the world isn't so cut and dry. Then, in the Third, his return to prove his worth to his own galaxy as both a one-Lombax army and a Sergeant to the Galactic Rangers.  On top of that, Captain Qwark's arc as a repeated accidental villain, then finally learning to share the spotlight to be a real hero.  For games with such basic story tropes, they will always stick with me."
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,Mujutsu,3,Fri Jul 10 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons - Never have I been so grabbed emotionally by a game. The music, the control scheme, the visual style and the way it all wove the story together was just absolutely fantastic. The sad and somewhat desperate feel of the world worked so well tied together with the desperation of the brothers' quest to save their father so that even in the fun/funny moments there's this atmosphere that just... ugh... I don't have to words to describe how much I loved the experience I had playing through that game.  Also,  Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos/Frozen Throne - The first epic fantasy story I really experienced in a videogame. I fell in love with the world of Azeroth, the fallen prince who went mad trying to save his people, the desperate or warchief trying to lead his outcast race to salvation, and the night elves... okay I never really liked them they were a bunch of snobs but they helped Thrall and Jaina so that made them okay. Yeah I don't know what it was but something about the sheer scale of it and the various twists and turns of the plot had me hooked and made me love RTS games even though I sucked at them, also turned me into a blizzard fanboy and made me wish I could afford a WoW subscription. I think I played it at a time when I was having a hard time at school as the kid no-one liked and really related to the outcast characters (especially Illidan and Kael'thas, who where also badass as hell).   BONUS: To a much lesser extent than the above two; Star Wars Battlefront 2 - I know I know, hear me out. I had loved star wars and the whole concept of 'Order 66' because 'whoa shit the clones are the bad guys now sh*t!'. But then I was playing Battlefront 2 and you actually get to play in that army and the cinematics that wove the  whole 'shoot x and y then do this' together hit me really hard when you actually had to carry out order 66 and be part of it and it gave me a new perspective on the whole star wars franchise and got me interested in the expanded universe thus introducing me to many other stories I still love to this day."

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,DvineINFEKT,3,Sat Jul 11 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"I've gotta say that Borderlands 2, Portal (1,2), Bioshock, and Metroid Prime stand out as games I'll never forget.  Borderlands 2 here shines due to the fantastic characters, highly quotable dialogue, and music that brings it all together. The story is also very well done imo. There were actual tear jerking moments, hilarious story points, and an epic feeling of triumph abound. While I wouldn't say it is Citizen Kane, it definitely is a fantastic piece of work.  Portal and Portal 2 have such rich atmospheres. The characters are fantastic (spaaaaaaaaace), and the concept of Chel's predicament, once getting past the hilarity, is extremely unsettling. It's easy to forget that Chel is fighting against technological behemoths with god complexes, keeping her alive for either their enjoyment or pure utility. Quite disturbing, when you get down to it.  I think everyone here knows why Bioshock was fantastic, so I won't go on about it. However, Metroid Prime to this day stands as my favorite game of all time. The subtle hints at the world are what makes it; collecting all the scan data about the world and piecing together the events based on what you find. While there is no dialogue or immediate narrative, the way you learn about the game is purely extrapolative. I like to think of it as a Silent Action movie :P"
Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,MGee9,3,Sat Jul 11 02:37:12 2015 UTC,"Not so much a plot, but a single audio diary called Sad Saps from the original Bioshock (though in general that game stuck with me as well):  ""These sad saps. They come to Rapture thinking they're gonna be captains of industry, but they all forget that somebody's gotta scrub the toilets. What an angle they gave me... I hand these mugs a cot and a bowl of soup, and they give me their lives. Who needs an army when I got Fontaine's Home for the Poor?""  It stuck me with me. In a very strange way, I took a very different message out of it than what Fontaine was saying. That even in a world where everyone has the potential to be the best, you still need the ""bottom"" of society to hold up the rest of it (kind of like the angle that the TV show Dirty Jobs presents itself with). It made me really learn to take pride in the work that I do. That people will respect you more for what you do for them than for what you ask of them. That they'll give you back tenfold what you give to them.  Strange to me when you consider how cynical and conniving Frank Fontaine was in that game."

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,DerivativeMonster,3,Sat Jul 11 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm really tired of this theme in post apocalyptia. Studies have shown in disasters people put their hangups aside and actually, as groups, are pretty smart. We are, at heart, pack animals. We naturally form communities. Even in the worst cases of history marauding bands of barbarians were always a minor to moderate problem, unless it was a whole marauding culture à la the Mongols or Vikings. But even then, in general for the whole world it has never been a huge problem.   There's more, going bandit is a bad idea. When lots of people are forming small tight knit groups, they tend to be weary of outsiders. And if they aren't openly hostile to them they certainly usually respond with force if the newcomers are violent. Therefore the roving barbarians run a risk of injury or death on every raid. It's hard to keep large groups together for this purpose so they will sorely feel every loss. And they are naturally violent and apathetic, meaning infighting will be common. There's lots of reasons these groups tend to be weeded out of society. In the US, at least, it is almost impossible for groups like that to become anything more than a moderate threat in general.   I guess the story still works as allegory for today's cutthroat corporate culture. Zombie fiction specifically, you have the mindless consumer masses which are manipulated by the few with their faculties, but they are still at the mercy of the consumers and will usually stab each other in the back in order to get a leg up. Great metaphor. But if you're trying to pass off a whole world that actually dissolves into that, it strains my suspension of disbelief."

Not only was the writing and acting beyond amazing, but the ended took me totally by surprise.   There were so many clichés I was waiting for that just didn't happen.  The ending was just gut wrenching, unexpected, and perfect.

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,yukisho,2,Sat Jul 11 04:42:14 2015 UTC,"I go in this thread and I see the obvious most popular stories: Mass Effect, Final Fantasy, Star Wars, Bioshock, etc. and immediately remember that I'm somehow part of an older generation of gamers now who remembers games that are more than 10 years old (with exception to VII, which gave me a smirk at how cheesy its story is).  My answer? Chrono Trigger and Legacy of Kain.   Chrono Trigger is by far the best JRPG to ever be made. It was made by a dream team: The lead designers for both Dragon Quest (Enix) and Final Fantasy (Squaresoft) as well as the creator of Dragon Ball writing the story and designing the characters. They had a first time composer create some of the most memorable tracks in video game history, and when he was unable to finish them Nobuo Uematsu (Final Fantasy I-X) came in to finish the last few tracks for him.   But this is a thread about stories right? Well then, let's get down to Chrono Trigger's story. Without getting into spoilers Chrono Trigger was one of the first games to properly use time travel as not only a plot device, but a gameplay aspect for both solving puzzles and delivery the story in a non linear way. Chrono Trigger had 16 possible endings (17 in the DS version) most of which were difficult to achieve and are considered 'easter egg' endings due to their comedic nature. Ultimately, Chrono Trigger is your basic hero's tale, told in a fantastical world that will remind you of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Dragon Ball, thanks to its creators. I really want to go into details on why the story is so good but I cannot spoil this game for you. It is seriously one of the best games ever made and you need to play it for yourself. IF you like JRPGs or turn based games at all, you need to play this. It is on the SNES, PS1, and Nintendo DS. Pick a version - the DS and PS1 versions have animated cutscenes by the creator of DBZ and they are improved by their inclusion.   Legacy of Kain? Well it's hard to follow up that wonderful sales pitch of Chrono Trigger I just gave, isn't it? Well, Legacy of Kain is another Time Travel story, but this isn't obvious for most of the first game. Instead it sells itself as a vampire story, where time travel later becomes a plot point. Ultimately what the story becomes is a tale of two men fighting against fate, reminding me a lot of H.G. Welles The Time Machine. Each game raises the stakes and moves the plot forward, continuing with our two POV characters Kain and Raziel. Sadly, this series was never given a proper conclusion since Amy Kennig left Eidos to begin development on what would one day become Uncharted and The Last of Us - so if you enjoyed those games stories it might be worth taking a look at her previous work (though I will say for those who don't, they have very little in common with the themes of those games).  Legacy of Kain games are far from perfect mechanically. In essence they are metroidvania/zelda third person hack and slash games with vampirism being a major plot device, along with time travel. They all hold up for the most part, except Blood Omen 2 which is a bit of an odd ball out. They're all for sale on Steam, except the first game (Blood Omen). The play order is : Blood Omen, Soul Reaver, Soul Reaver 2, Blood Omen 2, Defiance."

Gaming4Gamers,3ctny0,FighterPoetThinker,2,Mon Jul 13 13:55:38 2015 UTC,Without a doubt Grim Fandango. It's probably old school for reddit but check it out if you like adventure games.   It came near the end of the point and click adventure game era which LucasArts had come to dominate with some of their classics. Tim Schafer and LucasArts perfected the genre towards the end and it will always be one of the best crime noir examples in any medium.   The game takes place in a re-imagining of the Mexican afterlife and is filled with very Tim Schafer-esque but engaging characters and a blend of Art Deco and Dia de los Muertos style.   The story follows a charismatic travel agent as he attempts to uncover why good people aren't being treated fairly in the afterlife. The story covers 4 years as the characters grow into friends and discover what it means to care about something other than themselves.   I can't suggest enough to everyone to give it a spin next time it's on sale on Steam because you'll be glad you did and start looking for people to share it with.

I have really high hopes for Yooka Laylee and Mighty No. 9. I love seeing kickstarter as an opportunity for developers to make games they want to make that fans are clamoring for. (Of course it's a pretty strong indictment of the gaming industry that someone had to create a website for fans to give developers money so they can actually make the games both fans and devs want.)  I'm excited about Star Fox Zero, but I wish I knew a little bit more about it. Same goes for Zelda U, which seems to have an incredibly strong art style this time around. Plus everything we've seen so far makes it look like this game is returning to its NES roots, so I'm expecting big things out of it."

Super challenging and super fun.  Formula Fusion - Huge fan of the wipEout series but missed out on several installments being mostly a PC gamer. What's left of the dissolved studio is making a spiritual successor (though even saying spiritual is a bit of an overstatement since they're bringing some of the same in-game teams) and it's looking pretty great.  All set for a release in some form in 2016, the wait is killer!  Also, if Star Citizen would be released sometime within the next century, I'd be super happy."

He made a great game (without kickstarter/early access) and he committed to a niche without major compromise. He beta tested the game properly. He supported the game post-launch with new and free content, and he made the title available for sales and bundles across multiple platforms.    But most importantly, he had a great product, and a stroke of luck. Ryan Davis (I miss you man) would find the game and give it the exposure it needed.   The rest is history."

Gaming4Gamers,3cq4yz,Zinski,15,Fri Jul 10 00:47:58 2015 UTC,"It is up to them but for some reason the article leaves out the big dog in the room. GameStop. GameStop has new copies of AC Unity for PS4 at $40 physica, $30 pre-owned, $60 download. GameStop would throw a fit if publishers started undercutting them by half and it remains the main place people buy physical copies."
Gaming4Gamers,3cq4yz,FadedReality,10,Fri Jul 10 02:15:19 2015 UTC,"Does Gamestop still hold that much market share? I ask because in my circles, Gamestop isn't really even a though outside of midnight releases. Almost everyone I know uses Amazon.  I'm sure Gamestop owns the under-25 crowd, but I have no idea what portion of the market that is."
Gaming4Gamers,3cq4yz,Isomodia,3,Fri Jul 10 05:31:16 2015 UTC,"I was curious if they still did so I googled around a bit and while they're not the powerhouse they were before Amazon and Gamefly they're still one of the only companies that:   straight begs you to pre-order when you go in  has a membership card that comes with a magazine increasing customer loyalty  does trade-ins, no matter how bad of a deal it is for the customer  has a huge selection of pre-owned games for the last two generations  has several TVs playing a ""show"" that is one big video game commercial looping over and over  So they do still drive a lot of the sales and excitement about video game ""culture"". That and you won't ever see publishers OR GameStop even pretend to make a move toward reducing prices without the other party agreeing because it is more profitable for both companies to shrug and blame the prevalence of physical copies for prices not going down like they do in the PC market."

It will only last for as long as physical is the dominant way to purchase games for Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Right now, when a game is available at launch as both a disc and a digital download, the physical version makes up between 80 percent to 85 percent of all sales.   It is in Ubisoft's best interest to keep retailers happy since it benefits them due to the fact that console people purchase physical copies."

It's not that Ubisoft is selfish or whatever, they explained logistically they need to provide an incentive for buying physical so they can eliminate the stock that's still left on store shelves. Otherwise retailers will be upset and start slashing their purchase orders from the game companies.  It makes perfect economic sense."
Gaming4Gamers,3cq4yz,MustBeNice,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:20:57 2015 UTC,I agree for brand new games that makes sense in a way.

Gaming4Gamers,3cq4yz,adam7684,4,Wed Jul 15 19:59:49 2015 UTC,"No, I think they have a good point about managing physical inventory.  If you sell a retailer a disc, then turn around and sell a digital copy for less-than-cost, they're not going to buy from you again.  If retailers stop buying from you, the physical market disappears (like PC games, how titles do you actually see in stores?) and gamers without fast, unlimited internet can't buy your game at all.  Obviously ""I can charge more here, so I will,"" plays into it, but there's more to the story."

Gaming4Gamers,3cq4yz,TheInvaderZim,11,Fri Jul 10 01:27:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe because when they sell to retailers they get that money from the retailer and don't have to wait for it to sell to get the money. It's a middleman, but they know they are getting paid immediately with another constant money stream rather than just a money stream."

Gaming4Gamers,3cq4yz,RiggRMortis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:26:01 2015 UTC,"That's because they are more desirable. If Steam ever shuts down suddenly, I lose all my games I purchased through them. Not so with physical media. The best option to me is a physical disc and then a digital download in addition to the disc. That way I have a physical backup and a digital backup (convenience + if my house burns down or something)."
Gaming4Gamers,3cq4yz,Wetmelon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:05:01 2015 UTC,"No. If you plan it right you are fine. Many games on steam have no DRM. You can make a copy of it and you are safe. Many others have only steamworks DRM. Valve has said that if they go under they will release all of their games without Steamworks. Of course they may not fulfill their promise. This only leaves third party drm and whether they would honor steam purchases.   Also, if anything happens, just pirate your games."
Gaming4Gamers,3cq4yz,weldawadyathink,0,Fri Jul 10 14:20:20 2015 UTC,"If Steam ever shuts down suddenly, I lose all my games I purchased through them.   Not true. Steam will unlock all games before shutting down. Additionally, you can burn backup copies via built-in menu option."

Every full retail $60 game platinum has done have been fantastic GOTY worthy games, but their half priced games have been pretty mediocre. Anarchy reigns had a painfully simple combat system with no depth to really speak of, and legend of korra had decent combat but awful pacing and pretty much everything else wasn't great. It seems like they have a B-team they hand things off to and I hope this isn't one of them, but considering they're already in the process of making two other games (one published by Microsoft and the other by Nintendo) I am remaining skeptical that this won't be half assed feeling"
Gaming4Gamers,3cq18u,Torvusil,8,Thu Jul 9 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"I was a pretty hardcore player of the beta for a while.   For the naysayers who are saying it's a Minecraft clone/cash grab:  No.   Everything in the game is user-generated content. The weapons, the dungeons, decorations, the armor, you name it. You design it, submit it to /r/trovecreations, and if it gets approved it is added to the game permenently.  There are places in the world where you can build called plots. It's like a portable house. You build your base on a plot, and any empty plot you find you can put your house on. If you want a world to build whatever you want, you make a club world, which is basically a guild hall.   As for pay-to-win, also no. You get daily quests that offer you cubits, which are used to unlock extra classes. The only pay items are aesthetic, or blocks for building. There is literally no reason to pay unless you feel like you need to look cool.   The in-game currency is called Flux, which you get from salvaging gear. This cannot be bought in the store. Flux is also used to upgrade the quality of your gear, which is why it's so valuable.   Gameplay mechanics, think Cube World if Wollay actually gave a shit. You find a dungeon, kill the baddie, grab the loot. It's an insane amount of fun with a zerg group when you roll through dungeons and demolish everything.   Give it a shot before you judge. It's definitely worth a try, especially since you don't have you pay for anything at all.   Check out /r/trove and /r/trovecreations for more info."

Gaming4Gamers,3cq18u,360_face_palm,9,Thu Jul 9 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"It's actually closer to Terraria if anything. You run through procedurally-generated zones to level up and collect gear, and along the way you can run dungeons and defeat bosses. Lots of customization, and most of the dungeons, gear, and weapons are created by the community.  The Minecrafty part comes in when your guild (club) gets their own zone, which you can customize however you want. A lot of the big towering structures in the latter part of the trailer are from club worlds. (One of which I happened to visit during the recent stress test.)  It's actually a pretty fun game!"

Gaming4Gamers,3cot9n,codewow,88,Thu Jul 9 23:42:44 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to the sale as well, but I expect alot of jewelry, exercise equipment, clocks and calculators, DVDs (but not Blu Rays), a few older multifunction printers, camping and softball equipment, and some not-so-enticing toys like those chunky ""Duplo"" type Star Wars figures.  I think Amazon means well, but it feels like it'll just be one big Gold Box/Daily Deal where there's a handful of okay things for an okay discount but the vast majority will be shit you don't want (especially jewelry) or that seem useful but have limited shelf life. I think they're going to combine a huge pile of outdated Gold Box deals into one giant sale and we'll all be scrolling endlessly through them looking for anything interesting.  Examples: a 720p only 28"" LCD TV, Madcatz Xbox 360 controllers, PS3 games from 2012 for 30% off, maybe a Wii U controller, a PS3 bundle, Star Wars Episode 1 Lego sets, off-band Blu Ray player for $50, GTX 560 video cards, paperback versions of classic novels (Catcher in the Rye, Of Mice and Men, etc), 1TB external drives (USB2 only), a low end Microsoft Surface 2, Sketchers in 2 colors but limited sizes, shovels and gardening supplies, a budget 15"" laptop with underwhelming specs for $300, some summery plastic dishes and bowls great for the outdoors, purses and handbags that you'd rather hold/see in person before buying, of course the endless jewelry, and sheets with an average thread count. The prices will entice you, and you can see yourself owning some of it, but you won't really want any of it.  Not trying to bash Amazon too much because I shop there constantly, but I have low expectations of this sale. I check Daily Deals/Gold Box all the time and see something I may kind-of-consider only once a week, but only actually buy something from that deal maybe twice a year."

I waited until a 16GB was $30 and it still feels overpriced at the time (I paid the same price for a 300GB HDD).  Personally I'm hoping some PS3 games will go on sale. Particularly Fairy Fencer F, since there's still no word on its PC release date and I already made alot of progress when I rented it before."

Gaming4Gamers,3cot9n,LupusMechanicus,-2,Thu Jul 9 19:58:26 2015 UTC,Well I'm guessing your 4TB storage drive is 5400 rpm which would be a huge difference yes but between 7200 rpm or 10000 rpm and SSD it isn't that much. Unless you are loading a whole lot of mods with whatever game you aren't going to see much of a difference except as noted above.
Gaming4Gamers,3cot9n,freelancer799,5,Thu Jul 9 20:45:30 2015 UTC,"You would be incorrect, I have a 1 TB and 3 TB both 7200 rpm, SATA 3. And in-game performance has no noticeable difference, but anything that has a visible loading sequence is noticeably faster on the SSD, even on my ""budget"" SSD.  I won't argue that for most people and most games it is not worth buying a large enough SSD to put a bunch of games on, but it is a noticeable difference between a 7200 RPM drive and an SSD."
Gaming4Gamers,3cot9n,accessgranter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"I thought you were referring to the 4TB as one drive which would be expensive to have a 7200 RPM of such, I didn't know you had both but I'm not saying it won't load faster, just saying is it worth it to use an SSD just for loadings? The only game I have problems with taking long times to load is Battlefield3/4 and those I will admit are on my SSD. Everything else still only takes a couple seconds on my 1TB 7200RPM platter drive. I'm not going to install a bunch of things to my SSD to get a second or two less for loading."

Gaming4Gamers,3cot9n,kiki_strumm3r,2,Thu Jul 9 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much my plan spot on. Though I think the most we'll get is a better add-on (instead of Unity) rather than a price reduction. Maybe I'll just buy a Kinect (if it's on sale) or something. I mean, I already made an account, and bought Killer Instinct ($80) for $32 on their 'Xbox Summer Sale' thing.  And hell, Backwards Compatibility ain't even out yet... so I can wait a bit longer."
Gaming4Gamers,3cot9n,Vanir_Islanzadi,2,Thu Jul 9 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"Backwards Compatibility is already available for members of the Preview Program. There's only like 2 dozen titles, all published by MS, but it's available. Getting into the Preview Program isn't even hard, just gotta have someone invite you. If you have an XBL Gold account (currently $30-35 on cdkeys) I'd recommend ""buying"" the Games with Gold stuff on xbox.com so you have something of a back catalog of games to play once you get it."
Gaming4Gamers,3cot9n,kiki_strumm3r,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah but essentially it's still in beta. And yeah, getting an invite might be easy, but even if you do get one, it can take MS ~2 months before they even approve it, and by that time BC will be out. When I made an MS/Xbox account, I was able to sign up for a free month of 'Gold.' So I was able to get the complete KI game/series for $32 instead of $40 on an $80 title (and I got the Fable Trilogy for $15 since it'll probably end up BC). And the only exclusive other than KI, MCC, and 360 BC's that is out that I'm interested in is Crimson Dragon, and that's not on sale. Though I have been eying cdkeys.com and saw RYSE is $15. May pick that up."

Seems to me like some people went ""It wasn't made by Rocksteady so it sucks"" and the rest just followed the herd. It's a valid entry in the series in my view."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklbv,darkpassenger9,4,Wed Jul 8 22:29:14 2015 UTC,"The main reasons lots of people hated on it was the game basically was a copy and paste of several aspects of Arkham City. For instance, it had mostly the same gadgets, and the new additions were either just new spins on old gadgets (like the glue grenade), or didn't change the gameplay in a meaningful way (like the remote claw). Lots of people thought the remote claw and the shock gloves actually made you too powerful and took all the challenge away from fights and predator stuff.  Also, the open world felt empty in a way the others didn't, and even then half of the map was a reskin of Arkham City. Not to mention the Riddler stuff in Origins was a lot more tedious, and a lot less interesting than it was in AC.  The only redeeming factor lots of people gave it was the story. It was really well written, and the VO was incredible. It wasn't Conroy or Hamill, which was another reason people were up-in-arms, but their replacements were veteran game actors, and really pulled it off IMO.  I honestly really liked the game, and I think it got more hate than it deserved. It was a very well made Batman game to me."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklbv,TheHoodedWonder,5,Thu Jul 9 02:24:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! I have to say that in my opinion, I think Conroy's best performance is in Arkham Knight. I still remember when he yelled out ""NO!"" at the end of Asylum when Gordon was about to get hit with Titan, and it was the most flat cornball delivery I have ever heard, but in this game I can think of several times he delivered his lines with feeling and conviction I haven't heard from him since Mask of the Phantasm.  The parts I can think of off the top of my head are when Batman and Robin have a very big argument in the movie studios about a very big plot point. There's also the really, in my opinion, emotional delivery in the conversations at the end of the Nightwing and Catwoman missions. Not to mention, everything that happens in the last quarter of the game.  I can see why people might think its flat delivery for some stuff. That whole, "" I'll break the other one"" line is about as cheesey as it gets in my book. It seems like every line that was in a demo of the game was meh, but everything else I think was stellar.  Also, Conroy has a few ""bat-yell"" moments in this and I think he nails them. The great thing about the Origins Batman (Roger Craig Smith), is he just spoke and got angry when it made sense, he didn't do a Nolanesque throat voice the whole time which was nice. Conroy's Batman is more seasoned so he gets phased a lot less and it makes him sound more detached, even when the shit hits the fan.  EDIT: spoiler tag didn't work, kept it very vague but untagged."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklbv,TheHoodedWonder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:36:58 2015 UTC,"As an aside, and I think this is a major sticking point for me, I also really, really like angry ""WHERE ARE THEY TELL ME BEFORE I BREAK YOUR LEGS TOO LATE THEYRE ALREADY BROKEN"" Batman   On a related note, I really liked how the first time he tried to interrogate a thug it didn't go well, and he had to escalate his scariness from then on."

Gaming4Gamers,3cklbv,donpedrox,4,Thu Jul 9 02:07:01 2015 UTC,"This DLC isn't even developed by Rocksteady, it isn't even the same studio that is working on the PC version. Likely, WB Montreal has been working on this since before the game came out, and with Rocksteady and Iron Galaxy Studios focused on the PC version they are still working away on the DLC. It seems a little silly to stop a studio who isn't even involved on the PC version from working while they fix it, especially since there are plenty of people on console playing this game and ready for more content that they paid a lot of money for.  I'm a PC gamer by the way, and I own this game on PC, and I refuse to play it until its patched, and I think the whole situation is ridiculous and shameful and if Rocksteady had been working on this DLC instead of a PC fix I'd be really pissed, but as it stands I don't think this DLC releasing on time is going to hinder progress on the fixed PC version."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklbv,Pugway,5,Thu Jul 9 07:09:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this DLC was already being worked on prior to the issues coming to light and all it needed was to sit on the dev's cutting room floor for a little bit were finishing touches before release.

FFVII had to be fixed by fan mods to make it decent and I would say the same for FFVIII. FFIV has a FPS cap and halves that during battle. so in summary yes SE is bringing games to PC but they are peppered with issues and annoyances."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklbv,donpedrox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:03:26 2015 UTC,"SE Isn't just Final Fantasy - they also own EIDOS and Crystal Dynamics old properties (Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Legacy of Kain) and thus all those games also fall under their umbrella with their recent titles (Tomb Raider reboot, Deus Ex Human Revolution, and that shitty multiplayer only Nosgoth game that runs perfectly fine but is an insult to a story-driven metroidvania series)   As for its ports: Never tried XIII on PC, I got enough of the endless push x and hold up hallways on the PS3 version and decided to never finish the game after 14 hours, let alone play it again. Didn't even give XIII-2 a shot because Square Enix hasn't put out a good final Fantasy since IX, and its last passable ones were X and XII. Their last good game made by a Japanese dev house, period, was KH2.   PC versions of VII and VIII run great, no idea what the fuck you're talking about. VII was dual launched on PC and PS1 and I still have the original PC version laying around and can compare the two readily - PC version had that whole cheat mode ported into it with the steam release, as well as a ton of other fixes, and didn't completely shut itself down from fan mods like the HD mod (which I use, thus avoiding all of square's stuff they added or removed)."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklbv,theswerto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:49:59 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy PC ports are just fine, Deus Ex Human Revolution is amazing, Tomb Raider on PC is fine, don't really have any other square games on PC that aren't pre EIDOS purchase.  Rockstar PC ports were mixed, but hardly as much of a middle finger as what Activision, Ubisoft, and WB put out 3 times a year and expect us to pay $60 each time. L.A. Noire runs fine, GTAIV didn't run fine at launch, but I didn't get it until way after launch and it runs fine now.   PC Capcom games - only ever played Super IV, which runs pretty much the same way it does on console - along with its extremely shitty netcode when compared to Third Strike Online Edition, Darkstalkers Revolution, and Killer Instinct 3 - still godlike compared to any Nethersoft fighting game's netcode."

Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,SPOOFE,3,Wed Jul 8 19:04:21 2015 UTC,I don't even bother anymore. Just go in the thread and look for either an alt link or a synopsis.
Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,ishkabibbel2000,11,Wed Jul 8 22:16:12 2015 UTC,"I can't watch the video at work,  but the article is sorta... weak.    It pretty much says that you can harvest materials from planets and then sell those materials at merchants.  OR - you can take those materials to places where that material is less prevalent and sell it for more.    It doesn't say what you can actually do with the money, how the economy changes with farming the materials, or really even what you can do with the materials.    This article was fluff at best."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,findingnemos,3,Wed Jul 8 19:11:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, the video is the same way.  It did not explain anything about the game's specific economy just how basic trading/ resource gathering works. I think the game looks really pretty and the concept is neat but I don't understand what the point of it is.  In other articles it just states that you get resources to build better ships and weapons to make it to the center of the universe to get to the ""end""."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,ishkabibbel2000,2,Wed Jul 8 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"It seems to mostly be about exploration and just roaming around finding new locales.  I believe, from what I've heard so far, it's the discovery aspect.  You get to name anything you find and create ""firsts"".  That appeals to a lot of people.  If the game goes anything beyond just that aspect, I'll be intrigued too, but I need more meat before I commit to it."

Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,AlaDouche,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:45:24 2015 UTC,"Sean Murray has repeatedly stated that there is a story (though not told in a linear form) and that the story will urge players to go to the center of the galaxy.  I am so confused as to why everyone seems to want to know the story of the game before playing it.  Maybe I'm the only one that does this, but I very rarely know the story of any game I play before playing it."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,DerivativeMonster,5,Thu Jul 9 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"I really hope this game isn't the next Spore, I want it to be good so badly."
Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,Condawg,3,Wed Jul 8 23:22:52 2015 UTC,"I think what fucked Spore is that they started out with great ambitions and decided to dumb it down for wider appeal. I can't see the devs of No Man's Sky doing anything of the sort. They also haven't been over-promising like Peter Molyneux, just stating what they're showing and showing it. I think the only thing that could make this game disappointing is it being over-hyped, which is nobody's fault but ours. (That is, assuming the game itself isn't broken.)"
Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,Call_erv_duty,2,Thu Jul 9 06:24:42 2015 UTC,So is this an exclusive for PS4? Kinda want to play but I'm not buying a PS4 for it.

Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,tobiasvl,6,Wed Jul 8 19:43:16 2015 UTC,"Just so it's clear, the game might be a timed console exclusive for PS4 (that is, that it might be coming to Xbox One some time in the future), but that's neither been confirmed nor denied.  However, it will come out to PC the same day it comes out for PS4."

Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,enemycowman,2,Wed Jul 8 22:13:16 2015 UTC,I'm really not sure whether I should be super hyped or a little wary of this game. The gameplay just seems very disengaging.
Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,Nyctor,2,Thu Jul 9 15:20:47 2015 UTC,"I'm worried that we'll all quickly discover that it's a big disjointed mess. I mean, yeah, it's got scope, random worlds, space combat, destructible worlds, and just about anything else you could hope for.   But...does it have coherent progression? Does it motivate the player to continue on like WoW or Diablo does with addictive loot systems? Does it motivate hours upon hours of world exploration? If not then it's kinda pointless after the initial wow factor."

Gaming4Gamers,3cklj4,enemycowman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:36:41 2015 UTC,Even with the system where you can save your discoveries seems like it would become stale very quickly.
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,Torvusil,6,Wed Jul 8 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"I am super hyped for this game, but I really dislike the flying blast arm. Like, how did that not trigger the alarm? It's a slow-moving rocket just whizzing its way through the base, and not a single soldier sees/hears it?  And don't give me the ""MGS is already ridiculous"" spiel."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,Juandolar,5,Wed Jul 8 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"It's a gameplay demo, the difficulty was toned down a lot so people can focus on features rather than alarms. A few people played the demo at e3 on /r/metalgearsolid and said enemy accuracy and ai was turned down a lot from how it was in gz, just part of it being a demo."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,titanhermant,2,Wed Jul 8 23:54:42 2015 UTC,"Oh! That makes sense! Yeah, everyone knows about how alarms work in Metal Gear Solid, but that rocket arm is definitely a new feature. Good point!"
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,Juandolar,2,Thu Jul 9 00:09:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah the arm itself is new, for obvious reasons lol, but it's pretty much just a different version of the Nikita missle"
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,titanhermant,2,Thu Jul 9 00:19:06 2015 UTC,"Its not even the first Blast Arm in Metal Gear, Zadornov did the same thing in Peace Walker.  I do agree though, I hope that that was just for the purpose of demonstration and that it'll be harder to use effectively in game, thats how I've felt about a lot of these videos, I love the possibilities they show but they've been making the game look really easy."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,KotakuSucks2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:05:47 2015 UTC,"Too true. I'm probably just going to try to non-lethal infiltration for each mission, because I've found that I love stealth in video games. Good thing MGS has that figured out."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,Juandolar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:10:10 2015 UTC,Non-lethal is always fun but one of my favorite things in GZ was replaying missions and trying out different approaches both in terms of route and equipment.  Its just as fun to wreak havoc and terrify the guards as it is to get in and out without anyone noticing.
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,KotakuSucks2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"Heheh... Truthfully, when I first tried a friend's GZ, I went around, stealthily interrogating and then assassinating every single guard. Imagine my dismay when actually entering the compound and discovering that I had more guards to deal with, after clearing out the entire prison camp."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,Juandolar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:16:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know, man. I've gone non-lethal in every single MGS game ever made but those bastards are going to suffer for what they've done to Motherbase and all my comrades. I will spiral into madness along with Big Boss and I shall reach that Hell. I shall reach Outer Heaven."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,corruptsoul98,2,Thu Jul 9 02:06:57 2015 UTC,I'm cautiously optimistic for this game. Something about combining open-world and Metal Gear rubs me the wrong way.
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,JOJOBASS,2,Wed Jul 8 20:07:27 2015 UTC,"My only concern about the open-world is that I do not know what I'll even do with it. I feel slightly overwhelmed by all the things you can do in the Witcher 3, but that is fantasy game filled with a large variety of side-quests, etc. I haven't been keeping up too much with the Phantom Pain, but I'm still optimistic that it will all work out."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,Juandolar,2,Wed Jul 8 20:11:03 2015 UTC,"I think the key for huge games like Witcher 3 is to set small goals and work your way from there. If you zoom out and look at all of the ""?"" symbols on the map at once, you'll get overwhelmed and frustrated. I find that I will just meander around to the ones that I near me and knock a few off in a session. It will probably take me a few months to beat the game this way, but I'll enjoy every minute of it.  My biggest concern with MGSV is that I will be too burnt out on open-world stuff by the time it arrives. I want to give myself some time to relax and get ready for Fallout 4. I fear that the last thing I will want to do is jump into MGSV and play it right up to FO4's release."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,JOJOBASS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, I hadn't even thought of that. I've recently gotten back into the Witcher 3, because I burned myself out on EU4. With all the (hopefully good/great) open-world titles coming out in the next couple of months, getting burnt out would be horrible."

Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,Raven-The-Sixth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:13:04 2015 UTC,September can not come soon enough.  I hope the game has hard mode like GZ did though cause all the gameplay videos have been making it look a little too easy.  GZ on hard was great.
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,KotakuSucks2,-2,Wed Jul 8 21:41:48 2015 UTC,Good god that female team member just looks ridiculous. :/
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,Antikas-Karios,4,Wed Jul 8 20:52:59 2015 UTC,Why does anyone even care? Just enjoy the character design for what it is. MGS has had a lot of ridiculous outfits over the years. Nobody complained about them. Stop trying to make something out of nothing.
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,TheCodexx,3,Thu Jul 9 00:21:37 2015 UTC,"Ridiculous was probably a poor choice in words on my part, I used the term in a way that it is not normally used, in this specific instance I meant ridiculous as in ""bad"", not silly(though it is that), not unrealistic(though it is that as well), not impractical(though it is definitely that too) not offensive/demeaning(though I could see how it could be argued so) I'm saying it's just plain old shitty.   So why do I care if there are shitty designs in games? Well that's a pretty normal thing to care about, I kind of prefer it when designs in games I am interested in are good. For reasons I assume are obvious."

Besides that, in the context of this and all the other games, how is this one character wearing a bikini sexist when a vast majority of their overly sexualized characters are men? Honestly I think it's more a problem that it's considered sexist to have a female character being presented in a ""sexual"" manner when just about every other male character in the series has been sexualized in one way or another."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,titanhermant,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:04:55 2015 UTC,"There is apparently some story reason on why she is dressed that way. Kojima calls it the ""antithesis of a typical female video game character. Whether that holds is yet to be seen."

Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,flashmedallion,-2,Thu Jul 9 02:47:19 2015 UTC,"This isn't even a metal gear solid game anymore. I don't see any of the aspects of the previous games in this. This is an open world multi approach and freeform mission type of game - whereas the first two MGS games were kind of like a stealth-based metroidvania game, the third got more linear, and the fourth got rid of any semblance of exploration. This has gone in the complete opposite direction.  I dunno, it looks fun, but this doesn't scream 'metal gear solid' to me - it screams mercenaries."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,theswerto,2,Wed Jul 8 22:46:26 2015 UTC,I take it you never played Peace Walker?
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,titanhermant,0,Wed Jul 8 23:57:58 2015 UTC,"Never owned a PSP, but if that's what peacewalker is like it isn't a Metal Gear game either."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,theswerto,3,Thu Jul 9 01:32:05 2015 UTC,It's on ps3 and 360 too. If a metal gear game isn't like a metal gear game then what is?
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,titanhermant,0,Thu Jul 9 01:41:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know, like I said it's more like mercenaries than the previous Metal Gear Solid games. Open world was never their schtick. Have you even played the first two? You can't tell me they're anything like this."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,theswerto,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"I've played every single one of them, it's my favorite series. Every game has also been drastically different from the previous game. Are you talking MG1 and MG2, or MGS1 and MGS2? You could say the same about there being a camo index in 3, or the tps over the shoulder view in 4, or the non isometric camera being used at all. Every game builds upon the previous and makes tweaks, generally for the better. It has most of the iconic metal gear solid things like explanation points, and the sense of humor. You're seeing a new game made in a new generation, I would expect for and hope they would try and do something different."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,titanhermant,0,Thu Jul 9 06:00:37 2015 UTC,"A ! Does not make Metal Gear solid.  The first two were 3d metroidvania games. You got threw into a huge level and told to explore. You'd get tools to open certain areas and progress. You'd have interesting boss fights and dialogue that split up the exploration.  MGS3 got rid of the metroidvania and made it linear, there was very little backtracking in that game.  MGS4 just gave us an over the shoulder camera view, which really wasn't a massive chagne.  This? This isn't anything like metroidvania at all. This is a huge open world.   It's not a bad thing.  But do not tell me this is Metal Gear Solid. It isn't."
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,theswerto,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:10:28 2015 UTC,It says right in the title screen it is metal gear solid.
Gaming4Gamers,3ckl62,PaleWolf,0,Thu Jul 9 07:20:04 2015 UTC,"You can look at it as being whatever you want, what you identify as qualities for a game to resemble mgs are likely nothing alike the majority of other players. While it's different I find it ironic you're  saying that metroidvania is somehow not open world, even though that's what it is. I'd hardly even say they're close to metroidvanias, they're still pretty damn linear with 2 being probably the least of the 4. This is, in fact, a metal gear solid game. It is using features present in two previous games and refining them. What makes mgs what it is is not how linear or open the levels are designed, while an exclamation point does not make it metal gear solid it is one of the characteristics that separate it from many other games. If mgs didn't have it's quirkiness and over the top anime-esque story it would be generic and comparable to something like splinter cell. You're judging a game for not being like mgs without actually having played them all, or the game that this is a sequel to and the game that is a sequel to. Just like how ""war has changed"", mgs is constantly changing and evolving over time. If you'd rather play a game series that is stagnating and not trying anything new, then I invite you to go play some of the many other modern game series, I hear there's another new assassin's creed.  I don't see the problem with ingenuity. It's different, get over it. If you'd like to tell Kojima he doesn't know how to make a mgs game aka his own series, then don't play it."

Gaming4Gamers,3cl6xu,gianttabby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"Some of the terminology from mgs has been relevant to real life. Various concepts such as nuclear deterrence were explained more thoroughly, or real life groups such as GRU or seal team six were first brought to my attention by those games. In the same vein, I think a lot of people's military knowledge comes from games. While it is generally pretty inaccurate in specifics it can present old information in a new way so you can kinda learn without noticing it, like all those old ww2 games. Oddly enough I think people reflect the quality of guns irl to the quality of the guns in a video game, let alone that many people wouldn't have had a name for many guns or military equipment if not for them. I'm sure cars in racing games are treated in a similar fashion. While playing a racing game won't teach you how to fix a car, you can learn some things about cars (depending on how simmy it is) like what turbos are and what an apex is.  I'm not sure if that's exactly what you're talking about, but that's the best I could think of"

I know it's been said to death, but this game's just so much fun! I love how fluidly the FLUDD controls work with classic Mario platforming and even moreso I love the puzzles and challening Secret levels.  I think the only true gripe I have seems to be pretty popular: the camera has killed me and hampered my puzzling/platforming skills more than my incompetence. This along with some truly wonky missions (that goddamn watermelon, the roller coaster balloons) make for a lot more frustration than I expected.

Everything else was great though. Some of the levels are just massive. It was quite remarkable.   Tribes: Vengeance (2004)  I've never been a hardcore Tribes guy, but something about a singleplayer campaign of it always intrigued me. Ken Levine writing it helps too. The story was pretty good, and the missions were mostly pretty good. However, you could tell it was hard to make a campaign out of a MP shooter like Tribes. A lot of the objectives were ""capture x point like you're playing multiplayer."" I enjoyed it though. The story was good enough to keep me through to the end.  Star Wars: Republic Commando (2005)  It's a decent FPS. It's got Terra Nova squad stuff, but it's very limited. The story is throwaway Star Wars lore-building. Enemies were a bit too spongy, had they not been, I might have enjoyed it a lot more. It was as I said, decent.  Shogo: Mobile Armor Division (1998)  Shogo is a lot different than other shooters of the era. It was very much a part of the FPS breaking out of that Doom/Quake mold. Enemies died quick, and you died just as quick. It's also got a bit of Titanfall in it. The levels were separate, but you'd run around a cityscape in a giant mech, and then arrive at a mission that required you to be on foot inside a building. Most good.  Tron 2.0 (2003)  Another Monolith game. I didn't like as much as Shogo, but it was neat. It had a really interesting progression and corruption systems. It was tedious at times though. Perks could be corrupted, so you would have to cleanse them to make the most out of them. It wasn't a very action driven game, and more ""run through this area until you reach the end, you might see a guy on the way"" They didn't really give you many weapons up front so that's probably why the latter levels actually had enemies. It was a decent time regardless.   Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri (1996)  What a game. Controls take some getting used to, but man, Looking Glass was out of control. This is a sort of precursor to Tribes I'm sure. Massive environments and power armor. It's also got Syndicate style squadmates (which I mentioned Republic Commando takes after as well) and you can customize their loadouts every mission. You can tell them to plant demo charges, rewire turrets and all sorts of stuff. The story isn't bad for a FPS in 1996 (Duke Nukem, Quake) either, but it is told through silly 90s FMV. Quite surprised at how playable I found it, and while it probably isn't for everyone, it's my favorite of this lot."

I also am a programmer and I thoroughly enjoyed the terrible puns. ;)  Also, Shogo had a mod back in the day (I think it was called ""Squishy"") that pitted the giant robots vs humans in PvP.  Was a lot of fun and as close to Titanfall as anyone got before, well, Titanfall."

Been running around, doing various glitches for fun, and trying to find consistent setups for newbies like me. I've successfully bottle duped accidentally way too much, and now I have like 9 bottles on my 100% file. Guess it's time to do another 100% playthrough. :/    I think I might have found a newbie-friendly way to setup 1-bomb superslides and the WESS to Kakariko from Zora's River. And possibly one for Tektite hover to the Fishing Pond, and one for Gold Skulltula hover in Deku Tree that doesn't use megaflip.       Also! More Super Meat Boy!  Apparently I like a challenge. So far, I'm in Dark Hell and have 106%-ed everything so far. All bandages, all warp zones, all Glitch Girl, and because I'm insane and it's not required for completion, all A-ranks. And I've only died 3000 times! Another game I might pick up for speedrunning (already done individual world attempts).       More? Yes, PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+!  I've always been pretty good at this game, being top-100 for a lot of levels. But now, I'm making the push for Highway 2 Time Attack WR. Currently, my buddy nahucirujano has it. I saw how my routing fucked up, immediately did another attempt, sucked , but then moved to top-30. I was on WR pace, but I had the biggest fuck up ever at the end that cost 6 seconds. Well, time for the grindfest.      And, like always, some Tetris The Grand Master!  More Gm attempts. But mostly, I've been working on a new TAS with a strat that could make sub-8 minute GM easily possible. Impossible in real-time, but frame-perfect clever abuse of wall kicks are always fun."

Gaming4Gamers,3cj51k,gianttabby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"Because Steam has been getting progressively shitter over the last 3 years with Early access becoming a thing, their customer service is a complete joke and always has been, requiring you to email the CEO if you want anything to get done, the paid mods debacle showed us they are out to fleece gamers wherever they can and I don't forget as easily as everyone else seems to, they made over $100M in the international last year yet it's still very common for Dota servers to crash and they still charged full price for the Arcana everyone with a compendium voted for which in my opinion should have been free for compendium owners.  The only positive thing Valve has done with Steam in recent memory apart from release other companies games is the refunds system which is still just a shitty automated check against two parameters and doesn't work retroactively so I can't get a refund for that game I wasted £15 on last year and played 20 mins of because its not to my taste.  I'm using Steam simply because 1) Dota and 2) Most games bought elsewhere activate on Steam. I'm not actively supporting it by buying my games off other sites and not buying cosmetics and shit for Dota which I spent a lot of money on in the past and keeping my fingers crossed that a valid contender rises up to make Valve re think their lackluster attitude, hopefully GoG Galaxy."

Such a fucking fantastic game, but I enjoy cruising around the city a lot more than actually competing in events. Finding all of the jumps and billboards is really satisfying. The eight ending points all seem interesting in theory, but it usually leads to me just taking the same paths to finish. The Stunt events usually just lead to looking for the one obvious path with a lot of jumps. Takedown events are great, though.  I bought Syndicate during the Xbox sale last week. It's interesting, but not exactly what I would call good. It also gave me a headache while playing, so there's that.  My fiancee and I have been playing a bit of Peggle 2. I feel like the game is a lot more spartan than the previous Peggle, but we're still enjoying it. She's just now trying to get all of the challenges beaten.  I'm still playing Dragon Quest IX.

I made the decision to get it on my PS3, thinking that a horror game would be better on a big screen, and I'm not sure if I made the right decision. I have no problem with the graphics, but the frame rate has tanked in a few areas. In one case it was when the alien was killing some people and it just ruined the fear and immersion.

Okay, maybe that's blasphemous, but I can certainly say Blast Corps held up better than everything else on N64 and would be my current favorite N64 game.  Either way, that game is nearly fucking perfect and it's uncanny how that design was never ONCE imitated in any game I've ever seen.  The game was so much fun and managed to pull off a feat that is all but impossible these days: it made me truly care about score attack.  1080 snowboarding also had this effect on me, but I almost feel like that was out of sheer luck where Blast Corps is still a perfect representation of my nostalgia every time I boot it up in an emulator.  Seriously, only this game and MGS1 actually live up to my biased nostalgic memories, and retain their perfection through time.  Yes I just put Blast Corps on a pedestal alone with Metal Gear Solid.    Blast Corps is truly an original gem and I still pray that one day Rare will pull their head out of their asses and make a sequel."

It's that organic mission development and set-your-own goals that they keep talking about, but this is the first time I really believed it.  And it still feels like MGS the entire time.

Gaming4Gamers,3cghd4,Professorjack88,6,Tue Jul 7 18:51:47 2015 UTC,"Both are very similar, except ARK has dinosaurs.  If you want more PvE, play ARK on a PvE server.  I don't think Rust has PvE servers, but you could easily just play on a low-population server.  Rust is a shoot-on-sight game until you have a group of friends.  But it's also a little more polished than ARK.  I found ARK feels a little ""grindy"" where you're constantly trying to gather resources.  Rust seems to make the resources last a bit longer so you can focus more on building/crafting/killing.  I think I prefer Rust, but I think you would probably prefer ARK for the PvE."
Gaming4Gamers,3cghd4,Xevo,3,Tue Jul 7 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"I've never played Rust, so it will be hard to weigh in there, but I have enjoyed ARK quite a bit so far.  I play on a PVP server, and so far, almost everyone I've run into has been very friendly over voice chat, just saying hello, or even offering some gear.  That said, you will still log in to find your things decimated if you haven't hidden your house (on a pvp server).  There are pve servers where players can't damage other players or their property.    Ark's optimization hasn't been great so far, so I'm not sure how well it will run on mid level, but they've added plenty of low quality options to the launcher, so you should at least be able to play it."

Gaming4Gamers,3cgvz4,58time,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"As a more serious answer, it looks to have it's own niche in a smooth, cartoony style that we haven't really seen in a big budget shooter since TF2. Look at the explosions, and the texture design. Lots of bright colors and simple shapes, without the sharp edges or stressful details of many games today.  Gameplay wise, it looks to try it's own take on class based combat, with every experience doing something different and a lot of niche mastery and strategy for each specific character. That said, it seems like they're kinda shooting themselves in the foot in showcasing the design, what with virtually every scene seeming more like a TDM clusterfuck than anything resembling tactical combat."

Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,Throwaway_4_opinions,44,Mon Jul 6 15:29:28 2015 UTC,"I never liked their peripherals as they weren't very nice quality, but then again they were always relatively cheap.  Not everyone can afford the higher end stuff so they fill a particular need within the peripheral market.  Would be sad to see them go as I'm sure there are many out there that rely on cheap controller and other peripheral alternatives."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,starryeyedsky,24,Mon Jul 6 16:06:16 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I've worked retail in the past selling video games and electronics. 9/10 times when a kid comes in with their parent they're getting an off brand controller. The parent sees the price of the 1st party controller and says no to it. Then they end up with a mad catz item. For a lot of people it's the only affordable controller and I really hope that they don't get under. They do provide a valuable product to a  lot of consumers.
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,DrStephenFalken,8,Mon Jul 6 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"Any idea how well their controllers held up to 1st party products?  Does it just feel cheaper, or does it actually give out far sooner than the other alternatives?"
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,vilezoidberg,23,Mon Jul 6 19:24:29 2015 UTC,"In my experience, anything madcatz has been broken in a very short amount of time. It may fill a role in being cheap, but for me the product is just too cheap in quality to justify even at a marked down price."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,Jocavo,7,Mon Jul 6 19:41:43 2015 UTC,"i dunno if this is an exception, but i still use a matcatz gamecube memory card that i got over 10 years ago.  i used it with my gamecube for its lifespan and currently i use it with the wii that i bought on release week in 2006.  still saves my games fine."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,race_in,5,Mon Jul 6 23:03:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all but one of my four madcatz memory cards are still in working condition. Unfortunately the same can not be said for my four madcatz GameCube controllers I had."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,zaphod100,3,Mon Jul 6 23:32:29 2015 UTC,Though for a lot of people (like me back in the day) they bought a madcatz cheap GameCube controller so there would be an extra one on he rare occasion a friend would be over to play.  I was in college at the time so I didn't have a whole lot of free time.  That madcatz controller never got used otherwise. Always used first party controllers for my own solo gaming.  Never expected the cheap one to survive long under normal use.
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,starryeyedsky,8,Tue Jul 7 04:52:13 2015 UTC,It may fill a role in being cheap   I haven't bought a Mad Catz product since the 90s so I visited their website out of curiosity...all of their products are as expensive or more than the first party alternative. They still want $50 for a 360 controller. Most of their catalog now is $300 head sets and PC controllers.   Seems like they're just shit all around
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,non_troppo,3,Mon Jul 6 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"Huh, that is a very new thing.  Just a year or two ago they were still selling their cheap 360 and PS3 controllers.  If I had to guess the newest console generation has not been kind to them.  Thus an already troubled company making an announcement like this."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,starryeyedsky,5,Tue Jul 7 05:04:49 2015 UTC,"They felt cheap, looked cheap, and broke quickly in my experience. But at the same time, they were and are far cheaper than brand name stuff.   Some of their stuff has lasted years for me without every day use. As a guest controller they work great, but I'd never buy one to replace my main controller."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,RiggRMortis,4,Mon Jul 6 20:59:31 2015 UTC,Both. They always felt off and never lasted anywhere near as long.

I think the most significant aspect of their departure will be that kids don't have to put up with having shitty controllers because their parents went straight for the cheapest with no regard for quality."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,Zarokima,4,Mon Jul 6 21:06:29 2015 UTC,"I live and worked in a low income area at the time. Some times it was because the parent didn't know any better. I would explain to every customer the difference. It didn't matter for the most part. A lot of the time Mad Catz wasn't the cheapest, there was always some unheard of brand cheaper controller made in an oddball manner. However, they would opt for the $5 or $10 more expensive Mad Catz item because it has better name recognition.  It was case by case but the name has recognition and back then Mad Catz was advertising in GamePro and all the other gaming mags."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,DrStephenFalken,-2,Mon Jul 6 21:52:17 2015 UTC,Not having madcatz will save people from buying shitty controllers

Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,starryeyedsky,16,Tue Jul 7 05:08:40 2015 UTC,"I bought MadCatz stuff because of local multiplayer. It wasn't worth investing in 4 official Xbox controllers for the twice a month there would be 4 player split screen. Even less so because friends who had an Xbox just brought their controllers over.  Now with so many games having only online multiplayer I never find the need to have lots of controllers. All of my split screen multiplayer is PS2/Xbox/Gamecube generation and back, and by now all the official controllers are super cheap and I almost never need to replace them because they're much higher quality than MadCatz.   For me at least, the time when cheap secondary controllers were needed has passed. Unless the controllers they put out start being better then what console producers put out, many people no longer need them."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,data_double,8,Mon Jul 6 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"And they don't look like they ever will be. Even Logitech and Razer, respected names in PC peripherals, have consistently made underwhelming controllers."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,kkjdroid,3,Mon Jul 6 19:37:13 2015 UTC,"Now that I've though about it a bit, I even liked Razer's ""Sabertooth"" controller, but even still I see no reason to ever buy one. I'm typing this on a Razer keyboard, and cliking ""save"" with a Razer mouse, but I am already so used to the 360 controller that I see no reason to switch. There's no reason it's a better piece of hardware that I can think of, and I already know the 360 controller works well for me. It's such a hard market to penetrate I don't see it working anymore"
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,data_double,7,Mon Jul 6 20:12:21 2015 UTC,Add that to the fact that the Sabertooth is $67 to a wireless 360 pad's $33 or a wired one's $28 and the fact that Razer apparently has no QC whatsoever and you really have no incentive to get anything but first-party.
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,kkjdroid,6,Mon Jul 6 20:29:04 2015 UTC,I've never been a fan of their noon musical peripherals but loved the Rock Band controllers. Way better than Red Octane.

The next day I wore red wool gloves I found in the coat closet to keep playing, but it was so hot that I developed hives and was miserable. I kept playing anyways. I think if it wasn't for that wheel, I wouldn't have developed the passion for racing/ engineering that I have today. Thank you, MadCatz"

Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,mfdoll,10,Tue Jul 7 13:53:45 2015 UTC,"Quite a shame considering how well they did with fight sticks last generation. Really good stuff there.   I know a lot of people hate on their controllers, but shitty 3rd party controllers are one of the few ways that third party accessory makers can actually make any money. If you make a controller that you have to charge the same (or more!) amount for as the first party controllers, your market is limited. Unless your controller offers something that the first party controllers don't (while still being high quality overall), people won't buy it. So accessory makers can make new headsets, peripherals that aren't made first party (fight sticks, racing wheels), but the only time I can think of a third party controller actually selling well were the wireless Logitech ones fro Xbox and PS2 (and those were officially licensed).   I'm not defending the quality of their controllers, mind you. But understand that since it's almost impossible for these companies to make a quality product that will sell due to how the market works, they have to go after a different part of the market. Those terrible controllers aren't for you. They are for the guy that breaks a controller in frustration every other week. They are for parents who know their kids will end up spilling kool aid on the controller withing a month. They are for people who know that the dog is going to end up chewing the analog sticks off."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,nstern2,4,Mon Jul 6 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"I will defend their fight sticks and pads.  Besides a DIY option they are pretty much the best option for fight game fans.  They use authentic sanwa parts in them, which you would also find in an actual arcade.  Well worth the price.  They also have great PC support.  Can't say enough about them."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,mfdoll,2,Tue Jul 7 01:16:05 2015 UTC,"Same here. I own 3 of them myself actually. And since they made them easily modable, two of mine have custom art. You mentioned good PC support, did they ever get the PS3 fight sticks working properly on PCs? Mine never worked, so I use an PSX stick for playing on PC."

Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,AkiraZXE,2,Mon Jul 6 20:26:35 2015 UTC,"That's too bad. I heard their controllers had issues, but I had a Gamecube Microcon that I used until...hell, a few years ago really. That thing saw some serious use before one of the buttons started to fuck up. I also have a wireless one, though it's a little silly due to an accident not long after I got it. Never start fucking with somebody holding a controller, they might fling it out of reflex, which is what happened. Fucking asshole never replaced it... Anyways, they both had a far more comfortable grip than the first-party controllers for my hands, and the wireless one especially due to that gel grip it had.  Those mice they're making look like godawful disasters though, so I can't say I'm surprised they're bombing. Guess that's what happens when you don't try to find weaknesses in first-party controllers to exploit in your own designs and instead try to make these tacticool mice."

But they really do need to step up their game, a lot of their problem are their fault."
Gaming4Gamers,3cb78g,madcap462,2,Tue Jul 7 01:53:02 2015 UTC,One point I don't think anyone has brought up is that having third party controllers probably keeps the cost of the official controllers down.

Gaming4Gamers,3c778f,UnclaimedUsername,2,Tue Jul 7 21:33:58 2015 UTC,The most important entry in the series!
Gaming4Gamers,3c778f,obsidianchao,7,Sun Jul 5 22:47:39 2015 UTC,Big fan of the series. I loved doom 3 from start to finish when it was originally released. I started reading stuff about it after i played it through it and was surprised of all the negativity.
Gaming4Gamers,3c778f,A_Light_Spark,4,Sun Jul 5 17:49:56 2015 UTC,"Me too, I thought it was great. I guess people didn't like the departure from the original, but taken on its own it was really good."
Gaming4Gamers,3c778f,TheCrimsonEscapade,2,Mon Jul 6 01:56:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly the flashlight is what pissed a ton of people off (thank you based duct tape mod), and the departure from the game's roots into a horror title. Was still a good game at the time, and the graphical advancements were fucking superb."

Gaming4Gamers,3c8iko,LuvList,2,Mon Jul 6 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"Do you want something you can play ""With"" her, or an actual co-op game. Puzzle games are good since you can both throw out ideas. Portal, Space Chem, Portal 2, Braid.  There are also some co-op puzzle games like Trine and Battle Block Theater and Portal 2.   As far as stories go Alan Wake is amazing. LA Noir also fits the ""walk around, solve shit"" aspect."
Gaming4Gamers,3c8iko,AustinYQM,2,Mon Jul 6 02:46:36 2015 UTC,"Trine 2. Looks gorgeous and has a good narrator. Trine 1 and 2 have local co op (has to be played on same computer), Trine 2 has online co op."

Dreamfall: the longest journey and dreamfall chapters are good (the original the longest journey is solid too but hasn't aged too well visually so you might not want to play it due to age)  Any of the monkey island games are still great fun.  Fahrenheit (indigo prophecy in the US) is also great if you can get past the awful QTEs, the game should definitely be played on easy though.  The walking dead and the wolf among us would also fit the bill.  Can't think of any more right now but I'll add them if I do.  Edit: myst maybe? Very puzzle heavy though."
Gaming4Gamers,3c8iko,bennyd63,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:07:01 2015 UTC,"Myst and Riven are very rewarding puzzle games but may look a little dated now.  There is still a lot of magic in the graphics despite that.  Very interesting and deep storyline.  I think there are about 5 installments now.    Octodad - Dadliest Catch is really good fun.  Light hearted, very funny.  Proffesor Layton puzzle games are also good.  Games my girlfriend likes watching - Black Flag, LA Noire, Last of Us"

Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,Safros,12,Sun Jul 5 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"To me halo is a hard game to recapture the magic of the first game. It was a product of it's time, and it's core mechanics were born from the game being console tailored. It's the reason why you have regenerating health and two weapons to switch to in a lot of modern games. In many ways I think it has a novelty to it the same way other classics did. It seemed to master the mechanics despite them being in their infancy.   So in many ways making the sequels ever since has been an attempt to recapture that magic, and to reinvent it at the same time. I think it can mechanically speaking, the major changes have been the polish and technical advances made, but the platform is still nearly identical (Controllers haven't changed much). On the other hand I still feel the problem is the usual suspects to development disasters. A rushed product. Especially when you have a successful franchise, it's important not to rush things I'll say it until I am blue in the face, pass out, and repeat. You will not have to worry about the sales if you take your time making something great. Still with Halo, that's not the only problem. I think part of it's issue is trying to maintain it's own identity when there is the constant temptation to imitate other games."
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,Throwaway_4_opinions,4,Sun Jul 5 17:05:13 2015 UTC,"Very accurate description.   For me, Halo CE was this super cool vast world of awesome guns and vehichles; but i only played it here and there at a cousins house or a friends house.   Halo 2 brought the multiplayer and the best weapon in gaming history, the BR, and all in all was indeed superior to Halo CE(albeit with a bit less of the original awe).   Halo 3 brought literally everything you could want into a Halo game and made it perfect. In my eyes, Halo 3 is the rare case of a perfect game, and it's my favorite game of all time. Also had the best maps."
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,FelixTheNomad,2,Mon Jul 6 01:41:39 2015 UTC,"Dude the best weapon is the railgun from quake, but that's another discussion entirely"
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,poomcgoo8,4,Tue Jul 7 20:41:49 2015 UTC,I will be buying it for the story; I feel every game after 3 just felt less like halo and more like COD. In reach they added classes and sprinting and now we have jetpacks and loadouts. The multiplayer is garbage now in my opinion but I have always enjoyed the story and i strongly believe they will deliver this time around. The only problem I have is (I'm not sure if its a rumor) the no more splitscreen multiplayer. Halo has been the couch co-op go to ever since H1 came out and I will be very upset If we lose split screen.
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,solidliquidsnake,3,Mon Jul 6 02:03:06 2015 UTC,"For me Halo has almost always been one of those series where the majority of the advertising goes into promoting the campaign, but the majority of the development effort and care go into the multiplayer. Halo has been getting better about this lately in my opinion (and of course Call of Duty is still the biggest offender), but I'm still wary of it. It feels rather disingenuous to me, like they're trying to suck in people mainly interested in the campaign through adds, but they already know the people who want it for the multiplayer will buy it anyway.  Long story short, I have a feeling the reception will be similar to Halo 4. People are going to be very divided on both the campaign and the multiplayer. Any changes made to either are going to displease some people, as is inevitable in the gaming scene. In terms of the campaign at least, they've been building up to something absolutely gigantic, and I can't help but feel that they simply won't be able to deliver on it."
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,pickelsurprise,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"First let me say, great name. Now I have to watch the video.  Second, I agree that they have been better lately. I remember in Reach when you first get into the Warthog and you drive out onto that cliff edge and I was blown away by how beautiful it looked. I love cinematic scenes like that more than cutscenes so I am hoping they do more of that. Multiplayer has always been #2 in my book, not to say I dont like it but I always hope that they put more into the campaign like they did Halo CE."
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,SpiveyArms,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:42:28 2015 UTC,I only get on halo multiplayer a couple times a year. For me all I care about is the campaign. I read the books and the lore is what drew me into halo.
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,righteoustrent,3,Sun Jul 5 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm very excited. My first real PC game eons ago was Halo CE. Even though the sequels were great, they never gave me the same sense of...mystery that the original gave me. That being said, I've found myself loving the sequels, especially Halo 3 and ODST. The plots did at least have a sense of scale like the first game. Halo 4 for me was a bit of a wash. It felt self-contained, and like it was trying too hard not to be Halo. Halo 5 at least feels like they've returned to the old franchise. I appreciate the return of old characters, especially The Arbiter. The multiplayer seems to have returned to the casual classic style of the old games, and I hope that the Guardians and the Domain make this game rekindle my old sense of mystery."
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,obsidianchao,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:34:32 2015 UTC,"Agree on H4, and even Reach to a point ft like it was leaving Halo roots in the past. I've heard that H5 feels a LOT more like a halo game again, and I really hope that's true, because Halo 3 was the best MP experience I've had in my life."
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,TheFoxGoesMoo,3,Mon Jul 6 07:32:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Halo fan. I play the MCC every day. From what we've see so far, Halo 5 is going to be one of the best Halo games yet. I have the utmost confidence that it will be amazing."
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,KotakuSucks2,5,Sun Jul 5 18:10:08 2015 UTC,"Well I don't have an X1 so my opinion doesn't carry much weight but for me, if I had the console, no split screen = no purchase, its one of the only features Halo had that made it better than other modern shooters as far as I'm concerned."
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,JetpackAwaaay01,2,Sun Jul 5 16:50:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly, split screen is what I miss the most since I switched to PC. If I were to buy a console, good split screen games would be a major selling point. Playing online is fun, but there's something special about messing about with your mates all in one room in front of the tv."
Gaming4Gamers,3c7a32,KotakuSucks2,3,Sun Jul 5 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's basically why I've lost interest in buying consoles, the X1 and the PS4 have almost no local multiplayer games.  Its precisely the reason I like the Wii U so much despite never really being a fan of the Wii, the Wii U has local multiplayer in almost every one of its big releases.  I guess most people don't care about local anymore though since the Wii U is a complete failure while the other consoles are selling well."
