nhl,3e2vih,MrRyanHunter23,39,Tue Jul 21 15:17:22 2015 UTC,The title is misleading and gives the impression that a franchise has been awarded. So far an application for an expansion team has been submitted. That's it.
nhl,3e2vih,OccasionallyWright,6,Tue Jul 21 15:53:58 2015 UTC,It would be a crime against hockey if Quebec isn't awarded a team. In my opinion anyway. I'm rooting hard for them.
nhl,3e2vih,Formber,4,Tue Jul 21 16:26:02 2015 UTC,Quebec and Seattle getting teams would be marvelous.
nhl,3e2vih,Lune__Noir,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:21 2015 UTC,"Quebec will get a team, but I think Las Vegas has a better chance than Seattle. Vegas has a big pull for away fans to come see their team play which would help ticket sales as a fan base is established."
nhl,3e2vih,Skweres88,4,Tue Jul 21 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree that Vegas and Quebec will probably be the ones to get teams, but I'm rooting for Seattle. Would make for a great rivalry with Vancouver."
nhl,3e2vih,Lune__Noir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:54 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Seattle couldn't support an NBA team so I can't see them supporting an NHL team.  Especially with Vancouver established just across the border.

I can positively say that the Sonics had a much bigger fan base when they were moved than the Kings did last year when they got the arena. Either way, relocation shouldn't happen."
nhl,3e2vih,MechanicalWalrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:30 2015 UTC,That's always been my thought. If Vancouver is that close I would have to imagine there are a lot of Vancouver fans there already. Would they really be that willing to jump teams? I live in Kenosha but that doesn't mean I'm going to drop the Hawks if Milwaukee ever got a team. (Which if I remember correctly will never happen because there's some clause about a team never being allowed to be so close to Chicago anyways.)
nhl,3e2vih,Skweres88,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:50 2015 UTC,I grew up in the Pacific Northwest. Can't say there was much of a Vancouver fan base. It's kinda like up in Vancouver where there isn't a strong fan base for the Mariners.
nhl,3e2vih,MechanicalWalrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:15 2015 UTC,"It could also be argued that the Nordiques had that same problem with Montreal fans firmly rooted in the area.  I don't recall how big their fanbase was prior to moving to Colorado.  But maybe it's not so bad since the Habs haven't won a cup in over 22 years, so they are 1 generation removed from the glory years, unlike when the Nordiques moved in the early 90's and Montreal fans were enjoying greater success.  I also read somewhere that in the 90's, Quebec City had the smallest market of any team other than the Green Bay Packers, but Green bay has the city Milwaukee to draw upon, unlike QC which has nothing nearby.  So I have so reservations on how this will work."
nhl,3e2vih,Bruinman86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:53 2015 UTC,You clearly haven't been to Quebec City if you believe the people there moved on and started cheering for Montreal.
nhl,3e2vih,mushnu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"No, you're missing my point. Since the Nordiques were a newer, WHL team and the Habs had been around much longer, with a greater level of success, the PoQ fanbase was primarily made up of Habs fans.  So throw in the fact it's been 20 years since the team left for Colorado, what are the chances the team can pick up enough fans to support the team?  1) the team moved because attendance was down and the team couldn't support itself  2) They are competing with a much more popular team that had a dominant past  3)  20 years after the team left, some fans likely have moved on to another team.  4) its the smallest Hockey market in north America. I'm sure some fans have been waiting for the team to return.  I just wonder if that will be enough to keep the team long term.  And to answer your question, no I haven't been to QC."
nhl,3e2vih,Bruinman86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"As a Bruins fan, if the Whalers made a comeback, I'd support both of them, but the Bruins would take priority when they play each other. Up to you, though."

nhl,3e2vih,JaquesNoir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:15 2015 UTC,Vegas has over half a million people with no hometown team and hockey is generally the cheapest tickets in town. I think that for short term the out-of-towners would help but a fan base would slowly develop.  Out of any city that has never had a team before Las Vegas at least has the out of towners to help supplement income until a fan base develops.

I get the angle you're talking about, but I don't think this is always the case... Arizona?? Tampa? Carolina? Sunrise Florida? Atlanta?

nhl,3e2vih,JaquesNoir,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:08 2015 UTC,Arizona?? Tampa? Carolina? Sunrise Florida? Atlanta?   I completely understand what you mean. But if a team were to go to a non-hockey market I think Vegas would have the best odds.

nhl,3e2vih,JaquesNoir,5,Tue Jul 21 22:46:27 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but the NHL will more than likely sit on the Quebec bid while it waits for Seattle to come forward.  That's what they really want."

nhl,3e2vih,2tidesaday,4,Tue Jul 21 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"The NHL really wants to be in Vegas and Seattle.  The application period means nothing, if a group came forward next month, the NHL will most certainly accept it."
nhl,3e2vih,fogNL,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:13 2015 UTC,Well that would be sweet.  I would love a Seattle team since I'm thinking of moving there.
nhl,3e2vih,2tidesaday,2,Tue Jul 21 20:33:38 2015 UTC,Yes but it means little as it was set by the NHL. They will obviously allow for more applications to come in if it is to their advantage.
nhl,3e2vih,ChadSC,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, lots of people were ready to declare the Seattle bids dead because they didn't meet the NHL's arbitrary deadline.  Obviously they can't sit on the process forever, but its really up to the NHL to decide when to stop taking bids.  It certainly LOOKS bad/unfair to declare a deadline and let someone get a bid in later, but I think the NHL is that intrigued by Seattle that they're quietly willing to give the bids more time."

nhl,3e2vih,Taupy,2,Tue Jul 21 22:30:33 2015 UTC,"Hypothetically, if Quebec was awarded an expansion team, and Seattle/Las Vegas was awarded a team, this brings the total number of teams to 32. Right now it's 8-8-7-7 conference split. Detroit wanted to move to the East during the last realignment, Columbus got moved to the East. Who would be the team that gets moved out of the East to even out the conferences and make room for Quebec?"
nhl,3e2vih,hmpsnj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"Instinctively, I'd say Detroit on the basis of giving Chicago an Original Six rival. But as for competitive balance, I can't really say, though I feel like Detroit would have a better chance to compete in the modern Western Conference than Columbus.  Or if they go the NFL route for realignment (eight four-team divisions), I'd expect to see them both exchanged for Nashville, setting up a new Southeast Division."
nhl,3e2vih,Nightlingbolt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"Detroit specifically wanted to move to the East because they wanted an easier travel schedule, so I doubt they would all of a sudden want to give that up again. Columbus makes too much sense with natural rivals in the Pennsylvania teams."
nhl,3e2vih,hmpsnj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"But then who would change divisions in that case? If Vegas and Quebec both get teams, then each conference gets one more team and they'd still be uneven. Something has to give somewhere."
nhl,3e2vih,Nightlingbolt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:27 2015 UTC,"Logically, Detroit is the one to move to the West, but they are one of the premier franchises in the league, so I'm sure they have a large say in which conference they want to play in. They finally were able to move into the East, their preferred conference, and I just can't see them agreeing to switch back suddenly.  Basically, I don't think Quebec will be awarded an expansion franchise, there will be two expansion franchises added in the West. Two out of Seattle/Portland/Las Vegas/Oklahoma City will get teams, and Quebec will get a team if the Panthers or Hurricanes need to relocate"

nhl,3e2vih,JiuJitsuJustin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"We've never had a pro team in the four major sports in Vegas (NHL, NBA, MLB, and NFL), but we've had some groups that were owners or part-owners of other teams.  One case was the Maloof brothers who owned both the Sacramento Kings and the Palms.  As long as the Palms didn't take bets on Kings games, everything was kosher.    The Vegas NHL franchise would play in an arena owned by MGM.  If there were a restriction in place, it would be that MGM properties couldn't take bets on just those games.  But you can bet on UNLV football/basketball games and Las Vegas Outlaws (arena football) at any property in town, so it's not like being based in Vegas suddenly excludes the games from the sports books."
nhl,3e2vih,SpikeMcAwesome,2,Tue Jul 21 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"As someone who really wants more Canadian teams, I feel this isn't as big of a slam dunk as it should be. I think the NHL expected (and was hoping for) bigger markets like Seattle, Toronto and Kansas City to apply for expansion.  I think since the two arenas are already built, we get AT LEAST one team in one of these two cities. I won't be surprised at all if the NHL reopens the process either at a lower fee or at the same rate. Remember, they're running a business, and the television market in Las Vegas (I can't comment on Quebec) isn't exactly busting at the seems with potential like some of the other cities.  In short, is the NHL happy with how the process turned out?"

Goalies are extremely underpaid in the NHL, and as long as they sign team friendly long term deals at a young age it will stay that way. People make the comparison that Price is paid $7 million with a cap of $6.5, but that was signed before the current CBA and at a much younger age with more team controlled years. Today he would get $10 million easily on the open market. Hopefully Holtby holds out and the arbitrator sides in the middle of both figures because even though $8 million is a stretch, $5.1 million is way too low for the production he gave last year. $6.5 million is about right."

As a Bolts fan, it's tough to make the easy argument that Las Vegas just doesn't seem like an obvious success, but I'm happy for that argument to have been proven wrong a couple times.  The way Seattle supports their teams would be infectious in the NHL. Seattle's supporter group would make our Sticks of Fire look like three dudes wearing scarves.  I also think places like Winnipeg and Quebec having NHL franchises is important, too. What's better than the look of that tiny MTS Centre in the middle of a white out and not a single person on the roads in an entire city? I think those places having teams can only be positive.

Brewer is going to retire in like a year, literally a place holder at this point, Booth hasn't been signed, neither has Bernier, who is also still very young for an NHL starter. PA Parenteau was a signing they made to flip him at the deadline, for more draft picks. As you remember Edmonton got a first for David Perron of all people, Parenteau with a half decent season could get a 2nd at the deadline. Robidas was brought in to mentor the young dmen in the system but I will admit 3 years was an inexcusable signing. As for Phaneuf I dont think he should be captain but in fairness when has he ever played with a true top line d partner. They are giving Babcock a chance to coach him and bring him back to the Calgary days, may not work but its not like its going to hurt the team during a rebuild. As for the prospects, as a guy with a wings logo next to his name I thought you of all people would understand patience with prospects."
nhl,3dfgf6,ranshow14,2,Fri Jul 17 12:56:22 2015 UTC,"Personal experience, these are the teams you should follow.  If you like a team that wins, go with the Blackhawks. Really similar to the German national team in football, just constantly winning because they're legitimately designed to.  If you like a team that you can emotionally invest in, pick the Oilers. Cheering for them is a true roller coaster, they load up with world class firepower but screw with you by getting village class defenders and goaltenders and consistently sell the same hope back to you every summer. Don't worry though, next year will TOTALLY be different. Everyone promises.  If you like following the greats, watch either the Penguins, Capitals, or Lightning. Although Chicago has two of the best players in hockey, the consensus three best players in the world over the past five years belong to these three clubs.  If you love an underdog that wins with heart, watch the Flames. They have the best underrated core of defensemen in the league and stable enough goaltending, which makes things much easier for their forward group which ranges from too young to too old, but the group is undeniably charismatic. They are the kings of late game comebacks.  Speaking of kings, if you're looking for tough hockey look no further. The Kings and Ducks play a punishing brand of hockey that wins by submission. Each team features physical specimens oozing with talent and each have championship pedigree. These two SoCal teams are always successful when the playoffs start.  The Predators are the team to watch if you like a defensive brand. Their blueline features one of the best defenders over the past decade and their goaltender is usually one of the top three at the end of the year. Thick with up and coming talent, they could be a team to watch as they improve their scoring.  Finally, if you enjoy watching a team rich in history, I'd suggest the Canadiens or the Rangers. These two teams have strong rosters right now and are loaded at all positions. They play exciting hockey and showcase elite talent while every broadcast is thick with tradition and hockey culture.  tldr; just go with the blackhawks, if they make it to the finals bet on them winning in game six."

I don't really like bandwagoning and winning isn't what is most important to me.  I will have to go over your list a little more when I'm not on mobile and do some research on each team.

nhl,3dfgf6,Capitalsman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"Watch as many games as possible and as you start noticing you like a team's play style, players, goal horn, uniforms and logo, fan chants/fans in general it tends to guide you to a team you like. And if you like videogames combine that and play one of the NHL games, it's how I became a fan of a couple European soccer teams."

nhl,3da2lh,rebelrowzer,2,Tue Jul 14 19:01:38 2015 UTC,I want to look more into this game since it's fuzzy in my head lol

nhl,3da2lh,vVvMaze,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the sharks did so much better without Nabokov......"
nhl,3da2lh,Village_ponce,5,Tue Jul 14 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying he should have won a cup. At least one with how stacked the teams he's been on.    But then again, I'm not sure if he's ever won a vezina...  Taken from his wiki--   Calder Memorial Trophy - 2001 NHL All-Rookie Team - 2001 NHL First All-Star Team - 2008 NHL All-Star Game Appearances - 2001 and 2008 Best Goaltender -  2008 IIHF World Championship Vezina Trophy Finalist - 2008 Set an NHL record on Feb. 11, 2010 at DET when he won his 11 consecutive road game (Nov. 21, 2009 vs. ANA — Feb. 11 2010 vs. DET) First Goaltender in NHL history to score a powerplay goal Became only the second goalie to record 3 consecutive 40 win seasons on Mar. 27, 2010 vs. VAN"

He was hardly the cause for their playoffs performances. I doubt he was even given a chance to put the team on his back.  This save wasn't only nice, it was during the 3rd OT of a playoff game. Can't be more clutch than this."
nhl,3da2lh,coldb_too,4,Wed Jul 15 10:06:21 2015 UTC,"As a Flames fan I truly dislike that man, but damn do I respect him."
nhl,3da2lh,coldb_too,2,Tue Jul 14 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"Dude, the flames kicked ass this past season. I was rooting for you guys during the entire playoffs. The last game I saw live was the Flames at the Sharks last season. I was impressed."
nhl,3da2lh,The_Mightiest_One,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"It was a fun ride.  I'm always keeping an eye on the Sharks though.   They are always ""one break going their way"" from taking the West.   Here's to a great 2015/16 season for our respective clubs. Cheers!"
nhl,3da2lh,FreshOutBrah,7,Tue Jul 14 22:57:32 2015 UTC,This one is better I think.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a49KsWSGzk

nhl,3da2lh,Gslicethepowner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:21:05 2015 UTC,I kinda wish it was. We'd all win!
nhl,3da2lh,evildwarf,0,Wed Jul 15 04:30:12 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, wasn't trying to imply it was."
nhl,3da2lh,mrennie25,5,Tue Jul 14 21:33:09 2015 UTC,Not even close to the athleticism that Nabokov showed.
nhl,3da2lh,roadslaya,3,Wed Jul 15 04:32:02 2015 UTC,"Great call by the ref.  They take a lot of crap, but in this case he's nailed a key call.  It looks clear in the super slo-mo but he only gets one look at full speed so you've got to give him credit for getting such a close one right."
nhl,3da2lh,Theropissed,3,Tue Jul 14 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"I remember it like it was yesterday. I jumped off the couch, I couldn't believe it."
