This version features Super Mario World as a fifth playable game, which was released for the Super NES in 1991. Super Mario World is nearly identical to the original version; however, Luigi's sprites were updated to make him distinct from Mario."""

Those compositions and the situations/environments/dialogue they accompany are imprinted on my psyche, and they fit so flawlessly that it's hard to say whether they capture or define their essence.  The only game that comes close is Chrono Trigger, but it somehow seems more limited? Does it make sense for me to say that I like the music from Chrono Trigger best, but that FF3 had better use of music? And that, by the same token, Chrono Trigger is the best game, and FF3 is my favorite?   I have to admit that Chrono Trigger has the better story, characters, world and lore, but I like the way FF3's story is told better; and so much of that is due to a deftly placed and perfectly crafted musical score.

This game is a port of a Neo Geo game that also had the zoom, but that system was capable of scaling without an enhancement chip.  Super Castlevania IV was an early installment on the SNES that used the mode 7 background layer trick to give the Koronot boss the illusion of scaling. You see the same thing with Bowser in Super Mario World and the three Koopas.  For the most part, the SNES isn't really capable of proper sprite scaling. What you see instead is more programming trickery that was pretty clever for the time. As for proper sprite scaling, you see it in Yoshi's Island because of the SFX 2 chip, and perhaps other games that I don't know about.  The only 4th generation consoles I can think of that were natively capable of scaling were the Sega CD and the Neo Geo AES. I very well might be leaving some consoles out so if anyone wants to correct me, feel free."

snes,3dxlyb,BCProgramming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:22:12 2015 UTC,"I have a Super UFO. I intended to use it to back up my Chrono Trigger saves.  I decided it would be smart to test it first- figure out the whole process. So I used a dupe copy of Super Mario World.  I dumped the SRAM to a file. Loaded up the game. All the saves were deleted. Tried restoring the SRM file I created back to the game, then loaded it up again, and it was still empty.   At the same time, though, I was able to transfer a .SRM file created by playing Diddy's Kong Quest on the Super UFO to the actual Cartridge without issues. Crux of it is that I simply can't trust it to dump the SRAM from Chrono Trigger. Since I cannot seem to repeat successes."
snes,3dxlyb,mrpopsicleman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:26:16 2015 UTC,"I've never had any problems dumping SRAM with it. I have had trouble dumping a few ROMs, notably Super Mario RPG, but since it's an SA-1 game, it's not surprising. The SRAM for it dumped fine though. I do like it and it comes in handy, but I'll admit it's probably not the most reliable thing in the world. It was probably assembled in a sweatshop and the software for it is an update of the late 90s floppy disk version of the Super UFO 8 that was written by who's knows who. Probably better off dumping both ROMs and SRAM with a Retrode."

Some weapons you can get earlier (like the wave beam for example) if you use some tricks, but in general that's how it plays out.

Things that won't seem immediately obvious:  Pink Doors requires 5 missiles or 1 super missile to open.  Green Doors require 1 super missile  Orange Doors requires 1 power bomb  Doors with Eyes on them lead to Bosses, they can only be hit with missiles while the eye is open, and it takes 3 hits to kill them.  You can change your key bindings at the load screen, I suggest changing your attack from the default 'X' to 'Y', but that's just how I personally prefer the controls."

snes,3dyu9z,Ninjagamer1234,2,Mon Jul 20 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"Battery in your cartridge is dying.  If you have a multimeter you can check the voltage. If you don't have one you can pick them up cheap at electronics stores.  As for replacing it, there are two methods.   The first method involves carefully breaking the battery away from the soldered tab, sliding a new one in and taping it down. Personally I hate this method but for people who can't solder it works.  The second and best method is soldering a new battery in. You can buy pretabbed replacement batteries on eBay. Desolder the original battery and solder in the new one. Be careful not to apply heat any longer than necessary, batteries aren't to be fucked with.  Honestly though the second option is best and if you don't know how to solder it's easy enough to learn.  Any questions, just ask.   EDIT: Just a quick note: Don't turn your SNES on/off multiple times in rapid succession. I highly doubt you were but this -can- technically wipe saves, although I've never experienced it myself. I'm still almost positive this is a cartridge battery issue."

Also I know it's tempting for a one off job but -don't- get the super budget $10 soldering iron. i've been using soldering irons since I was 6 years old and even I hate those fuckers. Spend a bit extra on a nicer iron or even more for a variable temperature station if you think you'll solder more in the future.

When localized for europe the timings were rarely corrected for the slower draw rate and the PAL versions frequently have weird timings in gameplay/music/animations as a result since draw rate directly correlates to game logic in nearly every 16 bit console game.    It isn't the 10 extra Frames per second you should worry about; it's how badly most of the european localizations were handled."

For me the best part of the SNES in 201X are all the ROM hacks, re-translations, and new translations that you can get flashed to carts with fantastic labels.    I hadn't played them via emulation or re-release, so I was literally giddy the first time I got to play Terranigma, SD3, and Final Fantasy V on real hardware.

snes,3dwo1i,TheCardiganKing,2,Mon Jul 20 06:54:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I got most of mine back in the day when Gamestop was liquidating their stocks. Got FF1 in box with everything, Streets Of Rage 2 and 3, and some other stuff. Wish I went out more for the SNES stuff. I don't care much for the Genesis and bought it mainly for Streets Of Rage, to be honest.  Flea markets used to be good. Bought my Genesis and Sega CD combined for $35 years ago. Now it's haggle, haggle, haggle. Bought 2 NES controllers for $6 each yesterday at a flea market so they're not all bad. Didn't haggle because I think that's a fair price. They seem to go for at least $10 - $15 each online.  It's tough going anymore. Trolling Ebay seems to be best because now you can make an offer to a seller or luck out and get something cheaper because the seller just wants to unload it.  I still think dealing with re-sellers is awful. I'm starting to think they're the scum of the retro game world. Bunches of nerds that hoarded games and hike prices up. I don't like dealing with them in person either because they're very immature and unreasonable when it comes to talking them down in price. I usually have to get my girlfriend to haggle to make a deal when I see them in person. They won't budge when I try to haggle, even if it's a dollar or two off of an $18 game. I refuse to pay Ebay prices for stuff in person. Much of the cost is shipping on Ebay because when ""free shipping"" is offered they usually just add the approximate cost of shipping into the final price. Sellers in person don't have to ship them. That thinking irks me."

Sometimes they agree and I can get a few bucks off, sometimes they get pissed.   I can't really spend a ton of money on these, so saving even a dollar or two helps.

There are people who get into selling retro games mainly because they think it's easy money. The guy I got two NES controllers from for a decent price was an older man and he only sold so low because he had a deal with someone to buy the remainder of his lot that day (whatever he couldn't unload). This is the second time I've seen this guy at this particular flea market and his prices were almost identical to Ebay. The crazy thing was that his wares were mostly damaged! He's pricing games that have torn labels, are horribly yellowed from sun damage, and dirty, against near immaculate condition games on Ebay! Under normal circumstances he would never budge much on the price of games. His asking price was just too high to begin with.  Don't get me started on the common classics. All those games you mentioned I believe at one point came with the SNES. They are extremely common, probably the most common, and sellers are asking absurd prices for them. Star Fox can still be bought cheap, however."

I couldn't understand a lot of what he was saying (really thick middle eastern accent) but he seemed like he knew he was selling to people who actually cared about the games, not reselling them to make some money, which was always way awesome.
