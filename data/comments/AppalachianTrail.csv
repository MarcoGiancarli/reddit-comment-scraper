AppalachianTrail,3e53m0,Goosemandu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:52:26 2015 UTC,It's 733 miles between those two X's.    The average NOBO thruhiker covers that distance in 35-40 days.    The average semi-active person hitting the trail without trail legs covers that distance in 45-50 days.    The average overweight couch potato covers that distance in 55-60 days.  This doesn't include zeros
AppalachianTrail,3e53m0,beach_paws,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:05:03 2015 UTC,"Alright wow that's far. So say I fall under the average semi-active catagory. How many days would you suppose it'd take me to hike the ME section? The NH section? The VT section? Also, if you have hiked the northeast section before, what 100 mile stretch would you recommend, considering I'd only be hiking for a week? Thank you for your help."
AppalachianTrail,3e53m0,beach_paws,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:16:17 2015 UTC,"Here is the distance calculator.  I'd hike the 75 miles White Mt section between, Franconia Notch, NH to Gorham, NH.  Or, the 70 mile section between Stratton, ME and Monson, ME.  Both sections are difficult, but the lesser distance won't be a death march.  Plenty of people will recommend the 100 mile wilderness, but it's highly overrated.    If you really want to hike 100 miles over difficult terrain, hike Glencliff to Gorham, or Rangely to Monson.  If you're in shape and motivated, the distance shouldn't be a problem."

AppalachianTrail,3e0gkc,squidsemensupreme,9,Tue Jul 21 00:27:29 2015 UTC,If it's too crowded for you why are you staying in shelters?  There are plenty of places to get solitude if you truly wanted it.
AppalachianTrail,3e0gkc,SheriffEZPonder,6,Tue Jul 21 00:55:34 2015 UTC,"Tonight I made this post because in staying at campsite that is located pretty well off the trail, and a group of NoBos show up and start streaming videos on what sounds like a steroids system. I'm located as far away from then as possible and can still clearly hear everything...  And yes, I guess I overestimated how much of a wilderness experience this was going to be. The 100 Mile Wilderness and New Hampshire were more to my liking, rather than this stopping in town every other day. I guess I'd prefer something more difficult.   It's my own fault for having unrealistic expectations."

AppalachianTrail,3e0gkc,gtbuzzed,17,Tue Jul 21 12:10:01 2015 UTC,The AT is a social trail. How social it is depends on you.
AppalachianTrail,3e0gkc,magicpostit,21,Tue Jul 21 00:30:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, what do people expect? They're going to hit the trail and everyone is going to follow their schedule and personal wants and needs?   To answer OP's question, you should have started about a month and half later if you wanted solitude, and even then you're going to occasionally run into people. The PCT isn't as crowded, and if what you want is zero social interaction, which is completely fine, hike the CDT.   Trails are there for everyone, from the annoying party people to the whiners who are disappointed it's not exactly what they imagined it would be, the section hikers, day hikers, families with loud kids, and drunken college students. HYOH and quit yer bitchin'."
AppalachianTrail,3e0gkc,frightmolt,4,Tue Jul 21 01:03:51 2015 UTC,"Seriously! I've encountered this attitude (""WTF are other people doing here in the shelter I want to stay in?"") a couple times on this hike, and it puzzles me a little. One time in a heavy rainstorm in central Virginia, about 8 people had taken refuge in a shelter when a young woman showed up and bitterly complained that she couldn't have the whole place to herself. She said she was going to push on to the next shelter, but unfortunately for her even more people (20-30) had headed there before her. If you want to be alone, stealth camp. You'll never be completely alone throughout the day, but at night at least there are many places to find solitude. If you want true solitude, the most famous and heavily used long distance trail in the US is not the place to find it. But still, even though I'm in the NOBO bubble and have seen at least 2 people per day every day of my hike so far, I manage to spend the vast majority of the time alone, besides brief greetings when people pass me. It's not like you have to interact extensively with everyone."
AppalachianTrail,3e0gkc,oven_toasted_bread,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:21 2015 UTC,"I understand the trail has changed significantly, but I've finally come to a place in life where I can do the hike I've wanted to do since high school and the number of people on the trail has quadrupled and technology has come to the point people can bring their outside lives with them wherever they go. I decided South Bound would be best for me, but honestly this post concerns me. HYOH unless it means you don't want to deal with people whose goal it is travel in large enough groups that it makes them comfortable with the idea that the disturbance their party atmosphere makes  trumps the experience of individuals who are seeking solitude or even the rules set in place by the parks they travel through.   The Scott Jurek ordeal alone was a little ridiculous, I think they went overboard, but it's obvious BSP feels the trail is now a burden on the land, and the northern section of the hike is the part I look forward to the most.  I may hike the PCT and the CDT someday, but I grew up on the east coast and I want to hike forests, that's the appeal of the AT to me. A lot of people say you can avoid the large groups if you want to, and I hope they're right. I don't care if I pass 20 people a day as long as they respect that their hike shouldn't impact the hike of others. Hike in reasonable sized groups, pick up after yourselves, and kindly turn the boom box down. Preferably, toss the video blog selfie stick too. These are things you wouldn't have had to ask of people 5 - 10 years ago, so call it whining if you will but I don't think it's a ridiculous expectation from those of us seeking a more traditional experience.  Edit: I'll reinforce that I know I'll be around people with some regularity, and I'll agree OP sounds like his expectations of solitude are high, its just the traveling party idea that scares me."
AppalachianTrail,3e0gkc,gooeyfishus,5,Tue Jul 21 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  I think what OP needs to realize is that if he doesn't want to talk to people, he doesn't have to. If he doesn't want to be around people, he doesn't have to stay at shelters. If he desires no interaction with other hikers, he can do that be walking on.  The AT is as social or as wild as you want to make it. There are very few places where you are forced to do something in regards to your hike. Everything else is up to you, the hiker. HYOH (until it impacts someone elses hike)"
AppalachianTrail,3e0gkc,oven_toasted_bread,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like OP is saying even trying to avoid crowds by camping alone, he's being exposed to the party atmosphere as they tend to find him.

Take a Martz Trailways bus to NYC  Mile 1332 - High Point SP - You can get to the Port Jervis NJ Transit train station from here but it's kind of far, maybe like 7 miles.  Mile 1365/1368 - Greenwood Lake, NY. Take the blue trail down to the baseball field or walk into town from Rt 17A and catch a NJ Transit bus to NYC  Mile 1380 - Rt 17 x Arden Valley Rd, just before you enter Harriman SP. Wave down a Shortline bus to NYC  Mile 1397 - There's a bus to NYC from the Bear Mtn Inn  Mile 1406 - Graymoor Friary. Call a cab to take you to the Metro North train station in Garrison, NY or I can send you a pic of the map for the area so you can hike there.  Mile 1418 - call a cab from Fahnestock SP. Garrison or Cold Spring are probably the closest train stations. This will probably be pricey.  Mile 1442 - Cty Rd 20/Dover Oak. Make a right and walk into Pawling, catch the train from there. You're only a few miles from the AT train station at this point, but the Pawling train runs far more often. Service to the AT station weekends only and only a couple trains a day.  Mile 1445 - AT train station. Walk to Pawling if it's a weekday.  Mile 1450/1451 - Make a left at Duell Hollow Rd or Hoyt Rd and another at and NY55, which turns into NY22 and walk to the Wingdale train station. Also has more frequent service than the AT stop. Stop at Cousin's Cafe and get an egg sandwich or brick oven pizza"

Plus there's bus stops over in Warwick (always worth a visit if you're on the trail in this area). Make sure to stop at the Bellvale Creamery!  I'm unsure of the mile number, but there's a bus stop at the bottom of the trail for Surprise Lake which is in West Milford NJ, part of the ridgeline you'd be hiking here."

From there, you could head southbound and depending on how much you want to hike, you could reach Bear Mountain Bridge or to the NJ-NY state line (or further). I've hiked through that area and it is pretty nice, although not that challenging for an experienced hiker. I recommend the RPH shelter near Fahnestock State Park.

AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,pdxb3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:01:26 2015 UTC,Can you explain why? Is this an ideological difference or a safety issue?
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,wolfmans-brother,4,Sat Jul 18 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"Just an issue of practicality. You hike all day, set up camp tired as fk, fix dinner... What next? Sleep or go out hunting animals? Tomorrow: rinse and repeat."
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,stusic,5,Sat Jul 18 21:50:32 2015 UTC,"There's really no big water sources where you can fish until you get up north.   (This is assuming what you want to do is legal, because I have no idea about bow hunting)"
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,Psnipes,2,Sat Jul 18 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"I'm no lawyer or even an expert on state laws regarding weapons, but this could potentially be considered carrying a concealed weapon.  Also, regardless of large or small game, hunting/fishing licenses in every state you intended to use it would be required to legally do it.  You'd need to know seasons, limits, regional rules, etc...  Many of the (few) streams and rivers you'd pass would contain trout, which are a heavily regulated species as well.  I've only ever fished for trout in GA, NC, and TN, but I've never seen anywhere that would allow you to bow-fish for trout.  Regardless, it's 14 states of differing legalities to know, lots of expensive licenses to obtain, and just begging for fines/trouble if you're even accidentally breaking the law and get caught.  And I bet you don't even get much chance to use it."
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,pdxb3,3,Sat Jul 18 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"If you want to hunt on the the trail, I'd only bring the bow through PA.  You go through the state game lands,which quite hunter friendly. For he most part, Carrying a bow or going out of your way to hunt is not going to be very practical.   There will be social consequences(especially on the early part of the trail) for carrying a bow. most hikers are weary of the guy with the ""weapon,"" whether its a bow, .22, hatchet or machete...people who carry these items usually get rid of them within the first couple weeks or get off the trail after realizing that its not a ""survivalist"" or ""bush craft"" experience.  If its 2 -3 kilos... That's kind of a lot, and if its visible from the outside of your pack, you may run into problems hitching or walking around town.  Think about the time its going to take.  Every 15 minutes of not hiking is .5 miles of distance lost, time lost soaking in a view or bullshitting with another hiker at camp. What kind of game can you cook in your camp stove? Will you carry a grate to cook over camp fires? It may turn into more work than its worth.  you wont really see any small game until after the smokys and even then its mostly squirrels."
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,hoggruurgg,3,Sat Jul 18 18:43:01 2015 UTC,You planning on getting hunting and fishing licenses in every state?
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,MaidenATL,0,Sat Jul 18 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"I don't believe you need any sort of license to hunt small game like rabbits, squirrels, racoons, etc. At least in the south. Fishing you do."
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,FrogLevel,2,Sat Jul 18 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"You do. Typically though there's no closed season for small game, except for raccoons and foxes. You'd need to be pretty badass with a recurve bow to tag squirrels and rabbits though.   I wouldn't be in the woods with a hunting weapon or fishing gear and no license, regardless of my intentions. I've had my license checked in a campsite when a ranger saw my fishing gear.   But he will be able to purchase a 7 day license when he enters each state, the areas are rural enough where every store he comes across should have them.   Also another thing to consider is that there is a buffer zone around trails for hunting. He will need to go off trail to hunt."
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,MaidenATL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"Yikes I was going on what I had been told by friends for years. Good thing I'm not a hunter, haha."
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,FrogLevel,2,Sun Jul 19 00:26:51 2015 UTC,No worries. I'd be surprised if you would get into any real trouble for shooting a squirrel without a license haha. Probably just get a stern warning. I think what you've been told is a popular misconception.
AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,MaidenATL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:29:58 2015 UTC,In Virginia you definitely need one for small game.

AppalachianTrail,3dr6d4,Azlillidd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"Id recommend against it for the obvious safety reasons.  Too many people are hiking the same trail to be hunting on it.  Also most of the time you are hiking, most seasons are closed on small game.  Also you would need a non resident hunting license to carry it into the woods for every state you cross through."

AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,Gcobb,22,Thu Jul 16 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"If you read down to the Facebook comments, there are two (that I found quickly) who were there that day. Here's how they recounted the experience. I'm sorry for the wall o' text, and have highlighted the bits I thought most important:  The first:   I was on the summit when Scott Jurek arrived on Sunday, so my perspective may be a bit different than others. I had my trip planned for months in advance, and although I am a fan of Jurek and followed his trek, it was only by pure accident that we were there the same day. I've lived in Maine all my life, and this was my first hike all the way to the summit of Katahdin - and it was amazing. The pristine beauty is impossible to describe. When we reached the top there were 25 or so people who had also summited that day, and many were waiting for Scott Jurek's final ascent, and we decided to wait too. While there, we watched a couple take wedding photos in full wedding gown and dress blues. We spoke with a gentleman who was carrying a fallen soldier's stone for The Summit Project. We had lovely conversations about running, hiking and the amount of endurance and internal fortitude that it would take to complete an AT trek in 46 days. It was calm, peaceful and great to connect with people from all over the world. It wasn't rowdy, loud or disrespectful. There was a lot of excitement when Jurek made it to the summit, and I would expect there to be. It didn't take away from the beauty of Katahdin, and even Jurek commented on how stunning the area was. The champagne was a celebration of a long test of endurance, and he deserved every sip. Just like MANY hikers deserve their celebratory beers when they reach the summit. Yes, it 's against the rules, and maybe Jurek deserves the citation...but it happens all the time. It was not a party like BSP is describing it. He opened a bottle and then sat down to answer questions. I'm also surprised he was cited for having more than 12 people in his party. I watched them arrive, and I didn't think there were even that many - but regardless, they were close friends and they deserved to share that achievement with him. All the people you see in the picture that BSP posted were NOT in his hiking party - that was the total of people who had hiked up independently, and the ones who had hiked with Jurek. The picture BSP posted is quite misleading. Overall, watching Jurek accomplish this awesome feat made my first summit of Katahdin all that much more special - it was incredible to witness, I felt honored to be there and it did not detract from my experience at all. I will summit Katahdin again someday, but I don't expect any summit experience to ever be so memorable as my first.   And a second:   I was also at the peak that day (also saw the wedding photos & spoke with the Summit Project hiker). I completely agree with you that this was not some party atmosphere like BSP is trying to describe. It was a scene of accomplishment, jubilation, and relief. Baxter Peak was a little more crowded than the dozens of other times I've been there before, but it was not overwhelming. His finish was met with some cheers (rightly so), just like every other finish of a NoBo thru-hike I've seen. https://vid.me/m6cm I was at the peak a few years back to see a friend finish the AT when a man that National Geographic had been following along the trail was also finishing. Along with several cameras on the ground, we had several flyovers from a plane taking aerial video. This was way more disruptive than anything Scott Jurek did, as the producers on the ground stopped us on our hike back down so the man could hike ahead and they could get an aerial shot of him hiking ""alone"". This was repeated a few times until they got the shot they wanted and we were allowed to pass. I never remember seeing anything about citations for commercial purposes or disruption of nature the way they have done with Jurek's finish, where he had a handful of people with him and popped a bottle of champagne. I'm all for preserving the natural beauty of BSP. I grew up with it practically in my back yard. And sure, rules are rules. But this overzealous application of the rules and attempt to ""make an example"" is exactly the kind of NiMBY attitude the towns surrounding BSP are struggling with.   edited for format"
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,TheDuckontheJuneBug,10,Thu Jul 16 21:58:16 2015 UTC,"I'm the author of the second comment; I'm glad you found it a good example.  BSP made this out to be a big corporate PR stunt with loads of advertising and nothing but parties and crowds and total disregard for the park. Sure, Jurek may have had a sponsor's logo on his headband and shirt... but nearly everyone else there had a corporate logo on their backpack or boots and everywhere else, myself included. I may not have been paid to have it there like he was, but we were all wearing subtle advertising whether we intended to or not.  As for the atmosphere there that day, it was fun, exciting, historic, and not unlike many other NoBo finishes I've been present for. You know what Jurek did when he finished? He collapsed on the sign, kissed it, shared a private moment with his wife, cheered a bit, popped a bottle of champagne and sprayed the crowd a bit (which didn't last long at all; it was the cheapest bottle they could find) and then gave the crowd a little speech thanking his wife & other supporters and expressed how much respect he has for the Maine terrain, BSP, and Katahdin. That's it.  The surrounding towns are dying because the paper industry that built them doesn't exist anymore. Unfortunately, their attitudes are similar to BSP's — we don't wan't you people from away coming in to our land and enjoying yourselves unless we say so. I love BSP and the fact that it's ""forever wild"", and I don't want that to change. Jurek broke their rules, I get it... but I've been witness to way worse examples, and BSP should be promoting the hell out of this instead of chastising him. The park and the surrounding area needs more visitors, not less."
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,pixleight,0,Fri Jul 17 13:17:06 2015 UTC,"The whole issue here is that the park doesn't need more visitors. I agree that Millinocket would benefit from increased visitation, but the park already has to many visitors to keep up with the wilderness conservation goal. The Scott Jurek situation was a highly publicized way to further separate themselves from the all to rapidly growing AT community.. not all together that different from the letter sent from Baxter State Park to the ATC earlier this year. These examples are just a means to the end of the trail within BSP."
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,SweatySauce,5,Fri Jul 17 13:59:42 2015 UTC,"When I summited and finished my thru-hike in 2013, there were about 25 of us up there for a couple hours, taking in the scenery and drinking quite a bit. In the presence of a park ranger. No summons or tickets were issued."
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,Magic_Rat,24,Fri Jul 17 13:09:12 2015 UTC,I don't mind that the rules are enforced. It's ~15 miles of trail that is pretty unique and the rules are not burdensome. It's not difficult to save your celebration for millinocket. A highly publicized breaking of the rules deserves a highly publicized rebuke.
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,Gogglor,7,Thu Jul 16 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"As much as the administration of BSP sucks, he did break the rules. He obviously should be punished, which would likely be a temporary ban from the park, but posting publicly on Facebook about what he did is not productive. It seems like they're trying to capitalize on at his popularity to get their message out even though they're in a legal process right now with Jurek.   TLDR: Both of them are in the wrong"
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,sdenby,4,Thu Jul 16 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I was imagining how these citations would go down with a normal hiker in a normal park. Probably something along the lines of, ranger approaches hiker, says ""hey hiker, you're not allowed to do that."" Hiker stops doing it, apologizes and says thank you to the ranger for doing their job. Both proceed with their lives."
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,sdenby,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:38:26 2015 UTC,Baxter likes legal stuff. They seem to love banning people and organizations from the park. They have two rangers who have the powers of a police officer and they go crazy.

AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,PowPowPowerCrystal,14,Thu Jul 16 17:58:02 2015 UTC,"It was a flagrant and highly publicized violation of their rules. They couldn't not address this.  Baxter State Park is unique in its character and mission from all other areas of the Appalachian Trail and they are trying to preserve that while allowing the AT to continue through the park.  The character of the AT has changed significantly in the last decade, to the point where the spirit of the AT no longer coincides with the mission around which BSP was organized."

If only you show how correct you are, no matter how big of a dick you are doing it, people will listen. PFfffffttttt. The thousands of shitty things I've said over the internet while 100% correct has proven that theory to be false.  It takes more than being correct to change peoples behavior. These guys need to get out of the woods a little more I think.

AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,Psnipes,10,Thu Jul 16 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"The land for Baxter State Park was given to the state by Percival Baxter who laid down how the land would be used.(Different than all other State park Rules)  ""In conveying these lands to the State of Maine a definite Trust is created and I have the utmost confidence that the word of this Sovereign State as given by the Chief Executive and by the representatives of the people never will be broken and that this State never will violate the Trust provisions in the Deeds it accepts from me.”  If you're interested here's the Park management Plan (PDF) http://www.baxterstateparkauthority.com/pdf/reports/MgtPlanRevised04_10_13.pdf"
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,PowPowPowerCrystal,9,Thu Jul 16 18:38:03 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to refute anything you said - it seemed like you were grappling with why BSP was upset.   Do you mind explaining how? I honestly don't know.   BSP strives to provide a wilderness experience, putting this ideal above the convenience for visitors.   This is why there are caps on the number of visitors per day, no payphones in the park, no cellphone towers within the park (or service, for that matter), no electricity, only dirt roads leading in, no running water, tight controls on how long thru-hikers may stay and how many may stay.  The AT is billed as wilderness, but only Baxter has taken great pains to ensure that their park is ACTUALLY wild by eschewing all of trappings that you see along the rest of the AT.  Percival Baxter put it this way - the park should be ""available for those who love nature and are willing to walk and make an effort to get close to nature.""  The rest of the AT? Not so much. It emphasizes people's wants over the needs of nature."
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,choomguy,5,Thu Jul 16 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. Thanks for the info on Baxter, been wanting to get up there for a few years.   More parks need to promote this ethic.  I've spent a lot of time in national parks during the time that they went from no cell coverage to pretty much seamless coverage.  My understanding is that cell coverage has been added as a safety and convenience service, but I think it has had a detrimental effect on the experience. Not only from a self reliance perspective, cell phones have become a distraction to pretty much every experience."
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,Lizardqing,2,Fri Jul 17 12:01:13 2015 UTC,"That's certainly not the case here in the Smokies. I think they have jammers on the entrance signs.

AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,violatedchimp,0,Fri Jul 17 12:44:19 2015 UTC,"I never said it was me.  If you're interested, though, the conventional argument is that  A). A supported hike isnt really a hike.  You dont sleep in the woods, you dont carry you're weight.  In that respect, it's more like a marathon on a trail rather than a hike.  B). Speeding through the hike detracts from the hike itself.  You don't get to experience the trail because youre rushing through everything.  A lot of the trail is after all the places you stay and the people you meet, and a lot of that is lost during speed attempts.    C)  Sponsorships and temporary following bubbles tend to crowd the trail -- which already has crowding problems at times -- with touristy type, which can be annoying.  Lots of people not knowing Leave no Trace, etc.  That's just the general arguments about it.  In regards as to whether it affects me, of course it does.  Anytime one of these public portrayals of the trail gets out there, it changes the perception and the cuture of the trail when new people rush in.  Eventually National parks make stricter rules to compensate, which again affects me.  It is what it is though."
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,garmachi,5,Fri Jul 17 13:46:02 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily you, but tons of people seem to use these arguments to justify their dislike for Scott or their dislike for what he did. But consider this:  (A & B: Someone carried his stuff and he went too fast!) Scott never claimed to be a thru hiker. No one else ever carried his pack because he never had one. He's a runner. Runners don't sleep in the woods or do laundry at a hostel while eating pizza with their trail family. Runners run, and that's what he did. His approach didn't detract from his experience at all; his approach was the whole point of his experience.   (C: Trail crowding) His method for traversing the trail didn't detract from the experience I had either. If it weren't for the internet, his impact on our hikes would have been as follows: ""Hey, some really fast guy passed me a few days ago. There was a small crowd following him and then twelve seconds later I never saw him again."""
AppalachianTrail,3dj0nj,treadedon,2,Fri Jul 17 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"You implied you did have a problem from the wording and placement of your comments. Then stated of course it affects you.   A. I can see where you don't think this is a ""standard"" hike. I define a hike as a short 1-6 mile trip. Backpacking is where you go for overnights. Kinda just semantics.  B. True for you and most other people but for him it was about finishing as fast as possible. One's enjoyment is all relative.   C. I can see how it can be a pain. Crowding seems to be everyone's concern from the reading I've done. It appears to me the easy solution would not to make more rules/regulations as you said you do not want (I do not want that either, less government is better government) but to make the trail and areas surrounding less accessible. How this can be accomplished I do not know. I just find it ironic that some of the most scenic places you can drive a car right up to the top yet people flip when they see SJ might of dropped a cork on the ground accidentally.   It is what is though. Thank you for the reply, I was curious."

AppalachianTrail,3dkft9,fyyyyunyun,3,Fri Jul 17 18:17:53 2015 UTC,"Just 1 night? Never heard of a 1 night loop unless you make it yourself. Pick up a map of pisgah, tons of beautiful hikes near shining rock. Linville is nice too"
AppalachianTrail,3dkft9,Rook730,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:55:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice.  I'll look into Shining Rock.  That's the first time I've heard of it.
AppalachianTrail,3dkft9,SomethingTurtle,2,Fri Jul 17 02:38:40 2015 UTC,Seconded for shining rock wilderness.  Lots of Art Loeb.
AppalachianTrail,3dkft9,SweatySauce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:44:43 2015 UTC,"The Shining Rock area is beautiful and full of options. Check the bear cannister requirements before you go, there is a very pesky bear there."
AppalachianTrail,3dkft9,garmachi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:41:31 2015 UTC,The bear mostly stays around the campsites within a half mile of the road (graveyard fields and the forested areas next to black balsam rd).. if you actually had into the wilderness you should be fine.
AppalachianTrail,3dkft9,SweatySauce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:40:44 2015 UTC,Nope. I have had two encounters with bears in that area in the last 3 years. Both times I was far from the road and far from Graveyard Fields. Edit to clarify: Flower Gap and Shining Rock (the actual rock) were the locations. I forget the exact mileage but I think those spots are 4-6 miles into the wilderness proper.  In both cases the bear successfully removed our food from the tree.  (And it got the food of others camped nearby too.)
AppalachianTrail,3dkft9,fyyyyunyun,2,Fri Jul 17 15:51:26 2015 UTC,No kidding! I've never had a problem there.. Noted
AppalachianTrail,3dkft9,metarchaeon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:16:19 2015 UTC,"Oo yea, look into the art loeb trail as well if you ever want a multiday hike. I still think picking up a map and choosing your own hike would work just as good as going on a well known loop. Esp. Considering a lot of the nicest spots have parking not that far from it on the blue ridge parkway"
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,hxcmikenj,2,Fri Jul 17 03:25:54 2015 UTC,"Posted this but it disappeared, so here it is again.   To get three days and a pretty good taste of what there is to experience here I would recommend starting at the Dome, head north on the AT to first night at Ice Springs Shelter. If you get there with daylight to spare check out Charlie's Bunion.   Day two get a start before sunrise and backtrack a tad to the Boulevard Trail. About a tenth of a mile up is an unofficial trail on the right, though there is a sign, to the Jump Off. Probably the best sunrise here in the Smokies. Have flashlight though, you don't want to be stumbling around there!  After the sunrises head back to the Blvd Trail and hang a right to head up Mount LeConte. That trail is awesome. It's only going to be around 8 miles to the shelter on LeConte, but you will be gaining and loosing a lot of elevation on the way. It's not terrible though and makes it better than going straight up the whole time. Plus up top you will want to check out Myrtle Point and sunset at Cliff Tops. And of coarse the lodge, pretty good $3 bottomless hot chocolate and coffee.   Day three you have four trails to pick from to get back down. If it's Mon-Thurs Alum Cave, which is the most popular but shortest at only 5 miles, will be closed. Rainbow Falls or Trillium Gap will give you waterfalls though and both come out at the same trail head in Roaring Fork which is just outside of Gatlinburg.   Keep in mind that 10-15 miles here in the Smokies can be a bit ass kicking if you are not familiar with mountain hiking. Even for us locals it can be a leg burner depending on the trail! Also keep in mind that at the higher elevations the weather can be quite different than just right at the bottom. We have picked blueberries at 3 pm in August and it was 58 degrees at around 5500 feet. That and the weather here is highly unpredictable in general."
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,Lizardqing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:46:26 2015 UTC,"Listen to the lizard OP. This is a good plan.  Another option would be to start at Clingman's, overnight at Derrick Knob and Russell Field shelters, and then down to Cades Cove via the Russell Field or Gregory Ridge trail"
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,johnacraft,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"If you do that one which is good too, and pick Gregory Ridge to go down be sure to check out Gregory Bald. It's a steep little climb up to it but worth it. It's another great sunrise spot. If you've seen the short videos from the Great Smokies Association that start with the sunrise at the title screen, that's where it is at. We were lucky and were there that morning of that sunrise with just us and the guy that does the videos. And Gregory Ridge is much better going down than up!   And it is also a good thing to have more than one plan. They have been closing trails and shelters due to bears."
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,Lizardqing,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"That sounds like exactly what I was starting to think I wanted to do just going the opposite way haha. I thought about starting on the rainbow trail staying  at Mt le conte taking the alum cave trail to the road prong trail  to the at to Mt Collins and staying there. Then moving onto clingmans dome  and having my whole family meet me there to take in the sights.depending on how long I can actually get away I think I do like your plan better.  This may sound a bit dorky, but is there  any rope bridges over waterfalls and stuff like you see in movies? It may just be a romantic notion, but that's how I always pictured being in the smokies and backpacking since I was a kid."
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,Lizardqing,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:10:42 2015 UTC,"Hate to disappoint you, but there's no rope bridges anywhere in the park. There are plenty of log bridges though, some of which are an adventure to cross. There are some spots on Blvd Trail and Alum Cave that have cables to hang onto while you traverse where landslides have been that are cool.   Something to keep in mind with going from Alum Cave to Road Prong, along with the day's it is closed,  is that you will either need to catch a ride or hike New Found Gap Rd to the Chimney Tops Trail to get up to Road Prong Trail. Hiking the road would be rather adventurous to say the least with the way people drive on it! The Chimney Tops Trail is basically two miles of stairs pretty much once you get on it. The top is cool though, proposed to my wife on top. If you are looking for solitude, Alum Cave and Chimney Tops are anything but."
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,hoodge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:59:30 2015 UTC,Clingmans itself is a paved walkway. My favorite short hike is to The Jump Off.  It's a shoot off of the Appalachian Trail you can get to it by getting on the Appy trail at Newfound Gap. Especially of you haven't done many mountain hikes the Jump Off is beautiful.
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,slowtreme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"I just did this, sort of. Originally I planned to do an AT section but I came up with a different option.   My family rented a cabin in Bryson City NC. I had my wife drop me off at Clingmans Dome and I hiked back to town. Spent one night at a campsite.   You could do a similar hike on the TN side to gatlinburg, maybe the sugarlands trail."
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,Lizardqing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:46:27 2015 UTC,Me and my wife are talking about doing that ourselves hopefully soon. Except day hike it.
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,slowtreme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:47:55 2015 UTC,It's all downhill and doable in a day. But my goal was to get away for the night with one of my sons.
AppalachianTrail,3dl2ag,Lizardqing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"We would love that as well.  Have two little ones though that are limit our extended stays in the backcountry. There are a few spots in the park that would require an overnight or two so we can see them that are on hold right now.  Definitely starting from the top though, that seven miles uphill to Gregory Bald about whooped us!"
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,MjrPayne,3,Thu Jul 16 15:37:24 2015 UTC,"To be safe I'd go with a 20' but go with a quilt instead so you can vent if you get too warm.  Enlightened Equipment, Hammock Gear, JacksRBetter - all reputable and fantastic workmanship."
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,THE_BOKEH_BLOKE,3,Thu Jul 16 17:11:19 2015 UTC,I'm going with EE.  I sleep on my stomach with my feet apart.  I can't use an enclosed footbox. So that's two votes for 20 degrees.
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,Gcobb,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"An EE 20 will probably be perfect. I've used my Enigma 50 down in the 30s, not a great night's sleep but still an incredibly comfortable and well designed quilt."
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,Gcobb,2,Thu Jul 16 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear.  Did you have a liner, and/or all your clothes on?"
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,mikethemofo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:29 2015 UTC,With a vapor barrier and my mountain hardwear mountain speed jacket I took it down to 28. But besides that just shorts and a t-shirt.
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,THE_BOKEH_BLOKE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:01:16 2015 UTC,"I just got a Hammock gear Burrow 20 with an extra ounce of down, wide version for the AT next year, I got the snap footbox and I love it so far."
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,SheriffEZPonder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:02:12 2015 UTC,"All 3 of my UQs are from Hammock Gear.  Their craftsmanship is excellent and shipping is typically within one week of placing an order.    I have the 0°, 20°, and 40°.  All torso length."
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,SheriffEZPonder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:14:07 2015 UTC,I'd bring a 20 but it may be a tad overkill.  But it's the middle of July and I froze on Killington last night with a 40.
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,shut_the_fuck_up_don,2,Thu Jul 16 16:53:01 2015 UTC,Overkill is better than being killed via exposure...  But I don't want too much overkill (aka weight).
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,EMT_Titmaus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:57:51 2015 UTC,My bag weighs a touch over 2 lbs.  I'd carry the weight if I were you.  It gets cold in those mountains.
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,EMT_Titmaus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you wouldn't carry a -10 degree bag for that region/season.  I don't want to be dangerous, but I don't want to carry an extra pound if I can help it =)"
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,SweatySauce,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"I just bought a 20° EE Revelation Regular Wide for my thru next year. Also went with the DownTek down. EE says it will weigh 20.76 oz and it cost me $275. I bought it from Trail and Era since I was able to get free shipping from them but not from EE. I had a 20° mummy bag and find it to be a great temp for 3 season camping but a little warm in the summer. So a 20° quilt would be perfect. However, I plan on switching to a 50° synthetic quilt I made during mid summer to save almost 9 oz."
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,peaheezy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:19:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip on shipping.  I'll be sure to check that out.
AppalachianTrail,3dijnu,Joke_Insurance,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:21:05 2015 UTC,I just got a 15 degree bag
