And what's more you find you don't need the things they use to enslave you once you understand their validation to be meaningless.   My self esteem is high.  I value my own freedom and time more than anyone's opinions or accomplishments.   I don't really need much because both the carrot and the stick used to bait me into being a utility were only luring me to be a slave.   Society lures you with phony ideas of status.  Women are machines designed to lure you into providing for them financially and as labor\validation machines.  I don't need them, and am unashamed not to serve them.  Initially it is hard to follow your own values, but eventually it becomes natural, and the life of indentured servitude, no matter what the perks, abhorrent."

There is nothing so primal as surviving, as it is the prime to all experience. And there is something about feeling intelligent, capable, powerful even; that makes me feel good (on a survival level).

No more fucking dreams about your princess that will love you forever, nice castle and 'they lived happily ever after'. Fuck. That hurts. But then you realize probably social media tried to sold you that vision. Or maybe your mother, mentioning it somewhere. Your father- probably not...  those two things alone can make you absolutely fed up. angry. full of hate.   and then there's the realization that women know it all (and they r using it against us!) and you cannot do anything about it- you can only save yourself whilst they will still have their cake by screwing some other men.  that's depressing. even more after you face the fact that you might lose your colleagues or friends because so many of them are white knights/manginas/irreformable blue pillers- some of your close friends might actually damn you for speaking out the truth. 'ho ho ho, wait a minute! women are divine and fragile and yadayadayada we should protect them and serve them at all cost! you are mistaken! we pity you!' they will say and you won't believe your own ears and eyes seeing how all those men serve other gender rather than stick together with their brothers. pussy slaves we call em!  ignorance is bliss for them. some of them just don't want to know, don't want to believe. or they can't, because they're too deep into rabbit hole- married with kids and mortgages. they need some sort of mental conformity to keep em going. Imagine how sad THAT IS. That was the sole reason I choose truth over petty pretty lies.  after you digest it all... you go and sit on your couch/chair/whatever and think... well fuck, what I should do now? Probably you don't even know any people around you that might know the TRP/MGTOW truth. Loneliness might be a problem. You suddenly become outside of every social concept known before- no more chasing women's love. No more fun from conversations with blue pill men. No respect from anyone.   Except yourself. This is where you can reinvent and recreate yourself. Maybe for the first time in your life, truly?  ...how one cannot be depressed or wanting to have its revenge upon them? This whole anger requires immense release. I found this subred as a perfect place to vent from time to time- most people here will understand it perfectly as they were through similar stages themselves. Second place when my anger can be released is the gym and/or the bike. But you can exercise in home using dumbbells or even normal puships etc - just get creative.   This is just the beginning of the journey.   There were different paths leading to this, but we all somehow landed here. Freedom, finally! Pure, unblemished freedom. And women? Guess what. They can eat their fucking pseudo-love and let it stick in their asses. Fuck them all.  Welcome on board. :)"

Many guys may have a problem with what I'd do, but I will never come to the aid of an adult female, especially an attractive adult female, and especially when there are self righteous and dedicated white knights in the world who can do the saving. I have experience with that kind of callous, cunt voiced cuntiness, but it wasn't as life and death like yours. I remember severely spraining my ankle playing basketball and a cunty white woman who was watching, and who was attractive, was laughing and cackling and shouted out to the guys to throw me off the court, so they dragged me off and tossed me to the side as I was suffering pain and my foot swelled up. Some old black guy playing on another court saw and came to help me out. He helped me get to my car. As he did this, the other guys that tossed me off came to see if there was something seriously wrong, possibly because they felt somewhat ashamed.  On another occasion, I saw a male student brutally beaten up and robbed as he was sitting cross legged in the hallway enjoying his music and browsing on his phone, waiting for class to begin. There were so many women in that hallway, and they didn't do shit when the attack took place. He was screaming for help and the fear, terror, and desperation in his voice and movements was stunning. I remember my left eye twitching with shock at these gyno cunts not doing a damn thing or raising any alarm. That's when I realized they're not going to do shit, and I felt that I should help this guy out. I ended up chasing one of the assailants to the bathroom and locking him in. He sat pretending he was taking a dump in the toilet, and I called the cops. Being 5'4"", I easily could've gotten brutally beaten by these muscular 6'5"" assailants. I was told by the prosecutor that none of the witnesses wanted to testify (all women) and they really needed me to help this case. I agree to it.  With that said, I don't exist to be a possibility of safety or for providing safety and comfort for women in distress. I refuse to be chivalrous. I am not a public safety or emergency asset to women. They are on their fucking own, as far as I'm concerned. If a ship sinks with a bunch of women on it and there aren't much lifeboats, I'm going to do a tarzan, and jump of the starboard side with a dagger between my teeth, slice the ropes, and fall down into the ocean with my lifeboat. Not going to drown and die for women that will never fuck me in ten lifetimes just so they can go live to fuck Chad Thundercock, Brad Beefcake, and Matt Meatloaf, and marry a blue pill simp who will do all the providing and unknowingly raise children that aren't his, while my disposable carcass is being devoured by deep sea crab.   They will never put themselves in harms way to save a man's life."
MGTOW,3dyekr,joblessguy10,11,Mon Jul 20 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"The reason why women can do this is the vast majority of men are white knights that will scream their stupid heads off promoting ""equality"" and feminism.

MGTOW,3dyekr,sardinemanR,12,Mon Jul 20 17:16:26 2015 UTC,"I help out old people and others as well, but only when I analyze the situation quite well. For instance, if I see a woman in need of life saving CPR when she collapsed from cardiac arrest or choked on food (not a real cock or a dildo) and no one is there to do anything or if she's severely bleeding, or dehydrated and collapsed in front of my house, I'd probably help out, or got in an accident in a remote highway and no one is there to save a life or call for help, I'd probably help out. If a woman asks for directions, I'd give her directions. In essence, I will only help out, only in particular cases, when there is absolutely no one else there to do something. If she's out and about and slutting around, showing if her round ass in booty shorts and a man or woman starts to do whatever they are going to do, I'm not going to do anything. Too bad for her, she should've took the necessary precautions. She isn't entitled to my help, especially at the expense of my safety and comfort. If she's pregnant, and she gets on a bus and expecting me to sacrifice my comfort for Thundercock's unborn child, no thanks, I will go all out Pleistocene era Homo Erectus on her ass and deny her a seat for her preselected genetic material parasite child, because it's not my child, and probably not any simps child too. If she got on, and look as if she is in visible discomfort, and wasn't all feminist and in your face about wanting a seat, I'd giver her my seat because I'm a good human bean. Otherwise, if she's okay and no signs of discomfort, let a white knight or an able woman stand and give her their seat. My ass will remain firmly glued to the seat. All in all, it depends on the situation and whether I think and judge a woman to be in desperate need of critical assistance, and if no one is there or willing to do something to help, and definately not when my safety and life is threatened."

MGTOW,3dyekr,MaunaLoona,4,Tue Jul 21 01:10:47 2015 UTC,It's been shown in studies that rich people have less empathy. They're never gone hungry and have never been out on the street without shelter. They have no idea what it feels like.
MGTOW,3dyekr,thrownaway_MGTOW,6,Tue Jul 21 05:05:15 2015 UTC,"It's been shown in studies that rich people have less empathy.   Well, in this case we're not necessarily talking about ""rich"" people*.  But your point is well made, and there is definitely a lack of empathy that goes along with the consumer status-materialism and the accompanying narcissism of many upper middle class people. And of course an almost inevitable paranoia as well (per example ""pedophile panic"" -- like the previous ""satanic abuse"" phobia, or before that the ""reefer madness"" fears that fueled so much racism -- tends to be the highest among such groups). Some of that may be due to the sort of isolation and artificiality of the typical modern suburban existence, the lack of -- as you noted -- ever having gone hungry or been out ""on the streets"", nor indeed even ""out in the country""; not to mention getting their worldview shaped by not only things like the sensationalized TV news which exaggerates crimes, but also various other TV programs (everything from the ridiculously contrived dramatics of soap operas, to the paranoia-inducing ""crime/victim"" shows of prime time broadcasters). And then of course to top it all off, the various medications that many of them are on (mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety meds, anti-depression, etc), many of which literally have a substantial deadening effect on the empathy portions of the brain.    * And yes, obviously on a relative scale, historically or versus 3rd world peoples, they are indeed ""rich"", but so is virtually everyone else in modern western nations; even most poor people here don't really know what it is like to truly be ""hungry"", as in not having had anything to eat in a week or more and to truly be starving.  It's actually fairly rare** for anyone in the US to go more than a day or two without access to some kind of food -- and when it does happen, there usually there is some other cause beyond strictly a lack of food or access to it; i.e. children with abusive/neglectful parents, and/or then usually combined with drug abuse, mental conditions, fear of coming to the attention of authorities, some ridiculous pride or obstinacy, etc -- in other words something that prevents people from availing themselves of assistance.  ** It's not that it never happens, just that it isn't very common, not even among ""poor"" people -- food is relatively cheap AND abundant in western nations -- and even when it does occur, it generally doesn't last for long (and is nowhere near the levels that it can reach in other countries).    You can call me ""unempathetic"" if you want, but there were times years back when I was technically ""homeless"" -- and while I never slept under bridges or in culverts I did have a while where I sleep in my car, or the floor of a friend's garage (next to the car while I tried to fix it), or the several nights in the back room of an office, etc; and other times when I went for a several consecutive days with basically little-to-nothing to eat, having very little on hand for food (a small jar of peanut butter & half a loaf of bread), and virtually no cash, and needed to make it all stretch for a week or possibly more until I was finally paid (the date of which was never guaranteed or certain until it occurred) on the substantial money I was owed (and which then immediately got used to restock the proverbial larder with promises to myself to NEVER let it get so empty ever again... hence my current practice of always having a couple of months worth of food on hand, including canned goods and ""hard"" dried foods that could be rationed even longer if necessary; I just don't feel comfortable unless the shelves are all at least 1/2 full)."

Years ago (early 1990's) I picked up a late 80's Madza 929 which had been equipped with virtually every option possible, sun/moon roof, seat heaters, luxury seats, etc -- and which from the side & with the paint job, well virtually everyone thought it was a Mercedes sedan (and in my experience, was actually a superior car -- I had friends who owned comparable Mercedes, and they had incessant problems, my vehicle was virtually problem free).  I bought the thing for a ""song"" (about $3,000 cash) in part because it had been sitting at the used car dealer's lot for about 6 months... the region we were in was just (especially at the time) not an ""oddball import"" kind of place; oh, and it needed a whole new exhaust and new tires, etc.  Anyway I bought it, stuck about $1,000 into it for what needed to be done... and got 8+ years and about 140,000 miles (very nice, comfy miles) out of that thing before it finally gave up the ghost one winter (body & frame rusted out -- at like 13 years old and 237,000+ miles -- having lived its entire life in the frozen & in winter, salt-encrusted roads... well there wasn't much left).     *Sniff* I miss that car though, 'cause it was a super-sweet ride, a real ""touring"" sedan, comfortable & roomy, but with plenty of power... but they REALLY just don't make 'em like that anymore, (seriously, they literally don't make them like that -- that was the last production ""type"" for the high performance V6 equipped model with traditional rear-wheel drive {plus a power-overdrive on the automatic transmission that could really set you back into those cushy seats when you tromped on the pedal, but not bad fuel mileage on long trips if you drove conservatively}).  And I have to admit it served it's purpose very well (back in those days when I actually had a legitimate need for a nice 4 door sedan).  But alas nowadays, I really can't justify car like that anymore (no more multi-party business lunches with clients), and I now live in an area where rear-wheel drive is impractical about 4-5 months out of the year, and in fact the only thing that IS practical is a 4x4 (steep hills, steep driveway, back rural area with streets & town roads that are the last to be plowed or salted/sanded in winter, etc.)  So the only ""car"" that is likely to be in my future would be some little summertime sports-car toy, rather than some luxury sedan."

Why is that they are targeting every male space, from video games to comic books to sports to STEM fields, and ruining things by injecting their feelings, sexuality, and gynoagendas? To make men miserable."
MGTOW,3dure1,joblessguy10,23,Sun Jul 19 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"It gets even worse if you take money into account.  Women want men to waste money on stupid things before marriage. They want to be wined and dined, the men to have flashy cars, flashy clothes and spend money freely to convey status.  After marriage? Suddenly the man should be dressed in rags, have no money at all for himself, and turn over all his money so she can buy shoes or remodel the bathroom or other stupid, extremely expensive things that she will turn around and use once before getting bored of.   A man without women can live off almost nothing. Probably just basic clothing, work clothing, housing, food, computer and internet. Depending on COL, that's like $15-20k or so a year. A $50k a year salary is literally enough for a man to become rich with over a lifetime, if he invests the rest of his money wisely. Even more money makes the time even quicker.  But I guess that's a tangent. So I will stop."
MGTOW,3dure1,sardinemanR,2,Sun Jul 19 20:56:56 2015 UTC,"That's something I've been thinking about a lot recently.

Without a woman around, I'll be able to put ~$20k/yr into savings, or as you mentioned, invest some of it."
MGTOW,3dure1,CaptainNeedleMouse,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:31 2015 UTC,"thats a very good plan.  Living below your means is critical to financial success.   Putting $20K per year into investments is significant, if you have the discipline and means you will make it.   Take the long view, figure 20+ years and you will be set.   You are basically setting off to do what I did over the last 30 years.    I made money/investing into a hobby that PAYS.   of course, marriage/kids/divorce can send you off the cliff if you are not careful (I am single, never married, no kids and financially independent)  A few things that can help:  Set up a Roth IRA and max it every year. Try to max 401K if your employer offers one.   At the very least contribute enough to capture the employer match. Set up a brokerage account and start learning about money/investing.   take some chances, figure out your risk tolerance. Check out Dividend Champions and Dividend Contenders and diversify into some of these blue chips Set up A Lending Club account and start small (5-10% of portfolio).   once you get used to the filters you can easily make 7-8% after defaults."

Not having to work for money as a MGTOW is pretty much the ultimate form of independence from society (other than living in the wilderness and not depending on money at all, I guess).

The only correct response to a wife telling you to downsize your hobby is to immediately increase its size in direct proportion to the amount of nagging.

We get a fairly regular supply of those types -- especially young ""hipster"" guys -- popping up in here, and they generally post threads not all that different than what you have posted."

MGTOW,3dw12y,Morranaii,13,Mon Jul 20 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"two cents:  don't be baffled by this.  don't worry about what an embarrassment this is going to be/or not going to be.  Just let this be.  This is one to let go.  If someone asks you what you think about the all-female ghostbusters, just say what I say ""I have no feelings on it one way or another"".    In this world, movies are a matter of personal tastes.  People will go to the ones that look interesting.  I sat in the theatre this morning to watch ant-man, and of the previews I saw before the film, the only one that looked interesting was a film about a spanish boxing rooster that had english subtitles (the rooster had to take up boxing to get the money to save his farm, you see).  That film knew how to put together a ridiculously good preview.  The one for everest, which is a much higher budget film, looked like crap.    Films with big budgets mistake the market all the time.  There's the old story about how everyone was sure that cowboys vs. aliens was going to be huge, and it failed.  From the filmmakers POV, its the dream, daniel craig and harrison ford, a western and a sci-fi, and yet it failed.  Movies fail all the time for subtle reasons, and sometimes, they just fail because what works well in small doses (Amy Schumer) doesn't work in bigger doses over an extended time frame (yeah, Trainwreck was a, well a trainwreck).    If there is a big enough audience that wants to see an all-female ghostbusters film, it will work.  However note: vanity projects almost never work, and they tend to kill careers.  The people who are pushing this thing, chances are very, very good it will fail, and when it does, they'll be discredited.  Hollywood likes to push a leftist agenda, but it would also sell out its mother if it meant making a buck.  If it works, then more power to them, say I.  If it works, that means they found the right thing at the right time, which is tough to do.  Bottom Line: if this doesn't look interesting, don't see it (vote with your wallet, that's what Hollywood cares about) for those who think it is interesting, they should see it.  Let the market decide what people like and what they don't."

As kids we're more blind to the subtle placement of things but if we reflect in adulthood, it's clear and the mind fuck annoys us.  Think all the way back. The cool guy being the cool guy, the square being the square, and the nerd being the nerd. All of them coexisting happily together. All contributing something as a team. Each finding a little piece of one another within themselves. Enter the secretary. Let's make her nerdy but show that she can be sexy and desirable, too. Now throw in a socialite that embraces the socially inept and off we go. Can you think of a group of personalities less likely to be 'together in harmony' ?  Time for a sequel. Ya know what this movie is missing? A black guy! Oh, and the nerds need to get laid.  Even The Goonies is rife with this shit and it breaks my heart to realize that now. Hollywood has been mind fucking us since birth. It's just easier to see now as adults. It's also a lot less carefully woven in. I would even argue the narrative has been placed front and center and the story taking a back seat as a subtlety now. It would explain the rapid decline in Hollywood release quality of film these days. Some critics have called it the worst in 50 years. Wonder why.

I think I'm at a level of manospherian consumption where I'll start voicing my disagreements on points during the middle of a podcast/vlog/what-have-you.  So the way I see it there's good, better, and best, but in the end there isn't a single guru in the sphere that I agree with 100%. Guys I agree 90% or more with are somewhat dangerous because at some point you're tempted to shut off your brain and let your favorite guru do your thinking for you. Fuck that, you gotta stay on your toes.  So for me, sometimes a guy I only agree with 60% to 70% with is somewhat easier and gets me thinking. I don't have any problem going through a guru saying, ""Ok, agree, agree, agree, disagree, agree, agree, disagree, disagree"" etc because I'm thinking.  A lot of the great psychologists in their day were about 50% whack-o, but, you have to start somewhere. No one is sending people to Mars based on Sandman's theories and hypotheses, he's just like an advice columnist or something.  I have wondered if the ""donation"" bit isn't a fake-it-til-you-make-it scheme. Who the fuck donates to an advice columnist? Are people that rich? The main giveaway that it's a scheme is that he has writers saying, ""Oh I'm kind of a purple pill guy."" Seriously? I don't know about anybody here, but ""Purple Pill"" I thought was an invention of Reddit, specifically the PurplePillDebate sub. I find it a stretch of the imagination for that many people in this world to be aware of the manospherian ""red pill"" enough to identify with its nuanced color ""purple."" I've always thought Red Pill existed quite well enough outside Reddit and the red pill sub on Reddit just organized the shit out of it and made it more popular. Clearly the Redditors of the Red Pill persuasion could seriously give two shits about being on Reddit, as most are already poised to discharge onto puerarchy.com. And non-redditors aware of Red Pill but don't totally agree with it - are they seriously identifying with ""purple"" anywhere on any forum outside of Reddit? Show me where and maybe I'll believe it.

MGTOW,3dsgtm,mydark,5,Mon Jul 20 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"Sandman’s “The Monks of MGTOW” video is one of the most inflammatory and offensive MGTOW videos ever made by someone supposedly in 'the community'. Guy had no compunction at trashing a large segment of MGTOW out of a personal vendetta. And that he never offered the slightest apology after that huge misstep is reflective of his real motivations (he cares about subscribers/money/self-promotion not fellow MGTOW). He is as bad as many feminists, at making unsubstantiated, unsupported statements with zero factual evidence to back them up (why the unimpeachable Stardusk warned us about him years ago). As has been pointed out by several of his detractors, his 'sponsor requests' are often of suspicious authenticity and conveniently unverifiable (replete with strikingly similar word usage and sentence structure as Sandman's own contrived speech). Go back and read word-for-word several 'sponsor letters' and it will be glaringly evident, their texts and the accompanying video dialogues were likely written by the same person. At the very least, he is heavily embellishing written requests to provide cover for his own passive-aggressive, self-serving agenda.

MGTOW,3dsgtm,Santaball,2,Sun Jul 19 10:54:34 2015 UTC,"As my username implies, I'm really not fond of him. I tend to stick with the Holy Trinity (Stardusk, Barbarossa, Spetsnaz) because I find myself in agreement with most of their work, especially Stardusk. In relation to Sandman, I stand firmly with Stardusk in my belief that Sandman is looking to make a quick buck via marketing strategies and through the exploitation of the emotions or ignorance of newer MGTOW. Additionally, assuming he's not some shill making videos purely for profit, his shallow perception of MGTOW (fix the law and we'll live happily ever after :)), his lack of philosophical or scientific backing for much of his content (ever notice how much he talks about his personal experiences without referencing any relevant statistics or studies? Or how he lacks a firm and clear set of philosophical beliefs, rules or guidelines?), his constant need to restate the same vapid trite, and his irritating and demeaning 'i'm-talking-to-a-retard' voice make his videos and overall content, in my opinion, useless. Additionally, though other MGTOW accept donations, Sandman seems to be heavily marketing and exploiting them for content. Basically, people are paying to give him ideas for content.  Though one needs to remain mindful of allowing people to talk for you, as another commentor mentioned, I tend to find myself in nearly full agreement with Stardusk, Barbarossa, and Spetsnaz (along with a few others), and I believe that this is due to the level of thought, care, and logic that these creators put into every video. They offer insightful, logical, and practical content which is often tied in with evidence, intelligent advice or philosophy, or thought provoking messages and ideas. These men, and others who devote time and energy into creating quality content, are a large part of what drives me to be a better man.

It is not like he was MGTOW, but suddenly became feminist just to make a buck.   To me, the true meaning of ""selling out"" is changing yourself and your work against your better judgment to appease an audience.

The movie version, where Tony creates Ultron is a different story.  It always made the story more interesting that the BP guy created maybe the Avenger's greatest villain, than that the RP guy did.  Hank can be shamed by other superheros for Ultron, everytime Hank is with other heroes and one of them points out ""you created Ultron"" hank apologizes, Tony doesn't apologize.  Tony is the Marvel U Batman (yeah, I created a giant spy satelite that went OMAC on everyone and nearly killed everyone and everything on earth, so sue me.

As someone who has had depression for a  long time, I don't like the idea of sharing my ""feelings"" which is quite common in support groups. I have tried going to support groups and I just don't find them helpful. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about my problems and how to solve them, but how I'm feeling is irrelevant as far as I'm concerned.   I want honest feedback from someone I trust and respect. I want to understand the psychology of depression and the biological mechanisms at work. But, typical support groups want you to talk about how you feel, and that just doesn't work for me.  I would much rather spend that time writing my thoughts and goals down, working out, or meditating. Those are far more effective for someone like me.

He worked his ass off for 25 years providing and saving for him and his wife while his condition worsened.  He saved enough (while his wife blew her beautician pay on baubles and useless crap) to pay all cash for a very nice condo in our hometown, so she'd never have to worry about a place to live after he passes. All that plus a nice fat nest egg to boot.  So when his condition worsened to the point where he couldn't work any more (keep in mind he doesn't drink, smoke or imbibe in anything unhealthy and tries to stay healthy as he can) he draws enough disability that pays all their monthly bills. So she skates along, living off his dime, and again--spends her part-time income on baubles and useless shit.  However, instead of being grateful she'll never have to worry about having a roof over her head, food on the table and otherwise live comfortably for the rest of her life (after he dies, which won't be that long from now) she spews out hurtful, insidious insults like, ""you don't have to work!"" She's totally neurotic, completely uncaring and insensitive to the debilitating effects his progressive, muscle wasting disability has on him.   All she cares is he's gone from pulling $90k as a line technician to living on $30k of disability. To make matters worse, she doesn't let him have friends over anymore (me included) and won't let him do anything he wants. Last year we recorded a song together that actually came out sounding great. She went bat-shit crazy and became threatened he was actually having fun outside her direct presence.   But what can he do? He's screwed. If he leaves her or if he tries to put his foot down and she leaves him, its game over.

In the URL there may be no title. If there is it has &title= as the start of it. If you change this in the URL before saving it that becomes your file name.  With both keepvid & video downloadhelper I choose the format 3gp which is cell/mobile, highly compressed, audio is not super-high quality but for a monologue or conversation instead of music it's perfect.

HR will always pick the female candidate over a male candidate.  If there is a more lucrative position it will always go to the female.  A woman can leave the shift at any time if her child gets sick.*  Since there are more female workers than men in a hospital a man has to be careful what he says because he could be accused of sexual harassment at any time.    *Instead of calling in sick a woman will clock in for her shift and then immediately tell the manager she has to go home because her child is sick- this is done to avoid being counted as a sick day or absent.

I do, as a man, identify with elements of self-improvement (learning new things, fitness, etc.) and not making women the SOLE focus of one's life (just like women shouldn't make finding a man their sole purpose).      My dad is someone who needs a woman around to feel loved and doesn't quite understand my position.  There are a lot of men who are the same way, and women are a HUGE part of those men's lives.  So a movement that forms around men doing what they want and not being slaves to fatherhood and marriage is going to have a lot topics on women.  Women being the other half that allows fatherhood and marriage to even be a thing.  Does that make sense just a lil' bit?  With that said, when feminism started taking hold, was there not a lot of talk about how men behaved and how it affected women?  Yes, and that's still a thing (see: manspreading). If feminism's sole purpose was empowering females, I doubt there would be any way not to talk about men's behavior in some aspect.    Feminism has been pushing for men to ""open up"" and ""share their feelings"" since it's inception (men sharing feelings breaks down patriarchal assumptions that men should always be strong, right?). Movements that have formed around men sharing how they feel about society/relationships/etc. is a direct result of those pushes by feminists for men to open up, no? Well, sometimes that opening up might yield statements about certain traits and behaviors that women do, right.  Women are not beyond reproach, sorry.      Any person that fails to see the MRM as a direct result of feminism fails to make the logical conclusion that this is what feminism asked, and is asking for.  I see most inequities in the world as a result of the income/wealth gap between the richest and poorest (male or female).    I'm in favor of raising the minimum wage - something that would INSTANTLY close the often misued .77 cent pay gap ( since more women work in min. wage jobs).  A lessened military and a basic income would do far more for women (and really all of society) than fucking cat calling videos and weekly soap opera-like outrage fests about nothing.    I'm always in the bottom left quadrant of those political compass tests you'll find online, meaning I'm some kind of lefty anarchist-however, I don't whine and have all the social disorders and feminine personalities that leftist men seems to have in greater numbers.  I'm a broad-shouldered, beard wearing, wood tearing beast here do some some cool shit."

Keeping her around after she fails shit tests is a baaaaaaaad idea because you're permitting stupidity.  You're hoping you found a NAWALT. Let me tell you now: you didn't.  If you want a woman, you have to go PUA, date lots of women and pick your favorite. There is no other way to do it that's going to work out long term.  You're better off doing something short-term with this one woman, keep your nose CLEAN (use condoms and spermicidal lubrication), and consider her part of your intro to women and PUA."

There is no happy shade of gray between the 2 modes.  I suppose I need to clarify what I mean by PUA mode. I don't mean that suddenly he starts picking up truckloads of chicks. I mean he has to learn to seduce the woman and not fall prey to being seduced. Falling prey to female seduction can have serious consequences.  How can you tell if she's a seductress? How can you tell if you're being seduced? Here's some signs and red flags.   If she's older than you. If she has orbiters. If she's a single mother. If she's married. If she's goth. If she doesn't want kids and/or dislikes kids. (Most women that want kids almost always sit on their ass waiting to be seduced and aren't the sperm jacking nightmares we hear of. The better looking, the more they sit on their ass.) If she's not an 8, 9, or 10. If she's a stripper, call girl, or any kind of sex industry girl. If she appears rational.   A lot of guys in the pick-up community don't see when they've been seduced and have a lot of false positive bedpost notches. E.g., quotes from Seddit, ""Yeah, it was like I wasn't even doing anything and this chick totally wanted me."" Hella lols.  When you're seducing the woman, there's less risk and you're in control. It's not that PUA is a mess, women are a mess. PUA is the best shot you have at keeping it neat and tidy."
MGTOW,3dme8k,SoullessTechnocrat,3,Sat Jul 18 08:11:23 2015 UTC,Whatever; you can go roll around in filth if you want. PUA is a mess because it contributes to the mess. The only way to have no mess is to avoid women. End of story. You cannot be seduced if you don't talk to women; it's that simple.

But if you think MGTOW is some kind of protest movement that'll get women to shape up or government policy to shape up in your lifetime, you're high. We're not ""teaching them a lesson."" Even if there is a faction of MGTOW that is bent on teaching women and government policy ""a lesson"" (Hello, Sandman) it's not a lesson they're going to receive.  Perhaps ""PUA"" was the wrong word and maybe I should've used ""Venusian Artistry.""

He's there, but not really. His face is kind of distorted, and his eyes seem like he can't focus on me. He's actually trying to see me from the side, like a shark. ""Hey!"" he yells, too loud, and gives me a hug, too hard. He's fucking wasted.   And...   His penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand? So he was pushing aggressively into my thigh, and during this failed penetration, I looked around the room to try and distract myself or God willing, disassociate.   She has to dissociate because sex she wanted was some how traumatizing...   The only wetness between my legs is from his drool, because he's now sleeping and snoring into me. I sigh, I hear my own heartbreak, I fight back my own tears   Poor Amy.  To clarify, I don't believe that this was actually a rape, but this is what 3rd-Wavers would call rape if the tables were turned."

In fact, most high earning women surveyed, seek men who are in fact higher paid. While men are perfectly willing to marry women who are non-earners (or low earners), women almost uniformly seek to ""marry up"". While it's easy to make broad conclusions over the differing motivations of men and women (men apparently are quite okay with nothing more than a kind heart and a warm smile.

That's how they are, and MGTOW don't hate them, but we find their behavior to be toxic and repulsive.  There are many attractive MGTOWs that do a lot of rejecting. I'm not physically attractive (and I don't give a fuck) because 80% of the men are considered unattractive to women anyway. The majority of women want to fuck and have the babies of the 15% of men; the rest of the 5% are unfuckable. That said, even though I am unattractive, I will never settle for an unattractive woman, because she will be expect to be treated like a hot woman would be treated, while giving me nothing in return, no boners, and terrible, disgusting sex; and when Chad Thunder Cock comes with his best friend Brad Beefcake, she will give them the best sex her ugly ass can muster. Now that I learned about female nature, biology, and genetics, I will never want kids for multiple reasons, with the most important being that the future is not looking too great.  That's an altogether shit deal. Hot woman or not, these parasites are a pain in the ass. The hotter the parasite, the more shit I'd have to wade through to keep her and ""please"" her, before she eventually rapes my finances, humiliates me, and destroys my life."
MGTOW,3db7ai,thrownaway_MGTOW,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:36:09 2015 UTC,"You're not right, no.  As a matter of fact men with money who aren't attractive probably get a 60% pass and men who are thugs but not attractive again 40% to 60% just for being rough. A woman wants a soldier to hurt others for her bidding, it's a primal need"
MGTOW,3db7ai,SoullessTechnocrat,6,Wed Jul 15 06:28:48 2015 UTC,"meh, every girlfriend I ever had was when I was not working except the last.  And every girl I ever hooked up with would have fucked my life up enough I couldn't work regardless.  Women don't add stability to life. I've got stability, a job, a place of my own now. If I want to lose it all and be homeless the fastest way to do it is get a girlfriend. Already seen it happen to 2 guys at work, one lost his place and a lot of his stuff, the other lost his job too."
MGTOW,3db7ai,PartlyMe,9,Wed Jul 15 07:06:24 2015 UTC,Women are POWER HUNGRY. That's WHY they refuse to marry a man with no money. They all believe they are Cleopatra with millions of slave men at their disposable. Fuck that shit.
MGTOW,3db7ai,dfaer5,9,Wed Jul 15 10:41:06 2015 UTC,"I find the photograph -- of a rather old-ish (at least middle-aged), unkempt homeless man, not simply an ""unemployed"" man -- and the choice of it as the SOLE image to accompany this specific article to be interesting.  Especially since -- from the data that I am aware of -- statistically speaking the vast majority of ""unemployed"" (both here in the US and even more so in the more feminized/socialized places like Europe)... are in fact YOUNG men, often with at least college if not a degree or in fact multiple college degrees.  I mean what is the point they are trying to make with that specific photograph? That somehow THAT is the ""image"" all women visualize in connection with the phrase ""unemployed man""?  I mean are they trying to question or reinforce a stereotype?  And why -- later in the article when they discuss ""unemployed women"" -- is there no similar image of a female version of this?"
MGTOW,3db7ai,drkstrs,0,Wed Jul 15 10:31:46 2015 UTC,"I am extremely familiar with this author, Michael Snyder. The guy is extremely intelligent. He is a devoted Christian, but other than that, I agree with him on essentially everything. I had never read any articles by him about gender issues, and I must give Mr. Snyder a lot of credit for discussing this issue as an extremely religious man.  The photo is irrelevant."
MGTOW,3db7ai,VodkaTankerSpill,5,Wed Jul 15 16:43:32 2015 UTC,Saying the photo is irrelevent is like saying that the pictures of the holocaust that were taken of Soviet Troops in SS uniforms aren't relevant. Framing is a thing; quite an interesting one too.
MGTOW,3db7ai,moosevice_dot_com,2,Wed Jul 15 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"I guess I meant it's irrelevant to the credibility of the author.  Sure, it matters that the stereotype is such a person. But I mean, I guess I'm just not that optimistic. Feminists won't even admit that they won't date an unemployed man, even when they won't! So, how can we expect them to understand that their stereotypes of unemployed people are wrong also? I have zero hope."

MGTOW,3db7ai,dfaer5,13,Wed Jul 15 04:23:50 2015 UTC,"A big problem with MGTOW is that it's more of a revolt against feminism than a 'male liberation' movement. As such, MGTOWs feel the need to establish their SMV value in order to make their protest meaningful ('I'm depriving you of something valuable'), otherwise it would be analogous to a beggar boycotting Harrods. Therefore, you feel the need to mention your desirable phenotype ('decent-looking 6ft 2in') and socio-economic status. Men still feel the impulse to compete in the dominance hierarchy even when formally abandoning such pursuits. If a man was a midget who lived on welfare and declared himself to be MGTOW, he would be shamed even by the MGTOW community (consider, for example, the MGTOW treatment of incels and other low-status men)."
MGTOW,3db7ai,drkstrs,10,Wed Jul 15 12:35:37 2015 UTC,"SMV is irrelevant to MGTOW.  Whether high or low SMV, MGTOW makes sense because the gynocentric deal is bad either way."

Broad-brush statement. Apparently, you haven't heard of ""Ghosting.""    If a man was a midget who lived on welfare and declared himself to be MGTOW, he would be shamed even by the MGTOW community   That's again, a broad-brush statement that has no basis in fact or logic, i.e., impossible to back up."
MGTOW,3db7ai,oldredder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"Broad-brush statement.   I don't have a problem making generalizations about a certain demographic, as long as it's understood that there are exceptions. You're right that ghosts are an important exception, but the majority of MGTOWs still maintain some ties to society.    That's again, a broad-brush statement that has no basis in fact or logic, i.e., impossible to back up.    Not at all. Many (not all) MGTOWs have been extremely hostile to low-status men who attempt to adopt the label for themselves.   See, for example, some of the comments in this thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/2d1ypi/is_it_so_bad_for_an_incel_to_join_and_claim_mgtow/"
MGTOW,3db7ai,codemoney,6,Wed Jul 15 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"No we don't shame ""low status"". We don't even really recognize hierarchy...., but MGTOW, in my opinion, does not accept men who claim to be MGTOW because they can't get women.  Because it isn't about that.  If you can fine, if you can't also fine.  But...If women threw themselves at you every day you would then reject MGTOW WOULD mean you aren't MGTOW.  MGTOW would still place his own way above the golden unicorn itself and be able to walk away. This why its incorrect to think MGTOW cares about your supposed SMV.   Some mention that theirs is high to demonstrate to others  that the stereotype bar bar described as  being ""one blow job away"" from abandoning MGTOW isn't our way.   It's obvious that if you can but don't then the attitude or belief that we are somehow deprived is false."

If a man was a midget who lived on welfare and declared himself to be MGTOW, he would be shamed even by the MGTOW community (consider, for example, the MGTOW treatment of incels and other low-status men).   I'm not sure exactly who here would feel the need to shame a person such as you describe for the reasons you state..? Neither am I sure what you mean by ""the MGTOW treatment""?

Suitcases and shipping containers full of it. So even if men do nothing wrong, hell, even if they do everything right, the women will still be unhappy because she's assrammed hurt over something that happened years and years ago.. and not even with YOU.

MGTOW,3dc5ho,moosevice_dot_com,16,Wed Jul 15 20:41:13 2015 UTC,We need to stop asking women about how unhappy they are and realize that women love being unhappy.  We men make the mistake of engaging in conversation about why women are unhappy and what they could possibly want to make them happy.    Women crave the attention that comes from being unhappy or being a victim and love to complain.   Society worked perfectly when men allowed women to complain and nag and did not act on their complaints.   Nowadays society take every single thing that women choose to whine about as though it is the greatest threat facing mankind.  Q:   What do women want?

Of course they don't split because I have a little sister that was born later and they don't want the divorce to hurt us.

Secondly, set and maintain boundaries; tell her that you did not give her your phone number and that she's not welcomed to text you, etc.. You should have made your boundaries explicit and not talked about sex, for instance, but ""all is lost if the lesson is lost.""  Thirdly, in the case that you ended up getting a stalker; document (chiefly document your telling her that she is unwelcome, then, if she persists - document your telling her that continued unwanted contact constitutes harassment. Clearly explain what is unwanted). I hope that you did not catch a stalker, all the same, don't delete the texts, and document any stalking behaviors and warnings.  Fourthly, if you must, highlight the reasons you don't want a relationship or anything. A lot of stalkers are socially inept (hence the stalking), having your friend explain social cues to his sister might go a long way in clearing up her possible confusion.  I repeat; set and maintain your boundaries."

She hit him first, AFTER threatening him with a raised fist.  He acted in self-defense, and she got what she deserved.  I would have done the same thing.  It's called equality.  Fuck that violent bitch. He acted justly. It was a self-defence.  Edit: Gender equality doesn't mean the same results. It means the same opportunities. She punched him, why would he only slap her? If his puch was harder, it doesn't matter. It's a punch vs. punch. That bitch shouldn't complain now. She should have think it through before starting the fight. I believe women are reasonable, mature, and therefore should take the consequences of their actions. If this isn't a gender equality, I don't know what is.  The girl is 100% at fault here.  When are we going to start holding women accountable for their own actions and stop treating them like victims all the time, while vilifying men?  You can see that she saw him trying to get to the bar, and she slid in front of him, then she kept sliding over more to not let him in, and even turned around to say something to him, while he was saying ""excuse me"" to the other girl.  She then grabbed him first, and raised her fist in the air to hit him, so he grabbed her arm to stop her from hitting him.  Then when he let go, she still hit him anyway.  He acted in self-defense, and she deserved to get hit, and SHE should be the one charged with assault and battery, NOT him.  edit: nope, there isn't hope. his career is shredded  http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/13252899/dismissed-florida-state-seminoles-qb-deandre-johnson-apologizes  you can see she is kicking him in the groin around 0:20 sec  what a bunch of stupid cunts! it seems my anger/hate towards women is appearing again for a moment. think about it: how I can respect them if they are fucking getting away with everything and are above law?

This is a powerful force that MGTOWS face but eventually learn to ignore.

Many dogs do and this is how dogs and humans joined forces. Not as pets but as equal parties to a hunt, each doing what they're best at. Dogs can't use weapons, humans can't sniff out prey or a carcass like a dog and certainly a dog can hear way better than a human. A dog can eat raw meat where a human normally can't but a dog loves cooked meat in dinners so sticking with the human who does that also has a big payoff.

Many blue-pill men CHOOSE powerlessness by avoiding truth (I was there until I found MGTOW).  For MGTOW, truth is empowering.   One of the first truths every MGTOW comes to grips with is the pain, then ultimate acceptance of the fact that females are so exotically adept at manipulation, they themselves may not even be aware of it.

Game playing from a 5-10 year old is tolerable, from a grown woman it is more than annoying.       The horrible with money aspect was something I could never get past.  A lot of men and the vast majority of women are poor financial managers.    Its a real problem with the more attractive women that have had so much attention lavished upon them all their lives.      Over the years I would try and help my various girlfriends (and my own sister!) but failed every time.   They would tell me in all seriousness that they really, REALLY want to learn but when faced with the hard reality, the discipline and complexity (not to mention basic RESPONSIBILITY) of finance and money managment they would lose interest so fast it would piss me off that I actually put in the effort to help them in the first place.   I would set up simple spreadsheets, budgets, try to educate them on the principles of compounding, interest/dividends, income and growth investing, diversification, regular saving, risk/reward, 401K, IRA, Roth, etc...    to no avail.   I got used to the eyes glazed over look.    If you haven't learned basic money skills at a very young age it is tough.  I think deep down women learn from the time they are little girls that their ""white knight"" will bail them out.   Most wont admit it, maybe its so buried in the subconscious they don't realize it.   Why should they be practical?  Why get a degree in the STEM fields when psychology is so much more fun and less taxing.   Besides, down the road they will have their cake and eat it too.  They will be ""saved""."

I had this exact problem with my last ex; she started out acknowledging my points and listening.

Don't be that guy; ditch her now and stay away from all females. Because they're only going to do this for so long until you give them what they want."

Also, she's Hmong and they're raised to be good wives, cooking, cleaning and  showing men respect as the head of the house-- being white and dealing with white girls who view men as mops, this is a hugely strange transition. My GF will deliver me beer, buy my dinner every time we go out, surprise me with presents, support my race car hobby, and generally barely does anything I dislike. Additionally, she's got the libido of a catholic rabbit. But it really opened my eyes to how most girls (and especially white/black girls) are.

You know these players are out there and yet you still seem to fall for them. Of course a stable guy is no fun either because he's not constantly making you doubt your self as a person and a lover. Of course, the fact that you're in a relationship with a man does not mean that the world revolves around you all of the sudden. Despite what you may think, men are not all ""ME WANT SANDWITCH, BLOWJOB, AND SLEEPY SLEEPY"" We have dreams and goals, likes and dislikes, and are interested in doing a number of things that you may or may not like doing also. The point is that if you tie his enture existance to you, he will end up resenting that time together. That's why we either burn out or drop out!

Anything gambling related (sports betting, horse racing, greyhounds, casinos, lottery, bingo... you name it) in the UK is 100% tax-free. There's a lot of daily offers from bookmakers (free-bets/Bonus-Money/Free-Tickets...) so many people have started doing this for a living which ends up paying way more that a minimum-wage job. Since most gamblers are men (except for lottery/bingo of course) I like to call this the men's version of gov. benefits. And yes you can find all variation of blackjack and other card games online. I just did a blackjack offer last weekend with an EV of £90+. Ended up running good and made £190+ total ($300)"

Not that hard if you know were all those hyprocites hang around which are places where you should have no interest being in there in the first place. As a MGTOW though remember that all this is to be expected. As the Western society as become extremely feminized and Western men either consciously or unconsciously stopped giving a shit as they have nothing to fight for, other more 'masculine' run cultures will take over. It's inevitable. It happened before with the Roman Empire and probably in Babylon too. It seems like an ever ending cycle."

MGTOW,3dbhh5,1234thisismore,2,Wed Jul 15 04:38:42 2015 UTC,I've played online poker professionally before and it's definitely a worthy and liberating lifestyle.

MGTOW,3dbhh5,kjhefaekfobguo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:06:26 2015 UTC,I have dabbled with this but didnt commit alot to it since it felt like it was a very limited return overall. Ie you can only hit each booky once cant you and I do not want to be begging other people for their address and card details to run it again. I also wasnt comfortable giving out my driving licence etc to random sites. It was fun tho the couple times i did it and easy. I know on money saving expert they have alot of succes stories so maybe i was bieng paranoid about the giving detials. What you guys think? And how long can it be sustained? I also do affiliate marketing but alas havent reached a steady income in the several years ive been doing it (spurts and dorughts) so still need around 80 per week to top up.
MGTOW,3dbhh5,kjhefaekfobguo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:50:29 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all. I've completed my sign-up offers a long time ago and still make plenty of money. There are plenty of reload offers going on every week (especially if you're from the UK).   Take for example my last 2 months. As you know in June & July there are usually fewer sport events going on but I still managed to bag £2257 total (after mugging). This came mainly from the weekly channel 4 Horse racing offers, casino offers & the Copa America. I could have won way more but I was on holiday so I skipped a lot of the Tennis Wimbledon offers for example that could have bagged me another 1k+. The football season starts in a couple of weeks so there's going to be even more offers available every week ;)   If you're worried about regular profits then take Acca Refunds & CH4 Racing for example. These two alone run everyday and everyweek respectively and can secure you 2k a month if you put time into it.  Mind you that I have only used I account since I started. The only reason you would need another account (new details, address, etc...) is if you get limited or restricted by the bookmakers, which can be avoided if you learn how to take care of your accounts.   Of course you can double or triple your profits with more accounts if you're greedy :P but  I think 2k+/month, 2 hours a day doing offers and maybe another 2 looking after your accounts/statements/journal is absolutly perfect for a MGTOW, It gives you both social and financial freedom to enjoy your life the way you want to ;)   Check the PA link I've posted. I think it's the best site/community for updates on daily/weekly updates.  I also wanted to add that I have not had any problems with my personal details / bank cards with the sites I've signed-up with. Just stick with the recomended sites/bookies on the PA list and you should have no problems. I also advise that once you finish your sign-ups (or if you've already done them) you start using skrill or other moneybooker instead of your bank card as it saves you a lot of time with money transfers and your activity doesn't crowd up your bank statement."

Did married men live longer because:  A) they were married, which made their lives healthier and more fulfilled, which allowed them to live longer (which is what the spiel above seems to claim)   OR  B) did they live longer because being selected as ""marryable"" weeds out the unhealthy, the bad looking, the sick, and the weak?  (i.e., other things being equal, it isn't the very bottom of the gene pool that's getting hitched).  In this case, being married, and the stress that goes along with it, would reduce the life span of a man who would have lived longer unmarried?    We don't know, because there's no research on what the lifespan of ""fit, attractive, healthy men who never married"" is.    Scott Adams neatly pointed out what the major problem with this line of reasoning is.  It relies on the fact that A and B are observed to co-exist, therefore, A causes B.  It ignores the fundamental law of logic that ""correlation does not imply causation"".  B might cause A, just as easily, or A and B might be caused by third thing C."

I mean, it really is the natural goal of life, to procreate.   If men-women relation wasn't so fucked up, job and careers didn't suck so much time and modern society didin't take you away from your family (becouse you have to have a job, kids gotta go to school, mom might have a job too).

This is exactly why I think the majority of MGTOW will jump ship as soon as the first opportunity presents itself. By and large, men are incurable manginas who will stick their heads in a vise grip if it means pleasing women and accessing their uterus. What explains the current growth in MGTOW isn't some kind of widespread philosophical enlightenment, but 1) our being currently in a feminist gynocentric paradigm instead of a traditionalist gynocentric paradigm, which is bad for the male ego but identical in their outcomes, 2) various factors leading to fewer, worse jobs and thus the inability of men to provide for families as they did in the past. As soon as those trends reverse (and they always do), expect MGTOW to wither and die."

I don't see the misunderstanding. Procreate is the way we evolve ourselves. It is how we give our genes the chance to play the game of life one more time, and luckily, they will be perfect for some different society in the future. You're right, evolution doesn't have goals or purpose, but species does. And the natural goal of every species is to perpetuate itself in nature. Some species are parasites, some just divide themselves, and we need a female to put our sperm on. Though, nowadays you can rent a woman's womb, you don't have to marry or buy the whole girl to have an heir. That's a new paradigm, you don't need women to have children.  But I see what you're saying. MGTOW wouldn't exist, or at least it would be smaller, if we had a healthy society."

With that in mind, you can refute any argument from a Christian you don't like. Just say something like, ""Yeah, well the Lutherans I know have my side on this.""

Albeit well-intentioned, if you tell someone who's struggling with the anger stage that they ""should get over it quickly, already!"", that is tantamount to a shaming tactic.   In my experience (I've also actually done it myself, I'm sorry to say..), when a person is on a euphoric high from personal epiphanies, they wish to 'share' that new-found strength and can sometimes fail to recognise the uniqueness of every other man's path.   Yes, excessive or excessively-prolonged (raging) anger can and does interfere with living a joyous life. However, there's ample evidence that real life is often not joyous and that anger must be allowed to run its course, ideally with weekly visits with a therapist of the sympathetic AND non-coddling variety that will not support unnecessary victimhood but will acknowledge the existence of the feelings and allow space for them to be expressed without shaming you for doing so.   I sometimes think many people fail to realise that it is facing life's challenges, some of them extended and severe, that enriches us to the point where we can really appreciate such things as Freedom and Happiness. I'm not about 'rushing' any longer. There really is no need to rush things imo.."

MGTOW,3d5yhf,-Fender-,2,Wed Jul 15 05:28:27 2015 UTC,"It will be a very interesting social experiment. We'll see how the society they attempt to create over there will treat men.

If it's the latter, then society over there is probably doomed. Even moreso if they try to shame male sexuality like they do here."
MGTOW,3d5yhf,SoullessTechnocrat,0,Wed Jul 15 09:35:33 2015 UTC,I wouldn't count too much on feminism taking hold; nor on the shame of sexuality. It's too much of a 'we have to survive at any cost' situation to allow for that. Everyone will be needed to ensure that the work gets done; and you probably would have to allow men clemency in parenting and relationships since their refusing to work could put the whole society at risk. There wouldn't be anything like a wage gap; because colony resources must be shared to ensure the survival of the population.  Normally; I see that feminists only want to live in places where they can do make work and socially shame others. You can't do that somewhere as unforgiving as Mars.  But I highly doubt I'd ever get a chance to go; due to the manipulation of world events by certain people and not really having any skills that would benefit in a research station like that. My Mars One application hinged on my writing ability. (The travelogue was the first part of American Literature. Pilgrim's Progress and the like. And given that all communications would be under a 20 minute delay without the capacity to send video files; text communiques would be our only recourse. I've thought about this too much; as you can see.)

If that's not enough, there's a good chance it will get destroyed from the inside when someone will regret their decision to leave Earth. You can't even compare the risk to marriage, the first expedition (or maybe first few) will be suicide missions. Of course everything I mentioned assume that the trip and landing were successful. Don't try to romanticize it."

Occasionally some let a woman along for the ride, but it was always obvious who was in charge and they were generally too busy to bother with them 95% of the time.   Especially the generals, they just didn't have much time. Caesar is linked to a few but I don't know how much he could have seen them while busy studying and then at war.   Alexander the Great though, his history is pretty funny. It's pretty well known he shunned women, and his mother even hired a whore for him once because she was so desperate to have grandchildren. Aristotle generally considered carnal desires shameful, and of course Alexander was his student. Female historians seem desperate to make Alexander a womanizer or something though.

Now not being any kind of men's rights ranter I still see that if a Scotsman wants to go his own way & that includes wearing a kilt, for work or wedding or whatnot, it's a pain in the ass women do this.

MGTOW,3d4lmj,Morranaii,4,Mon Jul 13 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"Excellent article. Traditionalism really is the biggest con in history because it has created an environment in which the greatest honour and accolade for a man is to give up his resources and energy for other people who don't want to work (namely women). Some men actually take pride in being a good, submissive working horse and earning enough so that their women can stay at home doing the hardest job in the world.   It's funny (and a testament to just how effective this scam has been) to think that traditionalists and red pillers somehow misguidedly think that they are in control and dominant over their 'submissive' female partners when in reality they're slaving away to provide her with resources she has not worked for at their own expense. Of course women are all too happy to play along, and why wouldn't they be?"
MGTOW,3d4lmj,garbledcluster,3,Mon Jul 13 19:31:38 2015 UTC,"Some men actually take pride in being a good, submissive working horse and earning enough so that their women can stay at home doing the hardest job in the world.   yeah it's called by them as 'taking care of the family' which means working your ass out, escaping being in home because your wife always got something for you to do, kid is just a copy of her and always wants your attention, no time for yourself, buying her gifts to prove you love her, paying for everything from mortgage to her tampons plus even more for the kid.  Seriously, how small your balls need to be to believe that THIS PRISON IS ACTUALLY THE HIGHEST PURPOSE AS A MALE?!"
MGTOW,3d4lmj,garbledcluster,2,Mon Jul 13 19:52:25 2015 UTC,"Seriously, how small your balls need to be to believe that THIS PRISON IS ACTUALLY THE HIGHEST PURPOSE AS A MALE?!   I think limited exposure to other, conflicting ideas is the main culprit here. It's very hard for a man not to fall into this provider trap because that's really all he ever hears from infancy: that it's a man's job to work, earn and provide and that he should not complain but instead man up and get on with it. And this message drones on and on. The social pressure to conform to this stereotype can be very hard to resist for men, with even their fellow men quick to make fun of others who fail to be 'masculine' (useful to women). I'd say being MGTOW right now is comparable to being an atheist in the 16th century or so; very few people have these ideas because of how scarce non-mainstream narratives are, and even fewer dare to be openly out with them.   It's only recently that the dissemination of niche and non-mainstream ideologies has started gaining traction due to freedom of speech and anonimity on the internet."
MGTOW,3d4lmj,oldredder,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:03:29 2015 UTC,there must be an instinct component. It's never been my instinct to provide for others and I will not. For friends I will ensure I get future resources because of their abilities by helping them now in a time of need. Women won't do that for me. They refuse to be so useful or to return owed favours
MGTOW,3d4lmj,oldredder,3,Wed Jul 15 09:40:03 2015 UTC,"The MGTOW community is repeatedly asked how they can judge men who choose marriage because aren't they in favour of men choosing their own paths? And if a man chooses marriage then he is somehow still free. The usual response is that slavery isn't made okay because the slave gives up his freedom willingly. But why would a slave give up his freedom in the first place? Why do men, knowing the dangers, still choose to get married? It is a fear based behaviour. Those who believe marriage is necessary claim that the ritual of commitment somehow solidifies the relationship. They fear that their partner won't stay unless that ritual is performed. You can see the irrationality of this thinking, given how easy it is to get divorced. Marriage is a commitment “forever”. As if a devotee to the institution can determine the future by performing that ritual. This is magical thinking perpetuated by a desire to organize the chaos of life. Marriage is an immortality project, to be accomplished by binding yourself to something bigger than you. You think you are no longer alone. No longer vulnerable"
MGTOW,3d4lmj,drkstrs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe worse than fear. Maybe total irrationality. It's not long ago I saw both a man ruin his marriage (2nd) to cheat and the woman he's with also dumped her husband. They each have kids. For what? Romance? Sex? Anyone choosing to de-stabilize their marriages, much less get married, only to end up there hasn't done any long-term planning at all."
MGTOW,3d2j7j,scarredlife,22,Mon Jul 13 00:29:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't even get that love in my childhood. I guess that's why I learned quicker than most and avoided the marriage trap. By the time people came around insisting I get married, I'd already had enough and couldn't believe any woman would truly love a man for a few years, let alone a lifetime. Infatuation lasts maybe a few months max, right around 2 months actually from my best estimates."

I wonder whether I could really help one of my friends who became 500% manginated, his wife screams at him ,being abusive (in a 'smooth' way sometimes but sometimes openly commenting for example - his small dick- in front of others....lol can u believe it?)   he is also vegetarian from many years, living boring corporate life, and never going out, don't have any friends (except one with whom his wife slept with - and he was saying 'well I just want her to be happy'- what a dumbass!) - she also removed myself from his life, by brainwashing him I am the one who endangers their relationship (by speaking openly that I dont want marriage, kids, and basically MGTOW).   I can tell he don't enjoys being treated like that but he is too deep into this to be saved. After all, if his wife forced him to ditch our friendship because of her, and he wasnt able to stand up for it after so many years- then go to hell with him, lol"

You're a parrot. Your 'loving SO' told you men without 'loving SO' aren't worthwhile as people. Then you come and say it on the internet.  You didn't 'stumble here accidently'.

MGTOW,3d2j7j,Lonny_zone,19,Sun Jul 19 07:22:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it makes me feel free.  There are people who like me but I wouldn't say that I'm loved by anyone (not in any real terms). My father's dead, I'm estranged from my family, and (though I have friends) there isn't really that nurturing nor romantic (i.e. fantasy-based) love.  You could make the case that I have philia love, but I would call that conditional friendship (virtue-based love).  Not being loved, I can do whatever the fuck I want.  You're right about children getting love, and in the Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy/Albert Ellis sense - that's advantageous Albert Ellis (REBT) - Conquering the Dire Need for Love.  But there is something infantilizing about unconditional love as an adult, and the dire need for love is, well, not rational.  Children are supposed to experience individuation, after which love should become conditional in proportion to their level of autonomy. Everyone (upon individuation) is free to love whomever they want on whatever conditions they want (""want"" is a loaded term dealing with the very nature of the self, but that's a much deeper topic on the nature of the self than this post requires). Sufficed to say - you choose your values (as far as anyone can choose anything). How you value someone is up to you (and the reverse is true).  Unconditional love only has a place for those who cannot choose their conditions (and you could argue that free will is an illusion and that no one really chooses who they love, but, again - that's off topic). Basically, unconditional love is for children.  Children are not free, as we understand it - they are unable to give informed consent due to a lack of information and life experience.  I would rather be free, so to speak, than be stuck in a child-like state, suckling at the tit of a dispenser of ""unconditional"" love.  Ultimately (and counter-intuitively), being loved in such a way is... smothering... anything but liberating.  That's why, in The Manipulated Man, Esther Vilar likened men to slaves - it is a need from which one is best weened.  It's truly liberating to be unloved, and sometimes I even relish being the villain, so to speak. The world has so much ""wrong"" with it that sometimes the bad guy is, in fact, the good guy. I kind of feel like The Comedian, from Watchmen - it's an absurd joke, this world, and the hypocrisy of people. The ""red pill"" makes some people bitter, but it's just a ticket to the circus as I see it."

MGTOW,3d2j7j,Lonny_zone,2,Mon Jul 13 07:49:00 2015 UTC,"yess!!! I see your point. not being loved means not having any responsibilities, obligations, feelings of shame or guilt, or control! we tend to look for someone that 'will finally love us' yet being loved is nothing else but putting yourself in a cage and giving away the keys to your oppressor.. I mean - loved one. And becoming fully dependable on the 'tit of a dispenser of ""unconditional"" love'.   After initial high, there comes other stuff- jealously, 'what if's' (what if she stop loving me, what if she will betray me, what if she will get sick/die, what if I get sick/die, what if she don't accept me, what if I will lose her, etc etc and so on)"

He said that it must be my imagination or that his cat is under the bed. The second time I stood up to look outside (it was cold that evening) and saw how his cat was standing on the balcony looking at me with huuuuuge eyes, freezing and stuff.   I told his family and they let the cat back in. It would've spent a cold night outside if it wasn't for me. The cat doesn't know me very well, but immediately walked towards me to rub its head against my leg (Maybe as a way to say thank you?). It wasn't doing that the other times when I tried to pet it. When I was on my way to leave his place the cat came again to rub it's head against my leg.  Maybe it's projection that the cat was thankful, but it really felt heartwarming :)."

MGTOW,3d2j7j,Morranaii,2,Tue Jul 14 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"Obviously food is important but if you give a dog food AND act as his pack leader for let's say 5 years, if you give him less food or someone else starts feeding him he will still be very loyal to you.   You hear or see those instances when an owner dies and the dog gets all depressed and lays by his grave? The owner is no longer giving food but the dog is still very loyal to him.  You're very right that they were bred for that as it's also been bred into them by evolution but so have human feelings of love and empathy. Just because a parent is willing to give up their life for their child because it had been hard wired as the evolutionary ""correct"" thing to do doesn't make it any less loving or emotional."

A woman who loves you will still walk all over you, use you, and pretend you don't exist.  I know this is true, my biological family has done it to me.  They love me, so what?  A woman loves you...for your resources, as soon as your resources don't matter anymore, they still love you, but they don't have to be nice to you anymore.    In a word, they don't have to respect you.  Love doesn't matter with women.  Love is a fantasy.  The love of a woman is a glitch in the matrix, you see it, sometimes, but that only means something went wrong with the system.  Respect is the important thing.  She can hate me, so long as she respects me.  A woman who hates you, but who respects you, is infinitely better and more likely to make you happy than a woman who loves you and who doesn't respect you.  That's why assholes get laid.  Women don't love them, but they respect them.  That's why BB posts on r/relationships and r/deadbedrooms, women love him, but don't respect him.  She respects Chad, whom she let fuck her ass on the first night, not her BB who gets laid once a month because its the first and its time to put out.    A woman who respects her husband won't divorce him.  A woman who loves her husband, but doesn't respect him, will divorce him.  Its female nature.  If the women in your life don't respect you, then you need to stay away from them as much as you possibly can.  Nothing good happens when you spend your time around women who don't respect you.  You will get walked over.  You will get abused.  It will happen.  She won't show up when she's supposed to, she'll show up for the man she respects the instant she's supposed to.    At least by staying away from her, and keeping your distance, you might make her respect you when she figures out how much harder her life is without you in it.  Fat chance, but its your best bet.  Women don't love opportunistically, but they respect opportunistically, and respect is the important thing.  A marriage where the wife doesn't respect her husband is going to fail.  A family where the women don't respect the men is going to drift apart."

MGTOW,3d2j7j,PartlyMe,4,Mon Jul 13 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"Do you know what truly gets to me?  When you treat a pretty girl just like you treat everyone else, she thinks you're being mean.  About a month ago, I went to get lunch at my favorite deli.  There was a new asian girl behind the counter.  Young, hot, cute, the kind who doesn't have a problem getting a date on Saturday night.  I made my order, and I needled her a bit about her job, essentially told her I wanted my order done right the way I wanted.  There are people who work at that deli, who have seen me come in for years who know I'm demanding, but who know I tip well (I'm not unappreciative when things get handled right).    Two days later, I come back in, and a guy I know whose worked at that deli for three years tells me ""the new girl thinks you're mean"".  I treated her exactly the same way I treated everyone else whose ever worked there.  The difference is, she's cute, so she's not used to it.  Its a relative thing.  She's had men giving her a pass all her life.  She's had boys who were willing to do her homework just to talk to her.  None of the rest of them think I'm mean or a harsh.    Attractive girls are swimming in validation.  Its as crucial to them as the air they breath.  When you cut off the validation, and you make demands of them (""get my order right and don't screw up"") they don't know how to react, anymore than they know how to breath without air.  Attractive girls, when they struggle taking an order, don't know how to react if a customer complains that they screwed up.  When you're that young, and you've been raised as a ""special snowflake"" from the moment you were born, no one else has ever treated you differently.  Its fun to watch it sometimes."

MGTOW,3d2j7j,Morranaii,3,Tue Jul 14 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"You want to know what the most fucked up part of that whole thing is?  BP me would have apologized as soon as I was told that she thought I was mean.  BP me wanted every single person in my life to think well of me.  Starting to unplug me doesn't care what she thinks.  You know what I did when the vet told me that the new girl thought I was mean?    I called her on her shit.  I demanded to know, in front of everyone, what I had done to make her think that way.  I asked other people who worked there what they thought of me.  No one said anything bad.  I made it clear to her that she wasn't a snowflake.    You would think that she would never want to talk to me again after that.  That everytime I came in, she would spit in my sandwich or something.  The opposite happened, she calls me by name every time now, she smiles when I walk up, she says hi and asks how I'm doing.  She takes my order very carefully, and on more than occassion, she's tried to flirt.  The RP is right: women respect men who respect themselves.  She's never been treated that way by another man, ergo, she figures that if I am treating her like everyone else, I am high value.    Its an easy calculation for her to make.  All the men she's known who come and dance to her every beck and call, they want her.  The guy who doesn't want her MUST be higher value than the ones who do.  Women always want most what is denied to them.  That's why dread game works.    The reason its hard to unplug is because you think the dynamic between men and women works on mutual give and take.  We've all heard ""compromise"" and ""communication"" as being the secrets.  They aren't.  Ever since I found RP, I've started using RP concepts casually, and the thing is, they work.  Every time I find they work, that gives me more confidence the next time.    That new girl at the deli, but telling her co-workers she thought I was mean, and then having the guy whose been there awhile tell it to my face was a huge shit test.  Do you back up, apologize and curl into a ball like a good little Beta, or do you call her out on her shit?  Intuition, that men are coached with from birth these days, is the former, the correct answer is the later."
MGTOW,3d2j7j,PartlyMe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:17:11 2015 UTC,"agreed. so how do you explain that one girl that was into me (and which I 'denied') instead of starting to chase me more- just ignored me? does that mean she wasn't that much into me (or was looking for another idiot to chase her while she gets the benefits of it?) or that she was somehow toxic/crazy/not-normal/with very low self-worth?  I'd say the latter is true.  ""compromise"" and ""communication"" as being the secrets. They aren't  agreed too. they aren't as women never compromise and they don't know how to communicate (the moment you start arguing with woman you lost, because they operate on emotions and we- on logic, so she'll do everything to derail your logical arguments)  also, she respects you now because you 'call her out on her shit' - just like dominant father would do to her. that probably gave her vag-tingles haha. what a crazy species they r."

Is a biochemical reaction made within yourself. Hollywood and Disneyland bullshit, has told us of the concept of ""the one"" which is the lie. We have been sold a lie that the feelings of love come from someone else. Its a self made feeling.

MGTOW,3d2j7j,oldredder,7,Mon Jul 13 15:23:44 2015 UTC,"Men do not love unconditionally either, but their conditions are often very few in number and, most importantly, vary wildly. Men can find almost any physical or mental aspect of a woman to be deserving of intense love. Just think about the huge variety in men's preferences or the endless amount of different fetishes men have. Women are pretty universal and firm in their preference for assertive, tall men. Men do not have an absolute ideal."
MGTOW,3d2j7j,Litnire,3,Mon Jul 13 08:24:19 2015 UTC,true. we can even love ugly women by thinking something like 'ok she is so ugly nobody ever loved her I will show her how it is to feel when one is being loved and finally I will bring her happiness' lol.
MGTOW,3d2j7j,oldredder,6,Mon Jul 13 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of the $64,000 questions in life. The way I've dealt with / am dealing with this question is by means of a gradual re-appraisal of what 'love' means to me. In my pre-RP days I used to use the term 'love' as a blanket term for any deeply positive sense of myself / my value (satisfaction) I gained from a woman..  Some of the possible 'satisfactions' that are available from people (not exclusively women and, indeed, most genuinely from men) around us include ""admiration"" and ""respect"". When a man feels that his behaviour is admired and / or respected by others, his sense of satisfaction runs very deep and is akin to feeling 'loved'.   Men who experience feeling loved by women are very fortunate if that feeling never turns sour. This 'good fortune' itself is a function of how well they maintain an alpha frame throughout their relationship. If they are 'natural alphas' who don't have to work hard to maintain frame and dread game etc, they are the ones most likely to experience consistent love from a woman. However, as countless posts in r/deadbedrooms, r/relationships and r/theredpill prove, a woman's love for a man is not for him but rather for what he offers / provides, emotionally and materially and she can and frequently does withdraw that 'love' just as soon as she feelz that she's not getting what she's entitled to. This means that, in order to maintain a successful LTR in which a man experiences being loved, he MUST maintain frame, dread game, cocky-funny etc and MUST NOT display any emotional characteristics (weaknesses in her mind) that make her think she no longer has an alpha male. Basically, women have to be managed correctly if you want to feel loved by them. This requires a lot of work if you are not naturally 'alpha' in this way. Once a man realises the degree to which he CANNOT simply relax and express himself any way he needs around his woman, for fear of drying her up and losing her, he either embraces RP wisdom and gets over it or becomes deeply depressed and feels worthless.   Moving beyond all this is, IMO, all about re-evaluating our expectations of life (and women in particular) so that we finally accept the reality of women's nature and move beyond our deep disappointment and disillusionment at the lies in the fairy tale we have been sold since childhood, and find our own way...  I really do tend to agree that men are often seeking, subconsciously, a mother-figure in a woman whereas women are seeking a father-figure in a man. A man desperate for a mother figure could be called a simp and is unlikely to inspire a woman; a woman looking for a strong, guiding father figure is going to appear cruel and ruthless to a male looking for a gentle, loving mother figure. Part of the problem is that women are clever enough to use 'loving behaviour' in the early part of a relationship in order to get what they want by giving the man what he wants. She often soon comes to despise him for it, however, and quickly withdraws the loving behaviour.   At present, I'm satisfied with hard-earned self-respect and admiration through work and high quality associations with a few good people that share my outlook.."

I really do tend to agree that men are often seeking, subconsciously, a mother-figure in a woman whereas women are seeking a father-figure in a man  yes! and that's why they never feel satiated and satisfied. especially as almost nobody got NORMAL parents, we've all had some kind of issues. oh shit were screwed! :D  clever enough to use 'loving behaviour' in the early part of a relationship in order to get what they want by giving the man what he wants.

MGTOW,3d2j7j,teeay,8,Mon Jul 13 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"I think that we're in a unique spot because the only ones that can truly love a disposable male, is the philosopher male, because a warrior-male would grow up to detest weakness, whereas the philosopher-male will grow up to understand weakness as an intrinsic part of our humanity, the reason why an athlete trains hard is that he believes himself weak, the reason why a painter perfects his art, is because he see's it flawed, and it was Da Vinci himself that said that art is never finished only abandoned.   Males have this strange capacity to love all of man-kind, I don't know what it might be called but I've been calling it a 'dual capacity for love' since we are the only ones that can love both a weak male and a weak woman, but the only way a male can arrive to this is through a lot of philosophical consideration, because a warrior-male (which is where society pushes males towards) will quickly learn to detest weakness.  I do believe we can be loved unconditionally (or get pretty close to it), but I do think it's something that requires an existential mind, and considering that most people are slaves to instinct, this becomes a very rare and precious jewel. One is much more likely to find it in a male than in a woman since we come from weakness to find our merit, but it's right there that we wish that we could have been loved in weakness, but in real beauty, we can project this desire unto those below us, and perhaps there will be less misery in this world if we can learn to hone something like that."
MGTOW,3d2j7j,Morranaii,3,Mon Jul 13 09:24:24 2015 UTC,"A true warrior doesn't need to detest weakness, merely accept it's a part of nature - the start of life is in weakness and so is the end.  To be weak at the wrong time is simply inappropriate."
MGTOW,3d2j7j,teeay,3,Mon Jul 13 01:25:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is that power has a tendency to corrupt, if you strive to harden yourself, to put efficiency at the foremost of your desires, you slowly learn to despise your weakness, you'll begin to hate the inefficiency of others and especially of yourself.   We're weak at all times, by virtue of our humanity, a governing fear behind most of our desires is a gross inefficiency, through which we desire to become perfect, this vulnerability governs our chief desires and because it is an intrinsic part of our being, it is the part that we need to love the most.   This sort of philosophy is in a lot of stories because in a good story a good character is a flawed/weak character, it's through their tribulations that we empathize with them and wish for them to succeed. A perfect character is a boring character because without any flaws we're unable to empathize with their humanity, they become more like machines than humans, but weakness leads us into feeling sadness, which leads us into appreciating the character for their humanity."

To desire to be loved is weird because it sounds like you're setting up a one way street type scenario. But if you do want to love someone as well, then you want your affection to be returned. You can't always have this, sometimes for reasons you can't control.  But to improve your odds of having your feelings returned and eventually being loved is possible to do.  But the problem is when the investment of time and effort to do so surpasses the value of the result for a given person. The most cost effective method being to meet as many people you find attractive as possible. But then you just become another ride on the carousel, another free dinner, another bee on a string trying to gather pollen from plastic plants.

The whole conditional versus unconditional ""love"" thing, fuckit OP. The map is not the territory. I honestly feel this way about moral objectivism versus moral relativism. We like to talk about things to fit them into our brain so we have a formula so there are no surprises. So when we're in the territory we can say, ""Yes, this matches the map completely."" No matter how hard you try, you'll never get an accurate enough map. It is the nature of the map to not be the territory.  All that said, unconditional love is generally from mothers to their children. That's where the feeling of unconditional love comes from. Mothers get waves of oxytocin in their system when they're around their own children and sometimes even children in general. (Some will even lactate in the presence of babies that aren't even their own.) This is why single mothers suck as parents because they have unconditional love for their children and they let them get away with murder. This is why children fear their fathers when their father comes home at the end of the day. They got away with murder all day long and then the father comes home and has to instill reality.  If you're crazy enough to give up MGTOW someday and want to look for a woman to procreate with, go for a woman who stops in her tracks to go ""aww"" when she sees babies in strollers. She'll be a good mother and she'll definitely need a man."

MGTOW,3d2ma8,Isaiah4verse1,3,Mon Jul 13 13:34:19 2015 UTC,"It breaks my heart   It might be useful to discuss idiot compassion here. You can find lots about online; I'm going to excerpt a bit from https://enlightenmentward.wordpress.com/2010/04/28/manifestations-of-idiot-compassion/ :   Compassion involves being openly engaged with others and a setting aside of the ego. Compassion comes from a place of equanimity, a clear place from which necessity can be discerned.    Idiot compassion, on the other hand is a result of self-engagement using another as a prop in our own emotional drama and for our own egoistic fulfillment.    Idiot compassion is the highly conceptualized idea that you want to do good to somebody. At this point, good is purely related with pleasure. Idiot compassion also stems from not have enough courage to say no. (From Chogyam Trungpa)    It is interesting that he used the phrase “do good to somebody.” rather than “for somebody”. And Trungpa Rinpoche certainly knew enough about semantics not to have stated it that way by accident. Doing something “to somebody” implies an outside force or an infliction and imposition upon them rather than an alleviation of their situation.  idiot compassion, which is compassion with neurosis, a slimy way of trying to fulfill your desire secretly. This is your aim, but you give the appearance of being generous and impersonal. (From Chogyam Trungpa)     I have also seen idiot compassion described as efforts to ease your own discomfort at a situation, rather than an actual desire to help another being.    So when you want to help someone because they make you cringe, maybe it's the cringing that is unpleasant and which you want to deal with, not the situation of the person making you cringe. (Or maybe emotionally to not cringe, but with an intellectual overlay of how you're doing it for the dude making you cringe or society or whatever.)"

Other options within the Matrix, entangled in the rules of society and its lawless nonsense opposite to self-sufficiency, are possible but incredibly risky.

If you speak the ugly truth then there's going to be  discomfort, there's just no way around that."

MGTOW,3crv3d,drkstrs,2,Fri Jul 10 10:00:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not the most experienced MGTOW here but here are my thoughts:  At first I was gonna argue that there really isn't a good way to introduce it. MGTOW at its core is a cynical philosophy and with cynical philosophies the best time to introduce them/the time people will be receptive to them is when they are in tough/sad situations. The way you handled it was perfectly fine.   Then, I started to think more about this. The positive aspect of MGTOW is that it is supposed to instill a sense of self-confidence in men. MGTOW is about doing what you want, going on your adventure, and not compromising yourself for things society tells you you ought to do. The best way to introduce this thinking to others imo is to insert nuggets of truth here and there to get a person more and more receptive. For example, some friends of mine joke about their singlehood in order to cope with it. Whenever it is brought up, I joke around with it too but I make sure to tell them ""Hey doing your own thing is great also. You shouldn't try to rely on others as a crutch for your happiness. You will never find contentment in life doing something like that."" I don't know if they listen but us MGTOW have to be like ads. We have to keep on repeating the truth until it gets stuck in our friends' heads (just like how when you keep seeing an ad it ends up stuck in your head). That is my 2 cents at least."

With rational thought we provides a very concrete base of facts for new users and a very hard platform for our critics to denounce us with.   (Once we reach critical mass and we become popular enough that everyone knows our rational it will be hard for feminists to simply denounce us as misogynists if we continue to be rational)  The reason why we all choose to go our own way was because of the cold hard truths about modern day relationships. What lead me to MGTOW was that I had rationally concluded the true state of marriage in the U.S., and MGTOW's use of facts, not hatred, confirmed this further. So long as we don't slip into the emotional wreck of the ""hive mind"" op mentioned we cannot be discredited.   TL;DR Stick facts and rational thought.

MGTOW,3crv3d,ShitfacedBatman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:46:05 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but I disagree with all of what you say here. After all, if men were rational there would be no MGTOW, as all men would be MGTOWs.  Most people are not rational at all. About loads of things. But especially about sex. I think you may be able to convince men to give up on most aspects of status culture and live as free beings, except where women are concerned. In my experience very smart people simply shut down and stop listening when you start talking about differences between men and women. Or more accurately, when the conversation starts to take a turn away from the general and towards the personal of how men should respond to women. I know plenty of people who would agree with us over divorce courts favouring women, and also how divorces (usually initiated by women) hurt children, but their eyes glaze over when I suggest that they should factor this into assessing their relationships.  To be a MGTOW you either have to be a) really burned or b) really really rational to a crazy degree.  To the OP: I wish your friend the best of luck, but I think there's a good chance he's going to learn this lesson the hard way. All you can do is be there for him."

You're bickering:   I am NoFap and I am not a missionary ;P   If you could maybe state why you don't believe your actions make you a missionary in your pursuit of /r/nofap, then maybe it might help others see your perspective.  Generally people in /r/mgtow are quite factually based.  For instance, we don't pursue women or marriage because it's demonstrateably financially and socially crushing for men to do so.  We might date or have sex if someone tries to be more down to earth or approachable with us (ex. NAWALT), with the right securities (vasectomy, PRD's, Dash-Cams, storing valuables, etc) but we wouldn't follow through any further with that because of the financial earthquake that will likely follow.  A common complaint about /r/nofap is that their supporters often claim that going for prolongued periods on the order of years makes people better.  This is why it looks like you're missionaries.  Whereas a reasonable person might be able to say ""Well I'm on vacation in the bahamas for 2 weeks.  Yeah I can probably masturbate at least once during that break, and I'll still have lots of energy!""  That's why /r/mgtow thinks you're a missionary."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,danonymous2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:21:59 2015 UTC,"If you could maybe state why you don't believe your actions make you a missionary in your pursuit of /r/nofap, then maybe it might help others see your perspective.   sure but first can you explain what do you mean by being a missionary? because maybe our understanding differs here.  I don't claim nofap makes people better, not more than not drinking alcohol or not smoking or ... you got my point? It all depends. I only share my own opinion based on my own experience.  Which is this: As probably most young males, I was watching porn and masturbating to it without much thinking about whether it can do any harm. Sometimes it was once per week, sometimes 3 x per week and sometimes once per two weeks. But it was always there, since I remember.   Now, when I grew up, there was no broadband internet. I started with VHS (lol). Now, teenagers are having bad approach not only to women, but also to their own sexuality. Their brains are wired to porn images and they are increasingly suffering from erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation when they eventually go to bed with women because of damaged stimulation - both physical and mental - from porn. This is bad also for women because it has some influence on them (becoming more and more slutty and 'easy')  Saying that someone need to masturbate to porn in order to relax really isn't anything to be proud of.   If you do it from time to time, and you think you don't have issues with it- then fine. But again, addicted alcoholics are often not even capable of realizing their own addiction problem.  So that is why I recommend the very best test- set a date, long enough to be sure that your 'habit' is properly re-wired in the brain - I guess it has to be at least 50-60 days. For some people it can take much longer.   But my point is this: if pornography has bad influence on you, you will notice this during that period - irritation, mood fluctuations, cravings for porn .. and so on. You can read about it all on YOU BRAIN ON PORN website (which I found out at some point, also watched the famous TED talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU - this isn't some BS story, it's a factual science)  I personally meet several people who HAD this problem with porn. And they even didn't realized it was porn causing other issues - mood instability, feelings of shame and guilt that lead to being afraid of women (last thing any MGTOW want, right? we can ditch them, but we cannot be afraid of them!)  As for me the results were very good- I went through strange period of depression, mood swings and finally becoming much more energetic and happy. And yes, there were also days when my dick was 100% dead, and days when it was hard too many times it should ;) Then it all balanced itself out. Turned out somehow my (even) average use of porn had bad influence on my dopamine reward system in the brain. Because that's exactly what porn use is doing to everyone. Our brains generally work in the same way. No exceptions here. Addiction patterns and reward/punishment systems are the same with every human being. Might work for you, might not.   My point is that it is worth trying and if one never tried how it is to live as an mature man without porn for a rather funny period of 2-3 months, then well.. someone can have a problem.   Other 'symptom' is when someone suggest that you can have a break from porn and you react aggressively, defending that you don't need it etc. which often is just deep down hidden fear of losing your 'drug'.  Hope I explained it well this time :)"
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,2,Sun Jul 12 20:33:27 2015 UTC,"I just watched the video... it's not very good science.   Claims that porn is evil, while ignoring the elephant in the room:  Masturbation?  Or even SEX?  Because if you were paying attention, in the first 60 seconds they were talking about physical females producing the same issue in other animals. If SEX can produce the same dopamine issues (i.e. the ""Same Sheep""), then what are you holding up for, if it's only going to lead to the same proposed problem?  Or are you trying to create artificial scarcity because you don't think you can handle an over-abundance of dopamine? Have you considered that the results you're seeing might actually be correlation instead of causation?  That people finding other hobbies or working out, or eating different might be what's helping their dopamine levels?  Ex. mechanical hobbies are good for mathematicians -- yet they haven't ruled this kind of possible cause out. Of course porn causes the same hormonal responses in the brain as drugs (i.e. ecstasy!).  SEX causes the same hormonal response in the brain as drugs, yet people don't go around saying ""sex is bad because ecstasy is bad and they produce the same brain patterns!""   Most of this is pretty bad.  I mean, sure you can make a claim against things that produce dopamine, in many respects the kind of hormonal response people get by looking at reddit can be construed as equally bad -- except people don't outright stop reading the news because it produces dopamine!  They also use extremely small sample sizes to argue that not exposing yourself to porn (perhaps they meant masturbation, or sex?) increases productivity and liveliness, even though they only took SUBJECTIVE RESULTS, which is an absolutely no-no in good science!  Obviously abstaining from SEX will make you horny.  But that doesn't necessarily make you more productive.  What if you're in a line of work that helps to have less testosterone and more dopamine?  And, of course, we have to bring this up in /r/mgtow:   All of this applies only if you're trying to please a female, when they do NOTHING GOOD FOR US.  (Our beef mostly has NOTHING to do with the sex!). I loved the part where they were talking about a ""bond"" being so important in sex,   whereas you can look at /r/TwoXChromosomes and find the exact inverse applies to their sex drives.  (In an emotional bond, women get LESS TURNED ON.)   In short, this guy is a fucking tool and he doesn't even realize it.  I masturbate daily to help me fall asleep from all the stress in my life (i.e. hormones!), I collect terabytes of porn that I don't think I'll ever get through, and I have never had issues impressing someone.  However, being that this is /r/mgtow, they CERTAINLY have issues impressing me, and it has nothing to do with sex or physical pleasure, and everything to do with women being reckless and non-confidable when each party has so many hormones involved.  There are literally zero venues to bond with a woman without getting fucked over by them in our culture, to the point where I no longer have any use for my dopamine levels, outside of porn and GFE's.  THAT is probably the most logical response I can think of to this pseudo-science.  To each their own - but if you feel you need dopamine to be a utility to entities external of yourself all the time, then /r/mgtow may ask you when does your 'vacation in the Bahamas' ever start, if at all!  =P"

I am not saying (nor are they) that dopamine producing activities are bad. They aren't. It's about the amount and frequency combined with strength of influence. Reading reddit does not produce dopamine high combined with orgasm and other stuff produced during masturbation when you're watching teen orgies on the screen.   You need to produce dopamine to be alive, if your brain stopped with it you'd be dead. It's not about dopamine production dude.  It's also not about 'sex is bad'. It can be bad, can be overused and you can be addicted to it. Or to sex combined with drugs etc.  But the issue is this: how many of us have sex 7 times per week, 3 times per day - or more? Well as I've already said when you hit your 30s, this frequency goes heavily down. Also, it is not about 'sex is bad' but about negative impact addiction to pornography has on you mentally and physically - your performance in bed (PE/ED) and so on.  Besides, this video is just the tip of the iceberg. If you want more pure scientific papers, please check links on YBOP website. I don't have time now to look through it for u.  What if you're in a line of work that helps to have less testosterone and more dopamine? like what? gimme an example pls  And no, sex not necessarily needs to have 'pleasing female' in mind.

Answer this: wouldn't you rather be able to fall asleep without having support in means of having terabytes (good lord! ;) ) of porn and masturbating daily?   Because - you know - it's not very normal to not be able to fall asleep without fapping!  being addicted to it has nothing to do with women, it has everything to do with your own brain and yourself. and while I can understand doing it when you're still very young, the more mature you are the less you 'should' be doing it - if not, then you might have a problem. this is what I am trying to say.  here are literally zero venues to bond with a woman without getting fucked over by them in our culture  yes, I agree however does that mean we all should fap to movies of women being fucked by someone else on screen?  of to this pseudo-science it's not pseudo-science dude, you're just rationalizing your behaviors. but don't worry, I've been there too. :)  to end this- do whatever works for you man, don't judge- and for me yes, no fapping means more effort than fapping, because its fucking easy to go on with dopamine rush when watching porn, it's easy to go on some random porn hub, it's all too easy. too easy reward, for nothing. at the end, makes you more weak. especially if you're doing it daily. how you can know the other way if you never tried it, though?  and for me MGTOW means putting effort into something. If the only thing I gain from no fap is just a strong will and confidence that I decide, not some stupid habits, then it is worth it."

The burden of proof is on you.  You are proposing a theory that all porn is bad by observing vague relationships between dopamine and other bodily functions, even though your conclusion is to this point, is unsubstantiated.  You said so yourself that a certain threshold of sex 'can be bad' as much as any over-exposure to dopamine can be bad -- yet you're rationalizing your conclusion that all fapping is bad by purposefully ignoring that all thresholds have points where their limits are not met.  In doing so you're selectively ignoring that such a threshold defines both a limit where one could fap 'too much', and a limit where one can still fap, and have practically no negative reprocussions on their body.  You're ignoring that massive oversigght in /r/nofap 's thinking, and I'm asking you why your behaviours (and really /r/nofap 's for the matter!) - aren't taking this into account.  This is why /r/mgtow is calling you a missionary, and why I rhetorically suggested that your ticket to the Bahamas' is never being used.  As for your question:   Ok dude. Answer this: wouldn't you rather be able to fall asleep without having support in means of having terabytes (good lord! ;) ) of porn and masturbating daily?   I have a very intellectually demanding and mentally stressful job where I need to keep my hormones in check.  I can be a little testy when stressed, but I really don't have any room to take it out on others.  That needs to show up in my work output, and agressive hormones don't help when you're trying to keep focus.  Nothing about that is natural, but fapping to help fall asleep has far better long-term consequences than using something like sleeping medication for people that are over-worked.  I also use porn as a learning motivator.  I enjoy collecting and learning about the technology involved in getting it efficiently, without even having to look at it until I feel like it.  Storing it.  Or even downloading it for me while I leave the house for 6 hours.  It's fun and rewarding.  Truth be told, I'm actually into softcore.  Not so much sex, mostly because it's EXTREMELY tough to fake an orgasm or any form of pleasure in front of me without me noticing, because I tend to be more vested in people than erotica."

Besides, what exactly is 'recreational use'?  I have a very intellectually demanding and mentally stressful job me too! and the years when I was escaping or relaxing myself through porn and fapping were the most miserable- I was all the time without energy, burned out, somehow more shy that I am now. For me it was a very clear connection between these two factors.  Nothing about that is natural, but fapping to help fall asleep has far better long-term consequences than using something like sleeping medication for people that are over-worked  Agreed, but its like saying 'its better to smoke marihuana every night rather than inject heroin'  Maybe the core of the problem lies in changing work, and not exactly using something like masturbation and porn in order to cope with stress, hm?  That needs to show up in my work output, and agressive hormones don't help when you're trying to keep focus  that's regrettably a sign of our times  I also use porn as a learning motivator. I enjoy collecting and learning about the technology involved in getting it efficiently, without even having to look at it until I feel like it. Storing it. Or even downloading it for me while I leave the house for 6 hours  very useful skill indeed ;)"
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,-4,Sat Jul 18 23:15:05 2015 UTC,You weren't giving fierce arguments. You were pushing your ideas onto other people without really listening and taking into consideration what they had to say.

MGTOW,3cvs5c,BedHeadd,-3,Sat Jul 11 17:10:09 2015 UTC,"I was trying to start a debate about it, not a flame war. And I wasn't pushing NoFap on anyone, but rather putting it in a different light."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,vtfsobnf,5,Sat Jul 11 16:30:22 2015 UTC,NoFap was worthless to me. I was never addicted to beating off so when I did nofap for over 100 days I didn't notice any benefits.
MGTOW,3cvs5c,tomysotomayorfuxboys,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"THIS.  I'm exactly the same way.  I've never needed to recharge, and porn is often a motivator for me (It's a fun hobby for me to collect, and I do actually learn a lot technically while doing that!)"
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,5,Sun Jul 12 19:33:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I tried it before.  It was an interesting idea initially, but I found that it was doing the opposite of what I wanted and was counterproductive.  I couldn't focus on anything and had more pent up frustration, than if I just moderated myself without completely stopping cold turkey.  Also many of the members there emphasize becoming independent of porn and masturbation, only for the purpose of getting into a committed relationship.    The major issue I have with it is that for the validness of teaching self-control and discipline.  They also throw in much of their own ideals as well.  So for someone joining who is relatively young, their minds are more malleable and are much more susceptible to becoming indoctrinated into that group.  At that point the individual isn't really thinking for themselves anymore and is accepting any advice that comes along.  So if it's working for you and really improving your life, by all means continue.  I just think that the two subreddits are exclusive to each other and don't really overlap."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,tomysotomayorfuxboys,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"Fantastic comment, thanks.   I agree that they probably are exclusive to each other, but I had a feeling that, for some people, they could overlap and work to benefit the person. I can also see how they use NoFap to get in a relationship, that's a pretty hot topic over there. In the way I use NoFap it's not for that, but to each his own. Thanks again for the comment, have an upvote."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,8,Sat Jul 11 16:07:13 2015 UTC,I do nofap because it suits my lifestyle. However this is MGTOW; whatever you want to do go ahead and don't let anyone get in the way.

Are there things that have benefitted you in the way NoFap has benefitted me? Have you tried it? I'm open to any ideas, and you just might change how I feel about NoFap.   Because I tried it and it brought out my inner beta / white knight / mangina. I became obsessed with sex like I was 11 again and just discovering women.  Secondly, it's stupid. It's important for male prostate health to get daily sexual release. There isn't a group of people out there that pride themselves on not taking a shit. But it's the same thing. It's a biological function where no shame should be attached."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,6,Sat Jul 11 04:48:53 2015 UTC,"There isn't a group of people out there that pride themselves on not taking a shit.    Time to start a new movement, ""NoShit"".

MGTOW,3cvs5c,oldredder,-1,Sat Jul 11 12:28:20 2015 UTC,"there is a huge difference, both menstruation and having a shit lol are natural activities and your body will get into trouble if you force it to stop doing it.  masturbation and porn are prelearned often addictive patterns."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,oldredder,3,Sat Jul 11 13:13:41 2015 UTC,"Your body produces sperm constantly. If you don't eject it voluntarily through sex or masturbation, it'll come out in nocturnal emissions and/or urination."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:46:59 2015 UTC,"yeah you gonna explode lol.  your body produces sperm constantly - if you're masturbating several times per week, it produces even more (supply/demand) - when you stop, it normalizes.   you need to stop masturbating severely for a month or two to notice this."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,-2,Sat Jul 11 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"lol if it brought out your inner mangina means you didn't had break long enough.  it should brought out your inner alpha, dude.  besides it's not the reason you stop that is important- its why you come back lol"
MGTOW,3cvs5c,joblessguy10,-4,Sat Jul 11 13:15:02 2015 UTC,"There isn't a group of people out there that pride themselves on not taking a shit.   That's a very good point. However, I haven't heard of anybody who's experienced anything bad happening to their prostate health (I admittedly haven't looked into it) from not getting sexual release (in the style of NoFap's 'hardmode).  Being obsessed with sex like an 11 year old is part of why I started NoFap, because being obsessed with it seems like it would take its toll on the way I think. MGTOW and [my version of] NoFap both include forms of becoming uninterested in sex, although for somewhat different reasons it seems.  How did it bring out the 'inner beta/white knight' in you?"
MGTOW,3cvs5c,joblessguy10,4,Sat Jul 11 05:03:35 2015 UTC,it's called cancer. Orgasm helps reduce prostate cancer risk
MGTOW,3cvs5c,ImStillHereJerk,0,Sat Jul 11 07:40:50 2015 UTC,"sure, might not do any harm but not if you're having 3 orgasms every day while being on you porn."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,ImStillHereJerk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:16:27 2015 UTC,It's not worse than 3 orgasms a day having sex which is what I do when I've got a long-term girlfriend
MGTOW,3cvs5c,ImStillHereJerk,0,Sat Jul 11 18:38:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've never heard of that. Thanks for your comment. Since I'm a teenager, I probably have very little risk of prostate cancer, so I'll probably continue doing NoFap for a little while to see where it gets me. I'll definitely masturbate again, no doubt. In fact, I'll probably just keep it in moderation for most of my life, cause I know I'm not going to be doing NoFap for the rest of my life. I'm mostly doing NoFap for the experience."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,ImStillHereJerk,2,Sat Jul 11 16:23:34 2015 UTC,prostate cancer risk builds over your entire life - we're all at risk
MGTOW,3cvs5c,oldredder,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:48:26 2015 UTC,exactly. how you can say that not masturbating made you weak and obsessed with sex and fapping all the time to porn does not mean you're weak obsessed with sex lol?!
MGTOW,3cvs5c,SoullessTechnocrat,-1,Sat Jul 11 13:15:57 2015 UTC,Could you rephrase that?
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,0,Sat Jul 11 16:08:42 2015 UTC,how you can say that not masturbating made you weak and obsessed with sex YET fapping all the time to porn does not mean you're weak and obsessed with sex lol?!
MGTOW,3cvs5c,SoullessTechnocrat,0,Sat Jul 11 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"For some people, not masturbating made them weak and obsessed with sex. Not me.  For some people, fapping often does not mean they're weak and obsessed. For me, it's dependent on how often I do it."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,8,Sat Jul 11 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"NoFap and TRP are useless and deluded. NoFap is useless because when you go out to the grocery store without having masturbated for some time, and you see a hot chick in with a round ass in yoga pants, your temptation to grab the juicy round butt cheek is great. It usually just results in you imploding with self hate, depression, and anxiety ultimately leading to fapping after tumbling down the mountain. I've went 4 months once and it was horrible.It was worse when I relapsed, because it felt like my house burned down.   TRP is stupid because the majority of it's concept are fucking pathetic, deluded, and obvious. They say lift weights, but the condition for sucess is that you have to be tall and already have the right body type (ectomorph/mesopmorh).   They spiel about ""dread"" but that only works when you are a desirable man in the first place. A woman will never dread you leaving her for another woman when you aren't even attractive in the first place.   MGTOW is realistic and comfortable way of life, especially for a guy like me. Knowing who I am and where I stand in society, in SMV, and desirability helps me to forget the shitty game that I used to pla which screwed me over, left me in depression, sadness, and anger. TRP and NoFap beckons me to delusion and false hope and I reject it. I'd much rather be alone and happy with myself without anyones approval."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,oldredder,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think TRP is somewhat useless as well, they seem to focus too much on 'pimping' and whatnot. Some of the NoFap community tends to focus too much on getting women and whatnot, which also bugs me.  I'm not fully on the MGTOW boat, either. It just isn't that appealing to me at the age I'm at (14). But it probably will appeal more and more to me as I grow, and MGTOW does have some good ideas and people with good experience, so I keep coming back."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Gatanis,2,Sat Jul 11 19:13:02 2015 UTC,"I wish I had my current mindset when I was 14. In the meantime, focus on making yourself better and happy. Totally commit to a viable education and a viable career, and commit to your hobbies."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,oldredder,7,Sat Jul 11 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"Nobody likes NoFap because NoFap is just another way in which people try to control male sexuality.

MGTOW,3cvs5c,oldredder,8,Sat Jul 11 17:20:33 2015 UTC,"nope.   but as I scroll through the top posts on this sub, I found that you guys don't seem to agree with the ideas NoFap.   Because the ideas are nonsense. And endanger your sex drive. There's one guy who no matter what was looking to kill his sex drive. For him... I did say yes, it did that to me (I reversed it, thankfully) so if he'd like to risk it that's a way.  Nofap doesn't improve your life unless your goal of improvement is to have a soft dick forever after.  EVERYTHING is an alternative to nofap - everything.   I put my mind to, which is what I was doing to quit my addiction to porn and masturbating.   Almost all men have no addiction at all to maturbation and porn and for them nofap will have no good effect at all. By all means if you're busy having sex don't stop making time for that just to jerk it. If you're busy & have no time to get yourself off or you'll miss a plane, bus, etc., of course don't do that.  Common damn sense.  This forum is men going their own way. If you want to do something and know what it will cause then do it.  The nofap subreddit / forum pushes nonsense about what the effect / outcome will be. That's unacceptable here.   Thanks for reading. I hope I don't bug anyone.   You are bugging me but only for this reason: the followers of nofap are like some kind of crazy cult, collective agreement and irony, while normally I'd call it a circle-jerk IF they are actually doing what they say they are doing then technically it isn't. What bugs me is that kind of collective belief in all doing the same thing for the same reason - especially a wrong reason that isn't true - is opposite of what this subreddit is.  This isn't a place we all follow the same tune. This is a place many of us have in common that we will do our own thing no matter what. We don't get here for the same reasons or in the same age in life or come from the same places in the world. We don't intend to all do the same things in our lives to go our own way.  That would be completely self-defeating."

But this strong preverence has no negative inpact to my life. I wouldn't spend lots of money to get this meal ""just now"". I wouldn't do anything that have an negative impact, because it's not worth. I like to watch porn. I do it 2-3 times a weak. Mostly when I don't have anything better to do. And of course I do fap.

Almost no one suffers from addictions.   go out on any given day to the city centre and look at all those people drinking, smoking and eating shit foods.    Addiction is not a one-time event. Addiction is a pattern: if the person can't go without drinking, gets the shakes; can't go without smoking, gets insane cravings and mood swings; if the person gets a shock to their system from withdrawal of sugar from the horrible fast foods, then by all means call it addiction. This is RARE.  The majority of the population DO NOT suffer from any of this.   why you are reacting so nervously? calm down   This is the opposite of nervous: why are you pretending I'm nervous when I'm calm, collected, factual and refusing to allow bullshit (from you) to stand as fact (which it isn't)?   You don't need porn to live, or function   My eyes and mind need stimulation. So yes I do. I need porn, electronics, math, code, music, photographs, paintings, all of it. My brain is a high-volume data-processing machine and when the volume drops my brain doesn't work as well.   Sorry. Read about brain chemistry and how it works   Literally I dedicated more than 15 years of my life to doing precisely that and what I'm telling you is the conclusion of that.   And if you really don't have any problems with it, then why not ditch it and see it for yourself?   I did and it did no difference at all: I lived in my car for a few years and believe me there was no time for porn and certainly nothing but magazines if I should waste the money on 10 pictures that are barely worth seeing.

I don't get it.  yeah you see that's the whole mind-set of current rotten society. that we constantly need to stimulate our brains, to put them on feckin overdrive, constantly fresh stimuli. and not doing that is a punishment oohhh what a misery would be to put one through this.  yeah, sure. ;) it's called having a strong will and not giving into some low instincts like the urges to watch other people having sex on screen."

And the bad effects you will notice, the damage - will happen not now, but in 20 years - like with smoking (various cancers).  You have very poor reading comprehension  No, I don't.

If you required to watch porn and masturbate, every doctor on this planet would say that. 'You need to masturbate because if not you become androgynous' lol... and so on.   Seems something was/is missing from your diet, way of living etc. so that you experienced such problems.  And from what I've read on YBOP, sometimes re-wiring might take MONTHS. Maybe you are just a very tough case and your brain is seriously messed up.  But no, sorry you don't need to masturbate in order to feel masculine. This is BS."

But no, sorry you don't need to masturbate in order to feel masculine   Misreading on purpose then. I never wrote that.  A man who denies himself orgasm for a long time will forget entirely what it is to be a man. He will forget what sex is for, his penis will stop working, he will lose purpose in life and not be able to relate to women or men at all anymore. It will be like a reversion to pre-puberty childhood. Testosterone will certainly drop too."

MGTOW,3cvs5c,Falazure1,6,Sat Jul 11 06:58:30 2015 UTC,"Nofap is crap in my opinion. It doesn't provide any benefits except making you hornier, more frustrated and more desperate.  Fapping doesn't cost anything, can't give you STDs, and provides pleasure. There is no downside.  Sex with real women is great, but women suck up resources (time, money, emotional exertion) like a hoover vacuum. They can also cause you all kinds of problems, get pregnant and have you paying child support, give you STDs, and get you tied up with their truckloads of baggage.  If you're a virgin you might want to go out and get a piece of ass instead of jacking off all the time. But if you've already banged enough women, there's no need to waste time and money trying to screw every low end, ugly, STD-infested, no-wall vagina woman instead of just jacking off.  Jacking off prevents you from making bad life choices, like having unprotected sex with an ugly crackhead woman behind a dumpster because you're so fucking horny.  Not jacking off leaves you horny, desperate, thirsty, and dependent on women (who are completely and utterly unreliable) for sexual gratification. Depending on women for sexual gratification is like depending on a dog not to drink from the toilet.  The only time it makes sense to practice nofap is if you're not horny or if you have an attractive woman giving you sex all the time. I wouldn't jack off if I had an 18 year old hottie who let me put it in her whenever I wanted. But I'm not going to not masturbate (which feels awesome with no cost/effort) and be a marionette begging bitches for sex all the time."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,0,Sat Jul 11 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"Nofap is crap in my opinion. It doesn't provide any benefits except making you hornier, more frustrated and more desperate.   only if you don't go pass your addiction feedback loop.   if not masturbating makes you more frustrated and more desperate it is a very sign of addiction/addicted brain. I stopped it long time ago and got same symptoms you are refering to- they are called cravings and come with every drug.  yes, porn and masturbation is a drug, goes with dopamine and its a double edged sword. now to be clear- I am referring to 'overmasturbation', not doing it once per month."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,2,Sat Jul 11 12:23:18 2015 UTC,"Most men are addicted to SEX, not masturbation, and it is natural. Men naturally have strong urges for sex because that's how the species procreates. Masturbation is just an easier alternative to the real sex that all healthy men of a certain age crave. My point is, if men don't masturbate, their desperation for real sex will increase."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,-3,Sat Jul 11 13:00:15 2015 UTC,"it really depends. its all about channeling your energy. sex with another person IS different than masturbation to pixels, c'mon.  yet, if you don't want to have sex, don't want to deplete and waste your energy through masturbation you can channel it into something more productive. but we all just want a quick fix. a magic pill lol."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:58:08 2015 UTC,"You're right about masturbation being different from sex. Masturbation is easier to get and much safer (no drama, no diseases, no babies).   deplete and waste your energy through masturbation    People in rich countries aren't suffering from a lack of energy to burn, they're suffering from obesity, diabetes and lack of exercise. I'm not sure if masturbation counts as exercise, but I'm sure its healthier than just sitting around all day.   It seems to me nofappers aren't channeling all their extra energy into anything productive. They're channelling it into circle-jerking about nofapping and obsessing over nofapping.   Jacking off to porn, having a nice orgasm and then getting other stuff done would probably be more efficient than spending 24/7 obsessing over nofapping, running about town trying to get sex, or trying not to think about sex."

I'm waiting for someone to say that it's better to fap than to lift lol ;) yeah, of course masturbation is better than sitting all day in the same way as spitting or playing with toothpick is better than sitting all day ;)  I agree that in order to benefit you have to take action. I am taking action- as I've mentioned, I am cycling several times per week (long trips, marathon like), weightlifting and doing yoga plus my hobbies/passions. I am very active and years ago masturbation only slowed me down. I am not saying it will do the same for everyone BUT if someone will say it 'can't have any benefits' then sorry, he's wrong. The best way to find out is to try it for yourself.  Most addicted men will quit trying because it will be too hard for them (because they're addicted and not realizing that) but they will rationalize that by 'oh I dont need to quit, its stupid' instead and that's the very path you want to avoid."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,thick_knees,-2,Sun Jul 12 14:50:53 2015 UTC,"This is a somewhat good point. For me, masturbation was just getting a little out of hand, no pun intended. Like, 2-3 times a day was a little much."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Laughing_Breeze,-1,Sun Jul 12 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment. There's a NoFap term, called 'rebooting' which happens to people usually around 90 days, and from what people have said, they don't horny/thirsty/dependent on women like they used to, giving them the greatest control over their urges/desires."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,SoullessTechnocrat,4,Sat Jul 11 16:38:06 2015 UTC,"It's not good to obsess over anything, but as a young male there's not much you can do. Society used to marry men and women at young ages because of men's powerful sex drives, and because it then would provide lifelong protection and a provider for females too. Both sexes get the best for themselves, most of society is happy.  But the rules changed. It's very difficult for young men, because their SMV is so low. So usually it's either fornication which is very unhealthy too (lots of STDs) or masturbation.   But the thing is, the male sex drive falls off a cliff in the early 30s, at which point it is in fact very controllable and masturbation becomes rare. Also in marriages a lot of men lose interest in their 30s too, the dead bedroom is a combination for both men and women.   You can improve yourself and have sex, but you're still probably going to masturbate at younger ages. Well, if you have high testosterone anyway."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,SoullessTechnocrat,0,Sat Jul 11 16:19:54 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of the term SMV, that's pretty interesting. Thanks for the comment.  What do you mean by the sex drive becoming very controllable in the early 30's?"
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,4,Sat Jul 11 05:00:58 2015 UTC,"sexual market-value is the value you have to those you want to have sex with - for sex.  Men in their 30's, not all but many, decline in sex drive. I didn't but many have. OR... maybe they didn't take care of themselves so they're ugly to women and get no sex, and just say they have declining sex drive. Hard to say"
MGTOW,3cvs5c,SoullessTechnocrat,0,Sat Jul 11 05:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say its a mix of factors. some men are already divorced, others- married (we all know what that means), even others- being fathers. that kills your sex drive.   even being in LTR does it! as your testosterone levels go down.  yet, when some of my colleagues are weak as fuck, I am excercising, doing yoga, using bike, stopped smoking and drinking, eat as healthy as I can (fruits and veggies instead of crisps and chocolate- a no brainer!), getting supplements and vitamins and not being in a LTR and guess what- my sex drive is healthy and high as it never was. And what is best is that I, myself, choose whether I have sex and with whom, if any.   If not- then nothing happens. I can use the same energy to go on a bike for whole day.   If you are living healthy your whole body is healthy - if you have addiction problems, then probably you crave other nasty things and porn can be a problem, too.   Such dilemmas aren't bothering me anymore because I am staying healthy and guess what? It feels fucking great. But it requires effort, patience, endurance and strong will and it isnt for pussies wondering if they can go without watching some other men fucking women on the screen. To be addicted to such stuff- that's pathetic. How this can be MGTOW? For me it sounds like being weak addicted mess.   And well yes, once per week is an addiction too. C'mon, you can't go for 7 days without watching some pussy being fucked?! Lol  (oldredder I dont write this personally to you ofc, just in general)"
MGTOW,3cvs5c,Morranaii,2,Sat Jul 11 07:40:24 2015 UTC,"It doesn't - LTRs never drove down my testosterone. Then again LTRs for me were all about sex - just lots of sex with the same girl.   instead of crisps and chocolate   Chocolate is actually good for you. I stick with the darkest chocolate I can find, not milk chocolate.   If not- then nothing happens. I can use the same energy to go on a bike for whole day.    There's no change in energy at all. This is self-delusion. Actual energy comes from being fit, having a good diet and not being old. That's it. Having sex and/or masturbation doesn't subtract permanently from your energy.  Once per week is not addiction - once per week is a DEFICIT to what the prostate actually needs.  Porn itself, not masturbation: is just decorations. I have eyes and they like to see things. On occasion I can switch up the decorations to fractal designs or perhaps forest scenes but honestly I'd prefer to just GO to the forest personally. Whereas there are no forests-equivalent full of naked women near me.  Back when I was in Vancouver there was Wreck Beach. I lived there. It's a nude beach. No need for porn: endless pussy as far as the eye can see.  Doesn't matter if I see the pussy being fucked or not, or the girl masturbating or something. Hot girls are nice scenery."
MGTOW,3cvs5c,SoullessTechnocrat,0,Sat Jul 11 13:12:13 2015 UTC,were not going anywhere with this but it doesnt matter. be in peace and do whatever works for you.  my point is anything in excess is bad for you - whether its porn or chocolate.  Having sex and/or masturbation doesn't subtract permanently from your energy wrong. orgasms deplete you from GABA and dopamine. do this plenty of times during week and your testosterone drops too. if you're doing weightlifting you know what I am talking about.   Back when I was in Vancouver there was Wreck Beach. I lived there. It's a nude beach. No need for porn: endless pussy as far as the eye can see so you masturbated as soon as you saw all these naked girls? ;)
MGTOW,3cvs5c,SoullessTechnocrat,2,Sat Jul 11 18:38:33 2015 UTC,If that were true then sex would be devastatingly bad for your health and you couldn't keep having sex 3 times a day for years. But this isn't true. I've been there & know it's not true.

MGTOW,3cvs5c,SoullessTechnocrat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:33:45 2015 UTC,Addiction to sex is real but incredibly rare. 3x/day sex is only rare because of most men having no stamina to do it. It's perfectly healthy for those who can.

I didn't even fucking start masturbating until I was nearly 17, much less having epiphanies about the act. Although I have been in and out of NoFap since then (I'm 20 now), though I'm not the missionary type. There's a pretty distinct difference in my mental state when I am and am not fapping, and the NoFap state is much stronger and better overall.  NoFap can be a little too overpowering on the mind, though, and isn't some sort of cure-all, as the urges can cause quite destructive decision-making after about 5 days. Some of my happiest, most focused days have been on a NoFap streak and some of my most frustrated, angriest days have been on NoFap streaks.  In my current life stage, I prefer to use NoFap as a short-term weapon to increase my effectiveness at some major task that may be coming up. Will I be fucking a girl next weekend? I'm absolutely holding in my jizz so I can fuck her as hard as possible. Finals coming up? I'm taking 10 days off so I have that extra mental energy for studying motivation. But if I know I have a routine couple of weeks coming up with nothing notable happening? I'm just going to enjoy myself and masturbate to my favorite porn.  However, I am interested in going on a really long NoFap streak (60+ days) to see if I can induce asexuality to finally redirect my sexual motivation. If I could channel the motivation I feel to get sex towards my work, I could do anything."

That's why you need RP, when you start having conversations with people after it, you don't see things in the same light ever again.    Example: some months ago, my relatives were over and they were talking about this one guy they all know (but who I do not).  He's been dating the same girl for five years, and she wants to get married.  He says no, she says ""ok, we'll date for one more year, and if you don't marry me, we'll break up"".  They date for another year, she asks him if he wants to marry her, he says no, they break up.    My relatives (all women) were discussing this and they couldn't believe it happened.  How do you date someone for that long without marrying that person?  They asked over and over again.  Pre-RP, I wouldn't have understood either.  post-RP, I get it, don't ever get married.  If you have any doubt about a girl, you're doubt is right and its trying to tell you something.  This guy probably was never going to marry (he was at least honest with her) but he didn't have any objection to some company in life (for a complete description of this phenomenon, see Jane Austin ""Pride and Prejudice"").  If she wanted to fill that role, that was fine, if she didn't, she could leave.    I feel really bad for BB every time I read something like this.  They have this nice, tidy plan for life.  Find a girl, get married, have some kids, buy a house, retire, spend your life with one woman.  He's heading for a deadbedroom if he marries this girl.  The crazy thing about the top responses in r/relationships is that they highlight the differences in sex drive.  She doesn't want sex less than he does, she just wants it with Chad, and not with him.  She's willing to give him pity sex twice a month, but she'll bang Chad till the cows come home.  There are legitimately people with different sex drives, and there are also women whose ""low sex drive"" is just with BB, and its high with Chad.    If this guy marries, he's in for a world of hurt."

Pricing determines your worth.  Preferential pricing will make some groups worth less.  As a mgtow and men's rights activist, that's not something I'm willing to accept.  It's degrades the value of men at a systematic level, and restricts their liberties.  I will not accept this pricing, even if I don't plan on using it.  Until then, I WILL be going my own way.

Statistics on Suicide in Australia  Suicide remains the leading cause of death for Australians aged between 15 and 44.  Deaths by suicide   Deaths by suicide have reached a 10-year peak. The most recent Australian data (ABS, Causes of Death, 2012) reports deaths due to suicide at 2,535. The overall suicide rate in 2012 was 11.0 per 100,000, compared to the 2011 rate of 9.9 per 100,000. In 2012, 1,901 males (16.8 per 100,000) and 634 females (5.6 per 100,000) died by suicide. This equates to almost seven deaths by suicide in Australia each day. Men account for three out of every five deaths by suicide, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death for males. For those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, the suicide rate is 2.5 times higher for males and 3.4 times higher for females. The most recent data (ABS, Causes of Death, 2012) shows that almost twice as many people died from suicide in Australia, than in road related transport deaths (1,310 vs 2,535).   Suicide attempts  For every completed suicide, it is estimated that as many as 30 people attempt.   That’s around 200 attempts per day. That’s more than one new attempt in Australia every 10 minutes.   Thoughts of suicide (Suicidal ideation)   It is estimated that around 250 people make a suicide plan every day.

Why would a woman be higher value by giving birth to what society as a whole considers a low value being?  And if they give birth to another female, which does have value, then what value is there actually in that either? A high value being gave birth to another high value being, so it is a push. No net gain.  So women giving birth is not some virtue that makes them worthy of destroying the male sex for.   Besides, animals give birth too.

MGTOW,3co00e,User-31f64a4e,7,Thu Jul 9 13:37:09 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about this as well, but I think it's a reflection of a wider trend.  It appears that western society is trending in a more ""feminine"" direction. Emotions are prioritized over the actual reality of the situation. People are only receptive to you disagreeing with the consensus, if you are apologetic about your disagreement. ""I hate to bring it up, I hate to disagree, etc.""  Why? Is it because modern society is so cushy, masculinity is unneeded? Do people recede into hugbox territory, when things get easy?  There seems to be a great deal of pressure on men (esp. young men) to conform with this ""feminine"" paradigm, and I think it's wreaking havoc on their mental health.  Another commenter mentioned marvel super heroes. That should be the prime example of masculinity in movies. However, I saw ""Avengers"", and it was a ""shell"" of masculinity. Any time a character engaged in some sort of conflict, it was ""relieved"" by some sort of quip, to undo any sort of seriousness the situation carried.  Iron man bursts into a room filled with bad guys, shoots them all.  BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM  Iron man: ""I'm glad we had this talk.""  Shot guy: ""I'm not.""  Audience: ""HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA IT WAS SERIOUS AND NOW IT ISN'T""  Repeat that 20x, and you have ""Avengers"".  It seems no one can take anything seriously anymore. It seems like people are intimidated by true strength, true masculinity.  North America is essentially a giant hugbox.  And not having a good male role model causes a great deal of damage. Fathers are busy ""providing"" for their families, or not in the presence of the children at all (divorce). And as you say OP, good role models are rare in fiction, as well. How fucked up is that?  I had to find my masculinity myself, as I didn't have anyone to look up to. (raised by single mother). What little inspiration I had to improve myself, and develop my masculinity came from fiction.  If we don't even have masculinity in fiction we are absolutely fucked."

Because in this life we can only count on ourselves! Family, friends, women - they will betray you, most of them will. And you need to be prepared how to cope with that instead of glorifying some other people. Learn from their mistakes, raise your knowledge- yes, but always use your own knowledge and experience.   Besides, looking upon some authority is a false bias. Someone becomes the authority because - let's say - 100 other people said he is an authority.

It doesn't change anything; I'm still worthless, still depressed, and still suicidal.  Understand that there are those who are lesser than you; who suffered less and were destroyed more. That's me. You can't just 'check it out' and eliminate the cause. Life is not some kind of plug and play app that you can change on a whim. It is a continuous struggle where if you screw up once; you can never fix it due to the other catastrophes that result from the one fuck up.

I've been on five different medications over the years for several different diagnoses. (Luvox 25mg, Imipramine 10mg, Ritalin 10mg: Those were for the ADHD/Depression that I was charted at, at age seven. I took those until I was about thirteen. Then old man refused to let me see a doctor when he and mother got remarried. After that; I moved out when I was 18 and subsequently went on Lamictal 250mg twice a day for a supposed Manic/Depressive Disorder.)   There isn't any way to be my own rescue here; Alabama's Mental Health system is absolute shit. There isn't anyone who just won't load me down with pills and tell me to be numb, fake it, and you'll get better. If I could help myself; I would have already, and we would have never spoke. This has been constant; with only a few breaks in between where I was distracted enough to forget, and after thinking about not being in pain, it returns full force.  Yeah; something went wrong. My mother didn't keep her fucking legs closed because she just had to have a little DNADoll to play with. I'm literally doing all I can; but of course, no one believes me. I guess because that it's all in my head and you can't see anything there.  Really; the world will be much better without me. Hell; I'd love it if someone hired a hit on me, but I'd never be important enough to anyone else's life to warrant that.

No, really. Most of my waking moments are spent in a state like this; like how I post on reddit. In this kind of frothing, seething rage that just barely bubbles over. The main reason for this is because I've actually tried to improve my life; only to get shut down at every turn. Other periods of my extended malady include active and passive hallucinations.

Old Man caused a lot of the problems I have; but I can't really say the four letters for it. (I find it disrespectful to actual combat veterans to say that. So I just say I'm weak and worthless. Makes more sense; especially with how everyone else seems to have suffered more but made it out.)  He would shout you down into the floor and flog you with a belt for spilling a drink.

He would make claims like that he was the great-great-great grandson of Jesus and the Indians; and that my maternal Grandfather was the incarnation of Satan. He used religion to terrorize us; and would then beat us whenever we prayed for release. He once pulled my arm out of socket when I was four when I tried to run away from a beating. He would give us things; only to make us give them to one of his friend's kids as a show of wealth. (Most petty of the things; but it really works a number on your idea of self worth.) And any mote of noncompliance triggered an apocalyptic response.   That's the tip of the iceberg. My Old Man was a right bastard; a drug dealer who ended up trying to be with us because 'that's what men do', when he really should have stayed by himself since he couldn't go without verbally attacking everyone around him. (I suppose we share that; another reason for my removal.) All of this on top of my heavy metal poisoning that started causing my hallucinations. For twenty godsdamn constant years.  There are no acupuncture places where I live, meditation is impossible due to intrusive thoughts that can't be broken out of unless I physically shake myself, and I still don't get why you think there is a solution for me. It isn't as if I just gave up out of nowhere; I've thought this through for a good while now."

For me, Batman was always there to save the day. Now, the plots and story in Batman universe is getting complicated and catering to an adult audience. The kids who loved Batman back then have grown up to love Nolan's Batman and Gotham TV series. This is the reason why Batman will never feel boring. The producers of Batman is targeting these people.

A MGTOW has an attitude of gratitude about his life. Sure, you might not be rich as hell and able to take expensive-ass vacations to anywhere, BUT, you can enjoy what you do have and enjoy the absolute hell out of it. The beer, the video games, the model trains, the bacon, whatever you're into and whatever you like to do it's pretty goddamn nice isn't it? Hell yes it is. At what point would you ever enter into a marriage-contract where a woman can/would/could/will take 50% of your house or condo she didn't pay for, 50% of your model trains or whatever other goodies you have that she didn't pay for, not to mention fucking up your daily and weekly routines?"

The problem though is that you can never let your guard down around women. I couldn't deal with that myself. I have PTSD from things before I got married, and dealing with her setting my instincts off constantly and her just being a general predator towards me forced me to leave. I came to the point where I had to leave or I was going to likely do something very stupid and ruin any potential future I might have had, and likely hers as well.

About charges of selfishness: By living single, you're at liberty to give time and money to the charities of your choice. Or not giving if that's your choice. If you marry, your funds and time are tied up trying to make SWMBO somewhat less unhappy (making her happy being an obvious impossibility).  So-- remain single, devote your time and effort to something you consider worth doing. Let the critics criticize-- it matters not."
MGTOW,3cl9ee,thick_knees,2,Thu Jul 9 12:32:17 2015 UTC,Selfishness means lack of consideration for other people. If there's no one in your life it's literally impossible to be selfish.

MGTOW,3clj7v,divergentseries,8,Wed Jul 8 21:07:49 2015 UTC,"It's just that I feel I don't have that much of a choice other than MGTOW (which ideally should be approached from a place of strength instead of weakness).    We certainly don't live in an ideal world, though... I think you have choices other than mgtow, for sure, but why would any man want to not go his own way?    It seems self-shaming to downgrade one's own choices by focussing on one's weaknesses as the only driving factor behind them. Of course, your experiences with women likely leave you frustrated and/or with a sense of lack of fulfillment of the romantic Ideal that many, many men grow up with. However, you characterize yourself as largely happy despite your acknowledgement of sadness at not being able to pursue one of society's archetypal 'routes to a happy life' (family, successful career, etc). It's like you have already understood that 'life', as prescribed by your upbringing / past experiences, does not offer YOU, divergentseries, the fulfillment YOU desire. Many men have realised that they, too, cannot have the romantic ideal. They realised this when they came to understand women's true nature and motivations and society's overt-covert support for those true motivations.   The cookie-cutter program for producing adult humans is not designed to produce happy and fulfilled humans, it's designed to produce confused hyper-consumers.  Going Your Own Way consists of behaviour on a spectrum of a partial-to-complete rejection of all and any expectations imposed by external society in favour of a partial-to-complete re-definition of Self, by Self alone. This is serious shit...  I advise allowing time to grieve properly over the perception of 'loss' that accompanies awakening to the various realities of life. Once you have woken up to enough of them, going your own way is the only rational choice...and your own way can be utterly unique, substantially if not completely defined by you, and you will value it greatly, regardless of what others think. Obviously there would be penalties attached to certain behaviours that a rational person would know to avoid and you would also likely value the reflections of yourself you saw in a few, close, trusted associates.   Edit: I'd like to add the recommendation that you read a few r/theredpill posts each week. There's much hilarity to be read there, and, with a little selective judgement, a good few pearls of wisdom, too... Here's some hilarity to get you started lol"
MGTOW,3clj7v,PartlyMe,6,Wed Jul 8 22:03:06 2015 UTC,"This is a very profound answer, and I thank you for it. Just what I need at the moment. You're right that my disability and other weaknesses probably aren't (and shouldn't be) the only reasons for my being interested in MGTOW. I've always had a bit of an intellectually contrarian streak, and MGTOW definitely is contrarian, in the best way possible. Coincidentally, some time ago, a friend of mine brought up the concept of ""grief"" over lost possibilities as well. I think it's an accurate description, because the thought of all the lives that I could have lead, but which are and will remain unrealized, occasionally fills me with a very sharp, painful sensation of having lost, to use Emerson's phrase, ""a beautiful estate"". Finally, it's difficult for me, divergentseries, who fancies himself an independent thinker, to admit that my longing for the romantic ideal may very well be due in large part to social conditioning, instead of being completely innate."

MGTOW,3clj7v,PartlyMe,3,Wed Jul 8 22:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, that, and the galling realization that all these deeply ""spiritual"" feelings I've had for a few ""special"" women were probably just byproducts of a very elaborate socio-biological scheme developed to perpetuate the species and keep society from falling apart."
MGTOW,3clj7v,SoullessTechnocrat,3,Wed Jul 8 23:08:32 2015 UTC,"Man's romanticism is often explained as a yearning to be loved in the same way his mother loved him. Fairy stories, literally and figuratively, train men for the romantic role as lambs to the slaughter. Man's slaughter is in the form of indentured servitude to a woman as codified literally, legally and 'unofficially' in multiple ways.   The drive to perpetuate the species does explain gynocentrism quite well. However, with no shortage of humans on earth now, gynocentrism is thoroughly anachronistic."
MGTOW,3clj7v,laudomatic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:18:23 2015 UTC,Another point for why everything should have never been to begin with. The perpetuation of the species is part and parcel of what makes it all so terrible.

""Well, I didn't want them anyway, they are probably sour!""  They say that MGTOW is a rationalization, to resolve the cognitive dissonance, of not being able attract women.  The reality is different. A lot of us have tasted the grapes, and yes they were sweet at first.  However the grapes also caused explosive diarrhea that lasted for weeks.  Therefore, rational men stop eating the grapes.  Luckier rational men see all of the other men shitting their pants around the grape vine, and understand that it doesn't matter how sweet the grapes are, it can't be worth it.  Irrational men think ""maybe I won't get diarrhea this time"", harkening back to how sweet their last grapes were, at first.  I bring this up, because ""fox and grapes"" is how most would explain your choice. (emphasis on choice) Women are arrogant, they assume they are inherently desirable.  And to a lot of men, women are inherently desirable. Those men just don't realize what's causing their diarrhea."

For females the other way around. Women don't get physically attracted like males. But that shouldn't be a problem of a MGTOW.
MGTOW,3clyxi,BKDre,6,Wed Jul 8 23:07:01 2015 UTC,"If you read the thread he states she basically ran off and is still taking advantage of his military benefits.  ""No the divorce hasn't finalized as she has moved half way across the US and keeps playing games with my lawyer and the courts and drawing it out.  It is my firm belief she's been delaying due to receiving all the military benefits of a spouse (free health insurance, etc.)  If I was asking the court to award HER the house, then she would have had to refinance it.  But she doesn't like working so she wouldn't meet income requirements.  As for a CH13, I don't really see me holding onto the house while I just became a student.  Especially since I would still have to pay for repairs and the monthly payment.""  I remember a few MGTOW speaking on women quickly trying to marry military men before they hit the wall so they can reap the benefits.   As someone approaching 800 fico, the idea of joining my finances with another person is terrifying. Having a fico score of 800+ takes years of responsible borrowing. Its taken me almost a decade to get close after having some issues as a teen. So i can feel for this dude!  If he stayed single, he would be living the life right now. Good credit, home, free to do what he wants financially. But now he has to suffer through a divorce, and apparently the wife is stretching it out to milk his benefits further. Just horrible.   He updates the community on his journey back to 800 fico. Pretty interesting so far.   Marriage is for suckers. She sucked him dry of his benefits, and ran away. Classic tale in some respects."

MGTOW,3clyxi,Trekbiker,2,Thu Jul 9 01:46:56 2015 UTC,"my FICO is currently 830 and I protect it for all I'm worth.   It takes years to get there and there are lots of things that can bring it down in a hurry, things as seemingly innocent as taking out a new card or closing out an older card account (thereby reducing the length of your credit history, the time you've had all your cards are averaged)  For a few years now I have been a major lender with Lending Club.   I've made approx. 6700 loans over the last three years, almost all of them in the minimum $25 amounts, probably only 5 or 6 hundred at $50 amounts, none over $50 (as an original Prosper 1.0 lender back in 2006-8 I learned some very hard lessons about that).   I have access to quite a bit of the financial information of the borrowers and have set up and refined various filters over time to select loans.    I have learned that the most important factor to consider in making a loan is the borrowers FICO score.   I no longer will loan anything to any borrower with a FICO less than 720.   Sorry, if your FICO is less than 720 the chances you are an irresponsible deadbeat (or just unlucky, divorced, bad decisions, etc) are just too great.  A few hundred charged off loans to date have shown me this.     Its a tough world."

Stop punching the bag immediately if you landed a bad hit and your wrists starts to hurt. Hitting a hard bag will hurt at first, but you'll be fine. Punch it with everything your body allows you to use as a weapon and harden your weak spots.  I know three ways to make a fist and every one has advantages like activating more tendons.

I've managed to figure out what I think is a way to position myself into a punch, so that it potentially breaks my neck when they hit me. I'm aware of my chances; and they've never been good. My only real hope is to lay a murder charge on the other party by dying. But you kind of have to go places to get into fights; and since I don't do that, I'm pretty sure I'm in the clear."

MGTOW,3ck16h,User-31f64a4e,5,Wed Jul 8 17:20:32 2015 UTC,"Well, tbh, the confrontation looks like it was over when he got up and went back over to her.    The moral would be ... if you are in a confrontation and it cools off, don't restart it.  But if the judge didn't see that, then maybe all there was was the testimony of the officers, who arrived after her initial unprovoked aggression. They would have seen him getting the upper hand on the drunk woman.    None of this is far, or right, or even sane. It just proves how insanely gynocentric things have gotten."
MGTOW,3ck16h,kurtu5,0,Wed Jul 8 18:38:31 2015 UTC,"well yeah he should react at the beginning when she attacked him and his hair lol - he still got enough time to kick her ass.  never postpone reaction though, whether its a kid, woman or a man. what if she had a knife ?! and he was just ignoring it because she was a woman. think about it."
MGTOW,3ck16h,hipst,2,Wed Jul 8 18:40:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly.    And there was a story in here about a year ago, about some guy whose GF was hitting him. He didn't take it seriously and went to hug her ... and wound up loosing an eye.    Just because you are bigger and stronger and tougher doesn't mean you shouldn't defend yourself, as anyone can get ""lucky"" and score a critical hit.  So yes, I agree absolutely - defend yourself immediately when it is called for. Yes, try to avoid unnecessary confrontations. The dude would have been smart to move. However, when a fight is inevitable, you should fight to win (factoring in likely crowd and third party intercessions, ofc.)"

MGTOW,3cj2xy,ThatPostGaveMeEbola,2,Wed Jul 8 14:57:25 2015 UTC,I totally approve. Let me finish experimenting with this one Basqueish recipe.
MGTOW,3cj2xy,pnw_diver,2,Wed Jul 8 21:39:00 2015 UTC,"Good stuff, let me contribute one of my easier recipes as a healthy snack food: Bruschetta!     6 romane tomatoes 1 white onion 3 minces garlic cloves 1/2 cup pitted olives 1/2 cup fresh basil 1 tbsp balsamic vinaigrette 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil Salt and pepper to taste    1 fresh italian baguette  Finely chop and add all ingredients to a bowl. Slice the baguette at 1"" thickness and place on cooking sheet. Drizzle a little olive oil over the circles of bread. Top spoon fulls of the bowl mixture onto the bread. Pre-heat oven to 400F and cook for 15-20, or until bread is crisp.     Easy to make, very delicious, and a great healthy snack food."
MGTOW,3cj2xy,Wollem,2,Thu Jul 9 00:09:02 2015 UTC,"This sounds really good I'll have to try it. 3 questions, 1. What do you think about sauteing the vegetables with some red wine and olive oil, and adding them to the baking olive oil and basil covered baguettes in the last 5-7 minutes of baking. 2. This seems like it would lend itself well to variation of ingredients, and substitutes. Ever consider swapping the Basil with Parsley; or adding spinach and/or artichoke heart? and lastly 3. Do you mind if I Xpost this to /r/MGTOW_Lifestyle if I give you credit /or would you post it? I would like to build a diversity of bachelor portioned recipes and such there. Thanks a lot. (I'm going to be grilling this weekend and I am a bit tempted to try to throw some of these on some tin foil on the top rack and see how it does there)."
MGTOW,3cj2xy,Wollem,2,Thu Jul 9 01:54:14 2015 UTC,"1) The sauteing might underwhelm the natural flavors of fresh vegetables which is why authentic bruschetta is often raw and only baked enough to crust the bread. When you saute vegetables, especially together, flavors meld and become one instead of many. You see the japanese often cooking their vegetables separate from one another instead of all at once in order to preserve each natural flavor. The balsamic vinaigrette, while adding a very flavorful accent won't overpower those natural flavors. 2) That's the beautiful thing about bruschetta, you can mix and match whatever you'd like! I've been messing around with adding mango to the mix for a sweeter taste, inspiration taken from a mango salsa I made the other day. I may have to leave out the balsamic though, the two contrast too much. 3) By all means post away, credit not needed. I have many more dishes I keep note booked which I may post later on in that sub, I'll keep my eyes pealed for your threads."
MGTOW,3cj2xy,HardBounce,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:26:35 2015 UTC,"Noted, good point; I'll definitely try it as you describe. I'd have never thought of going with mango. With the vinaigrette clash, perhaps this might be the place to substitute in the wine to cut down on the acidic sour while preserving the fruity light tones. Cool thanks will do."
MGTOW,3cj2xy,HardBounce,2,Thu Jul 9 02:47:30 2015 UTC,I don't see how this is /r/mgtow
MGTOW,3cj2xy,abertsa,6,Wed Jul 8 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feed back. My reasoning has a few parts. 1. Having cooking skills is an important part of being a single man. 2. Society often dissuades men from learning to cook, so they can be a ""real man"" and find a wife to fill that role. 3. The subreddit has a generally slow turnover rate so I didn't think it would be 'in the way'. 4. Most of the posts here tend to be uni-dimensional giving the impression that the only passion MGTOW have is complaining about and mocking women. When for the most part women are not much of a concern to me as a MGHOW, being happily and successfully self-sufficient is of much greater interest to me. and 5. Many MGTOW seem to like these posts. But by all means if people overall don't like this post or think it shouldn't be here, I'll oblige and save it for somewhere more appropriate."
MGTOW,3cj2xy,abertsa,3,Wed Jul 8 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"IMHO, I think THIS post you made listing reasons a man should cook with perhaps some links to the good cooking subreddits would be totally appropriate.  however I think specific cooking recipes in /r/MGTOW does not seem appropriate. maybe /r/MGTOW_cooking"

If you can get this you will be doing yourself a big favor. If not and it is as you describe. Use oil or melted butter/margarine to substitute the egg-wash, and double the black pepper in the breading. Use the same pepper and salt otherwise, It won't have the same subtleties, but it should still carry itself fairly well.

MGTOW,3cim4b,laudomatic,5,Wed Jul 8 20:04:47 2015 UTC,It's an interesting topic you raise about lesbian divorce. I tend to think that it will be the case the the 'butch-ier' seeming one will be given the short end of the stick; to best hold to tradition. It is the height of succulence to see Rosie have to personally experience family court from the non-special-little-snowflake side. She should (but she won't) take note of it for future times she wants to open her yaw about shit she doesn't know anything about.
MGTOW,3cim4b,thrownaway_MGTOW,6,Wed Jul 8 08:56:42 2015 UTC,"So her second marriage ends in divorce after ~3 years, much like her first marriage which also ended after ~3 years, and the ""relationship"" she had in-between the two... which also lasted around ~3 years.  And the sad thing is that this woman (and/or her ""partners"") is allowed to repeatedly adopt children. In many of the cases the adoptions have taken place within less than a year of ""marrying"" or ""establishing"" the new partner relationship. (Keep in mind that for most average people, just processing the paperwork to become eligible to become temporary ""foster"" home takes significantly longer than that; and most states won't even allow couples to apply until the marriage is multiple years.)  Sounds like this latest ""spouse"" is going to end up airing the dirty-laundry reality of how (poster lesbian-adoption-mom) ""Rosie"" actually does her ""parenting"" -- via 24/7 nannies and/or boarding schools (which really, given who and what the woman is, is probably better for the kids than if she were actually doing the parenting herself)."

MGTOW,3chahz,leREALSHIT,13,Tue Jul 7 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"All day today, ESPN has been overrun by relentless mangina behavior. Commentors have lined up to say something to effect of, ""Yes, she hit him, called him a nigger, knee'd him the balls, and kept him from getting a drink. But he's a man, so.... See, I'm a good feminist, too.""  One commentor went as far to say that Florida State didn't go far enough in removing him. Nevermind the fact this man has lost his scholarship (which unless he can get another at another school mean he's lost his livelihood, as well), lost any social standing he may have had as a result of the campaign.   J.A. Adande (LA Times) said on Around the Horn ""You know what guys? Yea, it's a double-standard. Get over it! Your gender benefits you in every other situation.""  WHAT THE FUCK? Typical Feminist narrative. So, I'm supposed to let some drunk bitch wail on me all night? Fuck that. She should know better.  Not to mention the fact every piece I've seen televised has been with the loop starting with Johnson's hand already on her wrists. This immediately psychologically primes viewers for him hitting her. It frames him as the aggressor in viewers minds, every single time.   Only Michael Wilbon (co-host Pardon The Interruption) said something even approaching sanity. Paraphrasing: ""Maybe as parents, we should teach all children, male or female, to not hit other people. But Johnson should've known better and walked away.""   Again, this is a paraphrasing, but he at least made a point. Wilbon also has a young son, so I think he is, in some way, thinking of his son's future in this Feminist Hellscape.  Fuck this earth. This woman blocks him from the bar (which is bad bar etiquette, in the most general sense), calls him a racial epithet, draws back her fist (threatens an attack), knees him in the balls, and then punches him, and she's a victim. Bullshit. I'm happy he punched her. Considering, he's gonna be labelled a woman beater, and have a whole slide in the ""More Reasons Feminism Needs Money"" PowerPoint dedicated to a split second decision he made as a 19 y/o for the rest of his life, he should've K/O'd her."

Indisputable evidence of self defense and totally explains why the police did not press charges and the investigation was dropped.

MGTOW,3chraj,Wollem,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"My dad was real flaky growing up. He had a mean streak in him when he was younger so my parents fought a lot. After an ugly divorce and all the child support (which he never paid), we rarely saw each other at all (myself and two siblings). Now that I'm nearing my 30s he wants to reconnect, really mellowed out and seems genuine in wanting to spend time with us. I try to give an adult prospective on the matter now that I'm older and wiser; he did some stupid shit, my mom did some stupid shit (and probably instigated a good deal of it), but they made their choices and we had to live with them. I wish he played a more supportive role while growing up, but his loss in my gain; I see where he went wrong and I'd never want to be a father like that. If I ever have a kid in the future (adoption being the more likely of means for obtaining one) I'd do good by him, much like the father in the OP is. Instead of arguing I'd raise him to make collected arguments. I'd encourage reading over television as it's mostly trash anyway. Raise him on word puzzles and riddles to promote critical thinking so he won't be taken over by the politically correct SJWs. Get him into sports at an early age teaching him how to be competitive and projecting good sportsmanship. Hook him on fishing young so he understands the grace of the past time and where we would have many of our deeper conversations of life while sitting on the water waiting for the bite. Things might not go over as smooth as I think them out to be, but nobody can say I never tried to be a great father. There would be give and take, and times I had to be strict but fair.. but I'd never be one of those 'just do whatever, I don't care' parents who neglect their kids when they lash out; you fucking see them everywhere, the kid yelling at the top of their lungs while the parent is enveloped in some other senseless shit ignoring them."

The problem is this: by forcing (on us, men) perception that they are 'weaker' gender, we treat them with a huge amount of handicaps on every level- which makes them 'stronger' gender.  When you add up this handicap to the fact that they never been weaker - it makes them really strong.   They were never weaker! And they know about it. They know it's all just a game.

It's obvious women hamster away lots of things, and it's a defining trait of the gender. There's no denying that.   All the numbers back that up too.

I will never pass up an opportunity again, even if I'm in a relationship, so long as there's no way of it negatively affecting whoever else I'm dating or fucking.

I can understand being promiscuous if your SO doesn't extend the same courtesy.  But you effectively have the ""it's okay when we do it"" attitude that feminists have.   I didn't call her a NAWALT. I'm speaking of guys who think they found their NAWALT.   I understand, but the temptation is always going to be there regardless of gender. That's just reality. However, there's a difference between that temptation existing, and people giving in to that temptation.  There are NAWALTS/unicorns out there, they are just extremely rare. So I agree that it's important to exercise caution, any woman can glue a unicorn horn to her forehead, (pretend she's something she's not). But I don't think it's fair to say they don't exist."

If you don't cheat on her, she'll cheat on you if the situation calls for it. I don't play a rigged game and end up being a loser.   There are lots of studies which show that women are more likely to cheat. It's called hypergamy. Fuck, they're even encouraged to do so in western societies. I'm hearing conversations from guys who say that women should fuck around in their twenties so that they'll be faithful in their thirtees. It's disgusting.

MGTOW,3cjqiv,NonNisiTe,-3,Wed Jul 8 19:08:48 2015 UTC,"I believe in the necessity of traditional marriage as the bedrock of society. Once you start messing with the foundation things get pretty messed up. We have been doing social engineering for the last fifty years and it is really easy to see all that chaos. Gay marriage is not the problem rather I see it as a result of all that has happened.   I am opposed to ""marriage equality"" because no matter what we call or it however loudly we proclaim it, based on nature (the ability to reproduce), homosexual couples can never produce what a heterosexual couple can. We can proclaim that there is a legal equality but never an equality based on nature.   With that in mind the issue over the Supreme Court case has less to do with the actual content of the decision but rather the methodology involved. I do not believe that the Federal Government (in this case the Supreme Court) is practicing an authority it has. The Constitutional system which allows for the great freedoms we have today protects the individual from government overreach through the Tenth Amendment. Simply put if the Constitution does not explicitly state the Federal Government has the authority to do this or that, they authority is given to the individual states. The states (through the people living in them) are free to decide what is legal or not legal in the state. If the people of my state voted democratically through a ballot initiative for gay marriage, I would disagree with their decision but I would have accept it as a valid democratic process. If the people by majority truly want this there are avenues to make it legal through democratic vote.  The problem is that I do not think a majority of people really want gay marriage. Remember Proposition 8 in California (2008)? Even in California (one of the most liberal and gay friendly states) a majority of the people voted to add in the state constitution that marriage is only between a man and a woman. What happened? A panel of judges went against the majority will of the people and forced gay marriage.   There are many states that democratically voted to enshrine heterosexual marriage as the norm in their state constitutions. It is what the individual states wanted and constitutionally had the authority to do so. Yet their voices do not matter because all it takes is 5 people (out of 9 on the Supreme Court) to vote in favor of gay marriage to overthrow the will of the people in individual states.  You ask the question why is it a problem for MRA/MGTOWs?   The enemy we fight is not feminists or the left. It is collectivism. The individual and the collective cannot coexist. When one gets more power, the other loses power. MRAs and MGTOWs are those men who stand up and say society does not have the right to force them to live or believe a certain way. We are free to live the life we choose to live. We are free to live based on how we as individuals choose to live. We are MGTOW because we are opposed to the collective. The collective does not have our best interest in mind, only I have my best interest in mind. As the collective wins us men will lose rights and freedoms. We often complain about the legal system being stacked in favor of women. Well just wait... it is going to get a hell of a lot worse. If you are not a part of the privileged class (Female, Minority, Gay, Transgender) then you will become the scapegoat of society. You will be blamed for all that is wrong in society (O wait. We already are).   This Supreme Court case is the most blatant grab of power for the state and for the collective that I have seen in my lifetime. It is scary. But the important thing to realize is that this is not an isolated event but rather a natural development of the growing collective.   Once the collective gains enough power then if you are in the minority you will have no rights to hold what you believe. You will be demonized and silenced. And then if it gets bad enough, purged. We already are being demonized. If you are opposed to abortion you are anti-woman. If you are opposed to open borders, you are a xenophobe. If you are opposed to gay marriage for any reason (even valid reasons) you are a bigot. If you are opposed to feminists you are a sexist... etc. I believe that the MGTOW fight is a fight against this collectivist mindset. You will be forced to accept a position that you are opposed to. This Supreme Court case is an example of this.  We see cases of this everyday in the news and posted on MGTOW. The collective left (there are progressives on the right too though) is a hydra with many heads. One of these heads is feminism, another LGBT. If you do not hold the same positions as these movements you are in the wrong and should be shamed. Compromise to them means holding on to their position as strongly as they do.   If this collectivist mindset continues to be institutionalized by federal overreach then we are in trouble. It is not paranoia to think that if the collective comes to power, individual belief will be criminalized. Read any of the dystopian books of our time (Animal Farm, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or any of Ayn Rand books). What happened in those books I can sadly see happening in our society.   If the collective wins, MGTOW loses."
MGTOW,3cjqiv,garbledcluster,3,Wed Jul 8 16:28:45 2015 UTC,"If you are opposed to gay marriage for any reason (even valid reasons) you are a bigot   There are literally no valid reasons for anyone to oppose gay marriage -- homosexuals do not hurt or demonise anyone, unlike most feminists. How does people who aren't you marrying people who also aren't you affect you exactly? Each man (or woman for that matter) should have the right to conduct their life as they feel fit, including sexuality and homosexual marriage.   I am glad the SC has intervened on this issue. A state has no business to call itself just if it does not extend the same rights and privileges to all of its citizens. Public opinion is irrelevant here, because none of the right wingers arguing against homosexual marriage are affected by its absence, unlike homosexuals themselves."
MGTOW,3cjqiv,rustyspaniard,4,Wed Jul 8 20:21:22 2015 UTC,"I am a gay man and not a social conservative at all, but I can completely see the above poster's point.  I believe the state should get completely out of marriage, and not favour or disadvantage any kind of union. Yes it is valid that homosexual unions get the same rights as heterosexual ones, but change of that sort should come from the correct place. I am not American and didn't realise that anything not explicitly left for the federal government is supposed to be decided by the states them selves. If that's the case then this was absolutely a bad move.  Gays may happen to be on the winning side this time the federal government takes more power, but in the long run we all lose, gay or straight, when government encroaches on the individual."

MGTOW,3cjqiv,NonNisiTe,0,Thu Jul 9 17:21:47 2015 UTC,"I am a religious person. I get demonized all the time for stating my thoughts. I am called a bigot because I do not walk in lockstep with those who are pro-homosexual. I think that with this issue and all other political issues we need, and must have, an honest discussion about it.   Please stay away from making universal blanket statements about things. When you say things like ""There are literally no valid reasons for anyone to oppose gay marriage"" or that homosexuals never hurt or demonize anyone, you are making a very naive and ignorant claim. There are valid reasons to oppose gay marriage and there are valid reasons to support gay marriage. There are bright and honest people on both sides of the debate. I will not make a blanket statement and say ""All gay people are like this"" or ""All people who believe this are stupid, etc.""   You are exhibiting what many of us on the right fear. I never wish ill on someone I disagree with. I do not want homosexuals to be persecuted nor do I want homosexual behavior criminalized. I am also somewhat in favor of extending many of the same benefits that a heterosexual couple has to a homosexual couple. Hell, if I had a best friend who was straight and never married, I would love to enter into a non-sexual union with him for the societal benefits.   The issue I have is that as a country we are moving away from protecting the minority. The beauty of the constitution is that it allows for a democratic process but also one where the minority opinion is protected. I have the right to disagree with you. I have the right to hold on to my opinion. I have the right to free speech even if it offends you. I have the right to enter into hate speech if I so choose. Our country is more and more moving away from protecting individual state sovereignty and individual rights toward serving the common good for the benefit of the state and the benefit of the collective hive mind.   I as a religious person am very affected by this decision if my freedom of speech and freedom of belief is limited or even criminalized. We already see this happening. There are people who are run out of business for stating their political beliefs by the government. I want the government way the hell out of the realm of business. If you personally disagree with my stance on an issue, you can get your business done somewhere. You should not have your livelihood destroyed for stating an unpopular position.   Just like gays do not want to be forced to live and believe a certain way neither do I. If I am in a position of power I do not believe in punishing my opposition. I would hope that same offer would be extended to me if I am not in a position of power. If the majority of people want gay marriage that is fine if my freedom to minority opinion is protected. I do not believe that I will be free to state my opinion. I believe the state will force Christian Church's to perform gay weddings contrary to their belief system. I believe that the state will imprison those who disagree with the collective hive mind. If the state goes this way it will no longer be the United States of America.   Also not everyone who disagrees with gay marriage is a ""right-winger"". There are people on the left who do too. If you want to have an honest discussion we can have it. If all you want to do is paint me (as your opponent) in negative terms without trying to understand me or my belief system, then there is no point to this. I always try to understand those I disagree with. If and when I am wrong, I am able to grow as a person. If all I do is demonize those I disagree with I will remain ignorant and live in mediocrity."

Even if their opinion is greatly in the minority, I do not think that they should be forced to adhere to the majority position.   This is the society that our founders built and tried to protect through the Constitution and Bill of Rights. I am fundamentally opposed to a more socialistic or totalitarian system where you must hold to the collective majority position or be damned. That is where we are headed. Just hope that those in power are people you agree with. Let's just say that this form of society did not turn out well for the Russian people."

MGTOW,3cjqiv,NonNisiTe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:31:33 2015 UTC,"Words have meaning. If we want to change culture we redefine and change words. The annoying thing about a discussion like this or any political debate is that the two sides talk passed one another and use similar terms but each mean something different.   For example, Person 1 says that homosexuality is unnatural and Person 2 says it is natural. Person 1 is using unnatural to mean that there is a natural order to how evolution works and how society works. Homosexuality is unnatural because it provides no natural function for the benefit of society. Heterosexuality is the norm and must be the norm or else we go extinct. Person 2 uses the term natural to mean that since it does exist in nature (meaning some people are born this way and that you can find some evidence of homosexual behavior among animals) that it naturally occurs. Because it exists it must be natural. As you can see Person 1 and Person 2 have differing perceptions on what one word means. Depending how we uses the word changes who has the correct opinion on this matter.  Similarly, the word marriage can have multiple meanings that differ based on perception.   To more traditionally minded people marriage is an institution focused on providing stability for the rearing of children. It is in society's best interest for these marriages to be successful. One of reasons why I think our society is so fucked is that our marriages do not work out and kids our left without this necessary stability. I would say a primary cause of dysfunction among youth today is they are born out of wedlock or are raised by single mothers. Most MGTOWs recognize the epidemic of men being raised by single mothers. Thus marriage to the traditionally minded is geared toward procreating and educating children. Marriage exists because of the love between the couple, but the binding-ness of marriage comes from bringing an equal being into existence.   To the more progressively minded people, and due to the invention of the pill, marriage is an institution focused solely on me loving my spouse. Insofar as I love my lover and want society to recognize my union, the marriage bond exists. As soon as I cease to love my spouse and we break up and divorce that marriage bond ceases to exist regardless of whether or not we had children together. The focus on this type of marriage is the love between the couple rather than the bi-product called children.  This mindset is the majority mindset today and I personally feel like it has damaged many children. If marriage is solely about love and people can fall out of love, there is no stability there to protect the good of the child. Homosexual marriage seems like a natural development based on this understanding of marriage. If marriage is only about love then it is an injustice to arbitrarily deny homosexuals the same benefits heterosexuals have.  If marriage is simply about the love between the spouses and receiving love from the other then there is no reason why homosexuals cannot be married. However if marriage is something more permanent and stable, there to protect offspring and develop them for the good of society, then this notion of marriage must be protected and defended at all costs.  Our society is decaying. MGTOW recognizes this. I am a child of divorce. My childhood was hell. I know how dysfunctional I am and how many kids are like me. I know how much I have been damaged by not being born into a family that was more stable. My emotional development was definitely stunted by it. Society has the obligation to create an atmosphere that encourages stabler environments for kids. As the family goes so goes society.   By promoting the notion that marriage is only about erotic love on demand and is dissoluble, the society is undermining itself. The more it promotes this second definition of marriage over the first, the more screwed up our kids will be.   I am not opposed to extending legal benefits to homosexual couples or granting them a civil union of sorts. However, I completely disagree with anyone who objectively says that in the order of nature a homosexual union is equal in all respects to a heterosexual union. They are not equal and can never be equal simply for the fact that by nature a man and woman can have a child whereas a man and man or a woman and woman cannot have a child. A heterosexual union can create life whereas a homosexual union cannot without turning to a third party (either a sperm downer or a surrogate mother).   By loosening the meaning of marriage we are not protecting institutions that must be healthy for us to have a healthy society. The more society pushes marriages that are less focused on children and more on feelings, the less children in heterosexual marriages will be protected because the importance of marriage will be reduced. Given we ""breeders"" already fucked over this notion of marriage due to the rampant promiscuity, children out of wedlock, and divorce. A stable marriage for the benefit of children should be the norm but it is becoming very rare. Instead our society subsidizes dysfunction and thus encourages dysfunction. Dysfunction is the norm and kids are disposable to be passed between parents until they become adults. In the end the only value a child ends up having is if they are wanted rather than intrinsic.   If we want to protect traditional marriage for the good of society then we cannot equate homosexual marriage with it. If we want to define marriage more simply in the order of love, then homosexuals are free to marry. However in the end definitions do matter and do change reality around us."

If she is ""actively manipulating the emotions"" of her toys, and having ""some of them make a clique against the others"" then it's because she has SEEN and/or HEARD those things occurring in front of her (i.e. Mom talking on the phone while the girl is eating breakfast: ""Oh Julie, no you need to make sure you don't let him see you actually enjoying that, you need to get him feeling guilty [...] Kan you believe what that bitch Susan did? Why she got Brittany and Jennifer to team up against me and then they got Lisa and Jamie to join in too!"" and so on... those little ears were listening, dissecting, analyzing that language, figuring out what the words meant, which ones were names versus action words, what that meant the named people were doing, and so on.)

They have to be... THAT is the part that is biologically ""hard-wired"": the sponge-like observation & emulation of everything.  It's why human children adopted into a family of a different language & culture (or even growing up in their own ethic family in the midst of a different one) take on that language & culture -- and why children who are literally ""feral"" never fit into any culture, and seldom even acquire language.  It's also one reason why I personally have come to believe that sticking kids in a regimented ""school"" is actually a form of abuse -- akin to cutting off from their senses, because effectively we are ""blindering"" them to the real world of adult human interactions: work AND social. And the younger they get stuck into such a place, the worse the total net effect."

They know what they discuss in their female only spaces, they understand the importance of it, and they also understand the importance of having a woman overlook and control conversation between men everywhere to prevent the very thing they're doing.   Why do you think this huge MRA/MGTOW/Red Pill spike came with the internet, and really took off on the internet? Men can talk anonymously, they can create their own spaces leaving women behind, and then the shitshow really takes off.   This is why bars, gentleman's clubs were shut down and prohibition took off. It wasn't about the alcohol, it was about women not being able to control what men discussed.   You sit a kid down with a bunch of MGTOW's these days and let them talk, 5 hours later that kid is never getting married. Another woman fucked out of alimony, child support, and divorce earnings.

I think that sums it up: they like to ser how much they can control men. It's a game. A power trip. Can you really blame them? A guy will do things for you for no reason - just cuz you got a pussy.

Now who knows, maybe they ""forgot"" because they were feeding me a line of BS about the ""wedding"" -- but it's happened when there was zero reason for them to lie to me (i.e. the thing I talked about on Wednesday was NOT me inviting them to some activity they needed an excuse to get out of or to BS me with).

MGTOW,3cd6dk,radpill,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:18:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that yes, controlling male space is about controlling males.   But I have to respectfully disagree on the details, and provide some historical context. This is not to nit pick, but to make sure we don't spread refutable claims that are incorrect and thus risk looking silly.     It's why they're so determined not to let men have their own male only spaces.     I actually witnessed the beginning of this. It was an early manifestation of attacking the ""patriarchy"". Women figured that men network in male only spaces, forming an ""old boys network"", from which they are excluded. Ergo, women thought they would be unable to advance in the workplace until female exclusion in male spaces was remedied. This was it, really. Women's solipsism made them assume men have an in-group preference like women do, so they lashed out at it. Just one of the many, many ways feminism is out of contact with reality.     This is why bars, gentleman's clubs were shut down and prohibition took off. It wasn't about the alcohol, it was about women not being able to control what men discussed.    Prohibition was not to control what men discussed. It was to keep them from spending money and time on something besides the women. It was to prevent men coming home drunk and being abusive. At the time the world of work was heavily male, and men could talk there if they wished; prohibition would have been a poor choice of an opening salvo in a war on male to male communication. So yes, women wanted prohibition to control male behavior, but not to control the spread of ideas.    they also understand the importance of having a woman overlook and control conversation between men everywhere to prevent the very thing they're doing.   Perhaps, at this point, this applies. But I still think it is more about not missing out, not having the world handed to them on a silver platter. It's like the Eddie Murphy skit, where he goes undercover as a white man. Hilarious!"
MGTOW,3cd6dk,oldredder,16,Thu Jul 9 14:01:43 2015 UTC,This is their NATURAL behaviour.
MGTOW,3cd6dk,ss_camaro,13,Tue Jul 7 00:54:28 2015 UTC,"One of the behaviors that's fascinated me recently is how women who hurt men will usually begin crying like they, themselves have been victimized.  Women and white knights will tell you it's because they feel bad, but don't believe it for a second.  Men have this ingrained response, whether biological or social, to comfort and protect a crying woman.  By crying, women preempt men's natural response to being hurt, which is typically anger directed at the person or thing that hurt them.  Basically, women have developed behavior that denies men the opportunity to examine and act on their own emotions because letting them do so might jeopardize the relationship or result in a violent outburst.  It's extremely effective, shamelessly manipulative, and so automatic that it's hard to believe that there's not at least some biological element."

By crying, women preempt men's natural response to being hurt, which is typically anger directed at the person or thing that hurt them.   No. I disagree.  Men -- and women -- have an ingrained biological response to comfort and protect a crying CHILD. Women then manipulate (or attempt to manipulate) this to their own advantage.  And yes, it is often used as a pre-attack ruse.  Men who are aware of this -- and there are by the way plenty of examples in nature of similar things, where the ""cry/wail"" is actually naturally understood as a ""danger"" signal warning of a potential ""snap"" attack. (Don't believe me?  Go watch some videos of cats interacting, especially female cats.)   It's extremely effective, shamelessly manipulative, and so automatic that it's hard to believe that there's not at least some biological element.   It isn't always effective.  Maybe I'm some freakish oddball, but my response to the female crocodile tears and the threat-crying has always been to laugh and chuckle.  I'm not some sociopath, I can -- for whatever reason -- easily distinguish those from a creature that is in actual pain. (In fact I've pretty much always been able to do so with children as well, being able to tell when the crying/tears are an attention-seeking ""act"", versus when they are in actual pain sufficient to need assistance... and by the way that last, is actually VERY rare.)  EDIT: Oh and for those who say ""bullshit, you can't tell the difference"" -- well apparently I am FAR from alone in this ability, ostensibly it's fairly common: http://www.sciencealert.com/how-to-tell-if-an-infant-is-crying-in-pain-or-just-a-cry-baby"

MGTOW,3cd6dk,Indigo_Monkey,6,Tue Jul 7 16:09:26 2015 UTC,it is the instinct born into every female to deceive males. Always.  It is only by proper upbringing that young girls learn from their fathers not to mistreat men.
MGTOW,3cd6dk,TheRealMouseRat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:53:05 2015 UTC,still its very easy if a girl has fucked up mother to raise a mutual front against her father.

MGTOW,3cd6dk,ExplicitEgalitarian,6,Wed Jul 8 07:15:15 2015 UTC,"I once had a very deep conversation about this with one of my friends girlfriends. She also happens to be a stripper so it was her job to see how much she could deceive men in order to make money.  She told me she learned at a very young age she could use sexuality to get anything she wanted. Her first experience with it was her teacher when she was around 13 years old. She caught him taking glances at her so she approached him after class about her bad grade and touched his arm and asked what she could do about it. He changed her grade for her to pass the class and she never had to do anything sexual with him, just give him the illusion of her being attracted to him.  She doesn't strip much now because she has accumulated a clientele of blue pill men that give her anything she wants without her actually sleeping with them. I challenged her one night after she was bragging about a guy that pays her $400 to let him buy her dinner and he buys her anything she asks for. She will tell him to put $3000 in her bank account and he'll do it. I bet her $50 she couldn't get a Xbox ONE from this guy within 3 hours delivered to her doorstep without ever talking to him. She texted him and 45 mins later he texted her back and said he dropped it off. Sure enough, there was a brand new Xbox ONE at her front door. She gave it to me because she doesn't play and I coughed up the $50. It was extremely insightful to see her perspective of men."

They learn it by their own individually, and then they communicate their reactions with other women, and then they make a net of diabolic manipulation and they start to enjoy it, and then they make experiments and learn more and more, with the excuse it is for their own good because men are stupid and they have to be controlled. and if you have an idiotic gorilla for a husband you have to know how to train him to give you things.

You only can choose the way you spend your money. ;)  (with pornography you spend money on a broadband and tissues ;) )   one more thing - let's face it- orgasm to pixels on screen is still an orgasm but it is somehow different than fucking a real woman.

MGTOW,3cdgdt,danonymous2,13,Tue Jul 7 18:01:13 2015 UTC,A friend and I are both MGTOW. I happen to be particularly good at understanding the social science behind demographics. So we go to music festivals and I do some research on what the desirable men in that demographic wear and act like. We dress and act that way and women approach us instead of us approaching them for the most part. We never tell them our real names or where we're from (we make it up). Then we bounce them back to our hotel or in some cases our tent and sleep with them and go home. Just this weekend we were at a music festival with a bunch of hippie chicks and we bought some bandanas and hemp clothes to fit in and we banged them and went on our way. We laugh about it because he's a corporate / nerdy type of guy and I'm more of a fashion forward / business type of guy but we found that just changing the way you dress and act even for a weekend makes it super easy to pick up women way out of your league. Also we follow our number one rule of NEVER giving them our contact information or social media profiles.
MGTOW,3cdgdt,igolfohio,3,Tue Jul 7 05:56:12 2015 UTC,Lol!  That sounds mildly fun.
MGTOW,3cdgdt,danonymous2,11,Tue Jul 7 06:11:18 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, I'd definitely recommend it. We have a lot of fun with it. We like to make challenges out of it too. We make up the most insane stories we can think of and whoever has the craziest story and gets a group of girls to believe it the other one of us has to buy a beer. It's ludicrous what women will believe if you tell your story in a serious tone. I bought him a beer this week for getting some girls to believe he was a top rated porn star on pornhub but only does furry porn. He told them to look for him on there when they get home and he'll be the one wearing a spider monkey costume. They totally bought it. The hardest part is not laughing and acting like he's spewing facts. Women don't really make for very insightful or engaging conversation so we make up for it by talking about stupid shit."
MGTOW,3cdgdt,igolfohio,6,Tue Jul 7 06:44:09 2015 UTC,"That's kind of funny.  I have a problem where I get irritated if I have to pretend.

I guess TRP doesn't necessarily make a girl make me horny, much less happy.  When I see through the act, I'm the only one standing behind the curtain, and I realize that the roses aren't for me, and the girl is absolutely not for me.  (If you have any tips for this, I'm really interested!)"
MGTOW,3cdgdt,SoullessTechnocrat,3,Tue Jul 7 07:34:05 2015 UTC,"I used to have the feeling of wanting to date girls I slept with. But once I discovered they provided no value in a relationship I decided I needed to be selfish and just seek the only thing they had value in, sex. So while I may blur the lines to them and they think I'm interested in them I'm really not. I just want to satisfy my sexual desires. I didn't like pretending at first but by setting challenges with a friend purely for our own amusement I started enjoying it. Both of us have achieved quite a bit so far in life so we have the means to afford traveling the country and doing fun stuff like this. I know most MGTOW guys overcome their sexual desires with no sex at all but that really doesn't work for me. We all have our methods of going our own way, I just happen to like maintaining an active sex life on weekends and running my business on weekdays. Keeps my mind clear for entrepreneurship because that's what I enjoy the most. I've come across some women that seemed promising and I considered maintaining contact with but I'm really happy with my life and I don't want to change that so I don't talk to them again. Do whatever makes it fun for you. Find what you want and go get it."

But then after marriage most bedrooms go dead so it's once a month or once a year or even less, so even that BS doesn't fly.   People need to stop posing and start being honest.

In addition to the numerous suggestions already listed, I simply occupy my time when I feel that need creep up.

I guess it does sort of make sense from that perspective. Extra pay, but pretty much without the risk of a dependapotamus woman squandering it all, and then running off with the extra (and more); at a minimum the ""child support"" bit would be off the table.    EDIT:   They certainly have opened the door to the possibility of this kind of thing; and it is PROBABLY going to happen.  And in a very real sense -- although no doubt some would try to claim the contrary --  they have (whether they realize it or not) already removed ""sexual intercourse"" and ""consummation"" as being a necessary feature to make a marriage ""valid"".    I mean AFAIK there is no requirement, nor even any assumption that there be ""penile penetration"" of some (any) spousal hole -- among other things, that would invalidate ""lesbian"" couples -- and I'd rather doubt that they're going to be so blatant as to claim that some OTHER form of ""penetration"", be it digital or lingual or other, is required either.    The language the courts have CHOSEN to use is the euphemistic/ambiguous words around ""love"" and ""companionship"" and ""relationships"" etc -- which can arguably just be affectionate even zero-touching ""platonic"" -- rather than refer to any ""sexual activity"" (banal OR deviant), and AFAIK the decisions never mention anything even remotely related to orgasm (that would be to imply some ""duty"" to engage in sex -- something they have entirely and quite purposefully REMOVED from the definition of marriage {because it once WAS present}).  Moreover, under the 14th amendment, one could easily argue that any ""proof"" that might be demanded was entirely arbitrary and unequal/unfair... unless the entity demanding proof could also show that it has already somehow systematically required of any/all other couples (i.e. that all couples had performed at least some overt sexual-activity in front of witnesses). A court battle over that would actually be pretty damned funny, as it would reveal a whole array of euphemistic BULLSHIT that underlies the present system."

The construct of ""marriage"" in legal terms and a legal sense has -- stage by stage over the past many decades -- been essentially and indeed almost entirely ""divorced"" from actual sex (especially in it's original definition), and its religious & family-property construct roots, and it has instead been turned instead into something entirely different: a ""romantic"" social-construct that is given certain economic & legal privileges/benefits.  The rationale for that special status, by the way, especially tax status and other economically related things (i.e. government spousal pensions, etc) is really now almost entirely without any actual logical or rational link."
MGTOW,3ceurv,thrownaway_MGTOW,2,Wed Jul 8 10:38:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's easy to get away with as long as you take reasonable precautions...I don't think you can prove any marriage is fake   All it would take is reasonable suspicion for an investigation to be warranted or a fellow soldier to raise a red-flag. Military prosecutors could easily prove you concocted a ""contract"" marriage, for which you would be charged with Article 132, Fraud Against Government, for deceiving the Government out of the monies for the many benefits given. I'm sure there are other Articles you could be charged with as well. It's illegal and foolish and you would be living a lie (also contrary to what MGTOW stands for i.e. aspiring to live one's authentic moral truth).   For a service member, getting caught could mean federal prosecution and a sentence of up to five years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines. Under military law, the service member could also face, in severe cases, a dishonorable discharge and up to 10 years confinement. http://archive.armytimes.com/article/20140929/NEWS06/309290027/Marriage-fraud-can-earn-you-prison-sentence-stiff-fines"
MGTOW,3ceurv,pawsahf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"It would be one thing if you married a cancer patient then the military enrolled spouse received a $20K bank transfer, or if they found a ""Contract Marriage"" Craigslist ad.  Think about how you would prove a sham marriage; there's a prenup, they keep separate expenses and bank accounts, there's a couple hundred a month going from one spouse to the other, there's no sex.  All of that is pretty normal stuff in a marriage.  Even if you could prove in a court of law the spouses don't love each other that's not even a requirement.  What's left, one spouse married the other to get access to resources they could provide?  Then almost all marriages are sham marriages.  Those examples in that article you linked involved immigrants, but in one of those there was some kind of wire fraud and another it was a ring operation.   In other words it was pretty blatant.  If someone was to marry a trusted friend with no large money transfers there's nothing to worry about."
MGTOW,3ceurv,pawsahf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:16:02 2015 UTC,"If someone was to marry a trusted friend with no large money transfers there's nothing to worry about.   You seem to be in denial about the indisputable fact you and your ""trusted"" friend would be living a fraudulent lie and committing a crime.  Again, you would be easily outed by an associate, co-worker or confidant (you also overlook you would be powerless to control unintended consequences that arise in every criminal enterprise). And in a pinch to save his own ass, your 'trusted' friend would cooperate with investigators against you if it helped his legal situation (a truism of the criminal justice system that happens every day).    Hypothetically, if you were investigated would you really be willing to continue the charade under INTENSE SCRUTINY by demonstrating your carnal love for your partner? NO is the answer. If YES, you are a recidivist criminal, plain and simple.  And everyone in your past and present would be fair game for contact by the government as it built a case against you. Your lie would be as easy to prove Rachel Dolezal's racial impostership (all it took was a single phone call to her parents). Based on your muddled thinking here, something tells me you are less than a criminal mastermind and would leave an obvious evidence trail.   And investigators have the authority to sift through your entire life for clues and evidence.  So even this thread in Reddit could be used to demonstrate intention to deceive the government.  Once Aagain, what part of it is illegal don't you understand?"

If he had just not put the names and pictures he would be fully sympathetic. However then he wouldn't have seen her trash him like that.  There is zero reason to seek to hurt another human being like that, but women just don't have any compassion whatsoever. I really don't think women are even capable of love.

MGTOW,3c9650,sardinemanR,4,Mon Jul 6 03:58:20 2015 UTC,I'm honestly wondering if he put all of that on 4chan as a roundabout way of telling her how he feels. Only problem is she did not see it in the way he was hoping for. Let alone her response.  At the very least he seems to do a decent job of sucking it up towards the end.  She's pretty decent looking.

She's on the lower tier of healthy looking girls her age (weird eyebrows and thin lips are her biggest visible flaws), so about a 6 is accurate.  In the US girls pack on over 30 lbs between 16 and 25 so theres a good chance she becomes a 3.5 in a few years."

""I am screaming with laughter"" ""this is glorious""   Yeah, that bothered me too.  When I was younger I frequently had fat girls crushing on me.  When I found out I felt embarrassed and uncertain how to deal with her in the future.  But I sure as hell didn't bust out laughing.  I think I was kind of sympathetic for all the times I had crushed on some lil' hottie who wasn't into me.  Like a role reversal and now I'm the hottie just because I'm not fat.  That girl was literally shitting her pants just a few years ago.  Then puberty hit and now she's momentarily passing through her peak SMV with the moral maturity of a teenager.  How could it not go to her head, in this world of constant affirmation for all things young and female?  A century or two ago if you wanted a teenage girl you negotiated with her father, maybe gave him a couple of goats for her.  He was glad to have one less mouth to feed and happy that she had a safe home to go to if you had a reasonably decent reputation in your village (also, free goats).  The downside was you were stuck living with the boring old cow she turned into a few years later, and the shrieking bitter harpy she became after that.  Are we better off now?  Not sure.  Certainly here in the middle of the Obesity Epidemic, Maiden/Matron/Crone is less appealing at every stage."

MGTOW,3cbpxj,SingeLord,5,Mon Jul 6 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"What's the point of loving a woman for non reproductive reasons if she can consciously choose to not love you anymore at random times?  This is the strongest reason why I don't feel attracted to women anymore. Long term relationships are basically like buzzers and you don't know when that alarm call wakes her up. Of course there are triggers like her meeting some rich or feral male. I personally also experienced that this behavior can rub off on a woman from her female friends who encouraged her to listen to her randomly upcoming feelings.  Women seem to have a extremely low inhibition threshold to throw everything overboard you've build up together in years when it's safe enough to do so.  Laying them and disappearing before they lock you down is my way to go. Some women even seem like pleasant persons to be with, but who am I kidding, their true face will show up sooner or later.

MGTOW,3c8pnd,OGSohail,20,Sun Jul 5 23:13:05 2015 UTC,"Excellent question. Where do I start?   I started reading things on TRP and eventually found MGTOW. What really drove the point home was Esther Villar's The Manipulated Male. That book changed my life. Every question that I had about men and women was answered by that book. Before finding MGTOW I kept wondering why I was so unhappy. The girls that liked me weren't good enough. My accomplishments weren't good enough. I had to become a provider. If only I can be a better provider things will start to make sense. I had an invisible carrot in front of me and it frustrated me, relentlessly. And here's the kicker that drove the point home: After graduating University, I guess I had become more mature, and older men started hanging out with me, I must have entered the ""Man Club"". Anyway, after a few beers they all came out with the truth: These guys were fucking miserable. And they were all married. Suddenly I could see it everywhere. They were domesticated work horses. Working shit jobs, no time to see the kids, no energy or money to do what they wanted, having to pay that dick of a mortgage while honeybuns is taking out loans for that new Iphone. Is this what I was torturing myself for? FUCK. THAT.   It's hard to say which was the one defining moment, but I guess it was realizing how difficult women can be to live with, especially if you're married. Yes, their titties are awesome and all, but fuck do they come with baggage. I kept on hope for an AWALT, until one girl I thought was a unicorn (really, you guys) turned out to be a common horse - AND - seeing that my own mother was as AWALT as the rest of them. The one woman who will or should have your back will also only see you as a utility.  As many have said, Feminism didn't change women, it allowed them to be who they truly are.

Same result: within 6 months they wanted me out of their life. So the last time I figured I was doing something wrong and started searching the internet for answers. Found out it was NORMAL for a woman to dump a man for expressing inconvenient emotions and emotional support is never to be had. Then the question becomes: why have a woman in my life if they can't be supportive? Just do the list of what could be asked for as support then cross off the items that will never happen: financial, emotional, cleaning, maintenance (home/car/lawn), cooking.

All of these things are either out of the question or a HUGE burden to her which will be griped about and/or end the relationship.    Indeed. And even the biggest/primary one: assurance of a biological heir/and the ability to actually FATHER that child to adulthood.  Which was one of the FIRST things that was ""lost"" to men (or given over by men to women).  The old ""partriarchal"" system wasn't ""equal"", but it was BALANCED/FAIR -- it was a mutually beneficial contract -- each side getting something of value, and each side suffering some constraint. Support was present -- at least in certain regards -- because it was an essential part of the ""partnership"". Men didn't look for ""emotional"" support from their wives, because there was no delusion that relationship was some uber ""be-all & end-all"" thing; instead they looked to and EXPECTED to get emotional support from other men, in the safety of MALE-ONLY spaces.   It wasn't the ephemeral touchy-feely ""romantic LOVE"" bullshit either -- THAT was in fact for most of human history looked on as being the height of immaturity and delusional nonsense, impulsivivity subject to change on a whim -- and by either party -- undependable, erratic, problematic, dramatic, traumatic, and so on.  So it was, and so it is ... the fact that people have elevated ""romatic love"" to some artificially pedestalized ""ideal"" doesn't change the fundamental NATURE of the whole superficial, impulsive ""infatuation"" cycle that underlies it.    And of course, as you have noted -- all of the REST of that ages-old ""deal"" -- has been canceled on the one side of the contract, with all of the duties in regard to that shifted off onto men and/or machinery (made by men).  The end result is that women REALLY AREN'T essential to a specific MAN; and in most cases they bring essentially NOTHING into the equation, nothing of any functional value (at least that they cannot withdraw on a whim) -- whereas by contrast the man is still essentially expected to come carrying a plethora of ""gifts"", and moreover to essentially burden himself with them potentially for decades as a beast of burden.  IMO no ""sane"" man would willingly enter that arrangement.  Our society WILL inevitably suffer as a result -- because the better quality men, the more rational, more serious, more self-disciplined -- will be the LEAST likely to reproduce, and therefore also the least likely to pass on their instruction.  But this is the CHOICE that ""society"" has made."

MGTOW,3c8pnd,Morranaii,5,Mon Jul 6 23:48:29 2015 UTC,"I am still trying to figure out why this happened. Why we swallowed the romantic oneitis-bullshit pill so easy.   There is an argument, one that I think has some pretty solid validity & evidence, that it not only coincided with the coming of leisure & the industrial age, but that it is effectively caused by it -- or perhaps more correctly by the ""disconnection"" of people from the land, from animals, from farming, from the seasonal cycles of life, from growing and being responsible for their own food, etc.  Because when you move into an urban environment, and especially as modern conveniences grow, you move into an increasing artificial world. And here I'm not talking just about -- as some have -- that it is a world of straight lines instead of curves, of concrete instead of dirt; although those things ARE true and real... No, I'm talking about the artifice of things like the clock & the factory or office. The waking not with or before the sun but according to an alarm clock, set to some essentially arbitrary time. The work of the day is then done likewise according to the clock, both in terms of start time, end time (also in essence ""arbitrary"" and not at all relative to the world outside & around), and even the measurement of the ""quantity"" of work: everything is in ""time"" units.  Work on the farm is not designated in time units, but in tasks needing to be done, and having been achieved. Didja get the fence mended? This is a yes or no, and possibly a question of quality: Didya do it right & good this time so's the cows won't get out agin?  Note just as importantly what is absent: there is little interest over whether 10 minutes was spent on it, or 3 hours; and with good reason, the time a person takes on some task really doesn't represent a useful metric in and of itself.  OK, all of that seems like I'm just digressing, but I'm getting around (back) to the point: In the country, on the farm, the interaction with things is DIRECT, it is concerned with REALITY.  In the city, it is far more artificial, more regimented, and nearly everything is INDIRECT and is concerned with PERCEPTION.  Is it any wonder then... that people then began looking for things that were a kind of ""escape"" from that artificiality, that regimentation? They -- the city dwellers -- then engage in fantasy construction: imagining all the forest critters to be cutesy little cuddly adorable critters, that the forest itself is a place of pretty flowers and rays of sunlight & verdant green, that farms and cowboys and all kinds of other things rural were some idyllic state; that the ""noble savage"" engaged in free & easy lovemaking, and that... well, yada yada blah blah blah...  All kinds of... well quite frankly: nonsense.  Note that the people who still live in the country and still work the land in the age-old cycles and seasons -- people like the Amish -- they tend to have little or no ""romantic"" delusions concerning nature OR human love & marriage (and it is not that they entirely discount the element of physical attraction; just they recognize it as superficial & ephemeral, and should never be the sole determining factor in any match, nor indeed probably even a main factor).  There are other arguments as well -- indeed a whole host of ""just so stories"" (especially from the evo-psych camp); and some of those may have varying degrees of merit, but the primary factor does indeed seem to be the ""disconnect"" with the real, natural, physical world."

MGTOW,3c8pnd,DarkestJ,10,Mon Jul 6 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"I created an account just to answer this :)   I've just hit my late 20's and my life is consumed by the two businesses I own & run (one I own, the other I am co-founder). I used to believe sacrificing (or foregoing) relationships in order to move forward in life was something only a person who lacked integrity would do. However I've come to realise, this would probably only apply to a parent / child relationship. Considering I have no kids and then also taking into account my previous relationship history (full of drama), it's really not a sacrifice at all. If anything I would recommend any young person (male or female) who is looking to succeed in business to put off being in a serious relationships for as long as possible (marriage indefinitely... unless you're female of-course haha ). Although I consider myself to be somewhat introverted, I do really well in social settings and have always been the life of the party (provided I get my own space & time before and after). I've found since seeing some minor success in my business, social settings are getting harder to handle and usually become an interview rather than a good time. Primarily because womens ears have a tendency prick up when they hear ""single, 27, business owner"". The only really good times I have anymore is with my best friends on a guys night out. Which by the way is happening less and less frequently due to girlfriends and wives not allowing it. About a year and a half ago, I moved to the city (from a much smaller town). Because I had been single for a number of years, I figured its probably expected of me to have a girlfriend. So a few months later I found myself in a relationship. The relationship was probably the best relationship I've ever been in. We are very like minded and get along really well. The problem though was that I knew I was in the relationship because society was telling me to. Meaning we never really had any sort of emotional connection (at least not on my end) and I was doing it to please others. Pairing that with the fact I lost all productivity on my work and spent a ton of my savings going out to dinners, events, clubs etc (obviously paying for us both). The slap in the face though was that she makes around 70k a year (an above average salary here in Australia), now I'll admit I make more than that, but it certainly wasn't a two way street in regards to who's going to pay (at best it was 80/20). I made the decision to end the relationship. We're still close but it highlighted (at least to me) the one sidedness of relationship these days and reminded me why I was single for so long previously.   tl:dr losing my time, my space, my money all for the sake of trying to please society... I can understand why people who get married for the wrong reasons are unhappy."

MGTOW,3c8pnd,General_Fear,13,Mon Jul 6 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"I'm a Christian MGTOW who came to it via Ecclesiastes, which realizes things such as the hedonic treadmill ""Chasing after the wind"" and rebuking women whose ""heart is a snare"" and whose ""hands are chains""...  I tend to see and experience that it really is true that with greater wisdom comes greater sorrow, and that the things we learn come at a cost since it tends to devalue all the material things we seem to strive endlessly for... Ecclesiastes is really quite beautiful and poignant in illustrating that.    At the end of Ecclesiastes the teacher informs us to center our lives around God. It's here that I connect the dots, because women have essentially usurped God and have become our center through gynocentrism, as it was through women that Satan brought about the downfall of man. MGTOW can potentially correct this error, however i think it's much more common for us to make ourselves as center, but I think that it's more correct to put God at the center because even if I go my own way and acquire knowledge, master a hobby or skill, it doesn't really matter because by tomorrow it will all be forgotten/done away with, so the only thing that really matters is being together in the light of a good God, who is eternal, who is our constant unto eternity, and it's through him that we can find meaning outside of vanity.  It's also through art, nature, and beauty that I tend to understand that there is a VERY sad element to the universe. If truth is inclined towards sadness, and if beauty represents virtue, then it makes sense that the universe in all her splendor, will carry this kind of sad spirit. It's here that I understand that the desire that prompted all of creation was a great and lonely melancholy -- for God created us to be with him."
MGTOW,3c8pnd,Morranaii,6,Mon Jul 6 06:20:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a Christian MGTOW who came to it via Ecclesiastes   LOL, well hello there brother!  Years ago I started memorizing that book... took a bit to memorize the first 2 chapters, and then chapter 3 was just too easy (because of the Byrds of course), and then getting through chapter 4 became too much of an effort... gets a bit depressing in there around verse 2 & 3 (although I have to admit it almost entirely alleviates the guilt over NOT having kids), I basically stopped at the end of verse 6 (IMO a good place to take a break).  Pretty much been ""living"" there in that verse 6 of quietness/tranquility ever since.  Keep in mind that it's not that I haven't read the rest, and don't have snippets of that memorized (especially chapter 12, though actually living it -- particularly 12:12 -- is a bit more difficult).    BTW, I've always taken note that indeed it was via woman than man CHOSE to ""fall"". Per Paul in Timothy, Adam wasn't deceived, but made a deliberate decision, a specific choice... and yet in that willfulness, well immediately afterward it's notable how he attempts to shift the blame, and of course she does as well.    And in a very REAL sense, that pattern has been repeated and is rather blatantly obvious in nearly all of humanity -- man blames the woman, and the woman seeks about for anyone and everyone (or even any and every thing) else to blame for ""tempting"" her or ""tricking"" her or ""trapping"" her (even though of course BOTH of them have made their choices -- the woman seeking vainglory and being enraptured with the superficial and the promise of more... and the man seeking her companionship, or perhaps more correctly afraid of losing it -- it being made clear that he had spent some substantial time alone and had become truly lonely).  These to me are fundamental ""truths"" whether one wants to interpret them as a direct literal story of two individuals, or as a mythpoetic construct around archetypes is fundamentally irrelevant because the end meaning & application is, or ought to be essentially the same (and indeed ""Adam"" in the Hebrew is not the proper name we use it for but simply meant ""man"" and technically applied to the female as well as the male, and likewise ""Eve"" initially simply called ""Woman"" and only altered afterwards, again descriptive terms rather than formal names).  I also think you are correct in being careful of the emphasis too much on self -- yet of course the problem with the emphasis on God is that far too often it ends up becoming an emphasis on everything BUT God, and instead becomes ambition & avarice as well as all of the other pitfalls as well, including not the least (if not the most obvious) being the seeking after status and vainglory; their own reward, as hollow and ephemeral as we are warned they are."

MGTOW,3c8pnd,SoullessTechnocrat,6,Thu Jul 9 05:04:12 2015 UTC,"Several things. No a lot of things. But I'll share what comes to mind foremost.  1.) The life of married men. I watched guys who were real men. After they were married, they were not men anymore. ""Yes dear. Whatever you say dear."" Because of fear of divorce and being taken to the cleaners, married guys turn themselves into wimps who kiss their wives' ass.  2.) Divorce laws. I did not know that alimony is for life. And in some states, if you can't make alimony payments, you are thrown into jail. When I heard that, I was done with marriage.  3.) Love is bullshit. Do women fall in love? Yes. But it's probably not you. Women will long for that alpha male with a big cock who was hot and was amazing in bed. But that guy never married her. So she will settle for whoever she can get. She will marry a guy who has got money. Because she needs a provider that can pay for her kids. Why then is love bullshit? Because she will tell the beta guy what he wants to hear in order to get the ring on her finger.  4.) Women today are garbage. Women complain about men. But they are no bed of roses either. Women today are demeaning, demanding, insulting, condescending, manipulative, selfish, narcissistic, dishonest, hostile . .  I can go on. But you get the drill. A relationship? Why bother.  MGTOW gives me freedom, peace of mind and money in my wallet."

Pisses me off how women take advantage of the ones that they ""love"" (clearly don't since they're taking advantage. If you love someone, treat them with love not like they're an object you treat yourself with) in a relationship knowing that the man won't do much since he's affraid of breaking up.

MGTOW,3c8pnd,danonymous2,5,Tue Jul 7 03:54:19 2015 UTC,"Growing up, I had mostly female teachers in the public school system, and I noticed how the girls got away with everything but boys were always dragged over hot coals for any minor transgression. Girls were given a lot more encouragement and also leniency when it came to school work and generally did better than the boys. Teachers were terribly biased (except the male teachers!)  Home life was a shitshow. Mom is an abusive narcissist but that really just means she's more female than the average woman; her solipsism is just deeper. I come home from school and right away nag nagnagnagnagnagnagnagnangang it never ended. She never shut up. Constant barrage of nagging and lecturing. It only stopped when dad came home, she would nag him.  That was my first introduction to marriage - dad coming home after a 12 hour shift (he was a millwright and a welder) to his parasite (she didn't work) wife who would immediately begin barraging him with nagging and criticism. And she was the victim, of course, her life was so hard right.  Highschool time! Cue the hole ""nice guy"" phase of my life. After highschool I was so resentful of women I treated them rudely and I started getting laid. Go figure.  Mixed blessing because I started to date and dating turned into relationships and after 10 years of romantic interaction with women, and reading about mensrights, and theredpill, I said fuck it, I'm done with them... and then I discovered that other guys were doing what I'm doing (MGTOW).

MGTOW,3c8pnd,leREALSHIT,3,Mon Jul 6 14:32:33 2015 UTC,I hate the rat race and want to attain financial independence (FI) so that I can retire early.

MGTOW,3c8pnd,Natsume21,4,Mon Jul 6 15:40:22 2015 UTC,"How right you are.  I never married, no kids, 56, retired.   I am financially independent.     Had lots of relationships with women over my life but am truly done with them now.   I was always a ""mgtow"".   I think women were attracted to me because I never really needed them, plus I had my shit together (successful engineer).   The thing was, I really liked sex but did not like the inevitable boredom of committed relationships.   I probably only had two girlfriends that were somewhat interesting/intellectual, the rest of them just bored me after the initial relationship buzz wore off.  I would look at them and think to myself, if it weren't for sex would I even be friends with this person?  I would imagine them as a man and realize the whole ""till death do you part"" meme was such bullshit.  strategy for FI:     Women, children, cars, boats are huge money drains, especially dangerous when you are young and trying to build up capital.   Be very careful with this.    Start as young as possible.   Get a good paying job (blue or white collar, doesn't really matter), it is critical that you be able to save a significant percentage of your net takehome EVERY MONTH.    Forget about the ""get rich quick"" fantasy.   FI will take 20+ years for all but a tiny few.   Learn to live well below your means, easy for some, almost impossible for others, I still live this way even though I no longer need to.   I buy expensive things (like fly rods, cameras, etc) but I buy things that last a lifetime, useful things that I can enjoy but are not so expensive that they could derail my financial plan.   Buy decent used cars and run them into the ground for at least the first 10-15 years of your career, forget the new beemer, major money pit when you are young and starting out (Toyota Corolla or pickup highly recommended, I was late 30's before my first new car and it was a relatively inexpensive Tacoma 2whl drive pickup).    Learn about money and how to make it work for you, invest, take some chances, figure out your risk tolerance, diversify, etc.   Establish a Roth IRA and try to max it every year (hard to do when you are just starting but try, the Roth is the best thing out there for the long term).   If your employer has a 401K match ALWAYS contribute enough to get it.  There is a lot more, I could probably write a book on this."

MGTOW,3c8pnd,leREALSHIT,4,Tue Jul 7 08:28:12 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Both my serious relationships left me dejected and mentally frayed. MGTOW philosophy reminds me that I matter foremost in my life.   I feel like I've been headed this way for most of my life.    My first relationship started when I was 17. I craved validation and acceptance from her because I'd been a nerd for most of my life (Black nerds don't much love in the US). She cheated on me, getting pregnant by a drug-dealer with a nice car. I was fucked up emotionally by that for a while. Went to college and rebelled to point (nothing crazy). Smoked bud a lot though. Had girls chase me down. Got sex pretty regularly but realized that they were all only interested in guys who had something to offer. Guys with bud, booze, money, or athletic scholarships got the most attention. Didn't bother me, just an observation. I banged a few just because I could but resisted relationships until... I met my NAWALT. She was gorgeous with all the physical features I like. Smart, Phi Beta Kappa, Merit Scholar, Debate Team, Magna Cum Laude, etc. I wined and dined her, showed my best behavior and always made time for her. To good to be true, right? Except, it was destroying me mentally. I developed anxiety because I felt like I had to impress her constantly. I felt like I was in a competition with an imaginary man, who could take her from me.  When I started to flounder or show reticence, she found an excuse to do wild shit. We would breakup three times. The first time (when I initiated the breakup) she went and fucked her ex that same night so she could feel something. We wound up back together a few months later after she threw herself at me during a party. There are two types of people that I hate and refuse to associate with: thieves and liars. She knew how serious this was feeling was for me. The second time, (when I initiated) she called me a liar to my face. I slammed fists down and broke workdesk in half. She would later admit that she did this ""just to get a reaction out of me"". I didn't speak to her and became a bit of a recluse after. She had effectively become an unperson to me. This persisted for about three months. One night during a party she shows up and starts orbiting me. Eventually, she cornered me and asked how I was. I was angry. She coaxed me back in with promises of things being different and a hate fuck. In hindsight, I was a Simp she could rely on to take any abuse dolled out, an emotional punching bag. We lasted all the way through graduation and a year after while we both in graduate school doing the long-distance thing. I took trips, bought plane tickets, made long drives, Skyped, and sent snail mail letters just because. I texted everyday with messages of love. I aided her friends when they asked my help and I sincerely believed we would be together. But I was broke. I couldn't afford to move to be near her. She began to mention marriage after our mutual friends had a kid (which she took an off-putting interest in). I told her that marriage would be foolish with so little income. I think she thought she could sway me if she was persistent. For a few months, she grew colder and colder until she finally says ""we should take a break while I take finals."" Sensing BS, stressing over my own finals and wanting to spare myself complete dejection, I told her that if she wanted to end it that she should ""just do it now, so I can move on."" She said ""I just need to not worry about you while deal with these tests."" Whatever. She calls me 2 weeks later and says it's over. She said, she ""felt like an afterthought."" Really? After all the things I did to show my love and appreciation. I spent the next 15 months in a state of abject depression and worthlessness. It was the darkest place I've ever been to. I was suicidal and needed help. The constant back and forth, breakup/makeup, and anxiety about my worth as a partner had destroyed me. I couldn't see myself as whole without her. Strangely, through the sex I'd had in the years before I met her I had grown incredibly confident, only to then have a woman ruin it. I imagined that in the past people would just call this heartbreak. This was worse. This was the remnant of a calculated destruction of a man who wanted to be happy together. I never wanted to feel like that again. I said I would never let a woman be my reason for confidence or my reason for self-loathing. No woman would ever make me feel that pain again. I had to get better. I started running and doing bodyweight fitness as a way to pass the time. I quit smoking and only drank on weekends. Changed my diet. Cleaved a lot of no-good friends from life entirely. My mood improved slowly. I moved in with my father (who was in poor health), found a decent job and started saving money. In essence, I had started going my own way in everything but name. I discovered MGTOW on YouTube after watching a few painfully sobering Red Pill Philosophy videos. I couldn't go back. MGTOW was the only thing in the TRP world that made sense. Why go on some revenge fantasy kick, fucking countless plates trying to fill a void left by the one who hurt me? I wasn't interested. It seemed like inviting trouble. I focused instead on myself without women being a factor. I had learned a lesson that cost me a lot of time, money, opportunity, humiliation, and mental health; the lesson that women are poisonous to my worldview and progression."

Most PUAs don't investigate and they'll take whatever. My opinion is that's too risky.  I got into the MGTOW mindset because of Red Pill illuminating truths about female nature. The biggest truth I'd say is that you have to know things really need to be patriarchal in a m/f relationship for anything to work out - especially long term. I also noticed that being friends with women you're not fucking is not just pointless, but toxic and shitty. I'm not religious, but I'd say being friends with a woman you're not fucking is an insult to God. God puts all these hot women on earth and you're going to hang out with ones you're not attracted to and not-fuck them? Why? What kind of an ungrateful existence is that??? Fat, unattractive, and feminist women ALL do come around too. The biggest myth out there is that they don't come around. LIES. They ALL come around meaning they'll want sex with you at some point, but the problem is they'll try and drag you down into their framework. The ""fat girl"" frame or the ""unattractive girl"" frame or the ""feminist girl"" frame. Static, noise, shaming language, and guilt trips. No. Just NO.  There's a lot of down time.

MGTOW,3c8pnd,cagethepepper,2,Mon Jul 6 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"I lived through a horrible divorce on the child's end.  All the nightmares people here talk about, my dad lived them.  My mom accused him of sexually abusing us.  I remember scumbag Child Services employees pulling us out of class and trying to get us to say it was true.  When they finally divorced a decade later(!) my dad wound up living out of a car, then a room where he, my two siblings, and I often stayed because mom was drugged up or suicidal on a regular basis.  She let a felon on the run move in with her (she didn't know, I believe, but I fucking told her he was a compulsive liar and a bad dude after I met him).   My dad worked 18 hours a day for eight years to take care of us, put us through college, and save enough to eventually buy a small house.  So yeah, there's the whole, ""Why would I want to go/put my kids through that?"" thing going on for me.  Even so, I dated as a young adult.  Even fell deeply in love once and planned to ask her to marry me.  Of my three long-term relationships, I got cheated on in all of them.  All three are very successful career women, married (two to classic betas and one to a doctor), and would classify themselves as feminists.  They all came from far wealthier backgrounds and paid for the expensive dinners and outings they wanted, so I wasn't financially used/screwed by them, thankfully.  After the third time I decided to take a break from dating.  I would never go back.  It was around then that I started making good money while working in New York and witnessed first-hand the intersection of wealth, hedonism, and the lows even women with a good education, job, and family would go to for money, attention, popularity, and/or to feel empowered by their sexuality.  I've seen far too much to go back."

MGTOW,3c8pnd,Morranaii,2,Tue Jul 7 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"I got cheated on by my ex girlfriend twice whom I saw as a princess (biggest mistake)  and I proceeded  to turn into the biggest beta in this whole world. I cried and went through severe and crippling depression for years because the love of my life showed me her true colors. She went from the woman I wanted to marry to someone who inflicted so much pain to me without nary a care for the memories and emotions we shared.   Since then I've pretty much closed up my heart to any woman. The way I see it is that if she could leave and change into a colossal bitch after how much damn effort I put into the relationship, any woman can do the same.   I felt used and like women just have this upgrade mentality with men. I've been single for about two years now and honestly have never been consistently happy in my life. Sure there are times when I miss a woman's small frame, her curves, and the smell of her hair against mine as we lay in bed, but it's not worth the sacrifice and trade off anymore to me."
MGTOW,3c8pnd,SoullessTechnocrat,2,Tue Jul 7 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"A woman came by and swept me off my feet.  After she dumped me I knew that I couldn't let that happen to me again.  The humiliation, loss of pride, heartbreak.  I felt like my body and mind was giving up on me and that I was going to die.  My heart felt like it was pumping cement for a week after being dumped.  The #1 thing that hit me the hardest was suddenly going from being loved to being trash.  The only way that a transition like that could happen is if I was trash to her from day 1.  This was 17 years ago.  There is no point in putting back together a shattered heart if you can't find all the pieces.    The bright side is life is financially easy for me.  I'll be drawing a military pension in less than 4 years.  The career field I'm in is easy to find employment with and should be looking at 6 figures with a job combined with the pension."
MGTOW,3c8pnd,Morranaii,2,Wed Jul 8 04:49:15 2015 UTC,Up until a few years ago I was a hopeless feminist.  I swallowed every piece of feminist bs my entire life and it was the bedrock of my life.  Everything was built on that.  I kept having poor results in my relationships with women of every type.  And no matter what I tried or changed it never improved.  That led me to RP and after some reading I realized that I was wrong about all of my interpersonal values. No matter what I did or tried my interactions with women would always be bad.  That was the beginning.

MGTOW,3c7rsm,drkstrs,10,Sun Jul 5 18:16:11 2015 UTC,"They don't realize that knowledge and ability is merely a stepping stone.   They're not very good at optimizing for knowledge and ability either. The only insight and skill they desire is whatever is necessary to raise their status among their peers and the opposite sex. My issue with these sorts of people can be summed up in two words: unjustified focus.   Perhaps there can be reason to have sex and engage in romantic relationships, it is unlikely to be universally wrong, but I don't think you would expect an intelligent person to allocate an... excessive focus upon such things, to the point where they feel the need to make up narratives about anyone who isn't getting laid every night: how such men are unsuccessful betas, cowardly neckbeards, whatever negative label comes to mind, and how they of course are every positive label in the book. Almost certainly anyone engaging in such rationalizations would be... a savage, more in touch with reactive, almost primal thinking, than any sort of more reasonable approach to life. It would be a rationalization of their biological instincts, without any real calculation of how much they should listen to such imperatives, whether such a focus actually leads to a better life or not. Your full set of values is much more than just your primal instincts.  You would expect a bit more from sentient existence, would you not? Intelligence is the ultimate form of control over reality: if you had a superpower to manipulate sub-atomic particles, you would need extraordinary knowledge to use that power responsibly, in a way which would not result in massive discharges of energy that would immediately kill you and everyone on the planet, as you move particles into configurations that are not stable. If on the other hand you had such perfect knowledge, you could probably do without the superpower: if you truly knew exactly how reality worked on such a fundamental level, you would not find it particularly hard to generate tools to allow you similar levels of control over reality. The knowledge itself would be a superpower. The ways in which our understanding of reality allows us greater control over reality should be obvious, I think. If it is not, look at the species of apes which do not share our level of sentience, and contrast their life with ours.   When you imagine an ideal mind, what should come to mind is someone with a deep thirst for knowledge, for that is what allows you to shape your life into a better state, your body, mind and environment, all of it. Everything flows from an accurate map of reality. A more accurate understanding of reality almost automatically correlates with greater insight into what you can do. On a fundamental level, action and thinking are not separate concepts. In order to do anything, in order for it to be an action, not a happening, you need a mind. Your body, then, is an extension of your mind. Even your brain is not much more than a representation of your mind, a vessel for a mechanism that could theoretically exist in any other physical format, if the exact same pattern of interactions was preserved.  When you expect such general competence from man, you do not immediately start looking for whether someone is a high-status alpha who gets a lot of pussy, or whether they're a coward, low-status neckbeard. The very idea seems silly --- you would pay attention to the quality of their mind, because that's the part that matters. Your mind is a factor of every instance of your life. Sex, in contrast, surely does not deserve such an intense, overbearing focus as it has. There is far more to the universe than that.   I have argued previously for survival as an objective standard of value, as something that would be timeless in its utility to any sentient existence. I would say that the pursuit of a better mind is another ultimate value. For surely it is better to have more control, than less. To go your own way you must learn to shape your own way, and you must first see the paths you could pursue in order to know which of them you should pursue. This, more often than not, is the hard part: to even envision alternate paths. Seeing all of the options available to you would be a feat of perhaps unattainable, ultimate intelligence --- but the more you see, the better. While sex and women might be a part of your own way, surely the far greater focus would be to reach above and beyond, to extend your mind, to continually make yourself into an ever better version of yourself, to see with greater clarity. In the same way sex and women might be a part of that... they might not either. It doesn't particularly matter. It shouldn't be the focus of your life.  If you're thinking and you're living, and you seem to be getting better at those things... that's what really matters.  For all its silliness, I maintain that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann utterly nails what man's life should be like:  ""Whether laughable or impossible,  such is the path that all great men walk.  If there is a wall in our way we break it down.  If there is no path, we make it with our own hands.  See the invisible; do the impossible.""  There is so much false, unmotivated struggle that is rooted in guilt and exploitation in our society, that many have learned to associate thinking and effort with pain. In reality, however, as imperfect as the brain may be, it comes with something amazing, a physical, emotional reward for the utilization of your mind. Presumably it was an evolutionary advantage, but it can be leveraged for so much more. In its natural state, when you are using your mind to make a better life for yourself, thinking itself is a pleasant experience. Imagine the feedback loop of utilizing your mind to better your mind, the sheer amount of value that is generated when thinking itself is pleasant and a reward in itself, when the result of that thinking is a reward, a better life, when the result of that thinking is also a better mind that can make an even better mind."
MGTOW,3c7rsm,OriginalGravy,3,Mon Jul 6 01:41:50 2015 UTC,"Perhaps there can be reason to have sex and engage in romantic relationships   There is.  It's called children.  But the instant that a guy wraps his dick up in a condom -- well logic states that he is purposefully negating that reason. He's overriding it, and may as well be a eunuch (in fact, he'd probably be better off if he was a eunuch, or the modern variation of it: the post-vasectomy male who shoots ""blanks"").  Which means that ALL that is left... is the La petite mort -- the seeking of the ULTIMATE all-encompassing, body-shuddering sexual orgasm.  And the reality is that most couplings (ad especially not 'quickies') will simply NOT result in anything even remotely like that -- certainly not with the loose (and probably at least half-drunk) ""hotdog down a hallway"" bar sluts that they chase after as ""high SMV"" (why is that hubcap er I mean 'plate' such a high value... well because the OTHER dogs ahem OTHER guys are chasing them too).  And THAT is what they are investing in... investing time, effort, money -- both in ""prepping"" themselves, and then in playing the numbers game, and in trying to keep said plate ""spinning"" -- and shall we mention the aftermath, the risks that come out of it (not the least of which is the aforementioned REASON to seek a ""mate"" and engage in ""mating"").  All so that they can then feel ""successful"" -- because they got the girl(s) -- well, at least got temporary access to parts of them, some of them, kind of. But boy howdy can they brag about it afterwards: Woohoo... they 'tapped' that alright.  Like a dog wagging it's tail, 'cause it GOT the ball. (Aren't you impressed?

MGTOW,3c7rsm,Cheesypeesy,3,Sun Jul 5 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"Because bragging by MGTOW who have passed through it already would be in poor taste and we know that seeking validation whether from women or society is empty.    Well, and also... you left out one other thing from the list at the start:   Their are numerous MGTOW that are rich, successful, in time, money, overall quality of life, or some combination of the three. Many MGTOW are attractive and actually have to actively discourage female interest via hiding their status or other strategies.   We're also SMART enough to not post pictures of things that are directly related to our personal lives -- no pics of the house (or even the views from the house), nor of the workshop, or the office or business, the cars, or the other toys.   Maybe occasionally some minimal and rather vague text descriptions of some of them (if/when appropriate to a specific comment thread -- i.e. advice on where to buy a house to minimize tax-burden, what type of house has less operating/maintenance costs, etc.) -- but at the same time not enough to identify closer than a couple hundred mile radius (and a few million people).  As to WHAT we own... Well, not sure if it really qualifies as ""hiding"" -- I mean CAN you hide in plain sight? I suppose you can -- but none of what I own was necessarily designed to EITHER act as ""camouflage"" any more than it was designed to ""impress"" anyone, and it certainly wasn't bought with ANY ""status"" in mind (just more for functional value and/or personal tastes & fulfillment).  The same with personal appearance & clothing, sure I can pull some stuff out of the closet and ""dress to the nines"" (and when the rare appropriate ""formal"" family or business occasion exists I'll do so) -- but for the most part I wear what makes me comfortable... and, LOL why the fuck not?  I mean ... unless I need something more for weather or ""work"" purposes, well for daily wear especially in the spring/summer/fall that's pretty much limited to one or another of several pairs of cargo shorts (and probably fairly worn or even stained, but fairly lightweight and definitely comfy), and if it gets cool in the evening I'll toss on some lightweight shirt and when necessary a pair of boat shoes.    So the thing is... what is there in any of that to actually ""brag"" about? In terms of what most people think -- ""status"" and fad/fashion ""impression"" -- there's nothing (hell they'd probably even feel ""sorry"" for me, LOL).   Especially the external, the ""perception"" -- it simply isn't all that impressive -- nice looking stuff, good quality, but not ostentatious. Internally the ""reality"" of the home is technically somewhat impressive (more so a decade ago than now I suppose), wifi theater room, home gym & etc; efficient and well organized with several other relatively ""cool"" features... but most people wouldn't find those impressive either.  The only thing I can see as impressive is that it's all debt-free & paid for... and I am financially arranged that I have minimal costs & only have to do minimal work to maintain it, plus I have virtually NO fear of ""losing"" any of it... not to some bank, not to the government, and certainly not to some bitchy woman. (Little fear in fact even to losing any of it to some natural disaster -- basically only a tornado or fire could affect it, and both pretty rare {the former is entirely random, not a shitting thing you can do about it; and the latter minimized further just by having no woman or children in the house} and provided I lived -- well insurance could replace/rebuild it all in fairly short order.)  To my mind that's all sort of (or should be) a ""given"" for a middle-aged MGTOW. There's really ZERO reason for a still-single & childless man my age to NOT be well situated financially, and really in every other regard as well (if I'm any proof, and I think I am, there's even time for a major business failure and recovery in there, a start-over from scratch & negative dollar territory, and without any major lottery/windfall gains -- the key is chiefly avoiding/minimizing the financial drain of women).  But of course... as you noted, from the RP or blue pill/feminist perspective, as an MGTOW well I must just and only be an ""incel"" luuuuzer(!) that no woman would ever want.  LOL, Riiiight.   (And by the way, fine by me if they think that, doesn't affect me in the least.)    EDIT: I do kind of cringe that the above is ""bragging"" -- but I'm going to rationalize/justify it on the basis for younger guys who might be reading that YES, it can be done.  I was a ""hot shot"" boot-strapping entrepreneur at age 22, was broke again at age 32 (with substantial business debt), and yet managed to be essentially retired and debt-free (including owning the home & vehicles free & clear) by age 42, and all while really only making a relatively modest salary. (And it's not like I entirely avoided women in those years either, I not only dated, but had a couple of multi-year LTR's in there -- I just never became ""entangled"" with women, didn't give them access to my wallet, didn't support them, or splurge on them or even generally spend much of any money on them at all... despite what PUA/RP sometimes seem to promote, that's completely unnecessary {unless I suppose you're really trying to get you another ""notch"" of that so called ""high SMV"" sloppy-bar-slut pussy... 'cause that shit'll burn through a paycheck in a single night}.)"

From the article:   After attempting to chase down his assailant, Tale-Yax collapsed in the street from his wounds. CCTV footage then captured over 20 people walk past him without coming to his aid. Some would stare, none it seemed were prepared to help. The woman he had saved also fled the scene and never came forward.  In the wake of the bloodshed, a man came out of a nearby building and coldly took a cellphone picture of Tale-Yax before leaving.  In several instances, pairs of people stopped and stared at him before moving on regardless.  One person even lifted his body, exposing what appeared to be blood on the pavement and then walks away.  Others merely turned their heads toward the body, revealing some curiosity as they hurried along.  A full hour goes by before emergency services arrive and by then it is too late. Hugo Alfredo Tale-Yax was dead in the very same spot he had collapsed.   This shows us three things:   (1) Society doesn't give a fuck about men.  (2) Women don't give a fuck about men.

Generally speaking, think twice before you help anybody with anything. Your mind has been programmed by society to believe that it is honorable to help and to be the hero.  And as far as knife fights, there are only 2 things to do when somebody pulls out a knife: 1) run far away and call the cops, or 2) get a safe enough distance away and shoot them with a GUN. No matter how trained you are in martial arts, the chances of you winning unarmed against a knife is pretty small. Hell, even if it's knife versus knife, you're bound to take a lot of damage. Again, run or use a gun."

It's easier for a woman, if a man calls though we can get dragged into the system. We will get questioned, assumed to have stabbed the guy, forced to take off time from work to deal with police, possibly get fired from work for taking that time, and then we could wind up the homeless bum on the street.  When a society punishes men at every opportunity and treats them as criminals, it can not then insist men have to protect it.   Also in NYC, they literally have cameras running the entire time everywhere. They enforce the 25 mph city speed limit with cameras, red light violations with cameras, and drug dealing or anything else with street cameras.

I think it is fair to say that there are many women that don't identify with feminism, but still think in feminist terms and reap the benefits of feminism. Tacit feminism, I suppose.  My benchmark for the rejection of feminism is responsibility, particularly where that results in negative outcomes for women. Part of equality (which is the claimed aim) is taking your lumps - things like parity in criminal sentencing, the draft for women, no places for those who cannot earn them on merit, etc.   A person that accepts personal responsibility for their actions (whether that is good or bad for them) and rejects the idea that any exceptions should be made on specious grounds (like gender) isn't a feminist. The vast majority of women wouldn't accept that kind of responsibility (and to be entirely fair, plenty of men don't either, they just don't have a society propping up that behaviour for them), so by definition, and regardless of what they say they are, they are feminists in practice."

I have done philosophy as a major among others, and the establishment is a firmly bluepill outshoot of gender studies. The Kierkegaard prof was nothing more than a science-denying Luddite who wants Christians to read Kierkegaard so that everyone can circlejerk over being ""spiritual"" and not ""religious."" Glossing over his points about romance, we learned about the man's criticisms of the plainly-obvious failings of religious establishments.  Furthermore, another prof said that we exist in a rape culture, and the department head once brought up the lack of women in philosophy as a crisis that needs to be solved. Listening to women philosophize is like having molten lava poured into your ears, so I don't see why the phenomena of ladies exercising their free choice to choose majors is a crisis. There are barely any male nurses so is that a crisis?  I don't think Kierkegaard would be happy about our state of affairs these days. Philosophy profs are firmly against his point that marriage and romance are incompatible. Instead, they subscribe to the Oprah school of thought that everyone can be happy all the time forever no matter what.   However, I personally don't appreciate Kierkegaard's emotional cynicism since it reeks of sour grapes in response to the truth, but I do believe his observations are correct. It's just that guys wouldn't feel crushed and depressed if they knew redpill knowledge from the beginning, and then we would have less crybabies waxing eloquent about the cruelty of the mean world. Kierkegaard was obviously sheltered, so any observation that people are not sugar and spice and everything nice is going to disproportionally hurt.   At the end of the day, evo-psych is king. If only Kierkegaard had access to it, he might have had some more peace."

Kierkegaard’s criticism is not directed at marriage simpliciter but at Christendom’s attitude toward marriage. He argues that Christendom’s view of marriage as “a forward step in true religiousness” contradicts what he takes to be the genuine biblical view, namely, that “because the world has now become so old and lechery so out of hand, it is no longer possible to live chastely outside of marriage and therefore marriage must be given a place” (Søren Kierkegaard’s Journals and Papers 3: 2616; cf. 2621, 2624, 2629).

I also don’t get this. Kierkegaard most certainly does not promote an anemic spirituality. “All religion in which there is any truth, certainly Christianity, aims at a person’s total transformation and wants, through renunciation and self-denial, to wrest away from him all that, precisely that, to which he immediately clings, in which he immediately has his life” (The Moment and Late Writings, p. 248)."
MGTOW,3c7dn9,ConclusivePostscript,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:01:32 2015 UTC,"Kierkegaard's criticism of the church establishment generated the impetus for the circle-jerk.   The modern Christian's distinction between ""religiosity"" and ""spirituality"" is a fearful response to rejection by non-religious intellectuals. Read through this lens, Kierkegaard's criticisms of the church are equivalent condemnations of religion. Religion is viewed as the establishment, which is opposed to personalized spirituality tolerant of all religious viewpoints."
MGTOW,3c7dn9,LicketySpl1t,2,Mon Jul 6 09:16:57 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the modern Christian’s religiosity/spirituality distinction is typically a response to worries about religious legalism and fundamentalism, not “a fearful response to rejection by non-religious intellectuals.” This is why you will often hear that Christianity is not a “religion,” but a “relationship.”  Kierkegaard, however, never uses fuzzy terms like “spirituality,” and he uses “religiousness” and its cognates in a positive sense. More to the point, his critique of Christendom is never a critique of the Church or even organized religion. Rather, he is opposed to the notion of a State Church. Kierkegaard does maintain that Christianity has a deeply personal component, but he does not hold that the cultivation of religious individuality entails an opposition to its communal component. He carefully distinguishes between “the crowd” and “the public,” to which he is opposed, and genuine “community,” to which he is not."

That particular video is guilty of several serious errors—biographically and hermeneutically.  Among these errors are The School of Life’s strange conflation of Kierkegaard’s attitude toward romantic love with the attitude his fictional aesthete takes toward romantic love (in Either/Or, Part I). The aesthete was never intended to represent Kierkegaard’s own views; just the opposite, in fact.  Kierkegaard’s actual reasons for breaking the engagement had nothing to do with The School of Life’s projection of the aesthete’s ideas about love onto Kierkegaard. Rather, Kierkegaard appears to have had several distinct motives for doing so: i) he felt that his severe depression hindered his ability to love her; ii) he felt that he would never be able to initiate her into his deepest sufferings, as the honesty of marriage would require; iii) he felt that giving her up was divine punishment (particular to his own situation); iv) he felt that she was religiously underdeveloped; and v) he felt that the single life would be more conducive to his calling as a religious author.

If you had the option to either work or find a ""sugar father"" to pay the bills, isn't the latter the path of least resistance?  Humans, male and female, will opt to take the path of least resistance to accomplish their goals.  I blame the ""sugar fathers"" instead for enabling this kind of behavior."

Even if her degree has no practical value, she thinks it should be a certificate to a higher calibre of man. What women don't realize is that men generally don't care much about a woman's status.   Men almost always marry down, whereas women generally marry up or not at all. Don't believe me? Look at the US Supreme Court. It has 9 judges, 3 women and 6 men at the top of the legal profession. Of the women, only 1 was married recently (her husband died a few years ago), and that was to a man who was a top legal expert. The male judges, on the other hand, are all married to women who are beneath them in terms of educational and career achievement."

Moreover, in the end, the protagonists in both movies conclude that living a quiet family life is preferable to achieving success and wealth at work  It's a slow degradation. It's a process. Day by day, year by year.   Finally most of the guys admit that yeah the fucking kids and non caring wife is exactly what they dreamed of. They literally got their testosterone levels killed by that way of living. So they cut their ball sack and admit 'yeah this is my dream because now, I don't know anything else' how fucking sad."
MGTOW,3c5byv,Morranaii,9,Sun Jul 5 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"At the end, he blames her for letting him become ""this.""  The way I see it, men have been lied to about life and women. Like it's some kind of negotiation. It never, ever, ever should have been that way. So now, the way I see it is it's MY LIFE, I take 100% control of it. It's my island, my bubble, my world. Even Red Pillers seem to have an air of ""negotiation"" lingering in their forums. Negotiate with what about what, is my question.  When you frame it as your own world, the entire approach anxiety thing about women just floats away. Anxiety about what? A popular PUA guru once said that approach anxiety is there because it's a survival mechanism. That tells me that approach anxiety is for little boys who believe that women are a threat to them and will take everything away from them. Well? Maybe don't ever have that in mind then. No marriage, no buying expensive crap, no providership, etc, etc.  How about you just set up your life the way you want it and if women don't like it they can go the hell away? The problem is men cave in to women's demands. You wouldn't do that for a 5 y/o kid so why would you ever do that for a woman? It's the same thing. For example, would you ever let a woman tell you not to have a poster of a nude woman in your living room? It's YOUR LIVING ROOM. If she doesn't like it, she can leave. You're not even married - why would any man in this day and age have it in his mind that he would have to negotiate with a woman on anything?  Hell, I approached a set of 3 chicks last night. Two were cool and one was cunty. They were headed to the other side of town and I figured ""Well that's easy. Between them living on the other side of town and this one cunt being a cunt, I just saved a lot of time."" Why is it other men would be upset that a woman didn't like him and even make an effort to try and change her mood? Fuck that. Mangina syndrome is what that would be called.  To an extent I think both MGTOW and RP believe there must be some kind of negotiation that must be done. No way. Salesmanship, sure. But not negotiation. You can lie during the sale all you want if you want to - but why would you ever translate that to literal compromises? It is far better to just say, ""I lied"" than it is to say, ""I guess I'll compromise."""
MGTOW,3c5byv,ShitfacedBatman,2,Sun Jul 5 03:03:58 2015 UTC,"At the end, he blames her for letting him become ""this.""   that's the main problem. it's not her fault. it's his. in a way that he allowed all this to happen. nobody forced him to do so, right? that's the difference between mangina who might be a great dude nevertheless he never got balls to really think it through and get to the conclusion that women aren't some divine beings that cannot lie for example.  trim their hair, let them not shave for 2 months, stop with make ups and creams and there. you'll see how ugly they really are.   You wouldn't do that for a 5 y/o kid so why would you ever do that for a woman? It's the same thing. For example, would you ever let a woman tell you not to have a poster of a nude woman in your living room? It's YOUR LIVING ROOM. If she doesn't like it, she can leave. You're not even married - why would any man in this day and age have it in his mind that he would have to negotiate with a woman on anything?  yeah. it might be a mix of fear of approaching women because deep down we were somehow afraid of confronting our own mothers? and every woman will test you and try to force her will upon you - because maybe deep down they all feel a bit like mothers to their little boys? idk  And I agree with you - men are trying their whole life to understand women - yet are they doing the same with us? Hell no. They don't care. We do all the work for them. ;-F"
MGTOW,3c5byv,Morranaii,2,Sun Jul 5 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"it might be a mix of fear of approaching women because deep down we were somehow afraid of confronting our own mothers?   I've thought for a while that there's something to Freud and the Oedipus complex for all men. And I wondered if the Electra complex was a thing for women - even an inverted Electra complex which would be a ""male puer fixation."" And now I kind of don't think it's quite that way.  Pretend for example that Maslow's hierarchy of needs is the real deal. I once heard from a psych 101 prof that most people stay on level 3, the love/belonging level, most of their lives. Let's pretend that's true. You will notice that today's PUAs are, or should be, all on level 4 - the self-esteem block. I would say PUA 1.0 was on Maslow's level #3, and in fact that's where most PUA got a bad rap. For an example of PUA 2.0 which I'd say is on Maslow's level #4, self esteem, check out the 24+ hour video Blueprint Decoded if you've got time. I've concluded that what the ""good father"" and the ""bad boy"" have in common is self-esteem, or at least the appearance thereof. Hell, even the ""dark triad"" Red Pill loves to reference has self esteem, and maybe it's safer to to paint a badass-with-self-esteem as ""scary"" or ""born evil"" with the traits of narcissism, machiavellianism, and psychopathy.  For ""what"" is self-esteem, the shorthand in my book is that 1) you-are-not-your-thoughts and 2) you-are-not-your-feelings. By default, most men confuse their thoughts with who they are. The ""ego,"" if you will. Sometimes I see it as 2 entities living inside the same person and the ego tends to keep getting in the way of the self-esteem. Some how and some way, a man needs to access his self-esteem. Therapy and spiritual exercise or something.  PUA will only work for you if you have self-esteem. And these days ""marriage"" if you dare it, will only work for you if you have self-esteem. However we all know that Nelson Mandela, whom all evidence suggests had a strong-ass self esteem (how else do you survive 27 years in prison and not let it break you down) -- found himself twice divorced. Lol? Lol. He probably never read up on game, I'm guessing.  If my psych prof is right and most people stay on Maslow's level 3, love/belonging, then most relationships and relationship-theory is going to continue to be a political battle between 3rd wave feminism and red pill. Full of stalemates, one-upmanship, and questionable statistics. Feminism is about getting as many freebies as possible, and MGTOW is about survival, retaining resources, and dodging bullets. The result is population control at best, population pollution at worst. Prior to 3rd wave feminism, the earlier systems worked reasonably well for people on Maslow's level 3, love/belonging. I would argue that the current system, ""The Matrix,"" is 3rd wave feminism. It works for nobody and it is population control if you're smart and population pollution if you're dumb. Children with diabetes or prediabetes is a great example of population pollution.  In short, enjoy the decline and get yours."
MGTOW,3c5byv,ShitfacedBatman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"that's indeed a fascinating topic. as for my current opinion, I think there's certainly something from these things mixed into inter-gender relations. and if- for example- someone had unhealthy family (substance abuse, alcoholism, toxic, one-parent, etc etc etc) then it is even easier to get into such traps and then repeat bad patterns in adult life even without realizing this.  re self-esteem and confidence- it works on a 'fake it till you make it' basis. so somehow, most people that we perceive as 'confident' deep down aren't yet truly confident- they are just practicing it to become like that.  Re Mandela- for me it's not the game that he didn't read. Maybe after 27 years in prison you only dream of women, who knows. Maybe that saves you somehow. As for me, I guess the marriage is to blame. Its just a bad deal for men.  Coming back to father/mother thing. I must admit there's something to it- for example my mother was really controlling, and the only way for me to run away from that was to confront her directly when I was a teenager. I left my home very early and become independent rather early. But it was the only way for me, she wasn't helping. Now, what I noticed is for several years I had problems with women that I meet in business that were over me in terms of power. So, they were my managers, supervisors and so on. And plenty of conflicts arise every time I didn't agreed with something or I felt that they are overusing their competences/power.   I never had any issues with male-bosses though. Coincidence? I don't think so.  Also, many women admit that they somehow miss their fathers and looking for similar traits in men (a mixture of sense of security, easy-going, confidence, etc) - even if subconsciously. Now, if they got toxic fathers, then they will look for the same toxic traits in relationships because they cannot realize on conscious level that for example this is bad for them. They think like 'okaay my parent hurt me, but they loved me- so this is normal...so this Mr X also is hurting me, but he says he loves me so this is ok...'  It's a flawed logic, but they don't realize that."
MGTOW,3c5byv,Morranaii,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:05:52 2015 UTC,"self-esteem and confidence- it works on a 'fake it till you make it' basis   I believe that is a hack. You can access it in other ways, but if no other solutions present itself, that's like a backdoor.  I also tend to believe there are 3 different types of ""people problems"" out there.   People with problems in their face all the time. (Poor people.) People who appear to not have any problems. (Rich people.) People who think they're normal. (Middle class.)   In reality, everybody has problems. The only real advantage a poor person has is that they can see their problems. They either confront them and survive really well (Oprah Winfrey) - or they allow themselves to become victims and get run the fuck over (heroin addicts).  I notice middle class people commonly believe they're ""normal"" because they're not like those poor ""poor people"" and they're not like those poor ""rich people."" And yet we know that's a shitty stereotype for rich people because some rich people are awesome, badass motherfuckers who've got their shit together. And therefore the middle class is usually the most troubled because they don't know what their problems are or will even live a lifestyle that continues to deny they have problems. They never sink to the level of poor people because they're ""so scary,"" and they never rise to the level of rich people because they're also ""so scary.""  True badasses are people that can identify their problems, show a willingness to confront and attack their problems, and show the resilience to never give up. Doing this is what I would call waking up, and that will access your self-esteem and confidence. I would call this the front door to your self-esteem."

Acknowledge you are under the influence of some powerful hormones.     Get the nutrition, rest and relaxation that you need to stay physically, emotionally, and mentally sound.     When concerns and fears come into your mind about your lover, ask yourself if you are just trying to discharge the anxiety that you feel about the unknown, so that you can stop a personal drama in its track.     Don't rush to seal the relationship, just because you can't stand the anxiety of having to go through the stages of falling in love. Accept your anxiety and learn to work with it.     Research shows that falling in love also makes you more creative (Scientific American, Does Falling In Love Make Us More Creative? (link is external)). So, work out that anxiety and fear through some creative activities.     Don't lower your defenses, personal boundaries, and expectations to the extent that you are denying what you really desire and need. This never works out well.

MGTOW,3c1qmh,oldredder,0,Sat Jul 4 22:23:28 2015 UTC,"positive? about what?   Yeah I am positive, optimistic and all lol.  Not 'positive' meaning HIV positive lolol  If I told you that last weekend one chick was over me and I refused because she was like ""I am divorced"" ""why you divorced the guy?"" ""I was bored!"" ""oh thats nice"" (after several hours as we were in the pub) ""do you know any clubs for swinging?"" (that was her question, of course).  Can you believe that this happened? It really did. I remember when I read such stories over here I often doubt it's true and think the person wrote it just to get likes.   But this time something like that happened to me. And now I am writing this story. And ofc can't prove it lol.  Internet is funny."
MGTOW,3c1qmh,oldredder,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"So anyway my point is that I got my own score in success with women (meaning sex etc) I am rather good looking, healthy and so on. In my prime time too. No problemo to find a girl.   But to find a girl that has something decent to bring into my life, who is living a healthy life without some kind of fucked up issues (either being healthy, not using drugs, not having crazy relationship with religion or family, being confident feminine and not assholic etc., that I would not feel that she's just trying to use me as her fucking entertainer this way or the other) that's beyond me, and not even depending on myself. They are all crazy - only the scale differs. And at this point in my life I don't want any craziness in my life.   Why I should go for less in my life? I am worth the best as I am myself a nice catch. So far, I haven't found anybody even close to my own ideal. And the more I look around, the less potential candidates I see."

Basically they expect you to hit on them, they're prepared to deflect your advance, and when you don't hit on them they're confused and pissed. So they'll feel compelled to talk to a dude out of invisible revenge-on-you, so they pick the looniest looking guy they can find. Shitty hair, a collared shirt buttoned all the way to the top, and an idiot grin.  In other words, women are so sensitive that if you don't approach they feel rejected. Weird, but whatever. I've had women come up to me and say, ""How come you didn't come over and talk to me?"" Wow, didn't know I was supposed to, honey. Women flatter the shit out of themselves."
MGTOW,3c1qmh,papipapichulo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:08:48 2015 UTC,"haha exactly. it's their self-defending mechanism. of course, their huuuuge ego always tell them 'oh fuck him, what a dick, I am faaar better than him, I am sooo much over him already'.  Now the tide is turning and finally at least some part of men is beginning to think the same way 'hey, I am a prize here. I don't accept any bullshit, any poor females around me'.   When you look at 70s or even early 80s women were more unsure, they started to notice that men want them but were more open and treated us with more respect. At least. Now they know tons of men will hit on them anyway so they don't need to do anything and it's basically like watching a catalog full of new shiny toys!   If you were watching same toys in - let's say- groups of five, you'd notice that most of them are cool, interesting toys.   But when you swirl through the 500 page catalog then at one hour you'll see HUNDREDS of toys and your 'tolerance' goes down- nothing excites you anymore, you are overloaded with choice and thus becoming way too picky.   Notice how somehow I automatically used the word 'toys' as a metaphor. We aren't much more for nowadays girls, sir."
MGTOW,3c1qmh,oldredder,8,Sun Jul 5 10:03:26 2015 UTC,Privileged biaches. Personal experiences: reject or ignore an attention whore and expect her to to poison your personal relationsships with friends or acquaintances.
MGTOW,3c1qmh,papipapichulo,2,Sun Jul 5 15:05:20 2015 UTC,expect her to to poison your personal relationships with friends or acquaintances.   I work to have many circles of friends that do not intersect JUST FOR this possibility. Far better to lose a small circle then ALL of my friends.

MGTOW,3c1qmh,Asari_Lover,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:21:41 2015 UTC,That's why they would rather leave it for the men to ask. Because they have no problem doing the rejecting themselves.
MGTOW,3c1qmh,oldredder,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:19:16 2015 UTC,meh. Doesn't even matter: unless her way of handling rejection is to try to fuck with your life instead of just leave you alone. Then it matters but there's ways of handling that. Is this a line of strategy anyone wants to pursue in detail?
MGTOW,3c1qmh,oldredder,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"I kind of disagree with that. I mean, it depends on the woman in question, doesnt it? I know there are plenty of women who want to have sex but are not able to get it, maybe because they are shy or awkward or straight-down unattractive.   Its the same with man in this case, isnt it? If you look good you can have every girl you want honestly. If you dont, well shit.   Dont know the reason why she rejected the party-invitation, but maybe she didnt love him and since he wasnt interested in sex there was no further reason to talk to him? Or she was madly in love and is kinda heartbroken/ashamed. Hard to tell as there are way more possible and less convenient possibilities.   To walk ones own way its very important to stay open-minded and intelligent about stuff like this. I do agree women are probably getting rejected less than men, but thats mainly because of the bullshit-assumption men should be the ones initiating these talks.  Regardless if men or women, there is always a high probability of fail if you ask someone out and everyone experiences it."
MGTOW,3c1qmh,oldredder,5,Sun Jul 5 00:02:48 2015 UTC,"women who want to have sex but are not able to get it, maybe because they are shy or awkward or straight-down unattractive. Its the same with man in this case, isnt it? If you look good you can have every girl you want honestly. If you dont, well shit.   well not really - in my opinion if the girl is shy she already got males who will target her anyway. easy prey sometimes.  if she is awkward or very ugly then well, yeah. that's obvious.  with men it is more different as we need to chase the sex. women just need to take it from us its a different dynamic.  she rejected the party invitation because she ignored her, she wanted to sleep with him and he did not - as he wasn't that much attracted to her. she wasn't ugly either- at least that's what he told me. If a girl is in love, she won't stop like that. Besides, she very well know what she was doing. she wanted him to fall in love with her, so she can use him whilst abstaining from this by herself. that's my view on that."
MGTOW,3c1qmh,papipapichulo,5,Sat Jul 4 12:18:04 2015 UTC,I refuse to chase the sex. There's only one girl I sort of chased a little for it but she had her reasons. She liked the sex we had - we'd done it already but I wanted more. Turns out she was already starting to have really strong feelings for me and didn't want the emotional turmoil of it unless I was into her.  I wasn't. She already had a boyfriend and he was a friend of mine. Now mind you we all were aware of this situation so there was no jealousy between us guys but I didn't want to change it from just sex to a real emotional relationship.
MGTOW,3c1qmh,Indigo_Monkey,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:34:52 2015 UTC,with some of them you don't need to chase it too much but they are in the 'most crazy' bracket though ;)
MGTOW,3c1qmh,papipapichulo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:08:22 2015 UTC,"No, they aren't. They are the hotter ones who know what they want. Some crazy girls also will chase but the way they chase for sex is not the same.  Hottest women are accustomed to men not approaching them at all because they are scared of hot women. Those women know they need to put some effort into encourage men to get things started in most cases."
MGTOW,3c1qmh,Indigo_Monkey,2,Sun Jul 5 00:33:22 2015 UTC,"Hottest women are accustomed to men not approaching them at all because they are scared of hot women. Those women know they need to put some effort into encourage men to get things started in most cases.   This. this. this. For the first three dates my woman and I were seeing each other I honestly thought I was getting punked or set up somehow since she was easily a 9 or higher depending on her make-up or hairstyle that day. I asked her repeatedly since I was shy at the time why she was single and was convinced she had half a dozen guys on call; she told me that most guys admit to feeling intimidated by her and her girlfriends and don't approach thinking they'll be shot down. She claims to have drawn interest because I was the only guy with the conviction to approach her and didn't mention sex the entire time we were mingling.  This gives credence to other incredibly gorgeous women I had the luxury of speaking to during college: hot women have trouble getting into relationships - not sex, relationships - because guys of all attraction ranges shoot themselves down without trying. The first one who shows confidence it seems will have the best chance of success since the competition isn't there."
MGTOW,3c1qmh,oldredder,0,Sun Jul 5 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"but what the 'hotter ones' want? the same as the average ones- more power for them! simple.   Hot, average, ugly- woman is a woman. you gave her little bit of control and she'll use it to deceive you. simple.  I guess it's from the childhood when they were sugar-coated with their daddies, and pre-learned tricks to get away from any situation - just with a smile, blinking eyes and sweet look on their faces. They are masters in these kind of games."
MGTOW,3c1qmh,TotesMessenger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"NO. The hotter ones have better genes and they want better genes.  The face, bone structure, give most of this away to who has good genetics.  For me the body is great, the face is great, and the one obvious thing standing out is glasses. It's a sign of lesser genes to need them. I see an immediate change from when I take them off to hit on women or let them hit on me vs if I wear them. If I wear them I'm automatically treated like some beta not because I act beta but because a man who's got weak eyes isn't a man in her subconscious.  I can't blame them. I prefer girls not wearing glasses either and even switching to contacts, despite me knowing it's the same girl, changes every internal reaction I have to those women."

My job...I'm a teacher and I love my job.  I meet some cool people from all around the world.  Most of the students are 18-25 and are here in the U.S for a short time, take classes, and have a good time while at it.  The majority of these students are foreign girls...enuff said.  But honestly, I think I'd love my job even if that wasn't the case.  Boxing...I've boxed for years and used to fight competitively in a former life.  But I still love going to the gym.  The gym I've been going to the last 4 years has other martial arts that I've been able to pick up stuff from...like bjj and muy thai.  I start taking knife fighting classes next month...cool sh%t.  Sports- Playing (when I can) and watching all kinds of sports. But I couldn't imagine my life without sports.  Really all sports...except golf.   (Sorry golfers, I can appreciate the skill involved, but it just ain't a sport in my honest opinion).  Football (both kinds), basketball, and softball nowadays.  I've actually enjoyed watching the women's World Cup.  A big part of that is that the female players don't bitch and moan as is so common in the men's side.   Travelling- I've been to five continents...I've lived in 3 of them. I love History in general.  So seeing some of the things we were all taught in history class is always cool...like the Pyramids, Machu Pichu, the Coliseum, and a bunch of other good stuff.  Of course as an added bonus, through my job I always meet aforementioned students.....  Spending time with the folks...my folks and a lot of that has to do with a certain generation dying off.  Sometimes, it can be annoying as f&ck...but do enjoy it mostly and I'm also looking at it from the long-term perspective...I never wanna be on my deathbed wishing I hadn't spent more time with them.

I don't actually just sit and look at still-images of porn. What a waste of time for something that doesn't do anything.

MGTOW,3bynf3,oldredder,0,Sat Jul 4 05:21:09 2015 UTC,"It's pretty rare that I want to download an actual porn-video. YouTube has everything I need for video - beach volleyball games, for example. Firefox plugin and I'm good. Actual hardcore is so completely disposable - once you cross various thresholds of ridiculous, I dunno, it's like the girls lower the shit out of their SMV so I see it as literal garbage unworthy of my computer's harddrive. Plus they let that garbage float out there - if you need it again you can just see it on the site again. If it goes away, they'll replace it with another enticing-yet-disposable piece of garbage. I just stay away from it though, I try and have smut standards.  Then there's gifs - like /r/anal for example. 2 or 3 new gifs you've never seen before and you can bust your nut in 5 minutes if you want. Those poor video producers don't even get the benefit of me seeing an advertisement. If I had to choose between Pornhub's anal section versus Reddit's /r/anal, it'd be Reddit. Use the iPhone app for it and you're done pretty damn quick. If I want a plot and storyline for the ""foreplay"" part of wanging-chung, women's beach volleyball on YouTube does the job. Also ""prova do tubo.""  Plus since I do try my hand at game now and again, I don't want to develop an eye for super-sluts. I don't want to inadvertently date an actual chick who's got hardcore videos on Pornhub. Jesus Christ."
MGTOW,3bynf3,ShitfacedBatman,2,Sat Jul 4 06:22:05 2015 UTC,"to each their own. Youtube has nothing like porn on it so I have no use of it for that. Youtube is where comedy & prepper videos are.  There are no thresholds to cross - I don't understand this concept.  Hardcore, like women dripping wet from fingering themselves so much, is just a thing. There's no threshold over or under as far as I'm concerned and that's pretty much the only kind of video I download, unless it's lots of girls together with no men.   if you need it again you can just see it on the site again   I have the opposite experience. Most of what I saved can't be found again after only a few months.   2 or 3 new gifs you've never seen before and you can bust your nut in 5 minutes if you want.   I can't. I've never been able to just bust it out fast. When I fuck I need 1 to 3 hours. If I'm going to jerk it I'll probably need 20 to 30 minutes with decent porn. Some things I remember are good enough but few. Most times I want to forget I ever touched most women I've been with so the last thing I want to do is remember them for an orgasm.  anal is disgusting. I can't understand how anyone likes it. That hole is for exit-only, for shit only. I'd never put my dick in there.  I would absolutely ONLY date a woman who does hard-core cam porn alone. It's my niche target market. I don't ""date"", but I would do it for sex with that.  Anything less is garbage to me, of no value at all."

MGTOW,3bynf3,Asari_Lover,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"There are no thresholds to cross - I don't understand this concept.   Double anal and bukkake aren't over the line for you? Would you date a woman who's done that?   anal is disgusting.   &   I would absolutely ONLY date a woman who does hard-core cam porn alone.   So that's your line. That's what I'm talking about.  I forgot about this, but it occurs to me I do have a collection of girl-girl erotica from Sapphic Erotica dot com, but to me that's more erotica than it is porn. What's funny is I tried being an affiliate marketer for that company and they had a series of announcements saying they just weren't making money anymore, they were lowering their payouts, and their conversion ratio was super impossible. I kind of blame torrent sites for their predicament. If you want 60 GB's of girl-girl action, there's a torrent for it. There is no money in ""softness and giggling.""  Generally speaking, I don't think porn and erotica have any more or less money in it than any other business has. There's been a number of articles written on it. Girls in the industry got into it because they thought they could get rich, but the industry's bubble burst to where they may as well have become almost anything else - an Administrative Assistant, for example. There's a host of men who got in the industry because they have zero game and they just want to get laid. Peter Sagal has quotes from a male star in his book, Very Naughty Things And How To Do Them - the poor bastard he was talking to was like, ""Y'know, I've never really had luck with women.""  Now and again I think there's a starlet that hits the industry pretty hard and makes good money, for example Christy Mack, but she is DEFINITELY not my type (bad hair and gross tattoos) and I don't really see the draw unless there's a bunch of curious rich dufuses around the globe willing to empty their wallets because she's ""unique looking"" or something. I honestly don't know where/how a woman like that gets ""fans"" that shell out money."

She's a cum slut pervert and I love it. Lots of men love it. I paid nothing and she got paid a ton. She's doing this for a web-cam site that's paid."
MGTOW,3bynf3,oldredder,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:51:17 2015 UTC,"Paid how much, I wonder? Enough to cover the bills for 1 month? And even if it was enough to burn through a whole year, who's to say she budgeted it well?  I see it as like the music business. To get rich, you have to be signed by a major label and marketed through the channels that have already been carved out by the industry. Same with the adult business. Playboy's Playmate of the Year gets $100,000. Sure, that's nothing to sneeze at but the money goes quick. A model has to sustain that income and be smart with the money. I already forgot the 2015 PMOY's name. Yet strangely, I remember stars' names that everybody knows. ""Jenna Jameson,"" and ""Sasha Grey"" for example. I know those names like I know ""Britney Spears"" and ""Justin Timberlake."" What the 4 have in common is they are household names. You get to be a household name when you're marketed by a company who pushes you through all the existing channels.  Even IF these women get significantly rich, they all hit the wall some day. Vanishingly few ever want to see a cougar perform the ""drinking her own pussy juice"" stunt.  Women that get in the adult biz nowadays have to do it because they want to and they LIKE it, not because they're going to get rich - because getting rich is a crap shoot. (No pun intended?)  Another thing about industry stars is the money is easy come, easy go. A hooker might make $800 one night and then spend it on an $850 pair of shoes the next. Not everybody in the industry is smart with their money.  Interestingly, and I just thought of this... I believe many women really DO do porn because they like it. This post from TRP is pretty damn illuminating. It basically says that now that people have the freedom to do exactly what they want: engineering, nursing, or porn - they gravitate toward doing exactly what they want. And surprise, surprise, it falls along gender stereotypes wouldn't you know. Never believe any woman that says she's ""forced"" into the adult industry because ""patriarchy."" Maybe that could've been the case in the 70's but certainly not in 2015."

ANAL: is sick for all men and women. It's where shit and e.coli bacteria are. ANYONE doing anal sex is dirty to me.  Bukkake is no big deal. A shower will fix that up just fine.   more erotica than it is porn.   no difference.   Girls in the industry got into it because they thought they could get rich   Many still are: open a cam girl website or channel on a web site and finger herself all day for money. Men sign up with credit cards and pay up. They cap the video and torrent it out and then the rest of us get it, same as from xhamster, etc. Free for most of us, paid up for value by those who wanted to do so and have enough cash to burn."

Otherwise there wouldn't be people who've had their entire life handed to them continuing to succeed. We are gears in a gearbox; everything that happens now is only a direct result of something that happened before. There's no 'learning how to grow'. You are either strong or weak. You don't learn it; you overcome or you get destroyed.  And that is why I believe that the universe is an immoral thing and should have never been allowed to exist.

The universe doesn't need to be allowed to exist, it just does.   What you feel and what I feel are different things. You say bullshit is omnipresent, so how can you believe anything you say? Going by that, even your own words are bullshit. It's a vicious circle, but it's not reality. The world will not change for you, but there is possibility for change within you.  I'm going now, got things to do."

And amoral is the abscense of morality. Immoral is going against it.  Regardless of if you think I'm projecting; this is what life has shown me. I cannot see it any differently; no matter what I try. My mind is not allowed to come to that conclusion; as soon as I do, I get an intrusive thought that sends it running. I know the universe will not change; that's why I hate it so much. The depths of my seething are part and parcel of why I know my life to be worthless."

It has its radicals, it provides contradictory messages because feminist interpret things in different ways, it has some good (when they actually follow equality) and some bad. The most negative aspect though, as with other ideologies, is when dogma triumphs over the facts ie wage gap and how prevalent ""rape culture"" is.  The reason why this ideology could be more damaging than others though is because it is trying to shake the core of male-female relations. The social impact of that can be far reaching so feminism does deserve more of our attention and more scrutiny than say a random political ideology that can have radicals but can be largely irrelevant if there aren't enough followers of it."

Things like that are necessary, or at least nice to have in a civilized society.  I totally understand people who just say ""hell no, you made your bed with feminism and now your going to lie in it,"" but who's to say the pregnant struggling mom is some feminazi sympathizer.  Even if she were, I think that'd actually be more reason to act chivalrous.   It all depends on the situation to me.  The woman in that pic?

MGTOW,3bvmdf,thrownaway_MGTOW,5,Thu Jul 2 14:52:33 2015 UTC,"Let me be brief. I have been arrested on two, almost three occasions for D.V. This is one of the easiest pitfalls to step into as a man in a relationship.    It is also in my opinion one of the easiest ""traps"" to entirely avoid, or to at least reduce the opportunity for (and thus the probability) to a relatively insignificant thing... i.e. so that it becomes a sort of ""hit by lightning"" low-level of risk.  How?  Well, to begin with don't ""cohabit"" -- not even for a day -- in fact, as a general rule don't allow women to enter your ""domestic"" area -- and further don't dwell in theirs for any extended period of time either.  Personally -- with a very-few pre-vetted exceptions* -- women essentially NEVER enter my home (preferably they're not even on my land), and generally speaking (pretty much the same exceptions*) I rather diligently stay ENTIRELY the fuck away from theirs.    * The exceptions? My own mother (in the company of my father, and -- as far as a woman can be -- a proven non-crazy & relatively non-emotional ""unicorn"" from the depression era/silent generation); a older retired/widowed woman who serves on the board of an organization with me (and who on rare occasions will stop by for a chat about org stuff over coffee), and the wives of a select few neighbors and very old friends (all ""salt of the earth"" types) both ONLY hen accompanied by their ""hubby"" and I invite them over for a few beers & summer BBQ (but even then, we basically sit out on the deck/porch).   Other than that -- well even several other relatives are simply NOT welcome in my home (my potentially half-psycho & proven litigious sister-in-law for example, on & off various meds over the years, and one never knows when or what she will do/say -- she is never even allowed near the property -- and I minimize my contact/interaction with her elsewhere as well) -- and as for the ""casual contact"" people, men might get invited inside, but women/females are ALWAYS kept outside the house proper (which is covered by security-recording cams -- a system that was setup for other reasons -- but which serves ""double duty"" for this as well).  WHY so ""serious"" about that?  Because -- and to me this says I am NOT paranoid, because the threat is very real -- I have known MULTIPLE men** who in the past decade have gone through what OP is discussing -- women are now using VAWA and a DV phone call to the cops as a means of controlling/coercing and essentially ""emasculating"" men... I am not so naive.  And IMO women simply aren't worth the risk of anything further.    ** EDIT: Some of these guys are definitely ""assholes"" or at least I know (from past observation) that they are fully capable of being ""assholes"" AND of becoming violent -- especially if/when they are provoked & mistreated themselves -- and I have no doubt that in at least a couple of the cases the ""violence"" was real, but at the same time having known/observed the women... they also undoubtedly CREATED and provoked (and indeed probably even contrived & planned -- and worked that plan -- over weeks and even months to ""cook up"") the scenario, almost like a ""pre-scripted"" little dramatic-play (which of course is what it is, a ""drama-trauma"" that they played out in public) -- just as these men were/are not exactly perfectly disciplined, their women most definitely weren't/aren't innocent little pollyanna ""victim"" females either."

I think there is merit in that relative to ""quality/character"" people of either gender.*  IOW if you're looking for a reliable/dependable (honest, hardworking) male friend OR females, well you're more likely to find someone of a character that matches your own in that regard if/when you engage in activities that sort of ""require"" that as a prerequisite character trait.  People will inevitably either ""self-select"" in volunteering, or else -- even if they have somehow been pushed/coerced/forced into it -- they will reveal their character in how they actually ""engage"" in the work... if they do everything they can to avoid or slack off or shift the work onto others (while doing nothing themselves), well that demonstrates something entirely different than the kind of person who rolls up their sleeves and dives right in to either take the lead or assist/support someone else.  *And the plain truth is that -- having done that kind of thing -- well, there is in my experience a definite ""gender disparity"".  Women tend to only want to ""volunteer"" when it somehow involves themselves and/or their children as DIRECT beneficiaries, and then also generally speaking only when it involves LITTLE or no physical effort;  Men are often quite the opposite in many of those regards."

MGTOW,3bvggw,Morranaii,2,Mon Jul 6 12:32:12 2015 UTC,"I then asked her how in the fuck she could sleep with approaching a thousand men and young boys and not get tested more often than twice a damn year. Her reply was, ""I can't manage to get tested every week.""   It's sort of a trivial point... but really, she isn't entirely wrong about the fact that there would be little value to her getting tested every week; and it's debatable whether even monthly testing (as is required in areas like Nevada with legalized brothels) is all that superior to quarterly (4x) or semi-annual (2x) per year testing.  Why? Well because a lot of STD's have a significant ""incubation"" period, and just aren't going to show up on the tests until weeks, even months after she has been infected (and whether in the meantime she has already begun infecting others, well that varies from one STD to another, as well as what particular ""activities"" are being engaged in, and with some of the STD's what {if any} hygiene has occurred between partners).    EDIT:  As to the larger picture you are painting... well, I think in part it may be both a ""sampling bias"" based simply on who you are likely to be coming into contact with, as well as a sort of ""self-selection"" bias on the part of the women who ARE doing the talking.  By that I mean you're hardly likely to be coming into contact with, much less engage in this kind of a conversation with a large number of relatively shy, even ""prudish librarian"" types of woman.  That said... I don't think you're entirely incorrect that -- especially in our current era -- the vast majority of women either are already engaged in these kinds of things on a relatively frequent basis, or else at least wish they were. (To wit: the book 50 shades of Grey, which IIRC has sold a couple hundred million copies, and doubtless been read by many times that number -- and in reality is hardly the ""unique"" tome that the media makes it out to be {i.e. there have been similar books around basically ever since publishing began, even back when I was a teen -- and growing up in the middle of nowhere mind you -- the local HS girls were passing around books like both ""Fear of Flying"" and ""Blue Skies, No Candy""} -- and of course that is to say nothing of the vast array of ""fan-fiction-porn"" that has been available online for well over a decade now, and a lot of which basically existed in other forms previously {either handwritten/typed & copied things in ""private"" circulation, or even just the unwritten dream/fantasies in the minds of girls/women}.)  But is it ALL women? (i.e. AWALT)   No, I really don't think it is -- just as with every other aspect/trait of humanity -- I think it exists on a spectrum. It's more of an ASSPOWALT, and then depending on the circles of women you are around (and as they get older & more corrupt) it really does begin approaching AWALT.  But I would also qualify that by saying that environment -- i.e. the nurture/culture, which includes personal/familial & local experience of ""norms"" as well as the larger ""societal"" view of them (both the ostensible ""official"" public view, as well as the often ""private"" reality) -- can and does have a SIGNIFICANT effect on where people end up ""clustering"" or falling on that spectrum (especially in terms of the younger women).  In other words, the spread on that spectrum CAN be ""tilted"" or ""distorted"" - in one direction or another - by a variety of factors."

MGTOW,3bvggw,TheQuestion78,2,Thu Jul 2 15:19:40 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. I've only been tested once in my life after my mother and sister scared me that I could get herpes from kissing a girl I barely knew.   Well, you could just as easily get any of a dozen different varieties of herpes from your mother or sister as well* -- depending on who THEY have been in contact with, versus their contact with you (and not to be paranoid -- but the occasional motherly or sisterly ""peck on the cheek"" kiss isn't somehow ""sacred"": viruses after all don't have the ability to know about, nor would they care about, what the motive or intent or purpose of the contact was).  And then depending on when you got tested ver-- the range of incubation for various types of herpes goes anywhere from a couple of days to about a month.  * In a sense, the rather common dislike of such things on the part of many little boys -- i.e. the ""Yuck, girls have cooties!"" bit -- is ironically enough, not entirely without merit from an epidemiological standpoint. LOL.     If it truly is a waste to get tested more often than monthly than I'll think about giving her an apology. However, I still stand firm that if she refuses to use protection with strangers than twice a year is not enough though I'm no expert on medical procedures.   Well, it's debatable.    The point is that the date on which you get tested, well you're really testing relative to the partners & activity that occurred several weeks if not several months prior -- so that if you had NO contact with people previously, and yet were just infected the night before (or in some cases) the week or even month before, well the test will probably give you a FALSE ""all clear"" ... because the infection just hasn't (yet) risen to the level of being able to be detected by the test. IOW there is a ""delay"" period in there where you can be infected and yet not only not show any symptoms, but where the tests won't pick it up either.  Exactly how long that delay is, varies rather significantly from one STD to another (and indeed the same with ALL infections, but STD's seem to have ""evolved"" to have generally much slower incubation periods... they've been called ""long fuse"" or ""time bomb"" diseases -- and of course that makes complete sense given that the transmission method is one that would need to get past what would probably be {historically speaking} infrequent ""opportunities"" to find a new host -- this is one of the BIG problems with pervasive promiscuity: STD's have the potential to {rather rapidly} evolve BACK to much ""shorter fuses"" and indeed to become significantly MORE virulent & damaging, if they we facilitate their spread more quickly & widely).  Some STD's are detectable (and even symptomatic/problematic) within days or weeks, others are months, or even years(!)  HIV for example -- the scariest of them all -- actually has an incubation period that (as far as they have been able to define it) can range anywhere from ~6 months to ~24 months. So when you get tested for HIV and it comes back ""clear"", well what you're really testing is not whether you have recently become infected (i.e. the girl/guy you fucked 2 months ago), but rather the activity from much further back (the girls/guys you were with last year, possibly even 2 years back).  For an HIV test to really show you with >99% certainty that you AREN'T infected (at all, i.e. a proverbial ""all clear"") you would basically need to be celibate for a full ~24+ months prior to the test.  Medical professionals should all know that (alas not everyone in Medicine is necessarily as ""sharp"" as the field claims, in fact far from it**), but they generally have given up trying to explain it to patients, because people really just don't want to listen/comprehend it.    ** And relative to this comment as well as the intelligence/knowledge of ""medical"" people:   EDIT: Oh! fun fact, every girl I knew who admitted to not using protection countered with, ""if it looks infected I won't touch it.""   I have known Nurses (and an occasional Doctor) who basically took this attitude as well.   It's one of several basic/fundamental - yet significant -- ""logic fails"" that seems to be pervasively present with most of humanity  (even ostensibly ""educated/smart"" individuals): they can comprehend only HALF of the equation, i.e. ""if it LOOKS infected, it probably IS infected"" - which as a general rule of thumb will probably be correct much of the time; but the converse is NOT necessarily anywhere NEAR as true ""if it DOESN'T look infected, well that doesn't mean it ISN'T infected"".  People do this ALL the time, and with all kinds of things:   if the building/deck/whatever is still standing and LOOKS nice and ""strong"" (or ""new"") then we can not only stand on it safely but we can pile a whole CROWD of people on it just as safely (umm nope... 40 people collectively weight ~20x to ~40x what 1 or 2 people do); if the water in the pool looks ""clear"" then - even despite the sign saying  ""closed/stay out"" -- well it must be safe to swim in right?

MGTOW,3bvggw,SoullessTechnocrat,2,Thu Jul 2 16:36:10 2015 UTC,"if the building/deck/whatever is still standing and LOOKS nice and ""strong"" (or ""new"") then we can not only stand on it safely but we can pile a whole CROWD of people on it just as safely (umm nope... 40 people collectively weight ~20x to ~40x what 1 or 2 people do);   Funny story about that. I was at a frat party a few years back and the house was so packed you were shoulder to shoulder. Eventually my boys and I decided to leave when minutes later we heard a loud cracking noise from the ground level house. We heard as people started tumbling out and EMS were on the way that the floor of the main room had caved in. On ground level!"
MGTOW,3bvggw,SoullessTechnocrat,2,Thu Jul 2 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"Funny story about that. I was at a frat party a few years back and the house was so packed you were shoulder to shoulder. Eventually my boys and I decided to leave when minutes later we heard a loud cracking noise from the ground level house. We heard as people started tumbling out and EMS were on the way that the floor of the main room had caved in. On ground level!   Yes, I'm really never all that surprised when I hear about some ""disaster"" of that type -- whether some balcony or deck, or as you note even the floor of a house.  The structures -- especially ones built as ""residential"" ones -- were never designed to carry THAT kind of a load: certainly not in the center of some ""span""... the place that any large gathering of people will, pretty much of necessity end up standing.  As I noted, people aren't exactly ""light"" -- and even a relatively small gathering of people can easily end up in the multiple TON range. Take a typical ""wedding party"" these days: Bride + Groom (2), then add in a half-dozen bridesmaids and another half-dozen groomsmen (+12)... and already you're basically over 2,000 lbs, and that's IF they are all of rather ""median"" BMI (i.e. say an average weight of 150 lbs/70 kg) -- if, as is increasingly common the dudes are > 6 ft (~2 m) and either bulked up and/or overweight, then they can easily go 250 to 300 lbs (110 to 140 kg) each, toss in a couple of ""fatty"" bridesmaids at > 300 lbs (150+ kg) and/or enlarge that group with a few extra people, and you can end up with a COUPLE of tons... all standing (and possibly dancing, bouncing, shifting around, which significantly increases the load-stresses) in the center of some span that was basically designed (at max) to carry a quarter of that.  You might as well stick a couple of hefty CATTLE in the middle of the deck or living room -- or try to park a small car there -- most people wouldn't be surprised at all to see those things cause the structure to collapse, yet they express ""shock"" that a similar weight in people could do the same (especially if/when the structure is aging, and/or has experienced repeated ""overloadings"" over several years -- as probably happened with that ""frat house"")."
MGTOW,3bvggw,SoullessTechnocrat,2,Thu Jul 2 18:06:59 2015 UTC,"Odd story of my own... and I think this was probably one of the things that, being an early ""experience"" probably put me in the mindset of an ""engineer"" in regard to these kinds of things.  You know the bibical story of Samson and him causing the ""collapse"" of a whole building... well for whatever reason the Sunday school teacher that I had who taught that lesson was in the building trades (a carpenter), and the way he chose to explain that both made it more fascinating and a lot less ""miraculous"" than the way it is normally told -- basically he noted that the structures back then tended to have a kind of ""open atrium"" in the middle, and that they were often built essentially as a sort of porch-like balcony that went around the entire interior atrium...  And he noted that if you had some ""spectacle"" object or person in the middle of that atrium, the kind where people would all be gathered around, ""packed in"" as it were and all vying for a position/turn at leaning over the balcony.  Well, in those kinds of circumstances, a LOT of people can manage to squeeze themselves in, even a couple of layers deep. (And he had us kids get up and stand really close, side by side, in rows -- he kind of even ""challenged"" us to see how many and how tight we could pack ourselves, and we found that especially if we wrapped our arms around each other, basically the whole class of like a dozen kids, well we could all pack into a really tiny 'square footage' area {alternating black & white tile floor made that easy}.)  Then he talked about how much WEIGHT that could be -- I don't recall the exact figures, but basically it's less than 2 sq ft per person, and only a little over 2 linear foot per person along some balcony or railing, plus you can pack 2 or 3 rows of people -- anyway he figured that with even just some 100' x 50' atrium (~300 linear foot), you could end up with anywhere from about 1,000 people able to ""see"" and possibly 2,000 to 3,000 people trying to see along some relatively narrow balcony (i.e. the size we know they built)... and then from there it's just ""how much did each person weight"" -- even at the low end you're talking over 50 tons (and he did chalkboard stuff like ""that's 10 cars1"" etc).  Anyway, he posited that while Samson may have been strong, well he might not have needed much for ""superhuman"" strength to cause that structure to collapse... the weight of the crowd was probably already straining the structure to the brink. (He kind of stopped short of saying that it was just an ""accident"" -- or that the collapse wasn't necessarily caused by Samson's strength -- but for the smarter kids, well that was sort of a natural inference.)  I was always a bit leary of getting up in any of my friends' cobbled together treehouses after that -- especially if there was a bunch of people trying to climb up & out onto it -- just me and a friend, no problem... The whole gang up there at once? Ummm, no thanks, I uh... I think I'll stay down here.  Also kind of made me prefer to be over in the ""less occupied"" sections of things like bleachers at football games and such... my brain just automatically starts counting people + multiplying out the load, and says ""nope... go sit over there on the end instead."" LOL."

What happens is all of the things you listed are coming from both men and women enforcing it. Most men default to a sort of ""white knight"" ness where they believe in some sort of true love that can only be achieved when they protect the fairer, more kind, female sex. This leads them to having onitis and pouring their resources into these women out of a sense of duty and affection for them. Women just go ahead and accept this arrangement since they know their vaginas give them so much leverage. This lets them reinforce these norms because at the end of the day they really get good benefits from it.   So it is both sides reinforcing the norms of this game. MGTOW, Red Pill, etc. is men realizing how stupid and self-damaging their beliefs were. Red Pill tries to turn the game on its head whereas MGTOW says it isn't even worth the effort to try to fix the game."

MGTOW,3buq6m,BKDre,17,Thu Jul 2 08:43:39 2015 UTC,"I remember when i was 18 i was dating this girl for about 8 months who i would religiously pay for when we go out. I was a super simp, mangina maximus. It was my first serious relationship so i thought i had to do everything the simps told me to do.   Eventually after working a partime job, and blowing hundreds of dollars on a girl that earned more than i did. I realized this is fucking stupid. I think it was this moment i began really turning mgtow but i obviously didnt know it. MGTOW didnt exist yet. But anyway, i lost my partime job. Soon after she realized i was broke, she didnt want to go out anymore. Hey wanna grab a movie ""nope"". She never wanted to eat out anymore. Funny huh. One Saturday i set up a dinner date with her, we get there i proceeded to order about 50 bucks worth of food FOR MYSELF. :) She ordered something as well. When the check came i pretended to reach for my wallet and said i left it at home. SHE WAS SO PISSED when she realized she would finally have to pick up the bill or wash dishes. She paid close to $100 for the meal. Chump changed compared to what i got for her all the gifts, dates etc. Shortly after this our relationship started to turn real sour. Id say easily half my earnings were going to her, so it was eye opening too see female nature in action. She had no interest in reciprocating financially.   We broke up about a month later. She said ""I wasnt acting like a boyfriend anymore.""   Since then i havnt taken girls on many dates, or paid for shit. I just refuse to do it. I hate the concept of dating. Ive been this way for about 10 years. Saved a ton of money being single and avoiding having to pay for women to see if they are interested in me. So stupid.  If i were to ever ask another chick out, it would be for a walk or something like that. Very inexpensive. Maybe a coffee. But im hardcore mgtow so i doubt anything like this will happen."

You take a chick to a dinner date, and there are a ton of unsaid rules women have created so it gets awkward. You sit there praying she doesnt order something incredibly expensive. Because you know it could be the first and final date so you dont want to spend too much without knowing if you can fuck or not. The menu comes and you try to order something not too expensive praying to follows your lead. The when the food comes, the convo is usually dry, nonintellectual, casual talk that could have been done while sitting on a park bench. Finally the dinner is over, and i notice the waiter will always ask you the man if you would like the check now. While the girl just looks at you while trying to continue a convo to mask the fact that shes not going to offer to pay, and expects you to. Its just all too weird. Ive been on first and last dates maybe 2 or 3 times in my life, and i always felt like i had been robbed.   I have female friends and they all call me mean. I refuse to treat them until they treat me. Im trying to maintain this ideal with everyone man/woman.   But yeah dating is stupid!

MGTOW,3buagt,drkstrs,-1,Sat Jul 4 12:02:13 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you don't even know what a liberal is.  I sure see a lot of people who aren't liberals but say they are, or are liberals but don't even realize it.  I know I'm not a liberal. I deal in fact only."
MGTOW,3buagt,drkstrs,-1,Tue Jul 7 04:34:47 2015 UTC,"a big problem is liberals turning the country into a nation state, rather than a republic of states."
MGTOW,3buagt,oldredder,7,Thu Jul 2 13:43:43 2015 UTC,"I've seen this argument before, but it always puzzles me.  How can you NOT be in favor of the concepts of limited government, minimal intrusion of government (federal, state and local) into your personal life, and low taxation, and be MGTOW?  The liberal mindset is that the government should be involved/interfere in ALL areas of a citizen's life, from cradle to grave."
MGTOW,3buagt,loddfavne,2,Thu Jul 2 11:19:13 2015 UTC,"GOP is not in favor of limited government. It all depends on the issue. They will intrude if you're gay, a recreational drug user, a woman who wants an abortion, etc. etc. Stop confusing libertarians with republicans. There are libertarian-minded people on both sides."
MGTOW,3buagt,oldredder,2,Thu Jul 2 15:24:20 2015 UTC,"GOP is not in favor of limited government   What they want is no oversights of the parts of the  government they favor.   There is a huge difference.  And I'm not saying Liberals are substantially  different, but please drop the blinders.  They are masters of bait and switch and the PR campaign.   Take for instance the all inclusive military and Pentagon black hole filled with bloated payouts and no bid contracts to corrupt contractors and giant abusers of public money like Oracle.  Oracle can take 240 million of public money to build a fucking website and still not deliver (see Cover Oregon but this is the tip of the iceberg for their malfeasance in abuse of public money.  They have blown billions on systems for the Marines).  I have seen this shit go down for years because I know people involved in some aspects of these endless boondoggles.  It is easy to distract the public from such ""complicated"" issues.   So who do they want to cut in government?  The fucking oversight of this kind of shit!  That's ""limiting government"" means to them. It's about keeping their tap on.  They pay some stupid DBA 500K (Obama reduced it from the former cap of 1 million) because that's the most they can charge by law, and they deliberately miss every deadline to keep the tap of public money flowing.   Finally the whole project is dead or years over budget but ""oh well"". You can't really lose in these kind of deals.   This is where the money is really going while gay marriage and creationism or food stamps or whatever takes another turn on the stage.   Bread and circuses.   I don't even know which party is primarily to blame, they both turn a blind eye.  Just remember ""cutting government"" rhetoric usually means cutting out the part of the government that does oversight of their pet projects whether right or left.  Don't believe it when they say they are for ""limited government"" it's a lie. The whistleblowers and regulators are what they hate (couched as 'interfering with ""business""' ha!).  The correct question about limiting government is ""which part"". The phrase is not catch all.  What they want is no accountability.  You can fail but not them, they get paid no matter what happens.   This is plutocracy we live under, folks. The plutocrats running the show will distract you any way they can and they are in both parties.  Just remember how they got their money when these rich thieves try to lord over you because they ""deserve"" their ""success"" or claim it's about protecting America or ""talent"" or god forbid they must pay tax on what they steal.  They are sleazeballs.   Go watch Larry prance around on his yacht. They don't give a rat's ass about your measly middle class tax bracket or about ""working hard"".  They view your values as something only to manipulate. They want to cut taxes on themselves.  It does not ""trickle down"". It goes to some offshore account.   It makes my blood boil to pay taxes to these cheats but the GOP will not fix it anymore than the Liberals will. Yes they play us all so well.  Politics and the media is merely their theater.  Take another RP on that one if you will.  It's high time these lies are properly exposed.  Do not be their shill!"

The burden of having the government providing for women and minorities is bad for men who pay the majority of the taxes.  The leftist does not fight for mens rights. It might be that the state takes better care of women than men. That's why it's no problem for society when men off themselves. I think the high taxes associated with the leftist politics might be useful for women, but for men the collective solutions will always be better for women than men. For instance when the leftists say education, they forget to mention that they only care for females getting education. Not males.  There are plenty of arguments against the right too. If there is no collective upbringing the state will have to use laws to incarcarete people. The people who end up in jail is usually men. Marriage might also be a thing that used to be good for men, but today it leads to divorce and broken families. There are pitfalls in conservative societies for men, but you can avoid them. The pitfalls of footing the bill for the leftists is not a choice, it goes right out of your paycheck every month."

But I care about more than fair taxation:   Equal sentencing for equal crimes, especially sex crimes.  Burden of proof shifted back to innocent until proven guilty and beyond all reasonable doubt for all sex crime and workplace sexual harassment allegations.  Don't ""teach men not to rape"".  It's already a felony.  Teach women what the actual legal definition of rape is, and how to affirmatively say no.  It's not a fucking martial arts class.  You don't have to turn them into Kwai Chang Caine.  A loud and assertive ""no!"" is more effective than trying to get everyone to positively affirm that sex should continue or fill out a fucking form before unbuttoning the next button.  This ridiculous shit won't stop until lesbians start going to jail for spontaneously groping each other or leaning in for a kiss. De-villainization of men and men's sexuality generally.  I go around scowling and ignoring kids in public like some mean old man so people don't think I'm a child abductor.  Seriously, sometimes I'm nervous about roughhousing with my nephews.  I spent so many years in the corporate environment where I could lose my career with one careless sentence within earshot of a female coworker, now I don't even remember how to flirt on an actual date. Equal risk and combat duty for male and female military personnel.  Male and female draft if it ever comes back in a major war.  Anti-discrimination laws for heavy trades, to prevent female employees from doing paperwork in air conditioned offices for the same pay, while male employees haul heavy shit and turn wrenches all day.  If you can't do the same work or you try to pull shorter hours, you get paid less.  Period. Reproductive rights for men, including Vasalgel provided free under the ACA just as birth control pills are for women.  ""Paper abortion"" to allow men to surrender custody rights and support obligations in case of an accidental pregnancy where the woman wants to bear the child to term but the man doesn't.  Financial support always linked to custody rights.  Mandatory universal paternity testing of newborns. Complete default separation of finances in marriage to make divorce fairer to men.  If you want to mingle joint finances you have to hire lawyers and get a prenup to do it.  Permanent  abolition of alimony.  If the bitch wants to dump your ass she can dump out of the comfy lifestyle you provided for her at the same time. Automatic 50-50 child custody split unless child abuse can be proven in criminal court.  ""Child support"" is what you pay to your child when you buy him or her school clothes or whatever else they need.  Not a $3000 check to your ex-wife so she can get her nails done and shop for shoes while your kids wear rags. Legalization and social normalization of taxed and regulated brothels.  Let women be as hypergamous as they want to be when sex is ""free"".  Some guys will still want to jump through those hoops for the ""free"" pussy that dozens of guys at the club she goes to already had.  90% of us should just do what Tyrion does when he wants some pussy.  If it flies, floats, or fucks, rent don't buy.  Also, grow the fuck up and repeal your stupid porn laws, UK and Australia.   OK, so which party wants to step up and codify those social changes into law?  Liberal Democrats?  Social conservative religious Republicans (without whom the GOP couldn't get a dog catcher elected to office)?  Libertarians?  Hello?

For example, in the US, while the Libertarian Party is closest, the GOP is still much closer than the Democratic Party.

MGTOW,3bra5a,paracog,8,Wed Jul 1 21:03:29 2015 UTC,Men will never win fights by complaining our way through them. That is a female tactic. Men win fights by taking on a problem forcibly and intelligently and crushing it into nothing.
MGTOW,3bra5a,elokr,7,Thu Jul 2 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"Feminists know that they've just about burned through the bankroll of honor and sentiment women earned through their sacrifices in birthing and rearing children, and it's freaking them out.  Male oriented activism just reads as abuse to true believer feminists.  MGTOW is more a-feminist, staying out of the argument entirely, since the context is just poisonous to men, and does women no favors as well.  Leave the empty public blather to women, and let actions make the statement."

I'm not against homosexual people at all but self-identified LGBT-people are just a side wing of feminism and thus another anti-male hate group."

If mgtows did this than I firmly invite the ones to go fuck themselves.

MGTOW,3bra5a,scarredlife,3,Wed Jul 1 18:32:23 2015 UTC,Here--have a free up-vote. Seems the LGBTs are about as bad as the Feminists for trying to get everybody else to do things their way.

MGTOW,3bra5a,scarredlife,7,Wed Jul 1 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"The LGBT mostly does not care about others who differ from their beliefs. Rather than finding bakers who will provide cakes for their ceremonies, they file lawsuits against people who don't.   The well-being of someone's livelihood doesn't matter to them. For them, it is just me me me. My rights, my wants, my beliefs, my ideas, my equality. I won't expend any effort so that you can do your thing and I do mine.

MGTOW,3bx8nf,pirate6728,11,Thu Jul 2 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"The idea of MGTOW as some sort of monolithic brand that can be boosted or degraded by the quality of men who individually find empowerment, solace, encouragement, and support through it, well that's kind of missing the point.  Their own way means each man owns his own experience and his own association.  What others think of us is by definition beside the point.  Wise men have always been regarded as fools by the great mass of people.  I'd advise you to look to your own path and piss off from judging others."
MGTOW,3bx8nf,paracog,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:06:29 2015 UTC,Point taken. Understanding adjusted accordingly. Thanks for the clarification.
MGTOW,3bx8nf,Cheesypeesy,10,Mon Jul 6 00:11:01 2015 UTC,"Read the side bar - MGTOW is about ""Instilling true self-defined masculinity in men. We're not all one hive mind, we're a group of men with different backgrounds united under an acronym.   And who says a man has to do everything involving relationships? Why stick your hand in the fire when you know it'll burn?   Whilst men should be encouraged to improve themselves, MGTOW means something different to everyone. We're all going our own individual ways."
MGTOW,3bx8nf,oldredder,-5,Thu Jul 2 22:25:57 2015 UTC,"I recognize everyone's right to forge their own path in life. The point still remains: certain limitations undoubtedly guide the decisions of some but not others. And because of these limitations encountered (poor genetics, bad finances, lack of education, luck of the draw, etc.), these folks cannot get through every locked door in life and instead must find a different route not out of desire, but out of necessity. Thus, with a limited choice to begin with, he must instead do the best with what he has."
MGTOW,3bx8nf,oldredder,2,Thu Jul 2 23:03:52 2015 UTC,that point has already been addressed. It's still part of what defines each personal path.
MGTOW,3bx8nf,Noirtebell,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:55:54 2015 UTC,"Noted. And that makes perfect sense. The more I take the perspective of others, the more I have become understanding to this cause. But really, this isn't a real ""cause"" at all because MGTOW is not about activism. It's more of a coincidence that all MGTOW share a similar philosophy. Am I understanding that correctly?"
MGTOW,3bx8nf,PartlyMe,0,Mon Jul 6 00:02:38 2015 UTC,yes. We each learned that going our own way is the right way. Serving others or serving nonsense as a life purpose is the alternative.
MGTOW,3bx8nf,mojobytes,10,Tue Jul 7 05:03:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not, gynocentrism hurts incels the most because it is a hunger that they have no capacity to sate, pussy becomes like the holy grail to them, and they would spend their entire lives chasing it without the wake-up call of MGTOW knowledge -- those guys simply need it the most. There is also, among these, those violent Elliot Rodgers types who needed to go their own way a LONG time ago. Otherwise, the desire for pussy will fester in their brains and eventually reach critical mass and then who knows what will happen? Those guys NEED to go their own way.    Plus these guys can learn a lot by devoting their energies to redpill/mgtow lore, or the pursuit of knowledge/wisdom... Don't underestimate what a guy with all the time in the world can achieve, without wasting his life away chasing after the wind, there is a lot of potential ESPECIALLY if we catch these incels early."
MGTOW,3bx8nf,mojobytes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:37:13 2015 UTC,"It is quite a shame to place pussy on a pedestal like that. And what's more, to become violent over the fact that it may be unobtainable. The fact that the motivation behind Rodger's crime was his incel-itude isn't completely convincing to me. He was obviously a troubled youth with greater issues than the frustrations of not getting laid. Replace his want of sex with a thief's want of riches and you have the same personality which is not right for any fringe of society."
MGTOW,3bx8nf,mojobytes,8,Mon Jul 6 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"What, you mean there's a spectrum of men here? Heaven forbid that some of us should disagree with others or differ on anything.. /s"

MGTOW,3bx8nf,mojobytes,-11,Thu Jul 2 22:58:18 2015 UTC,"Not in the least. But there should be some sort of way to identify if a guy is choosing something out of genuine desire rather than out of desperation. That being said, I am a big supporter of the private lives of others and not needing justification to- or validation from- the masses. So this is quite the conundrum."
MGTOW,3bx8nf,PartlyMe,5,Thu Jul 2 23:08:56 2015 UTC,Why does it matter?
MGTOW,3bx8nf,7768678987,-5,Thu Jul 2 23:10:21 2015 UTC,"It matters because motivation and self betterment seem to be unwritten agendae of this movement. If someone fails then lives his life as if that failure was a conscious decision, outwardly projecting that to others, well then he is a liar."
MGTOW,3bx8nf,PartlyMe,6,Thu Jul 2 23:15:44 2015 UTC,So just fuck those guys?
MGTOW,3bx8nf,oldredder,-4,Thu Jul 2 23:27:12 2015 UTC,I don't have time for liars in my personal or professional life. So to answer your question: yes.
MGTOW,3bx8nf,PartlyMe,4,Thu Jul 2 23:30:38 2015 UTC,"Alright so we're just writing off a lot of guys who are suffering, some of whom could really be open to our ideas?  Why do you need to think of them as liars?  I guess I'll leave because I'm not perfect, you should probably mention on the sidebar that you need to be perfect to be MGTOW."
MGTOW,3bx8nf,oldredder,-8,Thu Jul 2 23:33:21 2015 UTC,"In order to effect positive change, one must first realize there is a problem. For one to deny that a problem exists (see: liars) is problematic in and of itself. I am otherwise very inclusive.  But for one to be dealt a bad lot in life, which he in turn excuses by saying ""I chose this"", is not acceptable either."

MGTOW,3bx8nf,DroppingTruths,-6,Thu Jul 2 23:12:34 2015 UTC,The end would be a community where integrity is a tenet. Good luck finding anything that even remotely resembles that in a PUA or TRP methodology.
MGTOW,3bx8nf,TheQuestion78,7,Thu Jul 2 23:20:06 2015 UTC,Why are you looking for us to inspire you? Aren't you a self-described creator renaissance man?  What are you even doing on reddit?  Shouldn't you be out winning?

MGTOW,3bx5e1,DroppingTruths,13,Thu Jul 2 21:51:31 2015 UTC,The day I let squirrel-bait like you tell me who is and who isn't MGTOW is the day the sun quits shining. 'Nuff said.
MGTOW,3bx5e1,pirate6728,-5,Thu Jul 2 22:32:21 2015 UTC,"Then you are just trying to bloat the ""MGTOW"" term to something which it is not. Not everybody is MGTOW. In that case it would be meaningless."
MGTOW,3bx5e1,pirate6728,12,Thu Jul 2 22:55:47 2015 UTC,"Look, chum, if you want to live under a bridge with all of your belongings in a shopping-cart, be my guest. Nobody's stopping you.  I like living somewhat better than that. So long as that is the case, I'll probably have a job or a business doing something, and as long as I do I'll be legally required to pay taxes. But--- I get to have a decent place to sleep, I don't have to eat out of dumpsters and I can get clothing somewhere other than the local charities. So I do get a return for my labors--- such as they are (I'm an expedited/hotshot driver, ""labor"" doesn't exactly describe what I do very well-- grin)..  MGTOW should NOT mean living as a homeless person. Getting divorced can do that to you, no need for MGTOW. Further--- note what the acronym means. I'm going my way. Isaiah4 goes his way. You go yours. This is NOT a group where we all march to the identical drumbeat.  So--- some guys are well set, they manage to have the nice house, car, clothing and all the rest of it. They're MGTOW because they've chosen NOT to make women the central part of their existence. They pay the legally required taxes because a stint in Leavenworth doesn't have much appeal.  The guy who has a walk-up apartment, a 10-year-old Chevy that he prays he can keep running, and a job that just makes ends meet--- he's MGTOW too. Maybe he's MGTOW because a woman cleaned him out--- maybe he's MGTOW because he chooses to not get on the treadmill and decides to just have enough. In any case--- it's not for you or me to decide."
MGTOW,3bx5e1,pirate6728,-3,Thu Jul 2 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"So by your logic and inflationary use of the term MGTOW somebody who enjoys working 60 hours a week in order to feed his 5 children while his wife spends the day reading lifestyle magazines at the pool is MGTOW as well?   I've recently read about some perverse fetish where men are aroused by giving away money to women. Everybody who doesn't believe me, google it: ""findom or financial domination""  According to you these guys are some first class MGTOW. What if in general men enjoy providing for women for little in return? A surprisingly large amount of men consider alimony completely fair and sensible. MGTOW as well? Don't you see the contradiction?  Judging from your post you actually admit that your are exploited by society and see no reason to do anything about it. Doesn't sound very MGTOW to me..."
MGTOW,3bx5e1,pirate6728,3,Thu Jul 2 23:32:40 2015 UTC,"You put words in my mouth that I never said. I suspect you're really female--- women are good at that sort of thing. Take what a man says out of context, twist it and use it against him. Yep, you're a female troll. So--- how's life under the bridge?"
MGTOW,3bx5e1,sardinemanR,-5,Thu Jul 2 23:39:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing how I've twisted anything you said unfairly. If you really define the term ""MGTOW"" so broadly that it actually includes anybody who does what he likes this term becomes entirely meaningless. Many men MGTOWs would normally laugh at could suddenly become MGTOW as well because they might just enjoy the humiliation and exploitation they are facing.  Also, thanks to the welfare state I'm not living under a bridge."
MGTOW,3bx5e1,pirate6728,9,Thu Jul 2 23:43:04 2015 UTC,"Yep--- you're female. Or a White Knight, which is nearly the same thing. Not a doubt of it."

MGTOW,3bx5e1,pirate6728,7,Fri Jul 3 16:14:29 2015 UTC,"I can't understand how you think being MGTOW means taking a vow of poverty, or otherwise dodging taxes.

Now if YOU want to never pay taxes, that's fine, it's obvious you're female and you don't anyway.  For the rest of us males in the real world, we have to provide for ourselves because society doesn't care. The irony is that if it DID stop taxing us, then YOU would have a problem."
MGTOW,3bx5e1,heeeeeeeeheeeeeeeeee,-7,Fri Jul 3 08:28:04 2015 UTC,"You made the same mistake I've already pointed out to pirate6728. MGTOW is pretty clearly defined in ""4 stages of MGTOW"".  MGTOW doesn't mean ""do what you want"" because this would obviously be completely meaningless.   How did you arrive at the same fallacious conclusion about my sex that pirate6728 actually fucked up? Why would I post an advise on MGTOW directly opposed to my self-interest?"
MGTOW,3bx5e1,paracog,5,Fri Jul 3 16:07:12 2015 UTC,"You would do it because you're a troll.

MGTOW,3bx5e1,machine_language,5,Fri Jul 3 19:45:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the rant.   who cares about you withdrawing from the dating pool: maybe your parents. That's it. Who cares about women withdrawing? Everybody   Errrm, back to front there. Men withdrawing from the dating pool is much more of a concern due to their simultaneous withdrawal of direct resourses for women to exploit directly. There's not much evidence to suggest women are withdrawing!! More like lamenting the withdrawal of men (whose resources they see disappearing into the distance..)  As for 'smashing the system' as you appear to be advocating: if men reject playing a rigged game with women due to the impossibility of anything other than a pyrrhic victory, how do you think they might feel about attempting to fight The State?! In life you must either choose your battles wisely or die young, perhaps in a blaze of glory, but young nonetheless.   I enjoy many of the benefits this somewhat fucked up society offers and I see no advantage to me in going out on a limb to make some point about gynocentric taxation: There are 3 certainties in life - Death, Taxes and that your taxes will be mainly spent on women. Either get over it or use up your very limited lifespan to fight it.   There are most definitely ways in which most of our lives could be called 'slavery'. The art of living requires acceptance of what you cannot change. Otherwise, get out there and fight whatever fight you deem appropriate. It's all choice.."
MGTOW,3bx5e1,machine_language,-3,Thu Jul 2 22:12:08 2015 UTC,"Women are increasingly withdrawing from giving birth though which is their main purpose and concern for society. With the breakdown of the nuclear family you'll also find more and more women unwilling to settle down and instead live ""free-spirited"" (slutting it up in their prime) even if it means spending their retirement lonely and miserable. I guarantee you this is a much larger concern to society and the willingness of politics to tacke this issue shows it. Men willing to impregnate women are dime a dozen and thus no concern to a society in which the upbringing of children is crossfinanced by the labour of the male population anyway. Look at Germany for example: lowest birth rate in the world. How are they tackling this? By importing tons of immigrants and giving women all kinds of opportunities to take time off for their children, etc. At no point in time is the willingness of men considered. It's a given.  Why I am advocating for ""smashing the system"" by passive resistance and deprivation of resources is that no direct fight is possible any longer. Even the ""4 stages of MGTOW"" manifesto advocates in favor of this form of resistance.  If you refuse to fight this system at the core (collectivist extraction of resources from men and distribution to women with no reward for the men) you might as well engage in mindless hedonism and stop caring about any of the fundamental assertions of MGTOW. Then you are just another contributor to the system that MGTOW are ought to reject.   Yes, it's all choice and I'm not trying to force anybody to do anything but I can't stop shaking my head reading posts of men here deluding themselves into believing they are actually depriving society of something that is so ubiquitous as male sexuality and commitment to women."
MGTOW,3bx5e1,Watchful1ntervention,6,Thu Jul 2 22:39:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think many, if any, men here think that it is their sexuality that they are denying women. Instead it's their time, attention and resources that are denied. I don't delude myself that any woman would give a single solitary shite about being denied access to my genitalia. What I know for a fact, however, is that they absolutely DO give a shit about my refusal to give them my resources."
MGTOW,3bx5e1,pirate6728,-2,Thu Jul 2 22:53:59 2015 UTC,You might give them your resources anyway through taxes though. If you are intelligent or lucky enough to live somewhere with minimal welfare where you pay 15% taxes my rant does obviously not apply to you.  Many full-time working single men in the first world however pay taxes in the range of 30/40% (including social security/health insurance scam). Think about the time that is wasted for others and the causes your money supports. Some of them are directly aimed against men.   Being in a situation like this and claming you are MGTOW would be ridiculous and yet I see people doing it here frequently.

If someone takes my money at gun-point and gives it to people who don't deserve it, the moral blame is on them, not me.  My standard of living and access to life's more expensive experiences and opportunities is more valuable to me than some abstract incentive to not work so that others can't residually benefit from my labor.  If you go on the dole, fine. But you wont have a great life. The best people wont respect you or want you in their lives. That's because you're a leech and are living in the lower classes of society.

If you need to resort to exaggerated language to make a point, your point is not strong.   I do not have ""no problem"": I'm strongly opposed to my tax dollars being spent this way and my participation in the political process reflects that.  I am not directly supporting the system: I an involuntarily, indirectly supporting the system.  The system is not sick and depraved: The system is grossly flawed and needs adjustment.  I'm not engaging in mindless hedonism: I'm valuing my freedom to enjoy a variety of opportunities.   If the answers in this thread are indicative of MGTOW this movement is dead and really nothing more than some blokes crying about how mean women are.   MGTOW is not a movement. It's a lifestyle choice which may also involve not participating in internet forums. Remember, there are 4 levels of MGTOW. The MGTOW level you think represents all of MGTOW is actually level 3. Most MGTOWS are at either level 1 or level 2 and intend to stay that way. Economic disengagement is not advantageous to me so I will continue to make money and live a better life than you.

Regardless of what the reasons might be, how does it affect you?  I saw an article the other day on Return of Kings which was quite critical of MGTOW, yet they blocked me after only one post.   I've observed that the critics of MGTOW make hit-and-run attacks, yet are too afraid and too sensitive to listen to any response or opposing views.  What does that say about them?"

MGTOW,3bwu1g,DroppingTruths,7,Thu Jul 2 21:22:15 2015 UTC,"As much as it maybe denied by some MGTOW rejection or the fear of rejection can of course be at play here. It's not a hard achievement to withdraw from the dating market as a man as long as you aren't some loaded playboy. Claiming otherwise would be delusional.  But this in itself is not an argument against MGTOW. It's a cheap shaming tactic at best because this is apparently all our society has to offer men for their work aside from constant bashing, blaming and discrimination against them: a carrot in the form of a vagina and female appreciation. Now that even this meager reward is increasingly tarnished or unavailable because women are free to indulge into unchecked hypergamy funded by the state through male taxes and leave droves of average men unsatisfied this is the point where many men opt out because the deal has gone sour. Chasing something women get for free in an increasingly rigged game might simply not be worth it. And this is where you analogy is flawed. The grapes are actually not that sweet anymore and there are reasons to not want them aside from being unable to get them.  It's probably true that a rich playboy will think differently about women as long as he has easy access (he will most likely not consider them equal or respect them though because experiencing their nature first hand will have shattered this lie perpetuated by society) but don't think reality can't hit him in the face just as hard.  Even the most ""successful alphas"" can be fucked over badly. Think about Dominique Strauss-Kahn. A fat, black room cleaner ruined his entire prospect of becoming the next French president on top of costing him millions. And now he just barely escaped a prison sentence for faciliating prostitution by the French courts under jurisdictions backed by the party that he supported in the first place.  So, yes. Some men turn to MGTOW out of rejection but there's more to this and it doesn't mean that the choice is bad one."

Also, what does this question has to offer to an unattractive male? Nothing but shaming? So what if somebody has realized their own inadequatenss/ low SMV and acts upon it accordingly?  What should he do instead? Let oneself be willingly deceived and exploited by the system? Chasing something women and attractive males get for free and thereby wasting their own time for the interests of others?   Even if somebody answers OPs question truthfully with yes this doesn't take any legitimation off of MGTOW and is just another shaming tactic set out to pull men back into the system.

If this is you too, guess what? You're wrong. Some of the first MGTOWs were divorced men. Men stuck paying alimony to a cheating ex wife who divorced him. Men screwed over sideways in family courts for child custody. Then it spread to men in marriages who were downright miserable with the way their wives treated them. Then it spread to men in relationships that were fed up with the dating world and how they were expected to act, despite being taken advantage of by women. Some of these men have been in abusive relationships. Then finally is spread to the young single guys in their 20's.  It's not that MGTOWS cant get a date, they just dont want to. They've taken a good logical look at dating, marriage, and they way divorce courts treat them. At that point they decided to say “screw this i'm out”.

MGTOW,3bwu1g,danonymous2,2,Mon Jul 6 06:53:27 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand.  Nothing I named here is emotionally motivated, much less ill-conceived.  I might react emotionally to what I'm describing, but everything here is fact:   Our culture punishes men who have one night stands, proportional to their income (Male contraceptives are not 100% effective -- and the cost of a one night stand, when accounting for all controllable losses actually BREAKS EVEN with the cost of sex with a high class hooker if you make MINIMUM WAGE -- based purely on the potential losses of accidentally conceiving with all controllable variables.  The damage done actually INCREASES LINEARLY with your wage, meaning that a one night stand is actually dumber the more you make!) Our culture makes women accountable to the decision to claim right to carry to full term, and to be made accountable for the wages that a man should lose, without regard for the true COST or PRACTICALITY of that responsibility and the weight that it carriers, no matter how unachievable, no matter any prior agreements or understanding, written or spoken.  And no matter how much you WANT to trust her, or WANT to pleasure her for what would otherwise have been a mutually enjoyable activity. Our culture expects men to want to fuck, even though it's like playing russian roulette for a man with ODDS of failure, while she doesn't have to gamble for financial loss during sex at all! Our culture steals a man's offspring in divorce and expects men to pay for them still. Our culture rewards the non-primary earner in divorce directly proportionally to the difference in income --which is a breeding ground for extortion and destruction of the maritial contract and the family unit whenever it is too inconvenient for the lesser earner to remain in that contract. Our culture institutionalizes financial extortion and exponantial deflation of a man's mate value through marriage, by taking away half his life's security every time he TRIES TO FALL IN LOVE and REMAINS LOYAL at each attempt at marriage. Our culture does not value men who wouldn't make more than an particular woman in marriage. Our culture claims that women should be earning as much as men, without regard for qualifications, effectiveness, or skills. Our culture claims that a woman who cries rape is to be trusted without evidence. Our culture claims that approaching a woman makes a man a creep. Our culture claims that I am a dog who wants to impress a woman enough to overlook all this. Our culture claims men should pay on every date, even if the woman is an asshole. Our culture claims that I have to be alpha or to 'be the man' in order to somehow 'win' in vortex of suffering.   Every single thing here is true.  My problem is not that I hate women.  My problem is all of the above is actually happening and rewarded.  My problem is that society still tries to hold that women are 'sweet', 'beautiful', and 'compassionate' angels, when this entire game is rigged to fuck me over everywhere that I would have once - in a much better time - actually found happiness and mutual gains with a woman.  So NO.  I do NOT want to hit on them.  I do NOT want to flirt with them.  I do NOT find someone reciprocating any leap of faith, any mirror to my masculine-qualities, any happiness from genuine chivalry, or any romantic or sexual chemistry with the kind of joyous or compassionate bonding that once would have been achievable if you actually treated men like less than fucking SLAVES ready to be kicked in the balls to the tune of feminist laughter while they exponentially deplete my retirement savings and deprive me of my own fucking offspring.

That's why they are attracted more to confident, dominating males because they must be bored with every other ones.  Yet, I would not give up and say ""okay I accept my 'role' as a weaker male species, and serve you!"" NO FUCKING WAY!"
MGTOW,3bqnx7,scarredlife,8,Thu Jul 2 12:27:12 2015 UTC,"Well, he's actually right. The only unconditional love you'll ever get from a woman is from your own mother. I guess he couldn't bring something else than this to the table :p."

Some trpers assert that what they're doing is improving themselves primarily and that women are attracted to the results of that. I'm sure that's true for some, but for the vast majority of contributors to that sub, it's all about the poonani. Period.  There are several very rational voices on that sub and within trp-land in general. The muppets that are still insecure enough in their own life direction that they feel the need to attempt mockery of mgtow are so transparently defensive one wonders what they fear so much...? I think the answer is they fear they might be wrong to devote so much of their lives to chasing what is very rarely more than just ass (stole ""just ass"" from Paul Proteus ).   I read the FRs (field reports) on that sub when I need a good laugh. There are some very sharp minds wasting a significant amount of energy in working the game, spinning plates and putting up with ridiculous amounts of women's bullshit in order to do so. Good luck to them.   Really, the smarter trpers do not have any contempt for mgtow at all. They respect the choice even if they disagree with it.

I've come to realize the problem is to get the most love and devotion out of a woman you really have to not give a fuck about her.  And it matches my experiences, the more devoted and attached I was to a girl the worse off I was.  It's just so stupid.    However TRP is a pretty bit sub, almost 120K subscribers at the moment.  There's bound to be some dumbasses.  ""MGTOW is code for coward"" is one of the more stupid things on there.  That has gynocentric pussy worship written all over it."

MGTOW,3boyq8,failureToSend,2,Thu Jul 2 13:43:29 2015 UTC,"not even.  Women's tricks & traps are mostly set up by society in the form of power to accuse a man of rape, accuse a man of fathering her child, accuse a man of having income higher than he really has and/or regardless needing to fork it over in divorce and/or child support.  TRP does nothing to address this. Shoves their heads in the sand hard on these most important points of threat.   I've come to realize the problem is to get the most love and devotion out of a woman you really have to not give a fuck about her.   And yet that is more effort than just taking care of yourself by yourself. And much riskier since the woman's in your life to do/say as she pleases to anyone about you, or to you so you're manipulated by lies and/or destruction of property in some cases.  I have nothing to gain by a woman who I don't give a fuck about, and who doesn't care about me, so there's no reason to bother at all if that's the only way to get a woman on her best behaviour to start with and I will not tolerate women on their worst behaviour for even a second.  A woman who lies, argues, wants to sleep around, may, just may get me to think about staying if she fucked me every day and brought her 10 hottest friends for me to fuck as well, every single day, for this exchange to be worth it. Their bitching is that bad, the trade is that far off from worth it."

This is why I would ask; ""how do you define winning?""  If winning is just giving women the tingles, then getting your dick wet, then, well, different strokes for different folks.  The cost of a marriage is perhaps in the 100s of thousands of dollars. The cost of a weekly escort for 20 years is also in the 10s to 100s of thousands of dollars. The cost of condoms and dating-not-dating for random hook-ups, maybe a few thousand dollars. The cost of a good wank now and then - free.  I have a different win condition for my life, but it doesn't concern me that other people have their own win conditions for their lives. Some people consider it a winning move to seek wanton danger.  I wouldn't worry about it too much if I were you. They're just trying to carry out their biological programing. They might occasionally try to shame you into joining them in the pursuit, and put on sententious airs, but, fundamentally, it is the shameful that employ shame as a motivator. Doesn't it strike you as curious that they (knowing nothing about you) will hurl insults (calling you a coward)?  Why do you think they do that?  Let me put it to you another way:  If I thought the most revolting thing in the world was the smell of... sage leaf... I mean, worse than shit... and furthermore, I thought it was the worst, most immoral, thing to have anything to do with that ""foul"" smelling substance (again, worse than shit, in this hypothetical)... then, if I called you a ""sage""... You dirty sage... Then, whose preferences am I indicating? What insecurities, what moral standards of plant growth, etc. am I showing you?  They are saying that shame is effective... against them. They're saying that (like Marty McFly) calling them chicken is how you push their buttons.  Again, don't worry too much about it. They're just doing what they think is best."

Oh and -- based on his submission history -- ""winning the confrontation"" for him seems to be not just getting ONS pussy, but fucking other men's wives (who he claims to know are then also cheating with others as well); there's probably some kind of a weird neurotic hamster ""revenge"" thing going on there (i.e. by being a part of affairs that are screwing up other marriages, internally he feels he's somehow ""rebalancing"" his own cuckolding).  Basically if you cut this guy's dick off (and/or as he ages and has a bit more difficulty with keeping up his notch count); he would probably crumple into a little pile of piss... because his entire being is wrapped up inside of a condom: the dick (or actually ""pussy"") is more or less still running his life, his brain is simply subservient to it.

MGTOW,3boyq8,firstpitchthrow,15,Wed Jul 1 04:27:19 2015 UTC,"Quick thought: I am partial to both communities.  I try to incorporate RP in my life.  My focus is on getting better.  Always be the best version of yourself that you can be.    MGTOW and RP are two different approaches to the same issue.  As Morpheus said ""what is the Matrix?  Control.""  MGTOW and RP are both trying to take control back for men from the matrix.  MGTOW has decided to avoid playing by the same rules as the feminine matrix, RP is trying to find and exploit all the glitches in the system.  Its two ways of attacking the same thing.    Here's my problem: its possible to screw both up.  Its possible to be MGTOW and do absolutely nothing interesting with your life.  To sleep on your couch, eat cheetos and jack off all day.  I consider that life wasted, and I don't believe most of the people on this sub live anything like that.  Go your own way, but remember, now that you have chosen that, you need to know what your own way is.    That's why so many will fight to protect the system.  They do not know what their own way is, and at least in the system, the direction is provided for them.  They aren't ready to take control.  Its scary, its risky, what if people laugh at me?  If you give up control to the system, and your life sucks, you can blame the system, if you take control, and your life sucks, you have no one to blame but you.    Either extreme is dangerous, IMHO.  Being the guy who goes his own way, but is a loser, or being the guy whose pure RP, a degenerate asshole who bangs broads every night.  Either existence is empty, for me at least.  In the one case, your life is dedicated to nothing but sloth, in the other case, your life is dedicated to nothing but empty pussy.  Both cases are the fringe, and non-representative of the whole, but both cases are the brush society paints the entire whole with.  Neither interpretation is fair.    For my life, I try to improve something about myself every single day.  I want to be the man who is the best version of myself.  I want to be the man who is cultured, who lifts and is strong, who saves his money, invests wisely and who can travel when he wants to (still working on that for medical reasons).  I want to be the man who can take women, or leave them alone, but knows he is worth too much to ever make a committment to anyone.  I want to be the guy who reads everything he can find, who finds time to write novels and poetry and to meditate (I love to write and meditation has been an eye opening experience for me).  I want to explore life.  I only get one go at this world, and I want to know as much as I can before it is my turn to check out.    I am not that man I described above yet.  That is who I want to be, and that is who I am working towards.  Make small improvements, each day, make tiny changes each week or each month.  Improve a tiny bit a piece at a time and let it build over time.  That is ""my own way"" to me.  I would not have found my path without the RP, and I would not have known it was a path I could travel with a woman or without (i.e. they're optional) without MGTOW.  I owe something to both, and I see no inherent contradiction."
MGTOW,3boyq8,rKremlin,10,Wed Jul 1 02:10:25 2015 UTC,To classify a life as wasted first you need to define the meaning of life. The cheeto eater is not necessarily a bigger failure than the pussy slayer. Its all context.

MGTOW,3boyq8,SoullessTechnocrat,5,Wed Jul 1 09:13:31 2015 UTC,"Correct, Ser. There's no reason to chase after a chunk of iron pyrite through a minefield; just to prove you're a man."
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,8,Wed Jul 1 09:18:03 2015 UTC,"TRP is about going from a subjugated slave to a slave with benefits. They're still slaves the same bullshit tap of pussy and spend their lives trying to figure out how to get it and control it rather than breaking their dependence on it.  I could get laid if I wanted. I've had ONSs. It's not that fucking hard if you make decent money. You look half decent and have basic social skills and go to a club and bullshit with some idiots and get more physical then make out then sometimes if they don't have conflicts then you go home with them. Big fucking woop. Anyone with some money and a couple spare nights and a little luck could do it. Subjugating women no doubt is a much longer process, but it's so much work to still be ultimately tied to the same source that will fuck you over in creative new ways.  Just cut your dependency. Then if you really want to, then have sex or do what you want, but don't be a fucking slave to it and control your own damn time, wallet and mind."
MGTOW,3boyq8,Panthers86,2,Wed Jul 1 03:41:32 2015 UTC,"Yup. Most of the time I see a clear loss of work-hours, gym-hours or sleep-hours that I'm not willing to lose if I want to go get sex. A few times I've seen where a woman clearly is attractive, into me, she's married and I have a choice to make. I can invite trouble, not directly from her, or I can avoid it. It's been a tough call but for now I've gone with not fucking married women who are hitting on me.  There's lots of fucknuts in TRP who are insanely stupid and would do it every time. That's how you get shot or jumped by 5 guys and they kick your balls until they fall off while holding a gun in your mouth to ensure you don't fight back.  That's the real true facts and TRP refuses to believe this ever."
MGTOW,3boyq8,ThatRedPiller,12,Thu Jul 2 04:48:14 2015 UTC,"I'd say as MGTOWs, we are more courageous than red pillers. We go against society's expectation that we will marry, have kids and devote our lives to a family. Also, we don't go chasing pussy the way men are expected to do. We are more free and independent than red pillers will ever be."
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,0,Wed Jul 1 00:35:10 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, the majority of Red Pillers explicitly state that marriage is almost always a terrible idea."
MGTOW,3boyq8,sardinemanR,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:43:43 2015 UTC,"No, the majority say you can control it all using game.  They are wrong.  They are yet young and have not faced divorce lawyers."
MGTOW,3boyq8,DarkestJ,3,Thu Jul 2 05:05:39 2015 UTC,"just go lift braah, I'm sooooo alllpha and here are my lessons learned.   My opinion of TRP is the mods ruined some really good discussion over there by banning anyone who challenged a mod or vetted contributor. The vetted contributor will complain to mods, rather than debate, and then you're banned."
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,3,Wed Jul 1 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"Haha they try to spin that as being manly.  As if a bunch of computer nerds that talk shit on the internet and then ban anyone that talks back is some new type of manliness. Please, this shit has been going on since the internet started. Sometimes it's even called e-thugging, because it's always some poser nerd that does it.  It's a decent time waster for a little bit, but you won't learn anything and won't develop as a person. It's actually also extremely creepy and unhealthy, and it's obvious most of the posts are fantasy anyway.   For all the crap people state, it's actually not really possible to defeat women consistently at their own game. Especially since there are no continues and you have only one life involved in this game. Eventually you do slip up, and then it's over.  It's dancing with fire, and that fire will burn you eventually. Everyone I know that has run ""game"" and been a PUA winds up married to a post-wall carousel rider in their late-30s. Every last one. Including the ""gurus"" like Mystery and the like."
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,4,Thu Jul 2 07:20:17 2015 UTC,"This TRP overlap is getting ridiculous. Those pussy-worshipping betas are worse than the blue pill guys generally. They use women solely for validation and do everything they can to appease them indirectly while shouting shit like ""HOLD FRAME!!!1!"" and pretending it's something vastly superior than any other PUA degenerates.   You want to spend your time chasing girls, be my guest. As a MGTOW, I give zero fucks about what any man does with his spare time. But when you cross the line into blatant douchebaggery like that ass-clown, you can't expect to not be called out. Recent breeds of TRP'ers are AIDS."
MGTOW,3boyq8,Nihilore,2,Thu Jul 2 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. By all means, game works and I use it but I have to really have a good reason to stick my dick in crazy, and most of them are crazy, to think the orgasm is worth the shit-hassle women cause. Most of them, most of the time, are not worth it. A pussy-addict can never admit this and they are no better than heroin addicts chasing dime-baggies of brown powder.  I used to be one of those too so I guess I can see the comparison with clear vision. They can't."
MGTOW,3boyq8,Specter_1,4,Thu Jul 2 03:45:06 2015 UTC,Ignore TRP.  I stopped reading it several times and I haven't looked in a week or two.  It's run by children and almost 10 entire actual adult men actually write there ever who have real experience with women - how to handle them to get sex and/or to keep them from fucking up your life.  That's a shit-ton of garbage posting and garbage-reading to find just those 10. I'm one of those 10 and refuse to waste more time on the children.

MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,3,Wed Jul 1 06:04:03 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I tend to think there's something to be learned from the entire manosphere spectrum - MGTOW to PUA. Some of it's gold and some of it's dumb. Depends who you are and what you want to do with your life.   ""But mah gayme is so tight, bruh! The bitches all want to gobble my nob!1111 Go approach 10000000 women""   This is the main thing that bothers me about Seddit, RP, and PUA. The zero filter thing. I remember back in college.... there was this one guy who was really handsome and wicked-popular with the girls. He would literally hang out on the lawn in front of the dorm and ""pretend-study."" And every goddamn single girl that walked by he would say, ""Hi! My name is Brian, I don't believe I've met you!"" Three years later my sister says to me, ""Hey do you remember that guy Brian?"" I go: ""Yeah...."" She goes: ""Did you know he's gay?"" I paused and then said, ""No, but.... good!""  Approach-robots - hello, how does this not boldly proclaim polar-opposing-insecurity-compensation??? And to think POIC was a term popularized by a PUA guru who somewhat preaches approach-roboting.  If you're an approach-robot, you're likely transparent as fuck, coming across as a filterless dog, and hell you might even be GAY, as one redditor suspected about Owen Cook (RSD) 7 months ago.  I explore game on the side, and I don't care if I full-on shart my drawers when approaching a beautiful woman. It is what it is - I'm not going to approach a zillion women just to come home with my undies still white. Fuckit. And actually these days I wear black underwear and black pants. I know what I'm doing. Matter of fact, if you don't shart or have a fear of sharting, how in the hell would you be able to measure whether you're approaching the right girl?  As Batman, I insist on being classy and not being a filterless dog."
MGTOW,3boyq8,TheQuestion78,3,Wed Jul 1 06:34:31 2015 UTC,"I consider it removing yourself from danger.  Just like in North Carolina, there are people being bitten by sharks.  A MGTOW'er would look at that fact and merely not go swimming."
MGTOW,3boyq8,sweatynut,3,Wed Jul 1 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is calling someone a coward for not having the same addiction as you, in the RP case it's women.   ""That guys a coward for not smoking, its about smoking cigarettes and courageously facing the danger, coming out on top. "".   It takes a real man to live up to my two pack a day habit."
MGTOW,3boyq8,rKremlin,2,Thu Jul 2 00:07:59 2015 UTC,"and the truth is the other addicts, to gambling, pills, alcohol, all do the same thing.  They are no different in TRP."
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,3,Thu Jul 2 03:45:32 2015 UTC,"Male hamster going on. TRP claims to not put pussy on the pedestal but some TRPers make comments like this which reinforce the fact that they put pussy on a pedestal because they tie their self-worth to how many women they bang or how many plates they spin. MGTOW isn't cowardly it is being like ""hey getting laid isn't that valuable to me so...I'm not playing this game"". Hell, even some MGTOW still get laid because they manage a lifestyle where they can go their own way while having some side action.   Recently I thought of it like this: Let's say a TRPer and a MGTOW are writing a book about their lives. The TRPer's book would highlight his ""playboy"" lifestyle as a major victorious event in his life. Meanwhile, the MGTOW could have as well lived this same sort of lifestyle but this aspect of his life would merely be written off as a small side event to his life while his book's major events would be about some of the awesome things he did in his life (ie traveling, creating a business, going on an adventure, etc.). MGTOW and TRP place their importance on totally different things which is why you get a comment like this from an (at least I think) insecure TRPer."
MGTOW,3boyq8,reasonbeing9,6,Fri Jul 3 22:06:06 2015 UTC,TRP is how to win against the system.  MGTOW is saying fuck the system and finding fulfillment in life.
MGTOW,3boyq8,SoullessTechnocrat,3,Wed Jul 1 04:10:15 2015 UTC,"TRP is Lord Humongous, and MGTOW is Kwai Chang Caine.  They are both kicking ass but for different reasons."
MGTOW,3boyq8,reasonbeing9,3,Wed Jul 1 08:05:43 2015 UTC,"when TRP addresses how to avoid date-rape accusations and divorce-rape nightmares THEN it is how to ""win against the system"". For today it is not.  Today that honour belongs here in /r/mgtow"
MGTOW,3boyq8,SoullessTechnocrat,3,Thu Jul 2 03:53:08 2015 UTC,"Seriously, why are MGTOW, TRP (what the F does that stand for, I take it it has something to do with PUAs) and MRA's fighting with each other?  It's like Catholics and Protestants fighting with each other.  Why don't you all just get over it and work together to make REAL change?   To you point specifically, both MGTOW and TRA have good points.  The way I see it is that MGTOW is basically the FOUNDATION of game: you have to actually not care AT ALL if women like you, etc. and be totally willing to just walk away from all of it. With that as the foundation, why wouldn't you want to learn how to get more out of the interactions that you DO have with women?    Stop worrying about the labels and ""doctrines"" guys, and focus on the main core similarities that all these groups have with each other, when compared with the rest of society."
MGTOW,3boyq8,reasonbeing9,5,Wed Jul 1 01:53:48 2015 UTC,"There can be no real change, as you call it. It's not about engaging in it regardless of how 'protected' you think you are; you're not. Read a bit about information control and framing; and you'll see how any encounter with a  woman can be scripted by her and her friends.  The goal is to not interact with women at all. Maintain control of your situation and move away from the chains of desire. At least; that's what it's about to me. A patent rejection of everything they say.  You can't get women to walk backwards on this; and you certainly won't get any kind of consessions from them like MRA's want. TRP is all about sex and gynocentrism.  The only winning move is not to play."
MGTOW,3boyq8,SoullessTechnocrat,-4,Wed Jul 1 05:15:25 2015 UTC,"You can't get women to walk backwards on this; and you certainly won't get any kind of consessions from them like MRA's want. TRP is all about sex and gynocentrism. The only winning move is not to play.   Wrong.  If you can't get women to ""walk backwards on this"" or give any ""concessions"" then, I hate to sound like a PUA, but then you've got no game.  THAT is what the game is for... for being able to know how to talk to women.  There's no way to say this without sounding like I'm bragging, but I've gotten women to go along with all my MGTOW (or whatever you want to call them) ways... multiple times (meaning with multiple women... it wasn't just ""luck"" it was game).  Not GAME to sleep with them, but Game to get them to go along with my MGTOWish ways.  I've even told them about each other and they don't care.  You just have to have the balls to tell them the real truth and be willing to just ""go your own way"" (remember that part?).  I talk about MGTOW with my ""girlfriend"" and she totally gets why men would feel this way, and she's not just saying it.  She has her own money, her own life, her own friends and her own place.  We only hang out when we want to, and I can literally say to her: ""I don't want to hang out with you for a while"" and she's like ""cool.""  She's not pretending to be OK with it, but she's actually OK with it.  The point of ALL of this is to live your life the way YOU want to.  So what you're telling me, is that you would prefer to never again have sex with a woman you like hanging with sometimes, only when you feel like it, without having to deal with any of the other emotional/social bullshit?  I think you're missing the whole point of all this, but that's just my opinion.  If it makes you happy, keep doing it.  And if you don't consider me a MGTOW, I could give -2 fucks.  Aren't ""labels"" (like MGTOW, PUA, MRA) part of the problem with Gynocentricism to begin with?    I think you're missing the whole point of all this stuff;  To quote Susuki Roshi: you are mistaking the signpost for the thing to which it points."
MGTOW,3boyq8,reasonbeing9,8,Wed Jul 1 07:08:09 2015 UTC,"There aren't any women like that; don't lie. I would prefer a way to live without ever seeing anyone else again; and then bricking up the entrance of my house when I'm ready to die. That's me; I'm a misotheistic nihilist with a hearty contempt for just about everything. But what you're saying is either hollow bragging or a blatant lie.  She's fucking other men whenever she wants; how can you be okay with that?  You're also full of shit. Unless you provide timestamped proof; and even that can be manufactured. Take your anectdotes and keep playing the game, man. When you get burned, come back and cry about it. I may be supportive of you; or I'll remind you that you were asking for it."
MGTOW,3boyq8,SoullessTechnocrat,-4,Wed Jul 1 07:13:18 2015 UTC,"Nope. I'm not lying, but suit yourself.  It takes just as much effort to shut the whole world away as it does to tell the truth about what you want to a woman and see what happens.  What's the worst that's going to happen? She's going to laugh at you and walk away.  But what do you care what she thinks anyway, you're MGTOW right?"
MGTOW,3boyq8,reasonbeing9,3,Wed Jul 1 07:30:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't care. And that's why I don't talk to women; I already know the answer I'm going to get. Why should I try? To validate your choice of continuing to spin the hamster wheel?  I'm one of the few guys who cannot separate sex from love. If we're not going to be marriage 1.0 (Which you can't in this day and age) then I don't want to have sex.  How is that hard to understand? Or do you think that somehow I cannot be sated without sex? Remember folks; sex is not a need. It is a want. You are conditioned by the media to think of it as a need. Needs can be met in a solitary environment. (Food, water, air, shelter) You will die from those not being met; sex is tertiary at best."
MGTOW,3boyq8,SoullessTechnocrat,-3,Wed Jul 1 07:34:40 2015 UTC,"Your like a religious extremist. Like I said, suit yourself. I could care less whether you listen to my advice. But if you REALLY didn't care, you would talk to women sometimes and sometimes not. Your absolutist attitude shows that you do care; it's two sides of the same coin (100% caring and -100% not caring -- if you really didn't care, you'd be at 0%... neutral). Or to quote shakespeare: ""She doth protest to much me thinks."""
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,3,Wed Jul 1 07:41:16 2015 UTC,Why would I? What's to be gained? And moreover; why would any woman want to talk to me?  My absolutist attitude is from my absolutist philosophy. Look at my post history and see how many times I advocate that everything in life is terrible and it should never have been born in the first place.  You're like an extremist as well; trying to bitchslap men who don't want to play your game into playing it. Why do you care if I don't talk to women?  Plus: Why did you use another account to post this; and then delete right after. When I tried to reply from my inbox; it said comment deleted. You started the protesting; not me.
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,-6,Wed Jul 1 07:42:10 2015 UTC,"You sound pretty depressed when you say ""why would any woman want to talk to me?""  I was depressed for 17 years, so I get what it's like to feel like certain things are pointless. But to answer your question: why would any woman want to talk to you?  Because you have intrinsic value man; you're worth isn't based on what you can do -- that's part of the trap MGTOW are trying to avoid.  But anyway, I do get it: life is rough, and pretty shitty at times.  And I definitely can relate to wishing I had never been born before (even told my parents that once).  Anyway, I'll leave it be now, but if you read my first comment, all I was trying to say was: can't we all just get along?  It's hard enough that women don't understand our plight; so why fight with ourselves?  Even though you think I'm a lying douche, it bums me out to hear you express such darkness about your life.  It bums me out because I've truly been there.  This community is here for you bro if you need it."
MGTOW,3boyq8,reasonbeing9,2,Wed Jul 1 07:53:52 2015 UTC,"No; we can't all just get along. This kind of talk is proof of it. You think this is just a simple depression? This is reality; anything else is just delusion masquerading as insight. What intrinsic value? There's nothing good or valuable in this world; especially about me. And of course; you didn't address the other part of my argument. I can't do what you PUA guys do; because I cannot separate the act of sex from the emotion of love. End of story.  And don't try to express the false sympathy. It sickens me more than the rest of life does. You don't care; don't lie. No one does; that's what biology is about. Propagating itself regardless of the outcome; whether it be beneficial or baneful. It's filth, it's terrible; and it never should have been allowed to take place."
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,2,Wed Jul 1 08:00:24 2015 UTC,"I'm quite the opposite. Plenty of women talk to me. And they all say they want to sleep around. All.  A few will hold off a while if the man is sleeping with other women and refuses to let her do so, but it's only a short delay of a few months at most. She will fuck other men. The power to stop her is not in game but in law.  If it's the law she can't do so, like in Saudi Arabia, she will not do so, or she will be jailed, etc.  Nothing else on Earth has that power. Nothing. Your words and attitude are 0 power. She will lie to your face then go fuck another man that night."

MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:54:40 2015 UTC,"I subsribe to both MGTOW and the RedPill because I see both as complimentary. RedPill is first and foremost a sexual strategy. It's to teach men the truth about women and what they need to do to have sex with them. The RedPiller can then move beyond sex, having understood it and master other aspects of his life like his job and other pursuits. One of them can eventually be MGTOW. Afterall, the RedPill is about a man finally trying to understand who he is and what he wants from his life. And some RedPill men can decide that women are a serious hassle and he would logically decide they are not worth getting his dick wet for.  I think if MGTOW is being used by ForeverAlone men or Beta males, it might be a case of cowardice as MGTOW, in my opinion, should come after you've atleast played the Game a bit and understood the true nature of women. Basically, MGTOW is something to go for after you've swallowed the RedPill and not before."
MGTOW,3boyq8,weirdnamedindian,15,Wed Jul 1 05:22:07 2015 UTC,"MGTOW and TRP are not complimentary. They are opposite. TRP advocates getting better at the game, MGTOW advocates not playing. TRP says get into the top 20%, lift, get money, get status. These are all things for pandering to women's wants. Imagine if people adopted TRP en mass... now you have shifted the average up so you need to lift even longer and earn even more whilst women still take the top 20%.  In short form:  Blue pill = pandering to what women say they want  Red pill = pandering to what women really want  MGTOW = not pandering to women"
MGTOW,3boyq8,probablybluepill,10,Wed Jul 1 05:45:57 2015 UTC,Blue pill = pandering to what women say they want  Red pill = pandering to what women really want  MGTOW = not pandering to women   Succinct.
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,2,Wed Jul 1 06:01:26 2015 UTC,"not entirely true: MGTOW says don't play the stupid game that ruins your life, which is marriage, which is supplicating to women, which is letting idiots run you around.  Sex doesn't need to be that way and if you want hassle-free sex there are strategies to get it. MGTOWs are not against getting sex.  Bottom line: if your strategies are good for sex and good for stopping idiots, women or men around them, from fucking with your life, you're red pill and MGTOW is the core of the redpill, not the other way around.  Everything else is blue-pill, including every kind of pussy-chasing where you dance like a monkey for sex even if you get it 10x a day."
MGTOW,3boyq8,mechdemon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:48:43 2015 UTC,"Except that TRP makes it clear to do these things not merely because women desire them but do them because you, as a man will be happier.   Don't lift because it will get you women. Lift because its good for your body and you'll be more confident looking at yourself in the mirror.   Go earn more by getting better at your job or going out of your way to do what you love because you wish to be happier and have enough spending money to do what you want. Not because it will get you women.  TRP doesn't tell men to do anything because it will help them in their pursuit of women. It tells them to do things so they will be happier and more fulfilled. Women will come around after that and when they do, TRP prepares a man to deal with them.  This is where a RedPill man can then choose MGTOW - He can either plate a bunch of women and blast through their shit tests or he can say, since he is already fulfilled and happy, he really doesn't see the point of women and just go MGTOW."
MGTOW,3boyq8,Goldfulgore,5,Wed Jul 1 05:54:24 2015 UTC,"So. That's an nice idea but not really what happens on TRP.  If a guy goes to TRP and says that he's an a technician, then TRP will tell him to be an engineer. If the guy is an engineer, TRP will tell him to be a technical lead or manager. If the guy is happy being a technician, he'll be told that he's blue pill and needs to be in the top 20% to get slay pussy. TRP tells people to lift and earn money and status because of women. The ""for yourself"" is TRP's own version of hamstring."
MGTOW,3boyq8,oldredder,2,Wed Jul 1 16:04:06 2015 UTC,"Except that TRP makes it clear to do these things not merely because women desire them but do them because you, as a man will be happier.    except... they won't be happier.

MGTOW,3bkmjf,tracker2208,36,Tue Jun 30 00:12:00 2015 UTC,"Histrionic personality disorder affects four times as many women as men. Autistic spectrum disorder, formerly known as Asperger's syndrome, is the same way; at least four times as many men are affected than women.   Simon Baron Cohen considers autism to be a manifestation of the extreme male brain, a type of neurology focused on creating and understanding systems. This is characterized by obsessive thinking about narrow topics. Disproportional expertise on topics such as pokemon, batteries, atoms or dinosaurs are found among functioning, autistic males.   I believe that histrionic personality disorder is the gender-flipped, extreme male brain. H.P.D. reflects the expression of stereotypical female traits to the opposite extreme, and is a manifestation of imbalanced female psychology just as autism is a manifestation of imbalanced male psychology.  However, I would rather be autistic because it isn't a manipulative-asshole disease like HPD seems to be.   http://cogsci.bme.hu/~ivady/bscs/read/bc.pdf  http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html  http://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-aspergers-is-an-advantage-2015-4"

From wikipedia:     Cluster B (dramatic, emotional or erratic disorders)   Antisocial personality disorder: a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, lack of empathy, bloated self-image, manipulative and impulsive behavior.   Borderline personality disorder: pervasive pattern of instability in relationships, self-image, identity, behavior and affects often leading to self-harm and impulsivity.   Histrionic personality disorder: pervasive pattern of attention-seeking behavior and excessive emotions.   Narcissistic personality disorder: a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and a lack of empathy.    Some degree of comorbidity between the disorders in this group is not uncommon."

MGTOW,3bkmjf,thrownaway_MGTOW,3,Fri Jul 3 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"H.P.D. reflects the expression of stereotypical female traits to the opposite extreme   I was going to post that the list of traits sounds like it could almost apply to the majority of women these days.    Some women might not display all of those traits quite at the extremes as presented on the list -- there are in fact ""quiet"" women who do not need to engage in drama or be the center of attention very often, much less continuously -- but even they certainly do seem to engage in those behaviors from time to time, or to a certain extent (i.e. and of course some of it would be subjective, per example I am certain there would be vastly differing views on how ""Inappropriately seductive appearance"" is exactly defined, and in what context, etc).  Yet I know -- and to my way this confirms it anecdotally -- that personally in my life one of the BIG benefits of minimizing the number and extent of female presence in it -- is that the ""dramatics"" (i.e. the histrionics, the ""emergencies"" and various over-the-top emotional displays, etc) have all likewise been significantly minimized (versus say what life USED to be like when I was in LTR's and/or working among & around a host of women) -- and what little ""drama"" is present around me these days, well invariably (directly or indirectly) it has a woman as a primary, if not THE root cause somewhere or another; and generally as a result of some deception and/or manipulation they have engaged in (the whole spectrum).    EDIT: BTW, this -- claiming that one is acting ""Aspergery"" etc. -- is also something that I have seen any number of women attempt to use to try to SHAME men; which when it comes down to it is an accusation that one is being logical/rational, and often trying to get to the root of a problem to ""fix"" and/or resolve it; rather than being ""supportive"" of the emotional dramatics & histrionics (in other words, not allowing or enabling the female manipulation, but rather countering it and undermining it).  They seem to think that this is something men would be ""ashamed"" of, or insulted by.   LOL."
MGTOW,3bkmjf,SoullessTechnocrat,3,Wed Jul 1 06:22:04 2015 UTC,"http://cogsci.bme.hu/~ivady/bscs/read/bc.pdf   I know I've probably read that article before (certainly SB Cohen's work is familiar to me), but something relatively new just struck me, or at least it sticks out more prominently to me given the context of this thread.  To wit, from the linked piece above, the opening sentences:    ‘Empathising’ is the drive to identify another person’s emotions and thoughts, and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion. Empathising allows you to predict a person’s behaviour, and to care about how others feel. In this article, I review evidence that on average, females spontaneously empathise to a greater degree than do males. [...snip]    Now what just struck me is also the ""trait"" that is left off of the list above, but is present in the descriptive of HPD on wikipedia, to wit:    Associated features include egocentrism, self-indulgence, continuous longing for appreciation, and persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own needs.    Combine those two things:  a ""drive to IDENTIFY another person's emotions"", to ""predict a person's behavior"" -- with: ""persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own needs."" -- and what do you get?  Well, you get the typical female.  You can even add in another part of the equation; what is it that is probably THE incessant complaint women have about men? Answer: that they don't show (i.e. reveal) their ""emotions"".  Now why would that be a problem? Well, it's definitely a problem in the context of trying to MANIPULATE someone else -- if you can't identify (see) their emotions, then you're likely to screw up the attempt at manipulation, aren't you.  Ergo the complaint that women have about men not ""emoting"", is really NOT about ""connecting"" with men in terms of intimacy (as RP notes that's the ""beta"" mistake) -- it's largely yet another self-centered thing (at least with the more ""histrionic"" women), they WANT those ""emotions"" for the self-centered purpose of manipulation in order to achieve THEIR needs (wants).    EDIT: Also, slightly off-topic, but I also note that relative to another recent thread here on /r/MGTOW -- the one about women claiming THEY ""invented/created agriculture"" -- well again, as I noted in my comment there, that simply doesn't make any sense: agriculture (whether it is grain & veg planting and/or the wider definition including animal husbandry) is most definitely a ""system"", indeed several systems in fact, complex and intertwining (not only seasons in terms of the earth's cycles, but the plant and animal cycles, rain vs drought, etc).  I simply cannot imagine women engaging in the kind of ""focus/obsession"" that would be necessary to learn & define & refine those ""systems"" -- it makes far more sense that males, and especially ""asperger"" type males, would be the ones doing that.  And quite frankly there is little (virtually nothing really) about either plants OR animals that has anything to do with ""nurture"", nor ""emotions"" and none of it is exactly subject to or even really aware of, much less cares about being ""manipulated"" in the sense of emotions -- certain animals do indeed like to be petted and/or groomed, but it's the PHYSICAL act that they care about, and arguably even that is a far distant secondary thing (something they initially endure rather than seek out) to the provisions of food and/or shelter (that's especially true of livestock)."

Pretty much everything most men do is to attract a woman. Men take jobs that are harder work because women will find you more attractive. Men get houses that are bigger than they need and in pricier neighbourhoods because women will find you more attractive. Men buy expensive clothes for the same reason. And expensive cars. As Karen Straughan very eloquently said, ""men acquire power to get sex, but women use sex to acquire power. Which makes you wonder who really is the power-hungry sex"".  Now if you want any of the above things because they will make you happy then the right thing to do is pursue them.

(Yes, in the short term a 6 figure MGTOW tax RATE may be higher than some 6 figure married dude who has wife + kids, and thus more ""deductions""... but that's ""short term"", the LONG term is a different story.)    See, you're assuming that the ""6 figure"" MGTOW's are intending on working and earning that their entire lives (i.e. or at least to the typical ""retirement age"" of ~65 yrs old).  While I can't speak for everyone, I know that wasn't true for me; and from comments made by a lot of other guys in this forum, they don't seem to be planning on slaving away for 40+ years either -- most of them seem to be ""working a plan"" similar to what I have done.    In no small part by being MGTOW, I was able to -- and this was essentially ""according to plan"" -- spend a little over a decade making pretty respectably salary, but then the key was that I didn't SPEND much of it, and was able to instead SAVE & INVEST a lot of my earnings (as opposed to say the poor bastard in linked thread above, where his wifey was squandering everything the guy made and more {on god only knows what} ... and where even though he is ""free"" from her, he's still handing her a wad of cash every month for another decade+, while apparently carrying a boatload of debt that will likely take a couple of more decades for him to work off).  In addition -- again in no small part by being MGTOW -- I was able to pay off all my debts (including a home mortgage in ~8 years) and then transitioned to a ""semi-retired"" status at age 41~42 (by ""semi-retired"" I mean working VERY little during the decade since, just some minimal consulting work, a few projects that interest AND pay me a decent rate per hour ... as well as time spent managing my investments, etc.)  End result of that is that currently, I make VERY little (and NEED even less) in terms of wage-income that is subject to things like FICA payroll taxes, and even my overall income tax exposure is really minimal as well (indeed, almost trivial most years: capital gains rates -- especially the long term CG rates -- being significantly lower than rates on regular ""earned"" income).   Yet in many ways, though it is very frugal in dollars, nevertheless I live a REALLY comfortable life... some would even call it ""luxurious"" in terms of amenities, swimming, golfing, boating, etc (the house is modest, but since I'm alone... well I probably have more square footage per person than people who live in 4,000+ sqft mansions).   Plus, given the strategic way & place I purchased a home, even my property taxes are relatively low (compared to most people in my state/region) -- so I'm not actually contributing much to the local school system either (and given the land that I have, and the way certain tax credits work... I get about 1/2 of what I pay to the county refunded back to me from the state).  So to me it's not so much attempting to ""starve the beast"" as to do what I can to minimize it's negative impact & burden on ME personally -- meaning a very (and I do mean VERY) minimal amount of my annual ""work"" (probably less than 40 hours worth) ends up going to the government in taxes (and in terms of ""my share"" it probably only covers things like roads & other basic infrastructure/administration) -- part of what that does is shift the remainder of the burden (the part I have ""shrugged off"" if you will) then BACK onto other people who DO ""support"" the current system in its entirety (i.e. all the married folks, any/all wage earners, etc)."

MGTOW,3bos7a,oldredder,3,Thu Jul 2 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"MGTOW is not about activism. It's about having your own identity and being happy in it. There are people who stop by here for a rant, they've often been worked over by the system so we can feel sympathetic, but in the long run I'm more into seeing men make themselves a good life than get all political. I don't really care if your thing is Renaissance Literature, Base Jumping or even some aspect of your job but just do it and do it in a way you find satisfying.

MGTOW,3bos7a,nigelh,2,Wed Jul 1 11:57:06 2015 UTC,"no, MGTOW is about passive activism - keeping yourself unentangled with as much of society's bullshit as possible, in balance, without hurting yourself by method of extraction OR by tolerance of the bullshit in the Matrix.  You can't make a good life for yourself by not taking an activist position - the alternative is slavery. There's no 3rd option."
MGTOW,3bos7a,oldredder,0,Thu Jul 2 04:41:21 2015 UTC,No. You're letting somebody else drag you into their game. You go and be an activist if that's your 'own way'. Me? I've got a hang glider here that won't fly itself.
MGTOW,3bos7a,nigelh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:58:52 2015 UTC,No. I am doing the opposite. Society is the game. Extraction is anti-game. I'm extracted.  The extraction IS the activism. The very act of refusing to comply is high-treason in the eyes of those still enslaved to the Matrix.
MGTOW,3bos7a,oldredder,3,Fri Jul 3 03:53:43 2015 UTC,"You may not have noticed, but there IS a penalty for not filing/paying taxes. It's pretty stiff, too. Time spent in Club Fed just won't make your day.  Now, most guys are employees so not paying is not possible anyway. You get it withheld from your check.   Independent contractors-- like me-- don't get it withheld, I have to  write a check 4 times a year for estimated taxes. But, there's still 1099 paperwork sent in by somebody else, it tells the total of the settlement checks, so I can't slip under the radar-- sooner or later the IRS will start snooping. If I don't file and pay--- I'm going to ""Club Fed"" for several years.  Now, you can try not filing and paying if you want to-- but don't say you ain't been warned."
MGTOW,3bos7a,pirate6728,4,Wed Jul 1 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"MGTOW basically means pursuing selfish interests (""your own way""). It is a misconception that selfishness is necessarily incompatible with society or civilization/co-existence in general. Most people value others to some extent, and those values are thus a part of your selfish goals. Even if you did not particularly value others, there is purely selfish value in co-operative co-existence: playing non-zero-sum games benefits everybody on a long enough timeline --- even if you lose 10, if the total value to all of humanity is 5000, that does tend to come back to you somehow, especially when everyone else is taking a similar approach. It's how a species reaches above and beyond, and mutually beneficial non-zero-sum games are the basis of trade (i.e. gaining 50, losing 40, with the opponent say... gaining 70, losing 30. Meaning their 30 abstract units of value are worth 50 to you, and your 40 are worth 70 to them --- there's a net gain for both parties).  The jist here is that most MGTOW should care deeply about the continued existence of society and civilization, that seeing it burn is typically a net negative for everyone involved. Life on the savannah was not better than life in a... admittedly somewhat exploitative, but still mostly civilized society.  You might claim that a single country or a few burning down is not the end of civilization... and you'd be right, but it still does not seem rational to me to want to see, say, the United States of America collapse. The world loses a lot of value and potential if that happens, and some of that value is almost certainly relevant to your own quality of life.   Then again, I don't actually know shit about what such a future would be bring. Maybe it would be better, but I certainly don't think most people advocating such a thing have done any serious calculations about the effects of it. It's far more likely that they're just throwing their hands up in the air: resolving to have a modicum of fun for the next few decades and then dying when/if it all goes to hell. I'd say it's likely that there are possible futures that would be better than that, that giving up is not the best possible answer here.  It seems so dramatic and defeatist, doesn't it? The world is not quite such a shit place that there is no hope whatsoever. Even stuff like the mounting national debt might not be all that fatal --- someone's going to eat shit because of it, but it's not necessarily the end of the world. It should be survivable.  We probably can make for a better world relatively easily, even when living selfish lives, as long as we don't buy into this bullshit narrative that everything is already over and now we just ride it to the ground and perish. For all my love of Atlas Shrugged, I don't think holding the world on your shoulders is necessarily all that hard nor all that painful --- we probably do need to somehow fix the problem of people who add far too much weight --- the people who actively work against mutually beneficial co-existence in favor of grossly excessive parasitism,  but we shouldn't give up on, you know, the world. We kind of need it. We can probably do away with the exploitation part without doing away with the... society part."

But there are many more female churchians who twist religion to some warped new form that benefits them, and then demand men fall into line for it.  Here are the two things pretty much every real religion requires:  1) Chastity before marriage (i.e., both men and women can ONLY have sex IN marriage, not before and outside of it, and for most strictly speaking even DATING or ANY sexual contact (kissing, hand holding) is PROHIBITED!!!!); and  2) Women must SUBMIT to their husbands! A husband's word is LAW!  Now you tell me. How many women follow those two rules? There is no child support or alimony in religion either, if a wife divorces a husband, the CHILDREN GO TO HIM and the ex-wife gets NOTHING.   Do you see Western women signing up for these rules? OF COURSE NOT!!!!  America USED to follow religious principles! Women screamed that it was a ""patriarchy"" and ""misogynist"" and just CHANGED all of society. And if you attend most any modern church today, the message is nothing but female empowerment!  Scripture is IGNORED or spun into a female dominant view! They don't even want to use ""He"" to refer to the Lord!  It is a JOKE to claim women are religious! And this joke is probably the biggest peeve of mine. Women destroyed religion in the West, just as they destroyed everything else. Don't just accept their new definition."

And it is a feminist priority:  http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/uk-students-union-passes-policy-stop-white-gay-men-acting-black-women250315  On a side note, I think liberalism in general is showing its fascist core by its increasing marginalisation of gays. In the oppression hierarchy, gays are always least deserving of support according to liberals. Straight women or gay men? Women win. Islam or homosexuality? Islam wins. Liberals allow gays to get married, but in return they expect unwavering support on every single one of their batshit crazy ideas about tax, gender, immigration, you name it. Gays are only really being used as tools to advance a greater agenda that does NOT care about the safety and happiness of gay men. I just hope more of them wake up and see it."

MGTOW,3bjp6n,thrownaway_MGTOW,5,Mon Jun 29 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"Like many pieces of such bullshit, it has become accepted as ""true"" mainly by repetition... and mostly only by relatively recent (i.e. 20th century) authors coming from psychological/sociological (and so called ""anthropological"") biases, all of which are (at best) ""soft"" sciences, and at worst ""pseudo-sciences"" (of what are now known as ""normative science"" -- i.e. theory that is subservient to political ideology, in part because it is dependent upon the latter for financial support, making it akin to a ""court historian"" that creates a biased history flattering to a monarch).    In other words emphatically NOT ""archaeologists"".    In fact, AFAIK virtually all of what archaeology HAS found -- including mainly things around the agriculture of early cities: irrigation, terracing, etc (all fairly large scale projects), as well as the types of work involved, including everything from  dredging canals and irrigation ditches, to piling up large rocks and dirt, and later on felling trees, clearing land and plowing, etc -- makes it rather highly unlikely that women were the inventors or drivers of such, certainly not the kind of agriculture that created ""civilization"".   And from the conceptual point of view, while modern women (and their apologists) like to posit that farming is all about feminine ""nurturing"" of crops (as if plants like or need to be ""petted"" and chatted to), rather than what they characterize as the ""brutality"" of hunting...  Well there is really nothing in nature that shows any such thing, in fact what is seen is the opposite -- in other mammalian groups (say the large cats) the females are just as often the ""hunters"" as the males, and show an equal if not greater propensity to ""violence"", both same species AND intespecies (and arguably the same is true in humans if one actually looks at and filters through the BS in the data).  By contrast, there is also little -- in fact virtually nothing -- to suggest that the majority of women ever had (much less had and then abandoned or lost) the kind of abstract, logical & space-relation thinking skills that would have been necessary for what we mentioned before: the conceptualization of, much less the trial and error building & construction of increasingly complex irrigation systems, terracing, fencing of animals, etc.  Whereas in terms of historical record at least, these seem to have always been the attributes mainly if not exclusively associated with males (or at least a subset of males).    I remember also having read (years ago -- before the internet -- and I wish I could recall what book it was) some author who asserted that from his observaions -- even at relatively very young ages, when left entirely to themselves he saw distinct differences in how children play in the ""wild"" environment from which he drew conclusions:    boys tended to like to play in and around water, most especially taking pride in creating & demolishing little ""dams"" to block and then control small streams & flows of water (i.e. the fundamentals of irrigation, and thus of controlled/managed farming);  meanwhile the little girls seem almost entirely uninterested in that, and instead prefered to play with picking flowers & grasses, and then twisting & subsequently braiding them into various adornments, etc. (in essence the rudiments of weaving, basket-making, and so on).   The author believed that was a rather convincing foundational observation, and that it formed the basis for a theory that there is a distinct difference in each gender's approach to the ""wild"" -- each indeed being necessary part of ""technology"" for some farming civilization, and in fact complimentary to each other -- but with the former (male) activity being of primary importance.    Again I have tried (and failed) several times to find that book again -- and in all honesty I'm not even certain it was a book, it could have been some article in an old pre-WWII ""Popular Mechanics"" or even ""Boys Life"" type magazine (my father had whole stacks of those from the 1920's & 30's -- alas long since mildewed, deteriorated and thrown out -- they were falling apart already when I was a child) -- or even something I ran across later in the 1970's, some glossy thing either in Nat Geo or possibly even something like OMNI (I recall color illustrations, but whether they were full color, or if I only imagined that part)... who knows."

MGTOW,3bjp6n,thrownaway_MGTOW,5,Tue Jun 30 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"Please tell me there are not teaching this in schools.   Of course they are.  In fact they began teaching this kind of thing decades ago (there were even ""hints"" of it when I was a kid in the 1970's already).  Here's the latest edition of this kind of thing: http://equalvisibilityeverywhere.org/blog/womens-history-month-introduction/  See -- according to the post-modern neo-feminist version of re-imagined matriarchal prehistory -- MEN (those nasty violent creatures) were off hunting big species to extinction just because they liked killing things (and/or because God told them to or something, depends on whether they want to pander & insert the atheism++ bit in there) ... so women had to suddenly/magically channel the spirit of mother Gaia, and invent everything about ""civilization"" -- that's right, WOMEN (who were apparently all ""amazon"" like beefy critters) started not only breeding & planting grain & making bread (apparently inventing fire somewhere in there) as well as (somehow) domesticating animals, they also dug irrigation ditches, cleared forests, built fences, invented plows, and so on -- then (this part they don't talk about) apparently the women somehow ""tricked"" men into doing ALL of those things for them, so they could then move back inside and onto more ""important"" things... like flower arranging and makeup (and of course whine about how ""oppressed"" they were by the patriarchy)."

It was the evil menz who tricked the wymyn into doing housework and being barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. If not for the menz they'd be roaming the farms frolicking among the chickens and the ducklings and the baby cows on the farm.  Then in the twentieth century the wymyn heroically freed themselves."

And even if they went into the woods, well the sheer prettiness of the woman herself, plus her charming voice singing and her little ""boo hoo"" tears... well, all of those little doe eyed forest aminals would gather around give her... awwww isn't that SOOO CUTE... lots and lots of huggsies & widdle smoochy kisses... you know just like in this Disney documentary film.    Seriously, it seems that a massive number of women people (because it is not just women) actually seem to think that their ridiculous ""romanticized"" view of nature -- that it's all one big huge petting zoo, and that farm animals (and wild animals) are really all just cute & cuddly critters that exist solely to be given hugs by little girls and so on -- they actually think that is reality, and that the ONLY thing that ever ""despoils"" it is some hunter dude with a gun.  Oh, they probably intellectually know that animals aren't JUST like the ""cute & cuddly"" stuffed toys they have sitting on their bed -- after all these days they DO make a few more realistic ""documentaries"" about nature/wild animals, and its almost impossible NOT have to have seen at least portions of those. But I don't think that the REALITY actually sinks into the depths of their understanding.  For people who grew up in the modern affluent urban & suburban environments, there are just too many ""fantasy"" layers that have been laid down during the formative years  and not only via bullshit like Disney's ""Snow White"" either -- nor Disney + the absurdities of Dr. Seuss & Sesame Street, etc -- no it's just about everything, including the ways that even the minimal contact most of them end up having with actual animals (in zoos or even field trips to some ""petting farm"") they don't see the REAL ""reality"" of things.  And then of course if/when they ever are (all too briefly) given the opposite biased view -- via some lefty ""exposure"" video of select excerpts shot at a slaughterhouse, etc -- they lose their shit."
MGTOW,3bjp6n,User-31f64a4e,7,Tue Jun 30 14:09:43 2015 UTC,"Aside from agriculture causing food surpluses that led to the possibility of slavery, taxes and the state; aside from agriculture being the first step of our descent into a sedentary lifestyle ...  How is this knowable? Does it apply to all crops at all times? How about animal husbandry - did women tame the wolves into dogs, Przewalski's horse into something we could ride and Aurochs into cows? Are women particularly brave with wild animals?  Is it really likely that in spite of lesser intellect, women were the ones who did the pattern recognition that led to agriculture? They were the ones who experimented, while I guess the boys focused on their feels?    The fact is that gathering and hunting both involve things, not other people. The female preoccupation with social activity and children does not magically cross over to growing food. Sure, women are more in to house plants - on account of their nesting instincts. Nothing to do with agriculture.  Who do you think was the first person to take a flyer on eating some new plant a tribe found when they migrated somewhere new? An expendable male, or a woman whose reproductive fecundity was required for tribal survival? Who mucked about with einkorn and teocine until they found ways to make them edible, and eatable?    Which is easier - modern agriculture where you sit your ass in a John Deere and let it do the work, or the very first agriculture, before tools were even invented to make it easier? Sure, a woman can drive a modern tractor that steers itself by GPS and controls it's own actions by computer. But making a furrow is hard using a team and a plow ... how about before either of those even existed? Think some good old fashioned male elbow grease came in to it?    Really, these feminist theoreticians are so breathtakingly stupid and so blinded by ideology ... that there's no point in even engaging them."

MGTOW,3bnr2o,oldredder,0,Thu Jul 2 07:42:37 2015 UTC,"The problem MGTOW faces now, is that even you mind your own business they will still come after you.    The FemaNazis want to make “Yes means yes” the Federal law to “protect” all women not just college women. So suppose it is the law of the land. Imagine you hear a knock on the door. It’s the cops. They ask you where you were Tuesday night. You say you were watching a move on TV. The cops ask you, can anyone corroborate your story? You can’t. You ask, “What is this all about?” The cops say the women across the street says you had sex with her but she did not agree to it. With “Yes means yes” a woman can lie about having sex and you have no way of proving that you did not do it.   So going your own way will not help you. Minding your own business and keeping to yourself will not protect you from a country run by feminist.   MGTOW made perfect sense in the past. You keep you noise clean, stay out of trouble, mind your own business and everything will be alright. Not anymore. The above is but one example. Now government is going you out of to attack men. Just recently two men were arrested because their knees were too far apart on the subway. They were minding their own business, what did it get them.  Now I feel like a guy walking down the street. People leave me alone, I will leave people alone. Same goes with government. If the government leaves me alone, I'll leave the government alone. But if the government fucks with me, you better believe I am fighting back. I won't throw the first punch, but I will be damn sure to throw the last punch.  What can we do? You don't have to knock yourself out. Leave that to the MRAs. They are up for a fight. Vote, write the congressman and senator.

I didn't have any black friends, I liked nothing about black culture, and I thought black women were ugly except maybe the light skin ones.  Then when I turned 18 I met this black girl at the blackjack table, maybe the blackest person I'd ever scene at that time.  I only knew her for that hour or so, but she completely changed how I thought.  She was pretty, smart, funny, had a nice accent, acted real feminine, I was very attracted to her.  Couldn't get her out of my mind for a couple days.  I forget what country she was from, but she represented the best of the society she was from.  I realized that it wasn't black people I didn't like, it was specific black people, and every type of race had women that were beautiful.

MGTOW,3bjh9m,ValleyFever101,9,Tue Jun 30 04:02:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how things are in England, but in America, the attitude you describe also might depend on where you are, whether it's in a big city, a small town, or a middle class suburb.    In lower-income areas, life is rougher, the people are meaner, and most people just adopt a certain ""attitude.""  Race doesn't make much of a difference, since lower-income whites can become meaner than junkyard dogs.  And unlike England, a significant portion of our population goes around armed, so that can always add some potential excitement to any random confrontation.   My experience is that (in general) black women might put up a tougher front when you first meet them, probably because they have to put up with a ton of more shit than white women generally do.  But once you get to know them, they're not so bad.    One thing I have observed in my dealings with women of all races, more often than not, if you treat a black woman with decency and respect, they will reciprocate.  They do have a certain sense of fairness that seems rarer among women of other races - who, if they're going to treat you like shit will do so no matter how you treat them.    I knew a guy who was a meter reader in LA, where he had to visit homes in all kinds of diverse neighborhoods.  He said that the friendliest people he encountered were mostly the black women - and they usually offered lemonade or something to eat.

MGTOW,3bjh9m,moosevice_dot_com,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:38:33 2015 UTC,"You'll find that men tend to yield to women in British and American cultures, which allows women to be arrogant without consequence.  It's my belief the perception difference stems from World War 2, due to Russian male casualties in the war, Russia's male to female ratio heavily 'favours' men, meaning women have to compete to get the attention of a male and keep him. This allows room for male values to dominate what is socially acceptable, and despite criticism of Russia, it actually does lead to a more rational society, such as your example of being called out for being stupid.  Where in British and American cultures, men generally compete to get attention of women, which leads to a different set of female values to be held socially acceptable (and why MGTOW exists).  A clear example of this in Russia a man doesn't have to pay support to a woman or his child if he decides to leave the family. This is the complete opposite to that in British and American cultures.  This is not to say Russian women are NAWALT, infact once they feel secure in their relationship they return to AWALT behaviours.   As for Black population, it's not directly because they are Black, but their history that leads them to, generally speaking, populate lower classes of society, and as such, be poor and uneducated. Which results in less tact and more belligerent behaviour. As /u/TekkomanKingz said this is not a colour problem."

MGTOW,3bhwmi,SoullessTechnocrat,8,Mon Jun 29 11:08:17 2015 UTC,"Not much actually. It'll be more like hors-d'oeuvres (or a complimentary small ""dessert"") than a meal.  The number of homosexuals is (in reality) probably only about 1% to 2% of the population; but even the HIGHEST estimates I have ever heard are that they might constitute ~10% of the population.  Even IF you assume that they will marry at anything NEAR the rate of the rest of the population, AND you accept that ~10% figure... well still you're talking about (over the long term) an increase of about 10%. (EDIT: I should clarify that the ~10% is the highest range based on ""data"" -- current estimates from which are towards the low end the 1% to 2% range -- the public perception/belief however {heavily influence by incessant propaganda, media characterizations, etc} is another matter entirely -- and as recent Gallup data has shown that latter is entirely out of proportion to reality; people ""see"" gays everywhere, just as they ""see"" {and panic over} ""pedophiles"" behind every bush, etc.)  But -- long term -- that seems highly dubious; both because they really AREN'T 10% of the population (again, try more like 1% to 2%, maybe 3% to 4% if you include all of the self identified ""bisexuals"" or ""questioning/confused"" and add in the rest of the LGTBQBBQ collection) -- and because the vast majority of them actually have ZERO interest in getting ""married"".  What we have been and will be seeing (now and in recent years whenever a state has ""legalized"" it) is a ""pent-up"" demand, a sort of bursting of a flood gate (from what is actually a very tiny reservoir) -- and it is also a sort of ""forbidden fruit"" -- something they were denied and so many of them claimed (and probably even convinced themselves) that they really needed/wanted; and in some cases (probably many) there was possibly even a sense of urgency that when a given state legalized it, well it might be a ""window"" of opportunity that could just as easily close... can you say ""limited time offer""?  But... now that it has been ""legitimized"" and purportedly across the board, I think very quickly the ""flood"" will dissipate, and quite frankly it will decrease down to less than a trickle in fairly short order.  So... as a result... yes there will probably be a slight ""uptick"" in the divorce business over the next few years -- possibly even an increase akin to that 10% we talked about (given the temporary flurry of gay weddings).  But I really rather doubt that it's going to be some great ""boon"" to the divorce industry; for the simple reason that the things which drag out most divorce proceedings are: 1) Custody of Children (moreover only the TRUE biological children of BOTH married people, something that cannot factually exist with either ""gay male"" or ""lesbian female"" couples), and 2) the gender disparity and the idea that females (being ""weaker"" and having ""less earning potential"": myths that persist in the legal world despite the fact that feminism denies the first, and there is plenty of evidence to the contrary for the second -- again this is something that pretty much by definition doesn't/cannot exist in same-sex divorce cases).  Ergo most of those divorces will really just come down to a ""division of marital assets"" and while not a cake-walk, that's generally something that is far easier to arrive at some calculation/compromise when it is sans the emotional aspect of children and/or gender difference.  There is really just no ""hook"" for the divorce industry to really hang it's proverbial hat onto and make inordinate profits from."
MGTOW,3bhwmi,thrownaway_MGTOW,3,Mon Jun 29 11:23:53 2015 UTC,"When you talk about there being very little potential to drag out gay divorces I could not disagree more, precisely because their child relationships are, to put it politely, unusual.  Say two lesbians get a sperm donor and have a child. After seven years, they get a divorce. The lesbian who gave birth to the child wants to cut the other woman out of both her life and the child's life, but the other woman disagrees. What the hell happens in court? This is going to happen a lot.  Similar situation with men. A lesbian friend of mine recently asked if I would consider being a sperm donor if she ever wanted to have children with another woman. Apparently I could ""still be in the child's life"" but it would not be my child. Of course I said no because it would obviously actually be my child whatever I'd agreed to beforehand, and I would be deeply uncomfortable with that for all kinds of reasons. But apparently it's not uncommon for gay men to give their sperm to lesbians, presumably because some people are so short-sighted they can't see how they'll feel when the child is born. There are endless court cases to be had in situations like these too."

This is going to happen a lot.   Well I suppose it depends on what you mean by ""a lot"".  A significant portion -- if not the overwhelming majority -- of the many ""gay and/or lesbian marriages"" that one is seeing* definitely seem to be relatively OLDER couples. The number of YOUNGER gays and lesbian getting ""married"" well they appear* to be relatively few and far between, even simply as a percentage of the gay marriages in total.  Which of course makes sense. Young people these days generally have little reason TO get married, period -- whatever benefits are present with formal, legal marriage tend to be mainly as one ages.  The point being... that as I noted above, to begin with the gay community as a whole (as a percentage of the population) is relatively tiny; the fraction that want to get ""married"" is even smaller, and the subset of those who do get married and also have children is still smaller yet... and then it is only from THAT fraction of a fraction of fraction that you have the subset who decide to both get divorced AND have some ""duke it out"" custody battle.  Will there be such cases? No doubt. Will they be LARGE in number?  I highly doubt it -- more like a random, sporadic blip on the radar, versus the ""storm"" of hetero child custody battles.  In other words if some attorney wants to try to make a living off of lesbian (or even lesbian AND gay male) divorce child custody battles... well, they'll probably starve.    * Yes this is all ""anecdotal"" -- what I'm seeing on news stories and such -- possibly the news media are being biased and purposefully ""selecting"" the older people as ""poster couples""; it would be interesting to see the data, but even though I have searched for some (granted not exhaustively) I have yet to run into anything that seems dispositive."

Yes, admittedly, it's based upon the typical bias: woman handle their emotions better and that's ""good""; whereas men suppress their emotions and that's ""bad.""  there's a kernal of truth to that claim - - suppressed emoins (or even the inability to understand one's emotions) can have terrible effects.  Sometimes men have to control their emotions in order to manage the situation (accidents, emergencies, warfare, etc.), and it may be essential to maintain a ""cool head"" until the situation is resolved...we don't want our police officers or firefighters to become blubbering nitwits in the midst of an emergency due to their ""feelings.""  But having a useful and productive outlet to recognize those feelings and to deal with them in a positive way, is essential.   You can't cure PTSD with alcohol or drugs, and being unable to deal with horror/guilt/shame/whatever can lead to depression, despair and suicide.  Men need to help themselves and to help other men.  Women have the greatest union ever created: even when one of them commits horrible acts, she stills gets sympathy rather than universal condemnation.  We men could learn a lot from that attitude.  Instead of sneering, trying to ridicule and shame other men for their choices in life, we could understand and empathize, even if we disagree with their actions (e.g., feminized actions, hipsterism, avoiding ""manly"" activites).  One of my (female) colleagues made a snotty comment about Bruce/Kaitlyn Jenner not being a ""real woman,"" to which I responded: ""I think Jenner will be the kindest woman in the U.S., since she's seen how awful most women treat men.""

The reason so many men are motioning away from women is not because they don't want sex, its because they've been priced out of it and men honestly would suffer the decimation of sex/marraige/LTRs if they had the economy too do so. How is the economy jail breaking men away from women? The mass move to put women into the working economy means many men have been displaced in the process and have dropped out of work force participation(not looking for employment), and many women earn more then men which means the Hypergamy of a majority of women don't see men as ""men""(utilities).

With only one mouth to feed or clothe (or shelter, entertain, educate, equip, etc) and then with the ability to locate nearly anywhere and in a relatively modest (and therefore cheap) structure -- at the same time gaining a LOT more ""space"" for himself (the entire home, etc, rather than being relegated to some ""man cave"") -- well the equation from a financial perspective simply makes life a LOT easier."

Worse, a significant number of the jobs that women now occupy -- which were arguably created for women by the political system and various policies -- are in fact part of a bureaucratic system that places significant restrictions on many businesses, further inhibits economic development and in end consequence has been part of what has driven a lot of the more productive 9and previously higher paying) jobs overseas (where not only is skilled labor significantly cheaper, but where there are far fewer inhibitions to expansion, and where quite frankly the government is often actually facilitating and inviting development with fully open arms, with financing, providing of new infrastructure, etc -- quite the opposite of the system in the ""feminist"" western nations)."

Women have it differently - they act like children and men (usually blue pill men, but whatever) will forgive them for it. The result is the message women get - and they get this very early on - is that they are not their feelings.  But the reality is you either neither your thoughts or your feelings.

Your ""brain"" is actually several different systems, some regions that do care about ""higher order"" things and thus do indeed ""give a fuck"", and other regions that are far more rudimentary, are entirely oblivious to anything ""higher order"" and operate in what is almost a ""mindless"" fashion.  Technically speaking it is more your ""dick"" (and/or the more base hormonal driven aspects of your central nervous system) that are primed and programmed to get you to act to reproduce (and often regardless of or even contrary to what may be your best interests long term) and which then (at least as far as our current theoretical understanding of the mechanisms within the brain operate) attempt to ""trick"" the higher sections of the brain via various chemical concoctions -- creating either the feelings of euphoria or disphoria as needed as incentives.  Those lower/base portions of the brain are not SUPPOSED to be ""in charge"" -- not at the ""executive"" level -- rather they are and should be seen as simply sending signals and ""requests"" to the higher executive level brain... which then needs to take OTHER things (of which the low-level ""dick"" and or ""gut"" are entirely unaware & uncaring about) into account... and direct action accordingly.  In essence I am agreeing with you -- you are right in that the ""feelings"" (and emotions) are RESPONSES/REACTIONS and requests/signals/feedback -- they should NOT be ""in charge"".  What I am taking issue with is the idea that the ""brain"" is the source of the problem -- it isn't a monolithic thing, it's a complex mechanism with a host of regions and layers, requests and feedback mechanisms. The MIND needs to be MINDFUL and self-aware to overcome and control those.    Ergo your brain DOES need to ""care"" -- because that's where your ""mind"" exists."

To wit, /u/yakatonker over here in this comment basically states that he is essentially a mindless amoral animal.  It's a cute way of avoiding all responsibility for his actions -- whatever he chooses to do, be it chase after pussy or molest little boys, or sit in public and fling his feces at anyone who passes by -- well it's not HIS fault, it's his ""genetic programming"".  The thing about that is this... eventually other people (people who ARE people) will simply ""agree"" -- they will agree that /u/yakatonker is not actually a ""human"" but rather just (yet another) ""animal"" -- and thus they will feel zero remorse over whatever happens to him: whether he starves to death (meh, animals starve all the time... big deal), whether he gets chopped up and blood spurting everywhere eaten by other animals (well again, big deal, nature is red in tooth and claw), if some actual humans decide to kill him, dispose of him like some roadkill rodent, or even chop him up into little pieces and feed him to the dogs... again no big deal, since he himself denied that he was actually a sentient being, and instead proclaimed he was JUST and ONLY another animal, and that ""morals"" (including murder) not only didn't matter, but they didn't even exist."
MGTOW,3bf9sn,oldredder,0,Mon Jun 29 10:24:05 2015 UTC,"Foot into mouth much?   I said there was an economy to thought, action, you do not have free will, what you believe in, your ridiculous religion in will is what I call the culmination of economical factors which affect and mold your decisions. You are not the culmination of your own mind, you are the sum of a bunch of economic parts which act continuously on you. A person just doesn't make decisions and motion in their life without any stimulus from their environment, they are the sum of that environment and your thoughts are molded into said environment along with your non existent perspective. Biology plays a big role because the brain gives massive behavioral boons to certain lines of thought which result in reproduction/survival, this does not only effect you through your subconscious it bleeds even into your conscious thoughts.  As well your comment to our other chain arguement was absurd, arguing with a cat? solipsistic post-modern? You just spout this shit with absolutely no social proof, but I don't expect much from someone who can't be bothered to hit the google search function button.   Edit: 1   A person can act against unfavorable economy, ie r/TRP exampled with Gynocentrism/women by understanding the factors, conditions afflicting their person but if you don't bother to research, inform a real world framework about the problem, change does not occur in any meaningful way. Free will is a byproduct of many things, do not chalk it up to just ""responsibility"", that's the retarded, centrist, self defeating stereotype the ignorant uses to cast off ""responsibility"" in understanding the mechanics behind the motions of the human mind, or whatever other perspective they know nothing off."

I was at the HS graduation party for a friend's son, and the grandmother of the family was showing pictures of the recent wedding of another grandson (her other son's son) -- and guess what he was marrying?  Yup, a woman who was like 6 months pregnant (nope NOT his kid), and there were 3 of her other kids (ranging from 3 to 7 years old) who were part of the ""wedding party"" -- so the portrait of the ""happy couple"" is actually of this 30+ year old fat-pregger woman (seated of course), with the skinny/scrawny twenty-something dude standing half alongside/behind her, and her three other crotchspawn (of varying skin tones & eye color & hair types) all arrayed around them.    So no, it may be an extreme, but it isn't far-fetched or ""over kill"" -- it's the reality that actually DOES exist out there."

So called liberals will say that her response is a ""wonderful"" example of how people can change for the better... to me it's an example of just how completely ""lost"" our society has become in terms of even the simplest forms of common sense, much less any concept of moral behavior.  I sometimes wonder just how much lower things will go... if she's still around say 10 years from now, will she be trying to show me 3D video of her great-grandson's copulation ""ceremony"" with the herd of sheep he's ""marrying""?  Or will it be some second marriage+plus between this same grandson & wife as they opting to ""add"" say a 7 year old boy into the now ""polyamorous-mixed-hetero-bisexual-pedophile"" marriage?  That seems asburd now, yes... but than again this recent marriage would have been seen as JUST as ""absurd"" (especially as  a CHURCH wedding with this ""bride"" in a white dress no less) just a few decades back."

Sex is the strongest motivator for men and women, its a survival mechanism which ensures reproduction is the number one prerogative of either sex and thanks to this, this economy will wash out most other imperatives if a person isn't conscious, has developed experience as a means to downgrade the economy of this motivational subconscious drive.   Simply put a person operates by their economy, moral and ethics only apply pending on the value of a relationship and motivational economy behind the interactions of two peoples or more. I hope that wasn't a confusing explanation but I base it more of economics, because people are truly honest towards their values when they put their money towards something."

To bastardize a little, gravity and the theory of general relativity are coming under increasing criticism as a flawed paper theory being unable to explain or predict phenomenon in the known universe, ie (Hawking's blackholes), as well gravity is so weak a force in the universe, so weak that in comparison to the strongest known force, electromagnetism by a form factor of around 10 to the power 38 that some people have abandoned it for a new promising field of research known as plasma cosmology which is still quite in its infancy, however showing promise.   To the topic at hand, your example does not in anyway address my point. Morals and ethics are concepts, ideas encompassing an ideological part of a person's framework in order to understand the world about them. Morals and ethics describe a set of behaviours that people deem favorable to their person, however in the exercise of those behaviors you'll find people quite wanting from the ideological, that's because people trade these behaviors with others they deem of value and if there's no social reinforcement of net positive whatsoever for these behaviors people wouldn't even practice them at all. Our economy is the perfect reflection of the individual in this regard, if not for socialist new deal policies and a democratic bureaucracy to tie the hands of the nationalist plutocracy the skew and spread of equity in society would be loop sided to the extreme as it was in capitalist systems prior to the system wipes of the world wars and mass economic crashes.    I hear this increasingly, and quite frankly its a particular piece of BULLSHIT that I am growing tired of.  It's an EXCUSE -- a ""hamster"" rationalization that allows people to claim that they ""aren't responsible"" for their own choices and actions.  It's really the same as saying ""some demon made me do it"".   Are you suggesting free will is real? It takes a significant amount of experience, effort and time for a person to change a single behavior, if people weren't anchored by the subconscious and indeered with ""free will"" we'd be more prone at observing people with the ability to immediately adapt to unfavorable circumstances. However this is not the case with a super majority of people, whatsoever, rather we see a process spanning months and years for an individual to effect change upon themselves. I would also save the stereotype called ""responsibility"" for something tangible, such as within a specified context where a person is highly conscious , ""responsibility"" does not fit as as realistic or useful term in regards to understanding human behavior, rather the term itself lacks neutrality and is often a political smear.

The context you provided is very lacking if not completely unrealistic to the modern reality we're in, most people do not have problems accessing food, water or shelter rather we've accumulated a lot of materialist garbage in this technological era which has given people an abundance of free time. That said even in a situation of low essentials such as food, water or shelter men as the physically stronger of the species would utilize your scenario to acquire sex, even if they risked a night or two without food. The thirst is quite strong, in fact its why the so called ""blue pillers"" or often so demonized and why their sexual strategies are so obvious to those who're red pilled. They try economically trading time, money and effort for female sex, validation and attention, a man enslaves himself to Gynocentrism in more ways then one.

Most humans are quite happy being free range animals, just look at the men in r/TheRedPill, they love catering to their subconscious need for sex, female and social(Gynocentrism) validation through the creation of its capital. Have you ever discussed with a person and probed their consciousness for their philosophy, most people have next to none after their income earning specialization(education/work experience), they're devoid and filled with the regurgitated capitol of Gynocentric content, their sheep in its manifold and have perspective ability which mirrors the social macro.

Well as I posited over in the thread on the judges in the two Alabama Counties I think the EASIEST way for states like that to be ""in compliance"" and yet NOT have to force any of the locals (judges, clerks, etc) to do something against their beliefs...  Will be to turn the process of getting a marriage license (and/or registering a ""marriage"") into basically an online form + fee deal -- entirely automated, and akin to the way (AFAIK nearly all) states now allow people to register the ""creation"" of new legal-fiction corporate ""people"" (i.e. LLC's -- see * note at bottom), there is no ceremony, there are no witnesses, no vows, no notarizing of anything, not even any actual ""signatures"" (signatures on forms, contracts and even checks have -- to be blatantly frank -- become a complete and total farce, virtually no one validates the things, EVER); you simply fill in the form (it does some rudimentary checking, like to make certain your new LLC name isn't ""identical"" to an existing one -- a check by the way that DOESN'T work with people) and then you either include a credit/debit card number to pay the fee, or else in some cases you can even hit ""submit"" and then MAIL in a payment (personal check or even postal money order)... and TADA! you'll be ""married"".    What THAT will do -- switching to an entirely ""hands off"" mechanistic system (with the ""print the confirmation page"" serving as the temporary ""proof"" and a mailed ""certificate"" coming a week or two later, and/or possibly even being sent as a PDF to an email address, or eventually even dispensing with that and simply giving a ""marriage number"" that can then be later pulled up from the database) -- well... that'll open the doors for anything and everything...    Someone (actually given 300+ million people, probably a LOT of someones) will decide ""marry"" their dog or cat... and it will be a fait accompli that sits on the records for 3 years, 5 years, probably even 10 years before someone realizes that ""Hey this dude married his DOG... first name 'Killer' maiden-last name listed as 'AKC Labrador'!""  The first few of those that they discover or run across, well the officials involved will probably just try to ignore it, shove it under the carpet and pretend that it ISN'T in the system (because it would be REALLY ""embarrassing"" to reveal, and besides it's just that one guy, ok well it's 2 or 3 people, but you can't let the NEWS get a hold of that, right?)  Eventually though, it will become common (and blatant) enough that it won't be able to be hidden anymore -- one or more instances will come out -- and then as ""anonymous sources"" one or more employees (or former employees) of various state departments will reveal that ""Oh yeah, we knew that was happening for the past 5 years.""  Some further ""investigative reporting"" will then try to go digging and will reveal that people marrying dogs is the LEAST of the ""absurd"" things (and probably most harmless, because most won't ACTUALLY be ""bestiality"" situations) that the system has allowed... the thing will be ridden with all kinds of things: people having married several other people (oops, forgot to have it check for ""unique user name/ID""), not just polygamy & polyandry, but a whole ""mix"" of complex marital intertwinings; then of course there will be people who married dead people, people who married trees and other ""inanimate objects""; probably even more than one case of ""prank"" marriages where someone (i.e. not one of the marital parties) has put in two names of OTHER people and ""married"" them together without them ever being aware.  Keep in mind that these kinds of systems will be built along much the same lines as the governments OTHER online-access databases -- including the ""healthcare.gov"" fiasco (and many others that are far worse).    The ensuing ""shitstorm"" -- especially as so many other ""special privileges"" not excluding massive amounts of monetary payments from the government, insurance companies who relied on those databases, etc -- well it's going to be something to ""see"" alright.    Worse, there really won't be a ""solution""... no way to ""preserve"" the system or to go back through the records and ""clean up the database"" -- or at least no ""easy/cheap"" way (we're talking efforts & costs that would dwarf the work to fix the Y2K thing) -- because the system WON'T contain anything for information that could readily distinguish the records of those kind of sham/farce marriages versus the records of people who were ""legitimately"" married (with a ceremony, witnesses, an officiating minister/judge, etc); nope any and ALL such ""marriages"" will have been reduced to the same MINIMAL record data in the database. Sure the latter MAY have filled out and mailed in a paper form, with nicely written ink signatures of the witness and the officiating party, etc -- but the states will NOT have properly scanned and linked those, instead someone will just enter the data, and then (at best) shuffle the paper form off to some filing/archiving place, or in all probability (most likely) many of the offices will just trash or even shred the paper form (which is what they are doing currently with a whole host of other things, driver & vehicle license applications, etc)... in either case it will be as if that paper form and those signatures never existed, just ""text data"" in a database, no different than if they had filled out the form online.  But the states DARE not simply ""invalidate"" ALL of the marriages in the database (nor the fact that probably a LOT of other databases will also ""reference"" either the marriage license # or else just the ""fact"" that the individuals are ""married"", etc) ... so it's going to be a real and very major quandry.  I think the whole thing will end up making the state marital registries a complete ""farce""...

Not eliminating people's ""marriages"" but effectively rendering them moot & legally worthless.

However since it decided to take that power, I don't see how it can stop now.  Another decision to take the government out of domestic affairs would be welcome in general. It does only harm."
MGTOW,3be9l9,sardinemanR,3,Sun Jun 28 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"Carl Tobias, professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said he doesn't think courts will allow counties to opt of the marriage business. The Supreme Court's decision affirmed marriage as a fundamental right, he said. So denying marriage licenses to everyone does not follow the court's order.   Well, he's wrong about that.   Doesn't seem to me that the county is ""denying"" licenses, it's just choosing to NOT ""perform"" the marriages itself. I rather doubt that they will be actively preventing the churches or ""wedding chapels"" in the county from performing marriages.  All the county has to do to be in compliance is to have a blank form available for people to fill out & sign; they don't have to conduct a ""ceremony"".  And even that might be a stretch -- the COUNTY level government probably doesn't even have to provide the blank form -- if the STATE has a ""marriage registry"" then the form/filing/registry would all be a ""State government"" thing, and the county may not have to do anything at all.  Similar to the way things like ""corporations"" or ""LLC's"" are handled/created: you fill out a form, sign it and mail it in with your fee (and these days often it's just a matter of filling in fields of an online form* and -- sans ANY actual ""signature"" or witnesses -- hitting ""submit"" along with a credit/debit card number that gets billed).  *Of course this could easily end up creating it's own little problems -- with no actual signatures, and no witnessing or ""notary public"" to verify the ID's of the people (or possibly even just person) filling out the form... who is to say that the thing is at all valid. A compete stranger could (potentially) fill out such a form with two names pulled from a phonebook, and using a temporary (anonymous) debit card for the payment could effectively ""marry"" two people to each other without their even being aware. Ah, you gotta love ""technology"" -- especially when the government trys to use it."
MGTOW,3be9l9,thrownaway_MGTOW,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the purpose of marriage sure has changed. It used to be a big thing, with everyone you knew present, so that your whole community was there to witness your lifelong engagement. Now, it's 4 people in a room, the couple, one witness and whatever public official is doing it. What's stopping the next step, as you said: a formed filled out with nobody present. I believe you can get a divorce by filling an online form in the Czech Republic, so marriage can't be far away.  But I believe it's much more likely that they'll find a way to force these judges to perform these ceremonies, against their will. The rights to private conscience and free expression have already been tossed aside when it was convenient, so you can't expect them to just give up because that's the letter of the law. But if that happens, it might actually trigger something else: religious people deciding to get married religiously, but not register in the state, as a sign of protest. This could have very interesting repercussions."
MGTOW,3be9l9,zyk0s,3,Sun Jun 28 20:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the purpose of marriage sure has changed. It used to be a big thing, with everyone you knew present, so that your whole community was there to witness your lifelong engagement.   Actually it has changed so many times and in so many ways over the centuries -- including the ""purpose"" of it -- that there is really no stating of ""how it used to be"" as anywhere near being correct in a general all-across-time manner.  Yes, in many eras and communities it was a community-wide-witnessed event.  In others, there is/was no such ceremony at all -- just a proverbial ""jump over the broom"" in with one or two people holding the broom up -- or in fact just as often NO ceremony or ""event"" at all, you just shacked up together and THAT meant you were married, period.  And in many societies no one really gave a shit if the erstwhile ""couple"" then ""broke apart"" -- the only time that they CARED in fact was if there were children* -- THAT altered matters, because the rest of the community (especially immediate family) didn't want to get stuck having to somehow raise & feed & clothe someone else's little urchins. (And keep in mind this even included churches like the Catholic church, which had ZERO problem -- provided you paid a fee of course -- with ""annulling"" marriages that the Church itself had performed: the only difficulty occurred when there were children {or in the case of someone like Henry the VIII, when he seemed to want to change wives on a continual rotating basis, which was making a farce out of the whole thing}.)    * EDIT: By the way, this is also why there really was no such thing as ""gay marriage"" or indeed even ""homosexuality"" (as some ""sexual identity/lifestyle"") in ancient or medieval times -- because ""marriage"" per se was just naturally seen as DIRECTLY related to a family with BIOLOGICAL children -- the very idea that it could somehow exist in other ""abstract"" forms would have been viewed by everyone as a ridiculously LAUGHABLE absurdity, you may as well claim that you're marrying your dog, or a sheep, or the doorpost to your house for all it mattered... if the ""union"" doesn't indeed CANNOT create children (as a direct result of the specific copulation-pairing) then it isn't/wouldn't have been a ""marriage"", period.  (On this, the ""conservatives"" are 100% correct -- and the reality is that the LGBTQ community doesn't really give a shit about getting ""married"" either -- the whole issue is to push an agenda, and not to achieve the thing itself.)"

Looks like even though he now claims that he received it, there is no formal record or citation that he actually GOT the ""annulment"" -- although it wouldn't surprise me if he was able to basically ""buy"" such a thing (via some donation to some local Diocese, his second wife certainly has sufficient cash).  And yeah, it's a pretty shitty thing to basically try to officially relabel your children as ""bastards"" (and moreover while they are teenagers!) and to essentially deny that you were married for ~18 years -- but given what else I know about John Kerry, well it doesn't exactly surprise me."

Oh, I doubt that very much.  If there is one profession or position that is pretty insulated from all kinds of bullshit in terms of being ""ordered"" to do anything they DON'T want to do, it would be judges.  They might be able to force the COUNTY to have some person available to perform a ""civil"" ceremony... but it won't be the sitting circuit judges; some revamped ""justice of the peace"" position will be created with duties exclusively being ""performance of civil marriage ceremonies"" -- hell, they could probably even contract it out to some part-time, fee-for service thing.  But I really doubt that they can force even that.    See, the whole ""federal case"" issue around the marriage thing is really all about forcing the STATES to recognize marriages in/from other STATES, and to cause a ""uniformity"" in terms of STATE level law -- so the easiest route for any state to be ""in compliance"" will be to make it like applying for a park sticker: fill out an envelope form, stick a check (or a couple of buck of cash) in the envelope, and then drop it into the mail or into a ""box with a slot"", and TADA! you're now allowed to use the state parks ""married"", as confirmation (and provided your check doesn't bounce and/or you placed enough cash in the envelope) then your ""sticker"" will be mailed to you within 2 weeks, in the meantime you retain a ""tear-off"" tab from envelope as your ""temporary"" park admission ticket marriage license.  And of course, given that the internet is already in existence and most states have a whole shitload of online application+fee things; the easiest way to facilitate compliance ""state wide"" would be to just create an online form thingee, with a field for online fee payment (print the ""confirmation"" page with your transaction number as your evidence that you are ""married"").  100% compliance -- and ZERO discrimination. (Hell, they not only don't ""discriminate"" based on gender, there won't even be any requirement that both parties are human, or that they even exist at all -- you could probably ""marry"" your dog, or your imaginary ""space alien"" friend -- so long as you name them on the form and pay the fee... who cares!)    EDIT: In fact that latter would probably the the BEST ""in your face"" way for the states to proceed... basically just say ""fuck it"" let's make it a ""free for all"" -- go BEYOND what the court has ""ordered"" and let people ""marry"" (or register as being married) to whoever or whatever they want.  Wanna marry a ""tree"", or a dead person? Bah, no problem go right ahead... we'll let the SCOTUS sort it all out later."

And some guys here try to talk to me as if I'm completely retarded or inexperienced.   (I'm actually mid 30s, been burned by marriage and a couple of shorter relationships)  I understand that the feminist movement is fundamentally flawed, but I wanted to prove to myself that the MGTOW movement was filled only with 'thinking' men.

MGTOW,3bdsj5,yuno44907,4,Sun Jun 28 14:24:20 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I have with feminism and women in general is the lack of critical thinking and introspection they display.  Too often, they simply yell ""you're banned."", ""you're wrong"" or ""you're bad"". They think it's okay to simply throw these words without backing anything up. It's all very amusing until women have the power or are given the power to do serious damage.  It's simply silly that women like the mods that banned you would resort to shutting people up just so they don't have to hear something they don't like. After all, you only posed some simple questions to them. If they didn't know how to respond, they could ignore it and think about it. If they disagreed with you, they could argue their position. Instead, they covered their ears and kicked you out.  Again, this is fine among kids or even friends, this could become a big problem when these kinds of people have political power and can do damage to others."

Why would you expect -- much less feel the need to ""prove"" -- that?  Does the presence of one ""unthinking"" person (in terms of your own judgement based on limited interaction with them in the form of threads and short text comments & replies) -- somehow ""negate"" the reality or the rest.  If there is a cow or two in a barn that is otherwise filled with horses, does it mean that the horses suddenly all become ""cows""???    Plus you have to keep in mind that -- unlike /r/feminism -- the mods of /r/MGTOW don't ""ban"" people very often (if at all), so we frequently have a lot of trolls and other types (especially newbie young guys from TRP) that pop in here and claim to be ""MGTOW"" and then go off on tangents, and etc."

Seems to happen anytime anyone disagrees with the position of one of the mods. Irony.  Short answer: My concept of feminism is about empowering everyone to equal access to options. At the end of the day, I want men and women in fulfilling work, needs covered.  I also have hopes for technology to replace the jobs no one actually wants, supervised by those rare humans who love it. All historical enlightenments have come in times of surplus and increased leisure time, so with a guaranteed base income we could subsidize the next one, hypothetically, if we get our shit together and outgrow our childlike habit of competition.  I'm a woman who's worked in millwork and remodel construction.  Thoroughly enjoyed demolition.  Picked tobacco and cotton in the fields with the migrants as a kid. My academic background was STEM heavy. Linear algebra is my bitch. I hear you, and I learned a lot about myself and where my physical limits were at the manual jobs. I recommend it."

It's aimed at a pick-up audience, but there is as much depth and insight to it as what you can find on Stardusk's youtube channel. Different areas of depth obviously, but same quality of depth.

Do you think mgtows are less prone to ending up in a midlife crisis regardless of having fewer problems with parasitic women?  Thanks.
MGTOW,3bbfbk,scarredlife,17,Sat Jun 27 20:49:42 2015 UTC,"I realised I was living my life 100% for everyone else - and was still being told it wasn't enough.  I'd done what was expected of me (marriage, kids, big house, 2 cars, 50 hour work week etc) and all of a sudden woke up one morning wondering what happened to the last 40 years.  I had all the responsibilities of a family man without any of the benefits (respect, love, working together to build a life, etc). I was a meal ticket, a beast of burden for others.  Funny how a 'mid life crisis' is seen as a joke when it happens to men, but for women its 'finding themselves' and is empowering etc (think Eat Pray Love)  I see my kids all the time now, am slowly fixing up my small apartment and have actively rejected promotions at work (60 hour weeks).  I'm living my life for me, on my terms - whilst still taking care of my responsibilities.

MGTOW,3bbfbk,temporaryusername178,2,Sat Jun 27 20:47:32 2015 UTC,Yeah - great movie.  I suppose I just picked up pieces here and there and they gradually made sense. There was no real one inspiration I suppose.  Very different these days - the internet makes information so much more accessible and can make individuals realise they aren't the only one that feels something is wrong with being on the 'traditional' path.  The ability to test concepts and thoughts anonymously on forums like this give us notoriously private guys an outlet and way to communicate with each other that has never existed before.

Because being MGTOW isn't really about MGTOW -- its about everything ELSE in life.    So instead of looking for an ""MGTOW"" meetup, look for and join ""Meet ups"" (or other groups, etc) that are ABOUT something else.  Some hobby (say woodworking) or some activity (biking, sailing, etc) -- or even profession/job/skill related -- chances are that if/when the group is large enough... say 20 people or more; then -- and especially if the interest/activity is a ""male"" type thing -- chances are that you WILL end up meeting a couple of other guys who are either MGTOW themselves (but may not wear it as a label, or even be aware of the acronym... they may just be ""bachelors"" or ""guys not currently in a relationship"" etc), or alternately who are ""MGTOW friendly"" (aka older guys who may be married, but are in somewhat dead or flat marriages/LTRs, or recently divorced guys who are not {at least yet} desperate to chase pussy/get screwed over again, etc.)     but I'm missing the male brotherhood I had with my old college roommates   Sadly this is just a natural consequence of adult male life.  It happens to EVERYONE by the way.  You just don't really ever form those kinds of friendships again -- at least not in large numbers, nor with anywhere near as much time spent with each other -- and to some extent it's just because you're NOT ""students"" anymore, you're an adult now with adult jobs and adult responsibilities, and also ironically enough with your own ""adult home"" (so you're less of a ""transient"" who is out and about seeking somewhere to ""chill"", you can now ""chill"" at home) ... and that's generally true even without wife/family."

Get out and about enough, and especially if you intermix with people across age groups, then you're almost certain to serendipitously end up encountering (and identifying, joining up with and befriending) other men who are -- for one reason or another (age, divorce, widowhood, etc) fairly independent of women, if not explicitly ""MGTOW"" style bachelors.  EDIT: Also keep in mind that with such groups & hobbies/activities, chances are that any MARRIED men who do attend -- well almost by definition (at least unless they attend as a couple) they are probably at least somewhat ""independent"" of their wives -- else they wouldn't be able to be a part of the group."
MGTOW,3bdi4a,thrownaway_MGTOW,3,Mon Jun 29 00:32:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a history buff, but it seems like boarding houses have went the way of the dinosaur. I wonder if a few decades from now they will be as commonplace as they seem to have been in early 20th century literature. Thoughts?   Actually I think they were more of a ""temporary"" phenomenon of a VERY specific era, a result of a need that developed under a sort of unique set of conditions that really no longer exists (at least not in the developed ""western"" nations -- I think such things ARE in fact fairly common in newly developing/industrializing countries like China & other SE Asia nations, as well as several African countries/regions).     What conditions?   A rapidly growing YOUNG population -- lots of young guys (especially young guys) heading into some big city/urban area for jobs (typically factory jobs, etc) -- or conversely even today in some rural area that otherwise lacks housing (for example the fracking/oil drilling ""boom"" area in the western Dakotas in the US -- lots of ""dorms"" & boarding houses out there right now). An absence of modern ""transportation"" -- i.e. few or no subways, no cars (or else cars were uber expensive and beyond reach), etc -- which means people basically needed to either WALK or else ride a bicycle or obtain ""rides"" etc; end result was that people wanted/needed to live NEAR whatever jobs (especially factories) existed. Some major limitations -- even if it was just because of a ""boomtown"" phenom that was playing catchup -- in terms of the supply of high-density housing (especially full blown apartment buildings each w kitchen/bath). Whenever those were in short supply, and assuming authorities allowed alternatives to develop (which at the time with minimal regulations they did), then inevitably homes and other buildings (old office buildings, etc) were converted into dormitory-style boarding facilities (i.e. it's a helluva lot easier, and cheaper {more profitable} to take one of the bedrooms or offices and convert it into some big shared bath, and stick a kitchen or cafeteria somewhere else, and then to stuff bunk-style beds into various the other rooms -- than it is to make separate kitchen+bath apartments for everyone). The absence of other remote housing -- and along with the lack of transport in #2 -- things like modern ""suburbs"", whether it be of individual small homes, or arrays of apartment buildings, etc... well they just hadn't (yet) had a chance to be developed & built (that takes time, and an affluent society, not one in the midst of a great depression, plus of course it requires laborers, who themselves have to be ""housed"" somewhere nearby).   The end result of that ""collusion/collision"" of those forces or phenomenon... meant that for probably a decade to two decades (and possibly more depending on when you define the ""start"" & end -- both of which were probably a bit ""fuzzy"" and ramp-up/taper-off on either end of the era) -- well for that brief period of time, the ""boarding house"" became a relatively common thing.  But, as the ""boom"" matured -- i.e. the initial exponential growth began to slow down into an ""S-curve"" and even started to ""plateau"" or ""peak"" & decrease -- then the affluence from the boom (along with the aging of the men workers & their desire to get OUT of the limited ""rooming house"" & have more space) meant that OTHER construction & housing option began to catch up with the demand... so people moved into apartments, or multi-unit homes, or private houses.  And suddenly the boarding homes were no longer so profitable -- so the owners allowed them to decline (that's how you continue to extract a profit, or even just meet a budget in the face of declining demand, by putting LESS back into the place) -- in time they, and often the surrounding buildings aged/deteriorated and became ghetto or even hell-hole like problem areas, and got abandoned  -- or else repurposed or even subsequently ""gentrified"" etc; either way they disappeared.  About the only LONG TERM housing that is of a similar nature -- i.e. boarding house/dorm style -- would be things like monasteries & convents (and of course college & university dorms, but those are exclusive to ""enrolled"" students)."

Those just don't seem to exist any more.  My parents suggested that I look for boarding houses when I moved across the country for an internship in college. All I could find were rotting halfway houses and they weren't even very cheap.  The weekly rate motels were a ripoff too, more expensive per month than a decent apartment.  I didn't get why it was the case until now.  It's sad but understandable.  They do seem to be sort of coming back with the ""hackerspaces"" in San Francisco and other cities though, so there is that."
MGTOW,3bdi4a,thrownaway_MGTOW,2,Mon Jun 29 15:36:08 2015 UTC,"I've read a number of Heinlein books and other authors who grew up during the late 1800s and early years of the twentieth century. I always marveled (seriously, I found it cool) at how you could show up in a new city, go to the YMCA or whatever and get a simple but clean room with a bed and desk for an indeterminate period of time at a low rate.   One of the reasons was rather simple: It made TOTAL SENSE for industrialists to support those kinds of ""charitable"" enterprises (yes even without some kind of ""tax writeoff"" for the donation).  Keep in mind that the local YMCA wasn't just a ""flophouse"" -- it was a regimented one.  In other words -- in exchange for having a CHEAP, and relatively clean & nice place to live -- they placed all kinds of restrictions on the residents: generally you had to ""check in"" and ""check out"" at the front desk, that meant if you returned ""drunk off your arse"" (or even late, like past the 10PM that the doors were locked) ... well, guess what? You weren't sleeping at the Y that night.  So the BIG benefit to the factory owners was that it helped keep their workforce ""clean & sober"", which of course makes for fewer problems in terms of tardiness, etc. -- and the factory owner DIDN'T get viewed as some type of ""overbearing"" person, after all he didn't personally OWN the local YMCA, he didn't RUN the place or set the rules, and in fact he didn't require that you live there -- you could in fact live anyplace you wanted.  If you wanted to live in squalor in some dive of a flophouse, come in drunk every night, and pay a ridiculous amount in rent to some slumlord... well you could do that, up to you.  Alternately you could stay at a place like the ""Y"", put up with the rules and restrictions, and in exchange get really low cost (and some times even a few days ""free"") housing, along with the many benefits that the particular facility might have -- most not only had dormitory style rooms, but also a lot of other common areas, libraries filled with books, various sport courts, even bowling alleys, the now ubiquitous swimming pools, and so on -- basically like a Gentleman's ""social club"" alongside a community center, AND a well-equipped gymnasium.  Unless you were seriously obsessed with drinking and gambling and whoring around -- and no doubt many young guys were (though probably NOT most of the ""newbie"" young guys fresh off the farm) -- then you probably saw a LOT of merit to staying at the ""Y"".     Those just don't seem to exist any more.   Well, they do... in foreign countries a lot of them still have boarding houses -- indeed even a few of the YMCA's in the US still run facilities like that (I believe one in Chicago and a couple in New York) but they are increasingly rare, as the YMCA/USA no longer sees that as it's ""mission"" or purpose.  Indeed for the most part -- again at least in the USA -- the acronym has become entirely meaningless (or farcical & fraudulent depending on your point of view) because the organization is no longer ""Christian"" in any way shape or form, and it's really no longer an ""association"" having become more of a competitive profit-making enterprise (although still ostensibly ""non-profit""), and it definitely isn't about helping ""young men"" any more (the local ""Y"" around my area in fact seems to go out of its way to drive away any and all 20 or 30-something {or really ANY/ALL} single men -- in part because the place is now almost entirely run by WOMEN, and they view most young single men as either potential ""rapists"" or ""pedophiles"" coming after the women and/or their children that are the chief PAYING clients at what has now become the local ""health club"" and child-care/activity center).  And of course that song -- you know the one -- well that probably didn't help matters any... making it seem like the YMCA boarding houses were basically a ""hive"" of urban homosexual activity... in some senses it's entirely understandable that the organization itself has ""reacted"" the way that it has (and eliminated those facilities -- i.e. no more ""fun to stay at the YMCA"" because you can't ""stay"" there, period.)  I just wish they (at least the US operations) would change the name -- ditch the YM and the C, probably the A as well -- and at least end the ""farce"" of that aspect.     They do seem to be sort of coming back with the ""hackerspaces"" in San Francisco and other cities though, so there is that.   Yeah, there have been a few attempts in various places; though as far as I know most of the ""hackerspaces"" don't have actual ""room & board"".  Part of the problem is that with zoning laws and various health codes and such, anyone trying to set something like that up on a large scale (i.e. more than a couple of guys sharing a house) would need to apply for a whole shitload of ""variances"" which are highly unlikely to be granted.  About the ONLY entities that can even attempt to create ""shared bath/kitchen"" type rooming houses any more are Colleges/Universities; and most of them aren't actually even building traditional ""dorms"" anymore, because the incoming students want (often demand) fancier apartment-style ""digs"", and they really don't understand/give a crap about being ""frugal"" (hey I mean you just take out another/bigger student loan, amiright? I mean you won't REALLY have to pay it back, they'll do some kind of ""loan forgiveness"" thingee eventually.)  End result is that -- even if there is some (sizable) ""demand"" -- the things that are now in place, both regulatory AND societal things (witness the current, largely feminist driven campaign to END the last remaining vestige of a private ""men only club/boarding facilty"" -- the college Frat house) ... well they basically make it impossible for such a thing to be recreated (keep in mind that even if someone well funded were to attempt to create some  ""hackerspace"" boarding facility, it would HAVE to be ""co-ed+"" with all that that entails; nor would any of the other old ""restrictions"" on drink, drugs, or even open/blatant sexual activity be allowed either -- anything smacking of that would be deemed ""discriminatory"" -- and so the end result, a pithole/cesspool is just as inevitable, because that's what happens when you aren't allowed to impose ""standards"")."

Of course, in the past, getting fed cheaply required someone providing a lot of labor, a woman usually. Now of course it's inexpensive and convenient to get meals a variety of ways.  As for the camaraderie, this does seem to be of a bygone age, as well as the result of generations of feminist well-poisoning of the culture of male spaces, equating them with abusive environments to women.  Much of what is left is around corporate sports, which is very unsatisfying. I do believe there will be a resurgence of male groups as the mythology that defamed them becomes more widely viewed as misleading.  Perhaps LAN gaming groups will end up in houses together, with places tech'ed up the ass and cheap to rent as a group.  I'm an old fart and live peacefully with another old fart.

Pretty much the same here.  The only televised ""sport"" I've ever been able to get into was Tennis -- and then really only during the years when I was also actively playing the sport regularly myself (I still try to play occasionally, but it's so rare that I get the chance to, much less have a decent partner...) -- and the thing is that I watched to not only admire (and occasionally marvel at) the techniques & endurance of the pro's, but also occasionally to try to figure out whether there was something I could emulate in my own play (I had no delusions of grandeur, just enjoyed the exercise/activity and liked doing what I could to improve my game).  I especially liked watching Borg play with his ""deep"" and heavy topspin game, and then a few other odd players later on.  I remember being just mesmerized and then increasingly giddy over Michael Chang's torturous and then wonderful come from behind win over Ivan Lendl in the 1989 French Open -- which he won more on will-power than actual skill, he just wouldn't give up, wouldn't give in, and constantly fought back from the brink... it was an absolutely AMAZING feat to watch.  Compared to that... well watching a gaggle of overpaid dudes toss a ball around... just doesn't do anything for me.

But is see virtually zero value in adults watching the things repeatedly; the whole thing has become so systematized and mechanistic that quite frankly it seems to me that essentially every game is so contrived as to border on banal.

MGTOW,3bbldr,Watchful1ntervention,3,Sat Jun 27 23:06:03 2015 UTC,I've always wondered what in the heck does a secular state have fuck all to do with regulating relationships like this?  I understand when long ago America was basically a Christian country and it was for efficiency reasons. But now those days are long gone and we need something more abstract and generic.   If that's the case we should only have civil unions and wedding ceremonies with vows and receptions but completely rewrite what it means to enter these unions and what it means to exist them.
MGTOW,3bbldr,TheRedThrowAwayPill,13,Sat Jun 27 23:25:41 2015 UTC,"I understand when long ago America was basically a Christian country and it was for efficiency reasons.   Here's the thing. Back then, the government basically WASN'T INVOLVED.  There was zero reason for the government to even CARE whether someone was ""married"" or not; and in the few instances where there was some ""court"" aspect that needed to determine marriage (generally speaking probably things like settling an estate) either an attestation by witnesses to a ""common law"" marriage, or the testimony of a priest/pastor/preacher and/or the Church records of the marriage ceremony having taken place were deemed sufficient.  The whole ""government marriage license"" thing didn't begin until the latter half of the 19th century, and then it didn't really become an issue until the late 19th and early 20th century, when three different ""movements"" began to take hold:   The ""tender years doctrine"" which undermined the previous standard default view that the father (and/or with older kids, the child themselves) were in control over/responsible for children and instead began awarding ""custody"" (in some senses a newly invented concept -- along with the concept of adolescence, compulsory schooling, and the idea that teens were second-class non-citizens) to the mothers; accompanied of course with the idea of court-imposed alimony & child support. The feminist push for voting and other ""progressive"" things -- including wonderful stuff like income taxes. Evolution, ""Social Darwinism"" & the subsequent eugenics and racism aspects -- which led to things like ""blood tests"" (ostensibly for VD/STD's, but really on the basis of the foolish pseudo-scientific notion of blood-compatibility/incompatibility) being required before issuing a marriage ""permit"" (i.e. required in advance, rather than merely a ""license"" registration of a past-event).      and then of course, with the advent of the ""nanny"" state... Things like income tax credits for marital couples, as well as government pensions (social security and others) and the whole ""survivor benefits"" being tossed as a sop to women by politicians eager to pander for their votes, etc. And everything else, all the so called other ""benefits"" from being recorded as ""married"" -- various insurance things, the whole ""hospital regulation"" system and who could visit, etc -- all of that basically followed on from the above; because once this ""marriage"" thing became some codified ""license"" well then it became possible (both legally AND socially) for others to demand evidence of it and/or to give it special treatment, privileges.   The plain truth of the matter is that back in the era when the US was ostensibly founded as a quasi ""Christian"" nation -- THAT was (ironically enough) the era when it was more ""abstract"" and ""generic""... as were a lot of other things in life.  It's really only as government began backing AWAY from the so called ""Christian and/or Freethinking"" roots -- and began to claim to be ""Progressive"" and ""Scientific"" and ""Socialist"" that the regulation of and intrusion of government into basically all aspects of family began to occur."

There are some men who would rather die than give up sex, and I'm not joking, there was guest in one of the podcasts that I used to listen to that said that he simply cannot imagine his life without sex, he simply has no scope or imagination to perceive his life without pussy, that's how much it controls the male brain. it is ingrained and overwhelming, frankly, I'm surprised MGTOW has as many smart people as it does, considering how powerful those instincts are.   MGTOW are essentially not as controlled by those base biological instincts, so it runs counter to the desires of most males. When you think about it, it is really quite incredible that some humans can possess the knowledge on how to maximize their sexual strategy, then turn and walk away, not to self-praise ourselves too much, but we are essentially fighting against our base instincts, and it does take some courage and self-sacrifice to do this, since we're essentially forfeiting our contributions to the gene pool, most people simply do not want to do this, or in the above anecdote, some people can't even imagine a life without sex."

I still have my sister's friends who want to hook up and it's impossible for me to turn down so I go for it. But basically we are, but being a Buddhist myself being a monk is about finding peace within yourself and not looking for an outsource to make yourself happy. I don't let sex control me, I control it! It's natural to want to mate and fighting it is truly the hardest thing we as human nature can do."
MGTOW,3b9qa7,MGTOWJayJay,8,Sat Jun 27 09:56:57 2015 UTC,"frankly, I'm surprised MGTOW has as many smart people as it does, considering how powerful those instincts are.    I think it's almost tautological.  MGTOW is basically a position or philosophy of ""mind over hormones"" -- i.e. by definition it is brain OVERPOWERING the ""instincts"" (and/or at least dramatically de-prioritizing them).  TRP is essentially all about accommodating the instincts (or at least attempting to do so, and making at least A priority, if not THE priority, out of them).  I'd venture to say that -- and while it sounds condescending or elitist, nevertheless I think it would prove true -- if you took a random sample of MGTOW participants, and a similar random sample of TRP participants...  That an ""IQ"" style test would reveal that most of MGTOW are on the higher ""outlier"" end of the IQ spectrum (and likewise with things like skills, diversity of hobbies, etc); whereas the TRP sample would probably be more in the ""middle"" of the bell curve distribution.  You can say then either that we ""self-select"" -- or if you look at it another way, each group draws from a vastly DIFFERENT size ""base"" population."

MGTOW,3b9qa7,Morranaii,12,Sat Jun 27 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"You mean people want to pretend they have sex.  Men have sex very rarely, especially after marriage. Most certainly they can live without it---otherwise most of the male species, actually probably all of the male species other than porn stars and maybe a few athletes for part of their lives---would have died out.  These men want to pretend they are having sex every night, but they aren't. They're ""lucky"" if they have sex twice a month. There are a lot of dead bedrooms where there is no sex. And all the statistics actually show married couples have more sex (hah) than non-married people.   They call it getting ""lucky"" for a reason. And also, this is why all any female has to do is put out a bit, and she's hooked 99% of the male population, who while posing for most of their lives finally has access to sex and immediately goes beta, goes for the marriage etc. to keep that going. Women threaten to cut off access to sex and these guys aren't finding more women, they're desperate.  MGTOW are either men that have had enough sex to not have to pose, or men that understand posing is pointless and their rational brains are still in control.   If men were getting near the amount of sex they like to pretend they're getting, I doubt any man would get married."

MGTOW,3b9qa7,crazydave1979,13,Sat Jun 27 10:34:15 2015 UTC,I would be interested to see... but I suspect the difference is age and intellect (which are decidedly related for men ;) and the reddit male population is younger.  In many ways being a MGTOW is the real version of 'abundance mentality' and 'holding frame'.  TRP will get you lots of not so bright chicks.  Ironically... if you want to attract a highly intelligent grounded woman...and then drive her completely nuts... MGTOW is the way to go.  I (doesn't it always devolve into something about yourself.. is this place just a diary for men ;) anyway... I have a great career.  Computational research at a major university.  I make 6 figures.  I have an awesome pension.  I have two houses.  I've been published in a few major journals of science.  I  run 25 miles a week... now that I'm done stroking myself... the point is....  When I meet a lady my attitude is simply stay around if you want... or don't... meah...  Because I'm happy and I just like myself.    I  do have a LTR right.  It's from the position of fuck you as they say.  I  don't do shit tests... I don't hide my feelings... I'm exceedingly kind... but in the end I don't NEED sex or approval.   I'm just dandy without it.

Yet there are clearly a lot of men who achieve independence everywhere but where it actually counts most -- the mind.  To me MGTOW is simply correct thinking."
MGTOW,3b9qa7,Solringen,6,Sat Jun 27 15:53:51 2015 UTC,"This. I am also well off, relatively speaking, and make good money when I bother to work. I own a nice house outright and also have rental properties. I am relatively attractive, no self esteem issues or need for strategy lessons.   As I've commented a few times before when we discuss our circumstances, you and I are like twin brothers in how our lives are situated (or how we've arranged/constructed them).  Yet at the same time we seem to see things ever so slightly differently, to wit:   For me MGTOW is the outcome of abundance mentality.    I get you on this, and yet disagree (albeit perhaps it is a disagreement only in the way we word it).  I comprehend the fact that there is ""abundance"" in terms of females essentially giving it away willy-nilly...  And yet one of the reasons I would say I am MGTOW is because of the opposite: the scarcity of ""quality"" women in the midst of that abundance.  The way our society is currently structured, with the table soooo egregiously tilted against the long/strong interests of men (i.e. of having & keeping a true ""family"" -- and being more than a milch-cow providing resources) -- that it means the level of quality you NEED to find in a female is all the higher, and therefore all the RARER.  The courts and other systems have incentivized & regular ""reward"" the poor quality women; virtually all aspects of constraint (even basic ethics in terms of things like not lying about factual matters) have been tossed overboard.  So while in ""sexual"" terms (crude ""fucking"" and other sexual acts) there is abundance -- in terms of actual ""mating"" (i.e. reproducing & rearing of children), I think there is the absolute opposite: a profound scarcity of women that are worth anything OTHER than an ""indifferent"" fuck.  The AWALT (or ASSPOWALT) principle becomes even truer in our current society & context than it is (or would be) from the bare biological sense in a society that still gave (for example) default parenting to the father.  Yes the woman MIGHT still engage in hypergamy, and while that might create a certain level of problems in ones life -- one could (in the past) have gotten rid of her without entirely sacrificing or losing control over one's life achievements & legacy (both the children themselves as well as the assets built up for them as the ""family"")."
MGTOW,3b9qa7,drkstrs,2,Sat Jun 27 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"I agree the low quality types you describe are abundant.   I'm not MGTOW oriented though because of scarcity of so called higher quality women, at least not directly.  I probably could have been snared younger in that case simply by the ""two can be stronger than one"" idea.  But primarily because I have no interest in the normal social program.  My ideal world would be one of voluntarily dwindling population, where men are devoted to things that interest them, a world being overrun again by nature.  Not this 7 billion and exploding planet killing binge we find ourselves in.  I'm glad to be ""out of it"" it when its more of the same taint."

MGTOW,3b9qa7,totorox,2,Mon Jun 29 15:55:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly.

People are fast to parrot things they find exhilarating which can lead to poor decisions. Because their lives are so boring they must live vicariously through others to affirm they're not drawl. In doing so they adorn the persona of the individual they're attempting to mimic, and if that person is touted as having constant sex, doing drugs, and being an all around douche then you can well guess that's what they'll try to copy.     I'm of the opinion that if a person wears the shoes of another for so long the traits of the owner will become so ingrained into the wearer.. it becomes a permanent change. So if someone emulates these people for long enough then they too become the trash they've been striving to copy. You must have a really poor sense of self for that to happen though, but I guess you wouldn't have a strong one to begin with if escapism is your go-to direction in life."

They still want to fight the good fight against the feminist menace which plagues the very hearts of man. They're more outspoken and take action when necessary. They have yet to go their own way, they're still in the game just now on the opposite side.     I see MGTOW being more of a demilitarized zone for men who are waiting on their discharge papers. They've come back from the war, beaten and bruised and in need of recovery, where we offer help and support where needed so when they get back state side they're equipped with the strength to now find their own way, or rather go their own way.     Of course, that's just my perspective on the matter."
MGTOW,3b9qa7,pawsahf,5,Sat Jun 27 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"Who knows.  It's a confusing subject to talk about because MGTOWs and TRP are both based on the same concept: Taking the Red Pill. Red Pillers focus on improving their sexual market value (and that's all it is, if they tell you otherwise it's just a crisis of motive) and navigating the world of sexuality. MGTOWs are just focused on doing their own thing which may include PUA.  I would say there's many times more MGTOWs than there are PUA guys, but you never see the MGTOWs for obvious reasons."

While it does possess some core MGTOW values and has a focus on self-improvement, TRP, at its foundation, it's just another way for men to validate themselves and increase ""SMV"" to get some ass. Which, if that's your game, cool. Some men are unable to fight against their basic sexual instincts and make the true jump to the MGTOW life.   MGTOW are the penultimate that TRP WISH to embody.

IMO, TRP is primarily a consciously developed mindset that is aimed at enabling men (and women, if they wish it) to maximise their human potential within a context of a deeper-than-usual understanding of human nature / motivations.

I would agree that a lot of MGTOWS are men that can & will get laid if the need arises but their time & peace of mind is more important to them. That's why for a lot of the young subscribers on the TRP it's necessary for them to experience their first ONEitis / AF BB /  female infidelity / chaotic LTR to truly appreciate why rational men with options do in fact go their own way.

I think -- entirely contrary to the feminist claims* -- the propensity to intimate partner violence is a FEMALE trait, period.  And not only violent toward their ""intimate partners"" but to their children as well -- basically females do virtually all of their ""violence"" behind closed doors, and in a very self-centered manner.  Men's violence is actually more frequently done in public and is -- generally speaking -- done in a ""defense of others"" fashion (whether mistaken or true, the motive is generally someone other than the man's own interest, and in fact they are often goaded into it by females, either on an individual basis or a mass one).  It is the fact that the latter (male, public violence) is VISIBLE, and the former is HIDDEN (female, private violence) that our society has such an abysmally false view of the relative prevalence of each.    * Cf To paraphrase Shakespeare: ""The WOMEN doth protest WAAAY too much, methinks."""

When we have marriages headed to divorce right after the couple has said ""I do"", it's a little hard to argue that two men marrying could possibly do more damage to the sacred covenant.  Right now, I'm out of the picture when it comes to remarrying. Two divorces is plenty, thank you very much. When I think of the odds against a third marriage--- oh, boy, no woman could possibly be worth that risk. Besides, there's this ""adultery"" thing if a divorced person remarries, according to church teachings. It's hard enough when you have the blessing of God, but without it....

I'm not on board with the whole ""don't you DARE shame 'fat' people"" (sometimes ""shame"" serves as a good motivator for self-improvement; not always, but sometimes)...  But that said, some of the NICEST women that I have ever known (i.e. THE most loyal spouses, plus hardworking ""homemakers"", excellent cooks, good at budgeting & doing work around the home, as well as being some of the BEST mothers to their kids)** have been slightly (and sometimes MORE than slightly) overweight and/or not ""celebrity actress perfect"" in their facial appearance, their fashion sense, etc. (And on more than one occasion have some ""imperfection"" -- be it a mole or a scar or some other physical imperfection that would cause many men to reject them -- yet they are all the BETTER ""people"" for that.)  If this particular dude* had aspired to marry some ""Gwyneth Paltrow"" type -- well beyond the fact that the chances of his obtaining that would be virtually ZERO -- if by some highly unlikely series of event$$$$ he had achieved that, well his life WITH such a ""princess"" bitch would be a frigging nightmare.  Instead... I'd be willing to bet that THIS particular match has a decent chance (in fact probably better than average) of being a GOOD one -- at the risk of sounding ""sappy"", they can and probably WILL actually love each other for who they REALLY are; will grow old together, have a happy life, and probably even raise a couple of pretty solid kids (though of course these days there's no guarantee of the latter REGARDLESS of who the parents are).    * No amount of ""lifting"" is gonna fix this guy's face (only double-digit thousands of dollars in plastic surgery & jaw/dental work -- and probably a year {or more} worth of intense PAIN -- would make him look ""normal"").  Yeah, he (and she) could definitely improve other aspects of their physical appearance, and likewise with their clothing (better fitting, something more ""stylish"").  BUT WHO THE FUCK CARES?  Seriously. That is all ridiculous superficial shit -- and if each of THEM think that their spouse is attractive ""as is"" -- well, that's all that really matters.  ** And ask yourself WHY that is sometime.  I think the answer actually IS based on their appearance -- they're not ""perfect pretty princess"" so people DON'T (and won't, EVER) just ""give"" them things for no reason based on how they look -- nope, they have to acquire and bring at least SOME skills/effort and/or ""value"" that is OTHER than being ""pretty""."

MGTOW,3b5a7r,flyingwolf,3,Fri Jun 26 14:53:23 2015 UTC,"Looks only get you so far.   From what I've seen in life... part of the problem is that their LOOKS often get a LOT of people a lot further than it should...  It gets people promoted into positions that they really CAN'T handle.  It get's them USED to attention that they really don't deserve.  I turns them into ""entitled"" little whiney-arsed people... especially when (as eventually happens) their ""looks"" start to fade.  Every single so called ""hot"" looking person I have ever known -- female OR male -- seems to end up creating a fuckton of drama, chaos and misery around them.  And I can't help but think that a BIG part of, possibly the ROOT of the problems is actually their ""good looks"".  By contrast, take someone who is otherwise fairly nice looking, but throw in some visible scar, or a crossed-eye or squint, or even some unsightly mole or skin discoloration on their face (or some other thing that they need to overcome/compensate for) -- and generally speaking you probably end up with a much HIGHER QUALITY person, than you will with someone that won the ""perfect"" genetic lottery.   If you are going to be married, find someone you can spend 10 days in a car with and not want to run away from.   You said it.  Stick a bag over their head (and/or boobs, etc) -- draw an ugly face on it...  and then spend several HOURS in their company.  If your mind is concluding that ""gawd they're self centered"" (or boring or whatever) or worse it's screaming ""how the hell do I get away from this person"" -- then you definitely don't want to BE with that person for very long, much less marry them.   There is a song from the 60s I believe, ""if you wanna be happy for the rest of your life, helps to make an ugly woman your wife"".

Well, maybe its a sign that she's a REALLY good cook, and can bake up amazing things... or on the opposite side, maybe she's fat because she eats a horrible diet of fast food, junk food, and doughnuts from the store.  Sometimes pictures DO tell a story... and sometimes we impose entirely false stories onto pictures.    EDIT: And yeah I realize that sometimes I'm personally guilty of the same kind of superficiality in a different manner -- assuming that some chick who dresses like a ""slut"" actually IS a ""slut"".  But I'm also basing that conclusion on experience... the vast majority of women I have known who DO dress that ""slutty"" way, well if/when you get to know them you find out that yes indeed the packaging matched the content.   EDIT 2: Plus a further thought on the judging of superficial things ""slut"" related.  The critique of the woman in the photo above is that she is INEPT at it all, i.e. she's ""botched"" the fashion and/or has no ""taste"" (in line with current styles/ideals).  By contrast, the ""slutty"" women that *I* am talking about (and judging as ""slutty"") generally do quite an expert job with their appearance -- at least while they are young -- there is a particular ""look"" that they are trying to achieve, and they typically practice at it and SUCCEED; they succeed at purposefully creating the appearance of being a ""down to fuck whore"".  So when I ""judge"" them as such, I'm really just coming to the conclusion that they apparently WANT me to arrive at; I'm actually acknowledging their achievement."

MGTOW,3b2dt7,PartlyMe,2,Sat Jun 27 08:25:19 2015 UTC,"...with one difference being that a sexbot would offer most (or all) of the advantages and none of the disadvantages!   If you view it ONLY from the ""biological/hormone"" driven need to orgasm, yes.  And no doubt a very BIG component of ""sex"" is in fact that -- especially in younger people.  But that is far from the totality of it... at least when it comes to humans, we have layers of psychological needs for ""intimacy/caring"" that have been built up, and which are in fact very ""real"" even though they ""exist only in the mind"".     Are you honestly saying that you would have zero interest in an anatomically perfect sexbot in the shape of the hottest female you've ever seen, with her voice and natural mannerisms but without any of the associated nonsense...?   At this point in my life (50+ years old), yes I can actually say that.  Moreover I think it -- the change from a simple physical desire for a ""hot piece of ass"" to the desire for a ""help-mate"" and ""companionship"" (i.e. actual REAL conversation, not vapid superficial inanities) -- is part of the way we are ""constructed"" to become as we age (whether you want to attribute that to some teleological cause, or some evolutionary result).  I think it -- the change in focus as we age -- is similar to what happens at other earlier stages in life, to wit:  Per example, young boys -- across the majority of if not the entire prepubescent age range from infancy to approx 11, 12, to 13+ yrs of age -- generally not only show little interest in females their own age (or younger), but actually have a natural disgust or distaste for and a notable aversion to their company (unless, and often even in spite of the fact that girls are the only companionship available) -- instead they tend to prefer either their own gender-age companions, OR they seek out and follow after OLDER boys and men.    At the risk of creating (yet another) ""just so story""... well, from an ""evo-psych"" perspective it makes complete & total sense.  Why? Well because the young male human is not yet ""fertile"" expressing an interest in or spending any of his time or resources on females (generally speaking equally infertile) -- would have (at that stage in his development) ZERO ""survival"" value.    By contrast, learning about the physical world around him, both other animals (and little boys are extremely interested in all kinds of ""beasts"", real or imagined, predator or prey), as well as the tools to deal with them -- hence the very common passion for ""weapons"" of any kind among young males, doesn't matter if it is a spear or a bow & arrow, or a slingshot, or some form of ""gun"" (again real or imagined).  The make child is almost instinctively drawn to learning the kinds of skills, and training his mind and senses -- especially things like hand-eye coordination, and ""leading a target"" -- that have to do with either hunting (being the predator) and/or fighting/defense & even camouflage (preventing oneself from becoming the prey).  All of THAT -- which also translates into various ""sports"" by the way -- is of pre-eminent value in terms of his survival AND his maturation.  If you don't learn to hunt (and survive being hunted), then you're not going to LIVE long enough to reproduce and care for (much less feed & defend) your own children (at least not ""human"" children with large brains and ""apex"" food chain status).  Ergo the acquisition of those skills -- and the almost obsessive interest in them -- is a sort of pre-programmed ""pre-requisite"".  Unless & until the boy learns them, any attention paid to females would be pointless... there is ZERO species survival value in ""dry humping"" a female (a task that really requires a minimal amount of training or intelligence -- even very tiny-brained creatures are capable of ""fucking"" without the need for practice OR instruction).  But by the time puberty sets in... well the equation has changed. The boy is now sufficiently trained and skilled (or generally speaking ought to be if he hasn't been artificially inhibited & prevented from learning), as well as having attained a physical size & stature/musculature & performance abilities (notably ""speed & agility"" -- ever try to catch a 13 year old boy? Egads... a 20+ year old man may be stronger & faster & greater endurance, but will generally be far less ""quick"" in terms of agility, reflexes, etc -- it's counter-balanced by greater muscle mass & power & knowledge)... but the point is, having a few 13 to 14 year old boys on your ""hunting team"", well they have a unique value all their own; they can and do ""fit in"" as a productive & potentially competent (even important) member of a society/community.  And moreover, the needs of any offspring they might now have (now that they are capable), well infants and small children -- especially say under the age of 5 -- CAN be effectively ""fathered"" (fed & defended & guided) by a male youth in their teen years.  The children really only need a larger/more powerful ""adult male father""  when they themselves begin to grow larger (i.e. > 5 years old in turn).  BIOLOGICALLY speaking, our species is ""primed"" to be able to recover (at least in terms of its numbers) RELATIVELY quickly from any major ""disaster"" -- quite literally a male could be a ""Grandfather"" as young as his mid 20's (and yet still actively fathering more of his own children). Yet we are also ""primed"" to DELAY having offspring for a decade+ after our birth -- until sufficient intellectual and ""skill"" acquisition have been completed (earlier/younger age reproduction in primates is definitely possible... but only with a comparative LOW cognitive & skill development -- basically ""apes"" rather than ""homo sapiens"").  OK... so that's those TWO aspects of human ""development"".  The question is then... what of the ""older"" people?  What value do they bring, and how has ""survival"" in terms of groups altered the ""priming"" of ""focus"" as we age.  Too many people when it comes to ""evolution"" have rather FAR too narrow of a focus -- they see ONLY to the point of the sexual act or reproduction (i.e. the BIRTH of the offspring).  That is -- again -- relevant and true of the ""lower"" forms of life, the species that have OTHER  mechanisms of survival (chief among which is having large ""litters"" of offspring -- not a ""serial"" production-line, but rather a mass-parallel ""batch"" process; with very little {if any} ""parenting"").  So long as the salmon can survive to spawn... the rest of it's life (if any) is irrelevant.  Not so with humans.  We MUST acquire the skills, the knowledge -- and that requires being kept ""safe"", being fed, defended, and nurtured along the way.  The larger and DEEPER the surrounding society of other (older) humans, the greater the extent of that safety-zone for the (relatively low number of) children to survive.  Ergo the society of humans who KEEPS a (relatively) large number of older, more experienced and ""wiser"" (the ""sapiens"" in homo sapiens means ""wise""), capable of relating stories, etc -- THAT community is far more likely to survive the host of varying problems it is going to encounter; is likely to build up a much larger ""safety factor"" in terms of skills, knowledge, etc.  But WHAT specifically are the ""talents"" and ""focus"" of those older men (and older women)?  What would it be that evolution would ""favor"" the retention of?  Would it be sheer promiscuity?  Well, really among human males, of what value would that be? Some 60+ 70+ or even 80+ year old Hugh Hefner going around impregnating large numbers of young women is actually more likely to cause PROBLEMS (competitors for his prior offspring in terms of the attention/guidance they need) than it is to help nurture an increasingly sophisticated ""civilization"".  No, what evolution is then likely to favor is that it's older members CHANGE focus, that they be ""primed"" to alter their priorities -- from that of ""humping"" -- to a desire for intimacy, companionship, cooperation, to coordinate and lead TEAMS of people, plan for the future (expand the community, it's needs, etc).  Now that's not to say that ALL humans will experience that kind of change, or that they will express it in the same manner.  Often this can be ""frustrating"" to specific individuals -- especially in a society that has become so large & sophisticated that it artificially CONSTRAINS what it's members can/cannot do.  And there IS positive purpose in that by the way, the ""constraints"" imposed by ""the patriarchy"" on both teenage and especially FEMALE sexuality & reproduction are in fact NOT ""arbitrary"" -- nor is their purpose to be ""oppressive"" without some underlying rationale as the feminists & post-modernist bullshit claims -- rather they have SPECIFIC purposes & goals in terms of maintaining a relatively STABLE population growth curve, a STABLE society. The reason that ""patriarchal"" societies became predominant was essentially the result of ""evolutionary"" pressures -- those societies which constrained teen & female sex & reproduction in an appropriate manner to the context surrounding them were (generally speaking) simply and vastly MORE RESILIENT than societies that DIDN'T place such constraints (i.e. ""social constructs/rules/roles"").  If other forms of ""society"" had been better suited... then those forms would have become PREDOMINANT.   But they didn't.    All of which is a really LONG winded answer... the point of which is that, AS YOU AGE, you are in fact very likely to change your focus... and while ""hot babes"" (or ""cute young females"") may still tickle your fancy from time to time... well, it is also likely to be a bit less intense, and more ephemeral and fleeting, and the desire for that becomes significant ""tempered"" by other DEEPER desires and needs (which -- in the full meaning of the word ""mature"", or ""more mature"" aka as yet another older/aged stage in a sequential series of maturation phases -- can be literally named as such)."

All while nearly biting off their own tongues trying not to mention the word herbivore. Newsflash to the news, you can't talk about the Japanese issues of low birth-rate, negative population growth, and the gender disconnect without talking about the herbivore men. I think it genuinely terrifies them that men are saying ""since the game is rigged I won't play""."
MGTOW,3b2dt7,laudomatic,-6,Thu Jun 25 14:59:36 2015 UTC,"Blame? This is a complex social issue which cannot be reduced to blame and which this report is not trying to. Not mentioning the word herbivore also doesn't seem to be so bad, as this is the coined term for this japanese phenomenon (and not derogatory).   ""since the game is rigged I won't play""   Not what the interviewee is saying.  There is no spin here, you are seeing your own agenda."
MGTOW,3b2dt7,flodereisen,10,Thu Jun 25 17:07:54 2015 UTC,I disagree: it seems like bad reporting to do this entire story and not even MENTION the herbivore phenomenon.

This report in particular only mildly blames through implication, and it does look like there is an element of shame and blame intended.  My primary critique is about the media in general, but several portions of this video fall in line with the trend. The report is too busy painting the picture that the aforementioned social problems are largely explained away due to (what they have characterized as essentially) socially inept aging virgins who pine away at their inability to score some poon. Who pathetically spend their time drawing nude muses just for the chance to get within sniffing distance of a live muff.  I think there is indeed spin going on here, because they have put forward the idea that if these virgins could start learning how to get laid it might cure many of the social ills of Japan. It is  sloppy reporting to discuss the Japanese gender divide without mentioning the Herbivores Men and the Dried Fish Ladies, especially the fact that there are intentional members of both groups. I never said herbivore was a derogatory term, I pointed out that the media tends to avoid talking about them even in places where they are obviously relevant. (Much like when the media talks about the declining rate of marriage in the western world they predominantly tend to avoid talking about the reasons we often cite here; and instead blame and shame men as immature, unsuccessful  and/or otherwise undesirable). Call it an agenda if you will, but to me it was merely an observation. If I wanted to push some MGTOW agenda in society I'd find a more effective congregation to preach the good message to than the MGTOW subreddit."
MGTOW,3b2dt7,laudomatic,-8,Thu Jun 25 18:35:27 2015 UTC,I did exactly get your point; that is what I am refuting. In no way does the report imply that they are socially inept - just romantically/sexually so.   And shifting the blame onto men seems silly when you consider that the number of herbivore women between 16-19 is 59%. You need more than one person (of traditionally more than one gender) to have a relationship.   Who pathetically spend their time drawing nude muses just for the chance to get within sniffing distance of a live muff.   There are a lot more appropriate services in Japan if that was their goal.   because they have put forward the idea that if these virgins could start learning how to get laid it might cure many of the social ills of Japan   And it would! Sex is one of the most intense ways of bonding between mammals. Oxytocin is not to be underestimated.   I pointed out that the media tends to avoid talking about them even in places where they are obviously relevant.   But the whole report was about them! They just didn't use the term.

They just didn't use the term     This report is mostly about men who want to be with a woman but don't know how, which is not very characteristic of the herbivores I've read about.

There are also lots of older women (Japanese included) working at the Soaplands because they have gotten stuck in very difficult situations (owe money to loan sharks, single mother, etc).   Simply put, an attractive Japanese woman doesn't need to have sex with a man to actually get money from him. Do a Google search for キャバクラ meaning cabaret club (hostess bar) and you'll see what I mean. For women who don't want to do that, there's always the option to be a housewife or live with your parents forever."

Every situation is different of course so I don't want to imply that all establishments are like this.  Buyer beware for anyone going to Soaplands or places like it. If you go in there knowing what you're likely to get, then you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a Japanese girl, you're likely not to get one, but if you do, she won't be what you're after in terms of looks/age. Overall girls range from unattractive to average. Beautiful women don't need to do that kind of job to make money.  Going back to your original comment:   Id be happy to bang a cute Japanese girl a few times a month for $300.    I highly recommend dating websites/apps."

MGTOW,3b2dt7,rKremlin,2,Fri Jun 26 01:09:52 2015 UTC,"It depends.  Some men might be raised with more traditional or provincial notions about prostitution, whether it's religious/moral concerns or the idea that a man can't be a ""real man"" if he has to pay for it.  It's much the same mentality about male virgins, that they can't be ""real men.""  So, it might be seen as a lose-lose proposition either way."
MGTOW,3b2dt7,ValleyFever101,5,Thu Jun 25 18:16:40 2015 UTC,Thats generally not the attitude in Japan.  Even the prostitutes arent ashamed or embarrassed about what they do.  The men even less so. Puritanical views of sex is typically a western foible.

The video makes it as if the dudes are just some socially inept, desperate males but completely ignores the fact that the females too don't want to be in relationships. A lot of it is both men and women choosing not to date or have a committed relationship not because they are too inept to do so but because they believe the cost outweighs the benefit. The women are all for feminism and all that jazz and would rather be the ""working modern woman"" rather than the traditional housewife. This also raises their standards because now the average working dude isn't enough for those types of women leading even average males to be rejected more than usual. It is kind of like online dating but in real life. As the cost to that game gets too high, the Japanese males wisely figure out going MGTOW is best."

MGTOW,3b2dt7,MaunaLoona,2,Sun Jun 28 09:48:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Especially since it really isn't a ladder -- it's more of a treadmill on a slope, or a downward running escalator -- attempting to climb it really doesn't get you anywhere.  The most orgasmic, euphoric ""high"" feeling -- regardless of whether it comes from winning some game, or making some purchase, or engaging in some risky ""sport"" or activity or ________, or shooting/taking some drug -- whatever it is, it will nevertheless be a temporary thing.  Frequently it will be unrepeatable (at least as the intense experience it once was), but even if repeatable, it cannot be continuous (i.e. without interruption)...  And ironically even if it were... well the effect -- the novelty, the ""thrill"" of something that is experienced continually taper or wears off, and it soon becomes a rather banal thing.  If you LIVE on a mountaintop, well it fairly soon ceases to really BE (to you) what a ""mountaintop"" is to others, all too often, especially if you focus on it to the negation of everything else, you quickly become accustomed to, even bored with, the experience of the ""view"".  And of the course the problems that people create in their own lives if and when they obsessively seek to recreate some previous ""high"" -- well the morgues, hospital rooms, and courts are filled with the fallout from that.  Wise people learn something about that at a relatively early age -- and instead of focusing on and obsessing over trying to obtain or repeat such a ""high"" -- they take a more serendipitous view of life: the peaks & highs aren't necessarily to be avoided, you can certainly enjoy them if & when they happen; but minimizing the valleys, the depths of despair is actually FAR more intelligent, and a general ""contentment"" is probably going to lead to a far more fulfilling and ""pleasurable"" overall life."

My neighbors dog fucks bitches (and really anything he can hump) on a regular basis.  Does that make his dog a ""man""?  Seriously, you're sounding like an 18 year old 'boy' who is trying to figure out what can make him a 'man' -- and he reduces it down to 'well if I successfully fuck a woman, THEN I'll be a man' -- so he DESPERATELY goes out and does that...  Only it doesn't work. Afterward, he STILL ""feels"" like a little boy.  So he tries again... maybe if this time she's a 'hotter/sluttier' girl/woman... you know one of those big-boobed, make-up caked, slinky-dress wearing bar sluts the TRP'ers call 'high SMV' (even though they're actually LOW SMV, like a carousel ride that sells tickets for $1 a round)...

IMO means 'In my Opinion' - can I have my own opinion on this? thank you.   also 'you need to learn your scars from women' - if somebody's experience when going MGTOW is based on fairy tales then how u can be sure if that person does not have underlying feeling that he still want to check 'how they (women) are'?  also, I added 'you might become'.  But of course nobody cares. I don't need to figure out what it means to be a man, but if a 18yo 'boy' states that well he is a virgin and he goes MGTOW because he read few posts here and there then I'd say it's just funny. Why? For the reasons I listed above.   There is a difference between being a virgin who always wanted to get a girl but can't and so he 'went MGTOW' and a dude who slept with let's say 10 girls, been in 5 relationships and learned everything there is about female psychology and then decided to go MGTOW. (these numbers are just an example, FYI :P )  I know what you're trying to say but I can't relate to this. Maybe this is how it works with boys nowadays. I don't know that. Can't relate.   Being a man is a sum of experiences that are all added together to build one's emotional maturity. And this also includes learning about interactions between genders, whether you like it or not. The fact that someone learns, experiences and decides afterwards that he can't be blue piller/white knight/strong beta (or what have you) but instead goes MGTOW makes much more sense to me.

In previous eras in history, a man had to go off to fight in wars or be branded a ""coward"" or worse.  Joe Pesci said in Casino ""If you were a real man, you'd be out stealing.""  That's one step away from the ultimate test of ""real manhood,"" which I won't elaborate on.

MGTOW,3b2dt7,razikain,2,Sat Jun 27 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"you need to learn your scars with women, really   I've seen people getting shot. I don't need to get shot myself to know it's not really a very pleasant and healthy thing."
MGTOW,3b3fc8,Morranaii,15,Thu Jun 25 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"She sort of NEGATES her own point, right in one paragraph, to wit:   And while the idea of trusting your partner to take responsibility for something that affects your body is scary - it's important to remember that pregnancy impacts upon both parties' futures. After all, if we're ever going to attain - and maintain - gender equality, then it's absolutely crucial that we stop considering parenthood as something that matters to women more than men. Plus, there would be nothing to stop you from continuing with your usual form of contraception at the same time to be doubly safe.   That LAST bold point demonstrates the hypocrisy. You'll note that while she states (in the first bold point above) the ""scary"" aspect in a gender ambiguous way... it's obvious that this is (at best) a ""new"" thought on her part...  That having to ""trust"" your partner (in the past, and in fact still currently) is being ""responsible"" in taking birth control -- that it is EXTREMELY ""scary"" and in fact VERY ""risky"".    But hilariously... it is only NOW -- when the situation will no longer be subject to their single-direction/single-sided arbitrary control -- that women are SUDDENLY realizing there is [some kind of] a ""trust"" component.  And of course... HOW does she construe it?  Well as if women were suddenly the potential ""victims"" of irresponsible men.  She doesn't consider that there are STILL a shitload of other ""trust"" issues...  No, I think what she is REALLY concerned about, but is too afraid to state, well it ends up going UNMENTIONED in the entire article: Namely that with ""male birth control"" women will no longer be able to pull the age-old ""cuckold trick"" so successfully.    It will NOW be possible for MEN to effectively BLOCK & COUNTER & LAUGH at that bullshit."
MGTOW,3b3fc8,thrownaway_MGTOW,2,Thu Jun 25 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"well, you can also think that it would not change anything as women will say 'I don't trust you and I won't have sex with you unless (you marry me)'. I am sure that they will have a ready solution to this even before male contraception will be ready. They must be thinking about this even now. :)) But I can only hope and support such projects. Believing that it will end the long term absurdity of female domination in our society (whilst pretending it's all the way around).  Maybe then they will start going to males NOT using the contraception and try to put an idea into our minds that 'only a true MEN won't be afraid of making a girl pregnant?' Who knows?! We all know how many tactics and emotional manipulation techniques females are using right now on us. Do we really think they won't try anything like this to win the situation for themselves?  Can you see the big crowd of manginas/white knights/blue pillers rushing with their resources and willing to impregnate any given girl to prove how big men they are? Because I can."

Either everything goes, or you have to ban certain types of speech. It's obvious if you're going to use racial slurs and use low class language people are going to respond, and if you block out the responses (and even if you don't) people will be driven away.  There is no excuse to use racial slurs and divide the community. There are not many of us to begin with, and our concerns go beyond race.   I for one will stand against the mindlessly racial post, and I personally suggest you don't bring up the ""rules"" and try to silence someone that protests it.   Class matters.

Men are stepped on, and treated as disposable utilities. Therefore I don't play that game.  The solution to this problem isn't more inequality. You're effectively doing the same thing feminists do, by saying certain behaviour is unacceptable for women, but acceptable for men.  There is of course inequality in ""hookups"", and the fundamental problem is in that inequality. Women have a much easier time if they want to have casual sex with a man. They simply throw themselves at whoever they want to have sex with, with a much higher success rate.  Men on the other hand, have to do an elaborate song and dance, to demonstrate value, to make themselves appear ""alpha"".  That's the fundamental inequality, and shaming promiscuity is counter productive.  It may be naive of me to think that this is a problem that can be fixed, but we certainly won't get anywhere without identifying the fundamental issues."

MGTOW,3b0sh7,Asari_Lover,2,Thu Jun 25 13:54:52 2015 UTC,"I grew up with an avid interest in politics, although I leaned more towards the Democrats in my younger days.  My maternal grandfather was a lifelong Democrat going back before FDR, and he always said that the Democrats were the party of the working man.  But they're not really that anymore.    My father and pretty much his entire side of the family were staunch Republicans from the upper Midwest.  Very conservative and devoutly religious.  But they shared quite a bit in common with the Democrats of their generation in terms of traditional values and self-reliance.  They had low tolerance for bums, slackers, or anyone who didn't take responsibility for their own choices.    There was also nothing about being a Democrat which automatically made one into a ""peacenik"" or a ""bleeding heart liberal.""  That stuff came later.  They may be politically left of the Republicans, but ""left"" can be manifested in many different ways.    The Republicans also have an uneasy coalition of Bible Belt traditionalists, Cold War militarists/interventionists, and Wall Street capitalists/globalists who don't always see eye to eye on things.    The Democrats also have some challenges.  While it's true that feminists typically back the Democrats, they also have a great deal of support from black and Hispanic communities where their religious communities tend to be more socially conservative.    I don't think it does any good to not vote at all.  At least show up at the polls and turn in a ballot - even you turn it in blank.  Write in ""Chuck U. Farley"" for every office up for election.  It's also good to keep one's registration active to be able to vote in primaries and on ballot propositions.  Jury pools are also picked out of the voter rolls."

MGTOW,3b0sh7,firstpitchthrow,0,Fri Jun 26 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"I consider myself left of center.  I used to be a liberal, and I'm not anymore.  I'm probably going to vote for Clinton for president in 2016, because I don't believe her current feminists rhetoric and because, right now, Hillary seems like the only adult in the room.  I have lots of problems with her a wide range of policies (I think she's too close to wall street) but I don't see anyone else whose grown-up enough to be president.  Rubio, Paul, Cruz, Warren, Sanders, Bush, Walker, Jindal, you're telling me any of those clowns should be allowed to sniff a higher political office than they one they have right now?  At least Hillary is experienced, knows what the job will entail, and has a background to draw from.  That's better than what everyone else has.    The thing you have to understand about both parties is that they are a veneer.  There is not ""GOP"" just like there is not ""Democrats"".  Doesn't exist.  The two parties platforms are very much alike, and the biggest differences are on social issues (hint: its because social issues are easier to explain, and more emotional, than other issues are.  ""They're going to kill babies!"" is a much better rallying point then ""we're going to grow the deficit two percent above GDP"") On most issues, there are sub-groups who are trying to push the main party one way or another.  Politicos try to appeal to those sub-groups, without actually doing anything (its called ""pandering"") to get a vote.    The thing to understand is that most of these sub-groups are crazy.  People who devote their lives to politics are insane by definition, does a $10,000 dollar a plate stale chicken dinner fundraiser sound like your idea of a fun Saturday night?  The national party knows that most of its most partisan members are cuckoo for cocoa puffs, so the national party tries to adopt a platform, and deliver the message that they aren't crazy.  Anything insane is filtered out, agendas are set by elites and corporations, and that's how you get a platform.  Problem is, the rank and file grassroots are unbelieveably powerful, and the corporations don't control them nearly as much as they would like to.  In nominating contests, the crazies are the ones who choose the candidates.  That's why Hillary sounds nuts right now, she has to.  The difference between her and the GOP and Warren and Sanders is that those other guys sound nuts 24/7.  That's why I'm taking my chances with Hillary.    The most fun thing, about politics, for me, is that I don't have a horse in the race.  I'm persuadable.  I used to side with the dems, and they've pissed me off in recent years.  I have no more loyalty to the party.  A sane GOP candidate would get my vote.  When you don't have a horse in the race (ie a team that you root for) you can sit back and enjoy the crazy.  These people try to keep it under wraps so much, but every so often, they'll slip and they'll write something that reflects how they really feel by mistake.    Feminists want to end the family, as an American institution, just like Republicans want to end Social Security as an institution.   Both positions are utterly toxic, because both institutions have a 99% approval rating in mainstream American life.  They're roughly one tier below ""cute puppies"", ""whiskers on kittens"" and ""Riley Curry"" in unassailable popular.   The GOP wants to cut taxes on the super-rich and raise taxes on everyone else, the Democrats want to build a welfare state like Europe.  The American voter will vote down both positions by over 9 to 1 margins.  Only the looney toonies actually believe this rubbish.  Unfortunately, they're the parties' base voters.  So, the idea is to implement these policies quietly, while publically repudiating them.  Only it doesn't always work, and sometimes, someone who didn't get the ""its a secret"" memo will say something they aren't supposed to.    Hearing a feminist openly argue for the destruction of the family is funny, because they aren't supposed to say that.  If people knew that was what feminists actually believed, their market share would go from ""falling"" (which it is right now) to ""in the dumpster"".  My sister is a staunch feminist and she hasn't yet been told about the secret handshake (""destroy the family, because its the tool of the patriarchy"")  I know my sister is indoctrinated, but I know that if she knew that was the goal of the movement, she would flee in terror.  A lot of people would.  Problem is, she won't believe it coming from me.  It would do no good if I told her.    At the end of the day, believe whatever you want to, politically.  Being  democrat doesn't mean your a feminists.  There are lots of other policy platforms under the democratic tent to choose from.  In much the same way that being a Republican doesn't make you a Southern Racist.  At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter, as both parties agree on most things."

I don't want to elect someone who believed in gay marriage 40 years ago, I want someone who ""evolved"" on the issue in the last three years.  Why?  because ideology is dangerous.  It blinds you to options and ideas that can succeed.    Dems are fools.  They've been trying for universal health care since Teddy Roosevelt.  Everytime they tried, it blew up on them.  Obama got it done by knowing what he thought was right (universal coverage) and then he did it in the confines of what was possible (using RomneyCare, a GOP idea).  Sanders is single payer.  He may believe it, but he'll never get anyone to vote for it, even other dems.  Elect President Sanders, and you'll get four years of nothing happening, and things only going backwards.

Within the past decade, several of my old classmates, all of whom had wives that cheated on them (as it was later revealed, some for several years & with multiple guys) and who they separated from -- i.e. hubby moved out (in most of them were essentially ""thrown out"") leaving her in possession/occupation of the house (in one case the most recent BF moved in ASAP, though hubby didn't find out until months later), etc. -- well, every single one of them, they (husband) eventually did the actual ""filing"" for divorce, generally a year or more after they separated.  I seriously think the women didn't file themselves not only because it would be a big hassle, but because there was just ZERO incentive for the women to do so; and in fact there was every incentive for them to delay it -- each of these guys was either working hard/getting promoted, or they owned growing businesses, so the longer the formal ""division of property"" was delayed, well the more they were worth, and the more the woman ended up getting out of the deal (while also being entirely ""free"" to screw whoever they liked, AND be in charge of the home, etc).  And of course despite the fact that ""officially"" it was the men who filed, everyone who knew them knew it was the WIFE that was the root cause (and I'm not saying that just because I know these guys, truth is a couple of them are real ""douchebags"" and I never really liked them).  Point being that even while that is ""anecdote""... well that's too many cases for them all to be ""extreme outliers"".  I figure it indicates that at least somewhere around half of those ""men filed"" divorces have direct female causation -- i.e. NONE of them were the so called ""classic"" divorce that feminists like to claim of middle-aged hubby trading the wife in on a younger model; they were all basically the opposite of that -- it was the wife who did the trade-in; most of these guys were devastated and generally didn't even think about dating until a year after their divorce was finalized.   Alas, none of them seemed to have really learned anything though, and they basically all eventually shacked up with or married another woman again (divorced/single mom = insta-family) a few years later.   It worked for me too because I was able to keep the lawyers away from my divorce,    You got lucky there... that probably saved you some SERIOUS cash."

I figure it indicates that at least somewhere around half of those ""men filed"" divorces have direct female causation     I bet you are right, and maybe even underestimating. As for the wife cheating and moving the boyfriend in, I have seen that so many times; it happened to two of my brothers, several close friends, a good dozen acquaintances, and I can't even count how many people in the military I saw rip through that cycle only to step right back into repeating it.

Don't let them guilt trip you on that.  First of all, stop and think abut how LITTLE space those things actually take up (seriously, how much space did they take up when new? and remember trash gets compacted/compressed in the garbage trucks).   Plus, what are we talking for totals here...  How many are you (as a single guy, no kids, no kid parties, none of the other bullshit) going to use in a year? in your entire LIFE?  Now, compare that to the typical married couple; who will probably put more paper plates/plastic forks than you could use in a year into the landfill from just the serving of the CAKE at their WEDDING (not to mention all the rest of the garbage from that event, we're talking several bins worth); or alternately just from one of their kids birthday parties (again, lots of other waste).    And that's not to mention all of the other garbage that families (& especially women in them) generate.   Talk to any garbage collection guy, and he will tell you that he KNOWS not only when people are on vacation & stuff, but also when a ""single guy"" lives in a particular house (or even more obviously when a couple gets divorced and hubby gets the house somehow instead of his wife) -- because it's obvious as all get out -- instead of a set of full/overflowing bins every week that is typical of households with females, the bin is probably only set out once a month (if that), and even then it's half empty.  Keep in mind, most garbage comes from ""packaging"", and most packaging comes from two sources: so called ""convenience"" foods (fast food, take-away, canned and prepackaged dinners); and from ""consumer goods"" (the lion's share of which are predominately sold to women and kids). It's not that men CAN'T generate that kind of garbage, they can and do in fits and spurts... but long term bachelors generally just tend to not create very much."

I feel no remorse in letting the SO do some household chores whilst I handle the car maintenance and fix shit around the home.  Need I mention that I make 3x what she does income wise? and work longer hours? So what is wrong with equitable contributions to the household? I feel I am still on the short end of that stick.  I honestly think the way to fix this would be to have these married couples maintain separate bank accounts and both have to contribute evenly to the expenses of running  /supporting the home. The extra $$ left over should be kept by that person for their own use. This will eliminate the 80% spending these woman do I'd bet.  I am sure the guys would do 50% of the house work in this case and the woman would complain that the main needs to contribute more to the home ($$). Gold diggers can be identified this way.  I think this would also remove some of the cash and prizes from the divorce since the assets would remain isolated from the onset (bank accounts always separate). I would also keep the home separate (purchase prior to marriage), thus not be a marital asset, and charge her rent for living in your home, have her sign a lease, lol, I wonder how that would go over?  These idiots should be careful for what they ask for as this will impact the economy more than they realize."

Her looks are not the problem, as there are plenty of girls who look far worse.    Her problem is that she's a 4 on the hot scale, and a Tilt on the crazy scale.  It goes to 10, but for her, it just keeps on going until it reaches escape velocity and breaks away from earth orbit to head to parts unknown.

All of this is designed to make you soft on the inside and hard on the outside. Be careful."
MGTOW,3av19n,SergeantDickhead,10,Tue Jun 23 20:40:30 2015 UTC,"I'm struggling to handle the emotions I'm having about her.   This means you are human and have a heart, this doesn't mean your are weak if you know how to handle it and don't let others use your own programming tools to their advantage.. Don't argue with these feelings, as it is like fighting an army because the king is corrupt. Killing army men is useless- as you need to attack this at its source. The King.  Masturbate a few times then think back to these emotional triggers. They will be gone (and possibly you will be disgusted for allowing these intruding thoughts).  Still feel that being with this person is a good idea even after masturbation? Imagine a con artist thief running you through their best manipulation tactics to get something of yours. The objective isn't to make you believe their idea, it is to implant that you came up with the idea on your own. It's hard to disagree with a thought that you ""came"" up with in your own head. Women are master manipulators.  To deny our own impulses, is to deny the very thing that makes us human. To act upon impulses is what parallels us to Monkeys. We must show that we can think logically and stop going backwards in evolution. Take control of your own mind and you can forever profit.

MGTOW,3av19n,joblessguy10,8,Wed Jun 24 07:22:39 2015 UTC,"I've had a couple of these damaging experiences with women (both traditionalist Iraqi in case some lurkers believe only White American women are like that) that I was attracted to. They were attractive and had the facade of a good NAWALT personality, not to mention religious.  One of these girls shut me down because I was short and said that I may have a small penis (probably because I was short; talk about being ""religious""). After weeks and months of trying to be attractive to her, I quit talking to her for about 8 months, when out of the blue, she contacted me. After texting and talking with me for about two weeks, she disappeared instantaneously. That was in late 2007. One day in late 2011, I found out she was married and had a child. Did that bother me? Fuck no. If she came knocking today, I wouldn't even throw a glance in her direction. If she called out, ""Hey, JoblessGuy! OMG is that you?"", I'll just walk away without even acknowledging her presence.  You should know that if there is no sex, she probably wants to just talk or get something out of you. Sex is an extremely important sign that indicates that women see you as a sexual being and as likely partner, and of fit genetic material. Sex entails trust and attraction. She isn't attracted to you sexually and physically and at the very best see you only as a utility.    My advice is to stop talking to her cold turkey, because you'll waste your time chasing your own feelings and the dream that something might happen."

If you want to have sex with her, nothing wrong with that.  Next time you meet up with her--after you settle-in with some simple chit chat--look her in the eye and say:  ""Hey, I think its important as a man to not waste my time or yours. So I'm going to ask you straight up. Are you attracted to me beyond friends? If you aren't I get it and that's fine, but the bottom line is, I don't want or need a friend that I'm sexually attracted to, because frankly, its a royal pain in the ass, so, what's your answer?""  If she says ""no, I'm not attracted to you beyond friends,""  look her in the eye, shake her hand, thank her for being honest, and walk  the f**k away.  Even if she says ""no"" and you walk away, don't be surprised if you here from her at a later time that she's re-thought her position. Women drool over confidence, and nothing is more confident than showing her you can just walk the f**k away.

MGTOW,3av6zr,oldredder,3,Wed Jun 24 06:38:02 2015 UTC,"Same with me. I stopped watching TV a long time ago. I used to just watch sports, but the commercials just became too unbearable. The TV is worthless. The added effect is that you save a ton of money not paying for cable either.   The only sports I watch now are the NBC streams, because you can start watching them an hour or so later and they take out commercials, so you just skip past the ad breaks. I wish all the networks had that same type of stream, but I guess I barely care about sports now. Only watched the Stanley Cup Finals pretty much off NBC, and that's it for as long as I can remember now.  I have AdBlock and NoScript as well. I don't visit too many internet sites either. I've been using AdBlock since back with the Kerio Firewall that had that feature, late it became Sun before they stopped making it, and now the browsers have had adblock for the longest time. I find using the internet without AdBlock unbearable. Most sites do have tons of obnoxious ads, and what's worse is many of the ads will have spyware or viruses. This is a major reason most people have so many computer problems.   I mostly read books, including the Bible. The truly great part of the internet is the access to information. Project Gutenberg is excellent, although TPP is trying to remove access to most of this stuff.   There is also Japanese anime and manga, there's a lot to choose from and some is good if you really need something to pass time. American media has not produced anything worthwhile even as pure entertainment since Seinfeld, which itself was very immoral too (but at least it was funny). That was a long time ago. You can easily just ignore TV and movies.  The Star Wars film that will come out later this year will probably be awful too, but I guess that will be the next thing I would even consider."

Being ""intelligent"" means very little. Intelligent people are nearly as susceptible to cultural conditioning and indoctrination as are the unintelligent. We live in a society which, out of a need to perpetuate itself, has a vested interest in promoting traditional family values, or failing that, some approximation thereof that still facilitates organized reproduction. In keeping with its self-interest, the society at large necessarily invests itself heavily in indoctrinating people into the requisite belief system. When you're conditioned from even the youngest age to marry and reproduce, and voices critical of this orthodoxy are both infrequent and often marginalized through social criticism, most people won't overcome circumstance and realize that conformity will doom them to misery. And insofar as marriage and reproduction are the goal, then in the modern era where arranged marriages are viewed as the domain of backwards societies, then there must necessarily be an emphasis on dating and relationships, and it needs to be framed in terms that make it seem appealing rather than detrimental so that there's male buy-in."

The spiritual attainment is said to be higher and the life of Jesus seems to bear this out.   You are enjoined to marry if otherwise you would not be able to stay on path and ""burn with passion"".   In that case it advises men to marry, which when society was different, was a kind of practical societal glue that it is not now.   The so called spiritual attainment of marriage is something exceedingly rare in real life anyway.  It is more like Stockholm Syndrome. In any case, I'd let it go once you've made your case."

Tell him there's no proof of this spirituality and you don't believe it without proof. You're not convinced and you don't think it exists. Put the onus on him to show it's a real existing thing.   Why don't men see relationships with women for what they are? It is their resources and attention for her SEX.    That I can prove is not true: there are plenty of couples who are together without sex, perhaps because they value their children together, perhaps because they're too old and infirm to do it anymore, yet still are happy in each other's company.  It is natural and normal to want company of a trusted, accepting person and at times such couples do happen. I wouldn't call it spiritual but when there's no sex and nothing holding them back from leaving, they don't leave each other. There must be a reason."

The reason love feels good is because you're hard wired for it to feel good for your biological fitness, you must reproduce and you must spread your genes.

And while the pharmaceutical companies love to claim that such things are ""proof"", they are anything but.   Nothing in science is set in stone except perhaps the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics.    Actually lots of other things (a whole massive array in fact) in the actual ""sciences"" are -- to use your phrase -- ""set in stone""; it is nowhere near as nebulous (or ""consensus"" based) as you are attempting to make it seem.  The problem is with the fields, the ""arts"" which are really NOT ""sciences"" nevertheless calling themselves such, and in a sloppy fashion, using the terminology and jargon."

Would you rather live to 95 or 100... with a wife that is constantly nagging, and having spent the majority of your most productive years slaving away until say age 70 working endless hours every week scrabbling to earn enough money to pay off the massive debts acquired to provide a ""suitable home"" and extras for a family, but knowing that a significant portion of what you do manage to earn (at least above the debt-slavery) is effectively squandered away by an irresponsible (and virtually never satisfied) woman. Or would you rather work for a decade or two, be debt free and cash positive by say age 40 (or 50 at the latest) and then be able to ""retire"" (or at least pull back to some occasional management/consulting role) for a subsequent pleasurable decade or two, and -- instead of living a tortured existence until age 90 -- pass away quietly in your mid 70's.   I'd rather have the latter.    EDIT: In fact, let's put it in even simpler terms, we often hear it said that ""Life is a Journey"" -- OK then would you rather:   A. Take a 90 day trip on a cruise ship -- the ""SS Wedded Bliss"" -- that has some exciting & dramatic ""activity"" pre-planned for nearly all hours of every-single-one of those 90 days... but also as part of the deal, during 1/2 or even just 1/3 of that trip you will suffer from massively burdensome bouts of dysentery, dry heaves, and sea sickness; possibly even contracting malaria, yellow fever, etc.; you'll survive the trip, but only by being rolled down the gangway in a wheelchair hooked up to several IV's.  Or... Take a shorter, let's say 70 day trip -- on the ""SS MGTOW"" -- where you, have the occasional option for a self-guided ""on shore"" expedition, but otherwise just comfortably relax on deck, read a book, go for a swim... and yet remain healthy and happy for all 70 days of the trip (ok, we'll concede maybe a day or two of ""seasickness"" during the first week); and you can comfortably exit the ship at the end, walking off into the proverbial sunset.

Here's the thing about that:   as you continue to age, your view on many things will likely change -- at least slightly, and in some cases significantly -- and you'll (once again) -- probably somewhat surprisingly -- lock back and find your views have just naturally ""realigned"" with ones your father has, but which you previously disagreed with. Yet that won't happen with everything -- in part because your life experience, and even more generally the ""era"" and ""world"" that you have to live and work in actually ARE different -- and probably require some different views.   Just as an example of the latter -- take most anything ""technology"" or even ""tool"" related -- back in your father's youth and probably for most of his adult years, technology and tool things were EXPENSIVE (even seemingly simple things like wrenches and socket sets) and generally speaking ""you got what you paid for"" (i.e. more expensive models versions WERE actually superior products), so you invested in GOOD (expensive) tools, and you cherished them, and fixed them, and refurbished them (rather than discarding and replacing). And generally speaking the same with ""technology"" things like audio systems, televisions, etc.  But most of that is quite frankly no longer really true.  Yes there are still cheap-CRAP-tools that should be avoided, but generally speaking the overall quality of the low-price tools is FAR higher than it used to be -- and ""good"" tools are essentially now a commodity item; ergo (with granted a few exceptions here and there) for the most part there is virtually ZERO functional value in paying for the ""premium"" tools.  Nor do you necessarily need to ""cherish"" them in the same manner; they aren't so rare and therefore aren't the ""investment"" that they once were (again, there are exceptions, but they are precisely that: exceptions).  When it comes to ""technology"" items... well those too have become low-cost commodities; and moreover generally speaking by the time something breaks, it is ""obsolete"", and a new and more importantly higher-functionality version is probably available at a CHEAPER price than fixing/repairing the old model.    EDIT: A bit off-topic, but... That trend (towards disposable quickly obsolete commodity tech items) probably won't last forever, it is possible that within another decade or so, we will reach a ""plateau"" in terms of innovation/obsolescence -- so that spending a little extra to obtain a more durable & longer-lasting (more readily repairable/upgradable) product, i.e. something like a ""legacy laptop"" will become a pragmatic reality...  but I don't think we're there yet. (Though some people will say that is debatable, and that we've reached that point... I think they're jumping the gun a bit.)"

And it worked.   The TRUE value of a competent father. (BTW I basically had this as well -- although in many cases it wasn't specific ""instruction/teaching"" so much as it was just that I had an example to observe & emulate, and free access to the tools and equipment and probably most importantly the attitude that I could (and should) be able to ""figure it out"" -- end result is that I'm a pretty flexible and multi-talented dude when it comes to just about ANY mechanical, electrical, plumbing... and by extension basically ANY ""tech"" or ""machinery"", etc.)  Alas for all the young men out there who DON'T have either a mentor OR a model for this kind of stuff -- and from what I've been seeing in the past decade or more with many twenty-something guys, well that kind of almost total ignorance of ""masculine skills & abilities"" is becoming waaay too common.     So even though I'm a MGTOW, here's to my dad and all other dads out there doing their part to create a better world...   The thing is -- and I've actually had this conversation with my own father -- probably one of the MAIN reasons I am ""MGTOW"" and don't intend on getting married and having kids...  Is precisely because I would want to be that kind of father -- and the WORLD has made it virtually impossible to do this kind of ""fathering"" (aka ""patriarchy"") any more.  The proverbial ""loonies"" (feminists & manginas) have been put in charge of the nuthouse, and they do just about everything they can to UNDERMINE if not outright attack and destroy that kind of masculinity, especially in terms of men ""fathering"" their sons.  I simply REFUSE to bring a son into that kind of world -- the risk that various ""societal forces"" would take him away and/or destroy him (and/or the father-son bond) right in front of me (and I'm seeing this happen currently with friends' sons by the way) -- that is FAR too high right now.  I had previously (about 20 years ago) felt that the whole ""insanity"" might either blow over or ""implode"" in on itself soon enough that I would be able to become a parent/father -- or that I might be able to find/construct some ""safe corner"" of the world where it could be done with lower risk...    But that didn't happen, in fact the situation (IMHO) simply became even worse; and while I still believe that (eventually) this insanity WILL (perforce) end up collapsing on itself... I no longer believe it will happen anywhere NEAR soon enough for me to properly sire & parent a son (or sons); in fact chances are that I may not only be well-past proper ""fathering"" years (arguably I've already crossed the threshhold, it's certainly ""borderline"" at my age) but I will probably be dead and in my grave before the implosion happens (much less the ""correction"" which could take decades longer)."

Be aware that wives have certain privileges that employees do not.  In most states, a wife is entitled to some form of maintenance and child support if your coupling produces children.  In many states, an employee is hired or fired ""at will"" and can be let go with little if any severance. If your coupling produced no children, she can be released from your employ with little beyond the clothes on her back. Of course, in most states there is some sort of unemployment insurance, but this is for a limited amount, for a limited time and is contingent upon the person receiving unemployment making a good-faith effort to find new employment.

MGTOW,3al7im,muramuramura,9,Sun Jun 21 07:53:54 2015 UTC,"It's great that the topic of suicide in men is really beginning to reach the masses. Living in these feminist times cause a lot of us to really struggle with getting by when we get fucked in the ass on almost all cases which regard our mental well being, our lifestyle, and our means of living-the proverbial bread and butter.  I must disagree on his saying that the majority of women are not the problem. As the feminazis DO control mainstream and social media, women today are having their heads pumped full of men hating ideologies which are now becoming common place in their behavior. We're lacking, we're the problem, we're the ones always at fault. Let's face it.. the gynocentric endorsements of this propaganda are having a large effect on men due in part because sheep women are actually buying into the hog wash.  Everything else he says is really spot on. If you could tl;dr his video it would be basically this: men are getting fucked, women are thriving on false claims and entitlement."
MGTOW,3al7im,Wollem,7,Sun Jun 21 10:05:29 2015 UTC,"The majority of women are definitely the problem.  If you see a man bullying a woman, other men don't just stand by and let it happen. They don't stand and giggle and mock the woman and encourage the man to bully her.  Men stand up and say something, they stop the bullying. Most men are white knights and in fact take it to absolute extremes, they won't even let women be treated the same as men or be accountable for anything, they support women bullying men and then make sure the man is powerless to defend himself.  This is why there is no such thing as a patriarchy and female oppression. It's impossible Never existed in the world. Doesn't exist now. Men do not allow it.  What feminism is, it wanted to make women far superior to men. And that's what they achieved. Women were always treated well, better than men. But feminists didn't think that was enough. They wanted things to be worse for men, so much so that men would be reduced to nothing more than pathetic slaves and all women to be treated like royalty.  They've achieved that."

Hopping a Westbound freight and getting off somewhere in Wyoming--- now that WAS a temptation. If someone had shown me a way to make that happen, I can't rightly say I wouldn't have been on a train that night.  Personally, I don't think I could do suicide, but having been through rough stuff and realizing that I didn't have it as rough as some fellows do-- I think I can understand why some choose to end it all. You can face anything as long as you have hope. Once hope is gone, you lose even the will to wake up tomorrow."

But I find that I've never had hope to begin with; I'm just waking up and moving because it's auto-pilot at this point. Everything just kind of runs together in a chaotic blur; and the idea of the void is really appealing comparatively.  (I think you were one of the ones who said to find some remote corner of the world I wanted to see and just go.

MGTOW,3ao5uy,scarredlife,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:58:43 2015 UTC,"Actually hospice staff are apparently increasingly MALE.  For me, I think it's largely a moot point -- I will almost certainly die alone and in my own home -- highly UNlikely that I will see a rescue squad or hospital, much less a nursing home.  Why? Well one major reason is that I live in a RURAL area. Second is that primary causes of death (at and past my age) are typically major heart-attack* and/or stroke.  If either of those happen during the sleeping hours of the day (about 1/3 to 1/2 of the day) then the chances of any ""ambulance"" reaching me in time to do anything about it (and the recovery rate is rare) are pretty darned near ZERO; the chances during the other 1/2 to 2/3 of the day aren't a heck of a lot higher.    * This is especially likely as I kind of have a ""funky"" ticker: an anomalous ""heart arrhythmia"" that -- every now and again, sometimes due to high stress, and other times without any identifiable causal factor -- seems to just come out of nowhere, and at which times where my heart just sort of goes into ""flutter"" mode and/or stops ticking for a few seconds; I'm usually aware of it, and it freaked me out years ago, but now I've come to accept it as *yawn* just yet another one of those things.    And yes, I had it ""checked out"" -- if the doctors were/are correct, then there's been an abnormally high significant risk of an unexpected ""cardiac"" event even since my teen years -- they told me my options were:   a) extremely risky surgery (of dubious value); or   b) expensive medications (which if used for any length of time would probably need to be continued for life, lest subsequent quitting cause the very problem they were intended to solve) which were also risky and of dubious benefit/potential negatives; or   c) just live life, try to control (mitigate/reduce if not eliminate) ""high stress"" situations, and to otherwise just not worry about the proverbial Damoclean sword. As one doc put it at the time, you might needlessly debilitate yourself with surgery or meds -- or even just ""worrying"" about it -- only to die by something else, some entirely unrelated thing, like in a car accident, at age 25.  I read up everything I could on the various diagnostic names for my ""condition"" (depending on how you wanted to classify it) -- as well as options ""a"" (horrible, no F'in way)... and ""b"" (even tried the meds for a short time -- a few weeks, which seemed to indicate that they would work) -- decided the downsides of both were not worth the risk -- and opted for ""c"" as the most logical/rational as well as least-intervention path.  Over time, when the proverbial sword DIDN'T descend... well -- other than avoiding needless ""stress"" and inane ""drama"" (part of the reason I am MGTOW? dunno)... anyway I have learned to pretty much ignore it's presence. Actually as I've gotten older, well it's kind of become a sort of reassuring thing -- that I probably already know the HOW/WHY of my death (and moreover that no ""intervention"" by EMT's would make any difference), just not the WHEN, other than that there's a pretty good chance it will happen in my sleep -- and I can ""live with that"" so to speak, LOL."

However, this should be done transparently, i.e. without subterfuge. Anything less shows the friendship was a bit shallow in the first place, imo.   If a person crosses whatever line(s) you draw in the sand (regarding personal behaviour or whatever else) then I believe you owe it to yourself to declare both your feelings and your demands. It's a matter of remaining true to whatever is your vision of integrity."
MGTOW,3aka29,thrownaway_MGTOW,2,Sun Jun 21 22:18:54 2015 UTC,"Alas yes, you probably should ""let go"".  Keep in mind that it is probably ONLY a matter of time regardless; he's going to continue to essentially ""use"" you when convenient, and otherwise won't have time for you (because the ""pussy"" rules all).  BTW if you want to let go the easiest way -- well to expand on what /u/Mister_Shitlord_2U states in his comment -- here's one essentially foolproof recipe (which is also a sort of ""shit-test"" as well) that you can USE to cause the friendship to end*:    The next time he asks to borrow, loan him a bit extra... some (relatively) substantial amount of cash...  We're talking if he asks to borrow $5, say all you have is a $50 bill, pull it out and hand it over (without batting an eye)... if he asks for $10 or $20 then hand him a $100 bill and say something like ""Jeez, its the smallest thing I've got other than a couple of singles & change; but I know you'll get it back to me, right buddy?""      In other words lend him enough that it's sizable and will be difficult for him to repay (especially given his reckless spending nature), at least unless he REALLY values your friendship -- yet not enough that it will really damage your finances).  BTW this of course requires you to do a bit of planning, and keep a $50 and/or $100 bill in your wallet. Then after that, each time that you see or speak to him, remind him that he owes you that $50/$100. He will -- and probably very SOON -- entirely cease calling, and will in fact probably begin to actively avoid all contact with you. (And of course if he ever DOES call, or you ever DO run into him even just by chance {i.e. before he can dodge around a corner, or duck under a table} ... well, all you need to do is open the conversation with ""Hey, dude... you got that money you owe me?"")   It kinda sucks to have to do it that way -- but trust me, it works -- and it's probably even CHEAPER this way (even with a $100 bill) than what he'll end up extracting from you anyway (in cash AND resources burned through) during your vain attempts to ""reconcile"" and/or maintain what is clearly a one-way friendship.    * And with what OUGHT to be a clear/clean conscience on your own side.  As /u/Mister_Shitlord_2U notes though, he will probably engage the old ""hamster"" and in his brain will MANUFACTURE some ""thing"" which enables him to justify to himself why he shouldn't have to pay you back (even if it's just some bullshit thing about him ""deserving"" to be forgiven and have the debt forgotten about); of course the back of his conscience will nonetheless STILL remind him that he never repaid you (and that he really DOES still owe you the money), so the ""hate/blame"" will be more of a passive one than an active/malicious one."

I really almost want to chuckle, but I know it would be rude.  I think your friend is thinking along shall we say, ""similar"" lines, except focusing mainly on the last and with a different result for the first, to wit: calling it quits so he doesn't have to repay the $450.

MGTOW,3aht7i,tracker2208,2,Sat Jun 20 10:26:09 2015 UTC,A super high intensity low impact exercise you could do for HIIT is battling ropes.  Then there's something called the Versaclimber if you can find a gym with one.  Never heard of it before a couple days ago when I read about it on Mark's Daily Apple.  But his description makes it sound perfect for a low impact HIIT.  You may have trouble finding a gym with one though.

He posted a YouTube video for a Laura, presumably his former wife, thanking her for “12 beautiful years” together and saying she had earned half of the household.

With a number of curious Ebay auctions, where allegedly offering an angry husband one half sawed items, the German Bar Association, or more precisely, its magazine attorney information has shown around the Internet community on the nose. The story of ""Martin G."" spread in recent days both viral and in traditional media - up to the British Daily Mirror and Fox News in the US. ""We looked at the history of"" ""devised and even resorted to saber saw."" Martin G. explains the magazine on its website. Martin G. was not authentic, but still a good example of real distinctions.  Under the username der.juli the online magazine of the German Bar Association has about a half a television, a half car and half a sofa at Ebay. The Internet auction house could not be reached for comment at first. The seller was in the descriptions as a man who has to share his goods after a divorce with his ex-wife.  The account der.Juli leads ebay since 13:05:02 and certifies him 50 positive reviews, but these are all older than 12 months. Until next Friday run 16 Auctions - half from iPhone over half chairs up to half a car. Whether the respective highest bidders actually get the sawed items, would not reveal to demand a spokesman for the attorney information. Left open the speaker of the online portal and whether the use of an invented story about the sale is perfectly legal. On Monday, a press conference is planned.  [Update]  Meanwhile, a spokesman of the Bar Association, that the story was invented indeed, the objects offered for sale but were actually halved. This is also a YouTube video entitled ""For Laura"", which can be seen in the article descriptions. The respective highest bidders will get the things by half also.

Unfortunately, many people I got to know didn't like the idea of sitting at a campfire while watching the stars and have deep conversations. No chance to meet girls and the need of doing groundwork were daunting.  I used to play in the forest daily when I was a child. Climbing on trees, Scouting Expeditions, picking up berries and watching animals. My grandfather told me a lot about eatable wild plants and berries. When I'm hiking around in the mountains I always finding something to snack on.  Companions tend to look at me very sceptically when I present them eatable things from the wilderness.

I'm busy living my life and if someone wants to tag along and they are not a net negative but a positive then they can. If not then they can go back to where they came from and never return.  The people will come to you if you are the type of person that they happen to enjoy being around. Usually these types of people are focused on living the happiest best most enjoyable and stress free life that they can. They are too busy to worry about making friends. Just make sure to keep the people that are trying to get things out of you at bay.  If you think having friends or having more friends will make you happy they won't. You have to be happy with yourself first.

It's not my job to change his mind and open his eyes, he chose his path and has kids with a bipolar wife and goes through some pretty rough times when she's on a low. When he needs support, I'm still there for him, just like when I need support he's there for me. A lot of the times we just go fishing to get away from everything and those are like our therapy sessions where we just bitch about the world and have the best fucking time together.     When it comes to money and going out we take turns getting shit for one another, like I'll pay for the trip one time, he gets the next time.. neither of us tries to take advantage of one another in that, and many other regards. He's a great guy save for the whole bluepill thing, and that's alright. We just clicked, there was no testing of one anothers values, political views, ideology.. we're guys, we don't worry about that shit. We just want to get away from shit, complain for a little, offer some support, and have a great time.     I feel people over think things on this board too much, maybe within MGTOW in general. Yes, our eyes are open to women being vile personalities and would use and dump you once they're done, but it doesn't need to interfere with every aspect of our lives, just those dealing with women.     When it comes to finding friendship with men, like any other social relationship, it's give, take, and compatibility. Are they aware enough to pay for drinks when you paid last time? Do they give back to the friendship whereas you've given more than they have? There needs to be a balance on what each other is getting out of it, while maintaining a personality that you find you can tolerate. I have a great time with my bud, we're very like minded and can pretty much finish each others' thoughts now. He has a very likable personality and because we have so much in common it's easy to get along. That's what a friendship boils down to.     Don't complicate things, just see if you get along first, then pay attention to the give and take portion of the friendship."

I only really bother to correct them if they're very explicitly wrong and their mistake is easy to point out.  As far as I can tell there's two fundamental choices in a situation like this: inaction or rejection. If the option is at all available, I think you should seriously consider what would happen if you just cut off ties with these people. Friends, family --- all of that matters less than the question, would my life be better if these people were no longer a part of it? There is no particular reason that they should be a part of your life if you don't find sufficient value in their continued presence.  But then again, sometimes there's no particular reason to outright reject them either. Inaction can be a perfectly reasonable low-cost option, if you can deal with it. If someone's wrong they're just wrong, there's no need to think about them past that --- once you know they're wrong, that's it, there's no need to take it as a compliment or an insult, it's just something to no longer think about --- it isn't the right answer, so it's probably not worth your continued attention. As long as their presence in your life isn't too toxic, and you're not likely to get physically assaulted or something, it can be fine to just ignore them.  If you're wondering why they say these things, it's probably less about you and more an almost direct reflection of their own thoughts. When someone doesn't exercise at all, and they suspect that doing so would be the right answer, or if they're constantly told that exercise would be a good thing --- they will inevitably build narratives in their mind that justify their decision to not exercise. Some of these narratives revolve around their inability to exercise: ""only people with good genetics can get fit, I have bad genetics, so it would be pointless for me to try"" --- and so on. Some of these narratives revolve around the character of people who do exercise, ""oh that's just something [bad people, e.g. jocks] do"", so when they see you exercise and the like, the obvious immediate reaction is, ""oh, you're a bad person"" --- because that's how their mind has classified the issue.  The narrative can be so strong that they genuinely believe that people who live healthily are horrible people, a far more evil existence than being a drug addict, all because of their rationalizations why they don't life their lives better --- people better off than them have to be bad people, right? If the people ""above"" them are actually bad people, then there's reason and meaning in their life being shit. This is why you see so much abject hatred against the rich, even the well-off people who aren't actually villainous --- people who just worked hard and got a bit lucky. Of course, in reality, none of that matters --- being above, being below, reason, excuse, meaning --- it's all the wrong focus. If your life could be significantly better, if the laws of physics don't forbid that from happening, then the reason you're stuck on your current level instead of progressing towards a better state, is because you're too stupid to see the exact means of how to proceed to that better state, the necessary individual, concrete steps, including the parts of your mind you would have to modify --- your shitty perceptions, beliefs and assumptions.  You are seeing their dysfunctional mind at work. If they are living their life far worse than they could be living it, it is inevitable that they would have a dysfunctional mind --- a better mind would result in better actions, and thus a better life. Treasure that insight: a lot of the mistakes they make are something you can learn from. A lot of the mistakes that people make are mistakes that everyone makes, some just do them to a far greater degree than others, and paying deep attention to some of these extreme cases can be very helpful in identifying the same type of mistakes that you are making on a far lesser level. A better mind is a better life, and the more you pay attention the better you can be.  Fundamentally, you are an individual existence and therefore, at your core, alone in your life. Your own actions are the only control over reality you have, and the effects on your own life are the only effects you will experience. There seems to be an innate, evolutionary (and cultural) bias to give respect to another's perspective (because altruism is likely to result in greater reproduction of DNA, since DNA replicates and is shared, and isn't tied to a single individual)  --- but from the standpoint of that single individual, you really should learn look at people with selfish eyes: is the person currently talking conveying useful information, or not? What can I do with it, is there value in it or is it just noise that I should ignore? If there is value in it, which parts? What do I keep and what do I throw away? What choices can I make here and now, and how do they affect my life?"

It is merely understanding how animals actually behave, and using that understanding to maneuver the lesser ones out of your way. We are not all equal by birthright.   You are only weak because you choose to be. About 7 years ago I was caught in an IED blast. It took me 9 months to relearn how to walk. I am physically almost fully recovered. The loss of confidence took me years to recover from.  The first step to regaining my confidence was getting back into shape. The second thing was to go into monk mode, which I did for nearly 3 years. When I came out, I was back to my oldself but stronger with the constant reminder of what I survived. You only need to pick yourself up after every fall to succeed. Success is nothing more than boneheaded determination and constant perseverance. Confidence and strength come after success. Never make the mistake that others are not just as down as you are, because some of us have been far lower than you are now, and still bounced back. You are only alone in your own mind. So as I see it, you have two options; use a shotgun, or quit being a bitch and stop taking yourself so damn seriously.

MGTOW,3ahcco,thrownaway_MGTOW,18,Sun Jun 21 07:54:42 2015 UTC,"As an addendum to my original post, let me just say that I have nothing against chicks who do porn.  There's demand for it, someone has to do it, and more people who refuse to do it, the higher the wages will be of those who do.    Bree Olson saying that the guys who do porn get away with it later in life is infuriating.  Notice how she leaves out how little they make relative to women.  Porn isn't a way for guys to feed themselves and put a roof over their head, oftentimes, the male porn-star is the owner of the company or the guy footing the bill.  They're actually trying to save a buck or two on production costs.  Oh, and get to bang a hot girl, there's that too.  A hot chick can make a living shooting videos, chad thundercock gets to fuck hot girls, but after that, meh....the point is, you were financially compensated for your decision, and you chose to take it.  Nobody knows a single male pornstar, just like nobody knows a single male model.  All the supermodels are women.  The difference is, men don't think that's sexists, we think that's the market paying employees what the demand indicates, and female fashion models are more in demand.    What my problem is with Bree Olson is that she's espousing feminists nonsense.  The single biggest problem for feminism is that it wants to increase opportunity for women, while not increasing responsibility.  If you want more money, or less social scrutiny, you have to take on more responsibility.  Sorry, but that's the way it is, cupcake.  You did porn because the money was good.  ""Sexual expression"" was the damn furthest thing from your mind.  Now, in the name of ""sexual control and liberation"" you want to be free from the consequences of your actions.  Can you see why this reasoning is absurd?  Every choice we make in life dictates the course our lives will follow.  As Qui-Gon Jinn once said, ""your focus determines your reality"" or as Doc Emmitt L. Brown put it ""we all make decisions that alter the course of our lives, you've got to do what you've got to do, and I've got to do what I've got to do.""  Bree Olson did porn, as did lots of other girls.  Later on in life, society doesn't seem to think that was a great idea, and doesn't want to associate with them.  Hot chick rides the CC when she's young, and when she's older, she finds that she doesn't have as many good options for a man who will wife her up.  Hot chick gets a cool, fun tatoo when she's young, when she's older, employers don't think that's a good look for their business and decline to hire her.  Its not rocket science, if you want a tatoo, that's fine, but be prepared to take on the responsibilities that go along with it.  Be prepared for how other people will react.  You were young and rebellious, later on, that rebelliousness hurts your ability to get along with the rest of society.  What were the odds?"

This is the standard feminist bullshit of a ""double standard"", the sluts and studs thing.    Men and women are different and were thus judged by different criteria until the world went looney and feminist. Men and women want different things from their partners. Women look at women doing sex work as scabs, strike breakers against the pussy union; I believe men are more tolerant, although this ought to be a deal breaker for any sort of relationship. Tracy Rolan (Harmony Rose) ran into trouble with this when Roanoke County fire officials found out ( http://www.ems1.com/careers/articles/1343345-EMS-A-not-so-exclusive-club ) about her past, although how some official had it ""come to his attention"" is vague and he could have been tipped off by a woman, a man, or just while cleaning out his hard drive."

I'm not sure how much money porn hoes can get paid now, since the proliferation of streaming high speed free internet porn. But they used to make $1000 or more per scene. If they did 10 scenes a month, or if they did more high-paying extreme acts, like gangbang, anal, dp, etc. they would be making $10,000 a month. Which would mean over $100,000 a year.

If a female porn star wants to talk about ""equality"" when was the last time you heard of a former male porn star doing any main stream work? How about demanding their male costars get paid more? A big nope on those two eh?  Also lets be clear a lot of the stigma around porn stars also is included in the idea that a lot of these women also sell their bodies to wealthy men who are fans of theirs. Charlie Sheen did not get to fuck her for free you know. She was paid quite well to ride his cock and to pretend to love him. It used to be that porn stars would never admit to selling their body during the 70s thru the 80s but not anymore.

Go broke over college?  Work some shit job for long hours to make less than what is required to live on?  A high school drop out, if she was decent looking, could probably pay off a house before she's 24.  And all she has to do is have sex, which a lot of women enjoy anyway.    I'd take that deal.  It's not like women actually want to be married to some provider schmuck who will probably be far less sexually attractive to her than a bunch of fit douchebag guys who give her tingles by humiliating her.  I don't know man, from a female's perspective, porn seems like a pretty good deal.  Women who complain about it after are like women generally.  They make themselves the victim in every scenario and nothing makes them happy.  Either way they'd be complaining.  So what is that even worth?    Here's the other thing about slut shaming.  It's probably the single biggest reason women make false rape allegations.  It's why they send mixed signals, lie constantly about sex, have weird regret and shame issues after, and why they feel the need to get drunk with the intention of letting somebody fuck them.  It's why women feel the need to obscure from themselves their own sexual desires and blame men for them.  What good ever came of it?  What's the point of it?  We saddle women with this archaic bullshit about sexual morality and add to the crazy, as if there isn't enough of it there already.  And for what?  So that it gets harder to get laid?  So that women play weird games and use sex as a social bargaining chip?  From a MGTOW perspective, in my opinion, you should be pro sex work, pro slut, pro female promiscuity.  I'm not trying to find the romanticized unicorn who I can confess all my little feelz to and for whom I can spend the rest of my life taking out the trash and getting henpecked.  The easier it is to get laid, the better, I'm not trying to get married or commit to anybody and I certainly don't want to put in the herculean effort to bypass all her ridiculous and pointless little defenses just for pussy.     I just don't get what the point of slut shaming is from a MGTOW perspective.  I guess that's just me."
MGTOW,3ahcco,LongtimeRPLurker,6,Sat Jun 20 05:21:31 2015 UTC,"I don't care what she does, its completely irrelevant to me.  I tend to be libertarian about what people can and can't do.  I might abhor smoking, for example, but I don't judge other people for smoking.    My point was never about slut shaming, my point was not understanding that there are consequences for your actions.  If you want to smoke, for example, great.  My father smoked two packs a day his entire life.  However, when that lifetime of smoking puts you in a hospital bed, on death's door, at the age of 55 (like my father was), that ain't on me.  You made a bad decision, you got the consequences of it.  Every decision, both bad and good, has consequences, some are good some aren't.  Our lives are the sum of our choices, that's why we need to be careful about what we choose.    My father didn't complain ""why am I being forced to pay with my life for all the cigerettes I smoked when I was young?  I quit a couple of years ago, why are diseases still judging me for my past conduct and not the person I want to be now?""    It doesn't work like that.  That would be hamstering on an epic scale.  If you want to do porn, knock yourself out, just understand there will be consequences later on in life.  Diseases are dispassionate, they don't care.  You cannot argue with them, reason with them, or emphasize with them.  In my father's case, they were a result of a decision he made when he was young.  He took up smoking in the 60's, well before it was a medical fact that they caused disease.  When he learned that they did, the damage was done.  At least my father could plead ignorance, that doesn't mean he made the right choice to wait years to give up smoking after he found out it was dangerous.  I don't shame him for what he did, he made his choice and he suffered the consequences thereof, like we all do.  On his deathbed, he didn't try to hamster away his life, or his choices.    Porn has consequences.  Maybe the first generation of girls didn't know that, but by now, most sensible women have to.  If you need the money, that's fine.  If you like the work, great.  If you want to go for it to make a better life for yourself (buy a house at 24, and how many pornstars really do that?) great.  I don't think anything should stop you, and I'm not trying to discourage you.  I'm just saying ten years down the road, it will catch up with you.  Don't be surprised and don't try to rationalize things when the consequences come up."
MGTOW,3ahcco,LongtimeRPLurker,3,Sat Jun 20 06:38:54 2015 UTC,Slut-shaming had a purpose in older societies because the only purpose marriage had was to grantee a man's genetic lineage. Now we have paternity tests so its unnecessary however marriage itself is likewise unnecessary.
MGTOW,3ahcco,mydark,2,Sat Jun 20 06:45:09 2015 UTC,"I actually tend to think that marriage is a social good (pair bonding has ensured humanities' survival for at least six thousand years, after all, and it was a better system than the harems which proceeded it), it has simply become unworkable in the current climate.  Once you marry, every bit of leverage in a relationship shifts to the woman, that is why there is nothing in marriage for a man.  Feminism has seen to that.  One of the central tenants of feminism is being anti-family.  They don't often admit it openly, but every so often you'll read something where they slip up and it comes out.    When I first started reading the manosphere, one of the assertions I didn't believe was that feminism was anti-family.  It seemed preposterous to me that anyone could be anti-family or anti-marriage.  Fortunately, I do read feminists rags (you have to know what everyone thinks.  Remember the law of power: don't build forts, isolation is dangerous.  Intellectual isolation is more dangerous than physical isolation is) and once I'd started reading the manosphere, I started noticing, every so often, that one of these feminists writers would slip up and say it out in the open: we want to get rid of marriage and the family.  If mainstream society knew about this goal, feminism would go from being toxic (its losing market share right now) to becoming radioactive.    So, if you think marriage is unnecessary, guess what?  Feminism agrees with you, and is trying to move society in that direction.  The reason why you believe marriage is unnecessary, more likely than not, is due to how much feminism has already succeeded.  They have made it untenable for men to get married, and then feminists wonder why they can't find a good husband.  Accept the consequences of your actions."

And yet we are the only animal who is so irrational towards sex. We shame people who engage in promiscious sex. We cut off skin from dicks of little boys, which results in less enjoyment in sex. We have invented all sorts of societal barriers in order to prevent us from enjoying sex. It's like we are running away from something."
MGTOW,3ahcco,thrownaway_MGTOW,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:24:00 2015 UTC,"I have nothing against people doing whatever they want, so long as they are willing to live with the results of their decisions.  Sex, at the end of the day, is simple from a woman's point of view:  The higher my partner count is, the harder it will be for me to lock down a high value man in marriage.    High Value Men, who have options, don't want to wife a cum-bucket.  They understand, at least intuitively, the correlation between a woman's partner count and the chances the marriage will succeed.  No one wants to wed Chad Thundercock's Alpha Widow.  Part of the reason for this understanding is that high value men tend to have a lot of experience with women (they're alphas, unlike BB).  Enjoy sex, as much as you want to, but understand WHY there is a double standard between male and female sexual promiscuity.    Human relationships used to be centered on the harem model, one man and many women.  Most mammalian species in nature don't  mate 1-1 like humans are expected to.  It is reasonable to assume that humans didn't either, for a long time in our history.  Remember, we might have been around for 200,000 years, but our brain chemistry really only became modern about 50,000 years ago.  There is evidence that as recently as 8,000 years ago, mating was still based on the harem model that most of our cousins use.  In such cases, the double standard for promiscuity between men and woman makes perfect sense: for most of our history, men were polygamous and women were monogamous.  The trade off for this standard is that women are also inherently more valuable than men, and men who are not apex males, have absolutely no value to procreation."
MGTOW,3ahcco,Robotron6000,0,Mon Jun 22 04:16:15 2015 UTC,"There exists evidence that puts the harem style sexual behaviour into question. Hunter Gatherers tribes used sex to strengthen the relationships with members of  other tribes. There were ""alphas"", but they didn't had a monopoly on women. They just had twice or third times the amount of sex than a low tier men. Harem style mating behaviour appeared with the invention of agriculture, private property and civilization. Women were forced to share the few men who owned land and the tools to run a farm. This suggests that the sexual strategies of humans adapt to the environment, which makes it hard to figure out the natural sexual behaviour of humans."

MGTOW,3ahcco,Morranaii,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:50:26 2015 UTC,"That is interesting.  I just figured that harem style sexual behavior was the norm in pre-history mostly because it is the main sexual strategy that our mammalian cousins pursue.  It isn't much of a stretch to figure that if most ape species, who are our closest genetic cousins, mate in harems, then it figures that early man probably did too.    Genetically, our species emerged 200,000 years ago, but more complex symbolic manipulation, needed for things like agriculture, religion, painting, music, mathematics, astronomy and a whole host of other useful survival skills didn't show up in our ancestors until the transition to behavioral modernity about 50,000 years ago.  There is debate about this time frame, some anthropologists believe it happened quickly, and others slowly.    So, Hunting and Gathering was the norm of society for the first 3/4th of human history, when there was little separating us from the apes, apart from the ability to make basic tools.  I had figured that the closer we were to the apes, the more our mating practices would resemble their's.  90% of mammalian species mate in harem structures, after all.    I have not read sex at dawn, is the source your drawing from?  Would be interested to learn where this research comes from."
MGTOW,3ahcco,Morranaii,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:36:38 2015 UTC,Not every ape species engages in a harem style mating behaviour either. Take Bonobos for examples. There is no alpha ape among them. The tribe is usually run by females who fuck with almost all apes. Females dominate males because there's a thighter social network among female Bonobos. It's pretty fascinating actually: https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Bonobo#Sexual_social_behavior  Sex at Dawn is a great book and my source. IIRC they form their hypothesis on the basis of the bone structure of tribe people. It indicates that they had a lot of sex.

The matrix is what the matrix is, but it cannot tell you who you are, anymore than you can tell it what it is.  Bree Olson is not MGTOW, she's trying to fit into the construct, and get it to ignore her past, which it doesn't want to do.  That is hamstering, and it is a lack of responsibility for your own actions.  It is the very source of moral decay that led to the invention of MGTOW in the first place.  To get away from women like that.    You can go your own way, apart from society, and do what you want to.  Just like Bree Olson could do porn.  The trick is that you own that decision.  When someday, you might change your mind and think ""you know, this mgtow thing isn't really working out for me, I think I'd like to go back to society and try to find a girlfriend, or something.""  Don't be surprised when your prior decision to go your own way has consequences (i.e. you didn't develop social skills, and have a harder time interacting with people) if you decide to come back.  If you decide to go your own way forever, congratulations, you found the right thing for you, where your decisions have positive consequences (or perhaps the more neutral sounding word ""results"").    There is no hypocrisy in saying that choices have outcomes, and that the choices Bree Olson made have outcomes she's not happy with and so the rationalization hamster is in full overdrive right now.  If the banks want a family man, that is logically consistent so long as you never choose to work at one.  If you are something an employer doesn't want, don't complain when you don't get hired.  Bree Olson is something banks don't want to hire, she applied for a job at a bank, got turned down and then whined about it.    The specific example of banks was only meant to illustrate an industry that a lot of people want to work in, but where appearances matter a great deal to getting hired and moving up.  As an engineer, I hate banks too, and I would never want to work at one, nor would I be qualified to.

This is why I have noted elsewhere NOT to let some woman (or really anyone) simply ""move in"" without getting some written ""rental"" agreement -- and being VERY clear about things.  Obviously -- as several of the commenters noted, SHE sees this as the equivalent of them getting married (and dollars to doughnuts she's already probably planning on getting pregnant & etc) -- HE thinks it's some kind of a ""friends with [sex] benefits for him, and [cheap rent] benefits for her"".  EDIT: Also, all the completely clueless IDIOTS in that thread telling him to NOT talk to his GF in ""business"" terms -- and to just (more or less) ""trust to love"" and assorted other nonsense.    * BTW, for OP... next time rather than link to the thread, use on of the ""archive"" service things, that way if the original text gets deleted, we still get to read it."

Just be clear about such things as stds, contraception (100% your responsibility: I'd get a vasectomy with a physician's certification in writing of your inability to father children) and how oppressive your local laws might be, and then be sure to be sober, with a girl who is sober, preferably someone known to your circle of friends... Sex can be a dangerous minefield but it can also be a great, fun time. If you are going to pursue women though, you really should make the effort to understand their nature via reading the sidebar links on r/theredpill plus a good few of the all time top rated posts.

MGTOW is a recommendation, not a decree.  Just don't assume sex will solve all of your problems.   should I try to completely block them out?   Trying not to think about stuff doesn't work.  For example, don't think about pink elephants. Did you think about pink elephants?  If I were you, I'd ask why you're focusing on it. Is it as simple as wanting to fulfil your sex drive? Or are you fixating on sex as being ""the thing"" that will make you happy?  Considering that you're basically asking for permission on Reddit, on how to run your own damn life, I'd argue that any issues you have are probably coming from a lack of individuality/agency.

You're fighting against nature and a culture of infinitely reinforced gynocentrism that has been here since the dawn of time. That's hard.   Guys who don't seek pussy do more for MGTOW and men than guys who operate under this idea that it's fine for men to go out and climb over other men at some whore's pedestal.

I never EVER felt so bad  in my life. Only then did I realize that peace of mind over everything is the way to go. Everyone tells you that sex is the best feeling ever without mentioning the stress that comes with it. Worst part? It actually gets boring and not worth it in the end. There's a reason porn desensitizes you, it's better.   I'm not joking OP, if you feel the same way I do, I recommend staying a virgin or have sex with a sterile woman on the pill after you had a vasectomy while wearing 3 condoms.

Currently, men compete for sexual selection and wait to be chosen. When they are, they wait to be informed of any consequences. They wait to be told if the baby will be carried to term, or will be aborted. They wait to be told if they will be allowed to participate in the life of the child. They wait to be told what they will have to pay, and how much for how long, regardless of whether they want or intended to be a parent. The implied agreement when having sex is that men have no say in the outcome, and that if they don’t like it they should abstain. In most areas that implied social agreement is backed by law.   Now, the bigger consideration is what a pill could offer the brotherhood. For most, the answer is obvious: limitless, no-strings sex. For the first time since Eve tempted Adam with that damn apple, men would truly be empowered to control the outcome of their sexual encounters, only becoming fathers when they wanted to. Yes, accidents happen, but the unspeakable reality of men being ""trapped"" would also end overnight. Men would no longer find themselves becoming fathers when all they wanted (and agreed to) was a quick shag. No more shotgun weddings, no more duped daddies, no more surprise calls from the Child Support Agency. That said, a male contraceptive would also be good for women. The original pill is highly effective, but packed with side effects that include weight gain, DVT threat and, rather ironically, reduced libido.

I'm not saying there's going to be overnight change, more likely a male pill would follow the same trajectory that the female one did for social change. Women have legal and social rights that they didn't have before the pill, and I believe the same will be true of men (for exactly the same reasons).  Reproductive choice is a powerful lever. It is for women, and once these options exist for men it will be for them too."

A lot of hamsters in main reddit subs bitch about how men can't be trusted, etc.   The real answer is to trust nobody but yourself. If you don't want a kid, then don't leave that responsibility to someone else.

A post-hoc rationalization to make himself look Holier than thou.  You see, I think JtO is hoping that no one notices that his de-anonymization was actually part of a push by AVFM (which he was closely associated with back then) to gain mainstream credibility. Other big names that did this around the same time? GirlWritesWhat and Typhon Blue. All spent years behind their screen names until AVFM started getting attention and, Elam, ever the mainstream media attention whore, made the call that they should all come out of the closet and use their real names, because having the MSM ""take you seriously"" is apparently uber important. (If people didn't know what folly this was before #GamerGate, they certainly know it now.)  So...yeah. Fuck off John.

MGTOW,3aclin,General_Fear,3,Fri Jun 19 12:42:37 2015 UTC,"It's pretty unwise to reveal your real identity.  We don't live in a free and civil society where open debate is possible.  We all know this.  The sad fact is that we still conflate women with children.  Women themselves do this without even realizing it.  Offending them and being accused of ""misogyny"" is somewhere on a continuum with being accused of rape, domestic violence, etc.  You can lose your job and be persecuted in any number of other ways because the gut instinct of most people is to protect women and provide excuses for them in precisely the way we would for children.  I don't agree that women are inherently evil.  I think they're just as capable of moral agency and ethical responsibility as men are, but they aren't socialized in a culture which demands this of them.  Many women have no idea what these things even mean because the entire culture is about deferring to them and pandering to their almighty incoherent feelings, and you can observe this when you see how quickly a woman will resort to violence, for instance.  Women will hit men in public because they are free to do so.  They don't have a conception of moral agency the way men do and this is the result of their social conditioning.  And they'll do this for the same reason they will lie about sexual harassment and get you fired or accuse you of child abuse to win custody.  It's the same reason they will lie and emotionally manipulate you in a relationship, take you for everything you have, cheat on you, and all the rest of it.  They're inwardly focused, not outwardly focused, it's her feelings which are reality, not yours.  Everything she thinks, feels, and does is excused away by a gynocentric society which provides ready-made rationalizations.  She doesn't even have to hamster it away, society does it for her.  What kind of moral agency does a person like this have?  None.  I think they are capable of that agency, and to that degree, I agree with JtO, that women aren't evil by nature, as if this is the only possible way they could be due to some mysterious biological inferiority.  But, in the current culture such as it is, can they be expected to act responsibly? Absolutely not.    While I think women are capable of much more, if somebody asked me if it was a good idea to just assume that women are evil and act accordingly, I'd say ""yes.""  It's better to err on the side of caution.  MGTOW, above all else, is about self preservation, not social change."

In doing this he totally neglects all the valid science being done in Evo Psych, involving etiology of humans, primates and other animals.    JTO also goes full retard in stating that only experts in the field may make comments based on this. Apparently, facts are facts but only experts can cite them? This is so breathtakingly moronic - and censorious - as to defy logic. Obviously.  Taking this with the kerfuffle vs Karen Straughan, his firing from AVFM, his standing in the rain in Vancouver reading his manifesto to nobody, and the erratic nature of many of his videos ... I predict that JTO's influence will wane precipitously. MRA is done with him; MGTOW will be soon as well.  The initial video was roundly trashed in the MGTOW community; the MGTOWMessenger link below is a good example.    From my point of view, Stardusk and Karen Straughan teamed up for a really, really good video addressing the validity of Evo Psych:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwFFqGl5WYw Stardusk stayed classy and didn't mention JTO by name, simply alluding to ""recent videos.""

MGTOW,3a9pvh,Isaiah4verse1,5,Fri Jun 19 07:36:18 2015 UTC,"With work the way it's been lately I've been making more use of simple recipes.  Here's one I call by the imaginative title of ""Lamb in the oven with potatoes and tomatoes""   You take an oven proof dish large enough to make the number of portions you require and turn on the oven to approx 180 centigrade.   While the oven heats up, into the ovenproof dish you put the following:  Lamb meat to cover the base of the dish (chops,  steaks, whatever - should be a reasonable amount of fat - if VERY lean lamb used, you must add some olive oil)   Onto that you scatter a generous quantity of sliced onions;  Next you add a generous quantity of sliced potatoes (sliced same shape as Dauphinoise but about twice as thick as in the photo;  Next you pour over chopped tomatoes (I'd use two tins in a dish designed to make 2 generous helpings of this tasty dish);  Next you add a good portion of chopped garlic sprinkled over the top;  Then add a decent amount of dried oregon (to taste - i'd use a teaspoonful for the 2-portion recipe);  Then add salt to taste and a grind of black pepper.  If you've used lean lamb then pour over a generous splash of olive oil.  Cover this dish with either foil or a lid and put in the centre of the oven for approx an hour depending on your oven.  Remove foil or lid about 15 mins before removing from the oven.  Serve either on its own, or with your favourite steamed veggies. The sauce produced is deeelishious with the veggies.  The end product should ideally have some crisping to the edges of the potatoes but they should be soft and near melty, as will be the lamb.  Peace out and bon appetit!   Edit: if you want it to cook more quickly, cut the potatoes same thickness as the dauphinoise in the photo."
MGTOW,3a9pvh,PartlyMe,2,Mon Jun 22 01:46:32 2015 UTC,"That does sound pretty good, I'll have to try it. Have you ever tried a layer of ricotta on the lamb under the potatoes, or even better you could top the whole thing off with some crumbled blue cheese."
MGTOW,3a9pvh,Scorpiontail,2,Thu Jun 18 21:36:38 2015 UTC,That would make it a little too rich for my taste as there is already quite a bit of fat in the dish. I can see how the ricotta might work as it's not a strong flavour but the blue cheese could be a little too distracting from the subtle lamb flavour imo.

MGTOW,3a9pvh,Morranaii,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:39:14 2015 UTC,"I was thinking some more about this recipe; and I thought of another tweak I think might work well, for those who want an alternative to the lamb cuts. Use beef cuts on the bottom, (I'd suggest sirloin tip or a skirt steak). Then drizzle White wine vinegar (balsamic could work too) in with the olive oil and a bit of lemon juice over the top of the beef before proceeding with the instructions provided above. (Italian dressing would be a quick and easy short-cut for a similar effect)."
MGTOW,3a9pvh,neutron_,2,Fri Jun 19 03:00:00 2015 UTC,This absolutely works with beef though I would just add a good dose of capers (preserved in salt rather than pickled or in brine) to add the extra 'zest' that the beef lacks with respect to the lamb (the most flavourful meat imo).   edit: rinse the excess salt off the capers before use or don't add extra salt!

MGTOW,3a9pvh,oldredder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:50:24 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a pretty effective vegetarian route, also chives have found a place from time to time.   One thing with the broccoli that I find works well, is to cut the flowering portion as removed from the stem as possible, while still keeping dime to quarter size clusters together. Then take the stem and remove the tougher outer skin from the lower thicker portions with a pairing knife or peeler. Cross cut the thick portions of the stem into 1/8 inch thick slices (disks) and they end up presenting in a novel fashion; and it adds an interesting duality to the way the broccoli plays with the dish.

If I do salmon or trout I just put it in the same dish with the gel-broth and flip it half way through to soak it all in, don't let the fish get hard or dry.

MGTOW,3aaguu,MGTOW_philosopher,13,Thu Jun 18 14:49:43 2015 UTC,"I used to be a Shia Muslim but after careful examination of my beliefs, I became an atheist, but not for the typical mainstream view that Islam ""oppresses"" women, which is in fact bullshit. I tried to justify my stance on women through NAWALT, but as time moved on I saw that AWALT.   Islam often told it like it is, including telling men to keep your gaze away from big ass sluts and not to touch their privates (masturbation). Women, hypergamy, and gynocentrism is one of the reasons why I lost faith in God and religion: how can a God create such creatures that are so manipulative and deceitful and gynocentric? Why would God create women to like giant cocks and tall guys? I couldn't find any answer from religion, but evolution by natural selection had the answers. Why am I short, undesirable, useless, disposable? From there, I asked other non female related questions, and I finally lost my faith. Biology explained things to me and MGTOW philosophy is my enlightenment.  To answer your question, in Islam, marriage isn't a requirement, but it is viewed as very necessary to ""complete"" one's faith, especially for men.  Islam actually caters to women at the expense of men--or at least the general gynocentric tendencies, which is enabled through marriage. In marriage, men are supposed to work their asses off in support of women, and produce children to expand the faith. Often times, the man and woman have to produce more than 3 offspring and the man will have to slave his life away supporting them. In turn, the kids support then in their old age. Bad system, bad idea.  Ali, one of Islam's greatest and most important figures, also said it like it is in many of his sayings concerning women, in a collection entitled Nah'jul Bala'ga:   Woman is a scorpion whose grip is sweet. Your society will pass through a period when cunning and crafty intriguers will be favored by status, when profligates will be considered as well-bred, well-behaved and elegant elites of the society, when just and honest persons will be considered as weaklings, when charity will be considered as a loss to wealth and property, when support and help to each other will be considered as favor and benevolence and when prayers and worship to Allah will be taken up for the sake of show to gain popularity and higher status, at such times regimes will be run under the advice of women and the youngsters will be the rulers and counselors of the State. You were the army of a woman and in the command of a quadruped. When it grumbled you responded, and when it was wounded (hamstrung) you fled away. Your character is low and your pledge is broken. Your faith is hypocrisy. [Prophet's said ""That people who assigned their affairs (of state) to a woman would never prosper"", which is probably the reference to being 'the army of a woman'] As regards a certain woman, she is in the grip of womanly views, and malice is boiling in her bosom like the furnace of the blacksmith. Do not seek the advice of women, their verdicts are often immature and incorrect and their determinations are not firm. You must guard and defend them and act as a shelter to protect them from impious and injurious surroundings and infamous sights, this kind of shelter will keep them well-protected from every harm. Their contact with a vicious and sinful atmosphere (even with all the shelter that you can provide) is going to prove more harmful than being left with protection. Do not let them interfere with affairs where you cannot personally guide or protect them. Do not let them aspire for things which are beyond their capacities. They are more like decoration to humanity and are not made to rule and govern humanity. Exhibit reasonable interest in things which they desire and give importance to them, but do not let them influence your opinions and do not let them impel you to go against your sane views.   Of course, these sayings have caused so much anger and butthurt from Shia women with big round asses and tits; and from my experiences from Arab women, Ali was right all along. I was way too blue pill to see what he meant and I disregarded these sayings for a long time, until I saw more and more women who behave, act, and think just the way he describes. I asked myself, ""Why should I get married to someone like that?""  Islam places a great emphasis on getting married and the belief that ""a woman competes a man's religion (""deen""). If a man doesn't get married, he is incomplete (religiously,spiritually and emotionally).   Shia Islam has a concept called temporary marriage (mut'ah), which is essentially a short marriage contract that can last from a minute to years. Men, if they're attractive and desirable enough, will use this to get laid. This is a concept that was instilled by the Prophet Muhammad and Shia Islam's highly revered Imams, because they understood men's needs and desires. It was also created for the distant traveler in mind, away from his wives. What's funny though is that temporary marriage is a much maligned concept by women (and funny enough, used by the horniest big ass women) and gynocentric trad-con parents. How does a man approach a woman for his sexual needs? But lucky for men, if a woman is of age (18 and above), she doesn't need the consent of her parents to fuck a guy, but you've got go be tall, dark, handsome, or very rich to fuck some Arab slut's ass. A guy likewise doesn't need the consent of his parents. Even in today's social and cultural climate, temporary marriage evokes the disgust of women and trad-cons across the Shia world. Temporary marriage is hated but only used by women when they get the wets for tall, dark, and handsome Alladin with a 9 inch cock. Me and my friends have many stories of horny hijabi's (scarfies) with nice and big round asses, small waist, and nice tits, and how they get rammed, most probably through temporary marriage--but in today's world, I doubt that as well.  If I was a religious MGTOW, it would be impossible for me to live a good Muslim life here in the West, since masturbation and pornography will subject you to eternal damnation with hell all around, and marriage to women will condemn me to earthly damnation, filled with no sex, then child support, and then spousal support."

MGTOW,3aaguu,sardinemanR,3,Thu Jun 18 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"All the religions actually have very strict rules on women and make them subservient to men.  And all of them have doomsday/end time prophesies where there are far more women than men and these women are all desperate to be married but men won't touch them.   There is no requirement to get married and it's not even preferable when a man can't act according to both his religious rights as well as the burdens. Right now religions place the burdens on men but refuse to give them the God granted rights.  Do not take the Western view of religion, or any mainstream view. If you are Christian, actually read the Bible, Corinthians especially is an excellent starting point, but the Bible is littered with masculinity and the rights of males.  A good post by the Muslim poster below, and I'll add you have to look at the Quran and ""sunnah"" for Islam. Again these are very masculine and place rules on women.  End time prophesies for all three major religions share so many similarities.   My guess is that the radical feminists win and manage to kill off most of the men somehow. And then only after going along with that plan do women realize what they did, and by then it's too late.   The preference is actually not to marry if you look at things, at least not a non-believing woman. And where are the believing women in this world now? There are none. Even Jesus states a good woman's value is far above rubies, that's because of how rare it is. For Islam it is similar, and those quotes do a good job showing how the great Muslims of the past understood women's nature and created a society where they couldn't cause damage.  These things shift over time, probably that shift is coming within 20 years. If you feel so strongly about marriage, then find a 16 year old virgin in 20 years and marry her. I know in Islam virginity is a requirement for women, and the Prophet Muhammad encouraged older men to marry younger women, so there is no age requirement. The Bible is actually the same too, virginity is a requirement for marriage.  How many Western women can meet that basic requirement? God never urges or orders men to marry unchaste women."
MGTOW,3aaguu,pirate6728,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:03:21 2015 UTC,One of our regulars here goes by the handle U/Isaiah4verse1. Ever read that passage? Read the passages immediately before that passage too. Seven women wanting one man. Why? War has decimated the male population to the point where the one man for seven women is likely all that's left. It's actually a rather cataclysmic passage of scripture.
MGTOW,3aaguu,sardinemanR,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:36:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is the verse I had in mind when I mentioned that. The women want the status of having a man's name.   I don't know when this will all come to be. But I assure you, it's coming.   First though is probably The Mark.   It's interesting to me also that these prophesies are shared for Islam too, there are some small differences but you get the main thrust.  Also read Revalations. For Islam you need to read into the ""hadith"" and there is a lot listed too. I think all men need to be reading all of this wisdom, most however only want the mainstream version peddled by organized religion, which I believe has been already compromised by feminism and will hide this stuff."

Here lately, I've seen some stuff that makes me wonder-- not about my religion, but about people I hang with apart from it.  Now, as it happens I'm twice divorced from the same woman-- so marrying again just isn't on the table.   But, as it happens--- marriage may be require by some churches. It is NOT a requirement for salvation or service biblically. Most believe that Jesus never married-- in fact, given what He knew about the prophesies concerning His life and how He would end up, it's likely that He wouldn't have burdened a woman with certain widowhood.  Paul was unmarried, and in fact recommended that other men who can do so should follow his example. A wife ties you down, being unmarried leaves you free to respond when the Spirit calls you to go.  As far as how God wants me to treat women-- He wants me to treat all people decently. Do evil unto no one, but overcome evil with good--- that sort of thing.

Celibacy is the highest ideal in Christianity - imitating Christ and his apostles. But St Paul recommends marriage if you are burning with lust or sexual desire. Better to marry he says rather than burn in this life and the next. As for marriage, it is quite strict, for both the man and the woman. Even Hinduism and Buddhism has a high regard for celibacy. In fact, apart from Mormonism and Islam, most other world religions hold celibacy as the ideal, especially for men who wish to go deeper into their religion."

MGTOW,3aaguu,DarkestJ,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"One of my earliest conceptions of MGTOW/the reason I have come to MGTOW was the fabled ""religious monk"" archetype. Those men (of both Eastern and Western religions) were the kind to fully give up any sort of ""normal"" life to embark on an adventure far less traveled. I respected these men because they crafted their own kind of destiny that led them to a way more unique lifestyle than that of their average counterparts.  So imo if you are thinking about those holy men then religion would be pro-MGTOW in that sense. Obviously, in modern times you see a ton of emphasis on marriage and such with the more popular religions but that archetype is still alive even though it is much more a minority these days.   For me personally, I don't consider myself ""religious"" in the common sense. I am a Deist which is a belief in a passive god that doesn't intervene in this world. Deism also doesn't have a description of said god so I don't even think of the ""old man in the sky"" sort of thing. With this kind of belief, all I can do is decide how to live my own life. Just like those monks and religious men I idolize. I can't exactly be like them, but MGTOW for me has become a more secular version of their lifestyle."
MGTOW,3aaguu,SoullessTechnocrat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:16:48 2015 UTC,"This is a subject I have been thinking on for months now. As it stands in today's society, marriage as it was intended is an impossibility. Women were once seen as a man's property and virginity was required for any woman to be fit for a heavenly matrimony, and you'll have more luck finding a unicorn than any girl who can fit that bill.  Though I'm ever approaching the agnostic/atheist mindset, I believe whatever God that would have created women and established aforementioned rules would prefer men acting as the MGTOW-minded gentlemen do. Like the other comments here outlined, there are several passages dictating it better to be a single man and revere his celibacy than dedicate his life to a common slut who thinks herself worthy of attention. What's more MGTOW than that?"

But that's Alabama for you; everyone here is Religious Crazy--that's why there's more churches per square mile than schools.)  Hellenism to me is really more about Arete (personal excellence) than anything else; which integrates with MGTOW pretty well. (But; when one has no excellence or even mediocrity in oneself, it leads to a falling out of sorts. At least this is the problem for me; being the terrible failure that I am.)  I'm justified by my observations and their conclusions from logic that show me that everything is terrible and that I cannot emerge from it for the better.

MGTOW,3aaguu,LearnedfrommyMistake,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"I simply point out that I believe what the bible says.  Proverbs 29:9 It is better to live in a corner of a roof             Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.  Proverbs 29:19 It is better to live in a desert land             Than with a contentious and vexing woman.  1 Corinthians 7:6-9 -- 6 But this I say by way of concession, not of command. 7 Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that.  8 But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I. 9 But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.  Matt. 19:11–12 ""Not all can accept this word, but only those to whom it is granted. Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of God. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it""    Then people reply with the following verses, or sentiments taken from them.  Proverbs 31:22 He who finds a wife finds a good thing             And obtains favor from the LORD.  Genesis 2:18 Then the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone;  There are a number of other verses that get get partially quoted in this way.  I don't recall all of them.    However, this is when I point out that there's more to that second verse.  18 Then the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.  Further, either or both sides might quote Proverbs 31.  My stance is that most women are no longer suitable help-metes, and that I am more likely to find support and aid from a group of friends than from a wife.  Also, I place emphasis on a particular part of the following verse.  Proverbs 31:10 An excellent wife, who can find?             For her worth is far above jewels.  Also, I ask them to read through the full list of the qualities of the Proverbs 31 excellent wife, and point out that modern women fall short of even half of that list.  People both religious and secular have decried that list as ""offensive"" or ""sexist"" or ""being held up as a false idol"" (yeah, that last one's obviously from the religious community).  Women have replied that ""that's not me, so I'll just concentrate on being my sassy spunky self.""  Those responses seem to prove my point.  In the end, Christianity does not demand marriage, and if you know your scripture, you can't be brow-beaten into marriage with scripture.  In fact, I have many family members who understand, or even support my decision not to get married... with the proviso that I remain celibate.  Given the risk that getting sexually involved with a woman holds atm... I don't particularly find this a troubling requirement of my faith."

You may find little value in describing the differences when you are getting pressured from people in your Church, but stating something like, ""Biblical marriage is impossible in today's culture, and I refuse to blaspheme God by engaging in a counterfeit,"" should be enough to get them off your back."

In practice women have far greater rights and far less accountability, and feminist will fight for more and more.

Pretty much everyone has had their heart broken at a point, or been betrayed by someone they loved.  However, most people are also able to get over it without completely losing their trust in the opposite gender based on prejudice. It's an extremely cowardly and immature reaction to pain.   I mean, some people suck, get over it. You wouldn't avoid cars and traffic altogether just because you were in an accident, would you?  Why would no woman help me? I mean, it doesn't surprise me that you don't have many female friends, but do you assume that I don't either? Or is it that you seriously are so disillusional that you think that no woman except your own mother is ever to be trusted?   Sacrifice my masculinity? What does that even mean? I hope I'm wrong, but do you seriously think that asking from help from a woman is sacrificing your masculinity? And that women will see you as weak if you need help?  If that's the case it only proves that you see women as weak when they ask for help.    I have no idea why you'd come after me, this was not about whatever you're trying to start.  OP seems confused and it doesn't seem like he belongs with /r/MGTOW or /r/theredpill, and certainly not /r/feminism if that's what he thinks.

MGTOW,3aekul,nerostorm,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:53:34 2015 UTC,"I believe every person no matter the gender has to earn their repect.   This one is true for men, but women are born with the ""pussy pass"". They often don't need to earn respect in order to get what they want. Young women get free stuff, are encouraged to treat men like shit and get away with everything by playing the victim. Don't even mention respect, because most women didn't ever need to understand this concept. It's mostly reserved for men. The only thing women associate with respect is that men have to respect women. Yet the mainstream media actively teaches women to disrespect men.   What makes you think I was taught that women in any way are inherently ""good people"".   Well, we have opposing views on the topic ""gender-equality"". I can't understand why somebody embraces egalitarianism despite the fact that the two genders have fundamentaly different life paths and unique gender problems + hormones. IMHO gender differences should be accepted in order to maintain a functional society. Even you said that the feminists over in America are a pain in the ass. The world doesn't seem to be very balanced after embracing feminism for decades masqueraded as ""gender-equality"".  Back to your question, despite the facts presented directly in your face and being mistreated by feminists you're pegging me as a sucker. Makes me almost think that you're socially conditioned to be a white knight. ""But not all women are like that"", well then let me introduce you to AWALT. Maybe you'll want to watch this video by Ms. Davison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk_WaTdhyT0   Pretty much everyone has had their heart broken at a point, or been betrayed by someone they loved.  However, most people are also able to get over it without   completely losing their trust in the opposite gender based on prejudice. It's an extremely cowardly and immature reaction to pain.    Oh jeez, if it only was this one thing :) The rabbit hole goes waaaaaaay deeper than my personal negative experiences with women. If you support egalitarism you should not only take a look at the female side of it. There are fucking reasons why mgtow is growing and men's right activism exists.   it doesn't surprise me that you don't have many female friends, but do you assume that I don't either?   I'm pretty sure that you have female friends. Can't remember mentioning this.   Or is it that you seriously are so disillusional that you think that no woman except your own mother is ever to be trusted?   Things are never only black and white. Yes, most women can't be trusted because they are manipulative by nature. It's their primary drive to gain influence and power.   I hope I'm wrong   Yes, you got me wrong on this one. I'm far away from that macho shit you've mentioned. On the contrary I think that it's very important to let a man express his emotions and ask for help if he needs to.   And that women will see you as weak if you need help?   Yes, they will degrade you unconsciously and it'll dry out their genitals. Have you ever seen an adult woman liking sensitive, wimpy guys? If I need help I'm better off asking a guy who understands my unique problems and doesn't see me as a bitch for crying or grieving. He'll rather build me back up than emasculate me.   Sacrifice my masculinity?   Let's say you fall into a deep depression. The female approach to help you is emasculating you. They'll tell you to let go of your anger, stop doing aggressive things and working like crazy. What they won't tell you is to accept your pain, anger and grief and that the best way by far to kill a depression is increasing your testosterone levels. There are fundamental differences between male and female depression. Man naturally are problem solvers and actively looking for a way to go on with their lifes whereas women tend to dwell and rely on others to fix their depression.  It was really interesting to hear your insights."

You're obviously not going to thank someone for stealing your car because your car has no say in the matter and the decision to steal was based solely on the perp. However, when it comes to sex with a married woman, it takes 2 people to make that decision. If one of those people (male) decides not to go through with it, the other person (female) will eventually find someone as morally corrupt as her who will. See my point?"

Now why should you be thankful if chad thundercock sleeps with your chick? Because he has shown you her true colors. He has proven she is a lying, deceitful whore that needs to be cut loose asap.

But there is no reason to not be angry at the other kid. Similarly, ""Chad Thundercock"" may expose your wife's true colours, but it is human nature to be tempted. In a truly moral society people, would respect each other enough to not exploit their temptations. Men cheat as well and in fact, TRP encourages them to cheat. This is a double standard in that community. 3. Being cheated on should not ruin your life and you should never expect 100% commitment in your relationship to begin with.

Finally, chad thundercock (no matter how morally bankrupt his is) does'nt owe you an apology.

Getting married runs into money—for living, children’s education and so on. If you get divorced, then you’re stuck with alimony payments. There’s no point in devoting any time to these things.

MGTOW,3a99nk,codemoney,3,Thu Jun 18 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome post. I definitely identify more 'kosupa-kei' than 'zesshoku danshi'.  Just going to be lazy and propose a question rather than answer it my self:   In a follow-up article published the next day, Nikkan Gendai undertook a “kosupa” breakdown, hypothetically comparing two men employed in the auto sales industry, one a lifelong bachelor and the other a man who marries at age 30 and fathers two children. Although the overall cost of raising each child exceeds 30 million yen, the married man is still projected to have total assets of 27.19 million yen at age 65, as opposed to the bachelor’s 24.11 million yen. And at age 85, the married man will have 18.9 million yen in assets, compared to 15.87 million held by the bachelor.  Nikkan Gendai’s conclusion: Marriage may have its pitfalls, but lifelong bachelorhood carries no clear financial advantage.   Does this factor in the probability of divorce?   “In these times, one married couple out of three winds up divorcing,” says a woman"
MGTOW,3a99nk,SirGrump,4,Thu Jun 18 11:20:53 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt it takes into account divorce.   Divorce, alimony, child support are clearly huge financial setbacks for men and in the US you have a 50% chance of getting hammered by these if you marry.  As a life long bachelor (56 years old, recently retired) I accumulated significant assets.   I never spent much at all on women.   Even my worst experience which was cohabitating with a girlfriend for a few years before getting kicked out of her house only resulted in about a $10K financial hit (the BPD bitch kept all my furniture and improvements I built).  No big deal, just another adventure.    But I worked with many divorced men during my career who took huge financial damage due to community property losses, alimony and child support."

How can they isolate a married man's assets when taking ""community property"" into account? Are they adding his wife's projected income into the equation (then deducting price of raising kids) to get the higher asset number?   My point is this, how in the hell can the married man have MORE assets than the single man if they're truly isolating incomes of the men only?  There's probably variables here they don't want readers to see, like PROJECTED DIVORCE RATE(S) for one, not to mention the living hell of spending a lifetime with a never-satisfied female, stress through the roof, clogged arteries and all the other wonderful stress-related maladies.

They show off the strength in a woman's leg, especially that calf muscle which looks stunning in high heels.      Good post anyway.   Thanks.   ""Gamer"" feminists aren't united though. They all have different standards and not all can be fulfilled.   So far I've identified two groups of feminist gamers.   Sex positive feminists  They are reasonable and open minded. They can easily be as sexually devious and dirty minded as us.  I personally would like to see them enjoy the same type of content we guys get to enjoy in games.  This also increases the chances of landing a gamer girlfriend which a lot of guys would welcome I think.  Sex Negative Feminists  I don't want to say anything mean here. I've learned that sex negative feminists have experienced certain trauma growing up that makes them not comfortable when confronted with attractive females, even in a video game.  I still think they deserve to enjoy games too, but a gaming company needs to clearly know what type of game they are making and make sure they don't change it just to be politically correct.    Summary  Remember these terms. If you identify a woman who potentially just wants to remove all sexual content from a game, then she is a sex negative feminist, but first ask her the question:    ""Do you want immersion and equality OR censorship in gaming?""  That question should get her to reveal her true intentions. If she ends up being sex positive and just wants true immersion in gaming, then she is just like us and deserves it IMO.  There are a lot of cool female gamers out there who just want to maintain immersion while playing games and want some sexy eye candy too, like handsome sexy male NPC's.   What do you guys think?    Should we let them have their eye candy too as long as it doesn't lead to censorship of the things we like?"

That is why I liked it when Obisidan took the reigns for KOTOR 2 because they gave more of a nuance to the dark side and even made the main villain (Kreia imo) take this stance where she wants to destroy the Force rather than become generic take-over-the-world Dark Lord.

MGTOW,3a4z14,CrassHydra,15,Wed Jun 17 07:11:18 2015 UTC,"Just remember, no matter how everything turns out, you are ultimately in control of how your life plays out. You control your actions and reactions. Imagine yourself ten years from now, twenty years from now, enjoying the fruits of your labor. Do you want to say you achieved what you used to only dream, or do you want to wallow in self pity knowing you let those years go by living on someone else's terms?  You get eight decades if you are lucky, then nothing....ever....again. Fuck others' opinions about how you should spend the only thing you have. Find the things in life that you love (this can and will evolve with time) and live the shit outta it. The world needs more passionate people.  One way to get them off your back may be to say ""I'm disappointed you're  not supportive of how I want to live"". Even if they backpedal, it should get them to stop bringing it up without putting more thought into it."
MGTOW,3a4z14,absurdi5t,8,Wed Jun 17 07:38:03 2015 UTC,"IMO the easiest explanation is to simply say you ""haven't met any women worthy of your attention or interest... yet.""  Yes, that will alter the conversation to something akin to you being ""too picky"", but that IME is just all too easily (even laughably) deflected by citing some of the examples of the women you HAVE met, to wit, you can say:   Well, would you have me date & possibly marry say ""Brunhilda"" -- this woman in my statistics class who keeps trying to cheat off my notes -- by the way Brunhilda is getting a bit obese, and has a rather poor reputation, not surprising as she has 3 different kids from 3 different ""baby daddies"".  Would you REALLY want HER as a [daughter/sister] ""in-law""? Or how about ""Brittany""? No kids, but apparently she's had at least one abortion (and rumor has it several) ... and she's got some other obvious ""eating"" problems (binging & purging: bulimia, etc) as well as apparently some issues with drugs & alcohol, and you know for a fact that she's on prescription anti-depressants. Or... how about that radical-feminist-marxist/goth gal named ""Jamie"" (note the androgynous name), who you're not even certain is a female, and at times you wonder if she (it?) is even human... And... well, if you are AT all ""sociable"" or observant, you can EASILY create an almost never-ending list here.   Basically you corner them into the position of arguing that you SHOULD engage in some kind of VERY LOW (almost non-existent) standards or even some ""Captain Save-A-Hoe"" thing; which allows you to tell them that if THEY want to ""take in (and pay for/deal with) some fucked up/possibly psycho single-mom with N-count crotchspawn brats"", well they are welcome to do it themselves, but you're not planning on doing anything that idiotic."

Focus on your studies, maybe tell them you want to focus on studies/career and don't want to deal with the drama or time investment.   People usually don't have a comeback if I start talking about how bad marriage, courts, and dating is for guys today. Do what you want and don't let others shame you for wanting to better yourself."

MGTOW,3a4z14,TheQuestion78,5,Wed Jun 17 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"I can't give too many suggestions but I'm actually dealing with something similar. My parents sort of shame me for not wanting a relationship but it is mainly my brother. He constantly tries to embarrass me infront of other people in my extended family. For example, if I haven't seen an uncle for a while he'll maybe throw out the question, ""How many girlfriends you got."" You know, in a joking kind of manner. Usually at these moments my brother will make it his job to make me seem like a loser by saying things like ""JMS230 doesn't want to date or get married"" or ""He's such a loser, he must be gay."" This isn't true because I am straight. I end up having to explain my MGTOW position all the time and its just very awkward because of my brother. The suggestion I'll give you is to just know that in maybe 5 or 10 years you'll be in a more distant relationship with your parents and it wont matter what they think and you'll be on your way to greatness.

Don't discuss it, don't debate it, don't justify it. You say ""I've made my position clear, and I'm sick of your disrespect for it and for me. This conversation is over"".  You decide how others treat you by your tolerance of their behaviour. If you don't like what they are doing, don't tolerate it. Change how they treat you.  People are happy to make decisions for others when there's no consequences for them in that. Find a way to make their attitude cost them and then go out of your way to make the most obvious display of doing what they said they wanted, to their detriment.  The burnt hand is the best teacher. I've never failed to modify behaviour by applying negative stimulus (though to be fair, I'm a royal cunt, so that's not really surprising such a strategy comes naturally to me).  You could always try positive reinforcement, that has a great deal of scientific and practical supporting evidence. Still, it requires superhuman will IME. Stop associating with them.  Don't go home for summer, or if you do don't stay with them or socialise with them to any great degree."

I too value my self worth highly which is why so many other guys' actions annoy me. You shouldn't lower your own worth in order to get your dick into some pussy.  Also, my parents have only begun to put pressure on me to have a family of my own too. I am very open with the fact that I have never had a girlfriend (but I haven't straight up said I have zero interest in dating and relationships because I am still deciding on that) so they try to push me on that front but I tend to shut them down.

MGTOW,3a4z14,mgthrow,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"The big deciding question will be where you stand on children.  If you plan not to have any of your own, let your parents know not to expect grandchildren from you ever in the future. That should take a lot of the pressure off. Now if later in life you happen to marry a single mom with kids, they'll get step grandchildren, but that could be a bonus, not an expectation.  If you decide you want to have kids of your own, you can point out to the family that to get the best possible ""deal"" you wait until your SMV/MMV is at it's peak, many years down the road, and your future wife has time to get career aspirations out of the way. So this is basically a MGTOW delaying tactic, but at least they have that to chew on.  If you plan to adopt, or are thrust into that scenario due to infertility, then you have all the time in the world.  Ergo, it's another delaying tactic.  So while you delay, you can use the time to work on inner game, mastery of your profession, and wealth building.  All of these will improve your SMV/MMV."
MGTOW,3a4z14,infoscott,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"If your family keeps pestering you to date, they are inviting you to give them the Red Pill. Tell them that marriage is obviously (in its current iteration) a financial scam that women run on unsuspecting men, and the complacent support for this scam coming from your family and women in general tells you everything you need to know about the cohort (women) they are encouraging you to date.   It's a trap, and you will have no part in it.   Most families just want grandchildren, so tell them that you might someday want children (if you might), but that you'll have to go through surrogacy because you want a guarantee that you have access to your children. If your family wants to help you with paying for surrogacy, you'd gladly accept their help in a few years, but you're not going to deal with women so you can provide your family with children."

MGTOW,3a4z14,DarkestJ,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"tl;dr Use shit-test techniques until you move out, then it will be much better.  This isn't really a shit test, as your parents aren't trying to see if you are man enough to be with them. But while the motive differs, it puts you on the spot the same way - and the same techniques to handle these are all applicable.    You're still in school. Once you graduate, you will find it much easier to control your own space. At that point, without doing a psychotic Molyneiux-style deFoo, you can however cut down on contact somewhat and make at your convenience. Let the phone go to voice mail, pick it up next time they call, tell them you were busy and couldn't take the call. Suddenly they will cherish what contact they can get, and be less prone to pushing you away with bullshit. I know, playing hard-to-get with your own family shouldn't be necessary - but if they're deeply and disfunctionally blue pill you wiill have to look out for your self.    ==  Caveat - In my day, we walked uphill to school both ways in the snow, and we liked it. But seriously, I come from a time where ""free range"" children were the norm. We didn't have helicopter parents, and weren't continually buffeted by the prop wash of micro-management. So I don't have life experience breaking away from that type of scene to assert my own selfhood. If that's the case for you, see it clearly as that and google accordingly."
MGTOW,3a4z14,User-31f64a4e,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:55:46 2015 UTC,"Financially independent middle aged MGTOW here.  The two pieces of advice I wish an older and wiser man had given me (and convinced my dumb ass to listen to, somehow) are:  Exercise.    Especially lift.  Cut the fatty and sugary crap out of your diet before you get fat.  Obviously don't smoke, drink only in moderation, take care of your teeth, and fuck suntans seriously.  It will improve your mental health, your confidence, and people will treat you better.  Surprisingly, not just women but men too.  It sucks, but people treat you better when they think you can kick their ass, even if you have no intention of doing so.  Stronglifts 5x5 if you don't know where to start.  Take ownership of your body.  You don't need the ""cool kids' "" permission.  Try to start thinking of yourself as a physical person, not just intellectual.  Trust me, they are not mutually exclusive, no matter what you thought in high school.  Save and invest.    Start at 10% of your before-tax income.  Go to 20% if/when you can, maybe after paying off a car loan for instance.  Should be possible as an engineer.  Don't worry too much about which investments.  You can just do dopey index funds if you want.  Main thing is to put as much money in as possible while you're young.  You can do this by renting a slightly less fancy apartment, buying a slightly less loaded up car, trimming back your cable TV or cell phone service plan, etc.  It's not that painful.  Don't worry about your family.  Try to get along with them, and don't argue for the sake of arguing, even if you're sure you're right.  If they're like mine, they're simple working class religious people who don't know any better.  If you're smart enough to be an engineer, you're smart enough to come up with a better plan for your life.  Just quietly go about the business of being awesome.  They will be amazed that you accomplished so much when you're older.  That's exactly what happened to me.  :)"

Seriously, minimize the number of occasions AND the length of time that you HAVE to be around or interact with them -- IOW if it's some ""holiday"" thing that you HAVE to attend... well show up ""early"" so you can spend time with the 'rents, and then leave relatively early as well (or if that is what the bluepill relatives do, then do the opposite, show up right at/before meal time and then {after enduring the BS} extend the visit later).  Because really... they're not worth the bother.    BTW unlike a lot of others in this thread, I'm not going to fault you for having upbraided her about her eating, because: 1) we have no idea HOW you did it (it could have been some casual, even humorous, informal statement that she ""trigger"" reacted to because she's {yet another} fucking DRAMA QUEEN); 2) we have no idea just HOW egregious her ""piling the food on"" actually was; 3) we also don't know the ""context"", the general family dynamics, etc (I know many cases where the female is an outright BITCH to other people, making all kinds of derogatory remarks, but the instant someone ""fires back"" they play the helpless little ""victim"" and all of the BP/WK types rush to their defense).  Nor do I think you should necessarily ""apologize"" -- there are instances when that MIGHT be appropriate, but there are just as many (IMO far more these days) where you should NOT, because the little ""crying victim"" ploy is just WAAAAY too overplayed; I mean this chick is purportedly an ADULT, correct?

You can talk about invading other countries with your generals but you wouldn't do the same when meeting with enemy world leaders. Be appropriate in each situation. Talk about work with your colleagues, talk about basic topics with strangers, and talk about MGTOW with only your true friends.

Instead of leading the Pequod on a whaling voyage for profit, Ahab seeks revenge on the whale and casts his spell over the crew-members to enlist them in his fanatical mission. When Moby Dick is finally sighted and hunted down, Ahab's hate robs him of all caution and denies him revenge. Moby Dick drags Ahab to his death.

Big problem there.  Outside of weird ""feeder"" fetishes, most people don't find overweight people attractive. It's an overt signal of poor discipline, poor health, and a don't give a shit attitude. Apart from real health issues, it causes real relationship problems. In my experience lots of LTRs/marriages go south because one partner becomes an overweight slob after settling down. I know quite a few couples who split up after some years of marriage because of lost attraction. What was the first thing both parties did? Hit the gym, lost weight, became attractive again. It's biology, man, can't fight it.  I'm not saying I want all women to be a size 0, some weight is inevitable as you get older. But both have to stay in shape or there will be real consequences for relationships."

After 1980 that's when numbers across the board blow up.  In 1980 is when the US first came out with Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which started to encourag stupid things like eating as little fat as possible and increase servings of grain products.  That influenced things like school lunches and food assistant programs, and started the low fat craze where they replace fat with HFCS.  That also influenced other western government, and I'm guessing that is when obesity started to sky rocket in the other western and european countries too.  So yes there is individual responsibility, however it's really difficult when you have the government telling to eat the exact wrong way for all of your life."

Or -- in the case of some ""friend"" you are attempting to help out -- then do NOT let them move in without having them sign some kind of a written contractual agreement (i.e. even just an ""Agreement to Rent a Room in a Private Residence"" -- there are ""standard"" ones on the internet), one that has ""terms"" outlined regarding legal requirements, including the ability for YOU to end the agreement upon proper written notice (usually 30 days), etc.  Why?  Because otherwise anyone who is living with you (regardless of whether they are paying rent), can all too easily establish it as their ""legal residence"" -- and, especially if you are without any written contract (containing conditions they must maintain to remain) it is actually significantly HARDER to ""evict"" them if they don't ""want"" to leave.  Trust me, having a written agreement -- and therefore the ability to legally enforce an eviction -- is well worth having (you only regret it if/when you DON'T have it, and by then it's too late -- better safe than sorry)."

It's my personal estimate (and my attorney agrees) that probably well over 90% of peoples legal problems (criminal AND civil; business AND personal) are a direct result of them making ""foolish assumptions"" and worse, specifically trying to avoid putting anything down (especially anything important) in writing.  Good, well written contracts -- both in business AND when that crosses over into ""personal"" territory -- make for ""clean"" and (providing both parties are paying attention TO the creation of the contract & negotiating its terms) also inherently fair relationships, their creation, their ""operation/maintenance"" and even any eventual dissolution or breakup or ending of it.  Yet it never ceases to amaze me... just how often people seem to want to ""dance"" on the edge of a proverbial cliff, and to do so without ANY kind of a ""net"" or ""rope""; and worse even if/when they DO have a written contract, they don't seem to want to READ the damned thing before signing (where's the X?); and they often strive to AVOID putting down what are basic/fundamental points (to wit: what work is to be done {with specifics}, WHEN is it to be done {start AND finish}, and what schedule of payments are to be made {especially relative to the previous points}, and then finally what REMEDIES are available if the previous conditions/terms are not met), instead they INSIST on relying on the fact that they have ""discussed"" those things (verbally).  Damned fools, IMHO.  I spend MINIMAL amounts of time and money (trivial really) on getting legal advice & counsel IN ADVANCE. And thus almost entirely AVOID ending up in court (and court is one of, if not THEY quickest way to blow through TONS of money {and squander countless hours of time over weeks, months & years} trying to ""remedy"" or ""mitigate"" the damages from a problem... that probably could have been avoided in the first place, with 1/100th of the effort & probably 1% of the dollars)."

Even more of a ""wtf"" look is when you discover and point out massive/blatant errors* that got overlooked, or things that unquestionably need to be changed/corrected/fixed (and even though I are not the one who created or caused the error, merely the person who noticed it in time to correct it... nevertheless they somehow want to blame me as if *I* were the one who is ""causing a problem"").  * We're talking MAJOR stuff, like a contract that has a major (X times) mistake in terms of quantity versus the cost -- yet not so outrageous that it would be seen by the courts as an unenforceable ""mistake"" (and indeed, I have known of several instances where the faulty numbers WERE forced to be treated as real/correct, to the significant loss of one of the parties).    BTW a hint towards that is that all ""small numbers"" in contracts should actually be spelled out in word form as well as having a numerical value -- because it is VERY easy to ""fat finger"" or otherwise mistype some numerical value (even accidentally tossing a zero on the end, etc) -- but it is incredibly unlikely that you will the person writing the contract (assuming they actually comprehend what they are doing) will make the SAME error in text form; i.e. accidentally typing ""10"" or even ""14"" when you meant ""1"" is much more likely than accidentally typing ""ten"" or ""fourteen"" instead of ""one"".  Moreover this is ""ancient"" knowledge, won over the long-term and paid for by many mistakes -- it's why, for example, checks always USED to require a hand-written text amount (which then ""ruled"", the numeric line was just an extra ""convenience"")."

I don't think that -- the so called ""equal relationship"" (or ""relationship of two equals"") -- was ever actually a real thing.  Nor do I think that it would be any sort of ""ideal"" even if it did exist (and I draw from the example of the business world, that 50/50 equal partnerships are known to be fundamentally disastrous in terms of structure and how it actually plays out; better to have even an upfront 51/49 {or 60/40} arrangement).  Because otherwise, it is invariably going to end up with ""deadlock"" -- with the so called ""partners"" then engaging in either a manipulation/trickery, or else outright intimidation (i.e. whoever shouts the loudest, or plays the dirtiest... wins).  This is one point that I am in full agreement with something discussed over on TRP -- every ""relation-ship"" (just like any other ""ship"") needs to have ONE and only one ""Captain"", the spouse can then function as a ""first officer"" (aka ""Exec"") and has extensive authority via delegation, but NOT the ability to ""veto"" or deadlock a situation."

It also means men must stop rewarding them based on sex appeal alone.  The massive industry of female sex appeal should be devalued.  Of course they will do anything they can to try to keep these privileges but real equality means they must give them up. It's a long road and I actually think MGTOW thinking is a kind of push for true equality and accountability.  Many women will fail, just as many men fail, with no safety net.  All we have to do is give them no privilege or aid we would not give to a fellow man.  Never indulge hyper emotionality or shaming tactics. Instead expose them and ignore them for it.

Being around women is legally dangerous enough as it is, but having one living inside the powder keg of the domestic home is asking for (legal) trouble sooner or later.  Especially nowadays when we know most domestic violence is committed by women.    Family and intimate relationships—the one area feminists often identify as a key battleground in the war on women—are also an area in which women are most likely to be violent, and not just in response to male aggression but toward children, elders, female relatives or partners, and non-violent men, according to a study published in the Journal of Family Violence.   Woman assaults you, police come, you go to jail.  I know somebody this happened to.  Wrecked his life.  He still lives with a (different) girlfriend though.  Serious dumbass."

Got news for you there dude...  you don't even need to be ""convicted"" to essentially (for all practical purposes) lose your second amendment rights.  All that needs to happen with any ""domestic violence"" thing is for her to claim that she is ""afraid"" and to file for a ""Temporary Restraining Order"" (TRO) or sometimes known as a ""Protection Order"" -- and most courts now ISSUE those without even a ""hearing"", and even if/when they DO conduct such an event, it's simply an exercise in ""rubber stamp"" application on behalf of the ""pussy pass"".  In many (and increasingly more*) states and municipalities, one automatic consequence of a TRO or PO is the seizure/confiscation of any/all firearms that the subject may possess. (And no, you can't just hand it over to your buddy ""Joe"" for him to lock up in his gun safe. Ostensibly you CAN have the guns held on your behalf by a licensed gun dealer, but generally speaking you would have had to have done so in advance of the TRO being issued.)  *Gun control advocates are using this as a sort of ""behind the scenes"" means of enacting a shitload of stricter laws regarding firearms."

Some of that, doubtless has to do with the audience, especially on Reddit, containing a lot of ""ESL"" people who are not familiar with idioms and colloquial usage; but on the other hand many things that used to be considered ""good form"" are now denigrated as archaic, and the vast majority of the population (even so called ""native"" English speakers) are increasingly ignorant of any works prior to the modern blockbuster film era (to wit, a vast number of people think that the concept of the ""matrix"" as portrayed in the film of that name is somehow a recently invented thing; they are entirely ignorant of the long history of that ""dream/faux world"" scenario).

I have been seeing dictionaries appear to act very prescriptively, changing the primary definitions of terms to suit the obscure meanings of words that feminist redefine (an example: the first definition of sexism in the entry at the footnote (1) is not the primary or historic meaning of the word).     I would like to observe that while it is descriptive of the way modern feminists use the word 'misogyny', it presents the definition as-though the recent feminist redefinition is the primary definition. It doesn't add that dislike of, mistrust of, and discrimination against women is a modern addition to an older normalized and commonly expected meaning of the term. It doesn't offer a first definition of hatred, and a second definition of the other crap that's been tacked on. As an attempt to clarify my meaning, imagine a feminist calls someone a misogynist in a crowd of people. Almost everyone (feminists included) would think ""she means: he hates women"" not ""she means: he might hate women, or might dislike women, or might distrust women, or might be biased against women"". Even if she was not using the term to specifically say he hated women.     But again I might be doing a bit of the tin-foil hat thing, attributing intentions to dictionaries that aren't there.

That such a thing is utterly inane and fundamentally unjust -- that so called ""racism reparations"" (which are also fundamentally unjust & unfair) are nevertheless by comparison logical and sensible.  But if any man dares to speak AGAINST such (in any way) -- they are declared ""predjudiced against women"" and labeled as ""misogynistic"".    Of course you any LOGICAL examination of this entirely missed the point:  This is NOT a ""logical"" argument, the term is not intended to have any RATIONAL basis -- it is solely and wholly and emotion-based rhetorical ""smear"" campaign; i.e. a all-out-ATTACK campaign based on hate and with the intention of causing division, dramatics, and chaos.  Undermining the language -- and inverting the concepts -- is just part and parcel of that kind of the thing: the more confused and off-balance they can keep their opponents the more they can succeed at the ""divide and conquer"" campaign (meanwhile, using money and influence to further their agenda via the political system, where there are vested interests that are MORE than happen to go along, since it serves as a nice distracting ""side show"" that keeps the population from becoming aware of what is REALLY going on in other aspects of government)."

If you are part of the oppressed any injustice you suffer is automatically associated with the lexicon of that group's oppressed status and offered up as further evidence.  Anyone else, though who suffers isn't even to be acknowledged, to the point where feminists claim that men, for example can not be oppressed by women in any way, that it is structurally impossible!  This is a gross distortion in several ways.  It wrongly associates every unfair thing a person experiences with a deliberate act of malice against the said demographic, when actually everyone experiences injustice.  Just because you were unfairly treated is not evidence of discrimination because of affiliation with said demographic.  The world is full of people and organizations that will crap all over you if you let them.  They do not care if you are black, white, male or female etc.  They only care if they can get away with it.

She found out what I liked and used what I liked in order to communicate something differently.  And yes, women do and will take advantage of you if you let them.  That's why you have to think long term and act on your long term interests.  I like that women are constantly testing us and each other - yes they also do it to other women.  It's not so much a test though as much as it's simply they're trying to figure out how to get what they want from you I think.  I think some of MGTOW ways of thought are stupid when they do things like breed resentment or hatred against women that is unjust.  But I know that there are legitimate rape victims of women and legitimate victims in divorce court that others wouldn't accept nearly as much if it was a woman in the situation.  Again, taking the example of my Therapist - when I was being mean or cold and defensive - she would end the session early at times but explained to me that I wouldn't come to her and see her if she behaved that way.

The more I realize that they just basically want to grab the attention of a dominant male and make him submissive to her/ as well as dominant over her where necessary.   Attention of, or more specifically to gain access to (and eventually control over) his economic resources and assets.  If and when THAT isn't possible, then they ""dial it down"" and seek out some successful (i.e. economically, and possibly minimally) ""beta"" male.   However, she will only respect you if you're dominant but then also give her your attention. She will escalate things if she likes you so that you will fight her so she won't get more of your resources - which is still a win for her because your expending precious energy on her.   The problem with this -- the whole ""holding frame"" bit -- is that inevitably/eventually every man will ""slip""; either in the form of giving too much attention (or too little), or too much access to his resources (or too little) -- and the female will use that as an occasion to go ""off the reservation"" so to speak; and in essence establishing her OWN ""dominance"" (even if surreptitiously) either by cuckolding him (aka ""cheating"" on him), or else squandering his resources.  Case in point: look at any of several DOZEN examples of the VERY successful/powerful (and generally dominant/domineering) men who have been ""laid low"" by women.

MGTOW,3a1lw6,thrownaway_MGTOW,2,Wed Jun 17 04:48:56 2015 UTC,"Note: previous comment I chiefly focused on the last sentence... the rest deserves to be addressed as well:   true. that is because we all want to stop playing and just be ourselves.    I really don't think that is true of many people.  I fact, I think the vast majority of them are MASSIVELY afraid of actually honestly ""being themselves"".  One indication (or IMO proof) of that is that so many of them seem to literally FEAR being ""alone"" (and more specifically ""alone with their THOUGHTS"" -- cf distractions presently) for any length of time; they seem to require almost continual validation of even their existence, much less their ""identity,"" via social interaction of some form with other people (or else they need to ""escape"" their self-thoughts via some distraction or another, be it TV or music, or some ""game"" or these days constant texting & facebooking, etc.)     this is not possible with women as the constant 'game' holding frame and all is just tiring.   Yes and yet no.  It think it is not possible with certain TYPES of women -- and these days that is probably the overwhelming majority, at least of ""available"" women (i.e. AWALT or more properly ASSPOWALT).  I do think it IS possible -- and without constant ""game"" or the faux ""holding frame"" act/routine -- but that requires actually being a MAN instead of a clueless boy pretending to be a man.    Now the above if sort of a contrast (even a seeming contradiction) to my previous comment.  But I don't see it as actually being a contradiction... rather that I need to clarify that the ""more ethical gender"" aspect really only applies to actual ""men"".  In terms of the ""boys pretending to be men"" (which includes a lot of guys who ARE physically well into their biological ""adult"" years -- hell it can even include guys all the way to old age)... then in that case, yes they are ""weaker"" -- but I think the weakness is NOT due to gender or biology, but rather to nurture & how they were raised (Cf BEE's ""Generation Wuss"")."

Now on the other hand, if we're talking about confidence & competence, then yes... but only if it's real (and based on real skills, abilities, etc).    One of the things I see as probably THE major problem with most of the ""kiddies"" who are popping TRP/PUA stuff... is that (and they self-admit this) they don't REALLY ""feel"" like they are ""men"", but rather that they are still ""boys"" masquerading in an adult male body.  And the thing is that it's true -- most of them AREN'T actually ""men"" -- and moreover they have no clue how to actually BECOME men (hence the focus on either exercise & bodybuilding {i.e. the physical appearance of what's sold as an ""image"" of a man} and/or fucking pussy/notch count as some validation-- because those are just about the only things they believe will make them a ""man"" -- {although personally I think both are ridiculous; I mean exactly how many reps or much do you need to ""lift"" to presto-chango become a ""man""; or in the case of pussy, exactly which pussy do they think will do that for them {i.e. if the first one didn't, will the second? the fifth? the tenth? is there some ""magic"" that happens once you fucked pussy #100? Or is it only successful impregnation? If the latter, the PUA's & TRP'ers are SOL.}).  And yeah... even ASKING that question then gets one back to the ""cliche"" of defining what is a ""real man"" -- and any attempt to do that these days (even here) will trigger a ""pile on"" of dipshits & douchebags from all directions, since they automatically equate it with the calls for men to ""man up & marry a slut"" or similar nonsense.  But even though people (including so called ""redpill"" and even self-labeled ""MGTOW"" types) WILL do that... that doesn't mean that there isn't a valid definition of a ""man"" in terms of internal sense of self, accompanied by actions, attitudes, accomplishments, etc."

MGTOW,3a1lw6,thrownaway_MGTOW,2,Fri Jun 19 09:24:30 2015 UTC,"agreed. I can understand confidence (in oneself, etc) but competence? Are your referring to work place here? Competence in what?   In lots of different things/anything.  The point being that there are people who are ""confident"" yet their confidence is a delusion, since they really don't know WTF they are doing.  Just as one extreme example to make the point, the case of Chris McCandless (i.e. the guy in the book & movie entitled ""Into the Wild"", who went ""off the beaten track"" hiking in Alaska {and purposefully didn't take a map, etc -- he didn't really go ""into the WILD[erness]"" since in point of fact there really isn't any such thing anymore}) -- he was massively confident, and yet lacked the competence in the skills he needed to successfully do what he was attempting (and it isn't that he was stupid, although I think it coule be argued that he made rather idiotic choices; nor was it that he was ignorant a he had done research and even took certain wildlife flora/fauna guidebooks with him, but he'd never really practiced the skills... book knowledge is seldom sufficient).     what makes man a man, then?    Ah... and be damned for daring to define it.   does it is experience that comes with age? you can still have inexperienced 40 year olds and matured 35yo?   Experience DOES require time, but more importantly it required actions... actually doing.   Obviously there are a LOT of inexperienced 40 year olds (and probably not a few who don't yet feel like they are ""men""), and by contrast I would posit that there are not only a lot of mature 35 year olds, but if you look historically there were quite a few ""men"" who were essentially mature in their early teens (and there are probably some of those today as well, though given the overprotective helicopter parents, the pervasive single-mom and/or absentee father, they are probably a lot fewer)."
MGTOW,3a1lw6,Morranaii,2,Fri Jun 19 09:44:04 2015 UTC,"Experience DOES require time, but more importantly it required actions... actually doing.   Absolutely.

Like he spent that time closed in a cave, or in hibernation. So, people are different.   Yet, I did not found that women level of maturity varies significantly from when they are like 26 to when they're e.g. 36.   It's like they don't really need to grow and develop beyond the levels that are absolutely necessary for their well-being (or wb of their egos/personas, because some might think they're at the top of the world yet being addicted to alcohol- for example)"

Like he spent that time closed in a cave, or in hibernation. So, people are different.    Yes.  I mean in some cases it isn't entirely their ""fault"" -- a lot of it is determined by where you grow up, what your parents are like, what opportunities you've have had (and in some very real senses what challenges you have faced & responsibilities you've needed to bear: often zero challenges = zero experience = continued adolescent mindset).  OTOH a lot of it is determined by how ""aggressive"" they were in their teens -- I mean heck by the time I was 21 I'd already started and run not just one, but two successful businesses over the prior decade (and not lemonade stand stuff, we're talking one was a mail order & custom manufacturing thing, and the other was a software business {rare at the time, but still}), and was in the process of starting a third (which within 2 years had a half dozen employees). Nor were those the only things I'd done at the time -- I'd also headed up several different ""projects"" that had 30+ thousand dollar budgets (which back then was significant money, basically the price of an average home), helped design & build a small recording studio, etc.  I have literally told people that really (as a general rule of thumb) people who go out on their own at say age 18 (i.e. working, renting, living on their own & maintaining their own ""home"" even if just an apartment) compared to say someone who is ""coddled"" by well-meaning but overly protective/providing parents... and who doesn't graduate college until say age 25, well very often the former is probably MORE mature and more of an ""adult"" (even at age 18 or 19) than the latter.  And it often continues even several years later, at age 30 that college graduate has maybe spent 5 years (max) ""on their own"" and just as likely has only spent a year or two; whereas by contrast the non-college kid is virtually an ""old man"" by comparison with well over a decade under his proverbial belt... nor is there necessarily a ""catching up"", since both SHOULD continue to grow/mature.  Now it doesn't always work out that way (in either scenario), but it frequently does.  Which kind of brings us back to the point: a lot of these young guys (TRP & Reddit) still feel like ""boys"" because factually... well they ARE still ""boys""; mostly what they do is fairly passive.  They've never taken on any ""lead"" roles in anything of substance; outside of maybe some ""arts & crafts"" thing at a summer camp, chances are they've never BUILT anything; nor have they ever been responsible for any group or event or project (at least that wasn't directly associated with some school ""assignment"").  And THAT is -- if I were forced -- how I would define a ""real man"": real men BUILD & MAINTAIN the things that run our society & civilization. No one is going to feel like a full-adult ""man"" if all they've really done is sit in a classroom doing (at most) ""make work"" projects; that's too much like child-play, it's ""pretend"" with no real-world stakes, no real-world risk attached, etc."

THE single (overwhelming) primary source of house fires is ""kitchen/cooking equipment related fires"", and the chief source/cause of those? Ovens left on; flammable things falling onto burners that have been left on; and EMPTY (or nearly empty) pots, pans and kettles sitting on burners that have been left on HIGH, often for an hour or more before they reach the stage of setting off a kitchen/house fire.    Oh, and the majority of those, are in ""single mom"" households* (second place is married/cohabiting)... ironically enough -- despite the media portraying men as inept, bumbling, incompetent accident prone morons, especially in regards to all things kitchens/cooking related -- very very few male-only households have fires (and no, it is not because such households are few in number, in actuality the number of male-led or male-only households has been increasing dramatically {one could almost say exponentially} during the past two decades, just as the number of female-led or female-only households have).    * Worse of course is that these tend to be the ""deadliest"", not only because they often have (multiple) small children, but invariably because they rarely have properly functioning smoke/fire alarms (those are male ""techy-toy"" things, the kinds of things that women don't ""do"") -- the worst are the ones where the smoke/fire alarm is present, and where it even has (or had) a functional battery, but said battery had been ""disconnected"" because the alarm had been too ""annoying"" (hint: it kept going off because the woman kept BURNING shit in the kitchen)."

If women wanted to be equals in all respects that cultural standard would have died ages ago (I am talking about in situations where a woman strikes the man first and he is expected not to hit back). Hell even now you can see times where women hit men but they brush it off because they are female and it isn't worth getting flack for hitting them back.

MGTOW,39zgxd,oldredder,2,Mon Jun 22 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a point, except that I thought some of us might be interested, given that there has been influx from TRP and PUA's into MGTOW, and they've brought with them such ideology as ""alpha"" and ""beta"" males. It will be useful for us (MGTOW) to be able to easily and quickly defeat such ideology when it comes up with recently ex-PUA's who are now MGTOW. This is a resource in such a discussion w/ new MGTOW.   I agree with you, the conclusion should ultimately center on how there are better things for men to do with their time than seduction of women, but Purple-pill men don't reach that conclusion overnight."

If you are a but ugly guy with two heads, I don't care how much game you have, you will not get anywhere. However, if you are a hot guy. A real 10 that makes a woman drool. And you can't talk to women, forget it, you will not score. However, if you are a 10 and you learn game, then you will score with women.  PUA's take the mystery out of dating. Take for example David Deangelo. He teaches cocky funny game. How many times have women said that they like a guy with a sense of humor. So a guy hears that and tries to hard being funny. Lands on his face. He has no game. He might be a 10, but does not know what he is doing. He learns the right way of telling jokes around women. Bang. He is scoring. The woman wants the 10 to approach her. But she will not go to bed with a guy who can't even make it to first base.   To sum up. All game does is help a guy who has the potential of being with women and just need a push in the right direction."

Truly women are creatures of illusion, a look at the business of being attractive and how they present themselves should confirm this.

Cannot blame them for extracting money out of fools who don't do that kind of research (especially with the power of the internet).   The saddest part to me is that some men are so clearly slaves to their biology that they do everything in their power to go out of there way to be something they are not simply to feel the sensation of having their dick in a mouth/vagina.

MGTOW,39zgxd,Rufus_Reddit,3,Fri Jun 19 07:30:20 2015 UTC,"This blog is very misguided as to the state of the current PUA community. The writer of this article is pretty uninformed and knows little about PUA today.  I'm also confused as to why anyone would feel the need to 'debunk' game. To justify that they have no power to change their dating/sex life as it currently exists? So they can avoid taking a long hard look at themselves and admit that there could be room for self improvement? Seems to me like the author of this article wants to debunk game so he can protect his own ego and justify the quality of his own game sans PUA. If you debunk PUA, then you might as well debunk every form of self-improvement on the market. And also just accept that self improvement as a whole is largely a myth. And accept that you cannot change as a person. PUA is an extension of self-help.  David DeAngelo hasn't been relevant in 10+ years. The man certainly laid a foundation for the PUA community, but PUAs like him, Mystery, Neil Strauss, Ross Jefferies, existed in a time when PUA was in infantile stages. These PUAs discovered the tactics that worked, but they did not understand the underlying principles behind them. They were all show and no substance.  PUA these days is not focused on 'creating attraction'. It is a mix of 'inner game' (self improvement/mindsets/attitude) and 'outer game' (social skills). Essentially both increasing one's SMV while learning how to navigate highly social environments. The focus is less on SIMULATING an attractive man, and more focused on actually BEING an attractive man.  PUA does not claim to be able to attract any woman. Even master PUAs don't get every girl. PUA simply exists to increase the amount of women in one's life. And it works. Alot of the advice taught by Real Social Dynamics, is practical and actionable. The PUA community is not selling a magic pill, nor does it claim to. The PUA community exists to help men through a long arduous journey of self-improvement.  I can attest to the PUA community, because it helped me go from a sexless nerd to having a vibrant sex life. It took hard work, many nights of going out in the city, chatting on forums, reading books, meeting other guys who were into the stuff, attending a few seminars. Constant trial and error. Years and years of learning. I look back on my life of where I started 6 or 7 years ago, and where I'm at now, and the difference is night and day. From a dorky gamer with crippling social anxiety to being able to go out on a friday night, chat up lots of different women and consistently get at least a few phone numbers. Wouldn't have been possible without the lessons I learned from the PUA community."

Surely, there's some woo in the PUA cabinet, but most of it is prima facie true:   More attempts lead to more successes. Presentation matters. Confidence matters. Women have sex drive. Effective social interaction is a skill that can be learned. People are controlled by their context in subtle and powerful ways.   I recall reading the PUA stuff a few years ago expecting some dark secrets, and while there's some deception involved, it's more about confidence, sensitivity, and honesty than anything else."

IOW, prior to learning/practicing so called ""game"" techniques, the guy (call him a ""player"" or a PUA or whatever) was probably a shy wall-flower type who seldom if ever approached women, and on the rare cases he attempted to, probably did so in a rather self-defeating, sweaty-palm awkward school-boy fashion.  After learning (whatever, essentially irrelevant) ""game"" techniques, he practices and then proceeds to view approaching women (even if/when he fails) as a ""learning"" exercise -- IOW, rather than being psychologically shattered (i.e. that there is something wrong with HIM) by them ""rejecting"" him, he views it as more likely that there is something wrong with his ""technique"", and like learning how to ""clutch"" while driving a manual shift vehicle, that it will take some practice (the more the better) to NOT ""grind the gears"".    So, instead of approaching ONE woman every 3 months (or possibly even less frequently, like 1 per year), he goes out and using his ""techniques"" attempts and approaches several DIFFERENT women each night on consecutive nights and weekends...    Is it any surprise then, that -- say 3 or 4 weeks in -- after having approached perhaps 50 or 100 or more women in at least a casual fashion (a number that at his previous rate would have taken DECADES)... quelle surprise he actually gets a positive (or at least non-horribly-negative) response from at least one, and possibly a couple of different women. (Who, if he obtains their phone numbers and/or interacts with them again, he will probably label as ""plates"" that he is ""spinning"" -- even if he hasn't achieved the purported ultimate goal of wetting his condom-clad dick in their vaginas.)  ERGO he is certain that the technique ""works"". (And presuming that he isn't pug-fucking-ugly, obese, or hunchbacked and ONLY approaching ""supermodel"" types -- then as even an average guy, he'd probably achieve similar success using just about ANY ""technique"" or ""ice breaker""; albeit possibly obtaining ""success"" with a slightly different {but similar fractional} subset of the women he approaches.)  You could probably obtain about the same level of ""success"" with something like using a horoscope (or whatever*) as your DAILY guide to life -- provided you did it in a disciplined manner and used it as a MOTIVATION to action; seeing any/all positive results or correlations as confirmations, and rejecting any negative correlations (i.e. things that don't ""match"" the horoscope) as somehow just misinterpreted.  If the dude was sufficiently gullible, you could probably sell him a ""magic rock"" to be used as some kind of a talisman on a necklace -- and so long as he was sufficiently convinced that it would ""work"" (i.e. eventually with the ""correct"" women, who can only be identified after the fact, creating a tautology) -- well, it probably would work just as well (the chief aspect being a change in attitude, aka a ""confidence builder"").

Keep in mind that the entire ""goal"" here is essentially gynocentric -- and not merely in the superficial form of centralizing women -- but in the deepest meaning of centralizing the gynecology organs: worse, it's NOT even about obtaining access or control over the reproductive aspects (i.e. to the end of having children), but rather more specifically it is about the most BANAL and PUERILE aspect: it's about a high-school (or middle school) locker room notion of ""success"" -- that is, achieving a high ""notch count"", aka just how many wet ""pussies"" (vaginas) have you (temporary) gained access to for a sufficiently long enough period of time so as to get your dick wet (well, actually since it's wrapped in latex, the dick itself won't be getting ""wet"", but getting the condom ""wet"" {inside AND out} apparently qualifies as success).

I don't mean to sound like I am entirely blaming him, his hands were fairly tied. He could have thrown some verbal support to the boy at the least when she is telling him that no one loves him and she wants to kill him, It also seemed he could have also been more proactive in keeping her away from the kid.    I will say he kept from going completely berserk far better than I would have in his shoes. You never know how you'll react in those situations until they happen; but I get the feeling that had it been me I'd have been going to jail for a long time, and she'd never be able to hurt anyone else. His way may have been smarter that what I'd have ended up doing, but that poor kid is probably going to be fucked up for a long time thanks to this bitch."

MGTOW,39u7d5,MiguelForte,6,Sun Jun 21 23:15:51 2015 UTC,"My friend, I don't like the word ""empower"" because it implies that your power comes from the outside. Your power is in you. If you chase power from the outside, you end up like a dog chasing its own tail. What you want is more important, but as soon as you realize and ""you"" and ""them"" are the same and essentially we want the same thing for all of us and we have been disguising it with individualistic needs. Money is only useful if you get it honestly and if it buys you things you need from people who made it honestly. We use money to buy things we don't need, to separate the ""you"" from ""them"". The more money we have, the better we are then the ""others"". But the others are us and we are the others. Happiness is a neurological trick, no different than a drug and the pursuit of it is a pointless endeavor. Harmony sounds to like a better goal to pursue to me. If you define yourself by success with women or validation by women in the form of marriage or sex, it is very limiting. That does not mean that family is not a great thing and that it must not be celebrated when it works. The whole idea of ""empowering"" one against the other reinforces the division of the whole into individuals, and it makes no one happy. It can be very confusing, but I had it to explained to me as a form of non-emphatic altruism, which makes sense, because when we want to ""empower"" someone we are essentially conceding that they are worse and need us to ""empower"" them, when, actually, we are no different."

MGTOW,39u7d5,notIsugarpie,3,Mon Jun 15 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"Here's what worked for me:  Don't associate your value with women.  You want to know what the top 10% of guys know?  You build your value, and women will take care of themselves.  The one fundamental truth I've learned about female nature is that if she wants to give you her phone number, or have sex with you, she will find a way to make it happen, and you're going to have to fight her off with a stick if you don't want it.    Also, your height is not a problem, I'm 5'9 and I've never had a problem with girls not liking me because of height.  Yes, they tend to like people over 6 feet, but plenty of guys pull down girls without being that tall.    If pulling down women is what you want (and who doesn't from time to time, so long as they don't lock us down) there are things you can do to help yourself.  The first piece of advice I would give you is don't set goals.  Goals are a waste of time.  What worked for me was experimentation and adaptation.  Figure out what works and what doesn't, be the mad scientist of your own life.    TV and junk food is going to kill you.  I got rid of my TV and I'm amazed at how little I miss it.  I try to limit my internet time too, and do stuff out in the real world.  As far as getting in shape, a few rules of thumb I've figured out is:  -don't do cardio in the gym, its a waste of time.  You need to do some cardio for your own heart health, but walking, like outside, is the best cardio you can do.  I moved to a place that was 2.5 miles from where I work, and walking to and from work each day is all the cardio I need.  This way, when I hit the gym, I can focus on strength training, knowing I killed two birds with one stone already: I got myself to work, and I finished my cardio.  It also adds urgency: if I don't feel like exercising for an hour each day, I can't get to and from work, so when I get up in the morning, I don't get a choice.  When it comes to exercise, the less choice you can give yourself to do it, the better off you'll be.    -once you start exercising, a lot of other problems in life disappear with it.  Get an understanding of nutrition, it can save your life and its not difficult.  Read the label on everything you buy in the supermarket, and trust me, reading a label and knowing what's in something is generally more than enough to prevent me from buying it.  Learn to value what you put into your mouth.  Not all ""healthy"" food is actually healthy, the packaging lies, the nutritional information on the back is what you should go by.  -don't buy into the Doctor Oz BS.  There is no such thing as a magical weight loss diet.  Those fads are there to con stupid people out of their money.  Read the labels on everything you eat, and you should know what is ""healthy"" and want isn't.  Chloestorol is bad, so is saturated fat, so is nonsoluble fiber (a little is okay, because it can help control hunger, but go for soluable, if you can).  It isn't rocket science, and your intuitive notion of what is good and bad is normally right.  Don't worry about specifics, pick a direction, follow it for awhile, and tinker.    -Train yourself to change your tastes and preferences.  Avocados are  really good for you, but I always hated the way they tasted, so I kept on eating them, and after a short time, the taste grew on me.  Don't just eat and keep eating, set attainable short range benchmarks, like I will try it with lunch today and then, keep trying it once every few days and increase.  You do need some fat, for energy to burn, but you'd be surprised how little you need.  I find a steak on Saturday and a scoop of ice cream twice a week is all the fat I need.  Moderation is the key.    -Fruits and Vegetables are the best things to eat, in general.  Every day, when I go to lunch, I get cucumbers with my lunch, and I bring them back to work, and I split my cucumbers with my co-worker, who trades it for an apple or a banana (the swap is how we keep each other honest).  I then eat half my cucumbers, the apple or banana my co-worker gave me, my avocado, the pineapple I get on my sandwich, and the prunes and mixed nuts (always buy unsalted) that I keep on my desk.  If you're a costco member, the unsalted mixed nuts they sell are excellent.    None of these things is difficult, and they all help you reduce your belt size, and when you do that, you'll start liking the way you look in the mirror, and when you start liking how you look, its easier to flirt with women because your confidence will come through in your speech.  ""Just be yourself"" is BS, so is ""you're a nice guy, you'll find someone"".  Don't ever ask women what to do to attract women.  You would never ask a fish how to catch fish, would you?  No, you ask a fisherman.    The truth is out there, and the reason many people never learn it is for the simple reason that it all looks so big.  Change seems like scaling this giant mountain, and that you never get to the top, so you never try.  Don't think about the mountain, block it out.  Think about what is the one thing I can do better today than I did yesterday?  One month, the only thing I changed about myself was that I started brushing my teeth more than once a day, no matter what.  Little changes, here and there, in small, manageable chunks will add up."

Looks are shallow and the domain of women, in my opinion... well... I mean, I enjoy sculpting my body, but not for the sake of looks, that's a different standard, one of self-discipline, not vanity.

I am amazed that an average joe looking guy like this is considered ugly by most of society.  For you literally start with the weight before you tackle anything else. And im not talking about body building just basic calisthenics and a change in diet to drop the bodyfat.  Go through your pantry and read the small print at the bottom of the back of each box titled ""ingredients"" and look for the word ""high-fructose corn-syrup"" if you see that word then you throw that box into the garbage and never buy that shit again, EVER!!! If you drink soda like coke and pepsi switch to juice or a sportsdrink instead. Also look at the nutrition graph on foods and drink and see hoy much sugar is loaded into them thats another thing that puts on fat and should be avoided. You dont even have to eat less food just modify the kind of food you eat.  80% of the fat people have is from that fucking corn-syrup shit your body literally cannot process it so it goes straight into fat just by cutting that stuff out of your diet you will start loosing pounds.  second thing is Cardio you need to run and jog. Not alot of it just like 15-20 minutes each day enough to start a heavy sweat that will start burning calories and force your body to eat into the fat deposits and if you cant jog nonstop for 15 moniutes then do a 60-90 second run then walk for 60-90 seconds then do another runs and do that for 20-25 minutes.  also change your eating habits from 2-3 big meals to 4-5 smaller meals evenly spaced out from morning to evening since this will force your bodies metabolism into high gear and cause it to burn more calories.  it wont suddenly make you attractive but it will eliminate the single largest, most visible problem you have thats fucking with your self esteem and thats your weight.  after that if you wanna lift weights and build muscle then go ahead and hit the fitness reddit to start a routine.  once you have dropped most of your fat you should re-evaluate your situation in regards to women/people in general.  It may be possible that you arent really mgtow and just want to be TRP instead and if thats the case then go ahead down that path and smooth sailing."

MGTOW,39u7d5,HunterJJ,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"Pick a sport you enjoy and have a bit of skill in, and then figure out an area where you can improve. Lifting weights could be your sport, if you like lifting weights. For me, it's badminton. I need to work on footwork, game sense/court awareness (where to hit the shuttle), wrist strength, quad strength, accuracy, my serve, consistency of shots, and probably more.   For my last semester of college, I played 3 times per week. That was good. Now I'm playing 5 times per week, and it's even better.   So I think you should pick a sport that can give you greater physical fitness in some way, and then you should use your enjoyment of the sport to force yourself to get better at it and improve your physical fitness. Do it for your love of the sport. When you're 6 months into it, you'll feel a lot better, look a little different, and have the confidence from your improved play to recognize that women don't f%cking matter when you're doing your thing. Once you see this, ""your thing"" can be expanded (in terms of your understanding of it) to encompass most, if not all, of your life and activities.

It's a feminist MO to expand the meaning of words while maintaining the original severity, e.g, rape used to mean physically forcing your dick into a woman who doesn't want it -- now it means when a woman has consensual sex and later regrets it.  Likewise misogyny used to mean pathological hatred of women -- now it means disagreement with a feminist."

The redpill may be a bit misogynistic but their descriptions of women's behavior is not totally false.  Social media and online dating has given the modern woman too much validation and an inflated ego.  I don't want to compete with the entire world for a woman with little to offer but her vagina.

Their money betrayed them. Yours will too.  The root of the red pill, anti-Matrix, is economic and how women act is merely a side-chain consequence of social engineering which itself is a mere facet of global economic engineering using fraud, crime and war.  The paper / electrons you think are money could in a moment be worthless as pocket-lint. It's called hyper-inflation / currency-collapse. It's real and it happens.  I have many kinds of money to ensure if one fails I have more than zero. I have gold, I have silver, I have goods that don't perish, I have tools and I have dollars and credit. Each serves a purpose and if one fails the other will pick up the slack."

A minor inner topic of side-effects of finance covers the entire social-engineering that is discussed in TRP subreddit, hence the TRP version of the red pill being only a microcosm of the full red pill and zerohedge actually is the full on red pill.  War. Social engineering. Marriage rates / birth rates. What money is. Politics. Trading electrons/paper. Shipping hard goods. Each is a facet of the over-all red pill which is primarily economic.  TRP can't be a genuine red pill by focusing only on the fraction that is sexual relationships and a minor toss-in for fitness/lifting."

And when the prices are rigged as they are now and always become, by the people with capital, what you have is lunacy and a matrix.    And a side effect of this is that the ones with capital get all the most attractive women lining up to spend a night in their mansion.    The entire idea of capitalism is opposed to anarchy, in anarchy there are no bosses, only teams and team members(or syndicates or collectives or whatever you want to call them) and the rules of those teams are all defined by their actual members, and coercion is not used.    Capitalism is the opposite of those things, nearly everyone has a boss, nearly everyone is coerced.  Ironically those at the very top are organized anarchically, by verbal agreements that keep anyone from bossing anyone around.  At the very top, when someone is bossing someone around, or when someone goes back on an agreement, well thats how Saddaam Hussein and Muamar Khadafi died, and Manuel Noriega got arrested, and also why Ukraine and Syria are being invaded.    The use of capital is ok for the projects of teams, but accumulated wealth makes for a system just like we have, which is horrifically unjust."

Making it seem like a bag of tricks to get laid is crass and childish, and works against any larger movement against the masquerading idiocy which comprises the surface level functioning of our failed society.

Where others will have other currencies and PM accounts and other things; I have nothing. I'm not presumptuous enough to think that not only will I survive the collapse, but that I am worth the resources that it will take to do so. I know it's all worthless; so I'm just kicking it until the end. When it comes and they come for everyone to herd them away; I'll get myself killed as quickly as possible. After that it's a fate of fecundity in a black, hermetically-sealed box for four. Maybe then I can get some real quiet.  TL:DR /u/oldredder is right about everything but one thing. He assumes that intrinsic value is actually a thing and not just an illusion created by those who want to keep you playing. Everything is terrible and worthless.

MGTOW,39rg4x,mindhawk,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:05:18 2015 UTC,"It was a bit of coming full circle after my last bullet dodge in Oct. of 2014. I had this attitude as a child; and what caused that was a huge mash up of things that led to a very serious contemplation of suicide by me. And a round of shaming via 'Then I'll kill myself too so we can die together' from Mother Dearest.  To start with: I've probably had Hatter's Disease for most of my life--but there's no way I can really prove that. The symptoms add up and from the kinds of paints I was exposed to as a child; the possibility is there. (My Old Man worked as a contractor painting the Federal Mogul Plant in Piedmont. When the class action over all the HM poisonings started happening, he refused to file saying 'They won't get my signature on nothin'!') Coupled with both the abuse from Him and Mother's terrible codependency on me; I'm pretty much wrecked from the start.  On Old Man: I know that MGTOW is definitely of an opinion when it comes to divorce court and things; but my old man was no innocent victim. There was no trying to keep him away from us; Mother dutifully sent us every other weekend and four weeks in the summer to him even when he let me catch Scarlet Fever one summer since he didn't believe that I was actually sick. She never demonized him; but when he threw my books away (David Eddings, The Belgariad) and told me they were demonic, it kind of sealed the deal. I knew at age seven that he was a terrible sack of shit; yet she remarried him in my teen years when other guys fucked off to those who would put out regularly. (Fucked up thing about the single mom thing. If you act like a woman should in a relationship; you neglect your kids. You neglect your man and take care of your kids; he leaves you, somewhat rightfully. It's like I've always said: everyone's in a double bind and nothing good can come from this place.)  These events led me to hate masculinity in all forms from a young age and I didn't really come out of it until I got out of high-school. (I also developed a hatred for Christianity that will never abate.) I never saw women's privilege because I'd been caught up in female victimhood with no recourse. So I took refuge in the far left; but they eventually started turning on each other and I knew that I would be next. The Right will never accept me; since I cannot slip into their worldview and participate. The Left hates me because I'm a white male. With nowhere to really turn; I uncovered that little nugget of truth that I'd found as a child and really thought about it again.  Everything is terrible, nothing will ever be good and everyone will always hate you.  Now I'm back to it. It's the only thing I really have close to a religious conviction; and I know it's the madness-induced conformation bias, but everything seems to point to me being right. Everything does suck eventually; and since nothing exists in a vacuum, there's no way to avoid it. Thus the Antagonistic Nihilism."

But you need to be capable of sustained indifference to them, to put all those longings aside for extended periods of time.  And certainly to avoid being tricked/trapped into costly endeavors with them.    ""The pleasure, fleeting, the risks, overwhelming, the expense, damnable"" Lord Chesterfield (I think)  I also don't like the aspects that seem to be hating or bullying women, I've never been one much for abusive language, it makes someone sound puffed up.  For instance, as much fun as it is to call obsese women 'cows' of one sort or another, it gives away a lot of our power and makes us look like sore losers, or that we are saying sour grapes.    MGTOW works best when you have control over your emotions and aren't moved by the urge to impress others or act tough, so saying mean things on the internet to make ourselves feel better is something to watch out for.    What I'm looking for in a woman, if one is in front of me and not being mean for no reason, is someone who has put as much into her self-development as I have, and I can't even find a woman who has put as much into her reddit account's development, much less entire life.  I've written 7 feature screenplays, several collections of essays and short stories, I've traveled the world, have a degree, an skilled in several fields, and can rock the drumset or guitar, and have written several albums, this year I have read Blood Meridian and Cat's Cradle and I'm working on Steppenwolf (*which all MGTOW should read imo).   I haven't met very very very few women in the last 10 years who can hold a candle to that, or is really even that interesting to me.  More often I feel the urge to not hurt someone's feelings by leading them on when I know they could never satisfy me.   Most of the time it's clear they are looking for someone to make their life easier and play the role of cardboard cutout dispensing cash and trinkets.    Most most of the time, the woman I am attracted to is in a relationship with a cardboard cash and trinket dispensing cutout and I lose all respect for her when I notice this.  Or they are on some alpha rich dudes game plate spinning rotation and compare you to him even though, there is no way they are more than a game to him.  And I lose respect.    But once I stopped seeing my single-ness as a failure and more of an opportunity, things in my life got a lot more fun.  My giving myself the freedom to 'die alone'(whatever that means), I have the True Freedom.  I don't need to make fun of women to do that, when just describing the accurately is more effective and preserves my dignity.    I have just never liked name-calling, I'll admit."

MGTOW,39rg4x,scubar,3,Sun Jun 14 11:30:15 2015 UTC,It was so shocking.   She did it so remorselessly.    I suspected she was cheating g but even when caught she denied it.

MGTOW,39rg4x,Asari_Lover,7,Sun Jun 14 03:30:13 2015 UTC,"Human beings generally are asshole retards.  You just normally would want women more and generally would make bigger risks for women to be in your life.  It's up to you. If you want to go your own way you need to make a few plans and follow the one(s) that work. Once others are not likely or able to fuck with your life that's it - you've gone your own way. There's no magic to it, just discipline and planning."
