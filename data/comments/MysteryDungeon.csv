MysteryDungeon,3dtt3g,creyk,3,Sun Jul 19 11:50:53 2015 UTC,"I was curious about this a couple of days ago and looked up all the days the demo released. Judging by GTI alone, the demo should be released 2-3 weeks before the actual game, and I predict the game will come out sometime in Nov, so I'm guessing (for NA at least) it will be released Nov. 7-14.  Japan might get it from late August to early September. As for Europe, maybe early March? One thing I know for sure is that the demo couldn't possibly be given a worldwide release. Wouldn't it be a little unfair to taunt the Europeans for half a year while people in Japan are only one month away from release?"

MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,Llarys,5,Fri Jul 17 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"Well to counter your problem with death being an easy work around in this game, I wouldn't mind seeing forced quick saving again. It was done in most of the challenge dungeons in Rescue Team and made going in to said dungeons more worrying, as one screw up could ruin you. It would help fight restart abuse on death."
MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,Theartisticpixel,6,Fri Jul 17 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"Thinking about this seriously, I ended up considering a lot with the following ""roguelike"" traits:  Permadeath: The last few dungeons in PMD games do offer the real roguelike experience of perma-death.  Purity Forest, Zero Isle South, and the Path of No Return all reset the player out of everything they grinded, and didn't let the players take anything in.  The dungeons were pretty much the game in their own right.  Everything leading up to it, of course, being used as a means of easing the player up to that level.  And I think this arrangement they have is probably for the best.  Cursed Items: PMD's always had the watered-down version of these with Lookalike items and Sticky items, and those devolved into testing whether you could spell or not, and an inconvenience, respectively.  Other roguelikes showed a few ways of benefitting from cursed items by either somehow turning their effects on foes, or by nullifying/reversing effects of normally bad items, which I think is neat.  There's plenty of times where this is already done in the main series.  From Toxic Orb Facade sweeping, to Choice item lockdowns, to moving-last-to-throw-Iron balls-and-trigger-Unburden, even the worst of items have had some use to turn them on their heads.  Roguelikes thrive on testing the player to think of that clever sequence of actions to get out of their uniquely bad situation.  I think there's a lot of untapped potential in utilizing items that have a negative effect; PMD just needs to have more bad items to think around.  Item ID: It's interesting to talk about this feature, since most roguelites of the present day have skipped over this feature entirely.  I think this concept is a really tricky one, due to the optimal play often consisting of opening up a table of items items online and constantly crossing them out from the list.  I think the true potential in this system intertwines with the feature mentioned above, and to what ends the ""bad"" items are meant to serve when mixed with the positive ones.  Spell System: Here's where I think it gets interesting for PMD.  Pokemon in general has always been an odd one when it came to magic systems, with how each slot had their own round of ammunition.  As roguelikes owe a lot of gameplay to resource management, the PP system does a nice job of both limiting resources while ensuring that there's a balance in move usage.  PSMD seems to be getting actual wands, like the ones from Shiren, but that actually seems redundant, given how the PP system works (but, like ammo, these items are probably good for covering teams that don't have a particular kind of move).  Class System: 386-720 creatures covering every spectrum/subspectrum of ""class"" outdoes a lot of existing roguelikes out there in terms of choice.  I would've liked to see some better balancing and diversity from where they are now, but I do understand that with so many possibilities, the designers can only go so far with that.  Gear System: Yet another place where Pokemon as an RPG differs so much from what you typically see out there.  Pokemon held items have always been incomparables- one thing always did something different from another, and there was never a ""better item"" that outclassed another one in every situation.  And this is probably for the better, since they create a greater number of viable possibilities, and don't wind up being just another vector of progression.  Containers: Nethack had Bags.  Shiren had pots.  PSMD seems to be catching on with the original MD when they added Wands, leaving this item type the only one missing.  They served mainly as extra inventory space since the other roguelikes allowed less than 16 items as opposed to PMD's like... 48.  Aside from that, they tended to do weird things to items, like change them or fuse them.  I found these to be a neat feature, but don't really think of them as opening up a whole range of possibilities.  It'd be a needless complication at worst, and an ""eh"" feature at best.  Gods/Prayer/Sacrifice: We'll assume that if this feature comes to PMD, the entity in question is kept vague like the voice of Luminous spring, since... you know, you can (normally) recruit the Gods.  I'm also going to leave out reputation systems that usually come attached to this idea...  This was always a feature that worked well in roguelikes due to the YOLO nature of the game, where sacrificing things and rolling the die on the ""pray"" command all had impactful consequences.  The lamest implementations of this system basically turns this into a ""chance to cast a spell"" command, but more interesting results could also happen, like item/progression gifts, or meta-effects.  Imagine if you could spin the V-Wheel in mid-dungeon.  Oh, and also make it affect a bunch of other factors like item spawning or room generation, like the Mysteriousity Distortions.  Yeah.  Mutations: Sometimes in certain games (Brogue, Cataclysm), you'd get an enemy with a modified trait of some sort, or be able to modify your own character in a similar way.  With how Pokemon are set up, I could easily imagine certain random encounters having a little extra added to their arsenal to make them a bit spicier.  A rogue egg move, or a hidden ability.  ORAS had DexNav captures work essentially in this way, so it's not a far stretch of imagination to think of how this could be implemented.  There's a lot of features between Pokemon, PMD, and Roguelikes that catch my fancy, but these tend to be very precise ideas.  At that point I might as well just make my own game..."
MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,Aw_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"I really like this review. You seem to be very familiar with Roguelikes.   I agree with a lot here, I'd especially like to see more diversity among Pokemon, since a lot of them are basically the same, and it usually came down to moves/type. Gates was a little better on this. There's a Speed stat now, so they might be able to do that better, but it might just be for Speed-based moves like Gyro Ball.  The V-wheel in mid-dungeon sounds really interesting. I could imagine it being like the Kecleon shop in the middle of a dungeon, only a V-wheel where you can pay to have something good or bad happen, like you described. The random distortions in Gates was cool too, hope that stays.   I'd also like mutations implemented, for a random challenge, or at least so you could recruit Pokemon with their hidden abilities/egg moves.. but I guess that would mean you can't have hidden abilities/egg moves on your starter/partner. Bummer.  Cursed items, I don't know. It's not that I don't like them, because lookalike items(Dough Seed, Dropeye Seed, etc.) were actually useful, but the ""every item has a risk"" just sounded kind of annoying, especially for the younger players, I guess. I'd like to see them come back in some way, but I guess it's just a how for me. How would you do it?"
MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,Absolitely,4,Sat Jul 18 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"I'll go ahead and start:  I would like to see cursed items in the game.  Explorers of Sky did a ""kid-friendly"" version of cursed items with the look-alike items, items that appeared similar to good/rare items, but were actually really bad items (with an occasional bad item masquerading as a good item).  I want genuine cursed items, however.  Now, what do cursed items bring to the table?  Cursed items, due to the fact you never knew whether or not they were...well...cursed, made every item you found a risk, in the dungeon you found that item.  It up-played the importance of the limited supply of items you had, and knew where not cursed (in traditional Rogue games), or the supplies you specifically brought with you into the dungeon (Mystery Dungeon games).  Many people mock hunger, for example, as you can bring 3 apples to a 99 floor dungeon, then ""live off the land"" for the rest of the dungeon, eating whatever you find along the way.  But with a curse system, every item you find could potentially ruin you.  That cursed apple you just ate off the ground?  Your belly size has been halved until you escape.  That cursed max elixer?  You just LOST all your PP.  That cursed Pecha Scarf?  Now you're poisoned every floor you enter.  A cursed Strength Band?  It's stuck to your head, and it lowers your strength.    It strengthens the importance of the item management game that defines the Mystery Dungeon series, while punishing those of us who like to abuse our ability to ""live off the land.""  Of course, many cool things would get to be added as a result of curse items:  1) Orb of remove curse:  Simple, effective.  Removes curses on all items in your inventory.  You can either collect a bunch of items, then use the orb in a pinch to make sure they're safe, OR you can collect a bunch of known cursed items (look down at number 3) and then purify them all in a short dungeon get them as good items.  2) Cleansing Pools: A dungeon ""location"" that you can randomly find, like ke(k)leon's shop, which you can drink/bathe from/in to remove any curses on you.  Thankfully, it'll also let you remove cursed equipment.  3) Ninetails' Curse Shop: Ninetails uses his/her all seeing eye to identify any cursed items in your inventory...for a fee of course.  Now all of those items you nabbed in the dungeon are safe to use.  4) Hariyama's Knock-Off Shop: Any cursed equipment won't come off as easily if you foolishly put it on.  Thankfully, we have the tough Hariyama who will (painfully) remove it with Knock-Off for free (rather, just to have a new punching bag to train on)!"
MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,l_u_c_a_r_i_o,3,Fri Jul 17 14:43:39 2015 UTC,"I think sticky items are the closest relatives to cursed items, and might be as close as Spike Chunsoft would like to get."
MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,Absolitely,2,Fri Jul 17 15:01:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. While what you described looked interesting, it sounds rather difficult for the younger audiences who also play these games."
MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,Absolitely,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"Those are definitely fair points.  It just feels that sticky items (the ones you find on the ground) are just items that are useless until a later point, while the sticky traps are more similar to the move Embargo as it was envisioned in the core series (locks your held item and prevents you from using any others).  I guess part of my problem is that I was raised on the DOS, and I grew up with games like Rogue, itself, and I want more of these challenges.  When people talk about how much they struggled with ___ part or ___ area, I always just recall how I breezed through everything, because the true difficulty of the games - the management - isn't really there for me (until you get to those 99 floor, no item dungeons of course).  I dunno.  Haha."
MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,l_u_c_a_r_i_o,3,Fri Jul 17 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. As much as I'd like Pokemon games themselves to be more difficult, one thing you always have to take into consideration is that these games were intended for children. And it's hard for me to have an issue with that. I remember 8 year-old me playing Red Rescue Team and having so much fun with that game, and I don't know if at the time I could put up with the challenge of other Rogue games. On top of that, there might be an 8 year-old having a blast with Gates right now. I'd hate to take that away.  But I have to admit, I hope they dial up the difficulty to the first 2 games. Gates was just too easy."

MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,maximtomato,2,Sat Jul 18 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"Would love something like in Lufia III (The Legend Returns) for GBC where some bosses are absurdly powerful but if you work hard enough defeating them will get you powerful items early. Think Grovyle's battle in PMD2 but more difficult with a better reward for defeating him early (Like maybe a Golden Seed)  Speaking of roguelikes like Lufia III, maybe superbosses would be a nice addition to PMD. Bosses with incredibly high stats that are insanely difficult to defeat even at max level, that would be a fun challenge to add for harder dungeons, dungeons similar to Strongest Trail from GTI where you keep your level but face tough enemies."
MysteryDungeon,3dmnr9,creyk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"I think the worst thing that PMD has is the embargo trap, where EVERY SINGLE ENEMY has embargo, which kills one of your moves' PP, even though you use a regular attack."

MysteryDungeon,3d6lu9,MNChino,4,Mon Jul 13 22:47:35 2015 UTC,I'm super confused :x.
MysteryDungeon,3d6lu9,OMGitsDSypl,3,Mon Jul 13 23:27:14 2015 UTC,same. guess they're just trying to say gold's a big motif in psmd? i dunno
MysteryDungeon,3d6lu9,robindebank,2,Mon Jul 13 23:36:52 2015 UTC,Oh my. They have been hinting at this all along...

MysteryDungeon,3d6lu9,KingsBlade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:28:02 2015 UTC,What exactly is XY8? Is it some abbreviation or something that I'm not in on?
MysteryDungeon,3d6lu9,Mudkiprocketship3003,2,Mon Jul 13 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"XY8 is the next pokemon trading card game set in Japan.  It is not yet named.  However, it features a new mechanic, called ""Break Evolution"" that involves pokemon turning gold."

MysteryDungeon,3d4to8,robindebank,2,Mon Jul 13 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"I had a Krookodile in Gates that had Moxie. Basically, once in a while your Attack will be boosted upon defeating an enemy.  As far as I know, there's no ability list for Gates. However, there is an ability testing FAQ for Explorers. That page specifically has all the abilities listed, I think. Feel free to go through it.  If you want to make an ability/move list for Gates, I wouldn't really recommend it since:   PSMD is coming out soon, and will be receiving more attention and needing more guides than Gates. Gates doesn't even have every move in it up to Gen V, and that might be the same for abilities.   I'm not up for Gates, however, I'd actually be interested in helping people create guides for Super. If you're interested in that, I'd be glad to help if I could. If not, then I hope I answered your question."
MysteryDungeon,3d4to8,Absolitely,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:35:53 2015 UTC,"Testing out things in PSMD and collaborating on a guide sounds fun! Maybe we could start work on it when PSMD is released. Also, thanks for the tip on Moxie."
MysteryDungeon,3d4to8,creyk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:52:44 2015 UTC,What abilities do you want to test? I'm thinking most of them are well-known and there are only a few mysterious ones
MysteryDungeon,3d4to8,Aw_,2,Mon Jul 13 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"Klutz seems like an odd one and seems easy to test, since Buneary has it. Suction Cups also has no information on it for PMD that I can find.   ..Turns out the only non-Hidden Ability I really would like to see tested is Moxie. Bleh. Are there any Abilities I didn't list that you're curious about?"
MysteryDungeon,3d4to8,creyk,3,Mon Jul 13 20:01:18 2015 UTC,I can answer suction cups: Throw a warp seed or use Roar at an octillery and watch what (doesn't) happen.

MysteryDungeon,3d2od3,Absolitely,5,Mon Jul 13 04:50:05 2015 UTC,I worry about the future of Nintendo now. Probably what makes me sad the most is the last thing he heard from his fans was about how bad E3 was..

MysteryDungeon,3d240n,robindebank,11,Sun Jul 12 22:20:43 2015 UTC,"I actually think that most of the gates soundtrack is very underrated. In particular, the first dungeon, Ragged mountain is a very uplifting song to begin the game with. Other dungeons like Holehills and Great Glacier are also really adventurous.   There are also a lot of cool variations on themes, particularly with Telluric Path and its five diffrent remixes.  The three final Glacier palace spire tracks are great, both bittercold tracks are great, the extra remix tracks are great, basically I love the gates soundtrack screw ya'll"
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,0bsidianlink,3,Mon Jul 13 01:37:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, I never played it, but I've listened to the soundtrack. Gates has a lot of the motifs from the PMD series. The instruments sound refined, and there are more orchestral themes. I can't remember the exact name, but I think one of the great glacier plain theme was really good to me."
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,maximtomato,2,Mon Jul 13 03:31:04 2015 UTC,"I feel bad that a lot of people didn't play GTI and missed out on the music.  It's a natural advancement of the celtic-flavored, leitmotif-laden PMD soundtrack with overall better instruments.  I especially love how they had the two themes of Hope and Despair play throughout, weaving them into the bits and pieces of the soundtrack, the culmination being a mix of them both into the final dungeon theme to show how at the two are at a final clash.  Aside from that, I also feel that the EoS special episode tracks really don't get enjoyed as much as they need to be due to how they're typically just played once and never revisited.  That third version was nearly a 1.5x multiplier on the music quantity in that game, which is pretty amazing for a ""third version remake""."
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,Aw_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:16:08 2015 UTC,"While the final battle was all about ""THE REAL SUPER POWER OF TEAM WORK!"" it was still amazing, and stands up to Primal Dialga, and knocks Rayquaza out of the water."
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,jddaepicboss,5,Wed Jul 15 14:07:15 2015 UTC,"Palkia's Onslaught is great, but is forgotten due to Dialga's Fight to The Finish! Not dissing Dialga, it's AMAZING, but I wish people remembered Palkia's Theme"
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,jddaepicboss,4,Sun Jul 12 23:51:09 2015 UTC,"Every single time I try to remember how Palkia's Onslaught sounds, it blurs into Dusknoir's battle theme for me. Does that happen for anyone else?"
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,jddaepicboss,4,Sun Jul 12 23:59:23 2015 UTC,"Nope. Not after my first play through. No FUCKING warning for that battle. I was so unprepared, even with the Kanghaskhan Rock. 8 TIMES I PLAYED THAT BATTLE, I AIN'T FORGETTING THE THEME ANY TIME SOON!"
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,-SpaceCommunist-,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:04:18 2015 UTC,"Meh. For me, Palkia's Obslaught just sounds like a big spooky monster is chasing you through a hallway. Dialga's Fight To The Finish, however, was full of hope and tension and finality; it was a fight to save the world from permanent darkness, whereas the former is just a boss battle."
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,jddaepicboss,2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know it's nothing compared to Dialga, but it is still good."
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,maximtomato,4,Wed Jul 15 23:40:27 2015 UTC,"Dusk Forest, Sky Peak Snowfield, and Hidden Land are really good imo. I don't agree with TGH's remaster of Sky Peak and Hidden Land. I really liked the near harmonic nature that the flute instrument had in the original song for Sky Peak, and the string synth was way too weak in Hidden Land."
MysteryDungeon,3d240n,thekoreansun,3,Sun Jul 12 22:48:17 2015 UTC,Sky Peak and Hidden Land for those who want to hear the remastered versions.
