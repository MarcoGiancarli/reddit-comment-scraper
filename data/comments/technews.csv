technews,3e33gt,dethb0y,3,Tue Jul 21 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"Two of my best friends took their own life and I've attempted it... Yes tomorrow, or next week, usually is a better day but then the darkness comes again. It always comes again. The trick (for me at least) is to see it like the flu, I have to focus and take care of my brain when the dark flu hits me. For a lot of people it's like being sick every week, for years and years... You would rather just end that pain. Tomorrow might be better, but the pain almost always comes back. It's tiring."

Depression was the No. 1 reported condition among them and was present in 30% of all entrepreneurs, followed by ADHD (29%) and anxiety problems (27%).  That's a much higher percentage than the US population at large, where about 7% identify as depressed.    Mental health is an important part of tech news, not in something hidden and a stigma, but something that can discussed more openly."

It's saying that Reddit's given special compensation to the bigots by grating ""special"" service (password access) without the benefit of selling add revenue. So it actually costs them money by allowing the bigots free range. TL:DR Reddit keeps the bigots at an operational cost."

technews,3dxxen,tm204,5,Mon Jul 20 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"I find this unsurprising in the least.  I hate using the phone for a few reasons.  1) Sound quality is terrible (EX: don, john, and sean all sound the same, and on a menu with similar sounding things this is hell)  2) You often can't hear what they're saying or they're blowing up your ear.  They sound like they're across the room and you run into asking what they said again, sometimes/often multiple times.  3) You have to put them on hold because the register is busy from someone else taking a call which makes it all take longer. Online has no line, just an ETA.  4) Related to 3, you (as the customer) may have to call multiple times to get through since the lines are busy.  5) (personal reason) I hate using the phone at all.  I'd rather use the online functions (email, text, forms/menus, etc).  I'm much better with words on screen/paper than with my mouth.  I can get my point across significantly easier with text than word, even if it technically takes longer.  I often confuse the other person with words and have no time to think."
technews,3dxxen,Inkertus_0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:37:12 2015 UTC,My new favourite is 6) The guy on the phone is 6 inches from another person taking an order on a different phone. They both sound the same and their voices are the exact same volume.  The phone sucks.
technews,3dxxen,Rikkochet,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"That reminds me of the other reason (and no kidding though I haven't ran into that one unless a distractingly loud co worker counts).    Person on phone is giving order instead of person who actually knows what they want, so you end up hearing the order once faintly, then loudly again.  They just added a person to make it more annoying, and echo-y.  Kind of wish they'd just put person two on or know what they wanted in the first place before calling.  So many examples I just avoid the phone like the plague whenever possible and let my co workers handle it.  Then there's ""specials guy"".  Has to know every special you have running at the time (over 5 for us which takes way too long that I'm sure the customer forgets by the time I've finished) and asks you to list them.  I just ask them what they're looking for generally (feeding two with a kid?, so and so special is for you) and pray.  Can't wait to get out of food service and into a job without direct customer interaction."
technews,3dxxen,Inkertus_0,3,Tue Jul 21 00:55:55 2015 UTC,"The app/Internet can save your order history and know your favorite meal. No brainer that this is better. I usually find it to be much faster on both ends of the transaction as well.   I worked at Jimmy Johns for a year and it would be annoying that people customized the shit out of their meal, but all in all it saved  the 4 min phone call , and I could spend that time preparing the food."
