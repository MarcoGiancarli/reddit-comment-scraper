manchester,3dxo9u,donkoink,6,Mon Jul 20 11:40:52 2015 UTC,"Typically I've started looking for a flat around 1 month before I need to move, and it's been fine.  When I started looking at the start of January to move in before March, most places were likely to have been signed before I was ready to move in (ie, for contracts starting at Feb 1st).  However, the sooner you start looking (and put down a deposit) the more likely you are to get a good flat at a decent price. Plenty of great flats turn up with 1 month until availability, but at the same time plenty of them have 3 or more months lead and get snapped up.  The least amount of time I've had is 1 week (due to the prior place getting taken by someone else in day between viewing and being ready to put the deposit down) and that was pretty stressful but doable.  So yeah, maybe start looking around Feb/March for the good ones showing up early, but realistically you can wait until May/June without issue."

manchester,3dqy73,craigdevlin,7,Sat Jul 18 21:18:56 2015 UTC,"I live there in the building that overlooks the Asda car park!   Why are you concerned about your choice? I moved here in September and I've found it to be a good place to live.   Food: The Asda is fine for all essentials, along with the Argos and assortment of home bargain style places, and the fish and chip shop is deeeelicious.  Safety: I feel safe here as a 23yo female and will happily go to the shops by myself. By all means stay cautious and stick to public transport and well lit areas at night, but you should do that everywhere.   Transport links: The 85 stops on Greenheys Lane West outside the Life Building flats that's on the corner of Hulme High Street and continues into Chorlton, which has lots of nice pubs and places to mooch about. The opposite direction takes you directly into the city centre (Piccadilly Gardens is the final stop), but also stops near Oxford Road station for train links.   Universities: I'm at the University of Manchester and walk into uni every day. It takes about 15-20 minutes and here is the route I walk in red. The blue shows the 85 bus route if you are a student and want to get the bus to uni. Alternatively, Manchester Metropolitan is about the same distance away and also on Oxford Road. I also follow the red route and continue into the city centre (~30 minutes) if I want to walk rather than bus.  I found it very daunting to move to a strange place too.

Generally it's only as bad as an overly chatty slightly drunk bloke with a thick Caribbean accent. It's a big and very busy Asda which would have put me off living there simply due to how busy it is, but you would have almost certainly noticed that during the flat viewing.

manchester,3dmuy1,Kangaroopower,3,Sat Jul 18 01:38:10 2015 UTC,I was actually doing my MSc. for the year. Starting the PhD. next year in France. My dissertation was trying to extract a faint signal (the 21cm hydrogen line if you're curious) from the early universe.
manchester,3dmuy1,Mim-Z,2,Sat Jul 18 19:12:35 2015 UTC,ELI5: 21cm hydrogen line
manchester,3dmuy1,rhyswynne,4,Sun Jul 19 03:12:41 2015 UTC,"Let's see. So after the big bang the universe was a big messy soup of extremely energetic particles for about 500,000 years. During this period, light couldn't travel through the universe, because of all the stuff in the way. Then as the universe expanded and cooled, suddenly all the free particles bouncing around combined and formed neutral hydrogen. The whole universe became clear, and was composed almost entirely of neutral hydrogen. This period is called the 'Dark Ages', because there was no light being emitted. It's an incredibly interesting time too, as it's when structure began to form in the universe -- from uniform hydrogen to dense clumps the eventually collapsed into stars and galaxies, but notoriously difficult to study as there is no light being emitted.  The lucky thing is, it turns out that neutral hydrogen does emit a very faint light called 21cm radiation, which is a result of something called a 'spontaneous spin flip' which is a bit technical. Point being, neutral hydrogen releases a very faint light, which means we can study this exciting period if we are able to detect this faint light. The issue here is that, when we look out for this faint light coming from the early universe, there is much brighter stuff in the way (cloudy nebula in our galaxy, stars, thousands of distant galaxies). So my project was to study ways of seeing past all the much brighter stuff (specifically I worked on dealing with distant radio galaxies), in order to recover the faint signal. We don't have telescopes sensitive enough to see this signal yet, but with an upcoming one called the Square Kilometer Array, we should be able to. So we're rushing to get our techniques working before the SKA starts collecting data."

manchester,3dq32j,vln,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:16:17 2015 UTC,Hah yes well I dont doubt there are some living out of the way also. So these ones we see are perhaps the ones more afraid of the dark? Id think it would be more dangerous sleeping where the worst of society can see you all the time and steal from (other homeless stealing what little you have) or assault you. Your at your most vulnerable while asleep. I cant fall asleep when even someone I know is in the same room as me let alone strangers.
manchester,3dq32j,forgottenoldusername,5,Sat Jul 18 10:32:02 2015 UTC,"There is a documentary about Manchester's homeless somewhere on the internet, with faces you are bound to recognise. I can't find it unfortunately, but I think it was on vimeo.   Sleeping arrangements actually came up in this video in a very similar way to the question you asked. And to be honest, that was one of the most interesting/upsetting things about the video.  Put simply (like others have said), the old industrial/mill sites aren't safe. Either structurally unsafe or unsafe in terms of the type of people who hang about in them. One bloke in the video showed how he slept in a small room in an old unused building and barricaded the door because someone had previously come in and beat him and stole his few possessions while he was sleeping. It's always better to be uncomfy on the streets but in view of the public than trapped in a quiet space getting beaten up.   I have no qualms saying it, I don't really enjoy seeing the streets littered with homeless folk either, partly because I would rather see them safe, well and with a roof over their head and partly (rather selfishly) because it's unsightly.  But that video really put it into perspective, the amount of abuse homeless people get from drunken pricks at night-time is disgusting. It's even more upsetting that these people have to put up with that abuse from drunken pricks because it's safer than going elsewhere."
manchester,3dq32j,forgottenoldusername,3,Sat Jul 18 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"Ye the abuse from drunken pricks is what made it boggle my mind how they could bear it. Sad to think that that is the lesser evil.   I suppose its the same analogy then of why they don't go into hostels when the media are always saying they turn it down, because they get beaten up/robbed there too by the tyrants and opportunists running amok in those places.  This?: https://vimeo.com/45260069  Lol you must not have looked hard I merely typed in google 'manchester homeless documentary'."
manchester,3dq32j,Leetenghui,3,Sun Jul 19 11:32:09 2015 UTC,"Aye, I was speaking to a homeless bloke and he said to me he'd often turn down hostels because he felt so unsafe in them. He was trying to get off drugs so he said he'd rather sleep on the streets and avoid a situation where he will be surrounded by drug use rather than start using again him self. Horrible situation really!   This?: https://vimeo.com/45260069[1]  Lol you must not have looked hard I merely typed in google 'manchester homeless documentary'.   I think that's the one! I'll be honest, I didn't google it. Couldn't be bothered, but said I did cause I didn't want people to think I'm lazy... Well that plan went to shit didn't it!"
manchester,3dq32j,BenW1994,4,Sun Jul 19 19:14:22 2015 UTC,I spent a night with a homeless guy a few months ago (it's in British problems).  https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/2z85jv/drink_with_a_friend_ended_up_as_a_fake_homeless/  Anyway generally it is because the presence of CCTV and people reduces the likelyhood of being attacked. Bolton as I mention in the above posts opens up a secure yard area as the homeless people were being beaten up and set on fire by yobs.
manchester,3dq32j,aozissou,0,Sat Jul 18 11:15:13 2015 UTC,"Yes but it isnt like there are bands of yobs searching every building in manchester to set homeless on fire. It would just be opportunists who are much more likely to find one in a well commuted area.   The centre is where you get the highest concentration of mindless idiots wanting to take the piss, so I dont think that argument stands up.  Anyway maybe that is their reason and they honestly believe it and you are just imparting what they said so i wont shoot the messenger :D"
manchester,3dq32j,kirkvanhalen,2,Sat Jul 18 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"If I was looking to sleep somewhere outside, I'd feel much better sleeping where everyone can see me, rather than in the middle of no where.

Aside from a few catcalls we had absolutely no problems and were on good terms with our neighbours, even when walking home later on in the evening. I think the reputation of the place is a bit outdated - Moss Side has undergone some regeneration and the sense of community here is far nicer than anywhere else in Manchester that I've lived so far (Fallowfield, Ardwick and Salford). Also, people assume you have nothing worth stealing... Most crime reported on my street in the last few years has been car theft so maybe bear that in mind if you drive and want to park."

If you assume that a third of those officers are on duty at any time (which is cutting it fine..)  that's one officer for every 1000 people, or about 5 officers to cover each square mile. Of course you'd also expect some proportion to be doing things other than beat policing.. Not sure if that is sufficient nor not, I assume if they are chasing priorities it should be fine, but it does mean that if there is an incident that pulls say, 10 police officers to one location, you have several square miles of area where there the presence will be massively reduced, same goes for Friday and Saturday nights.."

The creation of the HS2 train development will see property prices go up significantly, as will devolution of many governmental powers to Manchester and other large constituencies, as the government has indicated they're moving towards.  The expensive prices you see now are because people expecting this sharp rise in the future are making small rises now. However, this also means that any property investment you make right now is likely to do well if the market goes as expected.  That being said, as with every investment, there is a risk and you should do more research into the property market, or talk to someone who has about this really."

Not sure if that's what you were referring to? If not, that's way off the mark.  You can't go wrong with an old-build and if it's a long-term investment, its value will grow. Go on any property/city forum and you will see Manchester is racing even further away from all other cities outside London.

manchester,3dhm3s,GingerFucker,2,Thu Jul 16 13:14:39 2015 UTC,"Isn't jeet kun do a combination of several fighting styles that you are already very good at?  Like, you get very good at karate, kung fu and boxing for example, and combine the most efficient methods of them all into a single style that's your own thing?  Or do I have that wrong?  How do they go about teaching something like that?"
manchester,3dhm3s,killit,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"It's a style that was created/compiled by Bruce Lee.  You don't have to know any styles first, as it's its own style :) it has some kung fu, some phillipino (sp?) weaponry, some kick boxing and some lessons on movement fluidity and speed (Bruce Lee was a champion cha cha dancer).   I was a complete fighting novice before I tried jeet. Unfortunately I've had to give it up but I can throw a mean punch and get a good kick to the temple in before I bail on a fight. Not that I fight, I'm a geeky girl that drinks in F.A.B."

It looks to me like it was accidental as someone had hit the officers hat which he tried to grab for hitting the arrested woman in the process.  Its also worth noting that people who were there say the protest turned violent and mobish with people throwing things at police weirdly just around the time the video makes its first cut to the girl being arrested.  I know all this makes it seem like im on the cops side. I am.

manchester,3dbrg4,AnotherCellarDoor,3,Wed Jul 15 08:38:38 2015 UTC,"Depends what you'd classify as 'best'.  You can get flats right in the city centre (Ancoats, NQ, Green Quarter) for around 800 per month with two bedrooms.  So, after bills and the rest of it, it's about 500.  That's where I'd live if I had a choice because I quite like that.  Living further out of town, towards Hulme way, you're looking at around 300/350 a month for a two bed flat.  So, with bills, that'd be within your budget and the area isn't that bad to live in.  Close commute, easy to get to town and back.  There are some modern flats towards Fallowfield although not too sure if you'd want to live there."
manchester,3dbrg4,Mordisquitos,6,Wed Jul 15 06:11:29 2015 UTC,"Living further out of town, towards Hulme way, you're looking at around 300/350 a month for a two bed flat.    Maybe a decade ago, but now £300/£350 a month in Hulme will get you one of the two bedrooms in a two bed flat.  Edit: rereading your comment makes me think that might be what you meant. Still, I thought I should make it clear."
manchester,3dbrg4,AnotherCellarDoor,2,Wed Jul 15 07:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's what I meant.  Thanks!"
manchester,3dbrg4,everythingscatter,3,Wed Jul 15 15:55:30 2015 UTC,"Just from looking at everything available on Rightmove in your budget I would say that the best areas with studio or 1 bed flats available are probably Didsbury or Chorlton if you value the 'nice-ness' of the area or Victoria Park or Levenshulme if you want somewhere not as upmarket but more central.  All those areas are fairly culturally diverse and all are well-connected in terms of public transport.  They are all quite different in character from each other so I guess maybe have a look at all of them and see which suit your taste or practical needs (commute, etc.)?  If you are willing to live in a houseshare then your options are more open.  I'm pretty sure you would find a decent choice of flats in the City Centre to look at for that price, or in other central areas like Hulme or Ancoats.  If you let us know the part of the city where you will be working then people might be able to advise about transport links."
manchester,3dbrg4,MDC-UK,2,Wed Jul 15 06:16:16 2015 UTC,Studio flats in Didsbury or Chorlton are as expensive as the City Center...that's if you want to live in more than a box.
manchester,3dbrg4,comicsandpoppunk,3,Wed Jul 15 08:00:56 2015 UTC,"I'm currently looking for a flat in Manchester and son, you aren't getting anything for £450 a month."
manchester,3dbrg4,BeExcellentPartyOn,2,Wed Jul 15 11:42:59 2015 UTC,"It depends whether you're interested in living in the centre / willing to find a house share for the costs. I moved to Manchester 18 months ago out of uni for work and found a great house share on Spareroom in Fallowfield, £425 all bills inc. I now live in a good sized 2 person flat right in Parrswood, Didsbury for £280 ex. bills, which works out cheaper than my last place.  I would definitely recommend considering it especially if you're just starting out, look for a professional house share on Spareroom or similar within Fallowfield/Didsbury/Withington/Chorlton. It's much cheaper than renting a microscopic solo flat for £650+ more, and even if you're working in the centre public transportation is never an issue.  I had a very similar budget to you when I first moved and even now the thought of paying £650+ for a 1 person flat seems ridiculous!"
manchester,3dbrg4,mancunian,2,Wed Jul 15 09:43:46 2015 UTC,"I've recently moved to Whalley Range from Chorlton. I got a very nice 1 bed flat for £400pcm.   Lovely parks nearby. Easy to walk to Chorlton but my money has stretched so much further here! I have a large living room with dining table, sofa/futon decent PC desk, nice big rug, 60% plasma on an oak stand and a turntable/soundsystem and it doesn't feel in the slightest cramped.  Full shower/bathroom, decent size kitchen with new gas range and electric oven, full double bedroom.  To be honest, I think I've been lucky to get it at this price here… It certainly feels very safe with loads of grocers (I love cooking) and community groups, families playing out on the street…  Personally I'd always rather live in South Manchester than the centre. The centre's there if I really want to go in - which I probably do about zero times per week. All the people I grew up with hanging round the Northern Quarter have succumb to the South Manchester hipster diaspora.  Obviously you need to weigh up prices, transport etc in different areas. I was paying £350pcm for two sharing a three bed in the middle of Chorlton."

Atleast then you're not travelling far and there are always people around. Also you have the main transport networks so if you're working outside of the city centre you'll be easily taken care of. But for 450 a month, I think you're quite limited.   Heard they're doing Ancoats up, anything going round there?

If you share (and there are lots of opportunity for that, here) it will be much cheaper, though.  Good bars in Withington, convenient shops, fab transport links, and close to Didsbury and Chorlton, which also have good bars and shops.  Withington is more down to earth than the others, though and I prefer it for that (plus cheaper!)."

You might get people raise their eyebrows at the last two, I've lived there for 8 years now, I wouldn't live anywhere else, the people are amazing, there's loads to do, there's loads going on (if you can tolerate cricket/football/gigs/races/cycles/marathons, the main road is shut a few times a year for them and the cricket/football and gigs do cause some pretty big traffic problems but you just have to learn to work round them, they honestly don't bother me at all), it's like £6-7 for a taxi to town, the tram is 10 mins to town, there's buses to town and the trafford centre all the time, Salford Quays and Mediacity and all that is just down the road. Yeah it's a bit rougher than say Sale (still a good place to live, or Altrincham for that matter), the insurance isn't the cheapest but the houses are beautiful, you'll get good value for money and you're well connected. You probably wouldn't even need £450 a month."

The chilli, mango and yoghurt sauces work very well together. The pickled chillis are good, so don't shy away from them, and they don't make the rest of the food spicy if you find them too much.  Other 'must do' things....hmmm....we don't really have any, because we're a big city with a lot of variety but not big enough to have 'must do' things that are pure tourist bullshit.  There's tonnes of history, if that's your thing. The Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) is on the site of the original station of the first railway. The People's History Museum documents the rise of trade unionism and socialism. There's the Alan Turing statue (accidentally featuring in a very funniy animal video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8DiOthAKek). The Lowry Centre has a gallery which features both Lowry's work and other exhibitions. The Whitworth Art Gallery has recently reopened, to very good reviews.

manchester,3d9fcm,Leetenghui,2,Tue Jul 14 16:01:50 2015 UTC,You are VERY late to the scene. TBH everybody is already plotting jobs for the next academic year already.  The only places still hiring are European summer camps.. there are quite a few in Southern Russia and Turkey just for the summer. There are a few in Antwerp as well.  Anyway...  Ask them is it for Joe Bones. If it is it's a scam. He is a well known Manchester scammer. I sold gas for him a long time ago. Simply the targets to hit are impossible. When you do get a sniff of a sign up the team leader barges in and steals your lead.  Typically you need to get X amount of sign ups/donations per day. Get less than this get paid nothing. Get more than this and you take a slice of the sign ups. They base the hourly rate on an unrealistic number of sign ups a day.
manchester,3d9fcm,MDC-UK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:16:49 2015 UTC,Thought it sounded too good to be true. £10 an hour for fundraising seemed way high - this explains why!  Thanks for all the help

manchester,3d84h2,cheshirecheese,5,Tue Jul 14 08:02:34 2015 UTC,If you mean what I think you mean then that's a pain because it's a handy cut-through from Edgeley to the centre. I suppose it's trespassing on the railway but I'm 'ard enough to risk it to avoid the extra minute walk.
manchester,3d84h2,idowys,3,Tue Jul 14 08:17:08 2015 UTC,"It's not a penalty fare zone, so you're not fare-evading unless you actually get on a train. The cut-through business does explain why it took them so long to get around to putting barriers in given that they always have staff checking tickets anyway: they probably had to have lawyers go into the details to ensure they weren't going to be challenged for obstructing a right-of-way."
manchester,3d84h2,vln,2,Tue Jul 14 10:33:24 2015 UTC,It seems pretty silly they'd do it on the entrances to the underpass and not at the bottom of the stairs (if that's not what they've done) to be honest because it sounds like you can't get to the (real life human) ticket office from Edgeley side. I suppose it's solved the problem of having to trudge to Stockport side to buy a ticket then trudging back to Edgeley side to get on a train if they've put machines there but occasionally you need a *shock* real person.
manchester,3d84h2,idowys,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:15:32 2015 UTC,"There probably isn't enough space at the bottom of the stairs to do it safely, plus it'd mean you could just use the lift to get around it.  Yeah, if they haven't put a machine at the Edgeley side, that's just shitty implementation. However, they might be hoping to find a way to turn that into emergency-exit-only?"
manchester,3d84h2,vln,2,Tue Jul 14 11:25:22 2015 UTC,I really hope not given the free 20 min parking on the Edgeley side is much better for drop-offs / pick-ups.
manchester,3d84h2,doodlelogic,2,Tue Jul 14 12:01:22 2015 UTC,They are putting in barriers at Piccadilly as well apparently.
manchester,3d84h2,WhitbyRoadSoldier,3,Tue Jul 14 08:21:26 2015 UTC,"They're already there.  I passed through the other week and there were 7 staff standing around, one with a ticket machine and a long queue of people trying to buy a ticket."
manchester,3d84h2,Christopherfromtheuk,2,Tue Jul 14 08:32:53 2015 UTC,During peak travel times every platform will have two people checking tickets as you board/leave a train - even along the top pathway down from platforms 13 and 14 to the other platforms. There's no automated barriers in place yet - only a matter of time though I'll wager...
manchester,3d84h2,yousaiditwasachip,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:07:27 2015 UTC,Maybe if the plans to revamp the station go through then we might see more automation
manchester,3d84h2,Downing_Street_Cat,2,Tue Jul 14 10:43:31 2015 UTC,"I hope they manage it better than the system at Oxford Road.   It's nigh on impossible to get into the station if one of the many, frequently over capacity trains has just released a hoard of impatient berks.  So many times I've had to give people the are you serious face as I've been forced back from the entrance as they barge through the only 2 barriers designated as entrances."

There was an attempt to have the route declared a right of way, but it was unsuccessful. Virgin are making some very unconvincing noises about staff using discretion to let people through."

Fantastic range of games though and the staff are helpful and very knowledgable.  As for games, Munchkin is a classic that'll quickly have you scheming against your friends, it has a really fun game feel and the best part is you can mix and match any and all of the numerous editions. Want to play a game full of pirates, superheroes and quivering shoggoths? Munchkin is the one for you.  Another personal favourite is Boss Monster, a dungeon building card game styled after retro roguelike games (The box is designed like a NES game, you can't miss it). The general idea is to add rooms to your dungeon, each with their own traps and treasures, and each turn random heroes make their way through whichever dungeon appeals to them the most. You want your dungeon to draw more heroes than the other players so that you can kill as many as possible, but you don't want to get overrun and end up being destroyed yourself. Very easy to pick up but lots of room for varied strategies."
manchester,3d0823,moiadipshit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:16:02 2015 UTC,That sounds like a top game and not one I've heard of before and I'm always on the look for new ones. Munchkin has just been on my list and had such a massive urge to get it I was a man on the edge but I often can't get in to Manchester centre :( got a copy now and I'll keep an eye out for boss monster too thanks

manchester,3ctua0,kjhefaekfobguo,12,Fri Jul 10 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"As a taxi driver I can tell you it was around 2008 when the economic downturn happened, as you said. Before then they were long hard nights. If you got stuck on a particular side of town you generally stayed there, as there were lots of fares walking out of town down the main roads, frustrated at the mayhem in the city centre . An honest taxi driver wasn't able to get back into town till after 4 am on the weekends, and if i was stuck on the salford or rochdale rd side I sometimes used to turn the lights off till I got to somewhere like Oxford road because Peter and Portland St were an ugly sight with uncouth drunken youths, and loud obnoxious and violent thugs walking in the middle of the street, fighting and fucking on the corners. It was a proper Babylon.   It resembled something like a zombie apocalypse, with people running to the taxi, jumping in, two separate parties at a time, and I was always looking to find the gentlemanly/ladylike fares who might want to go south towards didsbury, where there was always a chance of picking up students and the trendy people who walked up and down wilmslow rd."
manchester,3ctua0,doejinn,6,Fri Jul 10 21:33:04 2015 UTC,Interesting perspective. so it isnt just something in my mind then in terms of less people going out in general nowadays? i wondered if it was just a case of me getting older and becoming more cynical trying to hark back to my younger days.
manchester,3ctua0,swaggalikemoi,9,Fri Jul 10 22:04:24 2015 UTC,"brilliant write up. i like skallies. i hate violent people though.  i think you hit the nail on the head. people are staying in and getting pissed.  round my way (a large council estate in manchester) there used to be so many pubs, now, all closed - i suspect for the same reasons that ultimately killed the printworks.  shoutouts to waves bar and portland street massive if you fancy experiencing the older skally.   its actually sad that people dont go out as much. much less of a community these days.  and its sad to see the skallies coming into the NQ. i know i said i like skallies, but you are more likely to get into a scrap with these fellas and i by no means enjoy that. i mean just cos you slicked back your hair, got yourself a blazer, shoved in a 90s playing rnb club doesn't mean the violent rage inside has dissipated.  there is a culture of skallies ditching sportswear, ben shermans and g star raw jeans for the blazer. probably influenced by that made in essex/chelsea stuff.   bit of a ramble but just some of my thoughts that fell out."
manchester,3ctua0,swaggalikemoi,3,Fri Jul 10 21:45:25 2015 UTC,Oh ye wave bar- wait do you mean bar wave on portland or sachas wave bar on oldham st by aflecks? Ive often seen some thoroughbred older looking scals outside the latter mostly in the daytime in the week :) I havent had the courage to go in there tho at night in case it was a territorial type of place and I walked into an ambush :) Is it ok in there? ie no worse than lloyds for instance in pworks? In fact i love me some scally milfs if its just for some harmless fun when out and about. Not only do they have their carefree scally attitude but theyve dropped most of the pretence and just wanna have fun and make the most of what attention they still get :). Is there a dancefloor in that place? A venue isnt complete without a dingy dancefloor to get a cheeky grind on come 1.15 onwards ;). Might scope the place out this weekend. Cheers for the reminder :) There is walkabout too but alas its another rudderless ghost ship.  Re the scallies and blazer...its like the casual wearing hooligans of the 80s :). Scallies on the town used to stick out like a sore thumb with their ed hardy garb and the like but now they all follow the mainstream trend with the short at the sides and shiny combover hair like every other robotic trendy :(. Theyve lost their unique identity.

I rarely venture out of the centre.  Its sad though, coming back to my original point of the decline of the nightlife. Ive tried looking for other out of the way haunts but they are in even worse states than the mainstream places. Its like the mainstream ones are just barely hanging on and anything that doesnt cater to the aboslute lowest common denominator was obliterated a couple of years ago.  I mean even 5th avenue. That used to be the absolute best for an easy indie pull but those fuckers have totally sold out trying to cater to a wider audience. Watered down to fuck now and again only trendy house shufflers in there.  I guess its a reflection of the current government.

You could have a really good pub crawl walking down the main roads in your local area. I think due to it being easier to police, they want us all in town. Also due to people my own age 19-20 odd... How many of them drink in a local boozer?   Not many, they head to town dressed up as you say. So in that sense the local pubs run out of money and boom... One more gone. Such a shame."

manchester,3ctua0,swaggalikemoi,7,Mon Jul 13 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"I was a doorman in Manchester for the past 8 years and noticed this too.   You had that whole strip where Brannigans was, m2 (royales), Chicago rock cafe goin towards jumping Jacks etc it was always a good shift. Goin over to Ritz and their Wednesday 70's night was a huge scally night! You'd have a laugh with the girls have a scrap or two - good times!   Then the bar scene took off. Deansgate locks opened its bars, printworks came along etc prices began to go up even in clubs like opus and the other one across from it.   Cost is the main reason. We began to notice people were  coming out less but when they did they'd spend a big chunk. They'd save up for that one night blow out. So the thinking was if we gonna spend then might aswell go to a nice bar.   Clubs began to do less offers. I remember a local club (now shut down) you'd get 4 cocktails for a fiver!   The only ones I can think now as scally are moon under water and Lloyds bar in the printworks. Again both are big on cheap drinks. Bar wave bar rogue on Portland St is another. And of course Yates bar too  Since the bars came people mostly behaved and gave the excuse to bar owners to cut down the doorman per person (used to b one door lad per 50-70 people)   Bars and clubs have had to turn away the scally crowd too which meant less people were willing to come down to the city and risk not getting in anywhere. The police and licensing have had a hand in that."

Ye the strictness seems to have ramped up considerably over the years. That is another factor I hadnt considered. Hows a disconcerting scally supposed to let their hair down :)? Now there are just these faux chavvy places like factory where the crowd are chavs really but have a stick up their ass thinking they are something special so think they are middle class.

Out of those Chorlton was the most lively Whalley Range the quieter, and Old Trafford (basically on the Range's doorstep though) the cheapest.  Urmston is a bit out of the way, but that's why I like it. Lots of green space, birds tweeting (you don't realise how much you miss it), wildlife near the Mersey. Houses tend to have their own space/decent gardens etc compared to urban Manchester. The schools (if you're interested) are excellent and and everyone has been really friendly.

I would go for a walk around the Victoria Park area and see. You will find some really nice streets and then some sketchy ones.

I think Mancunians are overly snobbish about their suburbs, but as a walker I would much rather live in Victoria Park or even Moss Side or Hulme than Didsbury! You would be near Platt Fields Park and also Whitworth Park (and Whitworth museum) and also very close to curry mile, which is fun and safe enough for me!

In Slaters they're really good at helping you pick the right size.

Best in manchester however is Booths. They have a bloody great selection, brilliant prices, and some good offers. Picked up and Aberlour A'Bunadh for £23 a couple of weeks ago. They also do samples."

There's a bar on Richmond Street next to a wonderful tearoom called Richmond Tea Rooms which is decorated in the style of Alice in Wonderland style. The bar is really nice, especially upstairs. G-A-Y is great but they have a strict door policy. Don't get there too late, pretend to be gay and split up and enter in smaller groups if your group is too big."

manchester,3c4mqz,dannyinside,3,Sat Jul 4 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure being a foreigner doesn't have anything to do with price, we all get shafted.  Google cheap insurance tips for under 25's. There's some good information about. For example, you'll get much cheaper insurance buying a more expensive car (£1500-£3000) with a bigger engine size (around 1.4l) than a shitty £500 1l Clio.   Try and price up something like a relatively old 1.4 Astra and see the difference"
manchester,3c4mqz,middlemanmark,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:13:35 2015 UTC,Where can i try to get quotes then? I tried gocompare.com but no result shows up everytime i try to get one
manchester,3c4mqz,ParrotofDoom,2,Sun Jul 5 08:29:54 2015 UTC,Do you have a UK licence? You are legally obliged to obtain one if you have a foreign licence and drive here for more than 12 months

If you're saying gocompare is not offering you a price then you've got something else involved which is making them decline. Some don't like quoting unless you actually own a car and have the reg for it, but again I'd expect you'd get some.  What are some of the decline reasons you're getting on gocompare? (Everyone has to return a reason as to why they didn't quote, even if its not always the actual one)"

The exhibition has works made by Star group artists including Ai Weiwei, Cao Fei and Zhang Peili. The pieces explore the cultural restraint in China and the subsequent underground art scene from 1970 to 2010.  Gerhard Richter and Arvo Pärt have an exhibition space to tie in with Manchester International Festival, open 9th - 19th July.  Current exhibitions happening now feature a variety of artists such as William Blake, JMW Turner, Lucian Freud, Sarah Lucas, Thomas Schütte and many others.  Ending soon: Sarah Lucas, who represented England at this year's Venice Biennale, and Thomas Schütte. These are to be replaced with exhibitions by Welsh artist Bedwyr Williams and English artist Cornelia Parker."
