WiggleButts,3e2u2c,bluebaloo525,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"Puppies go thru fear stages at this age, as you are aware. I went thru this not long ago with Korbin. He still will react to a human doing something weird. Like we had training class at a park and an adult man decided to pretend he was an airplane.   I think you have a pretty normal average puppy. It sounds like you're handling it perfectly too. Continue with it, as well as training classes, and I think you'll end up with a well behaved, well socialized dog who interacts normally. Keep in mind not to push him too hard during what are recognized as ages for being especially fearful. An experienced trainer will be able to help you work thru this too.   My experiences with fear periods with Korbin? Varied from fearful of people walking to completely ignoring. The fear would show in a barking fit. It lasted until he was about 6 months old. Now it a crowd of people, he just ignores everyone."
WiggleButts,3e2u2c,cpersall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"Ah. Thanks for the reassurance. Thankfully he doesn't bark at strangers and he doesn't growl, but he definitely looks skeptical. We are trying to get in training classes asap! haha"
WiggleButts,3e2u2c,signgirlamy10,2,Tue Jul 21 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"It sounds relatively normal. I would meet new people and expose him to new situations everyday as you are doing, but if he doesn't want to go up to people or just wants to ignore them, that is fine. Don't force him to interact. I find it super annoying when people make their puppies say hi to everyone and then you get adult dogs thinking everyone they see must be paid attention to. Your dog needs to know you will not make him feel uncomfortable. If someone is acting like an arm waving shrieky asshole when approaching your puppy, turn around and walk away. Why force a dog to have an interaction? At that point you are making the dog more likely to react by barking, hiding, biting, etc because the dog is uncomfortable."
WiggleButts,3e2u2c,turlian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:16 2015 UTC,"I don't really force him to interact, but I usually give the stranger a treat to give him so he has positive associations and then he will decide after that if he will love on them or just walk off. Do you think that is a bad idea? I am trying not to push him haha"

WiggleButts,3dzclg,Cubfanatic,3,Mon Jul 20 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"Somewhat relevant  Please don't get an aussie without meeting several in real life before. Get out to dog events and shows. You shouldn't have any issue meeting Aussies at agility or herding trials. What area do you live?   The Aussie parent club website is the best source of info: ASCA  You want to know about energy? Here's an example of Aussie energy:  Met up with a friend who has a collie and toller this morning. They went swimming and ran at the park for a couple hours. And then I came home and took my boys for a bike ride for 45 min. They'll also get another walk or ball time for 30 min while I'm at work. This is a pretty typical day for us. And then on top of that, they need mental stimulation. Can you do that every day?   What experience with dogs do you have, specifically high energy dogs? Are you interested in a dog sport? Aussies are more of a breed for someone who's looking for a dog as a hobby not just a pet. What type of training are you interested in? Are you ok with barking and fur everywhere?   And no no no to aussie haircuts. A tidy up trim along the feathered areas is all they get. Their body area is not cut.My Aussies have never been to a groomer. I do it at home. Length of coat will depend on genetics. Some Aussies are furrier than others."
WiggleButts,3dzclg,cpersall,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"I replied to your other post, but in addition to that here is a little album of life with my 2 Aussies. The central theme is that they're very involved in our lives.  http://imgur.com/a/WgIM1"
WiggleButts,3dzclg,catnip51,2,Tue Jul 21 00:40:57 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. My aussie is around 7 months now. I have a big yard, but her exercise needs aren't too bad. I take her to the dog park every morning for about an hour and she's pretty good for the rest of the day. I do a lot of capturing calmness with her and I can do probably two days without exercise before she turns into a nut. I walk her after work a couple times a week, 3-5 miles, and usually one longer hike on weekends.  On weekends with my brother and I home, she doesn't really need exercise. Just hangs out with us as we putter around the yard or whatever.   She can be extremely high energy, but her off switch is pretty good now. I've done 10 mile hikes and she could probably go for more. However she's been trained that home time is chill time and for the most part it's working.  Maybe I'm lucky, but I definitely don't need to take her running 3 times a day."
WiggleButts,3dzclg,kikimonster,2,Tue Jul 21 02:26:27 2015 UTC,"I don't want to over step, but I suspect your experience might be more common than many are leading me to believe. Of course, I don't have any experience, but many here and online just seem a tad over zealous."
WiggleButts,3dzclg,kikimonster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:07:02 2015 UTC,"I think so too. But at the dog park, I'm not just talking about aussie owners. It seems like most puppy owners do a crap ton of exercise with their pups. And with my high energy breed, they automatically assume I do three times what they do. I'm like ""nah... This dog park visit right now is all she really gets. We might do a walk later if I'm up for it.""  However I don't know though. It's really hard to know what behavior is trained or innate when you're capturing it. Taking to some dog walkers, and some their clients have insane australian shepherds.   However.... Maybe I do exercise mine quite a bit and don't realize it. I've lost 20 pounds since getting her.... I might have a broken concept of normal exercise..."
WiggleButts,3dzclg,teardrop87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:00:05 2015 UTC,"My Aussie is 2 1/2, and he's crazy full of energy. We live in an apartment with a small yard, so he's in and out for most of the day. I'm a housewife, so I can give him mental stimulation multiple times per day. He gets multi hour trail walks and river swims on the weekend, and a 2.5 mile walk daily. He likes to run and play at the dog park, but we have to keep a very close eye on him. He plays rough when he wrestles, and he's toy agressive. I'm hesitant to bring him back because he got over heated or over excited and had a small seizure earlier this month.   I do all my own grooming, and it's not that bad. He gets slicker brushed at least once a week. I try for more often, but he thinks it's a game. I use the undercoat rake once a month, and that's when I do all the major grooming. He gets bathed, raked, brushed, nails clipped, ears cleaned, and I use clippers for his sanitary trim. He sits still only because he gets a slice of bacon when I'm done.  He's really smart, so he's easy to teach new tricks. Sometimes he's too smart. He knows how to open all the doors in the house and what the jar of peanut butter looks like. It now lives on top of the fridge. Socialization is key, and we've had him around people, kids, and dogs from about 8 weeks. Cats freak him out though, so he doesn't like them.  We have no kids, but he plays well with the ones he saw at the dog park. We also have a doxie, so he's super gentle when it comes to puppies and smaller dogs.They get along great, and will chase each other around the house.   I think that answers all your questions. Feel free to ask more, and I'll answer what I can."
WiggleButts,3dzclg,princess_cc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"We were in the same position as you a few months ago. We decided we were finally getting a dog and did our breed research and decided on a Mini American Shepherd because it seemed it would fit nicely into our lifestyle.  We wanted a dog that would be capable of being really active, hiking and running with us, but would also be a good as part of the family, functioning well indoors.    We loved the look of these dogs as well  We decided on a breeder and were waiting for a puppy when we happened to find a mini at the Humane Society.  We've had her for two months now and Wow, she is an amazing dog.  She is everything we've read about the breed.  Even though she is a bit older, about 8 years old, and came to us a little out of shape;  She does runs regularly with us and is an awesome hiker and you can just feel the joy, she really LOVES to get her exercise.  Having her just makes it so much more enjoyable to get out.  We were active before but she adds and element to it that we didn't know we were missing!  So for us, her capability for lots of exercise is a plus, but that could be a minus if you are not used to being active.  Its really a requirement to keeping her happy.  Even though she is great for exercise, she is also really great at home.  She is calm and happy and loves being around us.  If you've heard of the term ""velcro dog""  this is how she is.  Generally, She's wherever I am.  I hate when we have to go somewhere without her because I know she loves being with us!  When we come home from being away you should see the greeting we get, its like she is crying from joy, its one of my favorite things.     She's incredibly smart and easy to train, she came to us with a few bad habits but she has responded really quickly to training.  There are big results from just a little training.    She is wary of strangers, I have read you have to be really good about socializing this breed when they are young because they are naturally built to be wary of strangers.  I don't know if she got this socialization.  Its not really a problem, she is just shy around people and shy's away when strangers try to pet her which of course everyone does because she is adorable!  We have her out a lot and around a lot of new people but this hasn't seemed to improve so not sure this is fixable at a later stage in life.    As far as grooming, I love to do my own!  We bathe her ourselves, sometimes weekly if we've been our hiking a lot because she gets pretty dirty.  I comb her daily to keep her undercoat free of dead furr.  I have trimmed her legs and paws myself after watching turtorials on youtube, probably not pro looking but I'm sure I'll get better.  We did get her a professional groom just before summer to have her hair trimmed short (not shaved, just shorter) which was definitely a good idea to help them stay cool and for hiking its great because she doesn't get a lot of sticks and things stuck in her furr.    Im sure all dogs differ in personality and what not, but this is our experience.  We love her so much we're planning to still bring home the puppy!  Good Luck!  I hope you find a great dog.  If you have the right lifestyle and can put in the time, these dogs are awesome."

WiggleButts,3dzclg,cpersall,0,Tue Jul 21 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"I myself have a Shetland Sheepdog, and although they are not the same breed, they are relatively similar breeds. Obviously Shelties are smaller, but my Sheltie has free roam of my house, and hasn't touched a single thing besides his toys. Both breeds are EXTREMELY smart, and can be easily trained. I potty trained him in 1 week, taught him sit and come in 2 days, and roll over and play dead in 1 day. Both breeds are very very smart and because of this they will have much more personality. They are also herding dogs so they need to run, an Aussie will probably not work in an apartment. However, herding dogs are very sociable as they worked with others, and if you teach them when young, will be the sweetest dog in the park. Eating habits are different for every individual dog, so I don't want to say much for that. My dog always has food in his bowl, and eats when he' hungry, my friends dog eats anything that touches the floor. Grooming I don't know myself, but the Sheltie sheds moderately, and his coat is more Aussie than Sheltie for some reason. I have to say that my Sheltie is the best thing to ever happen to me in the world and I'm sure an Aussie will be too.(Aussie + Border Collie are next on my list!!) Good luck with any future dogs, and as I said, I myself do not have an Aussie, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Have fun!!!"

I mainly use the slicker to remove burrs or other junk the dogs pick up at the lake or hiking. The other brushes are my primary grooming brushes.  I also use a pair of curved scissors to trim feet and thinning shears for ears."
WiggleButts,3dt9fo,cpersall,2,Sun Jul 19 21:04:29 2015 UTC,Mostly just a comb.   I also dislike furminators. They cut and tear the top coat and I don't think they do a good job of getting out undercoat anyway.

WiggleButts,3dmwg8,OhLookAnAirplane,3,Fri Jul 17 15:51:22 2015 UTC,You were able to find a reputable breeder with puppies available quickly!
WiggleButts,3dmwg8,cpersall,3,Sun Jul 19 06:08:24 2015 UTC,"So will she be waiting to make final decisions on placements until the pups have been evaluated as show, pet or performance quality? That's awfully young to be able to pick out puppies based on personality."
WiggleButts,3dmwg8,cpersall,4,Mon Jul 20 14:18:22 2015 UTC,What titles do the dogs have if she's not showing?   Double merles don't just happen. You know when you're breeding 2 merles...
WiggleButts,3dmwg8,cpersall,4,Mon Jul 20 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"Not showing is a HUGE red flag. If she was breeding working dogs (dogs who had extraordinary working skill and titles to prove it), not showing wouldn't be a concern. But since she's doing neither, what's there to prove her dogs? Other than her own opinion on what a aussie should be, nothing. There's nothing to show that she's breeding correct type, good structure or correct personality. Being registered really doesn't mean anything. Even puppy mills often register their dogs.   You do want a show dog, or at least a breeder who's breeding show quality dogs as not all in a litter will be show quality.   There's a couple red flags with this breeder that I'm bringing up because a few weeks ago you were looking for help with finding a reputable breeder:  Not showing and not having other advanced titles in a sport such as herding is a huge concern. If she's breeding only for companion (Aussies are a working breed, not a companion breed, so that in itself is a red flag), I'd expect sporting titles in things such as obedience and agility.   Allowing the new owner to pick out their own puppy at only 3 weeks of age is another red flag. Even if she's breeding companions, there is no way to accurately guess the personality and energy level of a 3 week old puppy. You picked the one that you thought was snuggly, but the puppy was only 3 weeks old, they don't really do much else at that age.   What health clearances exactly? What are their hip and elbow scores? Eyes? What health issues in the dogs lines? The way you're describing the breeder the mom came from adds even more concern.   Honestly I'd say to pick another breeder. Feel free to PM me her name and maybe that'll change my opinion. But based on what you've told me, I'd say run."

Preferred height at the withers for males is 20 to 23 inches; that for females is 18 to 21 inches, however, quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size."

WiggleButts,3d9sjp,FSHammersmith,3,Tue Jul 14 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have a reactive aussie. He's a little different than how you're describing but still very much reactive, especially on leash.   Hire a behaviorist. It sounds like you need professional help that can only be done in person.   Don't go to dog parks. They're really not a very good place to socialize a dog. Even if you get to the point that you feel like you can control your dog, all it takes is someone else with a poorly trained and socialized dog to ruin it for you. Lots of on leash walk dates with easy going dog buddies are good. Learning to walk near a dog without directly interacting is a good way to safely socialize a dog. If he has an ""angry moment"" when you 1st meet up with the walking buddy, don't give up, just keep walking. If needed you can give them a little space by walking on opposite sides of the road to start.   Continue to work on his focus and recall. Keep in mind that you do want to be rewarding him for not reacting, not just shoving treats in his face as a distraction. While distracting can work for the moment, it may not help long term. You do want him to acknowledge the other dog but still return his attention to you.   I've had good and bad experiences with gentle leaders/haltis. They can help to control the dog, but I've also found that they can make reactive dogs even more reactive. You might want to try working with a regular collar, or maybe a martingale if you're worried about him slipping the collar.   More exercise, especially adding in mental exercise, can definitely help. It can help create a more relaxed dog overall which will translate into his socialization skills.   Heres a quick video of me working with Ozzy as a group of dogs pass (turn down the volume, random talking and barking). This is at a dyke along the river that is technically on leash but most people allow their dogs off leash. The whippets and min pin and group of leashed dogs passing are the ""stranger dogs,"" the other aussie and the brown lab-ish looking dog belong to my friend and I. The min pin is actually growling at Ozzy here and not responding to the owner calling it. I wish I had a ""before"" video to go with this. Before would have been a lot of lunging and barking."
WiggleButts,3d9sjp,cpersall,2,Tue Jul 14 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"Right now the ""Hey. Do the trick and watch the treat"" thing is very much a stopgap and you're completely right, it's not going to help long term.   I was wondering about the dog behaviorists since that looks like a good 'long term' training solution.  Do you know what I should be looking for when searching for one? Warning signs, red flags to watch out for and, conversely, indicators they're good at the job?   He's -good- at slipping his collar, and has found out how to duck his head and walk/pull backwards with his head down to try to slip out of it if he's on the leash.  Scared the hell out of my parents when they were walking him one day and didn't know better. (Later suckers, I'm going home! Said Major the escape artist) He can't do that in the gentle leader, and it looks like the martengale collar would give the same security.   The martingale collar might be a good idea, and looks like it'd be an easy investment to start with while I go looking for a behaviorist. I can get one of those collars easy, it looks like, but if you have a brand to recommend I'd love to hear it.     I was using the gentle leader to leash train him since I'd gotten him from the shelter (it's saved his lunging butt so many times.)  It'd be easy to move to a new 'walking' collar.  Edit: I'll watch the vid later this evening, I'm on the move right now, but I appreciate any reference I can get!"
WiggleButts,3d9sjp,cpersall,2,Tue Jul 14 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"I've had good and bad experiences with behaviorist, so yes, definitely be careful about who you choose. Ask around at local dog clubs and veterinarians for recommendations. And then ask those recommendations for references. You want someone who has plenty of experience with the type of issue you need to work on and is also up-to-date on dog behavior and training. You also want someone who can explain their methods and have it make sense to you. Stay away from ""old school"" behaviorists who recommend Cesar Milan type methods. While I'm not convinced that it needs to be 100% positive reinforcement, Cesar's training methods and ideas have been disproven. You want someone who can teach you, show you body language to watch for, point out handling errors, and have you do the training.   For the martingale, these plenty of brands to choose from. Cheap plain ones at Petsmart to fancy colorful ones from etsy. I have found that sometimes the chain part can chew up the dogs neck fur, especially with furry Aussies. You might find an all fabric collar to be a better option if it's going to be a daily use collar."
WiggleButts,3d9sjp,newslady112,2,Tue Jul 14 20:34:38 2015 UTC,"We had to hire a behaviorist with our old corgi, but it was hard to find one who didn't do ""old school"" methods with ours. We had the best luck calling the local humane society to find out who they hire to asses strays and drop offs.   I was so anxious during the process of finding one, but it really is worth the time to find the right person to work with."

WiggleButts,3cot3f,radler470,3,Thu Jul 9 16:10:30 2015 UTC,"She is super cute! Did you get your puppy from a breeder or was she a rescue? I'm guessing rescue since you said you were told she was an Aussie. If she was a rescue you may never know for sure.  Those puppy weight charts are generally crap. What I've found works best for Aussies and BCs is to double their weight at 16 weeks to get an estimate of adult weight. This always seems to be within a few pounds for my dogs and people I know. Of course that depends on what kind of condition your dog is in as well.  She does look pretty fine boned in the pics you posted so obviously would weigh less than a larger boned dog. My Aussie bitch is 18"" tall and 31 pounds so she is definitely on the tiny side for the breed. If you know the pup's parents that could give you an idea, but you really never know. Rave's mom is about 18.25"" so I knew there was a chance of smaller dogs in the litter, but Rave is 18"" and one of her sisters is 19.5"" so again... never really know with genetics. But her size alone at this point isn't enough to tell you if your dog is an Aussie or not."
WiggleButts,3cot3f,signgirlamy10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:59:52 2015 UTC,"Mini australian shepherds are not considered an akc breed. They are recognized under the name Miniature American Shepherds and the parents would have to be akc registered as that breed for her to have this title. If both parents were registered as Australian shepherds, then she would be considered a ""purebred"" Australian shepherd, but would possibly just not conform to the breed standard. An aussie is considered ""mini"" when they are 14-18 in at the whither (which is basically the shoulder). Weight does not factor,  although assuming a healthy weight, 30 lbs would more than likely be considered ""mini"". I have two minis and they are both around 25lbs. I have seen plenty of purebred standard aussies that are on the smaller side however, especially females. Either way, I wouldn't worry about it unless your intention was to show or breed your puppy. She is very cute and I hope behaving well for her age. :)"

Blah.  We definitely wouldn't have bred her anyways, and I imagine amateur flyball and so on won't mind as long as she can keep up!  Also thanks for the well wishes! She has gotten much better this last week, in terms of behavior.  We only got her ~4 weeks ago, and she's gone from ""not housebroken at all, bites everyone, will not deal with leash"" to ""mostly housebroken, can be stopped from biting by cue to sit, pulls at leash a little but does walk"".  Nice progress, I think!"
WiggleButts,3cot3f,bw1870,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"The breeder where you got your dog should know her parents and you can ask how big they were and that would give a decent indication(roughly anyway).

WiggleButts,3cn302,Pmatherne,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:40:39 2015 UTC,"You can start agility as soon as you've got some basic training down. Most agility training facilities/clubs will have puppy classes. So now. There's so much more to agility training than just jumping.   Jumping shouldn't happen until at least a year old or fully grown. Puppy agility classes often focus on other things 1st and and jumps are merely stepping over the jump and a very low height. The occasional jump won't hurt but repeated jumping even with something like the flirt pole can do long term damage.   When in doubt, get vet clearance before starting."
WiggleButts,3cn302,cpersall,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:02:12 2015 UTC,"You can start foundation agility anytime! There's lots of exercises that relate to agility that don't involve jumping or agility equipment at all. My youngster has been doing body awareness exercises (particularly rear end awareness), handling on the flat, and introduction to certain obstacles very low or on the ground (tunnels, dogwalk planks, table, cones or jump uprights) since he was probably 12-14 weeks. No intense drilling or anything too serious, but a few minutes of foundation work interspersed with play is great.   You don't want to do any serious jumping until their growth plates are closed, so close to a year old. My youngest is 15 months and just started jump training and weaves a couple months ago. He's eligible to compete in AKC at his age, but I've taken his training pretty slow so we're not even close to ready."
WiggleButts,3cn302,Unregistered_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"I start foundation training with my puppies as soon as they come home. You can never do too much foundation work... in fact we are still going back and playing a lot of those games now that she is 18 months.  Trying to think back of what Rave was doing at 7 months. Lots of drive building and relationship games, body awareness, starting end behavior for contact equipment (not on the equipment at this point but working end behavior), playing the bang it game on a low teeter. We did jump grid work with mainly puppy bumps and maybe a couple jumps at 8"". I don't work up to full height jumping until growth plates are closed. You can xray for that or start sometime around 15 mos if you don't want to xray.  At that age you don't want the repetitive motion of jumping. Is doing a few low jumps fine? In my book yes but nothing repetitive or drill-y.  In terms of play with a flirt pole, ball or other toy, I try to take it easy on them until growth plates are closed and they get more body awareness since lots of them can be kind of kamikaze and hurt themselves on accident. I still cringe at dogs who flip or contort themselves to catch a Frisbee, get the flirt pole, etc. Just not worth the risk of injury IMO"

Then I ignore him for just a minute (like 15 second tops, puppy attention span is short) and if he stays down during that time then I give him attention and tell him he's a good boy. If he keeps jumping I keep telling him no until he finally chills out and waits patiently on all fours, but I rarely ever have to tell him more than one time. If i do it's because we have company and he's just so excited haha. I'm sure some one has a better method but it's been working for me pretty well!"

Rave doesn't jump on me unless I invite her too because every time she jumped on me, I would turn around and ignore her until she stopped. She will jump on my friends and most strangers she meets because they encourage it. I've given up on teaching her not to jump on other people because I can't get my friends to listen to the rules :) If other people were as consistent as I am, she wouldn't jump on them either."
WiggleButts,3c96ri,signgirlamy10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:48:19 2015 UTC,"Same here, although he will jump on my wife because she is more relaxed about it. It's hard to get everyone on the same page. Our boy when excited will jump on people's back side, I think mostly because of the herding instinct. I did however, buy a remote collar that vibrates, it seems to help when company comes over and scares him just enough to keep his feet on the ground. Something else I have used is a beer can with a few rocks in it. I shake the can when he jumps on people and it works, but, it would work better if the guest had a can of their own. What am I supposed to do? Hand every guest a can full of rocks and explain the rules? Lol. Such is the life of an aussie owner......."
WiggleButts,3c96ri,signgirlamy10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:56:27 2015 UTC,"Downside of adding something aversive like the noise of the rocks in the can is that your dog may start to associate guests coming over with that noise and not be happy to see people anymore.  My two are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Rave thinks everyone is there to pay attention to her and she greets everyone with enthusiasm but then settles down after a few minutes. Benny is way too reserved and wary of strangers, and is usually unhappy to see anyone he doesn't know so he will sometimes bark the whole time they are there. I'd rather have the happy greeter than an upset dog barking in his crate."

WiggleButts,3c4qtm,filsdepub,2,Sun Jul 5 10:24:55 2015 UTC,This is just the best
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,cousintit,4,Sat Jul 4 14:09:35 2015 UTC,What is his mix?
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,cpersall,-4,Sat Jul 4 19:32:42 2015 UTC,No mix! She is a pure miniature Aussie :)
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,MockingbirdRambler,7,Sat Jul 4 20:39:19 2015 UTC,"He looks slightly chi, with a hint of papillion.  Have you done a DNA test?"
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,cpersall,-2,Sat Jul 4 21:16:53 2015 UTC,"Haha really? She is from a registered breeder, we used the same breeder for our other mini Aussie."
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,cpersall,4,Sat Jul 4 22:39:09 2015 UTC,Breeders aren't and can't be registered.
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,MockingbirdRambler,-1,Sat Jul 4 22:48:16 2015 UTC,"Lol I meant the dogs are registered. We have papers for them, both of them. We know a few friends who have used the same breeder as well."
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,coyotestories,4,Sat Jul 4 22:52:23 2015 UTC,I'm guessing ASDR?
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,coyotestories,4,Sat Jul 4 23:01:12 2015 UTC,Ok.. she looks nothing like the Austrailan Shepherd breed she is supposed to bea bred down version of. If she were anything but merle she would look like a mix and nothing like an Aussie.
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,catnip51,-2,Sat Jul 4 23:40:20 2015 UTC,LOL ok.
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,catnip51,-4,Sat Jul 4 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"You've seen one picture and she's 10 weeks old. It doesn't matter to me either way, just sharing a pic of my super cute pup."
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,WhoYouCallinTurkey,7,Sun Jul 5 00:02:40 2015 UTC,"A 10 week old aussie looks like a 10 week old aussie. Your dog looks like a 10 week old blue pom mix. Notice the short, pointed muzzle and round topkull. Cute, but no aussie."
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,tintedrosie,-2,Sun Jul 5 03:14:46 2015 UTC,"Well. That's impossible because I have seen both parents, and the dad is the same dad to our other Aussie."
WiggleButts,3c3rbc,N_Fox14,7,Sun Jul 5 03:37:27 2015 UTC,"Well your other dog has an alarmingly incorrect head, so that's not really saying much. Again, your dog is beyond cute, but it's incredibly off standard and quite likely a mix."
WiggleButts,3c41ve,FinleyButts,3,Sat Jul 4 15:55:14 2015 UTC,He is SO handsome!!
WiggleButts,3c41ve,Maddsie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:24:09 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! He's a great boy! :)
