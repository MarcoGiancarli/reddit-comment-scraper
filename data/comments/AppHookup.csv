AppHookup,3e4oxv,firstclassshitposter,0,Tue Jul 21 23:03:06 2015 UTC,"This game is a story about a Viking. His name is Bardi, which is slang for Scandinavian – “gonna throw this axe at you!” And, really, Bardi is the best axe thrower.   He lived a quiet life at the very edge of a forest, pastured sheep and didn’t bother anyone until the Romans appeared. Where did they come from? Why? We don’t know it yet, but obviously, this Viking did something so that they aim at ruining his hut not leaving even a stone of it. And this is when we need Bardi’s talent. It’s time to show these invaders who the leader is! It’s to do something that he is great at – throw the axe and do it as hard as possible!   Play for Bardi the Viking! Throw his axes at the enemies defending the house, save the sheep who don’t manage to reach the house; gain stars and spend them on improving Bardi’s abilities, improving his hut and developing new anilities!

AppHookup,3e19nq,shamnas-k,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:19 2015 UTC,I don't create video hardly ever (it's one of those deals where if I wasn't using this I'd be using the stock camera app) but I like this app.
AppHookup,3dzlj6,ScientificMK,11,Mon Jul 20 20:33:15 2015 UTC,"Since the cost for developing the app has been recently recovered, we decided to make it freely available for everyone to learn to design structures! Hope you enjoy it!"
AppHookup,3dzlj6,Unequaldata,4,Mon Jul 20 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"It's quite entertaining, the only issue I see from the little time I've played is the challenges arn't really explained."
AppHookup,3dzlj6,webmonkey1,5,Mon Jul 20 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"The goal, given the supports and a load for each challenge, is to build a structure to hold the load. If you do it, you will pass the challenge. Now, you can pass a challenge with better or worse designs. The score is such that the lighter your structure the higher your score. The problem is that light structures tend to break;)  From the ""breaking"" perspective, bars under tension (red) tend to behave stronger than those under compression (blue). Use the colors as a guide to understand how your design is working. There are some videos online teaching structures using Truss Me, you can use those, too.  It is possible (though very hard) to get 3 golden nuts at every challenge. Le me know if you have more questions. Enjoy!

AppHookup,3dz6h1,svesil,9,Mon Jul 20 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, because:   It filters ""promoted tweets"" (i.e. ads) from your stream It allows you to be logged in with multiple accounts at once It allows you to have multiple panels open at once, to follow a specific hashtag, search, list, or trending topic It syncs your timeline with the iOS app, so you can pick up browsing on your phone when you leave your computer, and vice-versa It allows very fine-grained muting of individuals, words, or hashtags The UI is much better than the Twitter.com website's"

AppHookup,3dz6h1,MatmosOfSogo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:40 2015 UTC,I bought Tweetbot way back and used it for years and loved it. The official Twitter app has had amazing upgrades last couple of years tho and I prefer that now. Amazing interface and it does everything I want. I used tweetbot alot because it was supereasy to translate tweets(amongst other things) but you can do that in the official app easy now aswell. Don't see any more advantages in Tweetbot to be honest.

AppHookup,3dz6h1,CapybarbarBinks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:46 2015 UTC,Can Tweetbot retrieve tweets up to weeks?? The official client would cut off the tweets if it already loaded lots of tweets.
AppHookup,3dz6h1,iqandjoke,4,Tue Jul 21 10:56:07 2015 UTC,"My main reason is that it syncs my timeline position across my iPhone, iPad, home Mac and work Mac. I use Twitter as a sort of RSS replacement so having to find where I left off would be a chore."
AppHookup,3dz6h1,panserbj0rne,4,Mon Jul 20 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"Heads-up: Tapbots has been notoriously slow with their app updates. They've spent the last 1½ years working on an iOS 7 update for the iPad version of Tweetbot, and had gone on a similarly long hiatus without updating Tweetbot for Mac until just this past month with the release of Tweetbot 2.0.  I will grant that these are major updates, so the wait might be justified. This is just a friendly warning, if regular app updates matter to you."

Very powerful and lots of fonts to choose from. The UI is a bit clunky and the quick-edit or ""randomize"" buttons are easily mistaken as shortcut buttons, which altered a demo I was fiddling with.  Other than that, great app!"
AppHookup,3dfi9l,klovd,3,Thu Jul 16 05:37:45 2015 UTC,I'm going to give it a whirl based on that. I've never like Over's UI

They informed us the app had been chosen and mentioned the date it'd be available. It just gives the game some promotion. You'd need some kind of iap or ads to monetize.

About a year ago, I decided to follow /r/theXeffect and do 1 hour of Android development a day to learn how to make Android apps and to prepare for my college major switch to Computer Science. You can find my original post about the app here. It's a bit long but I promise it's a good read :)  Over the last few months, the app has gotten very big and I've been working very hard to improve it and listen to my users! I just released a new update that adds tons of features.  Features   The ability to track your habits one day at a time Set reasons for each habit and why you're doing them See detailed statistics about each habit and your progress I really focused on Material design, so a clean and minimalistic Material Design interface 2 fully functional homescreen widgets The ability to add unlimited alarms for each habit with your own personal message Notes for each day 15 color themes   and much more!  Send me your feedback  I love to improve the app, so send me an email with any feedback, suggestions, ideas or even just to say hi to ryan.brooks@7weeksapp.com. I make sure to reply to all my emails so you'll hear back from me!  And I'm also currently adding translations, so if you're wanting to see the app in your native language and want to help out, let me know!"

AppHookup,3cxjz7,GhettoFob,10,Sun Jul 12 01:31:04 2015 UTC,Imo the best reddit client out there. Just bought pro (I was about to purchase it from $3.99) without thinking twice.
AppHookup,3cxjz7,Sv651,12,Sat Jul 11 20:50:33 2015 UTC,Just bought it. Seems much faster than Alien Blue.

AppHookup,3cxjz7,azhaan123,2,Sun Jul 12 05:13:55 2015 UTC,I'm trying AMRC right now.   I do like the swipe navigation. Much easier than AB.   I don't see an option to view my submitted posts and comments.   I also like AB's fast account switch option. I'd rather not have to type in the secondary account name every single time I want to switch as it is quite annoying to type (especially on a touch keyboard).   EDIT: Looks like everything I wanted wanted became available after I purchased the upgrade.

AppHookup,3cxjz7,WhatsUpBras,2,Mon Jul 13 00:46:09 2015 UTC,Holy moly I love this reddit app. Bye bye alien blue! It's super speedy and doesn't reload everytime you go back to it like it does in alien blue. UI isn't too bad either.
AppHookup,3cxjz7,mdinh013,4,Sun Jul 12 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you, have been looking for an alien blue alternative.  Liked AMRC but too many features where pro only.  $1 is perfect price to buy and try it out."
AppHookup,3cxjz7,WhatsUpBras,4,Sun Jul 12 03:14:30 2015 UTC,Thanks!! I've been waiting for this. $4 was too much for me to spend when Bacon Reader was a good alternative.
AppHookup,3cxjz7,mdinh013,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:14:01 2015 UTC,"Bacon Reader is the closest to AMRC in terms of ease of use and speed.  Bacon Reader also has built in posting to imgur like AMRC. I was beta testing Bacon Reader and bought Pro so it was my go to app.  After using AMRC for a few minutes I immediately spent the $4 (happened to be literally 8 hours before the sale started which was really irritating) and I don't regret it one bit. On my iPhone 5 it is one of the snappiest apps. Account switching takes a second. The shortcut feature is so nice, I saved the top 6 subreddits I go to but saved them as NEW view so I can see the most updated comments without having to select NEW each time (this is a HUGE time saver)  After you change the font it really makes the app look a lot better especially in night / dark mode, however that being said there could be a lot more improvements made especially in making the comments look nicer. The feed with the large preview pictures is identical to Beam, looks just as nice to scroll thru r/all and see nice huge pictures/gifs without clicking the post.  The only thing that bothers me with AMRC is when you click a link it opens the page in a tiny box instead of full screen like in Bacon Reader. So far this is the only con I have. Maybe someone can tell me how to make the webpage bigger?"
AppHookup,3cxjz7,Reposium,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:57:06 2015 UTC,"Weird. My shortcuts don’t seem to keep the sorting method that I choose. I also want them sorted at new, but they always default to Hot."

I tried AMRC out before and didn't really like it, but for 99¢ to unlock all the features it was a steal. One thing I will say is it's very fast. I am one of the few people who loves almost everything about Rhombus, but the creator went MIA a long time ago so I don't think it will ever be updated. Sad too because if outside links loaded faster and gfycat links auto selected / played on HTML5 it would be the perfect Reddit client to me."

It gets maybe one update a year and the latest ""improvement"" did nothing to fix the bugs and added ads into the article stream and user tracking. Since Reddit acquired AB, I have little hope for any improvement. I've had AMRC on my iPad for a few years and try it every so often but I keep going back to AB because of the UI."

The icon can use some work too. With a little polish and some iOS 8 design choices, this will be my go to reddit app. It reminds me of my old Nokia phone with the Symbian OS.  I'll keep using it for the next few days, but I can see myself going back to AlienBlue just because of the UI."

AppHookup,3cxjz7,primase,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"This is easily one of the best reddit clients on iOS, and for me, it's definitely the best. And I've tried quite a few. The pro upgrade is basically mandatory, though, because the default font and font size are awful. And it's not that pretty indeed, but it's fast, works flawlessly and it's so intuitive after a short while that you'll wish every app worked like amrc. I also think that the developer is working on an upgraded look and feel. He's always working to improve the app and he also is around on/r/amrc, listening to bug reports and feature wishes!

AppHookup,3c55wv,zaphodbeebIebrox,2,Mon Jul 6 22:51:25 2015 UTC,"All content can be unlocked for $2.99. None if it is essential for the enjoyment of the app, so it's not like one needs to purchase it in order to feel like you're getting a worthy experience from the app. Without any IAPs, the app is a wonderfully amazing app to give an awesome guide towards stargazing.  But on the other hand, the info in the IAPs are for users who want to use the app more than for just casual stargazing. It gives access to tons of info about things that you are less likely to notice or care about unless you're passionate about into looking at the sky or are planning to use a telescope. For that type of information, for those who would use it, I don't really see the issue with an additional $2.99 fee. I don't see what's really unreasonable about that price point."

AppHookup,3bwb3q,TheDeLurker,5,Thu Jul 2 23:41:00 2015 UTC,Did you click the link? It's a free game code from IGN; it's not free on the App Store.

AppHookup,3bwb3q,yufeiying,-4,Fri Jul 3 04:55:48 2015 UTC,Lol! This is hilarious.
AppHookup,3bw8sb,n3tw0rkm3,3,Thu Jul 2 17:45:02 2015 UTC,This is going to be useful. Just have to wear my Apple watch on my left hand so it wont get damaged when sliding haha
AppHookup,3bw8sb,4moa,2,Thu Jul 2 19:20:42 2015 UTC,"I saw this on Product Hunt, it looks like it would be really useful."
AppHookup,3bw8sb,fbara,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:14:13 2015 UTC,Thanks guys for the comments.  There are a few more free promo codes to get Batting Average at http://codehookup.com/93e0a37a
AppHookup,3bwu2u,NightlyRutine,4,Thu Jul 2 20:22:22 2015 UTC,Dammit people really need to find a shard of courtesy in themselves to comment what they've taken. Tried all the ones that weren't taken (in the comments ) but to no avail. Pm me please if you happen to have more.
AppHookup,3bwu2u,Somekindofclevername,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:22:18 2015 UTC,I actually took the effort of making an account. So hi I'm new here lol.
AppHookup,3bwu2u,portnux,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:50:00 2015 UTC,Are these codes for the first ~10 levels or the full game?
AppHookup,3bwu2u,Sabapalekar,2,Thu Jul 2 20:24:33 2015 UTC,First 10 levels + Ida's Dream... Forgotten shores will be an in-app for $1.99
AppHookup,3bwu2u,portnux,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks, I have it. Great game though."
AppHookup,3bwu2u,AliveThrouDeath,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:52:46 2015 UTC,"Which is technically the full game, with Forgotten Shores being DLC. Ida's Dream was also originally DLC, but then was rolled into the main game in the latest update."
