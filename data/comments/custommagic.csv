So I think Sorin is the only option for the WB slot.  Garruk as GB seems fine to me, except as far as I know, no one knows where he's from. So making cards from his home plane would be impossible unless you just decide to make a non-canonical storyline choice.   Vraska exists as an option for GB, but she's from Ravnica, which gives her a shared plane with Ral. That would suck, but Ral isn't the only RU planeswalker himself. There's also Dack from Fiora.

custommagic,3e3ezy,Zervintz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"The really like the archetype/mechanic. I'm mainly going to comment on the power level of some of these cards.  Axefury Battlerager seems just a tad weak. I know it's a common, but a 2/2 for 1RR with conditional double strike feels kinda meh. Buffing it to a 2/3 doesn't feel right either. I know it's a small change, but perhaps you could cost it at 2R instead? This is probably just me being nitpicky though.  Blessed by Nature seems pretty good. It may be a little too strong depending on how many sac outlets and/or token creatures are in your set. Two lands on turn 2 or 3 even with condition is quite good. It also depends on how many non-destroy creature removal and/or enchantment hating effects are present in the set.  Burning Pit is very powerful. It's basically a 2 mana wincon for dredge decks, and even in Modern burn because of fetch lands and things like [[Shard Volley]]. Perhaps Half of X might be more appropriate at 2 CMC. I know this set technically exists in a vacuum, but IMO it's always nice to make cards that could potentially see print.  Raw Power is a little confusing to me. Are you supposed to scry 1 no matter what, or only if the creature is energized? I would perhaps word it: ""Target creature gets +2/+0 until end of turn. Scry 1. If that creature is energized, it gets +4/+0 until end of turn instead."" I'm not quite sure if that's right, but as is it's a little confusing to me. I could just be dense though. =P  Everything else seems pretty good. The one last comment I will make is that you don't seem to have to new font for the new card frame. I don't remember the name of the font, but if you troll around the MSE page you'll be able to find it. IIRC, all you have to do is download the font to your computer and the card frame will automatically update assuming you haven't tampered with them."

Maybe I'll put X, but that would be a lot of text in a common...  Raw Power: Your wording is better than mine. I changed it !  Thank you for the feedback !! :)  Edit: For the font thing, I went to MSE site and it was on maintenance. I'll get is as soon as I can though."

The wording on this one sounds weird no matter how I word it -- is the gaining life necessary since you're able to have a tri-color land enter untapped?  Earth Colossus   As long as Earth Colossus has a prep counter on it, it attacks each turn if able.   Errthax, the Shadow Dancer   Planeswalker -- Errthax (or at the very least, something non-Demon; otherwise you end up with potential tribal confusion)      Draw a card. You lose life equal to half the number of loyalty counters on Errthax, rounded up.        Put an X/X black? Demon creature token with flying onto the battlefield. You gain X life.   Chaotic Search   Destroy target creature. That creature's controller may sacrifice a land to counter this effect.   Lavaborn Brute   Creature -- Ape Demon   Mask of Unholy Presence  I'm not entirely sure, but I think they've done away with Intimidate in favor of Menace. Also, living weapon probably needs its reminder text.  Vampiric Demon  (Not a Vampire Demon?)   Exile two creature cards from your graveyard: ...   Barbaric Fury   Target creature gets +4/+0 and gains haste, trample, and ""Whenever a source would deal damage to this creature, it deals twice that much damage instead."" until end of turn.   I'm not hugely picky about the power level of cards, but this seems insanely strong. Essentially, its 4 damage for 1 mana. The ""deals double damage"" drawback isn't nearly enough to balance it."

custommagic,3e12tr,MTGCardFetcher,2,Tue Jul 21 06:17:04 2015 UTC,"Ultimate Sacrifice should be worded:   Move all counters from target permanent you control onto another target permanent you control.   See [[Bioshift]].   The render makes the frame look black. I actually didn't notice this was a UG card (thought it was BG) until I went through the album again. maybe just my screen?    Clockworking is strictly better than an existing card. That's not a good thing.    Repurpose the Enemy is probably a pretty reasonable mana cost, but it doesn't really feel blue to me at all. Putting creatures from opponents' graveyards onto the battlefield under your control is pretty squarely black.  I don't think blue gets this for planeswalkers, that's just ""something new? give it to blue!"" syndrome.    Unify the Ranks: see [[Growing Ranks]] (4 mana and a card) and [[Intangible Virtue]] (2 mana and a card). This is probably undercosted, but it could very well end up being perfectly fine at 4 mana. But it definitely doesn't feel black.     Nightmarish End: Trostani's Judgment costs 6 mana, but black is definitely allowed more efficient removal than white, and this is destruction instead of exile, and sorcery-speed. Seems balanced. Wouldn't want it below 5 mana.    Back to Back Defense feels very strong. You block your opponent's 4/4 with two 2/2s and instead of trading two creatures for one, you just outright kill their dude.   If the format is slow, this is a great card to allow aggressive RW to go into the lategame more effectively. If the format is fast, it's probably unplayable.     Rediscover the Lost: Restore isn't overpowered. Not everything has to be multicolour.    Battle of Last Resort feels kind of clunky. I'll hand it to you that the only reason for this is probably that the rest of the cards don't!   Maybe just do ""{G}, Sacrifice a land: Put a 2/2 green elemental creature token onto the battlefield."", or add a mana cost to the last ability? The last ability feels quite easy to miss, and you'll notice that Wizards often tries to make the abilities on these cards either all have mana costs or none of them do, for aethestic reasons.    Conspiratorial Plot: This card is a UB Reach Through Mists in limited unless you draft a Planeswalker, and rewarding people for drafting the best bombs in the game is probably unnecessary.     Subvert Plans: This is a total bummer of a card to hit you in limited. It's like ""oh, well I guess I concede now because my entire strategy rested on my graveyard and now I don't have one. GG"". At least with most graveyard hate it isn't maindeckable (in limited), while I feel like this probably is.    Consolidate Power: 1BB to make someone lose 4 life is pretty good already.     Thoughtseize is Thoughtseize.     Tezzeret's Inner Sanctum feels like it could potentially support an artifact deck in a standard environments with some good artifacts. It also feels like it could do something very, very broken if given the right chance. Fill your deck with 1 mana and zero-mana artifacts.   Oh and with Shriekhorn and Altar of the Brood, churning through your library with this will allow you to probably just mill your opponent out of the game. With Springleaf Drum, Mox Opal, etc. you can start generating mana, and you can go infinite with Tel-Jilad Stylus.   This card has made my inner Johnny go ""oh my god"" and I fucking love it. This is like Etherium Sculptor and Vedalken Archmage in one. I LOVE ARTIFACTS."

Most cards are strictly better than another card in magic, and as I pointed out I don't think Steady Progress was designed correctly, out of fear.   Repurpose the Enemy is probably a pretty reasonable mana cost, but it doesn't really feel blue to me at all.   This is probably more of a flavor syndrome to me, as Bolas did more than just rebuild his body, we tampered with his mind and basically enslaved him. Will probably just make it mono-black when I update these again :)   This is probably undercosted, but it could very well end up being perfectly fine at 4 mana. But it definitely doesn't feel black.   I'm actually moving Proliferate into White/Black for this set, since they are the premier token producers, and I think it fits the mechanical heart of them quite well. Populate is much less strong in this pairing since they get much smaller tokens, but it might be overpowered still.   Back to Back Defense feels very strong. You block your opponent's 4/4 with two 2/2s and instead of trading two creatures for one, you just outright kill their dude. If the format is slow, this is a great card to allow aggressive RW to go into the lategame more effectively. If the format is fast, it's probably unplayable.   Yep, this is a card to allow them to go into the late game if needed. The opponent shouldn't be surprised, at least, since they see the enchantment is out before attacking. Combat tricks are still on the table to screw it up however, like killing a blocker in response to declaration, so it felt like it created interesting math-y mind game situations :)   Rediscover the Lost: Restore isn't overpowered. Not everything has to be multicolour.   Is Restore not overpowered? It isn't for Legacy, but I was worried that Modern wouldn't approve of the new addition.   Conspiratorial Plot: This card is a UB Reach Through Mists in limited unless you draft a Planeswalker, and rewarding people for drafting the best bombs in the game is probably unnecessary.   This is for a planeswalker-themed set, and I think it's a card that should exist anyway in some form. UB is the proliferate-control pairing, and I wanted to give them something that could help. Of course, I may also just want it for my modern TezzAoB deck...   Subvert Plans: This is a total bummer of a card to hit you in limited. It's like ""oh, well I guess I concede now because my entire strategy rested on my graveyard and now I don't have one. GG"". At least with most graveyard hate it isn't maindeckable (in limited), while I feel like this probably is.   This only removes non-creature cards, so it doesn't hate on most graveyard strategies since they revolve around the creatures. This is specifically to attack Flashback and weaken Delve, an answer which I believe Modern needs anyway with the current meta. But Flashback and Delve are in my limited environment as well :)   Consolidate Power: 1BB to make someone lose 4 life is pretty good already.   [[Bump in the Night]] and [[Syphon Life]] are probably the best cards to compare to, and they both are much stronger at what they do. Again, it is a planeswalker-themed set, so I wanted some removal, and I think it captures the flavor well.   Tezzeret's Inner Sanctum feels like it could potentially support an artifact deck in a standard environments with some good artifacts. It also feels like it could do something very, very broken if given the right chance. Fill your deck with 1 mana and zero-mana artifacts.   I was considering adding a 'once per turn' clause if it felt too breakable. Do you think that would be too much watering down?  I also love artifacts, TezzAoB all the way!"

I think I like the ""if"" version better; the interaction with Maze seems hard enough that it wouldn't be too strong.  Another way to do it would be to use X.   Whenever ~ attacks, you may destroy target permanent with converted mana cost X, where X is the number of creatures that attacked this turn. *   * i.e. ""were declared as attackers in the declare attackers step"" This does an end-run around ""change the number of attacking creatures to counter the effect"" and it also disallows it from ever hitting 0-CMC permanents.

However, they are undercosted, because vector is a two-P/T swing in your favor. Graft is a net 0-P/T swing in your favor.  Other options: let them have +1/+1 counters and have them turn into -1/-1 counters as they pass over; have your vector creature get a small buff while it retains its counters; have them give all creatures with -1/-1 counters some ability (though this verges on mirror match issues)."

Have two mechanics.   Creature V1  Vector 1 (This creature enters the battlefield with one -1/-1 counter on it. Whenever another creature enters the battlefield, you may move a -1/-1 counter from this creature onto it.)      Creature V2  Agitated -- As long as ~ has at least one -1/-1 counter on it, it has deathtouch.      Legendary Creature V3  Vector 3 (This creature enters the battlefield with three -1/-1 counters on it. Whenever another creature enters the battlefield, you may move a -1/-1 counter from this creature onto it.)  Agitated -- Whenever a creature deals combat damage to you, destroy it if there is at least one -1/-1 counter on ~.   This way, your Vector creatures could just be used to weaken/kill opponent creatures, sure. But they could also be used to strengthen your own through Agitate. It adds an extra layer."

In general, -1/-1 counters might not appear as often as +1/+1 counters, but they're in Shadowmoor/Eventide and Scars of Mirrodin blocks.  They can be done in a way that isn't parasitic.  For example:   Example - 2B  Creature - Insect  Vector 1 (This enters the battlefield with a -1/-1 counter on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, you may move a counter from this to another target permanent).  ~ has deathtouch as long as ~ has a -1/-1 counter on it.  2/2   This card is clearly could easily go in a deck that doesn't care about -1/-1 counters, though it might be better in one that does.

The Fonts either affected life totals or the hand, and the closest a Font got to affecting the board was [[Font of Fertility]]. So, Reserve was created to answer questions like, ""how can I split the cost of [[Rebuke]] without discouraging attacking?""

You can't cast Fact of Fiction in any modern format, because while people will try to say it's too good, it's not. It's not too good at all. It's just too hard. Wizards know that it will see play in Standard but they don't want newer players to have to deal with that level of decision making difficulty.

I costed each hard casting cost 1 more than the mana cost of its ""normal"" counterpart, like Meteorshot (second card in album) costs 1 more than Lightning Strike. For Meteorshot, the sum of the reserve cost and 3 is 3R, which is 1 more than its hard casting cost. I used this method for each card, but I'm not sure if its good.   Like ""Lost in the Mists"" is so much worse than Fog   Lost in the Mists is conditionally better than Fog if you control Vanilla creatures.

Meditating Monk enters the battlefield with a ki counter on it.  Creatures with ki counters on them have meditating. (Reminder text.)

That's assuming they have the mana up and a creature available, otherwise it's 5 damage and they have to leave up mana the next turn if they want to block, and maybe you don't even attack with it, or even cast a spell in your first main and force your opponent to either respond or block, but not allow both. You have to keep in mind, as well, that I could attack with this guy, let you pay 3, then remove your only blocker so you've paid 3 for nothing.  There are any number of scenarios where this is potentially better than any other seven-drop in MtG. Opponent at 5 or less life tap out to cast a bomby six-drop? Opponent clears the board on their turn, confident the top card of your deck isn't going to threaten 10 damage if they can't drop a creature cheap enough for them to pay 3 and block? I could keep going but I hope you've gotten my point.  TL;DR: Don't cast this card if it will obviously be blocked and you don't have a plan for that."
custommagic,3dw1zt,Badfiend,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:09:28 2015 UTC,"I get the idea, but the fact by turn 7 most opponents will have played most of their hand already. An aggro, midrange, or ramp deck will have played most of their hand, and even a control deck will want to have 3 mana open for a counter. It's an interesting mechanic but it needs to be on a cheaper body."

Also,   a control deck will want to have 3 mana open for a counter.   The card is likely designed for limited, as it's an uncommon, and a hard counter is a pretty good answer to just about any card, not just this one, and also not near as common in limited as it is in constructed formats."

It's like saying [[feral lightning]] is an awful card because your opponent can just block all your 3/1s with 1/1s and you spent 6 mana to kill a bunch of 1/1s. Sure there exist board states where you the card is less than ideal, but you can't use the worst case as evidence that the design is flawed. Hell, Icefall Regent is pretty bad if your opponent doesn't have any creatures, but that doesn't mean the design is flawed or the card is bad in general."

It's likely designed for limited (man am I tired of repeating myself) and in limited especially, but in other formats as well, your statement is blatantly false. There are any number of reasons you might not have 3 mana up and a blocker (one you don't mind losing)  by the time your opponent hits 7 mana. Ramp, mana screw, a wonky mana curve, just plain bad luck. I'm seriously beginning to question how qualified many of the users of this sub are to be evaluating cards. I've said most of this already, but on turn six it's not insane to imagine spending 4+ mana, or not having something you can afford to lose on the field, not to mention the possibility of end of turn removal from your opponent to clear the way.  No, the card isn't the best 7 drop ever designed, but then it's an uncommon. My point is that you can't boil the card down to the obvious and correctly evaluate it. Board states are erratic and fluid, and the average is not so much more common than the unusual.  Also Rifter irritated me by downvoting on this sub."

All five types appear across the colors, but hte main reason they have to be in these combinations is that the five main color archetypes are WUG, WBR, WBG, UBR, and URG, and each of these creatures can be played in any of the different color trios.  And Spirits are already heavily associated with the WBG colors, so I wanted to leave the Spirit lord with those.  I felt RG fit for the type of creature I wanted shades to be in this set, a mystic, almost animalistic creatures that've had their mind and body weathered away until they're just a collection of base emotions.

One last thing, the Rapture mechanic is interesting, but it seems like it might be a bit challenging if there aren't enchantment creatures or something other than a bunch of world enchants.

The most comparable are [[Sentinels of Glen Elendra]] and [[Nephalia Seakite]]. Their costs are the exact same, and they have no other abilities besides flash and flying. They're both 2/3. Commons.  [[Restoration Angel]] is a 3/4 for a comparable cost in white, and it has a beneficial (and quite abuse-able) ETB as well. It's a rare, though.  There's [[Mistbind Clique]].

I don't understand it thematically -- I typically think of a moss sticking around for a long time (though I honestly know nothing about plants, so I could be wrong.)  I don't know if it's really playable though. Being able to play two drops on turn one is nifty, but I'd rather play something that has the chance of sticking on the field for a while and helping out through more than just the first turn.  Incidentally, if a 0/0 enters the battlefield, it dies to state-based effects before it ever gets the +0/+1 from the trigger. You might say it like this instead:   New Growth 0  Creature -- Plant/Fungus (unless you have a Moss subtheme)  New Growth is green.  Flash, haste  At the beginning of your end step, put a -1/-1 counter on New Growth.  T: Add G to your mana pool.  0/1   Edit: Alternatively, you could just take out the +0/+1 or -1/-1 counter entirely. Make it completely unplayable without a lord or anthem effect, such as a creature that says green creatures you control get +1/+1. That makes it interesting, similar to [[Force of Savagery]]."

The idea is sort of, you play a forest and it is all fresh, and then the moss grows in all over every tree and rock.  Im sad that it insta dies, I had ideas for like a counter on it that you have to remove at your end step, and then it dies, or some sort of sacrifice clause, but I also want you to be able to perma buff it and have it live, so the -1-1 counters dont really work for me either.  I kind of like the idea of having it only live if there is an anthem effect. Moss needs an established area to grow onto stuff right?  So  New Growth (0)  Creature-Moss  Neew Growth is Green.  Flash, Haste  T: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.  0/0  So then is it too powerful being able to produce a mana of any color?"

New Growth gets -0/-1 until end of turn.  0/1   So he enters as a 0/1 and becomes a 0/2. Then you use his ability and he's a 0/1. But next turn, he's a 0/1 and if you use his ability again, he dies. A perma-buff like a lord/anthem or a +1/+1 counter would make him stick around, though.  Edit:   I kind of like the idea of having it only live if there is an anthem effect. Moss needs an established area to grow onto stuff right? So then is it too powerful being able to produce a mana of any color?   Not at all. If it's a mana dork that you can't play for a couple turns until you get an anthem out, I don't think there's any reason it can't produce any color. Hell, you could even go as far as to make it say that ""Lands you control have T: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool."", similar to [[Joiner Adept]]. The 0/0 would be a major drawback... and if the moss is ""growing over"" all of your lands, that would show it thematically."
custommagic,3dv05f,LethalPigeon7,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"1)Hm, the wording you posted is definitely the closest to a working version of the original idea, assuming the buff is removed. Aside from the ability to stay for as long as you dont use it ofc. 2) The thought of it producing mana for 2 turns instead of 1 without any help, aka actually keeping the buff, is an interesting idea. I feel like a counterable, slightly-more-buff-abusable [[Elvish Spirit Guide]] is strong enough though. 3) If the other version were to be printed, I feel like it'd have to be eternal-only, where it would get abused(?).

If they absolutely have to be taken from the battlefield, then The Marker should destroy them first, then return them from the graveyard as Zombies, I'd think.  Songbird seems interesting. Not bad. It shouldn't have trample and flying innately if that's the effect of its soulbond ability. All previous soulbonds only get their abilities if they're bonded.   Cobb's Totem is nice.

These cost the same as Darksteel Plate and have two additional bonuses that can be really game-breaking.  Balance-wise, Shield of Brilliance really kind of sucks compared to the rest. Hexproof-red doesn't really do all that much, since the majority of red spells interact with destruction anyway.  Flavor-wise, Shield of Ruin is weird, since it grants hexproof-white, but the second ability works best with vigilance, which is primarily white. Also, it's a bit spotty whether this is supposed to be a one-color cycle or a two-color cycle.    Shield of Brilliance is clearly WU Shield of Valor seems mono-G, with slight W undertones. Shield of Oppression is clearly U. We might get a stretch of it being B too, but weakly. Shield of Ruin is clearly R. It might be BR because of how aggressive it is, but really loses out because it is really defensive too. It doesn't really fit B well either.

I feel like it needs to have more of a cost than just tapping, even if it's small. Pay BB or sacrifice a creature or exile a couple cards from your graveyard or pay some life or something...  You could make it a 0/0 creature that enters with two +1/+1 counters on it, and as a cost to activate its ability you have to remove a counter.

I am by no mean a rules expert, so  I'm inclined to believe you are correct."
custommagic,3dt3v4,Frogmitt,3,Sun Jul 19 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"Well the first more obvious thing, you can't just ""deal 5 damage"". The damage has to have a source, so you'd want to say ""Backhand deals 5 damage...""   Secondly, as is written (which may have been intentional, but usually a spell like this wouldn't branch), you can shuffle a spell I've cast into my library while you target a third player for the 5 damage. Shuffling the spell first, then referencing its owner, lets you be sure that the 5 damage is going to the face of whomever's spell you just decided wasn't allowed.  And I included the ""counter"" bit because without countering the spell, Backhand will shuffle the card into its owner's library, but the spell's effect will still resolve. It'd be like me activating a creature's ability, then you killing the creature -- the ability will still resolve as long as there's a valid target, etc.  After looking at other similar cards such as [[Remand]] and [[Spell Crumple]], and [[Essence Backlash]] and [[Mindswipe]], I realize that it probably needs the extra ""If a spell is countered this way, its owner shuffles it into his or her library instead of putting it into his or her graveyard.""

custommagic,3drbef,A7AXgeneration,2,Sat Jul 18 22:13:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're putting a little too much value on the Conjure mechanic. I will elaborate by going through every one of those cards in the album (I'm really bored XD):  Brew: Bad. It's like a cantrip, except your opponent chooses what you get, which will most likely be exactly what you don't want.  Deathless Druid: I like it. When it dies, if nothing else is in the yard, you get it back. Pretty good limited card.  Druid's Cache: I think it's neet. It's kind of hard to elaborate on this card though. Very situational.  Envoy of Ancients: BAD. A bear with two different mana symbols warrants some kind of ability, and the ""Tap three creatures"" for conjuring seems AWFUL for the cost.  Evermist Enchantress: I don't think this would work unless you have a strong enchantment theme in your set. with a cmc of 4 at rare it seems underpowered.   Evermist Sprite: 's Good. Very simple, and works on it's own.  Forgotten Alchemy: Maybe in commander, but I think it'd be relegated to the jank rare box.  Sacrament: I like Feed the Clan, so this seems like a decent reclaiming/life spell. I guess.  Spellbind: I likey. If you have 2 and nothing else in the yard/nothing better, then you get counters for days! Expensive, though, but a cool idea for casual.  Wish Thief: I think this mechanic is best when you conjure multiple times with one card. While this card can do that, it sadly suffers from the ""1/1 flyers tend to suck in limited"" rule (thopters don't count).  Wishing Tree: Interesting for a sacrifice deck. For 6 it's a little pricey, but I think it's ability justifies it. Commander for days.  Overall, I think the mechanic is a little too situational. You either want only good stuff in your yard, which is something you shouldn't want anyways, or only one thing so that your opponent has to give you value. Maybe this has a synergy with delve where you exile all your less powerful stuff and conjure back the good things that are left, but that's, again, very situational."
custommagic,3drbef,DarkariaX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"Bad cards do exist. And if you make a set where all of your cards are good, you're doing it wrong. I think they're fine.  The mechanic itself, I don't think is meant to be ""Conjure (Get what you want from your graveyard.)"". If that were the case, your opponent wouldn't choose, and it would be broken. It's not a bad mechanic. It offers card advantage, even if your opponent just returns your Evolving Wilds every time.   Would it see play in standard if this were an actual set? Probably not, maybe a couple of cards here and there. Spellbind in particular seems like it would be played solidly in a blue control deck, given that a mono-colored deck wouldn't have lands in the graveyard, so you'd be getting back some kind of counter or bounce or whatever. Something useful.   It's just as good as Delve or Cipher. Not nearly as terrible as Detain (I don't think I ever played against a single Detain card in standard...)"
custommagic,3drbef,Frogmitt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:40:13 2015 UTC,"It's not that the mechanic is bad thematically (although it kinda is), it's that it's just not that good, and WAY too situational. It's conditions of being good are a lot fewer and far between than Delve or Cipher.   Not saying it's unusable, I just think this creator shouldn't put so much value on it when deciding mana cost."
custommagic,3drbef,DarkariaX,2,Sun Jul 19 08:33:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all of the feedback everyone. I'm going to adjust some of the costs on these cards to help push their power level somewhat. This mechanic is one that only shows up on BLUE and GREEN cards in my set and represents ALCHEMISTS and DRUIDs. Hence, like guild mechanics its narrow and situational but pretty neat and on color.

VERY op in practice."
custommagic,3dqcfx,yumirose,13,Sat Jul 18 12:35:39 2015 UTC,"She's way too easy to ult and way too hard to kill. Her -3 ability might as well just be a 0 ability, or even a plus, because giving your creature lifelink means you're going to gain life when it attacks, which means you're putting more loyalty on her. And since that creature has vigilance, it can protect her too.  Her ultimate needs to be a lot higher, like -40 or something. In a good life gain deck, getting her to 15+ loyalty is easy, and white has plenty of fliers and evasion, and it's way too easy for white to make a little army."
custommagic,3dqcfx,Frogmitt,10,Sat Jul 18 13:12:49 2015 UTC,"The -3 acting as a plus ability is very intentional. It's a less reliable source of putting counters on her, and interacts with more things than her +2. I think it's correct power level-wise, too: compare to Sorin, Solemn Visitor's +1.   I think you're right about the -15. I'm thinking more in terms of Standard, where I wouldn't see her reaching 15 loyalty until after 4 or 5 turns, which is generally where planeswalker ults should hit. For commander purposes, maybe -25 is right.  But hey, if this card makes you worry about ""a good life gain deck"", then I think I've done something right."
custommagic,3dqcfx,BEALLOJO,3,Sat Jul 18 16:29:59 2015 UTC,"If anything that -3 is more reliable. If you're attacking with something that has lifelink, high powered first strikers and fogs notwithstanding, your creature is probably gonna connect with something, and that'll result in loyalty gain."
custommagic,3dqcfx,BEALLOJO,3,Sat Jul 18 22:23:35 2015 UTC,"Reliable doesn't necessary mean more powerful. Reliable just means that the set-up cost is significantly less; i.e.,  you need fewer things to make it good.  To see why this is the case, imagine if there wasn't that first clause there. If you have a creature with power X, here's what her loyalty abilities (basically) become:  +2: You gain 2 life.  +(X - 3): You gain X life. Target creature gains vigilance until end of turn.  Note that X - 3 is greater than 2 only when X is 6 or greater; i.e., to put more loyalty counters on her with her -3 than with her +2, you're going to need a creature with power 6 or greater.  Most of the time you're not, so then you have to play the game of how much is the vigilance worth, how much can you afford risking your creature in combat, etc."

custommagic,3dqcfx,MTGCardFetcher,2,Sat Jul 18 23:32:01 2015 UTC,"She does nothing the turn she comes in? I'm assuming that up until turn 5 when you cast her, you've been playing other cards. There are plenty of three-drop 3/X creatures in white. [[Flickerwisp]] in particular seems good. And if you played a turn-four [[Rhox Faithmender]], even better. Play this chick, -3 her targeting flickerwisp, swing for 3 lifelink in the air. Gain 6 life. She has 7 loyalty counters already.   Next turn, cast a [[Beacon of Immortality]]. Even if your life total was at 10 at this point, Beacon doubles it. Rhox Faithmender doubles the increase, so your life total is now 30, and she just gained 20 loyalty counters putting her at 27. So -15, and all of your creatures get +30/+30 until end of turn. Your Rhox Faithmender alone attacking as a 31/34 creature with lifelink, even if blocked, gains you 62 life, putting her at 89 loyalty counters.  And you can argue that that's a ""best case"" scenario, but [[Celestial Mantle]] also exists. So the turn after you play her, you put that on your Flickerwisp or any of the other cheaper white flyers you might be playing. Give it lifelink. You gain at least 4 life from lifelink, then double your life total (again, we will assume it was 10, now 14) to 28. She gains 14 counters.

You'll sacrifice the rest.  In either case, the wording is sufficiently ambiguous that it should be changed.  Case 1:   Each player counts the number of card types among permanents he or she controls, chooses that many permanents, then sacrifices the rest.   Case 2:   Each player chooses one permanent of each card type among permanents he or she controls, then sacrifices the rest.   I'm not sure if both of these need another ""he or she controls"" clause referring to the permanents they choose. On the other hand, feel free to choose permanents your opponent controls and then sacrifice all of your stuff, I dunno. It's not that important.  The thing is, though, the wording gets messy really fast."

custommagic,3dm748,phism,3,Fri Jul 17 13:22:36 2015 UTC,This card is particularly weak as it is. The symmetric part makes a 2 life cost literally nothing. No constructed format would want this. This is limited playable only and that is okay. It is a cool idea.

custommagic,3dnugm,Borg-Man,2,Fri Jul 17 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"That's fine, and I can see the frustration there.  But you didn't say that - at least to me, it appeared that you were implying MSE had problems, as did someone else over on /r/magictcg a few weeks back.  And honestly, it's tiresome.  Sourceforge provides me with free unlimited reliable hosting and has done nothing to compromise the safety of my downloads.  As far as I'm concerned, they're a-ok.  If I ever have even the slightest whiff of trouble with my project, I'll do what I have to to protect my downloaders.

custommagic,3dp4h1,pichoro,3,Sat Jul 18 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"Another thing - sourceforge didn't cause your computer to not start up.  Even if you picked up a piece of malware there, which didn't come in with MSE, the point of such malware isn't to destroy your computer, it is to advertise to you and generate advertising revenue.  It doesn't generate revenue if it kills your computer.  So the idea that the two would even be connected is quite ridiculous.  On top of that, if sourceforge is inserting malware, they're only doing it to big name projects.  Both MSE projects are small-fry next to things like Filezilla.  MSE isn't on their radar, I promise.  On a good week, both projects together might get a mere 5000 downloads.  Finally, even if they wanted to insert malware into either MSE project, I'm not convinced they could.  On my templates project, there are no EXE files up for download.  Since all of my files are mse-installers or zips, there's no way for them to slip malware onto your computer through them.  On the main MSE project, those installers haven't been updated since sometime in 2011 because Twan is gone and nobody knows how to build either MSE.exe or the installer with all the proper contents.  For sourceforge to be able to do all of this and get it right would be quite a feat.  Honestly, I don't get it.  Edited to fix ""their""."

True, the latter of these two effects are in red as well, but you could design this card this way and be perfectly justified."
custommagic,3dn298,Frogmitt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:38 2015 UTC,"A hasty 5/4 with menace or sac a creature. A little red, a little black, probably both. And given that the art supports the red/black/gold colors, I'd change its cost to something like 1RBB.   Also, I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, but typically when an effect removes a creature from combat, it also untaps it. Personally, I think it's better as it is, without untapping. I just wasn't sure if that was a fault or a feature."
custommagic,3dn298,Armond436,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:38 2015 UTC,"The choice to not untap it was intentional, because I figured that the defending player should have a break from having to deal with a 5/4 blocker.  Also, remember that its a just a 3/3 with haste as long as you control two or more creatures. It is a high-risk scenario: If you don't have a way to protect the Tiger, it dies to removal, and then you are left without a creature; If you play another creature, it becomes significantly weaker."

custommagic,3dn298,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:01:19 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest menace, but I see that it gains the ability solitary. I'd honestly just make it so it always has menace. It gives it a bit of a power boost, but the solitary ability reads cleaner that way and the card isn't particularly strong in the first place.  And two nitpicks: If you hit shift+return to create a new line, the spacing between the previous line and the one you just created is much, much smaller. You'll want to do that for the quote and the quote's ""credit text"" as seen in the flavor text of this Act of Treason.

My understanding of that statement is that you have to somehow activate or trigger a single ability that adds XXX to your mana pool, such as the ability from [[Mardu Warshrieker]].

The second set of abilities basically won't ever trigger right now because you have to add the mana all in one go. Instead, I think you want them to read ""Whenever you have {colors} in your mana pool, (effect)"" and limit how many times the ability can trigger per turn.  The first set of abilities should read ""Whenever you play a land..."".  Sultai Territory's first ability should read ""Wherever you play a land, look at the top card of your library. You may put it into your graveyard.""  Temur Territory's third ability should read ""Sacrifice a land: The next creature spell you cast this turn may be cast as though it had flash."""

Four mana instant that lets you cast any non-creature in your deck for free? In the same set as an 11 mana planeswalker that has four insane abilities? I don't think so :P  Goblin Bombardier - I know power creep is a thing, but you took [[Cunning Sparkmage]], made it cost one instead of three, and gave it +1/+1. You took [[Goblin Fireslinger]], gave him haste, let him hit creatures, and gave him +0/+1. That's a little much, even if you made it a rare. I'd recommend dropping haste and making him cost two, maybe make him a 2/2.  Chromatic Soarer - [[Birds of Paradise]] is already a top tier card, you don't need to break it in half any more. I'd recommend ""T: Clash with an opponent. If you win, add one mana of any color to your mana pool. Otherwise, add G to your mana pool.""  Mana Gnome - This is kinda nitpicky, but all colors shouldn't have access to a one mana dork.

custommagic,3dmzno,MTGCardFetcher,2,Sat Jul 18 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"For Nefarious Tutor, if you want to keep its cost and instant speediness, you could always just have it be ""name a card.

Bombardier is tough if you want to keep him a one drop. Compare him to [[Grim Lavamancer]], [[Fireslinger]], [[Spikeshot Elder]], and [[Razorfin Hunter]]. At cmc 2 pingers need drawbacks, at cmc 1 they need conditions. Off the top of my head, perhaps you could make him a 1/1 who can only ping if you control another Goblin; with a drawback like that, you might even be able to rationalize Haste.  You could also take him a more traditional Goblin pinger route based on [[Goblin Artillery]]. Make him a 0/1 with ping and haste, but make him deal 2 damage to you in order to ping (much like Fireslinger, but stronger with a harsher drawback). Also, I'd make him a Shaman."

Trample seems odd on such a small creature to begin with; perhaps make one ability greener and remove trample?  e.g. 1BG, T: Search your library or graveyard for a Knight card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.  then remove the second ability; such a blue ability doesn't belong on this Rock creature."

I for one strongly believe that Pirates should get more love. Up with Pirates (Up with Rogues too, but come on. He has Swashbuckler in the title).  Kud Sim Dar doesn't seen exciting as a potentially colorless card. There are not many nonblack skeletons  Encore is a very unred mechanic.

custommagic,3djmtu,IAMACasualRedditor,2,Thu Jul 16 21:21:49 2015 UTC,"You mean mixing the regular colorless mana symbols with the 2/X mana symbols?  Resilience 3 is only on the legendary. Anything else with resilience is most likely going to be 1, and weak as far as toughness goes.  I thought about doing Pirate as the blue creature type instead of Rogue, but I felt like the other Houses are all on the land, so a fleet of pirate ships in the water isn't going to pose too much of a threat. Also, finding art for pirates that isn't campy seemed like too much work. >.<  Kud makes the skeletons himself with his painswarm ability. In a white/red life gain/burn deck which can offer him protection, he can make a lot of the little guys pretty quick. Alternatively, if you're running a blue control shell and just need some chump blockers to stall...   I'm not familiar with any cards having ""whenever this card goes to the graveyard from anywhere, you can [do something to] return it to your hand."" So I'm not sure that encore is really ""fit"" for any color. But it doesn't offer a whole lot of card advantage. If you have [[Shock]] with encore RR, you're opting to pay three mana to deal 2 damage if you want to return it to your hand. So late game, sure you can reuse that shock to deal 6 damage for 9 mana if you choose to cast nothing else that turn.  The primary idea for red, however, is that it's going to have a lot of ""as an additional cost, discard..."" or effects that essentially self-mill. Also, encore would be exclusive to instants and sorceries with the exception of Elian. I could perhaps change that; it hadn't even occurred to me until now.

custommagic,3djmtu,Oddsbod,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I couldn't figure out the formatting on imgur, so I'll post the description for this here. Basically, I'm trying to create a pseudo-colorless set (colorless/color hybrid mana, few if any spells that require more than one colored mana, etc).   These legendary creatures represent the leaders of each of five noble Houses on the plane of Urghaven. Each House is represented by a color, a dominant creature type, and an exclusive mechanic.                      White: Knights, Resilience  Blue: Rogues, Loot  Black: Shaman, Painswarm  Red: Bard, Encore  Green: Scout, Landscouting  Urghaven is unfamiliar with the concept of magic as is understood by the majority of the multiverse. The Paladins of House Cinio receive blessings and boons from their yet-named god. The Rogues of House Tosier are able to manipulate enemies via charisma and trickery. The Blood Summoners of House Sim Dar derive their magical energy from their own flesh. The Bards of House Rewalt use music to sway (and burn) their foes. And the Scouts of House Strixeye use their knowledge and understanding of the lands to gain the upperhand in battle.  No one on this plane is familiar with the concept of mana or its colors. Moreover, no one on this plane is familiar with the concept of the multiverse. Until now.   The story begins with the arrival of a few familiar planeswalkers in Urghaven. Rumor has spread throughout the multiverse that there existed an isolated plane in which lay a powerful relic that could bestow the planeswalker spark upon anyone who held it. While certain nefarious planeswalkers wish to use this power for evil, other more honorable ones seek to protect it. And with the arrival of these planeswalkers in Urghaven comes the first major battle between the Houses in centuries -- a battle to seek out this ancient relic in order to become the greatest House in Urghaven."
custommagic,3djmtu,mellophone11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:23:29 2015 UTC,"I like that you're going for a Thran-type deal, with a plane that hasn't really grasped the magic and mana theory much of the rest of the multiverse has developed.  The twobrids show that off really well, with hte whole, they don't have to be color aligned, but they work best when they are.    Storywise, I'd recommend you give a look at Mirrodin, which was the last time we saw someone try to artificially obtain a Spark, and that wasn't even creating a spark, it was only transferring a spark from an unawoken walker to Memnarch.  That alone required the life energy of literally every living thing on Mirrodin to fuel the transfer.  Just to put into perspective how big of a deal it is to be artificially obtain a spark.    Who are the planeswalker characters?  I do agree with Casual Redditor, the twobrid mixing with normal mana looks a bit weird, but it's nothing as bad as you normally see when some people mix hybrids, especially with only two mana symbols on these guys.    Resilience already exists as Absorb.  Also, getting a major Elspeth-type feel from Kata Cinio, tired master-warrior who would really rather just rest and not deal with everyone demanding everything from her.    Kud Sim Dar is strong, sorta like a twist up of Bitterblossom, but I do object that, flavorwise, he seems no different from every other evil necromancer lord.  The numb-skin is an interesting little touch though.    Elian Rewalt is bonkers with just one lightning bolt.  Bolt, Elian, next turn bolt from the grave and an additional 2 damage from his ability, and the ability to do that over and over.  Encore isn't a very red ability either, it's much more green.    I like the emphasis on class over race in terms of tribal, it's interesting.  I feel like landscouting, outside of basic landscouting, has the same problem as landwalk and fear; it can be very, very situational depending on who you're playing, either bonkers against one deck and totally useless against another."

custommagic,3ditvg,Frogmitt,5,Thu Jul 16 16:56:03 2015 UTC,"It's fine as-is, and ""unless you've cast a creature spell this turn"" works as well.

If this is the intention (making it almost arbitrary, but perhaps sometimes useful), then that's great. If not, then maybe it can enter the battlefield tapped unless you control a green and a blue creature. Or a certain number of creatures.

I suggest just dropping the deathtouch since the idea behind the '100 duck sized horses vs 1 horse sized duck' debate is that all the tiny horses are individually quite weak, and deathtouch moves this further from the original inspiration.  Another thing: costing 6 this is way over the top. Each individual effect is too powerful for 6 mana and when a spell gives you the flexibility to choose between multiple things, the spell should cost more than the individual choices. I suggest, for balance and elegance, to make the spell cost 9 cmc, and only produce 9 horses."

That said, I do think it's a really great mechanic. It brings a whole other level of complexity and strategy to combat that I haven't seen. (You might choose to attack with creatures you wouldn't normally attack with just so that you have a chump blocker for a large dreamwalk creature.)"
custommagic,3dfyfx,thirteenthfox,12,Wed Jul 15 23:34:17 2015 UTC,hmmmm combos seems too easy with it... [[blightsteel colossus]] into [[cloudshift]] ?  It should cost more than 3 mana.  The flavor and the art is real though ! That jeskai monk in the shadow :3
custommagic,3dfyfx,Logue_Yne,10,Thu Jul 16 00:43:48 2015 UTC,Or even just getting a [[Phyrexian Dreadnought]].
custommagic,3dfyfx,ahalavais,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:33:52 2015 UTC,"Phyrexian Dreadnought - Gatherer, MC, ($) [[cardname]] to call - not on gatherer = not fetchable"
custommagic,3dfyfx,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:34:04 2015 UTC,My thoughts as well.
custommagic,3dfyfx,hossboyz,0,Thu Jul 16 16:24:30 2015 UTC,Command zone talks about manifesting a phyrexian dreadnought and thats when this popped into my head.
custommagic,3dfyfx,MTGCardFetcher,2,Thu Jul 16 06:14:04 2015 UTC,I don't think it should cost more because its an easily dealt with 2/2 turn 3 in modern a turn 2 15/15 in legacy which happens anyway. A turn 2-4 big guy in edh which happens sometimes.   Most tutor effects cost 2 or 3 to put something  in your hand  This costs 3 for a killable tutored card.

custommagic,3dfyfx,davidkrumz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:44:12 2015 UTC,"That's still a turn four win which isn't uncommon for modern    edit: also, if you can't remove a 2/2 by turn 3, what're ya doin'? Even tron can do that. That's saying something when they're only removal is Karn and [[Pyroclasm]]"
custommagic,3dfyfx,TheGuyInAShirtAndTie,3,Thu Jul 16 09:24:24 2015 UTC,"By design, I love this card! It's something I would love to throw in a custom card cube. It should  have some slight drawback (for costing 3cmc) though, to balance it. Maybe sacrifice a creature or pay 3 life."
custommagic,3dfyfx,CilantroGamer,5,Thu Jul 16 01:37:20 2015 UTC,"If paying 3 life balances this, yawgmoths bargin is fine."
custommagic,3dfyfx,radiocativek_tty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:16:05 2015 UTC,"The only thing I would add to this is having to reveal it before you manifest it. That being said, very cool idea."
custommagic,3dfyfx,klapaucius,22,Thu Jul 16 00:43:39 2015 UTC,I don't think revealing is necessary. The only reason you normally reveal is because you have to verify that what you're searching for is indeed the card type you're allowed to search for. It's fine as is.
custommagic,3dfyfx,radiocativek_tty,5,Thu Jul 16 00:54:59 2015 UTC,"The reveal isn't a rules-required one; it's to adjust the power level of the card, so your opponent has a better idea of what they're dealing with."
custommagic,3dfyfx,sturmeh,3,Thu Jul 16 01:58:32 2015 UTC,Are there any cards which tell you to reveal a card you search up to put in your hand where it doesn't ask for a specific kind of card?
custommagic,3dfyfx,Shvingy,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have precedent, no. This reveal would be in place of simply upping the cost of the card in order to make it balanced. Keep in mind this wasn't my idea; I was just clarifying it.  This is also an odd situation; you can tutor for any card, but unless you've got a bounce spell/ability, it essentially has to be a creature."
custommagic,3dfyfx,radiocativek_tty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:08:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think this ever happens, are there any examples?"
custommagic,3dfyfx,Shvingy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:51:00 2015 UTC,Reveal comes standard across card games that when you search your deck if its for a specific type of card you need to reveal it.  Imagine if you didn't have to reveal while searching your deck for a creature card.  You grab a land and say the creature in your hand was there the whole time.  Outside of a streamed pro-tournament this would be game breaking all over the place.
custommagic,3dfyfx,TheGuyInAShirtAndTie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:47:26 2015 UTC,"...what? You do realize that this card doesn't search for a specific card, right? All I'm doing is explaining why adding ""reveal it"" to the card is a balancer here, rather than its usual usage of preventing cheating."
custommagic,3dfyfx,Galgus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:01:42 2015 UTC,I guess I misinterpreted the comment
custommagic,3dfyfx,mama_tom,2,Thu Jul 16 22:11:26 2015 UTC,It is a really cheap tutor effect that once resolved can be an uncounterable creature.
custommagic,3dfyfx,MTGCardFetcher,3,Thu Jul 16 01:01:09 2015 UTC,Indiscriminate search effects never reveal. You just kill the 2/2 because it will be bad everytime. This card is designed for edh and it is not very good for most modern/legacy decks. Someone should be able to kill it and if they can't you deserve to have it.
custommagic,3dfyfx,Celoth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:20:40 2015 UTC,"I love the flavor of this, though I'm pretty sure something would break it."
custommagic,3dfyfx,Celoth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:12:08 2015 UTC,Probably but making your wincon a 3 mana 2/2 seems fine to me as a downside.
custommagic,3dfyfx,Celoth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:06:12 2015 UTC,Obscure combo time.     [[worldgorger Dragon]]+[[Animate Dead]] and get [[Bogarden Hellkite]] with this
custommagic,3dg8ja,3Dspacejesus,17,Thu Jul 16 00:57:35 2015 UTC,"It can cycle itself away for G.  It can be a worse version of Explore for 1GG.  Combined with Rampant Growth, it's a weird Divination variant.  It can do a good Urban Evolution impression for 2GGG.  In decks designed around it, it can power out some backbreaking plays.  What do you think?"
custommagic,3dg8ja,matchstick1029,3,Thu Jul 16 00:59:00 2015 UTC,I absolutely love this card. My only criticism is that it might be too complex/strong/niche for the uncommon slot.
custommagic,3dg8ja,hossboyz,13,Thu Jul 16 01:19:36 2015 UTC,Yes. Make it a rare. I would love it as a rare.
custommagic,3dg8ja,matchstick1029,3,Thu Jul 16 01:23:00 2015 UTC,It would suck if they printed it though. Bloom titan would knock everything else out of the way.
custommagic,3dg8ja,hossboyz,10,Thu Jul 16 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase: I would love it IN CASUAL as a rare. It would be a nuclear bomb in modern, as you pointed out."
custommagic,3dg8ja,Oddsbod,3,Thu Jul 16 02:13:49 2015 UTC,"Like, an extremely powerful nuclear bomb, or an extremely powerful nuclear bomb that would absolutely require a ban?"
custommagic,3dg8ja,hossboyz,5,Thu Jul 16 03:44:25 2015 UTC,A Hydrogen Fusion Bomb.
custommagic,3dg8ja,Awkward_Torkoal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:25:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced. If Bloom Titan gets to the point where it can abuse this, it's probably won anyway.  It doesn't work as ramp as you need a ton of mana to kick it a few times.  The only time you're drawing a bunch of cards from this is if you're already comboing off with Summer Bloom."
custommagic,3dg8ja,matchstick1029,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:00:59 2015 UTC,"I kinda want to test it because after a turn two azusa, this becomes very dangerous."
custommagic,3dg8ja,ChildishSerpent,2,Fri Jul 17 14:52:01 2015 UTC,I actually think this would be perfect at uncommon. Especially in a set like Battle for Zendikar. If be supremely disappointed in this as my pack rare.
custommagic,3dg8ja,matchstick1029,2,Thu Jul 16 12:31:35 2015 UTC,I thoroughly disagree based on both power and complexity. But to each their own.
custommagic,3dg8ja,ChildishSerpent,2,Thu Jul 16 14:20:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right- each set needs a few rares that aren't necessarily good in limited, but do great things in constructed, and this probably shouldn't show up in limited all that often."
custommagic,3dg8ja,matchstick1029,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:33:47 2015 UTC,NWO is mostly concerned with keeping complexity out of common. The power level of this card is similar to Urban Evolution which is uncommon.
custommagic,3dg8ja,arly803,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"Its definitely more powerful than UE, the thing is its basically useless in limited and insane in constructed. The lower rarities should (imo) be useful in limited."
