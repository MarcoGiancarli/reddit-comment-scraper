Also, hit up apartment complexes, they always have people leaving junk behind and for some of the units with more abandoned crap they'll use outside vendors. Keep in mind most apartment complexes will require you to join a ""vendor verification system"" which will have a fee of about $100, it's well worth it. Also, you'll be ahead of the competition if you are willing to work in roach/flea infested units, as most trash out companies are too scared to do so.  Source : I used to do property preservation, I was a vendor management supervisor for an REO company and I currently own a pest control company working with several apartment companies."
smallbusiness,3e5v07,NorCalMisfit,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:37:47 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the reply. Would you happen to know if it would be more beneficial to rent dumpsters for the cleanouts or to buy a box truck and haul the trash to the dump myself?
smallbusiness,3e5v07,NorCalMisfit,2,Wed Jul 22 05:43:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on the job. While I don't have a trailer to use for trash outs, on one occasion I rented a trailer from U-Haul. While some larger jobs certainly would benefit from a rental dumpster, if you have the manpower of load up and dump a couple times a day, and you've bid accordingly, you can do it that way. I remember one hoarders home I helped trash out, job was bid at $8,500 and took us over a week of four guys, two trucks working 6 days a week."

Food costs will take shape based on your average ticket if you can sell enough high margin fries with your orders etc. What you are proposing is a massive undertaking that can't really be fully explained in this type of format if you have any specific questions feel free to ask although I don't do business in Canada so I can't answer those. Don't forget to set aside marketing money most chains spend around 5% of gross sales for marketing budget if you want to compete so should you, set aside 1 to 2% for preventative maintenance AND repair on all your equipment and your shop in general. 2k a day is a lofty goal for an independent burger shop, how did you come up with those sales projections that's almost 300 customers a day based on avg ticket prices in the states."

smallbusiness,3e4iqe,allquieton,31,Tue Jul 21 22:07:57 2015 UTC,"So, what are you getting for the $70,000?  Is that all goodwill?  Can you assume the lease at $2,100/month?  Let do some math based on the limited information you have given us:  If revenue averages $700/day (and you need to find out if that is an average or a ""typical weekday"" or whatever), then that is $255,500 a year in gross revenue.  That is a big ""if"".  Then you have to subtract expenses:  Inventory: How much does the owner pay every year to purchase inventory?  What are the margins on these items (the difference between what he buys it for and what he sells it for)?  Labor: How much does it cost or would it cost to hire a clerk or two to manage the store in your absence.  If you are not planning to be absent, you are basically buying a job.  For your analysis, you should calculate what it would cost to hire someone, so you can figure out how much to pay for the goodwill.  Let's be generous and assume you have to hire two $10/hour employees to cover the 84 hours a week you are open.  That's $840 a week, not counting payroll taxes and any benefits that may be required.  That works out to $43,680.  Probably will be more.  Utility bills: Consider that you will probably have to pay for gas/electric/water/sewer for the building and this is probably not included in the lease.  Insurance:  You will have to pay for business insurance and various other types of insurance.  Licenses: Can you take over the current owner's licenses?  Find this out.  Contracts: Does the station sell gas or just convenience store items?  Can you assume all of the current owner's contracts with vendors?  Equipment Replacement/Maintenance: how much will you have to pay each year to replace the cash register or the slushie machine or the ice container etc.?  Who will clean the floors and how much are cleaning supplies anyway?    Legal Fees and Accounting fees:  Who is going to do your taxes every quarter and who will you call when someone slips in your parking lot and hires an attorney?  How much is that going to cost?  After all that is taken out (and there are plenty of expenses that pop up unexpectedly), then you have your gross profit.  Out of that comes your income taxes (some states and federal if in the US) and self-employment taxes.  You may have thought of some of this, but if anything I've said above made you think ""Hmm, I haven't thought of that before,"" then you need to take a big step back, go read some business books and look for a lower risk opportunity.  Running a business is very stressful and businesses are likely to fail even if the owner knows what he or she is doing.  Losing $85,000 would be a very painful business lesson that you can get for cheap elsewhere."

smallbusiness,3e4iqe,anonymouseponymously,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:23:30 2015 UTC,"In my city, many convenience stores are run by Asian or African immigrant families. Apparently, there are loopholes in which these small business owners can ""force"" their kids (or other relatives) to work the store at a labor cost much lower than if they had hired someone just off of the street. So these convenience stores are exempt from minimum wage requirements, employment taxes, and other mandated benefit costs like paid sick leave.  I think this is one of the main ways convenience stores remain profitable despite the low margins inherent with the industry. Many of the more traditional labor costs can be viewed similar to how a father would tell a son to go do his chores and mind the cash register."

Take nothing at face value; there is no alternative to actually doing the math... and doing the research to get the numbers for the math. For instance, map out the locations of competitors, and also try and find out if any new ones are going up or old ones have shut down. Visit the store location at different times of day and tally up the traffic going by and note what kind. Look up crime statistics and insurance rates for the area. Check with city hall about upcoming nearby construction work, zoning applications, or anything else that might affect the business. Look into anything that might affect expenses, the cost of labor, the cost of key inventory, etc. Get your hands on as much data as possible, and try and get it going back year by year and then check for trends.

smallbusiness,3e4iqe,scsibusfault,7,Wed Jul 22 04:16:19 2015 UTC,"/u/downstandingcitizen and/u/RowYourUpboat make great points, but being a bit of a contrarian I'll play devil's advocate:  What is the competition like?  Look at a 1-5 mile radius at the other similar businesses, and think about how you might carve out a really compelling reason to come to you over them.  Maybe you could offer a crazy good selection of craft beers - or be the only place in town to get good e-cig stuff (mods, juices, coils etc). Or be the only place in a 50 mile radius where you can get good full service for your expensive performance vehicle, with the no-ethanol high octane jet fuel shit they can't find anywhere else. Or maybe you have the only tesla charging station in the area. Or the only biodiesel in the area.    Or you could go the full sleazeville route and have the cheapest beer, dirtiest nudie mags, and little rose-in-a-glass-tube crack pipes.   I'd steer away from that, but if you could also cater to truckers who buy a lot of gas it could be a win (no offense redditruckers, but I think you know what I'm talking about). Throw some greasy food in the mix and maybe a hot shower and you're golden.... Actually throw some golden showers in the mix and you're double gold.  Basically, business is tough, and in the convenience store business is tougher. There's a reason so many are run by folks from afar. Those are people willing to go to a strange place, learn the language, learn how to run a business, and work their asses off till it works. That's what you're up against. That could even be you, for all I know. But even still you're up against folks who've been doing it longer than you.  The key to beating the competition is offering something they won't, they can't, or they don't know about. And once it works - assuming it works - they're going to copy you.   So you need to be one step ahead of the curve. Which means paying attention to the type of people who pay you the most, and creating the best experience possible for them.  Bottom line, there's a reason this place is for sale. That means you shouldn't buy it assuming you'll change nothing. The owner is probably not happy with the way things are going. You shouldn't assume you will be either.  Figuring out what to change, and what to NEVER FUCKING CHANGE EVER is where the real magic is."

Being on the customer side of packaging, I can tell you I look locally for convertors due to shipping cost and convenience. How healthy is local industry? Does this company rely on one or two big customers? With TPP, and the Euro traded eal on the horizon, is the business at risk of losing, say, a large branch of a multinational as a customer?  I also look for vertical integration. I don't want to have to hunt for a separate company for foam inserts, and another one to design all the packaging, and yet another one to do ISTA testing.

smallbusiness,3e2lkc,PublicThoughts,3,Tue Jul 21 13:58:38 2015 UTC,"Owner and operator of a food stand + restaurant here. I hope to be able to provide some insight into this question. Please forgive my English, it is not my native language.   Much of what I can tell you is doubtful because of different laws in different places. I am in Europe. I have the trailer type stand. I wish I had the van type. It is very hard for me to tow the thing around, it is much harder parking a trailer then a truck and I need 2 insurances, two yearly inspections etc. The only plus is that I have a car to use most of the time when not towing the trailer. A painful issue is parking - a truck can park as long as you want (in industrial areas etc. where parking is free), but a trailer must be moved every 14 days (laws may vary). I get about 200 euro in tickets a year because I dont have time to move it, but it is ok for me - still less then a year's worth of rent for a parking spot. My trailer runs only on electricity. Many of my colleagues have gas also. I am happy like this, less inspections, cheaper insurance etc., but I can't really grill stuff. I just deep fry or toast. Finding a place to stand is not always easy, usually you have to move every day to a different location (see point 2). See what the local regulations are, and find yourself several spots (like, every monday spot X, every wednesday spot Y etc.) before committing.  Production and storage? You can't usually have this at home, you need to find a commercial kitchen to produce and store your product. this can be very hard, since you only need like 25% time, which can be too little to justify renting a kitchen (and if you do rent one, you will find out you have opened a restaurant), but too much to share with someone (and anyway it is very hard to work in someone else's kitchen. Maybe some catering firm or other like-mided people can rent with you and do some time share. This is one of the hardest issues to solve. Find your production spot before anything else. Health department have many many rules, make sure to find out about them, because the department LOVES visiting trucks, it is easy money. just last week I got a 35 euro fine. Why?

I would not consider anything ""postponed"" - you can't operate in temporary limbo and then drop everything when the client calls again.   If the client is a small business they should understand.   Are you familiar with the /r/freelance sub?  I just found it a few days ago.  They keep this video link in the side bar 'Mike Monteiro - F*ck you, Pay Me'.  It is pretty good - goes over a lot of stuff we figured out after years of learning the hard way.  https://vimeo.com/22053820"
smallbusiness,3e2cre,adamkru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"I quite enjoy the that video. I wasn't aware of the freelance sub, defiantly gonna check it out.  As for the kill fee how would you work it? If client does not get content within X number of days there invoiced 50% of the remainder of the project and this basically concludes the contract. If they wish to start the site up again, it's a new contract?"
smallbusiness,3e2cre,adamkru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:07 2015 UTC,"Yes new project / proposal.  In my experience, when a project goes on hiatus a change in scope is soon to follow.  The % of completion can be very subjective to clients. Having a flat kill fee is the easiest discussion.  Sending an invoice is the only way to make them commit, and even then there can be some disagreement."
smallbusiness,3e2cre,AnonJian,0,Tue Jul 21 17:28:17 2015 UTC,"With content marketing all the rage, no content no start. As in zero. You want to start the project, you provide the content.   If content isn't provided, and the client wants work to start, add a fee to a copywriter and/or content writer. Paid in full. Work can then begin.   Also, Just Say No to Lorem Ipsum. Because that causes the problem. Who are we kidding, every standard operating procedure in web development causes some problem.   A web site is a delivery vehicle for content. You say it often enough, you may begin to believe it."

I want to avoid the parking in a field thing, but it will be an option for those that don't want to pay the storage unit fee, or have campers that are too large. Some farmers around here have HUGE pole barns, and they rent out their extra space as well, but I don't like that from a security perspective, and the liability on the land owner is pretty high."

smallbusiness,3e2v1v,eoesouljah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"I figure that the up-front cost will be substantial, that's why I'm trying to get ideas on actual costs.  I'm more concerned about the buildings, I know what land is going for in our area, so I have an idea on what that will run me.  I threw 20-30 acres out, but I don't know if I'll need that much, most of the ones I've seen sit on less than 5-10 acres.  So, I may have overshot that estimate.  I need to edit this, I did some looking at some sheds that are used for boat storage.  On that I found is a 16-unit building that's 230ftx30ft.  It also has a 6-unit on it, and it all sits on less than 1.5 acres.  So, I was WAY off in thinking that 20-30 acres is what I need.  I'm thinking that 10 acres max would make for some nice size storage. With the buildings, I don't think that I'll go with concrete right away.  It can always be poured later, and doing it up front adds a huge amount of overhead."

smallbusiness,3e0qzn,chugotit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:30:11 2015 UTC,"OK, but what is the ROI they get? Presumably it is enough to pay the taxes and run the business.

smallbusiness,3e0k9j,RoomInMyCar,2,Tue Jul 21 07:13:41 2015 UTC,"First of all I want to say I really love the name of your company. Prior to even clicking your link the name draws on great imagery and a sense of tradition.  Unfortunately upon landing on your site that charm was expelled. Visually your logo and banner leave a lot to be desired, and don't inspire much trust.  The current logo is taking up a lot of real estate and the text on the image is blurry (live text is a better option).  There's no immediate call to action. Even the products on your homepage lack any information accompanying them.  The shop template itself feels as if it was designed with a less robust shopping experience in mind. At least one of the drop downs requires scolling to see all the subcategories.   On the product pages some images seem to be stretched slightly beyond their limits, looking blurry.  Also the social media sharing buttons are larger and more intrusive than the 'Add to Cart' on the product pages.  Overall the fonts could use a swap, current ones feel more 'fashion' than utilitarian or outdoors.  On the technical side of things there aren't a whole lot of issues. We find no Javascript errors and the page load speed is actually quite good with your CSS and Javascript being minified.    I would encourage you to consider beefing up your page titles, particularly on your homepage for SEO, as well as adding a meta description tag. Also create a sitemap.  As a whole I am not fond of Shopify as a platform - we like to provide our clients with code and artwork they own, typically using Open Source software such as www.opencart.com or www.woocommerce.com as they have much more freedom and control over their website this way.

People almost finish the whole dozen of cookies in one sitting, I've heard this countless of times btw. My Vegan Banana nut bread always sells out at the Farmers Market. Since I make my breads and cookies with organic ingredients, no gmo's or preservatives, you can have that sweet tooth minus the guilt, but all in moderation of course.

smallbusiness,3dzhao,sanderwolf,2,Tue Jul 21 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"Glad to see a fellow vegans starting businesses like these, getting products like yours out there to the wider audience. This is what the movement needs if we ever want it to catch on with people or at least get them to stop thinking that ""vegan food is bland"".   Seems like it will be difficult to ship certain bakery items. I worked for a flower delivery company for a few months and they decided to partner with this cupcake company and have us start delivering cupcakes for them. It was a complete disaster. The cupcakes would leave the store looking all nice then would be destroyed by the time they actually got there. There's just so many things that would go wrong, the box would get wet, smashed, fall over and mess up the ""prettiness"" factor.  I don't usually buy vegan food products online but I did buy these vegan energy/protein bars online once. I can't remember the name of the company, it was some start-up though, like yours. Things like that might be a better strategy. They don't go bad for a lot longer or get smashed or things like that. They have a lot of purposes also, since it's a health food people eat them when they're dieting, bodybuilders eat them, i bought them to bring while traveling. Anyways, those are my thoughts on the matter. Hope that helps! Good luck!  P.S. My mouth is watering thinking about your vegan banana nut bread right now."

Banana bread ships really well :) You don't need to make a huge investment since you're just getting started, maybe just some branded boxes, labels, and a cheapo black & white laser printer. If you really want to keep costs low, you can get a custom-made rubber stamp with your logo and hand-stamp plain shipping boxes (check out Etsy for folks making rubber stamps). If you're goods aren't too heavy, USPS is probably your best best for shipping, and the order will arrive at any US destination within three says with priority mail (you can purchase commercial rate postage online through Click-N-Ship, which is a cinch).

smallbusiness,3e0o14,ThatOneRepairGuy,4,Tue Jul 21 01:28:54 2015 UTC,"Just went through a similar situation with my business. In my personal experience, moving to the main strip actually slowed my business down a little due to lack of parking. Definitely ensure with whatever location you decide on, you have some parking for customers.   Do you have competition? If not, customers will likely drive to wherever you are. Just make sure you do advertise like you said you were.   Also, if you do decide to go with the Main Street location make sure you have appealing front windows to attract foot traffic. Make sure you're noticeable and customers can see what you have to offer by just walking/driving by.   Since you're a start-up moving into your first location I'd recommend getting a location with cheaper rent off of the main strip. I highly doubt a location on the Main Street will increase your revenue enough for it to be worth it."

Problem with foot traffic is, there is none. It's a strip with NO sidewalks, only a 4 lane road. It's all park and walk into the shop, then drive to the next shop. Only real foot traffic is the mall. And yes, parking at some of these shops is a PITA.   And the average price for a office space on the strip is 1800 a month, when it's only 350 a month off the strip, almost for the same building.  Thank you for your input! It's actually really helped."
smallbusiness,3e0o14,California_Viking,2,Tue Jul 21 03:58:50 2015 UTC,You can try driving the area and slaking around yourself. I assume the other locations will be a strip mall or some other businesses.  Some other locations might actually help you. Being close to an anchor for instance. Best bet is to ask other businesses how they're doing to see what kind of traffic you get.  If you can do the phone repair in an hour or less I can see why being near some other shopping might help.

smallbusiness,3e0snt,md_sabre1,3,Tue Jul 21 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"""Impulsively buying unique items"" is not a strategy for business success.  You need to have a cost basis in mind when you buy any stock, a target sales price and a floor sales price. You also need to have an understanding as to how long (in days/months) you will hold an inventory item before slashing the price --- potentially to cost or below.  Before you spend another dime buying ANYTHING, I strongly recommend you spend some time reading up and getting an understanding of the following basic business concepts: ""Gross Margin"", ""Net Margin"", ""COGS (Cost Of Goods Sold)"", ""Working Capital"", and ""Cash Flow"".  The Internet, including YouTube, your local SBDC, and your library are all great places to get FREE information on these fundamental business concepts."

Since, you are not reporting these services performed as income you can not therefore deduct bad debt expense.  Example: You contract to perform work with a client in November. Work should take 6 months and you receive equal payments (let's say $1,000/month at the end of the month for a total of $6,000).   You start work. Client makes a payment at the end of November. December rolls around and client doesn't make payment, but says they will after the first of the year. You continue the work. For this tax year you would record $1,000 of income from this job on cash basis / $2,000 on accrual basis. January 15th, client says they will be unable to pay you. You cease work. You have only reported $1,000 of income in the previous year. You can NOT deduct a bad debt expense. If you were on accrual and reported $2,000 on last years tax return, then you could, as you only earned $1,000.  It sucks that they didn't pay you, but your only hope of recovery is most likely through legal pursuit of them. Depending on the amount, it may not be worth it. This is just the cost of doing business and learning. If you are performing a service, it is perfectly reasonable to ask for a deposit at the undertaking of the work. Depending on the nature of your work, client, and industry it could be as much as 50% up front. You could most likely file in small claims court for a nominal fee. If it isn't much money, they will most likely pay you rather than go to court. If they don't, get a judgement. You can then either sell the debt or attach it to their property with interest. You could also just sell the debt outright to a debt collector."

smallbusiness,3dz9rk,krisdigital,0,Mon Jul 20 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"More and more customers search for products online, but want to buy offline.   What source of hard data tells you this.   How Online Shopping and Shipping Behavior is Evolving in 2015  128% of consumers, that's a lot...   A new Accenture report on holiday shopping released today finds that 65% of online shoppers plan to “webroom” this holiday shopping season, that is, browse online and then head to a store to make their purchases. Survey respondents say that avoiding shipping costs (47%) and being able to touch and feel a product before purchase (46%) were their primary motivations for shopping this way.   And the very same article offers this for those none too good with math...   Showrooming will also be a tactic deployed by more shoppers this year, with 63% of shoppers saying they will showroom, which Accenture defines as going into a physical store to see a product and then searching online for a better price and making the purchase online. That compares with 56% who said they would do so last year.   Something is screwy. But it is a cherrypicker's delight, as you can choose to focus on just whatever supports your assumptions. And, should you change on a whim next week, you can find support for doing the exact opposite. Makes a good argument for doing your own testing and tracking as a critical component of sound decisions making.   My suggestion is make a seamless online and offline presence. Meaning support the entire customer experience, taking into account an online and offline component, and a clear path from either direction from shopping all the way to post purchase. In other words, what business should have been doing since they began just tacking on a web site and treating it as a separate business. The retailer prepared to attract these customers, start by treating the terms online or offline as meaningless. Perhaps even harmful.   If you're using social properly, you can attract customers. If you're using social media like a local shopper to place ads in, then probably not.   Most every business makes a fuss over a new customer, and ignores existing customers. Don't Groupon. Reward best customers, and market your customer service as your leading product.   Everybody rewards the first sale. That should tell you what you need to know about why people aren't loyal. Nobody considers being a valued customer as they would a desirable product, and you have everything about today's market summed up.   If people stopped rewarding one shot dicount-only consumers, they'd get more loyal customers."

This is very simple to do.  Then you'll want to do some search engine optimization on your website so that your pages show up on Google. Another option is to build a presence on social media platforms (actually you should do both).  Also look into paid marketing once you have your e-commerce site up.

Your focus is a great idea, and it's where I see a lot of places falling short. Whether you explicitly follow ITIL or not, your value will most likely be in creating and implementing policies and procedures for repair shops, NOCs, and MSPs. So many of these gather/build great tools, skilled employees, etc but they get so caught up in the day-to-day that while they may keep records of their clients' assets, they don't document their own. Without documented procedures, any IT outfit has a more difficult time onboarding employees and ends up with team members who do everything their own way, which makes it harder to coordinate projects.  Given that your primary value will be intellectual property, start developing templates and materials and just get out there. You don't need a lot in the way of overhead for consulting.

smallbusiness,3dvl7t,wakayoda,19,Sun Jul 19 23:16:05 2015 UTC,$30 prepaid phone from Walmart is an easy tradeoff for a $900 bike
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,akamerer,0,Mon Jul 20 01:52:36 2015 UTC,Plus cards/ID
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,wakayoda,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:00 2015 UTC,So is a $5 pre-paid debit card.
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,ckinsey,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:35 2015 UTC,It's pretty easy to distinguish pre-paid cards from credit cards.
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,WackyXaky,12,Mon Jul 20 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"I've owned a shop for almost 40 years. The rules for test rides have to be fixed in stone. You get 2 pieces of ID, Driver's License and a credit card and at least one must be a photo ID. No Exceptions Ever! If you have any suspicion at all you can run a credit card ""authorization only"". If credit card don't swipe ask for another card. NEVER punch in a number manually. Take only the ID. Don't take jackets, wallets or any other valuables. Tell all your employees to pay attention to the tickle in their stomachs when something doesn't feel right. These test ride thieves will often take several test rides and move up slowly to the most expensive bike and then disappear. They're often in a hurry, often eager to ride a bike even if it's not their size. Remind employees that a $900 bike sale is only about $275 in profit. I hope this helps. I've learned the hard way. The rule is always if it doesn't make sense, doesn't feel right, something is wrong."
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,Curmugeon,4,Mon Jul 20 16:51:50 2015 UTC,$275 in profit   $275 in gross margin that pays their salaries and keeps the AC on.
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,BigSlowTarget,8,Mon Jul 20 03:41:14 2015 UTC,"Don't contact pawn shops, but file a police report. Contacting pawnshops is a waste of time, most wont tell you anything because of customer confidentiality. Also, if they do see it they will turn it down because it will be a loss for them.However in the US pawnshops(and legal buy/sell) have a linked database with the local police department. Filing a police report will locate your bike if it enters a pawnshops database.  Source: work at a pawn shop."
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,jimlaine,3,Mon Jul 20 05:38:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't get the ""call all the pawn shops"" comments. Pawn shop owners are not the local morality police. Yes, some are great guys, but the part-timer from the pawn shop locale has more on his mind than wrangling local thieves."
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,mesohungry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:08:49 2015 UTC,"Could some sketchy pawn shops just put something fake into the database, or nothing at all? Such as if they had a suspicious that something was fake?  Perhaps offering a reward for finding the bike would help."
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,ThioJoe,3,Mon Jul 20 06:27:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, be sure to keep a lookout on craigslist or any pawn shops nearby."
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,Jaelup,2,Mon Jul 20 11:24:32 2015 UTC,"Something like this may help in recovering things in these situations. you would just have to be creative with placement and be sure to remove them upon a sale:  Retrievor GPS Tracker - http://www.popsci.com/article/gadgets/put-these-quarter-sized-gps-trackers-everything  We all know cops are not likely to find a stolen bike, but if you can already tell them where it is and help them with their arrest quota in one fell swoop the odds are more in your favor I think :)  Edit, also possibly a polaroid camera to snap a photo of the person taking the bike out? All that info coupled together with the GPS thing could allow you to actually see where they're riding and if they head too far past where discussed you get an early warning of a potential theft attempt too. I don't know if it has any kind of walling capabilities though."
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,Zippy1776,4,Sun Jul 19 23:16:25 2015 UTC,"My friend had this happen to his shop. $2600 Cannondale Scalpel.  They found it on CL the next day and someone's kid was bragging to a relative about this expensive bike and they put 2 and 2 together.  Basically they got the bike back but just about all of the serials were filed off, including some obscure places in the frame.  I'm not sure legally what happened (since they filed the serials they couldn't prove it was the bike that was stolen as the shop had video cameras but they weren't rolling at the time) but my friend got the bike back but still had to get hit with insurance.  As the top comment suggests get copies of the credit card to match the ID in the future."
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,fmdx,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:37 2015 UTC,"My LBS asks for your cellphone. Not because of this reason, but because he says people leave their drivers licenses and credit cards all the time but never forget their phones. Another one near buy does ask for a CC and license with matching info though."
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,CousinStavros,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:55 2015 UTC,Could still pick up a cheap phone just to leave there. With a CC at least you can charge it if they disappear.
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,ImJustAMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:11:31 2015 UTC,Yeah that's very true. There's always going to be some way around whatever the collateral is. It's unfortunate :(
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,CousinStavros,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:52:25 2015 UTC,Ask for 2 forms of ID and digital image picture consent.

smallbusiness,3dvl7t,Axumata,3,Mon Jul 20 13:45:01 2015 UTC,What does a person who does not steal bikes look like?
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,HoldingThePoop,-6,Mon Jul 20 06:51:37 2015 UTC,Like a person that looks nice and trustworthy. Like a person that won't make you wish you had a tougher bike lock when you see him.
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,Axumata,5,Mon Jul 20 08:46:17 2015 UTC,Oh. I see what you're getting at. And I see you're also a contributor in coontown. Go away.
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,HoldingThePoop,-5,Mon Jul 20 09:06:19 2015 UTC,"No, that's what you are getting at. I just wondered if that bike thief looked trustworthy."
smallbusiness,3dvl7t,Axumata,4,Mon Jul 20 09:07:47 2015 UTC,No he's getting at the fact that trustworthy looks are an opinion and that you're probably racist lol.
smallbusiness,3dwy2s,coldasice2015,2,Mon Jul 20 05:36:23 2015 UTC,Sent you a PM.
smallbusiness,3dwy2s,sinbushar,2,Mon Jul 20 06:09:38 2015 UTC,What about a custom printed sleeve that you slide up the sides of the cartoons like Starbucks does? That gives some temperature relief too.
smallbusiness,3dwqfn,WangChi,6,Mon Jul 20 04:14:54 2015 UTC,The regular answer here for these types of Q's is to talk to an accountant. When you get into specifics like this on this type of platform you're very likely to get a wrong answer or something that can lead you down the wrong path.  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

smallbusiness,3dwqfn,suzhouCN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:15:23 2015 UTC,"**Tax Deductions for Hobby Expenses In general, you are allowed to deduct ordinary and necessary hobby expenses (with certain limitations). An “ordinary” expense is one that’s considered common and accepted for the activity. A “necessary” expense is one that’s considered helpful and appropriate for the activity.  Since a hobby is not a business, hobbyists are not entitled to the same tax deductions that businesspeople can claim. As a hobbyist, you can usually deduct your hobby expenses up to the amount of your hobby income. But any expenses that exceed your hobby income are considered personal losses and are not deductible from your other income.**  -Source  Also, you need to determine if it is a hobby or business. See link above for a starting point."
