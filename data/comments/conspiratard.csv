conspiratard,3dxzn8,Ardhen,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"It's not really fascism as it is a form of tribalism and confederation.  This is an interesting key here: The US constitution, interpreted without anything beyond the first 10 amendments or any supreme court rulings, under it's very original interpretation, was so weak that many states argued that it could not supersede the state constitution. This allows the federal government to be extraordinarily weak, but allows the state to pass laws that would violate normal constitutional rights (like having a state religion, or mandatory religious education laws). This is called ""state-sovereignty"".  Now, this is a big issue with these guys, but the truly crazy ones reject even this authority. They feel that not even the state can supersede the authority of the local government or sherrif's office which is locally elected. It's so low level in authority that it's almost anarchism, but it doesn't involve many typical anarchist principles or philosophies. It really is more akin to tribalism or militia-ism, where the local militia (whether democratically elected or otherwise) maintains total political control.  A lot of the Native American tribes have had similar issues in the past when their native governments might have been usurped by some sort of internal coup, and the self-appointed government created it's own security element to attack and disrupt political opponents. Such a situation led to the Siege at Wounded Knee in 1973."

This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding."

I am well aware of what the constitution is, and that the supremacy clause is a thing. In 1789, several of the states did not agree with the supremacy clause. As time went on it became more accepted, but you have to realize that just because the constitution said so, didn't make it real in practical terms. There were many times when the states would argue that the federal government could not over-rule the laws of the state, or it's constitution because they believed in the ""state sovereignty"" principle. 'State sovereignty' only died as an American political idea after the civil war ended.  You gave me a wiki source, so here's yours: State's Rights  Look at the history prior to the Civil War and you will see more than a few incidents where it would be obvious to us that the supremacy clause should have ended the argument. It didn't because some of the states did not believe it should."

He even wrote to a friend:  ""Those who betray or subvert the Constitution are guilty of sedition and/or treason, are domestic enemies and should and will be punished accordingly.  It also stands to reason that anyone who sympathizes with the enemy or gives aid or comfort to said enemy is likewise guilty. I have sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic and I will. And I will because not only did I swear to, but I believe in what it stands for in every bit of my heart, soul and being. I know in my heart that I am right in my struggle, Steve. I have come to peace with myself, my God and my cause. Blood will flow in the streets, Steve. Good vs. Evil. Free Men vs. Socialist Wannabe Slaves. Pray it is not your blood, my friend.""

Law enforcement's shifted focus on right-wing extremism Consistent decline of threats and attacks from Islamic Terrorism Right-wing extremism has been shown to be more lethal than Islamic Terrorism within the US. This corroborates with previous studies as well. On the other hand, the threat of right-wing terrorism has become much more prevalent. While conspiracy theorists have never been able to successfully identify Islamic terrorist training camps in the US, there are now a record number of anti-government militias in the US. Finally, anti-government militias engaged in an armed standoff with federal agents and police that included deploying snipers, threatening to martyr themselves and their families, and setting up checkpoints in a nearby town. IIRC, no similar comparable situation exists in relationship to Islamic terrorism. If such an event had occurred, the American public would have called for airstrikes."

conspiratard,3dxzn8,Cadetastic,5,Mon Jul 20 21:37:35 2015 UTC,"is none of this hatecrimes    As others have already replied, ""hatecrimes"" in the US need to involve more than sentiment - a regular crime is labeled a hate-crime if it can be shown that it was motivated by hatred or desire to intimidate a particular protected group, but there's got to be that initial crime to begin with and very few expressed sentiments short of direct threats are going to qualify for that.  The misconception, though, that ""hate itself is a crime"" under ""hate crime"" laws however is actually a fairly common canard among right-wing reactionaries who try to justify their victim complex. I don't blame you for getting confused as it's not at all uncommon to see reactionaries online especially bemoaning the very idea of hate-crimes as if it's some sort of first amendment issue outlawing their free speech or opinions when really it couldn't be farther from the truth.  Come to think of it, really, that narrative is one of those things that tends to gain even wider support among more level headed people who simply get caught up in the sense of outrage and indignation that the real reactionaries put forth convincingly.  It's a real pain in the ass to see coming up again and again."

I just can't even process how she could possibly come to that conclusion. This is like physics 101, you don't get free energy, energy is conserved. And even if free energy were real, and even if 9/11 was an inside job, it would still be a terrible idea to use the free energy machine when you're trying to hide the conspiracy. Like, this is conspiracy 101, don't give it away with obvious signs of a conspiracy (like the usage of a microwave building destructionator or whatever you want to call it).

I'm all for destigmatizing mental illness, but that means conveying that mental illness doesn't make you a bad person, not saying that there's nothing wrong with you. Like, imagine if there were a stigma around admitting you have cancer. That would be a problem to counter, but I wouldn't try to tell people with cancer that they ""aren't broken"". If you have cancer your body is broken and needs fixing. If you have a significant mental illness there absolutely is something wrong that needs fixing, and you should seek help to fix it.

The real question is since she's obviously trying to puff up her credentials why did she not add here AS?  I mean by the time you have a PHD you have completed the required hours for each degree. It would also not be really difficult to 'build' (generally students in traditional phd programs do not but it's not impossible) degrees each on the lower degree.. the course work is essentially the same.  But as I said.. ""Dr Dino"" has a phd.. not that he compete with a fifth grader on anything above 'god did it' but it's a real paper doctorate from a school."

conspiratard,3dtq13,shdjjj8,22,Sun Jul 19 13:58:39 2015 UTC,"Worked on Firefox, not Chrome. Here's the article:   Images of Pluto, beamed billions of miles to Earth from the New Horizons spacecraft this week, appear to reveal new details about the surface of the microplanet. But a group of individuals says the images are fake and that NASA staged the flyby. Major historic moments often inspire conspiracy theories, and bloggers have dubbed this one the Pluto Truther movement.  A man who goes by Crow Trippleseven questioned the initial Pluto images in a YouTube video last week that has garnered more than 50,000 views. “This is silliness and games and they are literally robbing the American people and then lying to them,” he says of NASA in the video, which Gizmodo picked up. His argument: How is it that NASA’s images of Pluto, supposedly taken from a only few million miles away, are of a poorer quality than those he took of Jupiter with his telescopic camera from 484 million miles away?  Referring to a photo of the New Horizons spacecraft, Crow says in the video it’s “probably sitting in a Burbank, Hollywood soundstage somewhere.” He adds: “If you want to see the real Pluto, I’m sorry to say, you’ve got to go to Disneyland.”  Crow agreed to answer questions by email, provided that Newsweek published them only in a Q&A format. He declined to provide his real name, occupation or age, citing threats he says he has received.  Why keep your identity so secretive?  People would be surprised to learn just how much anger and hatred are leveled against people for simply making video clips with a different point of view. I have not totally hidden my identity and have said many things about work, past jobs and other things about myself. Even that I live in San Diego. What I do protect is my private life and my specific location and this is solely due to the number of threats I have received, and I would mention I have a wife who I try to shield from said anger and hatred. One of the first clips up on my channel was the lunar wave clip and the unwanted attention was soon to follow. I did not expect that and was stunned at the level of malice. Even people who said they lived in my area and would find me—and all because of video clips.  What exactly about the Pluto flyby do you believe is fake?  The Pluto mission is no different than any other NASA mission in my view. You may be aware that National Geographic recently ran what I consider damage control on the cover of their magazine belittling people who question the moon landing. That is very telling and demonstrates just how many people are no longer accepting everything this government agency hands the public. This is very telling. I recently made a well researched clip on their Rosetta comet landing mission which demonstrates what we can expect from NASA on any given mission.  What would NASA or the U.S. government have to gain by faking the flyby?  Maybe the truth is that NASA cannot do as much as we have been led to believe. It is a hard thing to know. Why does any government lie to its people? While there seems to be no simple answer here, it does seem to be the way of things. Governments lie and always have.  Do you see this as part of a larger conspiracy involving NASA?  I do not see any difference when considering NASA, governments or news for that matter. We live in an age of power and deception. I do see a difference in the number of people who are no longer blind to this fact. An awakening is, in fact, under way in this regard.  How do you feel about the term “truther”?  Online the term is not respected by those who do actual research and investigation. It is viewed as controlled opposition and an easy way to place the conspiracy tag on a group. Good information seems to be coming from individuals who belong to no group these days. After all, once a group is formed it is an easy target. A group can be labeled, manipulated and belittled very easily. This is the age of the individual who researches, observes and offers up what they can in the face of a 24-hour news cycle designed to hypnotize and misinform.  This wasn’t the first time Crow has questioned NASA’s version of the cosmos. In addition challenging the Rosetta Mission comet landing last year, in October, the Huffington Post picked up a video he made that appeared to show an unidentified flying object hovering across the surface of the moon.  Another so-called Pluto Truther, Justin Shaw of Alberta, Canada, has posted on Twitter about the New Horizons images and says there is no doubt in his mind that they are computer-generated. “The whole mission is fallacious. There’s no authenticity to this at all,” he says. “People don’t think twice about it. They’re looking for a best answer, they’re given a best answer, and they go with it as if it’s a reality.”  When asked what NASA would have to gain by faking its missions, he says: “I’m not sure what they’re motive would be to be faking it, other than deception. We have a lot of tax money that’s disappearing for who knows what reason.”  Shaw doubts the entire NASA space program, including the moon landing. His theory goes: If space is a vacuum, how could spacecraft traverse it? And if it is not a vacuum, but full of debris, why would governments spend so much money sending people and high-tech gear into it? “That’s a pretty big gamble,” he says.  Not only should the public question the authenticity of these images, he says, but it should also reconsider basic teachings such as whether the Earth is round or rotates at all.  As for why he feels the need to set the record straight, Shaw says, “I’m tired of the lies and the deception that they’re playing against us. I have children and it’s very important that I leave this world not as messed up as I entered it.”  A representative for NASA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, says by email: “It's difficult to respond in detail to statements that make no sense.”"

The only thing I could think the Russians would be interested in (regarding violence on US soil) would be towards distracting the presidential administration at a critical moment. Something like delivering small arms or explosives on US soil to a separatist group, and pointing out a potential target for a hostage crisis or a siege.  STORY TIME:  For example, the US and Russia are in the middle of a major diplomatic conference involving terrorism/fate-of-a-major-conflict-zone-a-la-Syria/nuclear arms/Russian expansionism, etc. A major negotiating deadline is 96 hours away. Russia makes a disruptive claim/alteration causing a great deal of stress in the negotiations. Russia then sends words to their contacts in the US to push a separatist group to attack a federal installation to distract the US presidential administration, they hand off some purchased American weapons to the separatists.  At 72 hours, the Russians look like they are going to accept an American counter offer, it is a ruse. The separatists are given a weak target and told to take hostages, broadcast to the news media, and give exclusive coverage to the conspiracist industrial complex. Plans are made to cause a disruption in the global market place through a sudden buying, selling, or trading of some major commodity, security, or other such financial device.  At 48 hours before the deadline, the Russians make an about face diplomatically and start arguing with the negotiators, suddenly all the negotiations have stalled, but they don't appear to be collapsing. The Russian government starts handing out orders. Financial/market orders are scheduled. Military orders are sent. Diplomatic cables and announcements are prepared. The separatist group takes over part of a federal building in the evening close to the end of the work day. There are a small number of casualties, but people are coming home from work to TV and the internet to see that their is a siege on a federal building. It seems like a police event, but the political news media is already building a case against the president's handling of this for tomorrow. At the same time, negotiators and possibly the leader of Russia itself is having talks long into the night with the President, keeping him from sleeping. Over night, the financial disruption occurs in the Asian marketplace. The American markets will be the last to react and the disruption will have inevitable and predictable effects in Europe.  At 24 hours to the diplomatic deadline, the talks have now almost totally collapsed. Most of the Russian negotiators are threatening to pull completely out of the talks. One or a few Russian negotiators keep telling the Americans that there is a last chance deal that can be made if only 'such and such' is made as a compromise to the American stance. The separatists are making demands to have communications with high level administration employees, like the head of the state department. The police surrounded the building, but anti-government supporters have started flooding around the scene, with weapons. They are claiming that everyone inside will be murdered by the police and that ""This won't be like Waco!"". The police are now giving siege to the hostage-takers, and are quickly becoming besieged themselves. They will begin asking for additional federal resources as the situation spins out of control. There has been shooting coming from the building. The siege and the market turmoil out of Europe and Asia has caused stocks to slip as market unease grows. The president is now being condemned for allowing the negotiations to fail, and allowing the siege to occur/continue. He is even receiving criticism from his own party, and his administration is on full defensive PR mode. What's worse, is that he is getting intelligence reports that the Russians have made aggressive military moves somewhere on Earth, and the military needs specific orders to deal with the situation.  At 24 hours to the deadline, the presidential administration is now facing a crisis economically, militarily, diplomatically, politically, and domestically. The president himself has not slept. Everyone in the administration is overwhelmed, overworked, and are making mistakes. That is when the Russians push hard for their own counter offer. At first glance it looks like the Russian negotiators were able to convince their own side to compromise at the last minute (and I do mean last few minutes before the deadline). The American negotiators have been fighting for a settlement since the 72 hour mark and are looking over this latest agreement as quickly as they can. They've been told that finishing the negotiations will get the economic, political, and military issues all simultaneously resolved, so ""make it fucking work!"" They agree to go with it, as long as the deal is done right this second. All parties sign onto the agreement in the last minute as the deadline passes.  The next day, there is still a siege at the federal building, but the Russian contacts are no longer interested. The separatists are basically doing it for themselves. Maybe there are casualties, maybe their aren't. Doesn't matter. Who's going to believe that right wing extremists were working with die hard socialists (and nearly communist dictators) in Russia? The CIA might, but they're too late to react, what's done is done. The markets are recovering, the military aggression is withdrawing, the administration is spinning the diplomatic success, and they are putting more resources towards dealing with the siege. However, the administration has begun to realize that they have actually failed. Buried under the complex language of the last second agreement was a series of amendments that undermine the American diplomatic objectives, and give the Russians a majority of what they wanted. It's a major policy failure, but they are already spinning this as a positive. The CIA is reporting that the Russians may have pushed the separatists into attacking the federal building, that the military maneuvers were not as threatening as they looked, and that the market volatility of yesterday was caused by Russian transactions. They were completely caught with their pants down, but they can't admit to the failure because they've been trying to look not inept since yesterday. So with a well-worn and painted-on smile, the president addresses the media in the press room feigning triumph and trying to hide the knife sticking out of his back.  That's what I would suspect the Russians to do."

Back when I hung out at /r/atheism a lot more, we had a lot of ""I'm an atheist, but I faked a conversion to Christianity so my wife wouldn't bug me about it or leave me over it"" stories.  Also, strange that they're becoming super Christian but don't have a problem living with each other before they're married.   The one tenant was looking up videos on UFOs and came across some end of the world YouTube videos. This has convinced them to be saved.   Well, that's certainly an unorthodox path to take.  Reminds me of a podcast I heard where an atheist was interviewing a Christian, and the reason the atheist gave for not believing in Jesus was ""the Rapture sounds too much like the time I was abducted by aliens."""
conspiratard,3dtxqo,tommysmuffins,4,Sun Jul 19 20:31:34 2015 UTC,"well, that's certainly an unorthodox path to take.   Exactly. The woman told me that planes were circling the USA with nukes about two weeks ago. When I asked her what sources? She said through her research on the Internet.  Of course no real recent news information came up other than some dick waving contest with a russian fighter jet in June.  The new concern is they'll bomb London, and claim a jet carrying a bomb flew over with the intention of dropping it. It turns out the only thing close to that happening was a routine fly over the English channel of an unarmed craft. I am not even sure if this was even that recent.  It would be interesting to see what sources they've come up with. It seems the woman has turned into a bullshit generator herself."
conspiratard,3dtxqo,Stefan_Zhirkov,9,Sun Jul 19 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"Fox News and Youtube.  Youtube is just flat out nonsense.  Fox is a little more subtle.  For example, they get ""experts"" on who discuss the matter as though Iranian long range (intercontinental) nukes are a fait accompli, and then proceed to discuss the matter as though all negotiations must proceed based on that premise.  Then they criticise politicians who are soft on Iran's long range nukes, while never explicitly saying that they exist.  They leave it up to the watcher's imagination to fill in the blanks.  Anyone who dares to question the prevailing wisdom over at Fox is talked over, and his patriotism questioned."
conspiratard,3dtxqo,newtonsapple,11,Sun Jul 19 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"We love to make fun of Fox News and call them stupid, but they're very smart and subtle about changing the narrative.  Kind of like how, in the leadup to the Iraq War, the Bush Administration would keep mentioning Saddam Hussein and 9/11 in the same sentence so the American people would conflate the two, but never explicitly said they were connected.  That way, if they were called on it, they could respond ""We never said that."""

conspiratard,3dtxqo,superprez,4,Mon Jul 20 12:40:12 2015 UTC,"Upon further investigation they seemed to confuse the Iran ballistic missile program with a nuke program. It seems some guy on YouTube said they can arm their ballistic missiles (s-300? Not sure again poor source) with nukes.  I think they confused a standard flyover the English channel as a threat to drop bombs directly on London. They said that a plane armed with nukes was over London, and was magically disarmed. Again unconfirmed ""news"" source.   And an increase in earth quakes/ volcanic activity means end times are nigh folks."

If you don't do either of those then your train of thought isn't just on the wrong track, it's doing barrel rolls in place.  The page doesn't have anything involving actually looking at the sky or looking for this moon. Just reams and reams of references to popular culture and biblical and greco-roman mythology. He's talking about a second moon in the sky! Has he tried actually looking up occasionally while investigating this moon? He even alludes to seeing it in the sky (like in your quote) but never actually talks about it or details how I could find it. It's baffling:   Despite overwhelming evidence, the notion that Earth has a second Moon is sheer “lunacy”, a lunar-derived word which is defined as “insanity” or “madness”.     WHAT evidence?"

One where an arbitrary and capricious decision overrides a plaintiff or a defendant's legal rights simply because some people ""think"" they don't deserve equal protection under the law? (Oh wait, that sounds familiar...)  Look at, for example, the case of Bowman v Monsanto. Read the transcript and not what NaturalNews tells you happened. Bowman got his seeds from the grain elevator (not a common practice because farmers know that's a lower quality of plantable seed), planted them and then used RoundUp to kill everything other than the RoundUp Ready seeds. He was even in communication with them while he was doing this. When you look at the facts of the case, he was kind of trolling them. This is not the case of some poor farmer accidentally growing RoundUp Ready seeds. In fact, it is a matter of record that Monsanto conceded that if Bowman merely took those commingled seeds and planted them, they would have no complaint. That's right. It's a matter of public record, with the Supreme Court, that Monsanto conceded that they have no grounds for complaint if their seed ""technology"" is randomly commingled with other seed stock. They were pressed on this point by the Justices and repeated this point. That's why they don't sue farmers for cross pollination either. Monsanto is not running around using lawsuits as a predatory method for crushing farmers under their heels. If they did, farmers, who apparently are a bit more in the know about Monsanto's real business practices, would simply stop buying seeds from Monsanto. It's really that simple."

Faced with a federal lawsuit, Rinehart had to hire a lawyer. Monsanto eventually realized that “Investigator Jeffery Moore” had targeted the wrong man, and dropped the suit. Rinehart later learned that the company had been secretly investigating farmers in his area. Rinehart never heard from Monsanto again: no letter of apology, no public concession that the company had made a terrible mistake, no offer to pay his attorney’s fees. “I don’t know how they get away with it,” he says. “If I tried to do something like that it would be bad news. I felt like I was in another country.”   I don't agree with GMO labelling because it's all about fear. Unfortunately the way Monsanto treats farmers is also all about fear."
conspiratard,3dq5o2,davesaunders,4,Sun Jul 19 23:42:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, and have you read any other subject matter on the case? When approached, Rinehart testified that he refused to even discuss the matter with the Monsanto reps other than to acknowledge that he was sharecropping and that there was saved seed involved. Rinehart eventually rolled on his brother Tim, who was growing on the same land. The case against Gary was dropped and taken up against his brother Tim...who was growing on the same land in willful violation of Monsanto's clear patent rights. Rights which have since expired which is why there are generic versions of RoundUp Ready Soy entering the seed market. That's hardly predatory.  I have commercial farmers in my family. They choose to buy Monsanto seed because they say they're very easy to work with and the quality of the seed is excellent. In doing so, they make a profit for their families. It's not that hard.  Edit: Removed a quip about the article being from a fashion magazine. You cited a case and that is a valid contribution. #HatTip"

I'm all for constitutional rights and all, even the 2nd for good reasons, mostly because it makes us a death trap for anyone attempting to take us over.   However, with Rights come the duty to exercise those rights responsibly.  Case in point.. the NY prison escape.. they did not take shotguns from the prison. They picked them up from cabins, that were not secured. The guns that is.. gun safe, trigger guard, shells being locked up.. any of those simple responsible gun ownership things would have prevented escapees from getting their hands on weapons...  Guns I agree, unlimited access to guns is not a good idea, unregistered guns are not a good idea, people with mental issues with guns is not a good idea.   People walking around packing heat like we live in the wild west is DEFINITELY not a good idea! CCW and open carry is that..

What are the current background check procedures in the state, and what do you want to replace them with? Too often, these policies are written by people who have no interest in firearms or overtly dislike them and wind up writing in nonsense - I'm in New York, and I supported the SAFE Act (our most recent gun control legislation) until I acquired an interest in guns and began to actually learn the ins and outs of the law and the system it created. It turned out to be absurdly arbitrary, which is not surprising when you consider the people writing it - imagine a class reading syllabus put together by someone who's illiterate.

I believe this started because you made a stupid comparison to banning red cars analogous to banning guns.   Cite one sports injury that didn't involve sports.   But there are rules to limit those injuries when possible (think of roughing the passer or kicker, below the belt hits, boxing gloves made of padding as opposed to steel!)   Cite one dog attack that didn't involve a dog.   And there is massive legislation to mitigate the possibility of attacks. To the point some dog owners must carry massive liability insurance....   You seriously think you are making a point?   Yes I am.. Rights=Responsibility.. and gun owners have been dodging that responsibility for way too long.  This is one bit of legislation should be immediately slapped into practice.. you want a fucking gun you should be in a financial position to compensate any victims of your gun lust... ohh and there are many victims of 'legal gun owners'...  The two kids the old guy lured into his basement so he could kill them (granted they broke into his house but he executed them.. difference between protecting yourself and laying in wait and murder).. or the old guy shot the kids car up because he was playing his music too loud.  Both serving time, both legal firearms bearers.. both should have been able to pay out millions in insurance dollars to their victims...  Like a car, a dangerous dog, a firearm should require insurance.. If you pull out your gun to 'defend yourself' and miss the bad guy and hit me.. I want FUCKING PAID you're not a fucking cop!.. and BTW.. a cop misses the bad guy and hits me, I am getting FUCKING PAID! by the city's insurance.. or my survivors are..

Counting all the people who get shot while ignoring all of the violence avoided by gun ownership is childish.   Red cars are involved in statistically more accidents than other cars. Do you think banning the color of the car would change the behavior of the driver?  Guns are regulated. It is by far the mist regulated constutional right. I'm such a radical for thinking the government should operate within the law.  Was the world a safer place before guns were invented? Only for healthy, young men in groups. Aka gangs. For everyone else it was way, way more dangerous.   But only getting shot counts. Getting beaten, stabbed ect are completely ignored by control tards. Aka you.  Those all go down as gun ownership rises. Along with all kinds of robbery.  Your Logic is completely flawed.  Banning guns will result in fewer shootings. No shit. It will also cost lives."

Accident reports to the government (here in the US, the agency would be the Center for Disease Control) and insurance companies, police, and organizations such as the American Cancer Society lead to analysis on how to minimize costs and casualties caused by such practices.  This used to be a pretty common form of conspiracy theory according to Jesse Walker's The United States of Paranoia The technical term is Pronoia)  Apparently it used to be just as common to accuse the Rosicrucians of secretly maintaining societal order and well-being as it is to accuse the Illuminatti of causing all of society's ""ills"" today."

In this case, no, there really isn't. It's a few (or a lot of) groups who aren't deliberately coordinated all trying to improve the world from their perspective, by issuing suggestions based on the evidence they have. Some even get laws passed or something; witness how many more laws there are against smoking than there were in the Old Days.  The big difference between reality and Conspiracy Theory Land is that, in reality, things happen piecemeal, as different (relatively small) groups get more or less power, and therefore get more or less done. Some of that power is legal, some is more ""soft power""; social influence, people giving you dirty looks, etc.  It's the polar opposite from the grand operatic universe Conspiracy Theorists believe in, where massive forces control everything and nothing happens for a mundane reason.

They must buy all seed from Monsanto).  If you're looking for a specific instance, here you go."

conspiratard,3dj6cv,newtonsapple,8,Fri Jul 17 14:57:40 2015 UTC,"Some relevant portions from the wiki article you linked.   As established in the original Federal Court trial decision, Percy Schmeiser, a canola breeder and grower in Bruno, Saskatchewan, first discovered Roundup-resistant canola in his crops in 1997.[4] He had used Roundup herbicide to clear weeds around power poles and in ditches adjacent to a public road running beside one of his fields, and noticed that some of the canola which had been sprayed had survived. Schmeiser then performed a test by applying Roundup to an additional 3 acres (12,000 m2) to 4 acres (16,000 m2) of the same field. He found that 60% of the canola plants survived. At harvest time, Schmeiser instructed a farmhand to harvest the test field. That seed was stored separately from the rest of the harvest, and used the next year to seed approximately 1,000 acres (4 km²) of canola.   So he never bought any seeds from Monsanto he just discovered that his field had been contaminated somehow and then killed the non Monsanto crops and stored the seeds.  Further down in the article.   All claims relating to Roundup Ready canola in Schmeiser's 1997  canola crop were dropped prior to trial and the court only   considered the canola in Schmeiser's 1998 fields. Regarding his  1998 crop, Schmeiser did not put forward any defence of  accidental contamination. The evidence showed that the level of Roundup Ready canola in Mr. Schmeiser's 1998 fields was 95-98% (See paragraph 53 of the trial ruling[4]). Evidence was presented indicating that such a level of purity could not occur by accidental means. On the basis of this the court found that Schmeiser had either known ""or ought to have known"" that he had planted Roundup Ready canola in 1998. Given this, the question of whether the canola in his fields in 1997 arrived there accidentally was ruled to be irrelevant.   So the reason he got legal action taken against him was because he purposively kept the patented seeds from a previous harvest and planted a field that was 95-98% of that crop. As he has never paid to use the seed and the percentage of the patented crop was so high he had to pay a licensing fee for it.  Sounds pretty fair to me."

In the  mid 1960s the 4th Infantry Division from Ft. Lewis held yearly exercises in the southern portion of Olympic National Forest in Washington state and nearby communities. Civilians were urged to enter in the spirit of things. I was working in a logging camp, Camp Grisdale, that had its own railroad. The Army practiced simulated demolition of rail and road networks, guerrilla and counter-guerrilla operations using regular and Special Forces troops. Terrain was very rugged and mountainous. Some of the my co-workers thought it would be fun to play along, a few got thrown temporarily into ""P.O.W"" cages when they were ""captured"". Nobody got bent out of shape by it, it was strictly a voluntary cat and mouse game that was a welcome break from routine. There was a method to the Army's madness, in 1966 the 4th Infantry was deployed to the Central Highlands of Vietnam where the terrain was quite similar. By then I was at Ft. Riley Kansas, and we had similar, off base training during the formation of the 9th Infantry Division."

The camp has been closed for about 40 years now, the area is now called Wynooche Recreation area after the river of the name. The camp was well known at the time as a very dangerous place to work in what was and is a very dangerous occupation. There were many fatalities there mostly due to the extreme terrain. They were always hiring but we  could count on seeing fatalities every year. One thing that sticks out in my mind in connection with subject, I was once working on a skidding crew that involved pulling massive old growth logs by cable several thousand feet up a 60 degree slope to a landing/loading site. Logs wood dislodge boulders and debris and it would shoot down the mountain at high speed, slabs acting like javelins. One day an Army deuce and a half (2 and 1/2 ton truck) full of troops came moseying along a road below , think they were lost or just sight seeing. Loggers waving and screaming at them to leave, which they didn't do until they were convinced this was no place for them by sheer terror. I bet their uniforms had a bit of extra brown in them after getting away from runaway debris down the mountain.  Here's an old article from the Chicago Tribune describing the camp.  http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-20/news/8503280481_1_camp-seven-logging-timber  Another from C.S.

I'd also like to see a copy of the Constitution that they claim is violated all the time.  The one I am familiar with is chugging along nicely.  Found this on ""Liberty News"":   At first we thought Visner was losing his home because of his own delinquency in payments. This does not appear to be the case. Turns out it was the person he was leasing the property from that stopped making payments on the mortgage for the land.  Perhaps a big risk for Visner to build his dream home on leased land that he doesn’t own? Sure. But should deadly force be used to remove him while he believes he’s still in the dispute timeframe and hasn’t been given due process? Absolutely not.  But Visner’s situation got much worse, and fast. His life was literally destroyed through no fault of his own.   Um, yeah, it is his fault.  He is a bonehead and built his house on property he was leasing.  And these ""Liberty"" fucker don't see the converse of this:  Someone owned that land, and sold it on the promise that payments would be made.  Visner made a deal with someone OTHER than the actual owner.  So, the person who leased to Visner is not being paid, that land now goes back to the original owner.  Let's say that I am a ""Liberty"" guy:  Me:  Well, I sold my land in good faith to this fuck who couldn't make payments.  In the meantime, he leased my land to someone (Visner) who built some structures on my land.  The fuck couldn't pay, so now I move to get my land back.  But this other idiot (Visner) now thinks he has ""ownership"" or ""rights"" to my land!  So, I do the right thing and address this through the courts--the same courts who oversee land transactions in accordance with the laws of the land.  And Visner shows up, thinking he has legal standing when he does not--he built on MY land through and agreement with and individual whose standing regarding MY LAND is null and void due to non-payment.  So now Visner is bitter.  TOUGH SHIT.  It's my land, it belongs to me, and if I don't want you on it I can use whatever force is necessary to get you the fuck off of it!  The last line of ""through no fault of his own"" is so fucking vapid I can't stand it."
conspiratard,3dbfl0,Russell_Jimmy,7,Wed Jul 15 05:33:53 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. Someone in the youtube comments broke it down well.   He can't be making mortgage payments because his name is not on the mortgage loan. What he has is a Land Contract.  Land Contract - Seller's Rights The seller retains a degree of control over the property. Land contracts give most of the rights of ownership to the buyer so the seller has less ability to control the property, but he also gives up the responsibility of being a landlord. However, if the buyer fails to make his payments, the seller can usually cancel or foreclose on the contract. The seller also gets to keep the money that the buyer paid over the life of the rent-to-own arrangement or the land contract.  Land Contract - Buyer's Rights Buyers have fewer rights than they would under a traditional mortgage, since the seller may be able to take the property back more easily. However, buyers have one key benefit under this arrangement -- they don't own the property. If they need to move, if the house needs significant work, or if anything else changes, they can choose to walk away from the contract or option. They'll lose the money that they've put into the house through their payments, but they won't be stuck owning an unsuitable property.  In the end, this would be like renting a house and the landlord is selling the property to be demolished or the property owner defaults. You don't have a choice in what the bank does with the property regardless of how on time your rent payments were or weren't. That is why he doesn't want to talk about this issue. He made a bad business decision and got burned. Now the butthurt ensues as he calls for the second revolution."

He wasn't denied a transcript, and literally says as much in the following sentence! He has to pay for court transcripts, just like pretty much every other county in the US; that shit ain't free and it takes time to put that stuff together for anyone that requests it.  The reason I point this out is because this sort of thing is exactly what's wrong with this guy: he says one thing and immediately reverses course, then throws in random useless tidbits (mostly ""Patriot!"", ""America"", and various other buzzwords) that have either nothing to do with his case...or have everything to do with his case, but he doesn't want to accept it.  I'm somehow more confused and less confused about the situation at the same time. One thing that does appear to be more and more evident is that he thinks getting stuff for free is somehow a ""right"". Second forclosure (both under shady circumstances, no less), refusing to pay vehicle registration (because I guess he wants to drive on public roads for free but not help maintain them), and that CCW denial thing.

Basically, this guy is getting evicted (under circumstances that he claims are shady, but the only sources available that he didn't personally write are the court documents from when he tried to represent himself, which went about as well as you could expect), and he somehow thinks ""defending"" ""his"" property by force is a good idea.  The long story is that, according to him, he signed some kind of land deal (apparently it was something separate from an actual bill of sale) with an employee of the sheriff's office, who later wound up losing the property, and it was repossessed, along with all of Visner's stuff. He later got another property somehow and is getting evicted from it, too. He also stopped paying for his vehicle registration because travel is a ""god given right,"" and he thinks the state has no authority over it.  Oh, and he ran for sheriff himself a few years back.

Obama, wearing a blue sequin tuxedo, does an interpretative dance across the stage as the music rises to a crescendo. In time with the finale, all the guilotines drop and red, white, and blue fireworks shoot off as Obama takes a deep, sweeping bow.

I would consider it extremely plausible that the manufacturer/packager would be willing to invest a little more money in the form of a security strip for the packages destined for higher theft markets.

I had always wondered the hysteria over the communist thing so when given the opportunity I did a school report on 'The Communist Manifesto' by Marx the Communist bible.. though no form of communism ever tried comes close to his theorized utopia.. the reason is communism requires ALL to hold the same value and as we know.. the 'Ruling party' always gets better.  I mean it sounds good in theory, though in practice it sucks.  Though capitalism is right behind it in the inequity factor.. but the difference is there is no possibility of comeup in a communist society.  So here it's rough, but if you say invent 'windows' or 'oxy clean' you can make a come up and become part of the problem instead of a victim of it. :)  Can't get that in communism.."

conspiratard,3d2wef,Ardhen,7,Mon Jul 13 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"It smells like idiots in small town politics, like always.  Except this time one of them is a squatter.  Listen to how he describes his mortgage process:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=163&v=WIN0lNomR6c  He thinks that if a bank bundles and sells the debt of a mortgage, than that mortgage debt is erased. Or as /u/proROKexpat    Basically this is WHAT happened  Man bought a property, his original lender SOLD that debt to another company. Now Ted is under the assumption that since his debt has been sold he can walk away from the debt and he gets to keep the house since his ""bill has been paid for""  However thats not how this works, the owner of his debt may sell it to another company and that company can then start recieving the mortgage payments just as he would have otherwise done. Now they can't change payments/terms/etc (unless its allowed in the contract which will vary by contract)  Basically the guy is trying to game the system and get a house for free. BTW in this video he side ""buy a house for 100k, after 30 years you will have paid back 350k"" in order to achieve that number you would need an APR of like 11% which is high which since he's using that math would indicate to me his credit is shit. For example my dad bought a house, my dad has great credit, he got a 3.5% rate that would come out to a total payment of 161k for 100k assuming he doesn't pay off sooner. (Which he has)   This guy is not serious about martyring himself, I don't think. However, he's still dangerous because he wants to use the power of the police department to push his nonsense."
conspiratard,3d2wef,Gizortnik,4,Mon Jul 13 14:46:46 2015 UTC,"First off, that second link is pure gold.  Second: wait, wait, wait. He was renting the property? Because in the OP Youtube video, he makes it seem as if he was paying some kind of mortgage on it. If he was nothing more than a renter (which is what all the evidence points to), he's got absolutely no claim on the place!  Hmm, I must recalibrate my Crazy Meter, seems to be reading a bit low."
conspiratard,3d2wef,catdumpling,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"Land contract which is basically rent to own.  However, a party can not enter into a rent to own contract with another if the interest in the contracted item divided.  So because the title was not free and clear there could be no legal contract less the mortgage holder also agreed to it.  That however seems to be besides the point as an eviction is likely for non payment."
conspiratard,3d2wef,Ardhen,2,Mon Jul 13 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes a little more sense. Still, it seems like he initially acknowledged that he was a tenant and was paying rent, but the story seems to have changed to him believing he owned the property. Either way, the guy is full of it."
conspiratard,3d2wef,catdumpling,13,Tue Jul 14 05:14:09 2015 UTC,"Something's fucky about this. If he was supposedly under the impression that he was making monthly mortgage payments, surely there's some kind of contract and a stack of paperwork? I've bought one home in my life, and I remember the closing was a good three hours of basically just signing page after page of documents (in triplicate.) I guess my point is that it seems like something should've tipped him off that it wasn't a legit sale. You don't just talk to some random-ass county employee, make a five-minute deal and start sending a monthly check; there would've been all sorts of paperwork involved. The guy is supposedly a custom home builder by trade, so him of all people should be aware of the intricacies of home sales.  Based on what little info is out there regarding this situation, I think I may have an alternate scenario that seems a little more likely: he made some shady deal with a county employee to try and scam a forclosed home. Something happened and his ""partner"" decided to back out of the plan (or something along those lines), but he still wants to keep the property, despite the fact that it doesn't appear that he really has any legal claim to it.  Sure, it's total speculation on my part, and I'm not claiming otherwise. But it would at least explain why he hasn't seemed to have coughed up too many details, despite the fact that this has apparently been ongoing for a couple of years. If he truly has a legitimate claim to the property, and the paperwork to prove it, why not take it to every news outlet in Michigan? I'd be calling every channel in town, every blogger, every news outlet I could think of. If the county was truly engaged in that type of fuckery, that's exactly the sort of story every news outlet would be creaming themselves to publish.  Instead, aside from his YT videos, there's nothing more than a couple of blurbs on a couple Tea Party-ish ""patriot"" websites. Once again, to quoth the almighty Bubbles, ""Something's not right. Something's fucky..."""
conspiratard,3d2wef,catdumpling,14,Mon Jul 13 12:51:34 2015 UTC,Every house I've bought I had to go through a lawyer who writes up all the documents etc..  I've never made monthly payments to a former owner... Never even met any...  Everything is off about his story but it's exactly the kind of nonsense conspiracy theorists love.
conspiratard,3d2wef,Mohammed420blazeit,4,Mon Jul 13 12:58:12 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what I was getting at: when you buy a home, you make payments to a bank, not directly to the former owner/county/whatever. There's a fuckload of paperwork and legalities involved, and everyone wants to cover their asses as much as possible in the event some kind of questions come up. It's sort of the same reason someone paying child support sends the payments to the state rather than directly to their former spouse or children: this way everyone knows that everyone's paying up and getting paid, and there's legal documents to prove it if necessary.  The whole thing just screams scam to me, it's just not clear who was doing the scamming."
conspiratard,3d2wef,catdumpling,8,Mon Jul 13 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"Land contract.. technically it's an illegal contract since the ""owner"" only had partial interest in the house.. which is why no judge will enforce his land contract possession of the house.  Also, sounds like he stopped paying rent from the link I posted and they evicted him clean and clear.. while he might have gotten locked out early he was evicted.  What we're really talking about here is someone that thought he knew the law and he's screwed now.. and he's trying to ""Bundy"" us.. and I'm so fucking sick of this shit!!!!!  I am so fucking pissed that Bundy situation did not end up with apache choppers backing up the fuckign BLM!!!! WTF is the country coming to when every time the conspiritards think they're in the right they try armed insurrection, and we allow it!!!!"
conspiratard,3d2wef,Ardhen,2,Mon Jul 13 13:48:57 2015 UTC,"While I don't share quite the enthusiasm regarding Bundy that you do, I agree with the overall sentiment. As soon as this guy mentioned Bundy, I just rolled my eyes: it didn't have anything to do with Bundy's ranch, it had to do with the fact that he was grazing his cattle on property he doesn't own. Bundy felt he was above the law and didn't have to pay the same fees everyone else has to pay to graze their animals on BLM property. He wasn't asserting his rights, he was just trying to game the system and make himself out to be something he wasn't (a patriotic hero. He definitely did succeed at making himself out to be a racist whackjob, though!)  What I find more interesting about cases like this though is the psychological stuff. Despite overwhelming evidence contrary to Bundy's claim that he had any right to graze his animals without paying fees, he still managed to get a bunch of followers to believe his bullshit and join his side. As far as this Michigan thing is concerned, I have to wonder if Visner really did manage to do some mental gymnastics and convince himself that he legally owns this property, despite appearing to have approximately zero proof to show anyone. It's an interesting phenomenon.  I also kinda wonder if even most of the conspiracy types think he's full of shit. Aside from his Youtube video, I couldn't find more than two or three articles on it (including the one you posted), even though it's been going on since 2013. I mean, it kinda seems like that ilk would've been all over it...and yet, mostly crickets. It'll be interesting to see if it picks up steam after today, since this is when ""something"" is supposed to happen. The guy's gotta be at least a little delusional though if he thinks this is what would start some kind of revolution!  EDIT: derp'd spelling."
conspiratard,3d2wef,catdumpling,2,Mon Jul 13 14:54:36 2015 UTC,Well... I mean it was an armed movement against federal officers.. a 'show of force' would have ended the issue instantly..  The issue becomes when elected officials do not do as they should.. the govern should have deployed the NG the minute the 'militia' they raised went on TV talking about shooting federal officers executing a legal court order.  Instead the conservatives used them as a rallying cry.. of course until Bundy voiced all their unsaid thoughts when he started on with his brilliant speech 'Let me tell you what I know about the Negro'...    The guy's gotta be at least a little delusional though if he thinks this is what would start some kind of revolution!   Quite a few are delusional enough to think they are in the majority and they think all they need a a little action to start the 'revolution' or 'civil war' depending on the flavor of crazy.. they seem to fail to see they are in the minority.. very loud minority but thankfully in these days minority.

The ones often used in labs aren't bred to be ""genealogically identical"" to white people: they're bred from that line simply because they're more resistant to common rat illnesses such as mycoplasmosis. That makes them a better test subject, and the fact that they're often albino is irrelevant. Speaking of which, using pink-eyed white rats isn't generally a prerequisite, and plenty of studies are done with other colors of rat (or mice, or whatever test animals are deemed most appropriate to a specific study.) The idea that lab rats are always albinos is mostly a Hollywood myth, just because it looks better on screen and implies that science-y shit is totally happening for real. Unless the study or experiment centers around genetic traits specific to pink-eyed whites (albinos), the lab probably doesn't give two shits what color their rats or mice are as long as they're sourced from a breeder that specializes in lab-quality animals. In fact, I'd imagine having a variety of colors would make it easier to track specific test animals."

Once you realize that his campaign has pretty much zero chance of getting anywhere, it becomes extremely funny, and you only want him to get even crazier. I would actually love for him to win the republican nomination because it would drive away every single moderate voter and it might even break the back of the Republican party. There's a reason why Daily Show and other comedy programs are just eating this all up.  I want him in to the very end.  The only reason he's getting any support right now is because the ""moderate"" Republican candidate field is saturated with something like a dozen candidates. The people supporting trump likely won't support anyone else so they coalesce around him. As candidates drop out over the next year, his lead will decrease significantly (assuming he doesn't destroy it first with something hilariously batshit)."

He seems completely incapable of saying something that's not really offensive or downright idiotic. There's no way in hell he's going to win the GOP nomination, but at least we can have a laugh at how utterly off his rocker the guy really is.  Here's the thing though: despite the GOP claiming over the weekend that they ""had a word with Trump"" about the not-so-subtle racism (and other batshittery), they probably love the guy. See, people like Trump make all the other options seem less ridiculous by comparison, and you can be damn sure the GOP is going to milk that for all it's worth. Ben Carson and Ted Cruz are both ass-backwards, but they seem pretty damn intelligent by comparison. But as soon as Trump is gone, they'll turn on Cruz, then Carson, and on down the line until they have the candidate who seems the least crazy.  Funniest part? Most of these candidates are probably too dumb to realize they're nothing but cannon fodder and they don't stand a chance in hell because they've already put their foot in their mouths before the election cycle even started."

conspiratard,3cxc6u,Throwaway720i,-5,Mon Jul 13 04:03:43 2015 UTC,Did any of you ever stop and think about how sublimation doesn't occur in water unless there are very special circumstances? It only occurs naturally at temperatures below 0 degrees (Celsius). You can't sublimate snow (solid water) that rapidly with just a lighter that weak. Snow melts. UNLESS it's left at temperatures below the freezing/melting point for a long period of time. We should see water falling from the snow onto the table below with that lighter. You are all bafoons if you think otherwise
conspiratard,3cxc6u,djJazzy_Cheff,6,Sun Jul 12 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"You're right about it not being sublimation, but wrong about everything else.  There is so much information debunking this stupid theory that I'm surprised you haven't seen it (or you are just blatantly ignoring it), but I'll explain it anyway: Snow is mostly air. When you first melt it, it fills in the air pockets and doesn't drip out. This is why the turns darker as the guy is melting it. It's also why he conveniently stops the torch as it gets saturated with water and actually is just about to start dripping.  Source: I've lived with snow every year for over 30 years.

There was a political party that closely represented the Democrats in 1920's and early 30's Germany.  They were called the Social Democrats.  They supported things like the social welfare programs and labor unions.  The Nazis on the other hand were financed by big business and more concerned with acquiring power in order to pursue a horrific social policy than with any practical economic matters.  The Nazis closest political allies were the conservative parties and the Catholic party.  The Social Democrats were Hitler's biggest opposition along with the Communists, and many of their party leaders wound up dying in concentration camps as a result.  The fact that in 21st century America a pro-big business, racist, homophobic, ultra-religious group is comparing anyone to the Nazis, especially the socially minded Democratic party, would be laughable if it weren't so frightening."

He read his piece as he wanted, and when he was finished the SS censors were overjoyed and felt that they had a comrade in him (nothing could have been further).  He details how they had no idea that the whole time he was mocking them.  Also, he describes how Germans viewed themselves, and how at the time Germans could not grasp how the people of other countries did things that weren't necessarily best for Germany.

""Pediatricians are asking children away from their parents, ‘Do you have guns in your house?’ and then reporting this on the electronic health records, and then the federal government, frankly, has access to who has guns and who doesn’t,” Spitzer said in a recent interview.

Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure   Its funny that you have some Christians ignorant of history that actually like him.    You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good? The Islamic religion too would have been more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?   This is very good prediction Hitler makes    The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that's left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.

Furthermore, does sharing a similar idea with Adolf Hitler make you an evil person? Read more at http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/societyquote.asp#tMOmR5YS6TeCktT6.99   Even furthermore. Aren't words and context important?! Hitler was making a veiled argument for the importance of conformity in controlling people. The fake Hillary quote is the simple idea of sacrificing for a greater good. It's not the same thing.   On one hand there's that very simplistic, almost childish idea of Liberty that we have here in American popular culture that just befuddles me. But, what always bugs me too is the chronic un-complication of a complicated issue that internet rhetoric and Con think uses to great mileage - and thereby plagues progressive politics in general. Because nuance is boring, and hard to simplify, and already I've written fare more than that simple, wrongheaded meme did. So the meme wins the short battle.  Meanwhile we hope progress and doing what's right win's the war. Anyways...  I am reminded of something Obama said last year. I think he was speaking to the press or some intelligentsia bemoaning the difficulty of tackling a particular issue (maybe Immigration) and saying ""We need y'alls help in tackling how to present this argument"".   I mean even the president with his power, and influence, and resources looks outside in hopes of how to better shape progressive arguments. I don't have an answer really. It's just so hard to debate when cynical conservative think wins over rubes with simplistic arguments that stick. For now all I can think of is Bernie Sander's re-introducing the forgotten idea of ""it's the right thing to do"" that Democrats shy away from like the indoctrinated cowards they can sometimes be.  It's this constant battle versus simplistic ideas of liberty and capitalism. Whereas Europe got past this years ago we've still yet to decide what we're going to do as a country and I feel we're in this rut as a society because of it. My hope is that younger generations don't adhere to this overly simplistic nationalism and patriotism that tends to keep us so far behind in social progress. Who knows what the future holds? The bullshit machine is certainly not as effective in the Information Age but there's disinformation as well so I don't know how it will all weigh out in the end.

We must have printed out tens of thousands of pages and gone over every major book on the subject that was in our university's stacks, (we didn't have to read them all as we could essentially toss a text aside if it relied on any major logical fallacy on it's face). All the best ones relied on this kind of argument- claims of an inside source (either in the Intelligence, Soviet, or Mafia world) that couldn't be identified and had to be taken as valid based on the author's claims.  It's like throwing an extra variable (like ""The Ether"" or ""God"" or ""Magic"") into a scientific equation. Once you have an unaccountable, unquestionable outside set of claims that can act upon the known and proven facts however it would like you can change the meaning of all of those facts."

Pepper also repeated the claim, which Sirhan's lawyers had previously stated, that Sirhan's mind was ""programmed"" and then ""wiped"" by an unknown conspiracy behind the assassination which is why Sirhan has no memory of the murder or of the aftermath.

We can clearly see sheep on the face of the desk, worshiping a pope or heavenly figure. Notice on the left side, one of the sheep seems to be reaching a... human hand, towards the central figure. Yes, we are considered ""sheeple"" by the ""elite"", because we blindly obey them and follow their lead, just like a flock of sheep.   I just...what is...huh?  Are we just going to ignore that shepherding is a common theme in the bible? For fucksake, Christ even refers to his followers as his flock.    In this sculpture, Pope Gregory XIII sits on his throne, while the person on his left lifts the veil beneath Gregory's throne and uncovers a... reptile. This reptilian entity is the dark power behind all of the world's leaders and the source of their ""royal"" blood.   Or, and this might be crazy talk, it's a fucking dragon, you know, the one that's depicted in the House of Borghese's Coat of Arms?   Remember the Borghese? One of the most powerful and influential noble houses in Rome? Hell, Camillo Borghese became pope in 1605. Images of their Heraldry (a crowned eagle and a dragon) can be found all over the place.    Reptilian figure hiding in the shadows; In symbolism: the throne of power rests on the shoulders of the reptiles; The winged reptilians are superior to the rest of the reptilian species, representing a royal branch;   Ooor, as I said before IT'S A FUCKING DRAGON, and surprise, this one represents Pope Gregory XIII's heraldry, because HE was of the Boncompagni family and THEY have a dragon on their coat of arms too! In fact, it was Boncompagni's coat of arms that inspired the Borghese to adopt the dragon symbol into their own heraldry.   I can't read any more, my brain is going to start leaking out of my ears."

And fear of Catholic takeover and the Pope being (or at least being in league with) the Antichrist was a solid part of Anglo-American politics for centuries that only really ended after World War 2.  And then you have the Jack Chick-style insanity in which the Pope takes marching order straight from Satan himself (and oh yeah the Catholic Church invented Islam and then it invented Communism and then it invented Naziism just for fun too). That's more rare, if only because you have to be truly insane to believe any of it.

conspiratard,3cpfmt,mirshe,3,Fri Jul 10 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"I think in Chickworld the way it works is this:  The Catholic Church is really in league with Satan, and so it invents all kinds of things to destroy Christianity. It invented Communism in order to subvert Christianity in Europe, but then the Vatican realized that the Communists were threatening to destroy their power, so they invented the Nazis in order to keep the Communists in check.  As far as conspiracy theories go, it's pretty bland, but it is consistent, because everything bad in the world ultimately goes back to the Pope and his boss, the Devil.  My personal favorite Jack Chick comic is the one in which it's revealed that Christian Rock music was invented by the Devil, too. Its only rival in my book is the one in which a random white Christian dude and his son are walking around in a predominately Muslim country, see a bunch of Muslims praying, and the dad just starts insulting them about their ""moon religion"" and telling them the truth about how it was invented by the Pope."

Like that's been swimming around in the aether about D&D since the 80s, and Chick's take on it is no different from any other fundie D&D nonsense.  To really savor Jack Chick, you have to read the stuff that sets him apart from other fundamentalist Christians. And that's the conspiracy garbage. I like the one about the Tribulation or whatever, when apparently the school uniform is now a hitler youth costume and elementary school students' homework is to bring a pet to class to sacrifice to Satan."

conspiratard,3co4lz,MRB2012,9,Sat Jul 11 05:16:47 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised the the ""AIDS is a creation of the US Government to decimate the African American community"" conspiracy didn't make the list.  Its totally nuts, but once you learn about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment its ... still nuts, but you could see how someone could believe it."
conspiratard,3co4lz,ultraswank,9,Thu Jul 9 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the US government didn't create syphilis and even in that case they didn't go out and specifically infect people with it - they just were very unethical in that they didn't actually treat the patients when there was an actual proven treatment that they could have used.   It's remotely believable, if there were any evidence to support it, that the US government could have done things to allow AIDS to spread. In fact Reagan refused to admit that it existed and that did result in many deaths.   The primary thing that I wouldn't really believe about that one is that the US government created the HIV virus."
conspiratard,3co4lz,AstrangerR,2,Thu Jul 9 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, I'm not saying it proves it in any way, its just instead of leaping to a dozen incorrect assumptions you only need leap to about half a dozen. More importantly for me I went from thinking that people who believe it are borderline schizophrenic to instead just thinking they're deeply misinformed and suffering from confirmation bias on a mistrust of the government.  A distrust that is based on actual evidence."
conspiratard,3co4lz,ultraswank,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:32:24 2015 UTC,"The problem with #1 is that it still requires an active conspiracy by the US government to hide the truth, unless you believe that an AR15 fired a 6.5mm cartridge that was found by the autopsy on the day of the shooting.  And in fact, believing it to be an error by the SS requires the conspiracy to be a bigger deal, because it means that in the couple of hours between the shots being fired and the autopsy they had to manage to erect the conspiracy and cover-up; whereas other theories required the government to erect the cover-up over weeks/months prior to the event."

You are likely a Secret Service agent too. An AR-15 going off right next to you is something you'd notice. Why is it that no one dived on this guy? Wrestled the gun off him? How did they know it was a mistake? Did they decide in that millisecond to start the coverup by acting cool? Why does the footage show no one in the follow up car doing anything out of the ordinary? Why do zero witnesses in Dealey Plaza claim to have seen this happen, despite the fact it took place in front of dozens of people only feet away?  There are a billion gaping holes in that stupid theory. Which is why it is ignored."

Crazy lady's theory the italian mafia is involved..  or the follow up interview at the end where it just get stupid...  I mean.. it really shows the mentality of the truthers.... lets roll with it.. their premise is correct.. the government created a big cover up and elaborate hoax of SH shooting...  Why on gods green earth is there any logical reason to believe that the government would provide any proof it's a hoax?  I mean.. everything he asked for (work orders, signatures blah blah blah) would be easy to fabricate after the fact. It would take more of an expert than halbig would ever pay for to prove even a printed signature is fake.. especially since the copy they receive would by definition a copy of the original.  In other words, without the actual factual original document to examine there is no way for a handwritting expert to tell the difference between an original signature and a printed out copy of  a pasted signature from elsewhere.  At this point you have a logic tree form (sadly I doubt that conspritards know how that works)    premise is wrong, there was a shooting, no hoax government is smart enough to pull off hoax, is smart enough to cover all the bases.    Since both 1 and 2 lead to the same place (there's no point in looking through official channels they'll be closed) the conspiritards fall back onto option 3 which is not really a logical option.

If Obama was born in Kenya , he would not have been a citizen at birth. At the time of Obama's birth, and under his parents circumstances, US citizenship was only transmitted from mother to child if the mother had lived in the US for ""a period of ten years, five after the age of fourteen"". Obama's mother gave birth to him when she was 18, so she would not have met this requirement, thus denying Obama US citizenship at birth. Source  This is all irrelevant, as he was born in the US obviously. But it would have been arguable with a pretty decent case that were he born in Kenya he would not be a US citizen."

Take this fellow for example, who was simultaneously both an Illuminati member and Archbishop of Salzburg.  It's sad but Jewish exclusion was the norm for German, and indeed European society at that time. Consider for instance the fact that before the Jewish emancipation movement, in many states Jews were confined to living in ghettos in a sort of quasi-apartheid system. They were generally poor and uneducated, excluded as they often were from universities, professional guilds or political office.  In conclusion, the Illuminati probably based their anti-Jewish policy on  matters of class and socio-economic prejudice as much as religious intolerance."

He says the public has a right to know whether government employees are part of the masonic conspiracy because “as a secret establishment club, Freemasonry rightly rings alarm bells. By seizing only a handful of key positions in the criminal justice system, like any unscrupulous interest, it could corrupt the entire caboodle. The other nerve-jangling concern is that Freemasonry's ‘Don’ just happens to be a little too close to one the top figures in Britain's military and judicial chain-of-command; UGLE’s Grand Master, Prince Michael of Kent, is Queen Elizabeth II's cousin.” (UGLE is the United Grand Lodge of England, the governing body for England’s Freemasons, in case you’re wondering.)

No, you didn't miss anything new, because ""race realism"" or racism or whatever you want to call it was scientifically accepted until quite recently.

I am proud to say as a jew, many jews were among the early and most influential dissenter, most notably anthropologist Franz Boaz (""father of modern anthropology""). However, what is considered normal today, was considered ludicrous just 60 years ago, things have changed very quickly, you need to keep that in mind when looking at scientific racism.  Its not a conspiracy theory that IQs differ along ethnic lines, very significantly so. Average IQs go from 107-110 in northern Europe and NE Asia, to about 65 in large areas of Africa, and even lower when you get to the African pygmy and the Australian Aboriginal. There are similar differences in standardized tests of all sorts. And IQ has been well demonstrated to predict future achievement. There is nothing controversial about the data itself - the causes of these disparities are what are debated. This is really the debate between Marxist philosophy and fascist philosophy, each claims one end of the absolute spectrum. Marxists say there is no biological difference at all, everyone is exactly the same. Fascists say every single person and race are unequal biologically, and culture is a mere product of biology.

It's the same with this ""race realism"" debate i.e. Do ""races"" differ in ""intelligence"" because of their ""race""... on ""average"". Until we define biologically what a race actually is, then figure out how to differentiate between them (if there is a difference at all), and then map the brains and prove that NE Asian brains are superior to White (Slavic? Mediterranean? Nordic? which ""white"" by the way?) brains it's, guess work at best. What we can say for sure is that environment plays a part in human development. That's a fact.

I feel this approach- looking at the larger ecosystem of conspiracy theories- is the best because it gives you an overview of the underlying fears and paranoias that characterize conspiracy theories as opposed to real, actual conspiracies. It also doesn't rely heavily on the Logical Fallacies, which are useful for understanding where conspiracy theorists fall short of being critical thinkers but fail to be convincing to many people due to how abstract and Philosophy based Logic is."

As far as I remember, this claim was originally based on a record some birther discovered which indicated someone with a name similar to one they associate with Obama (Soetoro, I think) getting foreign college aid. The record is from when Obama was like 2 years old. Also, Obama went to highschool in the US, and thus could not qualify for foreign college aid, but whatev.   First President to preside over a cut to the credit-rating of the United States.   True. Of course, the credit-rating downgrade was explicitly explained by the issuers as being the result of Republican legislators screwing things up, but again whatev.   First President to spend a trillion dollars on ""shovel-ready"" jobs when there was no such thing as ""shovel-ready"" jobs.   I take it he's never heard of FDR?   First President to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space.   The lack of a vehicle to take over for the overworked and superannuated shuttle fleet was the result of decisions made years and even decades before Obama took office. But he was in the oval when the cows came home to roost, so totes his fault, yo.   First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (AZ, WI, OH, IN).   Unless you believe all prior presidents who took legal action against a state of the union managed to avoid taking the oath of office, obviously untrue.   First President to actively try to bankrupt an American industry (coal).   Pretty sure Lincoln's spirited attempt to bankrupt the cotton industry predates Obama.   First President to hide his medical, educational and travel records.   Again, when it comes to hidden medical records, has he not heard of FDR (assuming for the nonce that this claim is true, which its not)?"

conspiratard,3cfkjz,BarkingToad,7,Tue Jul 7 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"Day naming is hella complicated.   That's the honest truth, but it appears I was mistaken, in that the day is named for either Frigg or Freya (rather than Frey, her brother). It makes sense that there would be confusion over which one of them, since it seems fairly obvious from the mythology that the two characters were originally one (especially given the Brisingagamen mythos, wherein Odin/Wotan was married to Freya, with no mention of Frigg)."
conspiratard,3cfkjz,JJFO,4,Tue Jul 7 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"The name definitely comes from Frigg, in Old English Friday literally meant Frigg's day. However we don't know anything about that Goddess because the Anglo-Saxons didn't write much before they were Christian (Bede had memories of Pagans when he was a child, but was Christian his whole life). The Norse Sagas were written centuries later by a different (though related) group of people, so the allusions have to be taken with a grain of salt. All we know about her is that the Romans thought that  she was Venus (though they thought Woden was Mercury for some weird reason), and she's in all likelihood related to Frigg/Freya."

They constructed a basic wooden perimeter tower to shoot at, fired the cannon at it, and then blew it up right before the cannonballs hit.  I can't make this up. Two cannonballs, joined by about eight feet of chain, about to make contact with the front left support struts when the top section goes up in a massive amount of flame, followed by what would have been secondary explosions randomly coming from... nails...

This is not a thing that ""everyone"" agrees on. It's really difficult to argue a historical 'what-if' as if it's accepted fact, because after a certain point, you're relying on evidence from an alternate timeline. And in the world we live in--there's no evidence to suggest that slavery in the US, which was massively profitable and increasingly so by 1860, would have died out any time soon unless slaveholders were forced to end it. Really wish this guy would stick to science."

As a contrasting example, Down's syndrome is named after a doctor who studied it, and this is often shortened to Down syndrome or just Down's. But no one says ""Lyme's disease"".

There is no viable flat earth theory because it fails badly to account for what we observe. All theories are worthless by default until they can be shown to account for what we see. After that it's a contest for how accurate and simple the theories are. But if they're going to hold a position without evidence or even in spite of evidence they can be ignored without further argument. I know that you're looking for a video or set of arguments, but it's a little annoying to debunk such an evidence-free claim. It's worthless by default until they can show that a flat earth theory can account for what we see.   As an example of another annoying claim to debunk, do you have any good videos/blogs to debunk the theory of mushrooms being created by forest fairies as furniture?  If there's a specific argument used to claim that the Earth is flat that you'd like cleanly debunked or accurately explained that might be better.  Here's one quick question to show how easily a flat earth theory falls apart when you actually check whether it accounts for what we see: If the Earth is flat, why can't you see the North Star (Polaris) from Australia?  EDIT: I think the basic problem is that people that believe in a flat earth generally don't need certain arguments or evidence to be presented to them - they need some lessons in how evidence and reasoning work in the first place. They don't need to be beaten in a game, they need a lesson in how to play at all."

And in that system (tracking Earth's rotation against the other stars rather than against the sun), what you suggest is indeed true.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time   Briefly, sidereal time is a ""time scale that is based on the Earth's rate of rotation measured relative to the fixed stars""[1] rather than the Sun.      Because the Earth orbits the Sun once a year, the sidereal time at any given place and time will gain about four minutes against local civil time, every 24 hours, until, after a year has passed, one additional sidereal ""day"" has elapsed compared to the number of solar days that have gone by.   That means that after half a year has passed, half of a sidereal day extra has passed compared to the solar days. At that point it's solar noon at sidereal ""midnight"" (which isn't really an appropriate term since sidereal time isn't tracking the relative position of the sun), assuming you started with the solar and sidereal days synched up."

But I have answered your question.  ""Answered too quickly?"" It's simply because I already knew the answer. How does answering quickly imply that I'm wrong? I already knew about sidereal time and just had to look up the reference.  This is what I meant when I said that people that believe in a flat earth don't need better evidence or arguments presented to them. They need to improve their ability to reason.  Again, if I'm wrong, show me where. Otherwise your question stands answered."

Sidereal is star positions... Has zero and zip, nada, to do with solar time.  The Earth is not a tilted globe because it cannot be claimed it holds that tilt in space around solar orbit when at the same time this would cause any given clock and sun matched orientation to drift and completely invert every six months.  Can't have our cake and eat it too..."
conspiratard,3ccgdt,BoojumG,4,Tue Jul 7 19:23:32 2015 UTC,"But you yourself are not reasoning, you're just regurgitating some fact you remember being taught to win an internet point.   No, I understand the concept of sidereal time, and that's why it came to mind in response to your question. It's literally the answer to your confusion. You're confusing solar days and sidereal days.   Sidereal is star positions... Has zero and zip, nada, to do with solar time.   The problem is that you're making expectations based on sidereal days and then mixing up solar and sidereal days when you check the time of day. The sun is overhead at solar noon all year round because that is how the length of a solar day is defined. The effect on the length of the day due to the Earth's orbit is automatically included. But the length of a sidereal day does not include the effect of the Earth's orbital motion, because it is based on tracking the stars. That's why the position of the sun at a given time of sidereal day changes over the year, but the sun is always as overhead as it is going to get in the middle of the solar day, because that's what a solar day means.  If you define the length of a day based on how long it takes the apparent position of the stars in the sky to return to their original position, that's a sidereal day. And indeed, the position of the sun in the middle of a sidereal day will change over the year. You had the insight to note that. You say ""why doesn't this happen"", and the simple response is ""it does!""   But when you make one expectation based on the sidereal day and then confuse that with the solar day, you see a contradiction. But it's not in anything being wrong with a ""spinning globe orbiting the sun"" model of the solar system. It's that you are confusing solar and sidereal days.  I can explain in more detail or in other ways if you like, but I'm more certain than ever that confusing sidereal and solar days is exactly where you've made a mistake."

I'm afraid you have a little problem called ""clocks"", you know the mechanical, electric, and atomic tools we use to synchronize with the sun returning to noon every day?  Yeah those don't adjust to the Earth moving through its fictional solar orbit as the original noontime orientation would in principle be turning ever further away from the sun with every passing day after summer solstice."

Its in every man's nature to hunt protect and provide, Its in every women's nature to nurture siblings, This is how humanity survived and evolved for over 200,000 years and we still have the same mentality today its hardwired into our genes. Its easy to understand why women are attracted to status, strength and power because that is man in his natural form and displays the ability to hunt protect and provide.

His ex didn't even care if their kid was going to school or not, and just let her stay home when ever she wanted, this has left her years behind her peers both educationally and emotionally. He finally got full custody for her when she came over for their weekends and she smelled so bad and she was crying about how much she rather live with him(what has always been her wishes all along). Turned out that days before their water and power had gotten turned off for non payment. He took her to school on Monday like always, went to his ex's and said that enough was enough to her and for the sake of their daughter she was coming home with him then on or he was calling CPS and she'd be going with them. And this is all because the MO courts pretty much auto-awards mothers their children unless something major is wrong with them, and then it's a massive up hill battle to get them with their fathers, even if the father is clearly the better choice.   What really helped him out during this was the support of local MRA, they helped him with legal fee's big time."

It's just the standard way hard core conservatives view the world. When you add conspiracy into the mix, it just gets crazier.   Regarding propaganda, again precisely the opposite is true: they are chronically susceptible to propaganda and have extremely limited ability to discern fact from fantasy. The key is their refusal to rely on evidence. Conspiracy theorists believe what they do despite the absence of evidence. Normal people don't operate this way, at least not as seriously.

conspiratard,3c2bsf,MrBleach,9,Sat Jul 4 19:15:56 2015 UTC,"I've long suspected that it's not merely coincidence that people who share the mindset you seem to present here also seem to demonstrate less-than-exemplary language skills. Your minimally adequate writing indicates that you haven't invested yourself in a lot of quality writing, even as you may have wallowed a great deal in vast amounts of comparatively poor writing.  Good, credible sources of knowledge are customarily well-written. It's a hallmark of good information that it's presented in high quality. Poorly presented information should be suspect for that reason alone, though of course no one feature condemns anything by itself; but it's a very good clue, usually validated by just a little investigation.  Related, people who read good writing tend to be good writers themselves, as writing is a skill learned best by experience of reading. (According to most accomplished writers, anyway, and I can't imagine they have reason to make that up.) So a person who writes poorly can credibly be surmised to have probably not read a lot of quality source material. Which by logical extension renders everything they say suspect. By which I don't mean suspicious, merely that one can't put good faith in their knowing what they're talking about.  I'm genuinely sorry. I know you're sincere and that you mean well, and I also presume that you're a good person. But I can't accept what you say, since it's supported only by your rather poor writing. It doesn't present well, and is unconvincing. Paired with a complete dearth of anything like verifiable facts, it's just one person's baseless perspective, and has no forensic value. I wish you luck in the future."

If this is about 'covering up' information, what information are we talking about exactly? It can't be anything related to their careers in ""alternative"" medicine, because they have had free ability to post information from any studies they've done over their careers for years and years now. If anything were going to be suppressed or covered up it's way too late.  Now, if the three of them comprised all the authors of a single half-finished study at the time of their deaths and all their unpublished data had suddenly gone missing at the same time as their unusually coincident deaths, that might be a different story.   But this? You might as well catalog all the evangelical Christian pastors/leaders who died in the past several months, paint each death as ""suspicious"" or ""connected"" with no basis in evidence, and then claim this is proof of a government suppression of evangelical Christians.

The second guy had a website for his practice and an obituary online (which doesn't list a cause of death), but I couldn't find anybody reputable reporting on his murder or anything. Some sites like Infowars are reporting that he was found in his car under ""mysterious circumstances,"" but I take that with a big grain of salt. It could have been a murder, a suicide or a natural death.   The first doctor was found with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. Authorities are treating it as a suicide. His practice had been raided by the Feds and they're speculating he might have known he was in big trouble.  So it looks like there was one murder, one suicide and one ""mysterious"" death. My heart goes out to all of their families, but at this point it looks like a sad coincidence or at most a lone wackjob who murdered two alternative doctors; there's nothing to suggest any kind of government conspiracy or anything."

I understand rifles and shotguns, my grandfather is a farmer, but as I grow older I am having much less patience for semi-automatic and automatic weapons and even handguns like revolvers.  Crappy things just happen around guns. I don't care if guns don't kill people, it is just really easy to kill people with guns, take them away and it becomes just that much harder to kill other people. Obviously murder will still exist, it always has, but it is so much more personal (and I would assume harder, I dunno I have never committed a murder) when you do it with a knife. Honestly I have grown up in a family that supports gun rights and I am just finding it very hard to justify a pro-gun stance these days."

conspiratard,3br2oh,Etherius,3,Thu Jul 2 10:03:27 2015 UTC,"""Against their will"" is a matter of degree.   If a family can't avoid public school, their kids will eventually be taken away from them for educational neglect (and probably other things, too -- after all, where are the children while they're at work?) Then the children will, as part of their care in state custody, be given their vaccinations. That's the system you say you support already.    Well, heck, I may have just convinced you out of requiring vaccinations for public school attendance.   But there are other ways the state enforces compliance without jail. There are fines, licenses, benefits, etc. Maybe you can't get tax breaks without a vaccination; maybe places like Disney World start requiring proof of vaccinations ... I'm not entirely sure what the ideal solution is, especially since anti-vaxxers are so obstinately stupid it sounds like SWAT teams are going to have to ram their doors open and steal their children Elian Gonzalez style, or post snipers with tranquilizer darts filled with vaccine outside their homes (hey, there's a solution!).   Up to now it's been an easy ride to righteousness for the anti-vaxxers. But I bet that as social and government pressure mounts, as people really have something substantial to lose for not vaccinating their kids, the attitude will start to change."

Are we eventually going to require people get the Gardisil shots?"
conspiratard,3br2oh,Etherius,3,Thu Jul 2 12:57:10 2015 UTC,"Something from the last exchange: herd immunity. Vaccinations aren't 100%. And not everyone can get them -- some people are too young. Herd immunity is when enough people are immune that the disease can't spread; if it can't spread, it can't get close enough to the vulnerable population to infect them.   Here's the breakdown of the Disney spread:   Here's a breakdown of the Disney group:    Out of 52 confirmed measles cases reported in 7 states, including California, the CDC said that 51 were epidemiologically linked to visitors or contacts of visitors to the popular Disneyland entertainment park. Of the 52 measles cases identified by Jan. 21, 2015 in people aged from 10 months to 57 years, eight (15%) were hospitalized; 28 (55%) were unvaccinated; 6 (12%) were vaccinated and four had received two or more MMR shots; 5 (9%) were too young to receive MMR vaccine and 17 (33%) had an unknown vaccination status.20   It's hard to draw a solid conclusion from 33% being unvaccinated, but if we throw them out of the data set, you see the majority of the kids are willfully unvaccinated, spreading to a few kids that are vaccinated and too young to vaccinate. Fifty five kids! That's a lot of spreading measles around.   That is exactly why vaccinations are so important for everyone to take (or at least enough people). It was OK when it was just Jehovah's Witnesses; but now that the anti-vax movement is becoming popular, it is a true threat to herd immunity, and that puts everyone's child at risk.     Measles kills 150,000 people globally a year. It doesn't kill as many people in the United States because a) vaccines and b) vaccines c) vaccines d) medical care is good enough to handle the symptoms and e) vaccines.   I also don't know if ""death"" should be the standard we go by. If people are going to the hospital for a week, I think that's also a problem.   CDC on Chickenpox:  Chickenpox (varicella) used to be very common in the United States before the chickenpox vaccine became available in 1995. In the early 1990s, an average of 4 million people got chickenpox, 10,500 to 13,000 were hospitalized (range, 8,000 to 18,000), and 100 to 150 died each year. Most of the severe complications and deaths from chickenpox occurred in people who were previously healthy. Each year, more than 3.5 million cases of varicella, 9,000 hospitalizations, and 100 deaths are prevented by varicella vaccination in the United States.   So almost all vaccinations are targeted towards preventing the spread of disease among people who can't guard against it.   Gardasil is sort of a departure from that logic, since nobody is making anyone put their genitals together -- nobody but millions of years of evolution and raging hormones -- but I don't think it's a radical departure. It's still a disease contracted from someone else. Is it something we need to force kids to have? Probably not; unless elementary schools are scheduling orgies third period, it's not going to travel far."

Your argument is flawed because this is not an issue of individual rights but of public health.  In 1854, Dr John Snow discovered, as a result of cholera outbreak in Broad Street London, that cholera was spread by contaminated water.  This lead to the construction of better sanitation facilities which we now take for granted.  Dr Snow used evidence to show that this would eliminate a disease that affected the whole population.  If today, a government authority decided to just run pipes from the local river to people's houses without proper water management and sanitation, there would be an outroar.  Yet, it appears that when we have inontrovertible evidence about the solution to avoiding the spread of diseases such as polio, measles, small pox etc., which requires everyone to be vaccinated, suddenly it's a matter of people being forced to do something that is for the common good."

You know the mercury content in tuna is MUCH MUCH higher.. hmm lets see...   According to FDA analysis in 2005, tuna fish contains 0.64 micrograms of mercury for each gram of tuna. A 60 gram portion (about two ounces) would contain 38.4 micrograms of mercury. By contrast, vaccine manufacturers using thimerosal (a mercury containing compound) as the preservative are adding between 12.5 and 25 micrograms of mercury per dose of vaccine. Although children get multiple doses of vaccine, they eat far more tuna fish! Even the recommendations for pregnant women to eat no more than one portion of tuna fish per week exceeds the amount children would get in vaccines if thimerosal were still in use.    http://www.princetonol.com/family/columns/pedgroup55.html  The point of my rant is and will always be, there is NO scientific foundation to fear mercury in vaccines.. there NEVER FUCKING WAS!!!

It's not really a license in the same way as a driver's license or liquor license. Most (if not all) government issued licenses are to regulate potentially-dangerous activity, they revoke the license if you break the relevant laws.  Marriage is a state of being.

conspiratard,3bt79g,Lorgramoth,3,Wed Jul 1 23:12:00 2015 UTC,"Quoting it for science.   This FBI-created movie “Idiocracy” (and by “FBI-created” I mean that the FBI planted ideas and dialogue into Mike Judge’s mind using radio wave/halo-based technology) is what the FBI thinks of Americans and the leaders in America and as a whole, represents the state of society that the FBI created using radio wave/halo-based mind-controlling technology and controlled mass media in order to dumb down the American (as well as European) population. Notice the pizza on the table in the attached clip – this is part of the FBI’s brainwashed mantra to “red” “halo-ed” disciples that all people need is “pizza” and mindless “group love” to be happy. Also, notice the reference to “watering crops” – yet another of the FBI’s sociopathic, self-aggrandizing allusions to the human race as “plants” and “crops” that the FBI must “water” and “cultivate” and a mocking and condescending allusion to the FBI’s purposeful dumbing-down of human beings. Also note the use of the word “electrolytes” in conjunction with “plants” and “crops” – this is a reference to radio wave/halo-based mind-controlling “electricity” being used on the “plants” (people) and “crops” (generations of people).  “Idiocracy” also contains strong anti-capitalist, anti-corporate themes throughout the movie – the most prevalent one being that the fictional corporation Brawndo has brainwashed people and strong-armed the government into replacing water with a sports drink – the underlying message being that people are too stupid to make “correct” personal consumption and stock purchasing decisions and that the government should highly regulate (and ultimately replace, as it currently has done in reality using radio wave/halo-based mind-controlling technology) all economic decisions in society. Anti-masculine, anti-womanly, anti-military, anti-US, anti-capitalist, pro-communist, pro-centralized government-decision-making messages pervade the movie – essentially implying that a “smart” cabal such as the FBI should take control of and run society.  Notice the two “dinosaurs” towards the end of the attached ""Idiocracy"" clip – one with a Nazi flag and the other with a United States flag. The socialists and communists of the late nineteenth and early 20th century set their sights on all major industrialized countries - Russia, Europe, including Germany, and the United States before turning to China and then to smaller countries throughout the world, planning World War 1 and World War 2 to manipulate world events and slowly move the world towards a single world communist state. The communists’ biggest obstacles were determined early on to be the historically “masculine” and “warlike” independent-thinking capitalist nations such as Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States - in other words, countries whose governments would not easily fall to communism but would instead be more susceptible to fascism. The Nazis appear more and more to have been a planned step of the world communist intelligentsia in eliminating the resistance of all countries they believed would be a significant threat to their plan for a worldwide communist state. Like America, Germany was originally a democratic, intellectual, masculine, gun-rights advocating nation – qualities the communists and fascists within the FBI (and most likely, the original communists they are heirs to) deem a threat to a centrally-controlled, technological oligarchy with the purported face of ""worker's rights"" and ""equality.""  World War I (which led to The League of Nations), World War II (which which led to The United Nations), and the Vietnam War (which led to the The War Powers Resolution) were purposely planned and used as communist world state-building events and generational psychological propaganda intended to undermine democracy, individual rights, individual nations’ rights, and to instill fear of “masculinity” and a fear of independent-thinking Caucasian males (first the Germans, the Italians, and now American Germans, American Italians, American Irish, and other European American ethnicities - Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Kiefer Sutherland being propagandized examples of Austrian, Italian, and German white male masculinity to be feared and “bred out” of humanity) and Asian males (particularly the Japanese). Essentially, the message of the communists has always been that masculinity and freedom are racist and “unfair” and should be eliminated – bred out of mankind like wolves being bred into domesticated dogs – and until then, at least controlled and modified in nature using radio wave/halo-based technology by the more “intellectually-evolved” “non-masculine” communist intelligentsia in the FBI and their mind-controlled disciples. The current tactic furthering ""communist domestication"" has been the orchestration of all mass-shootings and school-shootings by the FBI and their communist mind-controlled disciples in order to enact gun control laws that are meant to make resistance and rebellion to a world-wide communist state difficult to negligible.  The FBI and their communist brethren have been setting up the United States in the minds of the public as the next warlike Nazi Germany to “take over the world” and the last “threat” to a worldwide “communist paradise” which will be ruled by a self-appointed intellectually elite through a technological oligarchy that uses radio wave/halo-based mind-controlling technology to manipulate political decisions, enact new laws, control economies, engage in selective and forced breeding, and guarantee that it will have absolute power indefinitely – that is, as long as the technological oligarchy secretly maintains and grows their broadcast towers, databases, information monopoly, and hold over human beings – particularly lawmakers, local police, and national military – and abolishes private gun rights or minimizes gun rights to the point of them not being a threat to the fascist technological oligarchy's control.  Not only has the FBI and communist intelligentsia been setting up the United States to be the next Nazi Germany by painting the U.S. as a “masculine” white imperialist nation bent on conquering the world by war and a “threat to world peace” because of its military and nuclear superiority, they have been setting up the next Adolf Hitler to be the “excuse” for the US Presidency to be abolished and the U.S. Constitution to be replaced by a communist one and as an excuse for setting up the United Nations to be the façade of a communist world government to which all nations must be subservient. In reality, the communist, fascist FBI would be controlling and manipulating world events, carefully planning the course of humanity half a century in advance (with longer-term, permanent, communist slavery of humanity – what they have been selling as “paradise” to their disciples – as their ultimate goal using radio wave/halo-based mind-controlling technology and mass media as their means for control (à la “The Matrix” and “The Adjustment Bureau”)).  In the attached “Idiocracy” clip, the two Tyrannosaurus rexes attacking each other, one with a United States flag, the other with a Nazi flag, with the audio “tried to take over the world,” represent Germany and America as capitalistic, freedom-loving, independent, masculine “dinosaurs” – democracies that would inevitably turn into imperialistic dictatorships – that needed to be replaced by an “enlightened” communist one-world government – symbolized by the United Nations – that would lead the way to a “peaceful” world where everyone was “happy, but dumb” – and would therefore need to be run by more “highly-evolved” and “more intelligent” feminine men and masculine women – which is what the scene of the dinosaur with the U.N. cap looking at the United Nations building with the audio “but then, an even greater force emerged, the U.N., and the U.N. un-Nazi-ed the world – forever” represents . These scenes (and the movie as a whole) are an example of the FBI and communist intelligentsia using German and American history as simplistic, brainwashed reasons why traditional male-female-child families and independent thought and freewill are an “outdated” concept of the past and must unequivocally be replaced by feminine men and masculine women, homosexuality, “group love,” and the impossibility of independent thought and beliefs taking place that are different from group or “communal” thought and beliefs (in reality, the FBI’s communist, fascist New World Order agenda)."
conspiratard,3bt79g,link343,2,Fri Jul 3 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"According to the brilliant, more “highly-evolved” minds within the FBI, and the communist intelligentsia as a whole, individuality, male-female love and romance, and family and religious values have been determined to be a threat to society and humanity, and the self-proclaimed “superior” minds within the FBI have decided that no further debate (or thought) on this subject should take place (because any thoughts or beliefs different than those of the FBI are by definition inferior (in addition to being a threat to the FBI's perceived absolute power) – and after all, this is the FBI, and the FBI cannot be wrong because the FBI indisputably has the most brilliant minds, has performed the most extensive research, and possess the most unlimited resources of any other minds). The indisputably brilliant minds within the FBI and world communist intelligentsia have incontrovertibly decided that public “group love,” adult-to-adult and child-to-child homosexuality, and pedophilia (all three of these things currently being implemented and promulgated by way of Internet porn, Hollywood television shows, movies, and comedy, uncontrolled substances such as ecstasy, and radio wave/halo-based thoughts, images, and remotely-induced sexual urges – all secretly orchestrated by the FBI using radio wave/halo-based mind-controlling technology) should replace individuality, male-female love and romance, and family and religious values.  The 1967 “Summer of Love,” 1969 Woodstock, Internet porn to which children have essentially unrestricted access (a planned FBI strategy and goal), the redefinition of marriage to be between members of the same sex and between more than two people, drug-heavy “rave” parties encouraging dance orgies and homosexuality, and the group orgy scene in “The Matrix Reloaded” and “Avatar” are examples of the FBI’s plan to destroy the definition of marriage, male-female love, romance, the male-female-child family, sexual restraint, and the innocence of children in addition to all traditional concepts of morality in the name of “group love,” “free love,” “world peace,” and “paradise on earth.” Any feigned attempts to defend male-female marriage and male-female romance and traditional family values by the FBI and their remotely-controlled mouthpieces are a lie; individuality, male-female love, and traditional male-female-child family values are the absolute enemy of the FBI’s communist New World Order agenda. In fact, the end of FBI-created “Raiders Of The Lost Ark”, which shows the characters Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood tied at the post in front of a group of Nazis and in front of the ultimate symbol of Judeo-Christian values – the Arc of the Covenant – symbolizes the communist’s/FBI’s association of individuality, male-female love, religion, and masculinity with Nazistic racism and imperialism and therefore being things that “chain” and “harm” humanity and must be “abolished” in order for humanity to achieve true “happiness” and “paradise on earth.”  One must consider, in light of the individual-right and national sovereignty-shrinking effects that the communist revolutions, World Wars, and Cold War conflicts have had on humanity over the last one hundred years, was there another goal for the creation of nuclear weapons besides defeating the Axis forces or was World War II and the invention of nuclear weapons purposely planned for brainwashing humanity into accepting communist slavery and intended to be used in conjunction with the radio wave/halo-based mind-controlling technology to instill such intense fear of humanity’s destruction by nuclear war in individual minds that they would be willing to give up their own freedoms and the sense of basic morality and humanity that has persisted for millennia – since the dawn of civilization? Was George Orwell not only correct in his prediction of the effect of nuclear weapons on freedom and human dignity – was it in fact planned to be this way by Marxists, communists, and genocidal minds of the 19th century? More frightening to consider - was the concept of nuclear weapons a late-19th and early-20th century pre-planned method for wiping out what the intelligentsia of that time considered to be the unintelligent and unworthy - and are the arrogant sociopaths within the FBI mockingly acknowledging this to be the case in the following lines of “Idiocracy”:  “How did the world ever get like this?”  …  “Do you think Einstein walked around thinking everyone was a bunch of dumb shits?”  “Yeah…I hadn’t thought of that.”  “Now you know why he built that bomb.”  “Yeah.”"

They are so sure that they are going to be blamed, that they need to create scenarios where they have been set up to take the fall, so they can feel sorry for themselves (and more importantly, tell everybody in earshot that they are the real victims).  The other thing that they are doing is trying to distance themselves and their radio heroes (their messiah Alex Jones, e.g.) from the effects of the eliminationist rhetoric and hate speech that spews out of the fat Texan's mouth on a daily basis, while he blames his political enemies for all of the crimes that he and his Koch Brothers / John Birch Society benefactors perpetrate."

Some have racist slogans and imagery, others are clearly from a boy in elementary school, and others are random flyers and newsletters.  The man gets up, grabs a duffel bag from the bad and head forr the door.  EXTERIOR, EVENING:  We see the man from earlier pulling up in a beat-to-fuck late model Oldsmobile, outside a large hall, could be a church or neighborhood rec center.  He gets out of the car and walks toward the rear of the Olds.  The camera lingers on a ""Fuck the SPLC"" and a White Pride symbol.  He opens the trunk, retrieves his duffel, and heads for the building.  [HERE IS WHERE MICHAEL BAY FILLS 120 MINUTES OF SCREEN TIME WITH OVER THE TOP CARNAGE].  CUT TO EXTERIOR, A PARK:  Cops are standing over the man's body, riddled with bullets after an extended chase and running gunfight.  Cop #1:  Guess he got what was coming to him. Cop #2:  Yeah.

conspiratard,3bmvzb,mattwan,3,Wed Jul 1 05:52:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it has multiple authors, since that implies multiple people deliberately collaborated on the document.   It does, though, read like different sentences were written by different people--basically, demonstrated competence with written English seems to vary from sentence to sentence within a paragraph.  Anyone who has ever read a paper written by a lazy high-schooler will recognize what's going on, though. It's not a conspiracy, it's just racist copy-paste from muliple pre-existing screeds, with occasional word changes to avoid plagiarism and Roof's own personal hatred sprinkled in here and there.  Edit: Actually, to be honest, I'm not sure it's even 100% fair to call it lazy. While it feels dirty to even try being fair-minded toward Dylann Roof, even regarding his composition habits, I know that something like this was--back in the day--pretty common in some high schools, at least in the (deeper Southern) area where I grew up. I keep finding that my tiny, rural high school's English program was surprisingly advanced compared to a lot of ""better"" schools' programs at that time, but our teachers definitely took the bizarre ""every sentence in your paper, outside of the introduction and conclusion, must be either a cited paraphrase or a direct quote from a scholarly work"" approach to formal writing. This was a common enough approach in the area that in two separate Intro to Composition classes at two separate universities in the region (long story) my instructor had to warn the class that what many of them had been taught along these lines was absolutely wrong."

This was a story spun often in the apocalyptic church I grew up in. As the Antichrist moves into solidifying his rule, churches will be invaded by armed soldiers who will require each congregation to renounce his or her faith at gunpoint. God will turn His back on those who recant, while the tiny minority (even in our congregation, brothers and sisters, even in ours) who insist on their faith will, depending on the telling, either be rounded up into camps or shot immediately.  What I'm saying is, once you're that far down the rabbit hole, pretty much anything makes sense to you. This sort of belief has been going strong since at least the mid-70s, and it just won't stop."

No, sorry, rounding up people (and presumably killing them) because their ideological beliefs are different from yours isn't the behavior of a rational individual. Your fascism is not better than their fascism.  And I don't know who told you otherwise, but it's definitely possible to be an atheist without also being a mindless anti-religion bigot. It's pretty clear from the rest of your comments that you haven't actually become an enlightened, thoughtful person by rejecting Christianity, you've merely replaced an overtly religious ideology with a superficially non-religious one. At the end of the day, you're still an ideological zealot."

I can't read your mind, nor do I particularly care to. I can only judge you based on what you say. So if you don't want people to think that you actually advocate rounding Christians up and putting them into camps, the easiest thing to do is to not say that you advocate exactly that. I didn't make you say that. That's something you chose to say. So I'll thank you not to try to blame me for it.   And fuck ya I am an ideological zealot. I pity the man that doesn't passionately believe in something.   I'm glad you can so freely admit that you aren't actually the enlightened, thoughtful person you half-heartedly pretend to be in between the bouts of formulaic playground insults.

Strictly speaking, the more money you have the more inflation hurts you. Inflation encourages rich people to invest their money, keeping it in the economy, whereas stagnation or deflation would cause people with lots of money to sit on it.

Now I bought stock in company A, company A is making more money, therefore I am richer. Until of course the rest of the economy catches up to the new price point I have fixed.   This is one of the things that drives inflation, since everyone is doing the process you describe. The new, numerically larger profit margin means less, so the process repeats again. What's more, because every actor is going through this process, it just means that money is worth less even faster. This is part of the reason why hyperinflationary cycles are so hard to break, because merchants and producers like to keep marking up their items.   Is a myth like Bigfoot often spotted never actually seen.   Deflation has been seen, mostly before the ""modern financial era"" of central banks. The incident that's most familiar to Americans is the Great Depression, where inflation hit about -10% per year. Deflation is incredibly uncommon nowadays because central banks more or less exist to avoid it, and work assiduously to keep at least a small amount of inflation happening."

I'm willing to accept that you're merely silly in asserting the fake moon landing in the first place (still buying it today unless you're 15 is another story).  But the modern, ""there are no satellites and NASA does nothing in space and Hubble is all computer-generated imagery, etc."" ... that's just plain bonking mad! We can literally see satellites! We can buy consumer-grade electronics and track the GPS satellites. We can inspect the math being used in open source GPS software that literally adapts to relativistic motion in real-time (real-time being a somewhat funny term in relativity land, but I think you know what I mean). Kids are sending cameras to the upper atmosphere to take pictures of the Earth. Commercial organizations are launching rockets into space. Multiple (not always friendly to each other) nations launch rockets into space routinely. We have IR telescopes in space that can see parts of the galaxy that are invisible from the ground due to our atmosphere.  All of this must be ignored by the all-space-exploration conspiracy theorist! That requires a level of delusional denialism that is, as far as I know, unrivaled outside of deep clinical psychosis, and yet it seems to be an active and growing part of the conspiracy theory landscape.

Huge leap of logic there. I just turned the TV off at that point. Oh yeah, even worse, you need to get voice samples from their actual voices for that to really work, so they had to, I guess, kidnap every person who made phone calls on the planes and then force them to make the voice recordings? LOL. At that point you might as well just get the actual people on the phone line and hold a gun to their heads while they make the phone calls. But any of them could have said ""nope, this whole thing is a setup! TELL THE PEOPLE!"" And maybe they get killed but I guess they got killed any way?

That is not the case in India. The Farmers’ Rights Act of 2001 guarantees every person the right to “save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share, or sell” his seeds. Most farmers, though, even those with tiny fields, choose to buy newly bred seeds each year, whether genetically engineered or not, because they insure better yields and bigger profits.   The World Health Organization disagrees with her claims (also in the article):   The World Health Organization has estimated that a hundred and seventy thousand Indians commit suicide each year—nearly five hundred a day. Although many Indian farmers kill themselves, their suicide rate has not risen in a decade, according to a study by Ian Plewis, of the University of Manchester. In fact, the suicide rate among Indian farmers is lower than for other Indians and is comparable to that among French farmers. Plewis found that “the pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last fifteen years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole, albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.”   Vandana is even against Golden Rice, a crop made altruistically with the intent to help alleviate vitamin A deficiency, which kills 670,000 children under 5 years old anually.

The Church basically doesn't go after its members for being Freemasons, and there's a sort of implicit don't ask don't tell.  As for why there are conspiracy theories about Jesuits? The same reason that there are about Freemasons. They have a secret initiation practice and claim to do good in the world. There's no stronger catnip for conspiracy theorists than those two elements."

Today’s decision, for example, creates serious questions about religious liberty. Many good and decent people oppose same-sex marriage as a tenet of faith, and their freedom to exercise religion is—unlike the right imagined by the majority— actually spelled out in the Constitution.     The majority’s decision imposing same sex marriage cannot, of course, create any such accommodations. The majority graciously suggests that religious believers may continue to “advocate” and “teach” their views of marriage. Ante, at 27. The First Amendment guarantees, however, the freedom to “exercise” religion. Ominously, that is not a word the majority uses. Unfortunately, people of faith can take no comfort in the treatment they receive from the majority today.   The wording of the decision implies that gay marriage is a civil right like any other.

Thus it raises the question of whether or not there will be ""ominous"" repercussions:   for example, a religious college provides married student housing only to opposite-sex married couples, or a religious adoption  agency declines to place children with same-sex married couples.   Indeed, the Solicitor General candidly acknowledged that the tax exemptions of some religious institutions would be in question if they opposed same-sex marriage.

Prop 8, in CA was an attempt to legalize gay marriage. The Mormon Church, through their front the National Organization for Marriage dumped millions in to rural districts that appealed to religious and Traditional Values voters, and in Black districts with the argument that to allow gay marriage would take away hard-won rights in the Black community.   Both voted in larger numbers than usual and Prop 8 failed. In CALIFORNIA.   I apologize for the Huck response I am on AMRC and I thought you were riffing.

So, if I were to say, ""I don't think you have a valid point because you are a puppy smuggler,"" then that's an ad hominem. If I say, ""you're not making any sense and haven't made it clear what you're asking,"" then that's perhaps insulting, depending on how you take it, but it's not ad hominem.

Here's the conflict they face with their flowing metal.. we all seen it.. there was flowing metal. Since it was not steel beams (had any supports gone flowing it'd have dropped before that) it was other metal, which got hot enough to flow. which means there was PLENTY enough heat to weaken the structural steel.. especially when you figure then impacts would have stripped most the fire coating and taken out any fire suppression.

The majority of people do not believe in chemtrails and the regulatory agencies that are in charge of air quality DO hold these coal plants responsible (though not well enough IMO). There are max emission allowances for NOx and SOx gasses and acid rain is a widely known problem that most people have heard of.   Don't bring that loony shit in here and pretend you sound any less nuts than other conspiracy mongers.

Maybe the idea could hold water, but the publication you provided concluded that black women had a ""lower"" sex ratio, meaning that it was closer to 1. Regardless, the increased probability of a younger death for African American men is something that is noted in many circles, as well as the disproportionate incarceration rate (ex: marijuana usage is equal amongst black and white populations, but punishment is more likely for blacks). So maybe some of the ""missing men"" could be from a sex ratio for African American births, but that's not going to account for all 1.5 million like the article mentions."

Well having a quick browse I found a scientific study that concludes that women of sub Saharan African decent are more likely to give birth to females than males. It also claims Whites and Asians are slightly more likely to give birth to boys 100 to 105  Simple summary here  detailed report here  This more or less debunks the nytimes 1.5 missing theory."

However, one alternate title Kurt had for Nevermind was 'Sheep'.  As for the reason 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die' didn't end up being In Utero's title, Nirvana's bassist Krist vetoed the idea because he was concerned the parents of kids who killed themselves might sue the band for encouraging it. A few years previous to the album's release this sort of thing was actually happening in several high-profile court cases, most notably against Judas Priest.

conspiratard,3b60ed,CBLF,4,Sun Jun 28 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"""Former"" police chief. There seems to actually be some evidence in the case that does not line up to what seems logical, but Seattle PD is not planning to reopen the case. Seems like this article is based on the recent documentary ""Soaked in Bleach"". Because the former chief said the same thing in the documentary.  Evidence in question is that his drug levels in his system would indicate he would have been able to stay awake and coherent enough to even handle a gun, no matter how high his tolerance was. And the shell casing was ejected on the opposite side of the body than would happen the way he was still grasping the fun when found, as well as words and actions by key people involved in the case. I'm not saying I buy into it all, but the case may deserve another look. The PD never seemed to consider it to be anything but a suicide at the time, according to what is known about the original investigation."
conspiratard,3b60ed,TypoKnig,11,Fri Jun 26 10:32:25 2015 UTC,"He likely injected the heroin, and just before he felt he would become unconscious, he pulled the trigger.   People who think Kurt Cobain was killed do not know anything about him. Before committing suicide he escaped from a rehab center, floowing a suicide attempt in Rome.  Besides, if it was a conspiracy, why not just make it look like a regular OD?"
conspiratard,3b60ed,BopTheDrass,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"The argument made was the toxicity level in his body would most likely put anyone under before it was even fully injected. It's not in common for people to OD and die with the needle in their arm, before even completing the full injection, even people with very high tolerances. Yet he was able to put away all of his works neatly in the box, pick up the gun and shoot himself with the ejected shell somehow able to jump several feet in the over his fallen body in the position he was holding the gun. They could have left it to look as a normal OD, but people who commit murders often make judgment errors, especially when they are as loaded as the people most likely involved in the case were. Also many people that knew them said that Kurt was planning to seek divorce, which would potentially provide the motive.  Again, I'm not saying I buy into it all, just explaining why some people are asking for the case to be opened. Personally, I don't see the harm at having fresh eyes look at the evidence. The Seattle PD seems reluctant to do so, as it was a very high profile case that would not look so good if the results were reversed. Anyone deserves that, not just celebrities."
conspiratard,3b60ed,TypoKnig,3,Fri Jun 26 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"You are making things seem way more suspicious than they are.  First of all, it's very difficult to properly measure how much heroin is in someone's system, and even if that would kill them. It's not an exact science, and Kurt Cobain had a really high resistance anyway. People have survived what would have normally been overdoses before.   Secondly, no conspiracy theorist can explain why Kurt Cobain ran from a rehab center following his suicide attempt in Rome, to go to his house and kill himself, apart from the fact he wanted to kill himself.  What does the box have to do with anything? What does the shell have to do with anything? You know what Kurt said he would do many, many more times than ""get a divorce?"" Kill himself.  These conspiracy theorists don't want to admit that people like Kurt Cobain are not immortal. Kurt was a human being and he had a breaking point. He couldn't handle his fame. It's extremely comfortable to imagine that his death is all a big conspiracy, because they feel less guilty for liking his music and making him famous."
conspiratard,3b60ed,BopTheDrass,-1,Fri Jun 26 20:56:42 2015 UTC,"In each post, I said I'm not buying into the whole deal. Originally what I posted that this article is basically a rewrite of a documentary as a news story, and to give some basic info that was in it. The documentary has several close friends of Cobain saying he was not suicidal at all, and the overdose in Italy was the result of combining rohynpnol with too much champagne while partying with his friends and was not a suicide attempt.  That being said, I've had a couple of friends commit suicide and would have never have thought they were suicidal either. But they were all obvious suicides due to the circumstances. I'm also a true crime buff, and cases of murder disguised as suicide are not uncommon and often not easy to solve.  The fact that he left rehab doesn't mean much to me personally. It's extremely common, and doesn't usually indicate suicidal behavior. And I'm not a toxicologist with access to the official autopsy record, so I do question the doctors that presented that part in the story, as expected. Unfortunately, I am too familiar with junkies and narcotic abuse and nothing that was presented seemed far out of line to me, but- I'm not a scientist with the autopsy data.   I watch a lot of documentaries and know how easy it is to manipulate the viewer. I was skeptical going into the documentary and am skeptical after watching it. It did offer some new information because some of the photos and other stuff was only recently released by Seattle PD. By no means am I convinced it was a murder, the most I can say is there may be more to the case than meets the eye, or at least the initial media reports.   I'm not even a Nirvana fan myself and I actually knew one of the band members a very long time ago. We were pals that were in different bands, not close friends or anything.

Roberts, on the other hand, is good at getting even the liberal members of the Court to sign on to opinions with implications ultimately insidious to their own causes.

Book covers? Album covers? Prints of cival war lithographs? What about northern propaganda posters showing southern flags?  Symbols are just images and your a) and b) breakdown is the rational way to handle controversial symbols.   Symbolic representation of ideas are no different than written ideas. Are Amazon and Apple going to start pulling books that cover the civil war now? It would be intellectually inconsistent if they don't.    If we scrub all public viability, only fanatics will have control over the narrative.   I'm about as liberal as it gets, but I don't want to see things get to this point. The right to not be offended does not exist.   Remove state sponcered representation, but now this has gone too far."
conspiratard,3b3k0c,By_Design_,19,Fri Jun 26 02:27:38 2015 UTC,The right to not be offended does not exist.    Which is exactly why Apple/Amazon are free to take down all the confederate flag based items they like. You being offended at the situation has no meaning.
conspiratard,3b3k0c,wormania,0,Fri Jun 26 13:04:20 2015 UTC,"and I can criticize their business decision. They have over reacted. Market pressure is not asking for the removal of all confederate images. The removal of games with civil war themes is absurd and corporate platform censorship on non offensive art direction. They can do it but it's a ridiculous reaction that is both unnecessary because it goes waaaaay outside of the realm of offensive context and it closes a market for content creators and art directors.   People want the removal of state sponsored representation not the removal of Civil War board games or video games. Fuck apple for dropping the ball on their content developers. I would be livid if something I created was now associated in it's removal because of that shit bag Dylann Roof.   why not move to banning games with guns now too? right, because seeing video games must make you violent and seeing civil war images must make you a raciest.... well... not you and me but the fellow behind the tree will be damaged if they are exposed to this content."

Not only because I disagree with the non-offencive content they are removing, but because there is no possible way from them to be intellectually honest or consistent about what they have decided to not pull down after this move.  Market pressures are allowed to push back. I have no doubt that this will blow up in their face and they will change their decision.  edit: and now civil war games with confederate flags are being added back to to the app store. Almost like they took it to far in rearguards to removing non offensive content. So everyone that was ready to roll over to corporate pressured censorship on independent developers should take note. Corporations are taking over our political system, and as political money and influence increase these are the areas where we are going to start losing speech because it is not protected in the private market. We can only fight to protect it with outcry, it is not guaranteed.  people would not stand for apple removing or censoring films, literature, or songs and other forms of creative content like games should not be treated any differently.

On the contrary, most legislation is poured over by lawyers and congressional aides and committee members and lobbyists and on and on to get the wording just so.  When it is vague or ambiguous, we (speaking as an American) have processes to deal with that. Just look at the Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act today. They were presented with what was ostensibly ambiguous language (it really wasn't for anyone not being nakedly partisan and/or a moron) and they considered arguments, considered the language in context of the legislation and ruled accordingly. They didn't use it in this case, but they also have an entire legal doctrine known as Chevron deference that requires courts to defer to interpretations of a statute made by the government in cases of ambiguous meaning.

My main objection is this part   When America is ready for that step   After Columbine and Newtown and Charleston and Isla Vista and Aurora and all the other horrific mass shootings this country has experienced, I truly wonder if anything can push America to be ready for serious gun control. The Sandy Hook massacre is the one that made me really pessimistic. If 20 first graders and 6 teachers being slaughtered didn't make an impact, I don't know that anything will. That's why I think that we have to push back against the assumptions that many Americans make about guns and why we have to be vocal about the need to reduce guns and gun violence. Americans have made it clear that they view the occasional mass slaughter as just the price to pay for ""freedom"". Those of us that don't think that way have to work hard to change those views. That's why I questioned your assumption in the first place."
conspiratard,3b07a6,rsh412,3,Thu Jun 25 18:17:14 2015 UTC,"Well, something will, or it won't. Im honestly fine with it because I don't really believe guns are the problem. We as a society are the problem, and guns are simply the current tool of choice. Im not doing the ""guns dont kill people"" thing, but I am saying that there are plenty of places in the world that are as armed to the teeth as us but dont have similar problems the same extent. We have created a naation of people who mostly dont value human life, and more importantly have grown up tolerating and even embracing the idea that other lives are an acceptable means of affecting change. I'm not sure what the answer is at this point, but I dont think taking away our toys will change the fact that as a whole we are a rather narccisitic and violently disposed people. We need to fix that. The same thing that makes us do these horrible things is partly the same thing that wont allow us to give up our guns, so taking them will only inflame that problem. The same day we decide to give them up is probably also the same day we wont really need to anymore."

I'm not trying to be idealistic or saying that your view of how legislation is written is necessarily wrong. Lobbying plays a major role, probably bigger than most Americans think. Congress is enacting laws though and laws need to be detailed and legalistic by their very nature. It's also true that when writing a bill that could be hundreds of pages long in a collaborative manner that passes through many hands, drafts and committees, mistakes, poor wording and obfuscation are going to necessarily enter into the process even without that being the intention."

conspiratard,3ayuts,hellotherefriendz,10,Wed Jun 24 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"People don't understand and accept that science requires a process that results in a continual change of our understanding about a thing.  We might have a good degree of certainty about a fact only to have that later be disputed, and later disproven.  A good ""harmless"" example might be eggs and cholesterol.  For years, dietary cholesterol was considered evil and eggs were briefly considered unhealthy as a result.  However, more recent research has pointed out that saturated fats & trans fats are a far greater risk to our cholesterol levels than dietary cholesterol, meaning eggs aren't actually that unhealthy after all.  A lot of people like certainty.  They like knowing concrete facts that they can stick with.  People also like knowing facts that correspond to their world views and that line up with things that they know.  The MMR vaccine hoax is a perfect example of this.  It was a single study that told certain people exactly what they wanted to hear.  Some people also tend to cling to facts that are proven to be wrong, and that demonstrating that their understanding of a fact is wrong can actually strengthen their hold on the fact.  Again, anti-vaxx people often fall into this trap.  Now combine all of these things.  Our understanding of the world is continually changing thanks to science.  We're taught facts that might change and later become invalid. People hold on to facts.  Some people aren't able to let go of facts that are now wrong.

I mean as a hypothetical it's easy to shoot down any argument against their fear.   The car should be programmed to sacrifice itself, and yes you, than say plow into a crowd of innocents at 60mph.  Because if you would choose plowing into them rather than a wall you prove the computer actually made the correct choice on 2 counts proving AI smarter than humans. :)"

It is an interesting question though: assuming that the driving car is completely not at fault, and the choice situation was brought on by a human or group of humans, which option should the car choose?  So let's say that you're going down the highway and a group of people run across the highway. There isn't enough distance to stop. The car can either run into the people, or swerve into oncoming traffic to get out of it. What should the car do? I don't think many people would say that the car should sacrifice itself in that kind of situation."

It's hard to say, I mean that goes into grey area.   I'm saying in cases of mechanical failure to be able to stop the vehicle... and you could make it so it was only in that case the car would swerve into a wall, but would not to avoid a human that jumped infront of the car and the car did not have the distance to stop....  But it is a good point... how will the car react in either situation, and a driverless car that does not have that potential situation (mechanical failure) equated into it is an issue."

For many people in the south, it is more of a symbol of where they came from, like ""I heart NYC"" etc. There aren't many people who harken back to the days of slavery (hell, most were too poor to ever own slaves.) If anything, it is because cultural clashes and ignorance.   For many people, this act is somehow further proof that the south is full of hateful racists, which is a view nearly as wrong as the guy who pulled the trigger. They hate him, and the backwoods church I used to attend with my grandfather was praying for the people who died and cursing the man who did this. Not a single black parishioner and yet you had nothing but tears and sorrow.   I don't know where you were in the past year, but I've lived and grown up all over the south and many of my family are from deep in Appalachia, Northern Alabama and Georgia. Yeah, you'll find racists but it's not the type that lynch's for being black. As far as 'occupied territory' I have to laugh at the oversimplification. I joke with my family that ""I'm in love with a yankee city girl"" doesn't mean anything other than ""she's a keeper.""   There's radicals in every group and any justification they can find they will use. Because one Christian group bombs an abortion clinic doesn't mean all Christians agree.

There aren't many people who harken back to the days of slavery (hell, most were too poor to ever own slaves.)

I understand that, because not all former confederate states fly the flag, and it's not only flown by those in the south anymore, and not just to mean racisim, in some instances it has been used more to 'own' it, and it's part of our culture. It is something we as a country should never forget. However for some it is a festering wound.. not for all. For the 150 year old wound, they see us as occupiers. When I say us.. I mean, you and me Citizens of the United states.  You live in south, i live north, I don't see you as a reb, or a confederate, you dont' see me as a yankee (in a bad way, more descriptive), we're Americans right?  BTW, I don't support 'ban the confederate flag', but I fully support no state should fly it at their capitol or government buildings. For the sole reason it is a symbol of a former national allegiance of your state. Should we fly the British flag at government buildings of former Colonies?

conspiratard,3am7o3,Ardhen,3,Mon Jun 22 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"'Southern Pride"" is a complicated issue but for most it's more of a way to say 'this is where I'm from' but for some of us it also embodies the small town mentality, southern hospitality and simple way of life. It's the embodiment of the feeling you get after a long day of hard work in the hot sun, that sense of pride when you build something etc. It's mainly just romanticized in stories and songs because a vast majority of people have never had to experience country living first hand. (It's not 'fun' I can tell you that, but it has a way of making you appreciate the little things.)   No matter where you go, you will find backwards people. There are racists everywhere, in every city and every town. If you go looking for it, you'll eventually find it. The 'good ol boy' system is still alive and well, it just goes by different names. I don't know if you'll ever be able to get rid of it entirely, but with each generation's more worldly exposure, things seem to be changing.   I've travelled a lot, and I've seen the different forms of racism. It's different kinds though, and I think that's where a lot of the disconnect it. In the north from my experiences, it's a lot more segregated. Most areas are predominantly one race and there are areas that you just don't go. You'll lambast racism but never actually interact with those same people. The poor areas and ghettos are just an eyesore and black people need to be taken care of better, clearly it's a failing of the system. (This is an overgeneralized summation.) While that's not just found in the north, there tends to be more poor whites and poor blacks living in close proximity, so the mentalities tend to be different down south. You get more direct cultural clashes and negative opinions based on personal experiences and anecdotes. You're more likely to see overt racism instead of the far more common kinds.  It's easy for me to say that all yankees are rude, inconsiderate assholes when in reality I know there's just a lot of cultural differences and personality differences. My SO has a lot of those 'yankee' traits, like brutal honesty instead of the passive aggressiveness we're accustomed to in the south. It's easy to write off something about a group based on over generalizations than it is to actually understand it.   Most people in this country are not smart. The Confederate flag for most is so far removed from the actual Civil War that they don't even realize what it's actually from, they just relate it to what the immediately know, which is country music concerts, southern gentlemen and being drunk.   You get all types of people wherever you go. I've been called a redneck both as a positive and a negative, and despite the fact I may have a lip full of chewing tobacco half the time, I've also got a library I'm proud of, a beautiful straight-from-Queens SO and a lot of miles on my boots and my mind. I come from poor Irish and there's a good bit of white trash in my lineage, but also a few war heroes, a signature on the Declaration of Independence and some old moonshiners. I don't represent anyone but myself, and the south, like anywhere, is full of a complicated mix of people, personalities, and cultures. Ignorance and hate though can be found anywhere.   When I say yankee, it's not supposed to be a negative, more of friendly teasing. I'm good friends with people who are on the opposite end of the political spectrum than myself, but we're always able to discuss things without making things personal, and that's something I wish we could all do better. Hopefully I didn't come off as rude and whatever I say is taken as my own opinion and not representative of some greater view because Lord knows opinions are like assholes."

Confuse causation with correlation.   “I got the symptoms of radiation sickness,” she told me. Her tone was patient, like a veteran teacher explaining old truths to young students. “I went to the doctor and he wasn’t able to diagnose it. Eventually I established that I was reacting to a buried cellphone tower.  Confuse anecdotal evidence with empirical evidence. Being fooled by cold reading.   Stewart said he was sceptical about electrosensivity until he tried an experiment. He held a meeting with some electrosensitives, and didn’t tell them he had a mobile phone in his pocket. “They noticed at once. After that I was convinced.  Paranoia that there are infiltrators within the group who are planted to discredit the cause.

conspiratard,3alfts,BoilerButtSlut,3,Sun Jun 21 16:01:22 2015 UTC,"Quite often, somethings not a problem, until it's a problem.  If they'd had a couple of decades of never having an issue with the foam, then I've no reason to believe that they new it was an issue, but didn't feel like addressing it.  It doesn't make sense.  ' Let's engineer a spacecraft and ignore an obvious issue of safety that we know will cause the destruction of our space craft and one which we will fully admit is a problem.'"
conspiratard,3alfts,thefugue,3,Sun Jun 21 16:05:43 2015 UTC,"I agree that it doesn't make sense- but the other time we lost a shuttle it was due to a known problem as well.. Rockets and space craft blow up much more regularly than civilian transports do and risk is far more accepted. I'm not saying that anyone knew the foam would cause an accident- I'm saying nobody couldn't have known that it was a possibility. In fact, looking at the wiki for the disaster I see that previous orbiters and launches had suffered damage from foam in the past. I guess what I'm saying boils down to ""the public is not largely aware of the dangers of space flight and would be uncomfortable with it if they were, as evidenced by how such dangers are routinely treated in the industry.""  EDIT: Here is video of the investigation's simulation of the foam strike. I cannot be the only person (and I am a lay person) to have gone ""yeah well no shit"" when the simulation was on the news. I love aerospace and I fully understand the fact that shit blowing up is part of the industry- I bought Orbital Technology stock last year right after one of their launches exploded because I fully know that it's just part of how it happens- but the amount of money floating around these launches and the pressure to take risk seem to me to have played a part in the cost benefit analysis of running the shuttle program longer than was safe without upgrades to safety and the response to the accident seemed tepid and uncritical, partially due to it's happening in the aftermath of 9-11. Nobody wanted to be overly critical of the US government's handling of NASA as it is a symbol of national pride."
conspiratard,3alfts,Hactar42,7,Sun Jun 21 16:23:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a professional engineer, so I feel qualified to comment on this.  So the first thing to realize is that the shuttle was mostly designed in an age of pencil and paper and hard data from experiments. CAD was in its infancy and was very primitive by today's standards. All the fancy multi-physics simulations that we can do now did not exist back then. So when you tried to qualify a design, you had to come up with test cases that you felt represented what the shuttle was likely to encounter. With a huge, complicated system like the shuttle, this is a monumental task.  Most likely the testing they had done during qualification was different than what happened to Columbia. So, just as an example, they probably tested the foam hitting the heat shield at a glancing blow that had such a low angle of impact that it bounced off and only caused superficial damage, or the mass/velocity of the typical foam debris impacting the heat shield was assumed to be much lower than what actually happened. Now a days you could create millions of test cases in the computer to factor in a much wider range of cases than would otherwise be possible. If I had to guess, the test cases for the shuttle heat shield were probably on the order of 100 or less.  And as frequently happens in these kind of cases: Even though the foam had hit previously, since they were successful missions and nothing failed, you develop an overconfidence in the design or the safety system and don't change anything. This was also one of the causes of the Challenger explosion.  Even if they wanted to, there wouldn't have been much they could have done: Even after NASA tried everything they could to mitigate the problem after Columbia, it still happened. The design was fundamentally flawed from the beginning and there was not a lot that could have been done to realize it until the shuttle was actually flown, at which point it's too late.  That's not to say that there wasn't a systemic problem at NASA: they ignored warnings from engineers that the foam impact may have damaged the heat shield, and they had no contingency plan for a problem like that. But to say there was a cover-up doesn't fit any of the facts. I've worked with lots of aerospace engineers for my job and none ever thought that Columbia was being covered-up in any way. It would be almost impossible anyway: the entire shuttle design is well-known and there are so many people tied to the shuttle program that there was no way to keep everyone's mouth shut.  If you want a comparison, look at the accident/failure rates for airplanes designed in the 60s/70s compared to those designed in the 90s/00s. Modern computer simulation buys you a lot of safety because you can test for all sorts of corner cases that otherwise would be almost impossible to test for in real life, and you can do it without ever leaving your desk. The Boeing 787, for example, had about 1,000,000 hours of simulated flight time during its design qualification. That's just impossible in the real world.  tl;dr: It was simply a bad design that probably wasn't tested as rigorously as it should have been, but worked well enough for people to trust it until it was too late."

I just hate that Alex Jones and other conspiracy nuts are as avid about gun rights and ownership as myself because they make us seem totally crazy.   I am not very well educated on this most recent tragedy but I remember reading he obtained the firearm as a gift from his father for his 21st bday. A lot of criminals obtain firearms from their friends and families that they use in crimes.   http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/suspected-charleston-church-shooter-gun-birthday-article-1.2262393  If the father obtained the firearm with the intention of giving it to a person who was legally prohibited from owning a firearm that is a crime.   Also the talk about him taking Suboxone being the cause of this crime is totally absurd, it is used for opiate addiction and has no potential in itself to cause violence. Suboxone is given to someone with an opiate dependency and will cause immediate withdrawal from that opiate as Narcan a drug in Suboxone has a greater affinity for the opiate receptors in the brain. I think there might be a link between opiate withdrawal and violence but I am not a doctor, pharmacist, or addiction specialist.  I see headlines like ""BLAME THE DRUG NOT THE GUN!!!"" and it makes me sad that people would do either this racist criminal is responsible for his actions and I hope he is met with the harshest penalty his state has for such a crime."

conspiratard,3aj23d,ArgyleMK,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:52:28 2015 UTC,I think the freedom to own firearms is dangerous much like many of our rights but I would be hard pressed to deny an individual the rights granted to them in the constitution.   Hate speech is dangerous and might have been an influencing factor in this crime but I would not deny a persons right to promote racist beliefs.   I am not a scholar of constitutional law but I personally interpret the 2nd amendment to be about arming the people in case of violent revolution. I hope violent revolution will never be needed and it is very very unlikely it will but I wouldn't take away the rights of individuals despite the unlikely nature that it might be needed or used.   I personally have been robbed at gunpoint and more than one of my friends have experienced violent home invasions so I prefer to be armed if I could carry a cop in my pocket I would.
conspiratard,3aj23d,uniformsquare,2,Mon Jun 22 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"It's the treating the constitution as a sacred document that is the problem. You can amend it. Prohibition was a stupid idea that killed a lot of people and funded organised crime, so you americans saw sense in ending it with an amendment. The example set by other countries says that changing the second amendment and bringing in sensible restrictions would mostly or completely eliminate your problem of mass shootings.  The risk of revolution doesn't matter much when if it comes you're bringing a rifle to a drone fight.  Robberies and home invasions are done whether criminals have easy access to guns or not. It's like saying ""I need this gun to protect myself from the threat that access to this gun creates."" Look at Australia, you can still get mugged and your home invaded there, but they haven't had any mass shootings since they banned guns. Additionally, you or one of your family members isn't going to accidentally get shot in a fracas if you do meet a thief."
conspiratard,3aj23d,ArgyleMK,2,Sun Jun 21 16:47:41 2015 UTC,"I personally feel the bill of rights to be sacred. Free speech, freedom of religion, right to petition the government, right to bear arms, be free of soldiers being quartered in your home, rights against unwarranted search and seizure , etc.   I feel the constitution should promote liberty and act as a floor for freedom and not a ceiling. The 18th amendment limited the freedom of people, sure alcohol harms society and is a dangerous drug but freedom is often at the cost of safety.   Mass shooting are well publicized because they are horrific large scale and harm average people unlike most firearm homicides that effect mainly poor ethnic minorities involved in the drug trade. Mass shooting are bad like all violent crime but are a very small part of overall violent crime.   I feel poor people with little more than rifles, RPG7s, and other explosives seem to be doing pretty well for themselves throughout the history of war in the 20th and 21st century.   I don't think guns cause a person to commit crimes or dissuades a person from committing crimes. I have been a victim of violent crime and wished I was armed at the time because law enforcement if largely a reactionary force. It is statistically unlikely you will be a victim of violent crime in your lifetime but if someone is trying to harm you or your loved ones or take your property would you prefer to be armed or unarmed?"
conspiratard,3aj23d,uniformsquare,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:57:56 2015 UTC,"I don't buy into statistically unlikely threats to my life or those of my family. If anyone is going to deliberately kill me it's a given that it will be someone I know and not a deranged stranger (it does happen but so to shark attacks and I'm not afraid of them either). In my opinion if someone breaks into my house to steal my tv, he or she can take it, property is not worth killing or dying for.  And anyway I'm not advocating a universal gun ban, I'm advocating gun control. Liking guns is a valid reason to want to have guns and to attain them. But as with any dangerous machinery, access should be restricted. In NZ you are allowed to have guns provided you only use them for sport or hunting (and you're not a mental case or someone with a history of violence). You're free to collect them to your hearts content, and people do- in fact owing to the restrictions you find people who own guns are cautious and docile natured. We haven't had a massacre in 18 years and not a rampage for 25.  So let me ask you something. Say you live somewhere where personal defence makes with guns sense and there's a legitimate risk of revolution. If you had the power to deny someone a gun, would you deny one to a mentally questionable person, or someone with a history of violence?"
conspiratard,3aj23d,ArgyleMK,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"Yes for history of violence if it was illegal and not self defense. Mental illness only if it makes them a danger to themselves or others. With the current laws if you commit any felony or are considered a danger to others or yourself because of mental illness it makes you ineligible to own a firearm. The 4473 is the form you have to fill out and then your information is ran through the FBI NICS system to make sure your not a crazy or a felon. I do agree with most of the system in place but I don't think all felons should be prevented from owning a firearm because you can be a felon for non violent drug use like getting caught with a single hit of LSD. I personally am against a federal firearm registry and I believe it to be illegal currently.   I would personally take someones life to protect myself, friends, and loved ones along with our property. Are you saying you would not do all in your power to try and stop a person trying to harm you, your loved ones, or take your property?  I know a woman who used a firearm to defend against an attacker much larger than her, statically it was very unlikely she would be attacked and impossible to prove she would be attacked in her lifetime but she did need the gun to defend herself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t_htoRmJIw  I think all but illicit use of firearms are legitimate use and should be respected. I would never ask someone to prove their reason for using a constitutional right such as free speech despite the potential danger of it."
conspiratard,3aj23d,uniformsquare,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"Giving a gun to someone with a history of violence or mental illness is like giving a car to someone who cannot see. It's reckless.   Are you saying you would not do all in your power to try and stop a person trying to harm you, your loved ones, or take your property?   I don't make this decision based on reflexive emotion, I look at the statistics. I would never put anyone's life on the line in order to protect property, it just isn't worth it. Even property with sentimental value. But there is no sense defending something I've insured against theft with my life of the lives of others. The other thing is that I also value the thief's life. You can't in one breath extol the importance of rights and in the next invalidate the rights and the value of life of a criminal.  Would I try to protect myself or a family member from someone who deliberately wants to hurt me? Yes, but does that warrant a gun for defence? The risk of misuse of a gun for protection is too high. If I keep it in my safe, it's not much good for protection, if I keep it out a kid might get it - and before you suggest keeping it somewhere safe that isn't a safe, the chances of a kid finding it anyway are much higher than that of meeting a hypothetical home invader to wans to hurt me and family.   statically it was very unlikely she would be attacked and impossible to prove she would be attacked in her lifetime but she did need the gun to defend herself.   I think you concede the issue when you mention the statistics. Carrying a gun for self-protection has it's own risks, and they're statistically more concerning than an attacker. As I said, people also get attacked by sharks, but I'm not going to start going swimming with a harpoon.  What is and is not illicit? Owning guns for their own sake isn't illicit, using guns for hunting or sport isn't illicit. Personal protection? Well no it's not illicit but it creates problems that are much greater than what the guns are there to solve. As much as a person has those rights, they have the right to not fear things like accidental gun deaths, people with rage issues, and suicidal lunatics. In what special way are guns different to automobiles that they shouldn't be subject to risk-based restrictions?"

Briefly, 'empire' was essentially thrust upon the US at the end of the second world war, thanks to a literal vacuum of any other nation capable of deploying naval forces across the globe to 'protect' global trade. And we set the standards. If you wanted to trade, you did it in US Dollars. The captains of your foreign flagged ships spoke English so they could respond properly to the US Navy. So they could obey our orders.  The world has been our oyster since the 1940's, not 1991.

Unfortunately most of his articles are behind Foreign Policy magazine's paywall.  The version he promotes is quite extreme and I doubt it would survive any challenge in the Court system if it magically got passed by Congress. Conscription in the military or mandatory volunteer service are politically unpopular.  I'm an Army veteran of the last Iraq War and have a lot of conflicted feelings about it. Primarily because I felt a certain comfort knowing that all the other soldiers around me volunteered when I was in the service and the fact that the vast majority of the recruiting pool in this country would not be able to meet the basic enlistment requirements."

Way more so when you have to factor in people surviving the trip, landing on the moon and taking back off... while we made several trips we had 'reusable technology', where much of it the russians would have had to do from scratch. In other words after the first moon shot production of each successive moon shot should be cheaper due to like 0 R/D :) If you factor in r and d into the cost of each shot.. each shot after the first reduces the ""per shot cost"" of the RD of tech.."
conspiratard,3acjgf,waffenwolf,5,Fri Jun 19 02:15:00 2015 UTC,I understand the Russians first and only attempt was seriously flawed by using a rocket that remained fully intact the whole trip. But I would have thought they would have improvised and copied the American method.   They where very much capable of doing it. Not so long after the American moon landing the Russians constructed the first space station then sent the first robots to the surface of Mars and Venis. It seems they where only motivated if they could be the first ones to achieve the milestone arriving second was out the question.
conspiratard,3acjgf,IAmNotYourBoss,4,Fri Jun 19 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"It's not that the rocket remained in one piece.  It was a multi-stage rocket just like the Saturn V.  The problem was that the first stage of the N-1 had over thirty smaller engines in a very complex and fragile arrangement.  If one of those engines malfunctioned the whole rocket was basically a small atomic bomb blast waiting to happen.  For comparison, the Saturn V had five huge F1 engines, which reduced the overall complexity of the vehicle."

conspiratard,3acjgf,BoilerButtSlut,2,Fri Jun 19 14:39:39 2015 UTC,"The jobs have disappeared partially through export, but also because manufacturing itself has become much less labor intensive.  If you look at manufacturing output, it has increased almost every year since 1980."

They are not the same. Yes, manufacturing jobs have diminished greatly. Manufacturing output has not, however. We are almost double of manufacturing output of 1987.  Source for output and Source for employment"
conspiratard,3acjgf,BoilerButtSlut,2,Fri Jun 19 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I expressed myself incorrectly in not specifying that the manufacturing jobs and not manufacturing..   Technology generally increases productivity while decreasing the need for workers, assuming your sales can not absorb the increase in production.  Though there you have the rub and the failing of market economy. :) Increase productivity need less workers, less workers is less consumers (as unless you're absurdly rich you have to work to consume).. less consumers is less profit, and so on and so forth. Heh...  However, I acknowledge your points as totally valid.   Nice cites.   :)"
conspiratard,3acjgf,BopTheDrass,3,Fri Jun 19 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"It can also be argued that China's rise had led to a much slower growth of manufacturing than otherwise would have happened. i.e. without China, manufacturing employment would have remained roughly the same or even grown, and manufacturing output would be much higher than it is now.  What happened was the ""low-cost consumer good"" manufacturing left for China, but high-cost capital and consumer goods remained. We're still #1 for capital goods, and I don't think anyone is going to come close to that anytime soon."
conspiratard,3acjgf,Palmul,2,Fri Jun 19 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"You wanna know why manufacturing jobs decreased?  Some outsourcing, sure.  But most of it is this little thing called AUTOMATION.  See, when I can either train a worker to put an engine together, pay them and give them benefits over the 30 years they work there for almost a million dollars or two, or I can just buy a machine that will put engines together 24/7, without needing to be paid, the only downtime it has is when something needs to be fixed, and it'll likely work for 50+ years, the choice is obvious.  Is it good for the job market?  Somewhat yes and somewhat no - it's shifting jobs rather than taking them, since someone has to keep those machines in working order, and someone has to tell them how to do what they do, and someone has to put them together at the factory they're made at.  That number of manufacturing jobs is going to shrink and shrink - there are a few things that we can't get the right scale for machines to do, like steel milling and overall general assembly on a lot of stuff."

But I subscribe to both pages, not to troll either or both, but because truth is more important than fantasy to me.  So when I saw good ole Alex Jones as the main link on drudge, I knew I had to make my first post here.  Does suboxone make you violent?  Well anecdotally, no, I can't say that it does after the unfortunate events which led me to have to use it for 6+ months.  But PJW has anecdotes in his story about suboxone making people hulk out and hurt people.  Who is right?  I happen to have the drug insert in front of me and in the clinical trials section, there are a lot of side effects.  Sleepiness, insomnia, headache, chills, nausea, constipation, etc etc.  Nervous system I see many side effects like anxiety, or depression, or nervousness (all well relatively low occurrences within the 731 user sample size), but I don't see anything showing a single instance of violent behavior as related to suboxone usage.  If there is a real conspiracy here, it's that the drug company that makes suboxone covered up irritability or violent behavior in their clinical trials.  I have zero evidence of that of course, but if PJW wants to stick it to big pharma, then maybe that's the course he should take.  Sue them for lying--if you can prove it.  Cheers conspiratards.  Together, skeptics and reasonable conspiracy theorists alike can at least unite in calling Alex Jones on his bullshit."

Please point to a 'reasonable conspiracy theory'?   I mean none of the ""mainstream conspiracy theories"" can hold any more water than a fishing net. The fringe ones are worse.   However, a good post for here, it's a crazy claim...  The fact is we don't know the kid was using saboxone and if he was it was not under doctors orders (which means any safety issues out the window)....  This is where conspiracy theorists get into credibility issues... dude is taking the fact the shooter had a criminal record for possession of them. This turns into he was using them.   Was he high on them at the time? We do not know.. we may never know..   Would they cause that reaction? If they were not being used properly, they may have, clinical trials rarely (do they ever?) check effects for people who would not normally be prescribed.   It is not ok to make shit up, or connect dots that are not even close in absence of information, this is the failing of conspiritards.  Edit: I noticed I made a failing in assuming that we know ""not under doctors orders"", however that he got a possession charge for soboxen means he was not prescribed at the time, which would lead me to believe he was not prescribed at this time. That is a logical jump of evidence, one that is not would be ""he had a past possession charge therefore he is on it!"""

conspiratard,3a9a5b,pbjamm,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:06:28 2015 UTC,"I view it as an extrapolation or extension of religous propaganda. The church has no problem labeling things or people  which they perceive to contradict some religous edict as satanist. Case in point, the illuminati was a secular organization for reason, created at a time in a continent under strict political influence by the vatican. No surprise such an idea would be labled as devil. Additional example, David Ickes theories originated from his own personal ""visions"".  What religion does not share the same origin? I have been tempted to fall into the same mental pitfall. That through meditation i can tap into some holistic truth. But i must admit, thats my imagination being tapped into. And even though i consider myself a special fella, not quite as special as Icke considers himself to be. Conspiracy theory writers are finally just fictional story tellers, building off other story tellers. With many of those stories going back to whatever narcissists wrote the bible based on their ""visions"". This is why the ideas are all so intertwined. Then you get military co-intel agencies putting out false propaganda, such as Nazi strategists covertly circulating ""the elders of zion"" on top of our already supersticous world of human fiction and things get really wierd. Meanwhile these first world governments are not helping matters by running clandestine operations, covering up their misdeeds with white washed public statements, generally being sincerely untrustworthy pricks, and it gives credibility to the only alternatives available, regardless of how fictional they may be."

It's the fundamentalists themselves who insist that any church-goer less ignorant and right-wing than them ""isn't a real Christian."" The Methodists and Presbyterians seldom say anything to criticize their fellow-travelers-in-Christ.  The only denunciations I hear of hate from the pulpit are from Unitarians -- and hardly anyone else in the generic flock considers them ""real"" Christians."
conspiratard,3a7km2,emkay99,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"That's very true, and certainly something we (I'm a Methodist) need to work on as a group. Protestantism has definitely let a loud and dubiously pious section made their opinions abundantly clear, while we haven't really given too much voice to the alternative. Ask a non-Christian what Christianity means, typically their mind automatically goes to WBC or some douchebag arch-conservative. That's not what we should be teaching, and me and the other like minded Christians should certainly start speaking up. We definitely can get insular. Most religious discussions I have are with people I know basically agree with me. I very rarely find myself engaging a non-believer because I do not want to look like an asshole. We should definitely make our voices heard."

Also, while you may be the majority of Christians spiritually, many don't take the nuts seriously and vote for the same candidates. They may support gay marriage, but they also hate taxes, and the latter trumps the former.   Major political figures and TV pundits claim that there is a War on Religion and that is part of the platform.   I'd humbly suggest you start the discussion with other believers and go from there.

Either that, or there are a lot of bold bullshitters out there. If a ""former marine"" is honestly unaware that Jade Helm is a routine training exercise that has been going on for years, then there's little point in even asking actual military about anything like this, since they're apparently no more likely to know than any random yahoo on the street.  I get that 'the military' is huge, and no one serviceman can know it all, or even most of it, but surely they've got at least some better sense of it?

It starts off with this one   • Everything Obama does is nefarious. That’s just a proven fact because I’ve heard it repeatedly on the radio.   At that point, nothing could be more evident than this being a satirical piece, but I'm continue on.   • The latest Stanley Cup win came against the Tampa Bay Lightning, a team from Florida. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is from the Chicago area, and her most likely opponent, Jeb Bush, was a longtime governor of Florida. Coincidence? I don’t think so, and I’ll say it on the radio if I need to make people believe it’s true. Obama arranged for the Chicago team to beat the team from Florida to embarrass Bush and elevate Clinton’s stature.  The Stanley Cup boost Obama has delivered will secure the presidency for Clinton.  My guess is the first thing he’ll have Clinton do is invade Canada, steal its socialized medicine and have all history books changed to show that hockey was created in America.  Watch, I bet Obama is even brazen enough to invite the whole Blackhawks team to the White House to ""celebrate"" the Stanley Cup. The nerve of that man. This is just proof that everything bad that has happened since 2008 -- and all the good things, which are also bad -- is Obama’s fault.   I mean come on."

conspiratard,39sid4,HellsquidsIntl,5,Sun Jun 14 14:26:45 2015 UTC,"edit: some highlights of the paper: dozens of photos of Stephen Hawking.  What are the real reasons for The Godfather and The Soprano's existence?  I did no research on this because I expect them to announce the imposter's death very very soon. Addendum: a death hoax just appeared online - are they on to me?  I'm not a dentist, certainly not a doctor, but let me tell you how a life-saving surgery should've gone.  Why hasn't the truth about Lincoln's assassination come out after 150 years?    First published April 17, 2015  I have written several papers critiquing Stephen Hawking, including a long one on his Brave New World series for the BBC. But this is my first paper really linking my science research with my faked events research. I will use simple photo analysis and facial analysis to quickly show you the current Stephen Hawking is not the same person as the original Stephen Hawking.  This should not surprise you too much, especially if you know something about ALS. ALS is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. We are told Hawking has had ALS for over 52 years, which is a record by many decades. Jason Becker is the only person I have heard of who has lived more than 20 years with the disease, so there is about a three-decade difference between the longest survivor and the second longest survivor. That is a more than 100% difference between first and second place. It would be like Justin Gatlin running the 100 meters in 9.8 seconds, and Usain Bolt beating him with a time of 4.5 seconds. In other words, statistically it doesn't happen.  The average survival time for ALS is four years. When Hawking was first diagnosed in 1963, doctors gave him two years to live. And yet here we are, 52 years later and counting. Should you believe it? Well, no. Like Becker, it appears the real Hawking did beat the odds and live for about 20 years. But at some point he was replaced. I have no proof he died, but I assume that is why they replaced him. He was a very useful public relations entity for physics, and they didn't want to lose him.  But rather than speculate on that, let us go right to the evidence. I won't call it proof, since of course you are free to disagree with me. This is an opinion piece, not a court transcript; and even if it were a stamped court finding, you would be free to disagree with it. You don't have to agree with anything anyone tells you, ever. Remember that. This paper is nothing more than presented evidence, evidence I find compelling. If you also find it compelling, fine. If you don't, also fine.  The picture under title is the real Hawking. Notice the longish face and skinny neck. Also notice the dark brown hair. Here is another picture of the real Hawking:  [snip]  Let that etch into your brain. This is also Hawking, a few years later:   [snip]  You see that his hair is turning gray. But the thing to notice here is his teeth. Pretty awful, right?  Well, it gets worse.   [snip]  He is now fully gray, and he has pretty much lost his lower teeth. I am not a dentist and don't know exactly what is going on there, but it looks like those teeth have been filed down or chipped down, with only stub fillings left. The next step would be dentures, right?  [snip]  Well, no. The next step, apparently, was going from gray to blonde, even in the eyebrows, and a whole new set of old yellow teeth. He also bought some new fat cheeks. Amazing right?  Actually, that is the replacement. That isn't Hawking, as I hope you can see now that I point it out. Go back two photos and compare the teeth directly. Not even close. They found a guy with the same nose and big ears, but otherwise they don't look that much alike. This is the guy you have been looking at for the past thirty years. Which means Hawking might not have written A Brief History of Time, which came out in 1988. I haven't pinpointed the date, but that was about the time they made the switch. My current guess is early 80's, which—if true—would mean that book was a forgery.  You will say, “That is just a younger Hawking, before he lost those lower teeth.” No, it isn't. I just showed you the younger Hawking, and he didn't look like that. Compare them side by side.  [snip]  Besides, the first picture is Hawking from the 1970's. The second is Hawking from the 1990's. Amazing that he aged 20 years with a debilitating disease and got younger looking at the same time, isn't it?   Hawking was still looking young in 2007, when he went aboard the ZeroG Plane:  [snip]  See how it says “zero g” on his shirt? That is from when he went up in the plane, which was in 2007. He was supposed to be 65 in 2007. Looks great for 65, eh? Unfortunately, he already looked older than that in 1982, 25 years earlier:  [snip]  His face also got shorter. Normally your face will get longer as you age, not shorter.  Here is a more recent photo of the impostor:  [snip]  Again, the teeth are the clue. This may be the same guy as our blonde impostor, but it certainly isn't Stephen Hawking. Go back to the earlier photos. Those four lower teeth were supposed to be gone decades ago, filed down to filling nubs. Are we supposed to believe they regrew? Do those look like caps or dentures to you? Would you pay a dentist to replace your teeth with those? No, we are supposed to believe that is what he has left of his real teeth, obviously. But I have just shown you why that cannot be the case.  Here is a photo I found of the blonde impostor where is it really easy to see he isn't Hawking:  [snip]  That picture is from a foreign magazine, I guess, since it seems to have been suppressed in the US and on the internet. I only found one copy of it, and the full-size image is gone. The website has been scrubbed. This makes me think photos of this guy have normally been retouched to make him look a bit more like Hawking.   And here is a really weird one, although I bet you won't see it until I point it out:  [snip]  Well, did you find the problem? This time it is with the hands. Look at the coloration and texture. Those are waxwork hands. If you can't see it there, maybe you can see it here:  [snip]  Another reason I noticed the hands is that they don't look like ALS hands. In Hawking's biography, they admit that his fingers had already begun to curl in the 1960's. Those with this disease not only can't straighten their fingers, they can't straighten their wrists. In older pictures of Hawking, he has badly curled wrists, with his left hand normally bent sideways. So how did his hands suddenly get so smooth and relaxed in his 70's?  Many of the photos of Hawking have been faked, as you might expect given what we just discovered. Take a look at these two, for instance:  [snip]  Those are both sold to us as wedding pictures of Hawking and Elaine Mason. So how many times did they get married, and how many wedding dresses did Mason have? I knew these were faked even before noticing the two wedding dresses, because this is the real Hawking, not the blonde impostor. But Mason married the blonde impostor, so I knew these photos must be faked. How did I know this was Hawking so fast? Look at the photo of him from the side. See how skinny his neck is and how it slopes up quickly to meet his skull? Then he has a protruding rear skull. The blonde impostor doesn't have that. The shape of his skull is entirely different, and it is very obvious from the side. The real Hawking was always much more bony and angular.  I also beg you to notice again how old Hawking looks there. That was supposed to be 1995 (but was really 1984-ish). Then how did he look like this in 2007?  [snip]  Twelve (actually 23) years later with a debilitating disease, and he looks ten years younger? How does that work? Where did he get those cheeks?   If this analysis is true, it would mean that Hawking's recent books are forgeries, unless he wrote them from beyond the grave (or is still alive as a brain in a tank somewhere). And it would mean his recommendation in 2012 that Peter Higgs get the Nobel Prize was a forgery. The only person recommending anything in that case would be this impostor.  You may say something like, “Yes, I see what you are saying, but I am going to withhold judgment until this breaks in the press. If you are right, it can't stay hidden. Someone will sue or something and a judge will decide.” To this I say, don't hold your breath. These things do stay out of the mainstream press indefinitely, since the press is controlled. For example, the truth about the Lincoln assassination still hasn't come out in the mainstream, 150 years later. Odds are, no one will ever decide this for you, so you have to do your own research. If you doubt my analysis, do your own. This is how things now work, and if you want to know something, you have to research it and make your own decision. Which is why I don't mind putting this on my science site. That is what science is, after all. Not accepting someone else's decision—which would be belief by hearsay or reputation. Science is studying the facts yourself and coming to your own conclusions. You cannot do science second hand. You can learn from a teacher, but ultimately you have to be your own scientist.  But let's not quit there. I would really like to know if Hawking's famous book is a forgery. I have proposed before that the sales numbers for that book were faked, since they aren't believable. But if we can show that Hawking was already gone before the book came out, that would go a long way to proving the sales figures were also faked. If they can fake the author they are hardly going to stick at faking the sales numbers, are they?  END OF PART 1"
conspiratard,39sid4,wytedevil,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"Since most of the photos of Hawking on the internet are conveniently not dated, this line of research is difficult. So let's go to his biography to see if we can find other clues to the date of the switch. We find the important paragraph at Wikipedia without much effort:  During a visit to the European Organisation for Nuclear Research on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which would require round-the-clock nursing care, and remove what remained of his speech. The National Health Service would pay for a nursing home, but Jane was determined that he would live at home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation. Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.  Wow. It's all there, we only have to unwind it. First of all, if you have had ALS for 23 years and have pneumonia to the point that doctors are recommending life support be terminated, a tracheotomy isn't going to cure you immediately. A tracheotomy is just the procedure of drilling a hole in your windpipe so you can breath through it instead of your nose or mouth. But the problems obviously went far beyond that, or they wouldn't have been recommending life support termination. He was probably losing control of his diaphragm, and couldn't fill his lungs on his own. That is what happens with ALS, you know: you lose control of parts of your body one by one, until you finally lose control of them all. We aren't told why a tracheotomy suddenly allowed him to go off the ventilator, for instance. So none of this makes any sense. If you have any doctor friends, ask them what they think of this paragraph at Wikipedia. They may tell you the truth.  This makes the likely date of the switch 1985, which is three years before A Brief History of Time came out. And it looks like Elaine Mason married the blonde impostor, not Hawking. Which brings us to the next clue:  By December 1977, [Hawking's first wife] Jane had met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir. Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family, and by the mid-1980s, he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other.  “By the mid-1980's.” That confirms the date of 1985 as the date of the switch. If Hawking died in 1985, Jane would of course be free to move on to Jones. This would also absolve her of any taint of adultery, so my reading is actually less sordid (and more believable) than the mainstream reading. It explains all the partner switches in the 1980's.   To continue to pursue this line of reasoning, let us look at a clue hidden (probably on purpose) here. The cost of his care was funded by an American foundation. That probably didn't jump out at you, since it is written in a language to make it disappear for most people. But that very language acted as a red flag for me. So what American foundation funded this? It took some digging, but it is the MacArthur Foundation. This is a huge red flag, since John T. MacArthur was the owner of Bankers Life and Casualty, one of the largest insurance firms. At the time of his death he was said to have been one of the three richest men in the US. So we should look at his foundation like we look at the Rockefeller Foundation or the Ford Foundation: that is to say, with high suspicion.  MacArthur owned Bankers Life from 1935 to 1978. In that year, most of his wealth went into his Foundation, we are told. Curiously, in the next year, 1979, a large financial services holding company called Conseco (now CNO) was born. It immediately began buying up insurance companies, including Bankers Life and Casualty. Get ready for this: it bought Bankers Life in 1986, the very same year the MacArthur Foundation began funding Hawking. Coincidence? We'll see.  We are told CNO purchased Bankers Life for 118 million, which seems absurdly low for the company of the 3rd richest man in the US. How did MacArthur become a multi-billionaire from such a measly company? These are the questions you should be asking.  Forbes listed CNO with a revenue of 4.5 billion in 2007. This despite the fact that CNO had gone through the third largest bankruptcy (after Enron and Worldcom) in US history in 2002. Also despite the fact that CNO is listed with only four subsidiaries, including Bankers Life, Colonial Penn, Washington National, and 40/86. Something doesn't add up here.  Neither does MacArthur's Wikipedia page, which is ridiculously short for someone who was recently the 3rd richest man in the US. In fact, if you Google John MacArthur without the middle initial, it takes you to first to John F. MacArthur, a radio pastor. Yes, I am sure he is more important to US history than the 3rd richest man in the US, with a Foundation endowed in the amount of 6 billion.  But back to MacArthur's Wikipedia page. It says he was born a poor black child in rural Mississippi. Just kidding, that is a line from Steve Martin's The Jerk. But seriously, his official bio says he and his siblings grew up in poverty, the children of an itinerant Baptist preacher. That is a bit hard to believe, considering that all his surviving brothers also became rich and/or famous. They admit that of his older brother Charles MacArthur, the famous playwright who was part of the Algonquin Round Table, dated Dorothy Parker, and married Helen Hayes. But they forget to tell you of Alfred, who also made a mint in insurance; and Lawrence Telfer MacArthur, who was a publisher. So all four brothers just happened to scratch their way out of crushing poverty into wealth and fame? Sure they did. Because America is just that kind of place.  A clue may be found by looking at Catherine T. MacArthur's family. Her family name was Hyland, and we are told her father was part of the Irish Catholic political machine in South Chicago, holding several local and state positions. That should be another red flag, and may be a clue as to how the MacArthurs advanced. Chicago politics has long been famous for its corruption, and even Wikipedia says,  The political environment in Chicago in the 1910s and 1920s let organized crime flourish to the point that many Chicago policemen earned more money from pay-offs than from the city.  This is when Catherine MacArthur's father would have been rising in Chicago politics.   We see similar fed flags when we return to John T. MacArthur's page. In addition to his insurance companies, he was also known as a Palm Beach, FL, real estate mogul, buying up large parts of Palm Beach and Sarasota in the 1960's. Even the PalmBeachPost admits their city has long been a bed for organized crime, although they forget to tell you that organized crime was taken over by the Feds decades ago. Private mobsters no longer exist, having been absorbed by the more powerful families that run the US government. As with all other business, the past 50 years has seen a monopolization of all lucrative operations by “investment firms”, “holding companies” and of course banks. Since these banks and other huge companies are fronts for the same few families, there is no longer any room for mobsters or any of the rest of those people. They went extinct some time in the 1960's. All the Godfather movies and Soprano shows are just misdirection to make you think organized crime still exists in the old way. It doesn't. They have found ways to steal much larger sums of money without getting their hands dirty or their names in the paper—with absolutely no risk of getting caught. They do it by stealing from you under the aegis of the Federal government.  Anyway, so that is who funded the Hawking impostor after 1985. But why? Well, we have seen all sorts of weirdness afoot in physics and other science since then. I haven't made up this weirdness, you know, I just circle it and comment on it. See my paper on Hawking's Brave New World, if you haven't already. See my paper on Yuri Milner and the Fundamental Physics Prize. See my paper on the Higgs Boson announcement, which I show was faked from the ground up. See my paper on Alan Guth and the faked gravity wave research and promotion which preceded his 2014 Kavli Prize. Well, the reason for all this weirdness is the reason for all the other weirdnesses in the Modern world: money. Physics has become a giant cash cow, milked straight from the various national treasuries by the usual suspects. Hundreds of billions of dollars are siphoned from the people of Europe, China, Russia, and the Americas via these fake programs. And Hawking was an important PR personality in the early 1980's, one they didn't want to lose. He was a top salesman of their various boondoggles, and he became an even better salesman once he was replaced by an impostor. Once he was replaced, his puppeteers had complete control over the product they were creating, with no fear that the real Hawking might develop scruples.  Remember, this is exactly what they did in art in the 20th century. They got rid of all the real artists and replaced them with impostors. The scheme was slightly different, in that they didn't replace Rodin and Monet and Whistler with look-alikes in 1900. Instead, they just replaced the entire field with their own manufactured mannequins over a generation or two. But the Modern artists have been impostors one way or the other. They certainly aren't artists by the old definitions, since they can't create anything beautiful or interesting. They are just PR personalities, the faces that front the fakery.   END OF PART 2"
conspiratard,39sid4,ME24601,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"In the very same way, physics has been taken over. Just as the Modern artists are incapable of real art, the Modern physicists are incapable of real physics. So instead they manufacture some huge pile of equations that seems (to some gullible people) to resemble physics or math, and then sell it to Congress or Parliament as cutting-edge. The important thing is not that any physics or art gets done, but that money flows from the treasury. It is all a colossal scam, of earth-shattering proportions. And I mean that literally. All the societies of this Earth are being shattered by this rampant fakery. They are coming apart at the seams. Not only are they being milked dry of all revenues—revenues that could and should be going to real programs—but they are being milked dry of all inspiration, all creativity, all good will, and all belief in humanity. Human potential is shriveling up like a spider on a hot sidewalk under a magnifying glass, and these rich families are the magnifying glass.   It has to stop. It has gotten so bad, the rich are actually undercutting themselves. For money to be worth anything there has to be something worth buying. The rich can no longer collect art, since they have destroyed it. They can no longer have the joy of underwriting real science, since they have destroyed it. They can't collect books or poetry, since they have destroyed both literature and poetry. They can't enjoy the company of innocent youths, since they have destroyed the innocence of youth. They can't enjoy love, because they have destroyed it for profit. They can't enjoy beautiful architecture, because they have destroyed it. And they can't enjoy the feeling of a day well spent, because their days aren't well spent. That is the thing about dirty money and a dirty conscience: no matter how much you spend, you can't hire someone to clean it.   [I am rushing this into print with only a few days research, since I predict they will announce his death very very soon.]  Addendum, April 22, 2015: Two days after this paper went up, there was an internet death hoax for Hawking. Someone got over a million hits at Facebook with this hoax. I read that two ways: 1) the widely publicized hoax acts to cover this paper a bit, because some will dismiss my title without reading the paper, thinking it is linked to the hoax. For this reason, I assume the death hoax was started by the same people that are behind the longterm Hawking hoax. 2) We have seen that these internet death hoaxes often now precede a real death announcement. See the strange goings-on before the announcement of Robin Williams' death (which I assume was faked like the rest). This confusion is created on purpose, because it prevents most people from making any sense of the news. Confusing news prevents questions—perhaps surprisingly—because it causes most people's brains to shut down. You would think confusing news would create questions, and in a few people it still does. But in the majority of people, very confusing news acts as its own shield. If enough confusion is created, the reader or viewer will just see a tangled web he has no hope of unwinding, causing him to accept whatever he is told and “move on.” For this reason, I will double down on my prediction that the real death announcement of Hawking is coming soon. However, we know they are reading my papers, so they may stall just for the purpose of nixing my prediction. At any rate, my intuition tells me the blonde impostor died recently and they are already stalling. Maybe they are looking for another replacement, who knows. I think it will be hard to find someone who looked like the blonde impostor did at the end.   Addendum, April 25 2015: We already have new evidence for my claim that the Hawking impostor is also dead, in that his current appearances are via hologram. Last night he appeared in Sydney via hologram, but these 3D images cannot be confirmed to be live. Like any other images, holograms can be taped and played back later. I will be told he responds to live questions, but that can be explained in any number of ways, included planted questions. But even if we assume or prove the questions are live and not planted, the responses of Hawking all have to be interpreted, which allows for any amount of trickery. From visual and aural clues alone, there is no way to tell what Hawking is responding to, which you will have to admit is convenient.  END OF PART 3"

In what officials are calling an 'unprecedented lapse', and 'in no way obviously reminiscent of many other spree shootings perpetrated by blatantly mentally-disturbed citizens', Federal, state and local officials appear to have collectively failed to deny the clearly troubled individual access to firearms, explosives, and, unusually, an armoured vehicle from which to stage an attack.  Officials have confirmed that in their opinion the public mental health services of the world's richest nation are 'working just fine', and that they have 'no plans' to do anything at this time about the apparently unfettered access to a dizzying array of firearms currently enjoyed by America's lunatics. President Obama confirmed that the customary public hand-wringing and promises of reform would begin with a speech later this evening, but that he expects any attempt to institute literally any form of gun control whatsoever to die a prolonged and agonising death somewhere in partisan politics, after having been the subject of much paranoid, masturbatory fantasy fiction on various far-right blogs.  We'll have more on how this incident was indistinguishable from others occurring seemingly fortnightly in the United States - such that you'll soon be confusing this with the shooting perpetrated last week by the mentally ill conspiracy theorist/sovereign citizen/anti-Government activist/trigger-happy law enforcement officer [delete as appropriate] until we show you a picture of the dead-eyed madman in question. Wayne LaPierre, executive vice-president of the NRA, will be joining us later to explain how this situation could have been better resolved by adding more firearms and fewer regulations on their carry and use to the mix, and on how he's hijacked the best-known pro-gun advocacy group in the country to advance a paranoid, confrontational and lunatic-fringe agenda to create a polarised climate that undoubtedly influenced the unhinged shooter. We'll also examine in graphic detail how this week's calculated attack was but a hairs' breadth from being another mass-casualty massacre of the sort Americans have become depressingly inured to at 11; until then, I'm News Reader, and you've been watching Literally Any Goddamned Channel."""

And I'm not here to argue, I just want to point out two things though, if not to you, then at least to someone else who might read this.   As per the GCA of '68, any person who ""Has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution;"" is classed as a prohibited person (along with a number of other disqualifying situations) and is automatically prohibited at the federal (and most states also uphold this independently) level. So I would posit is that the real failure is in the legal system letting him off so easy, not that guns are too accessible. He assaulted multiple family members, made threats against schools/churches, and all he got was a slap on the wrist and a case dismissal after fulfilling ""several court-ordered conditions?"" One of which, I might add, must not have been psychiatric care as then he most likely would've been committed, and therefore became a prohibited person, and his later possessions of guns would have been a federal (and possibly state too, I'm not sure on Texas laws) offense. Wayne LaPierre's ideas and stances aren't themselves horrible per se, but you're right that he comes off like a lunatic, and neither he nor the NRA are generally the voice of most of the calm and rational ""Gun America."" In fact, most anti-firearms legislation prior to 1991, including the GCA '68, was supported by the NRA. As until '91, they predominately only pushed for the rights for guns as far as hunting was concerned, and no further; they were no better when it came to firearms for self-defense than the Pelosi-ist of left wingers. But even today they're still out there. And from what I've seen most of the NRA's support today comes from of two groups: A. ""Fudds"" or ""Bubbas"" who typically take the side of ""if it isn't for deer season, I don't care about it"" and B. People who want to support a gun lobby, but either take the stance of ""well the NRA's the only one out there/the other lobbies are too small to make a difference"" or they throw money at them and don't care one way or another.   And using this story to rationalize stricter gun-control is just as logical as using to it to advocate for the banning of ""Zombie Apocalypse Assault Vehicle and Troop Transports,"" in the sense that it's not.  EDIT: 3rd reading makes me lean towards it being satire, but still, allow this to stand as a most likely unread rebuttal to the identical news story that will pop up somewhere about this.

The space for ""Race of Father"" is filled in with the word ""African,"" which at the time was a descriptor that blacks who were actually native-born Africans (like Barack Obama's father was) were more likely to use for themselves than ""negro"" (the latter being synonymous with ""slave"" in Euro-colonial countries such as Kenya).  In 1895 the British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate, the forerunner of the country now known as the republic of Kenya. Although Kenya did not achieve complete independence from the United Kingdom until 1963, it was known as the Kenya Colony from 1920 onwards and was typically referred to as Kenya long before 1963. A search of news reports from 1961 (the year of Barack Obama's birth) turns up hundreds and hundreds of news articles referencing that entity simply as ""Kenya.""  The former Kapi'olani Maternity Home became the Kapi'olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital (where Barack Obama was born) in 1931, and it retained that appellation until 1971, when its name was shortened to Kapi'olani Hospital. The Kauikeolani Children's Hospital (where Barack Obama was not born) was a separate entity which merged with the Kapi'olani Hospital in 1978 to become the Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women and Children.   http://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-sr-wwii/   Both President Obama’s father and step father were obviously too young to fight in World War II. The video does catch the presidential candidate in a major blooper and he may have meant to say that his maternal grandfather fought in the war.  President Obama’s grandfather, Stanley Armour Dunham, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942 and served in the 1830th Ordnance Supply and Maintenance Company.

conspiratard,39kk41,Ardhen,10,Fri Jun 12 14:17:32 2015 UTC,Also this graph is suggesting the MMR vaccine increased the life expectancy   Why would this be odd? Less children dying from childhood illness would increase the overall life expectancy. Life expectancy statistics take infant/childhood mortality into account.. it would be odd for the life expectancy not to increase at least some at the introduction of the MMR.   There's no correlation that justifies these dots on a line graph.   The dots are placed at 'introduction dates' it's just that the person making up the graph didn't hit all the dots in the right spot.

conspiratard,39kk41,toms_face,3,Fri Jun 12 14:36:07 2015 UTC,I would assume that the other vaccines would increase the life expectancy in the same way due to children being vaccinated.  I'd have preferred if the notable events were all during or immediately before life expectancy spikes.

Well, most things don't push life expectancy up.. vaccines pushing life expectancy by reducing deaths by preventable illness does only by a statics fluke. Most of the life expectancy is medical technology advances (GMO would also affect alot more if we could get more out there.. less people starving, ect).. yeah i know vaccines fall in there.. but i'm talking more medicines and surgical techniques, sterilization, things like that.

conspiratard,39kk41,tash68,8,Fri Jun 12 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"Life expectancy figures always include infant mortality in their averages, which for the entirety of human history up until the very, very recent has been one of the most common ways to die. So when you hear that someone had an average life expectancy of 39 in the Middle Ages (or whatever the actual figure is), that doesn't actually mean that that was the average age at which people died, people lived almost as old as people lived today, but infant mortality rates were so astronomical that it drives the average down. All that's changed in the past 100 years is we've massively cut down on infant mortality, which brings the average life span much to closer to the actual number for people who make it past infancy.  If you saw death ages for a population plotted on a graph, it would look much the same as today, except the points above infancy would be sparser and there'd be a huge blob at the bottom left showing infant mortality.  EDIT: A wild number appeared! and I forgot how graphs worked for a second."
conspiratard,39kk41,Post_Capitalist,4,Fri Jun 12 23:42:42 2015 UTC,"These things are a little bit hard to calculate. But, generally speaking life expectancy takes infant mortality into account. If you factor out babies who die in child birth or children who die before the age of one life expectancy tends to increase by a lot,regardless of the time period in question. As a general rule throughout history the longer you live the greater your life expectancy becomes. For example, if you make it to age 10 in the middle ages you have a higher life expectancy than some who is still 5. However things like improved medical techniques, access to food, and mass sanitation have made us live longer."

conspiratard,39kk41,Xelath,13,Fri Jun 12 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"My guess: since it's births per woman, in the developing world with higher infant mortality rates, you might need more births to get a child that lives past infancy."
conspiratard,39kk41,dumael,10,Fri Jun 12 18:02:23 2015 UTC,And developing countries don't tend to have developed pension systems. Having a large family in some ways acts as a pension as your kids can look after you in your old age.  Inadequate access to family planning services is another factor.  Or so my reptilian overlords taught me.
conspiratard,39kk41,MastaClar,5,Fri Jun 12 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"A couple of reasons.  In an undeveloped, agrarian society, a larger family is more beneficial because it is essentially free labor and a pension system over time.  They also have many children because infant and child mortality is incredibly high in comparison to the a developed nation that has vaccines and a functioning medical system.    When a society starts becoming industrial/developed, the birth rate initially stays the same but because they have access to medicine, including vaccines, their population increases by a large percentage given the lack of mortality.  Over time, the birth rate reduces because families don't need to have 6 children just to survive, but instead just have one or two.  The way they raise the children also changes because they are pouring their resources into raising just two children, so their quality of life and ""life chance""  increases (like access to better education, more parental involvment/focus and the like).  This also makes raising children much more expensive as well, so even if you did have 6 children, you likely wouldn't have the resources to properly raise and care for them all (and kids these days are very expensive).    There is also access to plenty of other things that reduce birth rate, like birth control and condoms, family planning, abortions, less focus on religion, etc.    Part of the reason there is an overpopulation problem in Africa and India is that they have not stopped having kids now that their infant mortality has been reduced.  In the case of some African nations, there are developed nations giving vaccines and medicine to agrarian societies which increases their life expectancy and lowers infant mortality, but they are having kids at the same rate.  Instead of a few of their children dying from preventable diseases, and ""planning"" (in a morbid sense) to have more children in the case of death, they are having most if not all of their children survive into adulthood which causes a mess.  Unless there becomes a large ""cost"" (like paying for all the expenses that we in developed nations have for children), there is little reason to not keep having 6 children in poor areas.  Heck in some areas, like Ethiopia, it is a social class thing to have more children (more children=more wealthy) but that ""rule"" hasn't applied since the introduction of modern medicine as well as cheaper food.    Education and changing of tradition/culture is what will help reduce the birth rate in some places, while increasing the quality of life and wages will reduce it in other places (or more likely, everywhere), as well as increasing the cost of living so that having more than a few children on an average wage would have you living in poverty (or near it)."

conspiratard,39n1ca,thebrandnewbob,9,Fri Jun 12 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"While everything here sounds totally plausible and true, I just have one small question:    The data collected using spectroscope indicated that these objects were made of materials that are several thousand times harder than anything ever developed on Earth.    What kind of spectroscope was this? UV? Infrared? If we have the technology to figure out how hard materials are with light, why isn't this technology everywhere? Why do we still have expensive and destructive hardness testing rigs? What don't the government want you to know?"
conspiratard,39n1ca,KingKha,7,Fri Jun 12 22:35:59 2015 UTC,"A million kilometers in a month is also just pitifully slow for a proper spaceship, about 0.38 km/s. A satellite needs to achieve about 20 million km in a month just to stay in orbit around the Earth, and is very far away from even bare-minimum interstellar speeds. Like, seriously, ask them if we need to send the Space Shuttle as a tow truck.  A reasonable value for aliens with Earth-like technology but slightly more determination and a very laid-back attitude about excessive use of nuclear power is 0.1 c or 29,979 km/s or 78 billion kilometers in a month. And it would still take decades to visit other stars. Hyperadvanced aliens might arrive at 0.995 c or instantly if you want to allow FTL."

The planets were suffering a tremendous problem with overpopulation. Xenu's draconian solution to the matter was to gather large numbers of people, kill them, freeze their thetans (souls), and transport the frozen thetans to Earth, which they called Teegeeack. The thetans were left in the vicinity of volcanoes, which were, in turn, destroyed in a series of nuclear explosions. Members of the galactic Federation eventually rebelled against Xenu, fighting him for six years before he was finally captured and imprisoned on a planet that today is barren desert. Within the ""mountain trap"" on this unnamed world, Xenu still lives. http://altreligion.about.com/od/mythologicalfigures/a/xenu.htm   Nah, Xenu's imprisoned right now.

IF, it is a celestial body, it's going to be either Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, or Pluto. It's going to be neigh on impossible to see Pluto, so that's out. Normally Mars is more orange-ish in color, but it's hard to tell if there's a distortion with he Camera. At just before daybreak, Jupiter should be a lot lower in the Horizon. That leaves Saturn. Venus is not visible at all during this from 0500 - dawn on this day in Sacramento. The moon, however, is visible during this time frame, and is actually a lot smaller when unobstructed, but perhaps not that tiny. So, depending on when this was taken, my money says it could be either Saturn or Jupiter, leaving mars as a possibility.

Uh, why would anyone think that cures autism?   When the BBC sent the chemicals to Kent Scientific Services, an independent laboratory, they were found to be 57% and 45% stronger than the advertised concentration respectively.   Ah, delicious stuff: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chlorite   The researcher then met Mr Edwards at King's Cross Station for a paid-for demonstration as to how they should be mixed and imbibed.  Mr Edwards told him: ""It's helping people get well from all sorts of diseases - cancer, HIV, malaria. It's cleaning the body out. And nearly all the illnesses are getting removed with this.   Bwahahahahahahaha.   ""I'm not gonna say cure... because I can get in trouble. I'd say purge. It can purge autism. Alzheimer's too.   If it actually worked then you could say cure, dumbass.   ""170 children have had their diagnosis removed of autism in four years.""   Bwahahahahahahaha.   Mr Edwards advised 27 drops of MMS per day for a baby - administered with a baby's bottle.

Halbig's claim was made without a shred of evidence or investigation; based on similarity of this photo from  the state EMS website.    It is a fact, sheeple, that two people cannot look similar to each other without in fact being the same person! This is how we know that the Sandy Hook kids that were fake-killed were singing at the Super Bowl!   Opposite of the hoaxers; rather than using photos and invented FALSE narratives to raise funds, SandyHookFacts conducted a simple, free, email public information request through the Connecticut State Police PIO office and the State Police timely responded.  As part of the request, we sent them a screen shot from the Dash Cam and asked for the Trooper's name, rank, and troop assignment.  Thus, with a few moments of actual research, Sandy Hook Facts ascertained the identity of the trooper in the dash cam  From CSP CIO Office:  Sir, the trooper in the photo is Sgt. Troy Anderson and he works out of State Police Headquarters in Middletown, CT.    Thank you,    Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection   Yeah but CSP is a government agency! Can you really trust them when they're in on the conspiracy??!"

Basic flight controls are the same, nothing else is. a 757 and 767 does not have a traditional GPS like a cessna or your car. it has a flight management computer ""FMC"" that is preprogramed with flight paths by the crew before takeoff for normal route of flight and contingency routes for emergencies at different points of the planned route. its is an extremely complex system that you are trained by the airline to operate over the course of months, it is not something that they would have even remotely been exposed to in the very limited flight training they had. there just simply is not a way for people with no training to jump in the cockpit and program in a new route.   The FMC communicates with the airline when the pre-planned route is altered unexpectedly. The airline would have known that the flight plan was changed immediately and been able to get word out to the FAA that there were 4 rouge planes in the sky heading back towards the east coast.   I know these things because I am a pilot and aviation professional for the last 20 years, though I do not fly aircraft of this size I know what I am talking about."

They did have months of training, or at least enough for some of them to get commercial pilot's licenses.  I admit I'm not a pilot, but even I find it hard to believe that this computer is so complicated that it wouldn't be possible for someone with some flight training to figure out ahead of time what needed to be done to reroute the plane. It's not like they needed to be experts in the whole thing, just be familiar enough with it to program a waypoint. They could have studied manuals or gotten some simulator training for this, I would think.  This is of course assuming they used the computer (I have no idea whether they did or didn't). It's just as possible they manually flew it."

conspiratard,39b9y9,Biffingston,-12,Thu Jun 11 20:21:35 2015 UTC,"http://www.b737.org.uk/images/fmc.jpg  It is a very complicated unit. not designed for ease of use but for reliability. it is not like most modern GPS units with drag and drop etc. you have to program in the code names of the points of the route manually, one wrong digit or letter and you get into a state of discontinuity that will lock the route until it is resolved. so in order to program it you must have pretty intimate knowledge of the airspace around you. you can alternately program in lat and long but again, this is communicated to the airline so would raise red flags.   the level of expertise needed to operate a modern FMC like that of a 757 and 767 is pretty large. the GPS in a cessna etc.  is basically like a calculator wristwatch in comparison technologically.   edit   Also, considering how far along in the routes they were when highjacked, there is no way they navigated without the FMC all the way back to NYC and DC, it simply is not possible that they got three planes back to those specific points with such precision using landmarks."
conspiratard,39b9y9,Imperiousdesigns,19,Wed Jun 10 23:16:38 2015 UTC,"About the most complicated thing they'd have to do on the FMC is resolve a discontinuity event, which isn't especially difficult to memorise (you just press the soft key for the last node before the discontinuity and then the soft key for the first after, iirc - or maybe it's after first, then before, either way).  60 minutes training on any high end FSX (or any earlier MS Flight sim high fidelity model) boeing model would do it - and boeing/honeywell FMCs are all pretty much the same, so once you've learnt one, it'll apply to the rest for the majority of situations.  Flight simmers do thousands of full flights with near-100% simulations of the honeywell FMC every day, it's not THAT complex. And the terrorists only had to get where they wanted, if they failed, they failed, they didn't need the thousands of hours of training to fly the plane without crashing."
conspiratard,39b9y9,PinkBalloons,5,Wed Jun 10 23:42:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that it isn't complicated, I'm just saying that there is nothing to indicate (to me, at least) that the hijackers couldn't have learned enough of it to do what they needed to with the level of training they had.  To suggest otherwise says that you believe in some weird 9/11 conspiracy.  Edit: yes, downvote me, because I'm obviously the crazy one here."
conspiratard,39b9y9,BoilerButtSlut,-14,Thu Jun 11 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"My point is simply that with the level of training and exposure to the types of aircraft they would have had even up to receiving a commercial licence that they would have had no practical training or even exposure to such a system, as was said though in an earlier reply there are some very good simulations of the FMC available on some flight sim addons, this is where I learned how to work the system. those simulations are however not 100 percent sims of all the FMC systems as this would obviously be a security risk.   This is where my knowledge of the FMC heads into theoretical range. I am friends with a man who flew 737's for several years and he has said that there are certain lockouts in the form of a sign in (assuming a pin number type of thing) for changing from the pre programmed route and contingency routes. however I cant speak to this as fact, only hearsay.   My main point though isnt really specific to the FMC, only that is demonstrative of the level of complexity of these aircraft compared to small regional aircraft that a newly minted commercial pilot would have experience with.   As for conspiracy theories, I suppose there are some possibilities there. IE: perhaps the highjackers had more flight training than was discovered or revealed. shrug that isn't to imply that they were CIA trained or some such, as some of the theories go."

conspiratard,39b9y9,Mrs_Brisby,16,Wed Jun 10 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"As I've explained in at least one prior column, Hani Hanjour's flying was hardly the show-quality demonstration often described. It was exceptional only in its recklessness. If anything, his loops and turns and spirals above the nation's capital revealed him to be exactly the shitty pilot he by all accounts was. To hit the Pentagon squarely he needed only a bit of luck, and he got it, possibly with help from the 757's autopilot. Striking a stationary object -- even a large one like the Pentagon -- at high speed and from a steep angle is very difficult. To make the job easier, he came in obliquely, tearing down light poles as he roared across the Pentagon's lawn. It's true there's only a vestigial similarity between the cockpit of a light trainer and the flight deck of a Boeing. To put it mildly, the attackers, as private pilots, were completely out of their league. However, they were not setting out to perform single-engine missed approaches or Category 3 instrument landings with a failed hydraulic system. For good measure, at least two of the terrorist pilots had rented simulator time in jet aircraft, but striking the Pentagon, or navigating along the Hudson River to Manhattan on a cloudless morning, with the sole intention of steering head-on into a building, did not require a mastery of airmanship. The perpetrators had purchased manuals and videos describing the flight management systems of the 757/767, and as any desktop simulator enthusiast will tell you, elementary operation of the planes' navigational units and autopilots is chiefly an exercise in data programming. You can learn it at home. You won't be good, but you'll be good enough. ""They'd done their homework and they had what they needed,"" says a United Airlines pilot (name withheld on request), who has flown every model of Boeing from the 737 up. ""Rudimentary knowledge and fearlessness."" ""As everyone saw, their flying was sloppy and aggressive,"" says Michael (last name withheld), a pilot with several thousand hours in 757s and 767s. ""Their skills and experience, or lack thereof, just weren't relevant."" ""The hijackers required only the shallow understanding of the aircraft,"" agrees Ken Hertz, an airline pilot rated on the 757/767. ""In much the same way that a person needn't be an experienced physician in order to perform CPR or set a broken bone."" That sentiment is echoed by Joe d'Eon, airline pilot and host of the ""Fly With Me"" podcast series. ""It's the difference between a doctor and a butcher,"" says d'Eon.   http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Flight_School_Dropouts"
conspiratard,39b9y9,Orbis_Non_Sufficit,7,Wed Jun 10 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"Planes even 15-20 years ago were heavily automated. It's already known that they had commercial pilot training (and a few of them had licenses). You only really need to know a few things on the plane to fly it if you're not interested in taking/landing and don't care about the safety of the passengers. It's just a matter of putting in waypoints and lowering elevation, both of which can be done on the computer. The last minute or less can be done with the stick to reach the target. The weather was perfectly clear that day and the buildings can be seen miles away. It wasn't difficult at all."
conspiratard,39b9y9,BoilerButtSlut,10,Wed Jun 10 18:04:32 2015 UTC,I hate to be that guy but the 747 is a completely different plane that wasn't involved in any of the 9/11 attacks.

conspiratard,39b9y9,Doctor_Insano_PhD,4,Thu Jun 11 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"I have no knowledge of how to pilot an airplane of any size or how they handle. I've heard that the bigger ones are far more stable or less likely to crash than the little ones but I could be recalling that incorrectly. My question for anyone who knows more than me is: would it be relatively simple to do the bare minimum of what the hijackers had studied and face little to no challenge in regards to controlling the plane/keeping it in the air from the time after takeoff and before descent for landing? If that's the case, it seems then that wouldn't require a great amount of skill or practice to simply keep it going until finally acting like a suicidal lunatic and smashing it into a skyscraper?  I'm really shitty with mechanics of stuff so I could be asking very stupid questions but I'm honestly curious. The only thing to compare this to that I've experienced is me driving a manual. My husbands car is a stick shift and, while I can drive it somewhat, I'm still adjusting to the starting from a dead stop in first gear stuff at the beginning of a drive/intersections. It's very easy for me, however, to drive on the interstate in between wherever I start and wherever I end up because I have to be a lot less precise/perfectly timed. So that's where I'm coming from on the ""is the middle part of the flight super challenging"" curiosity."

conspiratard,39b9y9,Biffingston,3,Thu Jun 11 03:00:09 2015 UTC,"Yes but from what I've read, Atta and the guys training with him got kicked out of the program they attended because they weren't really listening to the flight instructor, wanted to do what they thought was important during their lessons, and didn't seem interested at all in learning how to land (no wonder.) So they had hands on training but didn't complete it. And that was with very small planes. I would imagine it's a different expect to fly a small 4 person plane than a 757. But, with the commercial airliners, there's a lot more automation to help the pilots. So, yeah, they took some training but researched the rest of it with manuals and observation, never hands on experience. But I just don't know how difficult it would be if you've studied and are really damned determined to get a plane to a specific point if all you have to do is maneuver it once it's already I  flight and crash it into pretty large buildings that are easily recognizable."

conspiratard,3973ef,grandhighwonko,5,Wed Jun 10 03:04:06 2015 UTC,"Its not quite that simple. Somewhere around 60 farmers a year get murdered here. While that is a high figure, we murder each other a lot generally. Around 50 South Africans a days are murdered. Add in that South African farms are remote, wealthy and have a gigantic gap in wealth between the farmers and their workers, plus a cultural tendency towards total disdain for those workers and you can see where the murders come from.  White farmers in South Africa are attractive targets due to their wealth, their history of dehumanisation and how hard it is for our overextended and corrupt police to be able to protect them because of how far they are from police stations.  Its not genocide. If it is genocide its the slowest and most inefficient genocide in history. Even the EFF, which I despise, is more like Mugabe than it is like Hitler. Julius Malema taking power would lead to farm invasions and nationalisation in a similar fashion to what happened in Zimbabwe. It would be deeply unjust and awful, but not genocide.  All of the figures I've seen that describe genocide seem to work off the assumption that if a white farmer no longer farms, that means they got murdered, ignoring the White South African diaspora and our rate of urbanisation.  Having said that, I do actually support the petition's aims if not its contents. As a second generation descendant of English colonialists I can return to Europe with no issue, but white afrikaners cannot and my children cannot, and the state does increasingly institute racist policies discriminating against them.  They are in South Africa because of the actions of the European powers, and so it should be the responsibility of those powers to shelter the descendants of those they sent there against discrimination and oppression."

conspiratard,3973ef,grandhighwonko,3,Wed Jun 10 07:20:33 2015 UTC,"No of course they're not asking for it, but the fact is that we live in a deeply violent country where people are murdered for their money constantly. 60 murders a year means about 0.3% of total murders. If you look at whites in general, we are are 1.8% of murder victims despite being nearly 9% of the population. It is not genocide.  Now some points about Mugabe, Mugabe's genocide was against other black people not white people. Trust me I know, my family left Zimbabwe because of the Gukurahundi.   Also while some white Zimbabweans died during the farm invasions it was rare and not a genocide. Both Mugabe and Malema are after the money not the blood. Mugabe has never killed white people for being white and neither will Malema. They will rob them for being white, but that's a different kettle of fish.  They may say that they are like Hitler, but they're nothing like him."

As I said they are after the money and they know that killing white people slams shut the world's coffers.  Anyway, that genocide was as much Kim Il Sung's as it was Mugabe's.   He runs around singing ""kill the Boer.""   First of all, he doesn't any more since he got sued for it, second of all that song is not as straightforward as it seems. It originates from the struggle, and Boer in that context is particularly about white oppressors. The ones who instituted and enforced apartheid. It was controversial when he sang it and there were arguments on both sides, but our Human Rights Council finally ruled against him and the song is no longer sung.  Well it is, but he's changed the words to ""kiss the Boer"".  South Africa has genuine issues with racist policies instituted against whites, and increasingly also the coloured communities, but there's no reason to get hyperbolic. White South Africans do not face genocide from the ANC and most certainly don't from the EFF either. We can protest against institutional racism without inventing conspiracies of genocide."
conspiratard,3973ef,MRB2012,0,Wed Jun 10 07:52:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, but not against white people   You don't think he'd do it? Why not?

conspiratard,396u7k,NewJerseyFreakshow,4,Tue Jun 9 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"About that general:   A key sponsor of the Stargate Project (a remote viewing project) at Fort Meade, Maryland, Stubblebine was convinced of the reality of a wide variety of psychic phenomena. He required that all of his battalion commanders learn how to bend spoons in the manner of celebrity psychic Uri Geller, and he himself attempted several psychic feats, in addition to walking through walls, such as levitation and dispersing distant clouds with his mind. Stubblebine was a key leader in the U.S. military invasion of Grenada (1983) and was, according to a report published by the Daily Mail, ""at the heart of America's military machine"" at that time.[3] After some controversy involving the experiments with psychic phenomena, including alleged security violations from uncleared civilian psychics working in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs), Stubblebine took ""early retirement"" from the Army in 1984.[7] (This occurred after an incident at which Stubblebine offended Gen. John Adams Wickham, Jr. — then U.S. Army Chief of Staff — by offering to perform a spoon-bending feat at a formal gala. Wickham viewed such phenomena as associated with satanism.[8])   Oh ok, I'm guessing he used his psychic powers to figure out 9/11, chemtrails, and Jade Helm."

conspiratard,396u7k,Commisar,2,Fri Jun 12 02:58:01 2015 UTC,"Army's a weird place bro. Especially when it comes to getting to the higher ranks. At that point in our history it was as much about who you knew and where you were from and went to school as it was how effective you were as a leader. Because when an officer starts out there career they are in charge of like 30 guys. From there as the years go on the number of guys they're in charge of can get quiet big pretty quickly. Within 15-20 years they're responsible for the lives and deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of guys. I mean, by their late twenties or mid thirties as a company commander it can be almost 200 guys. Nowhere in a platoon or company command does anybody go ""hey sir can you read my mind and levitate this pen?"" And suddenly you've got a guy who really believes he can levitate a pen at a high enough rank where nobody is gonna say ""hey, sir, do you REALLY think you can walk through that wall?"" Because ultimately he's got the ability to completely ruin a subordinate's life. So now imagine he's in his early 40s, he's a colonel up for general, the promotion goes before congress. The congressmen don't go ""yo does this name on the list here think he can walk through walls?"" They go ""how many IG complaints has he had? Has anybody ever accused him of sexual assault, has he had a DUI? Who hates him, why? Is he in any debt?""   It's basically one of those things that kinda sneaks up on everybody. Because sure the joes under his command are gonna be all ""yo you think the Lt seems a bit weird?"" And ""hey man you know I heard that the battalion XO is a weird dude, man"" but nobody is gonna sit down and say ""well we all got together and decided that you're a fuckin weirdo sir."""

Did you just indirectly refer to Holographic Theory as a conspiracy theory?  Sure, the direction that they are discussing the topic from (more mystical than scientific) leaves much to be desired, but holographic theory (or more precisely holofractography) is orders of magnitude more accurate at predicting the charge nucleus radius of the proton than even String Theory is.  Remember, people thought Richard Feynman was a lunatic for close to a decade before his drawings were finally accepted.  Quantum Electrodynamics and indeed most of particle physics are the result.  Shit, we wouldn't even have microprocessors without QED.  New theories in physics that eventually prove true very rarely seem sane at the time of their conception.    If you want to know more about the ideas of Holographic Theory or holofractography, a good starting point is the book ""The Holographic Universe"" by Michael Talbot."

We are now the only developed country in the world* not formalised to what has long been the global system. (SI is much older and much more pervasive than most Americans know. Even our standard U.S. measures are fixed by statute, at the federal level, too SI -- as far back as 1866.) Our sole reliance on an outdated system that no one else uses for science and commerce costs us a fantastic amount of money -- money we could be making, instead of spending or losing.  Americans treat metric like some weird, foreign thing, but we rely on it every day. We have no choice, because we're deeply entwined in an ever-shrinking global community who already know it top to bottom. Every day we go without matching their knowledge, we get further behind scientifically, technically, and economically. Mastery of metric is one of several important keys to profitable fluency in the global community. Our resistance to learning it and using it is childish and very costly.  What's really stupid is that this was all avoidable, and we very nearly did avoid it. I'm old enough to remember when metric was actively taught in this country, as a nationwide effort was underway to bring the U.S. into the 20th Century (seven decades late, but hey). That was cut short by the Reagan Revolution, because the kinds of people who were swept up in the 'anti-liberal' side of that movement irrationally considered metric to be part of some greater European (today they'd probably say 'French') cultural sweep across this country (instead of finally getting around to learning the global system that every other important country was already standardised to). Thanks to the more boneheaded Reaganites, we're now more than a century behind the rest of the world. And it's costing us dearly, especially the longer it goes on.  * Only two other countries in the entire world are not standardised to it -- Liberia and Burma (Myanmar). The UK uses it side by side with Imperial measures (not identical to our U.S. measures, most of which have the same names, adding yet more needless confusion), but is still formally standardised to metric. Though they still use their pounds and ounces, they also strictly use Celsius, and they are all fluent in metric, while we remain not."

conspiratard,38w46o,emkay99,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:07:40 2015 UTC,"Urban areas should have more representation than rural areas, but the size of the voting block is also a factor.   Let's imagine a situation where a city has a population of 20 and there are 6 small towns each with a population of five. each community has it's own issues and priorities, but in the legislature bills that favor the city almost always pass and bills that favor the smaller communities almost never because they lack the unity of the city. so 40% of the people get 100% of the government.  to compensate for this districts tend to be drawn to give smaller population centers a disproportionate amount of power relative to their population. At this point in time it's probably too much, but to go straight to rep by pop means that people in smaller community would have almost no say in government."

conspiratard,38w46o,emkay99,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:23:50 2015 UTC,"Anyone who lives in flyover country would be effectively disenfranchised by that. As an urban coastie, I already enjoy a disproportionate amount of political power over people in places like Kansas. While I'm sure many of my fellow urbanites and coasties would be happy to have even more, eliminating the Electoral College would effectively hand us permanent remote control of the Breadbasket and other huge but sparsely populated areas of the country. And I rely on those places for food, but I don't know how to run giant agricultural areas anywhere near as well as people out there, and shouldn't have that much control over those places.  The system we have right now forces me to at least consider what folks out there think and want, and that's the way it should be. If you eliminate the Electoral College, anyone can win effectively permanent power by simply appealing to a very small number of very large cities. It would create a kind of modern feudalism, where states like Wyoming would have pretty much no meaningful political power at all. I personally believe we'd do a terrible job of it, and we'd end up being selfishly unfair to those people. Maybe they'd give up in despair and move to where we are, where they could have more power. Then what? Who will grow our food after that?  The US is too huge to concentrate that much power in so few and small places. Part of our strength is not merely our diversity of people, but our diversity of place, and the power that rural peoples have only because the Electoral College protects it. If we want to keep doing well, we need to preserve that protection. And as someone from an area that would benefit enormously (in the short term) from dissolving the Electoral College, I will fight that dissolution. I don't believe we can survive the long term without it."
conspiratard,38w46o,GoshDarnMamaHubbard,2,Sun Jun 7 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"But the President (and, for that matter, the Congress, theoretically) is supposed to make decisions and policies for the country as a whole. Not just for people in west Texas or Kansas, or just for people in Manhattan. Your congressman is supposed to look after your local interests -- not the president. And why should the vote of an individual who lives in Idaho be worth more intrinsically than a person who lives in Chicago? How is that democratic?  In addition, as the country becomes more and more urbanized (an inevitable process), the small-town/rural areas are careful to keep a tighter and tighter grip on their state's electoral politics, via the legislature's control of voting districts and procedures. Those in power will fight to keep it. So the imbalance will only get worse and worse.  Not to mention, if I'm a thoroughgoing liberal, and I live in a depressingly conservative state (my actual situation, as it happens), my single vote will have zero effect on my state's position in the Electoral College. Which means I'm effectively disenfranchised, for any election beyond the city council and the school board.  If people would think of themselves by default as ""Americans,"" not Southerners, or Kansans, or Berkeleyites, this wouldn't be a problem. I've lived a lot of places, in various parts of the country, and our continuing (growing) balkanization is not a good thing."

Despite the fact that no babies are going into the Osterizer, if any use at all of a cell line that derived from an aborted fetus is morally objectionable to you, I can see why you might have a problem with the testing company.

Yes, I understand it's a stupid site.

conspiratard,38p5m5,Ardhen,17,Fri Jun 5 18:20:10 2015 UTC,"Jurisdiction   The tricky thing about Space Law is that nobody actually has jurisdiction in space. It's like Antarctica - international legislation has defined the space as neutral territory with national facilities. This is true even on the ISS - if you committed a crime on the Space Station, you'd be under the jurisdiction of whatever country built the module you committed the crime in. Kill a person in the Destiny module? American law applies. Shank a foo in the Columbus Lab? EU law.  Now, the way that space is controlled - since nobody has legal control over orbits or space itself - is by controlling the means of getting into space. You can put a satellite into orbit, sure, but if you try to launch a rocket without FAA clearance you'll get so many penalties slapped down you'd think that you were paying off the national debt singlehandedly. Even if you get a legal launch, and then shift your mission parameters (boost into unauthorized orbit), you'd be under jurisdiction of wherever you had your ground stations.   All said, however, it's a very unexplored legal territory because honestly it hasn't posed a problem yet - most all disputes regarding orbital space and launch authorization is already covered under international agreements and through the ITU. It goes without saying, however, that an individual city council has absolutely zero jurisdiction over space and absolutely zero means of enforcing such a law."

Here's a brilliant comment that I found providing a perfect deconstruction.  ""This ""documentary"" is pure propaganda, Goebbels would be proud. America entered WW1 because they intercepted a telegram from Germany to Mexico which offered Mexico American territory in Texas and along the border if they started war with the United States on the idea that it would keep America distracted and therefore out of Europe. Although a unification with Austria and the Sudetenland seemed fair because they were all German speakers, Hitler occupied the entire of Czechoslovakia. He took the Sudetenland first because along the frontier with Germany stood the Czech fortifications and after acquiring that area he seized the rest of the country where a majority of the population was not German. He invaded Poland because they refused to give up the port of Danzig to link East Prussia with the rest of Germany, not because Germans were being persecuted. The Poles did not want to anger Germany by persecuting Germans as their military was clearly outdated. Hitler designed a military operation where Germany killed a handful of Poles, put them in German clothing, and announced over the radio that the Poles had massacred a number of Germans as a pretext to the invasion. They talked about the Allied bombing campaigns over Dresden and other German cities but neglected to mention the Luftwaffe bombing of Rotterdam in NEUTRAL Holland as well as the bombing and subsequent V1 and V2 attacks on London. They left out the Kangaroo court where Judge Roland Friesler handed out the death penalty for offenses so minor including peaceful opposition to the Nazi Party. German citizens part of the White Rose were executed for writing pamphlets telling the truth about what was being done to individual freedom. Children in school were told that anybody who disagreed with National Socialism including their parents should be reported to the Gestapo. In regards to the Genevia convention, neither Germany or Russia followed it in regards to each other. As far as the Western Allies were concerned, they were treated better but it was Hitler himself who ordered the murder of the recaptured British officers from Stalag Luft 3, even going against Goering on the issue. This was a major breach of the Geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war. Most Jews were not communists, they were just normal people living their lives peacefully. During the war they were forcibly removed from their houses and sent to concentration camps. With the exception of Denmark, and only due to the help of the Danish people, Jews and Gypsies from all the occupied countries who could not escape or hide shared similar fates. The part of this video dealing with the concentration camps is ridiculous. They showed the actual propaganda film they were going to use during the war about Thereisenstadt which made it appear that the Jews were being treated humanely. Auschwitz did not only hold Jews but German dissidents as well as political rivals from all over occupied Europe and all of the people interned there described it as hell on earth. I highly doubt the poor inmates could take time out of their slavery to go for a nice swim, They can try to change the number of people murdered but one only has to look at the pre-war populations of countries where Jews were rounded up and look at the post-war numbers including those who were able to flee abroad to see what the approximate number is of who were killed. They killed women and young children which cannot be excused regardless of what ""race"" they are. They try to prove that they did not use gas to kill the Jews by hiring the discredited David Cole (only because he's Jewish) to make phony arguments which I hope people who watch this aren't naïve enough to believe. Even the Germans who worked at Auschwitz admitted to the use of gas to kill large numbers of people quickly. It was not done in all the camps, only the ones in Poland, far away from Germany because they did not want the German population to know what was happening to their former neighbors. None of this excuses any war crimes committed by the Allies but anybody who believes this film is any more than propaganda is either easily tricked or wants so much to justify Hitler's actions they refuse to accept the truth. A good lie is filled with truths to make the lie look more authentic.""  By Andrew Kapla."

conspiratard,38h7e1,TropicalPunch,2,Thu Jun 4 09:07:14 2015 UTC,"Some of the comments on that website are fucking hilarious   Ok, please allow me to be the one that goes way, way out into the darkness we now call government. Here it comes:Let’s face it, if the government is using Wal Marts as prisons or detention centers then they have truly lost their minds. Wal Marts, no matter how big, just do not have the square footage to house population em mass, so let’s close the book on that scenario once and for all. Any other purpose for a Wal Mart to house military personnel or DHS personnel is still not very credible. But if they are refurbishing the insides with secret stuff and for no apparent good reason revamping the ventilation system, plus entering and exiting by tunnels then per chance does ZYKLON B come to one’s mind. In case anyone needs a refresher course in this chemical it was dropped down the ventilation shafts into large rooms disguised as showers: And the smell of ZYKLON B was the last odor about three million innocent Jews ever got a whiff of on this side of eternity. Before anyone writes this off as fear mongering, please go read your history books and you’ll see just how quickly a benign military exercise such as JH15 can morph into uncontrolled, unrequited mass murder. Depopulation is depopulation and as if you didn’t already know, killing people is the only way to depopulate. People are used to almost daily going into and out of Wal Marts and just seeing the Wal Mart sign will relax them a little as if to say, “Everything is ok.” Believe it or not there used to be a saying at the Nazi concentration camps, “Arrive by train, leave by chimney.” Talk about a blue light special! thanks   Or this one:   Isn’t it clear. We will be slaves to China. Our debt must be paid, a quadrillion dollars. Russians Troops will take our possessions and China will get the land and the resources. Nothing really left to say.   I should have known it was china.    WalMart has lied to us about this being a plumbing problem, something evil is a foot. Let’s not put up with this. I have “Closed” my “Walmart Charge Card”, and I am now Boycotting them. My family now buy’s all our food at Krogers. Let’s “ALL” start a “Nation Wide Boycott” of Walmart..   I love this. USAID is CIA?  The more you know   Thank you for all your research and hard work to expose the agenda of this illuminati-globalist cabal to facilitate their New One World Order! I remember back in 1994 when a former military veteran told me about the survey they had to fill out on whether they would help to disarm American civilians or shoot them if they resisted. At the time I wasn’t awake yet and thought that he was full of BS. Now, we all realize that the disarmament agenda truly reaches that far back! As a former over-the-road trucker, I watched the government install black boxes into commercial vehicles for control of all distribution of goods and the ability to disable any trucks. Of course, we know now that this same technology is now in all new civilian passenger vehicles. They now can send a truck through a huge x-ray device that can identify something as minor as one bullet that shouldn’t be there. Another major concern will be the Food Safety Act that they haven’t started fully enforcing, YET! Food will shortly be used as a weapon! Having recently attended college to brush up on my writing skills, another enlightening moment came when the professors were encouraging students to be foreign exchange students. It seemed as if the speaker slipped when mentioning that once you took advantage of that, like she did, you were indebted to spend a year working for the USAID. Isn’t that often a front for CIA? Thanks again for all you do!"

For example, a ""false flag operation"" is a terrorist act committed by one group for the express purpose of discrediting another group, which is framed for it. False flag operations in warfare are usually conducted at sea. They are generally speaking illegal, although there are loopholes. The object is to disguise one's own vessel as friendly to the enemy until it is possible to engage said enemy.        The term comes from when a ship would fly a flag as friendly, and then change it to enemy when close by to fire/board by deception."
conspiratard,38c8hl,By_Design_,15,Wed Jun 3 07:47:29 2015 UTC,"The most disturbing thing about this is when he starts relating it to his political agenda, and that listeners are buying into his insanity. His combination of paranoia, appeal to religious fervor (demons, evil, etc.), and lack of identification of the shadowy enemy is what concerns me the most. It seems that this kind of rhetoric could trigger paranoid mentally ill people to insert their own ""enemies"" and to become agitated by the heated rhetoric. More broadly, his anti-government agenda is the most concrete identification of the ""enemy"", aside from his appeals to xenophobia and social conservatism, which I worry serves to whip up far-right extremists, who tend to be well armed. I am not comfortable with the notion of right-wing extremists and paranoid mentally ill people believing that the government/whoever are ""coming for them"" and are ""demons"" motivated by their love of nugget porn and crush porn. Alex Jones is a fucking asshole. It's disturbing enough that I had to learn what those terms mean by watching this."

Maybe he has very high functioning aspergers with a hyper interest in documents and conspiratorial narratives. People try to paint him as a tv evangelist style scam artist, but I think he actually believes in the pitch and it just feeds into his own confirmation bias.

Let me counter that: last weekend, I did something that was legal. I'm 95% certain sometime in the next 2 years what I did will be declared illegal. I wouldn't be able to be charged with a crime under current law; but do I really want it to be known that I have done that illegal thing?  and another: if you have ever held a security clearance, or even just a position of trust, would that have been possible if documentation of what you did between ages 16 & 21 was available? very, very few people can answer that one ""yes"" honestly."

Look at me. even with the 'gubement surveillance' I was a major player for 20+ years before they got me.. which they did either through NSA taps or cause someone I messed with screwed up.  Risk was VERY low.. VERY low.. and if I took 1 precaution I'd have been golden.. so yeah..   Problem with blanket surveillance is there's 7 billion people on the planet. Too much information.   would that have been possible if documentation of what you did between ages 16 & 21 was available?   Actually to get security clearance they can get sealed records.   However.. would you want someone who say tortured cats as a kid to hold the nuclear briefcase? :)  16-21 is way old enough to know right from wrong.

GM weed could be the best thing  for it."
conspiratard,383pc5,AdrianBlake,2,Tue Jun 2 00:14:13 2015 UTC,"Purposefully breeding high THC strains does not necessarily reduce CBD percentages. And CBN is the ""anti-THC"" compound that helps cut down the more intense effects of THC. CBD is entirely non-psychoactive and is more known for it's anti-inflammatory uses and it's applications for dealing with seizures. Honestly, having grown and known even crazier growers, Monsanto doesn't have shit on your serious cannabis grower haha. We can do just fine ourselves, thanks."
conspiratard,383pc5,rhizomorphicoreos,4,Tue Jun 2 09:41:53 2015 UTC,"It doesn't necessarily mean less CBD but the breeding of the strains that make up 90% of the market did result in lower CBD:THC ratio.   And what Monsanto has over a grower is whilst a grower might want to increase a certain trait and just try until it looks like it's worked and you hope the rest of the traits are ok, genetic modification lets you change exactly what you want to change. Want more THC? Fine, duplicate the THC producing gene. Want more CBD, duplicate the gene producing that. Want to get rid of a toxin? Remove the gene that makes it. Want to make it taste like bbq sauce? Insert some gene that produces chemicals that smell like bbq sauce when burnt."
conspiratard,383pc5,Yanns,2,Tue Jun 2 11:07:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I was only kinda kidding about the Monsanto thing, ombré. But when things like hash oil (and obviously just hash) exist, the demand for a strain with a higher THC % than ones already existing seems unnecessary although I'm sure some jabroni might want to. Even still, not sure anyone would bother investing the time and money into it. Almost like trying to make a beer with the same alcohol % as liquor when liquor is already widely available (that analogy sucks, but I haven't had my morning coffee and joint yet, so, meh..).  Also, the breeding of higher THC strains may make the ratio more unbalanced, it doesn't really lower the amount of other cannabinoids, but having more THC does make the CBN less effective at cutting down the intensity of THC. Again, CBD isn't the issue as this has no effect on the user in the psychoactive sense. These other cannabinoids have always only been found as trace amounts- usually the highest CBD/CBN % is > 1%. If anything because of selective breeding there is more available strains with higher cannabinoid percentages because people wanted them (the ""Charlotte's Web"" strain for example). This also occurs naturally from phenotype to phenotype. Also, sativa dominant strains will always have less CBD/CBN because they just naturally are that way, while Indica strains tend to have a more notable entourage of other cannabinoids. It's a wacky, crazy plant- kinda like a natural chemistry set- kinda cool :)"

conspiratard,383pc5,GitEmSteveDave,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"Well like I said there's an upper limit to what the plant coulde carry. I mean the plant has to be able to grow and the THC isn't like 'blood' really if you look at the plant, the effects the most likely reason the  plant secrets a 'hallucinogenic substance' is probably a defense mechanism.  Actually there are toads use the same 'type' of defense... that being the case you can only get it to produce so much before it hampers plant growth.  Now there is a real and present danger with I think they call them 'dabs' or 'dubs'? Dunno.. damned kids and their slang! But it's basically extracted THC tar.. that you could ingest enough to get killed easily.  However.. I really doubt they could ever make 'killer pot'"

True enough if you subtract the silly dark matter reference.  Then these partciles induce various EM fields in the atmosphere and Earth. Also true.  Then CERN uses its giant coils to capture that energy. This is rather silly, but let's just roll with it...  Then CERN uses this energy in order to ... do bad things? I'm not clear on this. They could get this energy from burning fossil fuels or firing up a small nuclear reactor, too, so I'm not sure how this ties into any of his fears.

Lets say you live in the US and there were planes spraying chemtrail at commercial plane altitudes.  Those chemtrails would be so high up that they would not make landfall until it was around Europe or Africa and it would most likely take weeks or months before this happened.  On top of that the chemtrail would become so diluted as it spread out while it slowly blows around in the atmosphere that it would be harmless by they time it made it to the surface.

In all honesty, we wouldn't use Blue Bell trucks for something like this. No company wants their brand associated with mortuary response. That, and having bodies in the back of the truck ruins them for life. There's cities that keep refer trucks in impound as part of their mass fatality plans.

Mohammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, the founder of Wahhabism, was born around 1700. Wahhabism went 'big time' only after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire following World War I.  There were movements for Jews to return to the Land of Israel centuries before the term ""Zionism"" was coined.  Most of them were of a messianic character, but they were for a return of the Jews to their national homeland.  Many of them were fairly large and led to continuous settlement in the land.  Before the term 'Zionism' became generally accepted as the label for the Jewish nationalist movement, the term most used was the Russified 'Palestinofilstvo' (love of Palestine)."

It got him off the drugs, but for a couple years he was a little hoity-toity about it (though he never quite went Young Earth with it). Luckily I got him convinced that a Christian should give more weight to what Jesus said than what was written in, say, Leviticus. ""I come not to destroy the old law but to fulfill it"" is what got him to come around, and these days he's mega-chill about his faith."
conspiratard,37md4h,SPOOFE,6,Fri May 29 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"This has been going on at least since i was in high school in the early '90s. The root cause is that our schools don't teach critical thinking. They only teach random disjointed examples of good decisions that don't reinforce the overall concept. If you somehow pick it up outside of the education system you'll do well in real life, but if you don't your grades won't reflect it and you'll be released into society with an ability to solve word problems and an inability to understand modern advancements."
conspiratard,37md4h,BigTunaTim,7,Thu May 28 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"Ironically (or perhaps not so much), this is one of the key things Common Core attempts to address from the point of view of educational standards, and look how it's been received by most people/areas. For once, students were finally required to tie different subjects together, be able to consume new media properly, and be able to think about concepts over facts. And people boiled it down to weird 2nd grade math worksheets.  How do you keep people from wanting to be ignorant, and wanting their offspring to be?"
conspiratard,37md4h,drharris,3,Thu May 28 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"I'll confess that I don't have kids and have only seen Common Core worksheets that horrified me. I'm fully willing to accept that I've been hoodwinked if it's true, but my ideal education system doesn't impose uniform dictats across the broad range of social statuses and cultures that make up a modern school district. The idea that we should bring all kids up to the dame standard implies that we believe all kids start at the same baseline and that's beyond ridiculous."
conspiratard,37md4h,BigTunaTim,2,Thu May 28 20:59:18 2015 UTC,"This is because Common Core is still very new, so many school districts just bought pre-made curriculum to fulfill the mandate. Try to guess which companies came out with material first: those who take time to produce very useful resources and assessments that gauge proper knowledge of subject matter, or those who slap together something very quickly and are super confusing? Turns out the latter was quicker to the punch, got rich from it, and are slowly fizzling out. Common Core itself is mainly about minimum standards for education; hopefully each district goes above and beyond that. The good thing is that it does focus on ensuring every student should leave school knowing how to think critically and as geometrically as possible about a subject, rather than linear memorization.   The bad thing, however, is as you say. It is based on No Child Left Behind, which was really another way to say ""every child left behind, but every child graduates!"" We should be tracking students as much as possible. Instead, every child is a special snowflake that deserves to be in College Prep classes. So, now we have grade-level students, or even remedial students, who are in CP classes because they just had to do away with anything that sounds like one kid is less than another. So now actual CP students are being held back from potential, grade level students are struggling with material they really don't need, and teachers are forced to pass them all anyway.  So yeah, plenty of problems too, but they're more systemic rather than a function of Common Core itself. It just one fairly decent pillar on a crumbling foundation."
conspiratard,37md4h,drharris,5,Fri May 29 13:47:15 2015 UTC,"So, I have no doubt that there are worksheets produced with the intention of meeting the Common Core standards that are absolute garbage, but Common Core is nowhere close to writing worksheets. Common Core is basically a list of things that students should be competent in at certain grade levels; that's all. Here is an example of what Common Core actually looks like.  Also, there are particular things that really are in Common Core standards, but have been demagogued beyond all recognition. The example I've seen most often has to do with ""number sense"" type exercises, which are about driving home the fact that numbers are abstract conceptual building blocks that have a logical relationship independent of any particular rote technique. You don't make a 15% tip by pulling out a pen and doing long division on a napkin; you divide by ten and add half again as much. But try to communicate that to 2nd graders and you're accused of replacing long division with a bizarro mathematics where nothing is true and everything is permitted.  (Real talk: What the fuck is even the justification for teaching division and multiplication algorithms any more anyway? They add nothing to actual mathematical understanding and are as obviously superfluous today as cursive was when I screamed at my 3rd grade teachers about how they needed to stop wasting my fucking time with it in 1994.)"
conspiratard,37md4h,EvanHarper,5,Fri May 29 01:21:25 2015 UTC,"If you really believe that gaining concepts is superior to facts, then please don't beat down writing cursive or long division. There is a multitude of abilities gained from these activities. Not everything you learn in life needs a direct and practical application in order to justify learning something new. This is the exact thinking that is part of the problem."
conspiratard,37md4h,sporkafunk,-2,Fri May 29 11:40:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry, cursive writing is garbage.  Nearly all communication these days is electronic, so it's fairly useless in general.  In addition it's more difficult to read and the only benefit is writing by hand is a little bit faster when you use it.  Get rid of it."
conspiratard,37md4h,Constrict0r,3,Fri May 29 13:39:12 2015 UTC,"If you're not going to bother reading my entire response, or even question it, please don't waste my time with your reply."
conspiratard,37md4h,sporkafunk,-6,Fri May 29 13:43:00 2015 UTC,I read it I just don't agree.  Cry about it.
conspiratard,37md4h,Constrict0r,3,Fri May 29 16:12:54 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part, but there is definitely a place for things like long division too. The key point is that everybody has a different way of thinking - for some, divide by ten and add half more. For others, multiply by 15 and knock the last two numbers off. For still others, long division might make sense. A good teacher will show you all the ways, and also allow you to do it any of those ways. This is a really good thing. I remember losing points because I do the ""times 15 divided by 100"" method in my head, and it was painful to ""show my work"" when it wasn't what the teacher wanted to see. Modern methods finally allow for teaching kids how to do it in their head, but it's just still painful to show the work.  There's also a place for cursive, especially when it comes to being able to have a signature (which arguably may be a moot point in 15-20 years). A bigger thing is that kids can't even read cursive, which is a real problem from the perspective of appreciating history. An even bigger thing is total lack of penmanship, which is something they should be teaching/practicing at all levels, especially since it just takes 5 minutes per day. I wish they had, so I wouldn't be embarrassed to write on a whiteboard during business meetings."
conspiratard,37md4h,drharris,8,Fri May 29 13:54:17 2015 UTC,"Not everybody who pushes chemtrails is un- or mis-educated. Getting rid of conspiracism will also require dealing with people like Bob Fitrakis, a political science professor and perennial Green Party candidate with a law degree and his own newspaper.   I don't know what the answer is to people like him."
conspiratard,37md4h,AngelaMotorman,14,Fri May 29 05:04:37 2015 UTC,"I would say it's not just critical thinking, or the facts the schools teach - it's a desire to learn more about a topic and researching it yourself, rather than taking the lazy method of reading one article and saying, ""Yeah - that makes sense"".  I had a friend in the 90's that bragged about how many women he had sex with.  ""Aren't you worried about AIDS?"", I asked.  ""No - that was debunked.  They estimated 100's of millions of deaths and that never happened.  It was all blown out of proportion.""  He was right that the numbers never occurred (at least in the US).  But perhaps it wasn't that it was blown out of proportion, but because the word was getting out (to most people) and people were getting tested, using condoms, or flat out not having sex (at all or as often).  The original estimates by the CDC were based on the early stages of the spread - IF that continued and the word is not spread, huge numbers would die.  I believe he WAS using his critical thinking skills, but he wasn't researching the topic enough.  And who sounds more conspiracy minded - the person yelling doom and gloom, or the person who is calm and rational?  I think we see the same thing with Fox News - people are hearing several stories on the same topic by different people, and they all agree.  Who can blame them that they feel like ""they've listened to the facts and came to a reasonable conclusion""?  Edit: grammar"

They want a noble soothsayer to tell them that they're not buying into a bunch of manure and that somehow, someway, it's going to be all right because they have the truth.          He's actually missing something important here and, if this hasn't been said somewhere else by someone smarter before, then let it be recorded that /u/--shera-- first articulated the following analysis:         Ignorant assholes, especially but not exclusively those who are ideologically committed to climate change denial, have no way to account for the empirical realities confronting them every day. In fact, it is fear that motivates them: the same fear that should motivate all of us, the fear that global climate change is accelerating and its consequences becoming more serious all the time.         Yet these stupid motherfuckers--unable to think themselves out of a paper bag much less understand the complexity of global climate change and the vast resources needed to address it--handle this reasonable fear by manufacturing it into something manageable. And a global conspiracy run by a small group of evil people is more manageable than reality, where radical changes in our everyday lives are needed in order to slow greenhouse gas emissions, reduce pollution, etc.           The big issue here is how do you part people from the fucking idiotic political ideologies that commit them to these acts of cognitive dissonance."

Look, global climate rhetoric is apocalyptic because the situation is fucking awful! Even conservative estimates depict a pretty grim future that isn't all that far away.        The only way you can go to sleep at night with a peaceful mind, should the future of the world matter to you, would be if you believed it were possible to prevent terrible outcomes of global climate change and if you were already doing whatever you personally could to help fix the problem.        I think these chemtrail believers, for various reasons, grasp that something scary is going on with the environment, but aren't able or perhaps willing to confront real causes and solutions.

In Robert Gates' book ""Duty"" he talks about the failure of the western nations to Embrace Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union.  As compared to our behavior to post-war West Germany and Japan, where we invested tremendous capital and diplomatic energy into rebuilding them as allies, our attitude to Russia after the Cold War was more along the lines of ""we told you dumbasses you were wrong"".  As a result, Russians endured a decade of increasing financial ruin and political concessions and apologies.  Then in 1999 a conservative party defined largely by its hard-line stance on Chechnya and lead by an authoritarian Vladimir Putin is elected into power.    His continued support for the past 16 years can be easily understood when viewed in the context of a nation tired of being looked down upon.  Putin is arguably a de facto dictator, but he is also a strong symbol for Russians to stand behind.    Another interesting case of Russians rallying behind a strong figure, no matter how terrible he was, was the ""Name of Russia"") TV poll in which viewers were asked to vote for the greatest Russian.  Stalin, easily and by many different measures the worst Russian in several hundred years came in third, and only after accusations of vote rigging to help more politically acceptable people win."
conspiratard,37g4ur,Ianallyfisthorses,8,Wed May 27 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the book, so apologies if he went over this, but I think it was a failure of communication on both sides. Gates is correct that we were very dismissive of Russian concerns and complaints such as the way we dealt with Serbia. We also failed to understand the Russian way of thinking and what 70 years of communism had done to it. They literally had no concept of private property. Also the political system had lots of inherent corruption in it and that should have been dealt with first.  On the other hand, I don't think Russia explained things as well. It's clear from people who were involved with the privatization phase that they thought the way it was being done was a terrible idea, but they went along with it either because it benefited themselves, or they deferred to the Americans because they thought they knew what they were doing. I think they also had a habit of doing only halfway measures, so some political reforms would be done, but the overall corrupt structure remained underneath.  Part of the reason the satellite states did so well after communism compared to Russia itself is because they only had communism for about 40 years; you had lots of people still alive who remember how things were before communism. You still had people alive who remember how business worked and plenty of expats who came back in and helped with that. It also helped that communism was seen as a ""foreign"" import that was imposed on them. No such thing for Russia."
conspiratard,37g4ur,BoilerButtSlut,8,Wed May 27 15:47:11 2015 UTC,They literally had no concept of private property.   You are exaggerating it by a great measure.
conspiratard,37g4ur,Ilitarist,4,Wed May 27 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"OK, fair enough, I admittedly worded that poorly.  It is more accurate to say that there wasn't any legal concept of private property on the books. It wasn't protected in any way."

But for atheists? Nope. We're like the least self-aware community I've been a part of, which is really fucking odd considering how much we value skepticism and reason.  In any case, go re-listen to what she said. Not what people said she said, what she actually said."

conspiratard,37bhxp,AstrangerR,10,Tue May 26 17:42:52 2015 UTC,"Then why dye your hair like that if you don't think it represents you in some way?    The problem is that you're assuming that people who look that way are assholes.  You have no idea why someone decides to dye their hair, it's very likely that they just like how it looks.     If I wore a cross necklace, I wouldn't be offended by people assuming I was Christian   If everyone assumed you were an asshole and started treating you like one for wearing that necklace, you'd probably be upset.  How are you so obtuse that you can't see the difference between assuming someone is a certain religion and assuming someone is ""aggressive and shouty"" based on literally nothing.  Incidentally, did this anti-dyed hair thing start with gamergate nerds or has it always been a thing?

He's the person that inspires those that are mocked on /r/lwg. He's trash.  From his wikipedia page:   In late 2012 Tyga was sued by two women who appeared in the ""Make It Nasty"" video for $10 million each; they claimed he had shown their nipples without their consent. They were assured that this would be edited out and the unedited version would not be released, but Tyga proceeded to release a fully unedited version.[52]  On September 21, 2013, another woman from the video sued Tyga for sexual battery, fraud, invasion of privacy, and infliction of emotional distress. She claims, like the two other women who have filed suit against him, that she was convinced to dance topless and assured her breasts would be edited out.[53]  On September 4, 2013, it was reported Tyga had been sued by Beverly Hills-based jeweler Jason for allegedly not paying for roughly $91,000 worth of jewelry. Jason claims that Tyga agreed to pay $28,275 for the jeweler's diamond pantheon watch in August 2012 and that he borrowed a $63,000 diamond Cuban link chain in December 2012 and never returned the item, so he sued Tyga for the cost of both pieces, plus late fees, which totaled up to $185,306.50 in damages, double the original total cost.[54]"

Roads are much cheaper and versatile.  These trucks will be able to go on normal roads which support trucks, with a driver required (initially anyway).  Trains are rather limited in how quick they can accelerate and decelerate, they have very little traction due to there being metal on metal, going too fast just melts the wheels and track. With long trains you also have a problem slowing down, if you slow down too quickly then you crush the middle section of the train because the back maintains enough momentum.  Trains have a massive turning circle, a trucks is virtually a point in comparison.  Trains can't easily climb hills, with normal tracks I think the highest ratio they can climb at is like 1 in 100. You can achieve higher rates like 1 in 17 but then you need special tracks and further limit which trains can climb.  If two trucks crash on the road it's not a big deal, I mean you could potentially be looking at zero downtime if the trucks are smart enough to simply drive around the crashed ones. Two trains crashing is a god damn nightmare to sort out."

The other claim that is often made, is that since Kenya was british at the time, then he would automatically become a commenwealth citizen, and thus would be ineligable on the basis of already having citizenship elsewhere - commonwealth citizenship kind of cannot be renounced, despite what Ted Cruz claims (and I believe this is Orly Tate's argument for Cruz being ineligable for president).   specifically, if the american parent is the mother, then she must have been resident in the US prior to the birth for 1 year+, how that is practically possible while being born outside of the US, for any case other than a vacation trip, is a mystery."

I think there is a sort of revolutionary fervor, mostly from marketing I'm assuming,  around increasing crop yield that is crowding out popular understanding of the issues. That's paired with a push to make this political, mostly in the corporate media. At the same time, there is a pretty big industry on these cult media sites, the kind Alex Jones uses to profit on, ready to make wild claims.

Those who understand and accept GMOs as safe just do, and go on with their lives, it's not something people are screaming from rooftops. The only time GMO-use advocates are speaking up is in rebuttal to fear mongering, bad science and nonsense.  Increasing crop yields, reducing the need of spraying, creating viable crops in places they were not before is not a push from ideology, it's proven. This isn't really a both sides have equal value debate.  The Alex Jones, Food Babe , C-E folks have little to no valid arguments. There may be arguments that COULD be made, but these people are not making them.  Do you think That the vaccine debate has value on both sides?"

conspiratard,3732st,VoilaVoilaWashington,0,Mon May 25 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"I think first we have to situate the politics of the situation. Comparing this to vaccines is a bit off. Vaccine paranoia is mainly a fear of doctors. It's an old-fashioned populist movement that is hanging on for dear life. Opposition to Monsanto is a fear of enormous agricultural interests running counterspin on disputed science through think tanks and corporate media. I believe a closer example would be to oil companies, who have also convinced people that people in the environmental movement are ""hippy dippies"" too. Opposing the medical establishment, oil companies, and the agricultural industry are all more or less anti-authoritarian. But even though I'm for vaccines, I agree in principle that we should be critical of industry-backed studies. I think we're doing a disservice to science when we buy into the framing of either the green-ink brigade like Alex Jones, or the corporate propaganda industry, like Cato Institute and Adam Smith Institute.  There are people who ""understand and accept GMOs as safe"" the same as there are different points of view on the severity and reality of global warming. But there are also those who dispute that, like the Environmental Sciences Europe, and Archives of Toxicology. These are the serious journals. If anything,  fearmongering about these hippy dippies is clouding the debate, at least on Reddit. It's more complex than just GM good, Alex Jones bad, however much that makes it easier to think about. We're only supporting profit-seeking hacks by accepting that framing."

He just very conveniently did not use the terms pesticides or GMO. The audience seemed unfazed. The didn't even realize what he was talking about.

The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.   I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue  to save countless lives.  I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated  with their administration are vastly outweighed  by their individual and societal benefits.   My concern has been the decision to omit relevant findings in a particular study for a particular sub­ group for a particular  vaccine.

The whole thing is just ugly at this point with money makers hardening everyone's positions on either side for profit.  The think that really interests me is that crazy ""Gamers are dead"" media blitz. It's the kind of media manipulation you see all the time, but it was done so amateurishly that it was crazy obvious that something was wrong to anyone who wasn't involved in the argument."
conspiratard,370i2c,Gizortnik,5,Sun May 24 15:35:03 2015 UTC,"The ""gamers are dead media blitz"" worked like this.   One week about 7 month ago, a bunch of gamers targeted an indie developer with death and rape threats because her ex boyfriend said she was bad. That same week, someone threatened to blow up an airplane because a Playstation executive was on it.   So a bunch of the gaming press wrote editorials that said ""what the fuck is wrong with you people?""  Also: People wrote editorials that other writers responded to.  Which is clearly evidence of press collusion."
conspiratard,370i2c,SPOOFE,2,Sun May 24 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"Press collusion is absolutely common place in the media, especially the American media with people having tons of echo chambers. You don't release that many articles about the exact same thing with nearly the same headline, and covering the same topics getting published at the same time. That's why it's amateurish. NewsCorp's coverage over Benghazi is much less obvious and far more professional keeping a near constant background noise of bullshit running through the echo chamber until their own affiliates publish ""exposé"" which leads to the major outlets to demand ""investigations"".  This isn't the first time journalists have been threatened or harassed before, especially by people who were far more serious. When ISIS committed the Camp Speicher massacre, a journalist with any integrity doesn't publish a story saying, ""Islam is dead"" or ask ""What the fuck is wrong with Muslims today?"". The President gets around 2000 death threats every single week, and he never stands in the Rose Garden and yells at the cameras, ""What the fuck is wrong with you people!"".  What I read was a sudden re-definition of ""gamer"" by several different media outlets all at the same time. Somehow, ""gamer"" went from ""person who plays video games"" to ""person who is X, Y, Z. Person who has emotional problems and anger issues. Person who... etc, etc.""  Now what is supposed to happen when you conduct a media blitz is you take a word that exists and you re-define it so that you turn it into a trigger word that will cause people to go into a rage every time they hear it because they think it has all these negative connotations. Glenn Beck is a prime example in re-defining the word ""social justice"" to mean something damn near evil. People who have been trained to respond to these bullshit trigger words respond badly to them, and cause arguments and fulfill the news media's echo chamber bullshit cycle by 'keeping the discussion alive'. This way, they manufacture their own news, coverage, arguments, topics, and in some cases political movements. Again, the right-wing is a fantastic example when it comes to ""Obamacare"" and the protests that came up when the congressmen had town-hall meetings. I can't find the link, but there is a great one of a man with his son in a wheelchair screaming like a psychopath (spit flying out of his mouth included) about how they were gonna kill his son.  When I read those articles I saw them not condemning a few threats, but an entire swath of people by re-defining ""gamer"" into something that was akin to a slur. I read almost nothing about specific threats, but there were pages about why the whole concept of ""gamers"" was wrong and needed to end. That's not people venting frustration over an embattled friend. That's a political blitz, plain and simple.  Look how well it worked too! Look how many subs are devoted to this nonsense, look how many pundits, look at all the irrational anger! It's gloriously profitable because the argument never ends, no resolution ever comes about, and it never will.  Now there's some additional claims about emails and the like that supposedly verify this, but I don't know how accurate any of that is because I've never looked into it. But it's not just a coincidence that all of those articles got published on nearly the same day, about the same topic, addressing it in the same way, and focusing on a political agenda. That's just blatantly organized."

The movement literally does not care, because it doesn't involve ""radical feminists"" or ""SJW's"" or ""icky girls"" or whatever their damage is.  The core of the claim is that a girl cheated on her boyfriend to get her free game a passing mention alongside 49 others in a ""50 games you might like"" list. To Gamergate, that is of much greater importance than a guy that lost his job at a large, established institution because a publisher wanted to bribe them for a glowing, full-fledged review.

I don't really know enough about the core leaders of GamerGate to substantiate that claim. I will, however, say that this happened long before they existed, was settled out of court, and by the time GamerGate happened Jeff Gerstmann et al. had already merged their competitor site ""Giant Bomb"" back with GameSpot. Although it was certainly a major issue for gaming journalism at the time, it has become fairly moot.  Being a person in my 30's and still playing video games when I can, I can honestly say that ""Games for me are a religion, and Haze is the shit!"".   To Gamergate, that is of much greater importance than a guy that lost his job at a large, established institution because a publisher wanted to bribe them for a glowing, full-fledged review.   Don't forget that several people either lost their jobs, left their jobs, or quit there jobs in protest in relationship to this whole shit storm.

conspiratard,370i2c,JoshfromNazareth,22,Sat May 23 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"This ""it's two bad sides"" thing is nonsense.  Gamergate is the result of a reactionary backlash by privileged males against the intrusion of progressive/egalitarian/feminist ideas and values in cultural spaces that until recently have been largely dominated primarily by heterosexual males.  Basically the audience for video-games has broadened and matured along with the times, and that brings with it different expectations, standards and criticisms.  The short version is that underrepresented audiences want more diversity, and less exploitative, discriminatory or alienating content.  There's nothing unreasonable about this.  However much of the videogame playing audience (specifically where it overlaps GamerGate folks specifically) is again straight male videogame nerds.    This is where privilege comes in.  It's not a dirty word or inherently a pejorative.  It just means recognizing that in certain circumstances certain classes of people still enjoy clear advantages over others.  It also means that if you're part of one of those classes, it can be really difficult to identify with or understand the perspectives of others.  Years ago I used to have a narrower less informed perspective, and may myself have jumped on the GamerGate bandwagon if it had come along at that time, so I'm not talking entirely out of my ass here.  Many of us here are nerds and gamers, and we all know how nerds are.  We want more of what we like and less of everything else.    So what you have are people who want a thing (slutty bigtittywomen in their videogames, as one example), and are being told that that thing is problematic and there should be less of it.  They lack the perspective to really appreciate the criticisms, so they just feel unfairly attacked and criticised.    It's like when you take a toddler's toy away because it's bed time.  The kid doesn't know how important his sleep and the parent's sanity are, he just knows his toy is being taken away for what appears to be no reason.  GamerGate is the resulting temper tantrum.  It's a generation of male gamers being asked to heavily reassess the things they enjoy, why they enjoy them, and possibly to an extent do without some of them.    If you know anything about nerds, and people in general, you know a lot of people don't want to do this kind of reassessment or critical reevaluation.    Now comes the ""GamerGate is about gaming journalism corruption hurrdeedurrdedurrff"".  That's nonsense.    GamerGate sprung out of an attempt by a buttmad ex boyfriend and misogynistic internet trolls (again I have experience with these types of people) just trying to fuck with one person.  How much of what they said they actually believed? I dunno, but there's never been any evidence to back up their assertions, and their assertions are so dumb and inconsequential they don't matter anyways.  Gaming journalism is a hobbiest/enthusiast media.  Hobbiest media is always ass-kissy, incestious and fluffy.  I mean you don't see people shitting themselves but ethics in movie journalism/entertainment gossip stuff, and we all know that a lot of it is bought-off or bullshit.  This is because film journalism, like games journalism, doesn't really fucking matter to the real world.  How about corruption in actual journalism, involving human rights, governments, and things that matter?  No, we don't see that, because GamerGate isn't about journalism.    Even the great many people who profess it sincerely are doing so because they've been hooked on by the underlying subtext of GamerGate:  The aforementioned reactionary pro-status-quo backlash of nerds that don't want to deal with their hobby changing, maturing, and becoming more inclusive (because they think it means less of what they want).  This isn't a new thing either.  We see it all the time with comic books, especially any time they reboot a superhero as a black guy.  Same basic situation.  Also the anti-gamergate people aren't radicals, they're about as mainstream as feminism gets.  Go watch an Aneeta Sarkeesian video.  Do it with an open mind and save your arguments and rationalizations for the end, ignore the occasional pedantic video-game trivia failure, and actually consider the overall message of her videos:  It's hardly fucking radical. Hell her videos go way out of their way every episode to say ""You can enjoy these games and you're not a sexist monster, just try to be aware of subtext and how ideas, behaviors and social norms are (even unintentionally) propagated and re-enforced through media.""  I don't see how you can find that radical or disagree with it.  It's common sense, no-duh stuff.  EDIT: Posted below is a hilariously perfect example of what I'm talking about."

conspiratard,370i2c,butttbuttbutt,0,Sun May 24 17:17:54 2015 UTC,"Here's my problem with all of this.  First, I don't want my video games to be a vehicle for political messages. I don't want my video games advocating women's rights or redpiller memes, I don't want them to sway me for or against gun control, I don't want them to tell me about whether the stock markets should be unregulated or not, and whether there should be universal basic income or not. I don't want them to tell me what I should think about race, religion, abortions, sexuality, or whether I should support this political proposition or not. I don't want political bullshit, regardless of how just and important it is perceived by its proponents, to infect my video games. And I know that if a video game does something that I personally find offensive, then I probably won't play it. It wouldn't ever occur to me to pick up a cultural spear and set down on an internet war path to make sure no one likes the same things I disdain, by forcing the game publishers to only make the games that conform to my individual vision of how video games (newspapers, TV series, theater, radio, etc) should be shaped. In video games, one is supposed to be able to engage in meaningless fantasy violence, break every law and cultural taboo, and do exactly those things that a normal person wouldn't do in front of others in a public place. Because it's video games.   Second, to me the very idea of existence of gaming journalism seems ridiculous. I can't fathom its purpose or what kind of people would invest their time reading such publications or, what's more odd, being seriously influenced by it. That being said, I am again not crusading against it on a broadband white horse.   Third, every time I hear the specialized terminology of ""cultural marxism"" and discussion in terms of power dynamics and privilege, I cringe. This is because more often than not, the discussion of that kind proposes solutions in want of problems.   Fourth, if feminists wanted to popularize their views through Gamergate, they're doing an awfully bad job of it. Here's a simple fact that I haven't heard of until right now, and that is because I took a minute to google it: there is now overall equalization of gender in video game players. Whatever materials I tried to read about Gamergate haven't mentioned that trivial fact, from which any intelligent person can draw their own conclusions. The vomit inducing volumes of diatribe that I have encountered so far - though admittedly probably more of it came from redpiller conspiratards than from their feminist opponents - have utterly failed to bring this up. Instead I am reading some nonsense about whether the gamer identity's wavefunction has collapsed or not. I still can't figure out what ""pro-Gamergate"" or ""anti-Gamergate"" means and which beliefs it represents.   And fifth, racism and misogyny in multiplayer games needs to be addressed. However, it's a problem of education, multipled by the disinhibition effect, a problem that is not local to gaming per se and must be solved at the root as such. I can't fathom any technological innovation that could do so, which leaves us with censorship. Maybe player communities should be segregated by age, I don't know. Maybe multiplayer games should implement clustering the same way as Elite: Dangerous does. Maybe there should be some sort of global player honor system. One thing that there should not be is censorship; because if I want to play a game that would offend other people, I should be able to do so without any impediment."

If the audience has ""matured"" then the medium would have matured along with the audience to satiate the market demand. Instead we see a few loud voices, mostly those connected to media scream bloody murder over any ""wrong"" depiction of certain favored minority groups.  We see them promote games which will not sell, we see them promote ""indie"" cliques who produce games which are by any objective standard mediocrities, and very far from ""mature"", pretentious tat maybe, but ""mature""?   This ""maturity"" is ""skirt length measuring"" moral hysteria.. its not maturity in any form people would recognize. People like Sarkeesian come up with their ""mature"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRYv73OeoGI game ideas which are cliched and just unimaginative.  We see these ""mature"" people produce hypocritical games like revolution 60 where misshapen barbies as women are depicted on screen in what constitutes barely a game. It seems you've taken every main stream media talking point and just swallowed it whole. The anti gamergate people are so radical that they have been correctedly cited as example of the horse shoe theory in action, as political sides of a spectrum reach an extreme, they become the same, and so we call them the new authoritarian left, people who's ""feels"" trump evidence, so dishonesty is not only acceptable with this group, its a given.  ""Ethics"" are an inconvenience, because like any true believer of a fanatical religion, they believe the ends justifies the means, this is their ethos. ""mainstream feminism""? Really, you mean like ""mattress girl"" feminism? Because that is their core, the mary sue/jezebel reading sheep, who don't notice that almost every story on a controversy those outlets publish is a lie. Its no surprise this is the mary sues disclaimer http://i.imgur.com/RAQmkwv.png They render themselves immune from all responsibility for anything posted on their site, no fact checking, no concern at all.  Destroying the narrative 4 Years Ago, Gamergate Aus  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPR1GQKNNU This is what internet aristocrat said 4 years ago on the media, if you think its about some random woman no one cares about, you really have been misled. https://archive.is/20150427115023/http://arstechnica.com/business/2010/03/06/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love/ This has been in the works for years now, as ad block removed more sophisticated audiences from monetization, sites were left to the lowest common denominator, which turned out to be click bait feminism, which kind of says it all about that. The ""we have hoards of mature customers"" ready to exploit message is simply insulting at this point. Games Sarkeesian promotes receive single digit bumps in sales, because neither she or her audience play games, and no amount of ""maturity"" would make them play games. All this talk of toddlers and taking away toys, its just reveals how empty an argument people against gamergate have, all the studies keep coming down behind gamergate, on sexism, on violence, it supports gamergates narrative, and now with this documentary, even mcintoshes boss knows he's full of it on such issues. Sorry, but you are just arguing against reality by screaming ""sexism"" at this point, and people are getting tired of having their intelligence insulted this way. It comes down to this, if your ""mature"" games really had a market, the hipster devs wouldn't be languishing in obscurity, or resorting to corruption to get ahead, they would be serving a 100 billion dollar market and there would be no issue, instead, you see this frauds having to try to shame and manipulate their way into relevance, and people are tired of it, and are finally just putting a stop to it."

A brand new train doesn't necessarily mean it has all the newest electronics. A newly built engine of an older design could still have a lot of older systems. I'm not saying that's the case here, but it seems unlikely that a design would constantly be changed as newer tech came out.

Just for the record, I wouldn't actually suggest what I originally typed. After re-reading, it sounds like I was actually promoting that solution. I, my friend's reasonable father, and several other people definitely told him he could have handled that in a more tactful manner.

Obama has not shown any leadership in Europe against Russian designs in Ukraine…   Perhaps he thinks a war with Russia might not be a good thing, besides it's in Europe not North America and he's not the leader of any European country that I know of.   I have written again and again about the Obama administration’s agenda to allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon to destroy Israel and bring the entire Levant into the caliphate.

You'll just believe what the Bush and Obama Administrations say.    I'm curious, Bush and Obama? Why? Why would Obama want to cover up what Bush did? Even moreso, every person Obama hired has to be complicit too, and why would they? Why would hundreds or thousands of people (some of whom, presumably, have some moral quandary with being complicit in mass murder) just tow the line and no one leaks anything to the press yet?  I mean, you'll agree that Obama was basically just like anyone else on 9/11, right? did he have any particular revulsion to the attacks? And why would he decide he's going to tow the line about what the Republicans did? And why did the Democrats all do the same?"

Not only that, but conspiracies are presented in such a single straight shot, free of nuance, researching this shit is a rush. Look at any other major issue, there's normally mitigating factors here and there. You gotta hop from one place to another to get info. A narrative has to be pieced together on your own. You can start hitting walls which are discouraging.  But a conspiracy is put together in such a straight, ""A leads to B, B leads to C, C leads to D, etc."" manner, you feel like you're on a roll. The conclusion is the starting point, and every following piece of evidence is perfectly curated to support it. So starting from the other end it all appears self-evident. Not having any resistance on the way to the conclusion makes it all feel like a powerful revelation.  I mean, I've gotten a few endorphin rushes just browsing blue links on Wikipedia.

Cities that now have full on bans on pitbulls (and any mix thereof) started by merely requiring registration of those animals.

Many people that end up overdosing on heroin first used cigarettes, alcohol, or marijuana (especially the first two, IIRC). Very few people used heroin first. But does using any of those ""invariably, inevitably lead to"" overdosing on heroin?  Slippery-slope arguments need to show evidence for why events would proceed as described, not just paint a picture of how things could change and then pretend that it's what will happen.  Will background checks for gun ownership really lead inevitably to abolishing the 2nd amendment and confiscating all privately held guns?"

conspiratard,36dwfz,rsh412,0,Tue May 19 00:06:52 2015 UTC,"At least part of the reason it had a limited effect is because it was a limited ban. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the bill was adopted and only applied to certain types of semiautomatic weapons. Some semiautomatic weapons were still perfectly legal, as were all non-semiautomatic weapons and all weapons of any type already in possession before the ban. Given that the ban only lasted ten years, it's hard to know what exactly its effect could have been given the amount of weapons it left on the streets.  It's also important to note that semiautomatic weapons are rarely used in every day gun crime and the intention of the bill was not necessarily to eradicate gun crime. The issue people had then and still have today with semiautomatic weapons is that, while their use in overall gun crimes is rare, their use in mass murders is very high. Wikipedia lists a 1989 shooting in which 34 children were shot with 5 being killed and a 1993 shooting in which 8 died and 6 were wounded as being major motivators for the ban, which primarily sought to address mass shootings, not overall gun crime."

If gun violence is specifically what you're after, then redoubling efforts to root out illegal firearms in the hands of criminals would do far more from a numbers standpoint. Mass shootings are high profile tragedies but only account for a small part of gun related deaths.

(feel free to correct me on anything fellas)"
conspiratard,36dwfz,rsh412,2,Tue May 19 04:43:07 2015 UTC,"How many examples are there of mass shootings with various types of firearms? Does Wikipedia have a list?   Not that I'm aware of, but the Washington Post published this piece last year. It shows that by far the most common weapon type used in these incidents is semiautomatic and also that the majority of the weapons were purchased legally. It makes sense that semiautomatic would be preferred since they're designed specifically to kill alot of people in a short time span.   My (admittedly unfounded) thought was that if someone really wanted to kill a lot of people, restricting what firearms they could own wouldn't make much of a difference; see the Boston bombings.   I would say that sure, there will always be dangerous people in the world and there are other ways to kill a bunch of people. However, I'd also point out that mass casualty attacks not involving guns are very rare. By my count in that Washington Post article, there have been 36 mass shootings since 1999 (it only goes up to 2013 so there's actually been a few more than that). How many bombings killed a bunch of people in that time span?  I'd also suggest that a bombing takes some planning so that you have to be fairly committed to do it. It's unlikely a disturbed individual wakes up one day and just builds a bomb to drop off in the subway. Guns are immediate and accessible and take no planning to use allowing for disturbed individuals to act on momentary impulses (I've seen studies that suggest this is also why suicide rates increase dramatically when guns are present in a home).   If anything the answer to mass shootings would be to improve the way we as a society understand and deal with mental health.   I agree that mental health is an issue in dire need of better answers, but raising it in a debate about guns is largely a straw man argument meant to distract from the actual issue. After all, better mental health care and gun control are not mutually exclusive concepts.   If gun violence is specifically what you're after, then redoubling efforts to root out illegal firearms in the hands of criminals would do far more from a numbers standpoint.   Again, I agree. However, I wonder what percentage of gun crime is actually committed with illegally obtained weapons. We've seen that mass shootings tend to be carried out with legal weapons. It's also important to remember that gun crimes are just a part of the damage that guns create. Many people die or are injured every year because a gun accidentally goes off or they commit suicide with it. In fact, 61% of gun deaths in America are suicides. Add in the accidental shootings and its clear that the majority of deaths by gun in the US are not caused by criminals with illegal guns (however, something like 65-70% of homicides in the US are committed with guns which to me suggests that it's not as simple as ""people will just kill each other some other way"").   Mass shootings are high profile tragedies but only account for a small part of gun related deaths. Most take place in areas of lower economic status, which the media doesn't pay a ton of attention to; and even if you try and clean up the guns there, they're still a symptom.   Agreed. Gun violence is an epidemic ravaging our nation, especially it's poorest parts. Gun control isn't the entire answer, but the attitude of a lot of people seems to be "" well if gun control won't cure the problem entirely then fuck it, why bother at all?"" Again though, the majority of people killed in the US by guns are not gang bangers on the south side of Chicago or in Compton. I don't mean that as though those deaths and ruined communities aren't important, but I want to emphasize the hidden toll gun violence takes that is rarely thought of, as well as combat the association of gun violence with gangs and criminals.   Finally, in response to your point about mass shootings being rare, I'd simply say that as a civilized society isn't it the least we can do to try to prevent these ""rare"" events? Why are we supposed to just accept 20 dead first-graders as the acceptable tradeoff for the right to own any damn gun we please? I'd also note that mass shootings are actually exceedingly common in America compared to other wealthy nations. They're only rare in comparison to our insanely high levels of overall gun violence."
conspiratard,36dwfz,ChinchillaJockey,0,Tue May 19 05:28:24 2015 UTC,"I'd like to touch on a few things.   It makes sense that semiautomatic would be preferred since they're designed specifically to kill alot of people in a short time span.   No. Semi automatic weapons are designed to fire once for each time the trigger is pulled. Semi automatic firearms are not machine guns. They've also been around since 1885.    However, I'd also point out that mass casualty attacks not involving guns are very rare. By my count in that Washington Post article, there have been 36 mass shootings since 1999    Know what else is very rare? 36 incidents within 16 years out of approximately 300-310 million gun owners. I'd call that statistically insignificant.    Guns are immediate and accessible and take no planning to use allowing for disturbed individuals to act on momentary impulses    Mass murderers plan their attacks for days, weeks, or months.    In fact, 61% of gun deaths in America are suicides.   That sounds like a suicide problem to me.   Gun violence is an epidemic ravaging our nation   Between 1993 and 2010, the gun homicide rate fell from 7.02 per 100,000 to 3.59 per 100,000,  a decline 49 percent. This is mostly related to the end of the crack epidemic.    Again though, the majority of people killed in the US by guns are not gang bangers on the south side of Chicago or in Compton.   In New Orleans, between 35-55% of homicides are classified as gang-related. In Chicago, an estimated 80% of homicides are gang-related, and in Baltimore, the police commissioner states that 80% of homicides are drug-related.    well if gun control won't cure the problem entirely then fuck it, why bother at all?""   Maybe doing something about poverty, income inequality, education, and creating some jobs might help?"

In Chicago, an estimated 80% of homicides are gang-related, and in Baltimore, the police commissioner states that 80% of homicides are drug-related.   You either didn't read my response closely or you're willfully ignoring what I said. The vast majority of people killed in the US by guns are not killed by criminal actions. Most of the people who die by gun in the US commit suicide. It's also not a ""suicide problem"" as you so glibly dismissed it earlier. Here's a link to an article published by the Harvard School of Public Health demonstrating that guns do actually increase the rate of suicide.   Research shows that whether attempters live or die depends in large part on the ready availability of highly lethal means, especially firearms.  ...  in states where guns were prevalent—as in Wyoming, where 63 percent of households reported owning guns—rates of suicide were higher. The inverse was also true: where gun ownership was less common, suicide rates were also lower.  ...  Says HSPH Professor of Health Policy David Hemenway, the ICRC’s director: “Studies show that most attempters act on impulse, in moments of panic or despair. Once the acute feelings ease, 90 percent do not go on to die by suicide.”   Suicide is generally a fleeting impulse and it's most deadly when it can be acted on quickly and lethally, e.g. when a gun is present.  Of course a lot of homicides are gang-related. That's not what I was referring to though. Homicides are not the majority of gun deaths.   Maybe doing something about poverty, income inequality, education, and creating some jobs might help?   Of course. But again, this is throwing up straw men to distract from the issue that's being talked about. I believe that everything you mentioned is a problem that needs to be addressed, but they need to be addressed in tandem with the issue of readily available firearms. Like I mentioned about mental health, none of these issues are mutually exclusive. They're all part of a holistic approach to better our society. It's not like I think we should say ""Fuck poor people and education"" or something. All of these policies work together to make America better. However, I would note that often in America, the staunchest supporters of gun rights tend to be opposed to things such as increased education spending, social welfare programs, universal health care, raising the minimum wage and raising taxes. Often it seems that gun rights supporters throw out these objections (which again, are meaningless because following these suggestions doesn't preclude advocating gun control) while also opposing doing anything to implement the suggestions. They tend to be a cheap rhetorical device for Second Amendment absolutists. If you doubt that, just follow the Republican presidential primaries."

conspiratard,36dwfz,rsh412,0,Tue May 19 03:51:27 2015 UTC,"That seems self-evident to me. The less guns available, the less crime can be committed with them. However, that's not to say that I'd advocate the government storming into people's homes and seizing guns from them either. My point was more to rebut the notion that if the federal assault weapons ban didn't reduce crime then gun control in general wouldn't either, which I feel is what you were largely implying. The ban wasn't expected to drastically lower all gun crime, but that's especially true given that you could drive a dump truck filled with AKs through the loopholes in the ban. Pointing out that it ""didn't work"" doesn't seem to me to add much to the conversation because it's hard to envision how much of an effect it could have had considering the way it was written.   To just get this out of the way, since I feel like you're pro-gun and are trying to trap me or something, I'll be upfront and just say that I'm very much anti-gun. I strongly dislike them and have zero qualms about that. I think America would be a better place if we had strict gun control laws. I was raised in a rural area in a family of hunters and policemen and military members. I've shot guns and am reasonably familiar with them. I grew up around them. As an adult, I've simply come to the conclusion that I think the world would be a better place without them."
conspiratard,36dwfz,ChinchillaJockey,3,Tue May 19 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"The reason that the federal assault weapons ban didn't work is because the type of weapons it banned aren't the types that are commonly used in crimes.

I also noted that it's not really correct to say the ban ""didn't work"", because it wasn't designed to eliminate all gun crime. The impetus for the ban was a couple of mass shootings and that's what the ban aimed to address.

conspiratard,36aqgk,ArmandTanzarianMusic,24,Sun May 17 22:37:58 2015 UTC,"Not an engineer, but I thought we knew already. The building caught fire thanks to flaming debris from the main towers, and the collapse of the towers impacted the building and weakened the structure. Fire further strained the structure until it finally collapsed.  If you're asking for some numbers, yeah that would be interesting but not sure what that would prove. Either way anyone who holds up Building 7 as some kind of smoking gun doesn't know what they're talking about."

No, they have a good idea of exactly how it collapsed. This isn't debated in non-conspiracy circles as far as I know.  The motive behind the investigation is to try to find something that is not there: They want to find evidence that the building had demolition charges and was brought down purposefully. Of course no such evidence exists except for some video from the collapse that NIST has already said does not fit a demolition.  It's similar to the same people who want to declassify the rest of the 9/11 commission report and somehow expect to find it saying ""LOL THE REST OF THE REPORT IS BULLSHIT THE BUILDING WAS AN INSIDE JOB"".  Even if there were an investigation, as soon as it doesn't return what they already ""know"", they will just demand a new one and say the last one was tainted or co-opted in some way. It's just like the the 8 or 9 Benghazi investigations that have been done in Congress: As soon as one is done and doesn't find Obama at fault, the republicans push for another one.

conspiratard,36aqgk,Ardhen,6,Mon May 18 06:06:51 2015 UTC,"I believe that was the motive behind most the 160 voting for an investigation.   Nope.. they are proponents of CD.... controlled demolition.   but I don't think they have a definitive answer as to how the damage caused the collapse?   Actually they do.. fire.. plain and simple fire.   Fire alone brought down the building, the report concludes, pointing to thermal expansion of key structural members as the culprit. The report also raises concerns that other large buildings might be more vulnerable to fire-induced structural failure than previously thought. http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/design/a3524/4278874/   Which also addresses the 'concern' those behind the petition cite..  'If fire brought it down more structures are vulnerable then we think. '  Well the report clearly says they fucking are! HEH  But face it.. 9/11 conditions are totally rare.. Building 7 was abandoned to the fire long before the collapse so this is all well within probability without invoking nano-thermite. :)"
conspiratard,36aqgk,waffenwolf,2,Mon May 18 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"Actually they do.. fire.. plain and simple fire.   Yes I mentioned that. That is obvious but what I mean is they don't have a more detailed and precise explanation that an architect would be interested in. It's good they look into things like this so they can make future buildings more safe.     I believe the 9/11 commission report stated the details of WTC7 collapse was inconclusive, Which the tards then had the stupidity to 'confirm' the conspiracy in that part of the commission report and ignore the other 99% of the report as government lies and cover-ups    regardless of what scientific methods conclude, At the end of day the conspiratards will always say 'it looked like a demolition der for it woz a demolition! i join da dots'"
conspiratard,36aqgk,ObLaDi-ObLaDuh,2,Mon May 18 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that's something worth recognizing. If the fire in Building 7 had happened independently, with the size of the fire as well as the structural weakening just pre-existing, it likely could/would have been saved. But seeing as how, you know, every emergency service in the immediate area was trying to save anyone trapped in the rubble, and WTC7 had been evacuated and saving it might cost lives and manpower which needed to be used elsewhere, it probably wasn't worth it."

The new WTC1 costs almost 4 billion dollars alone, not to mention the other three towers. He is working and suing his ass off to build the funds up to complete the new complex. He even tried to classify the two planes hitting as separate attacks, to get twice the money. This doesn't sound to me like someone who was in on a conspiracy.

Something similar is happening with another summer film: Amy Schumer, who’s a really outspoken feminist comedian, is coming out with the rom-com Trainwreck. LeBron James is in the movie, which I think might lure men who might not otherwise go. Is that subversive feminism the best way to address women’s issues in film? One day, we won’t have to sneak it.

The feminism is Mad Max is there, and I guess more specifically this time since they hired someone to come consult. The point is, the MRA guy is being slandered as a ""conspiracy theorist” for pointing out feminist themes in something thats obviously featuring strong women.   “Activist fears feminist plot but hasn’t seen the film” strongly implies that there is no feminist plot.

People are just saying that because they don’t like this guy views on feminism. But its not a “conspiracy theory” because we can actually read interviews from the people responsible for doing it.

conspiratard,366se4,BigScarySmokeMonster,-9,Sun May 17 14:42:13 2015 UTC,"You do realize women have specific prisons for them right?  Also: lifted from Wikipedia:  The role that gender plays as a risk factor for suicide has been studied extensively. While females tend to show higher rates of reported nonfatal suicidal behavior, males have a much higher rate of completed suicides.[2] However, a 2009 study tends to show little to no difference in suicidal ideation between men and women.[7] A 2008 study of suicide attempts by gender found that females have a higher rate of attempted suicide than males earlier in life, and that this rate decreases with age.[8] For males, the rate of attempted suicide remains fairly constant when controlled for age. Males and females also tend to differ in their methods of suicide and responses to suicidal feelings.  Same:  Another common explanation relies on the social constructions of hegemonic masculinity and femininity. According to literature on gender and suicide, male suicide rates are explained in terms of traditional gender roles. Male gender roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, and risk-taking behavior.[10] Reinforcement of this gender role often prevents males from seeking help for suicidal feelings and depression.[11]  Use of mental health resources may be a significant contributor to the gender difference in suicide rates in the US. Studies have shown that females are 13-21% more likely than males to receive a psychiatric affective diagnosis.[20] While 72-89% of females who committed suicide had contact with a mental health professional at some point in their life, only 41-58% of males who committed suicide had made use of this resource."
conspiratard,366se4,TerryOller,-5,Sun May 17 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"criminal judgments are almost always more harsh on men then women. there are far more male cases of homelessness and  suicide, but resources are disproportionately directed to women. Civil cases are disproportionately punitive towards men. Girls see far more academic success then men at all levels, and see higher wages within some very specific circumstances;  young and urban mostly.  Unfortunately MRA's tend to attract people who rant and rave about ""emasculating boys"" and shit like that, which is not an actual issue. Worse they often try to diminish the trials many people face in favor of their own, that's not productive.  EDIT: state facts that are a matter of public record=get shit on.

conspiratard,366se4,BigScarySmokeMonster,-48,Sun May 17 22:50:34 2015 UTC,"The other thing is that the writers of the film DID hire feminist consultants. Thats not a conspiracy theory. When you hire the writer of the Vagina Monologues to get female characters right, then its not a conspiracy to think that feminists are getting hands into the Mad Max franchise, its exactly what happened. If you don’t like it thats fine, but it doesn’t count as a retarded conspiracy theory at all.  edit: You people are impossible. MRA says its a feminist film, everyone flips out. Feminists say its a feminist film, no one bats an eye. If you don’t like it thats fine, but its not a conspiracy theory.   ""Eve Ensler - Vagina Monologues writer/Mad Max consultant   ""I read the script and was blown away. One out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in her lifetime—it’s a central issue of our time, and that violence against women relates to racial and economic injustice. This movie takes those issues head-on. I think George Miller is a feminist, and he made a feminist action film. It was really amazing of him to know that he needed a woman to come in who had experience with this. And the journey of the film: women who are willing to give up enslaved comfort for liberation and risk death to do it. It’s the rising feminine rebelling against the patriarchy.”   http://time.com/3850323/mad-max-fury-road-eve-ensler-feminist/"""

The MRA aren't using the term 'feminism' in the same way that the feminists are, they're talking about their insane 'women are trying to take over the world and castrate all men' idea. That's not feminism. What the feminists are talking about is feminism. They're not saying the same thing."
conspiratard,366se4,TerryOller,24,Sat May 16 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"Sure enough, what I suspected (but desperately wanted NOT to be true) was confirmed with two articles in the past week. One, Eve Ensler, author of “The Vagina Monologues” was consulted by the director to consult the female actresses in Fury Road about what it’s like being sex slaves. Her presumed expertise in this area was based on work she claimed to have done in the Congo. Work I investigated and deemed “fishy” in a recent podcast (around the 1hr 6 min mark).   Not a conspiracy theory, just straight facts that us sheeple don't like.   Alas, I was forced to accept reality.  Fury Road was not going to be a movie made for men. It was going to be a feminist piece of propaganda posing as a guy flick.    Not a conspiracy theory.   The real issue is not whether feminism has infiltrated and co-opted Hollywood, ruining nearly every potentially-good action flick with a forced female character or an unnecessary romance sub-plot to eek out that extra 3 million in female attendees.  It has.   Not a conspiracy theory.   And the real issue is not whether Hollywood has the audacity to remove the name sake of a movie franchise called MAD FREAKING MAX, and replace it with an impossible female character in an effort to kowtow to feminism.  It has.   Not a conspiracy theory.   It’s whether men in America and around the world are going to be duped by explosions, fire tornadoes, and desert raiders into seeing what is guaranteed to be nothing more than feminist propaganda, while at the same time being insulted AND tricked into viewing a piece of American culture ruined and rewritten right in front of their very eyes.   Not a conspiracy theory.   But let us be clear. This is the vehicle by which they are guaranteed to force a lecture on feminism down your throat. This is the Trojan Horse feminists and Hollywood leftists will use to (vainly) insist on the trope women are equal to men in all things, including physique, strength, and logic. And this is the subterfuge they will use to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity, further ruining women for men, and men for women.   Not a conspiracy theory."

But because it’s an action film, guys will see it.  Eve: One day, we won’t have to sneak it. One day we will be overt. One of the great things about this film is that when you have women on your side, you have a better chance of surviving. We don’t want to dominate. We just want our stories to be given equal consideration—to also get a spot on the playing field.  edit: Turns out that wasn’t a question from time, is was Eve herself declaring is sneaky feminism.

Something similar is happening with another summer film: Amy Schumer, who’s a really outspoken feminist comedian, is coming out with the rom-com Trainwreck.

How about a couple prominent MRAs?  https://www.facebook.com/102001393188684/photos/pb.102001393188684.-2207520000.1431710745./819905378064945/?type=1    http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/mad-max-fury-road-feminist-propaganda-only-to-bullies#comment-2023689129   ""After all, to bully on the playground is one thing, but to boycott a movie because it prominently features a female character is another.""  Perhaps the reason many men are annoyed by this is the latest instalment in a beloved ""guy"" movie franchise was rewritten to appeal to a feminist audience?  Or perhaps that the ""prominently featured female character"" is significantly unrealistic in the role, as your own anecdotes illustrate. Charlize Theron's character rescues young victims, kicks ass and takes names--she doesn't make the bad guys pay by telling a grown-up on them (which would be, frankly, much more believable, and oddly enough, much more in keeping with Third Wave feminism than a woman character who actually kicks ass).  Eve Ensler's experience with rape in the Congo was essentially to ignore all the men in that region who are raped, tortured, murdered and mutilated in favor of building a village complete with computers and internet donated by Google for women and girls only. Well, except for the men with guns risking their lives patrolling the fences to keep them all safe, that is. Know your role, gentlemen!  Feel free to hit the report button on my comment if you think I'm being mean, BTW. It would be the feminist thing to do.  Or it could maybe be all the barking orders she does at the much-beloved titular character, who, relegated to the role of a glorified handbag in the plot of a movie with his name on it, is forced by the script to completely abandon the enigmatic, bitter, hostile-but-principled, ass-kicking, loner-cum-leader, alpha/gamma male character cultivated over the life of the franchise, by NOT punching her lights out for treating him like her underling, or, more likely, going Galt on the whole enterprise and leaving her to deal with her own problems.  Which brings me to my main point. There is absolutely nothing stopping anyone from making a feminist action movie with a strong, kick-ass female lead. The ""Alien"" series demonstrated that strong female leads can appeal to both men and women. But there was absolutely no reason to go messing with Mad Max, a quintessentially masculine franchise that's appealed unapologetically and unashamedly to male audiences for decades, and turn it into feminist propaganda. Build your own stuff, feminists. Stop taking stuff men have made for other men, and getting your grubby handprints all over it as if the mere fact that it appeals mainly to men is some kind of crime against women.  Christ sake.   -Karen Straughn"

When they say ""distinctive death"" they really do mean that: something that is odd that you wouldn't normally think would cause death. The number do not reflect other causes of deaths which might be higher.  For example, if 5k people died of Heart Failure in State A, and in that very same state just 42 died of shark attacks, then that is a ""distinctive"" death.  Perhaps they should say ""unique"" or ""nontraditional"" deaths."

Possibly the most surprising statistic comes from Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon, where deaths caused by law enforcement officers — not including legal executions — were the most distinctive cause of death in those states, meaning “death by police officer” occurred in those states at a higher rate compared to the national average.   Surprising no..  Odd yes.. actually they touch on it in the link to the actual paper...   while the explanations for others are less immediately apparent (septicemia in New Jersey, deaths by legal intervention in 3 Western states).   As well as mentioning other limitations in the study.. while it shows a statistical anomaly. It could well be the way deaths are classified in each state... they touch on that also..

This all stems from the fact that Senomyx, a biotechnology firm that researches and creates artificial flavoring ingredients (which Pepsi and a host of other food companies use) has used the HEK293 Cell Line in their development process.  HEK293 is an altered, immortalized cell culture that was first gathered in 1973 in a dutch lab; they're embryonic kidney cells.

Because, you know, their huge $18 billion budget couldn't be acquired elsewhere for less effort.    They have explanations for everything, it's kinda impressive just how much thought went into them.   The outer edge of the Earth is bounded by an 'Ice Wall'. This wall prevents the oceans from spilling over the side of the Earth.  It is generally estimated to be 40,000 - 50,000 feet high to hold the atmolayer(??) in place. The moon has a diameter of 32 miles and is located approximately 3000 miles above the surface of the earth.  The lunar phases vary cyclically according to the changing geometry of the Moon and Sun, which are constantly wobbling up and down and exchange altitudes as they rotate around the North Pole. The equator is warmer because when sunlight shines from overhead, one square foot of sunlight falls on one square foot of ground. When it shines at a shallow angle, each square foot of sunlight spreads out over many feet of ground. Rather than a downward pull due to the presence of mass, the theory of Universal Acceleration asserts that the roughly disk-shaped Earth is accelerating 'upward' at a constant rate of 1g (9.8m/sec2). This produces the effect commonly referred to as gravity.  This is caused by the Universal Accelerator, which sits underneath the Earth and accelerates anything it touches.  However, According to the Special theory of Relativity, the Earth can accelerate forever without reaching or passing the speed of light.

Brelo should get jail he played cowboy he should get at the least a lesser charge.. he had to reclip at least 5 times to shoot that much, he was on the hood.. therefore no 'threat' to him remained as he abandoned cover and was in direct line of other officers fire as well as suspects had they been still alive."

Seriously does no one else realize how little this sort of circlejerking adds to the discussion?   Yes, humans have treated each other poorly, do treat each other poorly and will most likely continue to treat each other poorly for the forseeable future. You act like that's some unique characteristic of Christians and that by pointing it out you're making some radical statement and not just the trite platitude that it is."
conspiratard,35yejv,MeepleTugger,3,Fri May 15 07:51:11 2015 UTC,"Reza Aslan said something interesting on the Daily Show the other night (from memory): ""If you're going to blame religion for every death or horrific act that's been performed in the name of religion, you also have to give religion credit for every act of compassion done in it's name.""  And of course it goes both ways.  One of the ways religious and nonreligious people fail to communicate is by choosing the aspects that support their view, calling that the true nature of religion, and saying the other stuff ""doesn't count, that's just human behavior masquerading as religion"".  So while it's certainly ridiculous for a modern, American Christian to feel guilty about everything that's been done in God's name, don't discount history entirely.  If the devil / humans have a history of co-opting Christianity to encourage politics against God's Will, maybe that's what your preacher is doing when he opposes gay marriage or warns you Obama is a Muslim."

People are too quick to point out historical injustices to justify why they dislike vast swathes of the earth's population, and it's just ridiculous.  I'm sorry that the Spanish Inquisition did what it did, but I'm an American Protestant and I had nothing to do with religious persecution in Europe. Likewise the vast majority of Muslims have had no hand in terrorism, nor have the modern Turkish people committed genocide against the Bulgarians or the Germans against the Jews. Why should all of mankind feel guilty for what their fathers have done? I would think that in this age everyone has the right to be judged on their own merit."

Turkey's current lack of remorse gives one pause, though I suspect stressing over the genocide hurts the Armenian people more than anyone.  Germany appears properly remorseful, and continues to implement preventative policies and teaching practices.  I hope that modern Christians at least look at modern Christian political beliefs and go ""Hey, is it possible this is another witch-burning / inquisition situation?"""

conspiratard,35zva9,caboose309,2,Fri May 15 05:50:01 2015 UTC,Yeah it could go well or it could go very poorly. Being the cynic that I am I generally lean towards poorly but if they can improve reddit and remove harassment that's a great thing. My problem is that by who's definition of harassment are we going by. Some people think a standard hello to a random stranger on the street is harassment and who's to say these new anti harassment tools aren't just used to censure ideas or criticism. I don't like it when people are allowed to harass people without any repercussions and that should be stopped. But I don't want reddit admins to use this as a way to push marketing or force ideas on to others. I think healthy skepticism is definitely the best idea and only time will tell if this is a good idea or if it all goes to shit.

Being safe from threat enables people to express very personal views and experiences—and to help inform and change other people’s views:  ' ...  ' Because of this, we are changing our practices to prohibit attacks and harassment of individuals through reddit with the goal of preventing them. We define harassment as:   ' Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.   ' If you are being harassed, report the private message, post or comment and user by emailing contact@reddit.com or modmailing us; include external links if they are relevant.  ' This change will have no immediately noticeable impact on more than 99.99% of our users. It is specifically designed to prevent attacks against people, not ideas. It is our challenge to balance free expression of ideas with privacy and safety as we seek to maintain and improve the quality and range of discourse on reddit.  ' We are committed to evolving with our communities and the Internet to keep reddit a place where every day more voices are participating in free expression of all ideas. We also value your feedback as members of the community and welcome suggestions in the comments on how we can do this even better. '"

If they start a nuclear war, there will be nothing to control since everyone and everything will be dead and destroyed. The economy in which their 'hundreds of trillions' of hoarded dollars have any value will be deleted, and if they flee to their underground bunkers, they better get comfy because the subsequent nuclear winter will render Earth uninhabitable for centuries to millenia afterward. It's like the situation the Umbrella Corporation is in. They've killed everyone on earth and destroyed the planet! There's no one left to control, nothing left to own, and no one to sell their virus to! Why are they still doing this research, and where's their money coming from?  But that's the thing. The New World Order is a fictional, nebulous entity that can take on any membership, motive, and method one wants them to.  Some say we're already under the nwo with the endless wars and war profiteering, government corruption, and media distractions. Some say the NWO is still consolidating power quietly and behind the scenes. And more say the NWO takeover will be an overt World in Conflict/Red Alert 2 style takeover with a UN invasion of the USA through Boston Harbor, or a spontaneous reformation of the USA into the Galactic Empire, and like the clone troopers, the whole military instantly turns on everyone. Then Pennsylvania Avenue opens up to a ramp leading underground, and from the darkness, in perfect synchronization, legions of DARPA terminators goose-step to the surface with hoses connected to tanks of fluoride and vaccine dart guns, and the sky is chem-trailed so hard it's essentially Operation Dark Storm.  And what's their motive? Pick you flavor! Money, power, control for control's sake, or just to be nonsensically, cartoonishly evil with the depopulation thing, and that somehow wiping out humanity will give them more control and more money for their corporations.  Just try to put all the conspiracies together and they're mutually exclusive. According to Alex Jones, the nwo wants to both rule the world, and destroy it. Have everyone as slaves, and just kill them off. Become immortal gods of humanity, and bring about total human extinction, flee to their secret Elysium star base, fuck horses, eat babies, and commit suicide. That's the best conspiracy yet, that the nwo is a bunch of Satanic, horse-yiffing cannibal furries who are gonna blow up the earth. It's perfect, because it can be anything you want it to be."

conspiratard,35vxh8,satelit1984,16,Thu May 14 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"Is the culture of autonomy so prevalent in individual states that Texas citizens actually believe there's any benefit to be gained by the federal government ""invading"" Texas, as opposed to simply exercising the federal control currently in effect?   Texans are known to be abnormally proud of their state compared to the rest of the country. A person from Texas would easily say that they are Texan first and American second.  This conspiracy just taps into that pride along with a general fear of Obama that the right-wing has right now. Some of it is because the right-wing flips its collective shit every time a Democrat is elected president (many of the things said about Clinton were also incredibly stupid and similar in many regards), and I would say it's also because Obama is black and has an unfortunate name, so it's very easy to paint him as an ""outsider"" with ""revolutionary views"" and ""extremist friends/advisors"", hence why many think he wasn't born in the US and is a Marxist-Leninist Muslim.  Some of the things I've heard said about him are just so absurd that I would expect to normally hear such things coming out of a mentally ill homeless person's mouth rather than an otherwise normal person.  So to answer your question: Yes, some people really believe that somehow 1,200 soldiers are going to subdue the whole heavily armed state of almost 30M, even though it is already part of the US, and institute some kind of martial law (for some unstated reason that I still haven't figured out) and likely start a civil war, all because Obama supposedly doesn't like Texas.  Much of the far right wing is driven by fear and this is the natural result of that."
conspiratard,35vxh8,BoilerButtSlut,4,Thu May 14 17:26:37 2015 UTC,"Likewise,  I suspect any poll that had a negative  option relating to the president would see a notable minority of agreement,  simply from the nature of the American Right's hatred of Obama.

They view the federal government with suspicion if not as outright hostile, especially when Democrats control either the Congress or Presidency.  Texas is this mentality kicked up a notch for a few reasons. For one thing, Texas is gigantic. If it were an independent nation, it would be one of the top 50 countries in size and population and top 15 or so in GDP. 4 of the 11 largest American cities are in Texas. They rightly feel like they live in an important state. Texas also has an actual history of being an independent republic, albeit briefly, after it seceded from Mexico but before it was annexed by the US. Texas has a very distinct culture and history that its citizens tend to be proud of, so yes...many of them really do feel threatened by the government that already controls the state."

People were murdered, churches were burned, the bands affiliated themselves with white nationalism and other crazy shit.

You make it sound like no Bushmaster was used and relied solely on the two handguns. You don't even mention it. He used the Glock to kill himself, as stated above, but the killings were all done with the Bushmaster. I don't believe he used the Saur for anything. This is all according to the State's Attorney final report, available here:  http://www.ct.gov/csao/lib/csao/Sandy_Hook_Final_Report.pdf  Head over to page nine where it says: he  shot  his  way  into  the  building and killed twenty children and six adults and wounded two other adults, all with a Bushmaster Model XM15-E2S rifle. The shooter then took his own life with a single shot from a Glock 20, 10 mm handgun  There's a much shorter review of the weapons used here:  http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/11/analysis_of_weapons_in_sandy_h.html  From the above: According to the report, Lanza used exclusively used a Bushmaster Model XM15-E2S semiautomatic rifle during the massacre at the school"

So a scalar attack is obviously an attack that occurs in one dimension against you. So while you are a 3 dimensional being, the attack only needs 1 dimension to be successful. But there's another dimension, the 4th dimension, with which the Illuminati can attack you. In addition, they may be using 6 other dimensions to attack you in Calabi-Yau manifolds. Better buy some crystals that ward off those Calabi-Yau manifolds, and that pesky 4th dimension.  So in summary, you exist in 3 dimensions, but the Illuminati has managed to gain control of 7 other dimensions, each one vectoring evil attacks against you, so you better buy these crystals  else say goodbye to Kansas, Dorothy."

You have absolutely NO understanding of the history of the Middle East if you don't know why Jihadists exist today.  The entire reason that there is a Jihadist movement is due to the West interfering in the Middle East, meddling with their countries, disrupting their societies and cultures, and displacing millions of Arabs from their homes when the westerners moved in and created Israel, and The West's continued support of that sham of a state and their treatment of the native people that they displaced and continue to displace.

The history of the Russian space program is a source of national pride, and they know and proudly recall what was possible back then because they made many of the ""firsts"" in the space race themselves. They can't discount the mountains of evidence for the U.S. space program accomplishments without casting doubt on their own accomplishments at the same time.

Instead, the platform flatly opposes ""any and all cap and trade legislation"" to curtail greenhouse gases. It demands that Congress ""take quick action to prohibit the EPA from moving forward with new greenhouse gas regulations."" It criticizes the Obama administration's National Security Strategy for ""elevat[ing] 'climate change' to the level of a 'severe threat' equivalent to foreign aggression.""

Just look at the shit the Texas GOP stuck into its official platform. It would probably be easier to quote the parts that aren't batshit, but here's a few gems:   We strongly urge Congress to repeal the War  Powers Act and end our declared state of emergency.  Any Declaration of Martial law should be approved  by Congress.   ...   Inasmuch as the Civil Rights Movement argued against using race as a factor in  American life, affirmative action reintroduces race as a divisive force in Ameri can life. The Republican  Party of Texas believes in equal opportunity for all citizens without regard to race or gender. To that end,  we oppose affirmative action.     ...   We oppose the construction of transportation projects which surrender control or  ownership to foreign interest.  We oppose the use of eminent domain for construction of a “trans-Texas  corridor” or similar project which would create a federal corridor through Texas.   ...   We strongly oppose all efforts of the extreme environmental  groups that stymie legitimate business interests.  We strongly oppose those efforts that attempt to use the  environmental causes to purposefully disrupt and stop those interests within the oil and gas industry.  We  strongly support the immediate repeal of the Endangered Species Act.  We strongly oppose the listing of the  dune sage brush lizard either as a threatened or an endangered species. We believe the Environmental  Protection Agency should be abolished .   ...   We  urge  amendment  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  to  allow  a  religious  organization  to  address  issues  without  fear  of  losing  its  tax-exempt  status.  We  call  for  repeal  of  requirements  that  religious  organizations  send  the  government  any  personal  information  about  their  contributors.   ...   We urge that the Voter Rights Act of 1965 codified and updated in 1973 be repealed  and not reauthorized.   ...   We support the definition of marriage as a God-ordained, legal and  moral commitment only between a natural man and a natural woman, which is the foundational unit of a  healthy society, and we oppose the assault on marriage by judicial activists. We call on the President and  Congress to take immediate action to defend the sanctity of marriage.   ...   We affirm that the practice of homosexuality tears at the fabric of society and contributes to  the breakdown of the family unit. Homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that  have been ordained by God, recognized by our country’s founders, and shared by the majority of Texans.  Homosexuality mu st not be presented as an acceptable “alternative” lifestyle, in public policy, nor should  “family” be redefined to include homosexual “couples.” We believe there should be no granting of special legal  entitlements or creation of special status for homosexual behavior, regardless of state of origin.  Additionally,  we oppose any criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose homosexuality out of faith, conviction or  belief in traditional values.   ...   We encourage the enforcement of laws regarding all forms of pornography, because  pornography is detrimental to the fabric of society.   ...   We  oppose sale and use of the dangerous “Morning After Pill.”   ...    We recognize parental responsibility and au thority regarding sex education. We believe that  parents must be given an opportunity to review the material prior to giving their consent. We oppose any sex  education other than abstinence until marriage."

The American cell at Tarbela Ghazi was charged with co-ordinating communications between the ISI, the senior US officers at their command post in Afghanistan, and the two Black Hawk helicopters; the goal was to ensure that no stray Pakistani fighter plane on border patrol spotted the intruders and took action to stop them.    Pakistan has NO ability to fly planes or helicopters at night, let alone engage. Very few militaries do.'     ‘Despite all the talk,’ the retired official continued, there were ‘no garbage bags full of computers and storage devices. The guys just stuffed some books and papers they found in his room in their backpacks. The Seals weren’t there because they thought bin Laden was running a command centre for al-Qaida operations, as the White House would later tell the media. And they were not intelligence experts gathering information inside that house.   This is also bullshit; SEALs have become exceptionally proficient at FFFE (find the target, get a fix on them, finish them, exploit). This arose out of necessity during the war in Iraq, specifically in the effort to dismantle Al Qaeda in Iraq (ISIS' predecessor which was pretty much destroyed). This is exactly why Abu Musab al Zarqawi was killed in a drone strike.  The are specifically trained to even bring back ""pocket litter"", little bits of whatever someone is carrying as a means to figure out more about their whereabouts or who they have contact with (for example, a matchbook)."

These training exercises is basically a giant war game where the US military pretends to fight off a fictitious group which are located in a particular area. Alex Jones of Inforwars ""leaked"" this information and his followers think that Obama is planning on invading Texas and are going to use several Wallmarts as internment camps (some where closed due to renovations.) Conspiracy theorists saw a map used for this war game and now think that Texas is truly considered a hostile zone, overlooking the fact that Texas is one of the 50 states. The Texas Governor decided to use this event to bolster political support by tasking the Texas State Guard (not to be confused with Texas National Guard.) to monitor this military exercise. Unfortunately, these conspiracy theorists tend to overlook the fact that military exercises are very common in the US military and that this exercise is going to pump well over a million dollars into the local economy. Plus, the only politicians backing this are extreme right Republicans and they're using this opportunity to blame the President for this. Once this exercise ends, they'll state that their actions helped bring awareness to the exercise which prevented the military from conducting these war games.  TL;DR: Military is playing war games.

conspiratard,35jdy6,Sgt_carbonero,4,Mon May 11 04:13:26 2015 UTC,"The official story has a lot of holes in it, but so does this one. His only sources are an unnamed retired American official who wasn't directly involved and former consultants in the Pakistani intelligence community who haven't been in that business since the mid-90s.   And then there's this:   A Pakistani with close ties to the senior leadership of the ISI told me that ‘there was a deal with your top guys. We were very reluctant, but it had to be done – not because of personal enrichment, but because all of the American aid programmes would be cut off. Your guys said we will starve you out if you don’t do it, and the okay was given while Pasha was in Washington. The deal was not only to keep the taps open, but Pasha was told there would be more goodies for us.’ The Pakistani said that Pasha’s visit also resulted in a commitment from the US to give Pakistan ‘a freer hand’ in Afghanistan as it began its military draw-down there. ‘And so our top dogs justified the deal by saying this is for our country.’   but none of this actually happened after the raid. The Pakistani military's entire motivation for giving up Bin Laden as a bargaining chip didn't materialize. Why would the Pakistani military agree to this scheme if it a) humiliated them with their own people (and it did) and b) is needlessly complicated?  I'm not saying there isn't some weird shit with the administration's official story. I'm just saying take Hersh with a grain of salt. He might be the guy that uncovered My Lai and Abu Ghraib, but he's also the same guy who claimed that the military command in Afghanistan is being infiltrated by the Knights Templar."

conspiratard,35j920,IMAROBOTLOL,6,Mon May 11 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"It seems like Pamela Geller has an entry on the SPLC website, but not her group. Some ""highlights"":   Geller has promulgated some of the most bizarre conspiracy theories found on the extreme right, including claims that President Obama is the love child of Malcolm X, that Obama was once involved with a ""crack whore,"" that his birth certificate is a forgery, that his late mother posed nude for pornographic photos, and that he was a Muslim in his youth who never renounced Islam. She has described Obama as beholden to his ""Islamic overlords"" and said that he wants jihad to be victorious in America. In April 2011, Geller accused Obama of withholding evidence in the then-upcoming trial of accused Fort Hood mass murderer Major Nidal Malik Hasan.   ...   Geller also has denied the genocide of Bosnian Muslims by Serbian forces in Srebrenica – calling it the ""Srebrenica Genocide Myth,"" even though the Serbian government itself issued a state apology for the massacre. She wrote, ""Westerners are admitting to their role in something that didn't happen, and digging their own graves.""   ...   Geller invited the notorious British anti-Muslim group English Defence League (EDL) to her September 2010 anti-mosque rally in New York. The previous May, a report by the British newspaper The Guardian revealed the EDL as thugs who hold anti-Muslim protests intended to provoke violence. Because of its racism and history, the EDL's leader, Tommy Robinson, was denied entry at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and sent back to England.   ...   She has been the subject of positive postings on racist websites such as Stormfront, VDARE, American Renaissance and the neo-Confederate League of the South.   ...   Geller was one of several prominent anti-Muslim activists cited by the Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik in the manifesto he posted online hours before killing 77 of his countrymen, mostly teenagers, at a left-wing youth camp in August 2011. In the wake of the attack, Geller downplayed the influence of her views on Breivik, making much of the fact that his screed had only mentioned her by name once. This conveniently ignored the manifesto’s dozen citations of her blog and 64 mentions of her SIOA partner, Robert Spencer. At the same time, Geller couldn’t help displaying some sympathy for Breivik’s actions against the young multiculturalists. “Breivik,” she wrote, “was targeting the future leaders of the party responsible for flooding Norway with Muslims.”   Hate isn't a zero-sum game. In this case, both sides are repugnant assholes. Pamela Geller isn't a free speech martyr. She's virulently anti-Muslim and will say and do pretty much anything and align herself with pretty much anyone to further her hatred."

It's an issue of bigotry, cultural differences, segregation, and the desire to maintain cultural identity.

I think /u/MRB2012 was taking issue with the characterization of Islamic terrorism as an ""existential threat"" to the United States. No one argues that Islamic terrorism isn't a threat to the US, because it self-evidently is. Saying it's an existential threat, though, is a stretch at best and only serves to play into the narrative that groups like ISIS try to sell by making them seem more dangerous and powerful than they actually are (ISIS in particular has seen their reputation grow thanks to a perverse form of PR while in reality they've lost considerable ground in Iraq over the past few months). After all, the United States endured the worst terrorist attack in history. As awful as that day was, it didn't even cause our country and its system of government and rule of laws to stutter, much less crumble.  An existential threat is one which poses the risk of complete destruction, threatening the very existence of the country. Islamic terrorism is not an existential threat and one hasn't existed for the US since the fall of the Soviet Union. If anything, climate change seems like a much more likely existential threat than jihadis."

I'm givin it a read and pointing out the good bits so ya'll don't have to suffer   People’s opinions are simply sound-bites, from news, talk-shows, or quotes from magazines. 4. Trust replaces the instinct of self-preservation. It over-rides memory and logic. Controllers and shepherds encourage trust.   This feels like an introduction booklet grooming someone to be a secluded member of a cult. If anyone says anything that the media has 'agreed' with they're the enemy. If anyone trusts anything except 'the truth' they're an enemy.    The papacy is no representation of god. The Borgias were an elite class, and their pope had many orgies. He even gave out prizes to those who had the most orgasms. At one time, they had a fish farm that wasn’t doing too well, so they simply declared it a sin to not eat fish on Friday to increase sales   can't forget catholic hating    science has become the new priesthood. The deviants that are in control, their god is science.   I'm confused because this person writes about organized religion being basically a tool of the evil gubmints but I guess they're anti-science and anti-atheist too?    The Egyptian priests pulled a little trick here. They took up the image of a scarab beetle and pretended it was sacred, which others then took up as copies.    it may be a dung beetle but it has really fancy looking carapaces  on the word con:   They conned people to use money, to build cities. Hire people for armies and for that you need money or booty. You can’t get a bunch of guys to go conquer if you don’t have a reward. Otherwise, they get bored, fed up and go home. Con is the common word interspersed in English. It can be at the beginning or ending of the word. So is Sion   ""con"" hasn't been a word for 500 years. It was made in the early 1900's as part of a scam that a 'confidence man' would earn your confidence, take something like an expensive watch, and then bounce  the illuminati is pirate+viking society apparently   On the New World Order (the planned goal of Communism!):    A new financial system will come in where they give you credits at the start of the week. There will be no saving of the credits; it will start over every week. If you don’t obey, they will take them away. No one will be allowed to help you either. The plan is to introduce brain chipping by 2009 and they said they want to be completed by 2018-2019, and they always go for the children first. Just look at the cartoons. Every character has super powers, isn’t that neat?   I...what superhero has a brain chip?  On national healthcare:    In Canada’s health care system, you take a number and wait. You have no choice of your healthcare provider. But, if you want to be sterilized, you’ll get right in.

On HG Wells:    He wrote about the First World War before it occurred, and said it would be with Germany. Coined the phrase “the war to end all wars” so everyone thought it would bring about this utopia. All of his books were written as predictive programming.   ...germany is martians with heat rays?  On War of the Worlds radio broadcast:    The main reason to promote aliens from another world is to back up Darwin’s theory of evolution. If there were aliens and we come from the stars, then this lowers man from a unique spiritual being to just another animal. It is a method of debasement to convince everyone we are nothing but animals and have no more rights than a tree, or any other creature.   I'm utterly confused what this person's beliefs are. No aliens, no Christians but anti science? wot   On the Mayan people:    – a spoken anagram of I Am. The masons say, “I Am”. They are the I Ams.  The ancient Maya, a lost civilization over 1000 years before Columbus, had observatories in over 100 cities connected by paved roads. Rulers were elected by the common agreement of the people   magical telapathic connection with the masons?   Research – re-search. It’s already been searched. You’re redoing it.

The high priests are always chasing little boys’ behinds and these deviants have been at this for centuries.

Why was Lot living in the city of Sodom, which is where we get the word sodomy  UN – French for one   also short for united nations, and united means one too mind blown   God the Father – The god of this world is Lucifer, not the god you think. The god of the bible is a psychopath. Loves you one minute, punches you in the head the next. One people are special and the rest aren’t   ....so the author isn't a christian? Whaaaaaat?   It’s an occult date. It’s within the ides of September that Minerva is born, an occult tradition that a warrior type is born from the head of Zeus without the aid of any other partner, self created. It’s also Revelation 9:11, “the beast is released from the bottomless pit”. On 9-11-90, Bush mentioned the New World Order in his speech. Exactly 1 year later, he said it again. It’s the old occult Masonic way.   there it is. Oh those silly masons, always speaking in code for the shiggles    They’re fencing in the Great Lakes to keep people inside from escaping, not the other way around. (Did you know the border between Canada and the US is marked with stone obelisks every mile or so? The masons have marked their territory.)   whaaaaaat has this person seen the great lakes? also there's markers to remind people of the border, we don't need a fuckin wall with Canada    Obelisk – translates to: shaft of Baal. The ultimate phallic symbol. It’s everywhere. It means exactly what you think it means. An erect penis, a hard cock. In a way, it also represents giving the Creator the finger. The Washington Monument was created by masons; they worship the cock.   hahahaha   Big Ben is an obelisk. A Benben.   it's almost like it's an easy and recognizable monument that has pretty nice significance without being technologically difficult to build. Hmmmmm   high altitude aerial research project.

They were just performers doing their job for the great work. They start out with the clean-cut look and then travel to India to meet the guru and go on the magical mystery tour. Come back and reintroduce the new style and religion wearing their naru jackets.  Their reward was fame, girls, fortune and knighthood. You have to do a great work to be knighted by the queen bee.

The date widely accepted as the beginning of Middle English was 1066 and the conquering of Britain by William of Normandy, so even if you tack off Old English, Middle English (which, while a totally different subset of the language, is basically English with a few extra grammatical tenses/rules and letters and words that haven't shaken out into their modern day equivalent yet) is at least double what this guy's saying.  And it's totally reductive to say that back in 1500 the church's word was law. The Protestant Reformation started in early 1500, and it had been boiling for much longer than, say, 17 years.

And one thing i found was that an investment of 44 trillion dollars now would save 115 trillion dollars in fuel costs by 2050. A different source estimated savings of 340 trillion by 220 if we were to adapt now. I'll post sources once i get back from school.  ""Democracy isn't the best for climate action. Communist China's gov't is.""  Given the political quagmire that is US climate policy, and how efficient the Chinese can be when they want to do something, this is simple logic. That's not to say that the Chinese gov is better, only that they can act quicker.  edit: Here are the sources I was talking about.  340 trillion by 2200 Relevant information: ""Table 8.1 shows that adaptation reduces the mean net present value of impacts in the A2 scenario by $350 trillion, about 30%, from $1240 trillion to $890 trillion. About 72% of the impacts remain even after adaptation, that costs a very similar amount to the costs estimated by UNFCCC (2008). The mean cost of the adaptation measures is $6 trillion. Even though the adaptation does not remove all, or even most, of the impacts it is clearly very worthwhile, with a mean net benefit of well over $300 trillion, at a mean benefit:cost ratio of about 60. This is the main result of the modelling, but looking in more detail at the annual costs and benefits can help to explain how this result occurs."" (pg 103)  The 115 trillion source. Note that my initial statement was off. The 44 trillion investment needs to be done by 2050.  Also, as u/xthorgoldx pointed out, its incorrect for me to say that democracies are slow and Communist China is fast and efficient. It would be more accurate to say that democracies tend to do things slower, since there are more people involved, while authoritarian states tend to be able to act quicker, since only a few people or one person is in power."

I also find it hypocritical for western governments to lecture developing countries about this issue.   I completely understand how it comes off that way, but if the developing countries follow the same development model that the US did, we're all dead. It's also going to be much less expensive in the long run if the developing economies start building their infrastructure around renewables from the start rather than spending money to build fossil fuel infrastructure and then more money to switch off of it like the US and Europe are doing now.   the cynic in me doesn't expect much to get done   I think much more has been happening than you give credit for. It's still a serious situation, but now there is an economically viable roadmap to follow where there wasn't one before. Even countries like Saudi Arabia have started to plan around a shift off of fossil fuels."

You equate Democracy and Communism as forms of government. Ho boy. Democracy = Form of government. Communism =  Economic system. China's government: One-party autocracy enforcing a communist economy.    Furthermore, China's government is not more efficient than its democratic counterparts - first, news information out of China is state-controlled, so a lot of what they screw up doesn't get reported. Second, the Chinese style of engineering is ""throw money and people at it until it works."" Their bureaucracy is such a cluttered, mangled mess that there are quite literally building projects constructing homes, over and over, despite the fact that there's no one to live in them (like building suburban communities, over and over, forever). They get results because even though they waste 90% of their resources, they throw so much into their shit that the 10% comes out looking good.  And part of how they look good is that they don't give a fuck about environmental regulations. Why do you think shit's so cheap to produce in China?

Seriously listen to the propaganda coming out of Russia about Ukraine and Crimea. It matches almost word for word exactly what the conspiratards are saying. All of the conspiritards shows are assisted by occasional broadcasts coming from RT which is routinely used as a platform for Kremlin anti-American gov't propaganda. Listen to the shit that the Crimean and Eastern Ukrainians are saying about the events that are happening around them.  The most informative bit of information I heard was from a man who's family called him from Crimea telling him to flee Kiev because fascist gangs were roaming the streets executing anyone who looked or spoke Russian. Also, that there were American paratroopers on the ground doing the same.  The Russian propaganda coming out about the sanctions matches the American right-wing fears perfectly. They mention fighting the IMF and a global conspiracy of international banks. There's even been some allusions to the Illuminati.  Not only that, but some of the truly crazy US tards have talked about having Russia support them in a revolution to up-end the US government. Worse, right wing groups in western Europe, have also been cozying up to Russia as well. Even when right-wing groups in Ukraine are demanding their comrades assistance.  Hit that little save button under my comment. I firmly believe that the Russian government is attempting to set up a 5th column within the US, utilizing extreme right-wing groups. I believe that if the US and Russia get into extremely important and dangerous talks, and they require the US leadership to become distracted to force them into a more advantageous position diplomatically, they will utilize a right-wing militant group to cause a minor or mid-level terrorist attack to sufficiently distract the US administration in an attempt to gain leverage in said negotiations. I don't know how dire their need would be to use it, but I firmly believe that they are setting up the right-wing militants as an option.  This isn't the first time groups have been used like this, even NATO and the US have been accused of this in the past, with varying degrees of plausibility. If Russia were to actively pursue this, it would not even be too deviant from the norm. Hell, fueling revolutionary insurgent movements is an old-KGB strategy. It's recommended strategy for spreading communism. So, this kind of devious behavior isn't new to the world seen, and certainly isn't new to Russia.  Again, I don't think they're trying to make the US communist, or overthrow the government, but I do think they want an option to distract the attentions of a US administration or congress at a crucial time during a heated negotiation."
conspiratard,35bazo,Gizortnik,1 point,Sat May 9 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the value of having fat old guys shouting this stuff (perfectly in line with Kremlin propaganda) in English is that it lends an air of legitimacy to it- in other nations where Russia WOULD like to foment revolution. Ukraine, Poland, much of the former USSR that the Kremlin would like back. If people are talking the same tripe in the US it's less obviously propaganda."
conspiratard,35bazo,Gizortnik,1 point,Sun May 10 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"It's less obvious because the American population isn't used to the concept that we are sometimes being influenced by foreign agendas, even when it's obvious.  People argue about Israel influencing congress through lobbying efforts, but it seems like only white supremacists actually seem to mention it when Israel is not in the middle of an offensive in Palestine. RT has always been Russian propaganda, but the mainstream media just doesn't seem to hook on it as aggressively as they would denounce normal state run propaganda. During Vietnam, General Giap explicitly targeted American public opinion to dictate American strategy, and even though the anti-war protestors waved Viet Minh flags, they denied being influenced by foreign elements.  I think part of it is that it's disconcerting to think that the US government can't actually control some of these influences. I think the government itself wants to make it clear that no one outside the US can pressure the American public opinion, but it's just not true.  I do agree that if the US was a smaller border state, this would be specifically designed to foment a revolution, but such a thing doesn't really match Russia's interests in dealing with the US. At least, not as long as Russia isn't involved in a full-scale war with the US. Such a thing is not something I believe Putin is actually looking for anyway, it just doesn't help."

The telegram from Germany's Foreign Secretary to its Mexican Ambassador was intercepted and led to widespread public outrage in the US which played a key role in finally pushing the US into the war.  The Mexican government was aware of the request and conducted a study on the feasibility of recapturing the Southwest. They concluded it couldn't be done and shouldn't be done anyway. It was militarily unlikely to succeed, German promises of financial support were unlikely to come to fruition, Mexico would have had a hard time accommodating the large English-speaking population in the Southwest (the irony) and it would have strained relations with Argentina, Brazil and Chile which had interceded diplomatically to prevent war between the US and Mexico in 1914 after the US invaded Veracruz.

conspiratard,356qjm,MRB2012,6,Fri May 8 01:41:09 2015 UTC,"So in this extremely well-thought out and tactical scenario, Obama ignores the 1.2 million active-duty soldiers in the best trained and best equipped military to ever exist at his disposal, along with the 850 thousand reserve soldiers, or the 10s of thousands of military-esque federal agents, to recruit what, 7 or 8 thousand gang bangers with zero cohesion, experience or training? Solid plan.    Don't laugh, actual authoritarians have been known to use militias and gangs rather than professionals.  Not that Obama would ever do this, but the idea itself is not so out there."
conspiratard,356qjm,MRB2012,5,Fri May 8 01:39:59 2015 UTC,In a lot of ways the militia men that make up a big part of the right fringe conspiracy theorist community much more closely resemble the kind of gangs that would be used by an authoritarian leader to seize power.  As usual it comes down to projection.

conspiratard,356qjm,frezik,20,Thu May 7 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"Well, he did use the term ""race war"" in a dead-serious manner in the same paragraph, so the reasoning isn't exactly hidden. Then he also made three Nazis references in the following sentence while referring to gang members that Obama could ""deputize"", as though he didn't already command the US Armed Forces. Black gang members are a ""natural army"" for him, don't you see?  TL;DR Black gang members will be Obama's nazi brownshirt shock troops."

Wow, this conversation is getting dark."
conspiratard,356qjm,jorio,8,Thu May 7 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"Nazis considering Jews a threat doesn't exactly make them less racist against Jews IMO. My initial impulse is that racism centers more on hatred than it does on considering another race to be entirely without positive values.  I guess the question is which is more ""racist"" - considering some race a grave threat, or considering some race to be utterly pathetic and without consequence. We might be stretching the usefulness of a single word to cover all these concepts."

conspiratard,356qjm,MRB2012,2,Fri May 8 01:42:00 2015 UTC,It can also happen where they are outnumbered by a different gang. In the prisons in my state there is a large amount of Mexican gang members. If the bloods and crips don't band together they will get run over. So they set it aside for their safety.     Same thing happened here (in the prisons) in the 1960's-1970's with rival motorcycle gangs. They had more numbers together vs a few here and a few there.  Helped give them a good footing against the other groups.

Obama is the first Democrat to serve as president where there was virtually universal access to the internet. I think maybe there is just more chance for rightist nutters to air their craziness. There was a lot of shit about Clinton too. Remember the frenzy on the right over Whitewater? Nothing there. My mother also tells me stories of when she was a little girl and people in Mississippi thought JFK was in league with the Pope and the commies to destory freedom, or some nonsense.   Anyway, I'm not saying you're wrong. I think it's plausible. I just want to see what happens with the next Democrat in office."

Funny how that all the cellular and wireless radiation before 2012 didn't have any effect, but suddenly one of those ""evil"" smartmeters caused poor health even though they work at almost identical frequencies and power. But I'm sure that it's completely unreasonable to suggest that it's psychosomatic. Also funny how only the wifi in her room causes her problems even though the radiation from other access points is going through there just the same.  If I were on the school board, I would've put a stop to this nonsense pretty quickly: I'd put her in a room and do a few trials where I'd turn the wifi on or off and then ask her to tell me which case it is. I'm pretty sure her accuracy would be close to random chance.

They transmit short bursts of data, and the truck drives through and picks it up. Some of them can be set up to receive, but most of them just transmit in burst mode, not relying on a truck or person to ""tell"" them they're ready.  Modern smart meters form mesh networks automatically with other meters, transmit data from meter to meter, eventually making it's way back to the home office via relay points that connect via other technologies (cellular, wi-fi, fiber). Right now most utilities do daily reads, but eventually you'll see real time as technology improves (this can provide realtime leak detection analysis, etc.) There's a fair amount of communication involved with this, but it doesn't take a lot of bytes to actually get things done and the associated radiation per day is miniscule. Honestly, just having electrical wiring in a network throughout your house is probably more damaging than what the typical smart meter does, and a smart phone is many orders of magnitude worse."

We were here first! We are born into this Organization our bloodlines go deeper then an application. This is more then a job it is an obligation.   Our bloodlines go deeper than a background check. Our commitment is older than a gun permit. Our organization is more sacred than a restraining order.

This video was presumably made to focus on the Leuchter report which Zundel tried to call as an expert to prove that the Holocaust did not happen. However the Holocaust did happen:  http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact.html  And Leuchter isn't an expert on chemical forensics or engineering, and there are fatal flaws in his report that made it inadmissible in the Canadian court: http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact/leuchter.html  (Though Leuchter's ""expert"" testimony was allowed). They still convicted Zundel but the Supreme court of Canada ruled that the law he was charged under was unconstitutional: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Zundel  I am guessing that conspiratards love to cite the Leuchter report as solid evidence that the Holocaust did not happen, but the facts say otherwise."

Objects and devices significantly smaller than a meter will not absorb much, and your iPhone is actually pretty heavily shielded anyway so you don't brick it with ESD or every time a nearby diesel truck turns on.  The box is not grounded (why it does not come packaged with a $90 short length of ordinary copper wire to at least ground the Faraday cage is beyond me), is much larger than an iPhone and capable of being more of an antenna. Being in the box will be more dangerous to small electronics than being outside the box.  What will happen in the event of an actual EMP is that the power goes out at least temporarily, everything connected to a large antenna or a power line without a good surge protector is probably toast, and your car's electronics probably need to reboot. It would make a developed country mad as a wet hen but would probably not cripple everything forever."

conspiratard,34wf7f,Akton,7,Tue May 5 16:40:31 2015 UTC,"When the barcode was first introduced, IIRC there were lots of crazy Christian kooks who thought they were the Mark of the Beast mentioned in Revelation 13, 16-18.   [the second beast] also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.  This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.   The same thing was used for fear-mongering about loads of stuff, like ID cards, RFID-enabled transportation passes, etc."
conspiratard,34wf7f,Blue_Monday,3,Tue May 5 16:56:07 2015 UTC,Didn't they recently find that the number of the beast was actually supposed to be 616?

conspiratard,34wf7f,Squirrel_In_A_Tuque,1 point,Tue May 5 17:57:38 2015 UTC,The number of the beast is a gematriya for Nero (letters represent numbers which are then summed). When Nero Caesar is added up you get 616 and when you spell Nero Neron (which was how the name was often spelled) you get the infamous 666. The differences in number seen in different manuscripts comes from difference in how the authors thought Nero's name was spelled.

conspiratard,34vcb0,Kpiozoa,23,Tue May 5 00:05:33 2015 UTC,Can somebody give me the whole story on this buttery pile of conspiracy?
conspiratard,34vcb0,melangechurro,55,Tue May 5 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"The military is doing this thing they've named Jade Helm, which is a large scale exercise aimed at training soldiers on operating in a modern populated setting, like urban environments and suburban cities and so on. Another goal is to gain a better tactical understanding of how to manage a modern military in such settings. Jade Helm is taking place over three months, I believe, from June to September, and takes place across seven states.   That's the basics of Jade Helm, I think. I hope someone will point out anything I missed.   Anyway, of course there's numerous conspiracy theories about this, one of the more prevalent ones seems to be that it's a covert operation to take guns from citizens in those states. Others think it's a prelude to martial law. Others say it will be martial law. Some say it's a psyop to get people used to the idea of soldiers in the streets, to prime them for martial law.   The conspiracy crowd was loud enough that they got the Texas governor to mobilize the national guard to watch the Texas proceedings to make sure there's nothing foul afoot.   Also, several Walmarts across Texas closed down, with little apparent warning. Of course this is obvious proof that jade helm will be used to take control of Texas. Or whatever. Also Chinese soldiers are aomehow involved. Probably to take our guns.   That's pretty much it.   More believable conspiratorial ideas are that Jade Helm is preparation for a possible war abroad, maybe in china or Russia, or even in our homeland.   Edit: it's the state guard, not national guard   Edit: the sequel: I also forgot that the whole thing is to cover an ISIS training camp in Texas. I have it on good authority Obama himself is going to be doing the training. Don't ask for sources because that's a liberal feminist Jew lizard shill tactic to discredit my Known Truths.   Edit part 3, revenge of the shills: Walmarts were closed for plumbing renovations. I didn't know that, thank you. Of course we all know plumbing renovations is shill talk for ""take our guns."""

He essentially agrees that 6 Million Jews were killed at the hands of Germans.  What he's arguing is that the order to do that didn't come from Hitler himself, but partially from Himmler and partially from random German soldiers who didn't want to deal with a bunch of Jewish refugees.  The only part of the definition of Genocide he's arguing about is the word ""Systematic.""  His arguments are silly nonetheless, and the 2 guys he's talking to point out why it's silly.

Honestly, while I tend to disagree with him, he's not insane or even all that sloppy in his logic. He's saying that Hitler was the head of state and therefore culpable, but to claim that it was Hitler's doing that the Jews were slaughtered is obscuring the real villains.  I'm inclined to agree with the man he's debating (except where he desperately and rather pitifully tries to re-construct the strawman he was expecting to have to debate) when he says that Hitler wasn't the sort of ruler that tended to make non-military calls in excruciating, written detail. He'd make himself clear enough to his men to get a result and move on.  So it's more likely that he gave the orders verbally or in an obscure and euphemistic way and it was Himmler and so on who got explicit on what to do in writing.  Still, I can't prove he's wrong, and that's the line I draw on calling someone a Holocaust denier: they have to be making a claim that is clearly historically false."
conspiratard,34r880,Plastastic,5,Mon May 4 05:08:01 2015 UTC,"Not really.

conspiratard,34r880,mudsill,7,Mon May 4 11:04:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think questioning if Hitler had knowledge and ultimate responsibility for the Holocaust is what functionalist means.   That's more a debate over whether or not the genocide was carefully planned out from the top from the beginning, or if it was a function of the extreme anti-semitism ginned up by the Nazi regime that happened organically. None of these people are claiming that Hitler didn't have knowledge of the extermination, as David Irving does."
conspiratard,34r880,SPOOFE,2,Mon May 4 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"First I've heard of this, but I can see how that would be a historical curiosity. If I'm reading you right, basically, the functionalist debate boils down to whether Hitler & Co. were planning to wipe out a pile of people like in the early '30s, maybe even before they came to power or shortly thereafter, or if it was something decided upon well into the war and they realized they just didn't have the infrastructure or resources handle the prisoner load for very long? Or something?"
conspiratard,34r880,mudsill,5,Mon May 4 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"Not my area of expertise,  but that sounds about right.  My issue here is trying to legitimize what Irving is saying by claiming that he's merely a ""functionalist"" or that there's legitimate debate over whether or not Hitler had knowledge of the genocide. There isn't,  and in no way is Irving viewed as a part of any legitimate debate. The thing that I linked to are the defense documents from this libel suit he lost.

(this isn't possible--there are surviving minutes from a conversation Hitler had with Himmler about mass killings)  back in the 90s, Penguin published a book about Holocaust denial that included a bit about Irving, and Irving sued them for libel. Thing was, this was  in Britain, where the burden of proof for libel is actually on the defendant. The defendants had a mountain of evidence from Irving's own writings, and Irving lost."

conspiratard,34r880,mudsill,1 point,Mon May 4 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"Sure, he's responsible either way, but the thing is--there's no question that Hitler was aware of it while it was going on. What functionalists and intentionalists debate over is how organized the plan was, when they decided to move towards extermination, and what the driving force behind the genocide was on the ground.   Intentionalists tend to believe that extermination was Hitler's intention from the moment he came to power or at least from the beginning of the war. Functionalists tend to believe that the move towards extermination evolved as the war dragged on, and was pushed forward by a more bottom-up approach from low-level Nazis that were trying to gain influence and favor with Hitler by exterminating Jews and Roma. However, functionalists also believe that Hitler was responsible for and aware of the extermination, helped to carry it out, and likely signed orders himself. Here's a chapter from Denying History by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman that touches on this debate and why it gets brought up so much in conversations about Holocaust denial. The part about the intentionalist-functionalist debate is on pg 224.  You're confusing what Irving says (which is effectively denial) for what functionalists say. Deniers claim that Hitler either wasn't aware of the mass murders, or that they were carried out against his wishes. And it's a common tactic for people like Irving to claim that their position is functionalist, because that stance actually is a respected historical position--denial isn't."

conspiratard,34r880,Pale_Chapter,27,Sun May 3 23:03:52 2015 UTC,"It's not that far from the truth--at one point, the top Nazis earnestly considered forcibly deporting Jews to Madagascar. Then, yeah, they realized it would be a lot cheaper to just go through the ghettoes with submachine guns. But that had its own problems--it turns out that even people raised to think of Jews as subhuman develop PTSD from participating in mass executions. They tried to make it more and more impersonal--carbon monoxide vans, mass graves--but ultimately these were stopgap measures. The Final Solution was an attempt--and not even a fully successful attempt--to engineer around man's essential humanity. Sort of perversely inspiring, isn't it?"
conspiratard,34r880,Ianallyfisthorses,10,Mon May 4 02:50:42 2015 UTC,"And then they tried to further protect German soldiers from mental distress by using Jewish prisoners to run the killing facilities as much as possible.

conspiratard,34r880,BoilerButtSlut,-5,Mon May 4 04:38:37 2015 UTC,"Then, yeah, they realized it would be a lot cheaper to just go through the ghettoes with submachine guns.   Well, not quite. Germany still planned on the deportation until they lost the battle of britain. With britain still standing in terms of naval power, there was no credible way for the german navy to accomplish this plan. It was only then that they shelved the idea.  Not to defend the Nazis, but they really would have preferred to just deport everyone rather than kill them like they did. Hitler had openly invited any other country to take them and he would even pay for the passenger fare.  Edit: Hey look, what I'm saying is against what the hivemind believes so I get downvoted. I'm not making this shit up. Here's a quote from Hitler:    I can only hope and expect that the other world, which has such deep sympathy for these criminals [Jews], will at least be generous enough to convert this sympathy into practical aid. We, on our part, are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries, for all I care, even on luxury ships.   The Nazis didn't prefer deporting Jews over killing because of some kind empathy or humanity, it was economics.

So if Hitler had no idea what was happening how could he have sent that message to Himmler asking for those on that particular train not to be slaughtered?

As I recall, his estimated death toll from the bombing of Dresden was up to tenfold what is now widely accepted, basing it all on a single account that relied on forged documents that came directly from the Third Reich's propaganda ministry. (In subsequent editions he brought these figures down, but were still several times what historians generally agree on.) It's all part of a grander design of his to portray the Third Reich in the best possible light and to draw false equivalencies between the actions of the Third Reich and those of the Allies, sacrificing every bit of integrity he was once believed to have had along the way."

Of course, the idea that enough German soldiers organically reached the same conclusion for ridding themselves of their Jewish captives to the extent of killing 6 million is totally absurd. They consistently refined their techniques to minimize the emotional and mental impact on the killers which tells me that, on an individual level, there were no where near enough fanatics to slaughter even a million people, let alone six million."

For such arguments to gain credibility means other leaders carrying out atrocities could use a similar defence by ensuring the paper trail doesn't reach back to them.

Frankly, I was expecting some conspiracy nut to get shut down on television, not for them to conclude ""Well, hitler probably knew about it.""

He was embroiled in a libel suit (and lost), arrested in at least one country, denied entry to Canada (I think?) all because of his various holocaust denial claims, and not just for saying the orders came from Himmler or whatever. He is the darling of neo-nazis and racists because he can speak intellectually and holds himself well and has no qualms about associating with such groups.  So, you can find serious academic debate on the topic of whether Hitler directly ordered the holocaust or not, but Irving in general is not involved in that debate because Irving is not a serious academic and not afforded respect in academic circles.

Intentionalism argues that the Nazi hierarchy intended to wipe out the Jews all along, while functionalism argues that the intention for genocide came later down the track as a product of the antisemitic policies already promoted by Nazi Germany.  Irving here denies any role in Hitler in the extermination of the Jews.  However Goebbels diaries do point to Hitler wishing for promoting the extermination of the Jews.  A functionalist interpretation of this evidence would be Hitler's rhetoric being taken literally/to it's fullest extent without any further needed contribution by Hitler.  Irving has long denied Hitler had any knowledge or desire of the Final Solution, which is contradictory to these diary extracts and the events surrounding the Wannsee Conference, specifically notes in Himmler's appointment book around this time.  Since Irving denies these points, he denies pillar two and hence is a Holocaust denier."

In this video he may just be focusing on intent and where the orders came from, but don't be fooled. It's entryism. He has to appear reasonable for the TV audience.   (Besides, plenty of legitimate holocaust historians have debated whether or not the orders came from Hitler directly, or from subordinates; it's not necessarily a controversial opinion.)"
conspiratard,34r880,dreamleaking,2,Mon May 4 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"What he's arguing is that the order to do that didn't come from Hitler himself, but partially from Himmler and partially from random German soldiers who didn't want to deal with a bunch of Jewish refugees. The only part of the definition of Genocide he's arguing about is the word ""Systematic.""   While it's true that it's rare to find a Holocaust denier that agrees with the figure of around 6 million Jews being killed, what he's saying is still widely seen as Holocaust denial.   Many mainstream historians generally consider denying the existence of gas chambers or that the orders to intentionally exterminate the Jews came directly from Hitler and Nazi top brass to be Holocaust denial.  Plus, David Irving has made a practice of relying on actual Nazi propaganda for his figures. He's not just a Holocaust denier, he's a shitty historian."

Another important caveat is that the ""supplements"" used must have some sort of scientific backing.  For example, something like milk thistle may be useful for liver disease/injury. Would I recommend that instead of actual medicine? Absolutely not. But, maybe it's worth researching this approach a bit more as a sort of adjuvant therapy for people.  To me, ""homeopathy"" is a separate category of people who use healing crystals and think fluoride is killing their kids. Unfortunately, the ""healing crystals"" camp seems to overlap pretty hugely with the ""maybe there are some natural things we could get inspiration from"" camp, complicating things.  I guess I just think it's definitely worth checking out some natural compounds. Are they going to be better than medicine? No, almost certainly not. Could we use them as adjuvant therapy? Maybe. Could we use the structure of their medically active compounds as a spring board for synthetic research? Most definitely.

The Nation of Islam literally believe that an evil black scientist created white people as an evil race to rule black people 6000 years ago.  East Asian and Native American (but not South Asian or Middle Eastern) people were also created by black people.  They also believe that monkeys are the descendants of white people.

Disappearing is effectively a terror tactic used by the government, make someone disappear for a few years or eternity and less people are likely to follow their path, it's much worse than imprisoning them, even if all you do is imprison them.  Simply arresting someone out the camera shot isn't disappearing someone and labeling it as such takes away from the seriousness of disappearing people.

It's impossible simply because even left extremists themselves aren't all like each other. In general I think ""right"" and ""left"" is too simplistic a way to accurately describe all political, social, and economic thought all at once. But I do think that in most single-axis ways of describing especially social thought, there are similarities between the extremes.   To illustrate ""left"" being too simple, you cite libertarians. What about extreme ""greenpeace"" types? They're ""left"" too, but they don't have much in common with libertarians."

conspiratard,349g0q,EggplantWizard5000,47,Thu Apr 30 09:21:48 2015 UTC,"I know the First Amendment. And the rights of it, along with every other right guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, are not absolute. You can't bring guns on flights for example, just as you can't own a nuclear missile. You can't shout 'fire' in a crowded theatre, nor point to a bottle of HCl and tell a thirsty person it's water.   The right to peaceably assemble does not preclude a curfew. It precludes the federal government and (according to the mainstream interpretation of the application of constitutional rights via the Fourteenth Amendment) state governments from never allowing a group to congregate.   Hope that clear this up."
conspiratard,349g0q,LukaCola,8,Wed Apr 29 19:56:45 2015 UTC,"It gets even more complicated when you start going into incorporation and how the bill of rights doesn't actually effectively protect your rights (except in cases of federal involvement)  I mean hell, wasn't the second amendment only incorporated in McDonald v.

conspiratard,349g0q,greenshrubbery,6,Wed Apr 29 20:03:05 2015 UTC,But it was such a peaceful assembly! Why do the cops have to be such meanies and enforce a curfew?
conspiratard,349g0q,dieDoktor,10,Wed Apr 29 20:07:47 2015 UTC,"You're right that nobody is going to be charged with a crime because of the curfew, the supreme court ruled on that a long time ago, but you're 110% wrong about why. It has nothing to do with the 1st amendment and everything to do with freedom of movement and false detainment.  Also, the fact that they can't charge them isn't going to stop them from arresting them. Those are 2 different actions. The state of emergency let's them detain and arrest without charges."
conspiratard,349g0q,EggplantWizard5000,17,Wed Apr 29 20:56:42 2015 UTC,"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.   peaceably   Also a curfew is not a law. So they have not violated the First Amendment."
conspiratard,349g0q,dieDoktor,25,Wed Apr 29 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"Also a curfew is not a law. So they have not violated the First Amendment.   Not exactly correct. There are laws that give leaders (usually governors, sometimes mayors) the ability to impose curfew at their discretion. Often this involves the invocation of a state of emergency, which incidentally has been done in Maryland by the governor.   But curfews themselves, and the laws that allow them, as long as they are not designed to inhibit meetings or used in a selective and discriminatory manner, are perfectly constitutional. I don't think you would find any constitutional scholar to argue otherwise."
conspiratard,349g0q,EggplantWizard5000,6,Wed Apr 29 14:41:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't really think about those laws when I wrote it.   Would it be fair to say that since this is Baltimore and not the U.S. Congress the U.S. Constitution doesn't really apply?"
conspiratard,349g0q,dieDoktor,11,Wed Apr 29 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"The U.S. Constitution probably^ does apply to the city governments, as cities get their power from the state.

Clarence Thomas disagrees, but no one else I can think of."

The population will be hit so badly by a full array of bubbles and ponzi schemes that the migration engine will start to work in reverse accelerating itself due to ripple effects thus leading to the demise of the States.

Sure, he sang about peace and love - as part of his capitalist scheme. That didn't stop him from chasing larger paychecks, driving huge cars, living in expensive apartments, and generally just being a consumer in disguise. Lennon knew that socialism was growing in popularity, and he abused that.  I don't blame him. I don't think being a capitalist inherently makes you a bad person. That he may have beat his wife and was supposedly a homophobic racist is another thing. But assuming that his goal was to make money, he passed with straight A's, and besides - he was a generous person who genuinely fought for some good causes (although not universal and unconditional peace and love).

The nuts take it off the deep end though, as usual, when they start talking about the resonant frequencies of 432 tuning promoting world peace and suchwhat.

conspiratard,3455xi,WangCaster,-4,Tue Apr 28 16:39:07 2015 UTC,"Check yo self 432 specifically may not have been standard but Syntonic temperament was pretty standard for western classical music until 1510. The different character of the keys come from the fact that the standard tuning today is Equal temperament whereas, 432 is Syntonic temperament. It changes the frequency relationship of intervals, thus changing the sound of scales.  Edit: If you don't believe me, grab a guitar, tune it to A=440hz, and play a d minor scale. Tune it to A=432hz and play the same scale. They will sound different."

Its the same reason why a C trumpet sounds different than a Bb trumpet. That doesn't mean a C trumpet is happier than a Bb trumpet, though   Edit: Furthermore, up tuning/down tuning isn't going to change the temperament of your guitar. Fretted guitars are built to an equal tempered scale. Fudging your tuning a bit isn't going to change that, you'd have to literally refret your guitar."

conspiratard,3455xi,WangCaster,4,Tue Apr 28 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"Oh jeeze. Tuning to a frequency standard is a totally different thing than using different temperaments, which is what you're talking about. An A=432 is totally different than a just temperament, or Pythagorean, or equal temperament. What you're talking about is how you fundamentally build a scale vs what base frequency we use to define the scale.  Now of course tuning to the natural ratios will derive a more even, pleasing scale but that is NOT the emotive content of a scale... That's simply the harmonics of the individual scale. A D minor isn't going to be any sadder if you derive your D based off of 440 or 432 r 435 or 415  Tuning to a natural overtone series or any other ratio is perfectly fine if you want to play in a few closely related scales, but you hit very nasty problems when you start to shift through many not-so-related keys like in 20th century music, Jazz, prog rock etc. Dude, even in the wiki article you linked it talks about the issues resulting from frequency discrepancies and how you need to start fudging certain enharmonic to make sense of the scale when you begin to expand beyond an octave or so.   Again. 432 might have been a standard in certain places at certain times, but for CENTURIES by your own admission it was not an accepted standard across Europe.  Check yourself."
conspiratard,3455xi,heyheyhey27,-2,Tue Apr 28 17:17:20 2015 UTC,"Did I say anything about 432 tuning being viable for contemporary musical styles? No. I said it has a historical precedent. Did I say anything about a frequency standard? No.   The Pythagorean tuning system is also called 432 because of the way the math works out. If you use scientific pitch, which most do when talking about music scientifically because concert C is then a round binary number that is easy to work with, Pythagorean tuning gives you A=432.  Syntonic temperament will change the emotive content of music. You can argue against that all you want but you are flat out wrong. In equal temperament, the frequency relationship of the notes in a key are the same no matter what key you are playing in thus making every key the same harmonically. In syntonic temperament, the frequency relationships between different keys is different. This changes the key character or ""emotion.""  I'm not making any claims around 432 tuning being better, conferring any magical powers on it, or trying to convince anyone to use it. I'm simply pointing out that it has historical precedent."
conspiratard,3455xi,WangCaster,2,Tue Apr 28 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're bringing up A=432 and keep flip flopping between it as a temperament and as a tuning frequency. Of course I'd bring it up. Its obvious you can't even get your terminology straight if you're telling us to tune a guitar to A=432 then in the same argument saying your not talking about frequency standards but syntonic temperaments, which obviously makes no sense.   You can tune a guitar down to 432, that's not going to change the temperament of the instrument. You can tell an orchestra to tune to 432 and they're not going to suddenly change all of their instruments to play in a different temperament. You don't get to use the same phrase and change its meaning when ever someone calls you out on your bullshit or to try and suit your own argument at your convenience   And no, it doesn't change it emotive standard of the scale. That's all subjective and so I'm not ""flat out wrong"", and I'm not going to ""check myself"" either. So does that mean multitonal/atonal/microtonal music is more or less emotive than music using a just temperament or syntonic temperament? Obviously not, and obviously your determination to make it so is ""flat out wrong"".  You said a lot of stuff that is wrong, and now that someone called you our you keep changing your own argument, can't even maintain consistency with what you're saying. Quit your bullshit dude."
conspiratard,3455xi,Surely_Relevant,-3,Tue Apr 28 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"If you look up 432 tuning what do you find? You find Pythagorean tuning. When someone says 432 tuning, they mean the system, not the pitch. You can keep hammering away at semantics if you want but I'm not going to respond to it.  If you tune a guitar to A=432 and tune harmonically, you'll end up with a syntonic tuned guitar. I'm not going to do the math for you. Measure the strings and work it out yourself if you want to.  Just temperament doesn't exist. Just intonation does.   Bringing up microtonal, atonal and multitonal music makes no sense in this context. I think you are conflating me saying that a key is emotive when tuned in syntonic temperament and not in equal temperament with saying that music written in equal temperament is un-emotional.   In equal temperament, a 4th has the same frequency interval no matter the key. In Syntonic, it does not. Keys are ascribed emotion in classical western music because of these differences in frequency intervals based on key. That's all it means to say that Pythagorean tuning is more emotive."

The 760-ton, 20-metre-long detector took data for the ICARUS experiment at the Italian Institute for Nuclear Physics (link is external)’ (INFN) Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy from 2010 to 2014, using a beam of neutrinos sent through the earth from CERN. The detector is now being refurbished at CERN, where it is the first beneficiary of a new test facility for neutrino detectors. When it arrives at Fermilab, the detector will become part of an on-site suite of three experiments dedicated to studying neutrinos, ghostly particles that are all around us but have given up few of their secrets. All three detectors will be filled with liquid argon that enables the use of state-of-the-art time projection technology, drawing charged particles created in neutrino interactions toward planes of fine wires that can capture a 3-D image of the tracks those particles leave. Each detector will contribute different yet complementary results to the hunt for a fourth type of neutrino. “The liquid-argon time projection chamber is a new and very promising technology that we originally developed in the ICARUS collaboration from an initial table-top experiment all the way to a large neutrino detector,” Rubbia said. “It is expected that it will become the leading technology for large liquid-argon detectors, with its ability to record ionizing tracks with millimetre precision.” Fermilab operates two powerful neutrino beams and is in the process of developing a third, making it the perfect place for the ICARUS detector to continue its scientific exploration. Scientists plan to transport the detector to the United States in 2017. A planned sequence of three liquid-argon detectors will provide new insights into the three known types of neutrinos and seek a yet unseen fourth type, following hints from other experiments over the past two decades.   The Cern Bit isn't very conspiratorial, and yes it's actually happening.  The other half is 4 out of the 7 flavors of wackadoo."

Originating in 1912, Pravda was the leading newspaper of the Soviet Union, and even after it was sold off by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, it still sold millions of copies per day during its peak. The news source now only sells 100,000 copies per day and is considered by American critics to be a “conspiracy theory website that buys into everything anti-U.S. with non-satirical conviction.”   The crazy begins in the next paragraph, when they say ""but even if you think Pravda is Cloud Kookooland, we totally believe this story anyway."""

The thing is, what do you think would happen if someone goes on a killing spree, and the PD declined to buy an armored car? Everyone at the top would loose their job and be shunted from the community. Just imagine the shitstorm that would happen if the media would hear (and they would) about the fact?! There'd be endless enquiries, ""why didn't they buy an MRAP for (basically) free"" ""could it have saved lifes if they bought one"" etc. etc. The thing is, by the time you need one, it's already too late, so there's no actual downside to buying one, only fearmongering with little to no grounding in reality."

Fat lot of fucking good an MRAP does when the shooter is inside a structure... unless you're planning on going the HEEEEEERE'S JOHNNY! route.  Also, while armored trucks are great at protecting you from Michael Bay's wet dream or random gunfire, they aren't very good in adverse traction conditions.  All that armor is VERY heavy and doesn't float well over mud and snow.  Lighter weight vehicles with lower ground pressure fare much better than an armored truck would.

It's exactly the same thing as this except it looks more scary.  And the grenade launchers are for tear gas, not actual frag grenades.

They only seem scary because of recent media blitz and their implication to war overseas.   US Military hastily built thousands of MRAPs of several different types to use in Iraq/Afghanistan war and now that the war is dying down, they are trying to get rid of all these MRAPs for logistic reasons (maintaining fleet of several different types of MRAPs was a nightmare for the military apparently). They're giving them away/selling for cheap price to police force and allied nations.  They're replacing MRAPs and armored humvees with one singular design via JLTV program."
conspiratard,3411uf,SPOOFE,4,Tue Apr 28 00:08:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's just that it is so obviously built for dealing with IEDs, which are not a thing here in the US.   As long as they are  not super expensive to maintain, they are replacing older equipment, and they are not using it for busting down the door of some casual pothead, I could see them being okay. But I'm concerned that they will be misappropriated by departments that don't need them and misused in situations where they aren't helpful."
conspiratard,3411uf,skepticalDragon,8,Mon Apr 27 14:45:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's just that it is so obviously built for dealing with IEDs   But as a side effect, they tend to have some benefits that a more conventional vehicle might not. For instance, one trick to dealing with IED's is to put angled armor on the underside... but this requires raising the vehicle. Raising the vehicle makes 'em super-handy in crappy terrain. Further, the engine tends to be even more powerful, a torque beast, to move around all that armor. This beefier engine could be a major boon in some areas with, say, inclement weather. Even the greater weight of the vehicle can help with fording during floods (of course, any major flood could still sweep one of these away).  Now, I certainly don't think we should just go and build some crazy heavily-armored vehicles just to skitter up a muddy road or drive across a flooded street. But the vehicles have already been built, and hundreds - or even thousands? - are just sitting around doing nothing. There's a lot of utility they could be doin'."

conspiratard,3411uf,orthag,22,Mon Apr 27 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I agree, but more likely it's the military shifting storage responsibility to the police.

Now that we're drawing down our military from Iraq and Afghanistan, we've got a hell of a lot more gear than we need - and we can't just destroy it or the warhawks might get mad that ""they think we don't need a military!""  Combine that with politicians getting the brass to sign off on contracts for even more equipment that's not needed, and you've got a very large surplus of everything from bullets to APCs, and nowhere to store it all.  So you ""gift"" it to the police, who will more than likely find a nice dark spot in the warehouse or the garage and let it rust for the next 20 years (maybe bringing it out for the 4th of July parade)."

ALL. OF. THIS.  My father works for the county sheriff's department (he's been there for twenty years), and we've often got into conversations about the militarization of the police. As he's told me, the central reason why they buy military-grade hardware, is due to budget constraints. For example, the Sheriff's Office decided they needed an armored carrier for stand-offs and related violent situations, a  carrier designed for the police would cost over a hundred-thousand dollars, and was way beyond what their budget could allow. Instead, they got a military MRAP for just a thousand.   Now, what do they do with that shiny MRAP? Absolutely nothing. All it does is sit in the storage depot and collects rust, because the damn thing drives like a brick, has terrible fuel economy, and isn't well-suited to an urban environment."

conspiratard,341e1q,jonomw,4,Mon Apr 27 20:16:27 2015 UTC,"I hope to not come off like a complete conspiratard, but... I think the theory of Hitler escaping is not as crazy as it seems and is much more plausible than the Holocaust not happening. I do not know that he escaped on a U-boat but I think there is a good chance he escaped because a lot of the evidence in support of his suicide is flimsy.  The only people to see Hitler's deceased body (before it was burned) were high-ranking Nazi officials who could understandably have a motive to protect Hitler. Other third-party witnesses only saw the bodies from afar after they were set on fire. In addition, the recovered skull of Hitler is apparently that of a woman significantly younger than Hitler. Finally, I find it odd that Hitler would not have an escape plan in a situation where the enemy is closing in. If an enemy started closing in on the US, I think the last place Obama would be is in DC. Similarly, I think Hitler would have evacuated at the first signs of the impending doom.  Of course, this is just all my naïve ramblings based on limited research but while I do not know it to be true, I certainly see Hitler’s escape as a plausible outcome.  EDIT: I probably should have provided sources, and if anyone honestly cares, I can provide them. But as the conspiratards say, it's all out there. You can just Google it and the truth is right there."
conspiratard,341e1q,BoilerButtSlut,5,Mon Apr 27 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"The only people to see Hitler's deceased body (before it was burned) were high-ranking Nazi officials who could understandably have a motive to protect Hitler.   Well, there's the fact that there are multiple eyewitnesses from the bunker who saw his dead body with the bullet hole. Contrary to what you said, many there were not ""high-ranking"" at all. Secretaries, pages, messengers, spouses, and more were coming in and out of the bunker in the last days. I mean, I guess it's possible to say that they were all theoretically in some massive cover-up, but I would need to see some spectacular evidence to accept it.   In addition, the recovered skull of Hitler is apparently that of a woman significantly younger than Hitler.   This is true, but it is hardly proof of him escaping. The Soviets have said that they destroyed the bulk of the remains in the 70s, which were confirmed from dental records. Though I hardly trust the Soviets, I think if Hitler really did escape, Stalin would have thrown a lot of resources at tracking him down, and there's no evidence that he did so.   Finally, I find it odd that Hitler would not have an escape plan in a situation where the enemy is closing in.   Well, he said that he would stay in Berlin and kill himself. What good would escape do? He was the most recognizable person in the world at the time. There was just no credible escape plan for him, and he knew exactly what would happen if he were caught. The ones that got away were much less recognizable to the public which is how many were able to sneak out."
conspiratard,341e1q,waffenwolf,8,Mon Apr 27 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"Its nonsense there is proof beyond all doubt,    He asked the doctor in the Bunker on the best method of suicide. People in the bunker testified they heard the gun shot and saw his body being taken though the complex and upstairs.  Hitler asked several men to promise him that they will destroy his body once dead so he didn't end up like Mussolini.  He wrote a last will and testament and his last political statement, The Soviet union kept his remains in a box under a garrison in East Germany, In the 1980s three red army soilders where ordered to go deep into a remote mountainous area with his remains and pour them into a river and to never reveal where that was. Suicide was common practise in the Third Reich, They where all issued cyianide pills.  People like Hitler don't play dead    what more proof do you need"
conspiratard,341e1q,jonomw,3,Mon Apr 27 20:00:16 2015 UTC,"I could argue against a few of those points, but I suppose you are right. In reality, it seems there are way more facts confirming suicide than the few weak signs that point to a possibility of escape.  But I still hold my opinion that it is much more plausible for Hitler to have escaped than the Holocaust (or the death of the Jews) to have never happened.  edit: grammar"

Soviet Union knew that the real enemy in the coming years would be their current ally, the United States.   Stalin wanted to keep the door open for an excuse to attack western allies after taking Berlin. That excuse would have been accusing western powers for allowing Hitler to escape to their side. The idea was to hide concrete proof of his death, and do what Soviet Union does. Stage fictitious reason for war.   No hurt keeping that door open, eh?

conspiratard,340de8,MagisterD,6,Mon Apr 27 12:30:10 2015 UTC,"M: As I said earlier the planes were a cover up. The plane triggered the explosives when it hit the tower(most likely).   This is the shit that blows my fucking mind.   The explosives were either in the base of the tower and it fell by the force of gravity. Or the explosives were laden in the ENTIRE tower, requiring perfect timing of explosives, insane amounts of resources, insane amounts of labor, and perfect flying. You can't hold both positions. Then again, cognitive dissonance.   Measure the height of both towers, find out how fucking planes hit, so you can find out how the hell flames will come down 75 floors in 20 minutes and ""makes the towers fall together from scratch"". There is so much wrong with what you say Alex, there is not even a complete argument   Literally, one of the first things that the first responders on scene did was get out of their trucks and step over people who were on fire coming out of the elevators.   M: Nobody comes into the buildings without having worked there   Utterly false. No one in either building allows visitors, tourists, family, or guests?  Okay, so you want sources. There's tons of sources out there, and on reddit. Sometimes the best sources are actually truther sites where they disprove themselves. 911-research did this with ""no planes"" and ""pentagon-missile"" and ""space weapon"" hypothesis.   I'm just going to go get WTC-7 out of the way now.

Includes testimony of people who were there (just in case there was some additional claims I haven't heard of).

I think he buys the idea of it being possible in some way. But does not think the fire could have spread so quickly through the complex in about 20 minutes(I have still not fact checked that)."
conspiratard,340de8,Gizortnik,8,Mon Apr 27 13:49:12 2015 UTC,"Those links were mostly for your own research, but if you want to just go over how a building like that collapses, then I would suggest the NOVA documentary. He may already hate it because 'tards think they disproved it, but it goes over each little bit of the collapse and how it happened.  As for the fire thing, I'm not sure what you're trying to nail down.   It took about 25 minutes after the planes were hijacked that north tower collapsed so did not take long.   So this is just wrong. The hijack of American 11 seems to have taken place at 8:14 AM, then the plane was crashed into the North Tower at 8:46 AM, about 32 minutes later. The North Tower then collapsed 102 minutes after the crash at 10:28. So that would have been 134 minutes. The hijack of United Airlines 175 took place between 8:42 and 8:46 AM, crashed into the South Tower at 9:03 AM (17-21 minutes later), and then the South Tower collapsed at 9:56 AM (53 minutes after the crash). That puts the time between hijacking and collapse at 70-74 minutes.  I'm actually curious as to how old your friend is. I remember watching the attacks and it seemed like it burned forever, I would never have said that from hijacking and and collapsed took 20 minutes.  Moreover, and I think this is covered in the NOVA video, the jet fuel was spilled at high velocity from the impact. Using gravity and the rushing wave of air from the impact, the fuel traveled outside the building (hence the fireball) and down the elevator shafts. That's why I mentioned the burned bodies. The flaming jet fuel went down the elevators (both regular and service) burning almost everyone inside each of the elevators who were unlucky enough to be in them at the time. Some people were singed, and some were burned terribly. On the South Tower (hit 2nd) people were gathered at the elevator lobbies trying to evacuate. IIRC it was Joseph Osorio who was one of the only firefighters to make it up that close to the impact zone. He reported numerous civilian dead over the radio a few minutes before the collapse. It is very possible (although impossible to confirm since there are no bodies to examine) that the majority of the people in the elevator lobby would have been burned alive by the same wall of burning jet fuel that burned everyone in the North Tower's elevator shafts. Considering how close they would have been to the impact there's also a possibility of overpressure (either causing people to be thrown around, or damage to internal organs), debris impact, and asphyxiation.   So, the burning jet fuel would not have taken 20 minutes to travel through the buildings, it would have done that within the first minute. Whatever was left (including fuel soaked into carpets, paper, ceiling tiles, ect.) would have continued to burn. Anything it would have come into contact with would have likely been ignited as the jet fuel would have likely been burning well above the ignition point of a lot of other things inside the building. Additionally anything that was burning helped fuel more fires. It's very possible that parts of the aluminum of the plane were also melting, and it too would turn to a liquid and seek the route given by gravity, possibly spreading the fire.  It's important to understand that the firefighters on the ground already knew something very, very horrible before they walked into the building. Everyone above the impact site was likely dead no matter what. It would have been nearly impossible to stop the fires, and they can tell you it themselves, and they have on several documentaries. Now, since the fire was uncontrollable, the WTC needed to rely on it's sprinkler system. Again, because of the impact of the plane, that too was destroyed, meaning that there was almost no controlling the fire from that point on.   So, given that the WTC buildings are damaged significantly in 2 very different ways (see the NOVA doc) by the impacts, the fires don't have to burn down the whole building, they just have to weaken the structural integrity of the buildings remain supports to cause a kind of cascading failure. Once enough damage is done to the structural integrity of the building, the floor below can't support the floor above, so the floor above falls with the weight of all the floors above it. The first floor doesn't support the weight of all the floors above it, all 180 floors support each other (otherwise it would be a pyramid, not a skyscraper). So once those floors lost their structural integrity, the whole building would come down.  I hope this provides some guidance."

I remember watching the attacks and it seemed like it burned forever, I would never have said that from hijacking and and collapsed took 20 minutes.   We are both 19 and live in Scandinavia. I myself had no exact idea of how long it took for the building to fall, as much as i find it implausible that they got explosives in almost every 2 floors and in the basement. The findings in the basement having been done in 1993! You would think they had better security after that.   As for NOVA video, if we had the patience to watch it he might still go ""But NOVA, FEMA, NIST etc are also behind the cover up. Lets hope for the best.   So from what i understand the jet fuel that was on fire could have traveled through most of the building, without needing to melt the steel. The Jet fuel ignited other things at most of the floors and eventually the construction gave in and it fell."
conspiratard,340de8,someguywhoexists,3,Mon Apr 27 15:09:00 2015 UTC,"If all of this can be provided from one link that ends up not being wikipedia, that owuld be sweet. Otherwise it just turns to a his word against mine.    From one link? Wikipedia is at least sourced with it's information. All your other ""compilations"" of timelines are going to be from federal investigations or less sourced than wikipedia. The timelines are going to be compilations, so that's a fair bit harder to do. However, I don't even think that the truther sites debate the time of the collapse, since you can watch the time for yourself on several live newsfeeds from the day that have been uploaded to Youtube. The time of the hijacking would have been derived from the ATC audio (which I provided a link for) and the ATC testimony which is either in the NIST report or in the FAA/FBI/911 Comission reports. The easiest to access the hijack time is the ATC audio I provided on the YouTube link. American 11 sends out a regular communication at 8:13 AM, then Betty Ong mentions calls American Airlines at 8:19 AM after. Narrowing it down would be whenever the Air Traffic controller would have noticed American 11 was deviating form it's flight path. What sounds like Muhammed Atta is at the flight controls stating ""We have some planes"" at 8:24. Also, in the ATC recording. So we can identify that at the very latest, the hijackers had control of the plane by admission at 8:24 AM.  United 175 is a different story because the hijackers did not mistakenly broadcast their communication to ATC. The definite confirmation that they had been hijacked came at 8:47 AM when they deviated from their flight plan and changed their transponder. You'ld have to pull that from official testimony in federal investigations again by the FAA, or the statements of the flight controllers themselves.  Like I said, as for the collision and collapse timeslines those are not in dispute because they can be independently verified by watching the video of the live feeds.   We are both 19 and live in Scandinavia.    That makes more sense, the 25 minute thing is a weird claim.   So from what i understand the jet fuel that was on fire could have traveled through most of the building, without needing to melt the steel. The Jet fuel ignited other things at most of the floors and eventually the construction gave in and it fell.    The jet fuel would have traveled through any floors that were exposed by the impact. It also traveled out of the building as a fireball, it also would have traveled down the elevator shafts. The steel itself doesn't have to be melted, just weakened to the point of not being able to support the added weight of jet plane debris, and the loss of support of the supporting structure that was destroyed by the impact. Once the structure was sufficiently weakened to allow for a collapse, it did."

conspiratard,340de8,nate121k,2,Mon Apr 27 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"I thought of somethings to ask Truthers. Ask them how many people they think were in on the planning, execution, and to this day, keeping the secret of the 9/11 attacks. Is it 10, 100, 1000, 10,000 people, etc. They should agree that it can't be too few otherwise they wouldn't be able to do the attacks, and it can't be too many because well it'd be prone to people talking about it like to the media and such.  Anyways, so there'd have to be people in on the conspiracy to this day. If there were charges in the towers, then there would have to have been people who planned it, put the charges in, pushed the buttons to detonate, they'd have to get WTC security to look the other way, somehow everyone in the WTC wouldn't have noticed, etc. It'd be a lot of people to do the demolition, maybe hundreds of people? Then add in the Truthers' other beliefs about that day. The Pentagon hit by a missile? People would have to direct the missile, ATC would have to have looked the other way (I'm sure radar can tell the difference between a missile and a plane), it'd have to be launched from somewhere and people working there would know, etc. There's even conspiracy theories about the planes, that they landed, the people taken off and executed (or something like that), if you follow Jesse Ventura he promoted the theory that every phone call on planes was faked and their voices generated by computer or something or other, and the faked planes were empty and flown remotely into the towers, blahblahblah.  So there'd be a lot of people involved, in other words. So there'd have to be a whole bunch of people that at some point, the conspirators sat down and said ""can you commit mass murder for us?"" And bam, there's the problem, what happens when you ask people to commit mass murder? Do they all just say ""Ah Ok I'll do it.""? or do some have a moral quandary about it? In the Truthers' world, did everyone in on the conspiracy have no moral quandary about committing mass murder? Even if at the time they all did it with no quandary, how many would to this day continue to hide the truth and have no change of heart about committing mass murder?  The answer I've seen from conspiratards is that the conspirators were able to keep virtually everyone in the dark about it (it is very frequently compared to the Manhattan Project, which I laugh about because 1) we had a damn world war going on 2) we didn't use the nukes against our own people, I'm sure people would have something to say if the plan was to level our own cities with nukes). It would be pretty hard to keep a secret about blowing up buildings from people who are rigging up charges and detonators, and moreso, it'd be hard to keep the fact that the buildings were fully occupied a secret from those people. Same for security in WTC, same for the Pentagon and its supposed missile, etc.  Sorry for the wall of text, ha. But I have wondered about this, did everything in their world go off without a hitch, and no one to this day, who has first-hand knowledge of the conspiracy, has decided to talk by now? It's been a long time now, almost 14 years. The Dreyfus affair, the original modern conspiracy, concluded in 12 years (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair), Watergate in 2 years (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal), those are some of the biggest proven conspiracies, and I can't even imagine how hard it would be to do a 9/11 conspiracy in light of the fact that it's harder to keep secrets today and in 2001."

In the defense of conspiracy theorists, the increased amount of information has not helped people make wiser choices. It only creates more confusion to every subject there is. And the people who want to know something about a particular subject must to some extent trust those who do. People in general don't have the time to get really deep into stuff. In fact most 9/11 truthers are probably people who just saw footage of 9/11 towers falling, though to themselves that a tower cant fall that way on its own and that is their opinion forever. And probably the other way around. Most have been told through school and life to ""be skeptical"" without actually understanding what that means. It does not mean ""doubt everything those in power say"" or ""im doubtful about that"". It means believe things when there is evidence for it. Thats the difference between someone finding an inconsistency and therefor demanding it is bullshit and actually taking the time to check the facts through various sources or gain an understanding of it.   I think me and other people here are not of this ilk at all. We would probably believe in a conspiracy theory once evidence was brought forward, just that we are constantly given a variation of bullshit that turns out to not hold water or depend on people being sheep and shills etc.   To be frank the government could have done a not so subtle fuck you to the people and get away with it, simply by the fact that not enough people would care to check it out."

Excuse me.. when was the last time I raised up armies of followers and accused your country's government of a horrific crime against its own citizens?  Why does ANYONE outside of the US, Iraq, (BTW we needed no 9/11 for that.. WMD was our excuse..) or Afghanistan have any dog in the race?? Why do they have any opinion especially foaming at the mouth ""cover up"" rantings?  WTF does it matter to him if America killed some 5k of their own citizens? Ask him.. I really want to know.  As for debunking....  Q: Have you ever been in building constructed like the WTC?  I have.. I was in the WTC decades before it was hit.. the higher up you go the more it sways in the wind. ALL skyscrapers do.  Tell him to research the ""space scrapers"" they have built.. one has a counter weight so the sway in the wind don't go back and forth and snap the thing.  This is something that is rarely covered in any of the debunking and that is sad.. because it shows.. there was a ""secondary force"" or an ""external force"" acting on the towers other than fire and gravity.  Once the outer columns were compromised those buildings were doomed. There is a chance that they might have survived had the fires been handled.   Jet fuel need not MELT beams.. it only need WEAKEN them.  Any 'flowing metal' was very small amounts and can easily be accounted for by 'copper wire', 'metal filing cabinets', jewlery, really any metal that has a lower than or equal to jet fuel temp liquification point.

M: How the buildings fell proves the opposite So some clarification.   His clarification was shit. Actually no.. the manner in which the collapse happened proves they fell not controlled demolition.  CD is ALWAYS bottom up so the building falls onto itself and get crushed in the collapse. Watching WTC it is very VERY clear the collapse starts at the break in the columns. The upper floors fall in starting a cascade collapse. Again.. easy to find knowledge.. skyscrapers.. each floor is designed to HOLD THE FLOOR ABOVE IT with a little of buffer. Not 10+ extra stories.. that fell 1 or more stories.    M: As I said earlier the planes were a cover up. The plane triggered the explosives when it hit the tower(most likely).   But if the planes triggered the explosives, and the explosives triggered the collapse? They clearly did not fall immediately.   He thinks he's smart? He's got tunnel vision and he actually debunks himself with wild conjecture.  Other arguments he will bring up..  Freefall speed: Clearly the collapse did not fall at free fall speed, even truther videos that claim that usually show parts of the building falling faster than the collapse.   Controlled demolition because it fell into it's footprint: Yeah he should really really research skyscrapers.. lots of good stuff.. a while ago when they started building things that could crush several major blocks if they say FELL SIDEWAYS they were designed in the result of catastrophic structure failure to fall in on themselves minimizing damage to outlying structures.  He might even try the classic;  Bunch of guys living in a cave: Yes alqueda terrorists are fucking CAVEMEN like Ughh can't use technology like airplanes that are SIMPLE TO FLY.. landing and taking off it the tricky part.. flying it pretty much point and go... The worst part is when they try to make it seem like these guy are living in a cave painting the walls hunting elk and flinging poo at eachother!!!!  Sorry.. today is a bad day for me.. and Truthers piss me off because they see what they want ignore everything else.  And WTF is it his business? Where do you live so I can come up with some crazy conspiracy shit to put out on the net?  Useful idiots.. that is what conspiracy theorists are.  Pumped up with false praise how great and smart and 'awake' they are, how they see everything other 'sheep' do not.   What they 'know' as 'truth' comes straight from Shepherds who are lining them up for fleecing.   Final nail in the coffin of debunking.  Al Queda admitted it.. never ONCE did they deny it.   Now if you're a terrorists organization and your goal is to destroy america, would you accept blame for something you knew you didn't do... especially if coming out and saying 'we didn't do it.. your government did' would have been checkmate?  Good god.. this was a literal wall of text.. but I think it needs to be put out.. lots of good stuff.. angles others don't look at."

The worst part is when they try to make it seem like these guy are living in a cave painting the walls hunting elk and flinging poo at eachother!!!!   I will be quick to point out that most terrorists are actually educated. Often engineers etc.    Freefall speed: Clearly the collapse did not fall at free fall speed, even truther videos that claim that usually show parts of the building falling faster than the collapse.   As for this it will just be his word against mine and from what you can tell he thinks his views are superior by default. So i have to find a way to not only stick to one topic, but show him with accuracy in a dumbed down way that the tower could have fallen the way it did.    Controlled demolition because it fell into it's footprint: Yeah he should really really research skyscrapers.. lots of good stuff.. a while ago when they started building things that could crush several major blocks if they say FELL SIDEWAYS they were designed in the result of catastrophic structure failure to fall in on themselves minimizing damage to outlying structures.   Yeah, thanks for that one. Is there any forum i can check out to get info from actual engineers or architects? I cant jsut take the words of some guy on the internet. Sources are good as long as im not forcing him to read A LOT of stuff.    Al Queda admitted it.. never ONCE did they deny it.   I said this one time earlier and he admitted this. But often im too generous to my opponents, at least more then he is. I said that in his defence, they might probably take the blame for the attack becaus that would give them some authority and respect in a sort of well ""terrorist"" way. Even if they didn't do it. So if i pay attention to this hes going to say its exactly that, where i just suggested it as a possibility."
conspiratard,340de8,newtonsapple,3,Mon Apr 27 13:46:06 2015 UTC,Re Freefall speed: Watch a truther video of the collapse on that is saying 'look it's free fall speed' and when parts of the building fall past the collapse point it out and say something like 'the explosions from underneath must have pushed that part faster than the collapse'  Freefall speed is debunked by the video.  Actually I might be wrong about the collapse design..  But really any search about 'skyscraper' weight loads.. shows..  Gravity need only apply to do a 'footprint collapse'...  I'm not a physics person but the acting force mainly was gravity.. it pulls pretty much straight down.   The only way you get a 'sideways' collapse if there is something (like only one side of the buildign was missing).. and I'm pretty sure a big enough building that only happens in transformer movies which are full of truther bullshit anyhow. (it was a cool ass effect a building falling sideways and hitting another and remaining inatct.. would never happen)  Also any search of skyscraper consturction will give you a 'wind factor' lecture.. wind is a factor in skyscrapers.
conspiratard,340de8,BoilerButtSlut,2,Mon Apr 27 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"""Controlled demolition because it fell into it's footprint""  This is one of the stupidest claims by the truthers. They fell nowhere near a nice neat pile into their footprint! Debris covered all 16 acres of the world trade center and MORE. They completely flattened the lowrise WTC buildings, and a church across the street.  Two highrises next to the WTC even had to be dismantled due to damage for crying out loud."

If you want to point the modus operandi of holocaust deniers, it would be better to show that they usually use more subtle methods. For example the late 1940s encyclopedia they always quote which states the post-war numbers of Jews being the same as pre-war.

conspiratard,33q7b2,yashumiyu,56,Fri Apr 24 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"I'll copypaste the article:  Whenever the Dreadful Few and their controlled media start talking about anti-Semitism,[1] you can be sure that you are in for a wild trip. You might as well grab your munchies, seat down for a while, and listen a little bit because you are going to have some fun. But always keep your thinking cap on.  Why?  Well, if you like logic and reason and have little patience with complete nonsense and mumbo jumbo, then you definitely will have an urge to puke as the Dreadful Few propound their ideology upon the masses. First, let us start with Mila Kunis, one of Hollywood’s newest darlings.  Back in 2012, long after she literally prostituted herself in the movie Black Swan, Kunis complained that she “had to hide her Jewishness as a youngster in Ukraine and was miserable during her early years in the United States.”[2]  She continued to say that  “After the Holocaust, in Russia you were not allowed to be religious. So my parents raised me to know I was Jewish. You know who you are inside. My whole family was in the Holocaust. My grandparents passed and not many survived.”  She added,  “One of my friends who grew up in Russia, she was in second grade. She came home one day crying. Her mother asked why and she said on the back of her seat there was a swastika.  This is a country that obviously does not want you.”  Swastikas, according to this reasoning, symbolize evil, wickedness, hatred, and persecution. Swastikas remind Kunis of concentration camps, gas chambers, pogroms, and ultimately the extermination of European Jewry.  Yet, as we have pointed out in a previous article, Jewish Neocon Victoria Nuland made a pack with neo-Nazis in Ukraine where Kunis was born! Will Kunis chastise her? Will she tell her to stop destabilizing the situation in Russia? You see, Kunis is not making any sense whatsoever.  The only way that Kunis can prove that her testimony is genuine is if she abides by practical reason and consistency. If that is too hard to do, then it is hard for us to believe that she suffered at the hands of “anti-Semites.”  Kunis said something then that should be taken a little seriously: “I’m pretty Jewish…when I’m in New York, I become super-Jew.”  If Christ is right, that you will recognize people by their fruit, then the best way to test what Kunis meant by “super-Jew” is too look at the fruit that she has produced over the years.  Black Swan indicates that Kunis means something darker and sinister. If Eli Roth admits that he wants to “fuck an entire generation” through his movies,[3] then Kunis wants to do the same thing through her sexual acts in front of the camera. Other movies such as Ted is also an indication that Kunis seems to mean something diabolical. (In Black Swan, we indirectly see Sigmund Freud’s ideas lurking in the background.)  Another extremely important point to consider is that ballet requires talent, skills, concentration, and lots of practice (E. Michael Jones has written an excellent article on this topic entitled, “Swan Lake Meets Wilhelm Reich in Black Swan.” It is worth every piece of dime). Not every joker in Hollywood can decide to do ballet because most celebrities do not have patience enough. They want to get money the easy way by producing filth and corrupting the culture. As the old book says, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” Moreover, there is something beautiful and aesthetic about ballet that defies the Dreadful Few’s revolutionary purpose. Ballet symbolizes or displays order, docility, and reason. The Dreadful Few’s revolutionary purpose challenges that order, docility, and reason, and this is why we have people like David Cronenberg producing filth as “art.”  Which brings us to a key point here: there is no way that Natalie Portman could have acquired such talents and skills in such a short period of time or without embracing or upholding some version of the moral order. The producers indeed had to use someone else (double) to do the hard work, but she got virtually no credit for her labor:  Well, what do you expect? Haven’t we been told that we the Goyim are donkeys?  In any event, right after Ted was released, Ukrainian lawmaker Igor Miroshnichenko said that Kunis was a “dirty Jewess.”[4] The Dreadful Few, of course, went on a political killing spree by saying that Miroshnichenko was an anti-Semite and that anti-Semitism was on the rise.  But Kunis could have proved Miroshnichenko wrong by dissociating herself from other “dirty” movies, but she doesn’t seem to give an indication that she will do so at all.  So, is Miroshnichenko an anti-Semite for uttering a statement that the Dreadful Few do not like? And shouldn’t the statement itself be judged on its merit, not on what the Dreadful Few prefer? If not, then the Dreadful Few once again show that they are, in the words of David Irving, “the traditional enemy of the truth.”  And if Miroshnichenko is an anti-Semite for saying impermissible things, then why is it not racist or impermissible to say that the Goyim are donkeys? Is the Simon Wiesenthal Center saying that they have never heard of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef? How about Rabbi Eli Ben Dahan saying that homosexual Jews possess “higher souls” than the Goyim?[5]  As it turns out, Kunis, like Scarlett Johannson,[6] are just Israeli shills. Perhaps Kunis and others should read what Zionist puppet Winston Churchill said about the Jews: “They have been partly responsible for the antagonism from which they suffer.”[7]  Right after the Charlie Hebdo debacle, Haim Korsia, a chief rabbi from France, went to New York and discussed “terrorism and a rising wave of anti-Semitism during an address at a New York City synagogue.”[8] Around the same time, lawmakers in the U.K. declared that there must be an urgency to stop “anti-Semitism.”[9] What those lawmakers did not put into consideration was that  “Many of those incidents were sparked by the 50-day conflict in Gaza that ended in August. Israel launched its Gaza offensive with the declared aim of halting rocket attacks by Hamas. More than 2,100 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed, along with 73 mostly Israeli soldiers.”[10]  Jewish Neocon John Podhoretz, son of Norman Podhoretz, was upset because the Obama administration did not really see the Charlie Hebdo debacle as an indication of anti-Semitism. Podhoretz had this to say of one U.S. official:  “It’s dishonorable because his remarks suggest these murders [in France] were meaningless acts of nihilism, when they in fact were terrifyingly meaningful acts of anti-Semitic murder on European soil 70 years after the Holocaust — acts that are causing many if not most of the 600,000 Jews in France to think seriously about emigrating.  “Alas, it appears that Earnest’s vile lie can’t be excused away as an expression of his own moral cretinousness.”[11]  Point well taken. Now let us switch the table around. Former CIA official Philip Giraldi has recently reported:  “The abuse of Christian clergy and laity in Israel has been widely reported, and there are 50 laws that discriminate in various ways against non-Jews.  “The Israeli bureaucracy de facto aids the process by refusing basic services for non-Jews, appropriating or infringing on Christian and Muslim religious sites, and systematically denying things like building permits even if there is no law that is directly applicable.  “Some Israeli politicians are on record calling for the expulsion of all Arabs or creating incentives for them to leave voluntarily. Christians, many of whom are in communion with Rome, confronted by a government hostile to their interests have already done and will continue to do the latter, emigrating to find a better life within their diaspora community overseas. The number of Catholics in Israel declined by half between 1980 and 2008.”[12]  Will Podhoretz write about this in the New York Post or Commentary? Will he tell his audience about Israel’s real racism? The Daily Beast has just recently reported that Israel has deported at least three Ethiopian Christians, but they were not that lucky at all. They got caught by Israel’s friendly neighbors, ISIS. ISIS in turn beheaded them.[13]  Where are people like Raymond Ibrahim when you need them? Where are the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Neocons/Neo-Bolsheviks? Will they ever have at least some courage to report this fact?  The answer is no. In fact, Podhoretz, as his other articles indicate, would like to finish the job that his father had started: he wants to encourage the United States to get into a useless and bloody conflict with Iran and then send precious Americans to die in the Middle East for the Israeli regime.  In fact, Podhoretz and Sheldon Adelson have been saying that America needs to bomb Iran since 2013.[14] As already indicated, John Podhoretz got this idea from his father, who wrote an article in 2007 entitled, “The Case for Bombing Iran.” Their puppets, most specifically John McCain and John Bolton and to a large extent the Republican Party, which Bill Kristol himself says is similar to Zionism,[15] took copious notes and repeated the same thing this year.[16]  Christian Zionists such as Michelle Bachmann also got into the act. Bachmann believes that the rapture is right around the corner because, among other things, Obama is trying to make a deal with Iran! “If you look at the president’s rhetoric,” Bachmann adds, “and if you look at his actions, everything he has done has been to cut the legs out of Israel and lift up the agenda of radical Islam.”[17]  Sounds like Bachmann has been reading HAl Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth. Lindsey, who laughed all the way to the bank in the 1980s and 1990s with his crazy apocalyptic books, believed that “the decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it.”[18]  Not every evangelical believes that nonsense anymore. In fact, there is a small but significant number of Protestant sects that completely reject not"

If not, then the Dreadful Few once again show that they are, in the words of David Irving, “the traditional enemy of the truth.”  And if Miroshnichenko is an anti-Semite for saying impermissible things, then why is it not racist or impermissible to say that the Goyim are donkeys? Is the Simon Wiesenthal Center saying that they have never heard of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef? How about Rabbi Eli Ben Dahan saying that homosexual Jews possess “higher souls” than the Goyim?[5]  As it turns out, Kunis, like Scarlett Johannson,[6] are just Israeli shills. Perhaps Kunis and others should read what Zionist puppet Winston Churchill said about the Jews: “They have been partly responsible for the antagonism from which they suffer.”[7]  Right after the Charlie Hebdo debacle, Haim Korsia, a chief rabbi from France, went to New York and discussed “terrorism and a rising wave of anti-Semitism during an address at a New York City synagogue.”[8] Around the same time, lawmakers in the U.K. declared that there must be an urgency to stop “anti-Semitism.”[9] What those lawmakers did not put into consideration was that  “Many of those incidents were sparked by the 50-day conflict in Gaza that ended in August. Israel launched its Gaza offensive with the declared aim of halting rocket attacks by Hamas. More than 2,100 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed, along with 73 mostly Israeli soldiers.”[10]  Jewish Neocon John Podhoretz, son of Norman Podhoretz, was upset because the Obama administration did not really see the Charlie Hebdo debacle as an indication of anti-Semitism. Podhoretz had this to say of one U.S. official:  “It’s dishonorable because his remarks suggest these murders [in France] were meaningless acts of nihilism, when they in fact were terrifyingly meaningful acts of anti-Semitic murder on European soil 70 years after the Holocaust — acts that are causing many if not most of the 600,000 Jews in France to think seriously about emigrating.  “Alas, it appears that Earnest’s vile lie can’t be excused away as an expression of his own moral cretinousness.”[11]  Point well taken. Now let us switch the table around. Former CIA official Philip Giraldi has recently reported:  “The abuse of Christian clergy and laity in Israel has been widely reported, and there are 50 laws that discriminate in various ways against non-Jews.  “The Israeli bureaucracy de facto aids the process by refusing basic services for non-Jews, appropriating or infringing on Christian and Muslim religious sites, and systematically denying things like building permits even if there is no law that is directly applicable.  “Some Israeli politicians are on record calling for the expulsion of all Arabs or creating incentives for them to leave voluntarily. Christians, many of whom are in communion with Rome, confronted by a government hostile to their interests have already done and will continue to do the latter, emigrating to find a better life within their diaspora community overseas. The number of Catholics in Israel declined by half between 1980 and 2008.”[12]  Will Podhoretz write about this in the New York Post or Commentary? Will he tell his audience about Israel’s real racism? The Daily Beast has just recently reported that Israel has deported at least three Ethiopian Christians, but they were not that lucky at all. They got caught by Israel’s friendly neighbors, ISIS. ISIS in turn beheaded them.[13]  Where are people like Raymond Ibrahim when you need them? Where are the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Neocons/Neo-Bolsheviks? Will they ever have at least some courage to report this fact?  The answer is no. In fact, Podhoretz, as his other articles indicate, would like to finish the job that his father had started: he wants to encourage the United States to get into a useless and bloody conflict with Iran and then send precious Americans to die in the Middle East for the Israeli regime.  In fact, Podhoretz and Sheldon Adelson have been saying that America needs to bomb Iran since 2013.[14] As already indicated, John Podhoretz got this idea from his father, who wrote an article in 2007 entitled, “The Case for Bombing Iran.” Their puppets, most specifically John McCain and John Bolton and to a large extent the Republican Party, which Bill Kristol himself says is similar to Zionism,[15] took copious notes and repeated the same thing this year.[16]  Christian Zionists such as Michelle Bachmann also got into the act. Bachmann believes that the rapture is right around the corner because, among other things, Obama is trying to make a deal with Iran! “If you look at the president’s rhetoric,” Bachmann adds, “and if you look at his actions, everything he has done has been to cut the legs out of Israel and lift up the agenda of radical Islam.”[17]  Sounds like Bachmann has been reading HAl Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth. Lindsey, who laughed all the way to the bank in the 1980s and 1990s with his crazy apocalyptic books, believed that “the decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it.”[18]  Not every evangelical believes that nonsense anymore. In fact, there is a small but significant number of Protestant sects that completely reject not"

Among stupider arguments, he brought up that the companies that produce these vaccines are, on most occasions, fairly untrustworthy, what with their unscrupulous marketing, buying of legislation, and constant settlements of fraud suits with massive payouts to plaintiffs. It can be hard to square the idea that these entities are very untrustworthy, and yet you should listen to work that comes from them. It's the same reason you see people who don't believe anything the US government says because, you know, governments lie, and why I distrusted GMOs on the whole for several years due to the outsized role companies like Monsanto played in their development.

One of the big problems I see with reddit is how it generates consensus in terms of what news is important and accurate, relevance and visibility is determined by upvotes, and upvotes are heavily influenced by how quick to digest the content is and the title of the post. Some people are concerned with external parties manipulating reddit but for some reason not at all concerned with having their news filtered for them by the consensus of a large anonymous userbase. On a small niche sub like this one it's not so much of a problem but look at subs like /r/news and /r/worldnews, most posts are hardly seen by anyone. What did those few posts on the frontpage have that the vast majority of posts didn't? When you're consuming news by consensus like this you're putting blind faith in the machinery."

It’s scary seeing that and not knowing what in the world is going on.”   Is it possible this is all a big exercise near a former military base that is being used with the town council's blessing? Yes, it is possible.   Big Spring sits astride Interstate 20 and US 87, the primary north-south four lane leading into the Texas panhandle. Military planners would look at it as a transportation chokepoint — a critical junction. The Army made presentations to the Big Spring City Council and the Howard County Commission.

In an Econ 101 supply/demand graph, prices should have skyrocketed during this time. And indeed they did, at least in some places. The problem with the Econ 101 graph is that it doesn't account for how your customers will resent you for it (CheaperThanDirt.com comes to mind).  It resulted in smaller local shops bringing prices up a little, selling out their whole stock, and hoping that would tide them over until the next shipment came in at some unspecified date. Some of them also tried a few tricks; Glock slapped the wrist of a few local shops who took the second mag out of a complete package and tried to sell it as an additional accessory. ""Wrist slapping"" here means ""we aren't sending you Glocks anymore if we catch you doing this"".  So the end points didn't benefit much because they were feeding off a small trickle of stock coming down from the distributes. The distributors didn't benefit much either, because they were feeding off a small trickle of stock that was coming from manufacturers. Manufacturers didn't benefit much, because it takes time to build a new factory to increase production, and who knows if the demand spike will still be there by the time it's finished.  What we're left with is a situation that maybe had a short term benefit for a few stores and private sellers who gouged their prices. Possibly also a few manufacturers who were able to expand production and make the money back before demand dropped off (some of the 22lr and 5.56 ammo factories probably fit here)."

In fact, many people believe that Obama was emotionally affected by Sandy Hook and wanted legislation to ban many firearm types. That's not controversial or a conspiracy theory. He said he did.  You can't use evidence of his failure to ban guns as evidence that he never wanted to. In 1994 they really did federally ban all sorts of semi-automatic rifles, just because they were afraid of them. This fear of guns is very real and it does lead to banning many types of weapons used in self-defense and hunting, so a large group of people in the US do think there are people after their guns (because it really did happen federally one time).  Of course whenever there is a mass shooting, there are people who will be afraid that guns are going to get banned or legislated. After Sandy Hook, there was a law that tried to restrict ammunition capacities and implement redundant background checks that already existed.   Instead of addressing mental healthcare, mandatory screenings of mental stability, or increasing security in schools (just as how we have guards to protect our banks), the government wanted to restrict gun rights.  So is it really that strange for anyone to fear gun control advocates when their solutions are not to solve gun violence or massacres, but to stop gun rights?  I as a liberal, do absolutely understand this fear of having guns being taken away by government federally (for some in the rural regions, they need guns to hunt for food; you'd be surprised). All it takes is a few tragedies for sweeping changes to gun laws to prohibit them instead of addressing the underlying causes of violence (education, healthcare, economics, mental healthcare, security in buildings). You will never stop a psycho teenager who has plotted a massacre, with no record, by using a background check.  The Columbine shooters had 99 illegal devices. The pipes were already banned. They still found a way to get them. Nothing would have stopped their killings except that one police officer who simply happened to forget his glasses at home and missed when he was shooting the perpetrators.  So you would think legislators would want bomb sniffing dogs in certain counties and better training for police officers who are protecting schools. But that's not what happened. The knee-jerk reaction was to ban guns.  Why should I be surprised that many conservatives who had many of their property lost due to the 1994 federal ban (or the handgun/rifle bans in Chicago, DC, NYC), would be so afraid of gun control? They have reason and evidence to be afraid.  And no I am not talking about the conspiracy theory regarding Sandy Hook (the whole the victims aren't real nonsense). That's just retarded conspiracy theorists, and it doesn't represent a significant portion of any group."

Not only did ""conservatives who had many of their property lost"" not lose property, the value of that property skyrockets because pre-ban stuff is worth more.  Pretty much every other ban of anything firearm related proposed at the federal level also included a grandfather clause. (I can't think of a single one, but there might have been one proposed at some point that did. It didn't get very far, if so.)  Yes, it's a terrible day for freedom when the evil gubmint wants to take your god given property and uh...make it worth twenty times what you paid for it.

What exactly would be entailed by ""Death to America"", ""Death to England"", and ""Death to Israel"", anyway?  That said, I disagree with the widespread outlawing of holocaust denial across Europe.

That's what propaganda is.  So any time you accuse a group of propagandizing, is that now hate speech?  Simply because you can associate it to a cultural/ethnic group, is that now ""Racist hate speech""?  Since we're in a thread about Iran, let's use the example of the eronious claim that Ahmedinijad called for the destruction of israel and for it to be ""wiped off the map"".  If this is not true, wouldn't perpetuation of that claim be akin to liable.  If we are to view him as the representative of the Iranian people (the vast majority of whom are ethnically persian""), would this pernicious liable not be directed against the Persian people?

conspiratard,3355ze,rsh412,2,Mon Apr 20 14:35:48 2015 UTC,"What Ahmadinejad actually said or meant seems much less obvious than the veracity of ""The Holocaust is a fraud perpetrated by Jews to gain sympathy and support."" The controversy over how to take the remark seems to be over whether he was referring to the government of Israel or Israel itself and whether or not he used an active verb such as ""wipe away"" (as compared to a passive verb such as ""vanish""). It does seem that the active verb is the intended reading of that comment, which implies some action on the part of the Iranians (or someone) to bring about the end of the regime. It's also worth noting the quote at the bottom of the section you link to:   You should know that the criminal and terrorist Zionist regime which has 60 years of plundering, aggression and crimes in its file has reached the end of its work and will soon disappear off the geographical scene.   Ahmadinejad seems to consider ""the regime occupying Jerusalem"" to be synonymous with Israel and seems to imply that Israel is an illegal government occupying foreign land. In this context, it's hardly obvious that his criticism was limited to hoping for the current Israeli government to change.  Israel certainly isn't above reproach. They've done some terrible things. I would be happy if the current government did go away and was replaced by a less paranoid and hostile one. I hope they will soon recognize the necessity of the two-state solution and allow the Palestinians to pursue their own path (and I hope the Palestinians will do the same with the Israelis). Equating Holocaust denial with criticism of Israel seems specious though."
conspiratard,3355ze,know_comment,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:35:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughtful response.  I'm not trying to start a debate about israel.  I'm just using the example because it's pertinent to the ideology of this sub.  I'm debating the point at which criticism becomes hate speech.  And the point at which speech becomes something we are willing to outlaw.  Regardless of your personal political or emotional views about israel- don't we have to set that aside to have an honest debate?  OR, maybe we should defer to Israel/Jews as victims in a different way than we would differ to other groups whose victimhood might be deemed lesser.  I personally would see that as inconsistent, but as long as we admit/agree to it- we can have an honest debate.  At what point in the subjective nature of history, do we decide that the propagation of an opinion should be illegal?  If, for instance, there is no agreed upon definition of the holocaust (Elie Wiesel believes the term applies to strictly Jewish victims of the Nazi Genocide, whereas others would argue that the term should and does apply to all victims or portions thereof) would any debate on the subjectivity - especially one that frames jewish interests, be on the level of hate speech?    I'll try another example.  6 million jews were killed in the holocaust.  There is documented evidence showing 3 million jews being killed in the holocaust.  Would denying the other 3 million- undocumented- be considered hate speech?  Let's look at other massacres.  Jenin would be a good example.  Human rights groups have claimed Israel committed war crimes in the manner in which civilians were killed in Jenin, with estimates at 500 deaths.  Israel's investigation claimed there were only 54 deaths and that most of them were terrorists.  Now, someone is clearly very wrong. There is a 1000% difference in those statistics.  So who is the arbiter of that fact?  And at what point do you decide that those ""misstating"" a number for political commodity is committing a crime simply by doing so?"
conspiratard,3355ze,rsh412,3,Mon Apr 20 16:15:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone's arguing that lies, bad statistics or even propaganda should be outlawed. The Holocaust is a very specific thing and its denial is never asserted by any credible source. Holocaust denial is universally asserted by people with anti-Semitic motivations, whether it's the leader of Iran or a neo-Nazi in Ohio. I'm not even sure that I favor outlawing denialism as it does skirt an uneasy line, but as others have noted, it's not the denial that's outlawed, but the propagation of that denial to others. In that context, I think it's easy to see the spread of Holocaust denial as being a way to try to convince others that Jews aren't worthy of sympathy, support or even basic rights (I mean, if Jews really did fake the Holocaust to defraud the rest of the world for the next 60 years, then they're pretty horrible people who deserve retribution and punishment, right?). That's the major difference between Holocaust denial and denying that you killed as many people as others say. Holocaust denial is meant to demean and defame Jews. Israeli denial of major deaths caused by their actions is meant to protect the state and its interests from blame. That certainly doesn't make the allegedly inaccurate numbers Israel gives ok or just, but it does change the context of them. Israel doesn't claim to have killed 54 terrorists in order to spread the idea that Palestinians are subhuman monsters."

Libel directed against a racial group is racist hate speech. This isn't a difficult concept.   If this is not true, wouldn't perpetuation of that claim be akin to liable.   Yes, Israel and the Western media libelled Ahmedinijad via wilful mistranslation of his remark.   If we are to view him as the representative of the Iranian people   That's stupid.

conspiratard,3355ze,bluefisch200,2,Sun Apr 19 20:52:29 2015 UTC,Holocaust denial as well as talking about it and spreading it is not illegal everywhere in Europe. For example in Switzerland it is perfectly legal. We even had a German woman giving a speech about it a few months back. She will get problems when she returns to Germany but here she is absolutely safe.

At least 1 in 3 Iranians are not Persian, some sources put the number as high as 50%.  The country has always been called Iran internally, for thousands of years. The Shah asked foreign governments to start using Iran in 1935 instead of Persia, which was when it changed internationally. It was not something changed by or in any way related to the revolution.  People don't use the term ""Persian"" in relation to their nationality in Iran (ethnicity yes), and it has nothing to do with their approval of the current regime, most people I met couldn't stand the regime but were very proud to be Iranians."

The child porn on a 'flash drive' (i think) was put there by the Illuminati to discredit him because he was investigating them.   defending, said she had been instructed the reason Greaves had the images on his computer was because he was conducting an investigation on the ‘Illuminati’.

Admittedly, there's not much in the article about his defense, but it seems to me like he's not claiming that the Illuminati planted the evidence, but that he accumulated it as a side effect of his ahem very thorough investigation into their networks of organized child predation. (Obv. he had to make/share some porn too, as a cost of doing his deep-undercover investigation.)  Does anyone else come away with this reading?

See the Wikipedia entry on the Muslim Students Association:   Members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the world's oldest and biggest Islamist movement, established the first MSAs in the country... and the movement's ideology continued to influence the MSA long after that.

The article this one draws heavily from keeps quoting ""sources"" that give very explicit and detailed information that I'm currently guessing is completely made up. I don't know of any way to further verify that this information isn't a complete fabrication, because the sources are unnamed and there are no corroborating reports or evidence that I've found so far.   According to these same sources, “coyotes” engaged in human smuggling – and working for Juárez Cartel – help move ISIS terrorists through the desert and across the border between Santa Teresa and Sunland Park, New Mexico. To the east of El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, cartel-backed “coyotes” are also smuggling ISIS terrorists through the porous border between Acala and Fort Hancock, Texas. These specific areas were targeted for exploitation by ISIS because of their understaffed municipal and county police forces, and the relative safe-havens the areas provide for the unchecked large-scale drug smuggling that was already ongoing.  Mexican intelligence sources report that ISIS intends to exploit the railways and airport facilities in the vicinity of Santa Teresa, NM (a US port-of-entry). The sources also say that ISIS has “spotters” located in the East Potrillo Mountains of New Mexico (largely managed by the Bureau of Land Management) to assist with terrorist border crossing operations. ISIS is conducting reconnaissance of regional universities; the White Sands Missile Range; government facilities in Alamogordo, NM; Ft. Bliss; and the electrical power facilities near Anapra and Chaparral, NM.   EDIT: Bonus - this is the top comment on the original article. Obama is literally and actively smuggling ISIS into the country, guys. After all, he's one of them! Obama hates our freedoms."

Even the gang that my wife and I met (who went on to stab somebody later in the night after we met. So, maybe not that friendly to their rivals.....)  One of the gang members had lived in Florida, which is where my wife and I were from, so we bonded with him over talking about what a crappy place Florida is, and how glad they were that my group was there only to learn, not to build houses shacks and preach to them (like most groups did that stayed where we were staying).

conspiratard,32xpcj,MrTubalcain,-7,Sat Apr 18 02:13:36 2015 UTC,"I actually made a theory when talking to a friend earlier today about the Islamic State threat in Mexico. I have converted it over into Reddit format for simplicity and to add sources:    DISCLAIMER: I am not a government employee and my theory is not (so far) rooted in deep evidence although some elements may site sources, this is only a theory.  Preface   The Mexico Drug Cartels are feeling negative effects of marijuana legalization in the United States.  It is an open secret that the US Mexico Borders are largely at risk of immigration influx with 700 miles of the US-Mexico border still left insecure.  The Islamic State makes millions every day.  The cartels are the experts at smuggling people and items into the United States.    Phase 1  ISIS forms an alliance  ISIS wants to bring the war to the United States mainland. In the not so distant future the Mexico Drug Cartels will be hurting for money and becoming desperate. These two could mutually benefit each other. ISIS can afford to pay big bucks to have the cartels sneak Islamic State militants into the United States, and certain cartels would use ISIS militants to gain an edge over rival cartel groups. This will also benefit ISIS because if they get a foothold in Mexico they can easily begin recruiting militants directly from Mexico outside of the United States.   Phase 2  Controlled Chaos  ISIS will create a crisis in Mexico by some human means like mass executions, forced starvation, or just doing what they are doing in Iraq and Syria right now. This will create a huge immigration crisis along the United States border like never before with thousands upon thousands of people illegally coming into the United States by the day. It would be extremely easy for wolves to hide among the sheep in a humanitarian crisis such as what would happen.   Phase 3  The Attacks  According to the Washington Times ISIS already has targets of interest picked out within reach from the US-Mexico border. An attack on a place like the electrical power stations in New Mexico could put millions of people in the dark. They could then follow up with attacks in the areas around the power stations under the cover of darkness. This is of course a very far fetched idea of what could happen, but small attacks like mass shootings at schools, and places of worship are all well within the scope of possibilities. Attacks like the Charlie Hebdo attacks could become somewhat common for at least a few weeks within the United States.     Second disclaimer: the State Department and Mexican government are both calling the report from the Washington Times “unfounded”, however I linked the article because my theory takes place several years from now, and the article is the closest thing I have now to form a theory on."

Why would they suddenly be able to make a trade with a group who has a different religion, culture, language, history, etc etc. Aside from that, why would ISIS be willing to work with a group which is primarily Christian, overwhelmingly Catholic.  Just because they're both brown doesn't mean they are ready to be best friends."

You look at people like Alex Jones and of course Rand Paul, who is a conspiracy theorist himself (shows up on Alex Jones show a lot), and his beliefs are so far right, that people mistake it for ""left"" or ""center"". (e.g. federal ban for abortion, anti-government stances, flat taxes, hatred of taxes, irrational paranoid belief that government is trying to come after individuals and political groups using the IRS or NSA).  It is no mistake that conspiracy theorists tend to believe in ideologies that are outside the norm and not very well thought out logically. They tend to be pseudo-intellectuals, with arguments that at first glance seem skeptical, but are really just contrarian.  The left-version of this is people like Noam Chomsky, who is considered politically anarchist and who seem to be unable or unwilling to understand concepts like intention in law and the role of government (compares everyone to Nazis). Tends to believe everything is a conspiracy plot by the US to make the world suffer for their own personal gain."

conspiratard,32xi2y,AlexDeGruven,8,Fri Apr 17 15:20:00 2015 UTC,the Fox News extreme right crowd.   Because Fox has taught them to think properly and programed them to see all the 'liberal-homo-abortion-darwinist-atheist tricks'....  They don't have an opinion till Hannity or Oriley gives it to them therefore they can only parrot that and do it with vehemence because they have no counter arguments.. again what they have they did not learn they were fed.

If you want to know a secret, republicans love military spending because when manufacturing jobs shipped to asia over the span of the past 30-40 years. Army jobs were the only thing to replace them especially in the rural areas that lost a lot of manufacturing jobs.  http://theelectoralmap.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/03-17-military-recruitments-2007.jpg  So you have tons of republicans that scream about cutting government spending but get pissy when somebody suggests cutting the military budget because basically army jobs are the welfare for the republican rural constituency.

conspiratard,32u09s,workclock,12,Sat Apr 18 05:16:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's a summary of what happened as I can best tell.   Alex doesn't believe Gallup poll saying half of Americans view Obama unfavorably (he thinks it's much higher) because people he talks do don't share the same opinion William calls in saying that congress is not exempt from the health care bill, and they have to go through the same process to go through the exchanges to get health insurance if they want to. Alex Jones immediately accuses him of being a ""Democratic seminar caller"". Puts him on hold and says a lot of disjoint buzzwords ""Harry Reid talking point"", ""the insurance companies and Mitt Romney were behind it"",  Caller says everything he's saying is from the healthcare.gov website, and he's reading from the bill.  Jones thinks ""Gotcha!"" and says ""you can't believe a federal site, that's like believing a fact sheet at Walgreens that says there are no side effects to the flu shot"" Jones accuses William of liking Obama.  William says he thinks Obama has done a pretty good job so far, and that the bill is made so people could buy healthcare insurance through exchanges on the open market and that the government doesn't run the healthcare Jones talks about death panels (I thought we were done with that shit in 2010)  and then flailing around trying to peg down what his job is.  ""Do you work in government?""  ""I bet you feel like you're winning in your little IRS job or Parks department job"" William says jones is going off topic, which he does a lot.  Jones accuses Will of being a seminar caller, and listening to NPR all day.  ""I bet you believe vaccines are good too"" More of the same stuff. Alex Jones tries to make people scared of water they drink and vaccines so they buy Alex Jones approved merchandise from the Infowars store.  Alex Jones speaks with a kind of certainty that  makes you believe what he is saying is backed up, but nothing is really substantial.  He finally guesses the callers vocation, a social worker, and thinks himself some sort of mindreader.  ""I knew it from the tone in your voice, you get off on power"".  Goes on an ad hominem tirade against Will. One of Jone's sycophants calls in and reinforces Jones's bias."

You'll notice that she didn't start immunizing her children again until there was an outbreak already in her area. If she would have done it in the first place they her kids wouldn't be suffering.

If you read the article you'll find that she didn't spout anti-vax to anyone else, she was put in a situation where she wasn't sure who to believe and so chose to do nothing. She realised what a risk she was taking and so scheduled her kids to get vaccinated, but before their appointments they got sick.

I don't see why people on reddit are so reluctant to forgive people who make mistakes. Sure this one was bad, but you weren't in her position.

That's the position of hubris, that's not the position of ""it's what's best for my children.""  What's best for your children is what your doctor tells you and if you (she, not you personally, I don't have a problem with you)  feel that you (see previous) know more than your doctor, then you should have seen a different doctor instead of trusting the anti-vax movement.

It would be like lead poisoning.  Folks realize that the people who PUSH flouride on us are going to have ""studies"" that prove how wonderful it is. Just like people who support vaccines have all kind of ""proof"" of how wonderful they are. Or the NIST report that shows that the NYC towers were able to turn into pixie dust just like the government said. Flouride isn't ""soluable"" it is a poison that accumlates in the body.   (go figure this asshole would also be a 9/11 truther)  ME: Again, the  ""causing massive brain damage to unborn fetuses and gradually impairs IQ"" ---  Came from a study in china that concluded that exposure to ""high levels"" of fluoride in childhood was associated with a reduction in IQ.  A study which was found then to be corrupted, and proved false by countless other studies.  ""flouride has a cumlative effect""    Again, ANOTHER GOVERNMENT STUDY where High-fluoride (100 and 200 ppm)(An amount large enough to poison humans) water was administered to rats orally to study the fluoride-induced changes on the thyroid hormone status.  Yeah, amounts 50 times greater than people get were given to rats and they had cumlative thyroid problems.   WHoa! http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21755305   And again, when THE STUDY says ""cumulative"" they are talking about cumulative EFFECTs on rats - Not that it ""It doesn't leave the body.""  This nonsense fits nowhere in biochemistry.    Further, do you know what HIGH means?  High-fluoride (100 and 200 ppm) water.  Toothpaste contains between 1000-1450 parts per million of fluorides. Water contains a maximum of 4 parts per million- less than half of one percent the amount found in toothpaste.   Please, if you don't believe in ""Studies"" then STOP USING THEM TO JUSTIFY YOUR BASELESS BS.   This is called wanting to ""have your cake and eat it too""    Either studies are BS, or they're not - Pick one, you can't have both.  Man, I guess the ""illuminati"" world government must of been real stupid to publicly announce their own study on rats that you happen to be citing-incorrectly.  And that doesn't even account for the fact that not only is this historically inaccurate, but Perkin's(who was a nut) book contains no mention of the use of fluoride by the Nazis at all. His claim was about the communists, of which he provided 0 evidence or documentation for whatsoever.  You'd know this if you werent too stupid to do a google search on the book.

He called me all the tard names, I said it was amazing he could figure out which hole to put it in, there was him yelling about 9/11, then me actually trying to teach him dynamics with free body diagrams (I'm a civil engineer), DUMBS, aliens, the fucking lizards, you name it, we talked, then yelled about it. Looking back, I'm sure it was quite comical. Now I just roll my eyes, have a nice chuckle, then move along.   For me, the big take away from being a quasi CTer to not being one was this: it's just like politics; people don't care about being right or winning, they just don't want to be wrong. It doesn't matter if being right is the worst outcome imaginable.

The minute a Democrat gets elected, the meltdown begins. In fact, before a Democrat gets elected. The GOP base started losing its shit in mid-2008 when the election of Obama was still months away. That's part of what made McCain's pick of Palin so dramatic: Suddenly the lunatic base of the GOP had one of their own on the ticket. They reacted with extreme enthusiasm. It was so bad that McCain could not even campaign alone, anymore. He had to go wherever Sarah went, because she was ten times more popular among the part of the GOP base that is actually engaged and shows up for political rallies. The activists.  Normally a VP and Presidential candidate travel separately so they can cover more ground.

I do know this about Christian Scientists - they are one of those groups that is against medication.  I would imagine they are very much anti-vaxx.  As far as being a money-syphonying, financialy destroying cult - that can really only be Scientology.  Please don't confuse the two."

Since their reaction to the tragedy was to shut it out and pretend it couldn't have actually happened, the conspiratards that go so far as to harass and bully the victims see the inclusion of children as a cheap shot, or a blatant appeal to the emotions.

However, I think I've figured out a way around this. So here's my plan:   befriend conspiratards tell one of them you've discovered the location of a secret NWO prison camp and you need their help to infiltrate and document it. The plan within a plan:     a. you will arrange for the conspiratard to be arrested and put in the NWO prison and they are to go along with it     b. in the prison, you have hidden a video camera (like a wearable pinhole microSD camera)     c. the conspiratard's mission is to retrieve the camera, secretly record video from inside the prison including self-interviews explaining what's going on    d. they'll periodically drop the microSD cards at a dead-drop within the prison and pick up a new memory card with additional objectives     e. they have a secret transmitter that they can use to signal for rescue/retrieval at any time.   f. when that happens, or they reach end of the season, the conspiratard makes a daring ""escape"" with car chase, explosions, pursuing aliens with laser weapons, etc.  the prison will be exactly as we've described--actors, black helicopters, Obama impersonator in full Muslim garb, reptilian aliens, other 'prisoners' who may befriend the conspiratard, you name it. in addition to the conspiratard's footage we'll be recording them the whole time with hidden cameras and microphones edit it all together and broadcast the show profit   The great part is that the conspiratard himself/herself will still insist it was all real, that their actual experiences have been edited after the fact to appear to be a part of this reality show.  We're okay legally, because at no time were they ever actually imprisoned against their will. They could have left at any time."

conspiratard,32hkin,HildredCastaigne,20,Tue Apr 14 18:10:34 2015 UTC,"I can't help but think this points to a strange new trend in the conspiracy theory world.   Well, false flag beliefs have been around for a while. I mean, hell, it's an actual intelligence term and there have been recorded false flag acts. Good example of this would be the Gleiwitz incident, where Nazi SS attacked a German radio station dressed up as Poles to broadcast an anti-German message in Polish all as part of the buildup to war with Poland.  False flag attacks are real. The fact that conspiracy theorists see a false flag when they're late for the bus or lose their keys doesn't make them any less real, though any accusation of such an attack should be viewed with a critical eye. The main difference between actual false flag attacks and what conspiracists call false flag attacks is evidence (the conspiracists have none).  Crisis actors are also a real thing. They're used by the government during the drills, to make them more real for the participants. Crisis actors in the conspiracy sense (actors hired to make a false flag attack look real) seem to be a new thing. The belief in these type of crisis actors seems to have been created by James Tracy, a tenured professor at Florida Atlanic University. Most likely, he read something on actual crisis actors and jumped to conclusions.  Crisis actors fit in nicely with the conspiratorial world view. I mean, there's no real reason to use crisis actors. It's a needless complication, puts more people on the payroll who can blab their mouth, and in everyone of these conspiracies the government is a bunch of evil sumbitches who would have no moral compunction about committing mass murder but for some reason still want to fake it. However, that's all fine because the conspiracist operates on Reverse Occam's Razor: the more complicated, the better."

Its an actual psychological condition (though for the life of me I can't find the name for it), but more or less yeah.  They want to believe that 9/11 was all part of some plot, that Sandy Hook was a ploy by the anti-gun lobby to disarm American citizens, and that JFK was killed as part of some plan by his political opponents to take control of America for one reason:  Simply put, because the alternative is to accept that sometimes horrible things will happen with no rhyme or reason beyond someone wanting to willfully cause harm to another person, or just random co-incidence. Sandy Hook could have been any school in the country, it just so happened that a man with a severe mental illness and access to guns happened to be living nearby, ran out of meds, and went on a rampage.  In all honesty, I pity them. They cling to this idea that somehow everything has a deeper meaning because the alternative terrifies them beyond reason. I mean really, think about it. Really think about it for a minute.  Any day you send your kids to school, or you go into work, or anything like that could be your last. It could be a terrorist attack (unlikely, but possible), it could be a madman with a gun (more likely, but improbable), hell... it could be one of your tires blowing out and causing you to crash your car, or it could be that you ate the wrong hamburger and got mad cow disease, or it could even be a heart attack...  If something like that happened, I can see some part of myself wanting to believe that it was part of a plot. Maybe the hamburger was given to my brother because he knew too much, maybe the car crash was because he found out something he shouldn't have or because the green energy guys want to villify the oil industry, and so on.  I'd be wrong, but some part of me would want to believe that there was a reason beyond 'sometimes, bad things just happen'.  EDIT: Whoever gave me gold for this, thanks."

conspiratard,32hkin,pbjamm,1 point,Tue Apr 14 11:21:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty much yeah. People want the easy out more often than not.  It takes a lot of time and energy to really analyze anything, hence why so many people will just grab the first thing they see.  Lets take George Zimmerman as an example. He has some severe psychological issues, specifically anger management. I don't think his killing was motivated so much by Trayvon Martin's race, if anything the fact that his victim was black was probably just a co-incidence. Still, rather than analyze his motivations, many Americans just immediately latched onto the idea that it was a hate crime, ignoring the fact that Zimmerman himself isn't white, he's Hispanic, and even has some African ancestry.  Personally, I think Zimmerman was motivated by the fact that his marriage was failing as much as anything. He was angry, he was in the Neighborhood Watch, and he wanted to take out his emotions on someone.  It could have been anyone. It could have been someone older than he was, it could have been someone the same age. It could have been a white person, another Hispanic person, an Asian person. Hell, it could've been anyone. Trayvon Martin was a target of convenience for Zimmerman.  Maybe he didn't intend to shoot him at first, but he did, and now he's going to be stuck dealing with his actions for the rest of his life.  The man will never have a normal job again. No business would risk hiring someone who would attract that kind of attention to them. Either from angry customers who want to cause trouble because the business hired 'a known killer and hate monger', or his supporters who can be just as extreme.  George Zimmerman has severe anger issues. He's had several relationships and marriages where he's been abusive towards his partners (a matter of public record, charges have been filed for several of these) and he is clearly a violent man. Again, it could have been anyone that would have wound up on the other side of his gun that day. It was just co-incidence and convenience that it was Trayvon Martin.  But that takes a long time to analyze doesn't it? Hence why people see a kid who's black as the victim and immediately say 'it was a hate crime'. Like many redditors, they want the Too Long;Didn't Read version."

In 2008 they repeatedly told us that a false flag incident and martial law would cause the cancellation of the 2008 election, so that Bush II could hang on to power.  In late 2008 they repeatedly told us that a false flag incident and martial law would prevent the handover of power from Bush II to Obama.  In 2010 they repeatedly told us that a false flag incident and martial law would cause the cancellation of the 2010 mid-term election, so that the Democrats could hang on to Congress.  In 2012 they told us that the election would cancelled by gun violence in Mexico. (You know, just like the Zapatista uprising in Mexico led to the cancellation of elections and martial law in America in 2004-2006.)  Along the way - even before SARS and H1N1 and Hurricane Katrina - they repeatedly told us that a virus outbreak or natural disaster would be the pretext for martial law. 9/11 didn't result in cancelled elections or martial law either.

conspiratard,329ujw,thinkmorebetterer,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"The US doesn't extend to non-citizens the rights it guarantees to its own citizens. Felons for instance lose the right to free speech, or foreign militants who are in some horrible prison like Abu Ghraib certainly won't have any human rights respected.   Again the question comes down to what human rights are being protected. I mean many states have different visions of human rights, the common association being socialist or communist states protecting economic or social rights whereas states like the US value political rights. This is why Europeans have such a hard time imagining why the state doesn't provide healthcare for all and why Americans might be appalled at the pervasiveness of government oversight.  Or do you believe something like the UN declaration of human rights, perhaps you subscribe to the ideas and definitions of certain other philosophers in the field. In ""Universal Rights in Theory and in Practice"" by Donnelly he makes a distinction between (and I'm probably not quoting him correctly) expected versus given rights. Is your right to an education one that you expect to not only be respected but also provided and guaranteed come hell or high water? Or is it something you feel you should have the freedom to get or not to get?  I've looked into the subject. I'm no expert on it, but I do have formal education on the subject.   I remember the professor partway into the semester tried to make it very clear for everyone who might not have been paying attention. At one point he comes out and says ""Just so we're clear, human rights are a construct, one that we've come up with. There are no guaranteed rights and you cannot claim to have any rights unless you can protect them."" He's also a pretty big advocate for them. But it's an accepted truth that human rights are not inalienable.   It's a great subject."

I can see it interpreted as such:  We dismiss door to door proselytizers out of hand because we trust our own beliefs in science. In the comic this is subverted. The reality we know and believe is being dismissed out of hand because people trust their own believes in astrology. We become the proselytizing man and empathize with his position.  When we reapply this to our world is where the analogy breaks down. I can see that one of the interpretations  is we are like the people in the comic,  clinging to our own preconceived reality in light of the truth being offered to us.  Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the artist to know their agenda and purpose. Again it just feels sloppy."

conspiratard,329oin,waffenwolf,16,Sat Apr 11 21:16:00 2015 UTC,The thing about the 20th century was that due to the Cold War and it's many proxy conflicts there was a lot more actual conspiracy going on. It wasn't as necessary for paranoids to drum up nonsense- there was a lot of work to be found actually identifying conspiracies (or selling nonsense professionally as disinformation).

conspiratard,329oin,MRB2012,5,Sat Apr 11 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"Aside from the well-documented 'Dirty War' between the IRA and the British clandestine agencies, I've occasionally heard stories that such-and-such bombing was really a scam designed to look like paramilitary activity: nothing on the scale of the ones above, mind, just those ones where shops would be blown up in the middle of the night without anyone being injured. Never heard anything that tips the balance against the presumption of innocence, though.  At the same time, though, the IRA have a moronic fan-club that refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing on their part. Most recently we've had men and women coming forward to say that they were raped by IRA operatives, both as children and as adults; of course, these people are all lying, and it's all a Dáil/RTE/Unionist/British [delete as appropriate] plot to ruin Sinn Féin's chances of getting into government in time for the 1916 Centenary."
conspiratard,329oin,jackierama,2,Sun Apr 12 06:35:44 2015 UTC,Proxy bombing doesn't real!
conspiratard,329oin,MRB2012,2,Sun Apr 12 19:23:56 2015 UTC,"With regards to the Omagh bombing there were some revelations a few years back about GCHQ monitoring the mobile phone exchanges between the suspected bombers on the day of the bomb.  GCHQ 'monitored Omagh bomb calls'  Which would probably make it a prime material for tards to springboard off to all sorts of outlandish gibberish as they do.   What I would say is that the Omagh Bombing was a very definite watershed moment for the conflict that turned public opinion very much against continuing hostilities and made the required compromises from that point on in the peace process that bit more palatable. If there was one good thing to come out of such a tragedy it was that a failed peace process was just no longer an option.   More generally though it's certainly true that republican (IRA, INLA etc) and loyalist paramilitaries (UVF, UDA etc.) are/were infested with British Intelligence agents over the years, particularly towards the end of the troubles to the extent that they are suspected to have colluded in assassinations/murders so why it's never really been a source for conspiritards to latch onto I'm not so sure. There have been insinuation from the ever dwindling number of hard-line dissident republicans over the years that Martin McGuinness (former IRA and current Deputy First Minister) is some sort of agent but it has never really gained any sort of wider conspiritard interest from what I've seen."

Do you mean depopulation?"
conspiratard,329oq5,Youma,6,Sun Apr 12 08:10:59 2015 UTC,"Although he obviously did not explain himself very well, I think /u/Bowlslaw refers here to the fact that advanced nations actually exhibit negative population growth, so that the population boom is really only a problem in poor nations (and in nations like the United States that have large, demographically independent populations, although it should be noted that even the U.S.'s overall population growth rate has fallen to .7% from 1.7% in 1960) and is inextricably tied to more general economic problems (i.e., the challenge, at least in regards to population growth, is to bring the poorer populations to Europe's level, and not to check economic growth -- a counter intuitive fact for many people)."
conspiratard,329oq5,true_new_troll,4,Sun Apr 12 18:43:42 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. Overpopulation is a legit issue.

conspiratard,3271sd,lumidaub,-22,Sat Apr 11 14:51:42 2015 UTC,"The pro-vaccination crowd is steadily becoming mostly a ""forced vaccination"" crowd. That is why you're downvoted. The argument basically is this: By not vaccinating, you are directly responsible for people around you who may become ill. The virus is not at fault, it is the person.   In a few years, we will probably see the roll-out of the idea that not wearing a mask and quarantining yourself while having the flu is a crime, and other such nonsense. Perhaps not exactly following the government's recommendations for nutritional intake for your children will be considered child abuse. It's going to get ugly."
conspiratard,3271sd,hotjohnnyjogs,14,Sat Apr 11 19:55:03 2015 UTC,Actually the argument is that it's better to compromise Total Freedom by mandating that children are vaccinated than to eventually have to compromise it with quarantine and travel restrictions.

Some vaccinations are mandatory, they inform you the day or two before, go to school and get vaccinated. You can't opt-out unless you have a damn good reason to (muh rights need not apply). You can argue about personal liberties but this is a surefire way to prevent mass Measles outbreaks.  In fact, no one opted out, at least the people I know and my old schoolmates. There is not a single anti-vaxxer movement here, at least none that has traction."
conspiratard,3271sd,Dreamerlax,8,Sun Apr 12 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"The only downside of this is that it's the wealthier communities that have lower immunisation rates, so they're not going to be terribly affected as they're unlikely to receive family benefits anyway.   It's a start though, and I definitely support any incentives to vaccinate, or to punish anti-vaxers.   Next step, restrictions on allowing non-vaccinated children into schools and childcare centres."
conspiratard,3271sd,Khalexus,6,Sat Apr 11 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"Small, poor religious communities with lots of kids will be pissed. Think Hasidic Jews or people who interpret Aboriginal belief systems to forbid vaccination."

For instance, if you a 20 yo single mom with a record for child abuse and no job, and you get a kid, your additional welfare is nil and your taxes might even increase. You might even get have a compulsory meeting with child services at age 4 or something.  However, if you're a married couple with excellent financial standing, maybe a grown child or two that have no record/a good education, the system would offer you welfare generously if you chose to have an extra kid and there might be tax advantages to it."

Rushmore, taking selfies in front of the world's largest ball of twine, meeting hobos, having adventures, falling in love, breaking up, crying on the bathroom floor in a seedy motel 6, you know delving deep into the true ""Americana"" spirit... all while inciting horrifying terror burning down small towns in the dead of night along the way.

conspiratard,323u8m,Bull3tM0nk3y,3,Fri Apr 10 21:02:29 2015 UTC,"Alright I am a big fan of the Show so let me debunk this worthless, waste of server space article.    The many articles on this site attempt to prove that the same set of symbols – those of the ruling elite – are being permeated across popular culture. While we often look at outlets intended for teenagers or young adults (such as movies and music videos), children are definitely not exempt of it. A blatant example is Disney’s new show Gravity Falls, a “quirky and endearing” cartoon about 12-year old twins spending summer with their Great Uncle Stan in Gravity Falls, Oregon.   Same set of Symbols? you mean the ones that you take from hundreds of different secret societies that have different opinions about each other that you lazily throw together to make something that doesn't exist. I am glad he said blatant rather than subliminal as they are there not to mind control you but rather tell the story of it's universe that most cartoons would not think of.     Up until 2010, only 32nd Degree Scottish Rite Masons (the highest degree attainable other than the honorary 33rd) or Knight Templars of the York Rite could join the Shriners. This means that Grunkle Fez is most probably a high level Freemason. Therefore, he knows what’s the deal with all of these symbols. He knows.   Firstly let me say that Grunkle Stan's fez is based off the Shriners in fact the creator has been seen many times wearing a Shriner Fez and many of them are in his Office. The article misses the point because Stan isn't a Freemason at all but rather a satire version of it called the ""Royal Order of The Holy Mackerel"" which was based off the Alex Hirsch's old Deviant Art account.    This frame flashes for literally a split second at the end of the intro. We can easily recognize the Illuminati pyramid with illuminated capstone and All-Seeing eye, along with other alchemical and magical symbols. Also, there’s the Contra code on NES, which is rather hilarious.   When the Author of this article found a contra code for the NES he should have stopped there, it shows the kind of people actually work on the show are basically nerds poking fun at different concepts in a kids show. I also don't know why he thinks that Alchemical Symbols are part of the Illuminati master plan, I mean it is basically a useless proto Science at this point, Chemistry would be more useful to our Reptilian Overlords.   Aside from the eyeballs everywhere, the little humans in a jar are homunculi – a concept that is found in alchemy and occult rites.   I think he is missing the point everything in Stan's Mystery Shack is fake and has no real magically properties, he is a con man after all.   All-Seeing Eye at the apex of the mountain   It is foreshadowing for the awesome character of Bill Cipher. Also I am sure that this man would love to write about Rick and Morty with it's mountains with eyes in the first episode.   The attic of Great Uncle Stan’s shack has a prominent Masonic stained glass window featuring a symbol that is omnipresent in this cartoon.   That stained glass window makes a beautiful environment in this Cartoon. Yes there is Masonic Stained Glass with the Eye of Province on it but it is on a Tourist Trap owned by a Con Man with a criminal record not exactly putting Masonic imagery in a good light.   Stan appears to have two Owl clocks – the owl is an ancient symbol representing the occult elite (those who work in darkness), the Illuminati and the Bohemian Grove.   Why would a group of Atheists from the 1700s want to do with a bunch of superstitious people at the Bohemian Grove unless you are someone who takes their opinions from Alex Jones propaganda films.    Check out the rug on the floor.   Yes the Eye of Province is everywhere in the show that the joke that organizations like Vigilant Citizen and Infowars are the butt of.    The letter “A” of the word “Shack” consists of a compass above and All-Seeing Eye, a combination of symbols of found in Masonic symbolism.   You would think that in a show that is supposed to be pro Freemason would put it's symbols in a more respectful light rather then turn it into an A.    In short, Disney’s new show is centered around a specific set of symbols associated with secret societies and the occult elite, which we call the Illuminati. While some might argue that these signs are inserted to add “mystery” to the show, we must also consider the fact that popular culture in general is being permeated with the exact same set of symbols. This show plays it part by exposing young children to the symbolism, which normalizes it and ultimately accomplishes what the occult elite has been doing for centuries: Hiding in plain sight.   Bullcrap, Your concept of the Illuminati is so vague it is unfalsifiable never mind the fact that many secret societies disagree with each other all the time. The All Seeing Eye doesn't need anymore normalization it is on the back of the American Dollar Bill the same one that has cherished American heroes like George Washington which has much more potential for an ""elite"" as media like Gravity Falls and Deus Ex has made the Eye into a Symbol of Evil. The ""fact"" of it not being a way for the show to appear more mysterious because somehow they are everywhere in popular media is a bizarre opinion and is without merit to skeptics.      I have hated this article for a very long time it is garbage that doesn't even try to appeal to the view of those who spend years making it but rather make a brain dead article that panders to it's audience of scared old people and tried to ruin this show's reputation before it had time to explain what everything is."

Normally I just try and ignore any crazy things he says and just focus on talking about sports or my job, literally anything I can think of. But as many probably know to a conspiratard ANYTHING is a conspiracy topic.   We are driving and he mentions something about Saturn which leads to a claim that ""the Earth does not revolve around the Sun"". His reasoning was that Saturn is alwasy visible in the night sky year round. But it shouldn't be because at some point the Earth would be on the opposite side of the Sun as Saturn so it would be blocked. I'm no astrologist...and neither is he which makes this so ridiculous...so I couldn't really refute anything. He claims scientists are lying to us all to keep the knowledge for themselves.   This led me to search a bit tonight and found the link I posted. This guy is amazing. I feel like it's basically just him pimping his books. At one point he claims the oceans couldn't be on a surface of a globe because physics...oh but gravity is a lie.   From what I gather his whole deal is Masons in NASA lied about space travel and the moon landing, etc. So we can't trust anything there. And this is all some conspiracy by ""Sun worshipers"" to make everyone an Atheist because if you believe in the Big Bang you can't believe in a higher power.   What about satellites?? How does you GPS work? There's a lot of complex physics and calculations that go into launching these things successfully.

We have been taught that a mysterious force called “gravity,” a magical magnetism responsible for keeping everything from falling or flying off the spinning ball-Earth, is just strong enough to hold people, oceans, and the atmosphere tightly to the surface, but just weak enough to allow bugs, birds and planes to take off with ease!

How convenient!?   Yes, it is awfully suspicious that all of these explanations just so happen to be internally consistent and perfectly explain the observations we make about the world around us. That's the perfect kind of lie!  (And yeah I know it's inertia rather than gravity that prevents us from feeling the velocity of the planet and its atmosphere.

This, Sandy Hook, really was a senseless atrocity with absolutely no purpose, goal or wider consequences beyond the mass murder of twenty kids and their teachers. No governments were dislodged, no dictators fell, no security overhauls were made, not even a single change in cockpit doors - absolutely nothing resulted beyond some failed gun registration and restriction measures.

As an example, bleach enemas. The story was doing the rounds a couple weeks ago if I recall, and while I was struck by how mind bogglingly awful the practice was, I don't think you can accuse the parents in these cases of being uncaring - if they didn't care for the welfare of their child then they wouldn't pour so much time and effort into these unorthodox pursuits.

If actions are what matters and we don't take intentions into account, then it's totally possible for people to do morally wrong things and be condemned for it, despite them thinking that they were doing the right thing.

That's part of what can make it so hard to convince people they're making a mistake. They care about their kids! They feel right. Doesn't mother know best?

It can be extremely, psychologically hard for someone to come down, back off, and admit that they were wrong in a way which doesn't allow for back-pedaling or revision of the story. Some people live lies, lies where they're the hero, they're always right, and minor inconsistencies get edited to the point they're no longer a threat. However, once it gets to be too big, and they find they can't just explain away polio, they're locked in. They have to watch their lives crumble around them because the alternative is too painful.  For the adult, it's a tragedy; it's watching someone's life disintegrate because of a not-uncommon character flaw. For the child, however, it's a goddamned catastrophe: Their protector, the one peorson who was supposed to put them above all others, has failed, and they're left with some horrible disease for absolutely no good reason. It doesn't do anyone any good, it isn't part of any plan, it's just their parent being a damned nutball and them paying the price."

I have known many rape and sexual abuse victims in my time, from ages 4-40, and the one and only guarantee for the victim is that they have been irrevocably changed at the whim of someone else. Even if the perpetrator actually sees jail time, which only happens in a very small percentage of the time to begin with, they're often out in less than 5 years. The victim often hasn't even processed what has happened to them or all the myriad of ways that encounter still effects them by that time. Why should the offenders get off so lightly in relation to the victims? I certainly don't advocate rape for the offenders, but on the rare occasion they do see prison for those crimes the still often make out better than their victims.   Just for some background, I used to work with abuse victims and emotionally disturbed kids. I don't any more. The desire for payback and the disgust at seeing how rarely anything happens to the worst of us combined to make leaving the field  much better idea for everyone involved. If you really think an attacker only deserves the scant few years in jail they often get for repeatedly raping a 4 year old child and all but guaranteeing that child will never have a normal life in any sense of the word, then I don't know if we'll ever see eye to eye on this."

When it comes to rape and sexual abuse survivors, I will side with them every single time over the offenders. Especially when it comes to children, since those perpetrators are both the least likely to see jail time and the most likely to re-offend."

I just have a feeling that you are talking with more emotion than fact.  Which is understandable and even justified, don't get me wrong.  I understand the desire to harm people who harm innocents.  I get that.  But there is a catch 22 in letting a rape victim kill thier rapists.  Simply put it doesn't change the fact they were raped."

He shall remain anonymous for the time being to protect his life as well as the lives of his family.   In other words, I don't have a source for this, I am just making this up right as we go.    It is a legitimate question: why there are no birth certificates and birth records for Malia and Sasha Obama, while there such records for children of other presidents? For example, media questioned, whether Sarah Palin’s youngest child is actually her daughter’s child, Sarah Palin produced his hospital birth certificate. Media reported on adoption of McCain’s second daughter Bridget, on adoption of Romney’s grand children, on birth of two of Romney’s grand children by a surrogate, why not provide an explanation, why there are no birth records of Malia and Sasha Obama in national databases, while all the other records are there. This is particularly of interest, as it was shown that Barack Obama is using a stolen Connecticut Social Security number of Harrison Bounel, which failed both e-verify and SSNVS and fabricated IDs. What is going on?   Lol bullshit begets more bullshit.

Some of it is so obvious that it's a little sad actually.  For example, take this poor old woman they keep picking on (she appears at the top and bottom of the album): first of all, if she's already put fake blood all over herself, why would she need to wear a prosthetic leg, just to make it appear bloody? Did they run out and throw on an emergency fake bloody leg? Both legs are bloody. Does that mean both of them are prosthetic? If so, why doesn't the other leg have a ""prosthetic leg strap""?

If you take a relatively small group of people and put them in a room there is a good chance that they will share a birthday. This is called the birthday problem. Well, you can take that same logic and apply it here, even though it's not a true birthday problem, but a variation of it.  Look at the events independently, what is the chance that a fictional date in a work of fiction (which could be any day) will match the date of a terrorist attack (which could happen any day)? Well, it depends on how many chances there are for the match up to take place. We start to get to about 25% range somewhere around 250 (which I promise is only a mathematical coincidence sheeple). How many prominent works of fiction displayed future dates a few years before 9/11? I actually have no idea, but you get my point I hope. Let's say it's 250. That's a 1/4 chance something like this would happen could happen by chance. Is that greater than the chance of 9/11 being orchestrated by the gubmint? Yes, yes it is.    As for the year, well the movie was set in the late 90s. 2001 is far from an implausible date for a license to expire."

I did grow up Catholic though and know a little about it.  The Catholics had to edit a lot of source material out simply due to its contradictory nature (even more-so than the current material.) If you're gonna put together a narrative, shouldn't it at least be remotely believable and consistent?  You are correct, of course, in pointing out that this infuses incredible doubt to the validity of ANY text used in the bible.  The Gospel of Thomas is a perfect example of contradicting material. The four Gospels cross-validate each other's stories and personal accounts of Jesus better than any other texts in the bible. Therefore, one could say it is somewhat reasonable to edit out any other texts that contradict the four main Gospels' story line, like Thomas' book does.(Ultimately, this is not solid logic because one can't say ""the bible is true because it says it's true in the text!""...I see the hypocrisy...but I am simply trying to explain their arguments.)  Also, most Christians (Catholics included) do not believe the bible is the inerrant word of God, rather they believe that the authors of those texts were directly influenced or inspired by the Holy Spirit to write these (Thereby allowing the biases of that individual to be present in the text without being self-contradicting to the ""true and inspired"" messages of that text.)"

As far as drilling that lesson into people's heads go, it's a good book.  As for the Bible having been edited repeatedly, that's no surprise - nothing is static for two thousand years. However, saying that it's Satan's work is a bit much. More than likely, it was a bunch of dudes that got together, looked at all the bits and pieces that could make up the next version of the Bible and went ""I like this, drop that, that stays in."" Although one could make the point that it was about controlling the masses (""Pre-marital sex is evil!""), since Christianity's influence in Europe can't be understated.  EDIT: Another point to question. If the Bible is built under Satanic influences, why leave in all the stuff about how awesome and totally-on-your-side Jesus is? Wouldn't it be beneficial to re-write it completely to show how Satan is this totally cool guy who saved humans from being the pets of a dickish creator?

But I agree.. for having just 'skimmed' your understanding of it is pretty well grounded.. many just say 'it's all crap and rubbish'..  but it's easy to see this issues if you re-read it with all the 'churchin' drained from you. :)   Although one could make the point that it was about controlling the masses (""Pre-marital sex is evil!"")   True.. take but the proscription against homosexuality (as I said.. bible stories and crap are old beyond reckoning) actually makes (made.. as I said.. hundreds of thousands of years ago) sense.  Think about how thin the human gene pool was at the beginning of the human race. So that is one of the oddities.. such a rule protects the gene pool. It's actually smart..   Do we need to 'protect the gene pool' any longer?   No.. that ended when we could test tube baby. Not to mention our gene pool is deep.. there's billions on the planet so we're in no danger of interbreeding to mutations.

They were raised in a society and an era that placed a great deal of importance on Christianity.  My family quit going to church when I was 9 or 10 because the Sunday School was telling the kids some fucked up things. They would read us stuff about the ""end times"" and really drive home how terrible and scary it was going to be. We had to accept Jesus as our lord and savior and if we didn't, we'd go to Hell and suffer for all eternity. We'd never see our parents again and God wouldn't be able to help us/wouldn't save us because we knowingly picked Satan over him. And Jesus could come back at any time, so if we weren't saved, we would immediately go to Hell. Mind, these were adults preaching ""fire n' brimstone"" to kids between 5 and 11 years old.  So if this is the kind of Christianity the average conspiratard was raised with, it's no wonder they take it so seriously.

But think about this, many of the Muslim extremists you see committing acts of violence are doing so because of extreme religious views that are probably equivalent to the views you hear from the Christians on your Facebook page or on blogs.  IF you could speak Arabic and browsed Arabic blogs and pages you would no doubt see the same things.  I have seen several atheist or antitheist conspiracy nutters also, they are just statistically less prevalent I am guessing"
conspiratard,31r8nk,Ardhen,6,Tue Apr 7 17:30:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe the smaller number of non-religious nutjobs is because most of the atheists and antitheists who would otherwise be conspiracy theorists get their smarter-than-the-sheeple kick from rejecting religion?  Adding this just in case: I'm not saying that all atheists are atheists because they desire to be ""better"" than religious people, just that the ""I'm more in the know about what's REALLY going on in the world"" attitude seems to be a point of convergence for religious and non-religious conspiracy theorists."
conspiratard,31r8nk,brieoncrackers,21,Tue Apr 7 16:39:49 2015 UTC,"Agnostic here.  From my point of view, believing in God and the Bible is having blind faith. The keyword here is blind. Usually, you don't believe in God because someone or something proved to you it was all true. You believe it because it's what people told you is true since you were a child. So you believe first, and then only, you look for proofs that go your way, and dismiss those that don't.  Same thing goes with conspiratards. They believe first, then they try to prove that what they believe is true.  So often, one person working this way for religious questions will work the same way for other things like conspiracy theories.  In psychology, these behaviors are called cognitive biases. Most specifically here, confirmation bias.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"

There's been plenty of stories of people who've gone through some shit and come out the other end believing in God, even if they were firmly atheist or agnostic before. In deeply religious countries this could maybe be ascribed to a latent confirmation bias, but it happens in largely secular societies as well."

I'm just against this common mistake of believing first and trying to prove next.   Huh? How does science work?

Religion it's, in my opinion, an essentially harmful practice because it relies on a foundation of beliefs which are unprovable. This provides a model and a precedent for believing things without evidence or with very poor evidence, and I, for one, would like to discourage belief under such conditions. Belief with little or no evidence has a greater likelihood of negative consequences than belief with good evidence."
conspiratard,31r8nk,mortenlu,5,Tue Apr 7 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"It's a natural continuation of the paranoia. Someone even bigger and badder than the Government, the Illuminatti, Aliens, and Reptilians combined could ever hope to  be- the embodiment of evil itself. If you were raised Christian and have paranoid tendencies, you are likely to start seeing Satan working against you everywhere.   Keep in mind, this goes for all religions too. Conspiracy theories are rampant in the middle east as well, and many of them are based around Islam. Hinduism isn't really dualistic, so I don't know if there are any Hindus out there who think that an evil force is controlling everything wrong with the world.  But keep in mind that since the beginning of religion things like demons and faeries were blamed for things like deformed children, illness, and death. It's a part of the process of explanation."
conspiratard,31r8nk,pumpkincat,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:12:01 2015 UTC,"So, basically, while most hardcore conspiracy theorists think that the NWO is the final boss, the heavily religious ones go even further and reveal Satan as its true form?  Using things like demons and fae (and, in these cases, Satan) to explain things is a massive step backward, as far as knowledge of how reality works goes. Back then, they didn't have the benefit of technology and the wealth of knowledge we do today.  Although, that makes me wonder if, in ancient times, there were people who were convinced that illness was caused by microbes and viruses and everyone else around them went ""Ugh, you fucking idiot, it's obviously demons!"""
conspiratard,31r8nk,aDeadSoul,2,Tue Apr 7 17:55:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's rational, just it's how some people think. As for the last part, nobody even considered microbes before microscopes, and really if you think about it the claim ""tiny little invisible creatures cause you to be sick,"" can apply to both demons and microbial life. Without evidence (which we didn't have the capability of producing until fairly recently in the grand scheme of things), both claims are equally likely. After the idea of medicine developed, but before we had the capabilities of viewing bacteria there was an idea of ""bad air"" transmitting disease, and this is in fact a much more sound claim than bacteria if you don't have microscopes.   I suppose what I'm saying is that even if something ends up being correct, if you make an astounding claim without evidence you're still as good as wrong."

You might find a 9/11 truther that is a devout Mormon, or an anti-vaxcer who believes in mother Earth, but that doesn't mean all 9/11 truthers are Mormons, or every anti-vaxcer is Wiccan.  I've also noticed that many conspiratards take atheism to a level of extreme that one would only expect from devout religion.  The only real correlation is that people who spout conspiracy theories as fact, tend to have a closed mind, and that same closed mindedness is applied to their spiritual beliefs."
conspiratard,31r8nk,sweaterbuckets,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"It was simply the correlation that I noticed. Possibly, even probably, because the sample size is rather small and geographically localized.  However, what really boggles my mind is that following their ""logic"" to its conclusion would lead to different answers than the ones they came up with. For example, if the Catholic Church is secretly run by and worshiping Satan, then how can you trust the Bible?

Of course, while the Dead Sea Scrolls were kept out of the hands of the Catholic Church, they were stored under wraps by the Rockefeller Museum in Israel for 50 years prior to public release.

conspiratard,31r8nk,Wifrin,4,Tue Apr 7 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"There are normal Christians, who make up the majority, and then there are a relatively few radical Christians.   The former live normal lives and interact with all kinds of ideas so they learn to like or at least respect others to the bare minimum; the latter tend to isolate themselves and their families so that everyone they interact with thinks like they do. When everyone you know is like you, you start to blame your problems on people you don't know who aren't like you. And it's easy to be paranoid about people you haven't met and have been told to mistrust all your life.  It's not so much a problem with Christianity, but a problem with any insular group breeding paranoia. Some ideologies may be more prone to it than others, and the Christian idea of the ""saved vs the unsaved"" may be a good jumping off point for crazy ""us vs them"" theories, but I'd wager you could see the same kind of paranoia develop along ethnic lines if the conditions were right even if religion weren't involved.  tips fedora"

conspiratard,31psdk,redyellowand,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:38:26 2015 UTC,Apparently organic non-gmo cane sugar is ok. I guess that is gonna be my only source of carbs seeing how finding fruit or vegetables without dextrose is such a pain.

I find the whole article quite hypocritical. They say she resorts to calling her accusers sexist and racist, but that EXACTLY what gawker does every day."

Is that why you hate them?"

Freezepeach is supposed to be Free Speech right?   As for not liking Gawker, I could care less what their political views are. The only thing I disapprove of is shitty clickbait comprising most of the site. Clickbait in general has ruined online ""news"" and even formerly reputable news sites are taking on the clickbait model due to the success of sites like Gawker. The only way to stop clickbait is to stop taking the bait and stop clicking. That said, I did enjoy this article. Unlike most Gawker pieces I've read it seemed to be well-written and generally in the right direction. If the whole site were like this, I wouldn't have a problem with them."

They found a model to make money that works. I really dislike shit like the Gawker Stalker project they had going but their model to me isn't what's bad. Clickbait is meant to catch your attention but the content doesn't necessarily have to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Gawker produces news nuggets in digestible quantities for a different generation of news consumers. Without the clickbait model, there are a lot of people who would be way less informed. It seems a bit elitist to dislike how someone consumes their news if it's generally accurate and relevant and it's weird to hate the producer of that news. I think it's actually MORE justifiable to hate them for their political views than how they present their content. Their content is also a justifiable reason but I don't see the hate in the how."
