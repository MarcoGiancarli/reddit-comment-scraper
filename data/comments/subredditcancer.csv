And thus the inherent problem with giving moderators the ability to ""delete"" comments.    Even though the capability to [delete] or otherwise [remove] comments (and thus entire threads) MAY serve some valid purposes (like the ability to delete obvious ""spam"" or comments that are intentionally ""offensive"" in a sort of ""watch me VANDALIZE this thread"" sort of way)...  Well it can and obviously also IS being used by certain moderators to ""stifle"" debate, and to simply get rid of comments, ideas, and positions (including thoroughly logical, rational and even IMPORTANT arguments) -- and to do so SOLELY from their own ""bigotry"" (and especially when ""called out"" on that).    As I have noted in other places -- though he has so far only ""hinted"" that he would like a ""technology"" solution -- I think /u/spez is likely to try to come up with some ""compromise"" solution... to give the moderators the ability to ""hide"" what they feel are ""offensive"" comments from the general ""lurker"" public, yet at the same time, to ALLOW other users (Logged in? Gold? Other Qualified?) to nevertheless still see, and possibly even override and ""unhide"" things... to serve as a sort of ""watcher of watchers"" -- and to do so on an ""opt-in"" basis (ergo, one cannot claim to have been ""offended"" by content that one is aware in advance had been flagged as ""possibly offensive"" and yet chosen to view anyway).  At least I am hopeful that he will be positing some kind of approach similar to that -- which IMO would be a vast improvement to the current state of things."

I've been doing this for years now, so finding the next best site isn't so hard anymore.   They copied the Reddit Model what makes you think they won't copy the corporate sellout endgame?   The reddit model is great, before they got rid of being able to see the voating it was fairly transparent and encourages proper moderation and quality content.

They also have investors who may have expressed concerns about things like r/jailbait, r/fatpeoplehate, etc.   Reddit is caught between a rock and a hard place because they've never had the means to keep genuinely illegal things off their boards, so once they started to feel pressure to remove things that were merely controversial they were forced to comply. They also know perfectly well that eliminating free speech on reddit will result in their userbase leaving. Voat does not have to get caught up in this nonsense if they don't want to . They have expressed their desire to make their site a free speech zone permanently, and I believe them.

subredditcancer,3dcor7,XPostLinker,0,Wed Jul 15 10:57:48 2015 UTC,"The solution to this is easy.  Allow member and subreddit filtering.    Can do this with Reddit Enhancement Suite with the proper input data. See below.   Hide subreddits you dislike,    Can hide subs from r/all with Reddit gold.   and filter any comments from those subscribed to them.   I can actually do this too after some scans. See this post and the last section on comments. Once users are tagged I can filter them out (though I do not).   This way reddit doesn't lose anything diversity wise, while making the experience pretty and safe for those that get uptight over whatever they chose to be uptight about.    While all previous solutions are already possible it does not help. People can just make alt accounts they do not use on the subs getting them filtered. Ther're band-aids.   I personally want an age filter.  Under 22?  Filter.  This way what's seen is what one prefers to see, without sacrificing the diversity of the user base.

A lot of what I take from reddit IS being able to witness fringe communities to get a better understanding of what their hot topics and arguments are, and disprove them.     I'll give you a hint.

There are millions of registered users and hundreds of thousands of subs. Circumventing those those filters is as easy as opening an incognito window and signing into a new account.

Would basically be a massive indexed real-time search engine watching everything or require the base code of Reddit to be modified heavily for it to work. After all that work all a user would need to do is open a new account to avoid it. It's not an effective enough solution to justify the work.   People want to express ideas and argue, and the moment you start to police the conversations, the Internet will find an alternative.  The users provide the content, and you provide a message board for discussion.    99% of the users do not care. Reddit has 169,000,000 unique visitors every month. Only a fraction of them comment and even smaller number contribute. Of those contributing the number of people upset about this are an even smaller fraction. This and other subs are just echo chambers that make everyone sound important and give those shouting the feeling they are in a large group  Setup filtering.  It's the only, and realistically best way, that will have more benefits than the problem you're trying to solve - and solve this problem as a side effect.   I disagree.

subredditcancer,3dbp2q,Cruel-Anon-Thesis,3,Wed Jul 15 00:54:18 2015 UTC,"I posted these elsewhere, but here's my best guess:  Reasoning  It'll be decided in the same way it always is: based on outrage culture and what's prominent.  /r/FatPeopleHate got cut because it was popular and leaking. /r/Niggers got cut too, but later quietly recreated as /r/Coontown, and I think /r/GreatApes.  /r/Jailbait got cut because the media caught wind of it. Same story with /r/Creepshots, except the latter got recreated as /r/CandidFashionPolice. (A trick that didn't work for FPH, because they were obnoxious about it and didn't keep to themselves.)  If I had to guess? The next on the chopping block will be racism, holocaust denial and anti-feminism subs, depending on which sub gets targeted by outrage first. I'd expect /r/holocaust to be given to someone who isn't a denier. /r/Coontown will be cut, with a blanket ban placed on racism-oriented subs. /r/TheRedPill will get whacked eventually. /r/MensRights is on a knife-edge. The various gore subs will likely be left alone, because they're not ideologically focused. Perhaps /r/BeatingWomen or /r/SexyAbortions will be cut on ideological grounds. I imagine a standard of consent will be introduced, but loosely enforced, for porn subs. No one wants to police those subs, but if someone complains enough about a sub or video it'll get culled. /r/KotakuinAction and /r/TumblrinAction will be safe, as the latter only takes potshots at the extreme left and the former tries to behave respectably enough. /r/Trees will, of course, stay up. On the other hand, /r/DarknetMarkets that discuss selling credit cards, or /r/shoplifting? Those may go, depending on the size and attention.  Predictions  The content rules will be vague enough to permit the above. Something along the lines of:   Subreddits with a purpose of spreading hate about a gender, sexuality, race or other class of people will not be permitted. Subreddits with a purpose of spreading nonconsensual pornography will not be permitted. Subreddits with a purpose of carrying out or encouraging harassment will not be permitted. Subreddits with a purpose of discussing intent to commit crimes will not be permitted. Subreddits with a purpose of brigading other subreddits will not be permitted. A consistent failure by mods to prevent the use of a subreddit for any above purpose will not be permitted.   Those will do the trick. Few will object to the principle of banning hate speech, nonconsensual porn, harassment, crimes or brigading. It's broad enough that any outrage-targeted sub can be cut, without bringing about an obligation to cut SRS or other extremist left wing subs, or popular, sanitised subs. It'll also be light enough that the various unsavoury subs will try to better police themselves, a la CandidFashionPolice, while still being cut if garnering enough outrage."

The gist of it goes something like this:   (ASSUMPTION) Evidence shows that women orgasm more during rape. (ASSUMPTION) Evidence shows that fertility rates are higher with orgasm. Ergo, the female body favours insemination by rapists. Tack on some theory along the lines of ""if a female is overpowered and raped, the attacker likely has good genes, making it advantageous to bear his offspring.""

Yes, of course there is. Not only is there doubt (massive amounts), but your (Yishan's -- and actually he stole it from /r/conspiracy) construct is actually laughably absurd -- it only has ANY appearance of ""truthiness"" because it leaves out most of the pertinent data (see below) -- and even if it were true, well it would only be proof that Ms. Pao was actually unqualified for the position in a different manner.  Let's compare & contrast some important points here, noting the backgrounds/education and experience or ""savvy"" of the people we are talking about here:    Year Ms. Pao Mr. Ohanian    1983 Teenager already fluent in Mandarin and English, attending a prep school Pooping in his diapers   Circa 1985~87 Graduates from High School, heads to Princeton Graduates to ""big boy"" pants (i.e. hopefully no longer pooping in his diapers)   1991 Graduates from Princeton with an Electrical Engineering Degree Joined cub scouts (or little league or whatever), favorite book is probably ""Clifford the Big Red Dog"", most likely thinks girls are ""icky"" and have ""cooties""   1994 Attains Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School (no trivial feat, go watch The Paper Chase (1973)) Avidly collecting Pokemon cards, playing Nintendo, probably has no idea what an ""internet"" is   1994-96 Works as a Corporate Attorney for a major NYC law firm Busy learning how to make farts with his hand in his armpit   1998 Achieves MBA from Harvard Business School Experiences puberty, no longer certain girls are ""icky""   1998~2001 Works for WebTV Finishes High School   2001~2005 Works at a variety Silicon Valley firms, including the large BEA systems Attends & Graduates From U of Virginia with degrees in ""Commerce"" and ""History"" (assuming one is a major & one is a minor, but not sure which).   2005 Joins KPCB as ""technical chief of staff"" Founds Reddit with S. Huffman under Y Combinator   2006~2012 Still at KPCB, apparently engaged in (assisting, etc) all kinds of deal-making, various office politics, personal politics, gamesmanship, etc, all in a fairly established firm, a big-money, high-power, high-profile operation (IOW not exactly some ""naive"" place where no Machiavellian activities are going on) Sells Reddit to Conde Nast (for a relatively low dollar figure in ""hightech"" terms), stays on as employee under contract until late 2009, then sort of wanders around doing odd things: TED talks, writing/hawking a book, etc.   2013~2014 After being let go from KPCB, does consulting then becomes employee at Reddit (personally hired by CEO Yishan), eventually steps into (so called ""interim"") CEO role. Comes back to Reddit, gets put onto board (apparently at request of CEO Yishan).    Now given that the person in the left hand column has degrees in Engineering, Law, and Business (and not exactly from some no-name community college either), and has worked for ~2 decades in probably a dozen companies, and been involved in a host of different legal conflicts (both her own and as an attorney with others), as well as a plethora of high-ticket ""deal-making"" scenarios (with all of the backstabbing & other shenanigans that go on in such things)...   By contrast, the person in the right hand column has all of about 5 years of actual ""business"" experience (and most of that working as an ""employee"" in a firm that he had founded and sold in a not-very-savvy ""deal"").  And you're trying to tell me, that the latter managed to thoroughly and entirely OUTMANEUVER and completely HOODWINK the former, to trick her into being some total sucker-patsy in his game? (And then posted ""Popcorn Tastes Good"" in public?)  Well, dude... whatever Ms. Pao's failings (and I think she has many*) -- and whatever Mr. Ohanians skills (and I think he may actually have a couple, plus a bevvy of failings*) -- I rather doubt that she is such a naive ingenue as that, nor that he is anything like such a skilled Machiavellian chess player (and by the way, neither is Sam Altman, who is even younger and arguably LESS experienced/savvy than Mr. Ohanaian).  That little ""tinfoil"" hat ""conspiracy theory"" is entirely implausible -- it requires both of them to be something they are not (in fact it more or less requires us to believe the OPPOSITE of the evidence of their lives.    * Failings: As I have pointed out in other posts, while she may have significant technical, legal, and financial ""deal-making"" savvy, prior to taking on the iCEO role, Ms. Pao had virtually ZERO experience in operational management, and what little she may have learned from the previous CEO, Yishan Wong... well it was all the ""wrong"" kind of lessons, because he too didn't have a clue what he was doing (again, as I have pointed out elsewhere in other comments, he was a fairly new, inexperienced first-time CEO, coming from technical team/project management {a different thing} but with virtually ZERO prior significant ""operational management"" experience in terms of ""running"" a stable business or even managing an office.  And much the same with Mr. Ohanian, who likewise has apparently never really served in any substantive ""executive"" role.  They were/are ALL essentially ""unqualified"" to be in the positions they were occupying... and in addition, their EGO's apparently got in the way of any of them being humble enough to seek out advisors/gain the education/hire & delegate to the right people so as to ""learn on the job"".    Now no doubt, there was some subtle ""maneuvering"" & varied personal & political agenda going on -- but each of these people was doubtless WELL AWARE of what they and the others were doing -- even if they were too arrogant & delusional & inexperienced to comprehend the indirect ""unintended consequence"" negatives of the behaviors & actions they were engaged in would have on the rest of the staff, the company culture, and the wider community."

subredditcancer,3d6381,willfe42,2,Mon Jul 13 22:33:30 2015 UTC,"It seems that the reddit cert is for *.reddit.com and reddit.com. I'm quite curious on why www.np.reddit.com is not allowed, but np.reddit.com is? Why doesn't that * wildcard include dots?"
subredditcancer,3d6381,kuuttis,3,Tue Jul 14 12:28:02 2015 UTC,"Blame the SSL certificate issuers. For various (somewhat boring) reasons, wildcart certificates can only cover one domain element in a domain name. You can have a certificate *.foo.com but it won't ever work for blah.bar.foo.com. For that, you need a certificate for *.bar.foo.com.  Now there's no technical reason whatsoever why certificate issuers can't simply issue subdomain wildcard certificates upon customer request (since they've already done the heavy lifting in terms of verifying the customer's identity) or do charge for doing so (since they've already been paid for a wildcard certificate covering the parent domain).  The reason they don't just provide this as part of a wildcart certificate purchase essentially boils down to two motivations: ""we don't have to, we don't want to, so we're not going to,"" and ""if you want a subdomain wildcard certificate, that's another certificate issuance, so pay us again!""  TL;DR: Wildcard certs are weird and cert issuers are greedy."

Everything I have heard about her paints the picture of someone clueless about both Reddit and the Internet who took the CEO job out of desperation.  It would be hilarious if she now turns around and sues Reddit for discrimination.
