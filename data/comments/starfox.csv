starfox,3domv6,Kinopravda23,7,Fri Jul 17 23:57:38 2015 UTC,"I love Starfox Adventures but you don't want to play it for the arwing sections of the game.  They feel tacked on because it's more of an adventure game.  You can't even charge homing lasers and they reduce it to collecting rings rather than having a high kill score. The graphics are gorgeous and it supports 16:9 widescreen ratio.  I recommend it.  Its a fun adventure game and very zelda-like.  Just not starfox-like but still awesome.  Starfox Assault is also really cool and is more like a sequel to starfox 64.  The only shame is there's only like 3 regular flying missions (the best part of the game and the true core of starfox gameplay), the rest is on foot missions which get tedious.  It depends what you're in the mood for but they are both fun games."
starfox,3domv6,sendhelp,2,Sat Jul 18 02:21:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's very informative. I'll probably start out with Assault but eventually get Adventures as well."
starfox,3domv6,TheCursedD20,3,Sat Jul 18 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"Assault for classic Star Fox having. Adventures was fun and its the story of how Krystal and Fox meet, but isn't the great. But I say get both in the end."
starfox,3domv6,nomonamesavailable,2,Sat Jul 18 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"The original concept for Adventures was called ""Dinosaur Planet"" when Nintendo acquired the rights they decided to shoehorn it into the Starfox universe.  It's not a bad game if you like adventure games.  I thought the arwing sections were awful, thankfully they are a very small part of the game.  Assault plays more like traditional Starfox games except some levels are on foot.  A lot of people criticize Assault for the clunky on foot missions.  Personally I loved assault.  The time spent flying is more than any of the previous games and I enjoyed the on-foot missions, although I do think there is room for improvement for the on-foot controls."
starfox,3domv6,xofr,2,Sat Jul 18 04:23:20 2015 UTC,Assault was better IMO. Better both gameplay and story wise.
starfox,3domv6,EHSaiblade,2,Sun Jul 19 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"Assault, Adventures isn't really a Star Fox game imo, just because of the feel, and how you actually play."
starfox,3domv6,DeutschPantherV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:29:05 2015 UTC,"Both are worth playing, but of the two I like Assault better as it is a better paced game. You spend a lot of time backtracking in Adventures, as rather than teleporting you places the game forces you to walk just about everywhere."
starfox,3domv6,BanzaitheBat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:32:23 2015 UTC,"Both are excellent games. Adventures is more like a Zelda-style puzzle adventure game while Assault is much more of the classic Starfox style, but both are highly recommended. Adventures was indeed made by Rare, one of the best developers of the 90s!"
starfox,3domv6,ohno_itsadragon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:46:23 2015 UTC,"I may be unpopular here in that I like Adventures WAY more, but it's certainly not what's considered a 'typical' Starfox game. Adventures plays more like Zelda, with puzzles and action in about equal measure."
starfox,3domv6,wreckingcanon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"Diehard star fox fans would probably prefer to start with assault but Adventures is arguably the better of the two overall.  Assault feels like an inferior version of the previous Star Fox games.  Only 3 on raise flying missions and basically every mission is a rehash of those from 64.  Environments are bland and the entire story feels like a cliche Japanese sci-fi series.    The worst part for me is that although Adventures is actually a different game that had star fox added late in development as well as bring rushed anf lots of original content removed, the whose game feels more solid with better grapgics, awesome original music, diverse and interesting environments,  and solid though simplified zeldaesque gameplay.  To top it all off the arming sections in Adventures, though shoehorned and short feels better control than Assault since the arming in the latter is slow and bulky-feeling."

starfox,3dk5j7,ylitvinenko,2,Fri Jul 17 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and there's apparently a sound technique employed where the speakers direct the sound to your right ear, emulating the effect of Fox's single ear-piece headset.  To quote the words of someone else, you can ""hear Slippy whisper in your ear."""
starfox,3dk5j7,Numero5,2,Fri Jul 17 14:46:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, asynchronous sound is one of my favorite Wii U features... even with Slippy. So I'm glad Nintendo does this sort of thing."

starfox,3djsjv,BanzaitheBat,3,Thu Jul 16 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"I loved Assault Multiplayer as a casual multiplayer shooter, but I can't really imagine it as is being competitive. One thing that bugged me about Multiplayer in Assualt was how massive the maps are, yet there's only the possibility of four people playing at the same time, on a map that could fit, I don't know, 32. There'd need to be some modding, to rearrange character and weapon spawn points, and there'd need to be balance between pilots and vehicles. I could definitely get behind a PC Mod (in terms of funding. I have close to zero programming skills).  Also Wolf is OP."
starfox,3djsjv,1994bmw,3,Thu Jul 16 22:41:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wolf is stupidly OP. He's completely banned in our meta, haha! Another thing is that vehicles are banned too, which might turn off a lot of people, but like you say without any sort of mod they're just too imbalanced in favour of the pilots."
starfox,3djsjv,The_Masked_Lurker,2,Thu Jul 16 23:18:17 2015 UTC,Another thing is that vehicles are banned too   No vehichles in a game about vehicles? That is like smash with no smashes!

starfox,3d2ztw,Tidbits1192,5,Mon Jul 13 02:54:43 2015 UTC,"A few things wrong with this:  -Fox greatly matured between 64 and Assault. That doesn't have to do with a mental condition, that's just how life is.  -Fox didn't want a quiet life in Adventures, he was quite desparate for some action (and money). He was clearly excited when Pepper contacted him with a mission before he even heard what the mission was. And when he did land in Thorntail Hollow, recall the following exchange between Fox and Pepper during their briefing:  Fox - ""But what about a weapon? Why couldn't I bring my blaster?""  Pepper - ""It's always the same with you Fox! Shoot first, ask questions later! This mission is about saving the planet, not blowing it up! It requires a different tactic. Try using your head for once!""  This very clearly implies that Fox normally is one to go head first into action without a second thought.  -Adventures takes place seven years after 64, but that doesn't mean Fox never had any action in that time. For one, there is the manga comic ""Farewell, Beloved Falco"", which takes place between 64 and Adventures. Fox is in this and he does get engaged in some conflict, including between him and Falco. Who knows what else he did in seven years.  -Fox does joke around with his wing mates in Assault. Not as much, but that can be attributed to how dire the situation was with the Aparoids (needing to team up with old enemies, old characters dying or nearly dying, etc). There were a few points where he cracked a joke or cracked a smile. His humour was also a bit more of the ""deadpan snarker"" variety, almost like Falco, as opposed to the corny comments kind. For example, in mission 2:  Falco - ""Let me know if ya get lonely and I'll drop by to say hello.""  Fox - ""Naaaaaah, all I need is the Landmaster!""  That quote is also another instance of Fox's trigger happy attitude.  I understand wanting to apply theories to favourite franchises (Star Fox multi-timeline guy here :P), and there is even a Nintendo character I believe has PTSD (Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy - she definitely had it as a child anyway), but I think you missed a few important points here."
starfox,3d2ztw,sonicbrawler182,2,Tue Jul 14 15:20:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the critique! I knew my assessment wasn't perfect, so I'm glad someone was able out point out its flaws.  I'm really curious to see what they do in Star Fox Zero with the cast. Hopefully that'll clarify some things."
starfox,3d2ztw,sonicbrawler182,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"I'm just hoping it isn't a complete reboot or retelling of Star Fox 64. I would like some progression in the series, even if it goes on from the Star Fox 64 bad ending."
starfox,3d2ztw,The_Robot_Doctor_Man,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"I had my doubts when I started reading this but you make a really convincing argument. My only argument would be that I felt Fox was still a little serious in 64 but I found an interesting quote on the wiki that might support your theory:  ""As the only survivor of the original Star Fox Team, Peppy insisted that the young Fox take on the leadership of the group and form a new team of pilots. Thrust into the leadership role that he wasn't prepared for, Fox recruited the hot-tempered Falco Lombardi and the mechanical genius Slippy Toad to make up the new Star Fox Team.""   Peppy insisted  The leadership role he wasn't prepared for   This probably explains why Fox is somewhat serious in 64 but still jokes as he still learning to handle his new responsibilities. I guess by the time Assault comes around he'd suffered so much trauma that he lost his sense of humor."

Honestly if Fox, Peppy, Bill and Falco just took a vacation Lylat would basically be space-France! (jk France jk)"

starfox,3d0sjh,wreckingcanon,2,Sun Jul 12 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"Arwings fly using g-diffusion, which as a physics major I can tell you is a complete mockery of physical law as we know it.... That being said, in the real world in atmo? Probably the 64 version in all range mode. It looks sort of like a canard type design, snes could maybe work as well. As an extension to 64 I wouldn't be surprised if adventure's arwing would be ok.  Now in story?  64 flew through natural warps in space, and bounced off the surface of a star.....  Snes went through a black hole like nothing, and also did some travel interdimensionally.....  Those are epic feats"
starfox,3d0sjh,The_Masked_Lurker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:11:33 2015 UTC,"So I assume that the lack of talk on the Assault ship indicates a low opinion on it.  From my research, only the SNES & 64 ships actually had blueprints or an inside look on the different components of the ship"
starfox,3d0sjh,The_Masked_Lurker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:27:01 2015 UTC,"based on my memories of watching it... The wings seemed farther back than the others, arwing wings are already a bit far back for my likings for real world thoughts.... A;so wing/fuselage ratio looked bad and the fuse looked to fat to me  For in game feats, well it went through a warp gate..... That doesn't speak of awesomeness like natural space warps or black holes. Peppy did catch a flagship with one I guess that is an ok feat, except I think it needed repairs afterward which is lame compared to bouncing off of a sun."
starfox,3d0sjh,TheNineFiveSeven,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:42:39 2015 UTC,I'd say the one from 64 since it resembles a plane the most out of the rest. Assault's arwing looks like it wouldn't even fly due the shape and size. Adventure's arwing looks just plain un-flyable because of the nose.
starfox,3d0sjh,Drovious17,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:32:36 2015 UTC,I think that the SNES ship is the best and the one from assault is by fat the worst design.  The 64 and adventures ship I'm indifferent towards but the g-diffuser still looks a bit too large to be aerodynamic
starfox,3d0sjh,redditisforfags8D,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"i'm more partial to say 64's maybe Command's designs would be the only one's that would function in an atmospheric zone. mostly because assault's, adventure's and the snes has very thin wings that are really far back from the body where i'd imagin the center of lift would be behind the center of gravity causing it to rotate in flight. although an assumption could be made that the center of thrust could be below the center of gravity causing it to counter the center of lift rotation.  the assault, adventures, snes arwings seem to be a bit thin and could have a potential to fail (break) when enough force is acting on it. this is actually the only thing that i would make an argument for when it comes to space, since there is no frictional force, if you rotate the ship fast enough, (or barrel roll) creating enough force on the wings could cause them to break at those thin joints."
