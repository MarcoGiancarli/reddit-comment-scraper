hockeycirclejerk,3dwa69,plastictf,2,Mon Jul 20 01:44:15 2015 UTC,Haha John Scott isn't good at hockey. OP cracks me up every time!
hockeycirclejerk,3dwa69,Pilarious,2,Mon Jul 20 04:42:19 2015 UTC,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about John Scott, you dirty QC? I’ll have you know John Scott is the top grinder in the NHL, with over 1500 fights won, and a hattrick across the course of last season. He is well practiced in beating the shit out of the greaseball stupid enough to try to take him down, and is known as ""The Original Gene Sniping Kid"". You are nothing to him but just another greaseball. He will wipe you the fuck out with brutality the likes of which has never been seen before in the NHL, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to him over the Internet? Think again, hoser. As we speak I am contacting John Scott himself to inform him of your ""clever"" chirp, and within moments he will have a team of cult members outside your basement, awaiting his arrival so that they can watch him end your pathetic little life. You’re fucking dead, plug. He can be anywhere, anytime, and he can kill you in over seven thousand ways, and that’s just with his 6'6"" 110 flex CCM Tacks hockey stick. Not only is he extensively trained in all forms of combat, but he has access to the entire stockpile of Fresh Wave™ products and he will use their full odor eliminating power to wipe your greasy ass off the face of the continent, you filthy piece of shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” chirp was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you fucking scrub. John Scott will shit gene juice all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, bud."

hockeycirclejerk,3do074,ghostfan9,5,Fri Jul 17 20:49:18 2015 UTC,Just think that he's gonna be playing with Crosby or Malkin. He scored 37 goals with Bozak as his center so he will probably get 95-100 goals give or take a few.  Edit: Forgot about John Scott. The greatest goal scorer in national hockey league history.
