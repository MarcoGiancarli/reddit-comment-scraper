wec,3di0ir,Bakkster,15,Thu Jul 16 12:57:41 2015 UTC,They should just go race.   We know what happened last time they skipped races over testing...   something something dead last at Le Mans
wec,3di0ir,TheFakeJerrySeinfeld,10,Thu Jul 16 13:02:51 2015 UTC,"But it's impossible to say if they would have developed the car more by testing in Bowling Green, or by racing at Silverstone.  Just because they were slow doesn't mean that skipping hurt them."
wec,3di0ir,vorin,3,Thu Jul 16 13:35:40 2015 UTC,"Technically, they finished ahead of the ByKolles car, which was excluded...  It did make a lot more sense to test rather than race early in the season, because that set the homologation for the year (and they didn't have a crash tested monocoque yet, either). However, with the main base being in the states, racing in Germany loses them valuable test and development time, far more than just a weekend.   I'd expect they'd need to find something really bad (Audi-esque aero pogo, or still unable to touch kerbs) to skip the race, though."
wec,3di0ir,ueno59,2,Thu Jul 16 13:08:30 2015 UTC,I'm doubtful they could find anything to solve their problem considering the car has been homologated.
wec,3di0ir,F166,4,Thu Jul 16 14:07:08 2015 UTC,"Of course they can, the car is seriously losing out on the brakes, and can't take curbs due to the suspension. On top of that they have the special tire construction coming from Michelin  Fix all these and they have the potential to find a lot of time.  They're not going to be challenging at the front even if they do this, but it'll be valuable info for when the car is [hopefully] introduced with the 8MJ system next season."
wec,3di0ir,ueno59,2,Thu Jul 16 14:18:57 2015 UTC,"They're not going to be challenging at the front   That's my main cause of concern, they could skip the end of the season to cut on the cost and focus their effort and money on next season car. They had to come at Le Mans to get data they could not get otherwise but why travel the world if you cannot compete ?"
wec,3di0ir,ueno59,4,Thu Jul 16 14:29:38 2015 UTC,"They had to come at Le Mans to get data they could not get otherwise but why travel the world if you cannot compete ?

wec,3di0ir,Viscerous_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:16:08 2015 UTC,There's a least hope they can play with the kerbs but there's not much hope for the brakes if they cannot get the hybrid system working.

Jokes aside, testing is something they need to do a lot more of, but they also need to run some races because you'll develop issues you otherwise wouldn't have. They need to accept that it'll likely be slower than P2 though. Never develop a car in public, especially if you're a marketing driven company."
wec,3di0ir,elduderino88,13,Thu Jul 16 13:03:16 2015 UTC,"the amazing thing is that they have been what is a racing failure into a marketing success. The wec community is relatively small and the average person doesn't know where nissan finished in our biggest race of the season. I have friends not  into racing, but they have seen the nissan lmp1 and know its some kind of radical prototype nissan made. lots of people just think nissan has made a car completely different from what other people have, which is entirely true."
wec,3di0ir,thyusername,2,Thu Jul 16 13:52:58 2015 UTC,At least they have that going for them. Even if it's a failure it was still an attempt at radical innovation and it's good to see that people are supportive of it in the first year. Now for the next years I'd love to see them flesh it out and actually make it a worthwhile racecar rather than a degraded LMP2 with a LMP1 sticker.
wec,3di0ir,thyusername,3,Thu Jul 16 14:42:05 2015 UTC,"i feel like when they get the rear wheel hybrid working, a lot of stuff will start falling into place. sounds like they are heavily limited by front grip at the moment. I can't speak for everyone, but even seeing them disappoint in many ways this year, I still appreciate that there is something new in lmp1 and I would like to see them be competitive."
wec,3di0ir,Porsche_Curves,4,Thu Jul 16 15:39:11 2015 UTC,"Are you one of the guys on SC360 also putting Mazda on blast for their performance with the SKYACTIV-D along the ""it's terrible marketing"" lines?  Because to echo jalepeno... it's simply not.  Per Mazda, people might not understand what the SKYACTIV technology suite is fully, but they DO associate the term with positive ideas of fuel economy and other highly desirable road-going car features.  The majority don't care ( but are impressed ) when the P2 car runs within 3 seconds of out and out racing engines with a 1/2-stock Mazda 6 block.  But more importantly, anyone that sees the car gets blasted with SKYACTIV as a term, and it goes into the subconscious.  Fuel efficiency, fuel efficiency, nice road cars, fuel efficiency.  And so it will go with Nissan.  The SuperBowl commercial said ""Hey this radical new car is coming, how cool is that!""and oh by the way here's a sneak peek at our 2016 Altima.   In fact, if anything, any damage was done when idiots didn't understand how they used the song ""Cats in the Cradle"" to spin a positive message.  That alone should tell you all you need to know about the average intelligence of the American public to think that their radical development car being slow in a race in Europe is doing any sort of brand damage.  Then people were talking and the marketing takes off from there.  The vast majority don't even understand multi-class racing, let alone LeMans."
wec,3di0ir,thyusername,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:09:41 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really commenting on their road cars there, because you'd have to be very uninterested in cars to buy something from the majority of Nissan's lineup. I'm talking about the motorsport enthusiasts who have a good idea about the cars and how they work. Marketing wise that's a cockup, like it was for Aston with their AMR-One in 2011.  I doubt it'll make any difference to the road car sales, mainly because I'm not convinced that someone that would willingly buy a Micra or a Juke would even know that the prototype in their advertising is actually a real race car. Same goes for Mazda, most of their sales aren't going to be influenced by a racing program, mainly because the people that buy those cars aren't interested in them, nor will they be interested in motorsport. It does however sound good in marketing blurb when you say that you ran in the top class at the Daytona 24h or at Le Mans."
wec,3di0ir,richie_engineer,3,Thu Jul 16 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's fair to either set of road cars. Mazda especially, particularly with the Miata being an enthusiast favorite (though the MazdaSpeed versions of their cars are peppy as well, I got quite the ride-along in a Speed 3 at Baltimore). Nissan's performance cars might be most focused in the sports car end of the range, but that's not to say their beginning range don't make for solid touring cars. The one Juke owner I know (purchased as a second car to his pickup truck because it's the only city car he fits in comfortably) is aware of the racing program."

wec,3di0ir,jonthedoors,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:58:26 2015 UTC,"I think for sure it was. Their primary goal being to get a hybrid system in at a specific weight, at the 8mj class, that was capable of harvesting in braking only, from the front only, at 8mj, without the need for secondary harvesting from the rear, or an MGU-H unit. Which was on of the primary design goals with the heavy forward weight bias, purely to feed the ToroTrak unit.  Given the size and weight of the accumulator unit, I would think you could fit a couple of motors, and a battery pack into the same space. And that would alleviate all of their issues with the complex clutch systems, and reliability troubles, because everything is a proven quantity."

This is a real draw of the sportscar culture. People congratulating each other, staying positive, knowing what they're in it for. It's so non-dramatic."
wec,3dde8a,Skrimyt,4,Wed Jul 15 15:03:55 2015 UTC,"Based on their performance this year, I think they may have slipped under the radar well enough that the regulations may still work in their favor post 2016.  Remember the origin of the concept was a kind of workround of the limitations on rear aero.  I think they may have held off on committing to beyond 2016 based on whether the ACO would close the box in on them.  And yes, the fact that Dr. Ulrich and some of the guys from the Audi pit crew walked to the Porsche garage and congratulated them with 10 minutes left in the race is exactly the kind of classy sportsmanship that makes this my favorite form of racing."
wec,3dde8a,MrDisco99,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"Depends if the work Audi and Porsche have been doing with their front aero are also piquing the interest of the ACO, and/or if the ACO plans to be proactive in closing the loophole."
wec,3dde8a,ALOIsFasterThanYou,5,Wed Jul 15 22:09:32 2015 UTC,Interesting that Porsche is talking to Nissan about fan outreach! Hopefully they can work together to further raise the WEC's popularity.
wec,3dde8a,MC_Dickie,-1,Thu Jul 16 04:08:11 2015 UTC,"Yea because Porsche were obviously asking, how can you possibly sell people on this shit design and get so much hype from something so impotent?"
wec,3dde8a,ron_cpt89,2,Thu Jul 16 21:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. In the interview, Darren Cox mentions during the first answer, the following...   We had the project green-lit three months before Le Mans, which is probably the shortest-ever turnaround from blank piece of paper to being on track with a completely new concept.   But they had a press conference last year (23 May 2014) to announce their 2015 Le Mans LMP1 program, and Nissan's former Chief Planning Officer & Executive Vice-President at the time Andy Palmer also made the following statements during the announcement...   “You don’t go to Le Mans to just turn up”    “The brief to the team is to go with something different, go with something that brings new technology which is transferable to the road car technology and an approach that is innovative and exciting and of course, go to win.""   So did Nissan completely scrap all their planning they had before 2015, and redesign the car from scratch? Is Darren Cox lying? Or was it a slip up, and he mistakenly said they had ""three months"" to create a car from scratch?"
wec,3dde8a,herpalurp,2,Wed Jul 15 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"Cox clarified on the MWMLC that he meant 3 months before Le Mans 2014. That means green light March 2014, announcement May 2014, public unveiling February 2015.  That's still just a 15 month turnaround, which sounds like a long time but isn't for a clean sheet design. That's roughly in line with what the AMR-One had (they started in 'early 2010' for Le Mans in 2011), and both debuted equally off the pace at Le Mans (though the Nissan was literally 100x more reliable)."
wec,3dde8a,herpalurp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:32 2015 UTC,both debuted equally off the pace at Le Mans   The Nissans where at least quicker than the P2 field even after all the compromises they had to make to get it on the track.
wec,3dde8a,herpalurp,2,Wed Jul 15 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"The P2 field was closer to the P1 field in 2011 (+15.720 vs +21.145), but both the Nissan and AMR qualified 20.xxx seconds off the pole."
wec,3dde8a,ron_cpt89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:43:17 2015 UTC,I don't really see your point.  It looks really bad to be in P1 and be out qualified by more than half the P2 field at Le Mans.
wec,3dde8a,joetron2030,5,Wed Jul 15 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"The point being that the comparison should be to the pole setting car in class, rather than the secondary class whose gap to P1 has changed.  Both were off pace, but the Nissan lasted far more laps and (more importantly) plan to race again soon to continue their development."
wec,3dde8a,joetron2030,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, those two splits are the same, but the context is very different and I don't think you can draw conclusions or anything meaningful from it.  The only reason the Nissan was ~20 seconds down was because the top P1 teams were out of control this year.  P1 pole had been decreasing by ~1 second per year from 2011 to 2014.  That jumped off the charts to almost 5 seconds this year.  Contextually the Nissan's pace is light years ahead of what the AMR-One showed."
wec,3dde8a,Porsche_Curves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing that up, and finishing a 24 hour race is impressive, regardless if you finish dead last, or challenging for the win upfront. And Nissan is trying something new, designing a front wheel drive car, when everybody else are either rear wheel drive, or AWD tried and tested LMP1's.   Porsche announced their plans to return to LPM1 back in 2012, and it took them 3 years to win it, it might take Nissan even longer, but from announcement, to finishing their first full 24 hour race a year later, they certainly got my attention moving forward."
wec,3dde8a,F166,3,Wed Jul 15 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"Just as impressive, to me, is having the will to come back and race again. Aston Martin ran 6 laps total, then never turned a wheel in public again. Nissan's at least giving it the old college try, which I find admirable even if it ends up not working."
wec,3dde8a,Porsche_Curves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:17 2015 UTC,"Bummer that the rear KERS won't be ready until next year, though. Was that always the plan?"
wec,3dde8a,F166,3,Wed Jul 15 15:14:50 2015 UTC,"Last year, the plan was to have the rear ERS this year. They had to homologate the hybrid system before the first race, though, that's not an area for mid-season development. So once they downsized to the 2MJ front-only system to try and get the underperforming system reliable, they were stuck with it throughout the rest of 2015."
wec,3dde8a,Porsche_Curves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:26:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I was wondering if it was planned or got pushed back due to other issues related to the program's development.
wec,3dde8a,Porsche_Curves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:25 2015 UTC,The reason they aren't running it this year is due to the rear system weighing above spec and not producing enough power. Looks like they will have to redesign it.

wec,3d9ysi,R18_e_tron,5,Tue Jul 14 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"Then that answers it. When Montoya says he's open to racing in Le Mans for the triple crown, he's after a seat on a P1 team."

Today we’re at 900 kg. We can’t go to LMP1-L with the same car as that should be 800 kg.""

Edit: Turns out the Blue Angels don't wear pressure suits because they rest their arm on their legs as they fly, as their control stick is between their legs. They don't want their pressure suit inflating during close maneuvers, as that could move their arm, and this the stick. The Thunderbirds fly F-16, which have the control stick on the side, so g suits are no big deal."

wec,3cw8sc,Bakkster,7,Sat Jul 11 14:50:45 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain to me what the fuck do they want to do with the prototypes? By they, ACO and FIA. Because at this pace, it will be LMP1 and GTE-Pro with only factory entries. Why are they killing LMP2, why."
wec,3cw8sc,mppalmares,13,Sat Jul 11 10:29:32 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the point. LMP1 and GTE-Pro is meant to be the manufacturer playground: A place for the top manufacturers in the world to put their best technologies (LMP1) or road vehicles (GTE-Pro) against each other.  They've changed LMP2 to be more of a spec-like series to make it more accessible for privateer teams to be racing similar componentry against each other. It's meant to be a customer series. The idea was to move the one-off makes (like the Strakka Dome) and other groups that don't have a production focus into LMP1. It's probably come at the wrong time with such strength in LMP2 that it has at the moment, but you can already see that it's doing it's job with Strakka moving up to LMP1-L and BR engineering (who provide SMP's machinery) are expecting to announce that they're moving to LMP1-L too  So, to sum it all up; LMP1-H -> Manufacturers LMP1-L -> Privateer prototypes LMP2 -> Customer prototypes"
wec,3cw8sc,Floodman11,5,Sat Jul 11 12:03:54 2015 UTC,"But that's the point, LMP1-L right now is pointless. You associate LMP1 to manufacturers and new hybrid solutions. LMP1-L is just those teams that have been around for a while, but just stagnate, and the regulations are changed each year to make them close to the hybrids. Changing LMP2 to force some companies to move to LMP1-L to be in the shadow of the hybrids doesn't make sense ( I know, it's not the main objective but it will be one of the consequences). LMP2 it's already a spec-series, and it's not very expensive. Why change what is good?"
wec,3cw8sc,mppalmares,5,Sat Jul 11 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"LMP1-L right now is pointless   With ByKolles and Rebellion the only contenders, you're right. But, introduce Strakka, BR engineering, maybe another team, and you've got the start of a decent battle class. And I'm sure rebellion would welcome the competition.  Remember, the need for LMP2 changes was due to only 4 full season entries last year. What's happened is that the ACO has persisted with bringing in new regs to combat an issue that was more prevalent last year. It's a shame that they've done that, to be honest.  What's most likely to happen is that LMP1-L will become what LMP2 is now, and LMP2 will become a customer team driven psuedo-spec class"

wec,3cw8sc,Floodman11,2,Sat Jul 11 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"No, one class. The separate podium is for the top privateer entry, which could still go to a LMP1-H. Imagine if one of the privateer teams bought an off the shelf hybrid system, like Dyson tried in the ALMS.  Remember, you have to pay a bunch of money to enter as a ""manufacturer"" and be eligible for the World Championship."

wec,3cw8sc,Floodman11,0,Sun Jul 12 03:02:35 2015 UTC,"LMP3 was meant to be a not-so-spec replacement for LMPC, which it has done in ELMS, and is currently being campaigned in TUSC"
wec,3cw8sc,MrDisco99,3,Mon Jul 13 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"I will say, having a potentially factory backed GTE program (hopefully they can get compliant, although this will be an example of what the future holds for manufacturers with hybrid supercars that want to race them) that will probably bid to go to Le Mans is fantastic.   It is awful to see another LMP2 manufacturer get shelved, but as the richest of the P2 manufacturers, its good to see they will stick around and even head to a much more competitive class (in terms of backing and funding)."

There is no run off         No run off can be put in due to a major road built next to it It's a completely blind with the wall and stadium on the inside  You can't move the corner without taking down the whole stadium The stadium provides lots of extra seating for spectators   The fact that CART, a series which ran on ovals, used the chicane through the stadium says something."
wec,3ckctg,zantkiller,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:16:22 2015 UTC,"Ovals don't have run off, stick some safer barrier in there and It'd be fine. Best corner on the circuit gone."
wec,3ckctg,Shart_McFoop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:37:54 2015 UTC,And a series which runs on ovals didn't use it out of concerns.  No oval has walls right on the track edge on both the inside and outside. Having them on the inside means that you have no view of the mid corner or a space for a car which has stopped to get off banking.  Check the onboards from the old circuit there was no wall on the outside or inside and as such it was a much less daunting and scary corner than it is now.  And in the end neither F1 or WEC runs on ovals and are designed for an oval style crash with the safer barrier and catch fence. Given how well F1 and LMP1 cars now accelerate they will be entering the corner even faster than they used to.  It just wasn't realistic that the corner would come back.

wec,3ckctg,LKincheloe,2,Thu Jul 9 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"Even at Martinsville there is one car wide strip separating the wall from the track.  At Hermanos Rodriguez there is no gap. In fact it is actually worse. On the inside of the Peraltada is the pitlane entrance which runs the whole 180° and is separated from the track by a thin white line.  So it goes track, white line, pitlane entrance, wall.  In terms of ovals to compare it to I believe it is about the same size as one of the corners at Dover but less wide and obviously less banked. The difference is that they will be reaching the corner much, much faster."

You have five engines a season if i'm correct. so i would personally use my engines something like this  1: spa and silverstone  2: Le mans  3: Nurburgring and COTA  4: Fuji and shanghai  5: Bahrein  you could switch some engines earlier our later if the track demands more power but this should be pretty basic.
wec,3cbq3f,MrDisco99,7,Mon Jul 6 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"The wording is a bit ambiguous, but I think they used one engine at Silverstone and Spa and a second engine for all sessions at Le Mans.  However, because of the seal problem it's now counted as their second, third, and fourth.  This really weighs that team down for the rest of the season.  They'll have to save the remaining engine as much as they can, or deal with penalties with lots of rounds remaining."
wec,3cbq3f,Eroda,2,Mon Jul 6 19:34:16 2015 UTC,is the penalty for a Sixth for the first race its used at or at every race its used at for me sixth @ Shanghai take the penalty  run it lowish then hope to get lucky at bahrain
wec,3cbq3f,Warcrowe,2,Tue Jul 7 03:44:15 2015 UTC,That would make a lot more sense. Still that is a huge mistake for such an experienced team. I can't remember a F1 team making the same mistakes with this (and they use this system for their seventh year)
wec,3cbq3f,richie_engineer,2,Mon Jul 6 19:44:01 2015 UTC,"Not as a mistake, but at the 2012 COTA race Ferrari intentionally broke the seal on Massa's gearbox to give him a 5 grid place penalty.   http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2012/11/on-ferraris-tactical-gearbox-penalty/"
wec,3cbq3f,Skrimyt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:17:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, they mentioned in the article about looking into using the Spa/Silverstone engine for another round. Then they'd only have to do 4 on the new engine."
wec,3cbq3f,fractal1382,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:49:40 2015 UTC,"Tough but fair. If the ACO/FIA cant be confident that the engines were not tampered with, then this is the only option and the explanation of the penalty is satisfactory for me.   Not saying that Audi cheated or were even attempting to cheat, but rules are rules. This reminds me of what happened with the #45 Flying Lizard car at Mosport couple of years ago. One of the seals on the engine restrictor air box failed or came loose due to contact in the race. Even though post race tech agreed that it did not give them any additional performance, they were stripped of their win.  I dont think this is that big a deal for Audi. If one engine can survive practice, qualy, and the race at Lemans, thats 36 hours in total including one non stop 24 hour run, then I think it should be able to handle the rest of the WEC season. Plus they have their other engines to fall back on.  Just my opinion ;)"
wec,3cbq3f,MJDiAmore,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:23:34 2015 UTC,"I'd think the way forward from here would be rebuilding the Spa/Silverstone engine right now, the new one for 'Ring and COTA to make sure they don't run afoul of the penalties until as late as possible.  Try to solidify championship positioning ahead of the last races so that if you have to take a penalty in Bahrain, so be it.  That said, I feel like 2 additional engines is a pretty harsh penalty.  I'd have thought 1 would be sufficient.  (As in counting the LeMans engine as their 2nd and 3rd engines)."
wec,3cbq3f,wirelessflyingcord,3,Mon Jul 6 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"That said, I feel like 2 additional engines is a pretty harsh penalty. I'd have thought 1 would be sufficient. (As in counting the LeMans engine as their 2nd and 3rd engines).   I read it as... not a penalty per se (the penalty is the fine) but since they couldn't check the seals, thay have to ""assume"" that every sessions used a new one, despite that no one thinks this was deliberate cheating, but rules are rules."
wec,3cbq3f,This_Explains_A_Lot,2,Tue Jul 7 02:59:28 2015 UTC,I am a Porsche supporter when it comes to LMP1. But i feel like this was poorly handled. As i read it the FIA knew about the seal issue in every session but decided to work out the penalty at a later date. If they had thrown up a flag the first time they noticed the issue in practice then Audi could have done something about it. Not knowing all the details i dont know if this is the case but that is how i read it.
wec,3cbq3f,CC440,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:30:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think rebuilds (in the traditional sense) are an option due to the seals. You can't replace internals without breaking them. F1 teams ""rebuild"" their engines with powerful solvents to remove carbon buildup and thorough fluid flushes to remove any deposits of metal left behind due to wear, I'm sure WEC teams do something similar."
wec,3cbq3f,ImAzura,0,Tue Jul 7 13:49:05 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't something unexpected be surprising, and vice versa?"
wec,3ccj8y,FatalMistake465,6,Mon Jul 6 21:11:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the five constructor limit, and definitely not a fan of the price hike and weight increase."
wec,3ccj8y,iracecars,3,Tue Jul 7 13:14:52 2015 UTC,Why only four in P2 then? P2 constructors also shouldn't be eligible for P3.
wec,3ccj8y,TBurd01,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:30:20 2015 UTC,"because the decision for a limit has been made just now for LMP 3 and there are already 4 chassis builders homologating (with the ginetta fully homologated). So it's a beat cheap to say ""sorry we already have 4 have a nice day"" to those manufacturers stil working on a chassis. so they open a last spot first-come, first-serve with an time limit to come forward before the end of august. This whole rule is just a after thought most likely because of the chassis limit for LMP 2 backlash"
wec,3ccj8y,Warcrowe,2,Tue Jul 7 10:51:08 2015 UTC,"They did the exact same thing with P2...  I'm still wondering why they are allowing P2 manufacturers to build P3s (You know Ligier be in P2, Ginetta and Riley probably). Oreca got the engine distribution/service deal, you know they're going to be in P2."
wec,3ccj8y,TBurd01,2,Tue Jul 7 19:45:16 2015 UTC,because french chauvinism. it's truly as simple as that. don't think to much into it
wec,3ccj8y,Warcrowe,2,Tue Jul 7 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand what the ACO is trying to accomplish with the new rules for the lower prototype classes. GTE has always been about creating a balanced class whose winner is determined more by the proficiency of the drivers and mechanics than by the engineers designing the cars. P2 had filled the role of being simply a cheaper P1 class. Innovation was still prevalent, and while having a good team running the show was still crucial to any success, the role of manufacturer/team relations were just as important. With the new regs, P2 will likely become a one sided championship where innovation becomes nearly impossible due to the cost cap, and the victor will be determined by whoever is lucky enough to buy the right chassis. If I could have it my way, I would simply allow any manfacturer to produce an engine and keep the chassis number down to 4."
wec,3ccj8y,moostream,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"I just don't get the combination of introducing LMP3 with turning LMP2 into a mostly spec class. In the absence of LMP3, I guess it could make some sense, though I'd still be against it, but LMP3 should be the only spec prototype class and LMP2 should be wide open.  Failing that, the least they could've done was leave engine suppliers open, or at least allowed 3-5 engine suppliers to mirror the chassis options."
wec,3ccj8y,derekson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:34:15 2015 UTC,"The engine regs in lmp2 kill me. While high rpm na engines aren't super applicable to research, it was a good marketing ground and offered manufacturers more flexibility in regards to racing budgets. I would MUCH rather see a single chassis and many different engines."

wec,3bvjte,ceebee91,6,Thu Jul 2 14:31:39 2015 UTC,"Teams can choose between 2MJ, 4MJ, 6MJ and 8MJ which means the maximum release per lap, the system itself doesn't need to output that much all at once. The higher you choose, the less fuel per lap you get (in principle they're supposed to be all equal choices, but in reality they aren't, higher is better).  I think this table really explains it in a better way than words: http://www.24h-lemans.com/wpphpFichiers/1/1/ressources/Pdf/2015/24-heures-du-mans/regulations/2015-technical-regulations-lm-p1.pdf#page=52 (p. 52)"
wec,3bvjte,wirelessflyingcord,2,Thu Jul 2 16:55:27 2015 UTC,Only want to add to this that there is a no hybrid class aimed at smaller private teams as rebellion and bykolles. Those are a lot cheaper to build than hybrids but are also a few seconds a lap slower (our should be)
wec,3bvjte,Warcrowe,2,Thu Jul 2 17:05:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, the no hybrid privateers should be equal to the hybrid factory teams - they get more petrol energy to account for the recovered energy used by the hybrids.  In actuality, they are slower because of HOW the hybrids use the energy - quick out of the corners."
wec,3bvjte,richie_engineer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:38:04 2015 UTC,Yeah but i have faith that the people who made the regulation are at least knowledgeable about how to use power efficient. so i think they already knew that the hybrids would be a lot quicker

wec,3bvjte,F166,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:42:33 2015 UTC,It's hard to harvest at Le Mans because it's around 80% full throttle per lap. To recharge the batteries/SC/flywheel etc you need the heavy braking areas
wec,3bvjte,Floodman11,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:30:22 2015 UTC,"That's why Porsche has two Systems. They can even harvest Energy when they are hard on throttle and not just in the breaking zones.

wec,3bvjte,air8orne,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:07:28 2015 UTC,Higher is better because you keep the save fuel tank capacity and therefore should be able to go farther.

wec,3bvjte,wirelessflyingcord,3,Fri Jul 3 15:28:15 2015 UTC,I far from being an expert but it seemed to me that the advantage was created to push manufacturer to go into the higher category. You take more risk by going higher. Audi was able to win Le Mans with they flywheel disconnected. In 8mj if you break the hybrid that's over.
