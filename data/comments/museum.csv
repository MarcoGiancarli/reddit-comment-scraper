museum,3e1xp6,WandererAboveFog,2,Tue Jul 21 09:28:54 2015 UTC,"Delacroix was born near Paris but grown up in The Hague where his father was Ministre Plénipotentiaire. He first trained with Pierre Guérin (1774-1833) and then entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1816. He soon specialised in history and religious paintings while recognition from the public started with his debut at the Salon in 1822, which immediately heralded him as a major figure of the French school.  This painting depicts a scene from the Gospels, which tells the story of a Samaritan having compassion for a wounded traveller. The man from Samaria puts the stranded traveller on his horse. Other passers-by had let the robbed man lay on the road - even though they were supposed to be more pious than the Samaritan.  Delacroix here painted the figures as if he were Rubens: muscular and colourful. His own fast brushstroke can easily be recognized."

museum,3dn31l,beingandnothingness,7,Fri Jul 17 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"After her remarriage to Diego Rivera in December of 1940, Frida's life settled into a somewhat calmer routine. Although remarried, they led separate lives. It was the ordinary things of life; animals, children, flowers and the countryside that most interested her. In many of her self-portraits during this period Frida began to include her beloved pets. This is one of Frida's many self-portraits in which she included her parrots. Although this portrait was painted shortly after Frida and Diego remarried, it was painted during her love affair with Nickolas Muray, a successful portrait photographer in New York. It was Muray who helped Frida, whom he had already met in Mexico, prepare for her first exhibition in New York in 1938.  The painting shown above is the final version of this self-portrait… This photo shows the original painting. Notice how the neckline of the blouse has changed. Also, it seems unusual that this painting wasn't titled ""Self-Portrait with Parrots"" since she used the word ""Self-Portrait"" so often in her titles.1"

He lived there for the rest of his life when he finally bought it in 1890. Scenes like this – of beautiful and inspirational places around Giverny – actually became less common in his work after he bought the house, because he found a new obsession in building and painting his own gardens.  The rare sight of the poplar trees in full flower inspired this painting. The flickering petals of the blossoms, painted with a dabbing stroke in pale pigment, sparkle in the sun. Monet's light and subtle touch is in perfect accord with this fleeting, natural spectacle. Just a few years later, Claude Monet would begin construction on the water garden at his own Giverny estate."

For his artistic accomplishments, he was elevated to European nobility in 1909 and was given royal status by three separate European governments. He is also listed in all the major art references, such as “Who Was Who in American Art.” He was offered painting professorships at the Chicago Art Institute and the art academies in Berlin, Weimar and Munich, but eventually became the director of the Royal Academy of Art in Munich.

Both historic figures of Ife and the offices associated with them are represented. One of the best documented among this is the early king Obalufon II who is said to have invented bronze casting and is honored in the form of a naturalistic copper life-size mask. [8]  The city was a settlement of substantial size between the 12th and 14th centuries, with houses featuring potsherd pavements. Ilé-Ifè is known worldwide for its ancient and naturalistic bronze, stone and terracotta sculptures, which reached their peak of artistic expression between 1200 and 1400 A.D. In the period around 1300 C.E. the artists at Ife developed a refined and naturalistic sculptural tradition in terracotta, stone and copper alloy - copper, brass, and bronze many of which appear to have been created under the patronage of King Obalufon II, the man who today is identified as the Yoruba patron deity of brass casting, weaving and regalia. [9] After this period, production declined as political and economic power shifted to the nearby kingdom of Benin which, like the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo, developed into a major empire.  Bronze and terracotta art created by this civilization are significant examples of naturalism in pre-colonial African art and are distinguished by their variations in regalia, facial marking patterns, and body proportions. Ancient Ife also was famous for its glass beads which have been found at sites as far away as Mali, Mauritania, and Ghana."

He is often credited with attracting the attention of Western cultural figures to Balinese culture and art in the 1930s and he influenced the direction of Balinese art and drama. Mexican artist and anthropologist Miguel Covarrubias, who lived and researched in Bali with his wife Rose at that time, wrote: ""Walter Spies, Bali's most famous resident, was the son of a German diplomat in Moskow at the outbreak of the World War. Spies was already well known in Europe as a painter in 1923. (...). As fine a musician as he was a painter (...), after the war he ran away from disorganized Europe to the East until he reached Java, where he was called by the Sultan of Djokjakarta to organize and lead a Western orchestra.

By making the sources of his inspiration the subject of his work, Martin shares the ‘behind the scenes’ processes of his practice, giving insight to an approach to abstraction which is informed as much by art history as contemporary media. In Memory of James Brown “Godfather of Soul” is a painting which took 2 years to complete; though Martin’s work often appears playfully spontaneous, this aesthetic is developed through prolonged reconsideration and reworking of the canvas, with some pieces taking  as much as 20 years to finish. The black and white pattern, painted over a collage, resembles both vinyl LPs and an 60s op art – a movement whose revolutionary funkadelic stylings are a worthy tribute to Brown’s legacy."

museum,3c9tsi,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:45:34 2015 UTC,"Auguste Rodin:       François-Auguste-René Rodin (12 November 1840 – 17 November 1917), known as Auguste Rodin (/oʊˈɡuːst roʊˈdæn/; French: [oɡyst ʁɔdɛ̃]), was a French sculptor. Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture,  he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition,  although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art.  Sculpturally, Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in clay. Many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with the predominant figure sculpture tradition, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory, modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community.  From the unexpected realism of his first major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.

Bob Ross was a grandmaster American oil painter who primarily practiced the finer, more respectable arts of relaxation and kindness. His quiet, nurturing disposition was a form of therapy to the weary, and the reassuring intonations of his gentle voice hypnotized entire generations of would-be illustrators into creating a million-dollar art supply store enterprise.  His PBS series The Joy of Painting duped viewers around the globe into believing they too could create impeccable rectangles of content suitable for framing in just under twenty-six minutes. For this reason, it's no wonder The Joy of Painting is the most recognized and studied art show in the history of television. Ross's light, experimental excursions through nature and beyond have thrived since 1983 on over 300 public television stations -- a phenomenal achievement for programs of this genre. Every thirty minutes, on a public TV station somewhere in the United States, Bob Ross is just starting (or just finishing up) another masterpiece."

At this point she was long past her heyday, and the optimism of her her usual circles and arcs was still refreshing but hardly avant garde.  Yet this oil is arguably the most forward looking thing she ever painted. In its conceptual simplicity it resembles pop art, while staying firmly in the realm of abstraction. The brushwork is vigorous, typical of Delaunay's late paintings - she had always painted loosely, but in her last couple decades she displayed an energy closer to abex than the lighter geometrical abstraction she normally identifies with. Indeed this may simultaneously be her loosest and most geometrically rigorous painting.  What really makes this painting is the vibrant palette. Delaunay always stuck to bright simple colours, here pushing that to an absurd level that looks like the colours from a child's drugstore-bought paintset. If not for the large initials and date I would have thought this was painted in the 2010s, perhaps by Mary Heillman or some other neo-abstractionist."

Sadly my memory of it will always be a little bit tainted since I had a college Art History professor who had a feminist chip on her shoulder and made it a point to spin every painting description into a story of male artists cruelly exploiting women, subjugating them by painting them nude. She sucked all the joy out of impressionism. I suppose she was extending her graduate thesis into her lesson as a means of showing her commitment to it but it was shame she was politicizing the art like that and teaching that drivel to undergrads. I take the department heads to task for allowing it to happen. This was at the University of Buffalo back in the 80's. The last I heard of this woman she was trying to get the Albright Knox Art Gallery to cover or take down works by female artists on a specific day in an early example of ""day without art"" with a feminist slant. I have NO PROBLEM with feminists and certainly art history has been dominated by ""old white men"" and women are second class citizens in the art world, as in other fields, but I am NOT on board with using the impressionists as a trojan horse to further ANY political agenda."

Even more than the dancers, the scenes of horse racing and urban life, or the portraits that made him famous, the nude was the genre Degas used to introduce new ideas and develop his style over the course of almost fifty years. In the late 1870s and early 1880s, Degas' interest seemed to move more towards representing nude women at their daily activities, like washing or combing their hair, or even resting for a moment after a bath. The repeated representation of these activities, as opposed to the study of the classical nude referring back to Antiquity, then guided his stylistic evolution."

He discovered lithography in the 1940s, at the workshop of Fernand Mourlot in Paris. One monumental series created there, Woman in an Armchair, exists in thirty experimental variations.   In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was stimulated by the possibilities of linoleum cut under the tutelage of Hidalgo Arnéra, a printer whose shop was near his studio in southern France. Innovations continued, as evidenced by the one-block process he devised for color printing, seen here in the striking Still Life with Glass under the Lamp.1  Still Life Under The Lamp consists of nine color prints, each showing a subsequent stage in the linocut's progression, as the artist cut, printed and printed again to view the results of his work. Most multi-colored linocut works are produced using a series of different linoleum blocks, one for each color.   However, Picasso chose to use just one piece of lino, cutting it, printing it, cleaning it off and cutting again to print in a further color, to build up an image, and leave behind a remarkable series of proofs.2"
museum,3bm0nq,WandererAboveFog,14,Tue Jun 30 08:36:33 2015 UTC,"Morning /r/museum and welcome to Dali masterpiece I recently stumbled upon whilst watching a documentary on Dali by the BBC.   Now usually I would go into the painting and try and give some context or describe the painting itself but Dali's oeuvre is so diverse, personal and dynamic that I could make mountains out of molehills for every ant, every rock and every human figure so i'll leave you with two paragraphs that are set in stone and feel relevant to have contributed to the painting.   The painting represents Dalí's severely conflicted attitudes towards sexual intercourse. In Dalí's youth, his father had left out a book with explicit photos of people suffering from advanced untreated venereal diseases to ""educate"" the boy. The photos of grotesquely damaged diseased genitalia fascinated and horrified young Dalí, and he continued to associate sex with putrefaction and decay into his adulthood.   “In that privileged place, reality and the sublime dimension almost come together. My mystical paradise begins in the plains of the Empordà, is surrounded by the Alberes hills, and reaches plenitude in the bay of Cadaqués. This land is my permanent inspiration. The only place in the world, too, where I feel loved. When I painted that rock that I entitled The Great Masturbator, I did nothing more than render homage to one of the promontories of my kingdom, and my painting was a hymn to one of the jewels of my crown.” — Salvador Dalí   The rock can be seen in 13:10 in this BBC documentary freely available on Youtube.

museum,3bizy4,beingandnothingness,3,Mon Jun 29 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"Bullfighting is Not a Sport – It is a Tragedy  It symbolizes the struggle between man and beasts. The three acts of the drama are the entry, the planting of the banderilleros, and the death of the bull. A Canadian at ringside.  It was spring in Paris and everything looked just a little too beautiful. Mike and I decided to go to Spain. Strater drew us a fine map of Spain on the back of a menu of the Strix restaurant. On the same menu he wrote the name of a restaurant in Madrid where the specialty is young suckling pig roasted, the name of the pensione on the Via San Jerónimo where the bullfighters live, and sketched a plan showing where the Grecos are hung in the Prado.  Fully equipped with this menu and our old clothes, we started for Spain. Our objective—to see bullfights.  We left Paris one morning and got off the train at Madrid the next noon. We saw our first bullfight at 4:30 that afternoon. It took about two hours to get tickets. We finally got them from scalpers for twenty-five pesetas apiece. The bullring was entirely sold out. We had barrera seats. These, the scalper explained in Spanish and broken French, were the first row of the ringside, directly under the royal box, and immediately opposite where the bulls would come out.  We asked him if he didn’t have any less distinguished seats for somewhere around twelve pesetas, but he was sold out. So we paid the fifty pesetas for the two tickets, and with the tickets in our pockets sat out on the sidewalk in front of a big café near the Puerta del Sol. It was very exciting, sitting out in front of a café your first day in Spain with a ticket in your pocket that meant that rain or shine you were going to see a bullfight in an hour and a half. In fact, it was so exciting that we started out for the bullring on the outskirts of the city in about half an hour.  The bullring or Plaza de Toros was a big, tawny brick amphitheater standing at the end of a street in an open field. The yellow and red Spanish flag was floating over it. Carriages were driving up and people getting out of buses. There was a great crowd of beggars around the entrance. Men were selling water out of big terra-cotta water bottles. Kids sold fans, canes, roasted salted almonds in paper spills, fruit and slabs of ice cream. The crowd was gay and cheerful but all intent on pushing toward the entrance. Mounted civil guards with patent-leather cocked hats and carbines slung over their back sat their horses like statues, and the crowd flowed through.  Inside they all stood around in the bullring, talking and looking up in the grandstand at the girls in the boxes. Some of the men had field glasses in order to look better. We found our seats and the crowd began to leave the ring and get into the rows of concrete seats. The ring was circular—that sounds foolish, but a boxing ring is square—with a sand floor. Around it was a red board fence—just high enough for a man to be able to vault over it. Between the board fence, which is called the barrera, and the first row of seats ran a narrow alleyway. Then came the seats which were just like a football stadium except that around the top ran a double circle of boxes.  Every seat in the amphitheater was full. The arena was cleared. Then on the far side of the arena out of the crowd, four heralds in medieval costume stood up and blew a blast on their trumpets. The band crashed out, and from the entrance on the far side of the ring four horsemen in black velvet with ruffs around their necks rode out into the white glare of the arena. The people on the sunny side were baking in the heat and fanning themselves. The whole sol. side was a flicker of fans.  Behind the four horsemen came the procession of the bullfighters. They had been all formed in ranks in the entranceway ready to march out, and as the music started they came. In the front rank walked the three espadas, or toreros, who would have charge of the killing of the six bulls of the afternoon.  They came walking out in heavily brocaded yellow and black costumes, the familiar “toreador” suit, heavy with gold embroidery, cape, jacket, shirt and collar, knee breeches, pink stockings, and low pumps. Always at bullfights, afterward the incongruity of those pink stockings used to strike me. Just behind the three principals—and after your first bullfight you do not look at their costumes but their faces—marched the teams, or cuadrillas. They are dressed in the same way but not as gorgeously as the matadors.  Back of the teams ride the picadors. Big, heavy, brown-faced men in wide flat hats, carrying lances like long window poles. They are astride horses that make Spark Plug look as trim and sleek as a King’s Plate winner. Back of the pics come the gaily harnessed mule teams and the red-shirted monos, or bullring servants.  The bullfighters march in across the sand to the president’s box. They march with easy professional stride, swinging along, not in the least theatrical except for their clothes. They all have the easy grace and slight slouch of the professional athlete. From their faces they might be major league ball players. They salute the president’s box and then spread out along the barrera, exchanging their heavy brocaded capes for the fighting capes that have been laid along the red fence by the attendants.  We leaned forward over the barrera. Just below us the three matadors of the afternoon were leaning against the fence talking. One lighted a cigarette. He was a short, clear-skinned gypsy, Gitanillo, in a wonderful gold brocaded jacket, his short pigtail sticking out under his black cocked hat.  “He’s not very fancy,” a young man in a straw hat, with obviously American shoes, who sat on my left, said.  “But he sure knows bulls, that boy. He’s a great killer.”  “You’re an American, aren’t you?” asked Mike.  “Sure,” the boy grinned. “But I know this gang. That’s Gitanillo. You want to watch him. The kid with the chubby face is Chicuelo. They say he doesn’t really like bullfighting, but the town’s crazy about him. The one next to him is Villalta. He’s the great one.”  I had noticed Villalta. He was straight as a lance and walked like a young wolf. He was talking and smiling at a friend who leaned over the barrera. Upon his tanned cheekbone was a big patch of gauze held on with adhesive tape.  “He got gored last week at Málaga,” said the American."

Set against an eerily vacant yellow backdrop bathed in a red glow, the dogs, with their fangs bared, strike an anxious note, while the pale-blue bones near their paws suggest death or carnage. The subject matter was likely inspired not only by contemporary events but by pre-Columbian terracotta burial sculptures. In Aztec and Maya mythology, dogs were considered guides to the underworld, and statues of them were often buried with members of the ruling class."

It was his first print of an impossible reality. In this artwork there are two quite distinctly recognizable realities bound together in a natural, and yet at the same time a completely impossible, way. Looked at from the window, the houses make book-rests between which tiny dolls are set up. Looked at from the street, the books stand yards high and a gigantic tobacco jar stands at the crossroads.  A small street in Savona, Italy, was the inspiration for this work. Escher said it was one of his favorite drawings but thought he could have drawn it better.1"

It was painted while Basquiat was on an extended visit to Los Angeles, California, in 1983. Several of the work’s notations are autobiographical: the trio of figures on the right depicts the artist with the rap musician Rammellzee and the painter Toxic, who had traveled with him from New York, and he includes the digits of his birth date: 12, 22, and 60. Other notations are historical: phrases such as “Sugar Cane,” “Tobacco,” “Gangsterism,” and “What is Bwana?” allude to the limited roles available to black actors in old Hollywood movies. The notion of exclusion or excision is reiterated in the way that Basquiat often crossed out words or phrases in his works. The technique, he explained, was actually meant to direct attention to them: “I cross out words so you will see them more; the fact that they are obscured makes you want to read them.”"

The Parliamentarians have taken over the house and question the son about his Royalist father (the man lounging on a chair in the centre of the scene is identifiable as a Roundhead officer by his military attire and his orange sash[2]). Yeames was inspired to paint the picture to show the crises that could arise from the natural frankness of young children. Here, if the boy tells the truth he will endanger his father, but if he lies he will go against the ideal of honesty undoubtedly instilled in him by his parents.  The boy in the pictures is based on Thomas Gainsborough's painting The Blue Boy. It was modelled by Yeames' nephew, James Lambe Yeames. Behind the boy, there is a girl, probably the daughter, waiting her turn to be questioned. The girl was based on Yeames' niece, Mary Yeames. At the back of the hall the mother and elder daughter wait anxiously on the boy's reply. The scene is neutral: while the innocence of the boy is emphasized by his blond hair, open expression and blue suit, the questioners are also treated sympathetically; the main interrogator has a friendly expression and the sergeant with the little girl has his arm on her shoulder as if comforting her. The painting is at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, having been bought in 1878, just a year after the gallery opened in 1877. Madame Tussauds in London has a life-size waxwork tableau of the scene, faithfully reproduced from the painting.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Frederick_Yeames#.22And_When_Did_You_Last_See_Your_Father.3F.22"

Similarly, few galleries were large enough to accommodate them, and only two of the more than one hundred in this series were exhibited before the artist died in 1962. Although Louis painted on a vast scale, the brightly colored ribbons of paint cascading down the sides of this canvas invite a close look. Perhaps even more remarkable than the immense size of this work is the broad expanse of raw canvas Louis left exposed—an emphatic void framed by exuberant color."

museum,3b6dkc,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:02:04 2015 UTC,"Slavic dragon:       In Slavic mythology, the word “zmey” (Bulgarian and Russian: змей, Macedonian: змеj) and its cognates zmiy (Polish: żmij, Ukrainian: змій) and zmaj (Serbian: змај, Croatian, Slovene: zmaj), are used to describe a dragon. These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for ""snake"", which are normally feminine (like Russian zmeya).  In Romania, there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named zmeu. In Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklore, a dragon is also called smok (смок, цмок, smok).  In South Slavic folklore, the female variation is also called lamya (derived from lamia). Although quite similar to other European dragons, Slavic dragons have their peculiarities.

Incredibly daring in this respect is the early, unfinished and rarely seen Man Mad with Fear (1844-45), characterized by an unusually broad swatch of bright blue for the sky, and abstract expressionist brushwork below the image of the titular man mad with fear. In Bathers and in Man Mad with Fear, Courbet may well be anticipating the anti-illusionistic tradition that leads to abstraction, his ""realism"" hence calling attention not only to contemporary life but also to the flat surface of a painting.1"

museum,3ayc6j,doriangray512,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:11:04 2015 UTC,"In 1928, Moholy took a series of perhaps eight views of the Berlin Radio Tower: just finished in 1926, it was one of the most exciting new constructions in the German capital. Moholy had already photographed the Eiffel Tower in Paris, looking up through the tower’s soaring girders. In Berlin, however, he turned his camera around and pointed it straight down at the ground. The plunging perspective he chose showed off the most spectacular achievement of the Berlin Radio Tower: While the Parisian tower needed a base of 1,300 square feet for stability, the Berlin Radio Tower was nearly seven times smaller at its base—making the view from its 450-foot peak especially vertiginous.  The Berlin Radio Tower series demonstrates better than any other work by Moholy the eye-opening potential of unexpected angles and progressive technologies that he called the New Vision. Moholy attached exceptional importance to this image, the boldest in the series. He hung it just above his name in the room devoted to his work at the Berlin showing of Film und Foto. In 1931, this image was reproduced in the leading art periodical Der Querschnitt. That same year, Moholy held his first one-person exhibition of photographs in New York, at the Julien Levy Gallery. A different view from the Berlin Radio Tower was one of several works purchased from this show by the Museum of Modern Art. Meanwhile, Moholy had sold another print of this exact image along with two further views of the same subject to Levy, whose collection of painting and photography passed into the Art Institute of Chicago in 1979.

museum,3axoc5,WandererAboveFog,8,Wed Jun 24 09:35:26 2015 UTC,"Morning /r/museum and I greet you with a painting of writhing sinners and angels being thrust into the underworld with little to no care of humanity and a reminder of what awaits us if the lives we live be full of sin. Happy Wednesday!  Rubens  For those who are not familiar with Rubens, he is a master of the baroque style who predominantly painted landscapes, altarpieces, portraits based on religious, history and mythological subjects. Due to a lot of his paintings containing nudes he even has the term ‘Rubenesque’ termed after him. Rubens was a classically educated scholar and through his success as a painter he was knighted by Phillip IV, King of Spain and Charles I, king of England, and a large quantity of his work was painted to be popular with the nobility and collectors of Europe.  What can we see here?  The painting is a depiction of the fall of the guilty and the falling angels during Gods final judgment by the archangel Michael. The guilty  in the image are painted naked, as is Rubens style, and the mass is being hurled into hell by a twister grabbing up all those that have fallen. None that have been guilty of sin are sparred as seen in the side of the twister where humans are being picked up without having fallen into the twister.   You can see that the fallen angels are still in their evil ways as they torment the guilty humans even as they are being thrown into the pits of hell. The dramatic chiaroscuro of the human forms and clouds emphasizes the darkness into which these figures fall, far from the heaven light above.  A Baptism of Acid  Due to the controversy and scandal this painting caused, there was an incident in 1959 where an art vandal threw acid onto the painting but it didn’t cause the painting irreparable damage. According to him, he did not directly destroy the work, but the acid ""relieves one from the work of destruction"".  The painting itself is in the Alko Pinakothek in Munich abut sketches of the painting can be see in the British Museum in London."

The artwork shows an interior scene of a raucous pub, and offers a contemporary glimpse of daily life in the early 19th century United States.  Contextually, this artwork is set in a rural town bar in the first two decades of the 19th century, probably somewhere in Pennsylvania or New Jersey.  The black musician playing the fiddle is NOT a slave, he's a hired itinerant performer.  Notice the couple making out in the back!  I can talk more about the fun visual jokes in this picture -- it's somewhat romanticized, but still a pretty good contemporary representation of a raucous rural bar in Mid-Atlantic United States in the early 19th century."

It shows an apparently nude woman with her arms wrapped around her legs while she sits on a blanket in bright sunlight against a darkened doorway. The dynamic balance of the light and dark accentuate the curves and angles of the woman's body; at the same time her face and all but the slightest hint of her pubic area are hidden from view, requiring the viewer to concentrate on her arms, legs, feet and hands.

Although remarkably successful in capturing the nuances of light and dark present in the photograph, the drawing is utterly different in appearance and effect. Why the artistic recreation? Part of the answer may be that for Sheeler both the drawing and the photograph were equally significant; each medium offered a different means to an end and aspects of one could inform and influence the other.

The spare geometry of the eighteenth-century Doylestown farmhouse proved an irresistible subject for an artist eager to explore with a camera the radical formal ideas that had impressed him in the paintings of Cézanne, Picasso, and Bracque. It is an elegantly balanced, harmonious work, a testament to Sheeler's clarity of vision and ability to distill a scene to its essence—a salient feature of the artist's work in all media."

museum,3ast4i,rolyathd,4,Tue Jun 23 05:45:47 2015 UTC,"Biography  During a fifty-year career, Bricher made a comfortable living from his work but was rarely praised by critics. Born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he grew up in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and by 1851 was working in Boston. He became a professional painter in 1858, after meeting Charles Temple Dix and William Stanley Haseltine while sketching at Mount Desert, Maine. The following year he had his own studio in Newburyport. During the 1860s, Bricher made pictures for L. Prang and Company's print catalogue; like many New England artists of this period, he sought to bring his work before a wider public. In 1868 he married and moved his studio to New York, but over the next decades spent a great deal of time traveling, primarily sketching seascapes up and down the Atlantic coast. Most of his summer trips were to the New England states. On these trips he made landscape studies that were later transformed into oils and luminous watercolors. He was particularly impressed with Grand Manan Island off the Maine coast in the Bay of Fundy, whose rugged cliffs and surrounding sea he drew and painted for seventeen years."

In 1948 the State Museum of New Western Art was closed down by a decree signed by Stalin due to its allegedly bourgeois, cosmopolitan and wrongly oriented artworks.

museum,3ahb7w,crackalack,45,Sun Jun 21 00:52:58 2015 UTC,I think that's the point. The title asserts that the world is entirely a creation of our perception - before our birth there is nothing. Therefore the artist is juxtaposing a radical philosophical view with what we think of as a crude pornographic image. In this way it's a forerunner to Magritte's pipe.  Alternatively it could be seen as a joke and criticism about the human obsession with sex. The artist is saying men put too much importance on vaginas when we should be thinking about grander subjects like the origins of the universe.

He has been called the ""most influential creator of gay pornographic images"" by cultural historian Joseph W. Slade...The trustee of The Judith Rothschild Foundation, Harvey S. Shipley Miller, said, “Tom of Finland is one of the five most influential artists of the twentieth century. As an artist he was superb, as an influence he was transcendent.”   Tom was a massive influence in the gay pride movement, inspiring gay men to take pride in and perceive beauty in their sexuality. His drawings are technically excellent, and he has been described as a ""master with a pencil"". Overall, he is a controversial but important figure both in 20th century art and in the LGBTQ community."

He began the project in 1725 and started producing a few prints a year beginning in 1737 focusing on the bones, then the muscles, and published the entire set together largely at his own expense in 1747 under the title, Tabulae Sceleti et Musculorum Corporis Humani.  The monumental volume was an impressive book at nearly three feet tall and two feet wide:   Albinus never completed the project, which was to include all the systems of the body, but the initial volume on the bones and muscles had a far-reaching impact on the world of anatomy as the designs for the plates were reprinted in numerous editions and copied by later anatomists and artists for more than a century.  The artist and engraver with whom Albinus did nearly all of his work was Jan Wandelaar (1690-1759).  In an attempt to increase the scientific accuracy of anatomical illustration, Albinus and Wandelaar devised a new technique of placing nets with square webbing at specified intervals between the artist and the anatomical specimen and copying the images using the grid patterns. Tabulae was highly criticized by such engravers as Petrus Camper, especially for the whimsical backgrounds added to many of the pieces by Wandelaar, but Albinus staunchly defended Wandelaar and his work.  The backgrounds were meant not only to fill up blank space behind the figures, but to add perspective and depth to the figures themselves."

museum,3ab5gr,specialservices,14,Thu Jun 18 17:53:25 2015 UTC,"Apologies to /u/specialservices for butting in to the comment section but I really enjoy looking at this painting too much to not provide some context for those interested!  What's going on?!   At the center point are three semi-nude witches wearing penitential coroza bearing aloft a writhing nude figure, their mouths close to their victim, as if to devour him or suck his blood. Below, two figures in peasants' garb recoil from the spectacle: one has thrown himself to the ground covering his ears, the other attempts to escape by covering himself with a blanket, making the figa hand gesture (which i'll come on to later) to ward off the evil eye. Finally, a donkey emerges on the right, seemingly oblivious to the rest of the scene.   We must go deeper   The general scholarly consensus is that the painting represents a rationalist critique of superstition and ignorance, particularly in religious matters: the witches' corozas are not only emblematic of the violence of the Spanish Inquisition (the upward flames indicate that they have been condemned as unrepentant heretics and will be burned at the stake), but are also reminiscent of episcopal mitres, bearing the characteristic double points.  The accusations of religious tribunals are thus reflected back on themselves, whose actions are implicitly equated with superstition and ritualized sacrifice. The bystanders can then be understood either as appalled but unable to do anything or willfully ignorant and unwilling to intervene. The donkey, finally, is the traditional symbol of ignorance.   The Figa hand gesture in the painting is also very interesting in itself.    Fig sign is a gesture made with the hand and fingers curled and the thumb thrust between the middle and index fingers, or, rarely, the middle and ring fingers, forming the fist so that the thumb partly pokes out. In some areas of the world, the gesture is considered a good luck charm; in others (including Greece, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Russia, Serbia and Turkey among others), it is considered an obscene gesture.   The precise origin of the gesture is unknown, but many historians speculate that it refers to a penis penetrating the female genitalia (to which The Finger also refers). In ancient Greece, this gesture was a fertility and good luck charm designed to ward off evil. This usage has survived in Portugal and Brazil, where carved images of hands in this gesture are used in good luck talismans.   I found it really cool how such a hand gesture can have such connotations in so many cultures and i'm a general sucker for symbolism in paintings! Goya uses it here in (my opinion) masterful effect for a painting with rather dark themes.  The painting is also the centre of everything in the movie Trance if you would like a Thursday night mind trip."

If I had to try and understand it, it looks like a comment on fashion and the role it plays in the life and worldview of people (women specifically?). The squares which start off as a feature of the tights become a generic feature of the painting, not relegated as articles of fashion.   Not sure what the (secret?) language refers to though. Maybe to represent the unknowability or fashion and the reasons behind it while understanding that there is an underlying reasoning that we are unable to clearly comprehend."

Indianapolis Museum of Art  This painting, named after an East Coast railroad line, was created during the Depression and depicts a landscape and desolate house. The prominent track evokes Hopper’s recurring themes of transience and the loneliness of the traveler.  The frontal view and the broad horizontal line of the railroad suggest a stage, underlining the separation between the viewer and the scene.  The crisp lines and sharp angles of the house are softened by the rounded, natural shapes of the trees, and the dark green balances the bright sky. Hopper’s compositions are often based on oppositions like this that unite to form a harmonic whole."

museum,3a1vs9,whippoorwont,11,Tue Jun 16 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"Ivan Bilibin’s illustrations for Vasilisa the Beautiful were originally published in 1900.  In this [fairy] tale, young and beautiful Vasilisa is tormented by her stepmother with laborious, daily tasks.  Vasilisa is only able to complete them with the help of the magical doll her mother had given her on her death bed.  One day, the stepmother sent Vasilisa to retrieve fire from the witch, Baba Yaga.  Upon meeting Baba Yaga, Vasilisa finds herself again having to complete laborious tasks, only this time Vasilisa must complete them or die.  She completes the tasks with the help of her trusty doll, and Baba Yaga grants her fire in the form of a human skull torch.  This image depicts young and beautiful Vasilisa in a dark, ominous forest.  The viewer can see Baba Yaga’s house set upon chicken legs in the background.  In the foreground, Vasilisa tightly grips her skull torchlight, illuminating her path home.  Bilibin’s love for the Russian wilderness is apparent in this meticulous forest scene.  Several different kinds of vegetation are carefully drawn around the subject, Vasilisa, as well as in the decorative border filled with different species of fungi.  Bilibin’s national pride is evident in the careful costume design of Vasilisa’s garment.  She is wearing both a traditional dress as well as traditional shoes.   Source and other illustrations."

Conceptual art overtook both of them in the 70s as the forefront of the avant garde. By the 80s Neo-expressionism emerged as a counterpoint to conceptual and performance art. It was seen as a return to art based on emotion and instinct rather than cerebral calculation and a return to sensual  expression- painting- rather than art based on ideas, language or actions.  Basquiat was seen as an american manifestation of neo expressionism, which was big in both America and Europe, and arose around the same time.  In this work the type of figuration is reminiscent of the Die Brücke movement in early 20th cent Germany- attenuated figures which communicate meaning through emotive qualities rather than realistic believability.  see for ex:  http://www.moma.org/explore/collection/ge/themes/death#slide09  http://www.rolandcollection.tv/images/covers/14-505.GIF  http://c300221.r21.cf1.rackcdn.com/artillerymen-kirchner-ernst-ludwig-die-brucke-oil-on-canvas-nude-terminartors-1373228094_b.jpg  The way they are filled in with flat jagged color recalls Ab Ex paintings  like Guston  http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/artwork/images/Guston-Natives_Return.jpg  Clyfford Still  http://www.reproduction-gallery.com/catalogue/uploads/1341638687_large-image_clyffordstillreproduction1952ph42032large.jpg  and early Rothko, etc  http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BN765_rothko_DV_20130417185707.jpg  The cartoonish nature of the figures, and especially the ""censored cursing"" comic book marks, as well as the ""Ideal"" sign recall the Pop Art appropriations of Lichenstein and early Warhol.  Lastly, the offhand nature of the scribbling and some of the ""ugly"" abstract marks recall work like Cy Twombly, and the general ""anything goes"" approach calls to mind the work of people dealing with Art Brut, such as Dubuffet or Asger Jorn.  It is a synthesis of all these references in an original, fresh and unforced manner that made works like these so compelling to the art audience of the 80s and partially to the audience of today.  The preceding was mostly a  formal and art historical analysis, but it is the inclusion of an original cultural perspective that also gives this work depth, as Basquiat was an American artist of afro -caribbean-european roots which gave him a rich selection of traditions from which to draw inspiration."

Whilst I love Basquiat's work (and that of the above named artists too), it's very difficult to put one's finger on a defining characteristic.  In many ways modern art (and Modern Art) are self sustaining and self-promoting industries.  What is ""good"" is good because it is considered good.  What is ""bad"" is bad because it's not good.  In other words... it's hard to say.  Sorry for the wishy washy reply.  I'm only a simple art fan and I'm sure there are more erudite and thought provoking answers from the 'experts'."

museum,39wlvc,shazzam,3,Mon Jun 15 16:24:33 2015 UTC,"But it's more than that, isn't it? It's intention. At least intention is really prominent for me when I'm looking at modern art.   I didn't always enjoy it, it took me a while to get over the ""kindergarten art"" mentality. But one day (don't remember the museum) I saw a really simple, odd shaped metal sculpture. Looking at it made me smile. I didn't find it humorous, it just somehow was provoking that reaction from me. The docent probably thought I was crazy, but I stared at that thing for a really long time.  I think, if you haven't had an ""aha"" moment with modern art, it is hard to see past the sometimes rudimentary style."

museum,39um2i,SpaceGhostDerrp,3,Sun Jun 14 22:36:47 2015 UTC,"In 1905, deeply affected by Matisse’s painting Luxe, calme et volupté, 1904, Raoul Dufy began his lifelong exploration of color and line, joining the fauve pursuit of a freer technique that liberated both elements from descriptive function. Subsequent study of Cézanne and work with Braque brought greater structure to his compositions.  As early as 1930, Duncan Phillips had written of the “skill and bravura” of Dufy’s painting, and of the keen understanding of the “narrow path of technical discipline” that lay behind Dufy’s finesse. The Opera, Paris was shown in the 1941 Phillips exhibition “The Functions of Color” in a grouping that included Charles Burchfield, Stuart Davis, Karl Knaths, and John Marin; it was intended to demonstrate “Calligraphic Color and Color in Calligraphy.” Phillips likened Dufy’s work to oriental art and French impressionism, because of the “ornamental continuity of the lines” and its “form-dissolving prismatic light.”  http://www.phillipscollection.org/collection/browse-the-collection?id=0613"

museum,39unm5,SpaceGhostDerrp,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:51:01 2015 UTC,"With its brilliant color, dramatic luminosity, and simplified forms, Red Hills, Lake George typifies the distinctive approach to landscape painting Georgia O’Keeffe, as well as other artists that were part of Alfred Stieglitz’s circle. Within her oeuvre, this is a transitional work, presaging the stark drama of her later New Mexico landscapes, while also paying homage to her earlier experiences out west and at Lake George. O'Keeffe tended to allow memory-images to emerge years later recombined and reinterpreted in a fully realized composition. This painting possibly has several influences—memories—that O’Keeffe recalled when she painted this. One contemporary critic, Henry McBride, wrote in 1928 that she derived the theme for Red Hills in Texas. Indeed, her memories of her years teaching in Texas, as well as a brief but memorable trip to New Mexico in 1917 seem to have informed this striking composition. Yet, it is also quite possible that the stunning red in this painting is also derived from her specific memories of autumn sunsets at Lake George. O’Keeffe wrote in a letter in 1923 that “the mountain on the other side of the lake is a dark burning red,” when looking out the window at Stieglitz’s home at Lake George.  O’Keeffe carefully studied the work and writings of German expressionist painter Wassily Kandinsky. Red Hills, Lake George reflects his treatise On the Spiritual in Art. Her experiences would have made her receptive to Kandinksy's theories and his ideas on color and form and their symbolic and spiritual meanings are transformed into her own set of beliefs. Kandinsky wrote, “Red...reveals, for all its energy and intensity, a powerful note of immense, almost purposeful strength.” At the core—the brilliant white sun—there is a moment of stillness and silence in the midst of intense, radiating color. Kandinsky remarked about white, “[It] has the sound as of a silence that suddenly becomes comprehensible...the nothingness that exists before the beginning, before birth."" For O’Keeffe, this painting was the blending of spirit and matter, when she said, “You paint from your subject, not what you see.”  In 1926, the year before Red Hills, Lake George was painted, Duncan Phillips had already listed O'Keeffe among a group of visionary artists who ""have had one aim in common—to link modernity to the infinite by their command of rhythm and by their inventions of new or revitalized instruments of plastic expression."" In Phillips's estimate, she joined in the search for underlying mystical qualities, which the early American modernists believed dwelled in nature, and with them had begun exploring landscape imagery as a vehicle for self-expression.  http://www.phillipscollection.org/collection/browse-the-collection?id=1450"
museum,39ukn6,SpaceGhostDerrp,2,Sun Jun 14 22:24:07 2015 UTC,"In 1901 Cézanne built a studio north of the city of Aix and about twenty kilometers west of Mont Sainte-Victoire. Chosen for for its panoramic view of his beloved Provence, this commanding site was the main focus of Cézanne’s work until his death in 1906. Dispirited and in failing health, he increasingly turned to painting for spiritual nourishment. Though never mentioned in his letters, The Garden at Les Lauves seems to belong to the “constructions after nature, based on methods, sensations and developments suggested by the model” that Cézanne desired to pursue as late as fall a906. Writing of the tortuous slowness of his “researches,” Cézanne still reveled in views of “the same subject, seen from a different angle,” with which “I would occupy myself… for months… by leaning once a little more to the right, once a little more to the left.""  The painting resonates with structural solidity and compositional harmony. It seems to be a distilled vision of observations on conveying pictorial space that Cézanne made in a letter to Emile Bernard in 1906: “Lines parallel to the horizon give breadth, that is, a section of nature…. Lines perpendicular to the horizon give depth. But nature…. Is more depth than surface.”  http://www.phillipscollection.org/collection/browse-the-collection?id=0286"

The first Klee work to be acquired by Duncan Phillips, it probably appealed to him because of its colors, texture, and “fanciful and unobtrusively artful pattern.” Nevertheless, Tree Nursery was considered part of the “experimental laboratory of the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery” and kept on display for only a short time after its purchase.  Tree Nursery is a clear illustration of Klee’s intense studies of nature’s laws governing growth and form. He believed these powers to be closely related to those of the artist, who consequently assumed a near godlike position. He wrote in his notebook: “Foe I was where the beginning is… that is tantamount to being fruitful.”  http://www.phillipscollection.org/collection/browse-the-collection?id=1000"

museum,39pvbs,runfortherungod,3,Sat Jun 13 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"During the early 1870s, Homer often explored a single theme through several media, and his oil painting, Boat Builders, set on the coast of Gloucester, Massachusetts, relates to a series of prints and drawings devoted to shipbuilding. Homer also used this image of the two boys in an engraving for the October 11, 1873, issue of Harper’s Weekly. The scene pairs Homer’s love of outdoor subjects with his fondness for themes of boys at play. In the central passage, Homer’s genius for subtle, yet penetrating narrative connects the real nautical world with the boys’ imagination by overlapping the toy boat and sailing ship. In their play, the two boys may have been preparing for future lives at sea as fishermen, sailors, or shipwrights. This panel bears only a trace of the ominous tone that often pervades Homer’s paintings of life by the sea.   - The Maritime Themes of Winslow Homer"

I find this series interesting because it's so different from her other work. The schematic representations of machinery recall Picabia, and the artist allows a single colour (in this case blue, in others yellow) to dominate her image.  Of course Delaunay doesn't lose sight of her signature motifs, most notably the ever present circles. Yet usually arcs semicircles of different colours intersect to form a single shape. Here the circles are cohesive and purposeful. The only place we see her more typical palette is on the propeller itself."

museum,39mzlx,durutticolumn,2,Fri Jun 12 22:04:57 2015 UTC,"Delaunay's early portraits are truly expressionist. I mean by this that their purpose is not to evoke an emotion in the viewer (which most expressionism seems to set at its highest goal), nor even to express the artist's feelings. Rather, they express the subject's state of mind.  Take for instance her Yellow Nude of 1908. At first glance I thought the woman was judging the viewer, making us uncomfortable for staring at her body. But I don't think this is the correct reading. The way that triangle of pink light cuts into her boldly outlined nose definitely conveys attitude, but it's a purely internal attitude. I don't know whether the woman cares if we look or not, but I do know she cares about lying there in that pose.  The Sleeping Girl allows me to take this interpretation to its extreme. If ever someone doesn't care about the outside world, it's when they're asleep. This girl's pose is just unnatural enough that we know it's no accident, but obviously she's lost in her own thoughts.  This piece is also interesting for the shape of the woman's face. It's so round, like the artist cared more about perfect geometry than accurate depiction. (Am I wrong to see a connection to the young Raphael in this geometric idealization?) Additionally the face, divided as it is by shadow, puts me in mind of many of Picasso's double-face women such as in La Reve.  Of course the most logical connection for this rounded face is to Delaunay's later work, where she obsessed over multicoloured circles. However I must say I personally prefer her early portraits to her later abstractions. Maybe this is just because the Tate's exhibition contains far too many geometric fabric patterns and circle paintings, so they feel tiresome consumed all at once. Certainly her early portraits are less original, drawing as they do on the booming expressionist and fauvist movements (not to mention Gauguin and countless others). But unfortunately I don't think Delaunay ever really achieved the level of originality her generation sought, so we can only judge on aesthetic criteria and in that case I give the award to her early stuff."

The artist was always obsessed with the perfection her rectangular grids, but never so much as in this series. Usually her lines, drawn by hand, show slight mistakes and varying thickness. In this case she reportedly told the printer to straighten them out for her, virtually removing her hand from the entire process. All that remains is pure visual design.  These prints are a marvel in person. Martin defies reproduction more than most artists, and this series takes the cake. In real life it's hard to tell whether they're just black lines on a monochromatic cream paper (they are) or if there are subtle colours in each of the rectangles. It was just my eye playing tricks on me, but I could have sworn I saw Martin's signature pale blues and pinks dancing across the grid. Knowing Martin's intense subtlety, I imagine my impression was intentional. Probably she derived her colour palette from just such observations."
museum,39n31a,durutticolumn,4,Fri Jun 12 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"IMO it's a mistake to get too bogged down in Guyton's method, though that seems to be the most discussed fact of his work. I would like to concentrate instead on his images as objective artworks, as I had quite a moving experience in front of one today (not the one I linked but something similar).  Here we have two nearly identical rectangles of equal height. They are both gray and anonymous looking, and their simplicity put me in mind of the Twin Towers. The ""paint"" even continues around the side of the canvas, giving the ""towers"" rectangular three-dimensionality. Yet the minimalist grey striped blocks are broken by imperfections suggesting damage, and one of them has lost any support holding it up and appears to be on the verge of tumbling down.  Am I stretching this comparison too far? Perhaps, but to my eyes this is clearly what the piece is about. There's just no way for me to look at the image without thinking of 9/11, and the image was certainly made after 2001 (I wanted to date this 2007 but I'm not 100% sure) so I would imagine I'm not the first person to draw such parallels.  Okay, now a word on technique. Guyton's ""paintings"" (as he calls them) are made by an inkjet printer, and there's a huge amount of chance involved which accounts for the imperfections. The artist completely removes himself from the equation, allowing technology to create the art. On paper it's easy to write this off as a formalist post-conceptual inside joke, but as I said I think the results speak for themselves. Plus the method of creation could be seen to fit my interpretation, but I won't bother teasing out that parallel."

museum,39h45t,rolyathd,2,Thu Jun 11 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"Curator’s description: The drawing shows the buildings around two sides of the broad market square in Abbeville, with the turrets, towers and roof of the (ecclesiastical) north facade of the flamboyant Gothic church of Saint Wulfram appearing above the far side, in the centre. There is a pile of baskets in the near foreground, and another of sacks with a large covered wagon further back.  Cook and Wedderburn dated the drawing to 1868, when Ruskin stayed at Abbeville from 25 August to 21 October (save for three days, 6-8 October, in Paris). In his diary for 19 September, Ruskin described himself 'looking at black signs in square today, and showing [William] Ward how much less dark they were than the open windows' (XIX.xl).  In June 1869, Ruskin displayed the work as no. 43 in his 'Abbeville' exhibition, listing it as 'Abbeville. - St. Vulfran and the Great Square.... Showing gabled wooden houses of the sixteenth century (though all much defaced, the two in the angle are characteristic), and quoined brick and stone houses of the seventeenth century.' He considered referring to it in his first lecture on landscape (26 January 1871), although it was first catalogued in the Oxford collections only in 1872, as no. 61 in the Reference Series, where it was placed alongside drawings of buildings and sculptures in Verona and Venice.  Although pleased with his work at Abbeville, Ruskin seems to have found it difficult to do much which would meet his highest standards, noting in a letter to his mother on 30 September that 'I am well satisfied with the work I am doing, and even with my own power of doing it, if only I can keep myself from avariciously trying to do too much, and working hurriedly. But I can do very little quite well each day; with that little, however, it is my bounden duty to be content' (XIX.xlii) and, just before his departure, on 19 October, 'I am glad to come home, though much mortified at having failed in half my plans, and done nothing compared to what I expected. But it is better than if I were displeased with all I had done. It isn't Turner; and it isn't Correggio; it isn't even Prout; but it isn't bad.' (XIX.xliii.) He seems to repeat this dissatisfaction in a draft for his first lecture on landscape. Discussing pictures that would give 'the kind of feeling that [the viewer] would have had at the place itself - the pleasure and thrill of being there', rather than an accurate depiction of what was there, he wrote 'I confess that there is something in this realistic power which I have never been able to analyze, for it exists sometimes in the slightest amateur sketches, as well as in the most accomplished art. But certainly the first condition of it is that the objects shall impress themselves upon the eye in their own order and way, that you shall not be forced to look at anything, whether you like it or not, any more than in the real scene, and that there shall be no sense either of toil or affectation in the work. (Show Abbeville as failure.)' He presumably felt that it was too laboured in appearance."

The armature was useful (recombine any element, twist and contort until unrecognizable), and yet somehow it always tasted the same. Other devices had been found and quickly chewed upon, dissected, and embalmed. Any creation that somehow managed to be born free from these associations would find itself quickly dried and salted and smoked until it too fit within the abandoned city of ideas. How long had he been wandering in this open plain, his mind parched, his diet consisting solely of old stories thrice regurgitated? Weakened by the sparse food, he fell into a stupor. His mind raged with self-doubt, yet he could not move, frozen into a rictus of rethoughts. At last he began to dream. He was on a wind-mined sandy bed, miles from anything he knew. All his thoughts had tumbled and split, ground down to the finest powder, until nothing remained but the letters themselves. A silence of letters, too small to form words; and with this, a strange new freedom. He felt suspended, above his past, above all the crutches he had relied upon; above the very notion of thought itself. It was all dust beneath him. And yet he knew, even without thinking it, that in time this too would become merely another labyrinth . . ."

museum,39bc5j,thesmallestpizza,4,Wed Jun 10 16:34:38 2015 UTC,"From the Tate website:  In 1959 Twombly executed some of the most spare works of his career, among them the 24 drawings that comprise Poems to the Sea, done on the coast of Italy at Sperlonga. What order of poems, punctuated with numerals and question marks, are these? The sea is reduced to horizon line and word, scribblings and veils of paint against the stark white of paper. A persistent compulsion is invoked in the viewer, the desire to read what is there, but not fully manifest in the artist’s scrawled script. Two words in these drawings emerge into legibility, “time”and “Sappho”, as if washed up on the beach alongside sudden, subtle gem-flashes of colour – blue, orange-yellow, pink – gleaming all the more because of their discretion. In these pages, meaning is endlessly frustrated and pursued. It settles only in the distance, figured perhaps by the horizon lines that move across the top of each of the drawings – in fact, simply grey or blue lines made with a straight edge, but suggesting seascapes at the vanishing point. The flat planes of sea and page have been collapsed. Writing comes in waves, rolling funnels of cursive script, crossed out, erased, enfoamed in satiny greyish-white paint. The signs are given as nascent forms, as gestural indications of ‘the hand’s becoming’, as Roland Barthes so aptly phrased it."

museum,399b7z,rolyathd,2,Wed Jun 10 04:40:16 2015 UTC,"According to Roger Kastel, the artist who made the unforgettable poster to Steven Spielberg‘s Jaws, his original 20 x 30 inch painting went missing around the time of the film’s release.  ….Somewhere along the line, Kastel’s painting disappeared. Kastel remembers his last glimpse of his approximately 20-by-30-inch painting. “It was hanging at the Society of Illustrators in New York,” he says. “It was framed because it was on a book tour, and then it went out to Hollywood for the movie. I expected it to come back, but it never did.”"
museum,399b7z,jerseycityfrankie,2,Wed Jun 10 04:44:21 2015 UTC,"As Kastel remembers it, (Bantam publisher Oscar) Dystel was not a fan of the Doubleday cover and wanted Kastel to look at the cover with fresh eyes. “He wanted me read the book to pick out a new part to illustrate. But, of course, the best part was the beginning, where Chrissie goes into the water nude.” Turns out the Doubleday concept, if not the execution, was not so bad after all. Kastel did a sketch for Dystel and Leone to critique. “The only direction Oscar and Len gave me was to make the shark bigger, and very realistic.”  To research his new assignment, Kastel went to the Museum of Natural History, whose photo department was his frequent source for reference materials. “They didn’t have anything I could use,” he says, “so I asked if they had a shark exhibit. They said they did but that it was closed for cleaning. It was lunchtime, so I went upstairs anyway, and there were all these different stuffed sharks, just laying on boards. I had my camera with me so I took a few pictures. The shark in my painting developed from there. I just tried to paint a ferocious-looking shark that was still realistic.”"

museum,3961o4,Stolen_Car,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:46:26 2015 UTC,"You know when you see one little problem with a painting and then that's all you can see? I looked at this for a while then saw that the shadow along the back of the table and from the yellow chrysanthemum is a totally different shade to all the other shadows. There can't be any reason for this that I can see, and its not expressive or anything, it's just poor workmanship."
museum,3961o4,insoundfromwayout,3,Tue Jun 9 19:56:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry... why do you think it is not expressive?  This is not a hyperrealistic piece: it is art.  Color choice is obviously intentional here.  In fact, with the flower at the top left we see a shadow on top of a shadow.  To me, it comes across as subtly surrealistic."
museum,3961o4,ZippyDan,2,Tue Jun 9 20:35:51 2015 UTC,"You do get shadow on top of shadow, its not surreal.  I dont think its expresive because I cant imagine it could express anything, i think its far more likely just two days painting, and being too lazy to match the colour exactly on day two.  You do get mistakes in paintings, just like any other art, just like a boom mic visible in some part of a movie or some background noise audible on some record. You don't HAVE to find a way to make it expressive - "" oh the director must have wanted a boom mic partly shown in the mirror in order to coment on how as a society we are always listening"" - it can just be what it is: a tiny mistake.   With painting its as if everyone has to talk about it as if it was pure perfection, because its high art, so any problem you find with it is actually just because you dont understand it. Its silly. If you were at university studying art and someone did this piece and asked the class to critique it, you would say ""that shadow is a bit off"", you wouldnt just assume that they had done it for some mysterious expressive reason."
museum,3961o4,insoundfromwayout,2,Tue Jun 9 21:29:33 2015 UTC,"I definitely hear ya, sometimes we over-analyze and attach meaning to things that are meaningless.  Maybe it's supposed to be darker there, maybe not.  It is odd that the only wilting flower is in that portion, also with a shadow.  Not that it means anything.  Maybe they did just do it in 2 days as practice and never anticipated anyone giving a fuck, or just didn't care.    I didn't really notice the inconsistency at first.  It does seem to frame the table in a certain way.  At the end of the day it doesn't bother me, because overall it looks pretty cool and is visually stimulating.  Error or not, I enjoy the piece, and that's all that matters to me."
museum,3961o4,raffytraffy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:24:07 2015 UTC,"You do get shadow on top of shadow, but not in this situation.  The whole shadow situation doesn't make sense."
museum,3961o4,ZippyDan,4,Tue Jun 9 21:41:54 2015 UTC,"For the sake of argument let's assume this light is natural and it's coming from the window. Where the still life is in direct light, there is a higher level of refracted light around the objects. The darker shadow cast reads as an angle of the window sill throwing those objects and that space beyond the shadow into dramatic contrast with the rest of the painting. So choosing a darker tone is merely a means to contextualize one perceived range of values against another i.e. a painterly technique mimicking an optical perception. That said, I'd say it's a secondary discussion to the artist's true intent here. This is clearly a painting whose objects, their disbursement, and the affectation of their composition that brings the work it's significance. It reads more as a conglomerate of studies that are placed in this non-comformist table space (see the post it notes v. the blue koi bowls--they are drawn from two separate perspectives). Ergo I'd label it surreal (per ZippyDan) as it seeks to be descriptive not in the sense of verisimilitude or hyper-realism, but to bring these things together to point out some internal narrative or give an impression of tenuousness and distance. It's a painting that reminds me of Hockney or Theibaud, or even whose purpose is illustrative, not illuminative. All accusations of poor workmanship are unto yourselves and practices you uphold. They aren't constructive to proper reading of a painting, whether good or bad, and only reflect personal neuroses."

The word ""schmagoo"" is outdated slang for heroin that I think was around in the 1960s. And it doesn't really have anything to do with the paintings themselves, I mean, heroin per se. I think I liked the fact that it is such a goofy word that's used to describe such a dark and destructive force. As I was working on these modular, monochromatic, stacked paintings, I was drawing on the side. And the drawings just sort of took over. I was more engaged with that at the time than I was with the paintings. The idea was just to somehow invest in the drawings in a way, to give them the sort of scale and physicality of paintings. I did want to make paintings that were as direct and crude and simple as I could make them. I just liked the idea that they were there and there was no ornamentation, really, and they couldn't be convoluted by color. I wanted this directness and immediate quality that a drawing has."

museum,38wfvd,kajimeiko,2,Sun Jun 7 12:12:14 2015 UTC,"The Triumphal Arch is one of the largest prints ever produced. It was commissioned by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (1459-1519). The programme was devised by the court historian and mathematician, Johann Stabius, who explains underneath that it was constructed after the model of 'the ancient triumphal arches of the Roman Emperors'.  Above the central arch, entitled 'Honour and Might', is a genealogy of Maximilian in the form of a family tree. Above the left arch, 'Praise', and the right arch, 'Nobility', are represented events from his life. These are flanked by busts of emperors and kings on the left, and a column of Maximilian's ancestors on the right. The outermost towers on either side show scenes from the private life of Maximilian.  The architect and painter Jörg Kölderer designed the overall appearance of the structure, and Dürer designed the individual scenes and architectural elements, some of which he sub-contracted to his pupils Hans Springinklee and Wolf Traut, and Albrecht Altdorfer of Regensburg.  The date 1515, which appears on the Arch, refers to the completion of the designs; the blocks were cut by Hieronymus Andreae of Nuremberg between 1515 and 1517.

museum,38tdji,Maudhiko,6,Sun Jun 7 04:22:16 2015 UTC,"This isn't that skilled, really. If it wasn't a Picasso no one would care about it. It's also saccharine as fuck.  The proportions are off (how big is the dying girl's head?) and the drawing is poor. It looks like a slightly above average student work of the late 19th-century."
museum,38tdji,morecabernet,-1,Sun Jun 7 08:53:08 2015 UTC,Not many high school kids could paint that. Its incredibly skilled for a 16 year old
museum,38tdji,aonemonkey,5,Sun Jun 7 09:40:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not referring to contemporary high school kids, I'm talking about pre-20th-century ateliers where apprenticing kids at 11 or 13 wasn't that unusual. Picasso's father was an art teacher and Picasso would have trained from a very young age.  Even if it's skilled for a 16 year old, that doesn't make it a particularly skilled painting generally. And this was about as good as he got with his academic work.   This isn't to disparage his later work. Which we all know is incredibly important for inspiring so many of the great works of 20th-century art."
museum,38tdji,morecabernet,3,Sun Jun 7 10:34:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, but would like to add that his later work is most often judged on subject and style and how it impacted the world, which is great but if we really look at his work today it does lack a lot of technical skill. I don't feel like it holds up over time for anything other than being innovative. And let's be honest, most people see him today as having done this on his own and as someone who broke the mold in a truly genius manner, but he cultivated that image purposely. Picasso's true talents were not in art, but it branding and marketing"

I understand art theory and history very well actually since I have a BFA in painting, have studied art history well beyond what my degree required, was the preparator for a small fine arts museum, and was the assistant curator for a couple of small galleries. I'm not saying that Picasso didn't make a HUGE impact on the world of art, I'm saying that his later work did not hold up technique or subject wise and yet still people are sucking at his teat.   So really, I'm being downvoted because no one on reddit cares to hear a differing opinion on the longevity of Picasso's work. It happens every time and at this point is does make me laugh"

As ‘Expectation’, in spite of its simple pictorial centre, can appear abstract on first encounter through the sheer force of its method. An impact stemming from Bogomazov’s employment of Pointlist techniques. Pointlism being a process perfected by the French Post-Impressionist Georges Seurat wherein it is the glow around a point of colour that is heralded as key. A feature that can be heightened when that dot is on a white background which reflects rather than absorbs light, giving a distinct fizz and luminosity to images.'

museum,38ixrh,WandererAboveFog,2,Thu Jun 4 15:02:43 2015 UTC,"Howdy all and here I return with another Friedrich!  Not a lot of context on this one as it seems to be one of the Friedrich's that little is written or interpreted about because it is such a timid and lovely painting of two swans in the natural habitat that there isn't much else to really say! All that remains to huddle around it and feel the same warmth with the ones you love in the places that you adore.  Ahh who am I kidding, of course there are interpretations:  Börsch-Supan  Understanding Friedrich's work (or of any other artist's) is a thorny subject as only they really know the context, motivation and reason behind it but some Friedrich scholars such as Helmut Börsch-Supan, read into Friedrich's art like it is some sort of Rosetta Stone. He believed that the cryptic components within Friedrich's work, once identified, could spell out a single, lucid meaning.  In the example of Swans in the Reeds, Börsch-Supan sees the work as a happy anticipation of death since swans are reputed to sing most beautifully before they die, hence the phrase ""swansong"". Moreover, this swansong would be heard against a background glimmer of red sky behind the reeds - a sunrise that would finally obliterate the barely visible crescent moon and would therefore be a symbol of the Resurrection, fusing Christian and natural cycles.   A Beautiful Death  Friedrich also famously painted owls and full moons and owls with full moons but with those works, and indeed Swans in the Reeds, we are not exposed to the dark grimace of death but the wise awareness of the transcendental peace and the wholeness that death carries and is what we all must face.  Influence  Most famously the painter Carl Gustav Carus also painted a similar painting to Friedrich's titled A Swan Among the Reeds, by Moonlight. Carus was a close friend and follower of fellow German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich and absorbed his stirring elegiac nature imagery. Just as in Friedrich's paintings, the moon in this drawing symbolizes impending death. The swan, about to take flight, evokes the soul's taking leave of the body. Carus drew this as a birthday present for his daughter Clara as she lay ill with the typhus that would take her life three months later.

An influential school of formalist art critics, led by Clement Greenberg, argued that the torch for Modernist painting had passed to hard-edge, colorfield painters such as Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, and Jules Olitski. Louis's Alpha Pi is part of the Unfurled series of 1960-61 ,regarded by the artist as his most ambitious works, Louis poured rivulets of pure color in scarcely touching, layered banks across the lower vectors of huge rectangular canvases, creating vast yet vibrant voids in their startlingly ""empty"" centers. No figures, however distended; no implied dimensional space, however irrational. No symbols, no associations. Just pure color, disposed across unmarked extension, via saturated acrylic seeping into lightly primed canvas. Critic Michael Fried was moved to comment:""In the unfurleds Louis made major art out of what might be called the firstness of marking as such...The banked rivulets--here again their vibrant, biting color is crucial--open up the picture-plane more radically than ever before, as though seeing the first marking we are for the first time shown the void.""   Excerpt from Contemporary Art by Terry Smith. Alpha Pi looks almost identical to Gamma Tau, and the picture of the latter was  higher resolution."

museum,383fxo,thomaskyd,2,Tue Jun 2 01:06:50 2015 UTC,"Actually if you took a photo with all the parameters the same it would look surprisingly different from this painting. What Bodin captures here is a little more obvious if you look at some of his other work in this series (example 1 example 2), it attempts to say something about form, color, sight, subjective experience. Hyperrealism in a lot of ways is an attempt to subtly examine the actual experience of a real world visual as it becomes internalized through memory and focus and thereby distorted and yet paradoxically clarified. It may not be your cup of tea, but it's not just onanistic self-congratulatory aping of a photograph, it's a real attempt to do what visual artists do, and that is present us with an image that makes us think."

First trained as a woodcarver; later studied painting and developed style involving intense color and thick, gestural impasto. Changed name to Nolde, his birthplace, in 1902. Invited to join Brücke in 1906 by Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, who introduced him to woodcut. In return, taught Brücke members his innovative etching techniques. An independent personality, left Brücke after only one year, but remained friendly with the group. Expelled from Berlin Secession in 1910 after vehemently criticizing Max Liebermann for rejecting Expressionist paintings. Explored typical Expressionist themes of urban nightlife, but had a more abiding devotion to biblical scenes and northern landscapes, as well as ""primitive"" and phantasmagorical subjects. In 1913–14, with wife, Ada, traveled overland via Russia to German New Guinea, accompanying a German colonial expedition. Subsequently made paintings, watercolors, and prints based on travels."

Virtually unknown outside of Portugal, Luzia has moved from conceptual art to minimalism. Her earlier works were inspired greatly by the likes of Frank Stella and John McCracken.  Luzia has stated that her upbringing in the rural mountainous region of Serra da Estrela, Portugal has been a recurring influence throughout her career and many pieces have been focused on mountain ranges or other natural landscapes. “As a young girl—before having the words to describe it—I realized that the beauty of nature was no more than varied arrangements of light and line. I want my art to mimic nature in its rawest form.""  Since the mid 90s Luzia has increasingly been working with a computer for her art and has stated that she still often uses her 1995 CorelDRAW software for the majority of this work."

museum,37famh,durutticolumn,5,Wed May 27 05:10:24 2015 UTC,"There is sometimes validity in 'reframing' work in a new context.  Warhol's work was an excellent example of taking something and making meta-statements about the medium which he was quoting to speak about our media-hungry, mass-production culture, etc.   But there's little re-contextualizing evident in this work in order to call this new work.    Perhaps this work is a reflection of our times, our 'information age' and the fact that we're bored, between major wars and with an excess of resources and time.  We're a culture without moorings, inside a drifting box with internal reflective surfaces, where provenance and history is irrelevant.  Our art consists of quoting, aping, appropriating, the listless musings of a people who have replaced a search for true genius with the search for the perfect photo-realistic portrait of Heisenberg.     So perhaps in some current constricted view this work has some relevance, as decided for us by a clutch of art critics in New York City.  The only statement you can glean from the work is: look what we can do now.  The best we could do is for another artist to take all of Prince's so-called 'work' and simply place their own name on it, taking it to another ridiculous level but would have the benefit of illustrating the absurdity of it all...and our times.  At the very least there would be a statement being made, and might restore the necessary meta element present that is currently absent.  But no matter: by the next great world crisis it will all be forgotten as trivial and self-referential reflections of a bored culture in a time with no defining moments of their own.  TL;DR - This stuff sux; Warhol was the last artist before it all stopped making sense; The next great art will be after the end times"
museum,37famh,maoista,5,Wed May 27 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I've heard people argue Warhol was the end of art but usually they dislike his work. But do you really think there been no good art since Warhol? There's been so much diverse work by so many artists, I find that hard to believe."

Just this alone justifies its existence. It doesn't make it good, but it makes actually art."

museum,37famh,thewanderingent,5,Tue Jun 9 09:31:12 2015 UTC,"Prince's latest series of Instagram appropriation has made quite the splash on the internet, quickly becoming famous enough to justify putting one in the museum. Though I personally agree with most people that they are garbage, I think they are worthy of close examination and have perhaps been misunderstood.  First of all, I think it's silly that the common headline about this series decries Prince's ""theft"" of other people's photographs. Clearly the photograph is only a part of the whole work. Prince's enigmatic comments seem to reflect the subjects' absurd Instagram handles, and he's certainly fulfilled the main requirement of appropriation artists: commenting on the appropriated image.  The time marker adds an extra note of absurdity, reminding us that this is a snapshot of a moment in time. The one thing I do find interesting about this work is how it shows an evolution from Prince's earlier work that has been caused by the advent of technology. His famous Marlborough Man appropriated an object (magazine ad) that was ephemeral, but the image itself was eternal. Now even the image changes, and if we looked at this post online today it will never match the image. It is in a sense an image that can never be reproduced.  However, I think overall this is a failure, as with most of Prince's work. It's got slightly more interesting ideas than his other stuff (though it's only interesting because of how it reflects his career trajectory). But it's also supremely ugly, far uglier than his other stuff. There is no reason this image needs to be so ugly, unless Prince is criticize Instagram in a manner reminiscent of /r/lewronggeneration"
museum,37famh,kajimeiko,2,Wed May 27 05:20:53 2015 UTC,"Aesthetically, some of the images are beautiful, but Prince didn't take the photos himself. I think the social media-type layout is ugly, even if it does reflect the times, and the comments/emojis make me hate it even more. The only emotion he is evoking from me is the frustration that someone can make so much money taking other peoples' images and the sadness that he neither acknowledges their work or compensate them in any way. It wouldn't bother me nearly as much if he, for example, made a donation to charity on behalf of the original photographers. Without acknowledging their contribution to his work with gratitude, he comes across as a selfish and opportunistic creative predator."

Since I believe in the death of the author and all that, I don't want to judge this artwork negatively just because the artist is a bad dude.

What it is that sets his work apart is indescribable. But that's kind of the point of Expressionist painting, to depict what words can't. All I can really say about this tree is it doesn't look like any other painting I know of; the background is closer to Munch than most German Expressionists at the time."

In Portrait of a Woman, viewers see these principles manifested in the single line that softly delineates the contours of the sitter’s face, neck and shoulder, a technique that Weston would later repeat in some of his most iconic still-lifes of shells and vegetables. By doing so, Weston isolated the form and allowed it to reveal itself organically. Indeed, Portrait of a Woman epitomizes the merging of Weston’s early Pictorialist sensibility with his evolving Modernist aesthetic.   PHILLIPS"

Henry Hensche took what Monet did (painting pictures using color variation and not tonal variations) and i believe added a few areas to this approach of painting.  Making sure no plane or separate spacial area contained the same color as objects/things went back or as form turned areas had to exist in their on color space.  Never taking color from one object,  say the buildings and using the color found there in the building and using the same color in any other spacial plane/section other than the said building.    Monet was on to something new and ground breaking one could not expect him to solve every single problem to this approach to painting. So his painting will have areas that just could not contain every solution but they are beautiful works."

You have kind of a technical opinion which is just axiomatic and seems entirely preferential. The preferred technique and stylistic choice do not make one an improvement on the other, really, but remain different from one another and appeal differently. It really just seems they're each accomplishing different things, and on a technical level Monet could have invented that style were he inclined to go in that direction. But he was doing his own thing."

Hanna Hirsch was a daughter of music publisher Abraham Hirsch. She was a friend of Eva Bonnier, and they followed each other through the painting school of August Malmström, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. Hanna Hirsch studied in Paris from 1885 until 1887 and shared studio with Bonnier for part of that time. She had her portrait of the Finnish sculptor Venny Soldan (now in the Gothenburg Art Museum) accepted to the Paris Salon in 1887. The portrait is realistic and unconventional for its time in portraying a female artist at work (sitting on the floor with clay in her hands) rather than in proper bourgeois attire.  As was the case with most other Swedish artists of her generation, her painting stood closer to the French juste milieu painters than to the most impressionists; nevertheless, the thickly applied paint she used to show specks of light on the white table cloth on her 1887 painting Frukostdags (Breakfast time) (in Nationalmuseum, Stockholm) provoked one critic to comment that she had probably used the cloth to clean her brushes.

Apparently he claimed that after his plane was shot down he was rescued by Tatar tribesmen, who wrapped him in fat to save his life.  So I guess this fat is a reference to that story? I'm still kind of mystified by Beuys; I just don't get his work. Presumably this chair is supposed to represent the life-saving power of comfort. But what's the wire all about?

museum,36wrp4,durutticolumn,1 point,Fri May 22 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"Fat functions as an insulator- survival through warmth. The wire functions as a antennae used to locate or navigate the wounded and lost body as it undergoes transmutation. The chair (or 'stool'- which is a play on the double meaning of stool being shit) is representative of human physicality.   A wounded body is unstable, and Beuys believed in 'showing your wound', his sickliness was an essential stage in the development of the soul. The fat occupies the space of the chair which holds our most 'base' bodily functions. Base matter can transmutate so that the insulated/isolated body can transcend the physicality of human suffering.  Beuys was a mystic, but also a showman, and an important figure for the German people trying to make sense of the atrocities of war.   He was the German Warhol, and like Warhol, he needed to transform the ugly physicality of the commonplace into something of a higher order- like art."

museum,36qom3,Stolen_Car,2,Thu May 21 10:42:28 2015 UTC,"In the years 1889−91, Munch lived in France, supported by an artist’s bursary from the Norwegian state. When cholera broke out in Paris in December 1889, Munch moved to St. Cloud, outside the city. There he rented the floor above a café, which commanded a beautiful view of the Seine. In the atmospheric and melancholy Night in St. Cloud, we see both the inside of his dark room and the view through the window late at night. At the window sits a man lost in thought...  ... “The subjects of painting will no longer be interiors, with people reading and women knitting. / They will be living, breathing people who feel and love and suffer–. / People will understand what is sacred in these things and doff their hats as in a church.” This is followed by a remark which the artist dates to 1889−1900: “I paint not what I see but what I saw.” In these statements Munch registers his distance from the accurate depictions of realism. Night in St. Cloud was painted at around the time he wrote this “manifesto”. But it took several years before Munch seriously rejected the inner world in favour of the exterior one.

museum,36m9gq,Hyas,5,Wed May 20 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"In 1877 the twenty-one year old Sargent spent the summer in Cancale on the coast of Brittany sketching fisherfolk. He sent his first completed painting, “Fishing for Oysters at Cancale,” a finished sketch, to New York for display at the newly-formed, avant garde Society of American Artists from March 6 to April 5, 1878. Sargent submitted the second painting, “Oyster Gatherers of Cancale” (Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), a larger, more finished version of the same subject, to the 1878 Paris Salon, where it was awarded an Honorable Mention. Critics praised “Fishing for Oysters at Cancale,” the first Sargent painting to be exhibited in America, for its silvery hue and almost palpable marine atmosphere. Samuel Colman, a landscape painter twenty-fours years Sargent’s senior, bought it for $200 as a standard to emulate. Sargent’s choice of subject was not revolutionary - a similar scene of oyster harvesters had previously won a medal at the Salon. However, his ability to paint the reflections in the tidal pools and the light sparkling on the figures and clouds dazzled viewers, clearly demonstrating that his talents extended beyond portraiture.  Provenance The artist; to Samuel Colman, Newport, R.I., and New York, by 1880; to Susan Travers, Newport, R.I., by January 1903; to Mary Appleton, Newport, R.I., New York, and Boston, December 1904 (bequest of Susan Travers); to MFA, 1935, gift of Mary Appleton."

museum,36oooy,durutticolumn,4,Wed May 20 22:38:20 2015 UTC,"I would like the museum plaque next to this painting to tell the story of some ancient Greek minimalism:   Apelles was a contemporary of Protogenes, whose reputation he advocated. Pliny also recorded an anecdote that was making the rounds among Hellenistic connoisseurs of the first century CE: Apelles travelled to Protogenes' home in Rhodes to make the acquaintance of this painter he had heard so much about. Arriving at Protogenes' studio, he encountered an old woman who told him that Protogenes was out and asked for his name so she could report who had enquired after him. Observing in the studio a panel Protogenes had prepared for a painting, Apelles walked over to the easel, and taking up a brush told the servant to tell Protogenes ""this came from me,"" and drew in colour an extremely fine line across the panel. When Protogenes returned, and the old woman explained what had taken place, he examined the line and pronounced that only Apelles could have done so perfect a piece of work; Protogenes then dipped a brush into another colour and drew a still finer line above the first one, and asked his servant to show this to the visitor should he return. When Apelles returned, and was shown Protogenes' response, ashamed that he might be bettered, he drew in a third colour an even finer line between the first two, leaving no room for another display of craftsmanship. On seeing this, Protogenes admitted defeat, and went out to seek Apelles and meet him face-to-face. Pliny claims that this very painting had been part of the collection of Julius Caesar, but was destroyed when Caesar's mansion on the Palatine Hill burned down."

museum,36kklk,SpaceGhostDerrp,2,Wed May 20 01:48:01 2015 UTC,"In 1887, Sargent made his first visit to the United States as a working artist. In New York, Newport, and Boston, Sargent painted more than twelve formal portraits, aided in his endeavors by author and friend Henry James’s description of his talent and his previous success in the Parisian art world. During this trip, Sargent painted Louise Pomeroy Inches of Boston. He arrived in the city early in 1887 and stayed with his friends Mary Louisa and Edward Boit (who had returned from Paris in 1886, bringing with them Sargent’s 1882 portrait of their daughters. The Boits lived around the corner from Charles and Louise Inches and it is likely that Boit, who was Charles Inches’s first cousin, introduced them to Sargent and may have encouraged the idea of a portrait. Boit documented the Inches’ commission in his diary and noted that it was completed by Christmas Eve, when he went to their home at 88 Charles Street to see “Charley’s wife’s portrait by Sargent,” describing it as “a beautiful picture.”  Louise Pomeroy Inches (1861–1933) was born in Troy, Pennsylvania, the youngest of three daughters of Horace and Emma Pomeroy. When she was twenty-two, she married Dr. Charles Inches of Boston, a Harvard-educated physician twenty years her senior, who become known for giving free medical aid to the poor. At the time she sat for her portrait, Louise Inches was a prominent society hostess well known for her beauty and the mother of two young sons. She was pregnant with her third child when she posed for Sargent, wearing a fashionably daring red evening gown that had been made with detachable panels to accommodate her pregnancies. (The garment, which still survives in a private collection, is an American copy of a design by the French couturier Worth.) Apparently the artist and sitter enjoyed each other’s company; both were accomplished musicians and are said to have played piano duets together.  Sargent concentrated his attention on his sitter’s face and elegantly attenuated neck, painting her dress and arms more quickly and sketchily. The three-quarter length format, blank background, and slightly turned pose suggest French eighteenth-century portraits, which Sargent—and many of his patrons—admired. This reference is enhanced by the original frame selected for this painting, a decorative eighteenth-century style gilt frame crowned by an elaborate three-dimensional ribbon. The aristocratic fashionability of Sargent’s Boston portraits, including Mrs. Inches, was praised in the local press when they were first exhibited at the St. Botolph Club, in Sargent’s first solo exhibition, early in 1888. The critic for the Boston Evening Traveller declared that this portrait was “one of the most brilliant pieces of coloring that has been painted since the days of Titian.” Writer Susan Hale noted, however, that many onlookers were “furious at the want of justice done to their friends … between those who thought them too beautiful and those who thought them not beautiful enough, all just speculation of method and execution was lost.”  Many viewers gossiped about their peer: “I think Mrs. Inches looks as if she would bring you the head of Holofernes for the asking,” Fanny Lang wrote astringently to Isabella Stewart Gardner.  Mrs. Inches often made the painting available for loan, although Sargent advised against asking for it again for a 1924 exhibition, as “rather makes a condition about my going to see if there is not something wrong about her nose—& I haven’t time.”  Despite such criticisms, Sargent’s image of Louise Inches projects both virtue and style. Her demure gaze and pose contrast with her brilliant crimson evening gown with its daring décolletage. In this way, she personifies the bold innocence that contemporary writers, including Sargent’s friend Henry James, found peculiarly American.  http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/mrs-charles-e-inches-louise-pomeroy-35295"

Taking aside for a second the simple fact that there is a corpse-like dummy being flung high by women who seem enchanted by the act, it is the very moment that Goya picks to crystallise that lends the image such a sinister quality.  Had the mannequin been dropping down head over heels or in some other less recognisably human pose, its discerning qualities could perhaps have been discarded in favour of the jubilation being had. Yet by showing ‘him’ behaving anatomically quite how a person would look in thrown upward, Goya revels in the disjunction between the real and the imitative. Look at the slack, unresponsive limbs. The buckled shoes pointing out askance beneath ornate britches. It’s lifeless, painted face that arches back on what looks like a broken neck with a ponytail swinging behind. The figure, of course, isn’t real and feels nothing. But the subtle blurring keeps us as entranced as the foursome.'

The artist gives centre stage not to the large crowd of merry-makers, but to a small group of masked figures dancing. In Goya's work, however, masks invariably serve to conceal deception, malice and demonic forces. The gloomy masked carnival signals danger'  And, shortly after:  'The carnival celebrations in Madrid culminated on Ash Wednesday in a procession with dancing and makes. A heathen spring festival and a parody of religious processions. Goya sensed demonic forces behind masks and costumes'"

Roughly sixty-five finished drawings were enlarged from the shelter sketchbook studies, seventeen of which were purchased by the WAAC and following their exhibition at the National Gallery in London were distributed amongst English museums.   Moore was already a successful artist, but the public reception of these drawings effected an immediate change in the perception of his work and he was able to make a living without the support of teaching for the first time.

The war brought out and encouraged the humanist side in one’s work’ (the artist cited in Roger Berthoud, The Life of Henry Moore, Faber and Faber, London, 1987, p. 176)."

museum,36g464,rolyathd,2,Tue May 19 03:01:12 2015 UTC,"Demobilised in October 1919, William Roberts both worked and played hard throughout the 1920s.  ‘The quintessential bohemian experience offered by hangouts like the Harlequin – cramped interiors overflowing with colourful agitated groups – encouraged Roberts to introduce his own social life into his pictures and to extend his range of subject matter in a more figurative direction…Bohemia became Roberts’ central theme in the 1920s and many of his best pictures from these years are imbued with its raucous, carefree atmosphere’ (A. Gibbons Williams, William Roberts An English Cubist, Lund Humphries, 2004, p. 59).  In works such as The Guitar Player and The Dance Club, 1923 (Leeds Museums and Galleries), Roberts perpetuates the Vorticists’ aim to embrace the fundamental nature of modern city life.  To this end, Roberts developed a Post-Cubist style of elongated, angular figures in tightly conceived groups to populate his dramatically staged scenes of urban entertainment.  In the present work, Roberts colour codes the figures and their surroundings to create a sense of depth and recession in the midst of a complex design. The sofa in the back, right corner, the table at which the guitarist sits and the rug upon which the foreground figure reclines are all mere outlines, but are given shape and form by the subtle watercolour tones of pink, blue and yellow, as well as shadows cast by dramatic lighting.  The figures in these peripheral areas are almost golden as if cast in a different light. In the central and most crowded group, the figures have darker outlines, but less colouring making the forms more three-dimensional.  Arranged in a variety of poses, their linear faces are more defined and expressive.  The Guitar Player, as Study for ‘At the Hippodrome’ (Cecil Higgins Art Gallery, Bedford), is highly finished yet squared up for transfer, presumably to canvas.  A painted version however, is not known to exist."

museum,36c0h6,morecabernet,2,Mon May 18 08:29:21 2015 UTC,"The values (lights and darks) have a charm to them. If you were really looking out the window everything would be much more contrasted. Manet lightens everything, while still hitting a few real darks, to give the effect of a street flooded with sunlight.  I find the draftsmanship erratic. Some parts are very well observed, others less so. Painting out of the window with everything moving would have been difficult though. I doubt any of these people were posing for him.  The composition is strange, as you noticed. Yet it is balance and it works, so that makes it much more interesting, in my opinion. I see a depth in the foreground from the perspective lines, and the ladder overlapping the cast shadow from the one-legged guy.  It's by a very important painter, it's owned by a very important museum, and it resembles the Impressionist style that is currently very popular. If you take away the painter's name, the museum, and the date, it's an interesting painting, though maybe not a great painting. Art is often about the context though."

To this viewer it just doesn't seem to be a mirror...contrary to most conventional opinion.  Making the presumption that Manet would have painted relatively accurately, a reflection in a mirror perpendicular to the viewer wouldn't be offset the way it is here.

museum,3679rf,maoista,2,Sun May 17 00:39:31 2015 UTC,"The central figure stands before a mirror, although critics—accusing Manet of ignorance of perspective and alleging various impossibilities in the painting—have debated this point since the earliest reviews were published. In 2000, however, a photograph taken from a suitable point of view of a staged reconstruction was shown to reproduce the scene as painted by Manet.[3] According to this reconstruction, ""the conversation that many have assumed was transpiring between the barmaid and gentleman is revealed to be an optical trick—the man stands outside the painter's field of vision, to the left, and looks away from the barmaid, rather than standing right in front of her.""[3] As it appears, the observer should be standing to the right and closer to the bar than the man whose reflection appears at the right edge of the picture. This is an unusual departure from the central point of view usually assumed when viewing pictures drawn according to perspective.  Asserting the presence of the mirror has been crucial for many modern interpreters.[4] It provides a meaningful parallel with Las Meninas, a masterpiece by an artist Manet admired, Diego Velázquez. There has been a considerable development of this topic since Michel Foucault broached it in his book The Order of Things (1966).[5]  Wikipedia   Though I'm not entirely convinced Manet wouldn't have altered the realism for effect. Luncheon on the Grass is famously a totally fractured space, the painting's most famous element."

There really isn't enough in common between this painting and Las Meninas to convince me that there's some reason to attribute some particular influence in this case.    Again, just my opinion!

The use of black as both emptiness and material that obliterates the day's news, in the same way the grand vastness of space obliterates human time and little rock we find ourselves adrift on. It’s a very sentimental but direct painting, one that is wimpy, ephemeral (the newsprint will slowly eat itself) but visually striking, and soon to be lost.   There is something about the way Thek paints where each stroke highlights itself as a gentle touch (the fragility of the paper demands a lightness) and a deliberate but unsentimental directness, not belabored. And it feels like you could measure the actual amount of time it took to paint by the number of marks. You could imagine the painting made over breakfast and coffee. Time which would become a very important subject to Thek for all sorts of reasons, and many reflections on death throughout his career."

The New Yorker had this to say about the paintings:   The most resourceful abstract painter alive, Oehlen wows with big canvases that alchemize four elements: collaged sheets of Spanish billboard advertising, flatly painted schemes of miscellaneous bold motifs, considerable amounts of blank white, and spates of skittery or splotchy, rousingly lyrical brushwork whose sensual intelligence recalls Cy Twombly at his finest. It’s uncanny how the little gestures—in peachy or lavenderish hues, with the odd spark of cadmium or of thalo green—trump the huge and powerful graphic designs that underlie and surround them. It’s as if a NASA rocket blasted off to release, into orbit, a nosegay."

I think these paintings proved you could make big abstract fuck-all paintings and have your cool too. I think they set of chain reaction of a lot of bad (hip) abstraction we see today and look a lot less interesting because of it.  These look hip now, but I don't remember them as that at the time.

I think the color is actually slight more accurate here but a worse reproduction.  The stilted figures adhering to geometric principles (Piero wrote several geometric treatises) make for a very strange and mysterious painting. The way the four saint's heads hover at the same height, encircling the child. All with disinterested expressions.  The Madonna holding the flower in such a precise and unnatural way creates this super odd suspense.   Then the small strange details, like the right front angel ever so gingerly holding the madonna's pinky. Like WTF is that?   No figure engages the others, and they all seem contained in their own world.   The shadow that doesn't make sense on the small stairs at the bottom. The fact that their feet don't have enough room.

museum,362xtr,promethiac,3,Sat May 16 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"Bruegel the Elder is my favorite!    I made up a game that I call ""Fantasy Art Auctions"" - I gave myself $20 Million to spend on art.  Sometime late 2013 or early 2014 I bought The Bird Trap for something like $2,800,000.  Then, last summer, that same painting sold for $6,667,928.  So that was cool..."
museum,362xtr,fresh_9OOO,3,Fri May 15 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"Bruegel is my all time favorite painter.   Somewhat related, there's a novel called Headlong by Michael Frayn that involves a lost Seasons painting.  Also, I once found a giant framed print of The Triumph of Death in the alley behind my house. It's hanging in my garage.  I went to The Prado to see it and I still think about being in the same room as that work and the Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch."

museum,361r0u,admirallackbar,2,Fri May 15 11:01:24 2015 UTC,"Short biography here. American painter.   Donna Schuster attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts School where she worked with noted American Impressionists Edmund C. Tarbell (1862-1938) and Frank W. Benson (1862-1951). In 1912 she joined William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) on a painting tour of Belgium. After returning to the United States, she moved to Los Angeles. She studied with Chase once more at the Carmel Summer School in 1913.  In 1923 Schuster built a studio-home in the hills of Griffith Park and joined the faculty of Otis Art Institute. She also had a second home and studio in Laguna Beach where she spent her summers. She was a member of the Group of Eight, who considered themselves modernist in their use of rich color, expressive techniques, and an emphasis on the figure. She also was a great admirer of Claude Monet and, in fact, built a lily pond in her backyard that she used for a series of lily pond studies, not unlike those of Monet. Toward the end of the 1920s Schuster studied with modernist artist Stanton Macdonald-Wright (1890-1973), leading her to experiment with Cubism and later, Abstract Expressionism. Schuster was described by her fellow artist Luvena Vysekal as “emitting an effulgence of exuberance that exhausts the onlooker.”"

museum,362o8x,giovolo,2,Fri May 15 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"So probably some context here would be helpful. Sugimoto somehow got access to Fox-Talbot's earliest negatives (the earliest examples of photography ever) and was (somehow) allowed to make positive prints from them, despite their extreme extreme fragility.  His (Sugimotos) are the only known positive prints of those images, and supposedly prints (the positives) not even Fox-Talbot would have seen, though this seems impossible... but maybe there is some info I am missing about the process."
museum,35z3hx,erfgoed,18,Thu May 14 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Uh, so, I think it should be noted this painting was destroyed in 1945 and was almost certainly in color. Though maybe I am wrong? There are a few colorized versions on the internet, though im not sure how accurate they are."

museum,3603dj,durutticolumn,2,Thu May 14 23:28:14 2015 UTC,"As part of the British Library's exhibition celebrating the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, Cornelia Parker was commissioned to produce Magna Carta (An Embroidery). The 13 meter long piece is a hand-sewn reproduction of the Wikipedia article about the great charter as it appeared on June 15 2014, with individual words sewn by over 200 people including Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, and anonymous British prisoners. See more detailed shots on this BBC article.  I think this is interesting because it examines the conflicting traditions of monarchy and democracy embodied by Magna Carta. We tend to see it as the foundation of Western democracy, and that is expressed here through the collaborative nature of the piece - both in that it was sewn by many people, and it celebrates the greatness of Wikipedia (surely the most important historical document of our own age).  Yet Magna Carta didn't really create democracy, it was just a power-grab by the aristocracy. That is reflected here by the fact that only a select group (including many celebrities, the modern equivalent of aristocracy) were invited to participate. Additionally, Parker casts herself in the role of queen, retaining complete control over the whole piece. This can be seen by the fact that it's ""part of a series of articles on Monarchy"", not articles on democracy. Though Magna Carta stripped the king of some powers, it could be argued that the alternative was a total coup and Magna Carta is one of the main reasons Britain's monarchy survives to this day.  The only thing that gives me pause here is I don't know how it fits into Parker's ouvre. I don't want to set limits on what artists can do, but Parker has carved out a specific niche for herself and her constant focus on that indefinable Parkeresque quality makes all of her work better. This piece shares many of her themes about making the transitory permanent, but somehow it just doesn't feel like her."

Morandi rejected the dominant modes of his time to focus on his own singular vision, which involved endless reworkings of still lives composed of a very few items rearranged. He lived quietly in Bologna.  I love all the subtle oddness of this painting. The way shadows don't align well and the backround jars seem tilting forward into the space of the front row. The way all Morandi paintings seem as though painted through warbled glass. The dull flatness of it. The wobbling brushwork. The way the brown of the table surrounds the vase on the left. A Mysterious little painting."

museum,35s5gi,rolyathd,2,Wed May 13 01:34:14 2015 UTC,"Antonio del Castillo y Saavedra was one of the few distinctive Spanish Baroque painters who spent his career outside of the country's cosmopolitan centers of Madrid or Seville. Born in Córdoba, he received his early training with his father and later studied with a painter of religious figures. By 1638 Castillo was described as a master painter. He specialized in religious works in fresco and oil on canvas. Many of his paintings still can be seen in and around Córdoba, particularly in the city's cathedral. In the solidity and weight of his figure modeling, Castillo displayed the influence of Sevillan painter Francisco de Zurbarán, while Bartolomé Estebán Murillo's style contributed to his preference for muted tones. Castillo was a prolific draftsman, with a characteristic style of vigorous strokes in quill pen and sepia ink and in red chalk. His peers admired and collected his drawings during his lifetime. Artists and students, who regularly copied Castillo's carefully finished drawings, also studied his technique. In subject matter, his countryside scenes and studies of animals were unique in Spanish Baroque draftsmanship. He often signed sheets with the interlaced monogram AC."

What struck me most profound after seeing Schiele's collection of work was his use of color- it's very VERY stark, bold, and contrasted in person. Utterly beautiful.   Klimt's work is in the neighboring room, so when you transition from viewing Klimt's, say, The Kiss, to Schiele's The Embrace, you notice Klimt's influence on Schiele but also realize that Schiele gave a very unique spin on his work by employing alot of greys, blues, and neon-y colors that make his painting's POP (very different from how Klimt makes HIS works jump from the canvas, even though their styles are, of course, similar)."

It is one of Alfred Stieglitz’s earliest masterpieces. Writing about The Net Mender in the 1899 article ‘My Favorite Picture’ Stieglitz said “It expresses the life of a young Dutch woman; every stitch in the mending of the fishing net, the very rudiment of her existence, brings forth a torrent of poetic thought in those who watch her sit there on the vast and seemingly endless dunes, toiling with a seriousness and peacefulness which is so characteristic of these sturdy people. All her hopes are concentrated in this occupation – it is her life.”   PHILLIPS"
museum,35lts6,equalsign,3,Mon May 11 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"Pandora was created by French painter Odilon Redon, who lived at the same time as the impressionist artists. While they painted the life they saw around them—the French countryside, the bustle of Paris—Redon painted from his imagination. He suffered a lonely childhood, shut away as an invalid much of the time. He once wrote to a friend, “The events that left their mark on me happened in days gone by, in my head.” He was known as a mystic and a dreamer who was interested in exploring “a reality that is felt.” That is shown here by his concentration on Pandora’s fascination with the gift prior to her opening it. Her attention is fixed on the gift box. In other paintings of the same subject, the consequences of her curiosity are more often portrayed whereas in Redon’s version, Pandora is surrounded by golden shapes, which symbolize an earthly paradise before the box was opened.   On view in the U.S. National Gallery of Art."

museum,35npqz,avd155,3,Tue May 12 00:19:23 2015 UTC,"The Last of the Buffalo is Albert Bierstadt's final great western landscape. Measuring six by ten feet, it perfectly complements his first painting of that size, Lake Lucerne (1858), also in the National Gallery of Art collection. The ambitious landscape combines a variety of elements he had sketched during early western excursions (1859, 1863, and 1871), and is closely related to later studies he made in Yellowstone National Park in the summer of 1881 (contained in two sketchbooks also in the National Gallery of Art, Corcoran Collection). Despite its composite nature, the view incorporates many topographical features representative of the Great Plains. The dead and injured buffalo in the foreground occupy a dry, golden meadow; their counterparts cross a wide river in the middle ground; and others graze as far as the eye can see as the landscape turns to prairies, hills, mesas, and snowcapped peaks. Likewise, the fertile landscape nurtures a profusion of plains wildlife, including elk, antelope, fox, rabbits, and even a prairie dog at lower left.  Many of these animals turn to look at the focal group of Native American, horse, and charging buffalo locked in combat. In contrast to his careful record of landscape and fauna, the artist's rendering of this confrontation and its backdrop of seemingly limitless herds is a romantic invention rather than an accurate depiction of life on the frontier. By the time Bierstadt painted this canvas, the buffalo was on the verge of extinction, as were the Plains Indians who relied on it for their survival. The animals had been reduced to only about 1,000 from 60 million at the beginning of the century, largely because of demand for their hides in the fashion industry. Scattering buffalo skulls and other bones around the deadly battle, Bierstadt created what one scholar described as ""a masterfully conceived fiction that addressed contemporary issues""—one that references, even laments, the destruction wrought by encroaching settlement.

museum,35npqz,durutticolumn,2,Tue May 12 00:20:22 2015 UTC,"In what way is this a painting that ""references, even laments, the destruction wrought by encroaching settlement""? That sounds like a modern viewer trying desperately to justify loving a painting which clearly expresses a romantic and factually incorrect view of the world.  Yes there are buffalo skulls, but they are offset by the countless buffalo stretching into the distance. I interpret the skulls as a reminder of the timeless cycle of life and death (quite a traditional symbol in that respect), without reference to the fact that the cycle was coming to an end for good. I guess the title could be seen as an ironic commentary (pointing out that the scene we see is completely fake) but a simpler reading is that it refers to the last of the buffalo that currently being hunted by the tribe we see here (meaning not literally the last buffalo, just the last of the day).  Frankly I think this painting endorses the genocide of native Americans and the destruction of the natural Western landscape; I'm not saying it caused those things (art simply does not have that much power) but it does reinforce the ideology held by the people who carried those out.  I'm reminded of a debate from several months ago about a painting by Nazi artist Adolf Ziegler. My position on that painting is we are free to like it in spite of its political message or to hate it in spite of its aesthetic quality, but we should not conflate the two. I don't personally find this painting by Bierstadt to be beautiful, but I certainly don't begrudge anyone who does. If people don't care about the political context I'm happy that they like the painting. But to justify liking it by willfully misinterpreting it is just...well I won't say what it is because I don't want to be that rude."
museum,35npqz,morecabernet,4,Tue May 12 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a modern viewer trying desperately to justify   lol.    but they are offset by the countless buffalo stretching into the distance. I interpret the skulls as a reminder of the timeless cycle of life and death   You're wrong, but don't let the facts stop you. When this painting was painted the buffalo were on the verge of extinction. This painting is about the extinction of the buffalo, and the plains Indian tribes that relied on them. It was in support of one of the first official preservation acts which had been past a few years earlier.  If you want to complain about the iconography, the painting doesn't really show who or what was really responsible for killing them all, though I doubt there was any question of that in the eyes of Bierstadt's audience.   Frankly I think this painting endorses the genocide of native Americans and the destruction of the natural Western landscape;   You should read more then. Context people, context. The Last of the Buffalo was painted for an exhibition in Europe, not for the American public. There was a big scandal when it was rejected.  Beirstadt was painting out west. He saw the masses of settlers moving across the plains, he saw what was coming for the Indians. His work never celebrates their genocide though. It romanticized and reinforced the myth of the American West, which would have perhaps promoted more migration of more Americans out west, but the avocation of genocide is something you've come up with entirely on your own.  One of Bierstadt's only portrait paintings is a very intimate portrait of an elderly Indian woman, who was the last of her tribe on the East coast.  Furthermore, the Hudson River School paintings were used to convince Congress to pass legislation creating the National Parks in the west, and protecting the wildlife.   I really can't imagine the mental gymnastics required to come up with your claim that the Hudson River School advocated the 'destruction of the natural Western landscape'.  And the cherry on the cake of your critique is to go full Godwin in your first comment. Nice."
museum,35npqz,durutticolumn,1 point,Tue May 12 06:32:21 2015 UTC,"When this painting was painted the buffalo were on the verge of extinction.   I never denied that, and in fact it's central to the argument I made. Just because the buffalo were on the verge of extinction doesn't mean Bierstadt or his audience were aware of or cared about that fact.   This painting is about the extinction of the buffalo   How so? I gave a pretty detailed argument to the contrary, based on evidence from within the painting itself. I don't see you citing anything in the image or refuting the details I cited, you've just asserted an interpretation as fact. I'm not trying to deny the importance of context, but it has to be paired with what the painting itself shows.   His work never celebrates their genocide though. It romanticized and reinforced the myth of the American West, which would have perhaps promoted more migration of more Americans out west   I never said he celebrates genocide, I said exactly what you just did: he romanticized and reinforced an ideology that was directly responsible for said genocide. The same goes for the destruction of the natural Western landscape. I know in their minds the Hudson River painters thought they were promoting the salvation of nature, but intentions and effect don't always line up. In many cases I'm sure they succeeded at raising consciousness of environmental causes, but not 100% of the time.   creating the National Parks in the west   There's a school of thought that says the establishment of the National Park system was in some ways counterproductive, since by preserving small portions of land the government implicitly allowed everything outside the Parks to be developed. I'm no historian or political scientist so I can't argue this point, merely raise the hypothesis. Hell I'm not even sure I agree with it, but it is interesting to consider in this context.   to go full Godwin   Come on, appealing to Godwin is weak. Comparison to a historical reality cannot be excluded from every single discussion on the internet just because some doofus put his name to a law. Especially since we're literally talking about genocide in this case."
museum,35npqz,morecabernet,4,Tue May 12 08:29:47 2015 UTC,"How so?   It's called The Last of the Buffalo. What more do you want? You claim, based on zero evidence, that it's about the last buffalo killed by that tribe or that day. There is nothing to support that claim, and the title would be 'The Last Buffalo'.   This was at a time when the US government as well as the state legislatures were passing laws protecting buffalo for over a decade before this painting was painted, scientists were discussing it, newspapers were reporting on it. It was a big deal.   You say the context is important, and then ignore it. The context is that the buffalo were going extinct when this was painted. Bierstadt is responding to that. This painting is clearly showing what the herds once looked like to emphasize the loss.   he romanticized and reinforced an ideology that was directly responsible for said genocide.   He romanticized the West, not the ideology of expansion. If he was romanticizing the expansion he would have painted the railways, towns, and the death of the Indian tribes, in a romantic fashion. The people shooting buffalo from trains, and the Indian massacres. Stuff like this or this. He didn't.   Hell I'm not even sure I agree with it   But you'll throw it in there to bash realist art anyway.   Especially since we're literally talking about genocide in this case.   A series of genocidal acts that took place over four centuries and across two continents. The worst periods and areas of which had nothing to do with Bierstadt. He wasn't folding the blankets. Your comparison is spurious. Ziegler was a Nazi, he lived in Berlin and participated actively in the government of the Third Reich.  If you want to go after artists for the crimes of their governments or their societies, even if those artists were not paid by the government or that there is any proof of the artist's support of those policies, you'll have to go after pretty much every artist in history, including all the ones you post.   If Bierstadt's paintings were somehow responsible for the extermination of the Indians or the development of the West, were Bellini's portraits responsible for the Venetian slave trade? Are Velasquez's depictions of the Spanish royal family responsible for the brutality of the conquest of South America? Did Klimt's paintings of Viennese high society start World War I? Is Pop Art's celebration of consumer society and media culture responsible for the Vietnam War?"
museum,35npqz,durutticolumn,3,Tue May 12 11:06:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're going to agree on most of the points we've discussed, but I am interested in this one:   you'll have to go after pretty much every artist in history, including all the ones you post   Though I suspect you don't believe this yourself, I think I actually do. Much as I love art, defending it on moral grounds is a losing proposition.  The examples you gave are mostly excellent. You use the word ""responsible"" and obviously I wouldn't argue they directly caused any of the atrocities you describe, but certainly they reinforced the ideologies just like I argued the Bierstadt does.  For instance Klimt didn't start WWI, but no historian would say there was a single cause for that war and all of them would include the long decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Klimt's art is emblematic of the decadence that pervaded the empire's ruling elite in its last years.  The only example I disagree with if Pop Art. In the 60s Pop Art was consumed not by those in power but by the counterculture (though today like all art it's mostly controlled by the elite). It is a critique of exactly the consumer society and media culture that perpetuated Americans' pro-war anti-communist views. The ideology that allowed for the Vietnam War was a product of the 50s, and it was the culture of the 60s (Pop Art) that led to the decline in that worldview.  Aside from that, I am happy to accept the hypothesis that all of (Western) art is morally suspect. I like art for its aesthetic value, not its morality. Once we allow morality as a factor in art judgment, the canon needs to be totally reformulated. Of course we can allow for a balance of aesthetics and morality, but still the artists you mentioned will probably have to go."
museum,35npqz,morecabernet,3,Tue May 12 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"I think I actually do.   Me too. I think you and I would probably agree on many social issues. I just don't think it's fair to single out Bierstadt.   the Vietnam War was a product of the 50s   So the Abstract Expressionists?   In the 60s Pop Art was consumed not by those in power but by the counterculture ... It is a critique of exactly the consumer society and media culture that perpetuated Americans' pro-war anti-communist views.   lol. No. They were presented into artistic society by MOMA already in 1962. They were funded by the pro-war, anti-communist, New Left and Rockefeller Republican elite, and the artists cynically embraced consumer society. They absolutely did not critique or reject it. They got rich and famous and reveled in it. Warhol flew to Iran to paint a portrait of the Shah's wife during the worst of the regime's brutality.  Also, we can't compare Klimt at the height of his career, and Warhol when he was just starting out. It's not fair, young Klimt was considered pretty scandalous in his day too.   I am happy to accept the hypothesis that all of (Western) art is morally suspect.   Not just the art then, why not the scientific discoveries and our material comforts too? And why just the West? Every human society and civilization will have some moral stain if we go back far enough, even without imposing today's moral standards on them.   Of course we can allow for a balance of aesthetics and morality, but still the artists you mentioned will probably have to go.   If anything touching Standard Oil money is included, I'm in. Losing Bellini will be a terrible shame though."

museum,35jjh8,equalsign,4,Mon May 11 00:01:19 2015 UTC,"In Arnold Böcklin's Sanctuary of Hercules, three soldiers kneel reverently on the outer step of a shrine, while a fourth looks defiantly off into the distance. The sky, a rich panoply of gray, blue, and white, signals an approaching storm, and a strong wind whips through the trees, scattering the leaves and ruffling the plumes on the soldiers' helmets. At the painting's focal point is the sanctuary itself constructed of stones which are trimmed with polished marble and rest upon an equally smooth circular base. Within the enclosure is a sacred grove of massive trees and at the back, seen in darkened profile, a statue of Hercules, mythical hero and protector from danger.  At first glance, the subject appears very realistic and the shrine archaeologically accurate. Yet the scene also conveys a definite mood of mystery. The stones' pure and richly harmonious colors glow with an unnatural radiance. The gloom inside the grove is equaled by the dark ominous clouds, lit by flashes of lightning on the horizon. Indebted to the romantics of the first half of the nineteenth century, Böcklin rejected the idea of painting solely from nature, and strove to express his own feelings through nature, with the use of vibrant coloration and dramatic lighting.   Here's a short audio overview for those interested. The piece is on display in the U.S. National Gallery of Art."

museum,35ix2u,durutticolumn,8,Sun May 10 20:41:16 2015 UTC,"Pioneering performance artist Chris Burden died today, aged 69.  In Trans-fixed, one of his most iconic pieces, Burden allowed himself to be nailed to a Volkswagen. The extreme act and his pose obviously recall Christian religious iconography. The choice of car is generally assumed to have been a pun on its name - the people's car. It's also surely a reference to the VW's auspicious beginnings under Nazi Germany.  Through his association of these disparate ideas, Burden casts himself as a modern savior whose art can redeem the 20th century's horrors. This should especially be seen in light of the end of the 60s and the disillusionment with the industrialized American war in Vietnam.  However I think it would be wrong to assume the aptly named Burden wants us to think art can truly save the world. I doubt he enjoyed the pain he chose to experience for this piece. The silly pun clashes with the serious consequences of the artist's decision.  What I like most about Burden's work is its irreproducible nature. To my knowledge he never called for a repeat performance, unlike for instance the popular Fluxus Happenings or Marina Abramović's recent MOMA retrospective where young performers recreated her famous works (worth noting that in Abramović's Seven Easy Pieces, where she reproduced other performance artists' works, did not include anything by Burden). This carried over to his later career, as he moved from performance to large-scale installation/sculpture. These more permanent works include completely unique materials such as a meteorite and a stack of gold bricks. More than any artist I can think of, Burden's work defies forgery."
museum,35ix2u,narcissus_goldmund,2,Sun May 10 20:57:04 2015 UTC,"Burden's performances are truly searing. His later works are actually rather optimistic, though. They are often positive reflections on automation, mechanization, and urbanization. His most famous installation is probably Urban Light at the LACMA, and his Metropolis, which is just inside, has similar themes. Both of them have an almost child-like sense of wonder and delight. It's actually hard for me to reconcile these works with the man who let someone shoot him for the sake of art."
museum,35ix2u,toadnovak,4,Mon May 11 04:33:38 2015 UTC,You are the first person I have ever known who thinks of Chris Burden's work as being filled with wonder and delight and not pathologic violence and depictions of megalomania. I find this very interesting.  Metropolis II is like a giant dark mockery of the city that houses it.
museum,35ix2u,narcissus_goldmund,2,Mon May 11 06:43:06 2015 UTC,"Hm, I really don't see it that way. There's a reason that he purposely used children's toy sets to build his sculptures. I see it as a kind of new and fantastical rebuilding in the face of the almost apocalyptic nature of his early work.  In later interviews with Burden, he is generally very optimistic. See here, for a very brief example featuring Metropolis II. If you look at my other comment to /u/durutticolumn, you can see why this might actually be a logical, but surprising, progression in his work."
museum,35ix2u,toadnovak,2,Mon May 11 07:03:03 2015 UTC,"So in that video he admits that LA traffic is awful, that the sculptures cars are going abreakneck 230mph (which he likes compared to his BMW's 23.4mph average in los angeles) and the time of ""freedom"" is about to end for cars. The most positive he gets is positing that something will replace them.  And that the noise of the cars is tension producing and good.  I will give it to whoever produced the video, they definitely did a good job making it feel uplifting though the song.  Which is nothing like the experience seeing it in person. The sculpture is loud and ungainly, and cars race in circles to be immediately stopped in traffic to be hoisted to the top to merely complete their circles again. It is like watching a city in a hamster's wheel, with a lot more ruckus. It is depressing to me.   The use of kids toys I only see as connecting childhood fantasies of the powerful people to the cities they build in adulthood. That the world is constructed by so many grown children.  Burden's work has always been about power and machismo, and the use of toys just is a way of connecting power to unresolved childhood dreams as a dark joke.  I'm not saying your read isn't valid. It is very interesting."
museum,35ix2u,narcissus_goldmund,3,Mon May 11 07:34:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I've spent a lot of time looking at Metropolis II, and I think it's fun. Kids seem to like it, too. And everybody in LA complains about the traffic, mostly good-naturedly. People seem to almost take pride in its awfulness, like the British complaining about the weather.  I do see what you mean about the connection to his childhood dreams, and I touched on that in the other comment thread. However, I think that at its root, there is, at the very least, a fascination with the power (both positive and negative) of human engineering.  I have to wonder, though, how someone with no knowledge of Burden's earlier work would view something like Metropolis II."
museum,35ix2u,narcissus_goldmund,3,Mon May 11 07:54:36 2015 UTC,"Also, if it's of interest to you, I found the full interview from which the sound bites in the video were excerpted here. Burden discusses his whole career, and I don't think he comes down too hard on either side regarding the pessimism or optimism of his work."
museum,35ix2u,toadnovak,2,Mon May 11 08:26:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. I was just watching the video but the transcript is much better. He does go to lengths to avoid saying anything explicit about what his sculptures might ""mean.""  This exchange I found the most interesting and he talks about neutrality near the end:  GM: I was happy to read Robert Storr's essay about the maleness of the work, the boys-and-their-toys aspect, because that's something I think a lot of guys can relate to, both from playing with war toys and wanting to build something... You manage to create these things that have the naivete of toys but the dead-on seriousness of very sharp social critique. Like the fleet of All the Submarines of the United States of America (1987).  CB: Well, they're cardboard submarines, so... (laughs) They'd get soggy at some point, after a few days under water. And the Tale of Two Cities (1981) too... It's a fantasy, because it's two city-states at war with each other: the big city-state's invading the little one, and everybody buys their weaponry from a third party. Does that seem familiar? (laughs)  GM: I saw your Other Vietnam Memorial, I think it was the at ""Dislocations"" show at MOMA [in 1991]. It seemed another work in which--you were using 3 million Vietnamese names on these giant copper plates--that you're kind of concretizing an abstract idea, of scale, as you were with the [50,000 matchsticks and] nickels for the neutron bomb, in a way that's undeniably powerful.  CB: Well, The Other Vietnam Memorial was really about the first Iran War. Because... it was so popular, that you couldn't really have a rational discussion about it... I think a piece like The Reason for the Neutron Bomb is much more nuanced than The Other Vietnam Memorial... The Other Vietnam Memorial risks being didactic... The Reason for the Neutron Bomb is absolutely neutral. It's taking some information, and making a physical model of those numbers. And it takes absolutely no point, it's morally neutral. It's just saying, the reason we claim there's this many tanks which is why we need this bomb that kills people but not machines. I saw it as a way to transform a super-abstraction into less of an abstraction, that maybe helps you understand."
museum,35ix2u,narcissus_goldmund,3,Mon May 11 08:37:28 2015 UTC,"I wasn't familiar with those two works, thanks for bringing them up. They certainly have that sense of wonder you mention, though I'm not sure they or any of his late work are totally positive. For instance the lights are in a regimented military formation, and also I doubt Burden is unaware of the environmental impact of powering so many lights. I think all his work (yes even Shoot) can be interpreted as delightful and optimistic, but it's never free from dark undertones."
museum,35ix2u,narcissus_goldmund,1 point,Mon May 11 06:00:45 2015 UTC,"The transition from his early to late works is actually rather fascinating. If you look at work from his middle period, like his installations of submarines and airplanes (which, rather amusingly, failed miserably), you can already see his interest in manufactured machines, but its connection to war is quite obvious.   At some point, though, he began to revel in processes, construction, and engineering for their own sake. For example, he had several exhibitions consisting entirely of bridges. And then, finally, we have the works in the LACMA, which might almost be said to have a religious faith in technology and its future.  So, one can easily see the reasons for the progression in his career. It's just a little surprising to compare the endpoints."
museum,35ix2u,donkeykonguk,1 point,Mon May 11 06:54:20 2015 UTC,"You're right that it's somewhat absurd to focus on the endpoints (I actually don't know the dates on most of his stuff besides the early performances), and of course his style and themes varied enormously throughout his career (even while it all remains recognizably Burden). Nonetheless, I still maintain that it's a mistake to see any of his work as completely positive.  Another late piece that fits your argument about his religious view of the future is Porsche With Meteorite, which equates a well-engineered car to a literally otherworldly object. However the massive scale serves a dual function, optimistically suspending the objects above the ground while its bulk reminds us they are permanently controlled by gravity. In my view the piece suggests that these two objects actually cancel each other out; it's a zero sum game between nature and technology. Plus I can't help but compare the enormous destructive power of that meteorite to the environmental destruction wrought by our dependence on gasoline.  I think a lot of his miniature work is kind of a failure. The submarines are pretty half-assed; they're all identical in design and while I'm sure there's a reason for that I just can't help thinking it would be more powerful if he'd put in more detail. The piece that stands out most to me is his Tower of Power, which I think shows the same faith in engineering as the bridges (which I'll grant you are pretty hard to interpret negatively, though I also don't find them at all interesting). Yet the sacrificial pyramid and matchstick men clearly show a negative attitude (or at least ambivalence) toward the economic system that allows an artist to put gold bricks in a museum."

museum,35h220,Stolen_Car,2,Sun May 10 07:37:53 2015 UTC,"Stingel's recent panel paintings are a new form of opulent abstraction born out of humble materials and banal gestures. The current works derive from his environmental installations at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and the Whitney Museum in New York in 2007. In each of these participatory works, he transformed the exhibition space by covering the walls in a layer of reflective aluminum-faced Celotex. Viewers could scratch, write, and mark the pristine surface at will, their individual traces accumulating into a mass of anonymous marks. Casting and plating large sections of the graffiti-covered insulation panels, Stingel has produced sumptuous works that memorialize the effects of time. The works in the current exhibition are selected fragments of the inscribed walls cast in copper using a procedure that captures even the most faint surface detail. The cast base is then electroplated with gold, an alchemical transformation that imbues common graffiti with a new, anonymous, and eternal abstract beauty.   Gagosian Gallery"
museum,35h220,durutticolumn,3,Sun May 10 07:39:19 2015 UTC,"For the most part I like the process behind this, but I'm always suspicious of art that relies (at least in part) on the public contributing to the visual design. Art should of course engage the viewer, I just think asking people to assist in the creation of the work is a lazy way to go about that.  It's often done under the pretension of democratization, with the implication that the work is truly collaborative and undermines the elitism inherent in calling artists geniuses. Yet the conditions for creation are always determined by the artist, who retains his supremacy. If I may apply Godwin's Law here, it's artistically equivalent to the plebiscite preceding Anschluss; it's hard to criticize because on the surface everything's above board, but regardless of what the public does the outcome is predetermined.  That said, I think this work by Stingel might be addressing exactly the issues that concern me. The fact that he had to put it through an alchemical transformation implies that before the artist's intervention the image was worthless. But casting it in gold could also be seen as celebrating the subject, raising it to what the artist perceives as its truly worthy nature."
museum,35h220,wesleysnipez0,3,Sun May 10 22:38:47 2015 UTC,"yeah i think that as far as stingel goes, he would most certainly have a sardonic lens behind it all"
museum,35h271,Stolen_Car,2,Sun May 10 07:40:33 2015 UTC,"To create the work, Stingel walked across four Styrofoam panels in lacquer thinner-coated boots, effectively melting the white material below. As Criqui notes, the piece “inevitably [evokes] expanses of snow which people have walked across” (Jean Pierre Criqui, “Rudolf Stingel. Captions”, Rudolf Stingel Palazzo Grassi 2013, Milan: Mondadori, 2013, p.14). Yet despite the intimation of tundra, the piece somehow exists beyond any specific locale. It put forth an abstracted landscape that recalls the work of Gerhard Richter, not least in that it draws attention to the artist’s mark. The present lot is a document of process; the prints which decorate the surface are traces of action that direct the viewer’s attention to the moment of creation. Yet this moment remains fundamentally evasive; far from self-evident, it requires reconstruction on behalf of the viewer. Whilst the shoeprints on the left hand panels reveal the artist’s path, the overlaid imprints on the right hand side obscure any kind of linear route. The left hand panels bespeak remoteness, suggesting an isolated individual trailing across an empty landscape. By contrast, the right hand panels abound with activity and teem with disorder. The frenzy of shoeprints suggests multitudes, recursion, and crossing paths. They imagine a landscape of coming-and-going, a palimpsest of half-remembered movement.   PHILLIPS"

I don't know if I'm reading too much into it or if it was actually intended, but I get a heavy vibe of the soldier having trouble re-integrating into civilian life after what he's seen in combat.  The two things that make me feel this way are the soldier's pose; shoulders slumped forward, arms limp at his side, not at all the posture of a typical glorious hero.  The other thing (and this is where I feel I may be stretching it a bit) is the juxtaposition of the technology of the boat versus the rustic look of the village, further suggesting the gap between what life is like back home versus out in the world.   It's really sweet, though.  I think the way the sky takes up such a huge portion of the canvas is actually quite modern."

From the beginning all men by nature were created alike, and our bondage or servitude came in by the unjust oppression of naughty men.

museum,35db6b,durutticolumn,4,Sat May 9 05:19:55 2015 UTC,"A few personal remarks on this one:  This little painting (smaller than a sheet of A4 paper) is currently on display in the Tate Britain's Walk Through British Art (in the 1810 Room). I did the whole walk through on my visit to the museum last year, so presumably I saw this painting. Yet it clearly made no impression on my since I feel like I just saw it for the first time.  I had occasion to look this up today while talking with my father, who accompanied my on said walk through. He brought it up to lament how disappointed he was upon seeing it last year. Apparently some 30 years ago (i.e. when he was my age) this made quite an impression on him, exhibited under a single luminous bulb in a dimly lit room alongside some similarly sized works by William Blake. Today it hangs in a bright white gallery and the Blakes are in their own special room but similarly over-lit (made worse on my visit by the group of would-be poets who gathered in the Blake room to read their own Blake-tribute poetry). So I encourage you all to make this full screen and turn off your lights in order to recreate that lost experience of the 1980s; it's quite delightful.  This is all relevant because the experience I just told you to reproduce is similar to what Palmer wanted to achieve. As a Romantic painter his aesthetics, though quite modern in their own way, are modeled on medieval imagery. Palmer clearly wanted to bring his viewers back to that lost magical age when art was a purely religious experience."

With its prominent signature, the sheet can be considered in a way a ""self-portrait."" The discrepancy between the mutilated hand and the technical perfection with which it was drawn by that same hand makes this sheet one of his most intriguing pen works.

For the past three centuries or so, the drawing has resided in the Devonshire collection, as part of one of the finest collections of Old Master Drawings that has ever been assembled. One of the most important Italian Renaissance drawings to have come to the market in modern times, it is a definitive representation of the summit of Raphael’s achievements as a draughtsman, encapsulating his astonishing technical originality and his mastery of the chalk medium, through which he explores the most delicate nuances of volumes and lighting.   Just as the Transfiguration was a major milestone in the history of art, anticipating elements of the much later Baroque style, so too the drawings relating to it were unlike anything previously seen in Raphael’s oeuvre or anywhere else.  In works such as this, where an intensely sculptural sense of light and a breadth and freedom in the painterly touches are combined to create a monumental, yet immensely subtle, image, Raphael effectively defined the visual language that was to underpin western art for several centuries.  We can only speculate how, had he not died aged only 37, Raphael himself might have built upon the extraordinary originality and brilliance of the Transfiguration and its related drawings."

museum,3511pc,Stolen_Car,3,Wed May 6 05:27:30 2015 UTC,"So amazing photo in some sense.  I'm amused that I find it cheesy however.  It is remarkable that the photographer managed to position himself at the exact moment and at the exact spot in order to best create a visual analogy between abstract painting (a la dekooning ""excavation"" or dubuffet's scratchiness or soulange in some way) and a photograph of a found scene.  However, the overbearing beauty of the piece, especially the romantic background make it a little kitschy for me.  I don't mean this as condemning criticism; i'm just voicing an opinion and exploring the reasons for my own reactions."
museum,3511pc,kajimeiko,3,Wed May 6 19:15:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, I think maybe worldwidekitsch has made regulars of this sub a bit hypersensitive to kitsch. Personally, I think this is brilliant.   The background may be a bit kitschy, but it serves another purpose, so I am able to forgive that. The background is necessary to anchor the photograph and give it depth and perspective. It allows the stems in the foreground to fluctuate between two-dimensional geometric shapes which recall abstract painting and three-dimensional living objects situated in space. A delightful illusion, and one that I think is rather deep as well."
museum,3511pc,narcissus_goldmund,3,Wed May 6 23:47:26 2015 UTC,"Am I the only person who sees nothing kitsch here? Trees and bridges are common subjects of kitsch, but they don't automatically make an image kitsch.  I find the contrast between the bare trees on the left and the thick forest on the right somewhat unsettling, which is reinforced by the way the bridge illusionistically pushes out toward us. This alone would be a pretty good photo IMO and not kitsch, but any doubt is completely exploded by the abstract foreground which seems to disintegrate toward the bottom.  The whole thing is jarring and about as far from kitsch as I can image on a visual level. I suppose the idea of the piece could be seen as hackneyed (finding abstraction in real objects is hardly original, even in 1964) but I don't think unoriginal ideas alone can qualify an image as kitsch."
museum,3511pc,durutticolumn,2,Thu May 7 04:20:59 2015 UTC,"I would not have guessed that this was a piece from 1964. I can see what /u/kajmeiko means about it seeming kitschy, but I think that's got more to do with the proliferation of easy contrast in present day amateur art that it does with this as a standalone work.  I do like it, though. The still nature/structures in the background are both sombre and peaceful compared to the chaotic, sharp people in the foreground and it definitely strikes a certain chord. I say ""people"", that's what I initially felt I was looking at - the shapes appear more like flowers only closer to the water."

In this sense it appeals to us in a sentimental nature, though one i find a little lachrymose or maudlin."

museum,34y5ul,startwithodds,-1,Wed May 6 04:28:52 2015 UTC,This isn't that good of a Picasso.
museum,34y5ul,durutticolumn,5,Tue May 5 17:15:29 2015 UTC,In what ways do you think it falls behind?
museum,34y5ul,narcissus_goldmund,1 point,Tue May 5 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"I like this painting, but I have to agree with /u/startwithodds that it's hardly Picasso's best. This whole era lacks the power of his earlier work; I say this despite having a print of 1932's Nude, Green leaves and Bust proudly hanging above my desk.  I think one big problem at this time is Picasso's attempt to portray his subjects' psychology. For instance the painting you linked seems to cast its subject in simplistic melancholy; the two sides of her face as well as the contrast between the curly red chair and the muted diagonals of the background are shorthand for the subject's emotional state. Picasso's paintings have always been simple (it's one of his great virtues) but here it feels like he's trying to be deep and it doesn't quite work, especially considering his lifelong infantile attitude towards women. I find Picasso's best paintings to be examinations of his own childish psychology.  That said, in my opinion a painting that ""isn't that good of a Picasso"" is still better than most paintings by other artists, so I can't speak for whether /u/startwithodds genuinely hates this. The only Picasso I genuinely dislike is Guernica."
museum,34y5ul,durutticolumn,2,Wed May 6 05:34:59 2015 UTC,"Well, now you must tell me. Why do you dislike Guernica?"
museum,34y5ul,narcissus_goldmund,2,Wed May 6 05:48:10 2015 UTC,"TBH I'm not totally sure.  Like I said, I don't think Picasso was a particularly deep man and I'm more interested in his psychology than what he had to say about the world. Guernica is basically political commentary so that turns me off.  I don't think Picasso wasn't the right person to paint the subject. I love his ouvre because it's constantly exploring new ideas, and if a painting fails it doesn't matter because it probably only took a few hours. The idea of a single Picasso being monumental seems ludicrous this late in his career.  The whole composition feels week to me. It's completely contained within the frame of the painting and there's no sense of a world outside what he shows us. It barely feels like Picasso had enough to fill his gigantic canvas.  However it's largely an unfair judgment based on overexposure. I didn't like art growing up, because my only experience was either being dragged to museums by my parents or staring at the posters my teachers had in their classrooms. When you look at an image for hours every day for a year, you grow to hate it. Guernica adorned several classrooms, as did other paintings I now hate like Renoir's Luncheon on a Boat and the drawings of M C Escher. Guernica was responsible in part for keeping me away from art for years, therefore I don't think I'll ever appreciate it."
museum,34y5ul,durutticolumn,2,Wed May 6 06:11:33 2015 UTC,"Well, but Picasso was kind of a genius, wasn't he? I don't like to overly romanticize artists, but at least some of them have, for me at least, that extraordinary spark of almost effortless and transcendent artistry even if they are not particularly deep or intellectual. I think the same of Caravaggio, and probably a few others.  As for overexposure, I remember that my family used to have an entire set of plastic dishware with various Renoirs printed on them, and chief among them was a large tray featuring Luncheon of the Boating Party. This was in addition to quite a few T-shirts, mugs, and throw pillows with various Van Goghs and Monets. I don't remember registering any explicit dislike for them at the time, but now that I come to think of it, this may very well be why I have never been terribly enamored by Impressionist painting."
museum,34y5ul,Maudhiko,1 point,Wed May 6 06:44:17 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that Picasso was a genius, but specifically an artistic genius. When he was focused purely on his art, he produced some of my favorite paintings. When he tried to take on the role of a psychologist or a political commentator, he had to balance those aims against his pure visual inventiveness. In some cases the results are still highly enjoyable, as in the Nude with Green Leaves where the whimsical thick black lines fill me with sheer delight. But in Guernica I think he only cared about the political message and I personally find nothing else of value."

museum,34mou6,Stolen_Car,4,Sat May 2 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo of his excitement about ""the modern portrait,"" a picture that renders character not by the imitation of the sitter's appearance but through the independent, vivid life of color. Pursuing this goal in the portraits he painted of Roulin, van Gogh was influenced by the artists Honoré Daumier (for his expressive and caricatural line) and Eugène Delacroix (for his use of color). Another, more immediate influence may have been Paul Gauguin, who worked with van Gogh in Arles in the fall of 1888. Gauguin urged less dependence on observation and more reliance on memory and intuition. This advice may have been especially telling in the case of van Gogh's later portraits of Roulin (including MoMA's), which were likely painted after the postman had left Arles for Marseilles.   -MoMA"
museum,34mou6,durutticolumn,4,Sat May 2 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I rate van Gogh as a great portraitist. I'm a huge fan of his interiors and landscapes, as well as a lot of his still lives, but his portraits just don't speak to me in the same way. It's probably the only area where Gauguin is superior.  This portrait is a perfect example, as it's pretty good but just doesn't stick with me. The style here is particularly derivative of Gauguin, reducing the figure to a flat geometrical shape, so it's easy to compare them and to my eye Gauguin wins easily. The brushwork in the beard is closer to the van Gogh I love, but the specific method of application here recalls Manet more than van Gogh (there are probably better examples, but Manet came to mind first).  That said, I like the portrait you posted of Roulin's Baby which I hadn't seen before. It's almost given more of a still-life than portrait treatment.  It's also hard for me to dismiss his iconic works like Dr. Gachet, but a big part of that is their Mona Lisa-like overexposure (which incidentally I just discovered hasn't been posted before, so now I'm off to rake in some karma)."
museum,34mou6,catiyin,2,Sat May 2 23:01:30 2015 UTC,"The Gauguin example seems to be slightly farther from a flat, stroke-y interpretation of the face than the Van Gogh. The Van Gogh seems more minimal in the specificity of formal areas of shadow and light, represented by a few medium sized strokes of olive greens and yellows, whereas the Gauguin is more specific and refined in the brush stroke density. But I do see this portrait as being closer to Gauguin's portraiture style than the baby and Dr. Gachet, a fascinating comparison.   Also the 3/4 profile versus the mostly frontal yet slanted headshot probably result in a different reading of form. In a way, I see the Van Gogh as much flatter, and less about the formal qualities of the figure than the brush strokes. I think this intention is pushed and expanded on this version of Roulin's Baby and Dr. Gachet.   Thanks for the insight, especially since I'm only just starting to learn painting. Analyzing great works really helps put your own techniques and style into perspective of intentions."

Kitsch is the moniker for this. There is a movement of craftspeople who are embracing the term Kitsch - welcoming the sentimental, theatrical, exaggerated emotion as aesthetically positive. The question posed makes little sense if one is unaware that 'kitsch' need not mean cheap."
museum,34m8xq,toadnovak,1 point,Sat May 2 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"I get what you are trying to do but saying that sentimentality isn't welcome in art isnt really true. It just doesn't take the form of pictorial painting. Felix Gonzalez-Torrez, James Lee Beyers, Luigi Ontani, all the reliquary artists, just tons of sentimental artists.  In fact there is tons of theatrical, exaggerated emotional work now. The artworld really doesn't look like it Greenbergs idea of it.  So I think, besides the embrace of the moniker, which I think many artists today take up (john waters, josephine pryde), you need to come up with a useful definition and laguage seperating what you term ""kitsch"" because a lot of it could be used to describe things I think you are not including as kitsch."

museum,34m8xq,worldwidekitsch,1 point,Mon May 4 04:47:35 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean art.   I see two uses for the word art. One pre-Kant and the Industrial Revolution and one after Kant and the rise of the Royal French Academy. Current common use focuses much more on the later than the former.   The early use literally meant “skill” - nothing more. There were groups of these skills - such as mechanical arts and liberal arts (free skills) - but the fine skills or “beaux skills” weren't grouped until later. In the Renaissance - Geometry, Rhetoric, logic and astronomy were in the high class of art. So this version of ‘art’ is not what I mean. I mean crafted expression.   Around the time of the Royal French Academy some painters rose to the “Fine Art” category because they were able to prove, with the help of the philosophers, how logical and rational certain paintings could be. As this was happening a category called Non-Art was being established. This was the work of the old craft traditions - including the painters guilds. This, more or less, is the conversation most are in today. Either Art is anything someone wants it to be (and virtually impossible to define), or it is something along the lines of the Fine Art rational pursuit established by Kant.  So no, this doesn’t work either - I really do mean ‘crafted expression’."

museum,34o3o4,durutticolumn,2,Sat May 2 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"Since this has apparently never been posted before (someone linked the Wikipedia page years ago but it got no votes), I figured I might as well submit this most famous of paintings to the museum.  What I really want to know is, what does everyone think about this painting as a work of art?  I think it works better on a computer screen than most paintings, since its context in the Louvre (on an awkwardly placed wall behind bullet proof glass surrounded by a blockade) is quite hideous. Also the direct confrontation on a monitor precludes the hackneyed statement about her eyes following the viewer as we move about the gallery (though unfortunately it does nothing to resolve that most boring of debates, regarding her smile).  There are a few particular points I find interesting, such as the overall color arrangement. Despite Leonardo's muted tones, there's a clear scheme dividing red, green, blue, and yellow. Interestingly these colors don't quite match our expectations as for instance the sky is more green than the landscape. That landscape is probably my favorite part of the image, as it is in most Italian Renaissance paintings. The loopy roads are whimsically absurd, and the distant rocks are fantastic in the original sense of the word."
museum,34o3o4,guiscard,3,Sat May 2 23:23:44 2015 UTC,"Vasari talks about how beautiful the eyebrows were, as well as the red glazes in the cheeks and lips. A restorer removed them all in the 19th-century, so we're really not seeing the colors he wanted in the finished work. Leonardo was also a notorious experimenter (see the disastrous results of the Battle of Anghiari), so it's possible he used pigments which faded. Yellows, especially, have often lost their color over the years as it wasn't until cadmiums that painters had a reliable strong yellow. Orpiment wasn't used much in the west, and the lead yellows don't go very deep. I feel it's hard to judge the colors of the piece.  The 'eyes following the viewer around' is pretty trivial to do, and many portraits do it. You just need the sitter to look at the painter while they paint.  I think the painting is interesting for a few reasons. The modelling is superb. Leonardo had studied in Verrocchio's studio and was there for the transition from tempera to oil paint. It was a huge advance in technology for artists at the time, and the fact that they were now able to model forms without all the little hatches was used to great effect by Leonardo. He is even associated with 'sfumato' today, though he neither invented it nor was the only one to use it.  The main thing about the piece to me is that it really represents wonderfully that moment in Western history where our outward-looking and scientific approach to the world around really started rolling. Leonardo was, in many ways, a man of his times but he also demonstrates the power of curiosity and study of the natural world which would be so important to Western Europe, and the world, in the centuries to come. I feel this painting really demonstrates that well. It is one of his few non-religious works, for one thing, and she looks out at the viewer with a great confidence, which doesn't happen in his other portraits.  On a side note, and maybe one of the mods can chime in, but I think the reason a lot of major works aren't in /r/museum is because an early poster who had submitted many of the most famous works of art deleted their account."
museum,34o3o4,guiscard,2,Sun May 3 05:55:19 2015 UTC,"I don't agree this represents about the ""scientific approach"" that Leonardo is often associated with. Most of his knowledge of anatomy is irrelevant to this piece, which hides the sitter's body in dark draped robes. And I think the link between science and secularism is anachronistic. (not trying to attack you here - you've just espoused the standard interpretation of the Renaissance that I've always disagreed with)  More than anything, I find it strange to call a painting with this landscape scientific. You know far more about the colors than I, but from what you've said it sounds like the distant rocks have changed less than other passages. Their color makes sense to me, as most Italian landscapes at the time represented distance with blue. This device is in part based on observation, but the resulting image is far from scientifically accurate."
museum,34o3o4,kajimeiko,2,Sun May 3 06:51:45 2015 UTC,"I still think an understanding of anatomy is always important, even if the artist shows restraint in presenting it, and there is still anatomy in the face and hands. Hiding the clavicle and chest structure is perhaps an artistic device to keep attention on the face -any dark shapes in that large, light mass will unduly attract the eye.  The atmospheric perspective is also based on observation, and an attempt to understand how light moves across distances. IIRC Leonard was the first person to use the term 'atmospheric perspective', when he wrote his treatise on painting. It was definitely something that interested him from a scientific standpoint.  I agree the mountains aren't done from observation, though (again IIRC) I believe he was constructing them based on his ideas on geology.  It seems to me that all of Leonardo's work shows his interest in scientific inquiry and the natural world, but this piece also eschews the religiosity of much of his oeuvre.  I'll give it to you that my reading is probably based on my own knowledge of the context of the artist and his life, but you did ask what we think of it.  Have you ever read Francis Yate's Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition? You'd love it if you disagree with the standard interpretations of the Renaissance."

I happen to find it and her extremely beautiful, still the terms you are talking in make good sense to me. I also am familiar with what you mean by mysterious, but to me Mona Lisa feels very present - like a Buddha smiling. What is here is here. It is very arty to ask “well what is she thinking about? What does it mean!?”  An object can be kitsch and art. But Kitsch is not Art. They are separate ideas. If both ideas apply to an object - it can be both. Perhaps this is what is particularly fascinating about the painting. Not only is it superbly well painted - but it can be appreciated as art or kitsch.  ‘Sentimental’ is more broad than pathos. All Kitsch is sentimental, but not all kitsch evokes pathos. Sentimentality includes refined feelings. The Mona Lisa is sentimental imitative crafted expression. I am not concerned with how original, tasteful, or fashionable it is - therefore I see it as kitsch."

I am not concerned with how original   Is that indicative of a willful lack of sophistication or a willful ignorance on your part? Any cursory knowledge of art history will provide a vivid understanding of how original this painting is in the history of art, and indeed in the history of mankind.  I understand the motivation behind ""dumbing yourself down"" in order to appreciate a certain sentiment in art (I occasionally appreciate art solely w my eyes, leaving conceptual consideration aside) but I think that would hamper the incredible rich experience that such an incredible artwork as this would provide.  I didn't check out what context the critics you cited considered this painting kitsch but i would hazard that it would not  be on the same terms as you (at least in the case of jones whose writings i know).  I believe they probably called this painting kitsch because it is the most reproduced artwork in the world--to the average person it is barely a work of art- it is solely a tourist attraction or a signifier of ""the West."" In this sense it could be viewed as kitsch ( a mass marketed aesthetic work meant to seek broad appeal) but that is considering this object as it exists in world culture, not approaching it as an individual art work."

Theatrically exaggerated towards perfection.    this piece is just a raw manifestation of the artist's psyche   Again Leonardo never called himself an artist, but he did say this, “Painting does not speak, but is self evident and ends in facts.”  Any speculation of Da Vinci’s psyche can be great fun and intellectually rigorous, but can hardly be called a fact. Besides, psychological depth certainly does not diminish the kitsch. Kitsch is concerned with what can be known from the picture itself - Art relies on context and outside information for much of its value.    I am not concerned with how original it is   Is that indicative of a willful lack of sophistication or a willful ignorance on your part?    No. It is that anything that may be original about this picture is not what makes it important to a kitschconsumer. Let’s say a similar picture was found and dated to 1470. This would shake up the Art community, but the Mona Lisa’s Kitschvalue would hold.   motivation behind ""dumbing yourself down""    I think that is a misreading. Here is how Nerdrum puts it: ”With Zorn, I am satisfied from the navel and down. With Da Vinci, from the neck and up. But with Rembrandt, my entire body is seduced.”   most reproduced artwork in the world   Surely it is, but why do the critics speak in the singular? And not say - “the reproductions are the ultimate in kitsch”? My answer is this: If a Rothko was reproduced on small card stock 20T times and distributed around the world - it would still not be known as kitsch. There may be an argument as to wether the event was Art, but each picture wouldn’t have the sentimentality that makes kitsch kitsch."

In this way it acts as a mirror; it is a countenance devoid of subjectivity, and the artist ask the viewer to create the identity.

museum,34l7dd,worldwidekitsch,2,Sat May 2 03:20:30 2015 UTC,"/u/kajimeiko - to answer your question from http://www.reddit.com/r/museum/comments/33g1xt/cy_twombly_untitled_vi_bacchus_2005/cqrmnnl?context=3   Kitsch as a term, afaik has only entered the common lexicon in the late 19th cent with the introduction of mass produced artworks and advertising. If you are positing that the capital A conception of Art only started with Kant, his theories precede the concept of kitsch by about a hundred years. So what is your objective in attempting to establish a grand manichean narrative between kitsch and Art?   This ‘manichean’ narrative is not a new establishment - it has been embraced since the beginning of Fine Art. During the rise of the French Royal Academy and the conception of Beaux-Art, the painters of the old Guilds were dismissed as non-Art. The Fine Artists claimed these painters did not share the ‘genius’ and should be regarded as merely ‘skilled workers’.  Art has largely been refined by what it is not - not imitative, not sentimental,  and not passionately judged. For as long as there was the ‘enlightened’ idea of Art there has been a concept of craft which is not Art.  This anti/synthetic-Art found a name decades later in the word ‘kitsch’. Now how are we - who want to paint imitative, sentimental, sensual paintings like those of the old Guilds - to find independence from the moral-monopoly Art has claimed for ~225 years? I hold - embrace the term kitsch."

The mentalities were not as split. I see the painters you mentioned - if they were involved in the defining of Fine Art - like Einstein with the atom bomb. They helped to create it, but we could guess they would not be pleased with the outcome.  The academy was wrestling with what it meant to portray beauty - like we do now - is it disinterested or passionate? The former won out. The established groundwork for educated vs. craft gave social precedence to these ideas - all as Art was coming into existence. If not for the intellectual dogma, the debate could have stayed in the studio trenches.   How do we give the devil impunity? How do we relinquish Kitsch of the moral stain?

museum,34l7dd,kajimeiko,1 point,Sat May 2 14:26:19 2015 UTC,"I think one of the problems people are having with what you say about Kitsch is that you aren't really addressing kitsch as a modern and industrial term, the idea of kitsch has as much to do with reproduction and commercializing of art and culture (the transformation of folk culture in ""low"" culture that Greenberg wrote about) as it does with the emotional and sentimental qualities you are interested in (though of course they are related as you've noted). I'm not sure its entirely justifiable to extend the definition of ""kitsch"" backwards to work that predates the industrial revolution, whilst there was certainly an establishment of a hierarchy in the arts there were not the same ideas of product which informed our current idea of kitsch. You also seem to be equating the idea of ""craft"" and ""kitsch"" which I am a little troubled by, it seems to discount a lot of the ideas of the craft movement which; whilst it reacts against the enlightenment idea of Art, also reacts against the industrial idea of kitsch. I'd be interested to hear what your thoughts are, where does the commercial and industrialized aspects of culture fit into your ideas about kitsch - or do you think that these do not have a place in the academic definition of kitsch and are a colloquial misuse of the term (if so how do consider this kind of commercial kitsch to fit into the high-art low-art dichotomy which characterized discussion about kitsch in the 20th century)."
museum,34l7dd,kajimeiko,1 point,Sat May 2 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"reproduction and commercializing of art and culture   Reproduction and commercialization in painting and sculpture is not new to the 19th century. Look to the little figurine sculptures of the ancient Greeks.   as it does with the emotional and sentimental qualities   more than related - they are integrally linked.   justifiable to extend the definition of ""kitsch"" backwards   this is fair so long as we don't call Caravaggio an Artist. As this term came into use after his death. And Caravaggio's painting wasn't any more an art than Astronomy.   equating the idea of ""craft"" and ""kitsch""   If kitsch is craft, need craft equal kitsch?   industrialized aspects of culture   Kitsch can surely be reproduced and sold cheaply. A kitsch consumer may have equal desire for a reproduction as for the original work. But to repeat and lessen costs of an object does not make it kitsch. Automobiles could be reduced to $10 a piece and they still wouldn't necessarily be kitschy. Within Kitsch there are lows and highs - this is a key factor on witch Harries, Broch, and Greenberg agree. Sentimentality is a more important factor to Kitsch than price or value."

I can see why one could call the caravaggio ""kitschy""   I would say I appreciate the evolution…   the representation of human emotion that is quite easily identifiable   The objects or themes depicted by kitsch are instantly and effortlessly identifiable.  Tomas Kulka   I am not easily swayed by sentimental appeals in art, but   so you agree it is sentimental?   Kitsch rarely if ever reaches that level of sophistication.   In what way do you use ‘sophistication’? “Within the category of Kitsch we can thus distinguish between more and less successful paintings. Kitsch, too has its masterpieces.” Karsten Harries   beyond mere mimesis   mere was a word given a negative connotation by Hegel.  In late Middle English it meant pure. To use mere in the modern connotation is to vastly underestimate mimesis  Do you see how much moral judgement is imbedded in our language?   If you can provide an accepted definition of kitsch that differs from these entries, please do so.   First, Abraham Moles supports the issue of kitsch is not definitional. “It is not a semantically explicit denotative phenomenon, it is an intuitive and subtle connotative phenomenon”  Denys Riout at http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s2_10097.pdf responds to Broch’s claim that kitsch is ‘junk art’ or ‘garish art’  calling these two demarcations disadvantaged and insufficient.   “The essence of kitsch is the confusion of the ethical category with the aesthetic category. It is not concerned with ‘good,’ but with ‘attractive’ work; it is the pleasing effect that is most important,” Broch  As you may see, this is getting repetitive. There are dozens of quotes now to look through in wwk comments that already specifically answer your challenge.   What purpose does it serve to hold on to the negative connotation?  “The trumped-up charges against kitsch and sentimentality should disturb us and make us suspicious.” - Robert C. Solomon"
museum,34l7dd,kajimeiko,1 point,Sat May 2 09:32:29 2015 UTC,"so you agree it is sentimental?   In that it evokes pity? You have  a point there. However, sentimental is usually meant to refer to nostalgia and sweetness.  Here are its most common synonyms:  http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/sentimental?s=t  Is there a better word to use that does not connote maudlin tendencies? Because this painting is anything but maudlin.   In what way do you use ‘sophistication’?    In that it is nuanced, multi-varied and open to multiple interpretations, something that kitsch, which usually appeals just to common sentiment, does not. This painting can be viewed and appreciated in a host of different ways. You have implied that kitsch does not offer this, that if one looks at it without emotional rapport or with irony it becomes camp. I can see how someone could have a campy appreciation of this painting but it offers so much more than that, and having only that interpretation would reveal said viewer's lack of sophistication.   mere was a word given a negative connotation by Hegel. In late Middle English it meant pure. To use mere in the modern connotation is to vastly underestimate mimesis   citation? this etymological dict. does not agree with your assertion:  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mere   Original sense of ""nothing less than, absolute"" (mid-15c., now only in vestiges such as mere folly) existed for centuries alongside opposite sense of ""nothing more than"" (1580s, as in a mere dream).   *   What purpose does it serve to hold on to the negative connotation?

Maudlin seems an accurate term under the umbrella of sentimental. And as you noted it can also mean to ‘evoke pity’ - as well as other emotions.   I agree with what you mean by sophistication. Kitsch and Art are separate ideas. Kitsch is not Art and Art is not Kitsch. Still if both ideas apply to an object - it can be both.   given a negative connotation by Hegel   No citations - this is merely my reading of the use of the word before and after his writings. I like the etymological root, but after Hegel it began to connote lowly.    There can be a positive appreciation of kitsch   So you agree “cheap” should not be in the definition of kitsch?"

museum,34l8qh,kajimeiko,2,Mon May 4 11:09:30 2015 UTC,no doubt the carracci drawing is a strong piece.  the gap there is in time creates difficulties in saying this person in contemporary is not as (or more) talented as someone 500 years in the past with the exception of a few that are simply just better (Rembrandt etc..). I am am not sure for me personalty that i am willing to place Carracci in the group of artist that talent wise are untouchable like a Rembrandt but i do believe Carracci was an amazing artist (i do like his drawing much more than his paintings)    anthony ryder may be one closer to Carracci style than fowkes  https://www.google.com/search?q=anthony+ryder&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=og9IVfnDPIXwoATt2YCwBg&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAw&biw=858&bih=546#tbm=isch&q=anthony+ryder+drawings

museum,34f2e3,JosiahHenderson,2,Thu Apr 30 16:45:27 2015 UTC,"Sadao Watanabe (1913–1996)  was born in Tokyo. He was baptized as a Christian in 1930 while still a teen. Because his family was poor, he dropped out of school to work as a dye craftsman. Inspired by the folk arts movement led by Keisuke Serizawa and Soetsu Yanagi, he learned how to apply traditional katazome stencil-dyeing techniques to washi paper, and began producing prints on biblical themes. He received the Japan Folk Crafts Museum Prize in 1947, the National Painting Style Award in 1948, and the Nippon Hangain Fine Arts Prize in 1956. Also highly regarded overseas, he received honorary degrees from Linfield College and Valparaiso University, both in the United States.    (Source)   The story here depicted is from Numbers 22, in which the angel of the Lord (visible only to the prophet Balaam's donkey) blocks his path. The donkey refuses to move forward, in order to save the prophet's life; but Balaam grows frustrated with the animal and beats it.    Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?” And Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you.” And the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Is it my habit to treat you this way?” And he said, “No.”  Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face. And the angel of the LORD said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times?

museum,34c7mv,durutticolumn,3,Thu Apr 30 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"Like all of Brown's work, this sculpture's starting point (as visible at the base) is a copy of a traditional sculpture depicting a fanciful ""low"" subject, in this case a flower fairy. However Brown here gives himself much freer rein than usual, allowing his absurd squiggly brushstrokes to obliterate the original image.  My feelings about Brown are generally negative. His artistic mission is to blend gaudy abstraction with tacky appropriation, which was an interesting experiment but IMO his oeuvre proves its failure. I wish he would evolve his style (more than simply changing his subject matter, as he's gone from Science Fiction to Dali to Old Masters). My opinion here may sound stupid since I'm promoting exactly the kind of conditioned expectations Brown wants to dispel, but now that we're a couple decades into his career I think it's clear Brown's ideas are outdated.  Brown's sculptures are seen as his weakest work, but this actually interests me more than his painting. As an experiment in abstraction, the physicality of these brushstrokes astounds me. It's like a continuation of ideas Lichtenstein explored in the 60s and expanded throughout his career."

museum,34c217,durutticolumn,4,Wed Apr 29 23:13:51 2015 UTC,"Intro  I have a lot to say here so I'll borrow my format from /u/WandererAboveFog...  Stolen Thunder  At the annual Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, red dots are stuck to a print's frame for every copy it sells. At the center of Stolen Thunder II is a photograph of one of these works covered in red dots; Parker has digitally removed the image itself to draw our attention to the dots. Parker does not openly state who the original artist was, but according to an RA curator it's the great Tracey Emin.  The Emin original was so popular that its dots spilled onto the wall; these are the dots next to number 577. Parker was reportedly jealous of the high number of sales and the artist's drawing ability which she felt she couldn't match, so instead she took a photograph and entered it into the next year's Summer Exhibition as Stolen Thunder, numbered 167 in the exhibition. The neatest line of red dots represent the sales of Stolen Thunder.  Stolen Thunder II  Of course like any good YBA Parker couldn't stop there. So she took a photograph of Stolen Thunder with its stickers and entered it into the next year's Summer Exhibition as Stolen Thunder II. The work itself is a single photograph and does not include the bottom row of red dots or anything outside of it (the outermost frame and wall). Maybe I should have titled this post Stolen Thunder III since it's sure to appear this year!  My analysis  Parker's work always explores the lives of objects when humans are done with them, making them look like formalist abstractions. The Stolen Thunder series recalls hard-edged geometric painting but is actually an in-focus photograph that questions the edges and boundaries of artwork.  Stolen Thunder II may seem over-the-top, but I think Stolen Thunder alone would not have been as interesting. This isn't just a photograph, it's an ongoing experiment. Parker is always willing to take risks and show us the results, regardless of whether it makes her look good or not. She is modest like any good scientist. In Stolen Thunder II Parker doesn't hide the fact that Emin massively outsold her.  Relation to Emin  I think Emin was a really interesting choice. She's the same age as Parker and was part of the same artistic movement. I don't know whether the two artists know each other personally, but here Parker sets their relationship up in the lineage of rivalries like Picasso/Matisse or de Kooning/Rauschenberg. Whereas the erased de Kooning is a statement on the (masculine) artistic oedipal complex, Parker gives us (feminine) cooperation.  It's also interesting to compare this to the trajectory of Emin's career. Emin started as a rebellious installation artist, but then went to drawing classes and eventually became a member of the RA and one of England's most celebrated draughts(wo)men. Her drawings are earnest (and in my opinion great) but they also function as explorations of a woman's place in the art establishment (the RA epitomizes that establishment). With the Stolen Thunder series Parker too examines her place in the RA, especially since she (reportedly) took this photograph in part out of jealousy that she can't draw so well as Emin, who 20 years ago had no confidence in her own drawing abilities."

museum,344tis,worldwidekitsch,2,Fri May 1 06:42:47 2015 UTC,"I have to take issue with you claiming Boucher as kitsch. Rococo was like 18th Century Pop Art. It's not just an excuse to look at the human body (though it also doesn't pretend that isn't part of the fun), it's an analysis and commentary on the conventions seriousness Baroque and Mannerist art."
museum,344tis,durutticolumn,2,Sat May 2 00:45:58 2015 UTC,"Great reading, you may be the first not to call Boucher kitsch. There is a comedy to his nude which lessens the kitsch."
museum,344tis,worldwidekitsch,2,Sat May 2 17:29:49 2015 UTC,"I think our different readings of Boucher might be the clearest division in our aesthetic philosophies. Since you claimed him as kitsch I take it you like Rococo, as do I. It's a style that's been largely neglected over the past century (at least relative to other periods in art history), so it's kind of a poster child for your pro-kitsch agenda. I too want Rococo to be reevaluated. IMO Rococo has been downplayed largely because it's an example of the perceived problems with art in the eyes of Modernists who questioned (explicitly or implicitly) whether art is a good thing (in other words your own intellectual forebears), whereas you seem to see Rococo as kitsch and therefore oppressed by the art establishment.  On a related note, I don't think I've seen you discuss the Pre-Raphaelites anywhere. Do you see them as kitsch? They have been (mis)treated much like Rococo, dismissed by a lot of the art world as kitsch. However I have always interpreted their art through the lens of a quote I once heard about Rubens (or maybe Rembrandt): it's all about the handling of paint."
museum,344tis,durutticolumn,1 point,Sat May 2 23:41:28 2015 UTC,"Do you want to expound on what you mean by clear division? You’ve made interesting challenges with which I’ve agreed.  I am personally not a big fan of most Rococo - but I do understand it plays a big role in kitsch and there are many kitsch Rococo works. Kitsch is a mentality more than it is a style.   In order for the amateur kitschmaker to reach a masterpiece like The Prodigal Son (and only one has made this specific achievement), they have to go through a lot of kitschy mistakes. And the world is full of kitschy mistakes. And so they are mocked along the way. And many are stunted by the scorn. Wyeth withstood it. Nerdrum embraced it.   Ah the Pre-Raphaelites! great. I think we talked a bit about Millais’ Bubbles - one I believe his brotherhood mocked him for - but there are also these thoughts.   Greenberg in his essay ‘Towards a newer Laocoon’1940 produces a list of ‘kitsch’ nineteenth-century academics, naming some of the culprits: ‘Vernet, Gerome, Leighton, Watts, Moreau, Böcklin, the Pre-Raphaelites etc’  Mark Hudson, in the telegraph says about their pictures, “these images with their perceived sentimentality and literalness remain the subject of a peculiar embarrassment”  I think all in all they are quite kitschy - Rossetti’s “Beatrix”, Hunt’s “Scapegoat” for instance. Millais and Waterhouse were definitely the most talented - “Ophelia” and “Shalott” stick out as masterpieces.  I have yet to see them poke fun at themselves or others, their very name shows a disregard for originality, and they were clearly sentimental folk who wanted to make pretty pictures. The term Pre-Raphaelite continued through the 20th century with Cowper (perhaps there were more) dying in 1958. He was 50 years younger than Hunt and only 17 years older than Rockwell (the ""high priest of kitsch"").  I find that interesting."
museum,344tis,worldwidekitsch,2,Sun May 3 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"I believe our aims are very similar in a lot of ways, at least on the surface. We both want to restructure the canon, focusing on many of the same painters (e.g. Rococo and Pre-Raphaelites; hell I don't even hate Repin, I probably feel about him the same way you do Rococo). However we have different interpretations of those painters we want to champion, so our differing analyses of these painters exemplify our different views on the canon.  I guess if you agree with my interpretation of Rococo what I just said isn't true, but even if I've changed your mind I still think most people would say Rococo is kitsch.  By the way what is it that you think makes The Prodigal Son a masterpiece? The thing I struggle most understanding about your philosophy is how you reconcile its democratic/""lowbrow"" nature with the idea of a high quality masterpiece.  Some Pre-Raphaelite art is definitely kitsch, and Bubbles is an example of such. However I think the genre as a whole is usually written off as kitsch, when IMO it has as many great works of art as any other genre. I don't dislike Bubbles because it's spiritually distinct from the Millais paintings I prefer, I just think it's just a bad painting.  That quote from Hudson gets to the heart of why I promote the Pre-Raphaelites as art. Their images of medieval perfection (with all its associated issues e.g. racism) are confrontational to the modern viewer. And I'm glad he used the word ""perceived"" because in my opinion the sentimentality many people associate with the Pre-Raphaelites is a misperception; I find the works to be cold and cruel in their beauty.  Interesting that you compare the ages of Hunt and Rockwell because it shows the intellectual gap between them. If their lives overlapped and their philosophies were similar, we would expect some sort of overlap in their styles, lives, or at least audiences. Yet they filled such different roles in society. I guess you could say that proves kitsch is diverse, but to me it implies they are from two separate worlds (specifically Hunt from the art works and Rockwell from kitsch)."
museum,344tis,durutticolumn,2,Sun May 3 05:45:45 2015 UTC,"what is it that you think makes The Prodigal Son a masterpiece?   It is the deep deep feeling. It being “lowbrow” matters in Art terms, but is not relevant in choosing a Kitsch masterpiece. Here the word ‘unoriginal’ can have a fresh context - if you’ve ever been forgiven or needed to forgive, this work is extremely unoriginal feeling.   Regarding the Pre-Raphaelite masterpieces - as I mentioned in the Mona Lisa conversation. Kitsch and Art are both ideas - they have their own values. Kitsch is not Art, but a work can be both kitsch and art. I consider “Ophelia” and “Shalott” Kitsch masterpieces for the kitsch that I see in them. I would not try to take it away from someones Art Canon - it is, as you say, the interpretation, or the ‘logic’ that distinguishes the attribution. This can only make sense if one has a neutral or positive idea of kitsch and let’s go of the ‘cheap’ connotation currently in use.   And yes, I would say kitsch is diverse.

Born in Anspach, Germany in 1674, he was the youngest of nine children, and became widely known as “The Little Man from Nuremburg” performing his feats of wonder across much of Great Britain and Europe. Buchinger was only 29 inches tall, and for hands had ""two excrescences which grew from his shoulder-blades, like fingers without nails"" but his skills in magic, marksmanship, and music were legendary. He played several musical instruments, some of which he invented himself, was accomplished at skittles (bowling), and could dance a hornpipe as well as anyone. He was also a talented calligrapher.

museum,342lyi,kajimeiko,2,Wed Apr 29 02:52:08 2015 UTC,"The answer is because Boulter is more and obvious kitsch. The kitschperson has no desire to play with boundaries - like seems evident in your examples - they want obvious, exaggerated, theatrical, pathetic expression.   From the Twombly post:    The successful Artist has understood or happened to follow these rules. A kitschpainter need never concede to them.   This seems to imply a nobility in resistance that you are endowing the artist trafficking in kitsch. Can it also be naiveté?   The answer is absolutely. But again - a kitschtrafficker is not necessarily also an artist."

museum,342lyi,kajimeiko,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:35:38 2015 UTC,You have not made a convincing case that kitsch is not art. Any creative expression of a human is art. When this expression has utility only in appreciation of the ideal it espouses then it separates itself from craft; i.e. someone crafting a bicycle vs someone sculpting a fetish object. OBviously my distinction here is reductive and probably clunky but i offer it as one theorization of the conflict.

Escher  Have you looked into Larry Shiner’s book The Invention of Art? When there is an understood distinction between art (ars/skill/science) and the post Kantian idea of Art we can better discuss kitsch - an ars that is not Art.

Larry Shiner’s book The Invention of Art? When there is an understood distinction between art (ars/skill/science) and the post Kantian idea of Art we can better discuss kitsch - an ars that is not Art. I have heard of it and am familiar with the idea. However, just because that distinction between ars/art did not exist before the 18th cent does not mean I cannot apply it to the past.    You feel empowered by calling much classical art kitsch though that term did not exist before the 19th cent.  Is that book the best on the subject? I have heard others mentioned but i don't know which one is best."
museum,342lyi,kajimeiko,2,Wed Apr 29 06:19:27 2015 UTC,"As Escher's quotes imply ""kitsch artist"" is an oxymoron.  And no he was not kitsch - he made optical illusion pictures.  Your answer is still awaited. Do you see the difference between art (ars/techne) and Post-Kant Art?   Shiner is extremely scholarly on the subject - he is pro-Art so there is no kitsch agenda. Still he sees that Art did not exist until the 18th century, just decades before Kitsch was given a name."

I haven't researched it in depth fully but I have a cursory knowledge of it. It appears to me that an appreciation of ""art for art"" began in the renaissance, even if it was not elucidated till kant.  even b4 that, there is other evidence for conceptions of art:   Socrates also compliments techne only when it was used in the context of epistēmē. Epistēmē sometimes means knowing how to do something in a craft-like way. The craft-like knowledge is called a technê. It is most useful when the knowledge is practically applied, rather than theoretically or aesthetically applied. For the ancient Greeks, when techne appears as art, it is most often viewed negatively, whereas when used as a craft it is viewed positively because a craft is the practical application of an art, rather than art as an end in itself.   I'll read the shiner book."

Here is a list of the most ‘successful’ 100 Artists.  http://www.artfacts.net/index.php?lang=1&living=1&pageType=ranking&paragraph=4  There is not a Kitschpainter or Kitschsculptor among them. A good chunk of what is appreciated here on /r/museum could be called kitschy. And yet the Art system does not recognize the living creators of it. This is no accident - Art is doing what it is supposed to do. And those that really understand and create Art are celebrated. Great, no problem, but what should a kitschpainter do? There is little in this system for them - perhaps some small galleries with feet in two fields. But why go on with the moniker who's greatest leaders dismiss the work?"
museum,342lyi,kajimeiko,2,Tue Apr 28 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"Nothing morally wrong with that.   But you would say there is something factually wrong with that?  What is the validity of artfacts.net's ranking system?  I ask both in your opinion and what system they used for their ranking.  Obviously by popularity some of the most popular artists in the world purvey in kitsch: Kinkaide, Lassen, Keane, even Disney.  You seem to be accepting the art establishment's dictates but instead of confronting them (which would perhaps be an acceptance of their logic?..by that i mean treating it as if it were an argument that deserved contention, debate or discourse), creating an alternative niche for yourself wherein you can hope to avoid judgement(?)?   I don't mean this as an insult I am just attempting to understand your motives for actions/opinions that I perceive to be strange."
museum,342lyi,kajimeiko,3,Tue Apr 28 21:42:30 2015 UTC,"About Artfact: ""The calculation factors in exhibition history, type of exhibition (e.g. group or solo), standing of the exhibitor and also the reputation of associated artists"" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArtFacts.Net  Though a fairly vague description, this is the largest independent source for this kind of thing. It seems quite valid in representing those working within the principles of Art. WWK acknowledges the Art establishment because it has successfully done its jobs: to separate craft from ‘genius’, move art to pure thought, and therefore dismiss anything passé. A congratulations is in order rather than a war.  You asked in a previous post if my words are a defense mechanism. Only insofar as we are disillusioning the derogatory connotation of Kitsch by owning the word. As a kitschpainter, it is not the Artworld that needs to be confronted - it is the word kitsch. (And I am pleased that it is happening here this week). It already exists and it fits like a glove for many. If these sentimental craftspeople don’t confront and own the word itself, it will maintain as a sharp insult - mocking the values some of us hold dear. The word ‘pagan’ eventually enjoyed more neutral use; not because these people pretended to be Christians, but because they stood for their certain beliefs.   Is the Boulter factually not Art? hmmm - would this answer that question?: According to the vast majority of published critical Art theory - it is historically inconsistent to, at this time, call Boulter’s work Art. The philosophers are not guilty of a pirate hijack of Art theory - they are the foundation of it. There are many, but the four corner pillars are Kant, Hegel, Greenberg, and Danto.  Kinkade and Lassen are exemplum of the Kitschproblem. Their money came from doing everything Art dismissed as Kitsch (the not-Art) - making sentimental, cozy, fake imagery, and producing inexpensive reproductions that pacified the public - and so they were mocked and ridiculed. It seemed to inflict Thomas with so much anxiety that he drank and pilled himself to death. An old friend of mine, from the U.S., painted what people called kitsch and over the past 20 years he withdrew completely from all of his friends. I wish I could talk to him now about the positive values in Kitsch. If these guys had the idea to own the word they could have focused on the worth of its values rather the shame of being not-Art. So Art got to go on with a monopoly of the upperclass market because they successfully framed Kitsch as cheap and bad taste with folks like Kincade as the epitome. Even when bad-taste became a fad - it was never for earnest kitsch, but ironic Art - a sly wink to say “we know better than to have such bad taste.”   Most Disney is kitschy, but Mickey’s intentions are seen as so innocent. So if they had said so out loud the blowback would have been, “For heaven’s sake, don’t shit on the kids!!” or perhaps, “ok then, maybe kitsch isn’t so bad!” Selling a lot of one’s crafts for high prices does not make one an Artist - this lacks any philosophical basis - and Art is a philosophical endeavor, with Kitsch as its antithesis. The Art elite were brave to call Andrew Wyeth “the greatest living Kitschmeister”, and they were correct. Kitsch too has its masters.  It is understandable that this is confusing seeing as most have grown up being shown the Mona Lisa, Starry Night, The Scream, and the Soup Cans all as equally Art. If we drew a nice picture we were probably told “ah! Great Art sweetheart!” All the while there has been an out-of-reach, but critically important ~200 year conversation that has permeated the atmosphere - so much that most people commonly say “I don’t understand Art” or “I could never be an Artist”. I propose that they are reacting to Kant’s elusive idea of genius more than the “ars” - learnable craft. Anyone who wants to learn to make kitsch can be taught. There are formulas and repeatable procedures here - but not in Art.  Is all of this to avoid judgement? Emphatically no. In fact the opposite will happen if Kitsch is embraced. Here is Jan-Ove Tuv speaking to that question: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqc-jKty4oI&t=29m1s"
museum,342lyi,kajimeiko,3,Wed Apr 29 01:33:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the involved response.  I still think you are drawing lines in the sand that are too distinct.  Is Chihuly kitsch to you? Because he is fabulously successful and coveted by the rich and shows in Marlborough gallery but is mostly castigated by the cognoscenti.  What about Wayne Theibaud? I might dismiss him as kitsch if I wanted to be reductive but he is a Whitney sanctified artist who is earnest and occasionally pathetic.  I often use the word kitsch in a derisive way or at least in some sense as a detractory term. However, I can still love painters like Greuze, for instance, even though I might not accept his intentions on the terms he desired (of course that is never a rule of art, but on occasion when you can understand and commune with the intentions of the dead this symbiosis can be exhilarating…with Greuze I love some aspects of his work but of course can never avow by his social concerns and allegorical asides)"
museum,342lyi,kajimeiko,3,Wed Apr 29 01:51:57 2015 UTC,"lines in the sand that are too distinct   These lines have already been drawn - to ignore this would be to dismiss significant aspects of Art history. I am only pointing to the lines and finding a preference for a particular side. But of course no one need be on a side of the divide I am talking about. Perhaps you are not, and this may make this thesis feel irrelevant. As said before in another post - there could be multiple superstructures for aesthetic expression - Hegelian Art, Kitsch and others. And perhaps some will enjoy wandering outside of our self assumed borders. I fully advocate this freedom. Most of the examples you mentioned seem to relish this independence of the “undefinable” - playing with the grey. Only a Thiebaud self portrait I saw evoked the slightest pathos for me. You may well not be a kitschoholic and your relationship with Greuz may have nothing to do with kitsch.   Kitsch theory is admittedly Aristotelean in the desire for categories. This is rooted in the desire to create a masterpiece. How can one do this without principles … lines? There can be Kitsch masterpieces when there is what Nerdrum would call a ‘gold standard’ - to aspire to something predefined or solid.  For those more interested in a unique self expression - a true fingerprint of your own - look to Greenberg’s thoughts. For those that truly agree with Danto, that Art is dead, be a zombie! (btw, this very self aware Dantonian conceptualization is what separates the zombies from kitsch)   Imagine, a wild polytheistic world of navel-gazers, vagabonds, zombies and Kitschmensch! And there really are kitschmensch out there - we wallow in beauty and earnestly sentimentalize to a level causing others embarrassment. But in the crazy event that Kitsch becomes a fad, I would strongly discourage those who aren't committed kitschfrau and kitschmensch from choosing a craft in this field. The profession is extremely difficult. So much of what is in “bad-taste” in kitsch is unsuccessful crafting. Well done sentimentalization of a canvas is as likely as successful alchemy.  You may have used 'kitsch' in a derisive way in the past. Do you still?"
museum,342lyi,kajimeiko,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:49:16 2015 UTC,"What is a kitsch masterpiece to you?  Please give me a few.   Greenberg   Greenberg is so outdated that his ideas seem to be mostly irrelevant, save from an art historical perspective. I have read some of his work but his theories are mostly dead in the water at this point, especially among those who hold power over theoretical discourse.   Do you still?   It depends, mostly on context- but yes. The definition that I understand is that illustrated by the wikipedia entry. I am not persuaded by your definition though i find it interesting.  Can you give me an example of earnest sentimentalization (to the point that it causes embarrassment in others) that you find empowering?  I like Greuze, partially for his kitsch value, but also for his formal power and his attempts at allegorical communication.  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Jean-Baptiste_Greuze_-_A_Girl_with_a_Dead_Canary_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg  I love this painting for a number of reasons. If he meant for his viewer to find pathos in the subject then I do not appreciate much of it on that level. I find the image and allegory endearing, but more for the sentiment of the artist in his encapsulation of social mores within aesthetics and for his ability to capture a romantic geist."

I looked at it in relation to the narrative in human evolution – like from when we were half-monkeys till now – basically, how this evolution is driven by what is trending and what is cool. With each new project I go back in history, to the basics. I’m looking into how advertisement is related to nature and evolutionary technology and getting into the root of the problem. If you think about success and trends in forms, it automatically brings you to these timespans of evolution where certain shapes get developed, like why humans have a preference for symmetry and how symmetry is used in imagery. Also how silkworms are taking shape and how they are reappropriated all over again in all kinds of scenarios especially in art and advertising and social networking."""

She oversees acquisitions and wants to turn Qatar into a global cultural powerhouse, making her one of the most powerful woman in the art world today (as her yearly budget has been estimated at $1 billion).  Having so much money available allows her to overbid on any artwork offered for sale and purchase iconic works like the Cezanne or Gauguin. An important attribute of art is that it holds important symbolic value, which is directly linked to the social status that arises from owning certain artworks. The card players, for example, is one of the most representative paintings by Cezanne. There are four versions of it.

I'm also curious about your last comment, the upside-down universe. I take it you're a fan of traditional values, traditional roles, etc. Where do you draw these from? What is their importance? Religion, human nature?  EDIT: just to throw one more at you, what are your thoughts on his portrait of Kate Moss?"

Seriously though, he renders his ideal in a kaleidoscope of muted tones, allowing the abstract patterning of brushwork to exhibit his flair in the least consequential parts, leaving his prowess in delicate shading to safely conjure his archetypal belle; it's not an accurate rendering of what he beheld but instead is a successful claim to a personal interpretation of his culture's conception of beauty and perception."

museum,33qijk,kajimeiko,3,Sat Apr 25 20:04:23 2015 UTC,This is quite kitschy - extremely sentimental. It is shameless in its portrayal of shame.
museum,33qijk,kajimeiko,2,Sun Apr 26 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"I accept that it is sentimental but I am not convinced of the efficacy of describing it as shameless.   For instance, there is no face in this painting, and furthermore its lack of details leave it somewhat open to interpretation.  For a more shameless representation of shame ""Shame, regret, and 'broken' virtue"" (1756) by Greuze comes to mind:  http://emotions.arts.uwa.edu.au/wiki/files/original/79e973a099532740d955b8725b4426a7.jpg  This botticelli is more abstractly idealized, but I see that more as the artist's indebtedness and reverence for classical art. Perhaps you would argue that greek tragedy is kitsch, but in this instance it is not just akin to the pathos of greek tragedy but also an investigation and aspiration to past aesthetics that is established, rather than a pure outpouring of sentiment.  The aesthetic is deeply involved with formal concerns (the figures of classical friezes and vase painting, the exploration of perspective, the establishment of architectural space) rather than expressly focused on sentiment."
museum,33qijk,kajimeiko,2,Mon Apr 27 03:17:37 2015 UTC,"The Greuze is definitely kitschy - made in a time when the Kitsch mentality was not yet shamed so much. For me the Botticelli evokes more pity and tender emotion. There is sadness in both pictures, but even though (or maybe because) the outcast woman hides her face, I think, it exudes greater sadness. Her setting is barren vs the comforts of home around the family. Both works show a distraught desperation. It is a nice comparison you bring and these are just subtle distinctions I see. They both embody emotions usually kept private and the paintings exhibit them openly - this is what I mean by shameless."
museum,33qijk,kajimeiko,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:01:06 2015 UTC,"They both embody emotions usually kept private and the paintings exhibit them openly - this is what I mean by shameless.   Ok this qualification makes more sense.  I looked up the backstory and found this:   In works, the subjects of which were selected from mythological and  allegorical legendry, Botticelli displays his sympathy for all that is  joyous and gay in life, but in The Outcast, a noble picture, owned by  Prince Pallavicini of Rome, he exhibits his compassion for misery.  The Abbandonata, or Outcast, is something more than a picture  -it is a sermon. A young girl, guilty of loving not wisely but too well,  has evidently been ruthlessly turned out of her father's house, to face the  bleak world alone. She has sunk, in despair, upon those marble steps,  which, she probably pressed so often and so lightly in the pride and  innocence of her girlhood. This picture marks an epoch in the history  of painting, and is perhaps the earliest representation of a purely domestic  tragedy in existence. Some critics have questioned the authenticity  of this striking work. The great Spanish painter, Fortuny, drew the  writer's attention to it many years ago, and he, who greatly admired  it, firmly believed it was by Sandro Botticelli and by none other.    The accepted definition of kitsch implies excessive sentimentality. I do not find the sentimentality in this piece excessive. I personally do not take the intent of its original sentiment too seriously, but I don't feel this qualifies it as kitsch.  To me, kitsch , in something of a negative way, appeals to ones sentimental nature to an unavoidable extent, and thus becomes something that can be repulsive if one is hostile or antagonistic to the sentiment it wishes to express/ or the heart strings it wishes to ""shamelessly"" pull (your word but it just popped in my head).   Botticelli is such a great artist that his sentiment does not override his formal power and his conceptual concerns (both of allegory and visual expression).  This may not be an authentic Botticelli, but it nevertheless displays a formal integrity and a quest for adeptness of expression that typifies the best of the renaissance."

It is uncommon to be passive to Kitsch - it can absolutely be repulsive. This ‘pull’ can be wonderful as well - the positive would be the ‘gripping’ work.  I am ok with saying ‘excessive’ so long as it isn't meant morally - the usual connotation. The meaning is ‘more than necessary’. I hung out with my friend more than necessary yesterday and it was fantastic. How do we determine what is a ‘necessary’ amount of sentiment without being moral about that? This is why, if we accept Kitsch, sentimental, and excessive, as neutral terms - this part of the discussion will fade away."

I ask out of curiosity.   I am ok with saying ‘excessive’ so long as it isn't meant morally - the usual connotation.   Excessive emotion can arouse disgust in that it exaggerates something honest to the point of caricature, thus perhaps making a mockery of what it intends to exalt. I am somewhat of a jaded person so I may be wary of exaggerated emotion but I almost always look at art with open eyes, in an attempt not to pre judge it or obscure what may be an enlightening or enjoyable experience.  This exaggeration is especially apparent when regarding kitsch in the apparatus of commerce, where a sentiment is exploited for mass appeal. In this sense, appeal is exalted over honesty in the pursuit of propagation (of images or products in advertising or in kitsch objects/kitsch mass produced art).  Do you seek to exalt mass appeal? If so does this stem from an egalitarian or democratic origin?"

And when, in 1939, a close friend of his, the artist Elizabeth Chase, committed suicide, and he saw her body in the morgue, the experience affected him profoundly.

Isaiah 52:13,14 - 13 Behold, My Servant shall deal prudently; He shall be exalted and extolled and be very high. 14 Just as many were astonished at you, So His visage was marred more than any man, And His form more than the sons of men;  Rembrandt's flayed ox comes closer to portraying Christ physical appearance than any of these catholic images. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Rembrandt_-_The_Flayed_Ox_-_WGA19252.jpg/346px-Rembrandt_-_The_Flayed_Ox_-_WGA19252.jpg"
museum,33oqjp,rolyathd,2,Fri Apr 24 12:54:21 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of paintings showing more graphic visions. Grünewald comes to mind, though he's from Northern Europe.  However you're right that the majority of famous Renaissance crucifixion/pieta paintings aren't graphic. In fact far from being graphic they often make Christ look more in tact than living humans. For instance in Bronzino's version Christ shines while Mary's face is dark and tired. I think this is no accident; these painters were more familiar with the biblical account than most people today, so any divergence from the text is a deliberate choice.  Besides I'm not sure it is actually a divergence. Christ's body was mutilated before and during his execution, but usually artists depict the moments after his death. That quote from Isaiah describes his fall from perfection to mutilation but it doesn't reference what came after: the Ascension where Christ is exalted higher than ever. So these paintings represent the unharmed perfection of the afterlife.  The real question is why didn't more artists depict the torture and death itself. The only example I can think of is Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, but presumably he wasn't the first person to think of it. Perhaps the controversy around that film's graphic depictions would have happened in the Renaissance too, so artists simply avoided it. Or maybe 21st Century critics and curators just prefer pieta paintings to torture paintings, so that's what museums display."

In fact, earlier on, late 13th/early 14th Italian depictions of Christ, or at least crucifixes were almost entirely geared at the christus patiens rather than the christus triumphans type. Cimabue's and Giotto's crucifixes being the most famous ones.  Also, no idea how this escaped me at first, but one of my favourite paintings is Rubens' Flagellation of Christ, though obviously later than the period you're talking about."

He was a superb draftsman, and particularly masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his renditions of dancers, racecourse subjects and female nudes.

museum,33l5u8,WandererAboveFog,3,Thu Apr 23 12:31:20 2015 UTC,"Intro  The more I look at Munch's oeuvre, the more I enjoy the work created by this brilliant man and this painting is no exception. As we live and love, the passion of love and the romance in a relationship consumes our lives but here, Munch portrays it in a completely different angle and whilst it's unexpected, it is certainly interesting and nothing like what I have heard before. Without further ado, let's explore!  Burning Love  The main focus of the painting is in the title itself. Ashes.   Whilst nothing obviously resembling ashes can be seen in the painting, Munch takes the title to be a metaphorical representation of what he has painted. When lovers are consumed by the hot flame of passion, their love burns into ashes.  The scene itself, however, suggests a more ambiguous and complicated content. Sexual activity over, the lovers have separated. The man, in averted profile, cowers in grief or fear while the woman stands erect and faces the front, her white dress not yet buttoned up to conceal her sensual red undergarment. She fixes her hair, whose flowing tresses still rest on the man, forming the contour of his head and shoulders and showing that she still dominates him.   The border  I hadn't actually paid much attention to the border surrounding the painting until I read this excerpt from the website for Munch's work. I'm sceptical about how much this is what Munch wanted to represent but i'll include it here anyway since it's nice to have a unique point of view:  ""Most mysterious is the horizontal form at the bottom combined with the vertical border on the left with its undulating, perhaps flame-like, lines. These elements may be intended as a symbolic border such as Munch used in the Madonna. About another picture he wrote of 'the forest which sucks its nourishment from the dead.' If this be accepted as a clue, what this border represents, following Munch's way of thinking, is a stream of sperm sucked up by a tree, the next beneficiary of death following love in the cyclical process of biological immortality. The man buries his anguish in the corner between the stream and the tree, framed by its vertical and that of the woman, to whom the hair links him. The tall trees in the forest behind also show markings that might suggest drops of liquid.""  Ashes of the soul  Munch is known as one of the most autobiographical of artists and is known to have painted simply what he ""had seen"" rather than painting horror as many deem him to do so. He just does it in his own wonderful style!  This painting is no exception as after the death of Munch's mother in 1868 after a battle with tuberculosis, his father (a priest) is known to have prayed for days on end and late at nights. The young Munch, only 5 years of age, was terrified by his fathers kneeling form and remnants of it could be linked to the shrinking form in this painting.   Finally  Apologies to be putting out such a painting with rather distressing connotations but amidst paintings of hope, future and the beauty of love, to see such a painting charged with deep sorrow was something new for me, hence I had to share it.   Thanks for stopping by =)  Sources:   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/9320749/Edvard-Munch-Images-from-the-depths-of-the-soul.html  http://www.edvardmunch.org/ashes.jsp"

museum,33g1xt,durutticolumn,3,Wed Apr 22 05:47:43 2015 UTC,"As my contribution to the evolving discussion of Kitsch, I present Cy Twombly's Bacchus series. Twombly is an artist I've always struggled with, but seeing him in this light at least provides another opportunity to evaluate his work. I claim that the Bacchus series is Kitsch, even though it looks nothing like the Realist paintings we usually associate with that label. I want to redefine both Twombly and Kitsch (or at least redefine my own understanding of them).  It seems like paintings are Kitsch because they celebrate (or in some cases unwittingly feature) shorthand signifiers of beauty and emotion. For example Margaret Keane's paintings are founded on the cliche that eyes are windows to the souls, and many Realist painters depict emotion solely through theatrical facial expressions.  If what I say about Kitsch is true, then I think Twombly's Bacchus paintings deserve the label. The cliche that Twombly draws on is a relatively recent historical development, but nonetheless it was a cliche long before 2005. Specifically I'm talking about the cliche that is gestural Abstract Expressionism, which in our post-Pollock world is a universally recognizable symbol of subconscious expression. Here Twombly devotes a gigantic canvas to that idea, making his gestures so grand and the image so stark (of course using red, that most passionate of colors) that the symbolized emotions wallop us over the head. Even a child could tell you what this painting means, which I think is also a feature of much Kitsch art."
museum,33g1xt,narcissus_goldmund,3,Wed Apr 22 06:12:29 2015 UTC,"I have to strongly disagree with your interpretation. Along with Rauschenberg and Johns, Cy Twombly belonged to a group of artists who were explicitly reacting against Abstract Expressionism, and of the three, Twombly was the one who most directly challenged their visual language. Whereas Pollock and his ilk sought to consecrate art and emotion in a pure act of creation free of any other associations, Twombly was the one who showed how impossible and futile that project was.   Twombly's work was always highly concerned with signs and symbols, and especially how they are deeply and unavoidably embedded in everything we see. His calligraphic scribbles seem to be perpetually on the cusp of linguistic meaning, as if they were merely a language that we have not yet been able to translate. By deliberately co-opting the techniques of the Abstract Expressionists, he showed that there is no such thing as a mark liberated from language and interpretation.   Now, Twombly's later works certainly tend toward the more romantic and gestural (and I really don't like them as much personally). On a superficial level, they much more closely resemble the work of the Abstract Expressionists, but they rest on an entire lifetime of work that contradicts what Abstract Expressionism stood for, and in that light, I see these works more as reclamation than imitation."
museum,33g1xt,narcissus_goldmund,2,Wed Apr 22 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"I think you've actually made a good case for why Twombly should be considered kitsch. AbEx was surely the most anti-kitsch, so it makes sense the artists reacting against it would skew kitsch even if that wasn't their main intention. And of course the next generation of anti-AbEx, Pop Art, reveled in kitsch (though perhaps simply using kitsch doesn't mean their art was itself kitsch).  Kitsch relies heavily on pre-existing symbols, and as you describe Twombly's work he has a strong affinity with this view. Perhaps he's smarter and more intention than most kitsch artists (who often use symbols simply because they lack creativity), but I don't see intelligence as a factor in kitsch. That said, I do think some of his more symbol-heavy works (the blackboard paintings for instance) are his least kitsch."
museum,33g1xt,narcissus_goldmund,3,Wed Apr 22 22:48:11 2015 UTC,"I think there is an important distinction to be made here. Kitsch invites the viewer to provide all of the symbolic and cultural associations necessary to give content to an otherwise contentless painting.  Twombly, on the other hand, uses his symbols not to dredge up any pre-existing content in particular, but as an investigation into the nature of symbols in general. He is not simply relying on the language of the Abstract Expressionists as a crutch, but challenging it.   I will concede that the Bacchus series is kitschy in some ways, but only insofar as it leans on classical myth. To say that Twombly leans on the Abstract Expressionists is, I think, a mistake."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,2,Wed Apr 22 23:56:46 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your analysis there about Twombly's use of symbols, and it makes sense that this is not kitsch. But I don't see why you say it's wrong see the use of AbEx as kitsch while Bacchus is. What really differentiates them? Is it because of how Twombly uses these reference points, or is because of the concepts themselves?  Is it possible for an artist to make AbEx kitsch? If so what would this require that Twombly doesn't do? And if not why not?"
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,4,Thu Apr 23 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"Kitsch rests on its symbols. It does not seek to upset the associations that it evokes. In these paintings, Twombly rests on the symbol of Bacchus. The associations with wine and excess are comfortable and familiar; it can be seen in the vibrant red and the dripping paint.   Now, if literally anyone else had painted the Bacchus series, I would probably be in full agreement with you that they are AbEx kitsch. It is easy to interpret the large-scale, broad gestural strokes as an attempt to draw on AbEx's established language of free and unadulterated expression. However, Twombly made a career out of subversively encroaching on the territory of AbEx while maintaining a steady opposition to the movement's principles. So, even in these late works, which become increasingly visually evocative of AbEx, simply knowing that they are painted by Twombly upsets those familiar associations with AbEx. As the culmination of Twombly's lifelong pursuits, they become an invitation to see the signs even in what seems to be a purely abstract work.  In my opinion, it would be impossible for Twombly to make AbEx kitsch. His body of work simply precludes that possibility. But certainly many other artists have and continue to make AbEx kitsch."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,3,Thu Apr 23 01:24:06 2015 UTC,"You may be the first to declare Twombly as kitsch - watch your back for the Art police! Based on what we have talked about this is an interesting proposal. Perhaps it shares the exaggeration, emotionalism and maybe even unoriginality of kitsch. However I have a few challenges to its kitschiness.   Kitsch is 'pre-digested emotion’ - whereas Twomblys show us the digestion in process. This ‘process as product’ is a common key feature in Art.  “Kitsch therefore relies on codes and clichés that convert the higher emotions into a pre-digested and trouble-free form—the form that can be most easily pretended.” - Roger Scruton  ""Kitsch requires no knowledge, understanding, critique, or analysis: it is pre-digested and pre-packaged, sparing effort and providing a short-cut to pleasure."" - Eugenie Samier"
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,3,Wed Apr 22 20:47:07 2015 UTC,While the work is named “Bacchus” - a kitschy archetype - I see nothing pictured that is ‘easily recognizable’ as this.   “The objects or themes depicted by kitsch are instantly and effortlessly identifiable.”  - Tomas Kulka
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,2,Wed Apr 22 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"I would say the themes here are instantly recognizable. It's a wild mess, which is exactly what Bacchus stands for. The only people for whom it wouldn't be recognizable are those unfamiliar with AbEx. I guess this raises the question: instantly and effortlessly identifiable by whom? For anyone in the art world, this is way too easy to decode. For the average Joe ignorant of AbEx, perhaps it's mystifying. Though I would argue more people can interpret AbEx than are familiar with the name Bacchus, and you claim that archetype is kitsch."
museum,33g1xt,kajimeiko,3,Wed Apr 22 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"It's a wild mess, which is exactly what Bacchus stands for ... more people can interpret AbEx than are familiar with the name Bacchus   aha! I appreciate the rigor here! This really is a wonderful line of questioning. An extra bonus is that I see Bacchus/Dionysus as a grandfather of kitsch. A sort of counterpoint to Apollo. To appreciate ritual madness or religious ecstasy one certainly does not need to know the name 'Bacchus' specifically - which is why I mention him as an archetype rather than the individual."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,3,Thu Apr 23 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"If anything I would say Apollo is more kitsch than Dionysus. In the Nietzschean framework you're drawing from, Apollo stands for the ideal of universal objective truth and an orderly reality where every element can be clearly understood in isolation. By contrast Dionysus is the originator of chaos and subjectivity.  You associate Dionysus with ""ritual madness"" but within this dichotomy the word ""ritual"" implies an Apollonian rigor reining in the truly free madness of Dionysus. This combination of the two is what gives birth to art; ritual alone isn't art, and neither is madness. Using this terminology, perhaps we could define kitsch as ritual without madness."
museum,33g1xt,kajimeiko,6,Thu Apr 23 01:00:49 2015 UTC,"OK! What if Kitsch is Apollonian in its creation and identification and Dionysian in its consumption, while Art can be quite Dionysian in its inception and necessarily Apollonian in its analysis?"
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,3,Thu Apr 23 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"I enjoy that interpretation but I don't think it holds up. All analysis is Apollonian, and without analysis the world is completely Dionysian."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,5,Thu Apr 23 05:22:23 2015 UTC,Fair. Which is why I said Kitsch 'consumption' not 'analysis'. I should also add that there are inevitably Dionysian factors to Kitsch creation (such as choosing pleasurable subjects) - and calculated Apollo-like moves to manifesting Art. It seems to be post-production where this distinction of the gods is key.

museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,5,Thu Apr 23 02:22:00 2015 UTC,"yes, I think yes, and yes. As for Bubbles…  He has never, I believe intentionally, called himself Kitsch. But as with your Pruitt example, he is certainly playing with it. The Millais' ""Bubbles"" reference is not lost on this sculpture's admirers. Let’s say in a couple millennia, after the intended concepts have faded away, someone finds the sculpture and says “Oh look, a person sitting with a monkey! I kind of like it.” Here is an example of when one can have a kitsch-like appreciation for it. But this certainly is not why it has been praised by Art critics and garnered $5.6 million. Koons claims a complete postmodern paradigm in which everything is as valuable as anything else - he verbally embraces the utter democratization of quality.  And he is praised by theorists for bringing, no holds barred, this philosophy to a logical conclusion. However, if his buyers agreed, they should be paying the same prices for the three other pictures you mentioned. No, what they are paying for, is the idea Koons brings them, not so much the object. So ultimately, he is playing with kitsch’s modern connotation of ‘bad-taste’ (a child-like low-kitsch) - displaying the object while giving us, I suspect, a sly wink to ensure his very very good taste. There is irony here, and as Dennis Dutton, Kulka, Wendy Ryden, Ian Marshall, Kathy E. Ferguson all agree “Irony is incompatible with kitsch.” Thus Koons never gives himself the title.  Inversely, the kitschcreator has an invested interest in the beauty, likeness, and allure of their work. The low quality comes from a lack of skill, not an intended concept. Taking this all the way, the Kitschmensch genuinely aims at high-Kitsch."

museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,0,Fri Apr 24 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"Koons is absolutely kitsch. He is more responsible for the pro-kitsch movement than anyone else. He may not use the word himself, but his work paved the way for it. The idea that irony is incompatible with kitsch is utterly ridiculous.  Besides, I don't think Koons is totally ironic. I think he genuinely believes that art should be non-confrontational, or at least he sometimes believes that. Since he's human I assume he has days where he believes everything he says and days where he grimaces in painful irony. I find it impossible to believe Odd Nerdrum is any different. We can only compare what they say, and both men seem to espouse a quite similar philosophy while swearing off irony.  Anyway, irony is inescapable. It is an implicit feature of language, which can always be interpreted both ironically and not. I'm drawing from Paul de Man here."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,4,Thu Apr 23 06:11:06 2015 UTC,"The idea that irony is incompatible with kitsch is utterly ridiculous.   This is the main distinction (and frequent confusion) between Kitsch and Camp. There are many examples from the names above, but here is an additional quote - “Most theorists who praise camp as a subversive strategy view it as an ironic practice in opposition to sentimental kitsch.” - Kimberly Chabot Davis   Besides, I don't think Koons is totally ironic   Fair, based on his commentary. And if we are to go literally off of the public statements of Jeff and Odd we see a clear distinction. Whereas Jeff defends low-kitsch (and implicitly disavows quality),  Odd espouses high-kitsch obsessively, a characteristic of the earnest Kitschmensch."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:41:50 2015 UTC,"effortlessly identifiable by whom?   Humans. I mean that earnestly. Think of the mother and child archetype. It is the kitschiest of themes, for nearly everyone has experienced some version of this. Consuming kitsch is not an intellectual pursuit. What Samier mean as a sort of degradation actually speaks to its universal appeal. That said, the creation of kitsch, especially crafting high-kitsch, can be very difficult. To render (or code) in a way that the decoding is effortless takes skill (techne)."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"You say humans, but the question is which humans? If the requirement is that 100% of humans have the same interpretation of a painting, then no painting is kitsch. I'm happy if you want to impose a close-to-universal standard (85% of humans have to agree? 90%?) but 100% is absolutely impossible. I'm especially wary of reference to universal archetypes, which are intellectually outdated by over a century; of course Jung lived within the last century, but I find his beliefs to be idiotic and anti-intellectual.   Consuming kitsch is not an intellectual pursuit.   I take this to mean that the act of looking at a kitsch painting requires little-to-no thinking, which aligns with my understanding of kitsch. But what requires thinking varies from person to person. To use an analogy, 2 + 2 is extremely easy to solve for almost everyone whereas 373 x 901493 is difficult; that's to say the first equation is mathematical kitsch and the latter isn't. But to a professional mathematician they're both mindlessly easy. The mathematician may have spent years working hard to be so good at math, but the equation itself requires no intellectual strain; in other words the process of getting there was an intellectual pursuit but the consumption itself is not. So perhaps a painter like Twombly is only kitsch to people trained in art, but does that mean he's not kitsch?"
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,3,Thu Apr 23 00:09:22 2015 UTC,"What if we saw the Kitschconsumers' role as appreciation rather than interpretation? To contrast, Art requires a Kantian aesthetic judgement.  Also, what if we compare Kitsch to fetish? In one sense (high) Kitsch is an inanimate object with magical (deceptive) powers. Ok. But to your point of “which humans?” - If we take fetish in the sexual sense of the word… let’s say even the most ‘normally held attraction’ could be called a ‘widely held fetish’, still perhaps anything can be fetishized. Even for the doctorate 2+2, no matter the ease, is intellectual in its abstraction - but for the purpose of this Twomby-case discussion - could be fetishized.   Further digging into your inquiry, there seems to be a spectrum here - from obvious Kitsch archetypes like ‘two lovers’ to themes that no longer resemble Kitsch, but which could be ‘kitschified’.  An Odd Nerdrum quote could be appropriate here: “Kitsch comes from the creative person’s private space, and speaks to other private spaces. Kitsch deals therefore with giving intimacy dignity.”"
museum,33g1xt,kajimeiko,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:38:29 2015 UTC,"If true ""appreciation"" can only exist with kitsch, then all art is kitsch. In fact this is basically what you said with your fetish example; if ""anything can be fetishized"" then it follows all art is kitsch.  I guess this comes back to something I said elsewhere about how kitsch is a mode of analysis rather than an object. Maybe you're not saying all art is kitsch, but it all could be.  However I still think that's incorrect, because you've defined kitsch too widely. Kitsch as a method of criticism is a quite new historical development, preceded by a rich history of thousands of years of aesthetic philosophy. The type of art appreciation you describe with the fetish example has existed for far longer than the word kitsch. So you're assigning to kitsch a huge amount of philosophical heavy-lifting done by people who believed in Art.  That Nerdrum quote seems completely wrong-headed to me. Kitsch isn't creative; it's either made by people who lack creativity or people who want to celebrate uncreativity. And its appeal to universality is the opposite of private. ""Giving intimacy dignity"" is a better description of Tracey Emin's work than Odd Nerdrum's."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,3,Thu Apr 23 05:52:58 2015 UTC,"Undoubtedly Kitsch is not the only work that can be appreciated. English may be a limiter here. How about 'lust'? The 'interest' to Kant's 'disinterested' determination of beauty. This, after all, was the key distinction of Fine Art that established the term Kitsch in the first place. I have not defined Kitsch too broadly - this has been the result of 150 years of folks counter-defining Art. Yes there is heavy lifting - of everything kitschy that Art has rejected. Would you believe Art is a concept only decades older than the term Kitsch?    Kitsch isn't creative   Are you sure about that? Look to Aristotle's ideas about mimesis. Could it not be the universal feelings that make the private so profound?"
museum,33g1xt,kajimeiko,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:21:33 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean by appreciation/lust/interest, and I'm arguing it has been a valid method of aesthetic judgment since long before kitsch was invented. Since Kant argues in favor of disinterest, that implies interest had previously been the norm.  I don't understand what you're saying about mimesis. Are you saying kitsch is mimetic, or that only art is? And your last sentence doesn't address the argument I made that kitsch is not ""private."""
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,2,Thu Apr 23 06:51:55 2015 UTC,"Kitsch is often described as a ‘window into nature’, therefore a deception. The Twombly seems to be more of a ‘window into his psyche’ and quite expressibly honest.   ""Kitsch is designed to entertain, to divert, to persuade, or to propagandize; the painter wants the viewer to look through the painting “as if it were a window into nature” and respond to the subject matter."" - George Ellis Burcaw  “Art is not the imitation of nature” “The imitation of beautiful nature becomes kitsch” - Agnes Heller  ""Kitsch directs our attention to pictured concepts, events, and objects. We respond to the subject of an example of Kitsch, not to the painting as an object of value in its own right."" - George Ellis Burcaw  “Kitsch is the contemporary form of the Gothic, Rococo, Baroque” - Frank Wedekind  If, after all, you have an effortless emotional reaction to the ‘easily recognized subject’ pictured with in the frame, then you conceivably have a kitsch-relationship with the Twombly.

Though I do agree with Burcaw's statement that the artist wants the viewer to believe it's a window into nature. I think my own definition of kitsch would be that (unwittingly or not) kitsch uses symbols, archetypes, and icons but pretends they aren't.  Interesting that you say Twombly is showing a window into his psyche, because that's exactly what AbEx was all about. But you have to also consider Pollock's famous statement: I am nature. Many artists in the first half of the 20th Century felt the only way to really depict nature was through the lens of the human psyche, and AbEx is the apotheosis of that belief. AbEx suggests that nature only exists within the human psyche, so a window into the psyche is a window into nature."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,3,Wed Apr 22 23:07:07 2015 UTC,"its reliance on pre-existing symbols makes it the least natural thing I can think of.   agreed. It is a window - not nature itself. This is why Plato and Judeo-Christian-Islamic theory has such a problem with paintings, for even nature is itself a copy - or imperfect. Why waste time showing us the shitty nature? Fine Art's answer is an attempt to create something as original as nature - equal but not identical. Kitsch embraces the graven image - the falsity."
museum,33g1xt,narcissus_goldmund,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"Kitsch embraces the graven image - the falsity.   This sounds totally wrong. You're basically saying kitsch and Realist paintings are one and the same. On the contrary, there is clearly plenty of Realist art and non-representational kitsch."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,3,Thu Apr 23 00:39:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that it would be wrong to call all graven images kitsch - this is why Jan-Ove Tuv says “Kitsch does not represent the dichotomy of representational v.s. abstract painting, but rater that of the passionate v.s. the disinterested expression.” Still it is quite widely accepted that embracing the falsity is a prerequisite for creating Kitsch.   This is the first case I've read advocating there is non-representational kitsch. Most published theory would argue against this. My comparison to fetishization (somewhere in this thread) is the only way I've been able to intellectualize the idea."
museum,33g1xt,narcissus_goldmund,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:09:50 2015 UTC,"When you references fetishization elsewhere you said:   Kitsch is an inanimate object with magical (deceptive) powers   If this is an argument against non-representational kitsch, then I take it that means paintings are kitsch not because people fetishize the paintings but because people fetishize the objects they portray.  However I think people do fetishize paintings as objects in themselves. The physical evidence of skill is a highly prized asset. And this is certainly true of AbEx too. Also, gestural AbEx isn't even non-representational; some would argue it's the most objective art, as it doesn't seek to be anything more than paint on canvas conforming to the movements of the person who put them there."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,3,Thu Apr 23 06:32:10 2015 UTC,"AbEx isn't even non-representational; some would argue it's the most objective art,   In this sense it could be called ""presentational art"". And with this there is little to no deception.    paintings are kitsch not because people fetishize the paintings but because people fetishize the objects they portray.   Absoluely, well said. And to this Richard Leppert says, “Kitsch lavishly relishes imitation. Art separates itself from nature as absolutely as possible.”"
museum,33g1xt,kajimeiko,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:55:18 2015 UTC,"Kitsch lavishly relishes imitation. Art separates itself from nature as absolutely as possible.   This is another of those ridiculous quotes that does your argument no favor. I believe you are rational and your ideas are thought-out, but all the quotes you supply are utterly ridiculous and illogical. This one in particular is a false dichotomy that sounds cool but is meaningless unless Leppert provides detailed definitions of ""imitation"" and ""nature."" And I don't see how it relates to the argument I made that people do fetishize paintings as objects in themselves - the sentence you quote was what I argued against."
museum,33g1xt,worldwidekitsch,2,Thu Apr 23 07:03:32 2015 UTC,"So going with narcissus_goldmund's analysis of Cy, it seems this is no window at all - no problem - but an average viewer could only guess. If it is an intellectual commentary on AbEx, it is certainly not meant as kitsch."

museum,339arb,Maccai3,2,Tue Apr 21 05:19:22 2015 UTC,"This is an unconventional type of portrait. It is both affectionate and yet not a precise likeness of the sitter. She can only be recognized in generalized terms as Hendrickje Stoffels (about 1626-63), Rembrandt's common-law wife. With the tip of the brush and only a few broad strokes he rapidly and skilfully outlined her sleeping body. He also used the white of the paper to create not just her form but also the atmosphere surrounding her. Above her head, a thin wash sets off her figure by suggesting the darkness of a corner of the room.  The drawing can be compared in style and appearance to Rembrandt's painting of Hendrickje, A Woman Bathing in a Stream (National Gallery, London). In the painting, dated 1654, she wears a similar, loose-fitting garment. She may have been pregnant, as in 1654 Hendrickje, who had entered the artist's household by 1649, gave birth to their daughter Cornelia. She died in 1663 and was buried in the Westerkerk, Amsterdam, where Rembrandt was buried six years later.  The study is drawn entirely with the brush in brown wash with some white bodycolour. This was an unusual technique for Rembrandt who mostly used pen or chalk in his drawings. It was both experimental for Rembrandt and is most appealing to the modern eye, and reminds us of oriental drawings made with the brush.  M. Royalton-Kisch, H. Chapman and S.

I posted this (yes a repost) because I found the conversation relevant to this piece, which perhaps displays Repin's shortcomings.  I acknowledge he was a good, capable artist. However, this piece looks unnatural and brings to my mind a zombie invasion (the bizarrely false looking enthusiasm of some of the crowds' faces). Perhaps this is just an example of a bad Repin.  I am interested though, if some people find this piece to be convincing in its message. Or maybe I am misreading the piece? Perhaps it is attempting to convey both blind enthusiasm and wariness as well, or people irrationally overcome with emotion (which would explain the bizarre nature of some of the faces)?"

There is also an emphasis on the time in which it was painted. Kitsch is old-fashioned, or out of time. This work does display some shortcomings and is not a strong example of his kitsch.   Repin’s Ivan the Terrible, however, is an extremely kitsch painting."

museum,33910w,worldwidekitsch,3,Mon Apr 20 21:57:13 2015 UTC,"The intention would be difficult to claim. Some painters strive for sentimentality and lack the talent to convey it. Others, like Munch, see kitsch as unfashionable, but cannot avoid it.   “I find myself bringing out work which could be regarded as kitsch - I have worked against that all my life.” - Munch"
museum,33910w,worldwidekitsch,2,Mon Apr 20 22:46:09 2015 UTC,which artists find kitsch fashionable?  I can think of pomo ppl or contemporary people but what is your opinion?
museum,33910w,worldwidekitsch,3,Mon Apr 20 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"Fashion is not important for kitschpainters. Yet there are figurative painters who have eschewed the implied insult. Wyeth was called ""The greatest living Kitschmeister."" Many illustrators' work is kitsch and they found a way to work outside the Fine Art system. Nerdrum was the first painter to accept the name he was given and embrace it."
museum,33910w,worldwidekitsch,2,Mon Apr 20 23:20:28 2015 UTC,Nerdrum was the first painter to accept the name he was given and embrace it.   surely there are precedents though.  perhaps warhol embraced the term. he was definitely entranced by the idea.
museum,33910w,worldwidekitsch,2,Mon Apr 20 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"Any figurative painter who bravely painted kitschy work is a precedent. For most of the public who lack research in this, kitsch brings to mind ""bad art"". While this is not the case, it is a heavy atmosphere to create in. Since the 18th century painters of passé and emotional work have ignored the topic - or worse, used the word to insult their competitors. Those of us at worldwidekitsch believe that if the word is owned with a neutral connotation, then future painters and sculptors will have less to fear in making old-fashioned and sentimental imagery."
museum,33910w,worldwidekitsch,3,Tue Apr 21 00:05:07 2015 UTC,You seem to have a peculiarly unique definition of the word kitsch. Can you provide an accurate definition that you subscribe to?
museum,33910w,worldwidekitsch,3,Tue Apr 21 00:28:18 2015 UTC,"Kitsch is - sentimental, pathetic, theatrical, unoriginal, and earnest expression.  Odd Nerdrum defines kitsch as, “Passion’s form of expression at all levels - with a task of creating a seriousness in life. At its best to be so sublime that it brings laughter to silence.”"
museum,33910w,worldwidekitsch,2,Tue Apr 21 01:11:41 2015 UTC,", then future painters and sculptors will have less to fear in making old-fashioned and sentimental imagery.   kitsch is not necessarily old fashioned.   noun 1. art, objects, or design considered to be in poor taste because of excessive garishness or sentimentality, but sometimes appreciated in an ironic or knowing way. ""the lava lamp is an example of sixties kitsch"" adjective 1. considered to be in poor taste but appreciated in an ironic or knowing way. ""the front room is stuffed with kitsch knickknacks, little glass and gilt ornaments""   But perhaps you are referencing ""The Kitsch Movement"" popularized by nerdum?  If so that definition seems to be somewhat at odds with the accepted definition, as defined historically and by figures such as walter benjamin, Broch, etc."
museum,33910w,monsieurpommefrites,2,Tue Apr 21 00:31:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, not all kitsch looks old-fashioned, but certainly the best kitsch feels timeless. As Thomas Elsaesser says, “Kitsch and myth are both historical attempts to live outside history.”  Rather than being “at odds” with these theorists, the Kitsch Movement is specifically defined by them.  The distinction is the pleasant vs scornful light that is shed on the ideas. More examples of how kitsch has been defined can be found here - https://www.facebook.com/worldwidekitsch"
museum,33910w,durutticolumn,3,Tue Apr 21 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"Kitsch conveys exaggerated emotion. It is the affect of theater. Kitsch is also unoriginal and relies on archetypal portrayals.   If we are talking about works created since the use of the word kitsch, here are some examples: Millais - Ophelia, *Waterhouse - Lady of Shalott,  *Käthe Kollwitz - Woman with Dead Child,  *Andrew Wyeth - A Crow Flew By, *Munch - Sick Child, *Segantini - The Evil Mothers, *Carriére - Maternite, *Puvis de Chavannes - The Poor Fisherman, *GF Watts - Love and Life, *Janmot - works from Le Poème de l’âme, *Corot - The Evening Star  “Within the category of Kitsch we can thus distinguish between more and less successful paintings.

Also, just over half of people with colorblindness are not completely insensitive to red, they can see intense red colours.   That said the colours used in the painting were limited by what pigments were available to the artist, or perhaps the rainbow simply faded over time. The possibility he (or a aid who painted the background) was colorblind is just an interesting possibility and it  will never be known for certain.  I came across this, the artist Clifton Pugh was posthumously diagnosed with colorblindness after optometrists examinded the colors used in his paintings.   Cole, B. L. and Harris, R. W. (2009), Colour blindness does not preclude fame as an artist: celebrated Australian artist Clifton Pugh was a protanope. Clinical and Experimental Optometry, 92: 421–428."

Early Soviet propaganda posters are in my opinion overly fetishized in modern culture. Most great art makes us want to go back to that time and place, but I don't think images of dictators and backbreaking labor really appeal to most people. That's not to say all the art from that time is unappealing - much of the abstract painting and design (particularly in costumes and textiles) makes Russia in the 20s look better than the swinging 60s.  However I think Klutsis' posters are emotionally effective, though perhaps not in the way his bosses would have liked. He's really engaging with art history, twisting traditional visual techniques to his own ends. I'm thrown off balance by the dam, which looks like it follows the rules of perspective (redecing into the distance) yet also functions as a purely element in the composition. This is mirrored by Lenin's arm, which genuinely is horizontal relative to our view. The distortion between these two makes Lenin's body pop out, like a piece of Op Art."

museum,335unh,durutticolumn,2,Sun Apr 19 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"Larionov was the primary figure in Rayonism, which as the name suggests was another short-lived post-impressionist movement/style based upon a single quite literal idea. Here it's not the future, the unconscious, or even cubes; rays are much more fundamental to art than any of those. Rays by definition extend infinitely, but they also have a single starting point. So Larionov's work could be seen as an optimistic beginning to a new art history. And indeed its influence can be seen in much of abstract art (particularly when it skews geometric), even if such art does have a creative limit.  I think this particular painting is decent, perhaps not the best of the movement. But the reproduction is fantastic, allowing us to see how the artist smeared his paint across the canvas. It's amazing that the work feels so rigid, because the application is quite wild. Larionov didn't just dream up a new image, he practically had to invent a new method of painting."
museum,335unh,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:06:42 2015 UTC,"Rayonism:       Rayonism (or Rayonnism) is a style of abstract art that developed in Russia in 1911.  Mikhail Larionov and Natalia Goncharova developed rayonism after hearing a series of lectures about Futurism by Marinetti in Moscow. The Futurists took speed, technology and modernity as their inspiration, depicting the dynamic character of early 20th century life. They glorified war and the machine age, and favoured the growth of Fascism.  The Rayonists sought an art that floated beyond abstraction, outside of time and space, and to break the barriers between the artist and the public. They derived the name from the use of dynamic rays of contrasting color, representing lines of reflected light — crossing of reflected rays from various objects.

As described by Adrian Searle:   Annoyed that his wife wanted to spend good money on an Ikea lamp, Gander went to his shed and cobbled one together from a bricolage of things to hand. It was a bit wonky, and somehow ended up in an art fair (things in art fairs aren't obliged to work as normal objects do) and got sold, so he had to make another. That was sold too and he's still making bloody lamps.

They look semi-functional, like some kind of interior design, but its hard to work out what they might actually function as.  This play between looking a slightly functional setting, but being unable to tell what the thing might actually be is probably the main tension in the work and what I find most enjoyable about it. You could think of them as maybe sci-fi designs for futuristic schools or future-yoga or something.  They usually involve a lot of institutional forms that seem familiar (bad carpet, cords) but are used strangely. The whole thing usually feels pretty estranging, in that its hard to figure out how to relate to it, feeling both familiar but weird, safe but uncomfortable."

It is anachronistic to label anything before this either kitsch or Art.  Art was quite distinct from what came before it. Painting for the Greeks was “techne” and painting for Rembrandt was “depiction”. The question becomes, which does Hellenistic, Renaissance, and Barouqe painting closer resemble? Kitsch or Art?"
museum,332kdc,morecabernet,0,Sun Apr 19 15:40:36 2015 UTC,"The question becomes, which does Hellenistic, Renaissance, and Barouqe painting closer resemble? Kitsch or Art?   Using which definition? The actual one? Or your (failed) revisionist one?  Repin didn't call his painting 'kitsch' either. So, if you're going to go back and label it as such based on your interpretation of his work as consisting of ""'pre-digested' imagery and emotion"", why stop at Repin? Any work of art in Western Art History from the Greeks to Lopez-Garcia fits that definition of kitsch."
museum,332kdc,worldwidekitsch,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:18:02 2015 UTC,"Your definition is fine. Repin's work is very garish and sentimental.

'Garish and sentimental' is your opinion.   ""Poor taste"" is a hegemonic moral judgement that the dictionary would do better to leave out.   That is the actual definition. Your aesthetic relativism can't change the dictionary, as much as you would like it to.   Can we agree calling Hellenistic and Renaissance paintings Art is revisionist history?   Sure, though our modern use of Art is so open it can, and does, easily encompass techne, or disegno, or whatever."
museum,332kdc,worldwidekitsch,2,Sun Apr 19 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"Art fashions have changed. Has Kitsch not stayed the same? Which is more aesthetically relative? If art were as open as you say, why has culture set apart Kitsch from Art and called it poor taste?   Regarding definitions - 'pagan' used to mean evil to the civilized. Now it enjoys a more neutral connotation. The same could happen to kitsch.  “Hauler” is garish for when put on a wall you suddenly have 11 men coming towards you, backlit by a bright sky.  It is sentimental for those that feel the plight of the sailors.  Sentimentality can be deep and profound. As Žižek says,""The problem with kitsch is that it is all too profound, manipulating deep libidinal forces."" Perhaps the sentimentality is part of what you find profound in the work. Perhaps you are more kitsch than you thought?"
museum,332kdc,morecabernet,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:49:35 2015 UTC,"Nice try, but no.  Kitsch meant the same thing then that it does now. The definition hasn't changed, as much as you clearly want it too. I doubt it will change now either, if Greenberg, Benjamin and Broch couldn't change the meaning, I doubt Nerdrum will do it now.   garish for when put on a wall you suddenly have 11 men coming towards you, backlit by a bright sky.   That's not garish. Garish has specific meanings:   crudely or tastelessly colorful, showy, or elaborate, as clothes or decoration. 2. excessively ornate or elaborate, as buildings or writings. 3. dressed in or ornamented with bright colors. 4. excessively bright; glaring.   None of which work here.  I was actually thinking about the socioeconomic conditions in Russia at the time, technological advances and their effect on commercial traffic (symbolized by the distant steamship), the way the Russian rivers have all been dammed and don't have the mud banks anymore, the individual stories of the men in the image, Repin standing there doing his studies, and lots of other things that had nothing to do with sentimentality. You should try opening yourself more to the context behind these works.  Seeing everything as kitsch must really ruin looking at art for you."

Most of them date from the Gravettian period (22,000–28,000 years ago), but examples exist as early as the Venus of Hohle Fels, which dates back at least 35,000 years to the Aurignacian, and as late as the Venus of Monruz, from about 11,000 years ago in the Magdalenian.  These figurines were carved from soft stone (such as steatite, calcite or limestone), bone or ivory, or formed of clay and fired. The latter are among the oldest ceramics known. In total, over a hundred such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between 4 cm and 25 cm in height. They are some of the earliest works of prehistoric art.

museum,32zueu,durutticolumn,4,Sat Apr 18 03:13:14 2015 UTC,"For the most part, my interest in de Hooch is in comparison to the slightly (barely) younger Vermeer - who according to Wikipedia was influenced by de Hooch. de Hooch's generous lighting makes clear the subtlety of Vermeer's sparse patches of light.  That's not to say de Hooch is a bad painter, and at least on a narrative level he shows signs of genius. The woman handing her money to the servant is dense and hard to unravel.  At first I thought the servant was the protagonist; she clearly works hard, torn between a demanding child and a lazy mistress. She also has the example of Venus (pictured above the mantelpiece with her son Cupid) to remind her of the life she could be leading if she didn't work; also on the mantelpiece seem to be some pieces of fruit representing the passage of time and with it dwindling fertility.  Then I thought maybe the young girl is the center. She is surrounded by role models; the contrasting red and blue dresses of her mother and maid are both options for the girl currently dressed in white. Venus and Cupid are in a painting and thus removed from her world, because they represent twisted alternate versions of this girl (one is innocent and young but male, the other female but world-wise, and both are perversely naked pagan gods).  However my real interpretation is this is all about the woman in red. After all, she probably commissioned the portrait. The painting takes the form of an invitation to a prospective husband, like many of Vermeer's works. We see the woman's wealth (as exemplified by the rich fabrics) and the blank mirror shows that she is waiting for a man to fill her life. But of course she already has a daughter, so maybe she's a widow? Or perhaps a woman of ill repute - she does look disheveled and is drinking alone in the middle of the day. Or there may even be (what at the time were considered) darker undertones of homosexuality; it's like a scene at a brothel, complete with a painting of the Roman god of sex, as she hands money to a young woman - were she a man this would be a standard scene in Dutch genre painting."

Upon the young king's death Grey was proclaimed queen and held onto London for a couple weeks before Mary seized power (with FitzAlan cunningly on her side) and beheaded the teenage Grey.  In other words, FitzAlan played the game of thrones and won. He lived to be 68, and also had the great fortune to commission a prayer book that included this coat of arms. Strictly speaking I think the coat of arms is just the oval in the center with four quadrants, so I presumably the rest of the image was largely left to the artist's (or artisan's?) discretion.  The border references traditional illuminated manuscripts, which often feature plants growing around the central image. But here the effect is less abstract pattern and more trompe l'oeil. The background also grabbed my eye because it's a landscape, showing a rather grubby looking patch of life in the foreground with distant Italianate blue hills. This puts it squarely in the British landscape tradition, which from the 18th-20th Centuries was the most British form of art.  It's tempting to think that FitzAlan's main devotion was to the realm, which was why he was always willing to serve whoever England chose as leader (and in the 16th Century ""chose"" was surprisingly common). But this seems like a modern interpretation informed by 19th Century ideas of nationalism, so perhaps it's invalid as a result of being anachronistic. Or maybe FitzAlan was ahead of his time, a man who lead the way to the modern era despite being totally of his time. And (you see where this is going) the same could be said of this painting's relation to the British landscape tradition."

museum,32upaf,durutticolumn,2,Fri Apr 17 06:11:49 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert myself, but here's what I see.  The paintings are composed of an impressive variety of shapes, all of which are whimsical and alive. However the color scheme is somewhat intense with subtle contrasts between adjacent shapes, so in reproduction these have a tendency to disappear.  In person, every brushstroke is visible. Each shape is made of one or two distinct brushstrokes, and the surface texture is easy to discern. So the shapes themselves pop out as a result of the artist's densely applied brushstrokes, against the much flatter and more thinly applied background color (the floor or wall)."

museum,32rwyr,durutticolumn,8,Thu Apr 16 05:36:48 2015 UTC,I knew art prof that used to make students copy a masterpiece as part of a project. For years he refused to let them do Piet because he considered it too simplistic. Then one year he got 3 students that seemed really earnest so he set them up at the museum with some Mondrian paintings and when he saw the texture the strokes the techniques he was really taken aback and really did a 180 on Mondrian's talent. For myself I love Mondrian. His paintings make me feel peaceful.
museum,32rwyr,exitpursuedbybear,12,Thu Apr 16 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"Note that the creamy whites around the edge of this image are the frame(s) (the painting seems to sit atop multiple wooden boards within a larger frame, all painted the same cream white). The painting itself is sculptural; the black lines are dug into relief, and the artist's initials (P M 32) are literally carved in.  I love early Mondrian, and his last couple paintings (e.g. Broadway Boogie Woogie) are sheer genius. But nothing can compare to his mature works, of which this Composition is a prime example. They're images of perfection, perhaps comparable in spirit to the serene Raphael. Mondrian's obsession with right angles showed his devotion (aesthetic if not religious) to the icon of the cross. That connection is rarely so obvious as here, though the intersection's harmony is offset by the imbalanced line at the bottom. The asymmetry builds strength, like a contrapposto stance."

Eh... sorry, but the average joe will just see lines + white and some yellow. Would anybody come to these conclusions without researching Mondrian? Like you've said, it's not obvious and that's what saddens me in modern art. Take the name, the frame and the canvas away and it's just a pattern. It looses worth especially in today's age because computers can replicate and generate such patterns by the million with no help from a human. People won't realize any intellect was put in this or everybody will have their own interpretation making each worth less.  When you see The Rape of Proserpina for instance the average Joe can plainly see and realize the craftsmanship, emotion and in a sense the story of the scene. There is no error in communication. While with Composition with Double Line and Yellow we just learn that the artist in question likes to experiment with composition and likes straight angles. If this was put in the middle of the street, painted on a wall, people would just think somebody wanted to check some paint for his apartment.  Mind you, I'm no expert in art. But then again, what is art worth if you have to be an artist or have encyclopedic knowledge of the creator to appreciate the art? Doesn't this just make an appreciation of the person and not the art?  Just an average Joe opinion. What do you guys think? Is it good or bad?"
museum,32rwyr,promethiac,3,Thu Apr 16 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"Would anybody come to these conclusions without researching Mondrian?   The answer is absolutely yes, because everything you quoted is purely my own interpretation. It's a purely visual analysis, probably more free of cultural associations than any other analysis I could give. For example if I was discussing a painting by Raphael I would reference my knowledge of Christian doctrine, but this isn't required for Mondrian.  However I think you hit on the key question here:   If this was put in the middle of the street, painted on a wall, people would just think somebody wanted to check some paint for his apartment.   You're right that in any other context I would not have put the same amount of thought into my analysis. But this painting isn't on a wall in the street, it's hanging in an art museum.  In fact I saw this particular work yesterday in the last room of a show that contained mostly traditional paintings I bet you would like. The first few rooms included Titian, Vermeer, Velázquez, John Singer Sargent, Reynolds, and many more old masters. After looking at those for a long time, it was refreshing and somewhat startling to see this painting by Mondrian. It looked like nothing else in the gallery, and its oddball nature forced me to ask why it was there and how it related to the other images."
museum,32rwyr,BlaineCraner,4,Thu Apr 16 23:48:05 2015 UTC,"It's fantastic. Deceptively simple yet perfectly balanced, emanating confidence and control. You don't need to research Mondrian to appreciate him, I couldn't really tell you much about the man himself. Spending more time with abstract art in general will help though. You could start with Islamic art if you're having trouble connecting with modernism. It fits poetically well with your statement about random paint on a wall."
museum,32rwyr,promethiac,0,Thu Apr 16 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"It's fantastic because it's balanced? Like I said, the average Joe doesn't see it. An average Joe can say ""a brick is balanced, a kitchen knife is balanced, a square is too... nothing makes those things great and awe inspiring, so why should this be? Because somebody just says so?"" Those things are also simple, why aren't they praised in a museum? Balance and simplicity doesn't make something great, or else millions of other things that fit those descriptions would be hanged on a wall.  Islamic art isn't the same as OP's paining. It's very different from what I see.   Islamic art from what I know can be religious, calligraphic, fractal and in architecture (where is shows craftsmanship of epic proportions, effort). It gains often praise because it's aesthetic and practical and required months of hard work. I see none of those in the painting. The art there comes not only from being pleasant to the eye but also through appreciation of hard work, effort and at times the seeming practicality (rugs, buildings, vases, mugs, plates). And again, why should I study a great deal of different art, which I see no connection with the painting, to marvel at a square a computer randomly puts out every day? Why should I study anything to appreciate beauty and attribute meaning?  Also I kind of dislike the notion of calling something poetic that isn't a poem. Mostly because of the vague definition of the word and complete subjectivity. It has no weight in description, comparison or argumentation. Kind of my pet peve, but hey, it's a minor thing."
museum,32rwyr,BlaineCraner,5,Thu Apr 16 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"For myself, I love a beautifully crafted knife as well. There is furniture in the Met. Obviously with Mondrian we are talking about a painting, but the point I'm trying to make is that art does not need to depict anything.  You are correct that the average joe would probably have trouble with the Mondrian. That isn't really a problem. If art's merit was decided democratically we'd wind up filling our galleries with Kinkades. It's up to you to decide whether you want to spend time with this painting. All I can tell you is that there is something there, and plenty of us find it valuable."
museum,32rwyr,promethiac,4,Thu Apr 16 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"There is furniture in the Met.   I think it's interesting your discussion went this way, because IMO Mondrian is more responsible for this than any other artist.  His art (and to be fair all De Stijl, but Mondrian is largely responsible for popularizing the style) challenges the notion that design is separate from art. A century later no one has yet come up with a satisfactory counterargument, so the only logical response is for curators to put well-designed non-artistic objects into museums.  From my observations of fellow museum-goers, the presence of everyday objects in galleries seems to be the most popular result of modern art. So though Mondrian's art may be elitist, his biggest historical impact may well be the democratization of art and design."
museum,32rwyr,songwind,2,Thu Apr 16 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"I'm really happy I'm not encountering an angry mob that would just downvote me into oblivion and instead people with actually interesting opinions. Cheers! ( ^ _ ^ )>c[]  Although, your argument about democracy worries me. It sounds as if art should be judged and controlled by an elite. From what I know much of actually good modern art is inaccessible to regular people. That the art community is this totally elitist and a self-congratulatory club of art teachers, rich investors etc. What's the point of a piece of art if the public never sees and/or gets it?"
museum,32rwyr,BlaineCraner,3,Thu Apr 16 20:57:04 2015 UTC,"It's a debate that certainly exists within the art community (which I am not a member of by any stretch). I do think it's a problem that the art world is so removed from the mainstream. I doubt the average american could name a single living visual artist (maybe banksy). Part of this is a lack of education, part of it may stem from a certain elitism. Then again art has always been the realm of the wealthy. If anything it's more accessible now than ever before, with the internet and all.  It's also worth pointing out that Picasso and Van Gogh are names as famous as Michelangelo and Leonardo, so maybe things aren't as bad as they could be. The museums are filled with people, day in and day out. I don't think it's that difficult to appreciate a lot of this stuff, it's just that many people come at it with preconceived notions.  Edit: oh yeah, and cheers :)"
museum,32rwyr,sous-les-paves,3,Thu Apr 16 21:16:20 2015 UTC,"Mondrian is definitely an artist I don't ""get."" I don't dislike his work that I've seen. Some of it is quite pleasant. But it doesn't strike me as genius, or of having spirit to be ""comparable in,"" to borrow OP's phrasing. I don't think the impact would be lessened by moving some of the elements around, or resizing the fields, etc.  That said, it's a step up from some other compositions that not only don't have any message I'm capable of perceiving, but are also not particularly interesting or enjoyable to look at."

I don't know."
museum,32rwyr,sous-les-paves,4,Thu Apr 16 18:25:41 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert myself, but I think modernist art requires an entirely different form of looking than pre-modern art does. You said The Rape of Proserpina tells a story and you're absolutely right, but if you try to find a story in the same way in Mondrian's work you will only be disappointed.   One analogy I like for looking at art is windows; looking at art pre-modernism is like looking through a window onto a garden. You pay attention to the scene outside and the window is just a vehicle to show you it, you pay no attention to the window itself. But to look at modernist art is like shifting your focus onto the glass itself - you know when you pay attention to the smears/bubbles/cracks/whatever on the glass the view outside becomes blurred and obscured (especially if you're on a train). Pre-modern art often tells stories and the canvas is almost seen as a limitation which distances viewers from fully entering the scene. Modern art is focusing on the form of the canvas itself - it's not seen as a limitation because artists are exploring what they can do with the canvas aesthetically, not necessarily telling a story. That's why OP mentions the sculptural elements of Mondrian's canvas :)  I think if you try to view modern/pre-modern art through the same lens you are doing both a disservice - both are great in their own ways! It's like trying to compare a poem and a dictionary and being disappointed that the dictionary doesn't rhyme/the poem isn't alphabetical. They're entirely different kettles of fish but both have their own merits :)"
museum,32rwyr,promethiac,2,Thu Apr 16 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not saying that the painting should say a story, oh no. Heck, the Girl with a Pearl Earring has no story in it ( It think ). It's just, well... I see nothing to praise. That it needs deep knowledge of art and the artist to actually appreciate it, thus it makes it (this is going to sound waaaaay worse than I mean to) elitist art. It really is fascinating knowing of Mondrian's experimentation, but if the shape would be put in a random location with no indication of it being art (no canvas, frame etc.) I have a feeling not even the experts would think it's art without somebody pointing ""Hey, dude, you just passed by a piece of art and didn't even give it a second thought"". It's a depressing scenario where ignorance takes away value.  And, to be honest, I may be a victim of such ignorance."
museum,32rwyr,NineteenthJester,6,Thu Apr 16 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I guess I would argue that Girl with a Pearl Earring DOES have a story to it, in that it is representational. Even if it isn't directly illustrating a narrative it still presents us with the foundations to build our own stories from it. Vilhelm Hammershoi's paintings typically give nothing away about their subjects yet I find that fuels my imagination more! Whenever I see one I can't help but wonder about the woman and what she's thinking/feeling. My focus is still on the content of the painting rather than the form of the canvas.   With non-objective art like Mondrian's I'm focusing instead on the relationship between the colours/shapes/lines/textures and the endless aesthetic possibilities that come from them.  But I totally agree that you raise valid questions about the importance of context/the role of the gallery. I saw an interesting exhibition by David Batchelor which was running at the same time as a Malevich exhibition. Batchelor took photos of 'found monochromes' (white squares) in urban environments and created an archive of them. I found it really fascinating that after being blown away by Malevich's Black Square I went in to Batchelor's room and saw endless white squares from everyday life which I otherwise would have passed by without a second thought! On my way home I was actually noticing black and white squares everywhere - they had been under my nose all along yet I'd just paid to go see Malevich's one in a frame!  But somehow it didn't take away from Malevich's work for me. There's lots of art that I don't particularly like (including Mondrian actually!) but as long as it gets me asking questions and entering discussions about it then I can't help but be glad that it exists :)"
museum,32rwyr,promethiac,3,Thu Apr 16 21:35:49 2015 UTC,Girl with a Pearl Earring is the story of a single girl in a single moment. It's one so compelling that they made a movie just to tell the rest.

It's certainly dark, but I think Ernst's message is precisely the opposite. He shows us a world where shapes don't conform to our expectations, and there's all the allusion of high allegory with no clear symbols to guide us.  The only sane response is to set aside those expectations and embrace what the painting gives us - and metaphorically what the post-war world has left to it. What we find is beauty in the abstraction, a bouquet of unnatural colors replacing flesh. It's visually very similar to Francis Bacon, but I think Ernst is more optimistic than that."

museum,32pjss,autowikibot,6,Wed Apr 15 22:39:04 2015 UTC,"Section 10. History of article  Angelman syndrome:       Harry Angelman, a pediatrician working in Warrington, England, first reported three children with this condition in 1965.  Angelman later described his choice of the title ""Puppet Children"" to describe these cases as being related to an oil painting he had seen while vacationing in Italy:  The history of medicine is full of interesting stories about the discovery of illnesses. The saga of Angelman's syndrome is one such story. It was purely by chance that nearly thirty years ago (e.g., circa 1964) three handicapped children were admitted at various times to my children's ward in England. They had a variety of disabilities and although at first sight they seemed to be suffering from different conditions I felt that there was a common cause for their illness. The diagnosis was purely a clinical one because in spite of technical investigations which today are more refined I was unable to establish scientific proof that the three children all had the same handicap. In view of this I hesitated to write about them in the medical journals. However, when on holiday in Italy I happened to see an oil painting in the Castelvecchio Museum in Verona called . . . a Boy with a Puppet. The boy's laughing face and the fact that my patients exhibited jerky movements gave me the idea of writing an article about the three children with a title of Puppet Children. It was not a name that pleased all parents but it served as a means of combining the three little patients into a single group. Later the name was changed to Angelman syndrome. This article was published in 1965 and after some initial interest lay almost forgotten until the early eighties.  Case reports from the United States first began appearing in the medical literature in the early 1980s.   In 1987, it was first noted that around half of the children with AS have a small piece of chromosome 15 missing (chromosome 15q partial deletion).

The figures' ankles are at eye level, so our eyes wander over dirty ground and gnarled flesh. The composition draws our eyes upward, following flow folds of increasingly pleasant colors culminating with the orange sun. Many paintings would call it quits there, but van Dyck forces us to keep going. We can't resist the gaze of the black man on the left, who leads us into a line of sight diagonally up to the dark sky at the top of the canvas.  When I visited London I saw way too many van Dycks and Rubens, and found them quite grating and pointless. But looking at van Dyck paintings in isolation is forcing me to reevaluate. His moral complexity is first rate, even when covering the most overdone subject matter - the gruesome martyrdom of St. Sebastian (momentarily to be filled with arrows) is a prime example. His handling of flesh is equally daring, a genius 180 degree twist on the model of Rubens."

This sight must have been seen thousands of times in the early 40s, to the point of becoming mundane to most people who had bigger things to worry about. Thankfully Nash decided to record it, and he turned it into an interesting little painting to boot.  The setting is smaller in scale than many of Nash's more famous paintings; it's not an ocean, battlefield, or wide open landscape. This is just a little clearing in a humble park. Yet Nash celebrates the space and makes it feel like the center of the world; the blue sky, pink clouds, and yellow hills seem to revolve around the center of the image. The moment depicted seems quite insignificant, a quiet cleanup the morning after battle. But Nash reminds us that this the most important day in someone's life, namely the German pilot. Tate describes the plane as ""totem-like"" but I see it as a gravestone, only erected for a few seconds by the crane but immortalized by Nash."
museum,32je5u,durutticolumn,3,Tue Apr 14 07:08:30 2015 UTC,"Arte Povera was noted for its use of unconventional everyday materials, and this piece takes the cake. Yet for something so plain Kounellis doesn't have to work hard to make them visually interesting; the color arrangement is simple and elegant, like the best of minimalism.  This piece is ripe for some Marxist-Freudian analysis, as is so much of Arte Povera. The peek we get inside the bags is sexual (Schiele's upskirt gouaches come to mind) but the objects themselves are emblematic of the economy - they represent the dirty bulk trade that hides behind consumer-friendly supermarkets.  By claiming that these commodities are art, Kounellis forces us to examine the economic mechanisms of the art market. He's literally taken food from poor Italians and sold it to rich Londoners (the piece is owned by Tate) so they can fetishize the aesthetics of poverty. Having gone down this interpretative path, it sounds like the piece is actually an indictment of the mission of Arte Povera, which sought to turn poverty into art."

museum,32g69a,journalistaccount,7,Mon Apr 13 22:17:50 2015 UTC,"This is a drawing rather than one of Basquiat's large-scale paintings, so it shouldn't be judged in comparison to other oil paintings. Instead we should compare it to more modest drawings by other famous artists - take this one by Matisse for example. It's just a sketch, more like a record of the artist's thoughts at that moment than a highly planned masterwork. So the answer to the question ""why this drawing?"" is that it gives us a little insight into this famous artist's mind, as well as a new variation on a style that many people love.  That raises more important questions: why is Basquiat a famous artist and why do people love his style? I can't answer the latter because I'm not a big fan - ultimately that's a subjective judgment and we have to accept that many people do.  But we can and should understand why Basquiat is famous, which is a result of his place in art history. Expressionist painting had gone out of style decades earlier, and most people thought it would never again be relevant. As a young graffiti artist critics could hardly argue that Basquiat wasn't in touch with the zeitgeist, so the fact that he made Expressionist paintings meant Expressionism must be cool again. Plus he really stood out among his contemporaries (which is saying something considering in the 80s NYC was the center of the art world) by virtue of being a painter rather than a conceptual artist."
museum,32g69a,zachattack82,7,Mon Apr 13 23:15:34 2015 UTC,"You can read more about his conceptual influence. His work captures the zeitgeist of the times, combining references to fine art, pop culture, politics, racism, etc. Just because it appears naive at first glance does not mean there isn't depth. So compare that to tightly rendered painting of say a porch swing. While it might require a lot of skill to render, it lacks any substance. Rendering ability alone doesn't make something good, that's just a means to an end, the end being communication and connection. You can say a lot with only a little and basquiat filled his pieces with ideas that are not easily apparent. But if you look at his other work, you'll see that he does have a sophisticated understanding of design and composition, something that a child might stumble upon but couldn't repeat because they don't understand why it worked."

museum,32fh57,WandererAboveFog,8,Mon Apr 13 11:04:22 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Hey /r/musuem! The weather recently has picked up where I am by a thousand percent and walking along the canal yesterday, the shimmering nature of the water as it ebbed and flowed reminded me of this painting and lo and behold, here it is for us all to marvel. Hope you enjoy it. If you are still around, here's some background!  Intro  In this canvas, Oarsmen at Chatou, Renoir has returned to one of his favorite spots along the Seine to explore again the beauties of the glinting water. True to Impressionist practice, the artist focuses on the glorious spectrum of outdoor light as it floods the landscape. With a technique that is at once dashing and rigorously controlled, he recomposes in paint his own soft vision of nature's radiance. Yet he is sensitive, also, to the wealth of contrasting textures that greet his eye, and adjusts his brushwork to evoke not only the color but the ""feel"" of grass or water or the windy and cloud-filled sky. That he accomplished this double task without sacrifice of internal consistency of technique, or loss of an overall sense of artistic personality, shows how completely Renoir assimilated the Impressionist method to his own purposes. Almost casually he takes in the sweep of the landscape and the happy fellowship of the group of four sketched figures in the lower left of the composition.   The Subjects  The very presence of the boaters suggests another characteristic of Renoir's art. Though like the other members of the Impressionist group he painted landscape for itself, he loved to include his friends in his canvases. The man in this gig—wearing the boater's typical costume of short jacket and straw hat—may be the artist's brother Edmond. The man standing on the bank, similarly attired, is probably the painter Gustave Caillebotte, a devoted rowing enthusiast. The woman may be Aline Charigot, who became Renoir's wife and was a favorite model.  Gently Down the Stream  Rowing was the foremost attraction at Chatou, while only a few kilometers upstream Argenteuil's more reliable winds attracted sailors. Here a man brings a pleasure gig to shore. These two-person boats were designed for more relaxed recreation than the sculls we see in the distance. The rower sat facing his companion, who controlled the rudder by means of ropes.   Nice excerpt from the NGA Website on Renoir's ""Colour Theory""  The painting captures the brilliance of sun and water, summer and youth. In the water, skips of strong blues and white alternate. Their shimmering intensity is enhanced by the equally strong presence of orange in the boat's reflection and the scarlet accent of Aline's bow. Renoir has put into practice aspects of current color theory. The principle of simultaneous contrast suggested that colors were perceived more strongly when juxtaposed with their opposites—orange with blue, for example, or green with red. The silky texture of Renoir's feathery brushstrokes mirrors the languid and leisurely scenes.

I don't know the circumstances in which this was painted, but one assumes it was done at the request of the king or queen to have a personal image of their daughters - like a classic 20th Century wallet snapshot.

museum,32elcr,durutticolumn,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:49:46 2015 UTC,"Neville was a Royalist soldier in the English Civil War, best known for losing a minor early battle.  Dobson was a court painter of low means but great talent, supposedly gifted enough to catch the eye of van Dyck. He was one of the first notable British painters, and his subjects echo throughout British art - dogs, hunting, fancy uniforms, and even early landscapes. However Dobson was not eclipsed by later artists who followed many of the same themes; I would take this over any 18th Century Royal Academician.  Dobson's visual language is distinctive, quite impressive in the restrictive genre of grand portraiture. His paintings range from subtly brilliant to outright ridiculous and are always recognizably from the hand of Dobson."
