PropagandaPosters,3dpo44,An0k,-10,Sat Jul 18 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"Drones aren't usually at very high altitudes.

PropagandaPosters,3dpo44,AlextheGerman,13,Sat Jul 18 14:28:48 2015 UTC,Firefighters can fly very very low. And while birds colliding with planes is not uncommon it's often enough for the plane to declare an emergency. Water bomber piloting is one of the most dangerous aerial activity around. They don't need additional challenge.

Irresponsible drone pilots, who don't do their research and look up local control zone boundaries before their flights, are going to get someone killed one of these days. It's not a matter of if, but when. These assholes can tear an engine apart, which is an especially serious hazard for helicopters and single engine aircraft, so if you're going to go drone flying, either stay out of controlled airspace, or register to fly with the appropriate flight service authority in advance."

There's one anecdote of a bird penetrating a fighter jet's canopy, knocking out the pilot, then richocheting into the ejection handle and the dude woke up on the ground very confused watching the smoke plume from his crashed airplane. Drones are just another thing to distract/collide with/wreck your engine by ingestion."
PropagandaPosters,3dpo44,tinian_circus,-2,Sat Jul 18 14:45:02 2015 UTC,"Which is why it would surprise me if they actually delayed operation just because of drones being in the area.

PropagandaPosters,3dpo44,AlextheGerman,3,Sat Jul 18 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"I totally can buy delaying flights if drones are in the area. It's a perceived safety risk, despite (far as I know) no actual incidents.  It's kinda dealing with the problem before it's a problem. One criticism of the FAA is that it seems to only push regulations after a bunch of people die, so presumably they're trying to stay ahead of the curve here."

PropagandaPosters,3dpo44,Stevethepinkeagle,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:38:45 2015 UTC,"A drone can be a lot harder than a bird and it can damage the rotors of the helicopter causing it to crash.   They do ten thousands of tests on anything that ever takes to the skies, I am certain there must be data or recorded incidents to show how serious the issue is. The poster probably just wants to be effective, but I just wonder what the actual statistics are regarding these incidents. I haven't found any reports of actual collisions so far neither anything other than estimates on the potential damage they could do."
PropagandaPosters,3dpo44,AnindoorcatBot,2,Sat Jul 18 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"Because they're so new. There were no statistics on weather-related crashes before the Wright Brothers took to the sky, nor were there any statistics on de-pressurization incidents before the fatal crashes of the DeHaviland Comet. Give it a few years, a drone will have caused a general aviation incident by that time, and FAA/ICAO regulation will crack down on them. I know Transport Canada is already going heavy on registration and licensing, so hopefully responsible drone pilots (who are well-informed about their own and other operations) will be able to prevent further legislation by respecting others in the sky."

(small note: the term 'Nazis' was relatively rarely used in Soviet propaganda - some people claim it was done to avoid undesirable parallels between National Socialism and Soviet Socialism. The most popular term was either 'Fascists' or 'German-Fascist invaders'; and this situation still stands, to the annoyance of many historians)"
