It restarted 6 times before I finally just swapped the battery for a charged one.

I got a receiver for when I don't want to use my wallet case, and the bulk it adds isn't enough to make any difference to the cases I use.

Battery juice should slowly go down when not charging. This one just dropped a huge chunk for some reason.  Also, there are severe wake locks ('Awake' and 'Screen on' should ideally have the exact same pattern) suggesting a software problem. Your phone is still awake, despite the screen being turned off.  There must be background processes running that shouldn't be running. Perhaps you have an app installed that messes things up.  Restart the phone. Turn off location, turn off WiFi when you don't use it. Literally turn off everything you don't use."
galaxynote4,3dy1pp,wontimeicountedtwoat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:04 2015 UTC,It was the 25% loss at 3pm I was mostly concerned about. The shitty battery usage apart from that is what I have come to expect from this evidently sub-par flagship level phone; I am much disappoint.  I've swapped my battery out to another I had lying around to see if that helps at all in the coming days.  Thanks!

It's impossible to fit more cells in the exact same space. I'd get the official Samsung charging cradle that comes with an extra battery.

galaxynote4,3dxn13,MarcusGen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:04:18 2015 UTC,Simplrom is good :) just look into what extra packages/bloat you want to use and flash them after flashing the rom. They're all in the rom thread.  Ultimate Kernel is also a really good kernel if you know how to tweak it with synapse (comes along with it). I'm on v39.5 (latest) now and by just doing some cpu/gpu tweaks my battery life is now almost as good as kitkat. Ultimate kernel can not be found at xda. It can be found over at a Russian forum called 4pda I think. Just go to their thread and look at the latest comments to find a download link that works without signing up.

galaxynote4,3dzu58,hailnicolascage,4,Tue Jul 21 00:34:02 2015 UTC,"It's just a different ""skin"" for the OS, to simplify. Touchwiz (the default launcher) is pretty cluttered and goofy in my opinion, and I don't want a lot of the functionality like Flipboard or all the Samsung apps. Nova is so customizable you can make your home screens/app dock look and operate almost however you want, though it's mainly used for a more minimal launcher style.  You can fit more apps on one screen or arrange them differently, the app dock on the bottom of your screen can now have a lot more than 4 apps on it (and screens with more apps as well) so you can easily have access to your major apps even if you're switching between different home screens."

Being an AT&T model I've contented myself for now with the best upgrades I can find. Nova prime launcher, long shadow icon pack, zedge Ojai icons on the docks, and I love bright crazy wallpapers that make the icons somewhat blend in. It shows the amazing screen off. Left desktop is all music and right desktop is all tool widgets. SwiftKey keyboard for everything but reddit, Due to the clipboard features on the default keyboard which is the only keyboard I've found with that easy of copy, paste, and clipboard functions. And I really like textra for my messaging app. Simple and effective but slick too. I'm also rocking a new 128g sd card, which brings it to the max at 160g of total storage. Comments and suggestions are welcome. Oh and I'm one of the few seemingly that the 5.0.1 lollipop update helped. This phone is snappy, reliable and has great battery life. No lags unless it's really hot. I've got as much as possible disabled of unnecessary default apps and bloatware. And the only hardware issue I ever experience is the camera not wanting to focus at first but a light rap on the side of the phone fixes that so I'm not too worried there. Reddit is fun by talk little is my only interface with reddit ever and this phone allows me to do everything necessary inside the app I want. It's imo the superior reddit mobile app on the market with tons of features and functions comparable to desktop browsing.   TL; DR  Although not having root available through the att note yet, I am extremely pleased with the performance and customization that I have loaded. Every app I've used here is free and with the guidance and help of this sub I've never been happier with a smartphone."

galaxynote4,3dv05q,m23snoopy31,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:33:22 2015 UTC,True that. I LOVE rooting and flashing ROMs. I'm getting a TMobile Note 4 to use on Cricket and I can't wait to do all kinds of stuff to it.

I still have terrible battery life though. In the last 90 minutes my battery has gone down 20%.

Again I agree 99% of people won't do that.  Voids warranty,  it can brick your phone if you don't know what your doing.    But I feel poprocks or something close to it should have been what Samsung put out.  As a customer tossing a skin on should be a prerogative if I want to.  The best out of the box experience should not have people looking to Oden for solutions."
galaxynote4,3dv05q,deathdealer351,2,Mon Jul 20 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"I like ROMs too. Back when I had kitkat, I ran DynamicKat and liked it.  So far I've been sticking with stock Lollipop, but I'm tempted to try Poprocks.  Looks like a good ROM with some features I'd like.   Again I agree 99% of people won't do that. Voids warranty   This is something I wish people would get over.  The workaround is so simple...  Get a third party insurance plan like Squaretrade, or accident coverage from your carrier.  I think they're each around $5 a month.  They don't give a rat's ass about Knox, and even if they did, you could just smash your phone and they'll replace it anyway.  And honestly, Samsung doesn't actually care, either.  I'm sure there's anecdotal evidence out there somewhere, but I have yet to see anyone's phone returned to them unfixed because it was rooted.  Usually they get it back and it's been flashed back to stock."

After using an s6 for a few days I've been much more optimistic about android. If the note 5 builds on the s6, which we know it will, it'll be the phone a lot of us have been waiting for.

galaxynote4,3dwmlj,Sebastianq28,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:23:10 2015 UTC,"Is it hard to do? Depends on the phone. Some you can’t do it at all. As for the Note 4, depends on the carrier.   Why? Complete control of your phone, like being the Administrator on Windows instead of a “Guest” which is what an unrooted phone is, roughly. Examples: I want to use my PS4 controller for games but it has incorrect inputs. Root allows me to go to the system and edit/fix the controller inputs, to put it in simple terms. I don’t like the Verizon Logo on my boot screen. I can replace it with a clip of my dog instead. I don’t like all the crap apps that came with my phone and wont delete. You can with root. Truthfully, its not nearly as important as in the early days of android. Two examples: you used to HAVE to have root for wifi tethering or even taking screenshots. Now its built into Android. Some phones need root to unlock their bootloader. Unlocking the bootloader allows you to install custom roms.   Disadvantages? You can potentially break the software so that it doesn’t work correctly or even brick your phone. VERY rarely can you do something that you can’t reverse or permanently break your phone (as long as you follow directions). Also, you void your warranty if that matters."

My stock Note 4 runs fine after Lollipop. I play ingress for a couple hours a day, the GPS works well enough to play with no complaints and I expect my phone to die in 8 hours if I do.  If I don't play, I get through the entire day with around 25% battery to spare, and I use my phone a lot. Lollipop didn't make it sluggish, probably because I turn off things I don't need or want. If yours is that bad, make a warranty or insurance claim already.   My old Note 2 suffered severe battery decline after 1 and a half years to the point where I was changing batteries 2 times a day, and I used my phone insurance to get another.  There is a reason I don't mind paying $7 a month for device insurance."

I know that there are tonnes annoying things about it, but if there was one thing apple did right it was the software support for older devices and updates. The only reason why a feature of a paricular new os was not avaliable on an older iPhone was when the hardware could in no way support it. In case of Samsung I am not sure why my note 4, which is a hardware beast cannot get ALL of the features on a current s6."

How is it that I have their latest flagship phablet but it becomes outdated after the release of the smaller flagship?  Why was it that lollipop got released for the note 3 before the note 4?  Why did we wait that long and didn't even receive some of the features from the Galaxy s6?  This phone just felt like it was in the back burner.

Every one know that it is not an issue of hardware, especially considering the fact that Samsung themselves tout every year how much of a beast their note series is. The problem is they don't understand how to make a cohesive software experience to fit that hardware. Some guy thinks of an average idea, it gets baked in, it takes more time to make it compatible with new versions of android leading to long development times. Samsung makes stellar hardware but when married with their software support, its hot garbage.   Why not continue delaying updates over and over again when they know eventually you will end up buying the new version of their phone? With the added phone of the S6 edge plus this year, its going to add further fragmentation in their development efforts. Good luck ever getting M on the Note 4.  When this years nexii come out, I am sticking with it for the long haul. I am just hoping they place a half decent camera and include a large screen (big battery reasons). These are the only two reasons I chose to go with the note 4 in the first place."

I've seen people say there are GPS issues with Lollipop but I don't see it. I was driving the other day and opened Google Maps and the GPS locked onto my location instantly. Battery life is about the same as it was on Kit Kat. The Recents menu takes about a half second to open. I just don't see all these issues people say they're having.

Which is basically an improved version of stock that's deodexed. I install the Samsung xposed beta and it works just fine.   Id basically find your model on XDA then go to the android development forum and start reading about the various roms. I'm sure you'll find one that'll work.
galaxynote4,3dwjnq,Mdisbrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:47 2015 UTC,"Reread your post and noticed you did provide a model number. Looks like it's a us cellular variant. Not much I found on XDA, I'd did find this though http://teamuscellular.com/Forum/forum/421-note-4-roms-kernels-recoveries-mods/. Looks like there is a few deodexed rims on there. Just make sure you flash the one with the correct baseband. Is lollipop not out for your version?  Edit: may also want to read through this topic http://teamuscellular.com/Forum/topic/8402-what-are-some-good-sprint-tw-roms-that-work-with-our-phones/. Apparently there is a way to get sprint roms to work with your phone. If you can figure it out id suggest using Noterized. I've been using it for 2 months with zero issues. Unfortunately the phone you have doesn't have a very big community building roms for it."
galaxynote4,3dwjnq,Mdisbrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:52 2015 UTC,So I got one of the deodexed stock roms available for my phone and that went fine but then when i went to flash the xposedbridge 61 thing it wouldnt go past the us cellular lte splash screen.

galaxynote4,3dwjnq,Mdisbrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:08 2015 UTC,No idea. Did you let it sit for like 15-20 minutes just to make sure. After installing xposed it takes a long time to boot up the first time.

galaxynote4,3dsius,Baderkadonk,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:52:15 2015 UTC,"This really isn't true.  The quick-charging shuts off if the temperature gets too hot.     And if you have ceramic tile or stone counter top to rest the device on, it doesn't even feel warm during a quick-charge and it actually gets topped up faster since the battery is staying cool.   Even so... if your battery is getting hot because you do something dumb like recharge it while it's sitting on your couch cushion, the device voltage will automatically drop when your battery heats up.     Your battery gets much hotter during mobile network usage, video playback, or gaming than it does when it quick charges."

galaxynote4,3dsius,seano910,6,Sun Jul 19 06:15:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I thought I was crazy.   And fwiw,  the nexus phones tend to be of lesser quality. I had the nexus 5 and broke 2 screens by keeping it in my pocket. It was the last and only time I will own one.   I have the note for the note feature. I have yet to have shitty battery life or filled my internal storage. Luckily I have true unlimited data and don't rely on SD cards. The reason for the removal of SD card imo is the move to cloud storage.   Now, if it has a standard 64gb internal,  which is not crazy considering the note general has 2x the s series has for internal storage, I will upgrade. Plus they are saying over a 4k mah battery will be included,  which is more than a 25% increase over the 4.   I'm sure I'll be down voted but this entire sub reddit has turned to a complete bitch fest and a place to post photos."
galaxynote4,3dsius,port53,7,Sun Jul 19 06:56:25 2015 UTC,"I have yet to have shitty battery life or filled my internal storage.   I can't say the same - I spent a lot of time on airplanes, I got my Note 4 so I could ditch carrying a separate phone and tablet and still have a decently sized screen for watching video in the air whilst still having a device small enough to carry around normally the rest of the time.  I load up with entertainment because even if the flight has wifi I still can't (realistically) stream over it, and in my last 8 flights wifi has only worked on 3 of them anyway.  I have about 60GB of movies and music on my Note 4 right now, plus, all the usual apps, pictures, videos, etc. that normally use up space.  Then it comes to battery.  My flights tend to be 5-8 (US East to US West or Europe) hours and sometimes 13-14 hours (US East to Asia).  While I do tend to have power available, tethering myself to that power is such a PITA.  With a removable battery I can swap mid-flight and let my spare charge nicely tucked out of my way, it also stops my phone from heating up so much.  My usage pattern doesn't allow me to consider phones without at least 128GB of storage (of any kind) and a removable battery.  I understand that this isn't an issue for lots of people, but since I'm being asked, I'll tell you it is for me."

Because then I would have to hold 2 devices in my hand, or balance 2 devices on the tray table, and unless I wanted to have 2 devices in my pocket through the airport now I'm going to have to fish/put that 2nd device out of my backpack (in the overhead) when I get on/off planes - sucks to be me if I'm stuck in a window seat and can't easily access it.  It's a whole 'nother thing to manage, double the trouble and for no benefit.  Plus, I can't idly start/continue watching something on transit or while I'm waiting at the gate/for my bags/etc. without further pulling out this second device.  This doesn't even take in to consideration using that storage for photos and video I take, unless I enjoy having another device swinging from my phone while I take pictures.  I detest having my phone tethered to anything while I'm trying to use it.  I hate cables.  I sprung for a nice bluetooth headset so that I don't even have that cable, I sure don't want to add one just for storage that's only available part time.  I never put my phone on charge while I'm using it, it charges overnight and in my car (in it's cradle when I'm not using it), the rest of the time I'm swapping in the spare battery and charging that, somewhere far away from my phone and my hands."

At first I thought I could get around this by having USB OTG, but ain't nobody got time for that.  Also, I'm still not a fan of not allowing removal of the battery for any phone, period.  The are too many variables in the Android ecosystem (especially with more bloat from carriers and manufacturers) to not allow this.

The best guesses at that time were that the Note 5 would include the worst of the S6, including shatterable glass on the back, non-removable back/battery, and no SD card support.

I agree it's stupid, but it is possible Samsung was responding to this tired comment by so many reviewers.  The amount of time in any review spent on the cosmetic details of its case (which, as you point out, tends to be hidden by a case anyway) has always been irksome to me.  This isn't just a problem in cell phones either; it's a prejudice that certain materials ""feel"" more durable than others, even when that may well not be the case."

galaxynote4,3dsius,sureguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:51 2015 UTC,"Samsung Pay probably plays a role in the non-removable battery as it offers an extra layer of security which allows you to remotely wipe the data on your phone without someone being able to pull the battery first. I'm sure Samsung being able to offer this additional layer of security is part of the reason they have been able to pull in so many banks and processors to partner with on Samsung Pay.  I'm one of those people who really don't see the benefit of the microSD. Sure it's cheaper storage, but it's also slower. I don't need it, I rarely have ever used my microSD in my Note 4. If I absolutely want to transfer files or have extra storage for stuff I want to stream, but don't want on my phone, I have an airstash. It fits in my pocket and works wirelessly.  As for the battery, the battery on these charge extremely fast and they have a large capacity. Perhaps the only reason I can think of people wanting a user replaceble battery is to replace the battery after a few years of use. I personally will probably only have the phone for a year before upgrading, so that's not really a concern for me."
galaxynote4,3dsius,zombiimatt,2,Sun Jul 19 10:06:20 2015 UTC,"I never thought about the security level. I suppose that is logical, but I still am not happy about it.

galaxynote4,3dv59j,MarcusGen,2,Tue Jul 21 13:28:10 2015 UTC,"The fingerprint scanner on the Note 4 isn't the most fantastic thing in the world.  However, this helped me:  1: Develop a consistent way of swiping and practice doing it the same way.  In my case, I use my index finger.  I straighten the finger rigidly, then position it such that the fingerprint sensor is just  above the first knuckle.  Never got the one-handed thumb swipe to work right.   Then I pull it downward steadily, rocking the pad of my finger so that every bit of it touches the sensor.  That is, while holding my finger straight, I pull my hand back or up from the phone slightly so the ""up swing"" of the tip of my fingerprint hits it totally. Once you feel you can do this consistently, re-train the sensor.   The ability to be extremely consistent in how you swipe seems to be key here.  While I still occasionally get mismatches doing it this way, I never get the ""scan slower"" message, which I used to.  Even with the failures, it's still faster, for me, than entering a passphrase.  Also, clean everything regularly.  I think this can be better, and I suspect in coming years we will see better and better sensors.    But you are not the only one to be frustrated by this.  It just took practice being consistent and a few re-training sessions.  It's much better now for me."
galaxynote4,3dv59j,MarcusGen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"This is probably the problem, I am not exactly consistent. A pin just seems easier than related attempts. It is frustrating, my husband loves the fingerprint scanner on his iPhone."

In the end, yes there will probably be more amoled stuff in the future of samsung because of themes. But I doubt they will actually give us note 4 users it. Like allot of the rumors that have been posted (over and over again), Samsung really isn't giving the note4 love because the note5 is right around the corner. If they gave us themes, we would be able to have an AMOLED theme. But they won't. Now we're relying on custom ROMS to have themes which is why I won't be buying another samsung again.

Considering that Samsung now goes to great lengths to lock down bootloaders/root on my carrier, the sluggishness compared to the GS III that I used previously (admittedly, running CM instead of TouchWiz), slow updates, and lack of any commitment for future upgrades- this will be my fifth and final Samsung smartphone.  Don't get me wrong- the hardware is phenomenal. The screen is perfect and the camera takes some amazing shots, and I love the S pen.

Before u do anything via Odin make sure u can install twrp first and make multiple backups of ur phone thru twrp and thru Samsung kies (I forget what version of kies has the ability to backup phones). If the retail doesn't have the ability for twrp yet I would not risk it as you might brick ur phone (either hard or soft brick) if its a soft brick then u can use kies to reinstall stock android. If its a hard brick then the phones done.    I would do more research in that thread and find out if u can get twrp on the retail.  If u have any other questions I might be able to help. I'll tell u if I can or can't so don't be afraid to ask.  Good luck!

So anyway, I used the TWRP Manager app and selected the latest version for my device (SM-N910F International) and clicked install. It said success and rebooted my phone. This resulted in a boot loop that made my phone start in Odin/download mode no matter what I tried (hold down+home+power etc.) Had to flash stock firmware to fix it and re-root. Don't know if I have the balls to try something like that again. I wonder what went wrong. It said it was successful in the app, but obviously it wasn't much of a success. Reading a bit more it seems Xposed is available for  deodexed (Touchwiz lollipop) ROMs. I don't know if I want to deal with more of that stuff after the boot loop experience."
galaxynote4,3dluso,Intermeadiate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:40:06 2015 UTC,Just flash a deodexed rom. Most are more stable than stock anyway as they're debloated and optimized. As long as you know what you're doing its no big deal
galaxynote4,3dluso,Elements95,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:31:38 2015 UTC,TWRP manager probably has not been updated for the new firmware. I personally always get recovery with Odin

If you get the international version, head over to XDA and you'll find some Touchwiz based lollipop versions. I use Megatooth V4 in combination with the Emotion Kernel and it works fine. You just have to restart your phone every 3 days or so because of the memory leak in Lollipop.  You can even install Xposed with that FW, so you can tweak a lot, especially when it comes to battery life."

galaxynote4,3dmnzs,nathan_NG,3,Fri Jul 17 14:55:01 2015 UTC,First one is impossible to tell. Second one is probably a Note 4 indicated by the square camera and no heartrate monitor right to the camera lens (as with the S5). Heart rate monitor of the Note 4 is below the camera lens.

Throwing xposed on it to get further customization is the only thing I would plan on doing.

galaxynote4,3dmtc1,juggles321,2,Fri Jul 17 15:27:10 2015 UTC,Did u do an over the air update or did u do a custom ROM?   If u did a custom ROM then u need to find the Google apps package that is compatible with the ROM u used.  If its stock and u still can't get it to sync I would hard reset the phone.

galaxynote4,3dji93,Jondx52,9,Thu Jul 16 19:48:17 2015 UTC,My battery dies at 12-15% every time. There is no way in hell I'm getting another phone without a removable battery. No sd slot is fine as long as i have more than 25gb of the storage available.
galaxynote4,3dji93,MundoDexter,22,Thu Jul 16 22:56:22 2015 UTC,Note 4 will be the last Samsung device for me. Samsung has given little to no attention to the Note 4 and has proven that they do not provide LTS (long term service) regardless if its a flagship model or not. I can't wait to see some news on the new NEXUS line up.
galaxynote4,3dji93,MnokeR,6,Thu Jul 16 22:48:06 2015 UTC,"I'm with you 100%. Touchwiz is ugly and if we can't get the same experience that S6 users have I'm done. I also can't root cause Verizon, fucking cunts..."
galaxynote4,3dji93,MundoDexter,2,Thu Jul 16 22:57:35 2015 UTC,October can not come any faster. When switching from my Nexus 5 I chose the Note 4 over the Nexus 6 because of the added features and quickly learned they are nowhere near worth the hassle.  I don't use half of them as much as I thought I would and my phone locks up completely every time it switches between wifi and 3g/4g.
galaxynote4,3dji93,Dahly,2,Fri Jul 17 03:05:41 2015 UTC,as nexus 7 2013 LTE tablet owner i can't agree with. google itself messed up things with L/M. when LG delays wi-fi support for GWR i lost my hope for android in any form and brand and now my note 4 got battery problem. likely i will go back to iphone. mistakes were made.

galaxynote4,3dji93,idavyko,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:37 2015 UTC,"You got this wrong dude. Samsung makes the software. Carriers add in there extra features such as wireless calling or whatever bloatware they want.  Its up to Samsung to update there devices to the latest and greatest but so far they have proven that they will not.  The S6 has the latest TW version. Yet there other Flagship device, the Note 4, is left with old software. What makes it worse is that the Note 4 has not even hit the 1 year mark. So tell me good sir, what does the carrier have to do with the software, besides adding there own touches?"

I've had phones with removable batteries since 2011 and I can't imagine having a phone without that feature. Same for micro SD cards. I've had one in all my phones since 2011 and I listen to lossless music and basically all the available storage on my micro SD is dedicated to music. I will not settle for shitty streaming quality. Good bye note series and fuck you Samsung."
galaxynote4,3dji93,Diabolicat,4,Fri Jul 17 03:17:50 2015 UTC,"I just got the Note 4 a few weeks ago. I didn't realize the Note 5 was right around the corner, so I'll probably get the Note 5 since I am on Jump on Demand."
galaxynote4,3dji93,the_the_the_,2,Fri Jul 17 11:36:06 2015 UTC,"I was surprised it would be coming out a year or a little less after. I can deal with smaller memory and no battery but only if the battery is in fact 4,000 mah or larger. I usually like to get it release day/week but I might wait it out for some reviews so im not stuck with something not as usefull as the Note 4 and have to use another of my jumps back to the note 4"
galaxynote4,3dji93,Dahly,3,Thu Jul 16 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"No offense, but why are you surprised? The release cycle for the Note series has been pretty consistent. They always release a new version at the end of Q3/beginning of Q4."

galaxynote4,3df8ke,ryanelawrence,2115,Wed Jul 15 20:22:22 2015 UTC,"GPS issues on the Note 4 are well known and not limited to carrier. You will find all sorts of crazy fixes out there, but I will tell you what finally worked for me.    I noticed that every time I went to take a screenshot the GPS would suddenly snap back to working. After some messing around I realized that holding it by the sides with a little pressure gets it working. Basically hold it the way that Steve Jobs told you you shouldn't hold an iPhone and squeeze a bit. That always gets my GPS to work within a few seconds. It sounds crazy but for me I've confirmed it absolutely works.      Basically Samsung sucks at GPS in general, and especially with the Note 4. I think the receiver is using a poorly manufactured antenna that is the wrong size or something, and by attenuating the signal a little bit you can get it to clear up. It's like adjusting you rabbit ears and having them only work when you stand in a certain position... if you are old enough to remember doing such things.    Give it a try and report back."

I haven't had the rampant GPS issues some people are having, but occasionally it does give me problems. I tightened my screws and a GPS test is showing 14 satellites in use out of 19 in view with an accuracy up to 33 feet, which I think is pretty strong. It also shows me facing the correct direction, where it showed me facing the opposite direction every time before.   But also the phone feels more solid in general and doesn't creak when I squeeze the back, so 9/10 would recommend tightening the back screws."

galaxynote4,3df8ke,bob_in_the_west,32,Thu Jul 16 14:20:55 2015 UTC,Sounds more like Samsung sucks at producing good contacts that hold their connection as time passes.  When i still used my HTC Desire HD I (and many others like me) also had the problem that GPS wouldn't work at all or very poorly. The problem consisted of contacts between the mother board and the antenna (which was in the/a backcover) becoming black and thus nonconducting.  So if squeezing the phone restored your signal then you most likely need to find the Note 4's GPS antenna (which is likely integrated into the internal back cover) and stuff some metal foil between the antenna and its connector on the phone.  Edit: a word
galaxynote4,3df8ke,cuntRatDickTree,10,Thu Jul 16 09:55:07 2015 UTC,"and stuff some metal foil   Ugh, like getting the 360 battery packs to stop falling out >_<. Why can't things just be designed properly?"

galaxynote4,3df8ke,Combat_Wombatz,3,Thu Jul 16 15:44:16 2015 UTC,Loctite works wonders in these situations.
galaxynote4,3df8ke,Dark_Knight_Reddits,3,Thu Jul 16 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"Just want to give some extra info if someone decides to use Loctite.  I don't have an S3, but just be careful not to use any Loctite for any screws into plastic. Also do not use red and blue Loctite on the tiny screws on a phone, you will never get them out again without damaging something. Purple is the preferred Loctite for the little screws on a phone but I found it to be less common. Start with a super small amount and increase if needed. You might be able to use Green Loctite, which is the next step up from Purple. But use an incredibly tiny amount if you ever plan to get those screws out again. The stuff takes around 24 hours to cure.  You just want it so the screws don't back out. You're not wanting to basically cement those screws into place."
galaxynote4,3df8ke,BagOfGuano,3,Thu Jul 16 16:26:28 2015 UTC,I know this is a dangerous question to ask on reddit but here goes - are you serious?  Can you use loctite inside small electronics like this?
galaxynote4,3df8ke,Combat_Wombatz,4,Thu Jul 16 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. Loctite comes in different strengths. Red is strongest, blue is medium, purple is weak. There is also green, which penetrates into already-threaded gaps. As someone mentioned elsewhere, you want to use the weak stuff (purple) on small electronics and don't over-apply."
galaxynote4,3df8ke,Zelarius,2,Thu Jul 16 17:22:46 2015 UTC,"there's a post above yours that answers you question, but basically you should only use weak loctite, and sparingly."
galaxynote4,3df8ke,mistab777,5,Thu Jul 16 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"Another thing that helps, TURN OFF ""high accuracy"" and set it to ""gps only"" in location settings. I use my note for gps in my work truck and this is the only thing that has helped get a quick and accurate lock.  One more thing, if you have your phone on a mount in a vehicle, make sure it's a dash or windshield mount, it really needs a clear view of the sky to find you."
galaxynote4,3df8ke,perona13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, disabling ""high accuracy"" is what fixed the GPS problems I had with my Note 2."

galaxynote4,3df8ke,gthing,2,Thu Jul 16 13:53:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Samsung won't even acknowledge the problem. I talked to a Samsung rep at Best Buy and he just said ""oh yea, mine does the same thing."""

galaxynote4,3df8ke,gthing,29,Thu Jul 16 17:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's not ideal. But it seems like once it has a fix it starts working without needing to constantly hold it. YMMV.    A fun thing to do is open GPS Status and watch as it struggles to get even one clear signal from one satellite. Then grip the phone as described and watch them all suddenly pop up to green.    The best solution would be for Samsung to stop making shitty phones, but I'm not going to hold my breath."
galaxynote4,3df8ke,kidbackstab,14,Thu Jul 16 01:52:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, this solution is bonkers, because this is exactly how I got my phone to work maybe a month or so back while driving to Milwaukee.

Held my phone like that out of superstition for the next two hours without a single hiccup.   You, sir. You're on to something."

The antenna are on the back of the case, there are spring loaded metal contacts on the front part of the phone (where everything is).  Squash it too hard the contacts wont return to their original position, squash it again in the right places your signal etc goes up, do this too much and you just make it worse.  Quick solution: open case, bend contacts up a bit, sorted - for now.  Better solution: open case, solder tiny wires between each part, sorted."

I usually leave mine turned off when I'm not using it to extend battery life and noticed GPS was taking ages to get a fix on my S3.  Read up on it and it turns out the phone uses the mobile towers to help in getting a fix on location if mobile data is turned on.  Also speeds getting a GPS fix up on my newer S5.

I have tried couple of the CM12.1 Roms available but always returned back to TW based rom because of bugs and FC's. Can you link to the Rom your using and if you have come across any bugs/FC's with certain apps?
galaxynote4,3diqu0,MnokeR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"I'm just using the ""nightly"" build (12.1-20150712-NIGHTLY-trltetmo). It was a little odd when I first flashed this ROM... It was laggy, 4G/LTE didn't work, and the phone was getting warm. I went back into TWRP, wiped everything twice, and reinstalled it again... Suddenly everything worked perfectly.  Nothing FC's on me except the native and Google camera app that I tried. Snap Camera HDR will lag a little bit when switching from front to rear camera, but otherwise works great. Everything else functions faster and smoother than Touchwiz."
galaxynote4,3diqu0,FrankLikesTanks,3,Thu Jul 16 22:26:19 2015 UTC,"AOSP Android has more features   Such as? As far as I can see AOSP is very dry, they are barely implementing features Touchwiz has had for years such as multi window, fingerprint scanning, volume controls, screenshot deletion via notification panel.  While yes CM12 is significantly faster than an unmodified stock Touchwiz, I would argue that the best bang for your buck would be a optimized, modified Touchwiz from XDA such as FireKat (Pop Rocks for Lollipop), DynamicPop, or Rapture. You keep all of Touchwiz's features and more, have the option of changing theme and UI via ROM setting or Xposed (KitKat only I believe), keeping Touchwiz's great camera optimization, keep all Spen functionality, private mode, and ect.   Though the best part about ROM flashing is that you can choose whatever ROM suits you the best! If you love CM12 and its speeds over Touchwiz, that's great! Thanks for the review, I haven't used CM12.1 on my Note 4 yet, but I will definitely check it out."
galaxynote4,3diqu0,PDXMatthew,3,Thu Jul 16 17:49:40 2015 UTC,"I'm using Allience ROM Lollipop with Xposed. You just have to flash Xposed Framework via recovery with Lollipop then install the Xposed installer apk. No big deal really. It's super speedy (60k Antutu and yes I know benchmarks aren't the be all end all), customizable and doesn't lose any TouchWiz features. Best of all it's TMo based so you still have VoiP, HD calling and WiFi calling. The only thing it really doesn't do much for is the recents menu lag. I don't use it often so I don't care much. I also clear it out periodically so it's not quite as slow."

galaxynote4,3diqu0,TimeWasterNinja,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"If possible, you might want to root. Rooting, rebloating, and using Xposed modules to change the default gallery app to QuickPic makes a big difference in speed/usability of the camera. The lag going from camera to gallery disappears when you do this.  But if camera quality is your main concern with a phone, you probably would be better off with an iPhone. I know this is Android-lover territory, but the iPhone's camera is top notch."

I posted about it to this sub months ago, but my experience seems to be slightly unique.  I used google navigation for 28 minutes earlier today and it worked  as perfectly as it has been.

Fingerprint for EAS Authentication - adds fingerprint as a device security lock option while an Exchange Active Sync (EAS) account is active on the device. Add Milk Music as preload on home screen. Galaxy Apps Auto Install - triggers Galaxy Apps to install when user signs into Samsung Account for the first time.   That's not a lot of changes for such a massive download.

That is important because from my experience, it is quite hard to write on the Note 4 as the screen is too tiny. I almost never use the S-Pen with it."

galaxynote4,3dhri0,MnokeR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:59:01 2015 UTC,"Nova launcher comes packed with features that allow you to make changes to the home screen as well as the drawer. It is more polished and refined then the stock TW launcher which allows for a smoother experience, IMO.  Rooting your device gives you the option to run apps that require root permissions (lower level system access) and also the option to run custom ROMS.  Your last question is kind of vague so it is hard to answer, given we all use our phones differently. I use mine for banking, stocks, videos, gaming (COC), shopping etc etc.."
galaxynote4,3dhgc0,watermedic,3,Thu Jul 16 08:31:30 2015 UTC,With Nova launcher you can set icons for individual apps by long-pressing the app shortcuts to bring up the edit menu and tapping the icon. Works on both the home screen and app drawer.

More and more I'm becoming disillusioned. I've posted a couple times about the issues I'm having with it, but lately it's been even worse. It would magically turn on while in my pocket and either run random apps or call people. Better yet, now for whatever reason S voice turns it on on a whim. I'd be talking to my boss, and all of a sudden my phone would just come on and start listening. I keep saying this, I wish I'd never ""upgraded"" from the Note 3 and kept the bliss going.

Touchwiz does have some really cool functionalities (to varying degrees of usefulness) and the hate does go overboard at times, but Touchwiz really really truly does lag a ton.  I came from a Motorola Bionic to a Galaxy S4 to a Note 4. I told myself I wouldn't get another Samsung because I was sick of Touchwiz (though I eventually rooted my S4), but my GS4 broke a month before the G4 came out (the phone I was eyeing). I was shocked by how much touchwiz semi-frequently lags during the most of simple of tasks, despite the fact that the phone is overall amazing and pretty snappy a majority of the time."

After they've already made back the money from the subsidy (which occurs before you buy the device) they continue to make money off it.    Then, you don't REALLY own it as you can't root it, change the software how you want, or switch to a different carrier.     AND you get locked into a 2 year agreement, unless you're an idiot and paid full price for a carrier locked device.     STOP DOING THAT PEOPLE!    Many vendors offer financing on the unlocked non carrier devices.  Hell even buy now pay later with paypal.    Or just put it on a credit card and pay it off in 4 months like I do.     If you count not being able to move to other carriers with your device, and what you spend being gripped into 2 year contracts; you spend way more for a subsidized carrier phone than you do if you buy the full priced item.   And you STILL DON'T OWN your device.     If you cannot afford the full price phone, or your credit is jacked up so that you cannot get financing, then you shouldn't be buying a premium phone and instead spend that money on paying your debts.

Also download those free Galaxy Gift apps like ArtRage and Sketchbook.   Remember to redeem your free premium trial of Evernote.   As for transitioning from iOS, the largest issues I faced were to move my contacts data over and my photos over. Now with the new Google photos, it is no longer an issue.   There is a gotcha if you use Whatsapp. iOS Whatsapp is incompatible so make sure you grab everything you need off it before you activate Whatsapp on your Note 4. It all disappears after that. Only your contacts are brought over. Conversations and photos seem to be all gone.   Oh yes also remember to follow the instructions to fully deactivate your iMessage if you don't want your SMSes to go to Apple instead of your Note 4."

Gear VR is pretty fun. I found a headset for the note 4 on ebay for $150 or so.    Business Calendar 2 (let me reiterate the 2) is an incredible Calendar app if such things are important to you. For regular calendaring needs, Google Calendar is also great.     Flud is a good app for downloading torrents if you're into such things. Now that you've left the Gulag for the shores of Android freedom you're going to be able to have external memory and run apps like... well, torrent clients.      Another good app you'd never see in the App Store is Adaway. You also won't find it in the Android Market, but you can install it from f-droid.    Google Goggles is pretty fun. It can identify things from your photos (landmarks, art, brands, etc.) and send you alerts when it recognizes things.      Speaking of photos, Google Photos. Let it backup your photos and you won't regret it.       Tasker is fun if you're into advanced configuration type of stuff. It's like IFTTT but for your phone. You can do thinks like ""turn on the lights when I get home"" or ""silence my alerts when I'm at work"" or whatever. The possibilities are endless.    Google Keep is an excellent note taking application with an excellent widget. Oh yea, widgets!    S Note is reasonably good for taking notes with the S Pen. Papyrus is also pretty good.      You won't find a video editor as good as the one on iOS, but ""Video Editor"" by Samsung is pretty good. You have to install it from their store.    Tinfoil for Facebook is essentially a wrapper for the Facebook mobile site. This has many benefits: 1. You don't need to install their insanely-permissioned battery death squad messenger app, 2. You don't need to be signed in in your browser and feed Facebook all your data, 3. You don't need to install the Facebook App.    Relay Pro is my favorite Reddit app. It supports multiple accounts with fast switching, had a good dark theme, and is very stable.    Pocket Casts is awesome for finding and listening to podcasts.    The Amazon App Store has lots of free deals periodically and you can pick up a lot of good stuff that way.    The multi-window modes on the Note can be pretty handy. You can have two applications open top and bottom, or have applications windowed and minimized into little chat-head style floating notifications.    That's all I can think of right now."

However, I was still in the honeymoon phase and I still liked the phone.   I would recommend getting something else. At this point in time, the Note has nothing going for it besides a big screen that's improperly utilized thanks to a bad DPI selection by Samsung."
galaxynote4,3d91bq,AceTheIceman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:55:31 2015 UTC,I think the note uses its screen size better than the nexus 6 though. A software update can totally fix the note.

galaxynote4,3d9kn1,ExtraGloves,4,Tue Jul 14 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"There's always going to be variation in how people use their phones, the apps they have installed, and the services they run.  However, one thing that is often overlooked, which can dwarf all of these is the quality of the mobile and wifi signal that the phone is connected to. A poor network signal can decimate battery life, it's what causes my phone to get around 2 hours SoT over a normal day.  Then there's the wifi network, larger networks (like those typically found in universities and schools can cause huge wakelocks from various pings and whatnot being sent to the phone. This also has a dramatic effect on battery life."
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,Cassiuz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:22:10 2015 UTC,I'm curious because where I am I have 1 bar of service always at home but I'm always on wifi.  I thought if you were on wifi it wouldn't drain the battery looking for a call signal.  Know anything about that?

galaxynote4,3d9kn1,refrigeratorbob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:05:10 2015 UTC,I know.  I meant that I use mostly data.  I didn't know if a poor signal killed battery if there's no service when I'm on wifi
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,refrigeratorbob,2,Tue Jul 14 21:56:30 2015 UTC,You can turn mobile data off seperately from wifi.
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,Cassiuz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:38:27 2015 UTC,I understand this and you're not following me. With no wifi and bad cell service the phone is constantly looking for service for data draining the battery. With wiki and bad cell service my question was does it drain in the same way.
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,r0cky,3,Tue Jul 14 22:40:31 2015 UTC,"Wiki?   Bad cell service drainage is totally seperate from wifi, so yes, wifi isnt magically adding battery or stopping the drain from poor signal. With wifi its draining even more battery, so turn off cell signal if you are in a bad reception area, as its draining the battery quickly."
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,wontimeicountedtwoat,2,Wed Jul 15 00:12:41 2015 UTC,"If you're on wifi the phone won't be looking for a data signal (i.e. a 3g/4g signal) but it will still need a network connection to a 2g network for calls/texts/etc.  The drain will be less in that case, as 2g networks are typically lower power than the 3g/4g data networks, but a weaker signal will still always use more power than a stronger signal of the same network type."
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,santhonyl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"It can also be connected to a bad 3G/4G network while on wifi. You are right that 2G is better on the battery though. Most network providers have their network setup so it stays in 4G, then 3G and if that's not available it goes to 2G. This can also be the case if there is a bad 4G/3G signal at your place and there might be good 2G signal. This drains the battery faster."
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,baldheadslick,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:43:58 2015 UTC,I have both the Exynos and the Snapdragon versions.    Snapdragon nets me about 45 min extra battery life in a day.  But it's terrible lag. Exynos is very very smooth and snappy.  The snapdragon feels so laggy and slow.     But honestly it could be many things.     some people need to turn off talkback still. reducing the transition and animated settings to .5 or 0 in developer menu installing xposed to removed the stupid screen off memory leak of 5.0.1. Stop buying carrier locked phones if you cannot do step 3.
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,r0cky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:04:37 2015 UTC,"it might be the apps some of us choose to use.

galaxynote4,3d9kn1,wontimeicountedtwoat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:07:53 2015 UTC,"I think the reason is fragmentation. I know there is loose talk about that word but if you think about how many versions of the note 4 there are to include processors and then all of the carriers international and domestic that have to get their dick beaters on the software before you see it then it becomes clear that not everyone has the same phone. I think that's the reason why  There is a lot of ""not sure what everyone is on about, but my phone runs fine"" stuff out there."
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,myke113,0,Tue Jul 14 16:16:13 2015 UTC,I mean I get it when its different carriers or processors but most Verizon Note 4's are the same exact phone I would think.
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,CrazieMexican,0,Tue Jul 14 16:37:55 2015 UTC,They are equally but not the same. There are indeed manufacturing tolerances.
galaxynote4,3d9kn1,myke113,0,Tue Jul 14 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the device is locked so you cannot fix the issues on your own.   Also, when the unlocked community has had 3 or 4 updates to radios and firmware while the carrier locked phone is still stuck on a single old update, you have a TON of difference how the hardware performs.    Fucking idiots buying carrier locked models even if it means they don't REALLY own their phone.     Even once the phone is paid and your contract is done you cannot use it anywhere else or change the software how you want.    STOP BUYING CARRIER LOCKED PHONES.  They are MORE expensive in the long run."
galaxynote4,3da2us,ExtraGloves,3,Tue Jul 14 17:57:36 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, out with the redundancy.   You don't need two clocks, two weather widgets, and two calendar widgets telling you what day it is.   Then, use more than one screen. It's okay to have a big calendar take up an entire screen. Also, organize your icons a bit more. Don't just shove them all in the corner.   Pick up an icon pack because inconsistent icon styles isn't pretty. Then, pick the wallpaper to match. Make sure nothing clashes. For example, don't put a mostly white icon on top of a white background. I personally get rid of icon labels but that's all up to you.    Also, if you have a big phone, change the icon grid size to minimize wasted space. You might have to make the icons smaller as well.   Finally, and this is completely my opinion, get rid of the folders. This can be done by replacing the folder icon with an app icon, or you could just remove them completely. Imo, they're just ugly.   Keep in mind, this is all constructive criticism. I don't mean any harm, I'm just critiquing your current setup."
galaxynote4,3da2us,AceTheIceman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:41:00 2015 UTC,Do you mean the actual folders or the folder looking icons.  I like having all my text apps on one folder on the bottom bar as opposed to looking for each one.  I like criticism its all good thanks.  Should I just browse through icon packs or are there ones that are generally used more?
galaxynote4,3da2us,AceTheIceman,2,Tue Jul 14 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"Just get rid of the folder looking icons. I think they're really ugly, but to each their own.   Also, as far as icon packs go, the dev Vertumus on Google Play does a fantastic job of doing weekly updates of all of his icon packs. As far as I know, most of his paid packs have more than 3,200 icons. I'm personally using Elun.   Icon packs are totally up to you, though. There's no wrong choice.   Just remember to keep your phone functional. I've seen countless homescreen where there's only one screen, two icons on that screen, and no widgets. Sure, its minimal. However, doing that completely destroys all functionality as it takes multiple taps to get to certain information / apps you want. Make your phone both functional and nice looking."

galaxynote4,3da2us,I_WantToBelieve,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:20:09 2015 UTC,I would honestly start with removing everything that is not absolutely necessary just like /u/AceTheIceman recommended. Get rid of the redundancy and focus on efficiency. Try to streamline the looks of your home screen(s) for a more coherent style.  What is on your other 6 home screens and why do you have that many?

It was not a matter of me doing that in real time while I filmed but the software doing it after filming.

The recent apps screen take a very long time to appear so I would sometimes think that my Note 4 had not registered my tap and tap again. The result is that when it eventually decides to appear it will then immediately dismiss itself.   Good thing is it runs Lollipop so the SD card is more useful than in Kit Kat.

I got 79Mb/s down over LTE in Singapore, which is the most I've ever seen out of a cellular connection.  Once you flash, if you stay unrooted you'll get OTA on this, but when you root the updater will say that Android has been modified and will no longer OTA, so take that in to account.

galaxynote4,3d1gmr,neva5eez,3,Sun Jul 12 19:52:25 2015 UTC,That's what I get with lollipop!  With my double life battery :-(
galaxynote4,3d1gmr,rsplatpc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:35:23 2015 UTC,Just curious what kind of battery do you have?
galaxynote4,3d1gmr,r0cky,2,Mon Jul 13 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"Just curious what kind of battery do you have?   Anker 6440mAh, and I was kinda just kidding, it gets like 3-4 days standby if I have my Moto 360 disconnected, about 3 days with it connected (I think it would be like 5 days with KitKat though), the back that comes with it is slippery but I put grip tape on it so now it's super grippy, and honestly I really like the feel of it, I almost drop my phone now when I put the regular back / battery on.   I would highly recommend it because it does not add any width to the phone, just depth, which is why I picked it over a extended life ""case""  I googled twice and can't find it on Ankers site so here is a Amazon link  http://www.amazon.com/Capable-Extended-T-Mobile-18-Month-Warranty/dp/B00S153ICS"
galaxynote4,3d1gmr,rsplatpc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:11:26 2015 UTC,How's the weight and size difference with the battery? How is the case quality? I had some mixed experiences with Anker. Had a 4400mah one on the S3 and it got bigger over time until I exchanged it for a new one and it happened again after a few month.
galaxynote4,3d1gmr,r0cky,2,Mon Jul 13 17:41:34 2015 UTC,"How's the weight and size difference with the battery?    Honestly I find the phone easier to hold with the extended battery, it adds zero width, just depth, so it kinda feels more like a ""phone"" with the extended back on than a ""candy bar"" with the standard back (when I hold the phone with the standard back, the back of the phone barely touches my palm since it's flat, with the extended it totally fits in the palm), and it's about 1/4 of the total weight of the phone heavier   the back is just a back, it's not a case, it snaps on just like the normal back and mine fits perfectly just like snapping on a Samsung back   it's much slicker/slippery than the standard Samsung black color back, might even be more than the slippery white back, I bought some clear tape that is designed to put on steps when it's cold out to add more grip and put it on the back, now it's SUPER SUPER grippy, like 20x more grippy than the standard black back"

galaxynote4,3d1gmr,Fucanelli,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"Also, Facebook by default saves location history, this is a big battery drain, Google also has location history reporting which should also be turned off.  I use a program called Cooler Master, and this helps to identify and disable background running apps while allowing you the option to whitelist apps.  Turn off wifi calling if not connected to wifi, this keeps the wifi radio on and drains the battery.  For advanced users, underclocking the cpu can net huge battery benefits, I'm currently going 30 hours off the charger. It's a bit excessive even, I end up swapping batteries when I hit 30%."

Back to 3-5 hours SOT depending on what I'm doing (gaming, movie or just browsing). I tend to average around 4 hours SOT doing casual stuff. Overnight drain hasn't been that bad, seeing anywhere from 2-4% overnight. Getting about 1-1.5 day usage on average and this weekend since I lazed around, as of this post, haven't charged my phone since Friday.  Google Now is on with high accuracy location and active cards Sync is on   This is very close or similar to what I used to get on Kitkat and this is on a 8 month old battery."

Lollipop looks better, kitkat is more functional (IMO). Once on kitkat, download the small 150mb or so patch, then you will be on the most updated version of kitkat.

galaxynote4,3cxu73,Caelrie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:21:16 2015 UTC,It sounds like you have both a bad battery and you have a combination of bad cell reception plus apps that are keeping your phone awake.  You do need a new battery. They only cost about $15.  The cell reception is hard to do anything about.  You can track down the apps that are keeping your phone awake though.  Fixing the 2 out of those 3 that you can fix WILL make a difference.
galaxynote4,3cxu73,I_WantToBelieve,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:45:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Judging by your screenshot, your cell signal is crap, and you have insane amounts of wake locks that drain your battery. Also, bluetooth and wifi are on at all times, I bet. That will empty your battery in no time.  Follow the battery improvement guide in the side bar of this sub. If that doesn't help, go to T-Mobile. The phone isn't even a year old, you're covered by warranty."

This might have been true back in 2010 when Android 2.1 was still new and wifi/bt chips in phones were still power hungry, but not anymore.  Think about it. What's going to consume the most power? Communicating with fast internet in your house, a signal that's within a hundred meters, or trying to reach a cell tower a kilometer away, with added latency and reduced bandwidth?"
galaxynote4,3cxu73,I_WantToBelieve,2,Sat Jul 11 19:55:28 2015 UTC,"Inb4 the wakelocks are caused by either the WiFi or Bluetooth trying to connect to a network/device that is not in range.^  I hear what you are saying, but literally everything that is turned on while not actively in use will contribute to the overall discharge, no matter how marginal it seems of the surface. These things can technically also keep up system processes that lead to those wake locks."

And the rumor mill seems to indicate that all the note 5 will bring to the table is a curved screen on that edge and a slightly better display.

I was concerned about that myself when I was shopping for a smart phone. I found a friend who had one and would let me borrow it for a couple of hours. I tried it in in the front pocket of all my pants.   The one-hand mode works well for me. (That's the gesture that makes the visible screen a little smaller. Might be the wrong word.)

Removable battery is nice, but I don't really use it. Also a tip, don't use quick charge unless you have to be somewhere and you battery is really low. Using quickcharge kills your phone battery life to the point where my note 4 always dies at 12%. So I have to get a new battery now, which isn't so bad cause I can just remove this one. Honestly, if the note 5 doesn't have an SD card slot AND a removable battery, get the next nexus or any other phone with a big screen/battery. Touchwiz is really an experience killer imo and it looks ugly and lags like hell after a month with the phone."

Had only Samsung phones over the last 6 years or so but no sd card is a dealbreaker and I don't understand why bloggers and such are defending this. They always say: ""Apps don't run so fast on the SD Card"".   Guess what, SD Cards aren't for apps, they are for my 80 Gb's of music, podcasts and audio books and for that you don't need high speed internal memory. Really makes me angry when ever I see this.  Once my Note Edge dies (which will hopefully don't happen soon), I will probably have to buy a LG since they are the last manufacturer with a SD Card AND a removable battery and I don't see them getting rid of it soon since it's a huge plus considering they have basically no competition anymore in that area."

galaxynote4,3cuy8j,ParadoxicGer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:59:21 2015 UTC,"Yep.  I work in a dungeon (no LTE), and the filter blocks a lot of streaming to save the company bandwidth (when on WiFi).

If Samsung sees a lot less sales because of this choice, they might go back on it the next time around.  Still blows my mind what they expect us to think a GB of LTE costs.  Assholes.

I feel like they are doing something fucky with the way the system cache operates, as the introduction of trim support in Android eliminated the performance degradation over time from every other variant of Android I have seen. It is quite honestly totally inexcusable at this point -- they have more resources at their disposal than any other OEM, yet they aren't making it a priority, as they need the extra budget to hire more engineers to figure out how to make the phone thinner (sad face)."

I can't get used to TouchWiz, it just, I don't like it, it's like a mix of Android with the bloatness of and iPhone.

(Of the same model.) Over the years, I really hope and I do believe that this issue will continue to be minimized until it is no longer a concern at the time of purchase. For now, I know for a fact that I will upgrade my phone before the burn-in becomes a hindrance to my usage of the device, and for now, that's okay with me.

When they decide to start looking, they spend a little time and then choose the best phone (based on their needs) over a weekend. These include mostly people in their 40s+.  If a company can launch when no one else is, then the commercials/reviews will be all about them. This means that the customer segment I mentioned above will be bombarded by the news about the newest and best phone. Maybe they won't buy this phone, because they don't care about the flashiest things, but even if they buy a Note 4 or S5, Samsung wins."

None of the features they've added in the past 3 or 4 years have been interesting to me at all. My phone is plenty fast enough, the camera is better than anything I need(have my DLSR for high end stuff), I don't play games on my phone anymore so I don't need the newest CPU/GPU combo.   I'm at a point that I've been upgrading just because I can. Now that i'm with Tmobile and my phone bill will drop by $40 at 2 years, I think I'm just going to stick with my Note4 until it breaks.

You have a rogue app that keeps your phone awake when it should ideally only be awake when your display is turned on.   Also: Why do you have WiFi turned on the entire time? Were you home all day? Did you commute? It will keep on searching for WiFi networks which drains the battery. You need to be more proactive with your phone use to make the best of your battery's juice. Turn WiFi off when you are commuting.  I also see that your cell signal dropped completely on two or three occasions. If you didn't turn on Airplane mode then, the phone will try its best to find a cell signal. Means: it will boost the antenna which in consequence will eat more battery juice until it finds a stable signal.  Apart from that, losing 50% in roughly 12 hours is pretty average. There's been way worse in this sub. :D"

So yeah, it's pretty great. The samsung warranty is only 1 year anyways. And I have squaretrade which covers rooted  phones :P  EDIT: I also forgot, it allows you to install custom Kernels (androids' backend) to optimize battery life or performance, it's up to the user and what kernel they choose. GoogyMax is great for my n910c :)  EDIT: Here is a video about root in general https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VpxEE35Dqo (starts at 1:50)  Also certain touchwiz roms can let any app be multiscreen.

You can use firgerprint but in some ROMs I'm unable to use it for PayPal. Repairing Knox is hard (i didn't search for it) and if you unlock bootloader I think there is no simple return to warranty state.   If you flash TwouchWiz ROM you can use GalaxyApps and gifts.

What worked for me was going to Settings -> Applications -> Application Manager. Now disable any app you don't use. This is most of the ATT bloatware. For other apps, uncheck notifications unless you truly want them. This tremendously improved my battery life.   If you want to take it a step further, download Battery Doctor. The new version has an optimizer that automatically goes through your running processes and closes all non essentials that stay open in the background after using apps. I do this usually once a day, maybe twice if I'm heavily using the phone.   These two things took me from dropping to 40% by lunch with minimal use to sitting on 80% with moderate use.

galaxynote4,3cotrs,frebib,2,Thu Jul 9 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"Besides boot loops, stability is the only real risk. When you're using Xposed and any modules, you run the risk that they may not be compatible with your system. A deodexed rom (as opposed to an odexed rom, like stock TouchWiz) allows for developers to alter the entire system and functionality more easily.   Think of it like a game of jenga. With a deodexed rom, you can take a piece of the jenga tower and place it where ever you like and it's super easy to do so. In a odexed rom, your jenga tower is actually made out of lego bricks and they're all stuck together. It's harder to move pieces around but everything is right where it should be. There's also a bit of a speed difference between deodexed and odexed but because of the nature of TouchWiz, I haven't noticed it versus the difference between a deodexed and odexed version of stock Android.  You would need a rom that was already deodexed. I've never heard of anyone taking a stock firmware and changing its state. It's something that is on a system level, baked into the rom already."

galaxynote4,3cqjks,NSRpxndxhou,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:02:12 2015 UTC,I and a lot of people will agree with this comment. Maybe the Note 5 will surprise us all and have the removable back.

galaxynote4,3cqjks,jradizrad,0,Sat Jul 11 14:08:59 2015 UTC,"After following android phones for a while, I find it hard to believe that a company would revert on such a substantial change. Many places that sell the S6 have offered nice deals for more storage; therefore I could only assume Samsung is pushing this change as a permanent one. However, it is extremely important to really consider how much you would take advantage of the extra battery and expandable storage. I for one thought I would be using both all the time, however currently don't find it necessary for either!"
galaxynote4,3cqjks,GrumpyPenguin,3,Fri Jul 10 00:41:34 2015 UTC,I was going to buy a 64GB micro SD Card right off the bat for $20. It's class 10 and it's perfect.   I really don't know why where are 100 different phone manufacturers when they are all copying the iPhone. It just doesn't make sense.
galaxynote4,3cqjks,JBv2Reddit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:18:28 2015 UTC,"Well, the iPhone is popular, it's selling well, and all the other manufacturers want a piece of that market share.   Sad state of affairs, really."

My bud just threw on all the seasons of game of thrones as well for my train rides. Battery and removable storage are critical to me."
galaxynote4,3cqjks,chinesse_pigdog,-1,Sun Jul 12 06:05:23 2015 UTC,Note 6 can will go back if sales go very bad for Note 5 and I wish for that. That's very sad what they want to do with Note series...
galaxynote4,3cqbvt,BurlyBrownBear,3,Thu Jul 9 22:41:15 2015 UTC,"For a while I felt a little bit like you. Then I installed a new launcher (I now use Nova Launcher in place of the stock Touchwiz) and it made everything a lot more customizable. There is a free and a paid version. I used my Google Rewards (Its an app where you get paid to take short surveys - like 1-5 questions - and get Google Play credit to use on anything in the play store) to get the paid version and I'm pretty much in love with it. Also try a different texting program. I hated the stock program but have been using Textra (again, bought the paid version with my Google Rewards) and much prefer it.   Just play around with things. Pretty much everything can be customized. Also, if you didn't already know that you can also download additional modes for your camera so you can customize the picture you are taking. I found them in the Samsung app store, all for free."

galaxynote4,3cmrlr,dahui9,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:21:00 2015 UTC,All 4 people in my family love their Note 4.  I will be switching away from Samsung if they don't have memory cards for the Note 6 since this is probably where they will be when I can get an upgrade.  It is very disheartening to see them do away with SD cards.  Big fail.
galaxynote4,3cmrlr,Th3AntiNoob,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"Unless you gotta nave microsd and removable battery, you might want to wait for the Note 5. (it isn't even confirmed whether the note 5 loses those features for sure).  Battery life is so good, only the heaviest duty users or someone who is always needs juice for work will have issues. (battery banks and quick charge greatly reduces ghat aspect).   Storage is always a concern, but if they remove microsd from the Note 5 they'll probably bump standard storage to 64 or even 128Gb.  Yeah it might be less than ideal for some people, but the S6 doesn't have those things either and it's very popular.   Personally... I've had a Note 2, now a Note 4 and I only remove the battery if I get a 1 in 100,000 freeze I can't correct. On the road a battery bank keeps me topped off and I rarely need extra storage space for movies."
galaxynote4,3cmrlr,cuteman,-1,Fri Jul 10 02:29:57 2015 UTC,"You have a s5 with all the features a note 4 has. Why do you want to upgrade? Is it still worth it depends on the price you get it for.   The phone is good but the newest update has led to a few problems for me personally, namely random app crashes in the background even after wiping and clearing cache. Other then that the camera is great in the light, games run like bolt and I fucking love the screens size."

galaxynote4,3co0ze,FizzyGizmo,2,Thu Jul 9 11:55:38 2015 UTC,These are build numbers (bigger letter and number - newer)  No need to match if everything works well (I have BOE3 ROM+BOE3 Modem+BOC3 Bootloader)  You can change ROM and modem with custom recovery but bootloader requires Odin.

galaxynote4,3cnd6o,Left4Head,2,Thu Jul 9 06:30:12 2015 UTC,Nope. I love Lollipop and the Alliance ROM.
galaxynote4,3cnd6o,PDXMatthew,2,Thu Jul 9 09:49:31 2015 UTC,"When I first got my phone it came with Lollipop, I ended up going back to Kit Kat because of the battery issues. With Kit Kat, battery life was great, liked it, had no issues. Then after about 3 days with Kit Kat, I wanted to see if Lollipop would still give me battery problems, upgraded to Lollipop overnight and I noticed that the battery was overheating when I wasn't using it, battery was down 20% in 1 hour, and ended up driving me crazy and fearing for my brand new phone. No reboot was enough to stop it. Went home that day, went back to Kit Kat. Everything was fine again.  About a week later, I opted to try Lollipop again, and for some reason once I upgraded, I didn't experience any problems that was plaguing the other two try outs of Lollipop.   I've been on Lollipop since then, and haven't experienced any battery issues, and it's been quite good since."
galaxynote4,3cnd6o,TimeWasterNinja,0,Thu Jul 9 15:57:39 2015 UTC,I have. Switched to PopRocks v6 after playing with some early versions of lollipop. I was waiting for PopRocks to get a few versions and start including some mods. I was there maybe 3 weeks. Odin'd back to FireKat a week ago or so. It's just not reliable for me. Battery life isn't close to what I'm getting on KK and just a bunch of other little things I don't quite remember.   I'm going to stick with FireKat for a while longer. I've been on this ROM for probably 85% of my time with this phone. Love it.
galaxynote4,3cnd6o,Joebroni555,0,Thu Jul 9 07:36:28 2015 UTC,"For the same reasons, never left KitKat."
galaxynote4,3cnd6o,govapin,0,Thu Jul 9 07:38:50 2015 UTC,Poprocks provided me with absolutely no performance or battery improvements. It actually gave me insane overheating.

On my Note 4, I've noticed that it tends to lag less when you've actively been using the phone (i.e. the CPU is at a high clock rate) than when the phone has been relatively idle for a while (i.e. the CPU has been throttled down)."
galaxynote4,3cju7x,nathan_NG,9,Wed Jul 8 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"This. If you hit the multitasking button after you recently used it, there's just a little lag. The lag appears the most when you havent used it for a while..."

You see guys here bragging about 7H SOT on stock battery, but that's with a huge amount of stuff disabled, low brightness, and most importantly over the course of much less than a day, which is 1) really weird to me, who would use a phone 7 hours in a single day regularly 2) not telling the whole story because standby drain (or lack thereof) is important.  I'm not the kind of guy who wants to constantly keep an eye on his battery and his apps and his CPU usage and memory and GPS status and etc. etc. etc. to optimize the battery. I want to forget about it and not worry about it and know that my phone is going to be reliable over several days.

galaxynote4,3ce6yn,MiniMoose12,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:36:34 2015 UTC,I really like the design of that case but it hurt my phones reception. If I was in a area with strong reception it wasn't an issue. But at work I barely have any bars and with the neo hybrid metal I either had no signal or I had one bar and I would be better off using AOL dialup. Also I wouldn't use this case if you swap out batteries the thing is annoying as hell to take off.
galaxynote4,3ce6yn,Cjo1992,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:03:15 2015 UTC,"I doesn't hurt my reception..... I've tested it in a few places and its the same on or off. Also yeah its a bitch to swap. I swap 3 batteries and the first week was pretty tuff. But I got used to it. I got better at taking it off lol. Now it's cake. The only bad thing that happened to me is a small drop that basically ruined the feel of the power button. The case's power button is mushy now, but without the case the phones button is unharmed and clicky lol. I think I might cut out a piece of foam and try making it clicky again later. Other than that, neo hyrbridnmetal is great. I had the plastic one and I didn't like it at all. Too bendy and the case shifted allot"

The Thin Fit is the thinnest of all but also the slipperiest and the top and bottom isn't protected. The phone slipped out of my gym shorts in my garage when I squatted down. The phone came out unscathed but there is a minor scuff on the case.  The Tough Armor is the thickest and probably strongest. I like the kickstand. It's a little flimsy but it works on hard surfaces. I use this one when I'm mainly going to be outside.   The Slim Armor is like the Tough Armor but thinner. Kickstand is flimsy but works. This one is an everyday case with better protection than the Thin Fit and Diztronic.  The Diztronic TPU case is slim and grippy. Offers more protection than the Thin Fit and is grippier.

galaxynote4,3ce6yn,noremac258,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:23:12 2015 UTC,"Copypasta-ing my old post with cases lol  I had three different cases with my note.  First is the Caseology black carbon fibre case This was a really nice case, the lip gives enough space so the screen doesn't touch any surfaces, the back felt really nice and smooth, black and gold combo. My only complaint is the gold sides felt kinda plasticy not really premium but it does look premium for sure and it's pretty cheap in price too.  Second is the Zerolemon 10,000 mah battery case I really liked this case because it gave me from 3-4 days of of usage with the nuisance of charging it or carry an external battery. My grip with it is that it weighs a ton and can barely fit into my jeans. Using it as a backup though or those days when you need a long charge.  Last is the Samsung S view case I wanted to switch to a flip style case because of how nice the metal sidings of the note 4 was, I wanted to show it off more rather than hid it under a case. Looks great, S view screen looks nice, and I don't' have to completely cover my phone.  Recently though I've been going caseless on my phone. The metal sidings and the phone overall just looks so sleek and nice and I have forgotten how light the phone is without cases too.

Like, if you use a third party picture album app, you won't be able to delete pictures taken with the camera app, because the third party app doesn't own the pictures folder.  The Samsung file viewer can get around most of this without rooting if you don't mind using it for file management.  As for rooting, it depends which version you have.  T-mobile is a snap to root.  Sprint is a cinch too. AT&T and Verizon usually can't be rooted at all.  I'm not sure about the international model."
galaxynote4,3ccsty,JBv2Reddit,0,Tue Jul 7 05:33:40 2015 UTC,Is it pretty easy to manage files?   That depends on you. Android will make some mess - you can't win  this fight.

It is by far the worst possible material you could use for the back of a phone, and it blows my mind that people like it so much. Not only does it give me another piece of glass to worry about, it makes both pieces more likely to break by adding weight to the phone (more mass = more force on impact), and drastically reducing the amount of force that can be absorbed by the non-screen parts of the device. On top of all of this, they have decided to sacrifice removable batteries and SD cards on the altar of having a cool looking device.  In short, the glass back is the epitome of form over function. Aluminum is not quite as bad, but plastic really is just far more functional and is just better by pretty much every possible metric except for heat dissipation, which has really proven to basically be a non-issue."

You still have major lag in multitasking, you get the weird Samsung only bugs/glitches (talk to any Android dev if you doubt that these are real), you still have the TW status bar/notification area, as well as the dialer and system settings. I am currently running a TW based ROM, as it has definitely gotten more palatable and has enough good things to make the bad worth it, but telling people to use a different launcher is kind of like advising someone that hates their car to put a different cover on the steering wheel."
galaxynote4,3cax2q,BigPoopBreakfast,0,Mon Jul 6 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"So, why get a Note when you hate TW so much? I really don't see the point of people complaining about TW then they go out and buy a Samsung phone.  If you despise TW so much, just go buy a Nexus 6. Problem solved."

Seriously, though, there is a lot to love about the Note that is not present on the Nexus 6. I used the S-Pen all the time, the display is the prettiest I have ever seen, the camera is phenomenal, and TW does add a whole heap of useful functionality to the device, particularly in the area of one handed operation.   It has its downsides -- the design language is childish and ugly (although it is VERY much improved in Lollipop, and Samsung seems to be really working to make it more customizable), it is full of bloat (which, again, Samsung seems to be addressing), and the lag is omnipresent and undeniable.  In short, I love this phone, but I see many ways in which it could be improved."

I made a decision based on more than just reviews, it is a top of the line phone that should run circles around anything out there, but it isn't and there's only one company to blame for it.

galaxynote4,3cax2q,AndroidOS_Support,9,Mon Jul 6 18:28:31 2015 UTC,I've used AOSP ROMs on my Note and if anyone thinks it's world's better they're pretty far off. Yeah TouchWiz has mildly worse lag but it's nothing to bitch and moan about the way some people do. I'll take an awesome camera experience over a snappy recents menu any day.  Most issues I've seen around here are PEBCAK anyway. Learn how to use what you have and there will be less problems.
galaxynote4,3cax2q,PDXMatthew,2,Mon Jul 6 20:07:07 2015 UTC,"Different strokes I guess...  I'm running AOSP and I'll take a slightly worse camera over phone lag.  But I upvoted you because I think it's good for people to see that different ROMs let you mostly get what you want out of the device.    I think it's crazy how people will say the note 4 sucks because TW cripples the hardware, and suggest other phones, when you could just use other ROMs.  Right now my Note 4 blazes on CMRemix, and I still can use the s-pen as an active stylus and swap batteries when needed - neither of which can be done with a Nexus device.  (Also, as an aside on the camera:  To tell you the truth, I actually think the camera isn't that much worse - it just suffers in low light with colour noise.  Also, I always thought most of TW's camera software seemed to over-sharpen.)"
galaxynote4,3cax2q,LiveLaughLoveRevenge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:38:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely different strokes and to be fair, I'm not running stock TouchWiz. I'm using the Alliance ROM which is very snappy. In fact, if benchmarks mean anything to anyone, it scores higher than any stock ROM on the market.

Also why these picks of a supposed Note 5 w/o expandable storage or removable battery make it less appealing to me - they just removed two advantages of the Note over a Nexus."

I had the Nexus 5, for sure pure OS was much better, but boy. I felt like I was beta testing it.   Then the Note 4 got the Lolipop update and since then, more memory leaks and no upcoming fix.   I had an iPhone 4 and... I kinda miss the whole Apple ecosystem. For sure, your wallet is getting robbed with ridiculous price and storage option, but having I feel iOS is far superior. It's streamlined, most of the devices will run the same version without being altered.  I love android but I hate to chose hardware Vs. Software.

I would be fine with the branded shit if Touchwiz was in any way decent. It's not though. The biggest pile of crap and it's 100% Samsung. Not to mention the fact that there are a ton of apps on there from Samsung you can't remove as well. Do you even have this phone? If you did you'd see how much Samsung crap is on there and not make stupid comments like this.
galaxynote4,3cax2q,cup-o-farts,3,Mon Jul 6 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"i was prepared for a shitpost like this so here are two screenshots taken from my Note 4 to make your bloatware argument irrelevant:   http://i.imgur.com/9QUzUZs.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/OX233QR.jpg  now i realize that turning the app off doesn't completely detach it from the system framework, but it does the job as far as being unobtrusive is concerned. space is also a non-issue, because if you can afford a flagship model notorious for being the most expensive device on the market when it debuts, you can afford a 20 dollar microsd card.  mobile carriers play a small part in preinstalled applications on android phones. for instance, my KT note 4 comes with olleh applications for managing my account and Korean applications for call ID, public transit NFC and GPS. where as your AT&T note 4 might have different American equivalents. of course these big telecom companies are going to bundle their apps with the phones they subsidize, because the people who don't know any better (which make up a majority of the smart phone userbase) will blindly use them and make the telecom companies more money.  as far as system updates go, it is all on the carrier. the cycle is AOSP > manufacturer> carrier unless it is a nexus device. if you bought your phone from a carrier, you are at their mercy for updates (hi verizon). saying it has little to do with the carrier is very naive.   as for touchwiz, well... it's touchwiz. manufacturers push these android variants on us to differentiate themselves from the competition, and since most people who use smartphones aren't as tech savvy, it has the chance of appealing more to them. yes, in a perfect world all phone would have AOSP framework and zero bloat, but i bought this phone for its camera and its huge removable battery. sometimes you gotta just suck it up if you want premium hardware."

Now show me all the Samsung apps that you absolutely CANNOT turn off. The option is grayed out. P.s. I have a ton of apps turned off and it still runs like crap.  Then you talk about a MicroSD card which the Note 5 will most likely not give you the option to use, just like the Galxy S6 line. I own a SD card, I own a spare battery, I have all the things I need to run this phone. This thread is discussing the upcoming Note 5 and how much it will suck, get with the program here.  I'm not even sure what you are arguing in your third paragraph, You just laughed that he blamed Samsung not AT&T, then proceed to go into this long paragraph about how Mobile Carriers play a small part in pre-installed applications.. That is exactly what I said. The blame lies on Samsung not AT&T or T-mobile (which is what I have if you even bothered to read my post). It does have little to do with the carriers because the only thing t-mobile does to a Samsung upgrade is check to make sure it works on their network and check to make sure their apps work fine with it. The majority of the update comes from Samsung, and their touchwiz crap. I dare you to try and remove touchwiz from this device. You'll have an unusable phone or have to give up everything that you bought a Note 4 for.  As for touchwiz, well there's always nexus, and that's where I'll be. Shitpost indeed."

I already have the notifications themed to stock using xposed and have Google apps that replace my system apps. Nova launcher basically makes the thing stock android. The only thing that still looks like touch wiz is the setting menu. Great that he got the themes working with he s6 shop, let's hope Samsung puts the themes in the next update later this month."
galaxynote4,3c7gtg,Agentsmith2011,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"Screenshots are of me running the Material Dark theme from the Samsung Theme Store. Dr. Ketan has released L7 of his ROM for the N910G, which is a blend of the Note 4 and the S6. Incredibly fast, buttery smooth and full of great features from the S6 and S6 Edge ported over to the Note 4.  This might finally be the ROM that can end my regular urge to go back to CM12 for the Vanilla Android look and feel, and in the process losing battery life and camera performance.    This is what I've waited for for a long time. Having Samsung's brilliant Camera and battery life, while simultaneously having Google's vanilla Android look and buttery smoothness."
galaxynote4,3cak9k,bengaldude545,2,Mon Jul 6 11:57:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I love my Note 4, but the software performs mediocre at best. If you can handle/don't care about the chronic Samsung lags, then it's absolutely a fantastic device. The hardware and visual design are amazing. The phone comes with a bunch of crap apps pre-installed that you can't remove, but through Galaxy Apps, you get a few pretty cool apps for free that otherwise would be paid apps in the Google Play Store. Sketchbook and Fleksy are some of those examples.  If you can't stand the mediocre software, I'd rather go for a Nexus 6 because the software is really really fast and snappy and doesn't have the stupid memory leak anymore since the latest update to Android 5.1.1. Another bonus is fast and frequent updates.  The G4, I would consider pretty much equal, except for an even better camera than the Note 4's. The ever so slightly curved display feels really natural when holding and using the phone.  They are all top notch phones though. Can't go wrong with any of them."
galaxynote4,3cak9k,I_WantToBelieve,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:51:15 2015 UTC,Thank you for a nice detailed and lengthy response. I actually love touch wiz. I know it comes with all that crap. But I will probably root it (I know you can't root on AT&T's model for some reason that's why I'm going to get the T-Mobile variant.) and remove all that bloat.
galaxynote4,3cak9k,abranana,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"If you want removable battery and expandable storage on a powerful 1440p phone, then yes.

galaxynote4,3cak9k,zenwisp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not rooted yet either, although I am considering flashing cm12 soon. When texting it can take 10 seconds for the screen to unfreeze and catch up. Graphics can jitter. It's all just small things that reduce the overall experience."

galaxynote4,3c790t,Intermeadiate,-4,Sun Jul 5 23:53:24 2015 UTC,No one is being respectful. That first guy is a sarcastic douchebag and the second one is an asshole. This subreddit is a shithole.

They just send you back a refurbished phone. In my experience, the phone was good as new on the outside not a single scratch or ding. Almost as if they just replaced the outer casing before sending it out."
galaxynote4,3c790t,SuitedPair,0,Mon Jul 6 00:06:22 2015 UTC,I don't think it's actually Samsung that does the repairs. They're contracted to 3rd parties.  I'd say the chances of something like that happening are around the same as most manufacturers though I'd say it's still low.

galaxynote4,3c2867,baldheadslick,-3,Sat Jul 4 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"Same here.   Then again, pretty much every phone now has a non removable battery.....  Personally, I don't really use my SD card (32GB is good enough) and the battery life is already good enough that I don't need to swap.   A fixed back however does mean no removable flip cases like my current LED Flip wallet.   TLDR: I'll be pissedd off but I'll probably still end up upgrading from Note 4 to Note 5 even if the back is non removable..."
galaxynote4,3c2867,THS89,11,Sat Jul 4 03:01:14 2015 UTC,LG G4 has removable and SD card slot :P
galaxynote4,3c2867,MiniMoose12,-19,Sat Jul 4 05:13:11 2015 UTC,I couldn't use a phone without SD unless it had at least 128GB internally. You're not really needing a smartphone if 32GB is enough.
galaxynote4,3c2867,Garathon,9,Sat Jul 4 09:04:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't want a smartphone without an SD, even if it had an exabyte of internal storage, as long as the internal storage is locked behind that abortion of a protocol known as MTP.   Want to change up your music library? Pop that sucker out, put it in your computer, and transfer music without the headaches of silent failed transfers. New phone? Pop the card out, pop it in the new phone, and bam, all of my music and backed up apps are on the new phone. Dropped your phone and it won't power on anymore? The SD is almost certainly still fine, and all of the above still applies.  Without this, to get anything off of the old phone, the device must be functional, and then you have to deal with MTP's nonsense. I personally don't care about the removable battery, but the lack of removable storage is an immediate and unconditional no-go for me."
galaxynote4,3c2867,BigPoopBreakfast,2,Sat Jul 4 15:23:04 2015 UTC,"Valid points, but cloud backup may help you"
galaxynote4,3c2867,mrpickem1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:17:49 2015 UTC,"Correct.   Still, there's a certain peace of mind that comes with offline removable storage even over cloud storage."
galaxynote4,3c2867,TH3_L3G3ND_718,9,Mon Jul 6 14:04:58 2015 UTC,That's a ridiculous statement. There are plenty of needs for a smart phone that don't involve massive amounts of storage.
galaxynote4,3c2867,TurboClag,0,Sat Jul 4 09:27:37 2015 UTC,That makes no sense and is wrong.  My music and files and pictures are all on the cloud (Google or dropbox)  I use the LTE connectivity and browser for work and use the GPS all the time. Also the pen is good for taking note. Also a bunch of other features like an amazing camera.....  How do any of these features require a 128 GB SD card??? How am I not needin all these features if 32GB is more than enough LOCAL storage ????  Guess we know why your are being down voted.
galaxynote4,3c2867,THS89,-3,Sun Jul 5 02:16:20 2015 UTC,Same. I may go back to apple. Wtf.
galaxynote4,3c2867,Triggermike86,14,Sat Jul 4 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"This is a deal breaker for me.  The removable battery is critical, I've swapped 3 times today, and I'm never tethered. I just recently went all out and purchased a 200gb SD card, loaded about 90gb of music and 60gb of photos - basically my entire collection of each on my damn cell phone!  Which is useful because I tend to go for hikes and sit in terms back yard while Bluetoothing my tunes.   On the other hand, the note 4 may be the last great smartphone, and quite honestly,  I despise the consumerism of having to get a new one every single year. This phone is still and will still remain an insane beast for years to come. Great design, great battery  (ahem, on Kk), storage limited only to what is available, insane display and processor, a very functional s-pen which acts like a computer mouse, windowed apps, it looks GREAT, etc, etc, etc, etc...."

I can deal with the battery, and probably the storage if it is 64gb standard. I only say 64gb because the note generally comes with more than the s series in terms of internal storage.

So we're talking internal SSD marked up into the stratosphere comparable to external (hundreds for the kind of space I usually pay like $30 for on amazon,) and a non-removeable battery that will have to be bigger. Not for extended battery life, though they could really attain that with their 14nm SoC - but to probably barely achieve something comparable with a UHD screen I won't be able to make the pixels out on any better than my QHD screen. And higher design cost.   Meanwhile, my Note 4 has expandable storage, exchangeable battery, quick charging of said battery, and at the bare minimum, 5 hours SOT. Far more in the right circumstances, something like 10 as an eReader or an app like Reddit is Fun with an AMOLED black background. And is half payed off through T Mobile, though I could jump at any moment.   Unless I were incredibly excited for the next gen of Gear VR - why would I buy this?"

By setting backgrounds to black, you are basically turning those pixels ""off"". Less pixels on = less battery usage.

galaxynote4,3by2sv,chrissssssssssssssss,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:12:29 2015 UTC,Tweaks like this will only help if you're already getting decent battery life.  If the screen is your main drain (meaning you've already getting many hours of screen on time) then reducing that by using black themes will make a nice difference. But for those of us who are getting huge battery drain without much screen on time (e.g. I get roughly 2 hours SoT on a typical day) then this will make very little difference as it's not the screen that's causing the issues in the first place.
galaxynote4,3by2sv,Cassiuz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"My phone, with typical usage, gets a little over 5 hours of SoT.

I use my phone very consistently each day: I do basically the same thing every day on it, and I've done quite a lot of testing to see whether pure black app themes and wallpapers make a difference for me: The answer is no. I can't see any noticeable difference in battery life.   I know it makes sense that an AMOLED screen should draw less power when displaying a lot of pure black, but for me it has no effect."
galaxynote4,3by2sv,chrissssssssssssssss,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"Methinks OP's observations were probably coincidental more than anything with the settings.  I've noticed over time my phone has gotten improved battery life, probably with the updates plus getting done with whatever the new OS had to do early on.   That is, unless the OP uses only apps with black themes the majority of the time, going from x hours of mostly white screen to x hours of mostly black screen. But with every day use as you mention I can't see it making much of a difference."

Everything works on KK, it's what the phone was built for, optimized for and very functional."

While many of my peers have gone out and bought small tablets to fit in their white coats, my note 4 has done everything it needs to without any issue.    Not to mention having the stylus helps make it appear that I am actually using it for work and not just texting.   Using office apps and such can be a pain in the ass on the smaller screen, but if you are only filling in small details or making corrections the note 4 is more than enough."

I have an ipad for a couple of yers which i used to take it with me at work and use it intensly at home but since i got the note 4 the ipad mostly collects dust except when i cook, using it for youtube (cause bigger screen)"

Now after Note upgrades I no longer use my tab and retired it to our niece last Christmas.  I do most of my work on my phone, enjoy reddit and read my kindle books on my Note.  Sure the screen is a little small but adequate and the transition began because I always have my Note with me, whereas the tab was often left behind because of its bulk. And one day I realized that it had been weeks since I used my tab. I also use my computer about 20 to 30 % less than I used to as I have shifted more of every day processes to my Note."
galaxynote4,3bzbvf,deathdealer351,2,Fri Jul 3 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"I ditched the android tablets a year ago. The main problem is that they don't offer anything over android phones beyond having bigger displays. All the software is the same - so anything you can do on a tablet you can also do on a phone. So you won't feel ""castrated"". However, if you physically need the space to do your work/play, then you'll probably miss the extra inches of a tablet."
galaxynote4,3bzbvf,MarcusGen,2,Fri Jul 3 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"I had a laptop, a tablet and a phone. Sold the laptop and the tablet and bought an original surface pro. Thought I'd use it as a tablet too. I only use it as a computer, mostly connected to the monitor in my study if I need real work done. I'm an architect so I use graphics heavy and windows only software a lot.  Now that I also have the note 4. I don't need the computer to have a stylus at all. And what's amazing is, the pen accuracy on the note 4 is far superior to surface pro. Note 4 also has much higher resolution and longer battery life.  If I had to do it again today I would get a laptop and mostly dedicate it to the 23 inch monitor in my study room and keep the note 4 for everything else. Tablets aren't necessary.  If I didn't need the windows only software I would even get rid of the laptop and use note 4 exclusively and setup a monitor, keyboard, mouse dock in my study for the occasional work from home.  TL;DR: If you use Windows specific software for work from home, get a $500 laptop plus note 4 for everything else. If you don't need a windows computer at all, get a $150 23 inch monitor, an HDMI adapter and Bluetooth keyboard mouse for your note 4 and don't even use a laptop."

What makes Galaxy Note 5 such an interesting topic this year is whether or not Samsung will transfer the Galaxy S6's design to the Note 5. The question primarily being asked is: Will the Note 5 still sport a MicroSD slot and removable battery? Two very important points that many would argue as critical to the Note line seeing as how Samsung positions it as the productivity and power-user flagship.  I don't know how important a MicroSD slot is to you but keep in mind, a removable battery opens up the door to an extended battery pack and on-the-fly battery swapping if good battery power is high on your priority list. I'd wait until Samsung delivers concrete information on that for the Note 5."

I switched from the nexus 5 to the note 4 myself and I was happy with the decision.   Just keep in mind you're trading open hardware for, well, locked down hardware that is superior in performance. You won't have as much variety in custom ROMs on a note 4 like you would with a nexus device, especially if you get the exynos variant. But with all that said, I still think trading a microsd slot, removable battery and awesome camera for a locked bootloader and a tripped Knox counter was worth it.   Another thing you should be concerned about is updates. With a nexus device you have the privilege of receiving the latest and greatest software android has to offer, and Samsung is notorious for only keeping the current flagship up to date. Who knows if the note 4 will ever get Android M when it is launched? Right now we're stuck on 5.0.1 and most note 4 users are sticking to kitkat because the performance on lollipop is not up to their standards.   With all that said it's really up to you whether you want to play the waiting game or not. You can get a pretty good deal on an unlocked note 4 right now, but if you have the cash and want to be on the cutting edge of what technology Samsung has to offer, go ahead and wait."

At the very least, go to a store and play with a few and get a feel for the device. I've seen a few in the wild that were relatively smooth but mine definitely doesn't feel fluid.

Nice hot cinnamon latte all over the bottom of my phone.  Quickly pulled the battery out, and got tissue to get the water out of the charging port and S-pen slot immediately. Then got some compressed air/nitrogen to blow dry and bits I couldn't reach with the tissue.  Powered it back on a couple of hours later and it all worked fine. I guess I got a bit lucky. But to be honest, as long as you don't power electronics on while they're wet, you'll typically get away with it and no permanent damage to them."

galaxynote4,3bypzi,gert_has_issues,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:25:25 2015 UTC,I just figured it out. Even though I had the app running I had Samsung Apps which is a separate tab under the Data tab set to background data restricted. After I re enabled that it showed back up on my lock screen. It just seems strange because I never set up a Samsung account so it's not backing anything up but whatever it wants I guess.

I've tried/changed everything possible, but nothing manages to fix it. I've replaced the phone, tired various different ROMs, even using CM12. I've been through all the tools like greenify/deep sleep/amplify, and changed the battery, yet the lag and dire battery life are still there.  It's a shame as the phone is so nice in other ways, but the lag and battery life utterly ruin it for me."
galaxynote4,3bsshg,Cassiuz,2,Thu Jul 2 08:33:45 2015 UTC,"Same. Even if they worked, the fact that you need to jump through so many hoops to get this phone anywhere near ios performance means that it's broken."

galaxynote4,3bsshg,squirrelmasterzero,8,Wed Jul 1 22:38:09 2015 UTC,hear hear. ya like 7 or eight months after launch. who cares if the specs are good if the phone cannot do the most simple of things well.

I went and did a dumb thing and bought the Note 4, hoping the hardware would make up for the software, and I was wrong. I'll never make that mistake again. It will be Nexus devices for me from now on, or anything I can get my hands on that has pure Android (such as developers editions from Verizon). It is really the reason why Apple can make every single experience perfect, because of their closed platform. For me that is a worse proposition but for some that is what works best, and it is completely understandable."

I've had android phones since the original Galaxy S, but I'm just growing tired with the issues I have. My Note 4 is a lovely phone, but the lag gets tiresome (it's hardly game breaking, but it's just frustrating and makes using it less enjoyable) and the battery life is abysmal. Getting 2 hours screen on time over around 12 hours total time off-charge is pathetic from a device with specs like this.  I'll wait and see what Samsung announce with the Note 5, and how it compares with the iPhone 6s/6S+, but for the first time I'lll absolutely be considering one as an actual option."

The Note 4 is a horrible phone aside from the S-Pen and the camera, and even that is a hit or miss. There was a bad batch of Note 4 devices that had faulty cameras. I had one of them and had to get it replaced. The camera was literally unusable due to it would never focus.  The lollipop update only made the device more unstable. I actually downgraded back to kitkat. If you've installed the lollipop update do a fresh reset and let it install all hour apps from the play store. Then go back to kitkat and do the same thing. It will literally install your apps 10 times faster on kitkat. That is no joke.  If you think the Note 4 is perfect you're either stupid or a Samsung fan boy. You should probably go to /r/samsungcirclejerk, it seems to be more appropriate for you."
galaxynote4,3bsshg,LeeyFox,3,Thu Jul 2 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"I don't experience any lag on my note 4. I have pretty much no tweaks and pure stock unrooted, and just a couple of annoying apps disabled (S-voice, facebook etc). Even touchwiz launcher is quite lag free, but I have a strong preference for nova.  I think possible causes of lag:   Apps you installed from play store that may slow down the phone  A bad SD card, or too many apps on the sd card (sd card is slower than internal memory after all)  Overheating of phone due to environment/playing intensive games or apps (the processor throttles to prevent further overheating, making it lag)  Power saving mode is on (and you enabled restrict performance)  You have only just wiped the phone and the phone is setting itself up for the first couple of hours. My phone lagged slightly for the first day before it became smooth  The app that you like to use may lag, because it isn't very optimised.  Changing the DPI to something not stock (my settings app always had dropped frames when I scrolled, but after going back to stock it had no issues)  Recent apps lag/ camera app to gallery lag (this is something that affects all note 4 phones, it's just touchwiz being horrible)  Or that your phone might be defective and you should get it changed with warranty."

Sure, certain sites cause lag, but besides that, everything runs smoothly most of the time. I've got lollipop and I'm just using touchwhiz. I've moved everything I can to an SD card, disabled any apps I didn't need, and I regularly clear my cache and go through and delete any apps/pictures/files that I don't need anymore. The only thing bothering me right now is my unlock screen. I'll put in the pattern and nothing happens the first time. I have it hidden so you can't seen it be drawn but usually if I do it wrong it turns red. Maybe I'll just remove the pattern."

Asked if I could plug in to one of their chargers and...... nothing.  The guy looked at the port and said there was a little bit of green which meant liquid damage.  I did get a little liquid on it the other night but didn't think that was it.  He said it wasn't part of the main board so it wouldn't be THAT expensive of a repair... however I thought I saw on Youtube that the screen has to be taken off and everything.  I still get the vibrating every 2 seconds when the phone is off so I am hoping it is something with the Euro OEM charger and will try mine when I get home in the States in a few days.

This was of course even after a factory reset. What did help was flashing a ROM which feels so much more optimized and how the phone should have came out of the box.  There is tons of help on XDA to root and flash a ROM on your phone.
galaxynote4,3brz8z,Corbinworks,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:08:14 2015 UTC,"XDA is an amazing resource. However ROM flashing and root greatly depend on which carrier. I am on At&T with a regular note 4, no perm root solution. Android 5.x.x does provide a needed visual overhaul for the interface, improves performance with ART runtime (replacing DALVIK) and provides many tweaks. I recommend, if you are knowledgeable, if you cannot get root to disable all that bloatware crap you can download a debloater app (search XDA) to disable much of it. Sometimes that helps performance and battery a bit."

Here's what he said:   I didn't use anything to backup my settings aside from backing up my text messages. I restored my settings manually by hand.   Do you think some rogue app or setting is being restored to your device?  The only reason why I'm thinking this is because I, too, did a clean install where I manually redid all my settings, app downloads,  etc. The only major difference I'm seeing here is that you used a backup solution, while we didn't.  Might be something worth investigating, although I can't say for sure. Heck, it could just be that we both got lucky and got fixed battery life the first time we tried using it."

This battery life seems to be better than I had with only doing a Factory Reset, but I do not feel that it as good as it was with KitKat.  I don't have any hard numbers to base this off of unfortunately, just how the phone feels to me.  I used to be able to have it off the charger for a full day and be able to go to sleep without worry that it would die before my alarm went off.  I want to also note that I still am experiencing the bluetooth sound issue that some others are having.  The bluetooth connections stays connected, but it stops playing sound through the headphones until I disconnect and reconnect them.  I am hoping it was a fluke and on Wednesday when I am at the gym it does not do it again.  Good battery or not, the bluetooth problem is very frustrating and is alone enough reason to downgrade back to KitKat for me."

I did remove the case's screen protector because I felt like a stick on protector felt better.  The hard plastic frame feel tough and capable and the rubber shell feels great in my hand. I've had the phone and case since Feb and none of the port covers show any wear.  the only issue that I have found with the case is with S Health. Though the case does not cover any of the sensors, it was difficult to get decent placement on the heart-rate sensor for a reliable reading.  Just so you know I'm a larger guy, so my hands are slightly larger than average. The note 4 is already a pretty large phone and this case probably doubles the thickness of the phone, and adds a bit more to the profile. If I had a ruler I'd measure it for you.  The biggest drawback is the $70 pricetag"

First is the Caseology black carbon fibre case This was a really nice case, the lip gives enough space so the screen doesn't touch any surfaces, the back felt really nice and smooth, black and gold combo. My only complaint is the gold sides felt kinda plasticy not really premium but it does look premium for sure and it's pretty cheap in price too.  Second is the Zerolemon 10,000 mah battery case I really liked this case because it gave me from 3-4 days of of usage with the nuisance of charging it or carry an external battery. My grip with it is that it weighs a ton and can barely fit into my jeans. Using it as a backup though or those days when you need a long charge.  Last is the Samsung S view case I wanted to switch to a flip style case because of how nice the metal sidings of the note 4 was, I wanted to show it off more rather than hid it under a case. Looks great, S view screen looks nice, and I don't' have to completely cover my phone.  Recently though I've been going caseless on my phone. The metal sidings and the phone overall just looks so sleek and nice and I have forgotten how light the phone is without cases too. It is a worry sometimes, you never know when that one ill drop could happen lol"

galaxynote4,3bs12w,itzST,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:40:27 2015 UTC,"Ok.... Short answer: no  Long amswer: first of all: to save on production costs, the screens have touch panel imbedded in the bottom layes of the screen for durability, slim profile, ease of installation. Almost modular way of manufacturing, thats why a modular phone isnt too far out of a crasy idea.   So the bonus of that is, you can still use the phone when the screen is cracked, huge benifit for emergency situations. Increases the time you can use the phone without needing to replace the damaged screen straight away. It is glass after all, and allot of poeple can drop their phone and crack it.   Lastly, to make the touch panel super sensitive, the layers are glued together so to replace the glass and not the touch panel glue has to be seperated. Hardly possible."

A good place to start is CDMA-WARE, they're a Russian company that offer solutions for both gsm and CDMA provisioning.   Its a subscription service for $80/year and you can only have it on one computer, since it is a key file generated for your specific machine configuration, also no vm's :/    I known I'm probs gonna get down voted past hell and into China for this post but I advocate for the open access of information and have a personal vendetta against censorship, at least in this context - if the device is yours and you paid it off with your own hard earned money, then you should be free to do anything you wish with said device."

Second, you rooted your phone, then had issues with the OS - then want to blame Samsung for the issues?  To make matters worse, you get upset that Samsung is charging you to fix the issues you caused by rooting the phone?    Come on guy.    What did you do when you rooted the phone?  Did you not see the half-dozen warnings on XDA and Chainfire's website that this will trip you Knox counter and it will void your warranty?    You can hate the phone all you want, but don't try to blame Samsung for you voiding your warranty and fucking up your own phone.  LG, Google (Motorola), Apple, and Sony all void your warranty if you root the thing.    About the screen.  These thing use LOCA glue, so either you had someone do a shoddy screen replacement job (hence why it took ""days"" at a repair center, when normally a re-flash takes minutes), or you left it in an extremely hot car, in something like a dash-mount.  Either way, you're not taking care of the phone and that makes it really hard to take much of your story seriously."

After a couple of days — the death sentence — Samsung wouldn’t cover the warranty as I had non-official software on the phone (not sure if it was because it was rooted or because of the tripped knox counter. Cost for repair? 90% of the current selling price of the handset.     You do complain about paying for service, before you received the phone back.    There are no reasons to unglue your screen, but a lot of reasons not to (it's a risky process to separate the AMOLED from the glass.  No reason why would they would ever do that for a software update.  Like I said, you're not giving us the whole story."

Annoying to miss a turn by miles before Google Maps finally catches up and says, ""Make a U-turn.""  I honestly wish Samsung would focus more on reliability than all these trillion gee-whiz bloatware features.  A lot of Note 4's also have a hardware camera focusing problem too, and guess what, mine's got it.  These are the risks you run if you buy a used one.    I would have bought a new one except that T-Mobile's web site wouldn't let me unless I also signed up for a plan.  And Samsung has no Note 4 model meant for the U.S. market that isn't sold exclusively through a carrier.  So just no official channel to buy a new one outright here (and without an official purchasing channel, I think you don't get warranty service, as they will say that you purchased a used phone).  At least at the time I bought mine.  Probably will be my last Samsung phone.  They are too in-bed with the U.S. carriers and are spreading themselves too thin, with too many models, to make reliable products any more.  Carrier agnosticism will be the most important factor on my list, like the Nexus line."

So driving a car that I'm unfamiliar with in a city I'm also unfamiliar with is stressful enough on its own. My GPS hardly worked at all the entire time I was out there. It was singlehandedly the most frustrating experience I've had with a smart phone.   I am on t mobile and I don't have the protection plan since I work a desk job and have never once cracked a screen. I fear I won't be able to get the issue fixed because I don't have the protection plan on my line.   What I've done for a solution is used my note 4 as a wireless Hotspot and connected my note 2 to use the GPS.   I've gone on a 3 hour journey across my state and had both my note 2 and note 4 set to the same address. The note 2 worked just fine even without cell phone signal. The note 4 never made it to the freeway without losing signal.   If you download GPS essentials on the play store you can see if your GPS will connect to the satellites above you and around your area to figure out your location. My note 4 simply doesn't connect when I run the app.   It's such a shame because I had absolutely zero issues with my note 2. I loved that phone and it honestly was the best device I've ever owned.   The note 4 lags, the GPS doesn't work, and it also has WiFi connectivity issues. On top of that my coworker has the iPhone 6 plus and always rubs in my face how much more battery she has.

Many apps will recognize the folder and put the videos inside it into your library, but if the videos don't show up automatically just navigate to them and open them in VLC or whatever video app you prefer.  *I have yet to find a video that would not play. As long as you're not trying to play some completely oddball format you should have no problems."

I don't know much about this, so don't quote me, but heard someone mention it was related to the kernel, rather than being a staple of all TW-based ROMs.  So maybe try looking into that?

galaxynote4,3bltrf,heartlegs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:55:03 2015 UTC,"So far it's fine. There is a slight burn in at the notification bar, but it's not much and only noticeable when the whole screen is the same colour. But I got it at roughly half price, 6 months old, so I'm not complaining. I think the guy has used the screen a lot and had brightness all the way up.  GPS seems to work ok, taking a few seconds to lock in. Camera works okay so far. It's on Lollipop so I dunno about battery life yet.  It's been running 2 hours and 46 minutes and had 1 hour and 25 minutes of screen time and there is 73% left. And that includes commuting for about an hour in a very spotty reception area AND I was downloading apps all the time (new phone, you know). So it seems decent. For now.  I like the S-Pen, I can see myself using that quite a bit in the future. Phone feels good in hand. Fingerprint reader is only average. So far, I've not had to resort to inputting my code, but it's certainly not as effective as Apple's TouchID or the S6's.  As for lag, well the phone was factory restored yesterday and no, it's maybe not as INSTANT as stock Android phones, but I have no really complaints.  Still, there are things I need to learn and utilize better, but I think that will come in time. For now, it seems like a good phone."
galaxynote4,3bltrf,shepx13,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:06:13 2015 UTC,"I've had my note 4 since it came out. I'm on 5.0.1 I belive. In general, I am pretty happy with my phone relative to the negativity that surrounds TouchWiz. There is no app opening lag or camera lag, which is what you seem to be most concerned about. The front camera lags in low light (not opening, but when you move the phone the camera blurs) and the gallery app lags on opening when you reach around 500 photos, especially if you are opening the gallery from the lock screen (viewing photos you took from the camera that you opened on the lock screen)   I got the note 4 for my rotations and as a notepad it has been indispensable. I'm not sure it could substitute for an actual notebook but quick jotting notes it is a life saver.   However, there are some personal, small caveats that will definitely prevent me from returning to Samsung again:  It has started to freeze and crash randomly. I have only clash of clans and hearthstone installed as well as several medical apps. Everything else is stock and vanilla.   When I open apps now my wallpaper will turn a lighter shade. Don't know why. Really bothers me.   The recent menu button is still really slow.   The front camera, in addition to the low light lag, has a wierd fish lensing going on when a person is on the edge of a selfie. The face gets distorted. Ruined several otherwise good photos I wanted to keep.   Gallery app lags when it gets to around 500 photos.   S note lags when you have even just one notebook with over 40 pages in it. I have about 10 notebooks all with several hundred pages- Holy crap they take forever to open.   So I guess it does have the hiccups you mentioned. But it's a lot better than what I was told was going to happen.   Overall I'm really happy with it, it's like... 98% perfect. This is my first Android phone coming from a 4s, so there may be some growing pains. Just it has these issues for me that I don't know if there are workarounds for. Maybe there are. Anyway, that's my honest opinion. I'm probably going back to Apple after this phone, though."

For the charging issue, when I plug in my USB charger that came with the phone, nothing happens, but when I turn off my phone and then plug in the USB charger, my phone starts charging, which I really don't understand. For the audio distortion, for example, I downloaded the Game of Thrones theme song for my alarm clock, but after a few days I noticed that the audio sounded different and it was diluted (it wasnt as clear as it was before), and I really couldn't find an explanation for this anywhere on google."
galaxynote4,3bjvp6,Kevin_Wolf,2,Tue Jun 30 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"Have you tried a different charger? Sounds stupid, but if your charger can't put out the amperage the phone needs while it's on, it might not register as charging. Lower power requirements while it's off and all. If you want to go crazy, do a factory reset. If that works it's software.   I'd try a different charger first. Resetting your phone is a pain in the ass."

Some people says Snapdragon version consumes less battery but I also heard the otherwise, since I only own the Exynos version I can't really contribute to that matter but I can say that: If you want a futureproof one as you said, I think you should go with the Exynos version. Exynos supports 64-bit and according to the Sammobile's insider, Samsung is supposedly working on a 64-bit version of Android 5.1 for the Note 4."

Audio quality is not even noticeably different to the exynos (unless you're an audiophile with high end gear, which if you are you'd have a microusb dac anyway). The speeds are not noticeably different either - but the snapdragon has way better battery. 64bit and all those nonsense ""8 core"" arguments are redundant, because in the real world they make NO difference."

Ultimately, I chose the Exynos version based on this video and a few other things I had read comparing the two.  It should be noted that apparently the N910C is missing a particular frequency band (800MHz I believe?) that helps with signal penetration. You might notice your signal strength suffering a bit inside your home/any building but it shouldn't be unusable I'd imagine. Like I said, I've only had this thing for a day and I definitely noticed a weak signal inside my office building, but I still have signal and the ability to place/receive calls."

Just goto Xda and search for your model and look for stock roms. There are loads of deoxed ones you can use. I personally use Simplrom or Sweet rom for the N910C. So yes, this means you're going to have to get flashify (app store look it up), and on it you can install TWRP and CWR (a recovery) to install a rom."

After that do a full whipe (excluding sd card obv) and then click install on twrp, select the ROM.zip and slide to install! You will lose all data sadly. The best backup and restore features are like just the apps themselves and not what data they have. :/ But yeah that's how you install a rom. Anything goes wrong? Restore to your twrp backup, can't access twrp/bootloop? Flash it stock with odin :P"

galaxynote4,3bk2ej,ottoofc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"Something that's unclear: Did you initiate the replacement through Samsung or AT&T? You mention the repair place in Houston, but never specified if that's an AT&T repair location or Samsung.  In any case, this is usually why if my phone needs repair I will try to go through the carrier before going through the OEM. The carrier will generally overnight you a device and you send it back and they take care of everything, whereas going directly to the OEM you usually have to do a lengthy RMA process and they drag their feet, as demonstrated here.  Sadly, not much you can do other than constantly bothering them. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, right?"
galaxynote4,3bk2ej,Xodium,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:30:45 2015 UTC,exactly my fear... samsung really needs to ante up its consumer facing presence for support.  Apple store is wonderful for support.

Sand contains some tiny, VERY hard silicate particles that basically cut like glass like a hot knife in butter, so it's very hard not to scratch the screen this way.  When I go to the beach I just leave my phone in a sealed pocket and don't use it at all unless my hands are completely sand-free."

Also sick of the bullshit, I went to the same link you did, found mine and flashed via Odin.   I cannot tell you how relieved I was and still am when it booted into kitkat. After booting up the phone, I saw that the software patch was available to install, it is the last kitkat update (about 150mb) prior to the lollipop update. Thing is, it was already downloaded and waiting to install after booting up.   After installing the patch, it then started to download the lollipop update. I immediately went to all apps and disabled one of the 'software update' apps (there's two, one you can't disable), and it didn't do anything noticeable that I'm aware of. Or if it did do something to help, I can't tell, so would recommend doing this anyway.   How did I stop the download? I turned it off wifi, and it said download failed. Turned it back on wifi, it started to download again. I repeated this about 10 times, and it got upset, lol, saying something like 'you know what, I'm not doing this anymore, when you're ready to install lollipop go download it from settings manually fuck face.'   The key here is to get it BEFORE it downloads entirely. You need to actively catch it right away.

galaxynote4,3bg3lj,TimeWasterNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:52:05 2015 UTC,"When I first got my Note 4, it came automatically updated to Lollipop. Tried it out, thought that the battery life was less than impressive, so I went back to Kit Kat.   Kit Kat was actually more impressive, I kept track of the battery consumption and power usage by the apps using the Battery Widget Pro App.   After a week on Kit Kat, and reading around the subreddit about the LP update, decided to give it a try.   So this past past Friday, I went with the update over night. No factory reset or cache clearing. Just straight using it from the start. And it actually carried over the battery life from Kit Kat.   The power consumption between KK and LP are basically the same and I get excellent stand by time, maybe loss a % every 2 2 hours, or so if I'm not using it. Can definitely get 4 hours of SOT easy, and it lasted from being unplugged at 0100 all the way to 2330, and still had juice for a few more hours.  As for automatic updates I unchecked that option in the settings while I was in Kit Kat, and didn't get bothered by it during my one week trial of KK."

If you don't mind paying full retail,  the t-mobile note 4 still works on AT&T,  even if it's locked to the carrier (lot of at&t phones are interchangeable with t-mobile this way).  And the t-mobile note 4 is also very easy to root. This is what I would have done if I could,  so if you want to go this route,  return your at&t note 4 while you still can!  I do remember seeing someone get so fed up on the Xda thread and mention how this phone is impossible to root and it'll never be done permanently.  Don't know if this guy is talking out of his ass,  but his comment made me realize that root on AT&T note 4 phones might be months, or a year away from now...."

Covers are basically folders but instead of the normal folder icon it shows the icon of the first app on the folder with a little square in the corner. Just swipe any direction on that icon to open the folder. I just think it looks better that way. Shutters are kind of the same thing but with the widget instead of a folder. You can also change the icons with icon packs like Nova and it has the gestures like Nova. It's definitely not as customizable but I like it.

Install it on a device. It runs like crap Optimize it until it feels ok Ship it   Now, every release, you do the same thing. You add features on a super fast platform to make development go quickly, then test and optimize for slower devices.  There are a ton of android options out there, with a ton of different hardware specs. So you focus on current gen, with special attention to popular last gen phones, then you backfill what you can on older handsets, but by now, you need to focus on the next new thing, so you don't spend quite as long on the older generations.   Nexus don't get carrier development cycles. They just get new Google code and since it's only one unit a year, they can test way back and optimise.   TL;DR  it costs money to optimise new code on old hardware. Some companies/models/carriers have an edge by having less devices, or spend more on development."

Not just with update tho, you could clearly see that phone is getting slower each month. After a time it started to lag even while opening the apps and I sold it.  The reason why many Note 4 users suffer the same lag/wear issues is caused by Google IMO. The products they had released this year really feels like unbaked. They strated to release apps like releasing incomplete and really bad early access games on Steam. But, no matter what I do, I couldn't get rid of the stutters and poor battery life on my Note 4.

It seemed to drain about 10% per hour, even with light use.  That rate changed considerably with heavy use.  I guess this wasn't a bad thing - 10 hours is pretty good.  But a friend recommended an extended battery.  Got on Amazon, ordered an extended battery for $40 or so from Hyperion.  It came with a larger back cover too.  Honestly, I'm really happy with the extended battery.  I have at least double the capacity now - 20hrs on a charge.

I've bought a replacement battery, as well as disabling everything I can. Even xposed services like deep sleep and greenify made little difference.   It's a shame as the phone is fantastic in all other ways, but the battery life just keeps me from being happy with it.   From what I can tell, it's a hardware issue when there's low signal strengths.

There're TouchWiz ROMs (basically modified Samsung ROM) and custom Cyanogenmod and ACIP - clean Android experience without Samsungs's bloatware and apps.  If you flash ROM or unlock it you will VOID warranty. That's first thing you should know also you can brick phone. If you flash any stable ROM you will definetly get better performance and battery life. Some ROMs are specialized for battery life.

The problem seems I do not have access to a PC. I'm a Mac user and use a Mac at work. I have Windows running as a virtual disk through Parallels, which I thought would work just fine. I was apparently wrong. I DL'd all the necessary stuff to root (Chainfire) and every time I went to run it, nothing happened. I have experience with rooting (this is my 2nd Android, JB'd all of my previous iPhones). I guess I have to use an actual Windows PC that's not being run as a virtual drive to get this to work?

I have T-Mobile and traded in my Note 3 for this Note 4 and they check for three things:   Any signs of water damage? Does the phone still power on? Any physical damage(scratched/cracked screen, etc.)    If the answer to 1 and 3 is 'no' and 'yes' to 2 then you're good for an upgrade. My Note 3 was rooted when I traded it in but I had to take it to a nearby shop to replace the cracked screen which cost me $90.  This was my experience with T-Mobile. If you have another carrier then check with them to be sure.   EDIT: general wear and tear due to age (like small dents, dings and chipped paint along the edges of a Galaxy Note 3) didn't exclude my phone from T-Mobile's upgrade program.   Having said that, YMMV."

I had to get a replacement recently cause my original note 4 was stuck on boot and Knox had reactivation locked on so couldn't reflash my phone (left it on my part derp).  But Knox was tripped and I just filed a replacement and jumped covered it. T-mobile tech asked me what was wrong just kept it simple for them stuck at boot and Knox has reactivation on and they just ordered me a new one.

galaxynote4,3b3kx6,SirFargy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:07:24 2015 UTC,I had this problem for ages. I can tell you how to temporarily solve it but it's pointless since it will recur within hours.   Calender  apps mostly use The built-in exchange calender sync account so changing to most calender apps won't help.   The only option I have found is to install Microsoft own buildin outlook app that includes a calender view. It works because it uses its own exchange sync.   It's decent but there is no way I know of to directly go to the Calender without going through the email client.   The other option is non free install Nine. It is again primarily a email client but it also provides Calender integration.   Once you get that setup all your Calenders will work.   I don't even use Nine for emails just install it for calender intergration then use whatever app I want.
galaxynote4,3b3kx6,secretsarebest,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:26:04 2015 UTC,"Delete your current exchange account from your phone. Then download ""exchange services"" from apkmirror.

They could do something awesome and have all your data synced with drive and restore when you sign back in, and they have a setup that does that supposedly, but I've never found it to work at all - it just installs the apps it had installed last and that's it, no data.  Supposedly the app data gets backed up if devs enable it, but really it shouldn't have to involve devs.    To do a full backup/restore like on iPhone you need to be rooted and have a custom recovery like TWRP or CWM, but we can't do that because locked bootloader / no root."
galaxynote4,3b0jvm,vitras,12,Thu Jun 25 00:14:52 2015 UTC,"My experiences with smart watches and the note series include:   Lg G Watch Samsung Gear S Moto 360   The G Watch was good, but I just didn't like the feel of it, I am not sure why exactly, it got the job done for me to see everything on my wrist without having to have my phone out.  The Gear S, was a beautiful watch, always caught peoples eyes (even the people who had no idea of smart watches asking me if it was the Apple Watch; very annoying) but an issue I had was that I wasn't capable of responding to text messages with hangouts on the watch.  I use Hangouts exclusively, and with the Gear S, you cannot respond to any sort of message with Hangouts, it had to be the messaging app, so if you use that you are fine, and it even has a keyboard on screen for the messaging app.  Now with the Moto 360.  I have had it for now 3-4 weeks, and I feel like I have the G Watch again, but this time it actually looks like a normal watch.  People haven't noticed it is a smart watch and those who have looked carefully, I can see them studying it with their eyes for a minute and then talk to them about it. It is a lot more pleasant than when I had the Gear S.  I like that it is rounded and I honestly had a toss up between this and the G Watch R, but because I also use a Nexus 6, I decided to go with the Moto.  Plus the charging dock is dope. ;)  Any other questions feel free to ask."
galaxynote4,3b0jvm,tjb90,6,Thu Jun 25 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"With the Gear S,  you would need to install Gear Notification Extender from the Play Store.  This will allow you to reply back to most messaging apps with the built in keyboard or voice.  I use my Gear S remotely and it works great."

Or is it really intended to basically be a small phone/tablet attached to your wrist, instead of an extension of your phone (as that is mainly what I'm looking for).   I have a Note 4 and Tab S, and feel like this would work well considering I'm pretty well ingrained in Samsung's world."

I know Android Wear does kitchen sink kind of stuff, but the band passes OPs requirements with flying colors. The alarm is a silent vibrate. Sleep tracking is very accurate. Battery charged from flat to 80% in 30 mins (toss on when in the shower). Fitness stuff is impossible to beat with integrated GPS. Granted with Windows Phone it's much more capable (keyboard, cortana, voice replies) but Cortana is coming to Android soon, so there you go. It will probably suck though, but the band doesn't really need that level of integration.  I sold my 360 after a frustrating few months, got a Microsoft Band. Zero regrets. SMSs and notifications hit my band instantly, while my Note 4 doesn't show the text until ~10 seconds later. Strange, but it's a great heads-up and I can read it on the band first (before deciding to pull out my phone). Can reply via canned responses for now, but voice is supposedly on the way for Android (voice and keyboard via band are on WP).  Thanks for the lead. Would have been gold if you knew how awesome the band really is. And the golf features (google it) that are coming soon are pretty awesome if you play golf.  OP wanted a wrist notification center. The band does this easily plus a ton of other fitness/sleep related tasks. And it does them all very well. No regrets bailing on Wear for now."

galaxynote4,3axk5e,keoke916,6,Wed Jun 24 13:25:30 2015 UTC,"I bought a Note 4 last week after doing my due diligence. I came from the Nexus 4 I've had for the last 3 years (I've gone past my 'early adopter phase' obviously) and after ""accidentally"" shattering it, it was time to move to a new device slightly sooner than I planned.  The Nexus 6 was on my radar because I loved the idea of Google Fi, but that's where the love affair ended. As much as I loved my N4, the battery life in the end was absolutely abysmal; and it was because the battery itself had been through so many charge cycles. The N6? same deal- after a few years it'd become unusable without pulling it apart to replace the battery, and while I fancy myself a hobbyist tinkerer; playing around with something that crucial to me is not in the cards.  The S6 was in my viewfinder as well; but the price didn't justify the lack of... oomph, I suppose. Plus- I decided I wanted to go big or go home (screen size) on my next device.  The Note 4, despite being a year old, found it's way to my radar after going through the other (and there were many other) options. Sure, it's no longer 'cutting edge'. But it was everything I needed in a device: massive screen real estate, the backbone of Samsung (say what you will, but they make great devices), replaceable battery and expandable storage (I spend time out of coverage areas sometimes, so the recent 'store it in the cloud!' trend is kinda not for me) and powerful processing that isn't likely to be supremely outdated anytime soon.  I pulled the trigger on the N910C last week, it arrived Monday, and I couldn't be happier. I went with Exynos because I wanted the big/little power and the ability to throttle them independently, plus the international versions were slightly less expensive. It's working flawlessly for me on T-Mobile. The speed is impressive, the storage is insane, the battery life is great as-is, and I grabbed 2 extra batteries and 2 chargers (work and home) for 'just in case' alongside a ZeroLemon case/10k mah battery for if I really want to go crazy.  I'm thrilled. Nothing else I would have bought could have come close to what I needed- a workhorse phone with expandability and support from both the developer and hardware side of things that is nearly unparalleled. I see this device lasting me another 3 years, at the least- with smart use of the CPUs and OC'ing when things get crazy in the future- maybe even longer."
galaxynote4,3axk5e,Cassiuz,3,Wed Jun 24 10:34:41 2015 UTC,"This is a fantastic comment because it's pretty much exactly the same kind of stuff that's been going through my head while I attempt to hold myself back from buying a Note 4 right now.  So the N910CExynos...are you getting 4G LTE with that thing on T-Mobile in the US? I found a few Notes for sale around the web that were great price-wise but they all turned out to not be 4G LTE capable, which is a deal breaker for me."
galaxynote4,3axk5e,starlinguk,2,Wed Jun 24 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"That was a huge concern before I purchased but some reading showed that the 910C is a fit for both tmo and att in the US. I believe I'm only missing one band for tmo, and it's a perfect match for att. The 'missing one band' thing has yet to be an issue. I work in a major metro area, but live just barely inside the city limits and I'm at anywhere between 2-4 bars of 4G at all times (minus inside my office, where I think the building penetration band I'm missing is showing its stripes, as I sit at 1 bar there usually, but I'm on wifi so it's irrelevant.)  If you're in the USA, on tmobile of att, the N910C is a safe buy. I couldn't be happier with it as a phone or a true workhorse of a communications device."

Thanks for the informative comment.  I am now this close [ ] to pulling that trigger and snatching one of these beauties up to replace my 1st gen Moto X. This weekend will serve as a fantastic test of my self control.  If I do bite the bullet, I'd love to hear more about your specific rom, kernal, and performance tweaks you've done to get the most juice out of your Note. I haven't messed much with tweaking things since I moved on from my Galaxy Nexus a couple years ago, but I do still love to fiddle with that sort of thing if the gains are appreciable."

galaxynote4,3axk5e,Waibashi,2,Wed Jun 24 10:41:07 2015 UTC,"I will be buying off contract. I never buy a phone on contract in Denmark and providers aren't allowed to ""lock"" phones anyway."
galaxynote4,3axk5e,drummmergeorge,2,Wed Jun 24 20:19:06 2015 UTC,That's why I am so happy to live in Germany/Europe. Like in Denmark the phones aren't hard locked to different providers (unlike in the US) and every phone is the same hardware and software from every provider. It's just great to have basically every Root method and Custom Firmware available.  I have a Note Edge (note 4 with the second screen) btw and would also buy it again in a heartbeat.
galaxynote4,3axk5e,agentpanda,2,Wed Jun 24 11:39:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't considered the Note Edge. Is the Edge of any use? Ie. are there are apps using it, apart from the one that came with the phone?"
galaxynote4,3axk5e,AceTheIceman,3,Wed Jun 24 11:45:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want, I couldn't live without it anymore, that's why I will have it till I dies. There are probably around 20 apps that add functions to the edge from third party devs + 10 or so the own Samsung apps. Since I own a S/Flip Cover the Edge panel is awesome, since I don't have to open my phone for notifications and such.  I just say for what I use it personally:  One Edge pannel are shortcuts+time+date+battery   One Edge Pannel are my most called contacts (so i can quick call them with a button press)  One Edge Pannel for Notifications (whats app, mail and such)  One Edge Pannel with a news feed and news ticker  And then you have Edge pannels that only activate when you open an App for example. I use Poweramp for my music and it has an own Edge bar with settings and such  THere are still other functions that you can add with an Edge Pannel (like weather for example or calendars), but those are the things I use it for. I love it but just remember that if you are a fan of Custom Firmwares that the developement for the Edge is very small. I have a custom Kernel, a deodoxed firmware and a debloated touchwiz based rom but if you are someone who wants to try out new CFs all the time, I wouldn't recommend an Edge.  Otherwise I wold take it any day over a Note 4, since it for pesonally adds a great deal of functions to the phone."
galaxynote4,3axk5e,starlinguk,2,Wed Jun 24 12:38:13 2015 UTC,"Such a detailed answer deserves an upvote and a thanks. Once again, I do see the coolness of the edge, but it's hard to say whether or not I'd use it in the long run. It's also hard to find used Note 4 Edges. Easier with just Note 4.   It's quite a paradox, because on one hand I'd be smart to buy it before the Note 5 is announced, because then it'd rather get that. On the other hand, the Note 4 price will fall a bit then. Oh well, 1st world problems :-)"
galaxynote4,3axk5e,AceTheIceman,2,Wed Jun 24 12:55:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really depends. For me it was clear that I use it quite often. When I only want to check if I got a new mail or whats app I just get my phone out of the pocket, swipe the Edge and then see it. No need to open my flip cover, to put in my unlock code and then look, it really saves a lot of time, same with quick calls or shortcuts.  I got my Note Edge for 530€ NEW from Amazon, while the Note 4 was around 480€, so there wasn't even a question what I'd choose but I ofc don't know how the situation is in Denmark.   Yeah, I dunno, with the Note 5 around the corner I'd honestly wait and see what it has. The chances are high that it will maybe have no removable battery and SD card (which would be a dealbreaker for me and that would mean the Note Edge would be my last Samsung phone), so depending how important it is to you, this would ""justify"" it even more to buy a Note 4 + the prices will fall.  On the other hand, if you are even remotely interested in the Note Edge, it'll get harder and harder to get it. It had such a limited run, since it was basically marketed as a prototype, that it'll be difficult to say how the situation will develop one the note 5 is there.  But yeah, 1st world problems ;)"

galaxynote4,3axk5e,agentpanda,2,Wed Jun 24 11:29:25 2015 UTC,"What about a few CONS of the Note 4? I mean, no phone is perfect :-)"
galaxynote4,3axk5e,AceTheIceman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:53:45 2015 UTC,"Until my case arrives I am terrified I am going to break it. Don't get me wrong, it feels sturdier and more 'put together' than almost any phone I've held (exception for my old, old, old, old PPC-6700 from... well, I'm dating myself). It's just way bigger than any device I've had (sans-tablets) and that much glass makes me nervous. If you're not a power user, battery life could be an issue. I say 'power user' as I mean 'someone down to tweak and get dirty'. I imagine if I had pulled mine right out of the box and expected to update to lollipop and get 7h of screen-on-time, I would be severely disappointed. Instead, I flashed my custom rom, my custom kernel, tweaked my CPU settings, undervolted, greenified/Titanium Backup Froze/etc. Not to the extent some people do- they'll go so far as to stop Gmail from syncing which I think is a bit ridiculous. I leave for work around 8.45, it's currently 22:40 (14h off the charger) I'm presently sporting about 2.5h of screen on time, I'm at 41% battery. I consider this not just reasonable, but exceeding my expectations considering the horror stories I've read from people before my purchase. I also got two spare batteries and two battery chargers (work/home) for the 'just in case' or 'impromptu long boring meeting requiring unusual amounts of day-gaming'. Jack it in and I'm back to 100%, ready to go the next half (or latter part of the night) of the day. Add the fast charger to that equation and I forget sometimes this thing has a battery and doesn't operate on nuclear power. It's big. I came from a Nexus 4, before that (3 years ago) I had an HTC Sensation (that nobody remembers existed). I remember the transition from the Sensation to the N4 which I thought was drastic. The N4 to the Note 4 was a whole other level (and an additional 2 inches, I believe - insert your own joke). I have sizable hands- I can't palm a basketball, but I can get close- and the Note 4 is a big phone. Reaching things on the far side requires a grip adjustment that makes me nervous sometimes (see point one). Is it awkward? A little. Does screen shrinking fix it? absolutely. Will I get used to it? absolutely. People think you're using an iPhone. Chalk this one up to 'my fault'. The white one was cheaper than the black, and I came from 5 years of black phones, so I figured 'go for a change'. Poor idea. Everyone asks if I have the 6+, but I tend to just use the IR blaster to turn off a TV or projector nearby and it dispels such nonsense. :)   TL;DR: Get a case. Tweak your settings for battery life. It's a big phone. Some people are dumb."
galaxynote4,3axk5e,agentpanda,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:13:22 2015 UTC,"Cons:  •Battery life is shit now on Lollipop  •Lag upon pressing the recent apps menu  •Lag when opening the gallery app from within the camera app (if that makes sense)  •Low light camera performance absolutely sucks. Actually, anything but direct sunlight leads to a very grainy, washed out photo  That's about all I can think of, but the phone just feels like its half a step behind. It's definitely not as fast as it should be. I would recommend buying something else."
galaxynote4,3axk5e,nutral,3,Wed Jun 24 13:22:30 2015 UTC,"•Low light camera performance absolutely sucks. Actually, anything but direct sunlight leads to a very grainy, washed out photo   Seriously?! I only just got mine, one of the reasons I bought it is that my old phone's low light performance is absolutely crap (anything but direct sunlight and it sucks) and this one had really good reviews for low light performance. Of course now when I Google it I get shitty reviews (S6 is much better)."
galaxynote4,3axk5e,s2514,-1,Thu Jun 25 02:44:23 2015 UTC,Yes. Mostly any camera with a large sensor (like the Note 4s 16mp) will have bad low light performance. iPhones have amazing low light performance because their cameras are only 8mp.
galaxynote4,3axk5e,2to30,3,Wed Jun 24 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"But the low light performance mostly depends on the aperture (which, with f/2.4, isn't brilliant come to think of it, I had f/1.9 in my head, but that's the S6)."

galaxynote4,3axk5e,uuunity,3,Wed Jun 24 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"I'll respectfully disagree (purely anecdotal) with point 1 and 2.  Battery life is not as good as it could be (forever), but it lasts the 16 hours I need (easily) and I get 3.5h of screen-on easily, which suits my needs. On the days it doesn't (pub with the guys, or (anticipated) overnight stays somewhere without my charger) jack in a spare from the battery charger and you're back to 100 - good for another 18+. It's all about smart use, in my opinion.  Recents lag hasn't been a problem for me. I OC'd the both CPUs in my Exynos and dropped the idle frequencies. Granted, this is another 'case by case' thing- I don't keep a ton of apps open, ever, and I suppose if I did I'd up the idle frequency to compensate for a smoother ride.  Not calling 'bullshit' or anything, but just saying definitely depends on use case."
galaxynote4,3axk5e,soundb0y,2,Wed Jun 24 15:21:34 2015 UTC,"Both of your points are valid. I was just speaking about the problems from my point of view.   Like you, I carry a second battery with me at all times. Thanks to this, the battery life isn't too big of a problem, as I can just pop another in and go right back to 100% when my phone dies. However, I was initially comparing the battery life to what it was on Kit Kat. The 4-4.5h screen-on time is nothing compared to the 6-7 hours of screen on time I was getting regularly on Kit Kat. I actually bought my spare battery in the first place because I could no longer last an entire day with one full charge upon upgrading to Lollipop.  Unfortunately, I have a Verizon Note 4, which is a Snapdragon model. This means I'm unable to root, and unable to OC the CPU. There's no doubt in my mind that doing so would cut down the recent app lag. Kind of unrelated, but I'm trying to get used to keeping all of my apps open as I keep hearing it's the better way to do things on Android.  This phone is starting to seem like one big case of YMMV."
galaxynote4,3axk5e,agentpanda,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"This phone is starting to seem like one big case of YMMV.    We can definitely agree there. I did my research before I dove in and bought mine and realized I definitely wanted the dual-CPUs and I definitely would risk the signal quality loss I'd get on TMo US to get an international version.  I can only imagine what people who don't have forums like this to ask the questions on are experiencing, but even among us 'power users', we're getting such wildly different experiences from this device it's a little bit crazy.  I've been considering downgrading to KitKat- was it really that big a difference? My battery life now is what I'd call 'just fine', in that I wouldn't complain if it were better, but it does its job perfectly and with room to spare. If KitKat could theoretically get me to 7h SoT (with some modding, of course), that'd be pretty cool..."

IMEI black listing is for stolen phones, not because someone refunded you for a service you did not provide. Call your carrier and ask them what they can do about this. Screenshots, logs, anything. If they black list your IMEI your phone will basically be an itouch. It won't be able to connect to shit. Put that part in the Paypal dispute aswell, it will hurt their reputation. Find every place you can and put this in the 0-1 star review for them.   Edit: At this point I would just let the payment go through if it was me. My ~600$ phone isn't worth getting locked out over a small payment like that. There really isn't much seller protection on shit like this and that is why if you ever want to unlock it, get it done from a verified source. Just reading through these guys reviews made me chuckle. Whenever you see a review were the custom takes the time to name the entire website with the .com it's a fake 99% of the time. Literally 3 seconds of googling told me that site was absolute garbage.

Then you take a foot long thin steel wire that you double fold and stick into the newly drilled hole. Now the range is about 300 feet and you can also use it as a taser.

I used to have to TRY to kill my Kit-Kat battery, but I won't rollback because I love some of the new Lollipop features.   Anyway - turn on ""Power Saving Mode"" and click the notification to customize the crappy defaults.   I don't restrict background data since that's the point of a smart phone. Now click on ""Restrict performance"" - there's a menu hidden behind this terrible design!   I check CPU performance and Turn off touch key light. I only notice  slow-down during games like MKX, otherwise it's fine for reading, browsing, etc. Fuck touch keys and their lights :)   I un-check screen output and turn off GPS because I use my big beautiful screen (duh!) and GPS all the time.  Lastly, I leave ""Grayscale mode"" off, again to enjoy the big, beautiful screen. With these settings I can get through a day of heavily streaming Spotify, playing games, navigating and Redditing - of course!"

galaxynote4,3appz2,newpolka,8,Mon Jun 22 14:31:26 2015 UTC,I use the Official Samsung Case and absolutely love it.  It's very inexpensive but made well and fits the phone perfectly since it's made by Samsung.  It's no otterbox for protection but its very slim and actually makes the phone feel better in my hand than going naked.  The screen is somewhat protected since the case gives you a few millimeters of protrusion so you can lay the phone face down without the screen touching the surface which is great for playing music or just privacy and it has survived quite a few drops for me.  The case is sturdy.  Besides that I can pull it off in a second easily to replace the battery which I do daily.  On amazon it ranged from $8-$13 depending on the color.  I have the black one and it looks great.  I posted this before and I believe someone found it somewhere cheaper but for that price I trust Amazon.  Also here I posted about some other accessories I recommend like a screen protector which you should really get.  The screen scratches easily.  Also the spare batteries which I got from Samsung but someone commented with a cheaper better deal.

If that's important, I would say go for it because the practical differences between the two versions are limited.   On a long enough timeline, being on an older version will limit the apps you can run. By that point, however, you're likely to have already changed phones."

The only problem I've had is the IPV6 WIFI bug, and that persisted from stock to my current 5.0.1 firmware.   If you really want to use your computer to backup and update, you can download Samsung Kies. http://www.samsung.com/us/kies/  You can use Kies to do a backup of all your files, factory reset, update the firmware (seems to be behind when an update comes out OTA) and restore your files. If you are using a Google Account for contacts, they should update automatically when you log back in with your Google Account.   I've only processed a wipe/restore once on my old GS4 and I don't remember if it saved all the passwords in addition to restoring my apps and contacts. For what it's worth, the Note4 does a pretty good job of populating accounts across apps. It's probably App specific and built into android, so not just a Samsung thing. In other words, you only have to log in once to a Google, Facebook, Yahoo or Samsung app once and it's pretty good about automatically logging into other apps from the same vendor. Comcast apps, not so much. I seem to have to log into every single video app that requires a Comcast subscription to stream video.

galaxynote4,3ao909,koolaidistheshit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:54:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure. If slomo is a huge deal breaker, then I'd just not hit the upgrade to Lollipop. I'm not sure if it makes you upgrade though.   I did find another camera ""Mode"" called Sequence Shot.  This only allows for a quick few seconds of capture, but the slow motion is buttery smooth how it used to be.  The resolution still sucks, and you need lots of light for it to be even remotely visable."

It's also about how good you optimize your software to run on your hardware. You might have the best hardware, but if you don't optimize your software there's no advantage. That's the thing with Apple, their devices are very smooth because of the software."
galaxynote4,3ao909,Bullet_King1996,11,Mon Jun 22 04:38:10 2015 UTC,"Isn't it more productive to think about what it's capable of, instead of admonishing it for being worse than something else? Are you genuinely expecting a Samsung engineer to come in and defend the camera when your post is written like trollbait?   But since I've been baited already, I'll respond. Look at cameras that support memory cards like the Hero 4 Black. It supports 720 @240 FPS, like the iPhone 6's camera. However, in order to reliably achieve these framerates, you need a memory card that supports such high write speeds, specifically a UHS 3 card. Since the iPhone can only record to built in flash memory, with a known write speed, they have no problems supporting such high bitrate video. But, when you can shove any memory card into a Galaxy, there's no telling exactly how many frames you can actually bang onto the card before something gets dropped.   Would it be better if the Note 4 supported 240 FPS? Of course. Might there have been a way of allowing those with fast enough memory cards to record high speed video? Possibly. Is this OP's post obnoxiously written? Decide for yourself."

A phone needs to be on par with its competitors, especially a phone produced by Samsung with the motto ""The Next Big Thing."" It is obviously hard to make that work, but with all the technology already put into the phone, why slack off with the cameras features? I mean, the phone is $700. Decent, competitive performance in its aspects should be a given. I'm sorry if my post came off as baiting to you, I'm just a little put out."

The constant crashes, weak battery life, no current or useful apps  and lack of support from BB really frustrated me.  The end came when I was stranded and the battery completely gave out after just a few hours of use.  I did a lot of research to find a suitable replacement, and decided on a Note 4 (the 200.00 rebate helped) .  I can honestly say I am thrilled with the Note 4. I do everything with it, and it never ceases to amaze, it's like having a laptop in your pocket! The note 4 will have no problem keeping up with heavy business demands, I promise you.  I know the BB passport looks sexy and all, but I would suggest you try a Note 4, you will be very impressed.   Good luck, LNYC"

All I know is that concerning productivity, nothing has beat the note 4.  There is no beating pulling the pen to take quick notes. Oh you need to give me your phone number, yeah here just write it down with your name (which you can then import into your contacts). Oh you have some new things you need me to do and you're telling me in person instead of an email? Let me jot that down. You needed something signed by me today and I'm not even in the office? I can do that.   As far as handling lots of emails... this isn't specific to the note, but Inbox has helped me a lot with that. Sometimes I miss having real keys to type with and the passport looks nice for that, but usually Swype works great (swiftkey is another solid choice). I get probably 20 emails a day that I have to deal with which isn't a lot compared to many people, so keep that in mind. It has also saved me more than once by automatically generating reminders based on email content without any interaction from me.  Concerning messaging, I get much more of those. Not sure what to say other than it covers all the ones you'd likely use. Also, some messengers allow for editing images within the app which makes for easy markups on some stuff for me.   Oh, it might seem like a small thing, but dear god I love having a fingerprint scanner. It's just fast and I miss it anytime I have to type in a password."

galaxynote4,3allgy,txvapers,14,Sun Jun 21 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"Strange. Lollipop very definitely made my phone faster. It was the first thing I noticed, the ""holy shit, it's almost up to the nexus 6"" moment.   Battery though. Damn. That was an issue and a half slowly fixing. As of this exact moment, I'm at 67% after 9 hours with 4.5 of SOT though. Though most of that was waking up too early and just reading on my Nook app with black background and Google Play Music running, no intensive gaming, so take it for what it is, but the issues can be fixed.   Now, if 5.1 gives me this kind of battery life without having VoLTE, Samsung push notices, security policy updates, Knox, all HAL related things, and Google Location History turned off or frozen, that would be something."
galaxynote4,3allgy,I_WantToBelieve,5,Sun Jun 21 15:26:58 2015 UTC,I have yet to encounter any major issues since lollipop. Only major thing is I occasionally miss notifications but that's it. Battery life has improved significantly for me.
galaxynote4,3allgy,txvapers,6,Sun Jun 21 18:00:25 2015 UTC,Literally the only difference I noticed since switching is that my phone is a lot more responsive/snappy than on Kitkat. Battery life and everything else stayed the same. I am one of the lucky guys fortunately.

Everything is so sluggish now. I can't believe a phone can go from so good to so bad from Android updates. Battery life is just as bad as before as well.
galaxynote4,3allgy,waaarg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"Try at least these 3 ""fixes."" Go to settings - applications - application manager - all - unified daemon. Uninstal updates and disable the app. Depending on your carrier, find VoLTE or ""enhanced calling"" and (on my T-mobile version settings - applications - call - VoLTE settings)  turn it off. Last of all, unless you need it, settings - connections - location - Google Location History, and turn it off. Each of those things seems worth at least an hour of SOT.  Let alone stand-by. If I put it in power saving mode and and restrict background data, turn off location and  sync, it will only use around 1% battery every 3 or 4 hours of no use. From there, I just turn on what I need when I need it.   Best of luck, hope something helps!   Edit: right now, slow day, mostly reading (good book) and on reddit, I'm now at 7:11 of SOT and down to 36% battery. That's crazy. Yes, I'm bragging. And no, if you need email sync on or Google Location History telling you traffic reports and where you parked, it won't be that good - but I've definitely figured out some of the battery issues."
galaxynote4,3allgy,Hailbacchus,6,Sun Jun 21 19:41:20 2015 UTC,"So, basically, turn off all of the reasons I have a smartphone in the first place and then it will work great?"
galaxynote4,3allgy,neva5eez,2,Sun Jun 21 22:25:11 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you need. Do you need the traffic reports, the always on email connection, constant checking of Samsung security updates, etc? Then, turning off VoLTE and unified daemon, 2 known common battery drainers, still won't affect you and may get a couple hours improvement anyway.   If you're like me and don't need to drive far for work, and use this phone more for office, note taking, and PDF scanning, can get away with manually checking email a couple times a day, and mostly need always available texting, phone, and Internet services, you can eek out an amazing amount of longevity out of this device. And it's not like I can't pull down one screen and turn back on location for GPS needs. There's a lot of versatility here if one needs it."

I did a clean install of Lollipop, rooted/debloated, and I get the same battery life as KK, but I feel apps load noticeably slower. It's not slow by any means, but it is slower.  Basically, all the actual features you get from Lollipop can be had on KK with third party apps, and are usually better. Example: KitKat with Floatify for heads-up notifications - Far superior to Lollipop's stock notification handling.  I essentially feel that Lollipop is nothing more than a visual upgrade for Samsung devices, and since I don't care about things looking pretty, I care more about them working quickly and having the customization I need, I have a way better experience with KK."

Urban armour gear cases ,for example, are high quality protective cases but are not bulky at all. The case is very thin, much thinner than an otter box whilst being very protective. The case comes in white, slate gray, orange, black, and clear. I own the white and it's a very nice case.  http://www.urbanarmorgear.com/collections/all#galaxy-note-4"

The top flips open and the phone drops down in the case, and if you have a screen protector on your phone, it's quite a tight fit.  If the paint on your phone has a small chip in it, I can see the case maybe expanding the paint loss because of how tight it is.  I kept the case, but mainly for the novelty.  It looks awesome, and it definitely feels like it can take some punishment, but it may be a bit inconvenient for daily use due to the door on it.  Hope I've helped!"

galaxynote4,3akj31,Endangered_Feces84,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, it's super thin. As someone who hates using a bulky case, but also hates carrying a naked phone, the samsung protective cover achieves a happy medium. It gets rid of the sharp edges that a naked Note has, yet adds a lip on the front so you can lay it face down without the glass touching whatever surface the phone is on, along with a slight lip on the back so the camera doesn't protrude.   I've tried three cases, the Spigen Neo Hybrid, Incipio DualPro, and the Samsung protective cover. I didn't use the first and second one for more than a week as my ""daily driver"", and I've been using the protective cover for over two months.   However, the DualPro is still in my rotation. I use it when I need a bit more protection, as the Samsung protective cover doesn't appear to be helpful in the event of a drop. For example, I'll be on an extensive camping trip starting next week, and you better believe I'll be rocking the Dualpro for the entirety of the trip. With being outdoors, I'm not about to risk carrying my note in a thin case.   I would recommend the Samsung cover to anyone with a Note, no questions asked. I would only recommend the Incipio to those needing a bit more protection."

I am from Germany and we only have 1 version:D   But in all honesty, what will make a huge difference are the waklocks. You only have to install Amplify and start it once, it will configure at least the 2 wakelocks, which will draw the most battery life alone and will give you a good kick to your battery. Kernel tweaking will ofc help a great deal but isn't necessary if you just want a decent battery life which gets you over the day (instead of almost lasting 4 days in standby, like my Note Edge does now)  But I ofc understand it if it's too much work for you, just remember that it is a possibilty:)"

galaxynote4,3ak70a,Waibashi,3,Sun Jun 21 07:22:25 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more with this statement.  Before you guys start the pitchforks against Samsung, please keep in mind that this doesn't happen because of poor quality, rather because of multiple reasons that interfere with a consistent operation of it.  For instance, I have the WeatherBug app.  It refreshes the location every ten minutes I think.  The skips used to piss me off, until I realized that the location would change and it would directly correspond with the skip. There are other things that happen when using Bluetooth, but ultimately Bluetooth is an imperfect transmission method for the moment."

galaxynote4,3ajid4,Intermeadiate,-3,Sat Jun 20 21:37:58 2015 UTC,I just would like to record videos in HD with smooth motion. It's a feature I use frequently. So if porting the camera app works would recording in 60fps work as well?
galaxynote4,3ajid4,Intermeadiate,2,Sat Jun 20 22:09:44 2015 UTC,Probably not. I would think I a lot of things would be broken if it was ported. It's just something you have to live with on cm. If you want a good camera and spen features then go touchwiz. If you don't care about shit and just want a buttery smooth experience that kills your battery life go cm. You can try different camera apps but they're all gonna produce the same quality images an may or may not have 60fps video
galaxynote4,3ajid4,PDXMatthew,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:04:13 2015 UTC,The best camera I found was Camera ZOOM Premium and it still couldn't produce the detail of the stock camera. I've tried to like CM I just can't handle the camera.

galaxynote4,3ajid4,Intermeadiate,2,Sat Jun 20 23:08:58 2015 UTC,Why would it be actively being worked on if the devs know it won't work because of it being built around the framework not just an app? They know it won't work lol
galaxynote4,3ajid4,PDXMatthew,-1,Sat Jun 20 23:26:12 2015 UTC,Well if it's around the framework can't they just work on their own framework for a different camera with the same features or close to the same features on the galaxy note 4 stock?
galaxynote4,3ajid4,Nineset,2,Sun Jun 21 01:51:01 2015 UTC,"No because it would have to be integrated into the rom.

You know when it's really overcast or you're in a parking garage and it's like the GPS doesn't have a ""smooth"" update rate or whatever you wanna call it...that's how my note 4 is all the time.

I've had issues where just being on Wifi drains the battery because it has to wake up every time it receives anything form the network, and even if your network isn't very busy, it can be enough to burn through your battery by keeping your phone awake."
galaxynote4,3af2gw,yeahbuddy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:37:16 2015 UTC,"Let me sure I get this straight. You got around 6 hours of mixed standby/screen-on time and lost 33% of your battery, so you're good for 18 hours, at which point you'd go to sleep for 8 hours. You perfectly make it through the day without having to use battery saving modes. Personally I'd be happy with this situation but even if I wasn't, what is your complaint?  Now, this is an Android phone so lets call ""Android System"" and ""Kernel"" both ""the phone"". The phone used up most of the battery since its powering the WiFi, 4G, loudspeaker, microphone, GPS and display. The heavy lifting is all done by the phone.  Apps at that point only need to request pictures and text from servers (FB), same for Google Play plus downloading and updating apps etc.  So what would you really want? What'd be your ideal situation here?"

galaxynote4,3aeb1v,whythehellknot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:30:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I've seen what I was doing wrong. When I went to annotate I used the screen write option from the S Pen menu rather than the annotate option at the top of the page.   I'm still having trouble importing a PDF file that I converted from a spreadsheet in Google Drive. It's opening fine in every app but when I try to import I get a message saying 'import failed.'

Just load the PDF up in Acrobat (which I keep as my default PDF reader in any event) and select the cartoon bubble/pen icon. There are then options for using the S Pen to write on the document with different thicknesses, colors, and degrees of opacity, along with options for highlighting, underscoring, and striking out."""

This is also a temporary root method though (lose root on hard reboot/over a few hours, and use Simple Reboot app if reboot is required), but works well so far if you just need to freeze/unbloat, use AdAway, install Xposed, etc.   The page lists this for the AT&T and Verizon models, but I am using the T-Mobile model (N910T) and can confirm that it works!"
galaxynote4,3afefj,MiniMoose12,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:45:21 2015 UTC,The root for the s6 uses is called ping pong. It is through a 64bit exploit.  Therefore incompatible with the 32 bit note 4.

I had the s4 and when at&twat removed the toggle on one of the smallest updates in the history of owning the phone, I was about to flip shit and change carriers. I'm a student on a small data plan and I have WiFi practically everywhere. My house, school, outside my school thanks to twc, & basically everywhere. I toggle data off when I switch to WiFi because it helps me not accidentally disconnect from WiFi and chew up my small data plan. Then this shitty update came around. Literally 4 touches just to toggle it once. Everytime you want to go watch a Netflix movie or YouTube video I had to press 4 times. Thanks jesus for the application powertoggles but still. This is total bullshit. Removing a feature on a phones' operating system because you think people will use their data more to make more money? I don't know what att's motive was but it didn't fully lose my business. I just don't buy my phones from them. Sadly they pretty much have a monopoly in the sfv Los Angeles area. Version and t mobile have shit signal and better prices. At&twat has the good signal and shit prices. Good thing by the end of this the Samsung keyboard has learned that att is at&twat."

galaxynote4,3acwpw,jaydotzee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:48:50 2015 UTC,I know about temp root but it doesn't seem like it's going to help get full root. Temp root isn't even that helpful because it's lost whenever an app that requires root tries to write to the system partition.

galaxynote4,3acwpw,Dunsparced,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:15:37 2015 UTC,Nova Launcher let's you choose how many icons you want on the dock. From there you just put four apps in one icon space which makes them appear like in that pic/gif.  You tap the area and they expand slightly above where you tapped. Super fluid and keeps everything I use the most in one place. I love my layout like this.

I can describe what I like most ;-)  It's very fast and light for RAM, don't drain battery  You can setup gestures one figer and also multiple fingers. It really helps to use phone in one hand. Left swipe for sidebar, swipe down notification. You can setup your own, I use default.  You can use sidebar app drawer or classic app drawer. I prefer sidebar, it's for me more synoptic. Also I can find app very fast.  Main thing what I love - you can have folders, but that sucks when  some apps you don't use so often and it's not handy to open folder and choose that one app you use more than others. Solution? Cover! It looks like just app icon, if you single tap (open) it's just like normal app icon. However you can double tap/slide up to open folder and choose any other app.  Short showdown (my upload)  Also this review of older version is great.  I used Action Launcher 2 Pro and v3 is just awesome for me :-)"

Creates less clutter on your home page as you can acess a quick app drawer by swiping from left of screen and another quick page for widgets or apps from right side.

Once it drained I let it charge over night to 100% (while off) then I turned it on, following that I did the same thing again. By the 4-6th day the battery was give or take calibrated.

galaxynote4,3a8l6n,Cassiuz,2,Thu Jun 18 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"The S6 has faster hardware than the Note 4, and more optimised software.  The version of TW on the S6 is much less demanding (likely through better coding optimisations) than the version on the Note 4. So it's a bit of a combination of both. However, the Note 4 could easily be as fast as the S6 (in general interface speed) if it was updated to the same version of TW as the S6. Whether or not Samsung will do that remains to be seen."
galaxynote4,3a8l6n,BigPoopBreakfast,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:19:28 2015 UTC,"Well, the  S6 does have faster hardware, but plenty of devices that are considerably less powerful than the Note 4 don't have the lag issues that we have, so the problem is definitely software, not hardware. I suppose that leaves open the option that the S6 is the first device with the raw horsepower to run Samsung's inefficient code without lag, but it seems more likely that there were major improvements made to the software.  Even with that being the case, the S6 runs on a Samsung SoC, rather than the Qualcomm one in the Note 4, so any really low level optimization is likely not portable.  I guess we will just have to find out when the 5.1.1 update rolls out."

Even more importantly, do not do this if you have another launcher and froze or removed all the TW ones. You will find yourself doing an unexpected factory reset should this happen."

Had no way to access settings and turn ultra power saving / emergency mode off, even. Can't remember what screen I was trapped on, but essentially, yes.

galaxynote4,3a535e,wontimeicountedtwoat,9,Wed Jun 17 13:00:37 2015 UTC,"its because of the code it changes within the system processes or configuration files to allow itself.  Even if you remove the app, the separate code is there there able to be accessed.    Now if the carriers didn't lock people's bootloaders down, everyone would have had a custom recovery installed and flashed a clean rom by now.  But once again all this hold handing the carriers do to ""protect users"" has actually put them at greater risk.     And because the carriers have a real dick up their ass about letting manufacturers keep their devices up to date, a patch to fix it is just kicking it on the shelf at samsung.  Meanwhile the carrier just lets all their users phones shit the bed.     We need the FTC to step in and say enough is enough.  Get the carrier out of the way.  All it needs to do is connect my call.  There is NOTHING about the software on the phone that will fuck that up.  The ONLY approval they should have over updates is when the update is to the radio.  But what's funny is, they don't even need to do that because unlocked users flash those all the time with no problems.    There has not been a single case of modified phone software harming the network.  On the other hand, there seems be a shitload of locked down phones harming users going on."

The international carrier free phones did not come with swiftkey.  Only samsung and google. (my 910c only came w/samsung)  swiftkey is different.  Swiftkey made a special bloatware version specifically for carrier model samsung phones.   This bloatware ended up being a bloated sack of ever expanding shitdemon.   People, If you're on a carrier phone, and you were required to get it contracted to afford it... STOP DOING THAT!  Buy the unlocked versions only. Better to put it on a credit card and pay it down over 3 or 4 months than to get locked into a 2 year aggreement and no control over your own shit.    Don't let the carriers do this shit anymore.  People don't want bloatware for a good fucking reason and this is the biggest fucking one."

All you get is a 2 year pain in the ass agreement that you can never be free from if you want to afford the upgrade.    just buy the unlocked version on a credit card and pay it down in 4 months.   If you STILL can't afford it, then you should be doing something with your money other than buying a premium phone.    There's a lot of places selling unlocked devices that offer financing too."
galaxynote4,3a535e,diversionmary,2,Wed Jun 17 14:13:53 2015 UTC,"Whether I can afford a $900 phone or not, that seems a bit extravagant. I bet our relationship with phones would change significantly if we actually had to pay how much they cost.  I upgraded from my note 4 last weekend. My NPP membership knocked an additional $150 off retail. There was also a $200 off promotion via Verizon. I ended up giving the note 4 to one of my users that killed his phone, but if I had sold it secondary I would have made money on the deal."
galaxynote4,3a535e,wontimeicountedtwoat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:08:34 2015 UTC,Why would it change.  I stopped doing the subsidized thing with phones 2 years ago after reading a similar post.      I SAVED MONEY.   That means i've been able to upgrade more often whilst my income actually went down.
galaxynote4,3a535e,diversionmary,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:04:03 2015 UTC,Are you in the states? In the states cell phone plans cost the same whether you bring your own phone or subsidize.
galaxynote4,3a535e,wontimeicountedtwoat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"True.  But the LOSS occurs from being locked into 2 year agreements and not being able to shift carriers as desired to take advantage of promotions.    Also, the alternatives to subsidized (like edge) come with a huge hidden interest cost where the user pays MORE for the phone than it's regular cost than they would if they just utilized the interest rate on a credit card.   (not to mention the payment flexibility)  And then there is the added loss of dealing with problems caused by purchasing a locked down device that has bloatware on it and you're stuck with a broken device.  Sometimes the bloatware causes such huge problems with battery life the phone has to be replaced.   Again... time lost and time is money.    If you are unable to afford a phone without selling your soul to a phone company for 2 years (or paying HUGE early upgrade fees) then you should not be purchasing a premium phone.     The subsidized phones do two things.  Make 3rd parties free money and imprison customers to their carrier.   That's it.  (3 things if you count not being able to be fixed at home)   Its much cheaper to buy it through credit card.  And also many non carrier phone dealers will have payment plans on premium unlocked phones.  Many of these dealers will forgive credit problems with a small downpayment.  Also, waiting to buy 4 or 5 months after release is a good way to get refurbished phones that are in brand new condition for a fraction of the cost."
galaxynote4,3a535e,the_real_seldom_seen,0,Thu Jun 18 00:12:58 2015 UTC,"your argument (and others' about subsidized phones not being free) has a critical flaw.  Whether you get a subsidized phone or purchase it at the full price, you are still paying the same monthly fee.  In fact, you are paying less overall with a subsidized phone + 2 years of service vs paying full price + 2 years of service."
galaxynote4,3a535e,wontimeicountedtwoat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:55:56 2015 UTC,"You're not buying a 2 year agreement when you buy a non carrier phone.     And you don't have bloatware.    You know why bloatware companies pay to reduce the cost of the phone?   It doesn't matter if you don't use their software.  They still make profit off the data the software on the phone is allowed to acccess.    So no...it's not FREE.  They FORCE you to give them something.   And you don't even get a device you fully control in exchange or the freedom to change carriers with that phone once you're agreement is done.   So you don't own it.... you paid verizon to own your phone for you and tell you what you can and cannot do with it. And in this case... the carriers are telling people that their devices must not be secure.   That's a big fucking expensive problem.  The money you save from not being locked into a contract alone is enough to cover the subsidized nonsense.   Before I quit that I couldn't get new phones.  Now, I pay my full price phones down in 6 to 8 months (sometimes less) and get an upgrade.   And my monthly bills for phone service have been about half on account of the buying power I gained from freedom."

If i loose my current phone, I then buy a phone from Sprint at full price, it will have the same sprint bloat ware.  What savings do you achieve by not being tied to a contract? Your monthly service fee is the same as someone under contract"
galaxynote4,3a535e,wontimeicountedtwoat,2,Thu Jun 18 23:09:38 2015 UTC,You don't buy the carrier phone.   You buy the unlocked models sold by third parties or Samsung itself.    There is no bloatware on these devices.

You pay higher price up front, and then pay the equivalent month to month service fee.  Sure you can potentially get slightly better deal switching from carrier to carrier, but they are all rather equivalently priced..."
galaxynote4,3a535e,wontimeicountedtwoat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"The locked down devices prevent you from continuing to use your device on a new carrier.  So even once your agreement is done, the carrier still controls your phone.  So you paid money for something you don't fully own.  If you bought the non carrier unlocked model...you could still enjoy your device.   Many of the non carrier models have a wider range of bands they can use as well."

Someone will always have an issue, just hope it's not you. Now, the update has increased battery life for a majority of users, and I would suggest you do it, but please backup and factory reset after. Literally all these issues people have been having have been fixed by a simple restore. Back your shit up, and do it. Don't like it? Odin flash it back to 4.4.4. Sam mobile has all the stock software, just find one on the same model that is still running on 4.4.4 and download the odin file, their site tells you the rest. Personally I think the update was great, they just needed to polish a few things here and there. Make it an all around more consistent experience.   Tl:dr?

galaxynote4,3a46vz,Intermeadiate,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:09:55 2015 UTC,what does the gs6 mod do exactly?
galaxynote4,3a46vz,PDXMatthew,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:13:47 2015 UTC,It stops issue where apps are killed super fast. Aka the opposite of a memory leak where the multitasking is super aggressive and kills background apps really fast. It makes the os as a whole feel a lot smoother and somewhat helps the multitask button lag less
galaxynote4,3a46vz,Intermeadiate,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:39:50 2015 UTC,Is that s6 mod in the system folder to flash or is there somewhere else to download it? Or do you just manually change the build.prop?
galaxynote4,3a46vz,PDXMatthew,2,Wed Jun 17 05:20:13 2015 UTC,"Just manually change it. Someone put a guide somewhere in this sub,  just do a search for it I'm sure it'll show up.

galaxynote4,3a2ebb,Pockets6794,14,Tue Jun 16 18:16:54 2015 UTC,The multitasking lag can be minimized a bit by going to your settings -> applications manager -> disabling the Talkback app -> reboot. It'll still lag the first time you press the multitasking button but subsequent times should load much faster.
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,starplaya,6,Wed Jun 17 01:15:10 2015 UTC,I've always had it off or disabled and its never made a noticeable difference for me.

galaxynote4,3a2ebb,baldheadslick,7,Thu Jun 18 01:14:32 2015 UTC,"yup. it actually boggles my mind that this is a thing. i came from an iPhone 6 and was used to a buttery smooth experience all around. i was tempted by the ""you can customize anything with android"" rhetoric. i did my research and in october of 14 the note 4 was the best flagship android device out there. fuck that. and this whole sub is all ""oooh, look at this picture i took"" while pressing the gallery app button from the camera lags just as hard as the recent apps one. ""oh lollipop will fix all of it with ART"". NOT. should have gotten the nexus 6 instead, but if you looked at the sub for that in october you would have seen a hot mess as well. NEVER buying another samsung device again."
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,Mindcoitus,3,Wed Jun 17 00:56:39 2015 UTC,"It should have been fixed before the phone was released. With that said, if you want the Nexus 6 without getting the Nexus 6, try flashing an AOSP rom."

galaxynote4,3a2ebb,Mindcoitus,0,Wed Jun 17 01:11:35 2015 UTC,"Right, too bad. Regarding your last sentence, that's what I meant, it should have never been released like this to begin with."
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,greenshrubbery,-2,Wed Jun 17 01:22:54 2015 UTC,That's just how phones work. iPhones are shit without jailbreaking and Android is shit without rooting and flashing.
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,sleepyCOLLEGEstudent,3,Wed Jun 17 15:43:47 2015 UTC,"Well the Nexus 6 does not have nearly as good battery life. I've had N4, N5, and my friend has the N6. I loved the buttery smoothness that pure android brought to the table which is why I loved nexus devices so much, but a huge downfall was their battery life. Also, while some SGN4 users may be experiencing issues, that doesn't account for everyone. Such as myself. I don't complain about my battery life because I keep it on full brightness and I'm signed into many accounts. On top of that, I use the hell out if my phone. It rarely gets laggy, and is very smooth for me.   However, I do agree much of this sub is about pictures, and posts about people complaining about the issues with their phone (and they do have a right because it's $700). Anyways, it all depends what you like, I prefer android and do customize the hell out of my phone. So, I'm sorry if you're experiencing issues with your phone, but this is a huge upgrade compared to the Nexus devices IMO."
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,baldheadslick,2,Wed Jun 17 01:21:19 2015 UTC,"to me, that is part of the issue. there are like ten fucking variants of the phone. just because my att note 4 does some dome dumb shit does not mean that the exinos version does and visa versa. will i see the 5.1.1 update before the year is out? who knows. it seems like all sammy and the carriers care about is the S6 at the moment. how am i getting left in the dust with such a new phone? i actually love android now. but, android has nothing to do with my anger."
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,sleepyCOLLEGEstudent,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:27:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, well in that case, yes it is fucking annoying. But it's what to expect with just about any Samsung phone. Even other brand of phones. Nexus is just about the only thing that'll get updated."
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,baldheadslick,2,Wed Jun 17 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"The thing with Samsung is they make great hardware but terrible software. Samsung users have almost always had to trade off. I was choosing between the Note 4 and Nexus 6 and it was the multitasking features, external SD and removable battery that swayed me towards the Note initially .   I recently got a Nexus 6 and although it's incredibly smooth now it has no features that make use of the huge screen. I actually miss being able to open two apps side by side and make notes with the stylus."
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,lego_hobbit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:40:58 2015 UTC,I am not sure what the deal was with them not offering expandable storage on the n6. Why make the only stock android device so limited? I am actually leaning toward the g4 at this point.
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,paultower,3,Wed Jun 17 09:07:22 2015 UTC,"It seems the issue is still prevalent even in the S6, so it's down to Touchwiz really."
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,neva5eez,2,Tue Jun 16 19:29:50 2015 UTC,It's lollipop's memory management issue. Should be fixed by 5.1

galaxynote4,3a2ebb,paultower,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:27:43 2015 UTC,I don't think it is a lollipop issue. I come from a Nexus 4 with 2GB ram on lollipop and the multitasking was pretty instant.   And on the note 4 I use pie control and the on-screen muti tasking button functionality is as smooth as butter.  It is really to do with touchwiz processing a touch on the capacitive button. Don't think even the capacitive button can be the root cause.

galaxynote4,3a2ebb,isaychris,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"I've been reading, apparently there is a bug in Android that allows apps to stay open in the background for far longer than necessary, so Samsung added code to fix the bug, but apparently, went in the complete opposite direction and things shut down immediately. So there is a fix out there (mostly for the S6 but supposedly works on the Note 4 also) that will put this back to a normal state, and apparently it also fixes pretty much every problem on this phone including this recent apps lag. I'm thinking just about everything has to be constantly loaded on our phones which is why everything is so lagtastic.  http://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-s6-and-s6-edge-memory-bug/  Unfortunately I have not had a chance to root my phone otherwise I would have given it a try."

galaxynote4,3a2ebb,Mindcoitus,5,Tue Jun 16 21:58:49 2015 UTC,You can't replace Touchwiz. It is not just a launcher. Removing or disabling it will break your phone. I tried one time and systemui didn't work at all. So it is always working in the background. Even if you have a 3rd party launcher.
galaxynote4,3a2ebb,mastersyrron,2,Tue Jun 16 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"Touchwiz is the actual ROM, the operating system which is a modified version of android. An operating system just like Windows or OSX for your computer. Changing the launcher is like downloading an alternate web browser, the launcher is literally just an application set as the standard action when you press the home button. To change touchwiz, you need to flash, or 'install' if you will, another customised version of android, another ROM. Thanks for reading! Random android guy out!"

galaxynote4,3a0q5o,reddit_indian,10,Tue Jun 16 09:08:23 2015 UTC,"Screen on time http://i.imgur.com/Z2lAtmB.png  I must say this is the best I have seen from my device. It was not bad before the last update and I was getting around 4.5-5 hrs screen time. But after the update I had a feeling that consistently I was getting more juice out of the battery. So I let it drop till last 1% and took these screenshots. Must say even though the OS says 16 mins more left the phone switched off soon after I took these screen shots with less than 1% remaining. My phone is unrooted and running stock. As you can see the biggest battery hog is Android system after the screen with various bloatware by Samsung. I am not sure if disabling most of them with debloater could extend my battery life by a few more mins. But coming from a nexus 4 recently, am more than satisfied with this battery life, the super fast charging and cool performance of this device."
galaxynote4,3a0q5o,jarkarawr,2,Tue Jun 16 09:18:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't gotten an update, but I'm perfectly happy with my phone. Like you I came from a Nexus 4 like a month ago or so and it's been great so far. Don't have to worry about trying to find the best rom/kernel to get the most out of the phone. Great camera, much better battery life, plus the ability to swap in a new battery if I need to is awesome."
galaxynote4,3a0q5o,jarkarawr,2,Tue Jun 16 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. With this Note 4, I am in no mood to even root it, let alone install custom roms  and kernels which I was doing like crazy on my Nexus 4.  I am mighty satisfied with this device. The most important features for me - battery life, display and camera are all excellent."
galaxynote4,3a0q5o,MongolianTrojanHorse,2,Wed Jun 17 03:46:22 2015 UTC,"I'd root it if I could just for ad blocker, but yeah totally satisfied. I get about the same battery life as you. Pretty much don't have to worry about how I use my phone anymore unlike with the Nexus 4. With that I always had to decide if I really wanted to play a game since it was such a drain on the battery. Now it doesn't matter cause the Note actually lasts all day and even if I hammer it all day it will charge quickly or I can swap out the battery. Definitely was worth every penny I paid for it."

galaxynote4,3a0q5o,waaarg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:21:47 2015 UTC,Yes the latest OTA about a week ago has helped.  Sometimes it would go on a almost zero drain run when idle.   But my experience is it's inconsistent certain days it would act like usual lollipop with crazy drains but at least now it's mixed with days with excellent standby times.
galaxynote4,3a1cxi,ghostfacezabuza,2,Tue Jun 16 13:40:06 2015 UTC,I had a similar issue once. I just made sure the USB cord was plugged into the charger correctly and changed outlets. Everything worked fine after that. Good luck OP.

galaxynote4,3a2klj,plambos,2,Tue Jun 16 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"This is because your Note is running lollipop and your tab is running KitKat.  When Android made the jump to lollipop it transitioned from Dalvik to ART - it's basically a new engine for running apps.  When you install an app on ART it pre-compiles, which is new - the idea with pre-compiling is that your apps launch faster and run with lower CPU utilization, giving you better performance.    So basically your phone is doing a little more work during the installation, which takes longer, so that later on when you use the app it requires less work/is faster/less taxing on the processor.    Hope that helps."

galaxynote4,3a2802,FFFUUUme,2,Tue Jun 16 17:33:22 2015 UTC,No. The SIM unlock just means you can use another carriers SIM and service. It doesn't change the phones basic software.
galaxynote4,3a2802,PDXMatthew,2,Tue Jun 16 17:42:34 2015 UTC,This. I wish this was like on a card with every phone sold carrier exclusive. So many ignorant people rushing out to unlock their phone thinking it enables root lol.

galaxynote4,3a25kc,kaminariko,2,Tue Jun 16 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"I always buy hybrid cases, but there are two major things that are dealbreakers for me.   I know the review pointed out the textured back piece, but I couldn't tell what the actual material was.  I want a soft back piece that is extra grippy like rubber rather than harder plastic, regardless of the texture, because I keep my phone in my shirt pocket. I know it makes me look like a dork because the Galaxy 4 is a big phone, and the weight and length of the phone can be an issue in a shirt pocket. If it has the harder, slick plastic, the phone can fall right out of my pocket even if I only partially bend over. I know this is my own personal problem, and I should probably just put the phone in a pants pocket, but I carry keys and microtools there along with change and so on. Forget about putting it in my back pocket like my wife does. That's an accident waiting to happen.   The other thing that's always important to me is whether my wireless, inductive charger will make a connection through the case, or will I have to remove the case to charge the phone on the inductive surface.  Just some thoughts...otherwise, it seemed like a good review."
galaxynote4,3a25kc,Jason6677,2,Tue Jun 16 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"The back is definitely grippy. It is more rubber soft plastic than anything.       Im afraid that I cant answer the question on the Qi charging as I dont have the compatible rear cover for it.       Also, thanks for your feedback :D"

That being said, I have owned and 'supported' several android devices and the Note 4 is tied for second in terms of my happiness using it in its relevant window. My American T-Mobile Note 4 is running the Rooted Canadian T-Mobile Note 4 ROM (which changes the model number from version T to W8...)  The killer feature that other phones have but has been disappointing-- compared to every other Android device I have used, the camera is fantastic quality and the voice commands. My favorite camera feature is that it takes a picture a second or two after it hears someone say something resembling 'cheese'. No more timer shots for me!  The Infra-Red emitter is great for controlling both my TVs (at home, work, whereever) and Roku 3 from a single app. I bet it would control things like the fans & one standalone air conditioner, only ever want to turn those off.

galaxynote4,39wncr,puppibreath,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:56:11 2015 UTC,You can either turn on auto back up in accounts under google and have your phone just back up all your stuff for you. Or you can do it by hand to make sure you get what you want off your phone (I do it this way) you can export your contacts to a file and upload that to google drive. And take your photo's videos and other important files and documents and also upload that to google drive. If you have a gmail account set up with google (you should already if you're using an android phone) then downloading the google drive app is all you need to do. It sets itself up instantly if it sees a gmail account. Once you factory reset you install the drive app again.. sign in with your same gmail account. And bam.. all your stuff is there available to download again (or to just sit there in the drive. Its cloud storage its fine there if you please)

I also had google maps going the entire time (I like to see how far along/how much time till I get to my destination). Google maps satellite view used 2x the amount of data as all 3 of my combined!

God I hate Sprint so much, their ideal tactic was telling me it was the battery's fault, which they replaced. Came back, oh no, must be a factory reset, etc etc. I had to go in four times before they would order me a replacement!   Likewise, I received my replacement, it ended up being some hardware error, glad I got my replacement, everything is back to normal!"

galaxynote4,39uykj,Alan157,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:26:54 2015 UTC,It doesn't seem loke absolute zero... The graph is not straight. And you probably set it to airplane mode.
galaxynote4,39uykj,LeeyFox,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:40:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah there was some drain as its not magic. But no it wasn't in airplane mode or even power saving. It was on WiFi all night long with mobile data and location off.  I simply used package disabler app that allows you to disable any app. I did the usual disable of bloat plus Knox.  My phone isn't crippled in anyway, I still have Google now, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard , Dropbox etc.  As you can expect I  very happy."

galaxynote4,39rqx4,DrPathetic,3,Mon Jun 15 06:53:03 2015 UTC,"I have had lollipop for a while now and my fast charging hasn't been affected at all. Also the fast charging option gets greyed out when plugged in anyway, you enable/disable it when there's no plug in it, if you get the notification it should be fine. Also doesn't work in power saving mode as far as I know.  Source it still works: me who just charged my phone up. I'd show screenshot but my power menu only shows discharge from 100% for after the charge so that's no use A factory reset could fix the issue contrary to what is said above as it fixed lags and other issues after update."
galaxynote4,39rqx4,wontimeicountedtwoat,0,Sun Jun 14 03:10:19 2015 UTC,I don't get the notification that it's fast charging. i did at one point...
galaxynote4,39rqx4,PDXMatthew,5,Sun Jun 14 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"You're right.    Its just easily solved by factory wiping after getting the update.... which you should do for battery and lag issues anyway.....   My fast charging works great.  Every time.   You just can't turn it off or on whilst using it, without unplugging first.  But a timer shows it is still charging just as fast.     Don't really know why anyone downvoted you.  What you said is true.... it just has an easy fix (for most people).  I'll get my buddies to upvote you.  What you said here is correct."
galaxynote4,39rqx4,gthing,2,Sun Jun 14 05:14:12 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/kevinstonge, thanks for the quick response. I will try charging with the phone off and report back. I really hope this is something that'll be fixed. It was one of my favorite bragging points about the Note4.  Edit: I really don't know why people are downvoting. Is this not a legitimate concern and there are only a few people with this problem?  Edit 2: I don't think it's charging much faster with the phone off... will try additional tests tonight."

galaxynote4,39rbr9,raymondhu,3,Sun Jun 14 00:15:48 2015 UTC,The easiest way is the TWRP method IMO. Look up galaxynote4root.com and go to the cwm/twrp root page. It's very detailed and only takes like 5 minutes.
galaxynote4,39rbr9,itzST,3,Sun Jun 14 01:11:21 2015 UTC,"My husband just helped me root a Nexus 7 2012 tablet last night. It was painful. He had to keep repeating steps because they did not work. And cyanogen never would load. He ended up just installing Android 4.4.4. It has made me afraid to try rooting my Note 4. You make it sound like it's a breeze. Is it really going to be so fast and easy? Because that is what everyone said about rooting the Nexus, too."
galaxynote4,39rbr9,psiin,5,Sun Jun 14 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"Samsung support for rooting is amazingly easy. I've rooted a few phones in my time and fuck me.... Samsung are as easy as googling cf autoroot, hit ctrl f, type model number in. Download it, and unzip. unlock developer options, turn on USB debugging on device. Shut phone off, hold volume down power and home button, when it boots click volume up to set it to download mode. Plug into computer, Open Odin from zip click ""pda""  (depending on software version) and pick the other file in the zip and click start. 10 mins later your phone is ready to roll."

galaxynote4,39rbr9,Maddbammer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:49:49 2015 UTC,Goto sammobile and download the 4.4.4 rom. Then flash it in Odin and download the cf auto root and reroot.
galaxynote4,39rbr9,itzST,2,Mon Jun 15 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"Ya, with the nexus you had to use the cammandprompt and stuff which is confusing. However, samsung phones a windows application called odin that you press two buttons for it to automatically flash the custom recovery(i recommend TWRP). After that, you boot into the custom recovery and flash supersu, which gives you root. Its kinda surprising that samsung phones are easier to root than nexuses(nexi?)."
galaxynote4,39rbr9,dabdontjudge,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:54:04 2015 UTC,Any idea if that is confirmed to work for VZW Note 4?
galaxynote4,39rbr9,itzST,2,Sun Jun 14 04:40:48 2015 UTC,I don't believe so because vzw and at&t note 4s come with locked bootloaders. This means nothing can be flashed onto the device.
galaxynote4,39rbr9,Theshawty,2,Sun Jun 14 05:06:24 2015 UTC,Easiest way is CF autoroot with Odin.
galaxynote4,39qhbp,Theshawty,11,Sat Jun 13 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've experienced pretty much 0 lag besides the recent apps/camera-gallery. Starting to think that I got blessed by the Samsung gods when I got my Note 4...."

galaxynote4,39qhbp,MiniMoose12,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:15:16 2015 UTC,"Titanium is great for backups but I've never had luck freezing apps with it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes the app loads but reboot and it won't load, reboot again... it loads.  That tells me titanium has to freeze the app each time you start the phone and it isn't always successful in that operation.     So I said fuck it and just turn them off from androids native application manager."
galaxynote4,39qhbp,MiniMoose12,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:38:43 2015 UTC,"Dunno if I've ever had a problem with Titanium's freeze option. Then again, I've always been more inclined to either flash a debloated rom or remove the bloat myself altogether, up until now."

galaxynote4,39qhbp,wontimeicountedtwoat,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:14:40 2015 UTC,"It really is too bad you didn't get the Exynos.  I have both Exynos and Snapdragon (I do idiot grunt work for real developers),  The Exynos is way fucking better experience.     Snapdragon battery lasts about 2 hours longer. I wouldn't call it laggy so much as jittery.  But I'm just stock rooted on it like you.    I think your only way forward is going to be to flash a custom rom.  If it still is like that then there are scattered reports of some of the snapdragons having some RAM issues.   Unfortunately, a lot of people that rooted early on have tripped knox.   So you can't get it replaced.    If you manage to root without tripping knox (as I somehow did) then warranty that now.    If not and it so bad the phone is unusable, you're only choice will be to purchase some insurance (if you haven't already) and pay the deductable to replace it.    I would first test a custom rom before going the insurance route.... which I'm sure you'd do because of your high knowledge level.     Good luck to you.  It really is a sweet phone once it runs smooth.   Samsung is fucking retarded.  They should have let everyone cry about not having lollipop.  Then just delivered 5.1.1 while telling everyone to shut the fuck up because this phone deserves nothing less. TLDR: 5.0.1 is garbage and Samsung support is run by IDIOTS"
galaxynote4,39qhbp,wontimeicountedtwoat,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:31:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for your input. I bought this phone used and knoxed (knowing it was knoxed too). There's no way I would have (or could have) bought the exynos version as it's not on sale here in Sweden, nor did I want to pay full price for this phone either what with it being so expensive still.  I can get it replaced (or repaired) if I want had there been something to repair since in Sweden (and Europe) we have this statutory warranty that no one can ever deny for any apparent hardware fault.  5.0.1 is garbage on any phone, but little less so on Nexus phones."
galaxynote4,39q0cx,DrShekelMrHyde,3,Sat Jun 13 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"Ultimate Kernel v36 (I have Exynos). Well, best thing is that it fixed massive GPU throttling presented in Lollipop update (GPU quickly drops frequency from 700MHz to 350MHz and doesn't want to go back which results in massive game lags) but it also comes with many tweaks to play with. The ability to change the threshold required for big.LITTLE to swap between A53s and A57s is just awesome. I made my processor to work more on A53s which I overclocked up to 1.5GHz and I get no performance difference but more battery life (just hit 7.5h of SoT). For more performance I also overclocked A57s to 2.1GHz. Governor is bioshock. The kernel is just plain awesome and it works very well with SimplROM v3c."

The only problems I've ever come across were ones I've made for myself (with stupid tb deletes in the process of cutting down bloat) so I had to re-download stock and fixed all that. But like I said, no problems on my end from this device. :)"
galaxynote4,39r5v9,CYNiK_sXe,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:58:57 2015 UTC,For the heck of it you should buy the cheapest stock Android phone you can. A nexus 4 or even a moto G/E will give you a good idea of how smooth Android can be.

galaxynote4,39r5v9,deathdealer351,2,Wed Jun 24 23:31:55 2015 UTC,I can't imagine how fast the note 4 would be with CM 12. My galaxy S3 was really fast with CM. I would do it.
galaxynote4,39r5v9,Bullet_King1996,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:44:27 2015 UTC,do it...the phone is even better.
galaxynote4,39r5v9,peabody624,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:21:00 2015 UTC,"Don't flash it you'll end up going back to stock. It's fast with with CM12 but the camera quality is like an HTC One M9 had a baby with an M7. The other downside is that the Note 4 doesn't have great support so there's no stable builds. Eventually when you decide to sell it, the buyer or trade in party may not accept it because it's been rooted. If you sell it now you can get at least $318 from T-Mobile but if you wait until the Note 5 releases it'll be worth around $200 if you're lucky. LG is still offering the extra battery and SD card until the end of the month so that's another reason to sell now"

galaxynote4,39r5v9,PDXMatthew,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:11:56 2015 UTC,What about flashing firekat.  That's TouchWiz so the spen would work and the camera will be the same.  Also I think they included Wifi calling which is important if you need that on tmo

CM severely gimps the Note 4 and I'm lucky enough to not suffer from all this dreadful lag people talk about."
galaxynote4,39ppxa,TaikNaw,3,Sat Jun 13 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Cm12 is only for the snap-dragon models atm. I'm not sure which one the G is but I would check the specifications online and see actual forums before saying "" I want to get this, but this only works on that"". Cm12 for the Note gets rid of camera quality and spen usage and hits a little bit on the battery. Most roms are Touch Wiz (Modified Stock Roms). Aparently the cm12 for the Snapdragon varient is pretty polished, so I wouldn't say its unsafe for a daily driver, but the Dev one for the N910C has along way to go.  I use Xposed on my phone, there are loads of touchwiz modules (20-30+). It's pretty steady imo. I've used some cool ones like Remove Carrier Label, Advanced Power Menu, Youtube Ad away, etc. It's as stable as it's going to get.  Once knox is tripped, it's tripped. Say good bye to that warranty.   Yes you can ""unroot"" by flashing the official firmware from sammobile.com through odin. Your knox will be tripped, no point in doing so :P I'm not sure if your local store will care, but it is very easy for them to check knox if they wanted to. I know samsungs' warranty has saved allot of people from random and disfunct issues in the past. Personally I bought squaretrade insurance so the samsung warranty means shit to me. It's up to you m8  Keep in mind rooting unlocks allot of stuff that you can do just beyond flashing roms. You can make your phone feel buttery smooth with this fix , You can also install system-level apps to track your phone, aswell as FULL backups of your entire phone. I think if you have used your phone for a good month, and nothing is wrong with it, rooting should be step 2 for you. It's so much fun :P"
galaxynote4,39ppxa,MiniMoose12,2,Sat Jun 13 21:49:36 2015 UTC,"Hello, thanks for the reply! Appreciate it.   Yeah, the CM12 is working for my version of Note 4, SM-N910G (Snapdragon version). One of the main reason that I want to switch to CM12 is because the stock ROM is draining too much battery but seeing your comment, it is more draining on battery? The pity is really about the S-Pens functions, camera quality and multi-window capability.   Great to know that the Xposed modules are still working greatly!   I'm not sure whether my local store does check for KNOX but from what I know, they will usually take the phone away and do their internal diagnostic behind closed doors before giving any report on what's wrong. I guess they will check for KNOX there. I never use Samsung warranty before and hopefully not.   Lastly, thank you for all the advise and insights! Truly helpful."
galaxynote4,39ppxa,MiniMoose12,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that they will check for knox, but it is a possibility. Usually they will just check for cracks, dinks, visual damage etc. Making sure it's a real note 4 etc. From what I hear only samsung warranty cares about knox. Knox is only on samsung devices aswell, so your store guys might not even know about it depending on how experienced they are.   Uhh I haven't tried CM12 as far as battery drain is concerned. But from what I've seen and heard online it drains a tad bit faster than stock, but keep in mind the note 4 stock battery life is all over the place atm. People like me get ~4-5hrs of SOT and others are getting 1-3 some how. I would say if you're really interested, just do it. See how it goes, worst case scenario and it drains it really fast, just flash back to stock with a backup :P"

galaxynote4,39ot0j,reddit_indian,6,Sat Jun 13 08:54:49 2015 UTC,"Here are my 2 cents (Disclaimer: I am not really an expert):  If you set the virtual resolution of your screen lower that the actual resolution (and adjust the DPI to maintain the same size for the UI) you should get better performance. Basically the CPU and the GPU will render a smaller resolution UI compared to the actual screen resolution. This must not be confused with changing the actual resolution of the panel which is impossible. Because of the fact that they will push a lower resolution to the panel you should get some performance improvements on the processing side. The phone might run cooler and the throtling might get better.  But on the battery side, I think the improvements will be very minimal if any. This is because with or without changing the virtual resolution in Android, your phone will still have the same panel. So the screen consumption will mostly be the same. The power saving improvements will also come from the CPU and GPU (who will use less power to display an image).  So to answer your question, this should theoretically work on any kind of a device with a display and a CPU and GPU package. So this should work on the Note 4 aswell :-)  Those are my 2 cents. If anyone can correct me, feel free to do so"

galaxynote4,39prdg,SIlentguardian11,4,Sat Jun 13 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"I would severely doubt the bent part of the phone is causing lag. I do phone hardware repairs and that's not something I've ever seen or heard of and there's not much near the volume buttons besides the buttons themselves. If you'd like at the numerous amount of threads already opened about note 4 lag on Lollipop then you'd know a simple factory wipe of the device is almost needed in most cases and will probably fix your issue. As for the bent frame you're going to want to find a professional to fix that issue as you have to take the screen off of the device to get to the motherboard removal to rebend the frame and if you mess it up, well, that's a pretty expensive screen."
galaxynote4,39prdg,Thechuzzler,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:08:39 2015 UTC,Unless the bend pulled the case away from any heat dissipation for the CPU.  Overheating would make it lag.

galaxynote4,39krcx,wontimeicountedtwoat,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:55:27 2015 UTC,"Rooting and unlocking the bootloader are two different things that are often confused with each other.  The bounty was probably for unlocking the bootloader, which allows you to install a custom recovery through which you'd flash your own custom ROMs and kernels.   AFAIK the one click rooting methods work for all the devices, but you will flag your Knox to 0x1, thus voiding your warranty.   If you root your phone, replacement insurance becomes a requirement.  Because if you brick it, you're only paying a 100 buck deductable to replace it vs having to buy a new device at full price.     Which is why its stupid for these companies to lock down the bootloader.  If a problem happens to the android system because of root (unlikely) and the phone will no longer load; having a custom recovery allows you to reflash the rom and start over.  Not having an unlocked bootloader you're just shit out of luck.   Unless you can save your ass with kies or odin... which most people can't do."

When you add that account after the wipe your contacts will be automatically downloaded.    I'm sure there are apps to do that for you... but they are unneeded.

First, the EventBrite was absolutely spamming location access and killing the battery.  Even when I killed location services, it still killed the battery with the wake locks.  2nd, Google pushed out an update for Play Services that must not have meshed with my cached data or didn't update properly.  That was generating wake locks and draining my battery by 1% every 3 to 5 min.  So uninstalling and reinstalling Play services helped fix that.  Overall, GSAM battery monitor was the app that helped me figure it out.  Was almost tempted to Root and install Wake Lock Detector."

galaxynote4,39ic3k,dragonsamus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:11:44 2015 UTC,What variant do you have? I may suggest CMRemix. I Fucking love it. I get about 4-5 of SOT. Updated every second day. Fucking love it. I have the 910W8. This rom works with t-mobile. I don't know if they make it for anything else.
galaxynote4,39ic3k,Maddbammer,2,Fri Jun 12 01:57:53 2015 UTC,"I'll probably give CM Remix a shot. The only thing I'm worried about is the developer of that ROM seems to update it every couple days, which leads me to believe that it might not be that stable if he's updating it that regularly."
galaxynote4,39ic3k,Maddbammer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:59:28 2015 UTC,Just do it and judge for yourself. I've flashed everything and it's by far the most stable.

galaxynote4,39ic3k,Maddbammer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:09:56 2015 UTC,"I literally just downloaded the rom for t-mobile and gaaps. Flashed it and the gaaps as I would any other rom and bam, it works. I sometimes flash the bioshock kernel too."

galaxynote4,39ic3k,dragonsamus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:32:00 2015 UTC,Just installed cmRemiX and I'm having minor issues with titanium backup. Certain apps hang when restoring. Decided to delete those apps and just downloaded them again. Other than that I'm living it. Super smooth and fast.

I think when there is no audio output, the speaker is completely disconnected from the circuit and there is no current going through it. Once some app has initiated a play sound API, the speaker is woken up from this ""standby""-like state and now we hear faint static overpowered by the actual sound that the app is playing. Once the sound stops, there is a small delay where the speaker is active, but no sound is playing. The faint static can be heard. Then it clicks and the speaker goes into ""sleep"" mode. I have noticed this too and this is my explanation for it.  Also, shake your phone, you will hear more sounds ;)"

I personally have the Canadian model, the W8, but I would recommend the t-mobile variant, as that is highly regarded as the best version. Most of the ROM community, including CM, is based off that device anyway. The only thing really changed between the models is the bands, so I would expect the t-mobile one to usually get around 5 to 5.5 hours SOT, as I do.  As for the camera, it's really just down to luck. Some people have problems focusing, as I once did, but I shook the device once a month ago and haven't had a problem since.  Hope this helped 😊"

galaxynote4,39a7s2,nathan_NG,4,Wed Jun 10 12:09:16 2015 UTC,"Android 5.0 has a  memory problem. Nexus devices had horrible memory leak. RAM filled up even though there were no apps running. Samsung fixed the memory leak before pushing the update, but they somehow managed to make RAM management quite aggressive. System aggressively removes background processes when you switch apps and reloads them when you return. This fix makes those apps stay in the background so you won't see that many reloads and start overs. It also feels like jumping between apps is noticeably faster and apps load quicker."

For me at least, battery w/o Lollipop was much better. Since you just recently bought your phone I would also recommend optimizing it most to your uses. For instance, uninstall bloatware, maybe turn location off, set wifi from constant search to a lower setting, turn off LED notifications, potentially even open developer settings and reduce animations. The beauty with the Note 4 is that most things you don't need, you can easily delete or disable. As of right now, just hold out for the next update (I believe 5.1.1) which for other phones has significantly improved SOT. Also consider buying a spare battery, which I recently did (as its only $15 on amazon now) and honestly I love. Best of luck figuring this out!"

galaxynote4,39a4ed,DDPMM,12,Wed Jun 10 10:14:36 2015 UTC,"The Note 5 will most likely be a blown up Galaxy S6 with a pen and other useful features, just like previous generations. It'll run a better exonys chip, a better camera and potentially a higher resolution display. Others have a linked a patented concept which resembles a Nintendo DS, that's NOT going to be released."
galaxynote4,39a4ed,Mindcoitus,3,Wed Jun 10 12:07:39 2015 UTC,"Unlikely but it is a possibility.   Samsung has been known to take risks. The original Note,  curved edge display, wallet style accessories. They even throw stuff on the wall to see what sticks like the galaxy megas.  I'd say there would be a big market for such a Note. I know that I'd buy one without thinking twice."
galaxynote4,39a4ed,THS89,3,Wed Jun 10 12:49:31 2015 UTC,They won't release that as the note 5. Not a chance.  Hard to say what the note 5 will be.  I personally wouldn't recommend it if they do away with the SD card and removable battery.  Because I value those things.  And rumor is it will have a 2160p display or some shit. Slowly but surely getting out of hand if you ask me  I bought a note 4 and expect to upgrade to a note 6 maybe .  My note 2 lasted 2 years and some days I wish I would have just kept it.  Don't think you can go wrong with a note 4 at this point.
galaxynote4,39a4ed,1pointwonder,2,Wed Jun 10 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"I hear ya. Had note 2 for 2 years too. Removable battery and SD card are huge positives and I think they will stay for now. The Note has always been a power user phone and I don't think samsung will have a non removable back. At least I hope not.  4k is probably useless. This phone already has the resolution of my 27"" IPS 2560x1440 monitor. I cannot see the pixels on the screen..... any more resolution will just impact performance and battery life not to mention raise costs."

galaxynote4,39a4ed,THS89,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:52:09 2015 UTC,The S View case is superior in all aspects.
galaxynote4,39a4ed,r0cky,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:56:31 2015 UTC,I've heard a bunch of people saying that the glass on the s-view case leaves micro scratches on the screen. Not true?
galaxynote4,39a4ed,r0cky,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:14:24 2015 UTC,There are no scratches on my screen as of yet. I've been using the case for a few months now with no extra screen protection and contrary to what the other user said the cover also has no scratches. If you want a cool looking cover go for the LED case but I think the cool factor will fade away soon. If you want a cover that has some usage too it like the S View go with that as it has some nice functions like you can start calls/flashlight/pulse sensor with it. And also see any notifications that are incoming.
galaxynote4,39a4ed,THS89,0,Fri Jun 12 03:09:07 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it scratches the screen but the see through portion on the S view is nothing but flimsy cheap plastic. It is NOT gorilla glass or anything as some might expect. It gets full of dust and scratches.   If you don't care about the puny useless S View window, the LED flip cover wins due to better build quality and Retro LED notifications."
galaxynote4,39a4ed,THS89,0,Thu Jun 11 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"No it is not.   1) It isn't glass, the see through portion is plastic and it scratches. The (fake) leather on the LED version is much higher quality than flimsy plastic.   2) If I want to use my phone, I'd rather use the full 6"" screen (or whatever the size is) instead of forcing myself to use a tiny window on the S view (which is covered with cheap plastic that is scratched and full of dust)  3) I like the Retro feel. I don't need to limit it to a tiny window and the notifications are really just a bonus. All I wanted is a nice leathery slim cover and the LEDs are just an extra wow factor. Everyone who looks at it is impressed by the retro LEDs."
galaxynote4,39a4ed,r0cky,0,Thu Jun 11 21:23:25 2015 UTC,You have a lot more functions with the S view and since it won't come up every few seconds like the LED case the battery consumption should also be lower. The build material on the cases is both fake leather and the back is basically identical.
galaxynote4,39a4ed,THS89,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:12:15 2015 UTC,"I tested battery consumption with LED case. It doesn't even use 1%.  Build quality is not the same, the S view has a cheap plastic window that scratches and collects dust.   The functionality for the S view is useless for me since I prefer to use the full screen."

When done, you just close the youtube app and reddit goes back to full screen.

There's news today that could relate to the Note 5 pertaining to the note 5's form factor. Search for it; maybe someone will link it. Can't remember where I saw it but I didn't read it.

galaxynote4,39a4ed,deathdealer351,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:38:42 2015 UTC,"Here's my take.   I've owned iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4 (well I didn't really own the 4 for that long), Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4, and now the Note.   This is BY FAR my favourite phone. In fact I am more amazed and I enjoy this more than I did the iPhone 3G which was this extraordinary new thing called a smartphone. I get very surprised when people tell me they dislike this piece of magic.   So I definitely advocate dropping the boring iPhone and getting a Note. Should you do it? if you have a working for I'd contemplate waiting out the next few months. My Galaxy Nexus broke around July and in the fall the Nexus 5 was supposed to arrive. Unfortunately, I was forced to buy the Nexus 4. It was a great device, but had my phone not broke I would've definitely waited for the Nexus 5. It left a bitter taste in my mouth throughout the year I owned the Nexus 4.   So you have to decide really.   ps. If news come that the Note 5 does not have removable battery, I'd stay away from the Note series. I use this so much that I need the extra battery. Otherwise, I'd go with another phone."
galaxynote4,39a4ed,Shotine,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:34:31 2015 UTC,Unless your country has a rebate (200€ off the note5 if you own an italian note4 in Italy for example) wait for the Note5. It's gonna be revealed in a few months.

If you need anything faster get an actual computer.  your eyes literally aren't capable of seeing a higher definition of picture. its already really light and thin, even if Note 5 is 1/4 smaller it really wouldn't matter because only an idiot would carry a $300 phone without a case. This is pretty much the peak of phones. It'll stay solid until the forced update in 2 years intentionally makes it run slower than it actually is. Also, it works with the oculus rift."

The only nuisance is the ""B"" key is a little hard to reach because the keyboard folds so they had to displace some of the keys after the crease. But otherwise it's a great little portable keyboard that works well with the Note 4's sizable screen. Beats carrying a laptop, and will hopefully help me write my book, as I think was my test text, haha. Also, this shot was before I hid the onscreen Samsung keyboard, so there is more screen real estate to work with.      Edit: Plus, I mentioned that my phone is wrapped with a Caseology case because the iKross comes with a snap-out stand to hold your device. I was happy that the Note 4 fit in the stand even with my case on. Note sure if it'll work with other cases, but you'd probably want a thin one. Guessing you wouldn't want an Otterbox or something like that."

If you touch that icon or that top toolbar and swipe down from the top to get your Note 4 menu, you should see a banner that says ""Select keyboard."" Touch that banner and a menu should pop up. Then, where it says ""Use on-screen keyboard,"" swipe the green button/slider thing to the left. It will grey out and your on-screen keyboard should disappear. That's what works for me. If it doesn't work or if someone has a better way, feel free to share."

galaxynote4,395u9m,RedditardLogic,6,Wed Jun 10 07:55:09 2015 UTC,"get Google Keep  Best to-do app there is, and an amazing widget that can be as big or small as you need.  The preloaded weather/location lock screen is the best one there is. It changes pictures based on where you are and what the weather is like. It's cool to see something random every time you check your phone.  Buy a case! The glass is glued to the screen and it's asically impossible to replace JUST the glass. It'll cost you like $300 if you break your screen.  Use the smart remote app that comes preloaded. It's extremely convenient. You never have to search for a remote again.  Do not use the custom location app widget that loads certain apps depending on where you are. It's useless for the most part, isn't synced with google maps, and just drains your battery by constantly trying to figure out where you are."
galaxynote4,395u9m,Real666_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:01:13 2015 UTC,The My Places widget you are talking about drains your battery because you set it that way. If you look into the widget when setting it up you will discover a few things. It works perfect if you have it set to non GPS location detection. Mine is set up to know when I'm home by connecting to my home wifi. My car by Bluetooth. Gym by the gyms wifi. And if it doesn't connect to anything I have saved it changes to out and about. So tweak your setting and then see how it works.
galaxynote4,395u9m,RedditardLogic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"You're right, but that doesn't change the fact that the maps it offers aren't google, and are essentially worthless. That's one of the main features, that you can just tap a button and see how to get home or to work, etc. depending on where you happen to be. Other than that it just places up to 4 app icons you can customise, while taking up what could be 8 spots.   Even if it only takes up 4 spots instead of 8, you're better off just making a row or folder for each app you want to click based on location, and adding the google map widget for the custom locations you may need directions to.  Oh yeah, it also mutes/unmutes your phone by location. That's nice, but it's pretty easy to just tap the mute button from the dropdown menu."
galaxynote4,395u9m,Real666_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:36:00 2015 UTC,I understand what you are saying but the whole point of the app is to do it automatically without you having to touch the phone. As far as the maps are concerned you need to venture into your settings. I regularly switch my widget between Here maps and Google (just depends on my mood). So fool around with it and the settings and you'll see

galaxynote4,395u9m,tekjester1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:09:28 2015 UTC,I like how you went totally circular with the conversation. A normal person can replace just the glass watching a Youtube video and $20 in supplies. An idiot can replace the whole screen for $150 with just a small screwdriver.
galaxynote4,395u9m,RedditardLogic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"if its so easy to replace just the glass then why don't you start a company that does it and charges $30? 50% profit is huge. Oh wait, a lot of people are doing that and they have to charge $100+ every fucking time. AND PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR IT. but you're right, any normal person can just pick up $20 worth of supplies and change their screen no problem, they'd just rather spend 5x as much. I'm sure it only cost $20 too, it's just that every single person who replaces the glass for a living is so greedy that they need 500+% profit, and not a single one is wiling to undercut their competition's price... oh wait, none of that is true."
galaxynote4,395u9m,tekjester1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"Incredible leaps in logic you have made there, and i really have no idea how you got to it.  You are also forgetting about people's time.    An oil change is the same, about $20 for 5 qts and a filter.  Mechanics charge different amounts.  An oil change from my dealership is $85, and oil change from Walmart would run about $45, I can get a groupon and do it for $30.    Since you've never run a business, you clearly think the only cost is the materials for one job.  There's the big one in this case, labor.  Even with the tools, it takes a skilled person about 30 minutes to replace the screen, it could take an amateur a couple hours.  If I charged $30 and an employee could only do 2 per hour, that's only $20/hr in profit, and assuming there's a never ending stream of people with broken screens who wish to fix them.  Same as an oil change.  I could do it myself for $20, or I could pay someone $50 and let them worry about it.    Companies make fortunes doing things for people they could easily do themselves, but choose to pay 5 times the cost just to not have to worry about it.    P.S.  I see tons of places online that will replace the glass for $40-$50. Not, as you so eloquently put it, ""$100+ every fucking time."""

galaxynote4,395u9m,itzST,2,Tue Jun 9 16:23:20 2015 UTC,"Most people will give you usage advice. I'm too laze to write all the cool phone features out.  You can search these threads and find more than enough.  What I would highly recommend though would be this.  First and foremost buy this (official Samsung) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Spare Battery Charger with OEM Replacement Battery.  It's just perfect.  The battery is already massive but after a while it's just nice to have a spare.  It comes with a little plastic case and is thin and fits in your pocket.  No more worrying if you spend a night out or all day with a charger.  2 batteries is more than enough to get you through a day or 2.  GET A CASE.  If you want a very good cheap case to protect this gorgeous phone this is what I have in black.  It is also the official Samsung Galaxy Note 4 case. Obviously get what you'd like, but for $8-$13 bucks its made by Samsung and fits better than any aftermarket case.  Not insane protection but doesn't add much bulk as other cases and its sexy.  Comes in 3 colors and also protrudes on the front so you can lay your phone flat down on the screen without touching the screen to the surface.  Third, I would highly recommend some sort of screen cover.  Not sure what phone you've used before but this beautiful screen will scratch if you have some crap like sand in your pockets.  I got this because I didn't want to spend a lot.  It works fine and will protect against scratches.  Some people say buy the tempered glass but it depends on your budget.  Just get something trust me.  I've used iPhones before and the screens never scratch but these will.  Protect it.  Also with certain screen protectors like the one I linked.  You have to wear them in a bit with your fingers before they are nice and smooth like the real screen.  I was very disappointed for the first day with this screen protector.  The S-pen wasn't gliding well and my finger seemed stuck a lot.  Once the oils from your finger cover the screen a bit its perfectly fine and I love it.  Comes with 3.  I'm still on my first one after 3 months.    Lastly buy this Micro SD card in whichever size you'd like.  I went with 64 gig and it's more than enough since it comes with 32 gigs of on board memory (so 96 total with that card).  But whatever you want.  Personally I wouldn't go below 64.  Besides storing music this phone takes beautiful high res pictures and videos that will eat up memory real quick.  You don't want to skimp out on picture quality so max that out.  As for video it can shoot up to 4k res at 60fps.  I usually stick to 1440p 60fps because Most people don't have 4k monitors and it takes up a ton of space. I'll use 1080p 60ps as well. When you get your phone under camera options you'll find where it says recording mode and youll see something like this.  You'll want to change that to smooth motion to get 60fps recording.  The one annoying thing about the Note 4 is some of these options reset every time you close the camera app.  OK I wrote a lot more than I wanted to haha.  Enjoy the phone it's great.  Also get Nova launcher to replace Touchwiz, and Textra to replace the standard text messaging app.  Both are amazing."

You are going to wipe so that you can bring back the very app and system data you wiped? =/ it's your phone, you can do what you want, but thats defeating the purpose of wiping in the first place.   If you want to bring your photos and files along, copy them to a different device or use cloud back up. Same goes for snote. -- use your Evernote or Samsung account to back it up. Tasker recently got cloud backup for profiles, so use that for those. Most sms apps have similar -- there are many solutions on play if your client does not.   It's a pretty straightforward process really. Don't complicate it and bring along the very data you are trying to get rid of.  Edit: No that's cool. Ask for help and then downvote when you don't like the advice. Again, you are wiping data for a reason. Bring back the photos but avoid bringing back app and system data wherever possible. Otherwise you spent an hour to end up close to where you started."

The reason i want to restore it is cause i get about 3-4 hours of ost most of the time 95% using chrome and the biggest reason is that lately when i push the power button to lock the screen 10 percent of the time it doesn't do that
galaxynote4,395lmt,whygohomie,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:22:05 2015 UTC,"Oh no, you misunderstand. Definitely wipe, just be selective in what you restore.   The big reason I say it is because you are wiping your system to get rid of corrupt data or conflicts that may remain from kitkat. If you then restore all app and system data from kitkat you will restore the very data you were tying to eliminate from your device.   Best practice is to backup manually and restore selectively. Bring over app data that is essential or very difficult to recreate, but try to limit it and stay away from restoring system data at all.   Once you get your device going, use a tool like Debloater by gatesjunior on XDA to freeze preinstalled system apps. You can find lists of safe to disable apps in the same forum thread."

I like using s-health s-planner smart remote and s-note as well as the pen functionality and wouldn't like to loose them"
galaxynote4,395lmt,marmfield,2,Wed Jun 10 11:43:21 2015 UTC,"Rooting and a rom are different. Root gives you elevated permissions, Roms give you a different version of android. Root isn't required to debloat because the Debloater tool by gatesjunior will work with or without root. Root on stock rom will simply be the stock rom plus expanded user permissions until you use those elevated permissions to make changes.   And yes, you are able to keep the things you mentioned as long as you don't remove them or install a rom that has them stripped out.  Edit: just FYI, in the US only T-Mobile and I think sprint variant can be rooted or modified with a custom rom. If you are on att or Verizon, wipe and then use the Debloater tool."

galaxynote4,395jc7,jiahaowoo64,2,Tue Jun 9 12:11:14 2015 UTC,I believe the consensus for this issue is to get a glass screen protector with colour so that the bubbles aren't visible. There's no fix really because the screen itself is curved on the phone.

galaxynote4,392d9s,idavyko,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:22:48 2015 UTC,What kind of case are you using?  I'm considering getting the wireless charging back and see if it will work with my Otterbox Defender.
galaxynote4,392d9s,mastersyrron,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:47:11 2015 UTC,You can purchase a wireless charger receiver like this http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=qi+note+4 and use any case you want! I originally tried out the charging back and I was pissed that I couldn't get any case to fit on but using the receiver I have no problems with any case fitting on it. It works even in an otterbox case as well. Keep in mind some of them have NFC so if that's a feature you use make sure the receiver you pick is compatible

Got the coils that fit behind the original back and a charging pad a month after the phone was released. I charged overnight a few times -- any other time seemed pointless. It was a strange experience. The phone got pretty hot. I could have been imagining it, but I'd swear my battery acted funky that day.   After a week of playing around with wireless charging, I never used it again. The technology really isn't there yet, and I just don't see the point. So slow. Can't use it while it's charging. Makes swapping batteries more of a hassle.   One of my favorite features about this phone is the fast charging. I'm just sticking with that.  I regret purchasing the coil and the charging pad. But, I just had to try out the new tech, I guess.   You never know, you might find that you like the way it works.   However, as I said, in my opinion, it just seems pointless.

galaxynote4,392oi9,Downvotecanonn,3,Mon Jun 8 20:37:01 2015 UTC,Samsung Gear S is the best watch for a note 4. I have it and never looked back to using my moto 360 or any other android wear watch. With the Gear S you don't need a separate phone service to use the watch. You can just leave it tethered via Bluetooth to the note and it works just the same.
galaxynote4,392oi9,Real666_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"I would also recommend the Gear S. I may be a little biased but working out with the Gear S, especially when jogging, makes it worth it compared to others as of right now.    But I will admit its app store is somewhat a mess. But I don't really know what else to do with a smartwatch besides health related things. I also like the tiny little swype keyboard, its pretty cool and handy."
galaxynote4,392oi9,KickItWithKyle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:36:55 2015 UTC,Yeah it's apps store is a mess but beside health related things you can do pretty much everything you can do on your phone. Text email talk music etc.
galaxynote4,392oi9,Real666_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:44:58 2015 UTC,What makes the Gear S so much better than the Moto360?  I've been using my Moto since release with my Nexus 5 and its been great...BUT...I just picked up a Note 4 Edge today.  I hadn't even considered switching watches.
galaxynote4,392oi9,Head_Muppet,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:50:55 2015 UTC,I was just like you until i got a gear S then i found out the truth. The Apple Watch is modeled off the Gear S but the Gear does so much more like texting from the watch using the watch keyboard. Everything you do on your phone you can do on the watch. The watch does not activate your GPS every time you respond to a text like the 360 does for anything. I can call people and speak to them from the watch. I can leave my phone at home and have all my calls forwarded to the watch. me and anyone else you find with a gear s will say the 360 is like a pebble watch. Pretty much the same thing.
galaxynote4,392oi9,Real666_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that, if I got the Gear S (and if I have my Note within Bluetooth range), I don't have to purchase a separate plan and I can still surf the web, get and respond to notifications, answer and make phone calls, and such? Because if so, I might consider picking one up."
galaxynote4,392oi9,abow3,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:42:23 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I'm saying. Your watch only uses its data when not Bluetooth connected.

galaxynote4,392oi9,Real666_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:39:02 2015 UTC,The Gear 2 Neo and the Gear S are the same operating system but two different beings. As far as updates and apps go I had my watch since it came out. Received 2 updates and more apps in the Samsung store every weeks. Mind you I'm am a person who had the 360 with my nexus 5 got the not and using the 360 was very limited. I went strait to the Gear S  and never looked back. I have had zero issues with the Gear S and as we speak I'm on my second day of battery with 40% left with heavy usage at 10 pm. Moto 360 barely last a day on a good day. people don't like Tizen because it's not open sourced. But believe it of not it gives way less problems and issues than Android. And for a watch that's perfect.

The bloats annoying. My finger tends to hit the screen whenever I try to hit the home button or the back or active apps button. I also can't for the life of me figure out what's eating so much ram. I know unused ram is wasted ram but when you run out of ram and other apps have to restart that's a problem. It shouldn't use 3/4th of the ram when no apps are running. My friends older shittier android device uses like 1/4 of the 2 gigs it comes with. I don't get it.

On ATT so no chance of getting rid of it. Sure, you can use third party apps to get rid of some of the touchwiz stuff, but sometimes it's baked in and inevitably, third party apps don't always work well with one another."

No iMessage, was great to have a simple messaging system with my friends who all had iPhones and also the lack of image/video compression. The Play Store is just flat out awful to be honest. The App Store, while expensive, had many quality and useful apps and games unlike the trash that takes up most of the Play Store. The UI can be somewhat laggy and unresponsive at times which was hardly the case when I had my iPhone 5 (it did have problems after a few years, but not in the beginning). Compared to an iPhone, it's hard to find custom and designed cases besides those just for protection.   Overall, I think if Samsung continues to improve its quality and software, I will definitely buy another Samsung if it is able to make up for some of the iOS features I miss."

I had to root and ROM to make this phone preform like it should've but really, I shouldn't have to hassle with it.

I did the lollipop update and shortly after did a factory reset to iron out any kinks.  I do still seem to get the random odd slow downs but battery life has not been an issue at all.   I last charged my phone Friday night over night and am currently sitting at 62% but I did plug it into my car charger in my car on my way to work so that was good for about a 10%-15% increase.

On TouchWiz, the OS consumed 1.5-2.0GB right out the gate even fully debloated, and apps/the launcher would frequently reload and performance was horrible. If I even tapped out of Ingress to look at the Intel map for a second, Ingress will reload.  As for S-Pen functionality, it seems to work just fine, you just don't get things like Action Memo. If you have an app that supports sensitivity and pressure, it works just fine for me. Hell, when using IITC Mobile, I can actually hover the pen over the map and highlight things.

galaxynote4,38y82x,Irahetatidbits,3,Sun Jun 7 21:23:38 2015 UTC,"After 6 months, probably not.  When a file is deleted, you basically say ""the space formerly used up by this file is fair game to be reused by other files now"", but it doesn't turn the 1's into 0's or anything.  The way undelete works, basically, is that it looks for the ""freed up space"" and see if the leftover data in that space looks like it used to comprise a file of some kind.    After 6 months though, it's highly likely that some other file has been written to that chunk of storage, which obliterates what was once there.  You can certainly try it, but I would set your expectations to nil."

galaxynote4,38y82x,eesperan,2,Sun Jun 7 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Basically, you're hoping that your phone, which commits untold thousands of file operations a day, somehow did not do so in the specific part of your phone's storage that once held the scrapbook file.  Since phones are the sorts of things that are used every day, and don't sit idle/off for long periods of time, that makes your odds worse.  Overall, I'd say you probably have about equal chance of reconstructing it from your own memory as you do your phone's, but flukes happen."

You just lose your manufacturers warranty for the ability to install and run anything in a higher-permission level on the phone.

You own the phone, they shouldn't have the power to lock you down. Yet another reason why I never get the carrier edition of any phone.

I am glad a got it over a iPhone 6 plus.   That doesn't mean it's perfect.  The slow gallery is a well known issue even in Note 3.  I've found that brand new shop units tend to be snappy.   it's unclear why most people seem to get worse results after use. I suspect it's due to the number of photos you have stored.  I am currently getting 2 to 3s which is irritating because you usually want to see the photo after you take it.  I've found if you install dropbox's carousel it adds a shortcut to the camera that you can use to view pictures.  it's much faster than the gallery so I don't buy it cannot be improved.  In short, Note 4 is great and I recommend it highly but to say there are some common widespread  issues is ""whining"" or ""harping""  is doing a disservice  to people relying on feedback from existing users."

galaxynote4,38v0f1,Jennica,-1,Sun Jun 7 05:13:42 2015 UTC,Agreed.
galaxynote4,38v0f1,gthing,5,Sun Jun 7 07:21:39 2015 UTC,"Same here. A casual reader's going to think the Note 4 is a POS, and that's just not true!"
galaxynote4,38v0f1,jamend,2,Sun Jun 7 16:17:24 2015 UTC,No problems here b0ss
galaxynote4,38v0f1,MrLeonardo,2,Sun Jun 7 16:50:18 2015 UTC,"I had an iphone 4s before this... the Note 4 feels like heaven, and it is! I love my phone and have honestly no complaints. I went from having 30 minutes of battery life on the iphone 4s to 65%-75% at the end of the day with moderate usage on the note 4.  idk, i didn't upgrade to lollipop so maybe that's why I'm not having issues (waiting till 5.1 and even then I'll see), but, i love this phone and have no complaints."
galaxynote4,38v0f1,Ryanmd007,3,Sun Jun 7 03:30:31 2015 UTC,Upgraded to lollipop and the single only issue I've found is stuttering during Bluetooth media. But that is easily fixed by keeping the screen on while playing.
galaxynote4,38v0f1,Racerdude,-12,Sun Jun 7 03:59:14 2015 UTC,I upgraded. Few issues. The ones I have are so minor its not even worth talking about.
galaxynote4,38v0f1,PDXMatthew,2,Sun Jun 7 05:03:44 2015 UTC,Half the issues are googleable anyways.
galaxynote4,38v0f1,clearlyunseen,4,Sun Jun 7 05:11:19 2015 UTC,Only because people have forums where they can ask and other people can answer.
galaxynote4,38v0f1,markysharky,2,Sun Jun 7 05:06:22 2015 UTC,So does this mean I should upgrade to Lollipop? This sub put me on the fence with all the supposed issues being reported.
galaxynote4,38v0f1,KaptainKraken,2,Sun Jun 7 05:13:27 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, we curently have 3 N4s in my family and they work great. My wife is in the second though, her first one had problems focusing the camera but was exchanged for a new one by the store. This is by far the best phone I have ever used, and I owned a lot of flagship devices over the last few years."

galaxynote4,38v0f1,zolistir,0,Sun Jun 7 05:51:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP but sure I can. No phone is perfect by any means, but for me the pros of the Note 4 outweigh the cons by a considerable amount. With Xposed now working on Lollipop TouchWiz I don't have much of anything to complain about. The clear defaults crap on Samsung drives me crazy. The high volume warning, too. Luckily, those are fixed now and those two things are nitpicking. Front-facing speakers would be nice, but I knew it didn't have them when I got the phone. The two major issues most people seem to have is lag and battery life. Those aren't a problem for me."

galaxynote4,38td2p,Madnessx9,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:31:29 2015 UTC,I just installed greenify.  I never really understood this app until now and I never had root last time is used it.

galaxynote4,38td2p,lego_hobbit,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:26:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't see anything out of the ordinary either, but it makes you aware of the load each app places on your phone. Looking at process stats, I could see that there were three apps that had significant (300+MB) memory usage 100% of the time - Android Wear, Lastpass, and Facebook. Disabling any of the three instantly made my phone run smooth again. Since I don't NEED Lastpass's autofill service to use it (it's just convenient) I turned that portion of the app off. Smooth sailing.  Android is great with managing memory, but everybody forgets the fact that there are some apps that are just BEEFY. Android can manage memory all it wants, but it still has a limited supply, and if all the apps you like to use are heavy hitters, you're gonna run into issues with lag when they are all trying to hang out in the background for your convenience."
galaxynote4,38uy4w,j4ck0ff,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:20:46 2015 UTC,"Backup. It's the only way I could find to do it. Titanium or helium work well.  Besides, as I found out on my N7, upgrading from KK to L without wiping makes it laggy anyway, giving you a bad impression of lollipop."

And I swear it didn't do this at all on 4.4.4; but it does on 5.0.1  I would send it in easily, if I could be without a phone for that time; I can't."
galaxynote4,38sldm,Solkre,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:55:49 2015 UTC,"Should be the digitizer. Had something similar happen on a nexus 4. It ""goes away"" but keeps getting worse with the time until a row on the display is not useable.  Did you drop your phone or does the screen or the bezel around it have any (even so tiny) dent? If yes this could be the reason."
galaxynote4,38sldm,HocusDaber,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:07:24 2015 UTC,Well shit.  Now I need to find a loaner until I can get this repaired.  Unless the Verizon shop would swap it for me.  Also no drops and no damage.
galaxynote4,38sldm,Solkre,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:24:46 2015 UTC,Try it over warranty first! The possibility is high that it's a manufacturer caused issue. Total try it over warranty first before you put any money yourself in it.
galaxynote4,38sldm,HocusDaber,2,Sun Jun 7 17:37:54 2015 UTC,"As much as I do enjoy the Note series and it is a great phone on its own, I have to agree with this sentiment.  The S6 Edge is truly a beast of a phone and a whole notch above the Note 4.  I would trade + pay to trade my Note 4 for an S6 Edge 128gb in a heartbeat.  One hand useable, huge storage space, a little better pictures, faster processor, better fingerprint scanner, faster touchwiz, themes, rootable, faster updates, better support, a lot more 3rd party cases and accessories, just to name a few things.    The only downside I see is removable battery which I don't use anyways, and the pen which I very rarely use as well.  My next phone will probably be a S7 or S8 to be honest.  I think I'm done with the Note series."
galaxynote4,38sldm,guitarskooter,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:23:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your points, but you say some of the benefits are rootable and better support. The note 4 is also rootable, and I would say it has better support as of right now, especially in the XDA forums."
galaxynote4,38sldm,TheMilt,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:03:40 2015 UTC,I'm thinking about the s6 128gb   I don't see a lot of pull for those edges. But the phone is amazingly fast.   I would really like a big phone with the speed of the s6. This does that. Mostly. But these bugs could become annoying over the next 2 years leaving me wishing I had traded to stability.   The note 5 comes out later this year. And I'm sure Samsung has good plans for it. But I'd need to shell out a chunk of cash to get it.  Just feeling kinda lost over all of this
galaxynote4,38sldm,ozzzy3z,2,Sat Jun 6 17:56:59 2015 UTC,Finally a laggy keyboard comment! I thought it was just me. My G4 is awesome except for this issue. It misses keystrokes. I'm typing this comment on it now and experienced a missed input 13 times. I'm still in my return window and as much as I like this phone I will likely be sending it back.
galaxynote4,38sldm,ozzzy3z,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:13:21 2015 UTC,Yeah. Even if you install third party keyboards its crap.   I'm grabbing a note 4 asap. I just can't deal with feeling like something is consistently wrong with half the features of my device.
galaxynote4,38sldm,lordsmiff,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:01:02 2015 UTC,"After one week of ownership, and a handful of normal power cycles, my keyboard issues have resolved themselves. I can't explain why, but the phone no longer misses keyboard inputs. It has also become smoother/lag has disappeared. I can't explain this, but I'm happy because this is a perfectly sized phone for my needs. It is now a keeper."
galaxynote4,38sldm,lordsmiff,2,Wed Jun 10 11:18:04 2015 UTC,"For me, it was a toss up between the Note 4 and the Nexus 6. I got the note 4 for the stylus and the gear VR.   I wish I'd got the nexus though - touchwiz is awful. The Samsung touches (colours, buttons, notification quick settings changes) are ugly and detract from goog's material design. I really tried to like touchwiz but it's just not as good as vanilla android (even on my friends S6 edge). Nova launcher was installed a couple of weeks later and I would not go back to touchwiz.   I run CM12 on it now and while things like the heartrate and fingerprint sensors don't work any more, they were only really ever a gimmicky thing (though, to be fair, I wish I could still use the fingerprint sensor for lastpass) and I'm much happier with it. The stylus still works well (but not the popup thingy, obviously) and Google cardboard is ace :-)  It runs much better now, never lags and battery is about the same as stock. This to me shows the hardware is sound but the Samsung stock ROM is crap.  I'm still going to swap it for a nexus 6 when I get chance though, largely because these get android updates quicker than any manufacturer-fettled OS and having had a Moto G for a little while, I was well-impressed with the build quality of Motorola."
galaxynote4,38sldm,lordsmiff,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:49:48 2015 UTC,I really haven't used the nexus 6  But I hear its a beast. Guess before I make a final choice on the note 4 I'll try one out. If I can find one in action. (Most stores have a dummy model for some reason)
galaxynote4,38sldm,PM_ME_YOUR_TITHS,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:02:57 2015 UTC,"Being stock android, I can't imagine it will be anything other than stellar.  I had a 2013 Nexus 7 which I upgraded to a nvidia shield tablet for my birthday this year and almost immediately regretted it. Lag was so awful (strangely, games were fine). CM is not an option on it though as the nvidia stuff and the controller would not work (the whole point of the device :) but fortunately, the latest update for it has resolved all these issues now.  Nvidia have been really good with the updates for it and more importantly, they've barely touched the OS apart from some device specific stuff to support the gaming and controller.  But I digress. My point is that I really like android but as a phone, I will not buy another one that isn't a nexus device purely because the manufacturers' need to differentiate themselves from each other, almost invariably, spoil the OS and make updates slower.  I had an HTC One M8 as well and while that was let down by the camera and the near constant almost-dropping it, HTC's customisations were much better than Samsung's and I believe both of the things I disliked about the M8 have been much improved with the M9. Sense is definitely better than touchwiz...just to give you something else to think about ;-)"
galaxynote4,38sldm,almosttan,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:23:32 2015 UTC,"I should also mention that another deciding factor for me was the MicroSD slot on the Note 4.  This has also proven to be a red herring (or some other, more appropriate metaphor :) as the changes made by google as to how apps on android are allowed to use them have (especially on an unrooted device) made them near defunct. They've completely broken them as far as I'm concerned and now my 64gb card is living its life as the offline cache for Spotify and my camera save location. Even so, still better than iOS :-D"
galaxynote4,38sldm,MrLeonardo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:30:16 2015 UTC,That's almost exactly why I want them.  14gb of music and 11gb of photos on my SD card.   If that was on my device I'd be full up

Loved it on kit kat, love it even MORE on lollipop. Everything from the speed, battery life, screen quality (dat glorious super AMOLED 5.7 display) , camera quality, build quality, etc. I'm constantly impressed by the battery on a daily basis and there is pretty much no stutters or lag for any app that I use.

It doesn't matter what phone you have, this can plague any android phone.  First thing I'd suggest is installing Watchdog https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zomut.watchdoglite&hl=en which will monitor your cpu usage etc and see what is going on.  See if any apps on there stand out as suspicious to you.  Also in your android settings menu application manager, you can scroll over to running and see what's going on in there, to try to track down the app.  Also have you disabled any system apps?  Disabling incorrect ones can cause issues.  And do you have an SD card in your phone?  SD cards with a corrupt file on it can wreak havoc on your battery life.  If you don't mind just restarting, your best bet would be to factory reset again from recovery mode, and then run it a day without any apps and see if it wakelocks.  If not, start installing some apps and see if one of those is the culprit.  It's not the update that is ruining your phone, it is a wakelock, and those can be difficult to pinpoint without root."

galaxynote4,38rexd,BigDaddyFwaka,3,Sat Jun 6 04:15:02 2015 UTC,"I just settled this debate for myself earlier tonight. I have been researching the crap out of this for the last two weeks and really wanted to pick the G4.  I bought a Note 4.   The specs on the phones are basically the same - the G4 has a slightly better chip and the Note has better video performance. Cameras are a wash, as far as I could tell. Note has a slightly larger screen, but the same resolution.   The deciding factor was holding both of them. The G4 felt fragile and flexed quite a bit. I also didn't care for the power and volume buttons on the back. I really liked the real leather back (the Note's is leathery plastic), but that wasn't enough to overcome the quality feel of the Note.   The Note felt significantly better in my hand, in both build quality and sturdiness. It feels substantial and the metal frame doesn't allow the phone to flex at all. I also liked the screen on it a little bit better than the G4 (though the G4's screen is very nice). The fingerprint scanner is a nice feature and the S-Pen seems cool - not sure if I'll use it much. We'll see.   The Note has a pretty proven track record and there are tons of accessories out there for it. Plus, everyone else has been the guinea pigs and has figured out all the faults of the phone (and how to overcome them) for you already.   I usually like to be an early adopter, but the Note really fit my needs right now. I'm going to try not to get pissed off when the Note 5 gets announced in September and I'm stuck with my Note 4.   Good luck! I don't think you're really going to go wrong either way. Both are excellent phones."
galaxynote4,38rexd,TeeDubb1,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:18:03 2015 UTC,"That was my problem with getting the Note 4 as well. It's gonna be real hard getting a phone that is getting upgraded here soon. As for the feel, I've been using Galaxy devices for a hot second now (all Galaxy devices minus the S4) because they've always been the best option next to the competition. The premium feel to me isn't going to be a deal breaker, for me at least."
galaxynote4,38rexd,cjax2,2,Sat Jun 6 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"That was my problem with getting the Note 4 as well. It's gonna be real hard getting a phone that is getting upgraded here soon.   Why not wait then? I promise you the note 5 will be an absolute better phone than the Note 4 and LG G4(not trying to talk down, it will just be newer and have a better Exynos SoC). Other than that, I would go with the G4 if you dont like Touchwiz or plan on using the S Pen"
galaxynote4,38rexd,cjax2,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"Well the longest I can wait is mid-July, so I don't have the option to get it then, unless I give someone the G4/Note 4 plus a little extra cash l... (that I will likely not have haha)"
galaxynote4,38rexd,TeeDubb1,2,Sat Jun 6 18:53:08 2015 UTC,lol i feel that. Hell if you are not going to be able to upgrade for a while I think you should go with the G4 since its newer and is the main priority to LG at least for right now. The Note series is a flagship and great but never really top priority to Samsung so no use in getting an almost year old phone.

I'm doing the Edge program, so I should be able to upgrade early next year if the Note 5 is that compelling. I wouldn't blame you for getting the G4 - it was a very close call for me."

galaxynote4,38rexd,NGU-Ben,2,Sun Jun 7 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"Verizon has a program called Edge where you make payments on the phone and can upgrade once it's 75% paid off. Yes, it's kind of a ripoff if you trade up because you lose the equity in the phone, but you don't have a 2 year contract and you own the phone outright if you pay it off.   Glad to help.

The build quality of the G3 is sub-par, the thing creaks and flexes, and on top of it there were cracks on the bottom mic and upper mic/ir blaster, and LG simply refused to change it on warranty even though it's a widespread issue.  The back cover is scratched easily and after a few months wasn't tightly attached to the back of the phone anymore and I feel that the G4 plastic cover will suffer the same issues eventually. And to top it off LG didn't offer the 32GB/3GB RAM model in my region, so I had to deal with low RAM issues (apps closing) and launcher redraws every now and then, and it annoyed the hell out of me.  The G4 feels like a slightly upgrade over the G3, so there was no way in hell I would choose it."

I've done a few googling myself when I first got the phone and breaking the screen has been in my nightmares many times. Next time you should get a glass-screenprotector. They are like the plastic protectors except they're glass and they feel much better on the fingers.  There are a few good manufacturers that make the protectors. I use a phantom glass one but I've seen a few people on here recommend the Zagg ones 20-30$ beats 150 D:"

Even on non-samsung phones where the glass & screen aren't factory-fused together, it's really hard to separate the two without destroying the LCD or at the very least, getting dust & fingerprints under the glass.   With our phones though, they're partially glued together & very hard to take apart, so even if you do get the whole assembly it's still damn difficult to replace if you don't know exactly what you're doing. And even if you do manage to accomplish it, they rarely ever fit back together properly and the phone will just look like shit afterward. You're honestly better off just replacing the whole phone or paying the deductible if you have insurance than to try and replace the screen yourself."

It is pretty much instantaneous, and makes it so I use the recents rarely enough that the lag doesn't really bug me.

If you don't already have it and plan on being rooted, I HIGHLY suggest buying titanium back up.

Because the scrape wouldn't be covered in the one year or extended warranty as it only covers internal issues and malfunctions as a free replacement. Insurance deductible for a Note 4 through Asurion is somewhere in the 100-150 range.   If you are cancelling Verizon service and going to another carrier you may want to because you'll be able to sell the replacement for more money if there is no damage to it and you'll most likely get a new device with your new service.

galaxynote4,38gcpf,mrsweetteas,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:24:30 2015 UTC,I've never exchanged a device before. I actually suggested this to her the first week or 2 and she kind of dismissed it. Don't you only have like 14 days or something to swap without having to buy a new device outright?
galaxynote4,38gcpf,mrsweetteas,2,Thu Jun 4 12:03:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the remorse period is only 14 days but if you raise enough hell they might be able to accommodate you.  At the very least they'll send her another Note 4 - this also may help as this battery life seems to be at the far outlier end of the negative spectrum."
galaxynote4,38gcpf,mrsweetteas,2,Thu Jun 4 12:34:40 2015 UTC,"I'd almost be afraid of this though too... with her note 2 after... I don't know, 6 months maybe? She dropped it and broke the screen. She got a replacement, and I don't know if it was a refurb or what, but man did the battery life suck on that one. It was better initially I assume just because it was a fresh install, but it tanked quick, and she's been afraid of swapping out like that ever since. I mean really I guess how much worse could it get though? She's already unhappy with it. Maybe it's something to consider. It's just so crazy that so many people seem to have such drastically different experiences."
galaxynote4,38gcpf,mrsweetteas,2,Thu Jun 4 12:46:16 2015 UTC,Yeah my experience was similar to hers.  Sounds like it's time for her to be done with the note series!   Who is her provider?

galaxynote4,38gcpf,mrsweetteas,2,Thu Jun 4 12:51:14 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. I don't know about AT&T.  When I had my Note replaced 2x (for other issues) I was adamant that my phone was so new I couldn't be bothered with a factory refurb and they needed to send me a brand new device.  And they did both times, but that was T-Mobile and their customer service is pretty good.  Alternatively you can buy her one of those spare battery chargers which doubles as a carrying case and she can just hot swap during the day!"
galaxynote4,38gcpf,evil_INDEED,2,Thu Jun 4 12:56:13 2015 UTC,"That's actually not a bad price for the battery and the charger/case, that's actually kind of surprising. I'll see what she thinks about doing a swap during the day. Thanks for the heads up, it might be a stopgap until we can figure out the battery drain issue."
galaxynote4,38gcpf,evil_INDEED,3,Thu Jun 4 13:04:22 2015 UTC,Good luck! She might actually come to really like it - I never ever had to physically tether my phone to a charger anymore and that was pretty great :)
galaxynote4,38gcpf,evil_INDEED,2,Thu Jun 4 13:11:31 2015 UTC,I believe there is an issue specifically with Lollipop on AT&T. I have the exact same issues and have factory reset multiple times. I think the only thing that might truly fix it is the 5.1.1 update which is rumored to be launched by Samsung in July...which means your gf might see it by September if we are lucky...I still love the phone and I deal with the mediocre battery by carrying a spare around...

I'm with you though, this phone has been a huge disappointment to me.  My LTE signal is incredibly poor, the GPS issue happens at least every other time I use it, and I still get lag switching apps.  I've honestly been thinking of switching back to my S3 w/ Cyanogenmod.  Worked far smoother and the LTE was much stronger, which is terribly sad."
galaxynote4,38bnza,PeachPomPete,2,Wed Jun 3 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"That's really frustrating to hear about your GPS. Oddly enough, I've had GPS problems on ALL 3 Samsung phones I have owned starting with my doomed-from-the-start Captivate (Galaxy S)  My Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note 3 both eventually developed GPS issues. Despite many hours of googling and trying all sorts of ""fixes"" I relented each that maybe I did something wrong and it was irreparably dead. It really astounds me with how it got so bad and I never understood the GPS enough to really get a good feeling for what could be wrong.  I had an LG G3 for a while which never developed any issue with its GPS for the 9 months I owned it. But, I broke it and jumped back on Samsung with the Note 4. GPS is working well now but I'm anxious about the same happening as with me S3 and Note 3 :-( I felt so helpless without it"

galaxynote4,38bnza,PDXMatthew,0,Thu Jun 4 09:58:01 2015 UTC,Why? Because they're gone in the S6? The S6 was designed to go head-on with the iPhone which also doesn't have a removable battery and SD card slot. The Note line is meant to be more professional so I don't think I'd necessarily assume that the Note 5 will follow in the footsteps of the S6 in this regard.

But they don't use the sin card to tell if it's a customer trying to use their phone service. They use the internal imei. Gsm store your account info on simcards.  Gsm phones won't work on wdcma.

The bump at the speaker makes a significant difference in speaker sound quality, which is something that people want.

galaxynote4,38buzo,moxtwelve,2,Wed Jun 3 05:24:03 2015 UTC,I would take it back and talk to them about it. Cricket is a GSM carrier so the N910H/C should work just fine. talk to them again about it and show them that the internet isn't working.
galaxynote4,38buzo,MiniMoose12,2,Wed Jun 3 05:53:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, knowing the N910H/C is compatible encouraged me to do a proofread of the APN settings. Looks like when I was on the phone with the CS rep from Cricket, and we were entering the APN settings, I misheard the APN title as ""nbo,"" or the guy on the phone wasn't sure either. It was hard for me to understand the CS rep I was speaking with. I realized the error while checking my entry against this website. So then I changed the APN title to ""ndo"" and pressed save. That didn't do anything. I then deleted the original APN we entered, and created a new the APN with the APN title ""ndo.""  The Internet connection started working in about 10 seconds without me having to restart the phone. I guess this is a useful post about proofreading... hopefully it can help someone else somehow."

I never had much problem with it since I only use the note 4 for quick snaps..& instant gratification.   I recently started to use Snapcam HDR.  It has a zero sharpening setting that essentially eliminates in camera sharpening. You can also shot with that app with HDR disabled.  I highly recommend it.  I shoot with a 5dm2 as well.. The note 4 is a relive from the canon's backfocuses.. And that screen can't be beat!"

Half if not all of the pictures I'll take at a time (usually 10+) will be blurry in some way. When it's not blurry it's amazing. What can I do so this is more consistent?  It is also very slow at taking pictures. Often times I'll take a picture, move my camera, then the screen freezes on something I didn't try to take a picture of for a second before figuring out what it's supposed to do. It also takes several seconds longer to start the camera up. With an iphone I just flick the camera icon up from the lock screen and it almost instantly starts taking pictures as fast as I want, and they're almost always perfect..."

galaxynote4,3855p7,wiredwezl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:38:24 2015 UTC,Thanks. Just tried it and I'll let you know if it helps. It happens to me randomly. Just based on the name of the setting that's being changed I don't think it will help because most of the time it's happened to me I've been connected to the HSPA (4G) network and not the LTE network.
galaxynote4,3855p7,byronbrewer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:50:47 2015 UTC,Hopefully it does.  If not.  Do the code again but choose automatic  at the top to change it back to default
galaxynote4,3855p7,wiredwezl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:58:49 2015 UTC,What is the downside of having the LTE band [ALL] selected vs Automatic?
galaxynote4,3855p7,byronbrewer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:16:09 2015 UTC,None for me. I haven't had any issues at all. My wife (note 3) had issues making calls. Calls wouldn't go through and she had to toggle airplane mode to make calls. As i said. I haven't had any problems on note 4. I read about this on XDA forums. And it worked perfectly.
galaxynote4,3855p7,wiredwezl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:37:19 2015 UTC,Based on the quick research I did making that change locks the radio into LTE mode. So this prevents it from falling back to 2G/3G when needed.   We don't have Band 12 in NYC yet so I still need HSPA for in building coverage. Going to set mine back to Automatic and just wait for a fix to be released.
galaxynote4,3855p7,byronbrewer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:56:25 2015 UTC,As i said it worked for me where I am. I was looking for a LTE only fix. And from what I've read this isn't it. It should only effect LTE modes and not dropping to 3g/4g when needed. This is one of the many threads I've read on it.  http://forum.xda-developers.com/note-4/help/sm-n910h-3g-variant-t2925648
galaxynote4,3855p7,wiredwezl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:42:09 2015 UTC,My wife on her note 3 had that problem which is why she couldn't make calls. So I switched her back.
galaxynote4,3855p7,wiredwezl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, based on my very uneducated understanding of this setting it would require a VoLTE capable handset in a market where VoLTE is enabled. Otherwise the handset wouldn't be able to connect to 2G/3G for voice calls."
galaxynote4,3855p7,byronbrewer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:50:28 2015 UTC,"I believe so. We are on tmobile. I have the Note 4 that has the new bands. My wife had the Note 3.  So it makes perfect sense the issue using this.  From what I understand this should work with  tmobile, AT&T, and the international versions of the note 4.  Since all should support HD voice.

I also did this for my wife on her note 3 but she had problems making phone calls.  I think it's because the LTE chips in the note 3 are not as good as the Note 4 since tmo implemented the new spectrum."

galaxynote4,385jvv,FezzikTheGreat,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:03:59 2015 UTC,The quickest route to a vanilla android is by using an aosp Rom which didn't have native support for pen input and the drivers may be near impossible to reconstruct without input from Samsung.  It would have to be completely written from the ground up. The alternative is to try and reverse engineer and strip out all of the junk in the stock samsung roms. Both options would be a ton of work if not impossible.

Furthermore, they are really the only carrier that has an excuse -- WiFi calling involves some pretty low level changes. Couple this with the fact that LP changes essentially everything about the low level operations of Android, and that Samsung went and changed all of that. I see no reason to believe that future updates will see any notable delays.  It is really just childish and shortsighted to shit on a company that has probably the best track record for updates in spite of the fact that the useful features they have actually take work to implement had one anomalously long delay."

galaxynote4,382lkr,greenshrubbery,3,Mon Jun 1 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"My main point is that T-Mobile has a better track record when it comes to updates than the other 3 major US carriers, and this one instance is an unusual example. It simply doesn't make any sense to extrapolate from this incident that future updates are going to be heavily delayed. If the next update is also way behind the other carriers, and we start seeing the same pattern bleeding into other phones, then we can start talking about that. As it is now, though, there is no reason to believe that T-Mobile's extreme delay in updating the Note 4 to Lollipop was anything other than an anomaly, regardless of whether it was a result of technical issues or red tape."

galaxynote4,382lkr,BlueArmistice,10,Mon Jun 1 23:30:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Especially since the Note 4 scored on par with (and in some cases higher than) the S5 and parts of the S6. They brought over many of the things they tested on the Note over to the 6, so I think that it's safe to say that they treated the Note 4 as a testing ground for the most dedicated of their user base to Android and tech specs.   That being said, I actually believe that it's Google's fault for the mess of Lollipop upgrades. Lollipop was buggy up until the most recent release, and Samsung did the best they could to minimize costs by upgrading devices in waves. If Google had conducted more thorough UX and Front end bug testing similar to how they texted KitKat, they wouldn't have shipped lollipop with a huge ass memory leak to their flagship as well as software companies."

As an IT professional and gadget geek, I love the tinkering I can do with my note 4 (just wish a root method was available for the VZW model).  However, I definitely miss how the iPhones always 'just worked'.  My android frustrates me regularly.  95% of the time it runs great, then every now and then I get apps hanging and lag between screens.  I hit the home key and stare at my screen for 2-3 seconds before the app I'm in minimizes and I'm presented with my home screen.  That simply doesn't happen with iPhones.  Every android phone I've ever used eventually succumbs to the slow android death.  After a year of use, my LG G2 was so sluggish that I wanted to throw it.  Hard reboots were only temporary solutions and a factory reset should not be required every 3-4 months to keep the phone working at full speed.  My Note 4, after 6 months, has already started acting sluggish.  I'm about to perform a factory reset to try and get some speed back.  My wife's iPhone 6+, on the other hand, is just as fast as the day she bought it.  I watch her fly through screens and I get jealous.  Her phone works seamlessly with our car's stereo and hands-free calling as well as with our Polk audio home wifi sound system.  My android requires multiple more steps to do what her phone 'just does' and even then I'm regularly having to close apps and re-open them or toggle BT and Wifi multiple times before they'll 'recognize' the BT/WiFi devices I'm trying to connect them to.  I don't regret my Note 4 purchase, because there are many things I can do with the Note 4 that my wife can't with her iPhone 6+ (something as simple as the IR blaster is incredibly useful and I'd hate to be without it).  That being said, I'm seriously considering going back to iOS for my next phone.  I shouldn't have to work this hard to have a 90% success rate at tasks that the iPhone does automatically 100% of the time.  This... was much longer than I meant to type.  I guess I'm a little frustrated :)"

Its really unfortunate about that slow inevitable android death that seems to Happen to every Droid I've seen.  I've been meaning to do a factory reset on my note 4, it's been real sluggish with unread badges and hitting the home screen screen ever since the 5.0 update that I installed a few weeks back.  Problem is I can't find a convenient way to back up my phone!   I know they have apps that back up your stuff but even then I know those don't have 100% success rate every time.  That's one of the things that's pushing me back to ios aside from all the other things mentioned,  with ios,  all you do it plug it in to iTunes and hit ""back up""  and bam,  done.  You even get a hard copy of your back up that you can look at thru your computer  with new programs that allow you to do so.  Seems we have to take extra steps as android users to back EVERYTHING up which is a bit tedious if you ask me...  Cheers!"

I am not too worried about battery personally because I don't sleep with my watch on so, just like what I do with my regular watch, I'd put this beside my bed. It can recharge all night.   I am however not convinced that it'll add anything of substance to my day to day life.

I think what happens is that the camera app brings up the screen brightness so that you can easily see what you're taking a picture of, but after the picture is taken and you're previewing it, the auto brightness of the phone dims the screen. However, if you look at the picture with screen brightness turned up it should appear like it did when the picture was taken."

I'm a little bit salty that Samsung removed a lot of Lollipop features that I like: The 2-stage notification menu and multiple user accounts to name a few. I may go back to KK in the near future."

Both of those are still above my screen usage, though I will say that's not always the case. Most of the time my screen is at the top and that's when I get about 3 hours SOT with 6 hours on battery.   I've tried FireKat and CM12.1 with much of the same results. I had CM12.1 last and when the lollipop upgrade dropped I came back to stock because I thought my battery life would improve, but nope its exactly the same."
galaxynote4,37x5i0,StormDweller,2,Sun May 31 07:33:38 2015 UTC,Yeah if both of those are above your screen usage it's a software issue. I would suggest going back to kk stock if possible or trying Simplrom. I have the N910c with simplrom and have no battery issues atm.

Do you turn off WiFi when there is no WiFi around? Do you turn off data when you are connected to WiFi? What about your brightness settings? Turn off auto brightness and set it to low when you are not outside. This panel is super bright at low settings.  The battery will obviously drain like crazy if everything is running 24/7. You gotta be more proactive with your phone and turn on features only when you use them in order to conserve battery juice.  There is also a battery guide in the sidebar of this sub. Check it out. I usually average 7 1/2 hours SOT with 2 days on battery.  If that won't help, your phone is most likely faulty and needs to be replaced. :/ I hope they exchange it, since Knox has probably been triggered due to your use of custom ROMs. Good luck!"

galaxynote4,37umuh,Br1ghtest,12,Sat May 30 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"I was in this dilemma when i was about to buy this phone.  Cpu wise, exynos is faster than the 805, and also theoretically can run in 64 bit, although currently it is in 32 bit(there's a thread in xda about enabling 64 bit but so far no results achieved), also smaller manufacturing process (20 vs 28 nm)... But it comes at the expense of power consumption.. (According to anandtech the exynos uses more energy than the snapdragon one)  Gpu wise is where the snapdragon win.. Adreno 420 is more powerfull than mali t640 in the exynos, albeit not by many..  Radio is also where the snapdragon excel compared to the exynos.. The Qualcomm modem is more efficient than the st ericsson modem in the note 4   Audio wise is where the exynos win.. It has wolfson dac that will produce better sound quality than the generic dac used by qualcomm  Also people tend to say that the exynos one are more smoother in daily usage compared to the snapdragon one, but i can't really comment on this subject.  Lastly.. Developments.. As of now.. The snapdragon one has much more active community. I'm gonna use cm development as an example here. Snapdragon one have aosp android running quite stably and is enough for daily use.. Also with many people contributing to the development on the cm. On the exynos side it is much more gloomy.. We have already got cm up, but it is nowhere near stable for daily usage. And only one people are currently working on it. But on the bright side, s6 is all exynos and MAYBE we will enjoy some more support later..  So tl:dr is.. If you want aosp now,better battery life, and better gpu performance, go with the sd  If you wanna good audio and faster cpu and better day to day performance but less active community( for now) go with exynos  I myself wanted to get the snapdragon one but it is not available in my area, so in the end i ended up with the c version, and i'm quite satisfied, although i checked the cm dev thread very often times everyday to be disappointed by lack of development. Wanted to support the community myself but sadly no skill yet.."
galaxynote4,37umuh,A13xander,2,Sat May 30 16:29:21 2015 UTC,Good detailed explanations.   Here in Canada we get the Snapdragon. I like having a good radio and battery life but I miss the Wolfson DAC on my Note 2.   No good DAC on snapdragon note 4 and you can hear it in the audio.
galaxynote4,37umuh,THS89,1 point,Sat May 30 19:46:10 2015 UTC,"Well this is a game-changer. DAC is really important for me. Do you happen to know how is the Note 2's DAC (I have a Note 2 at the moment) compared to the Exynos Note 4? Also, how's the Snapdragon's DAC sound quality different? How is the volume from the headphones (I use Audio Technica M50 headphones)?"
galaxynote4,37umuh,THS89,3,Sun May 31 16:29:38 2015 UTC,The audio quality on the note 2 is tiny bit better because if the Wolfson DAC but note 4 with exynos isn't too bad.  I use the Audio Technica ATH-M50X (limited edition blue and bronze) and it sounds great.   Having good headphones is more important than the DAC difference between note 2 and 4.  I have no regrets upgrading from note 2 to snapdragon note 4.
galaxynote4,37umuh,THS89,1 point,Sun May 31 18:00:55 2015 UTC,"But the Exynos model has a newer Wolfson DAC, and is supposed to be even better than the Note 2's older Wolfson DAC. Or were you talking about the Snapdragon? (I have the red ATH-M50, though they're mainly used at home because of their size and long cable. On the go I use the Sennheiser Momentum On-Ears.)"
galaxynote4,37umuh,MiniMoose12,1 point,Sun May 31 21:09:05 2015 UTC,Talking about the snapdragon. We don't have exynos note 4's here in Canada (unless you import it I guess)
galaxynote4,37umuh,onbeskarakterli,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:43:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed comment. Any chance the Lollipop touchwiz stock rom is better on the 910C perhaps (better battery management, less lags)? Since it's their own CPU and all. Is the camera sensor the same on both versions?"
galaxynote4,37umuh,A13xander,5,Sat May 30 16:38:42 2015 UTC,"You wont get an answer to that unless someone has both models. Anyways, the best part about the exynos for battery saving is the fact that if you root it, you can make the ""bigger cores"" idle at 200mhz, using up WAAAY less battery.... I get 6hrs screen on time on a custom L rom and kernel. Other than that, stock tw on L is great, that is if you don't get the inconsistent and berserk battery life issues that seems to be happening on 1/3 of the Note 4's.... Allot of people have reverted to KK because of random hitches on L, even after trying all the fixes on earth. That being said, you won't really notice a difference between the Snapdragon and Exynos unless you're into rooting and modding."
galaxynote4,37umuh,Lucidmike78,2,Sat May 30 17:41:25 2015 UTC,Camera is the same. I never had problems with Lollipop but I do know my way around Android.   Both devices are almost identical. I bet most people wouldn't even realize if you gave them both of these devices and ask them to compare it.
galaxynote4,37umuh,A13xander,1 point,Sat May 30 17:43:03 2015 UTC,"I can't really comment on the stock rom situation on the snapdragon one.. But here in the exynos one, since update to lolipop we've been dealing with over aggressive throttling on the gpu, that leads to poor 3d performance and it cuts antutu score by 7000 points, but i think it has been fixed in the most recent release  Also i think on both side, many people report abysmal battery life after upgrading, android os being in the top of power consumption, and don't forget that piss poor memory management on the s6, it is here too.."
galaxynote4,37umuh,Butterman1997,1 point,Sun May 31 04:37:14 2015 UTC,Very good summary. So many people hate on exynos for the wrong and non-valid reasons.  This is the best summary I've read.   I prefer exynos myself although my note 4 battery life seems to be half of the snapdragons. I think what is best is if samsung just sticks to one cpu per model.  Either all exynos or all snapdragon. This is what made the note 2 great. Great app support. None of this selective app availability because small devs don't have the resources to test different varients of the same device.
galaxynote4,37umuh,A13xander,1 point,Sat May 30 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"I agree it would be best if samsung only use one cpu for a device model, like the s6.. Easier to develop, doesn't cause headache when buying (atleast for us that care though)..  About battery life.. I agree.. No matter how much people say the battery life is about the same, the exynos one is the more power hungry more in my opinion.. I average only 4 hours sot daily.. Max was 5,5 hours, i've greenified everything, use custom kernel and a little undervolting. The peoples on xda that brag about 2 days battery life or 8 hours sot are usually using the snapdragon one"

The performance gains you get from the exynos outweigh the tiny gain in battery life you get from snapdragon.  The SD lasts about 30-45 min longer than the Ex.....  big woop.   That's after spending the whole day lagging and stuttering with crappy sound (comparatively) on the SD.  I appreciate the extra time while on the go... but it really is not as enjoyable or smooth as the exynos in the office.

It destroys the coating on the phone that makes finger prints and and other smudges wipe away easier.  Nail polish remover is corrosive as well so it will slowly eat away at your phone.

Then I took it to the pool today to test it and it worked but 2 things I noticed that have me looking for something better:    When it is submerged I see airbubbles coming from one of the holes (the sound hole just to the right of the headphone jack).  I saw the same bubbles during my water test (without the phone but with tissue) as well but but since the tissue didn't get wet I tried it with my phone.  Long story short, my phone never got wet and I am not sure what is up with the bubbles coming from the hole but it makes me nervous.  I think I need to test that part more. While this may not be the cases fault but probably that of the touch screen sensitivity, when the screen is wet or submerged it goes all wonky like I am pushing all over the screen when I am not.  As a result, it was hard to actually use the phone underwater or with any water spots on the screen (it somehow called my wife twice while I was just holding it).  I think I will try again with the sensitivity settings turned down and see if that helps.   My main goal of the waterproof case is to just take photos and video underwater.  For now I am in the testing phase for this water case but so far I'm cautiously optimistic.  Hopefully someone will respond with something a little more ideal."

The reason I'm looking for a waterproof case is that my fiancée has the Lifeproof case on her iPhone 6 and it's really fun taking pictures in the pool (of my 6 month old).   I'm also looking forward to more responses! :)
galaxynote4,37r2y3,BigPoopBreakfast,2,Fri May 29 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"Your 'wonkiness' is just an inherent part of the way phone touch screens work -- until we come up with a fundamentally different way to register touch on a screen, you will never be able to interact with the touch screen while the phone is wet. Essentially, it can't tell the difference between your finger and the water."

But not the good ones, the 1/2 stars. See if there's a persistent issue with the product. There are other variables such as number of reviews. So, the one you linked has 4 Stat rating but high reviews, yet, it has only 16 people that reviewed. Moreover, YouTube the product. That can also help you decide.

You also need an NFC SIM card from Bell.  They are different from regular SIM cards but it should be a free upgrade.

I pay 58£ a month for contract and insurance getting unlimited 4G and 3g data 600 mins cross network 3000 three minuets 30000 texts a month (sms)  So far the phone has been great offering upto 14 hours battery with normal options on (bt wifi auto brightness nfc data and sync) with the phone spending more time in my pocket than in use.    I upgraded to lollipop using a German carrier to remove the Three UK branding and as they havnt released the OS yet! And the phone can now push 16 hours so lollipop has been an general improvement.   To increase response on the OS there is a guide to make things feel faster which i made some of the changes not all, deceasing animation times turning off that silly flip thing, disabling svoice and some of the geuestures I'll never use.  The phone I'm very happy with overall with it having the ocasional spaz out and stutter but what phone doesn't?   My next phone in 12 months will be the nexus as i dont fond myself using the s pen enough and to come away from touchwiz to a more vanilla OS.  I love the screen and the general day to day use of the phone being enjoyable.  I moves from a iphone 5 so the change was different to say the least taking me about a week to fully adjust and find which sms email and browser apps are best for me.  I have no intentions to root or change the firmware as in day to day usage the phone is great!   Would i recommend it? Yes the screen size and power alone are great. Would i buy it after the nexus 5?

Another drawback with the trusted device feature is that the range for it to unlock is, in my opinion, too far. I wish it could detect that the trusted device is within a one foot range of the phone. In other words, I don't like the idea that if I put my device down but remain in the ~30 foot range of the Bluetooth, anyone could just pick up my phone and unlock it.

galaxynote4,37j8ap,PatrioticParakeet,0,Thu May 28 04:18:26 2015 UTC,What's the point of the amp/really high end buds unless you only rip lossless off of CDs into your phone or something? Seems kinda silly for .mp3s or compressed .wavs. Do you have a lot of .flac files?
galaxynote4,37j8ap,beastgamer9136,5,Thu May 28 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"Flac files really aren't necessary to enjoy high end audio gear. I use 320kbps mp3, which me and many audiophiles agree is almost indistinguishable from flac in a majority of situations.  I have /r/headphones to thank for ending up with the setup in the first place. It all started with some Sennheiser HD558s. The upgrade itch kept appearing and I eventually ended up with HD800. Those aren't feasible for travel, so I was looking for something comparable to them, and I landed on the SE846. The C5D came later to eliminate the noise floor.  This may all sound wonky to most people, but once you start the headphone addiction, it is mighty hard to get out of it :)"
galaxynote4,37j8ap,mejogid,2,Thu May 28 04:14:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess as long as it isn't too compressed, anything over 320kpbs won't make a huge difference. Thanks for showing off your sick get-up."

galaxynote4,37j8ap,tekjester1,2,Thu May 28 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"I have never heard the Angie, so I can't really help you there.  The 846's sound decent coming straight out of the Note 4. They are incredibly sensitive IEMs, so there is a verrrrry high noise floor. You'll hear very aggressive background ""static"" when nothing is playing or when you're listening to a capella/delicate vocals. This is definitely not a problem exclusive to the Note 4; every phone I've tried with them does this. They are just that sensitive. It is certainly listenable, just not ideal if background static bothers you."

galaxynote4,37kam3,almosttan,3,Thu May 28 15:37:14 2015 UTC,Read this if you really want to know.  tl;dr this is normal.  Your phone seems to be charging per the photo you posted.  Is the percentage discharging as you use it while it's plugged in? Are you using it with the OEM charger + battery?  Nothing in what you posted indicates a virus.
galaxynote4,37kam3,almosttan,0,Thu May 28 09:13:47 2015 UTC,"I'm using the fast charger that came with the phone. It's completely charged right now and says I only have 4 hours left. I recently bought the Samsung cord to hook it to my TV which also charges it,  could that have ruined my battery? I've used that a lot over the last few days. I only asked about viruses because I just began using torrents (the last time I downloaded something limewire/morpheous was still a thing) and read that the site I was using was taken over by hackers (eztv)."
galaxynote4,37kam3,isaychris,2,Thu May 28 15:43:34 2015 UTC,Are you rooted? I think you have some rouge wake locks or something running. I don't think your battery would've degraded from anything you mentioned and your apps seem to be fine. I would look into wakelocks.

But as i look at the pics, I don't see anything out of the normal, looks like you were exploring your phone quite a bit which uses battery(especially with our 1440p displays). It didnt even start at 100% and you've been using it a lot AND you still have 26% left, that sounds good to me. Still, let it drain to zero and charge it all the way to 100%, after a couple days your battery should actually be a little bit better."

I've been reading on a lot of sites about how for the first few days the battery performance isn't that good. I've also read somewhere that transferring a SD card from a previous Android device causes the phone to rip through all the files for the first couple of days, which might be what's affecting the battery life.

I plan on getting a replacement Note 4 shortly because I shattered the camera glass, but I'd like to complete the upgrade on my old phone, then use CWM to transfer everything to my new device."
galaxynote4,37gmsf,MiniMoose12,3,Wed May 27 14:32:43 2015 UTC,So it looks like the n910t is the qualcom snapdragon version.. right? So what you need to do if you want to flash stock Lolipop is goto this site http://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/ enter in your model number (N910T) and download the firmware for the 5.0.1 closest to your country(don't worry you can change the language on first boot). After that' flash it through Odin..... don't have repartition checked. Make sure you factory reset atleast once to get rid of any inconsistent bugs people have been experiencing. Enjoy :3 but you're going to have to reroot because it's the stock firmware.
galaxynote4,37gmsf,MiniMoose12,1 point,Wed May 27 14:40:57 2015 UTC,"So this process won't wipe my data? A factory reset won't wipe my data either? Or does it, I just have to backup and then restore after the factory reset?   Thanks for your response!"
galaxynote4,37gmsf,MiniMoose12,3,Wed May 27 14:41:50 2015 UTC,"You want it to wipe your data IMO. Your updating the base android version. Better to start fresh instead of having 2 things screw it all up. Very few people have got it to update (bugless) without factory resetting. Flashing the update could reset or not reset your data. I forget if it does. Backup your contacts to Google and make a list of your favorite apps somewhere. Factory resetting after you update is going to help allot with random bugs. Just trust me when  I say you want to factory reset lol. Flash the update and if it didn't delete your stuff, cool try it out, but not factory resetting could result in weird bugs like battery being eaten in half the time, apps closing and a whole load of random stuff that is inconsistent.  Just do it. Other than that, enjoy ;p. Make a backup before you do it if you want. It will restore it just by downloading the apps manually in the background of the start up screen locking you out of the phone for 20 minutes. Or you could just do it yourself. Your choice ;o."
galaxynote4,37gmsf,MiniMoose12,2,Wed May 27 15:14:28 2015 UTC,Also doing this will unroot and you will have to flash cf autoroot again... I wouldn't get cwm... twrp is more widely supported :p
galaxynote4,37gmsf,Jennica,2,Wed May 27 16:55:56 2015 UTC,"If you want anything custom and pre rooted like simplrom etc. You're going to need to install twrp recovery. After that just download a rom from xda or wherever (make sure it's for your model or it could brick your device). Put it on a SD card. Boot into twrp, make a backup then while everything(besides the SD card). Then just install the .zip and after 2 minutes you should reboot into whatever rom you found."

I wanted to wait until this Fall, but T-Mobile had $100 off the Nexus 6 and offered me more than expected for the trade ($328, but Sprint has it for $348, so they will give you $328 + $20 match + $50 for trade-in guarantee)."

It just bugs me too much. That and the idiotic touchwiz. It is the ugliest skin for android that I have ever seen which manages to make a top phone feel like an upper mid tier one.

Recently updated to Lollipop, about 3 weeks maybe, no regrets, battery life just as good, if not better, than Kitkat, did not do a factory reset.  The ONLY downside is the recent button lag, which despite turning down window animation in developer option etc etc , still takes a second or so before the list of apps show, but I rarely uses the recent button so /shrug"

galaxynote4,37giox,MiniMoose12,2,Wed May 27 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"Never used any of them, however my view is that coming from a S3, I could not possibly see myself going back to a smaller phone. And the s-pen functions + the multiwindow from Samsung is really what set this phone apart from other phatlets, I don't know whether G4 have similar features or not"
galaxynote4,37giox,MiniMoose12,2,Wed May 27 21:58:47 2015 UTC,"If you're for a well rounded powerhouse phone the note 4 is the king. If you want the Android experience without the stylus without hard buttons, get the g4. Want the aosp experience?  Get the nexus 6. Want the bad upgrade and not worth your time experience? Get the m9"
galaxynote4,37giox,MiniMoose12,2,Wed May 27 14:28:08 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness either models of the note 4 are great. You aren't going to notice a tangible difference going with either cpu setup. That being said, the note 4 is an excellent well rounded phone. If you want to get rid of 99% of the stock touch wiz lag just root it and get a debloated rom. I'm using it and this has to be one of the most buttery smooth devices I've ever owned. On the other hand the g4 is looking snazzy if you aren't interested in a stylus.. :]"
galaxynote4,37giox,MiniMoose12,1 point,Wed May 27 14:50:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks though I doubt I'll be rooting the Note 4 in the first 2 years, as it's against the warranty's policy here and I don't want to void it. How does that affect the answer? still remains the same?"
galaxynote4,37giox,MiniMoose12,2,Wed May 27 18:15:28 2015 UTC,"Still is great, won't be 100% lag free but still will be smooth 98% of the time. It's a great phone rooted or not. As I said before both versions perform pretty much the same. You can look at benchmarks all you want and the exynos will be a fraction behind the single core qualcom, but after using both. I can say there is literally no difference."
galaxynote4,37giox,Fartsss,1 point,Wed May 27 18:17:12 2015 UTC,What about development and custom roms? Is there a huge difference in the attention the version gets from developers?
galaxynote4,37giox,a5ph,2,Wed May 27 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all the rom are based off of the original touch wiz atm. There is some development for the phone when it comes to themeing and stuff but it really is sparse. You have to hunt for the good stuff. Samsung made promises to keep this device up to date for software but not for long. I think the note 4 will rest on 5.1 which is rumored to come out soon this year. Other than that I can't say much. There is allot you can do with rooting, but it's nowhere exploding with developers like the nexus 6 etc."

Reception and screen brightness/color are the main culprits for bad battery life. Keep a black colored wallpaper and brightness off auto and you can easily keep the phone alive with moderate use for a few days."

Unless you buy it from Samsung.com or as part of a bundle promo from best buy, chances are it's a fake from China. It probably does work as  a charger, I'm not denying that. But it won't be to spec and might have other issues.   It has nothing to do with being burned by fakes and everything to do with knowing corporate policy and the realities of the electronics accessories market. Go take a gander at Best Buy (Samsung's largest partner)-- they have chargers from an GS5 bundle and one from a Note Tablet, but aside from that.... They only sell third party chargers.   It's cool if you want to keep insisting on something you know nothing about. But you really should stop giving people advice like you know what you're talking about.

Even best buy only has one or two that don't necessarily hit the full amperage for the larger devices / quick charge, etc. So they don't even have them.   The vast majority sold on Amazon for example are rebranded generic Micro USB chargers, not Samsung genuine.   Good luck."

Feels like I sleep better at night too (they say that blue light like what comes from electronics screens disrupts melatonin production and causes more restless sleep )
galaxynote4,37ebqc,pugslington,2,Wed May 27 05:36:40 2015 UTC,Also throwing out Twilight for screen dimming/red filter apps. It was pretty simple and easy to use.
galaxynote4,37ebme,kturtle17,5,Wed May 27 00:25:07 2015 UTC,"The Note 4's screen is approximately .2 inches bigger than the Note 2. I'm a heavy set male that wears nothing but jeans and it fits in my pocket just fine.  The battery life is fine for me, especially since I spend most of my day in work so it doesn't get much play. The charger it comes with activates Quick Charge, which gets an estimated 0-50% charge in half hour.  (Quick Charge must be selected under the Battery settings menu)"
galaxynote4,37ebme,rbarton812,3,Wed May 27 00:47:42 2015 UTC,You will notice a huge boost in speed. I was getting frustrated when updating apps because it would lag hard. Note 4 does it with no problem. Overall I love my note 4.
galaxynote4,37ebme,I_CAN_DRAW_THING,2,Wed May 27 01:04:56 2015 UTC,I also went from the Note 2 to the Note 4 and there's barely a difference in how it feels in my pocket size wise. Sure it is thinner so that helps overall if your previous phone fit well then this one will too. Battery life is excellent especially if you do root stuff but even stock is pretty solid.
galaxynote4,37ebme,BarneyStinsbro,2,Wed May 27 01:04:04 2015 UTC,"I have a case on my note 2 but not on my note 4, so my note 4 is actually smaller to me. My girlfriend still uses my note 2. She loves it. They are both great phones. The finger print and S Health on the note 4 are nice, and quicklaunch via the stylus is nice too. The body is much more ""premium"" as well. The 4 is way faster. Charges a lot faster too. And you get Lollipop.  Edit: oops, didn't see you already had the note 2. You can ignore everything below this  Keep in mind that if you are on Verizon, the note 2 will have a Verizon tramp stamp squeezed ONTO the home button. It is ugly as shit. It made me want to return the phone before leaving the store. I didn't even use the phone until my home button sticker came 3 days later. Call me petty but that shit pisses me off to no end.  The note 4 is beautiful and only has the ugly verizon logo on the back panel, which of course I immediately replaced out of spite."

galaxynote4,37ebme,cuteman,2,Wed May 27 13:31:50 2015 UTC,"I have a note 2 right now and my contract ends in a matter of weeks. I'm looking to getting a note 4. How well does it run?   Depends on your carrier but if you do a new boot now, you'll miss most of the problems that came from upgrading to 5.0.x with data and apps on the phone. A lot of people recommend a hard reset. (I never really had issues.)   Is the bloatware just as bad?   The vast majority is uninstallable.    Is the size a significant difference?    Negligible. The note 2 feels more plasticy and less sturdy. The note 4 is probably slightly bigger and heavier but feels a lot more solid and premium in your hand. The chamfered edges are a nice touch.    How is the battery life?    Great for me.    How good is the gps?   Fastest I've ever used. That should definitely be true coming from a note 2.   Less important questions include: how is the camera focus   Very quick. Unless you let the gallery get huge and also night time focusing.    and How responsive is the stylus?   The note 4 is has twice as many layers of sensitivity as the note 3 which was at least 2x the note 2. So significantly better.   Overall it's a great phone. Get it. Consider the Gear VR too. That thing is pretty awesome. I bet they'll start discounting them soon as the note 5 gets closer."

Using data(navigation) can just make the phone discharge faster than normally while charging it. IMO you should just replace it and call it a day. If it persists, it's a software issue but that's HIGHLY improbable.  EDIT: Removable batteries isn't just a benefit for people with multiple batteries.

I should've read your post thoroughly the first time, my mistake man. Sounds like you have a bum adapter. I know you already spent a good 15$ on a battery (that you will hopefully swap out for a ""fresh charge"", making a spare isn't bad), but you might have to buy a new wall/car-adapter. If you're looking for a QuickCharge 2.0 one I would suggest this Anker one on Amazon Different adapters put out different amounts of power for that specified device. I have quiet a few adapters in my house but they are all too ""new"" to show a difference in charging performance. if you do try this route and it doesn't work, there is only one thing left that is something wrong with the phone internally. In which case you would either have to get it repaired through Samsungs' 1-2 year warranty, or get it fixes 3rd party. It is a fairly expensive phone, and I don't know what in the world caused this to happen, but just try this one last thing and see if it works. Best of luck!"

The annoying part is lining it up to charge. Since the battery for the note is offset, you don't just center the phone on the pad like my S3, you have to line it up just right, and it's tricky to find. I had to draw lines on my Qi pads to make sure I was actually charging each time I set the phone down. The S3 was just set it center and forget it.  Still worth it, just not as user friendly as it could be."

Don't constantly kill the running apps unless their apps you don't use often, try and keep a dark wallpaper. The screen on the note 4 turns off pixals if the colour is black, and off pixals means no battery usage. Keeping the brightness off auto helps as well. Setting it to a comfortable brightness for you and just keeping it there saves a lot compared to the screen adjusting constantly. Location is also a major factor. If the phone has to keep searching for service, even with the screen off, it'll burn through the battery life. When I'm at work I have to airplane mode my phone as it sits in a metal locker underground lol.

I'm using Snap camera due to the stock app's slowness transitioning from camera to gallery (which I do a lot of) and anything indoors looks like shit - it's so grainy and over-sharpened. For example, this pic of my dog is fine viewed very small, but it looks terrible if you zoom in at all and notice the heavy grain, particularly on her tongue or nose and eyes. There's got to be a way to get rid of the over-sharpening at least (the setting is minimalized in the Snap app, but it doesn't fix everything.  Also, there's a really odd issue with color / white balance - things never look at all right, the white balance is way out of whack. For example, this photo has a circle tinted blueish green that is certainly not the lighting or the app - both apps do it. Wtf?"

I would think not, so if you're using Snap Camera that would be why - try taking a shot with the stock camera and Snap Camera and comparing. A big reason why Note 4 photos look so good is because of the behind the scenes processing, that's why the CyanogenMod camera looks so good."

galaxynote4,37d6cm,Azara1th,1 point,Tue May 26 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"How to get better image quality: Start by understanding how good its camera really is. Compare it to any film cameras and their high noise negatives. Polaroid. Compact cameras with a small sensor (every compact with a sensor smaller than 1 inch). Except for some specialty cases, the Note 4 will come out favorably in significant ways. Now understand that in good light, you can compare it to almost anything you want (again, except in specialty cases like tilt+shift lenses or macro or tele) and it'll at least be competing.  What follows is the understanding that you can treat this like any other camera. Instead of looking at apps (which are sure to make your picture look worse compared to the built in camera app) try to think of it as a tool for photography. And at yourself as photographer. Use the following to create compelling pictures: Interesting subject, composition, isolation, separation, focus, perspective.  Realize that good photographers even with the best cameras for the most part are willing to use proper off camera lighting (either flash or constant light). The latter, off camera constant light sources, are available to ""phone photographers"" too yet noone seems to interested in using them.  I realize that setting up external lights can be cumbersome. But you did ask how to actually get better pictures right?  TLDR; if DSLR users use light, why do you think your phone camera wouldn't benefit from that too?"

galaxynote4,37aapk,inflatablegoo,3,Tue May 26 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"Officially, Sprint cares. But, when you return your lease, it's up to the person you return it to (read: ~minimum wage retail employee) to check its condition, and they're probably only looking for broken glass or obvious signs of tampering. If you factory reset you'll probably pass inspection without any problems.   On top of that, they're probably also looking to make a sale from you, so even if they noticed (doubtful), they'd probably look the other way to get you into a new lease agreement."
galaxynote4,37aapk,tasko,1 point,Tue May 26 05:24:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, the only entity that cares about Knox is Samsung.  So if you're sending your device into your carrier, or better yet, hitting up their retail branch, then yea you'll most likely get a minimum wage slave looking for obvious signs of abuse - tripped water stickers (they'll be red/pink/purple w/cross hatch pattern), cracks, etc.   They also don't care too much about scratches (AFAIK w/Tmobile)  since whoever gets the phone next knows its a preowned/return.   If it meets all criteria but they don't like it, they could always send it in to Samsung to refurb it to mint condition."

galaxynote4,37aapk,CFigus,1 point,Tue May 26 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"I believe I read in a pamphlet at one of their stores that they don't care about rooting. I was curious because my previous phone was an s3. When they finally called me in the queque, I was confidant that they wouldn't care. I honestly didn't think it would matter at all because I was buying a new phone (the Note 4) anyway.  The employee asked me if I wanted to trade-in my s3 towards the purchase price of the Note. I had planned on keeping it, but suddenly was interested in the prospect of saving a little cash. I said, ""Well, sure, the phone is rooted, though."" The employee was like, ""Don't tell me that! Now, I have to pretend I didn't hear that."" I replied, ""What? Your very own pamphlet says you don't care if it's rooted."" She explained that they'd still fix my phone if it was rooted, but that they offer less trade-in value for a rooted s3 over a non-rooted one."

galaxynote4,377d80,nechered,7,Mon May 25 14:06:58 2015 UTC,I hate to be a Debbie Downer but I feel that the reason they only offer this edge to edge version in white is because the fact that it is painted white hides that there are still halos of on the edges
galaxynote4,377d80,shane2811,1 point,Mon May 25 23:56:36 2015 UTC,Agreed. Someone came in to my work and had a black one on... probably not the same  brand but the only thing I could think was it was how dope it was to use the color do cover the halo. If they made any color that'd be cool too.

galaxynote4,377d80,shane2811,1 point,Tue May 26 19:15:05 2015 UTC,Well even if they offered it in black it would probably be painted and would cover up the dust too.

galaxynote4,377d80,tbmny,1 point,Tue May 26 19:11:42 2015 UTC,I've decided to get the other one you linked because it would support bumper cases. I have the neo hyrbid metal case and the fact that it doesn't cover the entire front side makes it compatible with pretty much any bumper case. I think the halo you got around the home button was from placing it down too low. There was more room by the speaker cutout for you to move it up. Thanks for the heads up on this one though.
galaxynote4,377d80,noremac258,1 point,Tue May 26 18:18:37 2015 UTC,I don't use bumper cases (very limited availability here in Norway) so I was not able to test. the oher type was I bit difficult to put in place (however I truly suck at that stuff) and I know it was skewed (one of the reasons I liked this version as is very easy to put on). But as mentioned it did save my phone when it took a fall.

I tried making a weekly sticky, which worked great for 2 weeks, but it was hard to enforce people to only post in that thread, and people stopped posting in it all together.  And when people did post in the weekly sticky threads, nobody actually looked at other people's pictures because they just wanted to post their own and leave the thread. So most comments only had 1 or 2 upvotes, which was discouraging for the photographers.  So, sadly, I can't really do much about this. Vote with your upvotes; if the photo posts keep being loved by most people, they'll keep getting upvoted. I think that's fair, if people didn't like the pictures, they wouldn't upvote them."

I just don't understand how pictures that could be taken with any phone or device relate so heavily back to the note. Seems like a lot of clutter to me.

galaxynote4,3751sy,MiniMoose12,1 point,Tue May 26 00:03:01 2015 UTC,Hmm I'm testing my tweaks now. I have 2 spare batteries so it's not really a troublesome thing for me. This app showed me a few things like calander syncing for Google happens allot etc. I've disabled allot of things on the Google sync settings that I don't use etc. Currently at 2hr screen on time at 45%. Maybe it's just the version of ultimate kernal I have.... I'm going to look into upgrading/downgrading ultimate kernal. Bad battery life only happened after I changed from simplkernel (the one that comes with simplrom) to ultimate kernal v31.1 and it was a pain just to find that because the dev for it was banned from xda.. I had find it on the simplrom teams Google+.... Found the original thread on some Russian site but the download link was down.....
galaxynote4,3751sy,MiniMoose12,2,Tue May 26 16:46:51 2015 UTC,"I had the same issues. Ultimate Kernel is breaking SimplRom's CPU governor. Normally CPU regulates its speed depending on your usage. Open Synapse and go to CPU GOV tab. Change both A53 and A57 to ""interactive"". Then go to IO tab and be sure it is set to ""noop"", ""row"" or ""cfq"". I had reset problems with others. Check ""apply on boot"" from Synapse settings. That is it. You can also lower your minimum CPU core speeds from CPU FREQ tab. It will give you less battery drain when your phone is idle."

Just want to try out the themes because I want a different look for the notification panel (even though the normal one looks pretty good too). I'm on the AT&T Note 4 so I can't root right now unfortunately. Hopefully it'll come out soon. And I also hope lollipop 5.1 will fix some of the minimal lag I see when using the phone.   Has anyone noticed that opening apps is a bit slower on lollipop? For me the apps take about 2 seconds longer to open than when it was on kitkat. It's kinda weird and definitely noticeable. I was under the impression that they would open faster."

Before you get excited, you must be rooted and you must be using a custom kernel which includes what I am about to mention.   After using Simplite ROM, I realised recent apps is really smooth on this ROM. I installed Ultimate Kernel and it began to lag. Kernel comes with Synapse and it loads pre-defined settings while booting. I looked into it. After trying different CPU governors and i/o schedulers, I managed to make it smooth again.  It is the i/o scheduler. cfq makes the phone lag which is default. SimplRom uses noop which is smooth. I couldn't get a good UI performance with recommended schedulers like zen or sio. noop and row is quite good.  Bioshock and interactive work good with Note 4 as CPU governors."

The reason the top of your screen is lighter is because of the status bar. It's black in almost every app, so it doesn't get used nearly as often.

That means all of the chargers on batteries on Amazon and elsewhere are not authentic.   It only makes sense when chargers are $40. At 50% off there is no reason to not buy genuine OEM."

galaxynote4,36sags,Tsuki4735,1 point,Thu May 21 22:47:45 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, don't quote me on this;  I remember there being there being a similar sounding feature in a dell laptop I recently configured for someone. The option was in the bios and if enabled, would require a password to reinstall the OS, if you wanted to reinstall Windows through the laptop, without taking it apart and just re-imaging the hard drive.  AFAIK when enabled it also would not allow the machine to boot on an unauthorized OS install, i.e.  one that wasn't installed through the laptop.   This sounds like an anti theft feature where if someone stole your phone, (and sprint declared it lost/stolen/black listed?) the thief would not be able to do a straight forward factory reset; (or if they did, there would be some tracking persistence?) I imagine they would still have no issue using Odin to reflash a ROM.   I'm not sure if this is valid but I'm simply drawing a comparison between Dell's anti theft features and what I perceive to be Sprint's implementations of said tech."

My general battery time is great, but there are times where something, somewhere will drain the life out of my battery, could be google play, android system, android OS or recently, whatsapp, and all the time, the only common factor will be bad signal, be it wifi or mobile. Lack of signal isn't the problem, its the kinda there, kinda not signal drop that causes it. You have mention wifi is disable so I can only assume mobile data coverage isn't great.  Battery could be poorly calibrated, although usually in those circumstance you tend to have 30% one second then 0% the next, but it could also in some case mean faster than usual consumption.  Lastly, return the phone to carrier or samsung for a new one, the phone should not be down to 50% with 1hr screen time and what I assume to be 5-6hrs idle, it could be something like bad antenna causing the phone to constantly searching for signal therefore draining the battery, just make sure you completely overstate your problem to carrier/samsung to have a replacement or something"

Similarly, do you re-install all the old apps you were using?  You might just be putting the offending process(es) right back onto your phone.  Try running with only the stock apps for a while after a reset, and see if the battery problem continues. Do you ever kill apps from the recents menu?  I know people often think that this stops background processes from running - but it can be worse for battery overall, as the next time you open the app, it has to load everything back up, instead of resuming it from a suspended state."

galaxynote4,36snwi,nathan_NG,1 point,Thu May 21 21:21:12 2015 UTC,"Most changes are design changes anyway..   Heh if only that were completely true, I like to think of Android L as those huge ass lollipops they sell almost as a novelty item, the ones with a diameter larger than most hands.   Sure they're nice to look at but try actually using it for its intended purpose, you're gonna look silly and awkward trying to utilize it for its intended purpose - both android L and the IRL lollipop.   What I'm referring to is of course the memory leaks.  (AFAIK this is prevalent on Touchwizz in addition to CM12, not sure if they fixed this in CM12.1/ 5.1)  I have experienced these first hand and so has everyone else who keeps track of RAM usage.  Basically when you kill all your apps and expect the ram to be clear of anything extraneous besides the OS, and critical system apps like radio controller, launcher, etc. When you have seemingly cleared all nonessential processes, you will note that you have some silly ~1 GB (or less!) out of the 3gb remaining when the phone is idle.   Also there's the battery life, its mainly hit or miss, some people swear they get 8hrs, some even boast some ridiculous figure like 11-12hrs of phone uptime.   To me this seems far fetched and frankly I am practically convinced that some unscrupulous individuals may have done some software modifications to solely achieve this goal by rendering the phone unusable slow; like a drastic under clock/under volt or other things in this nature to purposefully achieve these uptimes. (Perhaps to later get karma for it?)   I hope I'm wrong since I haven't updated my cm12/ 5.0.1 nightly rom since late March. It's been running stable so far, with the only gripes being battery life; if it wasn't for the über quick, fast charging, I'd have probably updated a while ago."

It lasted another hour until I got home and plugged in.    I think the Note 4 on Lollipop has awesome battery life, but I'm coming from a Nexus 5 so what do I know."

I probably took my phone of the charger around 8:30 am and was at 1% at 1am with heavy use.    This is a t-mobile variant, rooted. I also went through and disabled all apps that were running 100% of the time, which pretty much means Facebook and Facebook messenger. I switched to tinfoil."

Or wait it out?    I've noticed MORE of a drain, but it hasn't been debilitating. I used to be able to use my phone all day watching videos and browsing the internet. By the time I would get to bed it would sit around 40-50% battery. Post update, I can bring it down to the single digits before bed."
galaxynote4,36snwi,Lokisraven,1 point,Fri May 22 20:11:02 2015 UTC,That your call you can always downgrade if your rooted and have TWRP installed with a backup. In on lolipop right now and while I miss Xposed most of all. having a smoother phone is more worth it to me also no Battery drain here.. On a Tmoble note 4  You will need Xposed Installer and the Snapshare module. But this also means staying on 4.4 to use this...  If your staying on 4.4 I love FireKatN4  is my favorite. All the 5.0 roms feel the same...

Mine shows it's off and all the toggles and switches stay off, but it is actually on, and shows in both the battery stats in settings and in Gsam battery monitor as being on. Gsam says it uses anywhere between 18 -20% of my battery.  I just turned off VoLTE and it looks like that has allowed it to finally turn off wifi, so that might help with your problem too."

galaxynote4,36s7nq,PapercutOnYourAnus,1 point,Thu May 21 20:54:51 2015 UTC,My note 4 does that. It happens when I leave home without turning off my wifi.

galaxynote4,36rfez,shark01,2,Thu May 21 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"When i had my S3 this method worked to enable tethering. It does require root. The issues is that root is still not quite there for the AT&T version.  I am actually also on an unlimited plan with AT&T, but i bought a T-mobile unlocked Note 4 to use with my AT&T sim. With this version i was actually able to tether right out of the box. You may want to look into doing something like this, if you can sell your ATT note 4 and buy a T-mobile one you may not end up spending too much money."
galaxynote4,36rfez,1normalsolution,1 point,Thu May 21 17:05:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I will keep this in mind. The T-Mobile editions do appear to be a bit cheaper than the samsung factory phones with no carrier branding at all, and I hadn't even considered getting a T-Mobile edition to use on AT&T before. I got my Note 4 with a contract extension with AT&T for $127 new! I probably could sell the phone for a bit more than that and spend that money towards another Note 4!  That said, I'm a cheapass and will likely just hold out and hope for something I can do with the phone I already have or use my iPhone for tethering by swapping the SIM card between phones, but if I do get truly desperate I now know of this backup option. Thanks again for your input!"
galaxynote4,36rfez,1normalsolution,2,Thu May 21 17:32:50 2015 UTC,"No problem! If you do ever want to go the sell and buy rout check out swappa to see what phones are going for.

I had considered the Nexus 6 too, yes, but I narrowed my top picks down to the Xperia Z3 and the Note 4. The Note 4 I could get subsidized by AT&T so that became my choice mostly on that ground.  All that said I was able to get my Note 4 for $127 new and glancing at a few websites it looks like the Nexus 6 would be in the $200-250 range with a subsidy from an AT&T contract extension. I just don't see myself switching to it. Thanks for your input though!"
galaxynote4,36rfez,rjohnson5481,2,Fri May 22 19:20:58 2015 UTC,Sorry but there is not root for the AT&T Note 4 that can survive a reboot. Not yet anyway...
galaxynote4,36rfez,madcowbomber,1 point,Thu May 21 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply!  Is there anything that works if you never power down or reboot your phone? In the 9 days I've owned this phone I've yet to reboot it for any reason and the batter has never run out on me. I'd be more than happy to try a solution that I have to set up each time I turn my phone on! It's better than nothing, and I'd rarely have to do it as I rarely turn my phones off!  My only extra question on this, but if it's unknown I could always test it myself to find out, is does setting your phone to emergency mode or back from emergency mode count as a reboot that would break such a root? I think that is a feature that I'll enjoy using to prolong batter life on long trips, so I'm just curious if that would kill the root."

When I bought it it didn't come with a cable, so I can't speak for the quality of that, but I'd assume that would work too since the company is selling it with the charger that is meant for the quick charge 2.0.   I have found that cables can be a problem though. I have a quick charge 2.0 car charger and battery pack too, and some cables just won't work at all. I think it has to do with the D+ and D- ports being terminated internally rather than used, but I'm not positive about that."
galaxynote4,36rsvm,kohoboy,2,Thu May 21 17:16:53 2015 UTC,You can use any cable however you have to use that end block to get that adaptive fast charging. It will say it on the block itself! Hope this helps!

The note 4 is great atm, I just wish they had a little prettier software than touchwiz lol. I've used touchwiz lollipop in the past with my galaxy s4, but over never really got to see how other android software looked like astray from fire OS and the HTC series.

Was able to restore it to stock software and give to my mom as a magazine reader lol. I never thought about restoring it or anything like that when I first rooted it back in 2011. I just followed a guide on how to root it and it recommended a backup and I just did it.

galaxynote4,36q0d1,Butterman1997,0,Mon May 25 14:44:18 2015 UTC,That first picture is awful. Looks like there is a smudge on the lens and the very top portion is overexposed badly. That's not an ideal shot to take in the first place because of the location of the light source. The second picture is okay. There are lot of artifacts on the black stripes of the mask (or whatever it is). The 3rd pic isn't bad at all.
galaxynote4,36q0d1,onbeskarakterli,3,Thu May 21 22:19:02 2015 UTC,The best ROM I have found so far for the Exynos varient is Simplite v3C.   http://forum.xda-developers.com/note-4/development/rom-simplrom-v2-t3034419  It is heavily debloated. You need to install some of the system apps manually that you will use. They are under Rom Flashables. Also you can install mods created for SimplRom itself.  The ROM is really fast. I haven't used a faster ROM than this one.
galaxynote4,36q0d1,mindofmateo,2,Thu May 21 11:12:33 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more! That is my favorite ROM and my daily driver. I've been using it since v3 came out and it's been great since then. I use Ultimate Kernel v29.2 along with it which removes the GPU throttling issues, so the speed is increased tremendously."
galaxynote4,36q0d1,onbeskarakterli,1 point,Thu May 21 14:56:43 2015 UTC,It is fast. Like Nexus fast. You can see other added features from the link. I can't speak for the battery life because I have been using it for a few days and I added or removed a lot of stuff in those days. So it wasn't my normal usage but it seemed really good. At least battery drain when I was sleeping was 3% for 6 hours. I say try it and see if you are going to like it.

I verified with sprint the ESN was clean and contacted the guy back and told him to go ahead and send the phone back to me, and after I verified it was the same phone I sent him (included a photo of the ESN label) I'd refund his money.

Especially how impossible it was for me to get the side strips on so they actually lined up with everything (just like you show in your pictures, but from day one). And of course they peel off over time, just a little piece of dirt gets in there and starts wedging the sticker off so more dirt can get in and continue the process.  I feel like dBrand was pretty heavily virally marketed here on reddit and has a significant fan base that it doesn't necessarily deserve. They charge you like $10 for a sticker. They look OK, they feel OK, they work OK, they aren't a bad product, but I just think it's on a circlejerk level around here. It's a sticker that you put on your phone. Enjoy."

galaxynote4,36m04g,lightbendr9001,1 point,Wed May 20 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"I used a slickwraps skin on my device, keeping it on for about a month and it looked kick ass, I had the silver carbon fiber all around, using a hairdryer to apply it properly.  Although I never really liked how the display sticker looked due to the bezels being thin, and so the sticker had even thinner ""bezels"".   The edges never slid by themselves, only when I attempted to use any case whatsoever. After a while I got tired of carrying my note 4 commando style, always worrying about scratching DAT soft metal frame/chamfered edge   Now I'm rocking a bumper case to protect those scratch prone edges.  However it may be a good idea to look into eventually replacing the frame itself (not too difficult) and you could very easily boost resale value by getting a different colored one for a nice contrast. Something like white screen and gold frame, or b&w theme, or w/e you like. Maybe even give the buyer an option to get a custom color scheme going on.   I applied heat from hairdryer once again and began the process of gentle removal  I now have all the stickers back on the wax paper they came attached to, all but the camera cutout, and the rear cover sticker, since they are unaffected and only get stronger with time.  Also they look very fresh, providing a nice contrast to the housing's charcoal black.   So here's my advice to anyone looking to get a skin for their note 4  • Be aware that the edges will slide around and probably get damaged when applying/removing cases.   • It is not physically possible to use a tempered glass protector with the sticker for the screen, and have it look decent. (at least not the new ones that don't have that halo effect and only cover the flat surfaces of the screen, rather than overlapping to the 2.5D edges)   Perhaps if you get a tempered glass protector that does cover the rounded edges, you could first apply the skin to it, and then apply the glass+skin to the phone (haven't tried this).   • Your best bet, in you want a skinned look, would be to simply buy a new back cover, like carbon fibre, or of other materials, colors, textures, etc. Just don't buy a metal one since that would negatively affect your signal, since most antennas are in the back of the phone.   •Alternatively, if you are able to acquire only the rear stickers for the camera and rear cover, then go for it since it adds a fresh appearance to the back of your note.  This allows you to get a few backs and make them custom for various occasions, if you so desire.   Keep in mind that the back is what everyone else will be looking at as you use the Quad Note.   I prefer to think of the front of a phone, especially something as sizable as the note, to be like the interior of a car, what you will be looking at 99% of the time, but the rear is what everyone else will be viewing.  Keep that in mind, depending what look you're going for, be it stealth, flashiness, or just a unique look."

Took over a month for iphone 6/6S screen support, they STILL haven't released the material Android app through the play store (.apk only), and I'm sure it wil be months befoer they make the app compatible with the Watch.

I can't compare them because I haven't used Snapdragon version.   All I know is you can install AOSP ROMs if you can root it with SD. The biggest downside of the AOSP ROMs is camera quality.

galaxynote4,36hjbt,onbeskarakterli,1 point,Tue May 19 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is stock Android. There are Touchwiz based ROMs and AOSP based ROMs. AOSP is lighter and faster but it doesn't have Samsung's optimizations for the hardware which means worse battery life, worse performing camera, etc.  I am using a debloated Touchwiz ROM and very happy with it. You need to root and know how to install a custom ROM though. There are tutorials you can look at. In some countries rooting means losing your warranty so it is a big no for some people.  Edit:  Vodafone in your country uses FDD-LTE B5. I checked and either varients support it.   http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/mobile_phone_frequencies  http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=55937000&postcount=2 (not an official reply but I suppose it is correct.)"

I thought it is impossible as of kitkats policy against sd card which would also apply to lollipop.   I just really wished there was a 64gb version of the Note 4. 32gb isn't enough imo"

galaxynote4,36fktx,ZineZ,6,Tue May 19 00:20:06 2015 UTC,This is caused by the CPU going too far into rest mode when the screen is off and wifi is on. the BT radio gets choked.  The solution is to root your phone and use a governor like Tasker to up the minimum CPU frequency when BT is on.  The workaround for an unrooted phone is to turn your wifi off or leave the screen on.
galaxynote4,36fktx,Caelrie,2,Tue May 19 04:14:27 2015 UTC,hold on. switching your wifi off by itself fixes the problem? including in a car?
galaxynote4,36fktx,Caelrie,2,Tue May 19 04:42:50 2015 UTC,"It should, yes. This is assuming you're not just having some sort of incompatibility issue (the issue would only show up in your car and not on any BT headphones if that's it)."

Right now, it's temporary - meaning you lose root on reboot.  For a lot of people. they are losing root after 30-45 minutes.  You can do some things, like remove bloatware, but persistent apps like greenify or adaway aren't going to be useful.    Long way to go to achieve permanent root, this sucker is locked hard, but we're moving hard in the right direction!"
galaxynote4,36dpdj,tekjester1,7,Mon May 18 20:01:12 2015 UTC,Adaway is not persistent. It just changes your hosts file. So it should stick after you lose root.

galaxynote4,36dpdj,Unidan_nadinU,1 point,Tue May 19 04:03:48 2015 UTC,"Removing bloatware can mean two things. Freezing it, or uninstalling it. Freezing it is similar to disabling it, except much more thorough. Uninstalling it, well, uninstalls it in it's entirety. :P   Once you reboot, it will stay gone. Even with root gone.   However, there is an app called DT Ignite, and its sole purpose is to reinstall all uninstalled or disabled system/bloat applications. So when you have root, I'd recommend freezing or uninstalling that before all else."

KingRoot also has it's own root management tool.  • Disables Knox  Knox is a Samsung software flag, to tell if you've tampered with the phone and shit like that.   • Installs SuperSU  Replaces the KingRoot SU Management tool with SuperSU.  • Soft Reboot at the end  Reboots your phone.  • It does NOT give you permanent root  It does not give you permanent root.

Did you just take an update or did you do it with a custom rom? If it was the latter, if you didn't odin the full stock LP firmware before flashing the custom rom, things like this can happen.   I would advise using Carat to see if any apps are using a lot of data. That can often masquerade as battery drain marked ""android system"" when in reality its a rogue app constantly pulling data.  And just FYI, WLD does work on LP, I used it myself before I went back to KK. What happens if you try to use it, do you get an error or something?"

Just leave it alone for about a half hour and then try to charge it. Additionally, you can try holding the home + volume up + power buttons simultaneously just to see if it will boot into recovery. But I'd let it cool for a while."
galaxynote4,3681ut,GilesCorey89,1 point,Sun May 17 02:06:23 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what i was thinking too. I took the battery out and left it on my desk in an air conditioned room.

galaxynote4,3681ut,GilesCorey89,0,Sun May 17 02:58:54 2015 UTC,Do you have an additional battery? I've had this happen with literally every device I've owned and I've always been able to bring it back. Try plugging it into your PC and see if it's recognized by Windows. You could also just leave it plugged in over night and see if it starts to charge. That's what happened to my Nexus 7.
galaxynote4,3681ut,NeverEverComments,1 point,Sun May 17 03:41:44 2015 UTC,No I don't have an extra. I usually buy an extra but the battery life on this phone was so great I didn't need one. I left it charging for awhile last night and the phone became hot. So it was getting a charge but it still wouldn't turn on. I'm going to see if I can find a Sprint store today
galaxynote4,3681ut,ZenbookPrime,1 point,Sun May 17 17:04:28 2015 UTC,Try a different battery. If the phone detects a counterfeit battery it won't turn on. This also happens if the battery is damaged. If that doesn't work send it in for warranty.

galaxynote4,362z52,almosttan,7,Fri May 15 17:48:08 2015 UTC,Surprised no one said this....  Photo Mode. Why ?  Basic is sRGB standard but too washed out.  Adaptive and Cinema are too over saturated.  Photo mode = Adobe RGB standard (used in professional cameras)  It is more vibrant than basic but not too much that it is over saturated.
galaxynote4,362z52,THS89,12,Fri May 15 22:49:53 2015 UTC,"Adaptive Display. Always and forever.   Yes, it's over saturated, but it also makes the display look absolutely gorgeous and that's part of the reason I bought this phone. Not to have it in some pale, dull color mode for ""accurate color representation""."
galaxynote4,362z52,AceTheIceman,5,Fri May 15 17:49:28 2015 UTC,Who wants accurate colors when you could have glorious samsung adaptive vision!?

galaxynote4,362z52,bub356,2,Fri May 15 21:32:55 2015 UTC,AMOLED Cinema. I like bright saturated colors.
galaxynote4,362z52,ac007,5,Fri May 15 23:38:17 2015 UTC,Basic because it's the most accurate

galaxynote4,3647dc,kohoboy,2,Fri May 15 23:52:07 2015 UTC,"Where it says ""awake"" is showing you that the CPU is constantly awake even though your screen is off. It's likely getting ""wakelocked"". Android Lollipop has had bad reports of wakelock issues up until 5.1.1. A factory wipe may not solve it."

I did a cache wipe, but I'd like to avoid a factory reset if possible (doesn't seem to need it accept for the fact that wifi radio won't turn off).   The entire time shown in the picture I had wifi turned off, but the radio is still on and draining the battery. GSAM battery monitor shows only 9 seconds of wifi on, but also shows it used 24% of the battery."
galaxynote4,3647dc,frebib,1 point,Sat May 16 00:12:02 2015 UTC,"I don't see the WiFi being always on a problem if you're on a network most of the time, it barely affects my battery life. If it really bothers you then there is a toggle for it in the WiFi settings page under Advanced in the menu, try that out and let us know if it makes any difference"
galaxynote4,3647dc,frebib,1 point,Sat May 16 01:31:21 2015 UTC,"Problem is I don't have wifi at work, so I'm mostly on mobile. Which setting in the advanced menu are you talking about? The always scanning setting is off, but the radio stays on, as shown in the picture."
