I often have to work through lunch and stay late. He still only pays me 40 hours a week and it is safe to say I average about 47 hrs weekly. He says he budgets for 40 hrs, and working through lunch isn't a term of employment, but I get in trouble if I leave with unfinished quotes. I also service all of the existing policies so it's nearly impossible to finish my work in an 8 hr day. My coworker has the same problem.

Exceptions can be made but are rare, so I'm almost maxed out as far as salary grade and promotions go unless I finish my degree or someone who really likes me decides to waive the degree req (which is quite possible now that I've been around a while and make a very positive impact on every team I've worked on), but I could already be there and making more money if I had just finished school."
Insurance,3e5jbn,Harvrah,2,Wed Jul 22 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"The majority of P&C producers are paid either straight commission or an annual salary plus a generous bonus structure based on commission revenue to the firm. Typically both new business and renewals will be paid or count against the targets. This structure can be very, very lucrative for producers willing to work hard and close business.  My suggestion would be to talk to a couple of your underwriters to see who they think the best brokerage is in your area, and then call up that brokerage's sales manager and explain that you are doing really well writing new business and that you hope to move to a position that rewards you for that. Pretty much every sales manager in the world will trip over themselves to try and get someone like you to come work for them, and they will pay you properly to do so."
Insurance,3e6fvv,pm_me_your_sores,3,Wed Jul 22 09:04:58 2015 UTC,"What state is this in?   The insurer probably won't ""round-up"" but your lender might. Whether they'll round-off $1,400 is between you and the bank/finance company. My guess is you will get a bill for it. The easiest way to deal with that (assuming they will give you another loan) is to roll it into your next car loan.  Don't forget that your insurer owes you sales/registration tax in some form, assuming $18,900 is a pre-tax number. They may not be obligated to pay you the sales tax until after you buy another car, depending on your jurisdiction.   Also, do you not have a collision deductible to account for? Or is the $18,900 figure after your deductible?  Yes you can dispute the valuation. You can negotiate it with the insurer or exercise the appraisal clause in your policy (if it has one). Exercising the appraisal clause means you hire an independent appraiser (this will cost you ~ $200 or so), the carrier selects their own appraiser, and the two appraisers select a third ""umpire"". Agreement on the value of your car between any two of these people is binding on you and the insurer. You may get more, the same, or less than what was already offered to you. The current offer will probably be taken off the table if you go this route.  Your insurer will do their best to protect you from any claims in excess of your policy limits. They will likely ask for a release of claims from the other parties before paying anything. The release extinguishes any further claims that party has against you. The other party is not obligated to sign a release, so they can opt to sue you, your insurer will defend you, and you will be responsible for the portion in excess of any coverage you have. It's not unusual for the other insurers to ""take what they can get"" and sign off on it. You may have a problem if one of the cars you hit does not have their own collision insurance on it. It's a lot harder to convince a vehicle owner with no collision insurance of their own to accept a 50% settlement on their car than it is to convince an insurer who just paid-out a collision claim on that same car to do likewise. The owner of the telephone pole may be less compromising because phone and electric companies are bureaucratic by nature.  Don't have a heart attack when you open your phone or electric bill and it's $3,000, because sometimes the cost of replacing the pole appears there first. Forward the bill to your insurer. The cost of replacing a telephone pole can vary wildly depending on how much crap is attached to it and how difficult it is to replace.   You're not wrong to lose sleep over this but it's not the end of the world. Maybe just an expensive life lesson at worst.  And Jesus, get at least a $50k property damage liability limit. IMHO that will cover 99.8% of all the claims I look at. I pay $10k+ property damage liability claims all the time.   EDIT: clarity"
Insurance,3e6fvv,Zen_Drifter,2,Wed Jul 22 13:09:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I'm in New Jersey and my collision deductible is $1,000; $18,900 is pre-deductible.  I think I'll see what USAA's appraiser comes back with instead of hiring an independent appraiser, etc.   My utilities are not in my name and the pole, thankfully, does not look damaged but I will not be surprised if or when I receive a bill.    My next policy will have at least $50,000 property damage liability limit!"
Insurance,3e6fvv,WesternExpress,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:18:35 2015 UTC,"OK so there are a lot of questions in there so I will attempt to answer as best I can for you.  Your vehicle: the insurance company doesn't care what you owe to anyone on it, you will only get paid out for the market value of your vehicle less your deductible (assuming you have Collision coverage). If the payout is less than what you owe then you are on the hook for the difference; this is where Gap insurance (if you had it) would come into play to cover that gap. You can negotiate the payout amount, but the insurers will typically only listen if you can prove that your vehicle, in same make/year/model/miles/area, is worth more than what they are offering. I would check AutoTrader and other sales sites to figure out what that number is.  Other vehicles: Given that you damaged 3 third party vehicles plus a telephone pole I can almost guarantee that $10,000 will not be enough to cover the property damage loss, especially as the other vehicle owners can add loss of use (rental car for them) and some other costs beyond just what the repair costs are. It is very nice of your insurance company to try and get the other parties to accept a settlement that fits within your policy limits, but the other parties have no obligation to accept any settlement and they can come after you for every cent that is in excess of the $10,000 limit if they want. As the other parties are all separate entities some may choose to settle and some may not, especially if they don't have collision insurance on their vehicle and will be paying the difference between a settlement and repair costs out of their own pocket. For you in the future and everyone else reading please take this as another example in why you do not want to buy state minimum limits and instead should pay the $5-$10 a month more for $100K/$300K/$100K+ limits.  Hope that helps, and let me know if you have any more questions."
Insurance,3e6fvv,WesternExpress,2,Wed Jul 22 11:17:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I didn't think about the other vehicle owners' loss of use, etc.  I'm not going to be driving for a while (bad hip fracture) but when I get a new policy I'm definitely using this situation as an expensive life lesson and buying limits much higher than state minimum."
Insurance,3e6fvv,britt5689,2,Wed Jul 22 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"I would look at getting a non-owned Auto policy in the interim to avoid gaps in your insurance history, maybe talk to USAA and see if it makes a difference to them for when you will eventually get new full insurance?   /u/Zen_Drifter gave you excellent advice so certainly listen to them too"

Insurance,3e3jbv,kfyoung,5,Tue Jul 21 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"What Farmers is telling you isn't incorrect although double or triple sounds like an exaggeration to me.  Many insurers factor lapse of coverage into their rates, so you could see lower rates in the future by maintaining coverage.  Of course, you have to balance that against paying for a policy that you're not going to use.  State Farm could be different, I don't work for them so I don't know - maybe they don't rate this way (I doubt that) or maybe they waive that for past customers (more likely).  Non-owner policies (sorry I can't type non-driver, I've never heard them called that before) can be really useful if you ever borrow or rent a car, but it's a personal finance decision you'll have to make.  Q: Can't I just buy insurance from the rental agency when I rent a car for a few days?  Wouldn't that be cheaper than paying for a policy all year that I'm not using?  A:  Yes.  I don't know.  Q:  If I borrowed a friend's car, wouldn't their coverage be primary and defeat the purpose of me having my own policy?  A:  Yes, but you're trusting more or less blindly that your friend has coverage and that it's adequate.  Having your own policy would certainly be safer."

Insurance,3e2zf3,idontgetbacon,5,Tue Jul 21 17:47:33 2015 UTC,"It started off as coverage for cargo being shipped internationally. Marine coverage/carriers were needed because that was primarily the way anything was shipped back then.  As with everything in life, technology grew faster than the industries that were built around them so railroad transportation became a thing. But there wasn't a type of insurance carrier for that kind of risk yet so older companies (the marine carriers that covered cargo) decided to extend coverage inland on their policies. Inland marine coverage was coined as a term and it grew from there."

Insurance,3e4a62,nubnasty,2,Tue Jul 21 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"If you just want a smooth relaxing vacation, and money isn't all that important, just buy the collision damage waiver from the rental car company.  Collision damage waiver isn't as comprehensive as car insurance, so understand what you're buying. Damage waiver is voided if you violate the terms listed on the back of the rental contract. This may include things like letting somebody not listed on the contract drive the car, driving in states not listed on the rental agreement, or driving drunk, all of which are the types of things which would likely be covered by regular car insurance.  On the other hand collision damage waivers usually relieve you of any obligations to pay for loss of use (down time for the rental car during repairs when it's not earning money) which regular insurance generally does not cover.  Credit card coverages also work though you need to read the fine print. Credit card coverages may mirror the same exclusions that are on the back of the rental agreement, like those listed above, or they may have a different list.  Of special attention is theft. Collision damage waivers do not always cover theft. Read the fine print.  Alternatively you can put comp and collision on your own car with $0 deductibles and remove it after you get back. A month of premiums on an older car is probably cheaper than a week+ of collision damage waiver on a rental. You just have to be sure that the comp and collision transfers to a rental car. With some carriers it does not unless the rental is because your car is in the shop."

Insurance,3e4q2p,danger24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"Your exact zip code will affect your premiums, as will a variety of factors. Your credit history, (lack of) driving history, etc. You say   Not looking to pay premiums, willing to have high deductables   Typically a ""high"" deductible for a car is $1,000 and it usually doesn't save enough on a premium (in my opinion) to bother unless you're willing to shell out $1,000 most times you get into an accident.  There is no getting around premiums. You're going to have a lot of premium cost. Why? You're a high risk driver. You're in a large city, you're under 25, men often have higher premiums than women (though that is slowly evening out), you've never had a car and insurance before (from what I gather), etc.  It's hard to say how much you ""should"" be paying. Don't get state minimum coverage. Go for 100/300/100 at least. I highly recommend gap insurance, roadside assistance, and UM/UIM coverage. The amount it adds to your premium is negligible compared to the amount of risk it covers, and compared to the much larger chunks of money like liability and collision.  Work with an independent broker- they can get you quotes from multiple companies so you can get a good idea of what is expensive/cheap/reasonable. Remember that you often get what you pay for and cut rate insurance companies are cut rate for a reason. It may be great on your wallet now but when you really need your company to back you, good luck."
Insurance,3e4q2p,dewprisms,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:21:31 2015 UTC,"High deductibles typically are $1000 and most lenders will not allow you to finance a car with deductibles higher than that. Ask yourself this, are you willing to put out the $1000 if you are in an accident, or if your car is damaged in a flood, a tree falls on it, etc, REGARDLESS OF FAULT? Because that is what you need to realize. Too many people think their deducted isn't applicable when they're not at fault. If you're using your policy to fix your car, it absolutely will apply."

Hypothetically yes (with renters (rates for renters insurance are pretty rigid, not a whole lot of negotiation going on (as opposed to some other (mostly commercial, not personal) lines where pricing is more fluid and a maybe one broker would be better at negotiating than another))).  But insurance companies shouldn't quote the same account for more than one broker.  Technically they can but there's all these annoying hoops to jump through that would really just unnecessarily delay you getting a quote.   any reason not use Chubb now that they've been bought?   Nah.  They're solid."

None that I can think of.   Your claims adjuster will have no idea that you've changed companies so it won't even be in the back of their head while they're handling your claim."
Insurance,3e2vq1,dan_232,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you say that, because I would have thought the same, but when we first spoke to the adjuster last week she made a point to remind us that our renewal (which we obviously hadn't paid because the plan had been to switch) was coming up shortly. Maybe it was just a courtesy?"
Insurance,3e2vq1,dan_232,3,Tue Jul 21 15:26:38 2015 UTC,Maybe it was just a courtesy?   Yup. She probably verified you had coverage on the date of the accident and saw the policy dates. She most likely won't look into it any further since it's irrelevant to your claim.
Insurance,3e2vq1,forneusFQ,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with what's been said so far.  The only thing I'd add is it's undeniable that some companies are just better than others at claims handling and making sure customers are taken care of during a loss.  If this claim goes really smoothly and you have no complaints, that would give me some pause before going to a different company.  It's certainly not the only factor you should consider but just something to think about."
Insurance,3e2vq1,eastindywalrus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:55 2015 UTC,This is an excellent point and one worth stressing here. You don't care a bit about claim service... until it comes to claim time. You don't want to be jerked around during a claim by your insurer. A slightly higher premium is absolutely worth it if you've had a positive claims experience with the company. Food for thought.

It's his car, not your mother's. His agent is incorrect - the car needs to be listed on your father's auto policy, since he is the titleholder. Your mother has no insurable interest in the vehicle.  My guess is he didn't mention that your mother is his ex-wife. If they were still married, they would both automatically be treated as named insureds on each others' policies, so the exact titling of the vehicle is irrelevant, as long as its to him or her. But that's not the case here. Your mother can't insure his vehicles, and he can't insure hers as they are not legally married."

Insurance,3e4aiw,eastindywalrus,4,Tue Jul 21 21:34:20 2015 UTC,"You'll want to check with your mother's agent before this happens. You may or may not be able to list a vehicle titled solely to you under her policy. It may need to be co-titled between you and your mother. This varies depending on the policies of your particular insurer, so ask, rather than assume, before you waste your time with the state trying to re-title the vehicle."

Since its never good to be cancelled see if you could maintain coverage of you have your family sign exclusion letters. Essentially they wouldn't be able to drive ur car and if they did and got in an accident there wouldn't be coverage for damage to your car. It may not be the best option but I would choose that over getting cancelled any day.
Insurance,3e48j2,Phil_Achio,3,Tue Jul 21 23:01:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry about your situation. Sad to hear you're being impacted due to family members claims and that your parent's long relationship with State Farm is ending. But, you are not without options.    Many companies consider the entire household when reviewing a customer's policy, as most people in the same household could potentially have access to the vehicle the company is insuring. Some companies, however, do not. The best thing for you to do would probably be to reach out to a local agency, and explain to them just as you did to us. They will be able to quote you with multiple different companies and help choose the right one for you. Not all companies use other drivers in the household (that are insured elsewhere) when considering whether to insure someone, and this can potentially vary by state as well. An agent will know what companies do and don't and make sure you go with the right one for you.    Another redditor had advised you to potentially seek an exclusion from the new company you decide to go with - I would advise against this unless necessary and encouraged by an agent. Even then, you must be 100% sure that the excluded driver will never ever drive your vehicle or you put yourself at risk."
Insurance,3e48j2,waterfloater,2,Wed Jul 22 01:31:18 2015 UTC,You can get insurance  from another company but most standard companies extend fairly broad coverage to family members who reside in the same household.  So even if say your family got Allstate and you got Progressive your policy is still going to cover them in many situations.  Another poster mentioned  having your family excluded from your policy.  That may be an option for you but you would need to talk to an agent and get a good understanding  of what that means for all parties involved.

Like deterioration/wear and tear.  Problems that aren't damage. Like matching, prevention, or warrantying other people's work.  Damage that's better insured elsewhere.

You can do this is the other driver has no applicable coverage and you've bought UM coverage from your own company. (Some states allow you to waive purchase of UM coverage so you have to actually have bought the coverage.)

They're telling me that continuing coverage would benefit me because those who maintain coverage for longer get preference for something or something.   I just don't know if they just want my money or are actually just helpful.  What is the best thing to do so that I have a similar premium payment amount when I do purchase a new vehicle?"
Insurance,3e3fw3,forneusFQ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"We got like the exact same question twice in 20 minutes, so just so you know I'm pretty much just gonna copy/paste my comment from over here.  Many insurers factor lapse of coverage into their rates, so you could see lower rates in the future by maintaining coverage. Of course, you have to balance that against paying for a policy that you're not going to use. Non-owner policies can be really useful if you ever borrow or rent a car, but it's a personal finance decision you'll have to make.  Q: Can't I just buy insurance from the rental agency when I rent a car for a few days? Wouldn't that be cheaper than paying for a policy all year that I'm not using?  A: Yes. I don't know.  Q: If I borrowed a friend's car, wouldn't their coverage be primary and defeat the purpose of me having my own policy?  A: Yes, but you're trusting more or less blindly that your friend has coverage and that it's adequate. Having your own policy would certainly be safer.  BUT   What is the best thing to do so that I have a similar premium   if premium is your primary concern I would continue coverage.  If having nothing out of pocket for a while now would make up for higher premium payments later, then don't.  I'll reiterate that continuing coverage is the less risky option (imagine if you borrow a friends car and get in an accident and surprise! turns out they don't have insurance either...), but it's your decision."

Insurance,3e0jnw,CuterBostonTerrier,6,Tue Jul 21 00:53:26 2015 UTC,"A quick clarification, the 30 day limit isn't a hard limit that says they must have completed their investigation by then but they likely ARE required to notify you in writing that they need more time to complete the investigation and what they're waiting on.   If it was a serious accident and one of the others involved got an attorney for their injuries or property damage, there's a chance the attorney isn't allowing their client to speak with the adjuster, that can absolutely slow the process down. Or they may be having a hard time reaching one of the other drivers for their statement to confirm the facts of loss or perhaps the at-fault driver of the vehicle isn't the owner of that vehicle and there's other insurance that may cover the accident. There's a ton of things that slow down a claim and with four cars involved, that quadruples the variables that affect the investigation.   Do you have collision coverage? I would highly suggest going through your own policy and let your insurance investigate and subrogate the at fault party on your behalf. It sounds like the at fault party had low limits and won't be able to cover all of your damage anyway. If you don't have collision, you may have to tough it out."
Insurance,3e0jnw,Still_Mighty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:26:05 2015 UTC,"http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=284-30-370   The law states within reason. Personal injury has nothing to do with the adjuster paying out a claim on property damage, and 30 days is more than enough time to inspect 3 cars, I know 2 of the cars were inspected in the first week, and the third was only minorly scraped on the . Im thinking it has become unreasonable at the 30 day mark the law states, I didn't know you could file a complaint, I'm going to give them a few more days and then go that route. And my car is only worth 3 grand as posted, the other 2 drove away after the crash,  what gives?"
Insurance,3e0jnw,Still_Mighty,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:04 2015 UTC,"I missed the bit where you stated the insurance companies agreed to the liability decision.   If the at fault party's insurance has accepted liability and advised you of this in writing, then yeah, what's the hold up? Usually it's the liability investigation that takes awhile, and it can be held up for a number of reasons that I listed above.   Personal injury only has to do with property damage when the injured party has an attorney. Attorneys don't like their clients to give statements while the liability is still being determined. Again, this is the major reason for the hold up but if you're sure it's already sorted then I might suggest calling the adjuster's supervisor first. And if no movement, then the supervisor's supervisor. Squeaky wheel and all. Filing a complaint with the insurance commissioner is definitely a solid option."
Insurance,3e0jnw,aprillian,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"They will need to receive all final costs from all vehicles involved prior to dividing their PD limit amongst the parties owed. They cannot pay out prior to knowing what their total costs are and that may include injury settlements if other parties are claiming injuries. Any amount that they cannot cover you can attempt to recover through small claims typically against the at fault party directly.   Additionally, the law you cited advises that they can take more than 30 days of the investigation requires it reasonably. They do owe you a status letter at 30 days however. This can be as simple as a formal letter telling you it's still under investigation and doesn't necessarily have to advise what they're waiting on.   Also, injuries and property damage are taken care of under the liability coverage of the at fault parties policy so they are semi related. Policies are written with a liability portion like such: 50/100/10. The first number is limit per person for injuries. The second number is limit per claim for injuries. The third number is limit per claim for property damage (vehicles, buildings etc).  If there are 3 people injured, they can pay up to 50k per person for but an overall total of 100k. This using the numbers provided above as an example and not to reflect your current situations limits.  Those three people would finish treatment and then when the insurance has a total injury related bill of 120 they have to determine how to split their 100k limit on those three people meaning one, two or all will not be paid in full. Same goes for property damage."
Insurance,3e0jnw,JeepGuy587,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:31 2015 UTC,"As it sounds like liability has been determined they are likely waiting for the pricing of all damages to come in. Over-limit claims are settled on a pro-rata basis. This means that if there are three people involved, the policy limit is split between the three based on their percentage of total damages rather than just three equal amounts.   If one of the other drivers went through their own insurance (which I would suggest you do if you have collision) it will take until the other insurance company sends in a demand to know what they paid. Subro demands usually take a couple of months to get in.  You haven't mentioned if you have collision yet but if you do, go ahead and file this on your own policy. If you don't then you are 100% at the mercy of the other carrier.  Regarding the 30 day rule - as others have mentioned this just means they need to notify you in writing every 30 days on the status of the claim, not that you have to have a check in your hands in 30 days. You can contact your state's insurance commissioner to file a complaint but in this case I don't see it doing a whole lot of good."

It may also be worthwhile to also contact the Attorney General."
Insurance,3e0j2u,Greenzoolu,12,Tue Jul 21 00:48:20 2015 UTC,"Hi! I work in homeowner claims and I think I can help!   First, I don't know much about the structure of Allstate or why they would have another company handle the claims. Do you have an agent? I might ask him/her why your policy was handed over.   Now, onto the good stuff. I will be honest, this sounds like a standard process for a kitchen fire. Everything, from sending out the restoration company to mitigate the damages to having a 20 page estimate, all sounds in line for a kitchen fire claim. I'm also not surprised they sent the company out to clean your home first. Mitigation in a smoke claim can mean a huge difference in the final cost of a claim and they are absolutely interested in keeping the cost down. This benefits you though, the cleaning had to be done either way and you don't have to bear the cost and be reimbursed.   The adjuster sent out the restoration company to assist in the investigation so the adjuster can figure out how much to pay. Insurance companies don't hand out checks all willy nilly without a documented reason why. That estimate is the documentation. In the 20 page estimate, there should be a sketch detailing the square footage of the affected rooms, the square footage of the damaged area, etc. If you're not used to looking at estimates like these they can be VERY difficult to understand. Some insurance companies send out restoration companies, some send field adjusters. It can depend on the size of the company and the size of the claim.   A key thing to remember is that the adjuster must be able to justify their payment amount. It's their job to put you back where you were before the fire occurred. If you look in the estimate, there will be line items detailing exactly what repair they're doing. If a measurement or a line item doesn't make sense, ask the adjuster. Ask the restoration company.   Here's the big bottom line, you ABSOLUTELY have the right to get a different bid from a different company for the repairs. Consider their estimate to be a bid, not the final amount. The adjuster may send you a check, but if you have a company that you'd prefer to use, tell the adjuster this. They'll explain the process and if you have a bid to send them, even better. As long as it's reasonable, and it doesn't put you in a better spot than you were before the loss (can't include granite countertops when you used to have laminate, for example) the adjuster should be able to work with you.   You haven't listed where you are and every policy can be a little different. Don't assume the adjuster is trying to rip you off, likely they're trying to wrap your claim up as quickly as possible to get you back on your feet. 2 months may seem like a long time but fires cause a lot of damage. If you're not hearing from your adjuster for more than a week at a time, I would definitely call in."
Insurance,3e0j2u,Still_Mighty,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:48 2015 UTC,"I am in NY, it looks like now my agent has submitted a similar estimate but it was not accepted because he is rounding numbers... Should I do this myself or should I complain to my agent? Is it legal for him to be doing a half ass job like this?"
Insurance,3e0j2u,emptydiner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"Stillmighty and MSCantrell are probably the best people to listen to on this thread/subject but when you say agent, do you mean insurance agent?    You ins agent is submitting a report for all the damages?  Or just filed the claim?  Either way, definitely call your insurance agent and make them work a little harder for the money you pay them."
Insurance,3e0j2u,Still_Mighty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's back up a second. There's a whole cast of characters involved in a claim and lets straighten out their roles before going forward. It can be really confusing especially if it's your first claim.   Agent- the one that sold you the policy and the one you would call to make changes. Usually not involved in the claim. If you purchased the policy online, you may not have one, and that's ok. If you're unhappy with your experience or ever want to switch insurance, the one tip I would give is to go with an insurance company that has an office with an agent to sit down and explain the coverage to you when you purchase.   Adjuster- this is your main point of contact. The person you likely have been talking to throughout this process. Sometimes they work in teams but they only handle claims.   Restoration Company- the construction company they sent out to get ""eyes"" on the loss. They usually get an estimate to repair the damages and write a report detailing what was damaged, how bad and if it can be fixed.   Please allow me to clarify, who has submitted estimates so far? Has anyone besides the restoration company physically come out to look at the damage? When you say they're rounding numbers, are they rounding measurements or prices? The estimates they're submitting should be very detailed, listing out the square footage/linear footage of whatever building material they're repairing with a cost per sqft or lf. If the other estimate with the ""rounded numbers"" only says something like ""Drywall- $1000"" and doesn't say where the drywall is going or how much square feet of drywall that includes or if it includes things like the texture, that's a problem.   Adjusters need things spelled out for them. I'm concerned where this second estimate came from and who asked for it. Some contractors don't write a full estimate so that they can pad the cost.  It sounds like the adjuster rejected the estimate because it wasn't detailed enough, so the adjuster is doing their job.   You can always call the adjuster and ask for a supervisor. I would not complain, but I would definitely ask these same questions. The adjuster should be fully explaining the process to you so that you don't have questions like these.   I'm not surprised this is a slow process although I'm sure it's miserable for you. I hope you're doing ok. Try to remember that the insurance company legally cannot put you back worse than you were. Once it's all said and done and if something isn't put back in the same condition it was before the loss, you can (and should) call the insurance company/contractor back to fix it."

Essentially, Castlepoint is Allstate.  It is just a different name to protect themselves.  You just work with Castlepoint directly to solve the claim."

Not that you have someone who regularly cleans smoke damage from your house?    They had a very detailed estimate with how much each sq feet of cabinet etc. The thing is these numbers when I asked them where they got it was just pulled out of thin air...   The thing about details is, they're verifiable. If Resto Co wrote there are 7'4"" of upper cabinets, are you saying you checked, and there aren't 7'4"" of upper cabinets, AND Resto Co told you, ""We were just guessing""?   adjuster is now asking us to submit a similarly detailed estimate which let me explain was about 20 pages.   Definitely. Because imagine you're him, sitting at his desk. You've got an estimate from a company that cleans up smoke every day. It's 20 pages long, and it's got the specific quantities of every single thing. $20,000.   Next to it, you've got a one-page estimate from a company that builds additions and remodels bathrooms. It says, ""Clean up and repair the smoke and fire damage."" $25,000.  Would you just pay the higher one?    What should my next course of action be?   Your first step is to call your adjuster and ask him to break it down for you. Tell him you don't get it, it doesn't make sense yet, tell him to run through it all again from the beginning.   Next, I'm not clear on where the process stands right now.   Are you still living in the house?  Has Resto Co finished the cleaning yet?   Have you gotten any checks?   Has your contractor written down his detailed estimate yet?"
Insurance,3e0j2u,emptydiner,2,Tue Jul 21 13:13:57 2015 UTC,I was still living in the house at the time. The Resto Co told us they finished and asked us to sign a contract to confirm this. We have not seen a single check. Apparently my contract has written an estimate but not detailed.

Allstate owns Castlepoint I believe so they just transferred you to another carrier that they own so if the claims happened, it wouldn't effect Allstate.  Do you have a claims rep?  Call and raise some hell.  Did you assign your rights to the restoration company?  This is called assignment of benefits.  Check and see if you signed that.  If you did, without understanding what it was.  Raise some hell and get an attorney.   Many restoration companies are sneaking in the ""assignment of benefits"" clause and basically do a shitty job cleaning your mess and then keeping the rest.  It's not illegal for them to talk but it sure doesn't smell pretty.    So, call Allstate(I hope you have an office with a local rep, someone you know and can talk to) and find out who your agent is or ask to speak to a manager.  Get some details and the moment it doesn't line up or you think something is fishy, raise some hell.  Put demands on them and tell them to get you results or you are contacting an attorney and the insurance commissioner.    Depending on what you find out, if you do not feel good about what Allstate told you, call Castlepoint(You may have the same agent from allstate that handles your policy with Castlepoint) and try to get an understanding and the moment it doesn't line up or seems fishy, raise hell and tell them you are getting an attorney and calling the INS commissioner.    Restoration Company?  First of all, ask them for a copy of their certificate of insurance and primarily their ""Professional Liability"".  This is just to scare them but tell them you need it today or your attorney will be sending a formal request for it.  You need to find out if you signed an ""AOB"", assignment of benefits.  If you did and it was not explained to you and you signed it unknowingly, just call an attorney right away.  They are pulling one on you an shady shit like that makes us look bad.  Burn them to the ground.  Tell the resto co you are getting your attorney involved.    The claims adjuster, well, I will let a claims adjuster on here address that.  I would call and get some answers and see if it lines up with the three above.  If not, I think you know the procedure.    All of the above may not be the most popular advice given, but it's what I would do and it is what I would tell my clients to do.     What was ruined was the cabinets, microwave, and oven (we didn't take into account the furniture,clothing and windows   You need to be covered for this as well as long as you have contents.  Did you have to move out while the cleaning was happening?  Your policy should offer some expenses for you to have stayed in a hotel.    The guy that did it for you; is he a licensed claims adjuster/Public Adjuster?  He should have a pretty good idea how all this works if so.    Hopefully some Allstate/Castlepoint reps while sign on and give you some better advice on how their company works.    But wither way, 2 months is too long and you need to raise some hell.  You do not have to be polite.  You deserve an answer so start demanding it."

Somewhere someone has failed and it isnt OP providing the post is accurate.   My major concern is the resto company tricked OP into signing an AOB and that is about the most cowardly thing happening in our industry at the moment.  Id hang people for doing this is a could."
Insurance,3e0j2u,emptydiner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"no one taking the time to explain it so OP understands   I've been on the other side of this (doing the explaining) thousands of times, which means I've been on the other side of it went it went wrong dozens of times.   I can say with a pretty good degree of certainty the adjuster tried to explain the process at least once. Maybe they didn't do a great job explaining it, but they explained it. At least once, at the beginning. Unfortunately, that's when everybody is emotional, they're being bombarded will all kinds of surprises, and it's common for homeowners to not even remember they heard the explanation at all, let alone to have grasped the details.   (In the last few years, I've started adding this to the end of my first-visit spiel:  ""Ok, I know I just threw a lot of information at you all at once, and you won't remember it all. That's alright, that's normal, you'll have lots of questions for me as we go through this process, and that's what I'm here for, to answer them.""   It seems to help.)  So now, the hint from OP is pretty strong that she hasn't gone back and asked for another explanation.   If OP hasn't asked, then the adjuster's got no idea there's a problem. (S)he's not ""not taking the time to explain"", (s)he just doesn't know any explaining needs to happen.   The right thing to do NEXT is go apeshit and sue? That would be counterproductive."

How do you handle assignment of benefits?  What has been your experience?   Its cool that we can discuss this from opposite perspectives and I appreciate your ""keeping me in line"" so to speak.  But for me, I hate  it when I have uninformed or misinformed clients.  As an agent, our reputation is tied very closely to adjusters, remediation/restoration companies, and the carriers involved.  All it takes is a slip up anywhere and we have automatically lost any credibility we may have had.    Im on a mobile so forgive any sloppiness or errors"
Insurance,3e0j2u,emptydiner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"How do you handle assignment of benefits? What has been your experience?   So I'm independent now. I was a staff adjuster for a while.   When I was a staff adjuster, we had a direct program with a water mitigation franchise where we paid them directly. We told people up front, we can send them, they'll promise x, y, and z as far as responding, and if drying out is all that's needed, you won't have a deductible. (If repairs are needed, you'll have a deductible there.)   On the whole, it went well. Every once in a while, one of the franchisees would botch a job, but we sent them enough work that we could twist their arms and make them correct it. It went well.   Now that I'm independent, some of my client companies have programs where they pay contractors directly. I don't get to see the behind-the-scenes of it anymore, but I'd say it goes smoothly overall. There's a baseline level of fraud involved where they inflate every bill by 5% to offset the 5% discount that they give for the job. Everybody understands that, and it's not a problem. (Really, 5% can be the difference between an estimator who's in a hurry and one who's got time to think of all the details. It's not much.)   But I haven't seen many cases where their getting paid directly hurts the homeowner. The contractor knows that if they piss off the homeowner, that makes the adjuster's job harder, and scoots them that much closer to having their program replaced. It doesn't seem to be bad for the homeowner, in my experience."

They're putting you in touch with the responsible party.  If you've had your windshield replaced already (which is obviously the right thing to do), then this is just a matter of getting the right folks to step up.  If you haven't heard from the landscaping contractor by tomorrow, call the prime/general contractor's insurance folks back and let them know.  They're potentially on the hook here if things go bad, but you have to be reasonable about the timeliness of the responses - thus far no one seems to have treated you badly, and most commercial liability claims folks do not work weekends."

It may not be their responsibility based on the contracts and policies they have in place. It is very reasonable to expect and not at all surprising that there is a clause in the construction company's coverage stating that if a subcontractor is hired and they carry their own insurance, that insurance is primarily responsible for them. I would continue to press the construction company's insurance to provide you exactly with the insurance company responsible for the damages. They are rejecting their claim, and therefore have a burden to provide you with the right info."

Now if the car is mangled so bad that no one can tell anything, then you might get lucky and still get full value for your car in this new total loss, in addition to your previous damage, but I wouldn't count on it unless your car is just a total ball of twisted metal(and I have a feeling you wouldn't be posting right now if it had been that bad, glad you aren't seriously hurt)  So definitely keep pursuing that first claim, as you may need that money to make up the difference with this new claim if they figure that prior damage into the value of your car when settling with you."

Nah, they are only charged for the months in which you are actually covered.  The real issue revolves around the 1099. They’re not required to offer coverage to employees on 1099’s. Your 'hire date' slash date that your probationary period began would technically be the day you were off the 1099.  If there’s no mention of an ‘orientation period’ (those words exactly) in your handbook, then there’s a 90 day maximum waiting period they could impose. This is federal law and the penalty is something like 100 bucks per DAY after the 90 days. So it’s a pretty big deal.  Clarify your eligibility with your employer first before sounding the alarms though"

Insurance,3dxes8,TP3NG,2,Mon Jul 20 09:27:24 2015 UTC,"I hear that all insurance companies negotiate with hospitals independently, so the price I pay will be what they've negotiated.    Once you have health insurance, the main thing that will pertain to what you have to pay out of pocket will be your co-pays, and your deductible.  Some basic services only have a simple co-pay, maybe $25 to visit a general practitioner if you have the flu, or a $100 copay to see a specialist, something like that.  Then you'll also have a deductible.  Your initial flat-amount deductible, which adds up over the course of a year.  So your insurance won't start paying for procedures, tests, or surgeries until your deductible is met. A few common services might have a co-pay, where you don't pay the full price for them regardless, even if you haven't met your deductible.  But any specific procedure/visit/test that doesn't have a co-pay listed, you will pay expenses out of your own pocket until you hit your deductible amount in a given year.    My questions are- what do I need to look out for in choosing between plans/companies?    Honestly, since it is all fairly regulated, just use the healthcare.gov website to find the best combo of benefits & price for the area in which you are going to live.  The specific company really doesn't matter a whole lot(and you'll only have a few to choose from, anyways)    What insurance exceptions should I be looking out for? (So if they say they don't pay for certain things, what is acceptable?)    This may be difficult to figure out until you live in a place for a while, but you would want to double-check to see what hospitals and doctors are near you(that you might want to use) and make sure that those facilities are in-network providers with whichever company you choose to get coverage through.  Also, don't forget that in the US, health insurance does not cover dental or vision expenses.  You will need separate policies if you want coverage for those.(Which can often be purchased from your medical/health company, but it is another policy/expense, it's not included with your medical coverage)    For those people charged exorbitant fees, is that because they did not have insurance at all, or could a bad plan also cause this?    Most of the crazy stories you see with people owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills are because they are not insured.  Now, some of the cheaper medical plans(bronze-tier on the healthcare.gov website) might have really high deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, but you're still probably only talking about something like $10,000-$15,000 out of pocket maximum for a year, not hundreds of thousands(or even millions), and those high maximums are usually family plans where several individuals are involved."

And if an OON provider charges $100,000 and the insurance allows $10,000, in my state you can be billed the $90,000. An in-network provider would have to write it off.   You'd have to ask the provider what they charge. And yes,  don't see anyone OON unless you want to pay, probably dearly, for the privilege."

See my blog if you want to know why it continues to be a rip off http://www.peercover.co.nz/news/addressing-the-market-failure-of-add-on-insurance-products  You should consider upping your regular car insurance - many insurers will offer a new car if your car is a total loss for the first 3-4 years (rather than replacement value). That way you have no gap for the first 3-4 years. After 3-4 years you would have paid off most of your loan, so the depreciated car value will exceed the value of the outstanding loan (i.e. no gap)"

Insurance,3dv59v,bigboijoey,4,Sun Jul 19 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"Former manager of a rental car agency and now insurance agent, so I can give you a good perspective from both sides.  First... Are you using a credit card to rent? If so most provide coverage for the damage to the car (loss damage waiver). You'll need to call and ask, also ask if they cover damage in Canada. I'm actually renting a car now on vacation and I used my Amex. They have a program you can enroll in and for $20 (total, not per day) they cover the LDW as primary coverage and not secondary to your auto insurance like most credit card companies.  For the liability... State Farm will most likely cover you, but again, call and ask. Also make sure coverage extends to Canada, which it most likely does.  PAE is a waste of money. I saw numerous people buy it and never saw one person use it. Not a single time.  Rental car companies make their money on selling insurance, not on renting cars, so they will try a hard sell at the counter. Make up your mind what you need before you get there and stick to your guns. Just say NO to anything you don't want.   Also, they'll try to sell you prepaid fuel at the agency, again this is a bad idea. If you buy in advance it is about $0.25 cheaper per gallon, but if you return the car with more than a couple of gallons in it you've lost money. It is usually best to just fill it back up before you return it.  Any more questions feel free to ask."

Insurance,3dv59v,skipper14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:22:25 2015 UTC,"Secondary insurance means that it pays AFTER your personal insurance pays. If you have no personal insurance then it would just pay the claim. However, since you do then it would basically pay anything your insurance doesn't (i.e. Your deductible).  Call and ask them if they have a program like Amex does where you can buy primary coverage from them for the rental car, if they do it will likely be a lot cheaper than Budget's LDW. Like I said earlier, I only pay $20 for Amex's coverage and the rental agency wanted $18 a day x 10 days.  It's important to remember... We are only talking about coverage to the rental car itself. Your liability is not covered by the credit card, that you need to check with State Farm on or buy the rental car company coverage. However, I'm pretty sure State Farm's liability will extend into a rental, but you must verify that with them and verify it will cover you in Canada."

This coverage will no longer apply in most cases if you stay in the same car for 30 days or more.   Also, I recommend using Enterprise or Hertz if you can. State Farm contracts with them and they will waive a lot of fees that Budget won't if you have an accident (like loss of use, diminished value, and administrative fees).  Mandatory disclaimer: Of course, I can't guarantee the accuracy of this without reading your policy, but I am familiar with State Farm. You should call your local agent and they can let you know for sure.

The rental agency paid out the limit of the policy they put in place, it was inadequate, the other driver's insurance paid the difference, and now they're subrogating against you to be reimbursed for the amount they spent.  Can you take legal action against the rental agency for failing to fulfill a verbal agreement, can the other driver's insurance sue you or sell the debt to collections, if they can sell the debt would it be to a US or an Australian company, could collections pursue you in Australia, will this impact your credit in either or both countries...

Insurance,3dw3yj,Zen_Drifter,2,Mon Jul 20 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"You can request a copy of the damage estimate and pictures from the other party to verify the amount they are claiming. Ultimately, the responsible parties would owe for repairing the other vehicle as well as the reasonable cost for a rental car during the time it was being fixed.  The first thing I would do if I was in your shoes is to check and see if the credit card you used gives you liability coverage (for damage to third parties) in addition to the usual collision coverage for the car you rented. Most do not, but some do. It is worth looking into.  Second I'd want to know from a California auto liability adjuster whether it is common practice for a property damage liability limit to be paid-out in California without obtaining a claims release, and/or if the rental car company did obtain a claims release whether they had a duty to name you on it as well as themselves. It's remotely possible that you may have a bad faith claims handling case against the rental car company (which an attorney would certainly be interested in) if the rental car company is self insured and violated some sort of duty they owed you to try to get a claims release. This is a legal question for a lawyer or litigation claims adjuster.  Third, I'd consider trying to hire an independent claims adjuster (note, not an independent auto damage appraiser but an independent claims adjuster - the type that handles liability claims) to review it. (you can also have a damage appraiser review it but IMHO the physical damage estimate is probably accurate.)  You want somebody who knows what they're doing to look into the way the case was handled, not necessarily the amount of money involved. This may cost you a few hundred dollars but may be worth it if they can identify an out for you. Note that in the US there is a difference between an independent adjuster (somebody who works as a claims adjuster for hire who can be hired by anybody (but usually an insurer) and usually works on a per-hour basis) and a public adjuster (somebody who works only for insureds and handles claims for them against their own insurer in exchange for a percentage of the money they are able to get the insurer to pay, usually handling claims on property like one's house burning down).   If all this fails you can either hire an attorney to fight it, hire an attorney to negotiate some sort of reduced ""I'll pay you $XXXX right now"" type settlement, or try to negotiate a reduced cash settlement on your own.  Or, if you're back in Australia, research how far these creditors can reach into Australia and, if they can't really touch you, possibly just ignore it.  EDIT: Also listen to the lawyers over in the other thread. This may be a ploy to get you to pay something you do not owe on a case that hasn't actually been resolved by the rental car place yet."
Insurance,3dw3yj,potters2643,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this - We have already checked over our individual travellers insurance and credit card insurance on the card used to rent the vehicle, unfortunately there is no additional cover. Our travel insurance will cover the cost of the excess (deductible) fee to process the auto insurance claim, but thats about it.  Any idea on how we could find out how far the creditors could reach us over this amount?  Also after reading that comment on the other thread, we have contacted our liability insurer (Zurich) and stated that we do not believe we were at fault. Hopefully then they will either provide insight as to whether or not the case has been resolved and how we were deemed to be at fault (I'm expecting a police report to be produced at this point in time).  There is also one key part that I had neglected to mention. In the letter requesting payment from the other drivers insurance company, they state that the total amount for the damages claim was $9889.01 and that our party is liable for $5911.67 once the policy limit was met. The policy limit was $5000, so I'm unsure as to why we owe more than $4889.01? Have additional administration charges been added to the damage figure?"
Insurance,3dw3yj,potters2643,2,Mon Jul 20 04:30:24 2015 UTC,"I guess if the original renter has physical damage coverage on an Australian auto insurance policy then that might be worth looking into for covering the excess if it applies outside Australia. Many US policies automatically cover damage in Canada, though not Mexico. You may have something similar.   If you can argue the liability down to around 50% then the claim would presumably go away since they're presumably already recovering about that much from the rental car company.  I think you need to clarify exactly what the status is of the rental car company's defense/payment of the other person's claim. Did they pay it? If so why, if liability is disputed? Did they get a release of all further claims from the other person's insurer? Were you named on the release? If not why not? Etc..  I can't think of any reason for the discrepancy in the amounts. The person making the claim would have to clarify that."

Insurance,3dwphb,Carinsurancehelp,4,Mon Jul 20 04:05:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but this is insurance 101. I hear this complaint from customers on at least half of every of every call I take. You have to pay your deductible because thats the kind of policy you purchased. You could have purchased one with no deductible but you decided to be self-insured for up to $500 when using your own policy. The fact that somebody else is at fault is irrelevent unless there's something in your policy that says allstate will waive your deductible if you aren't at fault, which isn't standard. Calling and yelling will do nothing except piss the other guys insurance adjuster, which will make him LESS inclined to help you, not more. I always wonder why people don't get that. If you want results, don't yell or be rude. Be really nice, polite, helpful, and patient. That will get you miles beyond yelling. The simple fact is that determining who is liable for an accident can sometimes be very complex and take a long time. There's a lot going on behind the scenes that you don't know about and it isn't unusual that it could take a month or more. Most of the time the timeline is as much out of our control as it is the customers control. Additionally, we lose money every time we have to touch a claim. When you call to check on the claim status the other guys insurance company is paying money to their adjuster's salary to handle your call. The longer a claim is around, the more money it costs. Making quick liability decisions isn't just good for you, its good business for the insurance company too. They wouldn't be dragging this out so long if it was their decision. Most likely they are waiting for something - somebody to call them back for a statement, a police report, an damage appraisal, whatever."
Insurance,3dwphb,jjason82,3,Mon Jul 20 13:56:39 2015 UTC,"Let me preface my post by saying that you have a legal duty to mitigate your damages. What this means in layman terms is that you need to get your life back on track asap regardless of insurance involvement. What this translates to in action is that you should start the repair process with your own insurance company, especially if there is any sort of rental involved due to your car not being drivable. The reason why you need to pay your deductible is because it is not contingent on who is at fault, whenever you pursue your own coverages, the deductible applies. Think of it as if you do not have coverage for the first $500, and only after the damages exceed that amount, only then does your insurance kick in. That is what a deductible means. I can't speak for the other insurance company, but my GUESS is that they may be running into difficulty getting a statement from their driver. We don't drag our feet in claims handling, there's nothing in it for us. We just get people upset and we end up paying anyway. Insurance has a legal duty to make a diligent attempt to get a statement from their policyholder. It sounds to me like the facts of the accident are clear cut and liability also, but I would still be curious to find out more. You were making a right out of a shopping complex, I am assuming onto a main road? Where was the other driver coming from? Did they rear-end you? Do you know what the citation was?"
Insurance,3dwphb,f1shbone,2,Mon Jul 20 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"You have a contractual agreement to your deductible with your insurance company. You CHOSE that deductible. It doesn't matter who's fault it is. Now if the other carrier finally accepts liability, then Allstate can get that back for you through subrogation. You absolutely need to get your car fixed now to mitigate your damages. I sure hope you're not in a rental while your car is just sitting there or driving it around potentially causing more damage."
Insurance,3dwphb,broseph23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:28 2015 UTC,"Long story short, pay the deductible - it's the policy you paid for.  If your insurance company can get 100% of the damages covered by the at fault party, they will refund your deposit."
Insurance,3dukxx,AverageO,4,Sun Jul 19 16:59:27 2015 UTC,"There's a larger question of liability here. If the driver is in control at the time of an accident, the driver is liable the same as today.   But what about when the car is in control? Is the driver responsible? Is the manufacturer? The industry needs to figure out who the insured is in this situation before its clear what the industry will look like.   I imagine that the number of accidents these cars will get into will be much lower than that of a human driver. But when they do get in an accident, they'll cost a ton more to repair because of the electronics required to make them work.   Overall though, I'd expect premium charged per vehicle to fall."
Insurance,3dukxx,AWKWARD_HANDS_GUY,2,Sun Jul 19 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"I think there's a fairly good argument to be made that the company will be liable, and as such this will not show up to consumers at all but will get folded into their Business Owners Policy. If they take on the costs of this, it should raise their overall costs of operation, requiring that the cars cost more. On the other hand, consumers won't be paying anymore so they should have more disposable income to pay for the more expensive cars, and the cars should be more safe, so in net I'd expect the costs of car insurance to go down.  It's an interesting evolving topic. Might not be a great time to be a P&C agent however, the BoP is still in their domain but suddenly you'll not need hundreds of agents to sell to thousands of people.  Edit: I noticed I missed OP's clarification. You'd still need personal auto liability for when you take control. Heck, with everything getting more and more 'smart' it wouldn't blow my mind if you had to tell the car your policy number or something before it let you take the wheel."
Insurance,3dukxx,DiscordianAgent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:27 2015 UTC,"If anything, I would think car rentals for fully autonomous cars would become more commonplace; subscription services, if you will. In such an instance, the rental company would likely be at fault for autonomous collisions.  Good thing, however, that autonomous cars have a 100% track record regarding their collisions (all collisions have been the fault of humans thus far). That's worthy of investment to those who want to start such a service."
Insurance,3dukxx,ydnab2,2,Mon Jul 20 13:29:58 2015 UTC,"I could see that taking off. Particularly in urban areas that already rely on public transit/ride sharing/car sharing programs as long as the price point was right.   If I was in charge of this program (say at Google) I'd only let these cars operate in areas and during times I was 100% sure they'd work well in. That way I could use the safety information collected as marketing material.  I wonder how these vehicles perform in non-optimal weather when the road surface is slick or not even visible, or when senors on the vehicle are covered in ice and snow. What's the track record under those conditions?"
Insurance,3dukxx,AWKWARD_HANDS_GUY,2,Mon Jul 20 21:40:55 2015 UTC,"I think the effect will be unpredictable but could be very disruptive for the actuarial people.    I can see where insuring such vehicle makes plucking the best risks really easy. By fighting a premium war for these folks you lop off a chunk of the money that pays for the more risky drivers and that drives their premiums up. I can see certain manufacturers having automation software that's superior to others and that factor possibly making the vehicle manufacturer more important than the driver's history in evaluating a risk. I can see it possibly working the opposite way in that automated driving will tend to be on the simplest roads & driving situations first. At some point the cars are handing control over to the humans only for the most complex situations where they have the highest likelihood of having a crash. I can't imagine a day when cars are fully autonomous with no ability of the driver to control the car at all (unless it's by choice because they are drunk or blind or something). There are assorted situations that, while rare, would be common enough that there would always be an emergency override. For example how comfortable would you be driving home late and night knowing that any random person could stop your car simply by stepping into the road in front of you (ie. crime)? Say you encounter a flash flood or some serious weather event? You'd have a need to be able to control the car. So people will still do it. The biggest thing I'm seeing on the street right now in semi-automated systems like radar cruise control, is that the parts are extraordinarily expensive relative to their non-tech counterparts. For example the grille emblem in a Prius without radar cruise is $90. With radar cruise it's $900. There are headlights in non-exotic cars that cost nearly $4,000 (each) already. I expect the trend will be towards fewer losses but with a much higher cost on a per-loss basis. This seems especially true in light of the fact that, like airbags, such systems will be proprietary and aftermarket components will be unavailable, making it easy for the manufacturers to charge whatever they want to repair or replace them."

Insurance,3du759,Harvrah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:45 2015 UTC,"If they pulled your license/claims/credit on one and not on the other, that would account for the difference.  In theory, if you're both on the policy, it should make no difference whatsoever once it's actually quoted.  On the other hand, some carriers in some states will only use the insurance score (credit) of the first named insured - if one of you has substantially better credit and they pulled it, that could certainly account for the difference.  Either way, you'd change the primary named insured for that, not the ownership of the car in most states.   NY requires that each vehicle be titled to a named insured, a limited number of other states may have similar requirements.  Progressive in NY, for example, seems to use some blend of both scores, whether or not they're the first named insured.  I can't cite the exact model, but that seems to be the case."

Lying about that isn't a crime or fraud, but it is material misrepresentation and possibly grounds for canceling/nonrenewing the policy - not that they really have a way of verifying who drives the car more but still.  The other thing to realize is that the underwriting period in KY is 60 days.  That means that even after you sign everything and pay for the policy and the policy is in force, the insurance company still has 2 months to legally run your credit, run your driving records, etc. and revise your premium upwards and send you a revised bill.  If you got a quote online, it's highly unlikely that's going to be your final rate.  Bottom line is it's never a bad idea to shop around but I'd be shocked if you truly end up paying half as much as you have been."

Probably not totaled if 9k is a correct value. Still, it needs a teardown and inspection for hidden damage.   If the rails are kinked and need to be replaced, it could be totaled, but that has more to do with the repair cost than anything else. Really, it doesn't look like it's hit very hard. Otherwise, it's best to ask the adjuster handling your claim and speak with your body shop.   I don't handle medical claims, so someone else can probably explain that better than I could."

Would you want your insurance paying for his car with even talking to you first?    Did your insurance company actually tell you that your rates would go up?  A lot of people think that just because you file a claim it will go up. This is not always the case.   Right now you would need to either wait to see what he tells his insurance (he may lie) or repair through your own policy.

In TX, you are allowed to exclude him if your insurer agrees to that, but understand that that would mean he would have zero coverage under the policy even if he has your permission to borrow it. So I recommend you not go that route, but it's your choice."

Insurance,3dqxcg,Doc_Lee,2,Sat Jul 18 17:01:14 2015 UTC,Tough call there.  That could go either way on billing.  You'll most likely have to call the place where you are going to have the procedure and ask them how it's going to be billed.  Do you currently have insurance?
Insurance,3dqxcg,GigginBitches,2,Sat Jul 18 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. I currently have a private PPO with $500 deductible, but have to switch to a work provided plan Sept 1, so trying to figure out if I should wait for my new insurance before getting the MRIs."
Insurance,3dqxcg,GigginBitches,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:50:59 2015 UTC,"What will your new work deductible be? When you go from one plan to another, at least when groups switch from one carrier to another, you will get deductible (NOT out of pocket) credit for any amount you've paid toward your deductible in that calendar year (so from January 1, 2015 until now). I would check with your new insurance to see if you'll get deductible credit. If the charges would be the same for either insurance, it might not matter if you wait or not."
Insurance,3dq8rx,StackDeezNuts,2,Sat Jul 18 11:42:34 2015 UTC,"Traditionally you would want an Employee Dishonesty Bond but considering you are using independent contractors, I am not positive that it would cover you, or your company, properly.  Most residential janitorial services I have provided these types of bonds for get a $10K dishonesty bond, but they have true employees, not independent contractors.  Perhaps you could get a crime policy/endorsement added onto your General Liability policy but again, you need to be very clear with the person you are talking to about this.  Be sure to tell them that you have no employees and that they are independent contractors.  If possible, get everything in writing via email.  Ask a question and make sure you get an answer...in writing.    You may also want to ask about Voluntary Property Damage Coverage Covers, at the named insured's request, damage to property of others away from the insured's premises (excluding in transit). Sometimes this can be added onto the GL policy.  Then again a form of bailee's coverage may be best.    These are only suggestions, or directions to explore.  Speak to your local agent about which type of coverage is best for you.    Make sure to confirm each IC has a GL policy and either has a workers comp policy or has an exemption, a true policy is best.  Make your IC's to get bonded.    While you think using IC's is easier and protects you more in the short term, it could actually cost you more in the event of a claim because something may be covered and some policies exclude work performed by IC's.  Make sure your GL covers your ICs."

Insurance,3dqyku,oznobninja,2,Sat Jul 18 16:37:39 2015 UTC,"edit: words  We might need a coder/biller to confirm this - but I believe one would not have multiple MRIs on a given day.  You could have an MRI of multiple areas of the body done, but it's still a single MRI.  There are various billing codes for the MRI, how many areas, and which areas, etc.  That all said, per test, per procedure, etc. would be the same."

Insurance,3dqyku,Sandbocks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:37:57 2015 UTC,And that's just up to how they the want to bill it? Its subjective like that?
Insurance,3dqyku,Sandbocks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:16:29 2015 UTC,"edit: formatting  It's not as subjective as it sounds.  For whatever is done exactly, there is an appropriate billing with appropriate coding.  But I'm not a coding expert.  There are thousands of different procedure codes.  There are probably more than a dozen different codes just for an MRI.  Codes are 5 characters - For example (these aren't actual codes):  87050 = MRI head  87051 = MRI cervical spine  87052 = MRI thoracic spine  87053 = MRI lumbar spine  87054 = MRI entire spine  87055 = MRI 3 or more areas, not including head  87056 = MRI 3 or more areas, including head  87057 = MRI knee  87058 = MRI hip  87059 = MRI knee and hip  Assuming the above if you have an MRI of your entire spine, which is 3 areas.  Each separate area of the spine has a code for each.  But there is also a code for the entire spine.  A clinic can't bill 3 charges for the entire spine when there exists a single code for the same thing.  For your entire spine, there is one copay.  If the provider tried to bill the thing with 3 charges the claim would be sent back to the provider to be recoded because those 3 codes can't be billed together on the same date.  So... it depends.  What areas of the body are we talking?  Does there exist coding such that a single procedure code would accurately reflect the services provided.  If not, it could be that 2 codes matches the 3 areas, or 3 codes...  I personally had an MRI for my entire head and spine.  That's 4 areas - 4 MRIs - head, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbar spine.  But there is a single code for billing an MRI of the head and entire spine."

It's an extended warranty; or it's a scam disguised as an extended warranty.  Unfortunately you're not really going to know which until you try to make a claim.   I don't feel comfortable taking my car (needed it for work, I drive it fairly often now) to any place suggested by GWC, or using any of their services after reading all of that.   Q:  Do I have to use the warranty now that I've bought it?  A: No.  Q: Can I use the warranty at a place of my choosing?  A: According to GWC's website, yes, the shop you choose would just have to call GWC and get authorization to perform the work under their warranty.  You didn't ask enough questions, so I'm making up some of my own.  Q: Can I just cancel the warranty?  A: What does the warranty say regarding termination?  Q: Can I replace this warranty with a warranty from a different company?  A: Doubt it, but you'd need to check the requirements of other extended warranties, I think most require the car to be a relatively recent (couple days) purchase.  Q: Do I even need an extended warranty?  A: That really depends on your finances.  I mean, if this car broke down and parting it out and buying a new car or paying for the repairs is really something you don't think you could afford, I guess the extended warranty might be a good idea.  In general, I am absolutely opposed to extended warranties because the most expensive repair that you could find yourself needing (IMO) is a small enough exposure you should be able to navigate it on your own without paying someone else a premium (just my opinion, take it as you will)."

Insurance,3dpw7o,carwreck101,2,Sat Jul 18 08:04:32 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear. What happened? What's the damage like and what kind of car. Depending on the severity and car it could take a lot to total a brand new car. Totaling a vehicle is an economical decision. A car is totaled if the vehicle repairs reach a certain threshold of the vehicles actual cash value. Also do you have gap coverage for the loan?
Insurance,3dpw7o,broseph23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:56:35 2015 UTC,"To add to this some companies will also make a safety decision, in that can it be safely repaired. As far as making a few payments for a car you can't drive, if I were you unless you have endorsements to protect the vehicles value I would pray for a repair. Resale value is nothing compared to have to pay money for a car you can't use. If they total it they give you what they feel its worth based off similar vehicles, they don't give you what you owe. So if you paid 25k plus finacOK ng and they determine the vehicles value at time of loss at 23k, you get that not what was paid.  Lif the vehicle is brand new as in 2015, it will ctakr alot of damage to total it, they aren't going to pay 23k for something they can pay 10k for. As given the choice any regular person would do. As far as a 2015 vehicle the good news is you will like get oem becuase aftermarket may not be readily available."
Insurance,3dpw7o,Phil_Achio,2,Sat Jul 18 14:04:13 2015 UTC,"If you haven't done so already, notify the leinholder (finance company) about the loss. Advise them to the claim with whomever you are filing the claim through.      If the vehicle is in fact a total loss, your leinholder has the final say in owner vs. insurance retention of the vehicle. (who keeps the vehicle). If the value of the vehicle is worth less than what you owe on it, which is likely since you just purchased the vehicle and have not made a payment, then if you have GAP insurance, once the insurance company makes you aware of the vehicle being a total loss, contact the GAP insurance carrier and set up a claim so you don't have to come out of pocket or continue to make payments on a vehicle which you no longer have access to.     There are two types of total losses, and since I don't know the severity of the damages I'll explain both. There are economic total losses in which the cost to repair the vehicle exceeds or approaches the state's percentage of a vehicle's value to declare the vehicle a total loss. The insurance company will then offer the value of the vehicle. The second is a structural total loss. This is when the vehicle is so badly damaged that it is not safely or legally repairable to be driven on the road again. e.g. the fire barrier between the engine and the cab, a crushed roof from a rollover, and other misc parts, where, depending on state, it will deemed a vehicle illegal to operate on the road for safety reasons.      If the vehicle is repairable and you choose to file with the other party's insurance carrier, there is something called a diminished value claim you may have the option to file, depending on your state. Each insurance company has their own method of process for handling these. They are a pain, since something abstract as ""value""  doesn't have a price tag associated with it.      In addition, depending again on state, you may have the option to have OEM (original equipment manufactured) parts installed on the vehicle, use caution in this regard. The OEM parts are usually a good deal more expensive than like kind quality and aftermarket parts. This may push your vehicle from being repairable to a total loss.      At the end of the day the choice of parts, who to file the claim with, and other options are yours. You do have a good deal of power in these situations, just keep civil and be flexible with your adjusters, they're people too and often don't have the decision authority people think. Allow the insurance company time to inspect your vehicle, determine if the vehicle is repairable or  a total loss, and if it is a total loss, allow time for the actual cash value processing on your vehicle.      I wish you the best of luck and hope this works out for you."
Insurance,3dpw7o,claimslife,2,Sat Jul 18 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"WOT-  You'll want to file a claim with the other person's insurer. The insurer will gather talk to you and the other driver, gather any other relevant facts (if they need to) like the police report, and determine whether they will voluntarily accept liability for the accident.  In the initial phone car they will ask you questions about the damage to your car. The answers to those questions comprise a ""score"" which tells them whether it's probable your car is totaled or not, even before anybody has looked at it. If it is a likely total loss then they will ask your permission to move it to a salvage yard and send a damage appraiser there to look at it. I if is likely not totaled then they will send a damage appraiser to wherever the car is to look at it.   If the car is determined to be repairable then they send you a check for the repairs and you'll need to decide where to have it fixed or whether you want to try to sell it as-is and take that money plus the insurance check and just go buy another car.  If the car is a total loss then they basically purchase the car from you. With a car as new as yours it's common to just pay you what you paid for it, less some nominal fee for mileage on it (like 25 cents per mile or something). Unless you drove an extremely hard deal you can probably walk into a dealership and get a 2016 version of the same vehicle with your check.   Sales / registration taxes will be due to you. Sometimes state law only requires them to be paid if you purchase another vehicle within a specific time frame. If your car is not totaled and you are going through the other person's insurer then they will pay for your rental car daily rate plus tax, for the time your car is in the shop. If your car is not totaled and you're going through your own insurer, and you have rental car coverage, then you'll get reimbursed (usually the rental place will bill your insurer directly) for whatever your daily rental car coverage is, up to the number of days of rental specified in your policy. If your daily rental cost exceeds your limit or you need a rental for more days than your policy covers then you have to pay that part yourself (though the other guy's insurer will owe it to you in the end).  If the car is totaled then either insurer will pay for a reasonable amount of rental days to cover you until you get the check or a few days beyond that. Start car shopping as soon as you know it's totaled. If your car is totaled and you bought an extended warranty then you'll have to get a pro-rated refund on it from whoever you bought it from. If you are going through the other person's insurance and you're concerned about the car being totaled then ask the claims adjuster if the other person's coverage is ""adequate"". They won't disclose the actual dollar limit of the other person's coverage to you but they can tell you whether they feel their insured has enough coverage to pay for your car. If the other person has the state minimum liability limits then they may not have enough insurance to pay for a totaled car. In this case you would revert to your own insurer and they would handle it, pay you, and deal with recovering what they can from the other person and their insurer. Generally when the damages to your car reach about 75% of the pre-loss value of the vehicle then your car will be declared a total loss. In about half the states there is a statutory definition of the damage threshold for a total loss. In the remainder of states it is at the discretion of the insurer. In states with a threshold the owner of the car and the insurer can still agree to total it when it is below the threshold. The threshold just creates the point where it legally has to be totaled. If you are unhappy with the way the other person's insurer is handling the claim then you can always turn around and claim it with your own carrier. The conclusion of one carrier as to whether your car is a total loss or not is not binding upon the other. It's possible they can come to different conclusions but the most likely outcome is that both decide it is repairable or both decide it si totaled. A similar dynamic applies to the total loss. If you're unhappy with the value of carrier ""A"" you can always turn around and see what carrier ""B"" will give you for it."

Both side curtains deployed and the car rolled on its side; most damage is to the passenger side and driver side, as opposed to the front/engine and rear.

I don't like to fix anything that ended up on its side or roof because that means there are engine and suspension issues that need to be dealt with.  That said, the appraiser will have to see what the vehicle is worth and compare that to the damages. The condition of the center pillar between the door on both sides, and the manufacturer recommendations for repairing/replacing it can make a difference.  I don't like to give cars like that back to owners who don't want them so I can usually find a way to total it. Some insurers rigidly enforce percentage rules and heavily audit appraiser's files and discipline them if every ""T"" is not crossed and every ""i"" not dotted. Others allow people like me to wave their hand and make a car totaled if it gives them a bad vibe.  An old timer who mentored me years ago had a favorite saying: ""When in doubt, total-out""."

Insurance,3dpop9,PoiZnVirus,2,Sat Jul 18 06:14:44 2015 UTC,"You're in a tough spot, and it may be time consuming for you to recover anything owed to you.  This should, at least, serve as an example to anyone else reading this as exactly what NOT to do when dealing with a health care provider.  I'll get to that in a moment.  First - if you haven't already - contact your insurance company to find out if the provider is In-Network or not.  If they are In-Net, ask your insurance company what can be done about a network provider refusing to file claims on your behalf.  Most insurance companies provider contracts have a provision that providers must file claims for their patients.  If the provider is not in-network, they have no obligation to file the claim for you.  Find out from your insurance how to go about filing claims on your own, get the proper forms from them, etc.  Then go back to your provider and get all the billing details of all visits, etc. so that you can send in your own claims.  Most states have laws that require providers to give you this information upon request within a specified time frame.  It will help if you know what the law in IL says about this so you can gently remind them.  If that fails, you can get in touch with the relevant state office - dept of commerce, or dept of health, or attorney general's office.  As for what to/not to do next time: never pay an in-network provider in advance of them sending a claim to your insurance company- EVER.  The only thing you should ever be asked to pay is the office visit copay (if your plan has a copay).  It should be printed on your insurance card.   And - never pay a bill from a provider (that is In-Network), until you have received the explanation of benefits (EOB) from your insurance company.  And only pay what the EOB from the insurance company says you owe and not what the provider says you owe.  And, AND, always, ALWAYS call your insurance company BEFORE going to any doctor (especially Chiropractors) to find out if they are In-Network for your specific plan or not.  NEVER take the provider's word on if they are in-network."
Insurance,3dpop9,Sandbocks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize I needed to contact my insurance to find out if they are in-network. I asked the chiropractor and they said they called and they were in-network and preferred which means my co-pay was $35 a visit. But I will call them on Monday and see where they actually are in terms of in-network or not and see if they lied.  I only ever paid them the co-pay nothing extra.  Basically, sounds like I might be a little screwed, but it does sound like they also committed fraud and legal action can be taken against them, but I don't know, just saying.  Edit: I just got a letter from my insurance because I am going to this new chiropractic place now and apparently I need pre-authorization from my insurance to do chiropractic stuff and the letter says I was approved. I never got this from the other place. So, they never called for in-network, didn't get authorization, basically didn't do anything."
Insurance,3dpop9,Sandbocks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:10:13 2015 UTC,"They didn't necessarily lie about being in-network.  They just may not have known.  Insurance companies have multiple networks (now more than ever) and being in one doesn't mean they are in all of them.  Most providers don't even know many of the other networks exist.  Also note that your copays may not apply to your out-of-pocket maximum.  Some do, some don't.  While you're on the phone checking networks, you can ask them about this.  And, and, you can ask about pre-auth for chiro too.  It's common that the first X number of visits are sort of pre-approved per year.  I often see plans that do the first 20 visits without preauth, but you need authorization for #21 and beyond in the same year."
Insurance,3dpop9,Sandbocks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:37:45 2015 UTC,"The sketchy thing they did though when I first gave them my insurance, the day after they said ""we checked it out and it will cost more than you paying out of pocket on our special rate"" I asked them if they were sure because it shouldn't be that much that it should be $35 or $75. They got back to me the next day saying they called and that ya it was $35.  Co-pays for me do apply to out-of-pocket. That is how I got to my maximum.  I plan to ask them about the pre-authorization. If it is true that I need pre-authorization before any chiropractor activity that does mean they lied to me correct?"
Insurance,3donji,amyrhiannon84,2,Sat Jul 18 00:03:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think I worded my question correctly.  What I am saying is that if I go to the hospital I'm going to bring something I've written ahead of time stating that I refuse care from any doctor who is not in my network and I would sign the document and date it for my date of admission to be put in my chart while I'm in the hospital. Therefore, if a doctor comes in for a consult and they are not in my network I am not liable for any out network costs because I had already stated I wanted no out of network doctors to be a part of my care."
Insurance,3donji,casusev,3,Sat Jul 18 01:29:38 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but no hospital is going to sign such a thing.   If you're in the hospital, it's one of two situations:   You're either there for an emergency in which you would have no choice on which doctors you see; as it's emergent (life threatening/altering) the hospital isn't going to wait to treat you to be sure the doctor is participating. And the insurance contract likely has an agreement to pay emergent services as if they were in-network.  Otherwise you'll be at a hospital for an elective (scheduled) procedure, in which it will be no surprise who your doctors are. Thus leaving it up to you to make sure they are in the plan's network."
Insurance,3donji,GigginBitches,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"No the hospital doesn't sign anything. It's a piece of paper I've signed and dated stating my wishes to the hospital.

The cost is NEVER anywhere near the ""idea"" they give you it's always a few thousand more.  And there's also someone who, when you go in to the hospital takes your information and makes copies of your insurance card, it could be given to them."
Insurance,3donji,Sandbocks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:16:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know about your specific question, but there are a couple of things you can do to protect yourself.   When shopping for insurance, make sure that the network covers a local emergency room and urgent care. Know where these are so you don't have to look it up when you have an emergency. Just as important, make sure your primary care doctor is in network. If you don't have one then find a plan with local family practice physicians and pick one. Before going to see a specialist, check to see if they are in network.   If you do those three things you will be fine in almost all cases."
Insurance,3donji,Sandbocks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:15:28 2015 UTC,"In an emergency situation, the insurance should be paying the providers in-network per your contracted benefits as a No Choice payment. However you should check your contract to be sure.   If it's not an emergency, the Hospital will likely be willing to work with you to use in-network doctors (though I highly doubt they'll sign what you're describing). However it will be your responsibility to be sure the providers are in-network, otherwise the insurer may not cover it or your out-of-network benefits may apply."
Insurance,3donji,trixstar3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:21:27 2015 UTC,"If it's a scheduled thing - you can work with the hospital in advance to determine the medical group or groups that hospital is affiliated with.

If you don't have auto insurance file the claim against the at fault party anyway and wait to see when liability is accepted. At that point depending on the state you can hire an attorney to try and assist you because business auto policies are usually jerks.

Insurance,3dnza0,chattyyogalady,4,Fri Jul 17 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"The difference is going to be in how the policies want you to react in terms of booking appointments.   An HMO will always be less expensive than a PPO. HMO's will have a primary care physician (family doctor, aka a PCP) that is considered the ""gatekeeper"". You see them first for almost everything- the only exception is emergency room visits. Headache? Go to your PCP. Chest pain? Go see your PCP. They will assess the problem and, if needed, send you to a specialist. This is less expensive for two reasons- specialists charge more money for their services and the network tends to be smaller. (BTW, HMO means health maintenance organization. It's their goal to keep you healthy, thus not needing to use higher-end doctors. Going out of the HMO is not covered, thus out of pocket for you)  A PPO is practically the opposite. They have a wider net of participating physicians, and you can go to them without a referral. Chest pain? Go to a cardiologist. Back pain? Go see a sports medicine doctor. Cold? Go see your PCP. There is no gatekeeper, so treatment tends to happen quicker (you don't have to wait for a referral, so you skip the time you waited to get it. Sometimes it isn't a big deal. But if it takes you two weeks to see your PCP, and the doctor they refer you to has a month wait? That's one of the big downsides to HMO.) Of course, you are paying for this luxury.   The best way to determine which one for you is to look at the network. Are you OK with a new PCP, and are you OK with them dictating which doctors you go see? Your answer to that should answer your question."

I love my current doctor, I've been seeing her for 9 years, and was able to see her under my HMO at my last job for the last 4 years.  She always gave me referrals immediately and the price was low ($20) for a specialist.  For some reason she's not on this new HMO, and I have no clue how to learn about the doctors listed for the HMO.  It's just this long sea of names without faces and no knowledge of their bedside manner!  My current doctor is on my PPO... The PPO also seems more expensive in terms of copays!  It feels like a bad deal in some ways, since I rarely see specialists and I don't have any significant health issues and the copays are higher.  Big downside is I would need a new PCP. :("

The Insured reported that he hit a deer. There was minimal damage to the front of the vehicle, main damage was to the license plate frame. The insured said that it caused his transmission to burn up.   We sent out an investigator. He went to the scene of the loss, found an old deer carcass with debris from the license plate frame, after putting the truck on a lift, it was discovered that the antlers struck one of the metal fluid lines along the side of the transmission crimping it and cutting off the flow of fluid. There was even hair from the deer caught behind the fluid line.   Without a doubt one of the more bizarre and unexpected claims I've handled. Luckily the insured was very understanding.

This is partly why I was trying to get ahold of our case worker, to see what our options were being that I couldn't get them off of the Blue Cross plan.

I take it your BC/BS deductible or OOPM was $6500?  I can only tell you what you should have done, largely because you weren't enrolled in a managed care plan at the time services were received and still had BC/BS.  Because Medicaid is privatized in Michigan, I highly doubt your chances of getting another company to pay the bill, especially because we're several months out now.  It does take 90 days to terminate for non-payment.  However, you can drop people off your plan at any time.  It takes one day.  So, you should have dropped your wife  (and maybe your child) off the BC/BS policy while your citizenship thing was figured out.  That would have allowed them to enroll in Medicaid while you get things sorted out for yourself.  Once you got sorted out, you could enroll in Medicaid separately."

Also, I started trying to drop them off of my plan directly right around October when the acceptance from Medicaid came through, the problem is you have to go through the Marketplace to do that.  I was told by every Blue Cross rep that I spoke to that they couldn't terminate a plan, change a plan, modify a plan, or really do anything except receive the payment.  All of the above needed to be done through the Marketplace and their application.  The problem with that was that since I was the primary applicant on the Marketplace question, the citizenship question that it got hung up on was right at the beginning of the application for the life change (probably the 5th or 6th screen from when you start out of maybe 40), so I could never progress far enough to remove my wife and son.    This problem stayed even if I removed the life change and started a new one, and one brave Marketplace rep proved that it persisted even if you removed the entire Marketplace application.  Now, if I had known that this issue would never resolve itself, I would've stopped payment right in August so that it would be terminated by November, but I never figured it would get to that point.

I have had stable use of clomiphene citrate for over a year now with acceptable ranges of testosterone. It's infuriating that the insurance can say - 'forget what your doctor says, take this other drug' without understanding or even investigating the full situation.  Granted, I can find it for relatively cheap - but it's still 5 times the cost to me. If I were not in a situation to afford it, I would be forced. This seems highly unethical."

The insurance companies go by what the FDA says.  If a drug isn't approved for a particular therapy, then, no matter what the doctor says, it's most likely not going to be covered.  There are plenty of off-label uses for particular drugs.  Some of them good, some of them not so much.  And then there are a lot of quacks out there that will prescribe things that either flat out don't work or could be harmful.  Burzynski comes to mind.  It's unlikely that you'll see CC be approved for low T, given that it's a generic now and no company would be willing to take it to clinical trials for that particular issue.  So, it's going to remain off label for that particular use.  It's not unethical as the drug is still being prescribed and you can still purchase it.  It's just not going to be covered by insurance which is well within their legal rights and reasonable by medical ethics standards given the FDA approval status."

It automatically enrolls you after I think it's 3 times you've filled the prescription. I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to implement that. If you don't mind mail order it's not a hassle, but they need to do a better job notifying their customers.

As for the frame damage repair, you were given inaccurate information.  If the shop completed a repair per proper repair guidelines, there is no safety issue.  If the shop completed a repair to a portion of the frame that shouldn't be repaired, then you have a problem with your shop of choice, not the insurance."
Insurance,3dntyd,potters2643,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:22 2015 UTC,"My understanding of of the frame damage/repair is that they welded a new b-pillar in (in case I have the wrong term, it's the part of the frame between the front and rear doors). The carmax inspector pointed out where the ""factory rivets"" stopped, claiming that this is where the new frame bits were welded together. You can't see any seam or anything like that, just the little rivet circles stop occurring at one point. He claimed that, due to repairing the frame at all, it changes how the car will crumple, and that it's hard to say exactly what will happen, but it will most likely not crumple as designed.  Curious about this, I found both carmax's official statement on frame repairs, and this examiner article: http://www.examiner.com/article/the-consequence-of-vehicle-frame-damage  There are other articles that say similar things. This is the basis of my current understanding of the implications of the frame damage repair. I haven't seen anything that points to studies or anything yet, though, so I don't have any reason to say that most of it isn't necessarily being alarmist. :-/"
Insurance,3dntyd,potters2643,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:41:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and it's definitely not your fault for not knowing.  Auto manufacturers publish ""approved repair procedures"" for frame repairs.  Some area can't be repaired, some can.  Typically a b pillar can, but not always.  Look at it this way, if the shop was able to buy a repair part from the manufacturer, there is an approved repair process.  This means the frame will perform as well as new.  Most likely the new seam is glued and welded, or glued and riveted. The tech at the shop probably ground his rivets waaaaaaay down if he put any there.  The round spots you see are more likely to be weld spots than rivets.  They hold the panel together until the adhesive bonds.  The  carmax inspector is a car salesman.  He knows jack crap about repairs.  He was feeding you a line of bs to get pay you less on your trade.  Edit: as to the article, that is referencing someone trying to straighten a crumple zone.  That is different than replacing the damaged section.  Yours had a Newport put in.  Straightening a crumple is a real bad idea.  No reputable shop will do that."
Insurance,3dntyd,aprillian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:02:54 2015 UTC,"Diminished value is available as third party coverage so you will pursue the DV claim through her insurance. You need to provide them comparable vehicles in your area and an appraisal that supports your belief that the vehicle has diminished in value. Most companies want you to tell them the amount you want and then they review and will either advise they don't agree there is DV, that your amt requested is supported, or will offer a lower amt if you requested too high.   Diminished value is for when your vehicle suffers significant frame/structural damages and you can present it after your repairs are complete. Don't get scared by what other people are saying as far as it going to court or that you need an attorney. You can ask the insurance company what their DV process is and they'll give you whatever their specific guidelines are. It's a part of the claim process and the adjuster will review your DV claim and pay out if it's determined to be owed."
Insurance,3dntyd,BIackAndWhiteCookie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:37:46 2015 UTC,"As a former auto adjuster, I may be a bit biased. You can try to get it, however more than likely you won't get anything. Some states (Georgia) mandate DV on vehicles if damaged, however most states don't.   First you state you see no reason why your vehicle would not be in excellent condition if it weren't for this incident. While this may be true, it more than likely isn't. The amount of vehicles that are actually in excellent condition is extremely low, I'm talking no creases in the seats, absolutely no fading of paint, no dents/dings, no rock chips in the hood, in the same condition it was when it rolled off the assembly line is how an insurance company is going to classify excellent.   Carmax is always the company people used to bring DV claims to me with, along with KBB. Carmax is going to use anything they can to devalue a car. I had to contact one of the inspectors at Carmax when we questioned their value and 'frame damage'. Turns out there was NO damage on the vehicle's frame at all, however according to them, there was. When I asked them to point out the frame damage, they explained if there is ANY modification to the frame rail, they count it as frame damage. In this case, it was paint on the frame rail (I think we replaced a floor or rear body panel). Paint. As frame damage. Also remember they need to flip the car to make $$$.   The amount they will offer you for your car is obviously going to me much less than the amount you will find on KBB. Vehicles on KBB are for sale by a dealer, making a profit. Private party vehicles are cheaper for a reason, and are often more negotiable (however dealer vehicles can also be negotiated). Vehicles for sale on KBB aren't for the value of the vehicle itself, it's what a dealer/individual is asking for a vehicle.   Furthermore, if a vehicle is repaired properly, and brought back to pre-loss confition, there is no diminished value. The vehicle is brought back to the condition it was in before the accident. Why would the value decrease? The key words here being repaired properly. If a frame rail is damaged (how did the frame rail on your vehicle get bent if you were t-boned??) it can be repaired properly with no safety issues. Say if there is a big bend or kinked, it would need to be replaced. Professional repair facilities will have no problem sending in supplements for a rail replacement to bump up the repair cost. If the rail was heated and pulled for 5 hours, that would be an improper repair.   Dealerships have vehicles on their lots that are involved in accidents all the time. Do you think they knock the price down when they sell it because of the accident? Nope. No one knows, and you get the car that was involved in an accident but is documented literally nowhere. Many insurance companies don't report to Carfax, that's why it's junk. Always bring a car you want to buy to a trusted mechanic for inspection before, and possibly a body shop also.   You may have to have an evaluation done yourself, and find comparable vehicles. There will be many hoops to jump through to get DV."
Insurance,3dntyd,Method007,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:30:56 2015 UTC,"Diminished value does have real value, but it works better on much more expensive cars.

Use google, there are many options."

So they're going to be paying it anyway, whether it's reported to their carrier or not.  Ideally you want to get your estimate. Make sure the shop is reasonably firm about the total, (tell the shop what you are doing and that it will be a hassle for them to collect on a supplement, so they are thorough with the estimate), add-in whatever you'll need for a rental car, and get one check from the trucking place to be done with it."

It used to be popular for insurers to sell vehicles to auto body shops when they had accumulated storage, or to individuals like yourself in situations like yours. It was convenient for them. The problem was it was a little too convenient. There were numerous cases of the people in charge of salvage surreptitiously doing dealings with particular vendors and discounting vehicles or selling the best stuff or taking kickbacks or whatever, so many carriers simply mandated that EVERYTHING goes to the auction. The ""one-size-fits-all"" solution.  That said, you have inside knowledge about this bike so your perception of the risk involved in buying it is much clearer than the average salvage bidder.

Insurance,3dlacs,too-many-questions,2,Fri Jul 17 04:45:04 2015 UTC,"Life Insurance Underwriter here. Since you did not know of the relocation prior to your application, it would not be considered a material misrepresentation. You more than likely do not need to tell your current life insurance provider, but it would be smart to tell your agent and see if he thinks it would be a good idea to inform your current issuing company.   As for your other question; foreign travel and residency normally does not increase your premium when traveling to the UK or places that are considered ""A"" countries (good health care, availability of health care, how advanced the country is, etc..). However, a flat extra premium (FEP) can be provided if you are traveling for an extended period of time (like 6+ months), but this is highly dependent on what company you issue your policy with.  I would suggest shopping multiple companies with a third party distributer (not a captive agent) in order to find a good company that is well known to be relaxed on foreign travel.   Finally (sorry about the overkill on the text here), if you don't get a premium that you like or you get a FEP added on, I would ask your agent to shop with a group of reinsurers through whatever company you decide to go to! They can sometimes reduce your rate through reinsuring some of your mortality risk if you are in good health and the only thing raising your premium is foreign travel.   Hope this helps!   Edit: just noticed you said you were relocating. If this is a permanent relocation you are likely to be declined by an american insurance company. I suggest trying a company when you get to the UK, if this is the case!"
Insurance,3dlacs,QC_knight1824,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:36:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information. I've scheduled a meeting with a distributor. While definitely not permanent, my relocation to the UK will probably last about 2 years. Because I'm loosing some of my insurance as I leave my current employment, but won't be traveling to the UK for another 2-3 months, I'd like to purchased insurance before my relocation. Do you think it's likely this will be possible either through a US or a UK insurer before I move?  Again, thanks for the information."
Insurance,3dlacs,QC_knight1824,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:57 2015 UTC,"Since it's two years, i doubt you'll get it from a UK insurer. That being said, insurance in the UK goes by another set of rules entirely (for example; underwriters can pull your grocery records and other personal info that we can't do in the states). I am almost positive a US insurer will cover you for those two years, but they may tack on a flat extra until you come back to balance the added risk. It's also likely that they won't tack on an FEP at all though! All  depends on who you shop with.   Your best bet would be going with a domestic insurance company here in the states and go with a short (10 or 15 yr) term policy that is cheap and will cover you while you are in the UK. When you get back, you can go for a more permanent policy if that is what you wish."
Insurance,3dlf6m,PaperKnucks,12,Fri Jul 17 05:38:14 2015 UTC,"In order to be a covered loss, the cause of the damage must be ""sudden and accidental."" Damage caused by leaks seldom meets that standard. Regardless of how old the mold appears to be, the real question for an adjuster is the underlying cause of the mold/damage."
Insurance,3dlf6m,otterish,6,Fri Jul 17 11:00:53 2015 UTC,"Mold is rarely EVER covered. EVER. If the adjuster covered the loss, they would pay for the direct and physical damage from the water, which would likely be minimal in this case.   Coming from an adjuster: there are not really any certifications that would add value in your case. So long as the guy wasnt brand spanking new, his experience is enough to take one look at it and know its a long term issue. The second you become argumentative, im going to limit my contact with you as much as possible. Wait for the paperwork, then contact his boss. If that doesnt resolve it, a lawyer is your only option. The only way to win in this case would likely be that the carrier determines its cheaper to pay you than fight you."

Insurance,3dlf6m,MSCantrell,6,Fri Jul 17 12:24:15 2015 UTC,"I discussed the denial with one of my restoration contractors, and it is in his professional opinion that the mold is less than 2 weeks old (based on incubation times for certain kinds of mold that are not present, warm humid temps in our area, and absorption rates of drywall bounded by non permeable surfaces).   A good first step is to get this in writing.    My wife is working with our local insurance rep to hit it from that side,    This will be counterproductive. Getting your agent involved is like, ""I'm telling my brother and he's gonna beat you up!"" Your agent has no authority in your claim, virtually always less expertise than your adjuster, and only serves as one more emotional he-said-she-said player. This will not persuade your adjuster or your adjuster's manager. It will just cause them to mentally mark your file as, ""That kitchen leak with the asshole and his agent."" Leave your agent out of it.    Anything else I should be doing in the meantime to bring this to a fair conclusion?   Read your policy. If you want good help from internet strangers, then tell us what policy forms are involved. Even better, scan and post the whole policy (black out all your personal information, we just need to see the contract language).   You might find, on the one hand, that repeated seepage or leakage... over a period of 14 days or more is not your only coverage problem. Your policy might exclude mold coverage entirely, or limit it to $5,000 or some other amount.   Or, on the other hand, you might find your policy has that exception for leaks or mold hidden and unknown to any and all insureds. That might help you out.    So that's step 1, read your policy. Step 2, get that mold report from your mitigation guy stating specifically and clearly what day the water leak started.  Step 3, ask the adjuster whether that written report is sufficient for coverage, or if they need to hire a better expert. If they do need a better expert, they'll hire him themselves, no cost to you.  Step 4, they'll send an Indoor Air Quality Consultant or somesuch, who will test and measure and analyze. Their findings will be pretty conclusive. Step 5, you'll get a coverage decision, yes/no/partly. Your adjuster will have almost certainly reviewed this with his boss by now (because he spent a thousand or two on the mold guy), so boss will be in the loop. That means you can treat the coverage decision as final; take it or sue."

I've suspected we do not have a complete copy of the policy. We've requested a copy of the policy highlighting the exclusion the adjuster referenced; 48 hours later, nothing. But I'll keep pushing.  Another question for you... Regardless of what happens financially, I need to get the house healthy again for wife and kid, so I plan on remediation work to begin next week regardless of decision. Could this affect the decision one way or the other? Both my mitigation guy and the adjuster have photos, moisture readings, etc. so I'd like to think if a second opinion is required, it can be o gained from this collected evidence."

I've suspected we do not have a complete copy of the policy.   You probably don't. You probably have the Declarations pages, which will say what's insured, for how much, and with what policy forms. But generally your insurer won't send you all the policy forms each year they renew the policy.   If you care to share the list of policy forms, though, some of us will have (or will be able to find) the relevant forms and read them with you.    Regardless of what happens financially, I need to get the house healthy again for wife and kid, so I plan on remediation work to begin next week regardless of decision. Could this affect the decision one way or the other?   YES.  A typical set of conditions in your policy would read like this:   HO 0003 10/00 AGREEMENT We will provide the insurance described in this policy in return for the premium and compliance with all applicable provisions of this policy.   B. Duties After Loss  In case of a loss to covered property, we have no duty to provide coverage under this policy if the failure to comply with the following duties is prejudicial to us. These duties must be performed either by you, an ""insured"" seeking coverage, or a representative of either:   1. Give prompt notice to us or our agent;  4. Protect the property from further damage. If repairs to the property are required, you must:   a. Make reasonable and necessary repairs to protect the property; and   b. Keep an accurate record of repair expenses;   5. Cooperate with us in the investigation of a claim;  7. As often as we reasonably require:  a. Show the damaged property;   So on the one hand, if you want coverage, you can't sit around and let the damage get worse. And on the other, if you want coverage, you've got to let them see the damage ""as often as we reasonably require,"" and twice is definitely reasonable. So yes, if you fix things before the mold guy comes, they can tell you ""sorry"" on account of that. Notice that there's no excuse for health. You have to fix enough damage to keep things from getting worse, and no more. Health has no bearing here. (But, IF you have coverage for the water and/or mold, and IF you can document that the water and/or mold made the house uninhabitable, then you've probably got coverage for moving out while somebody fixes it up.)"

Insurance,3dlf6m,Phil_Achio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:40:56 2015 UTC,"This is dead on.  I would add two more things:    Get the place remediated (but make sure the adjuster knows you're doing it).  These claims have a catch 22.  If you fix the loss too quickly, or without the , you've failed to cooperate with their investigation.  If you fix it too slowly, you've failed to mitigate your damages.   This is your insurance company.  They owe certain duties to you to investigate the claim, act in good faith, and only deny the claim in good faith.  Keep a record of your contacts with them (particularly their response to your contractors report) including the dates they were made.  If this unfortunately has to go to litigation, this could be important as there may be some extra-contractual liability for the insurance company failing to deal with you in good faith.  It's really the only leverage you have against an insurance company."
Insurance,3dlf6m,MSCantrell,3,Fri Jul 17 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"OP, I like the answer of /u/MSCantrell, but just as a bit of background on why these claims are not covered it's because 20 years ago there was a whole ""black mold"" craze. Contractors were referring people to industrial hygienists and insurers ended up tearing down whole houses to remediate these issues. This was something that was a problem because when the underwriters calculated the premiums to charge they had not figured for total losses to houses from this ""new"" cause of loss. As such the industry collectively decided to rewrite policies to limit or exclude coverage for mold instead of raising premiums to make up the difference.  If you had an issue of rot instead of mold you might have something of a leg to stand on as some carriers will cut you some slack if it's obvious you didn't know what was happening. But mold is generally blanket excluded.  One other thing that some posters have not mentioned is that if you incurred a significant expense that is ultimately not covered by insurance you may be able to claim a large tax deduction if what you paid-out exceeds 10% of your adjusted gross income. Research IRS form 4684 and/or consult a tax attorney or accountant."
Insurance,3djzsp,bucket46,5,Thu Jul 16 21:57:31 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question is (more than likely based on their policy) yes. The key however is that it is covering THEM, not you, as their policy will provide them coverage on an excess basis due to you being uninsured. Not to mention the fact that it may be illegal for you to operate the uninsured vehicle, should anything happen while they are driving you can and will be held liable as the vehicle's owner. Without your own coverage, the potential buyer's insurer would cover and defend THEIR insured, not you.  Get liability insurance."

Insurance,3djzsp,asuliberty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:13:35 2015 UTC,"It depends what your policy says.  My storage coverage leaves liability coverage active but drops the limit to the state minimum. It also voids all physical damage coverages unless the car has a loan on it.   Some storage coverages do the opposite which is voids liability coverage and only leaves physical damage coverage (or even coverage only for non-collision losses) on the vehicle.  If somebody else is driving your car and has a wreck then your liability coverage is usually (but not always) first in line to pay the damages for the person that got crashed-into. If you had no policy then it would fall back onto the driver's policy, if they have one.  For physical damage to your car there would likely be no coverage for your car unless you have comp/collision. The liability coverage of the person test driving your car would not pay for damages to your car since personal auto policies normally exclude coverage for property that is in your (the test driver's) care, custody, or control.  If you had no collision/comp coverage and the test driver does then it possible his collision/comp might apply to damages to your car. The wording is a bit convoluted but this is how claims are paid when you wreck a rental car or something you're test driving at a dealership.   TL/DR Just put insurance on your car while you sell it and then cancel it after you sell it or put it back in storage. You'll get a refund on any advance premiums you forked out."

Insurance,3djzsp,acortright,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:30:48 2015 UTC,I think the terms of your insurance agreement probably state that you're not supposed to drive it though.

You'll be out of pocket for the amount of your deductible, but your company will pursue subrogation and try to recover the expenses from the other company(once that info is available) and refund you your deductible down the road once that happens(could take anywhere from weeks to months)  I am not even remotely familiar with NY state laws, but that ""waiver"" that the police offer had you sign sounds very strange, I've never heard of anything like that before(I'm licensed to sell insurance in several states in the midwest)."

You'll have to (eventually) file a claim against his insurance company, give your statement of the details of the accident, and then that insurance company will call their customer to confirm the details of the story, and then make a decision on fault based on that.  Hopefully he doesn't try to lie and change details to avoid being at-fault.  If he's a decent person and confirms your story, it should be straight-forward and you'll get your car fixed.  If he somehow disputes the facts you claim, it could drag out and be a mess in trying to determine fault.

Regardless, I don't think its to anyones benefit either way to press the issue of what number the offer is on or whatever, the goal is to come to an agreement.    2) No, the insurance company owes the value of the vehicle.  I don't handle total loss (and never have really worked on the property side), but from what I have seen, repairs to vehicles generally cost more than the value they add to the vehicle.  Putting on a new set of tires doesn't increase the value of the value by the value of the new set of tires (this is by far the most common thing I see, but it follows for all repairs).  You have to remember, the part that came out had some value of some sort, the cost you paid also for the labor to put the new part in as well.  Its really unfortunate that you did the repair so recently to the vehicle, but the only thing the insurance company is going to factor is the value of the vehicle as it was at the time of the accident.  I just don't see any way you will recover the full value of what you paid for the repair I am sorry to say.  That said, a new motor (I would certainly imagine) would increase the value of the auto, but it might be hard to find comparables to match as well.  3) Yes, there is a time limit for the bodily injury claim (generally two years, but it varies state to state) and the property damage claim (that one varies considerable, but at least a year).  Otherwise a suit has to the filed to preserve the statute.  4) Lawyers generally work on contingency fees for the BI settlement (they take a portion of that settlement).  In general, they don't get very involved in the property damage unless something is mucked up or there is some other unusual circumstance.  I don't think I have ever seen an attorney do much at all on a total loss settlement ever, but presumably you could get representation."

Insurance,3dkt7n,Zen_Drifter,3,Fri Jul 17 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"What kind of stupid game are they playing?   I doubt there's any game. Incompetence maybe, but insurers have an adage about claims: ""A good claim is a closed claim"". They just want it gone.     When you do a major repair to a vehicle like that, and then the car is destroyed by someone Else's negligence, shouldn't the insurance company cover that too? Motor wasn't even to it's first oil change.   The insurer is only concerned with the market value of the vehicle. Normally an engine replacement, complete paint job, a new convertible top, or other such major refurbishments will add some value to the car.   In the end, the question is if your truck was sitting on a used car lot (prior to the accident) next to an identical truck with identical options in identical condition, how much more is your truck with the replaced engine worth vs the one it's sitting next to?   It's probably not going to be $6,000 but it's also probably more than $0. It's probably closer to $0 than $6,000.   When the engine was installed may matter. Whether it was gas or diesel may matter. Whether it had a warranty and whether that warranty was transferable may matter.   Is there a time limit in which we must absolutely settle?   If you mean for the insurer then no, unless there is some law in your jurisdiction stating otherwise. For you there is a limit. This is the statute of limitations in your jurisdiction. It may be a year. It may be two, but at some point your rights to bring a lawsuit against the other party are automatically extinguished.   Remember, any offer of anything from another person's insurer is always voluntary. In the end, only a judge/jury can force the insurer to pay anything that they don't want to offer you voluntarily. You can write letters to the department of insurance in your jurisdiction, but for a claimant like yourself who has no contractual relationship to the company you're upset with, all they are concerned with is an insurer's pattern of behavior. The department of insurance generally can't force them to do anything.   If I retain a lawyer and go after the full amount ( truck, engine, plus injury) what kind of time frame and costs am i looking at?   Attorney's rarely want to get involved in property damage claims, though they'll happily handle your injury claim. They'll usually tell you that the reason they don't want to do the property part is because they'd charge you 33% of that just like the injury claim, and that would be less in your pocket that the insurer is already offering you.   Sometimes they'll offer to handle the property claim as part of the larger package on the presumption that when they hand you a lump-sum check at the end that you'll just divide it up in your head differently and be happy with what you got. (Meaning they don't necessarily say they got you ""$XX,XXX for the truck and motor and $XX,XXX for your injury"".. They Just got you a total of ""$XX,XXX for everything"", and you're okay with that.)  Just remember that there's probably nothing they're going to do with your property damage claim for free.   At this point I might consider putting the claim through your own insurer, if you have collision coverage. Your own insurer has contractual and legal obligations to handle your claim within certain time-frames or explain to you in writing why they cannot do so. You may get a similar offer from your own insurer which may give you an idea of the realistic value of your claim. You may also get a better offer. Pursuing the property damage claim with your own insurer and pursuing the injury claim against the other insurer at the same time is no problem."
Insurance,3dkt7n,potters2643,2,Fri Jul 17 04:03:20 2015 UTC,"You are stuck in a common misconception.   Repairs never add value to a vehicle.  They restore it.  If your truck with a running engine is worth $x.  Then that's what it is worth.  If it doesn't have a running engine, then it has a lower value.  Repairing the engine just brings you back to $x.    Now, if the new engine is brand new, with a warranty, and no miles, then it might add a little value.  But not much.    Someone buying a 6 year old truck is not going to pay $6k more for yours, when they can buy another one with the original engine for $6k less.  It just won't happen.    It sucks for you, but they only owe you the actual cash value (plus some other nominal fees depending on the state of venue)"
Insurance,3dj8av,el_monstruo,5,Thu Jul 16 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of your problems sound like maintenance issues. Insurance steps in for sudden/accidental losses. They won't pay for anything which occurs over a certain period of time. Damage to your ceiling from rain entering MIGHT be covered however not if this has been ongoing. Drywall is cheap either way, compare the damaged ceiling to your deductible. Save your insurance for a big event."

Insurance,3dj8av,iwearlederhosen,2,Fri Jul 17 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"First youre going to need to pick one of those things and file a claim for it. They are two separate causes of loss.  The roof leak is minor, I wouldn't call a claim for it. The cause is the leaking boot, which is probably a wear and tear thing. The insurance will cover the water damage, but that's pretty minimal. They will give you some insulation and paint, that's about it.  The leaking bathroom is another issue. You need to determine the exact source of the leak first. The adjuster wont do this. Then you need to determine how long its been leaking. If its obvious that its more than a few weeks, it wont be covered. If its not obvious, you might have a case."

Compare that to another About Us from another insurer I chose at random, which starts with:   protecting individuals and families    I don't think /r/insurance should be a forum for trash talking particular companies, but when a company's main selling point includes the phrase ""keeps you legal"" - I mean that's the absolute bare bones minimum that insurance is required to do and they mention it in big bold letters in their opening marketing statement.  Personally that's the kind of red flag that would cause me to steer away from a particular insurance company in the future.  If they can't find something to brag about other than meeting minimum requirements, there's a problem."

Depending on rates and your policy, filing an at fault claim may hurt your rates more than $700.  Your agent may also be able to get you an official release of liability form, (I couldn't find one in my system but I'll be if I looked harder I'd find it). If you have a company without an Agent, talking to someone without them pushing you off on to claims is going to be rough.  An actual agent doesn't want to see your rates go up anymore than you want them to go up.  I'm with Allstate so PM if you're in good hands and I'll find the form for you."

Insurance,3dj654,JodumScrodum,5,Thu Jul 16 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"OP, /u/forneusFQ made an awesome effort in helping you, and clarified a lot of questions I had as well. You need to pursue your own insurance at this point. If you accept the settlement from the state, you are going to complicate things by then pursuing your insurance, because they're going to be wanting to first figure out what you settled for, etc, before handling your damages, in order to not risk overpaying the claim. In addition to this, I have first hand experience with state laws that give a maximum amount of months during which a claim can be presented against them to recover money paid. In other words, if you drag this out, the state may turn down your insurance claim on the basis that it has been presented too late and you will never get your deductible back. There is no two-ways about it, if they are at fault 100%, they owe you 100% of your money. I have a feeling that the person you talked to didn't know what they were doing. Essentially they are asking you to do a round-about way of this. They are going to end up having to pay the other $500 when your insurance company pursues them, I see no justification for not paying it up front. There is no law on the books I am aware of that absolves them from paying their liability obligations in full. They also have a legal duty to settle, and to settle timely. Make one final attempt to get clarity why you're not getting the full thousand, and then go to your own insurance.    Please note that some jurisdictions/municipalities, in my experience, place a 6-months limit on presenting property damage claims. The clock is ticking."
Insurance,3dj654,f1shbone,2,Thu Jul 16 20:58:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm very confused how this all works. The first person i spoke to in General Services said something similar about the payment. He said something along the lines of getting half of the estimated damage and a deductible? I'm going to have to clarify with them.  Here is something from Title 59:9-2e ""if you have insurance to cover 'physical damage' to your property, the money you are entitled to receive under such policy of insurance shall be deducted from your claim against the State"". Does this make sense to you? Maybe it answers questions.  Are there going to be problems because I am contacting my insurance so late?"
Insurance,3dj654,f1shbone,2,Thu Jul 16 21:45:57 2015 UTC,You've got good questions; best avenue is still to pursue your own insurance.
Insurance,3dj654,mindragon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:58:11 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the advice. To tell you the truth I'm really afraid to. Of all the stories i hear it makes me nervous that it's going to hurt me in the long run despite it being 100% their fault. It's been over three months since the accident at this point, and I don't even know if the stress is worth it.   The damage is minor. If it wasn't a new car that I spent with my own money I would have let it go easily, but I pursued it because it wasn't fair to have to suffer the damage because another driver was careless.   I just really feel like it will result in increased rates or something like that. I barely even had the insurance for two weeks when the accident happen. To my insuranec who knows what they will think.  I really don't know what to do :/   I really appreciate your and /u/forneusFQ advice in this situation. Thank you."
Insurance,3dj654,mindragon,3,Thu Jul 16 23:34:08 2015 UTC,"Insurance Agent here -- regardless of whether or not you contact your insurance company, the accident that has happen will likely be on your record anyway. That said, you SHOULD contact your insurance company. This is what you pay insurance for. They will fight for you to take your side and to get 100% of the money that you deserve from the state. Contact them and put them to work for you.  Given that you are not at fault and this is a small claim, your rates are not likely to rise."

Walk me through this?   an accident three months ago   OK, with you so far.   waiting close to three months to contact them   Contact the state?  That's fine and not really relevant but what caused you to wait 3 months?   I never contacted my insurance   That's fine.   I figured since I wasn't at all at fault I didn't need to contact them since I didn't have to pay anything.   Should be true in theory.   Which I guess isn't the case since the state is self insured.   Lost again.  Self insurance doesn't affect who's at fault for an accident, I don't understand the relevance of this statement.   received a release   OK.  What's it say?   Now they are saying I need to contact them regardless   Who is saying you need to contact whom and why?   if I want the other half paid  the other 500   So the total damage is a grand?  Who paid the first 500?  Is this what the release says?  The state's only paying half?  Also what's your collision deductible?"
Insurance,3dj654,Method007,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"This was a rushed post so I apologize.  I submitted the claim once I received the police report about 6 weeks after the accident. I had 90 days to do so.  The release is for 500 dollars. The damage is estimated around 1000. The state apparently accepts fault by sending this, but they only give you half because they are self insured? I'm still confused honestly.  In order to get the remaining 500 for the estimates, the person I talked to with the state said I need to contact my insurance to get the remaining cost covered. The problem is I never contact my insurance. The person I talked to also said I should always contact my insurance for any accident regardless at fault.  In addition the man I spoke with from state mentioned that my insurance should not increase my premiums or whatever because I was not at fault. It's also illegal I think he said?  I am not sure what my collision deductible is I would need to look.  Hopefully this helps. Rushed again since I'm at work with my head spinning."

If it's the former, I would say that I'd do what Sabrinafaire said and get your records ready and escalate as needed, ideally with the affected person/representative on the line. If it's the latter, issuing a refund should be straightforward"
Insurance,3dg0r1,Method007,2,Thu Jul 16 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"Insurance agent here. Not exclusively health, but still. Your relative probably assumes she had insurance auto-drafted out of her account. Something happened on HER END, and she failed to make payment, so the policy got cancelled. Insurance contracts are always one sided contracts. If terms are agreed upon, you make payments, we provide coverage. Period. No payments, no coverage. Since it's a one sided contract, and people like your relative say they made a payment, but probably didn't. They usually have top notch billing (and billing record) systems because insurance is, indeed, a one sided contract and many people don't value insurance until they need it.  They didn't think it was weird when the company didn't send her 2015's medical card(s) with detailed information about her policy? It happens with life insurance all the time. Abraham has a policy with Evil Insurance Company. Abraham changes banks/address/phone number, but doesn't notify Evil Insurance. Evil Insurance can't withdraw the $20/mo it needs to keep the policy in force. It goes into a 31 day grace period. It sends notifications weekly to Abrahams old address that wasn't properly forwarded, so Abraham never gets those, or perhaps they receive mail from us too much and decide it's not important (even though it says right on it ""THIS IS AN IMPORTANT NOTICE."" And the Evil Insurance Company retention center calls every day but the number is wrong, or they don't answer because ""it's probably just a telemarketer 800 number, won't check my voicemails either."" So Abraham goes on with life thinkin' he's got life insurance with Evil Insurance Company. Years later Abraham dies in a fiery car crash. Abraham's wife is getting his affairs in order, including life insurance from Evil Insurance Co. Thinking she'll have income replacement, and be able to send Mini-Abe to college she calls only to find out they haven't made payments and don't have an active policy! No life insurance benefits! Rather than accept guilt of not having finances in order, Abe's wife blames the Evil Insurance Co for not paying out claims, or not properly trying to contact them when the policy started lapsing. So Evil Insurance co becomes SUPER-DUPER EVIL INSURANCE COMPANY. All caps.  Happens quite often."

Insurance,3dfs09,westsideasses,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:17:49 2015 UTC,From my experience Claims adjusters don't often look to deeply into smaller claims so a bill of sale would do.  Also insurance is there to put you into the same financial position you were in before the loss so if the bike was worth more you may get more than you paid if its worth less...  You will likely get the cost to buy a similar bike minus depreciation minus deductible.  Fingers crossed for a low deductible.
Insurance,3dfs09,Minja78,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:57:27 2015 UTC,"$400 is a big hit and it's a shame your ride was stolen. There is a special place in hell for bike thieves. As suggested by others, check the deductible on your renter's insurance, and then research the actual cost of that year, make, model bike, and that's the amount of your claim, less deductible and depreciation (10% year one and 5% each year after). IE Three year old bike valued at $700 depreciated by 20% = $$560 actual value at time of theft. $560 minus your renter's insurance deductible, say $500 = possible claim payout = $60, if the two if's in this equation are correct, or even close, IMHO you are wasting your valuable time making a claim. . Please check the Information Center at Velosurance for information on ""How Not To Get Your Bike Stolen"". Being totally transparent ; I am an owner at velosurance and all we do is insure bicycles.   My humble apologies for a shameless self promotion."
Insurance,3dfgse,1namu,9,Wed Jul 15 21:19:37 2015 UTC,"It seems to good to be true for only about $10-$15 a month   Nah, that's pretty standard.  Think about the maximum possible loss on an apartment vs. a home or an office building.  Even homeowners policies are less than $1,000 per year many times.   I own a road bike and bikes are not allowed inside the apartment. I feel like storing it in the storage units runs a high risk of theft.   I don't know, I'd never really thought of this before, but according to the Bureau of Justice Stats, theft from outside storage appears to account for about 1% of theft vs. 22% occurring inside the home.  That's not really an insurance issue, find another apartment that'll let you keep the bikes inside if you're concerned.   If I happen to not be using a surge protector to charge my laptop and in an unfortunate circumstance it gets shorted, will I qualify for coverage?   I think so but State Farm doesn't specifically list that as a covered cause of loss on their website (they list lightning but not artificially generated current), so that's a good question to ask before you buy.  But use a surge protector.  They're cheap.   I own lots of costly handmade, ethnic outfits from India. Nearly all of these have been gifted to me and there is no way I can prove their cost since in India, it is not uncommon for a tailor to only make one such outfit. This makes judging the value of them difficult.   I'm stumped on this one.  I mean, there are definitely ways to ensure adequate coverage - (1) make sure the policy is written on replacement cost basis, not actual cash value basis.  (2) you might be able to add these as scheduled items with agreed upon values.  State Farm lists categories of items they would consider for this and clothing is not one of those categories.  So that would be another good question to ask.  But what has me unsure of how to answer this question is if you had to take a guess how much value per outfit are we talking?  Hundreds of dollars per outfit?  Thousands?    My other piece of advice, since these policies are so cheap, you might as well go for broke on the liability coverage.  I know my lease requires $100K in liability, but you can get triple that coverage for like the cost of one beer per month (I judge all my investments by the amount of booze I could get for the same price, do I have a problem?)"
Insurance,3dfgse,forneusFQ,5,Wed Jul 15 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"This is all great advice. The only thing I'd add is that your bike is likely covered by renters insurance regardless of whether it's in a storage unit or in your apartment. Most renters insurance policies cover your property (including your bike) anywhere in the world, inside your apartment or out.  Seconded on upping the liability protection – this is the true ""value"" of a renters insurance policy (imo)."

You're definitely not the first to say this. This makes me wonder if having your guest sue or hold you responsible for their injuries on your premises is a common act. Then again, a stranger did try to sue my dad for stepping on a tiny patch of ice near the curb and claiming to fall rather than just walking on the clean center of the sidewalk.

Insurance,3dfgse,forneusFQ,2,Thu Jul 16 00:47:51 2015 UTC,"Use the surge protector, you'd have no coverage for that.

Insurance,3dfgse,kris721,8,Thu Jul 16 03:14:42 2015 UTC,I would purchase the renters policy but would inquire to see how much a Personal Articles policy would be to insure the laptop and the Handmade outfits.  The personal articles policy would insure your laptop if you bring it out of your home often. Renters would not cover your laptop outside of your home unless its a rare occasion (vacation) or being taken to get repaired.    I work at SF
Insurance,3dfgse,kris721,3,Wed Jul 15 22:01:21 2015 UTC,The laptop should be covered due to theft or fire up to  the policy limits in or outside of the apartment. We just paid out a claim for somebody who got their laptop stolen out of their car along with other items.   I also work at State Farm
Insurance,3dfgse,kris721,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! How stringent is SF with paying out claims? I mean, how does one go about proving that when their car was broke into, their laptop got stolen?"
Insurance,3dfgse,brucingpinky,2,Thu Jul 16 02:03:31 2015 UTC,"State Farm has been wonderful with claims! Auto claims are usually finished up within a week and it only took about two weeks to finish up that theft claim for our client. Insurance is different in every state though, so I would double check with the agent/team member that the renters policy would cover theft away from your apartment."

Insurance,3dfgse,brucingpinky,2,Fri Jul 17 03:37:27 2015 UTC,"All she had to do is file a police report and list everything that was stolen and how much it's worth. But the best advice I could give anybody about renters insurance is to take pictures of everything. Go through your apartment and take pictures of each of the rooms and everything that is a little more expensive. Save those pictures in a cloud or jump drive (just be sure to store the jump drive somewhere else). This will really help the claims process if something horrible were to happen, like a fire or someone coming in and stealing a bunch of your stuff. It really quickens the claims process because they will ask you to list the things you had and how much they were worth. Because who can remember exactly what they had when they're freaking out about the fact they just lost everything they had? Hope this helps! :)"

Also, since you work at SF, would you happen to know if I can get the policy in my dad's name even though I signed the lease? He has SF car insurance, so there is the discount."

Insurance,3dejo7,chris41658,6,Wed Jul 15 17:49:27 2015 UTC,"Why add them? As long as they have permissive use of the vehicle you should be fine since the insurance follows the car, not the driver. Their insurance should cover the excess in case of an incident if I'm not mistaken."

Insurance,3der95,Lilyo,7,Wed Jul 15 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"Sounds like some one is giving a friend some happy out of network allowance benefits instead of using the minimal payments from an in-network lab.  Does it say that your insurance paid them $5000?  Have you contacted the office or the lab about this?  You have the right to go where you want within the limits/allowances of your insurance.  I'd be more concerned with the verbal agreement to send the bill to the doctor if you receive one.  Not wanting your insurance to be billed $5000 is nice, but it's not going to raise your premiums because they paid out.  Those just raise on their own."
Insurance,3der95,optical_mommy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"I have actually seen this before and I think it was with the same lab. Just because they bill an outrageous amount, doesn't mean insurance will pay that much, or any at all. If they are contracted with your insurance, then they will have a contracted price, regardless of what was billed. But I've seen some of these weird labs that will write off anything the insurance doesn't cover. And if your doctor says send him the bill, then that is likely one of those labs. It is very unusual, but doesn't mean it is shady if the provider only takes the amount insurance pays. But if this isn't the case, and your doctor backs out of the agreement, the appeal him like crazy for sending your labs out-of-network. And in the future, request a lab order and go to quest yourself for your lab work."
Insurance,3desw2,jbrogdon,3,Wed Jul 15 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"Just keep in mind that Work Comp is not purely just to cover medical expenses.  It also replaces your wages while you cannot work and possibly pays out for future hardship, and pain & suffering.  If the owners/officers just work in an office and are at low, low risk for any type of injury then it's probably not much risk at all to exclude them from the work comp.  But if the owners/officers are doing labor of any kind, they could be losing out on a LOT of coverage and money in the event of an injury.  To get reasonably close to replacing everything you get with Work Comp coverage would require individual health insurance, long term disability, and short-term disability coverage."
Insurance,3desw2,joeboo5150,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:27:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks.. that's a good point.  Does work comp typically pay 100% of lost wages?

Insurance,3desw2,joeboo5150,2,Thu Jul 16 18:31:04 2015 UTC,"It varies by state, but most states pay 2/3 of your wage via work comp.  Some states require that figure to also include the value of your employee benefits as well as your hourly wage/salary when figuring up the 2/3, so in those states you end up getting more than just 2/3 of your normal wage.  All work comp benefits are set by law at the state level, you might want to check your local state's work comp laws to find out the exact amounts and coverages you would be dealing with."
Insurance,3desw2,joeboo5150,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:03:01 2015 UTC,well that was an education - it's 2/3 in my state and capped at $318k for TTD and PTD!

When shopping for health insurance, remember that cheapest premium doesn't always mean cheapest overall.  Generally plans that you co-pays (rather than co-insurance like your plan has) for primary care and specialist visits are cheaper than plans that require you to meet a deductible before co-insurance kicks in.    You can try to negotiate a cheaper rate but you're already getting the insurance negotiated rate."

Cost sharing means that you and the health plan will share the cost of your care.  How much falls on you vs. the plan is what determines the cost of the premium.  The more on the plan, the higher the premium.  The more that's on you, the lower the premium.  Anything you get off the exchange/marketplace will include no cost preventive care.  Preventive care basically means you are otherwise healthy, have no symptoms of any kind, you're just going in for a check-up or regular screening like a pap smear or mammogram."

I once had health insurance where the nearest primary care doctor was 75 miles away and the nearest in-network urgent care was 60 miles away - that wasn't a good situation."
Insurance,3de32a,LASuperdome,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:56:26 2015 UTC,"Kaiser is a closed HMO (you can only use their doctors/facilities/participating hospitals unless they refer you out, which they pretty much don't do unless they don't have a particular specialty you need in house).  If their local presence is significant, and you don't already have a doctor you want to keep seeing, I have found that their coverage is pretty hassle-free and their medical centers are often like one-stop shopping for all your medical needs.  They are very good at coordinating care and rarely let someone fall through the cracks (for example, your primary care provider can refer you to a specialist and often make the appointment on the spot).  If you'd rather go with a more traditional health insurance plan, I have used both Aetna and UHC and both in this area covered what they were supposed to without hassle but I had to take a more active role in coordinating things than with Kaiser.  A lot depends on your local network.  I'd ask your coworkers what they think of them and why.  Edited to add:  both my child and nephew had complicated/life-threatening medical needs with Kaiser and Kaiser really came through for them.  I'm very impressed with the way they take care of young kids.  Also, at least here, you can access mental health services quickly with them.  I was told Aetna's mental health network--again, where I live--is pretty bare."

Insurance,3df8lq,Cicatrized,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:45:46 2015 UTC,Yes. You would need an endorsement added to the policy stating what the agreed value is. There is usually an additional cost for the coverage and some companies will require you to have an appraisal done as proof of value.

Insurance,3dbl12,Should_I_File,2,Wed Jul 15 00:22:45 2015 UTC,"YMMV, of course, but here's my experience underwriting for my carrier. Disclaimer: I'm not a licensed agent.  Your glass claim on the auto probably isn't worth it. For my carrier, you'd be OK if it was your only claim, but the moment you had another, more substantial claim, you'd see your renewal premium and kick yourself for turning in what will ultimately be a $150 glass claim.   As others have said, your condo insurance is most likely dirt cheap, so even a 50% increase isn't that much; however, these claims will remain with you for 3-5 years, depending on the state. Do you have any intent, or is there any possibility that you might need full homeowners insurance in the near future? If so, I myself wouldn't turn in the theft claim. This loss would impact a future home policy by a similar percentage (not necessarily 50% - that was just an arbitrary figure). But even if you're going to be sticking with the condo, just keep in mind that if you later have another, larger claim that you absolutely have to turn in, your rates are really going to go up, you'll kick yourself again for turning in such a minor claim, and you'll be real close to a nonrenewal, at which point you'll have to start looking at specialty carriers for your condo insurance. And let me tell you, they won't be cheap."

I am a licensed agent and I'd have to disagree.  A not-at-fault claim this small won't affect much at all even with a larger claim attached with any company I write for.   Will the larger claim ding you?  Yes, but the smaller claim won't matter since it's not-at-fault. If you don't use your insurance when you need it I don't see why to even have those coverages.  File a claim and recoup some of the losses."

Insurance,3dbl12,eastindywalrus,3,Thu Jul 16 01:55:08 2015 UTC,"Agents often tell customers not to file claims because it goes against their office's numbers. In this case, you absolutely should file claims and recover at least a portion of your loss. You've been paying premiums for however long. Use your insurance when you need it. Your auto rates shouldn't be affected. Your property rates might be, not because you did anything wrong but because you may lose a discount (like a claims free discount or something similar). If that's a concern then ask your agent to email you a quote on the amount and duration of the surcharge to see if that amount is more or less than the value of your claim. If you decide to file a claim then call the company's direct claim line and file it yourself."
Insurance,3dbl12,1NSUR4NC3,9,Wed Jul 15 03:08:58 2015 UTC,I would absolutely advise a client not to file a claim on their homeowners/condo policy in this situation. I can think of very few rating situations where the increased cost on the fire policy wouldn't be more over the next few years then the $500-700 paid out for this claim. Not to mention that a second claim within a few years would likely get the client dropped from a standard carrier. This response has nothing to do with my desire to keep the 'offices numbers' low and everything to do with the angry conversation that inevitably follows when a rate is hiked for years because of a small claim. I am surprised that the agent didn't simply run the numbers of what the policy would cost after the claim and let the client make a decision based off of that.  I would advise the client to claim on the auto policy. there is no reason not to.
Insurance,3dbl12,Redrising1,5,Wed Jul 15 03:18:09 2015 UTC,This. I have had numerous conversations over the last few years with customers upset when they get non-renewed by the company for filing multiple small HO claims.
Insurance,3dbl12,Rebound91,3,Wed Jul 15 03:37:14 2015 UTC,"But she has condo insurance, not homeowners/dwelling insurance.  Condo insurance is generally dirt cheap(comparable to renters insurance) in most areas, so even if she took a 50% rate hike due to a claim surcharge, that might only amount to $100 a year or so.  I would agree to not file a theft claim on a homeowners policy whose premium is $1000+ a year, for the sake of collecting a few hundred dollars, but there's a good chance she'd come out ahead on her condo policy.  She should ask her agent what the price of her condo policy would be with a claim surcharge on it, and how long she would be surcharged (3 years? 5 years?).  Her agent should be able to easily quote this for her so she can weigh her options."

I've actually personally been in this boat where someone broke my passenger window and caused ~800 dollars in damage.  I also have a 250 deductible.  The claim is comp/not-at-fault and will not cause your premium to go up unless you have other claims that are similar.  I have no clue why your agent told you not to, but from the info you've given you do have reason to be losing confidence in that agent."

Currently as an account coordinator (between assistant and manager) i make $60k. AM/AE will take at least 5-7 years. salespeople make more, but you need to know lots of people already since mid-market insurance sales is very relationship based.   for reference i work at one of the top 100 independent brokerages in the US by revenue. if you have any questions i'm happy to answer."

Whether you're ultimately interested in training in an insurance role or not, it's a valuable skills that would likely get your application noticed at larger companies.

Insurance,3dasmt,forneusFQ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:55:58 2015 UTC,"An underwriter is someone who works for the actual insurance company. They review policy submissions for acceptability. They will make sure that policies meet both the underwriting guidelines of their employer and those of the state in which they are writing the piece of business. Depending on the type of policy, their job could be as simple as reviewing Motor Vehicle Reports and loss histories for applicants, or visiting a large commercial or industrial structure for a physical inspection.   The selling role you're looking into here is going to be on the agency side. A great deal of agencies are independent agencies, meaning they work with multiple different carriers so as to allow their customers a variety of options to best suit their needs. Others are captive agencies, which are your State Farms, basically, where the agent(s) are restricted to writing with one company only. The former are not employees of the insurance company. The latter, for all intents and purposes, are. So, to answer your question: yes, underwriting is something you could move into later. Whether it's at your company or not would depend on what agency structure you're looking at. I will note, however, that in my experience, I've seen more people go from underwriting to working at an agency, rather than vice versa.  (On a side note, underwriters are generally salaried with no commission. If you're looking for a big bucks, you'd be better off working as a darn good agent. I'd you're looking for stability in your payments, underwriting is the way to go IMO.)"

Insurance is only required to license(license plates) a car.  You could stay on your temp-tag, transfer the title, and sell the car before you would ever need an actual plate(which requires insurance)  It looks like this is the case in Michigan as well http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1585_1587-76278--,00.html  Zero mention of any insurance requirement for simply transferring a title on a vehicle.  The insurance is only required if you want a permanent license plate.  That being said, I wouldn't condone driving a car without insurance, it's a huge risk.  Since it sounds like you are trading in the vehicle to a dealer for a new vehicle of your own, get insurance quotes for the new vehicle you plan to buy.  Start a policy on the temporary vehicle and then switch it to the new vehicle a week later.  That way whatever money you paid to start the policy will just apply to the insurance for your new car, and you can continue on with that policy since you'll need insurance on it.  It will make the purchase process on the new vehicle a lot simpler if you already have existing insurance in place when you step on the car lot."

Insurance,3dan7s,joeboo5150,2,Tue Jul 14 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, she does not. And I didn't myself until I have subsequently changed my policy. Small claims, as you say, would likely be a waste of our time and I don't think in MO the owner can be held liable in any manner.   I will reiterate that in the police report she claimed the driver co-habitated with her and she then declined to file any charges or the report of a stolen vehicle. Does this give us any fodder?"
Insurance,3dan7s,dunno260,3,Tue Jul 14 20:49:12 2015 UTC,"Potentially, it is sort of a gray area you run into.   I would press if charges weren't filed and especially if there is any evidence the person drove the car before, but the policy term is non-permissive use, not stolen.   If the person didn't have a reasonable belief they were entitled to drive the vehicle, seems like a solid denial to me."
Insurance,3dan7s,halfNelson89,2,Tue Jul 14 23:16:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like he was driving a stolen car. Her insurance won't pay, you need uninsured insurance coverage."
Insurance,3dan7s,broseph23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:09:03 2015 UTC,"Sounds like non permissive use by the driver. Fair claim denial to me. Police reports are not proof of negligence or fact, they are only an officer's opinion/summary on a case. If their insured is adamant that the driver didn't have permission, there's no coverage. It sucks for your gf, but this is the risk that she took when she decided to not have collision on her policy. Good luck to you both"
Insurance,3da8ev,lodeezy,5,Tue Jul 14 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"Just start it now and tell the companies that you are married.  I don't know of a single company that would demand to see a marriage certificate.  They might question why her last name is different on her drivers license or something, but just tell them that she hasn't got around to changing it(not uncommon)  If it's only 1 month away, you might as well.  Heck, you're saving your insurance company extra trouble as well of having to go back and change all of your policies again in a month once you are officially married.  As an agent, I usually go ahead and set up a couple as ""married"" on our policies as long as they are already engaged and living together."
Insurance,3da8ev,joeboo5150,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:54:58 2015 UTC,I don't think they'll even ask about the names being different.  Many women choose not to change their names after marriage nowadays.

Insurance,3da8ev,MyRedditUsername3,2,Tue Jul 14 20:45:00 2015 UTC,Most agents with a brain will rate you as married with both cars on the same policy. Some states may have specific restrictions though. It's also a little dicey if you two don't already live together because vehicles are supposed to be rated at their garaging location.
Insurance,3da8ev,fiveeightthirteen,2,Tue Jul 14 18:57:39 2015 UTC,"You should ask your agent. The company I have auto and renter's through will do bundle policies for engaged couples as well as married couples, and I assume that's fairly common."

Insurance,3daw43,throwaway080713,3,Tue Jul 14 21:16:08 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I'm following.  Do you think they are billing insurance companies for services that aren't actually being performed?    If that's the case definitely put in an insurance fraud complaint at this website.  Medical provider fraud is a rampant problem.  Edit: you can put in an anonymous complaint at that website.
Insurance,3daw43,LASuperdome,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:34:35 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say because from my professional opinion, I definitely would not call what they are doing ""ABA"" even though they claim to.  So from my point of view they are billing for services not performed.  And I do know of a time where a therapist flat out put on her progress note that no goals were targeted that day, basically saying they didn't work on anything the insurance companies were paying for.  There's just something very sketchy about the company based on my experience there and I feel a need to report.  Thanks for the link!"
Insurance,3daw43,LASuperdome,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:19:57 2015 UTC,It's hard for me to give a definite answer.  Insurance companies won't pay for services if no medical evidence is attached to the bill.  If they are falsifying medical reports to get the services paid then that is a big problem.    Sometimes insurance companies will reduce the billing code if there isn't evidence to support that code.  Like code 99183 is the billing code for a routine office visit.  If they don't submit enough evidence to warrant payment for that code the insurance company will drop the code to 99181 or 99182.  When you submit a complaint they will do an investigation.  It's possible nothing could happen if the evidence isn't there.  The medical provider wouldn't know they have been investigated until there is enough evidence to file charges.
Insurance,3daw43,trophotaxis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"I was going to say you should report them to the BACB too, but after googling it, it looks pretty involved and probably not anonymous. :/ If the treatments plans aren't backed up by data, health insurance companies definitely wouldn't want to be paying for it.

Insurance,3daw43,UnhelpfulReply,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:15:09 2015 UTC,"Even if the BACB complaint could be anonymous, I don't even know if I could report them because they don't even have a BCBA heading the company (yet another reason I don't agree with this company's practices and claiming to be doing ABA).

Insurance,3da6rz,tawayyesterday,3,Tue Jul 14 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"For the most part, insurance companies are the same. None of them really want to pay claims, but they all do. Some of it comes down to the agent representing you. I have had good experience with Kemper and Travelers though. The other question to ask your agent is after hours customer service? Travelers has customer service available from 7am-11pm (only if the agency pays for it, so it might not be an option for you). I'm not sure what Kemper's after hours customer service is.   I work with companies that offer after hours customer service on nights and weekends because I think it's nice for the client to be able to access (add/delete coverage/vehicles) even when the office isn't open."

Why not go with a company like Allstate or in some states State Farm offers great rates for combining auto and home. I just know that in some states, State Farm has terrible home rates...but I tend to shy away from companies that aren't as translucent as the bigger guys"
Insurance,3da6rz,fiveeightthirteen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:59:58 2015 UTC,Pretty easy to find bad reviews for every insurance company out there:  http://www.consumeraffairs.com/insurance/allstate_auto.html  http://www.consumeraffairs.com/insurance/statefarm_auto.html  The only difference is that the bigger guys might have a smart phone app--though my agency has a full service app where all of our carriers connect to the clients' account--and the bigger guys pay for marketing. You can't argue that those higher premiums don't pay for the $900 million paid in marketing.
Insurance,3da6rz,MyRedditUsername3,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:03:54 2015 UTC,"Allstate's website is never going to go down..you can change your policy ONLINE without having to go through two people and setting up an appointment with your agent. My statements come from being in the insurance industry since 2003...the smaller companies always tend to have customer service issues, and their policies don't cover all of what Allstate/State Farm will cover. Now, I agree that those bigger companies aren't for EVERYBODY. I have allstate, and I pay $140 per month in NY for my car."
Insurance,3da6rz,fiveeightthirteen,2,Wed Jul 15 20:18:10 2015 UTC,"Every one of the companies I represent have online platforms and/or apps where the policy can be managed by the user. I've yet to hear a complaint from a client regarding the website. Just because you've never heard of the company doesn't mean they're sub standard.  Additionally like I said before, my agency has a smartphone app that allows the client to manage their policy regardless of what carrier they're with. That way if we decide to switch to a different company, they don't have to set up a new online account with a new carrier. Some of the independent agencies are behind the tech trend and that may be your experience which could point to why you're so jaded against it. Not all brokers are behind the times and eventually those out of touch agencies will fall too far behind and become completely obsolete."
Insurance,3da6rz,MyRedditUsername3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:55:14 2015 UTC,"And being an Indy Agent, could you elaborate on the differences in policies OTHER THAN THE COST? Are there policies that don't offer the same amount of coverage as say a SF or AS would?"
Insurance,3da6rz,fiveeightthirteen,2,Thu Jul 16 14:48:34 2015 UTC,"Sure--I can't speak for all of AS or SF's policies in other states but I am pretty well versed in them in my state as I used to work for both.  In SC (and in many other states including CA and TX), Allstate only offers replacement cost on the roof if it's less than 10 years old. After that it turns into an ACV coverage. My five preferred companies offer replacement cost on the roof regardless of age (they still have to qualify through underwriting so a 45 year old roof isn't going to cut it). Sure, like many other indy agents, I have non standard companies where I can cover the home/roof to ACV if needed. I would only do this if the home did not pass underwriting by any preferred company.   Also in SC, State Farm has a functionality endorsement meaning if there is a loss, they are only obligated by policy language to replace the loss to be functioning. For instance, if you have a kitchen fire and have custom cabinets and nicer countertops that were totaled, SF only has the obligation to replace with anything that works so they are allowed to just put in cheap cabinets and laminate countertops. This obviously doesn't always happen because the agent is sometimes able to argue with the claim adjuster enough to give a little more on the claim check.  Some companies in coastal states only use percentage deductibles for wind and hail. This means that after a hailstorm, an insured with Allstate might have to pay $3-4k out of pocket to replace a roof because they have a 1% ded on a $300k home.   My companies also offer both HO-3 and HO-5 home policies and as far as special coverage on personal property, the coverage might as well be the same from company to company. This might be where you can get off by saying that independent agents don't offer as much coverage as AS because we offer HO3 policies when AS is all HO5.   All of this said, I'm not sure why you keep getting downvoted or why you downvoted me because I think we're having a pretty civil discussion regarding captive and independent companies. In general though, it's nearly impossible to just compare a State Farm policy with an Allstate policy with a Travelers policy. Allstate frequently opens new companies (I think they're on ""House and Home"" now compared to an older policy) so not everything is clear without actually examining the dec page and policy jacket."
Insurance,3da6rz,SnackyFace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:39:01 2015 UTC,"I'd like to mention as well that in NC Allstate only offers the HO3 policy form while Kemper offers the HO3, HO5, and HE7 with the 3221 endorsement (check it out, it's a NC form.) Kemper also offers blanket value for the policy so you coverage A, B, C, D as one lump sum to use as you want. I have written both Allstate and Kemper policies and I can say that Kemper is not a bad carrier, they just had some rate issues at one point that pissed a lot of people off because they were so cheap for what they were offering. Underwriting is also a major factor so you might have a lower premium from Kemper due to more stringent underwriting. Kemper also has a service center, too, but the agent has to purchase it. Travelers got nailed in NC with storms so they backed off pretty hard, it gave a lot of agents some salt. However, Kemper did the same thing and so did Allstate, so YMMV.   As online access, Allstate doesn't even have online access for their commercial insurance so if you don't call your agent or call center (not open on the weekends) you can't pay your bill or get certificates or ID cards. So don't think big carriers means top trends.   Not all policies are created equal. I would look at what the definition of an ""insured"" is and an ""insured vehicle."" That will make a lot of difference as to who is covered, such as for permissive vehicle use. For homeowners, check your exclusions such as trampoline and dog bit liability. I would also look at your internal limits for certain items such as jewelry, which I last saw Allstate having lower limits ""out of the gate"" than Kemper, meaning more instances of incidental E&O avoidance for Kemper agents than Allstate for those kinds of losses."
Insurance,3da6rz,Hitchd,3,Sun Jul 19 06:42:34 2015 UTC,"You need to ask your agent what happens in this specific case: You lend your car to a friend to drive and they get in an accident. Does the coverage on the car drop to the state minimum? It does in California, which is why I do my best to set my clients up with other companies. Each state is different, so its best to clarify with yours.   Kemper in CA has some additional fees for cancellation that other companies do not have. So keep this in mind if you think you may cancel and change carriers midterm."
Insurance,3da6rz,Hitchd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:36:35 2015 UTC,Interesting. So Kemper specifically does that in CA?   I was an auto claims adjuster for seven years in NY and I never saw a company adjust coverage that way.   I'll ask. Thanks!

If your plan is Traditional, you pick one primary doctor/dentist and you stay with using them unless they need to refer you to another specialist.  With ""Open Access"" you can use anyone within the Humana network at any time.  It sounds like her current dentist is not part of that network, so she would not be able to switch to him at any point, that is, unless she wants to go to him and pay completely out of pocket just like she has been up to this point.

Insurance,3d99to,Sternreisender,2,Tue Jul 14 16:26:28 2015 UTC,I've been scratching my head at this as well. Here's what I was told: The truck had mechanical failure. My driver pulled off to the side of the road in a location that was close to flat ground but not completely flat. The ground was soft so he lowered the landing gear on some wooden blocks that took up more surface area than the feet of the trailer would have. He tried to back another truck under the trailer and (im unsure at this point if the other truck bumped the trailor) the right foot of the landing gear slipped off the block. this made the whole load shift right and it teetered over onto it's right side.

You can get the repairs done through Amica, subject to your deductible, but you'll need to speak to Geico yourself to pursue the diminished value. How you do that, I can't say having not worked that portion with Geico, but in general an appraisal of the vehicle, personal research, and dealer quotes are all options for you.

Insurance,3d833y,FLICK_MY_BEAN,6,Tue Jul 14 06:22:51 2015 UTC,"Technically, you will be covered if you drive either car, even without being on the policy as long as you have the owners permission to drive it(it isn't stolen), assuming you aren't specifically excluded on either policy.  If you are driving it pretty regularly, you probably should be added to the policy as an operator, but if it's just a once-in-a-blue-moon type deal you wouldn't really need to bother.  You wouldn't be able to get a policy of your own on either car, since you do not own the car, you have no insurable interest in either vehicle.  The owner/titleholder is the only one that can insure a vehicle.  Another issue you might run in to is their insurance companies might see that you are a licensed driver living in their household(if your state drivers license lists that address) and they might require that you be listed as an operator since you live in the home.  At this point, you would probably be able to be added to one, but not both.  If you are added as an operator on one vehicle, you would then be able to provide proof of insurance to the 2nd company showing you are already insured, and they may not have to list you on their policy as well.  Insurance companies are just VERY wary of licensed drivers in a household that are not insured anywhere.  One perk of being added to one of the policies as an operator, is that this will count towards your continuous insurance coverage, so if you do go out and get a car of your own you won't be dinged for not having current insurance with whichever company you eventually go with.

Makes me not driving the big-ass SUV to go get my stuff yesterday feel pretty silly... but better safe than sorry. Driving without insurance is no joke anywhere, but in NJ they bring the hammer. And of course I'd prefer not to cost myself and other people many thousands of dollars if something does happen (that was my thinking yesterday anyway). They do plan to give me one of the two cars for some weekends when I have to drive out for work so I think it's definitely in my best interest to be added as an operator.  Thanks again. You rock.

Insurance,3d6nyf,eneka,3,Mon Jul 13 23:03:52 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess (depending on tax/labor rates for your state) I'd say it should only take 1 hour (maybe 1.5) to get the scuffing/scraping out, probably about an hour or so to remove/install the bumper, and another hour and a half or so to paint it.  So all together I'd say you're probably looking at something around $500-$750.  You could also try to use some M8 rubbing compound to get the paint transfer off and see if you can live with the scratches that remain.  That way, a claim isn't even necessary.  My fiance' got into a similar accident earlier this year, and once I was done compounding out the scuffs you could never even tell anything happened.  Anyway, I digress.

It is not the kind of thing that I do on a daily basis, but I'm reasonably certain that our Financial Services could craft something together if it doesn't already exist (which, again, it might).  As others have said, I think that the basis for the coverage would be a Professional Liability form, but it would likely have to be crafted to apply to this kind of circumstance since I don't think that most Professional Liability coverage forms would automatically pick it up.  Most likely it would not pay for damages if the insured were actually found guilty of fraud (that would be an uninsurable moral hazard, obviously), but it would pay for defense, which seems to be the intent here anyway.  I would tell your client that he needs to find an insurance broker with a fairly robust Financial Services unit if he wants to pursue this kind of coverage.  Generally speaking, that's going to exclude the captive agents and a lot of the mom-and-pop small agencies (no offense intended to those folks, but this is not the kind of thing they do, which will require a decent level of expertise to get done right).  Any of the large national brokers will be able to accomplish this, but lots of boutique agencies that deal in the unusual would also have the ability, although any of them might decide to bring in an intermediary like me for our specific expertise."

You are exactly right that paying the damages is not the intent, simply because Creditor 2 has no money damages under the state statute we're dealing with.

From a legal standpoint, if creditor 1 already foreclosed, or initiated foreclosure of the collateral then yes, creditor 2 would want to include them in the suit. However, if a proper contract was executed the company should be indemnifying creditor 1 for the suit.

Insurance,3d0kt0,f1shbone,4,Sun Jul 12 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"Without knowing what the ""coverage issue"" is, it's hard to say. It could be that the driver was not using the car with permission, which would likely absolve the owner of any liabilities. Barring that, both the owner and driver would be liable for the damage and any good lawyer would advise naming both in any suit."
Insurance,3d0kt0,key2616,0,Sun Jul 12 15:02:35 2015 UTC,"That depends on the state, for example Michigan has an owner's liability statute but Ohio does not."
Insurance,3d0kt0,northofindy,2,Sun Jul 12 15:30:00 2015 UTC,Ohio places the vehicle policy primary as well for liability.
Insurance,3d0kt0,f1shbone,-1,Sun Jul 12 21:33:03 2015 UTC,I was referencing the part where you said both the owner and driver would be held liable for the damage. I believe  only about 11-12 states have owner's  liability statutes.  In all the other states only the driver can be held liable.
Insurance,3d0kt0,northofindy,4,Sun Jul 12 22:13:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but you are incorrect. We're pretty much always on the hook for damages first as the policy on the car. The reason for this is because you can have a license and not have insurance if you don't own a car, but if you own a car you have to have insurance on it. The policy on the vehicle is generally almost always primary for liability. Coverage and policy follow the vehicle."
Insurance,3d0kt0,f1shbone,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"I think you are confusing providing coverage with being held liable.    Person A owns a car and Person B drives it and gets in a wreck.  In the vast majority of states Person A cannot be held liable for for the damage  caused by the accident.  Now Person B can get coverage from Person A's policy and that policy will pay for the damage if Person B qualifies as an insured but that is definitely  NOT the same as Person A being held liable.  Let's play out the above situation in Michigan and Ohio.  In Michigan, which has an owner's  liability statute,  both Person A and B can be held liable and sued for the loss.   However across the border in Ohio only Person B can be held liable for the wreck, naming Person A in suit would be improper and they would get dismissed immediately   (except in the case of negligent entrustment  or something like that)"
Insurance,3d0kt0,northofindy,2,Sun Jul 12 22:28:56 2015 UTC,"Okay. So on what basis do we then extend coverage as primary on the vehicle, if not on the basis of tort law and legal liability? My point is that the claim should be presented against the owner first and foremost. It's the primary policy in an accident. If you're talking about criminal law, that's entirely different."
Insurance,3d0kt0,f1shbone,0,Sun Jul 12 22:37:27 2015 UTC,"Who is talking about criminal law?  Lawsuits arising out  of accidents are civil and statues determine who can be held liable for a loss.  If you go back to the original post coverage was denied and the OP wanted to know who can be held legally liable for the loss, presumably  to file in small claims court as he is asking if his client can go after both the owner and the driver.  In all states he can go after the driver, in a few states he can also go after the owner."
Insurance,3d0kt0,northofindy,2,Sun Jul 12 22:44:54 2015 UTC,"Vicarious liability applies here. Ohio does not protect the owner of a vehicle from liability. I think you're talking about liability as it relates to property when you're talking about owner's liability. If there is a legal principle which absolves the owner of the car from liability, there is no legal justification to pay under the liability coverage of the car. In the absence of legal liability, you deny coverage. Since you referenced Ohio specifically as an example, let's take a look at the law you're referring to. Is there a link or statute # that we can look at? You also said that only in a few states can he go after the owner. Which are these states, that appear to be in minority based on your statement?    Or think of it this way. If the law protects the owner from liability, what is the justification for insurance to pay a claim? You can't present a claim against them in tort, so if there is no tortfeasor what is the basis for paying a claim under liability coverage?"
Insurance,3d0kt0,f1shbone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:00:44 2015 UTC,The basis and justification  for paying the claim is that a permissive driver would meet the definition of an insured as defined by the policy and the insurance company would have a contractual obligation to provide coverage.   As far as proof that Ohio doesn't  have an owner's  liability statute.... I guess I'm not sure how I can prove it's not there.  You can search for it but you definitely  won't find it.
Insurance,3d0kt0,northofindy,3,Mon Jul 13 20:59:40 2015 UTC,Your policyholder should pursue the vehicle policy. Almost always it is the primary policy that pays for damages first. The policy follows the car.

Insurance,3d0kt0,ferdiad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:21:32 2015 UTC,"That was the big question around the office because the state doesn't notify us of a suspension, so as long as they were paying the premium the coverage would be kept in force and I don't know if it's up to an individual insurer how soon they can drop someone for non-pay. I think the state (in this case PA) would allow for certain amount of time before an insurer is allowed to drop someone for non-pay."
Insurance,3d0kt0,britt5689,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:44:10 2015 UTC,That would not be a coverage issue but a limits issue. A very significant difference.

Insurance,3d0kt0,northofindy,0,Mon Jul 13 04:21:00 2015 UTC,"It depends on the state.  In many states only the person operating the vehicle can be held liable for the damage they cause, in others  there is owner's liability  which makes the vehicle owner and driver jointly liable.

You don't have a Hired/Non-Owned Auto exposure - you have a Contingent Auto exposure since you'll be hiring a bunch of different contractors.  You need to find someone that's an expert in trucking to help you place this coverage.  To cover your customer's items, you need either Contingent Cargo, assuming that your contractors are providing their own Cargo coverage or you need to provide Cargo coverage yourself.  If there's any storage of items, you'll need to provide Warehouseman's Legal  since the Cargo will only cover items when they're on the trailer.  As for covering your driver's vehicles, I don't think that you really want to do that.  Your drivers should stand on their own if they're providing their own coverage.  That said, you need to protect yourself (and just yourself - insurance generally is about protecting your own assets) by buying the Contingent Auto I mentioned along with an Umbrella policy - depending on how many owner/operators you're going to have, you need at least $1M and maybe as much as $10M - your insurance broker should be able to tell you more specifically what you'll need.  As far as individual policies, you might need Workers Comp in some states, depending on the specifics.  But your Auto and Umbrella should be good for every state."

So contingent liability would only step in if owner/operators policy was exhausted, right?    And, I don't think this is exactly what OP is talking about any longer.  It was mentioned that trucks and SUVs would be used."
Insurance,3d1h6h,emptydiner,2,Mon Jul 13 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, the contingent only pays when the owner's coverage is exhausted.  Generally speaking there's at least a $1M requirement, sometimes as high as $10M, depending.    The truck arrangement still means that Contingent will be the right coverage.  However, the SUV thing makes me wonder if Primary Auto will be required, just like Uber, Lyft and their competitors.  Personal vehicles would obviously exclude this, and at the very least the OP would have to provide individual primary auto limits for their contractors."
Insurance,3d1h6h,key2616,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:31:11 2015 UTC,Most likely these drivers would be from the local neighborhood helping locals within their area. They do not serve as full time movers so they would not have cargo insurance. Its more of a side gig for the drivers. Someone with a pick up truck who wants to make a few extra bucks. In that case would the Contingent Auto and Contingent Cargo suffice?
Insurance,3d1h6h,key2616,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:05:14 2015 UTC,"No, you would have to have Primary Auto and Primary Cargo since those folks can NOT be counted on to have the right coverage.  I think that you need to consult with a local insurance broker plus your attorney about the viability of this.  Local law is going to have a huge say in this."
Insurance,3d1h6h,emptydiner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"So all of your drivers have their own trucking liability policy and have their own workers compensation policy, correct?  Do they have a cargo policy also?  If that is the case, then I think you should be able to get a trucking liability for HNOA, Hired and Non-Owned Autos, or it's equivalent.  You can have one policy that covers you nationwide but I think it is important that you review your drivers insurance and make sure they are covered properly.  Their policy will be your first line of defense if there is a claim and it they aren't insured properly, you could be covering the entire bill.  Make sure you get your company listed as an Additional Insured on your drivers' policies.    You can get a cargo policy to cover your customers belongings and don't forget that their renters or homeowners policy also provides coverage for things like that as well.    If you are moving any really expensive stuff, then you need to make your agent aware of that.    Good luck!"

From the first phone call from a client to the last phone call.  Explain every step, even how you get your drivers/1099's to sign on with you.  When you mention trucks and SUV's, are you talking about pick-up trucks, or tractor-trailors?

I mean, honestly I think you'd likely be fine despite his warnings about the difficulties that would arise during a claim (all valid concerns).  But to be absolutely sure, I'd request a copy of this person's policy, call the insurer, tell them about your planned trip, and ask if you'd be covered.  They'll certainly call your gf's friend and that way before you've ever started your trip there's already a record with the insurance company that the car's owner has said, Yes, Joentje has my permission to drive my car all over god's green earth.  Have the insurer send their confirmation that they recognize that you're a permissive user in an email.    Also, I don't know if this has already been asked, but you're not planning to drive across the Mexican border are you?  A US policy probably won't provide coverage in Mexico, although Canada is usually fine.  Next concern.  Given that we're talking about a 40 day (??) road trip...I mean that's enough time for your gf's friend to decide to stop paying his insurance bill and for coverage to lapse.  So here's an innovative solution to compensate your gf's friend for borrowing their car!  Why don't you pay their insurance bill through the time that you'll be on the road with it?  It'll still be cheaper than renting a car (I assume you dropped the rental car idea because the cost of a 40 day rental is astronomical?)  I think that should cover you.  Remember when you get out into the real desolate desert areas - (1) start looking for gas stations when your tank is half empty, gas stations are like 100 miles apart out there (2) don't pass up any public restroom you see, the next one will probably be...in 100 miles (3) carry plenty of water in the car with you, some for yourself, some in case the engine overheats."
Insurance,3czzss,forneusFQ,2,Sun Jul 12 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"Communication is my main problem here, i only found out about this a couple of days ago, the friend i'll be going with is my main way of communicating with the guy borrowing us his car. As with many road trips you'll see the true nature of people, and my friend is a lazy asshole... His idea was to just let me rest every couple of hours so i don't cause any accidents, no insurance needed...   I will definitely call his insurance company, thank you! A writen confirmation is indeed best i think.  I already offered to pay to bring the car to a garage and have it checked out, as well as pay for the insurance. But my friend thinks this is too expensive and does not want to pay too much for that..  Thank you so much for the advice!"
Insurance,3czzss,Bettye_Wayne,2,Sun Jul 12 12:30:44 2015 UTC,"A couple things to add-  How long is this trip? If you'll be the primary operator for a feww weeks,  with some companies, you've crossed over the line of ""permissive use"" to ""regular operator"" and you may want to see about having the policy holder add you as a driver to their policy. Plus that way you can call and make sure the insurance stays active or request ID cards.  My company would never send a casual email advising you you're covered despite not being on a policy. And we wouldn't give you any info if you called, without the policy holder's permission I would tell you nothing. But each company is different.   I think you need to stop letting your lazy asshole friend be the middle man, tbh. You're asking the right questions and your concerns are very valid, I get the impression he's just like ""YEEEAH ROAD TRIP BITCHEZZZ!!!"""
Insurance,3czzss,forneusFQ,2,Sun Jul 12 13:08:14 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Good points and that's the other reason I recommended calling. The answer could be NO, no coverage for you."
Insurance,3czzss,Keith_Courage,2,Sun Jul 12 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"Additionally, some states allow a ""non-owner"" policy to be sold to extend liability for you to drive another person's vehicle. This could help in the event that a. The owner of the car lets the insurance lapse, or b. You cause so much damage that their policy limit is exceeded. I would ask a local agent if you can purchase this type of policy to add another level of protection.   Oh yea if you own a vehicle and have insurance, your own auto policy miiiiight be able to extend liability to you as a driver in the same way."
Insurance,3cyfx5,nofe,6,Sat Jul 11 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"If there is no police report and Avis takes care of it, then it most likely will not appear on your driving record or affect your premiums.  That's one of the selling points of the LDW, that your insurance carrier never needs to know if there's a simple accident with no police."
Insurance,3cyfx5,thegreasythumb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:15:36 2015 UTC,Yeah there was no police report. It was an accident in the hotel parking garage and I went straight to Avis after it happened.

Insurance,3cyfx5,adirabethzy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:30:02 2015 UTC,Well I was mostly wondering if it could appear on my driving record if the insurance companies ever looked into my driving records in the future (i.e. when my policy renews or if I shop around).

His company will cover the damage to the wall.  If they don't have collision coverage. 1.No any tow storage rental will be at the cost of your friend. 2.

His liability coverage will cover the damage to the wall.   He is at fault for hitting a stationary object. This based off what you advised only - went off the road and hit the wall.

Insurance,3cxu54,aprillian,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:41:24 2015 UTC,"1.Since his car is totaled, will his insurance company be cutting him a check for the value of his car? (indemnity?)   I just want to add on to this point, since SO MANY people post here not understanding it, yes they will cut a check for the actual value of the vehicle. If it still has an outstanding loan, it will be written to both him and the finance company most likely. The finance company gets first dibs until the balance of the loan is paid. Then he gets what is left, if any. They DO NOT pay off the loan, and then also issue the owner a check for the actual value of the vehicle. Many people who post here think that insurance pays off the loan, and pays in full for the price of a new car."
Insurance,3cx6yv,EndOfTheSquirrel,3,Sat Jul 11 15:56:23 2015 UTC,Are they writing you a check up front or reimbursing you? Do you need to send them receipts? Nothing you're suggesting seems unethical or in violation of the principle of indemnity to me.

Insurance,3cuds4,pbfryman,7,Fri Jul 10 21:46:20 2015 UTC,"This is correct. In addition, I also want to say that, op, you are putting your own coverages and rates on the line if she were to be involved in an accident. It's very nice of you to let her use the car you're not using, but you also need to report this driving arrangement situation to your insurance company right away. She is a regular, unrated, undisclosed driver on your policy."
Insurance,3cuds4,f1shbone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have full coverage as well as uninsured motorist. It's my understanding she would be covered on that grounds - am I incorrect here?  It sounds like I need to get the car removed from my policy? Or can it be insured ""twice""?  Thank you again!"
Insurance,3cuds4,f1shbone,2,Fri Jul 10 23:10:59 2015 UTC,"You are not incorrect, she is covered as a permissive user, as long as she was using the vehicle within the scope of your consent at the time of, god forbit, an accident. However, the bigger issue here is that you have to report her to the insurance as a regular driver, and see where that goes from there. As an insurance company, we want to know about all risk exposures that are on your policy. You are right, it would not make sense for the vehicle to be ""double-insured"", and for that reason policy cannot be bound by your friend because she does not have any ownership on that car. In other words you can't insure something you don't own. As far as removing coverage, only you can make that decision, just don't expose yourself to risk. If there won't be coverage on the car, don't drive it. If it's on the road, state laws say it has to at least have liability on it."
Insurance,3cuds4,Yamuddah,2,Fri Jul 10 23:20:48 2015 UTC,"I think some clarification might be in order. Brokers don't automatically get you lower rates. They often have access to more companies and thus can find you a better rate. Also, the whole concept of insurance is to generate risk based pricing."
Insurance,3cuds4,pbfryman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:20:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you, your feedback is appreciated. Do you have any suggestions on a broker? When you say ""max out the driving experience"" what exactly do you mean by that? She has a valid DL."

Insurance,3cu55l,Throwawayquestions_,9,Fri Jul 10 20:14:07 2015 UTC,"Current coverage status does not matter, what matters is what coverages you had at the time the accident took place. So they can still file it. Your policy was in force at the time of the accident and that is all that matters. Based on the facts of loss, it looks like you are at fault for rear-ending them. Do the right thing. Call your insurance company and let them know what happened. There is a liability exposure on your policy and they need to know about it. Failure to cooperate with them can and will affect you in the future on your license and the ability to get new insurance at reasonable rates. Aside from this, it's the right thing to do and per the terms of the auto policy coverage you took out, you have a duty to report it.    Later edit: looks like California statute of limitations for third party property damage is 3 years. So technically they have 3 years to pursue this claim. So you can roll the dice for 3 years, or do the right thing."
Insurance,3cu55l,f1shbone,4,Fri Jul 10 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"Wait, you rear ended them. You have the duty to maintain a proper distance as the following vehicle. If someone stops suddenly in front of you then you have the duty to stop in time. Them admitting fault is irrelevant, they probably don't understand the statutes. I would probably place you 100% at fault here. I don't see negligence on him. His sudden the stop doesn't seem unreasonable and putting negligence for a sudden stop is extremely difficult to do unless they literally say something like ""yeah I stopped in the middle of the road for no reason."""
Insurance,3cu55l,broseph23,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:40:54 2015 UTC,"You were covered at the time of the accident so coverage is not an issue, however, I hope you realize you were 100% at fault, not them.

Insurance,3cue2d,Grav3,2,Fri Jul 10 21:24:01 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look good, the literal first part of this section on workers compensation is below:  Section 4900. No claim for compensation, except as provided in Section 96, is assignable before payment, but this provision does not affect the survival thereof.  Which is exactly what you are attempting to do. You want to assign the payment rights to a third party for a lump sum. It looks by fiat this is not allowable. Her best bet would have been to accept a cash settlement of her claim instead of the structured settlement, at this point there is nothing to be done as neither the WC board nor the annuity issuer/owner will renegotiate the deal to contravene this statute.  Wish I had better news."
Insurance,3cue2d,Impudicity2001,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:52:15 2015 UTC,"I think I'm missing some information.  Did your mother accept a settlement which involved setting up an annuity but now she changed her mind and would prefer a lump sum payout?    If that's the case then she probably could get an annuity buyout since it's technically not a comp claim anymore.  From the information you provided I think the claim was settled with a ""compromise and release.""  This is California workers compensation lump sum settlement.  However, in this case an annuity was set up by the insurance company with that lump sum settlement.  There's no longer any insurance involvement.  If you do go through an annuity buyout just make sure you use a reputable company since some can be super shady.  If she still has an active claim and is receiving benefits from the insurance company, my answer will be different.  If I'm incorrect with my assumptions let me know and I'll update my suggestions."
Insurance,3cue2d,LASuperdome,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:42:40 2015 UTC,"That is correct, she has gone a year with the current arrangement, that involved setting up an annuity.  I can provide more information in PM, if you'd prefer."
Insurance,3cue2d,LASuperdome,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:48:40 2015 UTC,"Alright that makes more sense.  For all intents and purposes it's not a comp claim any longer; it's an annuity handled through a financial company. I recommend having your mother call the company and ask to ""surrender the annuity"" and see how much money she would receive.  If she does this there will be a penalty probably between 5-10% of the surrender.  But, it will be the cheapest way to get that done.   Edit: this may work depending on how the settlement was structured. It would be a good place to start regardless.   An annuity buyout company will take like 25% of the money so I'd recommend not going through one if you can help it.   Finally, make sure this is the right course of action.  Your mother will get significantly more money over her life with an annuity.  With a 24 year annuity I'm guessing your mother is ~61 years old.  That's still a lot of life.  If she has ongoing medical expenses it may be worth keeping that annuity.  That stuff is expensive - especially in California.  But - that's the end of my unsolicited advice.  If you want me to crunch some numbers regarding how much a buyout would be feel free PM me the annuity info."
Insurance,3cue2d,Impudicity2001,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:18:59 2015 UTC,"There are no surrenders of a structured settlement, it is a one time irrevocable arrangement generating from a settlement of a claim or dispute. It's irrevocable to protect the payee from adverse tax consequences.  The annuity buyout option won't work because of the CA law section I cited above, and was backed up by advice given in the original post in r/legaladvice.   Wish I had better news, but if you do call on behalf of your mother the annuity issuer will cite Section 130 of the IRC and say you cannot accelerate, modify, or assign the obligation."

That said, this is a question for your agent, who should check with the claims department of your insurance company. They are typically the best resource, trained on the auto policy language and coverage questions. You should definitely be good on liability, but on coverage for damages to the rental car itself, your son has to be a resident relative and you in the car, that way the rental qualifies as being in your custody at the time of the loss (you being in the car)."

If you repair the car and then submit for reimbursement, there is a good chance you will not get reimbursed for the entire amount. There are several considerations the insurance will need to consider. Is the damage being repaired ONLY the damage caused by this loss, because that's the only one that is owed. Are all brand new parts being used, because they are not necessarily owed. Are labor rates reasonable for the market area, because the most expensive rates are not owed. Etc.

Insurance,3csp70,ferdiad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"You can absolutely make a claim and my advice would be to call your insurance company and at the very least file a 'notification only' (which is telling them you had a collision but you do not intend to claim on your insurance for the cost of repairs). You also may have an obligation to pay any damage made to the sign. Your insurance company will ask you some questions about the damage to your vehicle and the garage that you left your car with. Normally you should get an estimate for the repairs before the mechanics work on it, that can be forwarded to your insurance company and they will decide whether the damage caused is from your collision, or pre-existing damage. Most insurance companies however will prefer that you send your vehicle to an approved repairer to keep costs down,  but you are perfectly within your rights to get it fixed elsewhere. My best advice is to call them regardless of your intent to claim, as they will be able to give you advice surrounding the finer details of your policy.

(2) For an insured, the policy covering the insured.  (3) For the occupants of an insured motor vehicle, the policy on that motor  vehicle.

Insurance,3cr69f,skipper14,3,Fri Jul 10 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"No you are not looking too much into it. It is common practice (with my carrier) to total out a vehicle that has been flooded to the point water has entered into the engine.  You need to get more opinions from more body shops, I'd go to two more. If both agree the car should be totaled then you need to argue with the adjuster, don't just take his decision. If he is firm, even though all body shops agree it is a total loss, then you need to consult a public adjuster and have them help you with this.  Hiring a public adjuster is a pain in the ass for both you and Geico, but it is your best bet."
Insurance,3cr69f,UnSeenBabyGravy,2,Fri Jul 10 04:03:57 2015 UTC,Take it to other body shops and see what they professionally say. Along the lines of how much damage the water did and if the car should be totaled is best left to professionals to decide. I think you are right and it would be horrible to have things come up later down the line and insurance not cover it.  I don't know the details of insurance but you should push as hard as you can to get as much as your car fixed or replaced. Once further body shop's opinions are received and recorded in some way talk to your insurance company or adjuster and tell them what you want and how you are right (with the professionals info backing up your claims).  Best of luck mate!

If they have a valid policy but aren't accepting liability because their insured is presenting a different story then rear end then this is word v word. Unfortunately you may end up having to pay out of pocket for your repairs but should you start repairs and they find additional damages that make the total bill go over your deductible, your insurance can cover the rest and then they have a financial interest in the loss and will pursue the other company for funds including your dedt."
Insurance,3cqu6d,ferdiad,3,Fri Jul 10 02:46:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because your damages are below the deductible your insurance company can't do anything. What you could probably do is pay out of pocket for repairs and rental plus any additonal damage might out you over your deductible. Even if they pay out one dollar they then have a financial interest in getting your money back.   The only other recourse is small claims court."

Your initial estimate is around $900, there will be a supplement. That should take the damages over your $1000 deductible. Once they've issued payment they will subrogate to Infinity and arbitrate i necessary. You will be out your deductible but there is a chance you will  recover it once the arbitration is done. This can take 3-6 months.   Or you can pay for the damages out of pocket and sue the other party in civil court. If the judge finds in your favor Infinity will pay the judgement."

I know in my state, all my estimates are written under the penalties of perjury and I would assume it's the same elsewhere.  Was he doing it to do you a favor because you don't want it totaled?  Or are you ok with it being a total loss?  Edit: Was the person who wrote the estimate from the body shop or the insurance company?  After reading your question again, it seems as if maybe they are anticipating finding more damage that will put it over the threshold of totaling it once they take it apart."

It was an adjuster from an insurance company (a top 3 insurance company)"
Insurance,3cql95,northofindy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:42:33 2015 UTC,Many times in a an accident there is hidden damage that cannot  be seen until the body shop begins the tear down process. I know estimators  will some times write for the damage they can see then tell the shop we will pay them x number of hours  to start  the teardown then write a final estimate  that includes any damage that was previously  hidden to have the most accurate  estimate possible when deciding  if it is a total.  I hope that is what the estimator is doing here and although he is pretty sure there is hidden damage he is not going to write for it until they do the tear down and he can actually see it.    However if he is keeping $1500 of damage that he can actually  see off the estimate that raises a lot  of red flags.

I can't speak for all insurance providers, but the company I work for does not view comprehensive claims as rated claims (so these claims will not be taken into account when factoring your new six month premium.)

It may very well be possible that while they don't have new procedures in place for same-sex spouses being added, they plan on having it done and available by the time enrollment comes around.  You may not qualify for a mid-year addition because you really haven't had a new ""life event"" (birth, marriage, etc) since you were already married.  That's all just speculation, I'm just trying to throw out possible scenarios of what they are dealing with on their side of the benefits processing.  It's possible that they are currently trying to figure out whether they can allow same-sex spouses to be added immediately, or if they need to wait for the yearly enrollment period.  This is a decision that may not happen quickly, as this may involve a negotiation/discussion with the benefit/health insurance company, who has the ultimate say and legal wording probably needs to be amended in the service contract between the employer and the health insurance company.  Your husbands employer may not be able to start allowing it immediately, even if they want to, they can't change their benefits contract at will."
Insurance,3cohtc,joeboo5150,4,Thu Jul 9 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"Husband called his insurance provider, they said it qualifies as a mid-year event and should be filed/processed like a new marriage. They seemed confused as to why the employer was having difficulty.   It's possible that they are currently trying to figure out whether they can allow same-sex spouses to be added immediately, or if they need to wait for the yearly enrollment period.   This sounds like what they're saying, but the insurance company says I should be able to be added now. At least it's fine on their end. It seems like the employer is the one gumming things up."
Insurance,3cohtc,britt5689,7,Thu Jul 9 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"This may be a bit off topic but here's my two cents. I am an insurance agent in Ohio and this state is so ass backwards that even though same sex marriage is now legal, I still can't add a same sex spouse to an insurance policy. When the first named insured is a male, and I click on the button that says ""add spouse"" the only option is to add a female. So I do know that the software systems used to service insurance policies are going to need a major overhaul. And the other answerer is correct as well, you may just have to wait for the yearly open enrollment period since technically you have been married, and it isn't a new marriage."

Thankfully, Ctrl-F12 approximates that, since keyboards haven't had that 2nd row of F-keys in about 25 years now, lol.  Our computer system is so piecemeal, and so old, its ridiculous.

I know it's been a long time coming for equal rights, but just be patient (and persistent) while the big slow insurance system gets with the times.  edit: ok I lied, UHC actually sent that email out at 6:22 PM EST yesterday 7/8/15."

Is it going to be more for M/M because of a higher rate of heart disease?  I'm sure these are a lot of questions to be answered that haven't been fixed yet.  Not to mention the computer systems being updated.  The insurance industry usually takes YEARS to make changes, I'm not surprised that they're not able to do something that seems so simple after only a couple of weeks.

I'm confused as to why being left off your parents policy is getting you branded as a 'new driver'.  Isn't the time you've been a licensed driver easily verifiable via running an MVR on your driver's licence number, which any automobile insurance company should have the capability to obtain with relative ease?    The time you've been licensed shouldn't really be up for debate.  It should be a matter of record & said record would be with the DMV.  What am I missing here?  EDIT:  Wait, I thought about it for another second & realized that the problem is they can't establish your claims history with an MVR, as any claim that doesn't involve an accident reported to policy and/or a ticket wouldn't generate any record on an MVR].  So, it's not that they actually believe you're a new driver [probably].  They just have to use their new driver rating approach because their established methodology for experienced drivers is likely built on a formula that requires the entry of claims history for the period the person has been licensed.    Hmm, that's a tough one.  No obvious answer comes to mind."

If they only get car 2s statement and she says yeah car 3 rear ended me and pushed me into car 1, they may pursue you for 100% (or a majority depending on the distance car 2 claims she had) of car 1 damages as well because they don't have your statement that car 2 hit car 1 before car 3 hit car 2 that was already impacted into car 1. If your hitting car 2 caused more damage to car 1 then the first impact , they could hold you liable for a portion. It's your choice who you talk to. If you talked to your own insurance and they have your full statement, they can relay info to other companies but providing your statement to the other companies is just a part of their investigation process."

OP's word taht car 2 hit car 1 before he/she hit car 2 is just that... OP's word. That means nothing to car 2's insurance. Really, car 1 is the key to this. Car 1 is the only one who has NO REASON to lie. Car 1 is the one who can say the sequence of events without bias or motivation. Unfortunately in this situation, it sounds like car 1 was parked/unoccupied. So... it's word vs. word."
Insurance,3coz21,Arishem5102,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:38:20 2015 UTC,"You have no obligation to speak to the other insurance companies & so long as you have reported it to your own company, all inquiries from the carriers for car 1 & 2 should be directed to your company's claims department.  Dealing with the other car's insurance companies is party of the service you're paying your insurance company for.  In terms of fault, the events you describe would point to you sharing the liability for car 1's damage with car 2, but 100% liable for car 3's rear damage.  With this kind of accident, there is a chance the driver of car 2 will attempt to claim that they stopped short of car 1 & you rear-ended them was what pushed them into car 1, which is a sequence of events that would make you 100% liable for everyone's damages.   If the driver of car 2 goes that route, the most important person is the driver of that 1st car & their account of how many impacts they felt (1 vs 2)"

Insurance,3cormw,belletryst,7,Thu Jul 9 15:46:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I actually do have an opinion since I've been involved in bike stuff for a long time, albeit not from your perspective.    If you have health insurance, this is a waste of money.  There are competing products that offer a lot more than just this AD&D benefit, and you're paying a lot for for not very much coverage.  As comparison, a similar benefit for a fencer (as in the Olympic sport, not someone who puts fences up) would cost under $100/year.  If you're a professional it might make sense, but it's a poor investment for the casual rider.    If you're looking for something to cover your real exposures as a rider, you want something more along the lines of Spoke Bicycle Insurance .  That will cover your bike if it's stolen or damaged, your liability if you hit someone as well as a broader form of the AD&D (medical payments coverage) plus a lot of other things (the roadside assistance one is pretty sweet).  Full disclosure: I know all of the players at SPOKE very well and speak to all of them on a regular basis.  I've consulted on the project but have never been compensated by any of those folks."

Insurance,3cormw,LASuperdome,3,Thu Jul 9 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"Everyone I know in this space aspires to ""slick branded insurance being advertised on social media"".  It is literally the Holy Grail for this kind of stuff.  And there's nothing wrong with that since it is exactly the same for lots of other online businesses completely unrelated to insurance.  Let's differentiate something - the insurance company exists separately from this product.  Yes, they're the insurer, but they do lots of other stuff and provide real value to their insureds.  So as far as US Fire goes, I really have nothing bad to say about them.  However, this specific program exists separately, and my criticisms above are directly solely at that and should not considered to be reflective of my opinion of US Fire as a whole.    But this is a bad deal.  The $200 charge for this limit is definitely on the high side and there are people that will charge you effectively the same and give you more coverage.  There are a number of programs that compete with my friends at SPOKE, and they all do things a little differently, but they are all - as a unit, SPOKE included - a better value than this deal in my opinion.   To put this another way, I would not want my name professionally associated with this product.  It is a loser deal that is not built for the long-term."
Insurance,3cormw,velosurance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:20:43 2015 UTC,"I might be completely wrong (please someone correct me if I am) but I think homeowners or renters insurance would cover the medical if you were in a bike accident up to the medpay amount (usually around $5k).  So I think this insurance would act as a supplement.    If you had damage to your bike it would have to be over $100 for you to even use insurance.  I would think the only time that would save you money is if you somehow bent your carbon fiber frame.  So maybe if you had a $2k+ bike it could be useful.  Personally, the only insurance I would consider for a bike under $2k would be liability insurance, which this policy doesn't offer."

Insurance,3co67d,f1shbone,2,Thu Jul 9 19:19:22 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking your deductible is used for Collision and Comprehensive claims made by you against your vehicle. So, if part of the claim involved damage to your vehicle, your insurance company would deduct the amount of your deductible when they write you a check for your repairs. The other party's damage would fall under your Liability coverage which isn't subject to any deductible. So, no, you won't be paying anything out of pocket towards a liability claim, unless the driver sues you for any reason (in which case contact your insurer)."

Insurance,3cq1wh,emptydiner,-1,Thu Jul 9 21:30:44 2015 UTC,I moved into an apartment with an existing tenant. The lease was up for renewal and upon signing the agreement I was informed that I needed to purchase renters insurance.  I purchased insurance from Geico. The apartment then floods and I think my computer may have been damaged. I filed a claim with them and they denied me because they don't cover flood-related claims.  I then shop around for an insurer who does offer flood-related coverage due to rain. I chose Liberty Mutual because the saleswomen said after I gave her specifics to my situation that the policy I was going to purchase from LM covered me.   The first thing an adjuster says to me is that LM doesn't cover this type of flooding when I filed a claim.  This is my first time dealing with a situation like this and the first time I have filed a claim to an insurance agency. What am I suppose to think when someone lies to me about the extent of their coverage?

Insurance,3cq1wh,emptydiner,2,Fri Jul 10 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"100% right, generally the only option for flood due to rain or rising water is a flood policy and that is federally regulated through fema. No homeowners/renters policy would cover this."
Insurance,3cq1wh,dew22,3,Sat Jul 11 08:03:23 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's pretty serious shit.  Have you tried calling FEMA?  Call them, they are the government and they have tons of money to throw around in situations like this.    Is there any chance you have something in writing from the agent stating that the policy would cover floods?  If so, they are on the hook for it.    Generally speaking, I don't think there is a standard homeowners/renters company that includes flood with a regular renters policy, at least not in Florida and what happened in your situation is truly a flood and would be covered by a flood policy.    I think chances are pretty good that your phone to LM call was recorded so call back and speak to a manager.  Ask for someone to review the recording and let them know you are seeking legal advice  if they cannot help.  If the person lied to you, which I'm going to guess that they didn't lie as much as they didn't know what they were talking about, then you have a right to pursue action against the company.    Did you purchase the policy directly through LM or did you call a local independent agent?"

The type of flood you're talking about will not be covered and will be stated as an exclusion in you contract with LM. If the agent at the time thought you meant flooding from say sewer back up, they may have added an endorsement to the policy for that and that could be the confusion, however they should have clarified that at the time of purchase. Flood due to weather would only be covered by a flood policy, which as others have mentioned, you would get through fema or a company that has funds from FEMA, unfortunately this means you have to be in a flood zone to purchase it.  I am licensed in in several states and this is the case in each of those states, I am not licensed in KY so I maybe wrong here"

Insurance,3cq1wh,key2616,7,Fri Jul 10 02:36:06 2015 UTC,Sounds like you don't know how insurance works. Generally renters insurance doesn't cover flooding from ground water which from all the storms in that area recently sounds like what happened. It would cover if a pipe broke and flooded the apartment. Also your moldy apartment is your landlord's responsibility. If it is unlivable they should put you in alternate housing which should also be covered by the landlord's policy. So before you bad mouth a company maybe you should understand the basics of insurance.
Insurance,3cq1wh,skipper14,-3,Thu Jul 9 21:36:23 2015 UTC,"Your right about the apartment being the landlords responsibility.   I don't understand Insurance law or policies. It seems that your expectation is that I should. Regardless if you are right or wrong the saleswomen did lie to me about the coverage. I asked her specifically if my situation was covered prior to the purchase. Why would I want to waste my time and pay someone for something that isn't covered?   They lie, it's that simple."
Insurance,3cq1wh,key2616,5,Thu Jul 9 21:50:29 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately for you (not trying to sound condescending here) the ultimate responsibility to read the policy is on you, not the agent. If they outright lie to you that is one thing, but if they don't elaborate and tell you every single thing that the policy covers, then it falls back on you for failing to read the policy.  If you read the policy there will be a specific exclusion for ground water flooding, all policies have them. Pull it out now and read it, it will be there."
Insurance,3cq1wh,skipper14,3,Fri Jul 10 04:10:29 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you, it's only up to a point.  When a consumer seems to do everything right up front - ask specific questions, request a copy of the policy documents - and is then surprised by an uncovered claim, something is very wrong.  We clearly only have the OP's side of the story, and we'll likely never have the other, but there are some very big red flags here, at least for me.  Now I work in a completely different industry segment, and perhaps this is standard operating procedure in Personal Lines, but we have fired two people for doing exactly this kind of stuff.    Telling the OP (or any other buyer) to read the policy if fine and dandy (and in general the right answer), but when he asked for a copy prior to binding and was denied, I find it very, very difficult not to side with him against the agent."
Insurance,3cq1wh,bundeywundey,3,Fri Jul 10 12:19:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't see anywhere where he said he was denied copy of the policy. You're right, that is a big red flag. Consumers should always be able to get a copy beforehand."

Insurance,3cq1wh,mrm1776,4,Fri Jul 10 16:28:34 2015 UTC,Do you need to be an expert in insurance? No. Should you understand basic policy language and read through the policy before signing anything so that you understand what is actually covered? Yes.   If you simply read through the policy you could have confirmed coverages and bought the appropriate coverage. But then again I'm biased as I have had to deal with too many people that don't understand insurance and complain when something isn't covered.
Insurance,3cq1wh,superhubris,0,Thu Jul 9 22:14:46 2015 UTC,I did ask if I could see the policy prior to purchase and I was told that they can't share that information with me which is what prompted me to get very specific when it came to the type of coverage I was seeking.  Had she not lied and just said that they don't offer coverage for this type of flooding I may have learned through my research that no one does. Then it would have been a simple matter of finding the cheapest coverage possible. Because she chose not to do that I am in this current situation.

One year we had an auditor walk in, look around the office for about 5 minutes, leave, and we got our certification.  Other times they might stick around for an hour and actually look through a few random files or something.  Regardless, it's basically just an ""award"" that is bought and paid for, it has no real meaning or significance of any kind.  They would mail out customer satisfaction surveys to our clients and tally the results for us, but that was about the only somewhat useful service they provided.  But even that was fairly worthless, because customers either basically give you a 10/10 if they are happy with you, or a 0/10 if they are pissed, there's no real thought put into any of the survey rankings, and we could even remove customers of our choosing from the survey mailing list(customers that we knew were recently upset over some matter or another and we knew they'd probably give us bad scores)  All in all, a waste of everybody's time and my company's money"
Insurance,3cmdbx,key2616,2,Thu Jul 9 04:18:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about the certifications, particularly at the agent level.  I disagree about their surveys. For insurance carriers with a large number of customers in each region, they provide good, directional information that's better than any other competitive analysis that I'm aware of."
Insurance,3cmdbx,britt5689,2,Thu Jul 9 04:28:28 2015 UTC,"Well the biggest thing to consider is coverage, bbut all things being equal with coverage no 2 companies are the same. It's all about your experience dealing with them in alot of cases. People will have a claim and great experience ands stick with that company for years. But opposite can be said they have bad experience and nevr go back. This is really a personal experience kind of thing.  As for the rate you are getting, are those online quotes or have you spoke directlyto an agent? Sometimes once they underwrite the file it can changes things alot so btake quotes as that quotes. They are giving a rate based off a quick look at your info but they can miss something that can have a big impact."
Insurance,3cmdbx,Killboy_Powerhead,3,Thu Jul 9 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"I assumed an agent wasn't anything other than a sales man for the most part. I find it hard to believe that any large company would give the guy on the front line much leeway in the price. Or that they do much more investigation other than a credit check(800-810 in my case), accident report(none, ever) Police records(Right turn on red about 8 years ago, and a camera around 5 years ago)  I guess I will find out when I try to sign up with another company, but what else could I be missing?"
Insurance,3cmdbx,KindaOlderWhiteGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:08:41 2015 UTC,Online apps and quotes are pretty blunt tools. They might discounts that you qualify for or miss coverages that are important in your state. I would talk to an agent.
Insurance,3cmdbx,Sternreisender,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:21:01 2015 UTC,"I assumed an agent wasn't anything other than a sales man for the most part.   Some are.  Personally I refer to those as ""bad agents"", and since my client pool is insurance agents, I avoid that type.  You want to find someone who knows their various carriers and what they want to see.  Based on what details you posted, I'm willing to bet that a good agent with a decent stable of companies will have several that he thinks will fit you very well.  Additionally, the agent should be able to find ways to increase your coverage and save you money - one of the main differentiations between a ""bad"" agent and a ""good"" one is that a good one realizes that by doing a good job for you, you'll recommend him to your friends.  You by yourself will never make or break his year, but you could represent a lot of other business opportunities, so he needs to help you as best he's able."
Insurance,3cmdbx,PeerCoverNZ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:42:04 2015 UTC,"Try calling an independent local agent. Also, if you're doing online quoting their not running an MVR, CLUE, or credit score, so they're not entirely accurate, that's why it's important to call a real live agent that is a professional at quoting and issuing insurance. As long as you stick with one of the big name companies, you shouldn't have any major issues if you have to file a claim."
Insurance,3cmdbx,tuftackle16,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:06:57 2015 UTC,"Have you tried to requote with Progressive?  That way you can still keep your accident forgiveness but get the new rates.  Sometimes having a policy for that long is beneficial, but in my state that policy would've started before insurance companies were able to credit score.  If your credit is good, your new policy will be considerably cheaper.  I would call your agent and get them to do a Progressive requote first before you decide to switch companies.    In my opinion, Progressive's claim service is the best in the business.  They want to handle claims quickly and concisely so they don't have to spend money dragging claims out for a month like other carriers do."

Insurance,3cnc2i,broseph23,2,Thu Jul 9 13:33:58 2015 UTC,"If the claim has already been reported to your insurance, they are no longer in a position to delete it, at best they will just close it with no further handling if it comes to that. Claim can't be destroyed because there's been a liability exposure identified. You could offer to the other insurance to pay for it out of pocket. Whether or not they accept, that is up to them, and you can't force the issue. Also keep in mind that there is a duty owed to your mother's insurance to report this claim, per the terms of the insurance policy."
Insurance,3cnc2i,f1shbone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"Well, it's already been reported so there's nothing you can do.

Insurance,3cm6ck,sfryder08,3,Thu Jul 9 00:05:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately most, if not all, policies exclude coverage for improper installation and/or mechanical breakdown. Most renters policies also require that you have a covered loss (something they'd pay for) before they allow you loss of use/additional living expense. Do you have your policy handy? Are you named peril or all risk? What does it say under ALE/loss of use? I would certainly get out of Dodge to be safe, but be aware it's questionable if they're reimburse you.  Edit: Don't call your agent - call the 800# for new claims. They should have a 24-hour reporting center. Ask that they page the adjuster on call."
Insurance,3cm6ck,izznt,2,Thu Jul 9 01:25:42 2015 UTC,"There's no loss here, so you can't use that loss of use coverage. HOWEVER, since your land lord is responsible for mainlining the safety of your building, and ensuring you have hot/cold running water, and heat/ac when applicable, he is responsible for putting you up in a hotel, not your insurance."

The water heater wasnt properly installed which is a workmanship issue which is excluded under the policy. Unless it's triggered by a covered loss or you are ordered out of the epremises for evacuation or something ordered by authority such as fire department police.   That being said I think there would definitely be the chance to get the money bacck by suing the party responsible for the install. And even you landlord."

If you do still live at home, you can title the car and registration in your name, and still list it on your parent's policy since you are also listed as a driver on the policy. If you don't live at home, and you title it in your dad's name, you can still have your own policy but he needs to be listed as the registered owner of the vehicle, while you're the primary operator. At your age, you should probably just get your own policy anyway."

Also she could be sued if the bike was bought under her name and you got in an accident.  My advice: buy insurance.  It may not be mandated but if you accidentally hit someone and cause injury they are going to sue you for hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars (this is not an exaggeration).

Insurance,3clcc4,monseeve,2,Wed Jul 8 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Correct, and here is why, for everyone reading. If it did not matter, you as an insured would not care who you gave the keys to.

Coverage is almost always better for named insured's  and their resident  family members than non related people who are listed on the policy.  For example if she is a named insured she would likely be covered while driving someone else's  car (or a rental), however if she was just a listed driver she may not be covered."

If yes, when was your last use. Depending on the company, they will either rate you for previous use in the last however many years, or rate you non tobacco depending on the level of cotinine in your system. There are companies that rate less severe on certain types of smokers or users that are quiting or use it for religious/very rare occasions. I would ask a local independent agent about which companies can offer the best program for your fit.

Insurance,3cj1v2,dan_232,6,Wed Jul 8 13:41:45 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with UK insurance laws but in the US they cannot rate based on your location any lower than your postal code. That means that they have to take your entire postal code into account rather than your specific neighborhood or street.

Insurance,3cimrx,throwthisaway8585,9,Wed Jul 8 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"There are lots of reasons that your rates have gone up that much but the most likely ones are that you live in a loss-prone area or your insurance company is trying to exit your market.  I rarely say this, but I think that you're definitely paying too much.  If you have an agent, I'd call them to discuss what's going on.  If you don't, the call center likely won't be able to tell you much.  Unless the company has made some kind of mistake (possible, but not likely), your only real hope is to find a new carrier to stop the bleeding.  Additionally, you should review your mail to see if your insurance company sent you a notice that your premium was increasing for the last few years.  They're required to do that by law."

Insurance,3cimrx,superhubris,3,Thu Jul 9 18:03:14 2015 UTC,"First of all, your homes market value has little to do with how much it's covered for. It's likely covered for full replacement cost. But if you're only covered in the range of 80K, 2378 is an insane premium with no claims history. Have their recently been a lot of wind storms/tornados in your area? If so, that's the culprit. It definitely won't hurt to call around and get better quotes. As an agent, I love a customer that's in escrow because their mortgage company sends a check directly to the insurance company every year and I don't have to make 20 follow up calls reminding somebody to make their payment. It also gives you the pay in full discount. Try calling an agent that will be willing to bundle your house and auto together and the discounts will definitely rack up in your favor."

Insurance,3cimrx,key2616,2,Wed Jul 8 12:47:31 2015 UTC,"At first I would've thought you were in Georgia, our insurance rates have followed a similar pattern over the last 6 years.  There are multiple reasons for this but the main one being that our companies (all of them) were operating at over 100% loss ratio because of claims, some at over 125%.    What this means is that for every dollar they took in from insurance premiums, they were paying a dollar to $1.25 in claims.  70-80% is the break even point and most insurance companies try to be around 60-70%.    The only way to adjust this ratio is to either raise price, leave the state, or quit paying claims.  Typically companies try to raise the rates first, and some end up leaving the state completely if the losses are too high.  Missouri has had some pretty major storms and flooding the past few years, so I'd wager the claims have been high and that's why you're seeing an increase.   That being said, $2400 on an $80,000 house seems excessive, almost like Florida expensive.  I'd shop around, maybe call a local independent agent who can try looking at several different companies at once.  You can also call the captives and they can quote you as well."

(its a score used by insurance carriers based mostly on credit and a few other factors). If your IBS hasn't changed much over the past 6 years and you haven't filed any claims- then it is simply rate increases with your insurance company- which I find shocking that Missouri department of insurance would approve an annual rate increase of 25%.

As an adjuster, I would think that most of the documentation of loss would be done by the adjuster you met with. I would allow them to take detailed pictures and do their estimate, then start cleaning up the mess. While doing to make sure you take detailed notes about all the damaged items (with pictures!!!), and look for any receipts or proofs of purchase to show when you bought and what you paid.  Without seeing your policy it would be hard for me to tell you what is covered. My company in my state would likely cover the damaged personal items, but the damage to the house is trickier. Most of the time damaged wood and structures not covered - or if they are there are specific instances. Make sure you get a copy of your policy if you do not have one and go through it line by line with your agent. Its better to know upfront that something won't be covered than to hear from your adjuster after weeks of waiting.  Good luck, and please let us know how it goes."

They can get the water out and dry out some of your personal items that can't be replaced (like pictures) so you don't have to toss them.

I tried to explain to her that sometimes when you file a claim, and need repairs to your house that you might have to do a LITTLE work, like putting dishes in a box and moving them to a different room. She was not happy to hear that. If I were here I'd be THRILLED. She's getting 13 grand to replace insulation, and about 20 square feet of drywall. She also complained because she got 2600 in additional living expenses to stay in a hotel or whatever while the work is being completed and complained to me that she lives 30 miles from the nearest hotel and that is SUPER inconvenient for her.

That means that you need to do your homework to see what the reasonable difference between your SUV at the same mileage is worth both with and without the accident after everything has been fixed.  That number will likely be significantly below $1,000 unless I've completely guessed wrong about the value of your SUV pre-impact.

You weren't in the car during the time of the accident so you don't have any injuries. If you were injured and could not work then you would have a loss of use case. The idea of insurance is indemnity (too make you whole as before your loss).
Insurance,3chhh1,powdertoastman420,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:22:20 2015 UTC,I see what you mean. It was actually the adjuster from my own insurance who advised that I old make a loss of use claim against the at fault party's insurance. The loss of use is from my loss of use of my vehicle. I've been advised the same from the body shop owner and a paralegal as well.
Insurance,3chhh1,crazyem814,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:28:26 2015 UTC,"Again, what are you claiming for loss of use? Your vehicle is being repaired and the insurance company is offering you a rental."
Insurance,3chhh1,piratefan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"The inability to use and enjoy my own vehicle that I'm still paying off and paying insurance. Partially because I can and I feel I need to seek as much as possible so I get something to cover the loss I'll take selling the car (which I was about to do when it got hit). I'm told I can be compensated a daily amount equal to the cost to rent a similar car, so I'll seek that for the loss of use claim. What's you perspective on something that would qualify as loss of use?"
Insurance,3chhh1,gunjr,3,Wed Jul 8 02:02:41 2015 UTC,That is exactly what loss of use is. The loss of the ability to use your car. You are correct that you are owed that. Either in a cash payment or in use of a rental car at no charge to you.
Insurance,3chhh1,piratefan,3,Wed Jul 8 02:27:09 2015 UTC,"You are being indemnified by your company through the use of a rental, therefore mitigating your loss of use. In the states where I have handled claims, you would not have a loss of use claim because you are being given the use of another vehicle."
Insurance,3chhh1,piratefan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:30:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have submitted the claim through your carrier. Since this is the case, you will most likely not be able to submit a first party diminished value claim with your carrier. According to what you said, you are exhausting the PD limit on the other parties policy so you would have to take him to small claims court for your diminished value loss. You are also asking for loss of use coverage. Was your vehicle used for business? If not, are you being reimbursed for a rental car?"
Insurance,3chhh1,piratefan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's right. I'm going through my insurance for the repairs and they will subrogate. And you're right about not being able to claim DV against my own policy. I'll claim it against his. Basically my thought was to 'beat' my insurance to his policy funds...  Get the DV and Loss of use claims paid before my insurance gets subrogation. I was not in the car at the time and it's primarily a personal vehicle. My ins offered a rental but I declined. I have another vehicle to drive. They advised I can change my mind at any time."
Insurance,3chzod,Mrg13,3,Wed Jul 8 01:37:37 2015 UTC,"OP, here is why the other posters are talking about the driver(s) in front of you feeling more than one impact. That would indicate you rear-ended them first, then you were rear-ended yourself and pushed into them again. IF that is the case, you bear a portion of the negligence. If everyone is in agreement they felt one impact only, you have no negligence."
Insurance,3chzod,f1shbone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:11:19 2015 UTC,Good to know. The driver who caused it admitted his brakes were bad right away (pretty sure he even to the Police too.)   I don't know what the lady who I got pushed into will say as she was the on take  away.
Insurance,3chzod,f1shbone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"When people say that, they typically want to absolve themselves of liability. ""I did what I was supposed to! I hit the brakes, but they malfunctioned"". They still have a legal duty to maintain their vehicle in a safe operating condition, so they're still at fault for the loss."
Insurance,3chzod,f1shbone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:25:53 2015 UTC,He said it in a way that seemed like an admission that he caused the 4 car crash.   'I knew my brakes were bad and I saw some fluid leaking yesterday' is pretty much what he said right away.
Insurance,3chzod,f1shbone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:57:16 2015 UTC,"Well, typically the rear car doesn't know whether or not the cars up ahead made contact or not prior to them striking the car immediately in front. The fact is the rear car did rear-end you and push you forward, now the other drivers will confirm single impact felt, and the claim will follow it's natural course."

Insurance,3chzod,key2616,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"Hey wondering if you could answer another question?  I only have liability on my car, will my insurance still deal with the guy who hit me or should I call them myself?   I've heard from my adjuster and one other of the other 3 cars involved. The other agent told me the guy admitted fault for the whole thing pretty much, so I think I'm in the clear with the car I got pushed into."
Insurance,3chzod,broseph23,2,Thu Jul 9 19:12:06 2015 UTC,"If you have liability only, the only extent your insurance company will get involved is to rule out the possibility of you being at fault. Once that has been established, they cannot assist you any further because you do not carry the necessary coverage (collision). You will have to pursue the insurance company representing the driver that caused the whole accident."
Insurance,3cgakw,stuart750,3,Tue Jul 7 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"If it's a broken oil pan, gasket, line, or filter, that won't even meet the deductible, so you'll have to pay for it out of pocket. A deductible only applies when the damages exceed the deductible."
Insurance,3cgakw,britt5689,2,Tue Jul 7 19:14:31 2015 UTC,"Even if you had insurance in Canada, it does not extend abroad, so don't feel like you've missed out on an opportunity. As far as what is covered and what you owe, the best thing would be to go back to the rental agreement and take another look at what you paid for. If it involves some sort of accident coverage, then take a look at the terms and speak to a representative from a regional office with the rental agency."
Insurance,3cg879,DownvoteFueled,2,Tue Jul 7 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know what kind of vehicle you have or what company you are insured with or where the estimates came from (shop vs appraiser) but I can tell you this.. often insurance companies have preferred shops to work with and common benefits of using the preferred shops are lower labor rates and better parts. Sometimes the repair time is shorter as well. Lower labor rates is self explanatory. What I mean by better parts is that some companies will use OEM parts on a vehicle that would only get after market parts if repaired as a third party vehicle. Shorter repair time doesn't mean the shop will do the required repairs faster but because they're preferred, the company has more pull with them so the shop doesn't dick around for 3 weeks on a 3 day repair. The difference in the estimates depends on who did them. The lower one is probably just visual and they will write a supplement after the tear down as you mentioned. The higher one may include the likely hidden damage that they expect to come up in the tear down though this is unusual to include on the first one. Most likely, labor rates and part prices is the reason for differences in cost.   As far as the rental is concerned. If you go through your insurance you'll pay for your rental out of pocket and submit your receipt and invoice to the other company for review and reimbursement. Call them ahead of time for the amt per day that they will cover and rent within that limit. Most companies do not pay for gas mileage or additional insurance fees so know that you will likely not be reimbursed for those kind of charges. If you keep the rental for your repair time only, they will reimburse you for it. If they've accepted liability, they can't deny rental coverage as they owe for it but just make sure you listen to what they say will cover so there's no surprises. If they can't provide this in written form as you would like, tell them to email you the rental guidelines and instructions for reimbursement so that you'll have it in a form of writing to go off of and refer to."
Insurance,3cg879,aprillian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"This is correct, but I wanted to supplement with information in regards to OEM vs non-OEM. The automatic, reactive assumption is made that OEM parts are inherently superior, which is not true. The auto insurance industry as a standard makes it a goal to only use CAPA and NSF certified non-OEM parts, and this means that they have to meet or exceed OEM standards. In addition, the vast majority of OEM parts are not manufactured by the vehicle manufacturer. They sublet the work to other companies, which put a stamp on the part and they sell it at mark-up through the dealer repair network. So, OEM vs non-OEM should only give someone pause if the OEM part source is questionable. There are actually many instances where aftermarket parts are actually superior to OEM parts, when it comes to mechanical components."
Insurance,3cg879,f1shbone,0,Thu Jul 9 16:14:04 2015 UTC,"Also realize if you go through your insurer, you pay your deductible AND you have a collision claim on your record for 5 years, meaning increased premiums for 5 years. It could also take months, or even over a year to get that deductible back from the other insurance company. If the other person has a reputable insurance company (progressive, allstate, etc) then by all means go with their insurance. You are not at fault and shouldn't have to be out of 500$ for who knows how long because of this accident."
Insurance,3cg879,britt5689,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:19:48 2015 UTC,What is the basis for stating with absolute confidence that the premiums will go up on the merit of simply filing a claim which in this case is not at fault?
Insurance,3cg879,f1shbone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"Any time you file a claim you lose your claims free discount which equals higher rates. They won't necessarily surcharge you for the claim, but you will lose a discount."

I work for one of the largest insurance carrier and the accident free discount does NOT go away unless you are found to be at fault. They are smart enough to realize that people can't control what other people do, therefore they should not lose a benefit on the basis of someone else's screw-up. Just wanted to bring up the point that it's not an absolute, and depends who you are insured with. I don't doubt other carriers pull this kind of stuff. In fact, I am aware of it."

You don't technically need to be certified through the state unless you will be selling through the Marketplace. Overall its easy to quote and sell, its quick (unless its through the marketplace - the first app will take you about 45 mins depending on if you have all the required info for the app). Commissions are fairly low so you're looking for high volume sales. Only issue I've run into is the commissions coming on time. Either delayed or not receiving commissions on all my written policies."

Pretty much free business so why not utilize it. I have only done individual since where I am i can do those apps online. Group coverage is still on paper here and there are no subsidies. You get paid comm on the full amount of the monthly premium (not the subsidized amount) so almost all my apps are through the marketplace. I'm sure group policies will be much more profitable since you are doing a lump sum at once but no experience in it yet.

Insurance,3cfn4t,theINSURANCEguy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:33:47 2015 UTC,the ACA subsidy can only be received if the app was submitted through the marketplace. some companies incorporated the marketplace into their own rating systems to make it a little easier and faster for receiving commissions. I would say you need at least an app a day to survive unless you already have an existing book. Not sure if that answers your questions

You get better prices for having auto and home together.   For home, you need to look at coverage A dwelling coverage amount. The other coverages are typically a % of that amount. The enhanced coverages typically add an extra 25% or 50% to that amount.  For auto, look at bodily injury amounts. I wouldn't go lower than $100/300/100k. Also, your deductible amounts will greatly effect your cost, especially collision."

Depending on your state, these companies can't do just home insurance because in general, they are auto insurance companies that offer home insurance as a benefit to their current auto customers.   When you go through a broker, you'll find companies that are just as credible as these ""big names"" but are significantly cheaper because they don't blow money on marketing. Last, and again depending on your state, check your Allstate wind/hail deductible. If it's a house over $100,000, you could have a high deductible for roof claims.

Dad has an active policy, but on another vehicle. If I have this right, then yes, there would be no coverage. She does qualify as an insured, but that's only under the dad's policy while driving dad's car, for which there is insurance. Dad's policy does not extend coverage to another car, because she must qualify as insured for the vehicle described in the policy. She was driving another vehicle.  All this just so that I tell you that insurance companies insure cars, not people. There has to be an active policy on the vehicle being driven in order to extend coverage. If it worked the way you understand it, then I could have 7 cars in a household and only pay premiums for one. Each car must have it's own active policy. Chances are it's just a standard policy form which I should be able to work out the details for you."
Insurance,3cgtak,northofindy,3,Tue Jul 7 21:17:20 2015 UTC,According to the OP they denied coverage  due to an exclusion  which means she probably was an insured as defined by the policy but coverage  was excluded for another reason.

Insurance,3cgtak,superhubris,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:46:40 2015 UTC,"Because NC and SC law allow for the non-owner driver of the uninsured vehicle to be named in a lawsuit, the NC policy allows for first- and third-party coverages to extend to otherwise non-insured vehicle being driven by an insured in in the event of an un- or underinsured exposure. This is done specifically to protect the insured, especially in the event the insured was unaware that the non-owned auto they were driving is uninsured. I was under the impression that the SC policy also allowed for this, but it appears that the NC coverage extension is mandated by the rate bureau. SC insurers are apparently allowed to exclude coverage for a whole host of reasons.  In five years of doing this I have never run into this scenario until today."

Insurance,3cfn9n,key2616,5,Tue Jul 7 20:20:30 2015 UTC,"Depending on what form is being quoted, the Liquor Exclusion in the GL policy might come into play.  Generally speaking, it reads something like ""if you are in the business of selling alcohol..."" to carve back Host Liquor.  Not all ISO forms read that way, but some do.    OP, you need both the Product Liability and the Liquor Liability since you or your employees/contractors will occasionally be serving it to people, with or without a charge.  If you've got both already for $3,000, then you've got a great deal.  Buy it since there's not much more that you can save."

Insurance,3ch5vx,throwawayhihelp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:43:24 2015 UTC,Your best bet is contacting a local independent insurance agent.  Doesn't cost you anything and they will be able to answer all of your questions while also having direct knowledge of what's available locally.
Insurance,3cfn1c,sodaporp,4,Tue Jul 7 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"L&O coverage usually applies to changes in local ordinances/laws. For example, you have a loss and while rebuilding the inspector says ""now you need interior sprinklers to get up to code"". L&O would afford you coverage for this situation. That being said, it is hard to predict the future with regards to ordinance changes. Every policy will have a different limit for L&O. Some are policy limit and others are a percentage of the dwelling limit or a specific dollar amount. Every policy I write includes L&O coverage even if the property is fairly new. I recently had an L&O claim where a client struck his gas line while doing house repairs. It was found out that new codes required the line to be buried 6 feet prior to getting his occupancy permit. In this case, he would have been out $15k if he had not had L&O coverage."
Insurance,3cfn1c,gunjr,2,Tue Jul 7 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I mentioned to another commenter that my L&O limit is 100% of my Cov A limits.  So to clarify, L&O isn't really designed for installation of wiring/plumbing that may have been installed out of code before I lived here.. it's more to keep up with the changing codes?"
Insurance,3cfn1c,britt5689,6,Tue Jul 7 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"No. If your home has old wiring and old plumbing, eventually you just have to pay to have your house rewired, and pay for new plumbing. In order for your L&O to kick in, you have to be repairing/fixing something directly related to a covered loss. Now, had the wiring caught fire and burned a portion of your home, by all means new wiring would be installed, but it seems here like you discovered some out of date wiring by tearing out some wet drywall, or some wet subflooring. If you want to replace your wiring, now would certainly be a good time to do it, however, it is not covered because a loss hasn't occurred, and fixing it isn't required to bring your home up to your city/state code."
Insurance,3cfn1c,Arishem5102,2,Tue Jul 7 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's what I needed to know. I just didn't want to be in the middle of a renovation and have the town inspector require way more work than we were looking to immediately have to do. Thanks!"
Insurance,3cfn1c,Arishem5102,3,Tue Jul 7 16:26:39 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, is your question how much of the cost of L&O required repairs is typically covered under insurance, or what the insurance company is required to do upon discovery of things that are out of code?"
Insurance,3cg4ul,SubparCactus,3,Tue Jul 7 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"First... did you contact the tow yard where your car was and let them know that it was okay to be moved? They can't release the vehicle to AAA or any other tow company or collision shop until you release it.   Second... contact the claim rep and when you get his/her voicemail, press 0. Most major carriers have a system where it will send it to the next available rep. If that does not work, call the claims reporting number on your card, explain the situation and taht you need help NOW. Ask to speak with the claim reps' manager.   Third... if you are unhappy with how AAA is handling it, let the at-fault carrier handle it upfront and cut out your carrier as the middle man. That is always an option. They could take over the rental car (and with the at-fault carrier, there is no day limit on how long you can have the rental so long as your car is being fixed)."
Insurance,3cg4ul,ttho10,2,Tue Jul 7 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"First: Yup, I called and released the car and informed the tow yard that the collision shop will be picking the car up, and that AAA is handling this claim.  Second: Ill try pressing 0. Didn't know about that. When ever i tried getting information about my claim by calling the number on my insurance card etc, I would always get transferred to one of the 2 unresponsive adjusters on my claim.   Third: I was always under the impression that I had to inform my insurance when I was involved in an accident and have them work with the other party. But, if that is not the case, then I will probably try and do it that way if I'm unable to get it resolved through a manager.   Thanks for your help!"
Insurance,3cg4ul,ttho10,4,Tue Jul 7 17:44:40 2015 UTC,"You are supposed to contact your insurance company to let them know you've been in an accdient, yes.

I was finally able to get in touch with a supervisor thanks to your suggestion, and less than 5 minutes after the call I was in another conference call with the collision shop and a different adjuster. Apparently everyone I spoke with earlier at AAA didn't let the body shop know about the claim or anything at all after ensuring me multiple times that they did.   Just seems like I got unlucky enough to be stuck with a couple of bad apples."
Insurance,3cfywv,temporal_agent_5,2,Tue Jul 7 16:45:36 2015 UTC,"You can apply up to 30 days prior to losing your current coverage and up to 60 days after to be eligible to apply. Or you can apply after 11/15 for the regular enrollment date. Or you can go through COBRA to extend your health benefits while you look for new employment. the Healthcare Marketplace will decline you if you have ZERO income since it is for LOW income. If you will have ZERO income, i would look into your state or local county office and apply for miedicaid. I hope my answer helps"
Insurance,3cfywv,theINSURANCEguy,2,Wed Jul 8 16:39:22 2015 UTC,"The marketplace will decline me? I thought I'd be declined for assistance/credit/whatever, not denied for insurance. Also, my state hasn't expanded medicaid yet so that's not a thing. At this point I just want the price I saw on the estimation page."
Insurance,3cfywv,theINSURANCEguy,2,Wed Jul 8 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"they will only decline you for subsidy. You will have to pay full price for healthcare at that point. Without an income, that would be hard. Contact your local office - from what i understand as of 2015 CA should've been one of the states that expanded - SOURCE: https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/resources/primers/medicaidmap Not sure how credible the source is but it was on Google and it was on the internet so it must be true"
Insurance,3cfywv,theINSURANCEguy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding, btw. Now, I'm not sure what subsidy is - is that just a credit or a cheaper payment? - but I can tell you what I think I learned, and you could tell me if it's wrong.  I can do COBRA but it'll probably be 500-600 per month, but that's for 18 months and only if I need it. (I don't intend to choose this option.)  I can register for a plan at healthcare.gov. I did the questions and it said ""It doesn't look like you qualify for (what i assume to be the subsidy you mentioned)"", so I continued to plans. ""Full price"" here would be the listed plans - starting at 166/mo. (That's only an estimate because I haven't actually given my info yet.) I can do 166/mo for a little while.  Any problems there? Thanks again."
Insurance,3cfywv,theINSURANCEguy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"So a subsidy is government support in paying for your health premiums. So if your premium is 300 a month but your income is low enough where something like that is hard to afford, the healthcare marketplace will evaluate how much you can afford. So lets say the government thinks you can afford 80 a month, then the subsidy will be 220. you pay the insurance company 80 and the rest will be afforded by the subsidy. If you registered and received quotes from healthcare.gov with 0 income, most likely the cheap rates you received were catastrophic plans. In my opinion its a crap way of having coverage to avoid paying a penalty. you're covered for almost nothing until your copay/outofpocket/deductibles are met. If thats the case and you do qualify for medicaid (if it truly is expanded in your state) why not get coverage for free while you receive income again?"
Insurance,3cfywv,theINSURANCEguy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I forgot to include this: I'm not in CA. My state is among those listed as ""not expanded"" on healthcare.gov.  Also, I saw this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/18gvki/lpt_if_you_are_healthy_or_cannot_afford_a_good/ Is this something you agree with? It seems sensible on the surface. (I can get an exclusion/exemption, I'm pretty sure, but why?)  Is there something about catastrophic plans that I don't know? I thought all plans had to cover that same basic list of things. Thanks once again."
Insurance,3cf9gh,HalcyonEndures,7,Tue Jul 7 13:31:14 2015 UTC,"Because when you get your very first policy, you have no proof of prior insurance and you're immediately classed as a high risk driver. You're also a single male under the age of 26 paying full coverage on a car. You also said you went to a shitty buy here pay here lot which means you probably have no credit, or poor credit. All these things are counting against you. Progressive accepts 6 months of continuous insurance as a prior insurance discount so start shopping around."
Insurance,3cf9gh,britt5689,7,Tue Jul 7 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"The easiest question first:   Can I simply call in and have them change my rate down to the cheaper plan, considering it's what I've already got and I'm still paying more for it?   No. They will not do that.   Are you 100% positive you put in the exact same coverages - limits, deductibles, etc.  The exact same info on use of the vehicle? The same garaging address as when you bought your policy? Do you have any tickets, etc. that my come up during formal underwriting?

Insurance,3cf9gh,dan_232,2,Tue Jul 7 16:51:28 2015 UTC,"You're now eligible for a continuous insurance discount since you've had insurance without a lapse for six months. Credit is also a big factor. Has your credit improved? Any accidents or tickets fall off? They're rated for 3-5 years.   Can I simply call in and have them change my rate down to the cheaper plan, considering it's what I've already got and I'm still paying more for it?   I would call and verify the quote. Some companies don't give a continuous insurance discount if they find out you are with them already."

Never had any tickets or accidents, it's a completely clean driving record.  In all honesty, would it be easier to just get insurance through someone else? The top comment mentioned something like this as well, and if they can't give me the discount, how easy is it to just switch over to someone else? Progressive and Nationwide for example gave me some good prices as well."
Insurance,3cf9gh,silverr90,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:53:11 2015 UTC,"Switch to Progressive. But don't do an online quote, those aren't accurate and don't run credit or mvr until you purchase, then they adjust your rates accordingly.

Insurance,3cf9gh,theINSURANCEguy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:58:44 2015 UTC,Your credit being bad might be part of the problem. Many major insurance providers take credit score into account when they calculate premium.
Insurance,3cf9gh,Poisonouskiwi,2,Wed Jul 8 00:26:09 2015 UTC,"Change it asap, assuming nothing has occurred in the last 6 months. Same coverage for $100 less? sounds like a no brainer to me. It could be your age or it could be a multiple of factors, but my best guess is you had no prior insurance or insurance history. Insurers don't like that, but now that you have at least 6 months of insurance history with no lapse - your credit has gone up and will most likely be accepted at most preferred carriers. Call an independent broker to rate all of their companies for you instead of going on multiple sites on your own. Makes life a hell of a lot easier."

Insurance,3cfxrx,JWWally,5,Tue Jul 7 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"Texas resident here, licensed rep also. I'm in a very similar personal situation as you. It may help by explaining what happens if you don't have uninsured coverage. Keep in mind also that basically anything falling under hit and run could be qualified under UMPD with a $250 deductible and rental benefits as well. In the absence of that coverage, you would be stuck going to your regular collision coverage, subject to whatever deductible you chose, and rental coverage IF you have it. If you were by chance hurt, then you're right, it would follow your medical insurance. I've seen plenty of hit and runs and uninsured/underinsured claims. Most do not have an injury, but people are stuck with hit and run losses paying out of pocket collision deductibles. It seems that Texas drivers tend to be a special breed of assholes when it comes to parking and parking lot accidents.    So really, the only thing here to ""pick apart"" is how much of a level of risk you are willing to retain. 140 bucks a year, if you have a 1 grand deductible on collision, that would mean about 5 years of saving that 140 bucks to make up the difference from 1 grand down to 250 deductible.  Only you can make that decision. In my mind, uninsured is plenty worth it for the property damage coverage benefits alone. So you kind of have to figure out whether or not you want the 250 deductible and rental benefit above and beyond what you carry now, OR you could add those levels of property damage coverage and do away with the ""duplication"" of sort."
Insurance,3cfxrx,f1shbone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"Here in Ohio hit and runs NEVER fall under the UMPD. It's always a collision claim, and if you don't have collision, you're screwed. We actually have to know and verify the person at fault in the accident has no active coverage before we can go through with a UMPD claim. I can't even add UMPD if somebody has collision, my software won't even allow it. Crazy how much stuff varies state to state."
Insurance,3cfxrx,britt5689,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:00:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're right. California, Indiana, North Carolina, Illinois, Utah, New Jersey and Rhode Island are the other states which likewise do NOT recognize UMPD when the driver is unknown. Mississippi also has a rule in which UPD only applies if the insured was actually in the vehicle at the time it was struck and the driver unknown."

FTFY   I don't need UI Property Damage because I carry collision    Based on your financials, I agree with you.  For the last part of your question you seem to muddling up 3 different coverages: PIP, Medpay, and UM/UIM (these are combined in TX, you can't choose one or the other).  Here's what the TX Dept of Insurance has to say:  Medpay:   What it pays: Your medical and funeral bills resulting from accidents, including an accident involving a pedestrian or bicyclist.  Who it covers: You, your family members, and passengers in your car, regardless of who caused the accident.   PIP:   What it pays: Same as medical payments coverage, plus 80 percent of lost income and the cost of hiring a caregiver for an injured person.  Who it covers: You, your family members, and passengers in your car, regardless of who caused the accident.   UM/UIM:   What it pays: Your expenses from an accident caused by an uninsured motorist, a motorist who did not have enough insurance, or a hit-and-run driver.  Who it covers: You, your family members, passengers in your car, and others driving your car with your permission.   The words I've bolded in the quotes from TDI constitutes my argument against rejecting these coverages."

That said, while you have an accurate idea of what you'd look like without your parents, you don't have an accurate picture of the actual costs.  It should be much lower to add you to their coverage, and it is generally a pretty good assumption that they will have higher liability limits than you were considering (which is good).  You can try to play around with the deductibles for the Camry by raising and lowering them to see the impact there, but the liability is going to be the main cost for you."

Insurance,3cecc7,tdschwarz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:57:16 2015 UTC,"You can't purchase a policy from allstate under the age of 18 so your quote isn't even remotely accurate. You will have to be added as a house hold driver under your parents policy. Allstate offers great discounts for good grades, and taking some online safety courses as well. It will probably be in the ball park of 90ish dollars a month to add you as a driver to the policy. An insurance policy is a legally binding contract and you're a minor, and can't sign a contract on your own.  EDIT: Also, in Allstate, you do not get added to the policy as a house hold driver until you have your license, when you have your permit you're automatically covered assuming you're driving with one of your parents in the vehicle with you at all time, and the vehicle is listed on the policy."

Anyway- there is no insurance carrier out there that will ""schedule"" a cell phone on your home/renters insurance with no deductible- for a variety of reasons. Only thing out there is the insurance via your cell carrier... Coming from someone in the insurance industry for over 10 years- stop insuring little things.

That being said... while I'm actually pretty sure my company will schedule a phone with no deductible, if you have one suspicious loss, we'll remove all phones from your policy.

Just about the only thing you can do now is sit tight, get your life back on track, and hope to hear back soon. If the policyholder does not return our calls, we can send an ""ultimatum"" letter stating if we do not hear back by this date and this time, we will move forward with handling without cooperation, and make a decision based on the facts presented. DO NOT lose that recording, because in the absence of a witness confirming the loss, I may actually deny it until I got some other 3rd party verification this took place. Failure to cooperate is a very big deal, it is a breach of contract and grounds for termination of insurance."

Case in point: The Subaru BRZ and Scion FRS are essentially the same vehicle, same safety features, power, etc. A Colleague wanted the BRZ, but the FRS was actually much lower to insure because, on average, more BRZ drivers in his province were getting into accidents.  When in doubt, many insurance companies will let you grab a quote for a given vehicle. If one trim is more to insure than another, that will almost certainly hold true for any insurance company you go through."

If you can get a couple of different VINs, an independent agent could quote them out for you. Not exactly a difficult process."

IF this document means that you are releasing their financial responsibilities to your bodily injury, then this is troubling because lets say 5 years down the line, you find that you have chronic back pain and it traces back to this incident. All your medical expenses, therapy sessions, and medication will come out of your pocket. You are releasing them from any financial responsibility that may arise from this incident in the future.   If this document only refers to property damage, then it's fine to sign because they've already agreed to pay for the damages that arose from this incident.   Super important: make sure you find out whether or not signing the document means that you release them of all responsibility from your bodily injuries.   p.s. if the incident was just a small thing and you know for a fact that you're not going to have any underlying health issues from this, then I wouldn't bother getting an attorney, and i'd just sign the thing. but you have to make 110% sure that you really didn't sustain any injuries that'll show up later on."

You'll be out your deductible.  Maybe there'll be a legal battle and at the end of it you'll get your deductible back.

Sure, your health plan may cover chemotherapy, but what about the lost income for time off work to receive treatment? A policy which delivers a lump sum of tax free cash could be a great solution for such a concern.  These policies are often very inexpensive, but this also reflects the unlikely nature of what's covered. You could also self insure by having other assets to tap on in such a situation. As is usual in insurance, it's all about risk exposure.  If you're able to qualify for universal life, it might make sense to use a policy like to to cover you until you're able to make 'preferred' policy loans with no effective interest.  Some of these policies offer a 'return of premium' rider, it pays out a sum if you don't have a claim over some period of time, such agiven that I've seen such riders almost double the cost of coverage and have some catches, I'm not that sold on them being a good idea.

Is she having pain? Is it actually part of her tooth or an old crown?  I also know people who went to the dentist in an emergency because part of their tooth broke, but it turned out to be a piece of tartar because it has been so long since they went. If it were part of a live tooth I would think she would be in agony.   If she is not in pain, your best best may just be finding a low cost office that can look at it and tell her what exactly is happening, and then decide on options at that time, after you know how extensive the work is going to be. There are some chain places that specialize in payment plans. If it is really urgent, she may end up having to open a CareCredit account."

I dont wanna ask the mechanic as he might lie to me(he works at the official dealership for my car) Will do this. How much longer can it run? I can probably get the amount in 2 months time..maybe 2 and a half but I should be able to have around $1000 by the end of this week. Can I? The guy said he could not even do the aligment due to whatever is bent down there. Can I really fix all that myself?   Thanks though..
Insurance,3cb5sn,HackPhilosopher,2,Mon Jul 6 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"Read your warranty, and call. There should be a separate phone number to call with the warranty paperwork.   If it is truly just a damaged shield, yes you should be able to easily replace it yourself. Then go get an alignment."
Insurance,3cb5sn,ornothumper,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:11:57 2015 UTC,I will do. Thank you I will check out waht to do about the shield. The radiator def needs to get fixed by a mechanic though right?
Insurance,3cb5sn,constantino1,4,Mon Jul 6 16:23:13 2015 UTC,"No. Radiators are simple to replace. Unhook the hoses from the old one, remove the bolts holding it on, and swap it out, and refill it with antifreeze. Mechanics at car dealerships are the worst, they will tell you your car is about to explode and it needs 3000 dollars worth of work when in reality, nothing is wrong. If your radiator was really THAT bad, it would be leaking antifreeze, and your car would be over heating frequently.   EDIT: Also, this isn't something that would be covered by insurance anyway, and if you filed a third claim, you would be dropped. Buy the parts yourself from auto zone and take them to a certified mechanic that ISN'T at a car dealership. Most radiators cost under 200 dollars and it might require two hours of labor at 50ish dollars an hour."
Insurance,3cb5sn,dewprisms,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"If you decide to replace the radiator yourself, do a quick Google search online and find out what kind of anti freeze your vehicle takes. There are various colors (green,orange etc) some are available at a local Kragen (O'Reilly) or Autozone but some are only available from the dealership. You would have to find out which your vehicle takes. As stated prior swapping them is very quick/easy. Wish you best of luck to get your issues resolved!"
Insurance,3cb5sn,to11mtm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:08:53 2015 UTC,To help with your first point: dealerships make a good amount of money from their service bay. They love recalls because they bill the automaker for the services provided and usually have a set rate that they are paid per car for a recall. I have talked to some dealerships who have told me the automaker almost always overbudgets the time and will pay for 2 hours of labor for things that probably only take 1 so the dealership gets to profit. If there was a recall they would most likely tell you.

Insurance,3c84bs,wellbeyond,6,Sun Jul 5 20:06:49 2015 UTC,"Lot of things wrong with this website.  First off, an HSA is not an ""alternative to Obamacare.""  There are numerous HSA-qualified HDHP plans on the exchanges.  And it's stupid to even suggest that the IRS ""snoops"" into your health care decisions.  There is no ""US government"" between you and your health care decisions either.    Second off, show me a 21 year old that has $400 to contribute to their general savings or IRA let alone their health care savings account.  The average HSA account balance for those under 25 was $697.  For those 65 and older, the average account balance was $4460.  http://www.ebri.org/pdf/briefspdf/EBRI_IB_400_June14.HSAs.pdf That's far off from what you perceive people being able to set aside.    Third off, none of your procedure costs include any medical inflation.  A $5000 procedure in 1980 now costs $29,000.      Fourth, the average employer+employee insurance premium is not $1200 a month.  The average yearly premium is $6025.  The average yearly HDHP with savings option premium is $5299.  http://kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2014-summary-of-findings/  To have an HSA, you still need to couple it with an HDHP.  That's about the only way you'd be able to have a ""major procedure"" anywhere near $5000 (insurance kicking in after meeting the deductible.""  Yet, these calculations seem to ignore the insurance premium of the HDHP altogether.    Lastly, you are low-balling number of doctors visits.  The average working adult visits their PCP 3.9 times a year.  Your costs also completely exclude visits to specialists, which would be required for any ""major procedure.""  You've also excluded any lab tests and imaging costs.  And ER visits are more than $2500.    This just is not useful information at all."

The last I looked at HSA's, you put money in them and if there was any leftover you lost it.   NOTE:  You can change the contributions, age and family size.  The ""procedures"" in the right hand column are randomly generated and won't be the same next time you look at it.  Your looking at the numbers ""as things exist now"", I'm trying to see about what an expanded HSA will do.   A company I once worked for hired lots of 21 year olds, and they paid a portion of their health care premium and the company paid the remainder.  My assumption is those funds would go to a high limit policy and the rest to an HSA. I haven't seen any decent inflation predictions and for the purpose of this exercise there isn't a need to factor in inflation because it should affect your salary and health care costs roughly the same. You can enter any premium combo you want.  I got the default $1,200 after taking to a couple CFO's and CEO's I know from medium sized companies.

The whole purpose of this exercise is because I hear ""repeal obama care and replace it with an improved HSA""   I haven't heard anybody but the extreme far-right say that.  Yet, at the same time, they complain about high deductible health plans, which are mandatory with HSA-qualified plans.   The last I looked at HSA's, you put money in them and if there was any leftover you lost it.   HSAs have never worked that way.  You have always been able to keep money that you put into HSAs.  FSAs, no.  HSAs, yes.   My assumption is those funds would go to a high limit policy and the rest to an HSA.   From the company's perspective, that would yield an $800 contribution PER YEAR to an employee's HSA given that's the difference between an HSA-qualified HDHP total cost and a PPO/HMO plan (as shown in the KFF link).     I haven't seen any decent inflation predictions and for the purpose of this exercise there isn't a need to factor in inflation because it should affect your salary and health care costs roughly the same.

I have literally given you the numbers for employer plans; HSA-HDHP versus HMO/PPO.  The savings is $800 per year.  Not per month.  I saw that you claimed in another post that you pay $350 for 3 of you, but, you're 54 years old.  The only way that you can get to $350 for the 3 of you would be through subsidies.  Thanks Obamacare.  Looking over the rates for Alabama for a 54 year old with 2 kids (under 18) on the plan, you'd be paying around $700 without subsidies.   Inflation is a huge factor.  How do you think we got to where we are with medical in the first place?  And no, most people do not get better prices by paying out of pocket.  You get the insurance negotiated price that comes with your HDHP.   It's not.  It gives the difference between the current policy and the ""Turbo HSA.""  Doesn't include the cost of the HDHP policy.  For instance, I enter a realistic hypothetical situation; 21 year old female, no kids, no marriage, $200 current policy, $180 HDHP, $100 HSA contribution.  The TurboHSA is $20 per month.  Where's the premium for the HDHP?  Total cost should be $180 (for the premium) + $100 (contribution) per month.  By the way, this hypothetical female is in the hole $4000 after 2 years compared to standard insurance and has lost $54k compared to standard insurance by age 64. I'm giving national averages.  No matter how you look at it, the costs are still lowballed. From UAB?  For a knife wound?  Not possible.

As for repairs, it's your car and your insurance is primary for this accident. You pay your deductible and get your car fixed, the insurance will then pursue to reimburse your deductible. If you are somehow found to be at fault (your friend), your liability coverage pays for the other car, your collision coverage pays for your car anything above your deductible.

If your friend wants to pay for your repairs, wait until you've settled the claim with your insurance and tell them you're not claiming your repairs but keep in mind you'll have to document the repairs in case you have any future losses with that vehicle. If they pay for property damage only, it's possible the cost will be low enough to not effect your rates but I'm not sure what the cop car looks like nor what state farms guidelines are for policy renewals in regards to rates.

What kind of rash are they referring to, on her shoulders or under her breasts from having large breasts? Please elaborate.   Ah, ok, so I had a thought, if it's because she's never had a rash under her breasts or on her shoulders from her bra, then they would be denying because she hasn't tried ""ALL"" non-invasive solutions prior to jumping into surgery.

This can absolutely be resolved by having her physician writing an appeal letter stating something like ""...although (patient name) has never been precribed (enter rash medication name here), she has had rashes in the past but was able to self-medicate using corn-starch/baby-powder (etc)"".   If she has NEVER had a rash under her breasts that she self treated with corn-starch/baby-powder, then I have to HIGHLY doubt that she actually is in the need of a breast reduction, I say that only due to my own personal experiences.   tl;dr: If your ta ta's are not big enough to have EVER caused a rash underneath the ta ta's, then they are not big enough for insurance to covered breast reduction (IMO)"

To answer your questions - yes, if they confirm the hospital is out of network, you are screwed and will have to pay your bill.  You can always try to negotiate with the hospital to cut your bill, but that doesn't often work.  To your second question - it depends.  In my experience, it's uncommon for a physician's office not to be in the same network as their affiliated hospital IF their office is actually owned/run by the same hospital group or the doctor is contracted with that hospital group.  However, if their office is independent of any hospital group and simply have rights at a particular hospital that they normally refer to, then it's much more common that they may not be covered under the same network."

IF she has her own policy, she should have a tenants policy. This would mean she only has contents for liability. There would be no coverage for the structure (condo or home).  You will need to get a rented dwelling package, since she is paying you to live there is will be considered a rental, not a secondary home.   If there a liability claim, say someone came to visit and they tripped and broke their leg, you are have a liability exposure and could be sued.   If there was a fire you will need your own policy in order to have the damages to the condo/home repaired."

Insurance,3c0doy,Cicatrized,5,Fri Jul 3 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"Used to be a lot of companies would allow it to be written as a secondary residence with a resident relative.  However, a lot of companies I find these days want a landlord policy to be written for this situation especially since she is paying rent.  I agree with the above, your mom should definitely get herself renters insurance for her personal property and liability (500,000 minimum is my recommendation always).  Always best to have the coverage written correctly even if it may be more."

But this would be up to the discretion of the underwriter on whether or not they want it insured as a rental.  If she is paying rent, it's almost guaranteed you need a landlord policy.  If she is paying you rent, in addition to you getting a landlord policy your mother will need a tenant policy. Your landlord policy will  not protect her in the event of a lawsuit (i.e. if she starts a fire and it spreads to your neighbours unit), also her contents will not be replaced after a loss."

Most states are around 2/3 of the difference between your average weekly wage prior to the injury and the light duty work average weekly wage.  I'd have to look up Texas comp law a bit further since it's been awhile since I've had to deal with it.   Does he have to stay at the same workplace if he expects workers comp to pay the bills?   No, the comp claim stays active until the claimant returns to the pre-work status or reach maximum medical improvement.  It doesn't matter if you get a job somewhere else.   Does worker comp cover expensive things such as MRI and neuro consultations?   Yes, as long as it's causally related and the medical provider accepts comp claims.   The employer hasn't made us any suggestions as of which doctors to see but the pcp we went to did fill out workers compensation forms, am I safe to assume they do take worker comp and will direct is to places where they will take it too?   Employers aren't allowed to direct care to the injured worker.  It's considered a conflict of interest (although some carriers have 'preferred vendors' which they may recommend).  Ask your doctor if they accept comp.  If they refer you to a specialist ask if they accept comp (they most likely will).   What are some red flags about when to get a lawyer?   THat's a tough question.  I generally don't advocate for attorneys in most cases.  Most claims adjusters be more than happy to go over your case in depth with you.  But, if you want the peace of mind that an attorney provides, by all means get one.  Texas is a bit more employer-friendly then almost every other state's comp system so I'd keep that in mind too.  If you have a complicated issue I'd recommend it like having multiple parties involves, controverted claims, MVAs, something like that I'd definitely recommend an attorney.  Hope this helps.  If you want some more personalized advice feel free to PM me.  Edit: I just read the /r/legaladvice post.  The sheet to give to the boss is likely an accident report.  Every company does it a bit different so it's hard to say.  It may be an OSHA thing.  It may be a 'claimant report of injury' that the state's Workers Comp Department requires.  It may just be for their own records.  The employer may controvert the claim although it should be reported to the insurance carrier regardless.  If it does become controverted I'd recommend an attorney.  But I wouldn't jump into getting an attorney before there are actually issues in contention since that would raise some red flags too."

Insurance,3bxgbr,LASuperdome,2,Fri Jul 3 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"The maximum weekly benefit for a recent Texas comp claim is $860.52.  I was a little off on my numbers in my previous post (Texas is 70% instead of 66.7%).  So light duty benefits would be calculated as:  ($2,500 - $200) * 0.7 = $1,610  $1,610 is higher than $860.52 so he would be eligible for the maximum weekly rate of $860.52/week.

From my understanding major companies that are located in different states offer their home office location's provider. Usually a PPO so it can be used nationally versus having to go to a doctor that accepts the insurance. Overall, IBX has a different name varying by state or county. Mostly all owned by the same company, just different location. So from what you have told us, we cannot really determine since all that was given was the name of the company, not which policy you are determining to go with.

If you call up the enrollment dept at these providers and ask them point blank why you should choose them over your other options, you should get some good food for thought as well."
Insurance,3bvy0w,DiscordianAgent,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"Every Blue Cross/Shield state or plan is a separate insurance company.  They are licensed by the Blue Cross Association (BCA) to use the BCBS logos and whatnot.  Each separate BCBS state plan contracts with the health care providers in their state/area only.  The agreement with the BCA allows for interplan claims processing.  You're in CA and visit a doctor there that is in the national BlueCard network (which they have contracted through the local BCBS plan).  They send the claim to the local BCBS CA plan.  That plan applies pricing information or the ""allowed amount"" for the service.  That information is then sent to the NM Blue who applies your benefit information to the claim and sends it back to CA.  CA cuts a check and sends payment info to the provider.  NM sends the EOB to you.  The provider always sends BCBS member claims (from every state) to the local Blue.  If they need to call, they always call only the local Blue.  As a member of the NM Blue, you always work with NM Blue and never any of the other Blues.  Everyone only works with one Blue.  There is a BIG CATCH to all of this.  Many state Blues offer multiple provider networks.  Some of these are LOCAL ACCESS NETWORKS ONLY.  Meaning they are only considered IN-NETWORK for local BCBS members of that state and not National BCBS networks.  And if you ask a doctor or hospital if they are in the BCBS network - they say, ""oh yeah, we take Blue Cross,"" or, ""we are in-network for Blue Cross.""  But they are not in the NATIONAL network.  And then you're f---ed because you used an out-of-network provider.  So if you enroll in BCBS of NM.  CALL BCBS OF NM and not the doctor or hospital.  There is also a National BlueCard telephone number and website to look up providers in any state.  Never rely on the doctor's office or hospital to tell you if they are in the network or not."

If you didn't, it could be construed as concealment of a material day and they could void your policy when you had a claim."
Insurance,3bu4uv,jaunt,2,Thu Jul 2 11:21:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you, seems to me there should be some kind of way to explain an incident though :/"
Insurance,3bu4uv,fiveeightthirteen,2,Thu Jul 2 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"Depending on how long ago it was, it may not matter. As a broker, I try my best to only ask the questions that the insurance company needs to know. It should go ""Do you have a dog? if yes, what kind?"" If your dog is one of the aggressive breeds, you probably won't get accepted anyways. If there's a dogbite on your claim history, it will show up when the agent runs the loss history report. If it was never filed against your insurance company, then you're probably in the clear as long as you answer the questions truthfully.   You don't need to share any more information than what is asked of you."
Insurance,3bu4uv,emptydiner,3,Thu Jul 2 14:25:22 2015 UTC,"I get your point and agree with you completely about not offering information that isn't asked for but if the question is ""has your dog ever bitten anyone"" and the dog has bitten someone, then your response kind of contradicts itself."
Insurance,3bu4uv,fiveeightthirteen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"I agree--maybe it varies by state, but is that a question that you ask up front or do you go through categorically and ask if they have a dog, then an aggressive dog?

That is what needs to be answered. It doesn't matter if it resulted in a claim or not. Your dog biting someone defensively still leaves them open to responding to a suit for damages."

Insurance,3bu4uv,EmeraldGirl,0,Thu Jul 2 14:11:57 2015 UTC,"I've never asked someone if their dog has bitten someone unless their dog is already on the aggressive breed list. The insurance company only requires me to ask if they have a dog, if yes, what kind, if on the list, does it have a bite history.   If the questioning makes it to the aggressive breed list, there's already an issue even if the dog has never bitten someone.  There are also several companies that will exclude animal liability."

Insurance,3bu4uv,emptydiner,7,Fri Jul 3 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"In addition to all the other posts here, I'd say that your dog biting someone because someone ran around the corner while it was taking a shit isn't exactly 'defensive' in my mind. If I were an underwriter, I would probably refuse to insure you.  In my mind, defensive is something along the lines of your house gets broken into and it bites the intruder. Not that it got 'surprised'. That just means it will bite someone again the next time it's 'surprised'."
Insurance,3bu4uv,Zen_Drifter,4,Thu Jul 2 17:10:19 2015 UTC,"I hate it when people run up on me while I'm taking a shit also but I learned to stop biting them because we couldn't get insurance any longer.  You really should say yes to the question however it makes you almost uninsurable.  You can explain your situation in the notes section but it probably isn't going to fly and if it does, any incident resulting from the dog will be denied.  Are you sure the dog bit someone, or did it just nip at them?  Is it really your dog or did you give it to someone else that lives in the house?  Or perhaps you are just dog sitting...for a very long time.  You can say no to the main question but it might come back to bite you. ;-)  Sometimes telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth just doesn't work out.    Was the person injured?

Yes, but they forwarded the call to animal control    Who declared it defensive?     Animal control.   Seems you went to court for it.  if so, there's record of it so I would think really hard before saying no.     Nope, but I wouldn't doubt there is record due to animal control taking the report and conducting the investigation.   You could void your entire policy that way.     Which is no bueno.

Is there a questions on there asking if you've shot or killed anyone lately?     if there are, they're buried in the fine print, though I've still got a years worth of personal liability insurance covering such an instance.    If you do have a lot of guns, be sure to schedule them on your policy if you want them covered.     Excellent point that I only just recently found out about. I assumed all belongings were covered till they asked if I had jewellery, silverware (the actual silverware), high end computers, and or guns. Only then I found out I need a separate inclusion on the policy to cover those. Good looking out!"
Insurance,3bu4uv,key2616,3,Thu Jul 2 20:49:30 2015 UTC,"You have to check the ""yes"" box if you want there to be no chance that your insurer will deny a future claim for material misrepresentation on your application.  Dog bite laws vary from state to state. You can find assorted sites on the internet detailing the law in each state.  In many states there is ""strict liability"" for dog bites, meaning you're automatically liable for any damage your dog does with a few exceptions like the bitten person was engaged in committing a crime or was teasing or attacking a dog. (Proving that in a way that removes liability on the owner is difficult though.)   Strict liability can also extend beyond bites. If your dog runs out into the street and is hit by a car and the car suffers physical damage then you can also automatically owe for the damage to the car in strict liability states. I've handled cases in excess of $3,000 in damage from hitting dogs that were paid-out under the dog owner's homeowner's insurance."
Insurance,3bu4uv,britt5689,6,Thu Jul 2 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"You're seriously here looking for permission to lie to an insurance company?!  Really?  And you think that we'll say ""sure, that's a great idea!""?  Look, insurance companies aren't dumb, and that cuts both ways.  If they have reason to look into your history, they'll find out the truth pretty quickly if, for instance, they think you're lying to them.  And they'll figure out a way to punish you if you do that.  Or you can be an adult and tell them the truth and give them the details that you think exonerate your dog.  They may or may not choose to take that into account, and they may have a very good reason for not wanting to take on that risk.  But you're literally asking an insurance company to pledge hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend you AND pay judgments against you in exchange for a couple of hundred dollars.  Think about that swap and what you're getting.  Maybe it's not so much bullshit after all."
Insurance,3bu4uv,key2616,2,Thu Jul 2 11:44:00 2015 UTC,"You're seriously here looking for permission to lie to an insurance company?!  Really?  And you think that we'll say ""sure, that's a great idea!""?   No, I'm seriously here to see if there are exceptions that go beyond ""did your dog bite someone? Yes or no"". And yes I do find it bullshit, you get into a car accident, and after 5 years or so the insurance company forgets all about it, but if your dog bites someone once defensively it sticks with them till the day they die even if there are no other incidents... Forgive me for assuming that insurance companies may consider time since last incident.   Feel free to hop back on your horse."
Insurance,3bu4uv,britt5689,9,Thu Jul 2 14:11:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, I get it now.  You think that your dog is special and that whatever rules an insurance company may have shouldn't apply.  As I said, you can state your case for why you think they should make an exception.  The insurance company may or may buy into that.  But if the question is ""yes or no"", and you lie, then you're the one being shady, not the insurance company.  If you disclose it and the insurance company then denies a claim down the road saying they didn't know about the previous bite, then they're the ones being shady.  Whether or not you think the question is bullshit is completely immaterial.  If you don't want to answer the question, go find another insurance company that doesn't ask it.  Or find a company that will give you standalone dog bite coverage.  But if you just want to piss and moan that the very question is unfair, you clearly haven't ever seen how much it costs to try to repair a toddler's face after it's been bitten.  Which is the reality of what could happen with your dog, defensive or not."

With Ace keeping Chubb's name is suspect they are recognizing the Chubb brand and image. To an agent, Chubb's infrastructure also seems much better.

ACE bought Chubb primarily to gain access to their middle market and high net worth books.

The combination of the two creates the largest P&C insurer by underwriting income thanks to Chubb's consistently solid combined ratio."

Normally I would say just go through the appeals process but it doesn't seem like you have much time. Good luck
Insurance,3bt1tz,captainjoel,3,Thu Jul 2 05:12:12 2015 UTC,I reached out to my state insurance commissioner but he tells me I have to connect with the commissioner in the state in which my policy was issued. My company uses BC/BS Illinois and I live in Connecticut. So I am trying to find out the best way to contact the Illinois commissioner and I am trying to research exactly what is needed information wise when I call...
Insurance,3bt1tz,Waldoh,3,Thu Jul 2 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"Hi friend - contacting lawyers and advocates the insurance commish. are great and all, but these options aren't going to solve your issue in any sort of acceptable time-frame.  Here's what you need to do:   Find the clinical policy bulletin/guide for the exact procedure.  I did a quick search through anthem and got here. This may or may not be the one for you. If you have the procedure name (exact procedure name) or procedure code(s) that will be a huge help. If you need help with this send me a PM. Slowly and methodically read over each line in the Medically Necessary section until you actually understand it. If it becomes clear to you that you meet the criteria in the document then you need to stop right there and call your doctor/provider. It is your doctor's responsibility to provide the proof the insurance company needs to show that the criteria for coverage is clearly met. If there is no question that you meet the stated criteria, then someone didn't do their job. Print that shit out if you have to and talk to someone in person about it. I can't stress this one enough. I've seen people appeal and appeal and appeal and send it to a 3rd party for expedited appeal, and then send it up to the department of insurance, and then pay lawyers over something that could have been resolved on day 1 if the original pre-authorization request contained a specific x-ray or blood-test. It's ridiculous but it's not terribly uncommon. If your medical providers were right, and it's very clear that you don't meet one of the requirements listed in the clinical policy guideline, then you're pretty much on the right track. This will not get resolved quickly because your doctor is trying to authorize a procedure that Anthem does not consider medically necessary (even if it absolutely is). The department of insurance/insurance commissioner can not legally do anything until you have exhausted your policy's appeal rights. it varies by carrier and state regulations, but generally that's a 2-level appeal process, and then a 3rd appeal sent to an external vendor. If you get 3 denial letters, THEN the department of insurance can pick up the case.   I hope this is a good start, let me know if you need any help"
Insurance,3bt1tz,yellowchef,2,Thu Jul 2 23:32:13 2015 UTC,"Without knowing more information the best option is to file a written grievance with Anthem and call Anthem to see if you can be assigned a case manager. Sometimes this helps and gives you a single point of contact. Your case manager will probably claim no knowledge of how the decision was made, but they should be able to get you the written guidelines that explain the criteria for your surgery.  If you and your physicians feel you meet that you or maybe your doctor has a person that is a patient advocate that can help you with the grievance process."

Insurance,3bt1tz,FearStalksTheLand,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:44:45 2015 UTC,"So I am in a world of hurt, both mentally and physically. I have had lower back problems since 2004. For the first five years, I dealt with the pain, sucked it up and took pain meds when needed combined with physical therapy, chiropractor, etc. In 2009 it was bad enough at times that I went to see a spine specialist. He told me that the lowest disc in my back was severely degenerated but in his opinion I was too young for surgery so he wanted to go the injection route. So I tried that a few times, and it helped a bit.   In the last two years it has gotten life altering. The constant pain has me unable to do anything except the most simple errands (when the pain meds peak) and my work and personal life are suffering heavily for it. So I went to another spine specialist who took a new MRI and that disc that was severely degenerated is now all but gone. And I mean that... The disc literally looks like a pin head on the MRI. The surgeon didn't give me any recommendation but sent me to a second specialist for a second opinion. When the second doctor say the MRI, the first thing he said to me was ""Wow, how are you walking?"" The consensus was I need a fusion and fast. So, I was happy that I could hopefully get back to some semblance of happiness. Tomorrow was supposed to be my surgery... Yesterday they notified my doctor that the procedure would not be covered.  After calling the ""patient advocate"" line at Anthem I was also told that even with an urgent appeal the turn around time would be 72 hours. Ironically I got the call from my surgeon as I was being fit for a post surgical brace by an orthodist (which the insurance ok'd 100%). I was lucky enough to have a team at my surgeons that care and they moved heaven and earth to have a peer review with my surgeon, still denied....   You have to understand that until yesterday I was mentally seeing a light at the end of an eleven year journey and now it looks like I will have to wait another six months for a decision. My quality of life over the past year has gone done FAST, so I can only guess what another six months will do. What if I get so bad that I lose my job and then have no insurance? I should mention that I have Anthem BC/BS and I pay 12k out of pocket each year for insurance for me and my wife. I don't know that I have ever been so low in my life and hope isn't my strong suit right now. I don't want to get hooked on legal pain meds and kill my liver at the same time.   So I beg you good people at Reddit, what can I do? Do I need to call a lawyer, am I screwed, should I call my state insurance commissioner? Any advice could literally be life altering. Thank you in advance...  Edit: I called a lawyer and we going to have a discussion regarding a bad faith claim but I really don't want to have to go that route and pay that huge expense if I don't have to...   Did some formatting to help read more easily. What is the reason the insurance company gave you for denial? How far out was the surgery scheduled after the specialist appointment?"
Insurance,3bt1tz,FearStalksTheLand,3,Thu Jul 2 04:20:38 2015 UTC,"I met all but ONE of the criteria that Anthem has for this type of surgery.

Maybe they can find a sucker someone willing to roll the dice on you.
Insurance,3brw7c,key2616,-4,Wed Jul 1 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"Super unhelpful. I am aware that few companies are willing to insure me, I'm just trying to find one that will."
Insurance,3brw7c,key2616,2,Thu Jul 2 12:56:21 2015 UTC,And yet I gave you a very direct way to find a solution to your problem in finding the largest local personal lines agency and asking them. Sorry that it was couched in language to make you feel like the special snowflake you obviously are.
Insurance,3brw7c,PA-Agent-Broker,3,Thu Jul 2 13:41:42 2015 UTC,"Non standard companies will do it. Talk to Progressive. Don't go directly, go with an agent."
Insurance,3brw7c,booklover13,3,Thu Jul 2 01:47:22 2015 UTC,Even temporary insurance would do for the time being(I have to bring my car home from the sellers house).   If you really need to get it from the seller's house while sorting this out call the local tow company. You can pay them to move the vehicle to where you plan on storing it while you sort this all out.    I need the vehicle for practice as I can't afford driving lessons and my friends don't feel comfortable having me practice in their cars.   Talk to your local senior center and see if there is anyone who would be willing to let drive them around in exchange for help doing their errands.

Insurance,3brw7c,coatedkhan,0,Mon Jul 13 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"From my understanding you are 20 (above 18 years old) and have your learners permit? In some states, CA at least, (Not sure about your location)  if you are 18+ you do not have to have your learners permit ( no behind wheel training either) for 6 months or whatever it is you can go straight for the drivers license if you are confident enough. It is 5 am and I haven't slept so feel free to call me out on inaccurate info. :)  Edit: Still no sleep, but I do believe you need to show proof of insurance when taking the behind the wheel test though...could you use a family or friend vehicle with proof of insurance to take said test and then you have a license to present to the insurance company?"
Insurance,3brrv1,halcyononononon,2,Wed Jul 1 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"1) Not a lawyer, but from an insurance perspective, everything sounds kosher.  2) The insurer has a duty to indemnity their insured (the current homeowners).  Indemnity can come in several forms, of which, physically replacing the carpet is only one.  Another option is to accept a check for the estimated amount to return the house to it's previous condition.  Given that you have a contract for the house in its pre-loss condition, the current homeowners should pass the check on to you.  It would normally be the seller's choice, but since you are so close to closing, it would be in their best interest to let you choose.  3) I don;t believe that insurers need proof unless you are making a claim for contents at replacement cost.  Carpeting is not considered ""contents"" in most cases, so you should not have to provide proof.  4) This is an interesting twist.  By all rights, they are the insured under their homeowners insurance contract; however, if they still have a mortgage, their bank would also be a loss payee.  Your real estate agent or lawyer shouldn't really have too much trouble getting it in any case."
Insurance,3brrv1,GreatDeku,3,Wed Jul 1 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much. One thing I forgot to ask is if we are required to have the repairs estimated by a contractor (which both real estate agents are now telling us to do), or if we can just accept the insurance company's estimate.   I don't think contractors would be interested in producing an estimate and then not doing the work (would they?). And I don't want to feel rushed into choosing a contractor for our hardwood flooring project. Hope that makes sense."
Insurance,3brrv1,britt5689,3,Wed Jul 1 18:12:01 2015 UTC,"Sure you can get estimates, but you don't have to. The insurance company will send out an adjustor that will estimate the total cost of repairs minus their deductible."
Insurance,3brrv1,GreatDeku,2,Wed Jul 1 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"Also on that note, OP should also be able to collect a cheque for the deductible from the sellers in the very likely case that they don't fix it prior to settlement."
Insurance,3brrv1,mrm1776,3,Wed Jul 1 19:33:57 2015 UTC,I actually JUST did a claim like this. Since the seller is taking a loss of $10K that would be the total limit of liability for the claim. Even if estimated damages came in at more than $10K.
Insurance,3brrv1,Zen_Drifter,2,Thu Jul 2 01:39:04 2015 UTC,"The easiest thing to do is just negotiate a reduced amount on the sale price and the homeowner just keeps the proceeds from the insurance claim.   The insurer pays all losses at ACV (depreciated value) up-front regardless of whether the homeowner has replacement cost coverage or not. The homeowner only collects the difference between ACV and the full replacement repair cost when the work is complete.  Another thing that can be done is that the homeowner assigns their rights (and duties) under their policy to you. The insurer usually has to approve this in advance. Basically you become the insured for the purposes of this claim. You are then bound by all the terms and conditions of their insurance contract when dealing with their insurer. You get paid ACV up front and the difference between that and RCV (replacement cost value) when the repairs are complete. Since you do not intend to complete the repairs you are basically doing what's called ""settling at ACV"". So it's just as easy to have the seller just sign the check over to you or you give them your own estimate and they pay you that. If you feel that the damages are worth $7,500 then you should expect $7,500 back on the sale. Whether the owner actually collected $10,000 or $15,000 or $20,000 on it shouldn't be your concern. The reason the owner is being cagey about the estimated amount is because they collected ""$XXXX and they're hoping you ask them for less than that. They then pocket the difference.   There's no fraud here because the insurer has inspected the loss and agrees with the homeowner that the damages are whatever amount that they came up with. What you and the seller come to agreement on is irrelevant and not the concern of the insurer."
Insurance,3bsada,TopWizard,5,Wed Jul 1 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"I think that you're due everything except the last two. Why do you need a ""personal assistant""?

Insurance,3brqmc,Dfather1,6,Wed Jul 1 16:48:21 2015 UTC,How accurate are those tests?   99.9% accurate.  Or 0% accurate.  Or pretty much anywhere in between depending on which source you go with.   Do insurance people typically exaggerate results to get an outcome (or whatever reason)?   I can't think of any reason they would lie to you the policyholder about this.  What's the status of your claim?  Is there any concern that the loss won't be covered?  I'm assuming you had your renters policy properly endorsed to cover such an expensive piece of jewelry.
Insurance,3brqmc,forneusFQ,2,Wed Jul 1 17:45:14 2015 UTC,Agreed. If the jewelry is covered properly you should have no concern on the outcome of the test. The only party interested in the test is the insurance company so they can legally go after her for their money back.
Insurance,3brqmc,wovi0501,2,Thu Jul 2 03:14:02 2015 UTC,"What expectations were set by the insurance company? A failed polygraph may be very predictive of guild, but not conclusive.

Insurance,3br8wo,wjtrawick,2,Wed Jul 1 14:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, in my experience, the Med Pay would cover the deductible, and then some.  It may depend on the state, but in my state, the Med Pay is payable as soon as the bill and accrued and proven, with no regard to health insurance.  They are two separate collateral sources.  Health Insurance, if it's Medicare, Medicaid, or an ERISA plan (or some other plan that get's and subrogation lien) might have a subrogation lien for the Med Pay proceeds, but only up to the amount that they paid, and if the medical bills are $10,000 with a $2,500 deductible, it's doubtful that Health Insurance would actually pay more than $5,000 anyway.    Generally, if the question is ""is Med Pay worth it"" my response is always emphatically yes.  It's relatively cheap, it's quick to recover (bc there's no liability determination, it's based on contract), and you can recover it in addition to other collateral sources (such as health insurance, liability insurance, etc.)."

We had some meetings a few weeks ago discussing the plan and everyone was supposed to either sign up or decline coverage at which point BCBS would calculate the final price for everyone. Apparently numerous people have quit since then (common in this this industry and town) and more people have come on so new meetings had to be arranged, new yea/nay forms had to be filled out and nothing has progressed.   I expressed my displeasure yesterday and they apologized. Sounds like they are aiming to have everything in place by the 15th now. Given what I've seen in my year here that may or may not happen.   Unfortunately I make too much for subsidies but also live in one of the most expensive places in the country so ""too much"" doesn't go very far. I'm going to look into the non-marketplace plan today but given what we were paying for bottom of the barrel coverage through the ACA I'm not confident we'll be able to afford it. It doesn't help that we live in the most expensive county in Florida for insurance.

Health insurance companies can start new health insurance policies at any time, it's just that you can only use the marketplace and receive it's subsidies during the official enrollment window(or if you have a qualifying life event).  Call up your company, tell them you want a new quote and a new policy just like if you were a new customer.

The wiki I linked addresses that issue too.  Or maybe the companies you checked with just don't want to write any more homeowners policies in your area so they're giving a bullshit reason for declining - that happens too.  No idea.  The bottom line is: (1) you need to check with more companies; (2) working with an agent who's familiar with and has access to a few or a dozen or a few hundred insurance companies will greatly speed up the process of finding a company that will write you."

Insurance,3bocwr,billnyethearsonguy,3,Tue Jun 30 20:52:33 2015 UTC,"If its a borderline total loss, meaning its just at or near the threshold (70%) then they will review that estimate for possibility of supplements. If it appears there will be supplements, they'll side toward total loss. If it appears that there are likely no supplements then you may be able to discuss keeping the estimate below the threshold. This would involve the shop agreeing to lower labor rates, using aftermarket parts if they're currently OEM or refurbished parts which cost more. From the numbers you've provided and only on that info, I would say your vehicle will probably be salvaged. You'll have the option to owner retain it and any amount you keep in the settlement you can apply towards repairs but it will be a salvaged title. Salvage titles do appear on car fax reports as total losses are reported by the insurance carriers."
Insurance,3bocwr,aprillian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:25:35 2015 UTC,supplements   What are supplements?  Do you think there's any point in fixing a car that requires so much fixing?  Thank you for your reply!!
Insurance,3bocwr,aprillian,3,Wed Jul 1 00:42:40 2015 UTC,"Supplements are the additional damages. For example, car comes in with bumper damage. Shop writes a preliminary estimate for $1000. Repairs start and the shop does a tear down (takes off the outer panels of the damaged area) and they now can see the full extent of damage and write up the supplement (secondary estimate) for the additional repair costs/damages.  we can usually tell when there will be supplements or if the preliminary estimate got the majority of the damages. If your preliminary estimate is over $8k, I would be willing to guess there's hidden damage and will be supplements."
Insurance,3bocwr,aprillian,2,Wed Jul 1 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"Oh and to answer the other question - its your preference. some people really love their cars and will pay out of pocket for the repairs at any cost. What I advise to keep in mind is the following... And all the numbers are pulled at random to give the example. Car is totaled. Settlement offer = 9k. 5k goes to pay off the loan. you get 4k. You now have 4k to pay for the repairs that are over 4k and that's before any possible supps plus the fact that when you shell out the remaining $$ for repairs, you will have a salvaged title vehicle. Sometimes hard to insure. If you don't have a loan, the whole settlement goes to you but again you will have to pay any repair costs out of pocket that exceeds your settlement and will keep the salvage title. On the flip side, If you don't keep the vehicle, you get the higher settlement but now have no vehicle and will have to figure out how to purchase a new one with the amt paid to you. Sorry for the rambling but I hope gives you an idea of the big picture afterwards."

Insurance,3bocwr,ttho10,2,Wed Jul 1 01:50:18 2015 UTC,"IMO, it will probably total out. If it's that close, you'll probably just want it totaled out anyways, as supplements will push it over lots of times. I wouldn't bother retaining and paying additional out of pocket, as it's not financially wise, unless you want to take a hit on quality/parts, or do the work yourself. I'm not sure in WA, but you may not even have an option to retain a total loss. Chances are, if the insurance company deems it a total, they won't negotiate a price w/the repair facility. If repairs total $9500, the repairs are $9500.   When I was an adjuster, I've been burned by shops saying ""oh, don't worry, this is the final estimate, there's no chance of a supplement"". Oh course, 25 days later, they're close to finishing the job, and then send in a $2000 supplement for necessary parts. Take the $$$ and get a replacement, especially if you are crossing boarders into Canada. I have no idea what their stance is on importing salvage vehicles."

Insurance,3bnl9j,Cicatrized,4,Tue Jun 30 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"In my state you're bound for 30 days if you have an existing policy, so I'd say OP should be in the clear with this accident in regards to the at-fault driver having coverage on the new vehicle."
Insurance,3bnl9j,eddie2911,5,Tue Jun 30 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"They should have automatic coverage. Most states automatically cover a new vehicle for 21-30 days if you have an existing active policy. Progressive will cover this as long as it hasn't been more than 21-30 days depending on the state. If you have a first and last name, and a home address, they can start a claims process for you."
Insurance,3bnl9j,britt5689,2,Tue Jun 30 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"You can call progressive and attempt to file the claim. They are able to search for policies with people's contact information. They will file the claim and contact their insured. If the vehicle was in the covered loss time (standard is 30 days) then the claim will be covered under the highest coverage they carry. This means if they have more than one vehicle on the policy, whichever has the highest or most coverages will be applied to the new vehicle. if they are not covered, they will deny the claim. This means you will need to go through your own policy for repairs given you carry collision coverage. Depending on the state and your coverages, you can use uninsured motorists property damage coverage. Umpd carries a lower deductible and in some states has a 0 deductible."

Insurance,3bpa5w,powerfulsquid,2,Wed Jul 1 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"The reason you're being asked all these questions is because under the physical damage coverage extended under the uninsured motorist coverage as part of hit-and-run accidents, there is an inherent incentive for somebody to say that they were involved in a hit-and-run: the deductible is lower. That is why there is a certain threshold of evidence that must be met before qualifying for UMPD coverage, and each claim is handled on its own merits as far as what that threshold is. You have nothing to hide, you are not lying, so the best thing to do is to just follow the lead and answer all the questions and cooperate. IF you get defensive, it may create the perception there's something you may be untruthful about, which will only prompt the rep to ask more probing questions."

Insurance,3bpa5w,gunjr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:30:52 2015 UTC,"Depending on your state, the February claim could be looked at as uninsured motorist property damage. You most liekly have a $250 deductible for UMPD claims. Your claim will be processed as a comprehensive loss if virtually anything other than a car hit your car. Check your policy for your comp deductible. You just submitted two claims which will cause concern for most carriers due to frequency but I doubt it will be denied."

Healthcare.gov, due to a loss of coverage, is the most logical option at this point for newer coverage. Other insurers may be willing to other individual coverage through their private exchanges due to this loss of coverage.  I know you're on your parents' plan, but if your company offers coverage, that could be an option in the future for the two of you, but it may make more financial sense to have him find his own for now.  I would see if a broker would be able to provide specific plan assistance. They're a strong resource for more specific information and can adjust to individual situations. Not sure how many resources are out there for solo enrolees but there's gotta be some market with the exchange being as prevalent as it is.

Insurance,3bn4cc,TiedinHistory,2,Tue Jun 30 20:15:14 2015 UTC,"FWIW, generally, participating providers are responsible for the cost. For instance, you would not be on the hook for the cost as they are participating with AETNA if the provider refuses to submit the claim in a proper manner. For the insurer I work for, providers contrated with the primary and/or secondary carrier cannot balance bill members other than the cost share remaining after secondary reimbursement.  A more extreme alternative is that you could ask for the claim information and submit a claim yourself to United. You would want the same info that was submitted to AETNA, but it would at least process it through and then you could use that EOB."

I suppose I could get this from Aetna, since they already have this on file in the pending status. However, I don't know the first thing about medical billing/coding, so there's a high probability I would mess something up if it's more than just a name/number/address/date/etc. And I would essentially be doing the billing company's job for them, which is kind of annoying.  Is it worth it, in your opinion, to go through those steps and have the peace of mind knowing it's done? Or is it safe to ignore this for the time being, after all the un-returned phone calls?"

Disputed facts of loss doesn't mean 50-50, although 50% of damages is better than 0. In this case it would be 100% either or, and like you said, in the absence of an independent witness, each driver will have to pursue their own insurance and never see their deductible back. Accepting 50% may actually make that claim as a surchargeable loss on the policy since there is negligence involved, which is a bad deal for the policyholder."

The 3k she's paying in annual premiums beats out the 2k provided by the company and is a lot less limited. HRAs are nice but not amazing with less flexibility and funding options than an HSA.

I'm not really sure what details could swing it. It's really a cost benefit analysis. I'd keep an eye on what her deductible turns out to be and how the coordination of benefits goes into effect: she'd be primary on her own, but what about the children?

Insurance,3blais,sciencewasright,3,Tue Jun 30 03:35:25 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, why do you need to maintain coverage? Your insurance company should only care about what coverage you had at the time of the loss, not what coverage you continue to have."
Insurance,3blais,Cicatrized,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:44:04 2015 UTC,"I assume you have a good reason to do this, although I can't figure that out for the life of me.  But to answer your question, just put comprehensive coverage on the car with no liability coverage.  If you get this one fixed or get a new one, you'll have to change that, but that should solve your problem - which may or may not exist."
Insurance,3blais,key2616,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"If this is your only policy and you want to keep it active I'd just reduce the coverages to the state minimum liability (which appears to be 20/40/10 in Michigan), or whatever the lowest limits are that your company will sell you, and leave it at that until your case is resolved. ""Storage"" coverage may have the same effect.  You probably can't reduce it to ""just comprehensive"" as an insurer is unlikely to underwrite any sort of physical damage coverage on an unrepaired & totaled car.   Depending on the rules in your state you may be right about the lapse causing difficulty with insurability when you go back to driving. Also, removing liability coverage can get your registration cancelled/suspended in some states. This also serves to protect you from laws regarding junk/unregistered cars sitting in driveways as the registration is still active."
Insurance,3bkn8b,NinjaPenguin893,2,Tue Jun 30 00:17:40 2015 UTC,"The insurance shouldn't be an issue.  The first step is to get a contract from the venue that spells out exactly which coverages are required.  Several insurance companies have developed catering policies that combine a lot of the commonly required coverages together, but these could be more or less than he needs depending on what all he's planning to do and what the venue requires.  The required licenses & permits might be more of a challenge.  It varies by state, but at a minimum it will probably require an exam or exams and hundreds of dollars in fees (probably not more than ~$1,000, for example in TX the fees are $250-$750).  That's just for the food, if he's planning on bartending, that's a whole separate set of licenses/permits and insurance coverages.  I don't see any reason why he'd have to incorporate himself or register a DBA, but the contract with the venue and license & permit requirements may also dictate that."

Another thing is to look into what is called a term layer plan. You would by a few different term life plans at varying lengths (i.e 10,15,25) this would then give you the ability to stack the amounts and have them drop off at different times. Picking the correct company would even give you a break on pricing and could even reduce the policy fees. Very simple plan to create.

I wish there were more travel insurance questions so I could feel more useful here.      (I work in travel underwriting)    So, a couple of things:     I'm assuming that you have a dedicated travel insurance policy, and you're not referring to your homeowner's/renter's policy.   Most travel insurance plans will have an exclusion for cash that was stolen.    Most plans will also have a sub-limit on electronics, which may or may not be near the total limit of your baggage/personal effects coverage.    If you have the police report and receipts, you're in good shape regarding a claim. The whole ""unattended"" bit is really hard to uphold in a claim, and unless it's a very, very clear case of neglect on your part they won't pursue it.    I worked as an adjuster in travel in the past, so from the point of view, just be sure to put a good claim packet together. Make a nice list with numbered exhibits, include a detailed written explanation, and include everything to corroborate the claim -- police report, receipts, travel itinerary, etc.      I hope this helps!

Insurance,3bdcfm,dutchesse,3,Sun Jun 28 14:03:21 2015 UTC,"On the image you listed here, it specifically states ""Network care,"" meaning these are the benefits strictly for in-network services.  If you went out of network, you are going to be responsible for the amount that they are charging you. The reason for that being is because the insurance company does not have a contract with that provider, and therefore, little or no (depending on if you even have out of network benefits) benefit will be given.  I know this sucks to hear, but it is member (meaning, yours) responsibility to make sure any services you have done are with an in-network provider before they are done. This means, before you go to the doctor's office, you have to check with the insurance company to make sure they are still in network every time.  Now, most of the time, they are still going to be in network if they originally were, but if you really want to cover your ass and make sure you don't get screwed, this is how to avoid this."

If you have the listing that says they're in-network, call your insurer to get more information on the denial and why the provider is listed as participating on their website.

Insurance,3bcxsd,halfanapplepie,3,Sun Jun 28 02:02:14 2015 UTC,"It's highly unlikely that there is any avenue of recovery against the drunk car thief. He's still liable for the damages, so you can sue and get a verdict and try to collect, but it's unlikely that his (or the car owner's) insurance covers it. You'll probably have to pursue him yourself.  With regards to the vehicle owner, the owner of a stolen car likely won't have any liability for your damages because you're not liable for the actions of somebody who stole your car.  An exception to this might be if the car wasn't really stolen, but instead ""stolen"", meaning the owner is claiming theft but it's really ""non-explicitly-permissive use"". Like the owner knew the thief, the thief was at the same party, the owner didn't secure the keys, the thief took the car, the owner knew the thief took the car, and the owner didn't claim the car was ""stolen"" until after they learned about the accident. At that point they could can be treading into the legal area of negligent entrustment depending on how the drunk thief actually came to be in possession of the car.  Since ~ 1998 almost every car sold in the US has a chipped/RFID key so they're functionally impossible to steal without the key. What you want to know is the path by which the thief got the key. This may affect whether the vehicle owner may hold any liability.  If the thief is a stranger to the owner and the vehicle was forcibly taken, or the ignition was mechanically defeated, then there's probably no potential for liability on the vehicle owner."

The leaky shower pan would not be considered ""damaged"". It's presumably either worn-out or defective (or defectively installed).  Other examples:   When you have a leak in a pipe the insurer pays to cut out the drywall to access the pipe and they pay for all the resulting water damage. They don't pay for the actual repair to the pipe. When your pipe freezes and bursts the insurer does pay to repair the pipe because the cause of the loss was freezing, which is a covered peril. Wear and tear in the example above is not a covered peril.  When your roof leaks because it's old the insurer pays for the resulting water damage but they do not buy you a new roof. That's on you. The roof wasn't damaged by a covered cause of loss. The cause of the loss would be wear and tear. When the wind blows shingles off your roof, and the roof leaks, then the insurer does buy you a new roof because the cause of the loss is wind/windstorm, which is a covered peril.   So in your case the shower pan itself would only be covered if it was damaged by a covered cause of loss.   Homeowner policies will either be ""named peril"" or ""all risk"".  ""Named peril"" means there is a list of causes of loss in the ""Dwelling"" section of your policy that are covered, like fire, wind, water coming from the plumbing system of the house, vandalism, vehicles, etc.. and only those causes are covered.  ""All Risk"" means anything and everything that happens to your property is covered except for the specific causes listed under the ""Exclusions"" section. Common exclusions are flood, earthquake, wear and tear, defective workmanship, nuclear weapons, war, actions by the government, damage by domestic animals, and damage you did intentionally.  It's pretty hard to think of any way your shower pan would be covered. Maybe you become a fitness nut and for whatever reason you decide to work-out with weights while taking a shower. The curling bar slips out of your hands and the weights fall to the floor and smash the shower pan and it leaks. Falling objects are a covered peril so in that ridiculous example the pan would be covered.  Whether the warranty would arguably cover it depends on what exactly the warranty says in the text."
Insurance,3bbpgz,expyrian,2,Sat Jun 27 19:51:11 2015 UTC,"Falling objects   I just got my P&C producer license about a month ago, so my knowledge is very limited, but it was my understanding that falling objects only include objects falling from the outside to the inside. I remember my instructor making a similar example of a household item falling in the house causing damage and it not being covered."
Insurance,3bbpgz,expyrian,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:43:14 2015 UTC,"You are half right. In most cases damage from falling objects to personal property must originate outside.

Insurance,3b90us,aprillian,3,Fri Jun 26 23:44:45 2015 UTC,"If you make a change to your policy and then use that coverage within the first month of changing it, it will raise a red flag to your company. Each has a different time frame they look at. I say month as a broad generalization. When you change  the coverage, most will want to verify there have been no prior losses to the vehicle and may ask for photos as proof that there's no existing damage. If you successfully change the coverage and then a second hail storm occurs, you could file the claim. Chances are it will be covered and they wouldn't be able to differentiate the old damage from the new. That being said, appraisers have a trained eye and if there was a significant amount of time between hail storms, they will be able to tell that there is old damage due to things like rust spots where the old damage chipped the paint, faded areas around the prior chips/dents etc. Keep in mind, doing this is technically insurance fraud."
Insurance,3b90us,thelurkerabides,5,Sat Jun 27 01:26:11 2015 UTC,$2K deductible for comp? I'm guessing it was a lender requirement.
Insurance,3b90us,Anedia,2,Sat Jun 27 00:35:55 2015 UTC,"Your comp coverage would apply, and you would be responsible for the $2000 of the repairs because of your deductible."
Insurance,3b90us,MrFoolsDay,2,Sat Jun 27 00:07:11 2015 UTC,"1) You can cash settle for the damage, speak with the claim handler. They will pay 2000 less than the full estimate, but you won't need to pay your deductilbe until you want it repaired  (if you do). 2) This is Insurance Fraud, do not do this. This is VERY illegal."
Insurance,3b90us,black-house-red-door,2,Sat Jun 27 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"I've been through two very large vehicle hail claims. Unless your car has very little hail damage, the repairs will almost certainly be well above your $2,000 deductible (which seems high, but hey, whatever you want to do. Maybe consider lowering it sometime in the future after all this is settled). You'll get a check for the full repair cost minus your deductible amount. This may differ by state, but in my state (Texas), if your vehicle has a lien, this check will be payable jointly to either you and your lender or you and the body shop performing the repairs. If this applies to you and you go through the claims process, go the route of the body shop rather than the lender (some lenders will simply take the check and apply it to your loan principle automatically, and you get to drive a hail damaged car around).    If you think the damage might be below your deductible threshold you can get some independent quotes and have the vehicle fixed without involving a claim. But chances are, unless there's only minor damage to one or two panels (excluding the roof) you're looking at potentially many thousands in repairs (my two vehicles had combined damage of over $30,000 from one hail storm, FYI)."

But what you have to remember is that the other insurance company is acting in good faith, to their own insured. They don't owe you thesame duty they owe their insured.  Let's flip the scenario you were involved in an accident, then something beig came up or you left for vacation the next day. And after 2 weeks your insurance company said oh well lets hold them at fault since we can't get ahold of them. Tin wouldn't be fairto you without even getting your side.   As far as them always waiting to hold their insured not at fault, if the details clearly show them to be at fault they will hold them at fault. Just go through your own insurance then let the insurance company handle it."
Insurance,3b9m7w,Phil_Achio,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:17:54 2015 UTC,"Two weeks is nothing. Insurance owes their policyholders reasonable time to get ahold of them and discuss a loss. Reasonable for you is not reasonable for them however. After two weeks, they're probably sending correspondence by mail now and those letters have 14-30 day response time allowed for their policyholder before they send out a final letter advising of non cooperation between the policyholder and the company. That final letter gives an additional month Depending on the company for the policyholder to contact them. Until they discuss the loss with their policyholder, they will not make a liability call. Your insurance will cover your damages if you have collision coverage. Yes, you will pay your deductible but they will then be responsible for recovering their funds from the other party. If you are in a rental due to your vehicle being un-drivable but you are delaying the repair/claim process by waiting for the other insurance company to accept liability. Know this, they won't reimburse in full for your rental. Best to go through your insurance and let them handle the rest."

If you have collision coverage, you can start repairs to your vehicle while your insurance sorts the rest out, and you can stop reading here. You'll owe a deductible and you might not get it back.   You have enough information on the other driver for your company to pursue them for collections and handle this as an uninsured motorist (if you have umpd). The deductible will probably be lower than collision, and if collections are successful, you'll get your deductible back.

Your insurance should be able to find her insurance information through this. If she does not cooperate with her insurance or they are unable to find insurance for her, they can subrogate her directly which is essentially sending her into collection. That being said, based off the minimal info in your loss description above, you will most likely be held partially at fault for this loss."

Unfortunately, insurance may say: you should have slowed and or stopped when you saw her turn to prevent from broad siding her. Regardless of why she turned or how quickly she did so, you were unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Not saying you will be put majority at fault. There is the chance that you will be 0% at fault. But it's likely that you will be found partially at fault. Particularly with her insurance company. If yours says no fault, hers may dispute it and the two companies will agree on the shared liability. My guess would be something like 20/80. 20 being your fault and 80 being hers."
Insurance,3b7fww,thefutureofamerica,4,Fri Jun 26 16:07:09 2015 UTC,"Check with your employer to see if they offer life insurance with guaranteed issues as one of your benefits.  Many employers will automatically pay for a set amount of life insurance (typically one year salary) that you get regardless of health issues.  Employees can then elect to get more coverage during open enrollment. Many times there will be guaranteed issue up to a certain amount like 50k or 100k for example.  Guaranteed issue means you can be insured regardless of health, no physical necessary. Any coverage over the guarantee issue amount would require a physical. The cost of guarantee issue would likely be less than what you would get from an individual policy due to your lower rating.  You could get both policies if available in order to have enough coverage and save some money on premiums."
Insurance,3b7fww,Toltec123,2,Fri Jun 26 19:03:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest hit you're getting is that you were diagnosed at age 14.  The younger you are when you're diagnosed (despite control), you get hit.    You'll get the best rate with your DM if you have a good a1c, low blood pressure, not overweight, and good lipids.    Maybe tell your agent that you're looking for Standard instead of Preferred.  You will not get Preferred with DM. Period."
Insurance,3b7fww,J_for_Jules,2,Fri Jun 26 16:38:59 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what you mean by standard vs. preferred - can you explain?  My a1c, blood pressure, weight, and lipids are all excellent. Can I challenge the underwriter to a bike race and if I win they have to give me a lower rate, maybe?  Edit: I didn't get a statement from the agent about what my rate class was, he just told me the 'preferred' rate vs. my rate."
Insurance,3b7fww,J_for_Jules,3,Fri Jun 26 16:53:53 2015 UTC,"The agent will always quote you Preferred because it's the least expensive, and will entice most people to apply.    Preferred is your super healthy group with no impairments or family hx of disease.  Clean living.    Standard is what would be considered 'normal.'  You may be a little overweight or have high blood pressure.  Nothing too bad, but not in that Preferred criteria.  Standard is considered 100% risk (Preferred would be less than 100%)  You've obviously been put in the substandard class due to your DM.  Each company has different ratings for impairments to get to your cost for insurance.  Substandard is greater than 100% risk and the pricing blocks are usually in increments of 25%.  So if we say Preferred is essentially 75% risk, then a substandard rate of 150% would be 2x Preferred (75% x 2).    If you were 3x Preferred, my guess would be you're around 225%.    I just ran your info through my system and applied assumed credits for bp, lipids, etc and I'm coming up with 220%, or about 3x Preferred.  However, I'm generally not supposed to apply credits if you've had DM for over 15yrs, but exceptions are made.  Like I said before, being dx'd at age 14 is what's hurting you regardless of current health.  It's just the way it works based on study after study."

It's good to know that perhaps there is some room for negotiation or for getting a better rating through a different insurer. It's just the one quote I have so far, but I've got a meeting coming up with an FA and broker so hopefully we can do better.  What I think is really frustrating for diabetics today is that the treatments available to us are sooooooo much better than what was available 20+ years ago. We are surviving longer and in better health, but the actuarial tables take a long time to reflect that."
Insurance,3b7fww,MuffinMopper,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a type 1 as well.  The reason its 3x higher is probably because models show diabetics are 3x (or however the financial calculations work out) as likely to die in the life of the contract as a non-diabetic.    Usually those life insurance contracts are 10 years.  Although I think type 1 diabetes only takes like 10 years off your life, it might still make you much more likely to die between the ages of 32 and 42.  For example, a normal man has a 1.5% chance of dying during that period, whereas a diabetic has a 4.5% chance.   You might try shopping around for a better rate though.  Different insurers might model diabetes in different ways.  For example, if you are a diabetic with good control, your chances of death are much lower than someone with kidney disease and foot ulcers.  However, the models of some insurers might lump you into the same group.  Other insurers might have a more fine tuned model that takes things like A1C numbers into account.    Anyways, if you find a insurer that works for you post it for me.  I'm a bit younger than you, but will probably want life insurance at some point.  Also, you might try posting this on /r/diabetes.  I'm sure the other diabetics on there have run into similar problems."

I think what I'm learning is that the models are far less sophisticated than one might imagine, with only a limited number of rate 'classes' as opposed to really fine-tuned rates, and there's a significant judgement call at times about which category an individual falls into. Perhaps it's a good business opportunity for somebody."

It's unfortunate for people with good, documented control.  Type 2 gets more breaks than Type 1 since 1 is insulin dependent.  I've seen people with amputations and foot ulcers.

Insurance,3b8959,northofindy,2,Mon Jun 29 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"So a few things I want to weigh in on...  First of all, $235 is incredibly cheap. You're not just paying for a new cover, you're paying for the tear down, assembly, paint, and labor that go along with the new part.  Second, she has the right to pursue the damages through insurance where she has the right to choose any shop for the repairs. She also has the right to pocket the money paid out to her for her damages.    Similarly to the last point, if she's agreeing to settle this outside of insurance, come to an agreed price on repair costs, have her sign off on it that you have indemnified her and you owe her no more than the agreed price and keep everything documented. You don't need to know if she did in fact repair her car or if she took it to a cheaper shop and kept the difference. You're saving yourself money by paying what she wants, having her sign and then if she tries to take you to claims court or file on your insurance - you will have the proof that you settled it."

For instance my fiance was in the same position she had her license expires and jus left it that way for I think 3 years too. Went through the process to get her g2, and hweres where the luck comes in cause when our insurance company pulled her driving history they gave her credit for when she first got the licensed.   Nand to back that up Ia friend of mine was insured with a company let it expire and got it back. He went back to said companyafter getting his license again and he was credited with original license date again. I'd recommend a big direct writer like desjardins they have more lax agents when it comes to this."
Insurance,3b7c8n,Phil_Achio,2,Sun Jun 28 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"They will credit it to the original date. However, you may be rated as a newly insured driver instead of a newly licensed driver. Having a gap in your insurance will effect premiums for sure."
Insurance,3b6jno,ma-ccc-slp,5,Fri Jun 26 11:16:35 2015 UTC,"Full tort allows you to recover pain and suffering for an injury stemming from an MVA you are not at fault for. Limited tort requires that the injury be ""... permanent, disfiguring, and/or severe..."" to be able to recover pain and suffering monies. Both would allow you recover hard monies (lost time from work, out of pocket expenses) but only full tort would always allow you the right to go after (not guarantee you) soft money such as pain & suffering."
Insurance,3b6jno,izznt,2,Fri Jun 26 13:20:05 2015 UTC,Limited Tort does not allow you to recover damages for pain and suffering.
Insurance,3b6jno,superhubris,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:03:47 2015 UTC,"Your agent should have explained to you the difference, but here are some links. http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=75&div=0&chpt=17&sctn=5&subsctn=0  Exceptions to when you can still sue for pain and suffering under limited tort: http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=26718"
Insurance,3b4mmf,black-house-red-door,13,Thu Jun 25 22:48:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about it too much. If he does file a claim against your insurance they will have his vehicle inspected and want to inspect your vehicle as well. They will be able to tell from the damage on his car does not match up to his story and they are trained to tell new damage compared to old damage that has been there awhile.   On the upside if he continues to try to press on to them that you  backed into him and they show no evidence to support it they can pursue insurance fraud on him. I had a client a few weeks ago where the damage was clear that he hit a pole, but he is insisting a big truck hit him. The damage to his car doesn't line up with the story and now they have a special investigation unit looking into him. Insurance companies take fraud very seriously."
Insurance,3b4mmf,cauthiel,7,Thu Jun 25 23:21:21 2015 UTC,"Those are always fun.   ""Look, I'm not saying I don't believe you, but I'm going to need a second set of eyes to look at this. Are you sure you were hit by a truck?""  ""Yes, I never lie.""  {internally} God damn it."
Insurance,3b4mmf,FunandFailure,4,Fri Jun 26 16:13:07 2015 UTC,Excellent! Thanks very much :)
Insurance,3b4mmf,aprillian,3,Thu Jun 25 23:33:10 2015 UTC,"Take pictures of your vehicle in case he does file a claim, you can provide them to your insurance as proof of no damage. Likely, they'll send someone out to inspect and verify no damages to your vehicle if it comes to that but safe to take some pics yourself. If he files the claim and you advise against what he says, it will be considered word v word. If his car has significant prior damage, it will be flagged as fraud and both companies will do further investigation to see if he's tapped other vehicles before and then turned around and claimed that the other person is at fault."
Insurance,3b4mmf,britt5689,3,Fri Jun 26 00:30:06 2015 UTC,"Well seeing as your vehicle has no damage, and his has extensive damage, the stories aren't going to line up. If you really did reverse into him, and caused him that much damage, your bumper would be totally wrecked. Let your insurance handle it, they're trained to spot new vs. old damage and will call him on his bullshit."
Insurance,3b4mmf,Swanksterino,2,Fri Jun 26 14:19:49 2015 UTC,"This was my thinking as well. The guy was jiggling his hood acting like the hood wouldn't close and it looked bent (towards the middle). If an alleged ~0.5mph tap is enough to destroy an entire hood/bumper assembly, I don't want to live in this world anymore. I don't know much about insurance claims processes but I do know cars, and this guy was nuts."
Insurance,3b4mmf,Swanksterino,3,Fri Jun 26 15:09:45 2015 UTC,"Rear ending anyone is automatically at fault. Always, the logic is in you situation, he should have left more room between you. Like if you come up to a car with standard transmission, going uphill, make sure you leave them enough room to roll back a bit in neutral, or bang, your at fault."
Insurance,3b4mmf,Swanksterino,2,Fri Jun 26 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"Ok 'gotcha man'. I'm sure there might be some extremely rare circumstances, but that does not address OPS anecdote, which is fairly typical, and common circumstance. You are hair splitting, which is not a valid contribution.  http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-fault-automatic-rear-end-car-accident-case.html  The rule even applies to pile ups on the freeway. When the people in the middle of the pile up clearly had nothing to do with the accident, their insurance still covers the vehicle ahead.  So yeah, during the Eclipse, on the fourth of July, while Haley's comet is overhead one may be not at fault, 99/100 times you are. And the other driver is in this scenario.  Nice non sequitor though.  I will assume you are younger, like to contradict, and are referring to one of your RC cars."
Insurance,3b4mmf,Swanksterino,2,Fri Jun 26 18:09:13 2015 UTC,Dude. Like I say. How does this apply to OPs scenario? No fault means your insurance covered your damages. This is sort of a meaningless contribution.
Insurance,3b4mmf,Swanksterino,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:26:05 2015 UTC,Did you not read the exception of a no fault state? Which only applies to civil liability?

Insurance,3b4mmf,Swanksterino,3,Fri Jun 26 18:43:53 2015 UTC,"Almost always. Who are you? Matlock? If you hadn't been in a no fault state, you would have been considered at fault.  Again, your contribution has nothing to do with OP'S question, and your response reveals a limited understanding of insurance laws and language."

I'd always ""heard"" this was (almost always) the case but wasn't sure what the law really said. Looks like if my rear bumper came into contact with his front bumper (regardless of how he says this event transpired) he either rear-ended me (his fault) or was following too close (still his fault)."
Insurance,3b4mmf,Zen_Drifter,2,Fri Jun 26 18:48:09 2015 UTC,"Plus, at fault or no, he should've exchanged insurance info. Hope a pic of his license plate was involved."

Insurance,3b5h5d,shibafku,3,Fri Jun 26 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, many AAA branches are basically just insurance brokerages.  The only service that AAA sells and services themself is their roadside service, but they broker many other services from within their offices like insurance and travel agencies.  Your local AAA office would act as your point of contact/broker in dealing with these various insurance companies but ultimately you would have insurance through someone else (and possibly multiple other companies if you have multiple lines of insurance that you need)"
Insurance,3b5h5d,joeboo5150,2,Fri Jun 26 05:54:52 2015 UTC,Does that mean I should just go with the cheapest one since AAA would be dealing with them? Is that how an insurance brokerage works? I'm just concerned about going through a less well known company might bite me in the ass in case something goes wrong. I was just wondering would going through AAA mitigate that risk.
Insurance,3b5h5d,halfanapplepie,2,Fri Jun 26 06:16:57 2015 UTC,AAA Insurance is just like other insurance companies. Especially in the west where they're a little more known for insurance.
Insurance,3b5h5d,britt5689,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:16:40 2015 UTC,Do typical insurance companies resell? I thought typical companies like GEICO etc sell their own insurance.
Insurance,3b5h5d,britt5689,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:22:13 2015 UTC,"You're confused. AAA DOES sell auto/home/renters insurance, but usually it's through an independent agent. Those AAA offices are more like a travel agency. Contact a local independent agent that sells AAA insurance."
Insurance,3b5h5d,britt5689,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:16:12 2015 UTC,"How do I find one of those? This is pretty confusing because I went through the AAA website and they forwarded me to an agent that resells other insurances.  I'm looking at the WA site http://www.aaawa.com/insurance/ and they claim they only do reselling, so that leads me to think AAA insurance doesn't exist in WA.  This then brings me to my original question: AAA insurance vs AAA resold insurance."
Insurance,3b5h5d,halfanapplepie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:19:44 2015 UTC,"That is for a AAA club, aka a travel agency. I'm kind of confused by what you mean by ""resold"" insurance. Google  your city, and state, plus the words independent agent and you should get a decent list of agents to call. Independent agents represent more than one company, for example, I'm an independent agent in Ohio and I represent AAA, Allstate, Safeco, Allied, Progressive, Donegal, and a few others. That means I can quote you through numerous companies, and find the best rates for your particular needs. Hopefully that makes a bit more sense to you."
Insurance,3b5h5d,britt5689,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:29:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply and I see! That makes a lot more sense.  My main worry, however, is when I make a claim in the case that I need to. Some insurance companies seem to be harder to deal with. I was wondering if going through an independent agent would make the process easier as they (the agent) would help you make the claim process much smoother."

Insurance,3b43e3,Wtfitzchris,10,Thu Jun 25 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"Because your policy might have coverage.   You are a resident relative to your brother.   A quick read through of one of my policies would appear to afford coverage given the scenario.  By paying the claim, if it is owed, your insurance is doing the right thing based on the policy language.   I know it doesn't seem like your policy should come into play, but it very well might.  But the attorney filed the claim, because your policy very well might provide coverage."
Insurance,3b43e3,dunno260,6,Thu Jun 25 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"The short answer is no, there's nothing you can do. Virtually all personal home and auto policies have a clause in them that essentially says ""we will settle claims made against you as we see fit"".  WOT-  You can hire your own attorney at your own expense to advise you but their hands are largely tied by the same policy language. They probably can't make the insurer do or not do anything. All they can do is look-over what the insurer (or the insurer's attorney) is doing and let you know what's what.   As other posters have stated it's simply a matter of reading what your policy actually says and them interpreting A) whether coverage applies at all, and B) whether they feel you (via your brother) holds any liability in the matter towards the injured parties.   So this leaves several ways this can go:   Your insurance coverage does not apply and it goes nowhere. Your insurance coverage does apply but they don't feel your brother is liable for the damages so they fight the claim on your behalf and win. Your insurance coverage does apply but they don't feel your brother is liable for the damages so they fight the claim on your behalf but lose. Your insurance coverage applies and they feel your brother is liable or that the risk of going to trial is too high, so they pay.   There's other ways it could go, like the jury could decide you're liable but the jurors decide the plaintiff is a dick so they only award him $1 or some nominal amount, but the above are the most likely outcomes.  So back to your situation, your brother's insurer obviously feels this situation is potentially bad enough that they are coughing-up his policy limits to get him off the hook. The story and the witness may be sketchy but what happens if they go to trial and lose an amount in excess of his policy limit is that your brother can immediately sue his own insurer for bad faith for not settling the claim against him for the policy limit when they had the chance. (presuming the plaintiff attorney offered at some point to make that deal).  So, assuming your coverage applies, your insurer is faced with the same quandry. The larger the gap is between the damages and the amount of coverage you have the easier the decision is to cave and just pay it. This is where you need to take your hands off it (mentally). There are highly experienced litigation adjusters doing claims this size. Some of them know as much or more about this specific part of tort law than some of the attorneys they are facing. They know that if they run this trial scenario ten times that they win seven times, pay out the same as they were already offering two times (but incur all the trial expense on top of that), and eat a million dollar verdict one time. Then they look at your $25 or $50k in coverage and decide whether the facts in your particular case warrant paying it or taking it to trial.  Right now this lawsuit is a freight train coming at you and your car is stuck on the tracks. If they find no available coverage then it's akin to them pushing your car off the tracks before the train arrives. If they pay, that's the equivalent of having the train engineer apply the brakes. If they don't pay then taking it to trial is the equivalent of running to the track switch. If they win the train is diverted onto a different track. If they lose it is not and, well, you get run-over in the process.  One last caveat: The plaintiff attorney is likely to determine the amount of your coverage and ask for it in a case like this. If your insurer says ""fuck off"" and goes to trial and loses then you're almost always off the hook. This is because after a huge excess verdict is made against you, that you have no ability to pay, your insurers decision not to settle the claim within your policy limits when they had the chance constitutes nearly de-facto bad faith and this opens the door for you to sue them for mishandling the claim against you.  What happens in reality is your insurer just pays the excess verdict (or appeals it if they can/want). If they do not do this then what happens next is the plaintiff attorney appears at your door with an offer. You sign a piece of paper assigning your rights to sue your own insurer over to him and he gives you a release of claims from his clients... So you can see where your insurer would not be excited about getting involved in all this over your $25k policy.  TL/DR. No. You want yourself out of this, not fighting it.   Also, the plaintiff attorney is just doing his job. His clients can conceivably sue him for malpractice if he doesn't investigate all these potential avenues for recovery."

Insurance,3b43e3,scatterbastard,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:07:24 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for taking the time to type this up.  This gives me a much better understanding of the situation and why it unfolded the way it did.  I'll be patient with the process and keep my fingers crossed that things go my way.
Insurance,3b43e3,Zen_Drifter,2,Fri Jun 26 17:39:09 2015 UTC,Normally a claim won't reach out and touch you in such an obtuse way but because the damages are so large the legal tentacles are reaching out to try to grab everybody remotely related to this.  The classic example of this is when the Station nightclub burned down in Rhode Island ten years ago. Everybody who so much as breathed on the place got sued because 100 people died. The TV station that had a reporter inside the club who made what's probably the most important fire safety video in history paid $30 million merely on the theory that the camera guy possibly slightly slowed the exit of some of the people.
Insurance,3b43e3,northofindy,6,Fri Jun 26 17:50:15 2015 UTC,Standard policies usually  extend coverage to the named insured and resident relatives.  Since  you live under the same roof your coverage will extend to your brother in many situations.
Insurance,3b43e3,joeboo5150,2,Thu Jun 25 23:26:42 2015 UTC,"If you are listed on each others policies, some states allow ""stacking"" of liability to where if your limit isn't enough on one of your policies, your additional policies can be used to attempt to reach your full amount of liability damages.  Sounds like what is happening here.  We had a customer one they got into a major accident and we had to dip into 4 of his car policies to completely cover the damages ($100,000 limit per car)"
Insurance,3b43e3,TheSlothman1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"Speaking to the witness issue, they might have retained an accident recreation expert who basically does calculations based on the facts of the accident to work out the exact chain of events. Something akin to doing a physics equation to determine that a car weighing as much as your brothers would have to be going x speed in order to do x damage. It sounds crazy but is definitely a thing that gets done sometimes and for 450k worth of injury for one person I could see it."

Insurance,3b5fdf,SoMuchMoreEagle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:10:40 2015 UTC,"Could have been a couple things. BCBS medical hardly ever covers glasses. When they do. They'll tell the patient you have $100 to use towards glasses but will only pay the provider $50. So less money for the office. Usually in the end it's always about money. There is also the case patients think their vision coverage is entirely through BCBS but only the Routine Vision exam is. The Frames, Lenses, or Contact lenses are covered with another insurance company. Usually Davis Vision. So it could have been a network issue. Where, BCBS was In-network, but Davis Vision isn't."
Insurance,3b5fbn,kevkev16,3,Fri Jun 26 02:59:20 2015 UTC,"I do all of the billing/insurance work at a chiropractic office and I always call to check benefits for the patient immediately after their first visit. If, on the off chance, their care isnt covered, we put them on a cash plan that is significantly less than what we bill insurance.   While they should have known whether they are in network with your insurance company, I will say every once in a while there is a subset of policies that have weird benefits/network requirements. It's possible this happened, but unlikely.   The only surefire way to prevent this from happening in the future, is for you to call your insurance company beforehand. Generally, though, the office should know what insurances they accept.   You can always file an appeal with the insurance company or you can ask the office if they offer a discounted cash plan. The insurance company will pay more attention to the appeal if you file it instead of the office. This doesnt totally answer all of your questions, but I hope it gives you a little insight!"
Insurance,3b5fbn,drunkenpreschooler,-1,Fri Jun 26 03:52:05 2015 UTC,"I would show them the paper with the copays (keep that at all costs though) which is what you agreed to when the services were rendered and say you would have gone to an in network chiro if they had told you the correct information.    I would not pay their $600 bill.    But drunkenpreschooler is correct.  Always check with insurance first.  I've found that providers will say ""we can take you"" even if they are not in network because they technically can take you as an out of network patient.  Not all.  Some are almost too glad to tell you they are out of network.   If you have legitimate spine problems you should probably go to a legitimate doctor though.  Too many shady chiro's IMO."
Insurance,3b5ytn,jtl216,2,Fri Jun 26 06:21:00 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about protecting yourself from a liability claim from the 3rd party then nothing. That's what you have liability insurance for. Let your insurer handle it.  If you're talking about your first party claim then you really have four choices:   Accept what you're being offered. Reject what you're being offered and try to negotiate a more favorable resolution with the other party's insurer. Reject what you're being offered and file suit against the other driver and take your case to court. Do nothing.   If you have no physical damage coverages (collision/comp) then your insurance company. agent, or claims adjuster are highly unlikely to pursue the claim on your behalf. This is true even if you have physical damage coverage if you claim is below your deductible.  There's always an exception though. If you're viewed as a particularly valuable customer because you pay a bajillion dollars in premium (because you also insure a bunch of other property through them or something), then you may get special treatment.  Also note that either insurer's opinion about your degree of liability in the matter is not binding on your physical damage claim against the other person. Even if your insurer and the other person's insurer agree that you're 50% at fault a court could still disagree and decide that you're 25% or 0% at fault (or, 100%). So, discounting the likelihood that people who do claims like your all day every day for a living are probably right, you're technically not bound by that."
Insurance,3b5ytn,Zen_Drifter,2,Fri Jun 26 13:18:33 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you for the information! Would a dispute be something that I argue after receiving written information on why they reached the conclusion that they did?"
Insurance,3b5ytn,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"You can do it at any time.   Remember that anything another person's insurer offers to you to settle an insurance claim is voluntary. They're not under any obligation to pay you anything unless a court orders them to do it. So yelling at them isn't going to help your case. You're just going to hack them off. Be polite but firm. You can just say, ""well, I'm not finding your offer to really be satisfactory so I'll probably be pursuing your insured in court... but you're free to call me back if you would like to revise your offer"", or something like that. Just remember this can also backfire because the other carrier can change their mind and offer you 25% or even 0% if they want.  So you're on your own.   You need to step back from your case and look at it from the perspective of a disinterested party (ie. a judge/juror) and ask yourself how it would come across to them. You can locate a friend who will give you an impartial opinion. Explain the claim from your perspective and then again from the way you think the other driver would explain it. Ask them what they think.  Presumably the other guys insurer is paying for the other guy's damage (I'm assuming he has collision coverage) and will then make a claim with your carrier for reimbursement or partial reimbursement. If your carrier is firm at 0% and the other carrier is firm at 50%, and the case appears to be headed to arbitration between the insurers then I presume you could ask the other carrier if they would be willing to accept whatever determination the arbitrator comes up with. Of course this has three potential outcomes. You could get 100%... or you could get 0%... or you could get something in between that may be more, or less, or the same as what you were already offered.   This is just one of the down-sides of not carrying collision coverage. You're left to fight battles like this on your own."
Insurance,3b5ytn,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"Ah. I guess I might just have to settle. Funny thing though, is that while it was a collision, there was no damage to the other vehicle. I was actually riding a motorcycle. Passenger of their vehicle opened their door in the middle of the street and just clipped my handlebar, which caused me to fall. All at about 5-10mph."

Insurance,3b4ieg,IGuessSomeLikeItHot,2,Thu Jun 25 22:14:31 2015 UTC,"If you own the car, you need to carry the insurance on it.  Keep your policy in California and add your sister as a driver/operator on your vehicle.  If you aren't transferring the title to her, she isn't going to be getting Texas tags/plates, so it needs to stay insured in your name, in California.  If its an issue of you wanting her to pay for the insurance, it's easy enough any more with every major insurance company to have the bills emailed to her, or have the money auto-withdraw from her account while she is in possession of the vehicle.  But ultimately, the owner/title holder is responsible for insuring the vehicle, you need to be the one that keeps it insured.  If she were to insure it in her name in Texas, a claim could be completely denied because she has no insurable interest in the car(she is not an owner or loss payee).  In reality, an insurance company in Texas would probably give her a policy, as few insurance agents/companies are going to ask to see the title, but why pay for a policy that ultimately might be worthless?  A policy in Texas, in her name, would be a complete waste of money, and would do nothing whatsoever to protect you in the event of an accident or injury."

Insurance,3b5406,test1qa,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"If you make a change to your policy and then use that coverage within the first month of changing it, it will raise a red flag to your company. Each has a different time frame they look at. I say month as a broad generalization. When you change the coverage, most will want to verify there have been no prior losses to the vehicle and may ask for photos as proof that there's no existing damage. If you successfully change the coverage and then a second hail storm occurs, you could file the claim. Chances are it will be covered and they wouldn't be able to differentiate the old damage from the new. That being said, appraisers have a trained eye and if there was a significant amount of time between hail storms, they will be able to tell that there is old damage due to things like rust spots where the old damage chipped the paint, faded areas around the prior chips/dents etc.  If you have already filed the claim for the first storm, you owe the deductible that you had at the time of the loss. This for you is $500. They are already aware your vehicle suffered hail damage and filing a second claim or claiming a second storm prior to having the repairs done on this vehicle will be difficult to get away with without paying your owed 500 deductible.  Keep in mind, your question is technically asking about committing insurance fraud."

Insurance,3b3cga,Yamuddah,2,Thu Jun 25 20:29:48 2015 UTC,When I worked for them in NE they did. Did you talk to the agent or just a 1-800 number?
Insurance,3b3cga,wittymeister,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:04:39 2015 UTC,I talked to my parents'  agent.

Insurance,3b3bur,frogsenjoybirds,2,Thu Jun 25 17:02:40 2015 UTC,I'm in the US but here it depends on the company. Progressive doesn't take your speed into account at all. Allstate does take it into account but it only negatively effects your rate if you go above 80 MPH. The devices they have use cell towers to send the data so they have no idea what road you're on so they cannot tell if you're speeding.   From my personal experience the biggest negative impact with Progressives' device seems to be hard braking. I currently have the full discount and that's with 0.70 hard brakes per week. If they measure hard braking make sure you leave a lot of space between you and the car in front of you.
Insurance,3b3bur,dan_232,2,Thu Jun 25 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"Huh, interesting. When I worked for Allstate last year they told us in training that speeding, time of day, and hard braking would never negatively effect your rate.  You just would not receive discounts if you were to speed,  drive later at night, or have over a certain amount of hard braking events in a given time period.  Edit - spelling"
Insurance,3b3bur,cocoorkiki,2,Thu Jun 25 21:49:38 2015 UTC,You're probably correct. I don't work for them I was just going by what I remember on their website.
Insurance,3b3bur,dan_232,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"I work for a company in Ontario who uses telematics, and no it cannot impact you negatively. On fact there is legislation in place by the Ontario government to prevent companies from doing anything with the data but giving you a discount.   It looks at things like hard braking fast acceleration, when you drive how much you drive. That's if you have the box in your car if you have the cell phone app it will track your speed but allows for minor dieviation of 10-15km/h difference."
Insurance,3b3bur,Phil_Achio,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:05:53 2015 UTC,So if I tell them I drive only 28 km to and from work but drive more than that it can't effect me negatively as well? Thanks for the information.  Really appreciative.
Insurance,3b37ww,Cinerai,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"Is the rate for my insurance appropriate?     Nobody here can say for certain. Insurance rates depend on your age, credit, zip code, what the insurance company thinks you should be paying and 100 other factors. The only way to get the lowest price is to call as many companies as you can for a quote.    I thought insurance was purchased for a vehicle, and not a person. So, each person who drives a vehicle has to purchase insurance, even if it's the same vehicle?    Insurance typically follows the vehicle and not the person unless that person is driving the vehicle regularly. Regularly is defined differently by insurance companies but it typically means driving the vehicle more than 12-14 times per year. If a person is driving the vehicle regularly the insurance company requires them to be listed as a driver on that policy.    The insurance I'm buying is so I can drive legally, correct?    Correct. I think NH is the only state that doesn't require insurance or a bond. The registered owner of the vehicle must insure the vehicle in order to drive legally. If they don't then their license is suspended.    What exactly am I insuring myself again with this?   It depends on the coverage you're buying. It's best to sit down with your insurance agent/broker and have them go over your options specific to your state."

Insurance,3b37ww,eddie2911,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:02:24 2015 UTC,So about 800/6 month is what you're looking at.  Is that full coverage or just liability?  If it's full coverage that's about right for other 18-year old insured's I've written policies for.  Young drivers are kind of pigeon-holed in the fact that not as many companies will write you and the ones that do will jack up the rates.  Which company are you looking at?
Insurance,3b37ww,SoStinkingCute,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:54:53 2015 UTC,I think it's liability. I'm heading down to the office tomorrow to talk with the insurance agent.
Insurance,3b37ww,SoStinkingCute,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you for sure that your rate is correct, without knowing what coverage you selected, your address, credit worthiness, etc, but it doesn't sound completely unreasonable.  Younger drivers don't have higher rates because society considers them flippant and dangerous, they have higher rates because they have more accidents.  Unfortunately insurance companies are going to give you a rate based on your statistical likelihood of having an accident. Insurance is generally purchased on the vehicle, and then you add in the drivers.  You should be added as a driver on your dad's policy, which will make his insurance more expensive, instead of getting your own. You are making sure that you have the ability to pay for damage you cause to another person or their property, but you would be doing this by being added to your dad's policy also."

If you can't make a deductible or expect to have a lot of healthcare expenses you buy a  policy with the lower deductible. I don't know your situation, but it raises my eyebrows when you make more than double the median household income in the US and say you can't afford a $6300 deductible?   What do you mean by ""pop the deductible""? If you can't afford your deductible it seems counterproductive to owe the whole thing at once vs $100 here and there (which may or may not eventually total $6300 over the course of the year)."

The simple answer is that next enrollment, you opt for a better plan.  You literally chose the lowest priced bronze plan on the exchange.  This doesn't always work out to be the best option.  For $393 a month, you could have gotten the silver tier Humana plan.  That plan offers copays for both primary care and specialists.  So instead of paying $100 to see your PCP, you end up paying $25 per visit and to see the specialist, you'd end up paying $35 per visit.  Now, realize that this is still the cheapest silver plan on the exchange, so some things are out of pocket until you reach the deductible such as MRIs and CTs.  But, again, you have to do a cost/benefit analysis here.  If you know something like these problems are going to come up, then you'll want to plan ahead and make the investment in a higher priced plan.  As you age, it's going to get more expensive.  You're going to have more health issues.  And yes, cost of insurance is going to reflect that."

The reason being that you were covered with the insurance company during the time of visit to the approved doctor. If this do get taken to court they should be liable for your lawyer fees as well. When calling the insurance provider I would ask for a supervisor to take over the claim and have them straighten it out. Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Insurance,3b0mls,ishwork,9,Thu Jun 25 00:38:34 2015 UTC,"Careful with using the ""rot"" excuse.

Insurance,3b0mls,gunjr,3,Thu Jun 25 00:41:25 2015 UTC,Only if the rot was open and obvious to OP.  Also this would only conceivably apply to the tree itself. The resulting damage would be covered.
Insurance,3b0mls,Zen_Drifter,2,Thu Jun 25 01:42:12 2015 UTC,I want to understand this - are you saying the damage to the house could be covered under the regular deductible? But not the cost to remove and cleanup the tree?
Insurance,3b0mls,Zen_Drifter,9,Thu Jun 25 01:55:22 2015 UTC,"It seems the insurer is presuming that the proximate cause of the loss was wind blowing down a weakened tree. Can you argue that it's rot? Perhaps. Can you sell it to a judge? That's all that matters in the end if the insurer does not agree. Do you have pictures of the tree and the rot or has it already been disposed of? If I'm on the jury I'd be inclined to say it's wind, but there may be on-point case law on this topic in your state. If your home is worth a lot of money then a 2% deductible may be worth having a real estate or insurance attorney research it for you.   So no there won't be different deductibles because it's all one loss.   The coverage for the tree itself may be in question if you claim rot though. Damage to trees under homeowner's policies is usually named peril. This means trees (and I'm talking about the tree itself, not your house) are only covered for reasons stated in the policy. Like /u/buckem said this may include things like wind, lightning, vehicle strikes, etc.. For wind there is often an aggregate limit (for all the windblown trees from a single event) of $500 or so. The insurer adds the amount necessary to remove the tree from the roof (which is separate from the $500 or whatever amount the policy covers for the loss of the tree itself) to your claim.   Because of the subtleties in these calculations the tree guys sometimes try to play all sorts of games with the numbers. For example a really huge oak tree falls against the house and is lying in the yard with one branch on the roof. The tree guy knows you only get $500 for the $2000 job to cut-up and haul away this tree, but you have additional coverage to get the tree off the house. So sometimes they try to hand the insurer a bill that says it's $2000 to get the tree off the house and $500 to cut it up and haul it away when it's actually the exact opposite.   So back to your situation, if you claim the tree fell because of rot, and the insurer accepts this argument, then you likely do not get any money for the tree itself because rot is probably not a covered peril for trees, but you would just have a regular deductible.  If the tree was agreed to have fallen from wind then you probably get $500 (or whatever amount the policy says) for the tree, but you have a 2% deductible on the loss.  You should be getting paid $ to remove the tree from the roof either way as it needs to be done to affect the repair.  The roof itself should be covered regardless of how the tree fell, as long as it wasn't intentional. The issue is just 1) whether the tree itself is covered, and 2) which way the deductible is calculated.   EDIT:clarity"
Insurance,3b0mls,iwearlederhosen,3,Thu Jun 25 02:38:47 2015 UTC,"Best reply yet. I pay for this garbage all the time under the base deductible.

Insurance,3b0mls,emptydiner,5,Thu Jun 25 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"/u/gunjr is right, not likely, but that's worst case scenario.  Hiring a public adjuster won't help either, they'll just take 10% of your settlement.  This is actually a really good question. I mean, the answer to the real question is no. Not always. (It could be weight of snow, lightning strike, car crash, whatever, not really relevant.)   However, this poses a good question in terms of claims. Without being in claims (and I hope someone from claims sees this), I would think it depends on the type of rot. If it was rotting on the inside and wasn't visible from the outside it should definitely be covered. If the tree was obviously rotting and you should have been aware, it would most likely be declined. That's just my opinion though, and hopefully a property adjuster chimes in.  What do you mean the tree fell because of water? Did you know the tree was unhealthy before it fell?"
Insurance,3b0mls,expyrian,2,Thu Jun 25 01:08:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.   The tree looked healthy before the limb fell. It was split about 10 ft off the ground into 2 very large branches. It did not look rotted from the outside. Once it fell the tree removal guy pointed out it was in fact rotted because water accumulated inside the trunk.   So as others have said I don't know if going to my adjuster and pointing out the rot would make me out as liable. I may be better off going with the wind / hail claim. That is the essence of my question.
Insurance,3b0mls,expyrian,2,Thu Jun 25 01:46:26 2015 UTC,"Falling objects is typically a covered peril for most insurers. However, if the object falls as the result of anything that is excluded (Wear and tear, rot, etc), then the damage from the falling object is also excluded.  The only real way that the Wind/Hail deductible would not apply is if lightning struck the tree, it was being trimmed and the limb fell, some one ran into the tree with their car and it then fell over, and maybe a couple other weird one off scenarios."
Insurance,3b0mls,eddie2911,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:05:23 2015 UTC,What are the chances that a tree that appears to be healthy but was indeed rotten from the inside fell on a house and the claim be denied?

Insurance,3b0mls,MSCantrell,2,Thu Jun 25 01:29:52 2015 UTC,The cost to replace the house is 200k. Wind/hail deductible is 2% of that at 4k. My regular deductible is 1k. Cost of repairs is - you guessed it - just over 4k.
Insurance,3b0mls,MSCantrell,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:51:25 2015 UTC,Hate to say it but your options don't look very good from what I've gathered.  Do you trust your agent enough to ask him how a claim would be handled if the tree was recently rotted?  You could also comb your policy to try and find that information.  Might be worth it for future reference to change your wind/hail deductible as they're the most common claims with homes and 4k is too high.  I don't write over 1k unless specifically asked by an insured.
Insurance,3b0mls,stares_at_screens,2,Thu Jun 25 02:03:38 2015 UTC,"You could also comb your policy to try and find that information.   This will be frustrating for OP, and is embarrassing for me as a representative of the industry, but no. You should, in principle, be able to read your policy and know whether any conceivable situation will be covered or not.   But in this case, no. Virtually every insurance policy will exclude inadequate maintenance and deterioration. Almost every policy will cover falling objects.   When a rotten tree falls and damages your house, was the damage caused by deterioration out by a falling object? No policy will specify that.  And that leaves OP subject to a judgment call on the part of her adjuster. That's not ideal, but it can't be helped.  In my experience, most carriers would call a tree that rots and falls in the absence of wind a falling object and cover the damage. But that's not universal. :("

I think the argument that the policy puts people at risk doesn't hold water. No, the people who kidnap put people at risk. The same could be argued for pretty much any coverage - GL policies put people at risk because criminals will stage accidents, Auto policies put people at risk because some people think getting hit by an expensive and/or commerical vehicle is a guaranteed large settlement.

First I think it violates the principle of insurable interest to extort a company to pay ransom for an individual they don't personally know.

Insurance,3azg09,cvrb98,6,Wed Jun 24 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"I typically tell people to expect Blue Book minus 15%. The adjusters for the companies I represent have a way to find sales of your vehicle within so many miles, then they can say ""Look, here are the last 50 sales of your car, I dont care what NADA says, this is what it is worth.""  They should be able to show you how they come up with the number, but I would start looking for a car just like the one you had. Dont worry about the dollar amount, you just want to be where you were before the accident, which was a 2009 Chevy Tahoe.  Autotrader has 2 chevy tahoes in NC with 122,000 miles listed at $22,000.  Not sure your mileage and such.  Seriously, they arent out to screw you. They want to put you back to where you were. NADA is just an estimate.  If you run into problems, definitely post here and we'll help you get through it."
Insurance,3azg09,UnhelpfulReply,5,Wed Jun 24 19:57:43 2015 UTC,First I'm assuming you're not the registered owner so they'll be dealing with your parents not you. I also hope that you have gap coverage for the vehicle as it isn't worth anywhere near what you paid for it as soon as you drive it off the lot. They owe for the actual cash value of your vehicle as opposed to replacement value. They'll present their offer to the registered owner and the documentation backing up the number. It will be up to the owner to present evidence as to why the value is higher if they disagree. You always have the option to proceed through your own carrier if you feel like they're being unreasonable. From personal experience with a GEICO total loss I was very satisfied with their process.
Insurance,3azg09,ferdiad,3,Wed Jun 24 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"NADA is a good reference, but they may not be using it, it could also be CCC or other sources. You could ask. The best way to make sure you get the car's worth is to make sure the correct options are listed on the valuation, like sunroof, heated seats, etc etc. We're not looking to low ball people, the most effective way to handle settlements is to pay what is owed. Human error happens, one way to account for that, like I said, is to make sure the odometer reading the rep is referencing is correct, options, etc. KBB is notorious for setting unrealistic expectations and breaking people's hearts. NADA will be more in line. Keep in mind that once the offer is made, the clock is ticking on that rental. They will tell you what the last day of rental is owed, and technically that day is the day they make an offer. They won't kick you out of the rental that day, but at the same time they don't owe it until you buy another car. THey will specify how many more days they will pay for it. So start formulating plans now for what is next for you."
Insurance,3azg09,f1shbone,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:10:59 2015 UTC,"Your main leverage is just being well informed. Do your own research into comparable vehicles for sale in your area. Note that the advertised price isn't a value, it's just a starting point. If you really loved the Tahoe and want an exact replacement there's nothing stopping you from going down to the seller and negotiating the whole deal pending insurance payment. Right there you have a real number in your hand for a real car. That's hard to argue with.   Another point of leverage is (presuming GEICO is the other person's carrier) you can always turn around and submit the claim to your own insurer instead. Maybe lees ""leverage"" than ""second opinion"". This is no guarantee of course since your own insurer may come back with a similar or lower offer than you already have. Then again it might be higher.   Remember that, in the end, anything offered by you from another person's insurance company is voluntary. Like /u/unhelpful reply said, they're not out to screw you. They just want it off their desk. Yes those people you're dealing with are probably on a clock and are referring to the mantra that ""a good claim is a closed claim"". In the end their main concern is that when the person responsible for how much they get paid opens up that file two months from now to review it that what's in that file reflects sound judgement on why they did what they did."

Insurance,3azvy3,forneusFQ,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:20:34 2015 UTC,I don't think that there will be a product that does what you want it to do.  You can certainly insure the equipment but you aren't going to be able to file a claim if $500 worth of stuff (out of 10k) is damaged/destroyed/stolen on every job (extrapolate those numbers as is necessary).  A carrier isn't going to write you a policy that is inevitably going to pay out after every job unless they can charge you more than they pay out.  You can (and probably should) have coverage on the equipment as a whole to protect against a large loss but if you use that policy to file 1000 small claims you would quickly find yourself canceled.
Insurance,3azvy3,chris41658,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"If you are renting the scaffolding to others, the rental agreement probably makes them responsible for the damage.

If there isn't a co-pay for ER with the deductible waived, then yes, you owe $6000 and there really isn't anything you can do about it as you're getting exactly what you paid for when you signed up for the insurance.

If your health insurance through work costs more than 9.5% of your income then it costs too much and you should use https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/ to see what fits.  All things being equal I recommend a ""Silver"" plan.  It has the best bang for the buck because the government subsidizes that one the most when it comes to deductibles.  As far as Cobra is concerned you don't need to worry about it.  You use Cobra because you've lost group coverage.  Use to be a big deal, but today if you lose group coverage as long as you sign up through the Affordable Care Act within 60 days of losing coverage you're automatically accepted with all the subsidies.  Aetna doesn't care jack all about you as far as pricing goes.  State specific vs. National is for non-emergency situations.  Found a weird lump and you go to an out of network doctor?  You'll have some fees.  Have a weird lump that suddenly appears and explodes blood so you rush to the emergency room?  Covered no matter where you are.  So you have to ask yourself how important is it that you have a doctor you can go to check for lumps always nearby?  In the end I'll tell you the same I tell other people.  Find a licensed independent broker in your area (best way is to ask friends and families who they trust) because they'll know the ins and outs of your area's specific carriers and will be able to give you face to face advice.

As an example when you see somewhere has a sale going on it doesn't apply if you use insurance so in the end it's a horse apiece for price. In particular because of websites out there that you can find very affordable options with. If you do need vision though, it's generally sold as ""supplemental"" insurance that you purchase separate.

It doesn't necessarily make sense if your 0% at fault that you still have to pay something, but that's how NJ no-fault works. You cannot make a claim against the other person for your co-pays and deductibles either.   The only way you'll get money back is if you file a bodily injury claim against the other person, and then, assuming you have the verbal threshold, you'll have to prove you sustained a permanent injury to recover for pain and suffering."

They'll know how to leverage your income to find you the best rates possible and as an example in my area the most affordable carrier also happens to be the carrier that likes to stiff people and never answer their phones.

You're playing coy with the adjuster which is probably only going to encourage him to lowball you, mainly since your response outed you as not knowing what you're doing.  This is definitely a negotiation, but you're going to need some facts and figures on your side if you want any power in the transaction at all.  You need to do your homework."

Leaving it to the other insurance company isn't going to get you any where, they aren't goingto work to find you a value and if they offer oneit'll be taken as low.

This is really difficult and there's only one state in the US (Georgia) that has a statute for it.  The only way I've ever seen diminished value claims work is when the owner of the vehicle sold it, took a loss, and demanded the difference.  It's kind of a huge hassle and there's no guarantee you'll get anything if your documentation isn't good enough.  This would also require you to know the actual value of your car.  Before you go and check KBB, don't bother.  It's a shitty valuation tool.   Could they technically say I don't feel like paying anything, good luck?   Yup.  If you don't provide a compelling enough case for your car losing value, they can tell you to pound sand."

Insurance,3avhdi,ggskater,2,Tue Jun 23 20:51:56 2015 UTC,Almost every agent should have access to what's called a CLUE report which clearly indicates who the operator of the vehicle was in an accident. If the agent you're working with doesn't have access to that than his or her underwriter will. You shouldn't have to contact your previous agent at all since accidents are all reported to the same agency as far as insurance is concerned.

With that said, the hospital's billing department will have no idea if an unaffiliated anesthesiologist is participating or not (many do no). I'd try and put some heat on the in-network surgeon for bringing in an out of network anestesiologist, but I know from the insurer's side, this is the kind of reason we're supposed to quote anesthesia benefits any time surgery comes up.

Having said that, I just don't see this playing out in the 3rd car's favor in Arbitration. So there's 3 insurance companies involved here, two of them are in agreement, while the third is dissenting based on their insured's version. The best thing for you is to do what you're already doing, pursue your insurance and let them figure it out amongst themselves. The thing here is that joint and several laws apply. They vary from state to state but the gist of it is When multiple parties can be held liable for the same event or act and be responsible for all restitution required. In cases of joint and several liability, a person who was harmed or wronged by several parties could be awarded damages and collect from any one, several, or all of the liable parties.    In other words it is factually established you as the leading car has zero negligence, so your insurance company should be able to collect damages and the other two will have to figure it out who owes what. The fact that your insurance is choosing to prepay your deductible tells me they are confident they will not have difficulty recovering it from one of the other two or both, or that the rep is incompetent, which is the least likely possibility.    As far as diminished value, that will be on you to prove, unless you're in Georgia where it is automatically owed."

If the other company fixed their insured's car and wins in arb, your insurance has to pay them--that doesn't mean however that they would change their liability decision and put you at fault. What probably happened is that the other driver probably said they are adamant that you changed lanes into them and that they're fighting the citation. Police reports are not the ""be all, end all"" kind of thing, though they can have heavy influence.

If you back into my car while I'm parked there, you still owe for my damages.  Yes, I was breaking the law, and no, I shouldn't have been there, but you still aren't allowed to hit my car.

As for the exhaust, as long as the pipe wasn't kinked badly, you're not looking at a huge change in back pressure, and therefore not as likely to cause any damage by driving it.  Also not likely to leak any exhaust fumes into the cabin.  If he just re-hung it (put the rubber thing back onto the hanger), that's not really work, either.  Pictures would help, though, if you have any.  As for your DV claim, I just read somewhere that GA automatically adds it, so that should be easy for you.

You can read about State Farm's Select Service program on their website. I'm not an advocate for their company, just speaking in general terms as to what Program Shops means in the insurance industry. There are certain standards and obligations shops have to adhere to, and they are subject to random audits. Also, the statement to file under one's own policy is also on the caveat that your own insurance company is reputable and responsive."
Insurance,3apy3q,f1shbone,2,Mon Jun 22 22:44:05 2015 UTC,"I also want to point out that since the car has been put in a Program shop, they have already accepted liability. A car doesn't go to the shop until this happens.

All this is avoided by pursuing the at-fault insurance company which has already accepted responsibility and offered to take care of everything."

I'm definitely not a mechanic, but I do know more than the average person about automobiles due to my husband being a mechanic by trade and my dad being a car enthusiast, they've taught me a lot. I know that what he did was not something that should have happened. I know that no work is to be done on a vehicle unless authorized by the owner of the vehicle. I second guessed him because he did something that we did not discuss and he told me after it was done and too late for me to tell him no. That is unacceptable and definitely made me not trust him or his judgement.   Maybe I should find a sub that would discuss the legal portion with me. My SO and I discussed getting an attorney since we are kind of lost here and aren't sure what to push for/give up on."
Insurance,3apy3q,f1shbone,3,Mon Jun 22 20:58:01 2015 UTC,"Op, I am/was an auto claims handler for Georgia and also familiar with the repair process you are involved with. The dealership is on the State Farm program more than likely because they are trusted to do good work. It is a very coveted position amongst repair shops, and not everyone gets on it. Their estimates are pre-approved and the payment is handled electronically directly with them. All you need to do is drop the car off and pick it up once it's repaired. You can definitely discuss with State Farm exactly what the program benefits are, and I can confirm that they will warranty their work nationwide. If something goes wrong, SF will step in to assist you. This is the advantage. If you pick a non-program shop, it's between you and that shop. What the dealership has done is more or less standard practice to make sure your vehicle is safe to be driven until they can get you in for repairs. It is very unlikely that any given shop has an open bay waiting for a car to roll in, and you can get it starting repairs that very day. As an insurance professional and analyst, I am not seeing anything here particularly worrysome. I understand you're trying to familiarize yourself with the process, don't make it more complicated that it needs to be :)  The simplest thing to do is to let the Program shop handle the work. https://www.statefarm.com/claims/find-a-select-service-repair-facility As far as diminished value, the formula is quite simple. They take into account the market value of the vehicle, they consider the extent of damages, the mileage, and calculate diminished value based on that."

Insurance,3as97x,Still_Mighty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:34:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know about your condo association's rules regarding what type of flooring you can have and it would be a good idea to check with them before starting the work.   When it comes to insurance, the purpose is to indemnify you- to put you right back to where you were before the loss occurred. If you had carpet before the loss, your policy will pay you to put carpet back.   I know that my company does not care if you decide to use that money toward putting in hardwood floor. The additional cost would be out of pocket, since hardwood is more expensive and again, insurance is not going to put you in a different/better spot than before.   There's a few caveats to this though. First, some people may interpret this as ""insurance doesn't care what we do with the money, let's go on vacation instead!""  This doesn't sound like your situation, as the association is requesting to see receipts of the completed work, but insurance DOES care what you do with the money, to a certain extent. Put a floor down, and be aware you may be responsible for any increase in cost between what they allowed and what you chose to put down.   Second, notify your agent if you put down a more expensive grade flooring. If you put down $100 per sqft flooring and your policy limits are estimated based on $15 per sqft flooring, your policy limits are now inadequate. Usually the difference isn't huge and this is unnecessary, but on the off chance your condo is in Trump Tower, better safe than sorry."

We are looking at $5.49 per square foot for the engineered hardwood, so not a major overage.

Insurance,3aqeqn,currently_pooping_,15,Mon Jun 22 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is you are misunderstanding the reason the claim was denied.   The electronics themselves are not being denied due to wear and tear. The entire claim is being denied due to the fact that the roof was in poor condition. It is the responsibility of the property owner to maintain the property, if the roof was not not maintained then any resulting damage would not be covered.  Now, your landlord has a duty to keep the property in good condition, you might be able to sue the landlord for the damages you have incurred."

Insurance,3aqeqn,stares_at_screens,4,Mon Jun 22 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"Insurance is not an alternative to maintenance. Homeowners insurance contracts clearly state that they cover the unexpected, and that they don't cover damaged resulting from someone being negligent at maintenance. No roof will last forever, but that doesn't mean the insurance company will pick up the tab on the day it finally breaks.  Within this subreddit we had a question a month or two back from someone who was confused that a company refused to renew their homeowners policy because it had been too long since they had replaced their roof - insurance companies are not stupid, they saw an impending issue and cut the liability loose instead of ending up in OP's situation, as is their right.  OP: as others have already suggested, you should be pursuing your landlord for damages on this. Rent is not free money, it comes with some basic expectations that the property be kept in a maintained state. IANAL but your case would probably be stronger if there was any kind of recent inspection. If your landlord can document any reason why they didn't replace the roof, such as evidence they had it appraised by a roofer and were told it was unnecessary, then the liability could shift to that party."
Insurance,3aqeqn,DiscordianAgent,6,Mon Jun 22 22:32:09 2015 UTC,"The roof is your land lords responsibility.

Insurance,3aqeqn,VarsityGirls,2,Tue Jun 23 00:16:41 2015 UTC,"Water leaking through the roof could be a covered cause of loss under your renters insurance if it was a sudden, violent type of event - a windstorm rips some shingles off causing a subsequent leak or something like that.  A leaky roof that's been leaky for years isn't covered.  It's not covered by your landlord's insurance either.  It's a shitty situation for you because having just moved in, you had no cause to know the roof leaked.  Have you told your landlord what happened and what was their response?

Insurance,3aqeqn,key2616,9,Mon Jun 22 18:06:37 2015 UTC,Good point.  Depends on what kind of apartment we're talking about and whether a GL is in place.  If it's one or two units they may just have a dwelling policy.  In any case I think talking to the landlord is the next logical step.

You must have a named peril policy which is total garbage coverage.  Every renters policy I sell would have covered that (your personal effects- not the roof obviously)... If you went through an agent- shame on them. Call your insurance company ask if you have ""named peril"" or ""open peril"". If open peril policy ask the adjuster for the exclusion language that negates coverage for this event."

Insurance,3aq5jt,optical_mommy,2,Mon Jun 22 16:59:25 2015 UTC,"Where are you travelling abroad from and to?  Your employer is/should be responsible for setting up international insurance coverage for you while you're on comany business.  Verify the policy, make sure you have the paperwork, images in your email also in case of loss.  Your coverage will depend on which country you're travelling to as many work differently.  At that point it's all in the plan you're on and presenting it to the provider at the time of service.  Your employer should not have to be informed if it's a personal issue, but they will need to be informed if you're going to the doctor due to an injury while you were working.  that's another point, make sure the coverage, if it's work related, covers your entire time or only while you're considered on the clock.  If you get a rash because you're allergic to the hotel's soap is it going to cover that?  Or only if you break your leg while sitting at whatever convention you've travelled to sit at.  Especially if you're travelling to the US, do be AWARE of what your benefits are so that no human error has you overpaying.  We're so very complicated compared to other countries."
Insurance,3aq5jt,jackalooz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"I guess a little background is an order. I am a med student working with a physician that specializes in ""concierge"" travel medicine. This physician contracts out to a number of fortune 100 companies and serves as a medical consultant to supplement the companies existing travel insurance or insurance policy. The way it was explained to me is that if someone gets really sick abroad (lets say the person is traveling from the US and gets sick in Italy), then the insurance company becomes ""responsible"" for coordinating care and contracts out this task to a big travel medical assistance company like SOS international, AXA, or Europe Assist. From there, it's my understanding that SOS international or a similar firm coordinates care, communicates with the employer and organizes medical evacuations if necessary. Moreover, these big travel firms are incentivized to evacuate people (chartering a medical evac plane costs $150,000+) which costs employers significant sums of money. So the niche that this doc carved out is to basically be a middle man between the travel assist company and the company with the sick employee in Italy. In doing so, he is giving the employer some white glove service,  coordinating all aspects of the patients care abroad and reducing the need for medical evacuations.  I am expected to write a paper on this process and this is proving to be a difficult task because I know virtually nothing beyond what I have just explained. I turned to reddit and this sub in a moment of futility because when I google the subject, nothing seems to match up to how this process was explained to me by my advising physician. Does the process I described make any sense from your perspective? I understand this is a shot in the dark and any insight, links to resources, or advice would be tremendously appreciated."
Insurance,3aq5jt,Mdcastle,3,Mon Jun 22 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"Yes - you are on the correct track.  This insurance is typically provided under Foreign Voluntary Workers Compensation coverage.  This coverage can include evacuation and repatriation expenses.  Evacuations are expensive, but it can be much more expensive if an employee is severely injured or dies abroad.  Therefore, it is usually in the insurance company's interest to evacuate an employee to a country with modern medical infrastructure."

Other than when you say you are going to kill someone, they basically can't share information.    They have to keep confidentiality because they want their clients/patients to tell them the truth about everything, so they can make correct decisions.

Amortizing those costs is good.  Defense against her lawsuit is better.  Even if you end up having to find another insurance carrier, you are better off using the coverage in the long term.

Insurance,3ao7xr,Phil_Achio,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:55:37 2015 UTC,In most states insurance follows the car so it would be your girlfriends insurance if you wanted to claim it.   Generally speaking these accidents are shared responsability as you were both backing.  Laws vary by state.  Talk to her insurer but I would not expect them to accept full responsibility.
Insurance,3anbxg,sonofalando,2,Sun Jun 21 22:23:53 2015 UTC,"How certain are you that this Transamerica plan is true blue health insurance and not some sort of weird annuity or universal life insurance?  Your explanation of how that plan works got me curious and I went to their website.  There is nothing on their site about offering any health insurance other than Medicare supplement that would generally be for retired people age 65 and older.  Coordination of benefits (COB) between 2 health plans can be complex and will depend greatly on the method of coordination the secondary plan uses.  But I get the impression that your spouses plan through her employer may not be, technically, health insurance."
Insurance,3ak2fr,jesscothemofo,15,Sat Jun 20 23:38:36 2015 UTC,"No insurance company will cover that.  As a homeowner you are required to maintain your home.  The roof and associated leaks are part of that.  If something happened like a tree falling on it, that's covered.  You being a lazy homeowner and not taking care of the problem the first time you noticed it is not."
Insurance,3ak2fr,Jeremy7508,-4,Sun Jun 21 00:37:57 2015 UTC,I agree that I should of fixed the chimney problem. I have my reasons why I haven't yet and laziness isn't one of them. I don't see how random leaks in a fairly new roof would be considered routine maintenance.
Insurance,3ak2fr,MountainGoat84,8,Sun Jun 21 00:46:03 2015 UTC,"The leaks occurred over a period of six months.  That'said the issue.  If you had contacted your insurance company after the first leak you would have been covered.  At that time,  if there wasn't any storm damage to your roof,  they wouldn't cover that as poor  workmanship,  improper installation is excluded."
Insurance,3ak2fr,majesticjg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:57:35 2015 UTC,It's 2 different leaks at different spots in the house. The chimney leak happened where the bricks meet the shingles. I'm not too worried about that one. I put some tar on the joint and hopefully that fixes it.  I don't know where the water is coming from on the other one though. It is a long way from the chimney and on the other side of the roof peak. I haven't been in the attic yet and there is nothing obvious on the top of the roof. I just noticed it. My roof might be quite a bit older than the 5-6 Years old that I originally said.
Insurance,3ak2fr,otterish,7,Sun Jun 21 01:32:44 2015 UTC,"t's 2 different leaks at different spots in the house.   Sorry, that's just not an insurance claim.

By the time of the inspection the first leak has been patched, or at least as far as I can tell the insured has attempted to mitigate that damage (we have more information here then I feel like I would ever get upfront), I still wouldn't cover that, But now we have a new leak.  For the record I would also do our companies version of notifying the UW department about the deficiencies on our insured's property , and he would likely see a cancellation shortly after."

Silicone caulk is usually a much better solution, but the best solution is actually fixing the problem which is typically poorly installed flashing. Call a good roofing company. Most of them will do minor repairs for a very reasonable amount because they want you to call them the next time you need a roof replaced. They'll also inspect your roof to see if you can get the roof replaced due to wind/hail damage."

Your homeowners insurance almost definitely will not pay.

You weren't at fault, but it shows that you might be a more risky driver because you drive in a time and place where accidents like that happen.

The first time I had it repaired and he had to go to the repair shop to estimate additional damage, the 2nd time I pocketed it since it was mostly just a imprint of the guy's License plate on my bumber. As far as I know they should of billed the other insurance company the amount and not lost any money since they admitted their driver was 100% at fault..  At least that's how i would think it would work?"
Insurance,3ajvw0,Mochashaft,3,Sun Jun 21 15:20:12 2015 UTC,"If they paid the claim and were unable to recover the funds from the other company, it will affect your premium. However it may still be in subrogation, I would call and talk with USAA's claims department about your claims and see if they are pursuing subrogation at all. Did you provide them with the other parties insurance information or a police report?"
Insurance,3ajvw0,Cheezy24,2,Sun Jun 21 15:29:37 2015 UTC,Even if they paid the claim and did recover you would lose a discount because you filed a claim through your insurance and they paid anything. Even a tow bill.

Insurance,3ajvw0,PA-Agent-Broker,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:12:00 2015 UTC,I spoke and gave statements to both USAA and the other drivers insurance companies in both cases and both admitted their driver was responsible since it's pretty cut and dry in rear end accidents in traffic.  I did not call for police in either cases since they were so minor and wanted to get to work and just exchanged information.   There was no issues tracking the people down.
Insurance,3ajvw0,PA-Agent-Broker,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:40:25 2015 UTC,This is pretty normal.  Probably USAA version of the claim free discount.  You lose this discount for filing any claim with the company. This is why it is best to use the other guy's company first and only use your own company if you feel they aren't being fair to you.

Insurance,3aimv8,DragonPup,4,Sat Jun 20 15:33:57 2015 UTC,"In most cases like these the upstairs neighbor has no liability so you'll likely have to incur the deductible and likely won't be able to collect for lost wages and such. This should be your default understanding going into this.  Liability arises here largely from negligence on the part of the owner of the water heater. You or your insurer would have to demonstrate that the owner did something to cause the leak (an act) or didn't do something that they should have done (an omission) that caused your damages.  So unless the water heater had prior issues or you could demonstrate that some plumber had told them it needed replacement, or it was way beyond its life expectancy, then this will be an uphill fight for you.  In some states there are ""strict liability"" laws that automatically make you liable for certain types of damages but in the context of homeowners/renters claims these are mainly dog bite laws.   The homeowner insurance version of your claim is when a storm blows over your neighbors perfectly good live tree and it lands on the roof of your house. There is usually no liability on your neighbor for that sort of thing either.  So don't be optimistic but it's worth taking some photos of the blown water heater and photos of the installation date tag on it if it has one. Also the bottom edges of it if it had obvious external rust that would have been visible upon casual inspection. You might get them to accept liability if it's really old, like 20 or 30 years old. Maybe. Your argument would be that any reasonable person would have replaced their water heater when it exceeded 10-12 years old and was aware that damage to the property of others might occur if it blew.  If the water heater was defective you might be able to pursue a claim against the manufacturer. EDIT - addtl info"
Insurance,3aimv8,Zen_Drifter,2,Sat Jun 20 15:50:04 2015 UTC,The building itself isn't a decade old yet. I'll speak with my management company on Monday with what they found in the neighbor's unit.
Insurance,3aimv8,Zen_Drifter,2,Sat Jun 20 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"The property damage appraiser for your insurer has an obligation to their employer to try to identify any opportunities for subrogating the claim against the other party, so your insurer is just as interested in getting their money back as you are in getting your deductible back. The appraiser should be able to tell you whether you have realistic chances or not.   With a broken pipe in the ceiling or a leaky wax seal under the toilet or a faulty tub drain I'd say your chances were zero, but presumably the water heater is externally visible so there's a chance that you could argue that the owner knew or should have known it needed replacement.   That said, water heaters will rot from the inside out (heating oil tanks do the same thing) so there may have been no obvious external sign that there was anything wrong with it. So if it was still reasonably within its expected lifetime there may be no liability."

I take it getting the water people out asap before contacting my home owners is always the correct move to minimize damages.

Edit: > but presumably the water heater is externally visible so there's a chance that you could argue that the owner knew or should have known it needed replacement.  We all have closets for our heaters. They are owned by the individual condo owner."
Insurance,3aimv8,Zen_Drifter,3,Sat Jun 20 16:17:45 2015 UTC,You did the right thing. You have an obligation under the conditions section of your policy to mitigate your damages. Even if it's not the particular mitigation contractor your insurer would have recommended it's better than having done nothing and just letting the water sit all weekend. It shouldn't be a problem.  You're probably SOL on the lost wages unless there is something in your policy that covers that sort of thing.

Insurance,3aimv8,powdertoastman420,2,Sat Jun 20 16:35:50 2015 UTC,"One thing I forgot. Building codes may (or may have at time of installation) required a catch pan of some sort under the heater for this situation. Maybe look into that. If it was an explosive leak then it probably wouldn't matter but if it occurred over time then it may have been something they should have noted.  Also, if it makes you feel better, your neighbor's insurer will probably deny the claim for the water heater itself as wear & tear so he/she will probably be out of pocket for that.  In my experience sometimes neighbors want to stay neighborly so sometimes they'll toss you a few bucks towards your deductible even if they're not legally obligated to."

The one you can see may have been closed, but the subrogation unit (typically not visible to a customer) is probably still open.

I would suggest to take pics of your vehicle as well on the point of impact. Without documenting this, she could decide to file on your insurance policy anyways.

Insurance,3agick,britt5689,2,Mon Jun 22 14:16:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure why it was mentioned before, that you make a lot of money in this industry. Lol it's highly competitive, and when your starting out, you will have to attract customers - just like any other industry but 10x harder. Are there agencies that write for millions? Of course. But to do that requires a lot of hard work and a lot of hours. If you're thinking long term, then yes the pay off is worth it. There is lots of networking opportunities and perks that come with this job. But the initial stages is quite difficult. There are even some brokers who work long hours and barely make anything. Also note that writing for millions and making millions are two different things. I don't want to discourage you, I just want to give you reality. If you find that this is something your passionate about or interested in then jump right it because that's all that's needed for success.   I don't know where you live, but in Florida, starting July 1, there is a requirement that you have to work for a broker for 2 years before you can go on your own and become an agent. The class is 200hrs, it can be completed online. Then the state exam is about 110 questions and then 50 questions on Florida statues. It is quite a challenge for some people. (Please Note: the information above is for property & casualty. Life & Health is shorter and less complicated but even more competitive than P&C).   My suggestion is that: 1. Research. Find out the requirements to be licensed. Read up on what successful agencies do & how they work. 2. Intern or work part-time. See what the work day is like. Some days/weeks can be really busy and others not so much. Observe what the brokers do, and just watch how they maintain their brokerage. 3.

Insurance,3afno3,jpstroop,10,Fri Jun 19 19:19:21 2015 UTC,"I never write a car up for an alignment unless the wheel was directly impacted, the car ended up hitting a curb, or there was a frame repair in the area where the suspension crossmembers are attached. This is common practice among almost all carriers.   The body shop is kinda stuck in the middle on these sorts of customer complaints. ""My radio doesn't work now"" is another common one. Either the insurer reviewed the file and said WFT or the shop simply forgot about it because it's not a normal part of the workflow on a repair like that. The shop is trying to walk the line between not pissing you off and not pissing the insurer off. So if you ask for something like that then their correct response would be ""we can add it but we don't expect the insurer to pay it"". The shop wants the insurer to be the bad guy for saying no and the insurer wants the shop to take the heat for them. It's sort of juvenile but that's how it works.    I doubt you can have the insurer change their mind on something like that without showing a cause/effect link.  With regards to the reconditioned parts yes those are OEM parts. Wheels, bumper covers, and headlights/taillights are commonly refurbished for reuse. Wheels get re-machined. The vast majority of insurers utilize refurbished wheels.   Headlights and tail lights have their mount tabs broken-off but are otherwise okay. The refurbisher repairs the tabs /cracks/chips on the housings and re-sells them. The auto manufacturers actually make tab kits for fixing lamps from many models. If I see a lamp with three broken tabs I just write the estimate for a new lamp. The body shop tosses it in a wire cage at the shop and once a month a lamp vendor comes by and buys all the broken lamps. They fix some for resale and toss the ones they can't fix.  Bumper cover are like lamps in that the body shop has a big pile of bumpers out back, many of which are repairable, but only with materials or techniques that are best performed at a large scale. So the bumper vendor picks them up and fixes some and shreds the rest. Remanufactured bumpers annoy the shit out of vehicle manufacturers so a number have taken to requiring an old bumper core when buying a new one or charging and charging a fee if it is not exchanged (like buying a car battery). The retreived bumpers are destroyed to keep them out of the hands of the remanufacturers. This creates scarcity so the OEMs can charge whatever they want for their new ones."
Insurance,3afno3,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"1) I would recommend calling into State Farm to ask about it. Ask for an explanation to why it wasn't covered. This is the best way to ask why and possibly dispute it. Estimating can be tricky, but nobody here is going tk be able to directly tell you if it is covered or not without the full car info (photos, ect) 2) Did you get the quote from the shop BEFORE letting State Farm know you were going there? Shops usually write their estimates differently (ie refurbished parts vs new parts) when somebody comes in off the street vs getting insurance to be billed directly. Otherwise I would ask the shop, but I see this frequently in scenarios like this. 3) It's my personal opinion that the refurbished parts aren't usually a whole lot different than new parts. I've seen shops/insurance companies return those parts if they aren't up to snuff when they get them. Plus they are guaranteed like you mention. Also, as of now they are allowed to do this.  This is in dispute on a few states and a few states have passed laws setting perameters (Indiana Parts Law: current plus last 5 years of vehicles get the choice of what parts are put on the vehicle), but for the most part they are allowed to."

You also have to look to see if there is any opportunity for subrogation. Once you have a general idea of what all is involved you decide if it would be best looked at by an outside adjuster or you try to handle it over the phone.  Once you're finished talking with the customer you need to document your conversation with them, set the reserve on what you think the loss is going to cost and set up any mitigation companies if needed.  After doing my call outs on new claims I typically spend then rest of my day following up on older claims, reviewing mitigation reports and writing estimates, following up with contractors etc. If I have everything finalized I'll call the customer and explain our payment and the supplement process if they need it.

However if you're 16 your mom is probably paying the majority of the premiums and MAYBE charging you a small amount monthly. If you're the third or fourth driver in a two car family, you'll likely be considered an ""occasional"" driver which means reduced risk and therefore reduced premium. On your own you'll be a primary driver.  To add to that, if your family has multiple policies they get reduced rates.   In other words it comes down to get in now under an established, already discounted policy to get your most expensive years out of the way (for less). By the time you go out on your own your rates should be lower because you'll have established history."

Insurance,3add1h,britt5689,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:53:20 2015 UTC,"well, yes and no. With most carriers- two things are factored into the rates for new drivers: how long you've been licensed AND how old you are. When you obtain your license and are added to her policy- there is always a ""surcharge"" for inexperienced operators (whether they are 17yrs old or 37)- usually its a 3 year surcharge but the surcharge gets reduced in increments over those 3 years.  So a 17 year old newly licensed is going to pay a lot for insurance, but a 21 year old newly licensed is still going to pay a lot- but not as much. But it really just all depends on how said insurance company structures their rates..."

Insurance,3acyeg,mmconley,5,Fri Jun 19 02:32:06 2015 UTC,"Generally comp claims (hail, deer, theft) etc won't effect your premiums. As far as I know, this holds true in every state but I always defer to someone local just to be sure as I learn something new every day. So 99.9 percent sure it wouldn't effect your premium.  What it can effect is your claim frequency. High claim frequency, even comp claims, can effect your insurability with that company. Enough claims, even if they're all comp and don't effect your rates, and you could still be dropped. How far you'd have to go For that to happen I can't say, because it depends on what kind of luck your carrier is having in your state.  I'd maybe recommend finding out what car max would pay for the car with or without the damage, and getting an estimate completed before you report it to insurance. That way, you know all the variables before you decide whether or not it makes sense for you to file the claim."
Insurance,3acyeg,TheCook73,5,Fri Jun 19 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"This does not hold true in every state. I'm in Michigan, and I can tell you that with my carrier, your premium would go up so long as the total payout exceeded a certain amount. The sole exception is for a chip repair on your windshield (as we encourage you to turn these claims in, in hopes that it'll prevent a full $500+ windshield replacement claim later). Other comprehensive claims - deer strikes, hail damage, etc. - are still going to be counted against you. You're being charged based on your propensity to turn in claims."

I don't think I've ever reported any claims, no accident history, so even with my deductible I'll go for it, but my concern is that I'm a new customer who will be removing the car days within filing the claim.

Insurance,3acyeg,TheCook73,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:02:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not in underwriting but I don't think it's that big of a deal.  You were paying your premiums for the car to be insured when they incident happened, you're entitled under the policy to be restored to your prior state.   If you have an agent they probably wouldn't be super excited to pay a claim then lose the future premium, but as you said you're still maintaining your policy not much they can do about it.   They may take an extra look at it since your policy is so new, but adjusters are pretty good at knowing when weather hits and where, if it's as you say it's legitimate, so you have nothing to worry about."

Right now they are arguing that simply from hail the car is only worth 38% of a comparable non-hail damaged car. Sounds light to me.   On the flip side, you're arguing over an $1800 car, not an $18,000 car so you have to decide what your time is worth.  Depending on what state you're in you may be able to negotiate the rental car payment, meaning in some states you're owed the loss of use expenses whether you actually rented a car or not. This is called ""cashing-out"" the rental (they pay you cash instead of payign the rental car company for XX more days). Note that in some states rental is only owed if the cost has actually been incurred. Call your state insurance department to ask which way it works in your state.  As /u/doctorblah noted you can consider keeping the salvage and selling it on your own. Make sure you look into the title/registration rules but it may be as simple as getting the car inspected and getting a new title and then you just drop and collision/comprehensive coverage you may have had on it and just keep driving it. If the car was damaged badly enough that it's in a tow lot somewhere then make sure you and the insurer are crystal clear on who's paying the towing and storage bills on it before you keep it."

Something like AFLAC as a personal policy would probably allow you to have both california and their policy without offsetting each other.   I work in STD for one of the largest big name insurance companies."
Insurance,3aa907,SingingSabre,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:38:15 2015 UTC,What is offered from my employer is Colonial Life. I'm considering this to supplement the STDI that the state of CA would provide. I'll compare with AFLAC and other policies. Is your company's rate comparable to ones I posted?
Insurance,3a8mx3,SomeAwesomeUser,3,Thu Jun 18 02:26:52 2015 UTC,"The $1500 is the deductible, yes? Most plans have a deductible for each insured, and have a family deductible for about twice that.   In any case, allowable rates for a global delivery charge can vary pretty wildly from network to network (and region to region), but I'll grab a round number that's on the low side: $2,000. That's approximately how much all of your doctor's visits and the delivery will cost. Add to that, you will have ultrasounds, lab work, a hospital bill, anesthesia, and so on. You're going to meet that single person deductible before you hold your baby, even if you have the most boring pregnancy ever.   The thing that will make the difference for you will be the Out of Pocket Maximum. How high is that? Compare the individual with family on that as well, because I promise you. . .as much as you swear you won't, you will bring that baby in for sick visits because of crazy ass reasons. (Unless you are me. I was ultra laid back with my first, and neurotic crazy with #2.)   Let me know if that was not helpful at all or if you have further questions."

That way you would know exactly how much you are responsible for and the rest will be covered by the insurance company.  To compare plans I would look at the deductible and hospital fees. Then see which would meet the out of pocket maximum first."

How does that work with the stuff from January - baby if it is later combined?"

Progressive, PGAC, etc. are a good start.   Acceptance Insurance does business there, and is often cheap.  If you're just looking to have an SR-22 to ride out the suspension, that might be a viable option.  Again, I wouldn't necessarily drive with their coverage, but it meets the requirements.  Also, you'd be well advised to get a doctor to consider your memory issues, as that may be relevant on the tickets and certainly is relevant whether you should drive.  I don't actually know anyone in SC who I can personally refer, unfortunately, but a call to the big non-standard carriers should get you taken care of - SR-22 for a DUS is a bit different than if it's for a DUI, for instance."

Insurance,3a8b44,skipper14,2,Thu Jun 18 01:49:32 2015 UTC,Most insurers will allow you to add n endorsement for customizations and it is usually not very expensive. Just make sure you specifically tell them that you have a customized car.
Insurance,3a8b44,f1shbone,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:55:22 2015 UTC,"OP, ""modifications"" means more than one thing. I am assuming you are not talking about modifications like motorized handicapped seat lifts, etc. On those, like /u/skipper14, you can easily get endorsements and cover them. But, I am assuming that in your situation you are talking about performance modifications. No insurance company will cover these dollar for dollar, because the modified parts market is extremely volatile and is hard to put a value on these parts. In the event of an accident, the insurance company will use OEM part prices as a starting point and from there you will have an opportunity to present evidence for the pricing of the parts, and negotiate on value. But it will never be dollar for dollar. Besides, performance mods are not particularly liked by insurance companies because of what they imply ... Make sure you document them with your agent when you take out a policy. Have the agent inspect the vehicle and take photos, so that will constitute proof. Value of car is likely to not go up, because a modified car won't fetch a higher price with the average market. It only has a higher price with a niche market. In fact, modified cars actually don't sell as well as stock cars on the regular market. People steer away from vehicles that were potentially driven hard.    PS: go Big Red? :) Used to live in Lincoln."

If the final police report didn't include them and their details, which if you can't supply them you're fucked, and you can prove they were the cause then they can be fired and prosecuted for gross misconduct in the performance of their duties.

Unfortunately most onlookers said things along the lines of ""should have just let her clip you"" since she blatantly ran a stop sign. It was not instinctual for me to allow someone to hit me, esp on my drivers side considering the risk. I felt the adjuster on the phone, despite being polite, told me that I'm fucked on the matter so I have no choice in biting the bullet and thanking whatever greater power that be that I walked away with no bodily harm to myself or others.   On a side note, to my utter shock, the owner of the vehicle that ran the stop sign lives on my block, just a few houses down.

If not, essentially this is a word vs word situation and at the end of the day you hit a parked car. When the owners of that parked car present a claim to your insurance, more than likely they will pay it. THere is no grounds for a denial here, it is factually established you caused that damage, and in the absence of being able to prove the other driver caused a hazard and forced you to avoid it, your insurance can't fight for you. Even if that were the case, avoiding one accident doesn't make it OK to cause another. You're still liable for the damages to the parked car."
Insurance,3a8og9,f1shbone,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"The ones that called 911, I believe were outside when the police arrived.

I don't know if anyone came forward or if the police took any other statements, I'm kind of doubting it however. I will know for sure when the accident report becomes available.   I was also dazed and flustered shortly after so I made the wrong move by not trying to get any info on witnesses/the woman herself, but the police did arrive a great deal more quickly than I would have expected (I figured I had time to compose myself and call the people I needed to call before moving on. tbh.)  I came to understand (from research and word of mouth) that I have no recourse in this instance and I understand that I'm liable for the parked car but I was hoping that if there was a strand of hope in the situation that the insurance company would take into account that driver that ran the stop sign, but like I said, the police said that because she had no damage on her car and she was free to go."

The police situation here is different, likely the cop let the other driver go without a citation because they weren't a witness to the situation. What surprises me, however, is the fact that they did not rely on the witness statements and I can only assume those people called the police to report the accident without any detail of running the stop sign, and then left the scene before giving a statement. LIkely the other person did not own up to their action, otherwise they would have been given a ticked based on their own admission."
Insurance,3a6v48,oxyrotten,4,Wed Jun 17 18:14:19 2015 UTC,NJ agent here- always make PIP primary. Its a very liberal coverage and simple. Choose your deductible and limit and you're done. Don't rely on health insurance as primary- too many other factors in play that can make you smash your face against a table if you have a PIP claim. Edit- apologize for the jargon OP- PIP = personal injury protection which is the medical payments for you/family that we are talking about under the auto insurance

Insurance,3a6v48,ferapy,2,Thu Jun 18 11:05:50 2015 UTC,"First, that is an option in New Jersey. And it does lower your rate, in some cases, considerably.  What it means is, your health insurance will pay your medical expenses related to your accident first, with your personal injury protection (PIP) paying second.  I would advise making sure your health insurance covers expenses related to automobile accidents, as some carriers do not.   If it does not or your health insurance coverage is not in effect at the time of an accident, your PIP will still cover up to its limits, with an additional $750 deductible on top of what your current deductible is, if one was selected.

If they own a vehicle and are uninsured, as far as I know, there will be no coverage for them."

Insurance,3a6v48,dan_232,3,Wed Jun 17 19:52:05 2015 UTC,Does anyone know anything about this?    I'm not familiar with NJ but auto insurance is primary in an auto accident if you have medical coverage on your auto policy but if you don't then your health insurance would become primary.   What are the drawbacks (there has to be something)?   You will be paying your deductible and copay for your health insurance. It's not waived because you have an auto accident AFAIK. Plus you won't have any medical coverage for your passengers which can be really bad if they don't have health insurance. If you also went without uninsured motorist bodily injury you're missing out on lost wages and pain and suffering as well if you're injured by an uninsured/underinsured driver.

Insurance,3a717s,Frank_Thorn,8,Wed Jun 17 18:57:39 2015 UTC,"Get your insurance company to send something in writing to you, then give it to the property manager.  What he's requesting sounds right when you think of it from a purely commercial insurance standpoint, but personal is something completely different and can cause big coverage issues.  Basically, your insurance company is trying to keep the owner from screwing himself in the event of a claim.  And he can't tell you who to do business with.  You can throw that other name/contact info in the trash if you want.  Or you can call to see if you can get better coverage for a better price.  It's your time and money and you're free to spend each as you choose.  Edited to add: unless the lease stipulates the additional insured wording (and you should check to be sure), you're under no obligation to get that.  Or the insurance if that isn't required (but most likely is)."
Insurance,3a717s,key2616,8,Wed Jun 17 19:48:00 2015 UTC,I believe they can be added as an 'additional interest' but not as an 'additional insured'. Additional insured means they would be covered at least somewhat by your policy. Additional interest just means that they would be notified if your policy changes or cancels. That's probably more along the lines of what they are looking.
Insurance,3a717s,BuckEm,2,Wed Jun 17 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"You can also see if the insurance company will list the property manager as an ""additional interest"" rather than an ""additional insured"".  The difference is that as an additional interest he would be notified by the carrier if your policy lapses, much like a lienholder would on your auto policy however he would have no coverage on the policy.  An additional insured would be entitled to the coverage on your policy. As the policy protects your personal belongings and liability the landlord would have no insurable interest and that's why the insurance company is hesitant to add him."
Insurance,3a717s,JeepGuy587,2,Wed Jun 17 21:21:33 2015 UTC,what does your lease say? If there is no mention of insurance requirements in the lease then tell them to go fly a kite. That being said- renters insurance is a good idea and is cheap. Lastly- naming the prop management company as additional insured under YOUR renters insurance? Someone over at that property management company needs to take a risk management 101 class. There are a variety of reasons why you do not name landlord/property manager as additional insured (not to be confused with additional interest) Here is a good recap of why you don't name landlords/management companies under your renters insurance: https://www.effectivecoverage.com/3913/why-should-my-landlord-be-landlord-additional-insured-on-my-renters-insurance/  additional insured is common in the commerical insurance world as its a different animal- but not in the personal insurance world.

I'm always nice because I've worked front line customer service jobs (IT help desk) and I know it's not the person on the phone's fault.  I usually fault on the side of too nice, frankly, and that frequently gets me nowhere until I find someone who actually gives a shit about the people who are calling in.   If it's not fixed today, I'm going to see if they will be kind enough to let me speak to an Ops supervisor. I've worked in IT for damn near 20 years, so I know how to talk to those guys.

Insurance,3a62r6,zardwiz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"My experience with UHC is that if you make weekly payments, you need to call them weekly to apply the payment.  It's a nightmare, but might prevent them thinking you just didn't pay it at all."
Insurance,3a62r6,zardwiz,2,Thu Jun 18 02:38:26 2015 UTC,"They are insufferably bad at that.  We have UHC, and I pay them in chunks - I'm a consultant, so it's easier to come up with $200 a week than almost a grand a month.   Every single month I have to call them and tell them to apply the payments, and every single month it takes them until at least the third to tell OptumRX (their PBM) that yes I paid the bill.  The first time I ran into this, I had popped into my local Kroger expecting to pick up anxiety meds, and the idiot at Optum actually said to the pharm tech ""He didn't pay his bill.""  My debit card statements said otherwise, so I was livid.  Magic words: ""I paid my bill, your system didn't apply it.  Escalate this NOW to someone who can fix it.  Oh, you can't?  OK, give me a supervisor.  Give me a supervisor.  Give me a supervisor.""  They never actually will transfer you to a sup, but they will send a ticket to escalate and apply the payments.  ""Their system just doesn't know how to deal with partial payments.""  UHC isn't horrible, all in (beats hell out of an HMO), but their PBM is useless and their billing system is atrocious.  I have never lost my mind on any company as much as on them.  Insurance commissioner might be a good choice if they're continuing to ""accept"" your payment but not ""apply"" it - if this continues, that's my next step..  The only reason we ended up with them in the first place is that Anthem is exclusively contracted to the lesser of the two hospitals in our city, and the better hospital doesn't take them at all so we went with the plan with options."
Insurance,3a62r6,zardwiz,2,Thu Jun 18 02:37:31 2015 UTC,"I think that might be the biggest insult - that they have told my providers that the policy was cancelled due to non-payment. Luckily for me, I have a long standing relationship with all of these people and they know that UHC's billing is FUBAR.   That still doesn't mitigate the rage and embarrassment that I felt when the pharmacy tech said that I'd have to pay over $400 out of pocket because the policy had been cancelled. I very nearly called UHC fuckers in public (I don't cuss where strangers can overhear, ever, especially not in a situation where someone might mistake where my anger is directed).  I'm still madder than hell, actually. I got a vicious headache after today's call thanks to my temper. Ugh."
Insurance,3a62r6,yettibeats,2,Thu Jun 18 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't take it out on the folks at the pharmacy, but I was embarassed beyond belief - I have always shown up with cash in hand, even when I didn't have insurance, and always paid them.  For the PBM to tell them that I just hadn't paid the bill sent me into a whirlwind of rage the like of which I have never seen before.  The best thing I can tell you is to call UHC the minute you make the payment and start raising hell at that point because it will take time for them to resolve.  It's embarassing, it's rage-inducing, and it's especially infuriating when they're screwing with my ability to get my blood pressure meds or my anxiety meds, but it is what it is.  Call you state's insurance department.  That's the only way their billing practices will change.  I was so angry I said to the poor offshore lady ""I don't know how things work there, but how we do business in America is that when someone pays us we apply the money to their account!""  Not my proudest moment, but that was quite literally the kindest thing I had to say.  I'm at the point now where I've clarified with UHC exactly what would need to be verified for a person other than myself to speak with them and next time I'll have my VA sit on the phone and scream at them.  For five bucks an hour, and not worrying about me having a stroke over their idiocy, it's worthwhile."

All I was trying to do was convey that there had been a collision and we needed medical assistance.  I was given a citation for failure to yield by the officer on the scene as she made her determination off the 911 call rather than my statement after the fact.

If I, as a biller, sent you a bill because I thought you were cash pay and you never contacted me to tell me that you had insurance, you are responsible. I understand you stated that the hospital told your wife that all the places would be updated, but again...if they are separate entities then the hospital isn't 100% responsible to forward the information, that ultimately relies on the patient.

Insurance,3a4bsd,Ryugi,2,Wed Jun 17 03:10:50 2015 UTC,"The third plan appears to be hands down the best for you assuming your mental health needs will be covered after the deductible is met. It will have the most comprehensive network between the 3 plans (silver network instead of bronze) and the deductible/annual maximum out of pocket is significantly lower. In your situation, I would be aiming to keep the deductible low, even if it means minimal coverage until the deductible is met.  This third plan is going to cause you to fork over a little more money upfront as the coverage pre-deductible is not as extensive as the others, but you WILL meet your deductible regardless.  Basically: Option 1 Guaranteed to pay $2000 a year in premium and potentially an additional $5,500 in deductible. Total Risk = $7,500 annually.  Option 2 Guaranteed to pay $2025 a year in premium and potentially an additional $6,350 in deductible, however, with this plan, preventative services are limited to a smaller co-payment with strict limitations and exclusions likely in place. Total Risk = $8,375 annually.  Option 3 Guaranteed to pay $2,338 a year in premium and likely an additional $3,500 in deductible. Like option one, this plan doesn't really cover preventative care. Total Risk = $5,838 annually.  It's a slight toss up between option 3 and option 2. There's a chance Option 2 works out better for you in a year if your health conditions remain consistent with nothing unexpected. If something unexpected happens, you'll be needing to dig up an extra $2,500 to cover your deductible. The primary issue with Option 2 is that you are limited to seeing your primary doctor to four times a year @ the $30 co-pay, after that, you are paying full cost, same as you would under the other two plans, but with a much higher deductible needing to be met.  TL;DR - Option 2 will likely provide the most consistent coverage if you can limit your trips to the doctor (most consistent bills, but leaves a much greater out of pocket risk than option 3). With option 3, your risk is greatly limited, but you will pay more in the first several months of the year until you have met your deductible. Once your deductible is met, all of your medical needs are taken care of at no additional cost to you outside of premium payments.  Edit: Option 3 also includes the option of having an HSA account which will effectively allow you to lower your taxable income for the year. If you could contribute an additional $300 per month to an HSA account, you would effectively cover all of your medical needs for $5,500 a year but pay taxes on $3,600 less than you would have under Option 2  Any other questions, ask away.  <Insurance Producer with an emphasis on Employee Benefits aka Health Insurance>"

Since these are PPO plans I can just go see the specialist I think I need to see right away at least, so that should help limit the overall number of trips (where with an HMO, anything more than a physical exam requires at least 3 separate trips to 3 separate locations).

They aren't there to cheat yououtof money or low ball anyone, they want to close the claim as smoothly and quickly as regulationsallow to move on. So by giving them an amount you'd like give them some room to move"

Even those are at an asking price of between 4 and 5k.   All I want is for each company to give me a similar amount. So if the other company gave me $2000 towards the car, is it so hard to ask for this from the other companies? (Or at least something more reasonable than $360...)  They have yet to discuss my pain and suffering settlement, can I assume they're going to lowball me on that as well? How do I bring it up?"
Insurance,3a2m9a,powdertoastman420,5,Tue Jun 16 19:39:18 2015 UTC,Your vehicle is insured for actual cash value. What you are talking about is replacement value which you won't get. Maybe see if you can keep the car and just take the money? If the car is not drivable I wouldn't recommend.
Insurance,3a2m9a,zardwiz,2,Tue Jun 16 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"Car is drivable... Have an update. The company valued my car as a 2002, not a 2007, which is a huge difference, and the rep hung up on me when I called her out on her error... Now it's a whole other battle. In googling the company, it seems there are many complaints against them, and I'm afraid I am going to have to consult a lawyer."

It doesn't scare insurance companies like people think it does, the company I work for has a floor full of lawyers who specialize in insurance. You can't really find them in the private sector for property damage. If a lawyer were to help you out they would take a chunk of your settlement and probably won't see anymore money out of it.  Depending on how you called out the adjuster they may have hung up on you for a reason. People can get upset at adjustersfor all kinds of reasons and believe or not we are people and make mistakes. The best way to get what you want is to be polite and nice, don't think any insurance company is out to screw you. You do that you're going to ha e a bad time."

She was super snarky, and it was very frustrating, which in turn raised my level of defense.    She tried to tell me that I told her my car was a 2002. I never did nor would I have. So when I corrected her and asked for a new valuation, that's when she hung up. I didn't yell at her, I wasn't demanding."
Insurance,3a2m9a,pichicagoattorney,2,Tue Jun 16 20:57:20 2015 UTC,She might have hung up to run a new evaluation. You have to be patient and work with the adjuster. People make mistakes all the time.

Second, you can get an umbrella policy to increase your personal liability limits.  I still wouldn't teach anywhere that doesn't have a commercial policy in place like your primary site does.  In comparison with all your primary coverage (home, auto, bike, boat...), you'll probably find an umbrella to be surprisingly cheap.  BUT you may end up having to increase your primary limits to meet the requirements of the umbrella policy, which will make it a more expensive investment overall.  But I think it's a good idea for someone with your exposures."

So for example one week into your two weeks without insurance, you break your leg and have to go to the hospital. No problem! Go to the hospital and tell the hospital to bill you. Let the insurance company know that you are electing to take your COBRA coverage and they back date it to the day that you lost coverage through your employer. Let's say you don't have an accident and everything is fine for those two weeks. No problem! Start your new plan then. I advise people to do this all the time.

I can't tell just from stating that you collided with a vehicle while turning. This falls under your Collison coverage. If you only have comprehensive, your vehicle damage will not be covered. If you're covered, you will be offered a total loss settlement. Total loss is determined when the damage to the vehicle exceeds a percentage of the value of the car. This percentage differs in some states. Your liability coverage will pay for the other vehicles damages. Likely consequences of this loss: increased premium regardless if you stay with the same company or change. Side note, if your vehicle is not drivable - get it out of the shop! Get it moved to your home or some place that will not charge storage. Every day it sits in a shop, they will charge storage for when its eventually removed (if no repairs take place).

I have a policy where the insured has 20 homes and they are constantly, buying, selling, and renting them out.  They are all on one policy and it's pretty easy to manage so yes, there is something out there for you.  Make sure you have coverage for the homes any time they are vacant as well.  Many policies exclude coverage if the home is vacant.     Each property management company we sign leases with require us to have a general liability policy covering their units in the event one of our occupants starts a fire or otherwise damages the property.

It is unlikely that anyone who is truly suicidal, will, or can wait two years to collect.  It is extremely rare for any carrier to be more generous than the law requires. The reality is the carrier is protecting all the other members from in paying on claims taht barely paid in.   Remember, when you get any kind of insurance, you are essentially getting into a club of say 50,00 people. They all pool their money together and promise each other that if something goes bad with one family, the other 49,999 families would step in and take care of it.

Keeping this business in surplus lines is technically running foul of the rules.  As a fellow CT independent though I can tell you most of the people I've spoken with are just looking the other way and letting this business renew.  Could this constitute an E&O exposure?  Most definitely.    The reason we are suppose to place this stuff in admitted markets is those policies are guaranteed by the state insurance guaranty fund.  If one of these surplus carriers goes belly up & can't pay out on claims you could be sued by the insured.  Do I think that's likely to happen?  Not at all, but that's the risk.

Her claim rep will be able to verify this but the policy is typically written to cover the insured with at least the minim coverage of whatever state she was in. There can always be exceptions to this. Did she make a permanent move to the new state and notify her carrier? Was she just visiting the state? These all can factor in to the coverage. Priority should be to notify her carrier and let a claim determine coverage. Good luck!

Insurance,39ybz6,f1shbone,3,Tue Jun 16 14:00:40 2015 UTC,"No-fault generally refers to bodily injury, not physical damage.  In either state, she's going to pay to fix the other car.  Her Liability limits will pay for the other vehicle, and her Collision coverage will pay to fix her car (if she has it)."
Insurance,39ybz6,key2616,7,Mon Jun 15 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"Michigan has limited tort for damage to a motor vehicle if it is being  driven, you are liable for what the other person is personally responsible  for up to $1000.  So if you are at fault for an accident and the other person doesn't carry collison the most they can recover is $1000, if the other person has a $500 deductible  you would owe $500, however many  people in Michigan carry broad form collision which waives the deductible  if you are not at fault  which means that the at fault party doesn't  have to pay for any of the damages.  It is actually a separate  coverage  you purchase a part from regular liability coverage and it is optional so some people try to save a buck and end up having to pay other people's  deductibles out of pocket.  To make this even stranger motorcycles are not able to collect even the limited tort if they are hit while being ridden.  So you could plow through a group of motor cycle riders but they can't  hold you liable for the damage to their bikes.  And this only scratches the surface  of weird Michigan insurance laws."
Insurance,39ybz6,northofindy,2,Mon Jun 15 22:46:56 2015 UTC,"As somebody who works with a bunch of states not including Michigan, that is insanely weird. Can anyone elaborate on the real benefits of this? It sounds like whoever is NAF just gets kind of screwed."
Insurance,39ybz6,halfanapplepie,2,Tue Jun 16 02:39:50 2015 UTC,There really isn't any.  It is a really screwed up situation.  Michigan also has unlimited lifetime PIP benefits.  Motorcycles generally don't carry PIP but if they are involved in a loss with a car the motorcyclist can get PIP from the policy on the car they hit regardless of fault!  So a guy on a motorcycle rear ends your truck at 70 mph and the truck's PIP has to pay for the motorcyclists injuries.
Insurance,39ybz6,northofindy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:18:11 2015 UTC,In Michigan your no fault coverage even extends to covering the damage to an airplane crashing into your vehicle.   http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2005/12/22/63396.htm
Insurance,39ybz6,mikeincolumbus,2,Tue Jun 16 22:48:40 2015 UTC,That's hilarious
Insurance,39ybz6,northofindy,2,Tue Jun 16 23:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, Michigan is a state I handle. The state wanted to reduce lawsuits filed in the state so they deemed all 2+ moving vehicle auto accidents to be filed through each drivers/owners insurance. This means even if you are at fault, the other party cannot recover through you. This was meant to reduct costs for the state, which it did. However MI is now one of the most expensive states to get insurance in, inside the US. There are a few things to work around this, such you CAN however recover your deductible through the other insurance. Also, if 1 verhicle is parked, it is handled fairly normally in comparison to most other states. You can also puchase a coverage that waives your deductible if you are not at fault. I personally recommend it, because the amount of Hit and Runs in Michigan are also super high because most people think ""its a no fault state,  they'll  file through their own insurance."" Edit: Spelling"
Insurance,39ybz6,MrFoolsDay,2,Thu Jun 18 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"Everything you wrote is correct, but I want to point out that the loss took place in Illinois and the laws of Illinois apply to this accident. Source: claims analyst for both of these states."
Insurance,39ybz6,f1shbone,3,Tue Jun 16 14:01:44 2015 UTC,Her insurance  has  liability limits that protect her while driving out of state. Since the loss did not occur in Michigan she will be liable to pay for the other party's  property damage (this will be paid through her  property damage liability coverage) .  She needs to contact her insurance asap and ask what liability limits she carries.  Michigan minimums are 20/40/10 but Illinois minimums are 25/50/20.  So even if she only carries Michigan minimums most (all?) carriers should increase  her limits to match the requirements  of the state the loss occurred in.
Insurance,39ybz6,northofindy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:32:20 2015 UTC,"Very likely that she still has some normal insurance limits for this situation. Contact your insurance company, but you are probably covered. You will need to ask about this in particular, but this is fairly common."

Insurance,39zgjk,Yamuddah,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:03:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly there isn't going to be a way for you to avoid paying a high cost, at least for the first 6 months. You have no ""experience"" as far as insurance is concerned and you will be made the primary operator on one of the vehicles (this is guaranteed if you have two vehicles).  If the quotes you have been getting are to high I would recommend holding off on getting the second vehicle until you have been insured for at least 6 months. If you can't afford the insurance then you can't afford the vehicle."
Insurance,39zgjk,Cicatrized,-2,Tue Jun 16 15:03:57 2015 UTC,"First, say youll be driving the older car, and your boyfriend (with an established insurance history) will be driving the car that has full coverage.  Second, make sure the person with the better credit score is the applicant.  If your not sure who that is, have him call the company to get a quote with the insurance in his name and with you as an added driver.  Then you call/have him hand you the phone, and get a quote in your name with him as the added driver.  If all of those quotes are too high, say ""I'm sorry, we can't swing that kind of money. We just had a baby"". Being a parent gets you a much lower rate with some companies!"
Insurance,39zgjk,Poisonouskiwi,3,Tue Jun 16 11:17:13 2015 UTC,"That's terrible advice at the end. You're advising them to commit fraud. They will get caught and possibly have their coverage cancelled because of that. We don't tell people to do things like that here.   OP, the first part about options is good, but don't lie. Find a local agent and see about bundling your Auto coverage with Renters. Things like getting married help too, but that's obviously a different decision."
Insurance,39zgjk,key2616,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:00:47 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  And you're right, they shouldn't lie.  I'm sorry I said that.

So you will likely want to consider ""Cobra cost"" over your new employer plan - depending on the new payroll deduction vs expected cost over the rest of your existing plan year, you may want to take advantage of the existing met Out of pocket maximum, or not."
Insurance,39z64o,IAmTheOracle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:36:01 2015 UTC,"If I do COBRA and continue my current insurance, can I switch over to the new plan in Jan next year?  Or do I need to wait for a qualifying life event?  In numbers:  So the new Out of Pocket Maximum at the new employer is $2,500.  Plan premiums are $110 every 2 weeks.  26 weeks remaining means total cost of $3,930.  The full premium (my contribution + employer's contribution) at current employer is $2,300 annually.  Half of year left by the time I quit, so $1,150 remaining for the year since I've already hit my out of pocket max and just need to pay premiums.  So, for this year alone, sounds like sticking with my current plan is the better deal.  But next year when the out of pocket max resets, the new plan is definitely better.  How/When can I switch from Cobra coverage using my existing plan to the new employer's plan?"
Insurance,39z64o,camaro_ssdr,2,Tue Jun 16 15:40:34 2015 UTC,You will actually pay the full price of insurance for cobra which is most likely triple the price. There is no way that yours plus employers is only $150 a month.

So when an insurance company runs your record - and they will, I promise - they will see that ticket.

You could take it to any shop you would like, although the GEICO warranty would only apply to the affiliated body shop.

I'm trying to limit the amount of time I have a rental. As soon as I land, I want to go to the dealership and get the car, then return the rental a few hours later. ($70+ down the drain.. Ugh.)

Give your agent the VIN, and the date you're picking up the car, and he should be able to put the policy into effect, and get you the necessary docs by fax or email.  Have your salesman approve them before you go in, and it's one less thing to worry about on the day of."

Insurance,39wq5h,MmeJGhast,6,Mon Jun 15 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"The thing to know is, your adjuster doesn't care about the money. His main concern is not the bottom line. The money doesn't matter to anybody until two or three levels of management up. Seriously, the myth of adjusters getting some kind of bonus for paying less... I don't know, maybe it's been true some time in the past, but it's absolutely not nowadays.   He's got two goals that conflict with each other:   He wants to get you off his desk as quick and easy as he can. He's got to pass his audits.    Do you see how these conflict with each other? If all he had were #1, then you and he would have a conversation like this:   ""How much will it take for you to be satisfied and not call me again?""   ""$10,000""   ""Fine. Here's the check, here's the release form, sign this, thank you, have a nice day.""   Right?   But he can't do that, because his company audits his files. If he just throws the money around without any explanation, he gets fired. So he's got to produce enough explanation for what he's doing to satisfy people. He has to make a diagram of the area, and have notes on what's damaged. He needs a copy of the lease for wherever you're staying that he's got to pay for. He's got to have the brand and model for each piece of furniture he's paying to replace.   Getting along is a matter of making it easy for him to help you. So for example on the housing question, this is hard: ""I need a place to live, pleeeeeease!""   But this is easy: ""I found a listing for a furnished townhome just a few miles from where I was. Utilities and furnishings are included in the price, so the rent is real high, but rent will be the only thing I need to claim. Same number of beds and baths that I had before, what do you think, can you cover that for me?"" He'll love you if you do that. Having to write checks for one rent bill is so much easier than rent, plus, furnishings, plus utilities, plus laundromats, plus some calculations for how much more gas than usual based on the distance, plus, plus, plus. See what I mean?   The money just needs to be reasonable, it doesn't need to be cheap. So, to have a good claim, think about what's going to make it easy for him to help you.   And if you run into any particular questions, come ask us. :)"

Adjusters will do their best to ignore any hidden damage unless it is brought to their attention.  Consider asking them to bring an industrial hygienist out if there could be a mold issue. (Though they will sometimes refuse to pay much for mold.)   Also, make sure a good restoration contractor evaluates the damage and agrees with the adjuster on the cost of repairs. Many contractors don't know much about repairing water and smoke damage.  Worst case scenario: Be prepared for a long fight."

If after you have talked to someone at the insurance you feel like you need clarification or missed something call back and get more information. However if your not getting an answer you want stay calm and rational. Getting empathy out of people gets things done better than if you start to yell at them.  The Big thing with BlueCross BlueSheild that people don't understand is that BCBS is 36+ different companies. Some of the Blues are national networks, some are only in one state or area but operate under BCBS Association guidelines. They often do share resources to an extent. Some Blues are national networks and some are local only. Many providers actually do not understand this and will tell you ""We are contracted with our local"" you'll believe them and go in and end up out of network. Your plan may even give you access to a national Blue network.  Is your insurance through your employer? If so then they may have other plans in your new area."

This means your friend will need to either have a legal lease agreement typed up or sell you the vehicle. If he has a lease typed up your insurer might not allow you to insure it since it is not leased through a registered company.   You will have a lot of hassle setting up a policy under your name. Your best option is to keep it insured under his name, but update the policy to list you as the driver and insure it at your address.  Even if you insure it under your name, he will still be required to have his own policy anyway since he has a loan on the vehicle.  As for your second question, no, insurance is not enough to get the vehicle out of a tow lot. You need to provide proof of ownership."

Insurance,39v4vr,AstroZombi3,4,Mon Jun 15 07:44:48 2015 UTC,"This is technically 2 different losses, 2 different claims, 2 different deductibles. So yes, you'd have to pay 2 deductibles. Some people try to do a 'claim all' where they report one claim for multiple losses. An inspector is usually able to discern the different losses in one vehicle."
Insurance,39v4vr,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm not trying to report multiple damages in one claim. Just wondering since the repairs overlap and I'm doing them at one shop, if there were some way of lowering the costs (both for me and my insurer) so things aren't doubled, as they appear to be right now. I've already seen the appraiser at the shop for the first accident, but they haven't seen this second accident's damages yet..."
Insurance,39v4vr,Zen_Drifter,3,Mon Jun 15 02:34:55 2015 UTC,"Two claims, two occurrences, two deductibles.   Yes you have $1,000 in deductibles.  It's likely there is some overlap in the damage estimates which may mitigate the amount you owe if the insurer didn't bother to account for it and the shop accounts for it in your bill. Maybe not $500 but at least some of the labor.  For example a fender replacement/repair normally requires the front bumper to be removed and then reinstalled after the fender is painted. They are also removing the bumper for the second claim when they replace your bumper. So assuming it's on both estimates you're getting paid twice by the insurer to do something that only needs to be done once by the shop.  Whether there is any actual labor overlap depends on how anal the appraiser was when he wrote the second estimate. Technically, they don't owe you anything on the second estimate that was already paid on the first estimate if the first claim hadn't been repaired yet and you were having it all fixed at the same time. In theory you could actually make them pay some of the labor (not the parts) twice if you actually had the repairs done at separate times. But of course it makes no sense to do it that way in most cases.  If the appraiser works for one of those companies where a supervisor or reinspector follows him around with a clipboard all day grading everything he does then there is likely to be little overlap.   If the overlap is bumper labor and removing and reinstalling a few parts here and there then possibly nobody cares and the shop can knock a few bucks off."
Insurance,39v4vr,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"Right, so if it involves additional parts aside from those damaged in the first accident, then maybe the appraiser won't account for those additional parts a second time? Does that make sense? I also don't want my insurance company paying twice for parts that were needed in both accidents; though they're different claims, I'm still having repairs done all at once and not separately. Same labor and same parts for those involved in the first accident. Second accident has more extensive damage. I haven't gotten an estimate on the second accident's damages yet, but the first is about $2500 already..."
Insurance,39v4vr,britt5689,2,Mon Jun 15 02:29:04 2015 UTC,"Well it's possible that the combined damages will total the car I suppose, depending on how valuable the car is. If that happens they'll probably just pay you a total loss for the second claim and deduct what they paid you on the first claim. End of problem.   It's unlikely that you'll be paid twice for the same parts on two different claims filed within a short time period with the same company. You may end up with the exact same appraiser anyway. I handle situations like this a couple times a year. If the labor overlap is minor, like having to take the bumper off, I just shrug and pay it. This isn't because I don't care. It's because I don't want to have to explain it all to whatever shop it goes to and then have to waste more time untangling what was paid on what claim and what wasn't when they send in the supplements for additional damages on both claims."
Insurance,39v4vr,extra_wbs,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:38:19 2015 UTC,"I know you work in different states from where I reside, but I'm curious to know what would define a car as a total loss? From what I can see, the entire front frame before the windshield needs new parts, and I'm certain there is internal damage since the front of the car (a Civic) now looks as short as a Prius's front end. The airbag deployed too, so it's not driveable."
Insurance,39uzkj,insan3guy,3,Mon Jun 15 00:42:05 2015 UTC,"Just to answer a few:  Bodily Injury limits protect the other party involved in an accident, most states require you have bodily injury limits. This is the ""liability"" portion. Medical payments are typically not required, but would work to protect yourself, and more importantly, any riders you may have. Otherwise they may be SOL if you are in an accident.  Collision insurance is expensive because that covers you in case you're the one at fault for an accident. If you get hit by someone else, their insurance would pick up, yours would not (unless they have inadequate limits, or no insurance at all, in which case you should carry uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance.  Most insurance companies require you to insure the vehicle at the address it will be garaged at most of the time. In this case, it would be California or you may find a claim denied.  Hope I helped :-)  edit: I sold insurance in a military town for awhile. If you've completed any driving courses required by the military, you may be able to register that as defensive driving/driver's training depending on state laws & the company you're with."

Collision is expensive because you are probably under 25. A lot of it has to do with the odds of you crashing it and all the cars in Cali, but up to 25, it will gradually drop as long as you don't have an accident or get a ticket that stays on your record.    If someone hits you, Tricare will kick in and cover you if they don't have enough insurance or any insurance. You can also purchase UM/UIM for no insurance/not enough insurance (under insured) to help cover the costs since they will probably be high if you get hit on a bike, so be careful.   It depends on the company, but USAA will/can do it for Washington, Gieco might as well (it also specializes in the military, but USAA is better, call them both and decide or even Progressive, but they don't specialize in military).   But USAA is generally a better company (I've worked for many insurance companies, USAA being one of them, but they employ a lot of ex-military people).   Hope that helps man."
Insurance,39uzkj,VodkaAndDietSprite,2,Mon Jun 15 03:20:06 2015 UTC,"It does, thanks.  Just to be clear though - collision covers your vehicle if you are at fault, whereas liability covers the other vehicle?"
Insurance,39uzkj,VodkaAndDietSprite,2,Mon Jun 15 04:11:16 2015 UTC,"You got it!  Also, if the other person doesn't have enough insurance to cover your bike or doesn't have any insurance, you can use your collision coverage to replace the bike. State minimum is 10k though, so you should be good, unless they don't have insurance, then you just have to use yours, pay your deductible, and sue them in small claims court for the deductible. I do know that USAA will go after the person for your deductible, so again, that's why I suggest them for active military since they specialize in it and can take care of your shit if you're deployed (like if the bike is stolen, or a friend/family member is using it and crashes it, etc.) much easier than other companies, but again, check with others as well. USAA can be pricey for young people and the price is also based on your rank, higher the rank, lower the cost, just an FYI. Let me know if you have any other questions or need any other help.

Insurance,39uzkj,VodkaAndDietSprite,2,Mon Jun 15 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"First, if you owe money on it, the bank requires that you do, so that's a yes if it's financed.   If not, then how much is hte bike worth and how much is the cost of collision? At least keep comprehensive (or ""comp"" as they call it in the industry), that is cheap and covers anything other than collision, like theft, fire, hail, hitting an animal, anything other than crashing it (animals don't count as a crash since they are unpredictable). But if the bike is not worth that much, then it's not worth to have it, but again, if I know the costs I can advise better.  Also, if you crash it, do you have enough cash to buy another bike or vehicle? Or at least finance another vehicle? That's something to consider as well. If not, then again, having it might be worth it, but I also need to know the costs as it might be better to save that extra money into purchasing another bike.  Second, how long have you been using a bike? If you are new to it, odds of crashing it are high. If you've been riding for three to five years, odds of crashing it are much lower.   You are right though, driving a bike in Cali makes the odds of crashing it are high since you are new to the area and it is a target for other cars (hard to see), but I don't know where you are stationed, but still, all that has to do with the other questions I asked. Let me know the answers to the questions and I'll advise with better clarity and explanation as to what is most likely to be best for you, but it is ultimately up to you (I have to throw that in there to protect myself since I am a licensed agent, but not your agent)."

It cost me $16,500 (debeers conspiracy yada yada bullshit- it's the ring she fantasized about her whole life so it's worth it).  She lost it three months into the engagement. Insurance fully covered a new one. I have about 360 years of her not losing the ring before I start losing money on the deal.  All our cars are maxed out in coverage. I found out too late how well car insurance works, especially with how you can stack policies in Va. I was a passenger in a car accident and lost the use of my right arm for 2 years. After medical insurance, payment plans, insurance payouts from car insurance, begging and pleading I had about $120k in leftover medical debt.  With a 3.6 GPA at the university of Virginia with a double major in biology & economics with a minor in chemistry, a masters in bio from Johns Hopkins and a 41 on my MCAT. The debt kept me out of medical school because no one would loan me the money. Had I not kept the lowest possible policy my car insurance would have covered the rest.

I think I'm leaning toward a compromise, where we drop the bands from the coverage, but keep the engagement ring, since we picked it out together and had it custom made.  That sounds horrible about the accident. Hope you've been able to get back on your feet. I was only looking to drop the collision part off my insurance, which from my understanding only covers damage to my vehicle if I'm at fault in an accident.

I don't think I'd drop collision on a $15-$20k car just because you have double that in your emergency fund. A $5k or $7k car sure.  It doesn't have to be an ""all-or-nothing"" proposition. You can dump collision but keep comprehensive. You can dump collision and add much cheaper Uninsured Motorists Property Damage coverage (UMPD) if it is sold in your state. (Sometimes it's just a sub-coverage under Uninsured Motorists (UM)) This is basically collision insurance, but only for accidents that are not your fault. You can also raise your deductible to $1000 (or even higher if your insurer allows).  Dropping to just comprehensive coverage leaves it covered for a lot of ""not-my-fault"" damages like somebody breaking into it, trees falling on it, squirrels or mice deciding they want to set up house in it, etc...  IMHO the main benefit of having collision on an old car is actually that when it gets wrecked and totaled then the problem of paying the tow bill, storage bill, and the time and cost of getting rid of the wrecked car become the insurer's problem and not yours.  Aside from that collision coverage for an old car is kind of a waste of money."

So between towing it from an accident scene, storage, and then towing it to your house until you can figure out what to do with it, maybe a couple hundred dollars. In your case since you have a place to put it it's only a headache if you crash it far from home.   Salvage averages 25% but varies by age of the car, location of damage, mileage, and desirability of the car. So ten $4,000 cars would average out to about a $1,000 post-accident salvage value.  For a $4,000 car maybe I'd dump collision anyway, especially if you rarely drive or have accidents. Ideally, don't reabsorb the money into your budget but set it aside as a down payment on the next car."
Insurance,39texj,wishiwasyou333,3,Sun Jun 14 20:24:06 2015 UTC,"You got a lot of good information so far. I've always told people that have comp/coll if they can not reasonably afford to lose their vehicle. By that I mean, if you woke up tomorrow, walked to your parking spot, and saw your car would you think, ""we're royally fucked?"" Or would you think, ""Huh, this sucks...oh well."" I've had insured's who didn't care what happened to their car because it was a piece of junk and they could get another piece of junk.   Another thing that collision does is it incentivizes your insurance company to fight on your behalf. If it is a word versus word car accident, your insurance company would probably put you not at-fault for the accident and close your claim. No arbitration, subrogation, or anything (unless the other company goes after you). With collision, the other insurance company has an interest in getting your money back, mainly because that means they get paid. As an adjuster, if my insured didn't have collision, I really didn't care of the ""other person was lying"" and the other person was at-fault. There was nothing I could do."

If you are borrowing a friends car irregularly and you two aren't household members, you can take it without worrying and will be covered by his insurance.   The rule is, if you are household members or use it regularly you need to be added as a driver."

Insurance,39uc4k,dustyaguas,3,Sun Jun 14 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"I used to sell personal lines insurance a few years ago.  To start, Infinity Auto is considered a ""Non-Standard"" carrier.  What that means, is that the clients that Infinity is willing to insure are much riskier than the typically insurance consumer and thus, unless there are some very unusual circumstances, their premium charges are going to be substantially higher than your more common household insurers (Allstate, Statefarm, Nationwide, plenty of others).  Presumably, your agent placed you with Infinity (at least initially) for a reason.  Here are the most common reasons: a) Poor loss experience (aka too many accidents) b)Low Insurance Credit score (similar to a FICO score, but determines the likliehood that a claimant retains a small/nuisance claim) c) Lapse in insurance coverage (failure to maintain insurance for a continuous 6 months - year).  In some cases, I've seen where simply selecting low limits of liability placed someone in a non-standard category, and that always got my goat.  As for the accidents, most insurers look back 3 years for accidents, so the Aug 11 accident shouldn't matter.  If the May 2015 accident was truly ruled as 100% the other driver's fault, that fact may not be showing up in your agent's MVR.  You may need some type of proof showing that your claim was subrogated against the other person's insurance so your agent can remove that record from their rating.  I imagine that if you can get that accident removed, your rates will drop tremendously.  I forget if auto insurers look back 3 or 5 years for tickets, and I'm not sure how old you are now, so I can't be sure if that ticket is affecting your rates.  If you happen to be a younger guy, that will also contribute to your high premium.  I'd recommend looking into how your third accident is being rated.  Aside from that, the best advice is to shop around with different carriers.  Speak to an independent agent (someone who can quote with multiple insurers), or call around the local agencies.  If your rates go up in 6 months, feel free to shop around again.  Switching carriers is a relatively quick and easy process.  Keep in mind that price isn't necessarily everything, so if you find an agent that you like and that works hard, try to stick with them if it's only a matter of a few dollars per month."

Insurance,39sz8n,Schmidtzy,7,Sun Jun 14 15:47:50 2015 UTC,Yeah body work isn't cheap. I'm not sure why everyone assumes it is. You're not just paying for parts and paint. Labor isn't cheap and sometimes makes up half of the cost. You can ask them to get another estimate somewhere else but they don't have to.   If you file a claim this will fall under Property Damage Liability which means you won't have to pay a deductible to fix their vehicle. If you decide to pay out of pocket make sure you get them to sign a release of liability form for this accident. If you don't then they can file a claim through your insurer and collect double the amount of money as you'll have no proof you paid them.
Insurance,39sz8n,dan_232,6,Sun Jun 14 14:22:10 2015 UTC,Body work isn't cheap. Seems pretty reasonable.
Insurance,39sz8n,Stones_throw75,3,Sun Jun 14 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right to me.   Based on the reflections it appears your mirror actually creased the panel, not just scratched it. Your bumper also rubbed the lower part of the quarter dogleg and the door.   I don't see where it needs any parts unless the tail light got gouged. The body shop will probably remove the quarter glass to do the paint work.  If there is a charge for a replacement wheel on the estimate then I'd be looking to see if it's a remanufactured one, which should be ~$180 or so depending where you are, not a $450 OEM wheel.   If you're young/new driver maybe you might want to pay it, but just remember that 99% of personal auto policies don't have a deductible that's applicable to a liability claim. The deductible should only apply to damages to your own vehicle.  Also don't forget that you're also probably on the hook for another $150-$200 for a rental car while this is being fixed, if the owner wants one."

I don't understand why, I'm offering a real solution that could be available to this person.  just because its cheaper than the local body shop.  $1650 is ridiculous and the mobile ""Paintless"" Dent guy can fix this for around $250 to $500 and do exactly what a body shop can do."
Insurance,39q8ea,ribnag,3,Sat Jun 13 18:16:57 2015 UTC,Assuming you're in the US...Different states have different regulations about what traffic violations can/can't be factored into insurance rates and what experience period can be used (typically past 36-60 months preceding the policy effective date). Insurance rates increase and decrease for many reasons so I doubt your one ticket is the sole reason for your premium increase. Best option is to sit down with an agent and have them shop around for you.
Insurance,39q8ea,forneusFQ,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that - So it sounds like I do have some hope that after five years (60 months) it will go back down?  Maine, for reference.  As an aside (and I don't mean this defensively), yes, that one ticket doubled my rate.  I have no other dings against my license in 20+ years (not even a parking ticket), I have near-perfect credit (over 800), and nothing else significant in my life has changed in the past five years.

What I'm saying is that even if you had no claims and a spotless record your premium still might increase.  Here's an example that was brought up a week or so ago.  It's not uncommon for one company to raise rates on all customers in a particular area if they've been unprofitable in that region.  That's why I suggest shopping around.  Maybe you won't find any cheaper options but you very well might."

Insurance,39q8ea,iwearacloudonmyback,2,Sat Jun 13 21:21:42 2015 UTC,"That's a significant overage, which likely caused such a large increase.  It may have just happened to be surcharged at a time when there was also a general increase for your area or company.  You can ask your agent if there is anything you can do to help with that (maybe a defensive driving course).  You can also request that your policy be looked at (preferably face to face with your agent - if you don't have one, I would start looking for one with your company) to see if you have any potential savings in your policy.  Likely, you're stuck for a bit until your points/citations fall off.  You can also shop for a higher level policy that offers forgiveness for moving violations.   As an aside, if you can't get a satisfactory reason from your insurer, you can contact the department of insurance for your state - they will know what the deal is on any blanket increases, or can investigate if you feel that you're rates have not increased fairly/reasonably (such a high ticket will be hard for you to stand on, be aware)."

The floor can be ""fixed"" by chopping out a few boards and nailing or replacing a little of the underlayment, then refinishing the bad spot. But it's going to look like a patch job and most likely buckle again and develop squeaks.  If it's bad enough that it's buckled, the entire section where it buckled and anything adjacent that got wet will need to be removed, all the wet/damp/damaged underlayment will need to be replaced, then the hardwood flooring itself replaced, and then the entire floor including attached rooms that also have wood flooring will need to be refinished.

Insurance,39lkyh,hyukhyuk,9,Fri Jun 12 16:14:59 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I wouldn't be too worried.   The insurance company is going to try their best to get the other party to sign a release of all claims for your policy limits or below. Unless it is an extremely serious injury, you have substantial liquid assets, and/or you have a policy with extremely low BI limits, 99% of the time it is going to settle within policy limits.  Look at it this way, PI attorneys hate going to court. It's expensive, time consuming and a bit of a gamble because the end judgment can be less than what the insurance company originally offered to settle for. Because of that most will convince their clients to accept policy limits or less to avoid litigation.  TL;DR: though it's possible that you will go over limit, in reality you likely won't.  Also - Look into getting a personal umbrella policy. 300/300 will usually satisfy the underlying limit requirement and $1MM in coverage is usually dirt cheap. For me (single male, one vehicle, one accident and one ticket) it's $170/year and it also extends to my uninsured coverage so I can use it if someone hits me and is un/underinsured."

Insurance,39lkyh,heartbubbles,6,Fri Jun 12 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"If both cars were totaled, this isn't a 'minor' accident. It's quite major. In my state, a 'minor' accident is under $2000 in damage.  $300k is a fair bit, but if there are neck and back injuries, medical bills, physical training, and then pain and suffering claims, it could potentially be higher than that. I doubt even an adjuster could give you much more detail without knowing the extent of injuries."
Insurance,39lkyh,hoppityhoppity,2,Fri Jun 12 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"yeah I shoudnt say minor, I meant that neither suffered major injuries or had to spend overnight in a hospital. I spoke again with my adjuster and he said that he was surprised that its taking this long and he said I shouldn't worry about litigation, the injuries were not significant, they are just having a hard time getting the lawyer to submit their paperwork. thanks for your thoughts!"
Insurance,39lkyh,hoppityhoppity,3,Fri Jun 12 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar situation. I rear ended someone going under 15 mph, no airbags deployed, and the driver of the other car demanded an ambulance. She's suing me for 750k. My husband and father in law are both attorneys and they laughed and said not to worry, that it's frivolous and insurance will likely settle for pennies... It still makes me nervous though."
Insurance,39lkyh,E-Double,6,Fri Jun 12 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"How many people were involved in the accident (passengers in either car, or just the driver you mention)?  300K is a lot of money, really, but if there are multiple injured parties, or catastrophic injuries, that can be exhausted quickly (but these are typically easily noted at the scene).  Were you found to be 100% at fault?  Now, if it looks like you could be exceeding the limits, you should be hearing from your adjuster, advising you of the situation.  It allows the insured to be prepared for a suit, and to gather additional funds if they wish.  If you were to be sued, you would find out very quickly (but your insurance company would represent you).  Even if the claimant hasn't sued, but has retained an attorney, you should be notified.  The statute of limitations in Texas is 2 years.  If the injured party is a minor, it's typically 2 years after they become the age of majority (so, 20 years old would be the statute).  Honestly, with airbag deployment, and not insignificant damage, then I wouldn't be surprised if the other driver treated with a PT or chiropractor for an extended amount of time, or continued to seek some other form of treatment.  Did the driver have any injuries like lacerations or any broken bones (those are usually fairly obvious at the scene)?  You say totaled - how much was paid out on your claim, for each vehicle?  Totaled has a very different meaning for a big, expensive truck versus a small, beater car.    I really wouldn't worry at this point.  You can't force the claim along.  The other driver will have to demonstrate that any treatment or damages sought are reasonable & directly a result of the accident - their medical records, the extent of property damage, any past medical history, billing, and such is all closely evaluated.  Your insurance company will evaluate her claim presented for that criteria.  There really is no hard & fast rule for payout on a liability claim (and certainly nothing like 2 or 3 times medical bills, like many attorney advertisements claim).  Like I said, 300K is good coverage, and unless there is something major going on, I would expect it to settle far, far below that.   Fatalities and severe objective injuries (extensive lacerations, scarring, broken bones, etc) usually would be the concern for exceeding your policy limits, and it doesn't sound like any of this happened here.  Sometimes people just don't want/aren't ready to settle their claims - they are still treating or having issues stemming from the accident, are worried that they would, are thinking of hiring a lawyer, are in disagreement with the adjuster re: settlement offers, or are just unreachable (I've had all of these & more for claimants).  The adjuster should be able to tell you the general status of the claim, although they can't release any personal health information.  Honestly, you're about 7 months in, I really wouldn't worry too much at this point.  Edit: I just read in another comment that the claimant has a lawyer (can you update your original post?).  Legally, and technically, having a lawyer does not entitle them to any more funds.  If they're just trying to submit paper work (a demand), then they've probably finished treating.  The lawyer will probably ask for something outrageous, but the adjuster should review their claim like any other, and negotiate with the attorney.  Insurance adjusters that handle represented cases are typically more experienced, so that's good.  Like someone else mentioned, injury attorneys avoid court, it eats into their profits.  They can take a while to settle, but that's just the nature of claimants with attorneys.    Oh, and your insurance company is not supposed to release your policy limits unless there's a chance of blowing them (at least where I'm from).  Unless it's on your card, or you disclosed it at some point), the attorney should not be angling for 300K (and on a soft tissue case, I would be shocked if it came anywhere near that)."

At least if you give them a statement you can let them know a.) you are all the way out of your spot b.) your vehicle was in drive when the impact occurred and c.) the damage is to the side of your car. At the very least they should accept 50% liability and pay for half of your repairs. Your insurance company will likely deny 100% liability to them supporting she backed in to you. As long as they deny 50-100% of the claim your rates will not go up.

Insurance,39n7ys,GabriellaVM,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:10:00 2015 UTC,"To answer your question in general with respect to commercial policies: No. But there usually isn't an advantage to it unless the OON policy have much better benefits. For example, with a $1000 charge, and $500 allowed amount, The primary policy may pay $400 and assign $100 to coinsurance and the provider rights off the $500 excess. The OON policy has reduced benefits, so it charges the entire $500 to deductible and $500 balance is owed by the member, but since the lesser amount takes priority, the final balance is as if the only in-network processed.   Things could be different, if the OON policy has a lower OOP max that is already met, they would pay the $100 left over and the subscriber owes nothing.  The general rule is that since premiums are based on the entire cost and a secondary policy just perhaps picks up some pieces, unless one policy is basically free, two policies rarely make sense.   ith respect to ""dual elligibles"", things are a little different. MA plans do have contracts. Traditional Medicare and Medicaid do not, the provider either takes what they pay or doesn't (and in the case of Medicare the law says they normally have no choice but to take it).   So they don't need a contract with Medicaid to be paid for services, but they are under no obligation to file a claim either. With dual elegibility you're almost always better off with traditional Medicare rather than an Advantage plan, because you have a better chance of finding a provider that accepts Medicaid, and Medicaid fills most of the same holes that Advantage plans are intended to."

I am just relaying what I was told.  The doctor I worked for did not accept medicaid under any circumstance. I was told it was because if you take it even just once, you no longer have the right to say no if anyone wants treatment. Even someone that just might theoretically be eligible - this was a thing because then you could in certain cases apply after a catastrophic illness and get retroactive coverage. I don't know if that's still a thing. The main objection was taking it even once meant you had to pretty much just take everyone, even if they could not pay. It meant they couldn't refuse to work for free.  I am sure someone here  has more recent information. Please keep in mind, even if I am correct, this was over 30 years ago.

They should only really need the name(s) of the owner(s) of the vehicle. And your parents policy should cover you unless you're an excluded driver, making you an insured. But like I said, since it was parked and unoccupied you shouldn't have anything to worry about. I'm licensed in a couple states, and even if the vehicle was parked illegally, most of the time anyone who hits a parked vehicle will be liable(Obviously this could be different depending on what state you're in).

Insurance,39iswv,emalem5725,5,Fri Jun 12 00:35:47 2015 UTC,"Most companies that sell term insurance will offer a ""guaranteed re-entry rider"" that gives you the right to buy another term without underwriting once you reach the end of your first term. If you buy a 30 year term, you could get another 30 at the end of your first, taking you all the way to age 78. Not bad.  Do note that they will update your rate for age on that second term, but not health.  This process is usually a lot cheaper than buying whole life.

This is a permanent plan, typically whole life, with a term rider built in. I hope this helps. Feel free to reply or PM me if you have more questions."

Insurance,39iswv,Bucks_trickland,3,Fri Jun 12 01:13:14 2015 UTC,Pretty much every term policy has the option to convert. The problem with converting is you don't get a very competitive rate. But in your situation the opportunity to convert without having to go through underwriting could be crucial. A lot of applications will ask if you have pending medical tests to guard against just this kind of thing.

Insurance,39iswv,Yamuddah,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"At your age the common wisdom os to buy term and i vest the rest. Buy you own policies, use work coverage only as supplemental, because you usually can't take it to a new employer. You really don't need much term at 18, but now is the perfect time to get what you can, cause it'll be super inexpensive for you. Don't over buy, unless you know your parents can help if you're going to miss a payment. 3 missed payments usually ends the coverage, but check cause that varies. Blend later, whole life is very expensive, and you could get more coverage with term for your future spouse and children. My recommendation would be 30 year term 250k -  500k,GUARANTEED RENEWABLE. Sounds like alot for now, but it'll be right where you need to be in 10years. Alternatively, look into 50k whole life. No matter what any agent tells you, forget universal life, i just hate  that crap, and that money can work harder in other investments."
Insurance,39iswv,TrueBlonde,2,Fri Jun 12 14:59:38 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of good advice here so I'll let it sit. The one price of underwriting advice I would give is that you shouldn't volunteer any health information without being asked. If they don't ask about it, don't say anything. Of course, if they do ask you need to be honest and not misrepresent yourself. Otherwise, keep it to yourself. You haven't been diagnosed with anything so don't make it sound like you have."

While your at it, read the actual policy and figure out what it does and does not cover, what its daily benefit is, and how many days it lasts (called the 'multiplier'). A separate long term care policy might be a great way to cover the huge costs of custodial care, but they are generally hard to qualify for, so if you're going down this route do do before getting any tests.  For life insurance, read up on universal life. I'm surprised nobody else here mentioned it, it's generally cheaper than whole life and can't expire like term. When setup properly a UL can generate more interest on their cash values than the cost of insurance, thus self-funding, resulting in a policy you could pay into for several years and then not pay for at all for a while.  Contact a local health and life agent for details."

Insurance,39iadz,aprillian,2,Fri Jun 12 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"Uninsured Motorists covers different things in different states so you should clarify with the insurer whether they're talking about coverage for property or injury or both. IIRC in CA it's either UMPD (for property damage) or UMBI (for bodily injuries).   UM that covers property damage (UMPD) is a duplication of collision insurance. Collision covers all the same things UMPD does. UMPD covers all the same things that collision does but only if the other driver is uninsured and the accident is not your fault. It's also commonly limited to the same as the state property damage liability minimum, which in CA I believe is $5k. You buy this in lieu of collision coverage if you're concerned about property damage from being hit by an uninsured driver. If you crash your car yourself you're SOL. If an uninsured person hits you then it's basically a limited form of collision insurance. When you are hit by somebody else who does have insurance, but their carrier disputes liability for the accident, you fight that battle on your own.  More likely you're talking about Uninsured motorists bodily injury coverage (UMBI). This is where your insurer agrees to stand in the shoes of the absent insurer for the other party in exchange for whatever premium they charge you.  So here's your scenario:  You're driving home from work one Friday afternoon with your window down and say your arm on the door. You go into an intersection and get T-boned by an uninsured driver who is running a stoplight. You have no UM coverage. Your collision insurance pays for your car. Your health insurer initially denies your injury claim because car insurance pays before health insurance (if you have PIP or Medical payments coverage). Once that coverage is exhausted your health insurance says ""okay then"" and takes over. So you've lost a couple fingers and your left arm is 30% permanently crippled. The other driver has no insurance. No lawyer will take your case because there's nobody to sue who has any assets. You now have a mangled arm and you get nothing. The other drivers gets a ticket for no insurance and disappears.  Re-run the same scenario, except this time the other driver does have insurance, just the state minimum. In California this is $15k. Everything happens the same way except you collect his $15k. Then your health insurer goes and gets a lien against the money because the terms of your health insurance dictate they get first dibs. Assuming your bill is over $15k... you get nothing.  Re run the scenario WITH $100k in UM. Your insurer sees your injuries are clearly worth more than $100k. You get paid $100k (or $85k if the guy has $15k in coverage) The doctors/health insurer takes their cut, your lawyer takes his/her cut (if you have one), then you pocket the rest as compensation for the injury.   Now there's all sorts of rules and off-sets and laws about who gets dibs on what that vary from state to state but that's basically how it works."

Whichever product line you are referring to in your post, think critically. If you were a client, what would you want to disclose to your insurance agent in order for them to adequately understand recent changes that may have occurred throughout the last year.  If you are selling personal auto/home/life - I may want to know about any recent changes to the status of dependents or spouses. Have they started a new job where their mileage for their main auto has significantly increased or decreased. Has the home had any recent renovations and does the insured understand/feel comfortable with their limits of liability. Have they ever considered flood/quake coverage (few people will buy it, but you should always at least bring it up).

Even if your girlfriend is not on the lease she needs to be added to the policy in order to have coverage.  There are two scenarios that could occur that, if she was not on the policy, she would not have coverage.   First would be if a loss occurred (i.e. a fire) her contents would not be replaced. You may not think this is important, maybe all the furniture is owned by you, but if all of her clothes were destroyed she would want them replaced.  Second, if she caused damage, say she left the tub running and you have water damage in the house. If she is not listed on your policy, then your insurer has the right to sue her for any damages they paid out.  By adding her to your policy you are protecting her in the event of a loss."

On the other hand, we don't get subsidies because I'm currently paying off the IRS from a real estate deal that went to shit many years ago and the IRS would just take the subsidies since they're in the form of a tax credit - that would leave us responsible to pay back the subsidies at the end of the year, which would be an even bigger nightmare."

Let's start with you. Two ideas come to mind immediately. You can check to see if you have independent election rights for COBRA under your parent's coverage. This would make you a subscriber and responsible for your premiums, which is pricy, but would have a continuation of your existing coverage. Additionally, aging off the plan is a life event and should (IIRC) make you eligible for plans on the exchange outside of the open enrollment timeframe, so you could make the jump there.  For your son, if it runs out at the end of the year, that is the Open Enrollment timeframe for the exchange and many private insurers. You can also check with other government programs based on income to see what's available.  For your wife, there's always the Open Enrollment period at her job (which she can bring you and your son on at that point as well). If she drops her parental coverage, I believe she would be able to enroll off cycle with her job for a loss of coverage. If she's already on the coverage and you or your son lose coverage, she could also bring you on for that point as well."

Insurance,39hec7,TiedinHistory,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, thank you for taking the time to explain everything."
Insurance,39hec7,Mdcastle,3,Sat Jun 13 14:16:37 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with the categorization that this information is in the public domain. It's not. You're right that if a member has the ColoGuard test, they will receive an EOB with the amount requested and the amount allowed. Additionally, the company I work for (which was not on your list) does allow members, who have the code, provider, etc. to get the reimbursement rate in preparation for a procedure. That member is part of a private agreement with the insurance company to provide services, and some insurers, as part of that deal, want their members to be as well informed as possible and will provide that information. If it were in the public domain, it would be available. The company you work for, I presume, is not a member of any of these insurances. You are not the patron of the company, and there is no advantage to be gleaned by the company to release this kind of information to a third party. A member's claim info is their PHI (general PHI but PHI). If they choose to share it, the insurer cannot control that and it's their right to know what their insurance will cover.  It's potentially a major competitive disadvantage. Just using ColoGuard as an example. Let's say the five insurers you asked for have a wide range. The ones at the higher end will try to negotiate it lower, or simply may drop it when their contract runs out or policy changes. Those at the lower end then may have the screws put to them by Exact Sciences to be more equal with the other companies. Exact Sciences may lose their small batch of insurers who will pay them. If the ColoGuard was a big selling point, companies may lose customers if they can find company that will cover a higher or lower rate (depending on plan type). For Exact Sciences, it may allow a competitor to undercut them on compensation. We have no idea why you're asking for this information. Honestly with ColoGuard this may not be a huge deal, but it would definitely be for, say, hospital reimbursement rates and those contracts. If Memorial Hospital for Cancer gets $10,000 per night for an inpatient stay and every other company knows it, what is the Hospital for Special Surgery going to do when they only get $6,000? Negotiate for $10,000 and potentially jump out of network if they don't get it. This works in reverse as well. If Aetna pays $10,000 for an inpatient day to Memorial, but Humana only pays $8,000, that puts Memorial at a disadvantage come negotiation time.  This isn't that unusual really. Does WalMart have a full list of what they pay each of their suppliers for their products? If they pay $1.00 for a pound of chicken from Purdue but $.80 for a pound of chicken from Tyson, there's no upside in anyone knowing anyone else's prices.  Plus, we have no idea why your company wants this information. Our members have a vested interest because they're going to get the test. We don't know who you are (or who any third party requesting the information is) or what you will do with it. Are you working for a company trying to undercut Exact Sciences? Are you working for a company that is a competitor to my own company? What is your endgame and could it hurt our professional relationships. If they give this info to you and it tanks a relationship between BCBS and Exact Sciences, would they kill any of the other products, would that result in a chain effect over privacy issues?  My employer would fire me for giving out that info as well, FWIW. I know you're not disputing it but there's competitive advantage reasons why this exists."
Insurance,39hec7,Mdcastle,2,Fri Jun 12 00:55:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for this very helpful answer. As an industry outsider it does strike me as slightly odd that information that could provide such a competitive advantage is still available to any members of that plan on their EOBs. It seems to me that any insurance company that was exercising even a small degree of competitive intelligence would simply find members of the competing plans and ask for their help finding the data. But it does make sense to me that the insurance companies wouldn't want their own brokers being the ones to put the data out there.   As far as the reason I'm seeking the data, this detailed type of research is simply what I do when it comes to putting assumptions together about a company's future revenue potential. I already know that the list price for colorguard is basically $600. I also know that Medicare is reimbursing approximately $500. Speculation is rampant about whether private insurance will pay less than $500 or more than $500 for the test. My research leads me to believe that private insurance is used to getting a discount off of Medicare rates. Exact sciences has said publicly that they intend to hold out, and not allow private insurance companies to get a discount to the Medicare rate. A handful of insurance companies have decided to cover colorguard for the commercial lives. Exact sciences has said publicly that the average reimbursement they have secured from private insurance carrier so far is in fact higher than the Medicare reimbursement rate. As a general rule I do not take management's word for things like this and I seek to verify for myself.   I did not understand why many of the researchers out there seemed unable to get the exact price of what private insurance companies were paying for the test. Now I have a better understanding of that reason.   I figured I would try to do is simply find some people who are parts of the plan and ask their assistance in finding out what the reimbursement for the test was. But I also decided I needed to better understand why people had seemed unable to get the data in a more straightforward fashion.   What you said was accurate, colorguard is not an important competitive test for any insurance companies. Almost nobody even covers it yet. My research is specifically about colorguard and not in relation to actual insurance companies. But I certainly understand the concern about the competitive advantage thing.   So thank you for the feedback about that, I really appreciate it."
Insurance,39hec7,Waldoh,3,Fri Jun 12 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"Members probably aren't going to take too kindly to another insurance  policy calling them up and asking about medical procedures they had done and how much they had to pay for it (and they probably tossed the EOB once they saw it wasn't a bill). Also the dataset will be limited. Maybe you could get rates for a physical exam or a cholesterol test, but you'd have a hard time finding someone that had each of the tens of thousands of surgical procedures done.   In my experience private insurance almost without exception pays more than Medicare. I've looked at thousands of EOBs from dozens of insurance companies, as well as thousands of EOMBs"

Just to clarify for you, I am not an insurance company nor do I represent an insurance company. And I am only interested in the colorguard test, nothing else.   The management of Exact Sciences have said publicly that the large insurance companies are used to getting a 20% discount to Medicare. Perhaps they were speaking only of cancer screening tests? Maybe they were even speaking only of stool tests? I don't actually know. I have very limited experience in the insurance world. It did not occur to me that management's statement about this could be incorrect.   Is there any part of your experience in the insurance world that would explain why exact sciences management said that the biggest insurance companies are expecting a 20% discount to Medicare?

If you're making a career out of insurance it's worth to get it eventually.  I wouldn't make it your first priority though  Something like the AU is much more specific and more desirable if you are going for an underwriter position or promotion.  You'll get a lot more useful information from it if you're working as an underwriter.  But - yes, the AU is worth it if you want to stay in underwriting.  I got the AIC - the claims equivalent to the AU - and I have no doubt that helped me get my first big promotion.  Most people start with a more specialized test (AU, AIC, ARM).  Then they go for the AINS (since it gives you credit to transfer to the CPCU).  Then they work on the CPCU.  If you want some extra letters you could get the AIS."

I can tell you the designation holds a lot more weight at the regional broker than it does at the Carrier. At the national broker it was a mixed bag. It was definitely encouraged but not something most people thought about.    I strongly recommend you get the ARM first. Its quick (3 exams) and gives the most bang for your buck. Then i would pursue the CPCU. After you get the CPCU the AU is easy, its like one or two exams. The way i handled it was i first got my ARM, then i started my CPCU's. The CPCU and AU material is congruent. So i would study for one subject and take both the CPCU and AU exams a few days apart.   I have a CPCU, ARM, Au, Are, and AIS"

Both designations will give you great experience and definitely help to advance your career.  Remember that you cannot go wrong with either choice, but I personally would pursue the CPCU first. Just my preference because I'd rather start with the hardest and knock it out quickly (while you're motivated). Not to mention the first 4 CPCU exams are considered ""foundation courses"" so they just cover general insurance topics such as risk management and insurance operations, which you are most likely familiar with after working in the industry.  The CPCU is definitely the most prestigious designation in the insurance industry, it's held by only about 4% of the property casualty industry. If you're looking to move up the ranks/pursue management positions this will give you a HUGE leg up on the competition  Once you complete the CPCU you can move onto the additional designations like the AU or AINS (if you still think you need the education). These exams will be much easier than the CPCU so you should have no problem after finishing the CPCU  Side note: If you can knock out all CPCU exams this year you'll get to go to the conferment ceremony in Hawaii!

Anytime someone goes to a chiropractor  after a car accident they need a minimum 3 months of treatment  but if they go to a medical doctor they need a visit or two and maybe a few physical therapy  visits....make of that what you will, that starting offer doesn't seem unreasonable"
Insurance,39cvd2,doihaveabeaoproblem,9,Thu Jun 11 00:37:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There's a reason that a lot of insurance companies don't consider chiropractor assessments to mean jack. Mostly since, y'know, the vast majority of chiropractors aren't real medical doctors."
Insurance,39cvd2,tang81,3,Thu Jun 11 01:11:50 2015 UTC,"That's certainly fair. Soft tissue injuries aren't valued much higher than that because they are easily treated and don't have any life changing effects. See if you can do a little better than $1000 but it would probably be about $1500 at the most, especially with the force of impact you had.   Source: I am a BI adjuster in Ohio"
Insurance,39cvd2,Kakureta,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:50:25 2015 UTC,"There is a lot to consider here. Did you go to the ER after the accident?  PCP visits? Any lost wages, take any vacation time for these appointments?   I'm not an adjuster. I work for Personal Injury attorneys. I am not a lawyer. But you should talk to one in your area.   What insurance is paying your medicals? If it's your medical insurance they may have a right to be paid out of any settlement you receive.   We've settled cases like this, usually starting around $15,000 and settling somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000. But every detail matters. Every detail could get you more money or cost you money.   Tl;dr: go talk to a lawyer."
Insurance,39cvd2,tang81,8,Thu Jun 11 02:46:10 2015 UTC,Wow just wow.  This is why people who are in minor accidents act like they won the lottery.  What this person forgot to tell you is that the lawyers always ask for policy limits and only ever get them if there was a surgery broken bones or the like.  Also that $5000 which is still likely high but still int he realm includes all your medical and chiro  bills.  So after the lawyer takes their 30%-40% you are are going to net $600. *  This is a low stakes play for you in the long run.  Be reasonable and most of the time you will be treated that way.  Also you should look in to settling with a future meds settlement.  This means that you and the adjuster agree that they will pay for the treatment you have received plus x amount of future treatments.
Insurance,39cvd2,CruiserU171,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:39:38 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for all lawyers, maybe some ask for limits all the time. We try to stick to the realm of reality. If there is a surgery, yes we are going to ask for all the money. Often times that means days in the hospital, weeks recovering and a lifetime of pain. When the limits are typically between $15k and $50k. It's a drop in the bucket compared to what they are going to go through.   We would also never settle for $5k and give the client $600. That never happens. Our minimum would be 50% after costs and fees. A case like this, our minimum to the client would be $3,500.   Since OP already has an offer for $1,000 we would also only collect fees on anything over $1,000.   It may seem like winning the lottery. But when you have to spend all your vacation time going to the Dr. and you spend days/weeks/months in pain through no fault of your own, you should be compensated. That's what you buy insurance for."

Insurance,39cvd2,Kakureta,6,Wed Jun 10 22:58:08 2015 UTC,"Not really true. In most states an accident has to be non-chargable for UIM to apply. A non-chargable loss usually shouldnt increase premiums (well, at least in NC/SC)."

Insurance,39cvd2,piratefan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:19:35 2015 UTC,What constitutes a non chargeable loss?  It's interesting because this seems like a scam and his insurance should increase.
Insurance,39cvd2,CruiserU171,3,Wed Jun 10 23:16:45 2015 UTC,A non-chargable loss is one for which a policyholder cannot be surcharged (premium increase). Usually this is associated with things like deer hits - a driver has no control over a deer and so is not at fault for hitting one. Most states require policy language to state that UIM only applies in not at fault losses.
Insurance,39dep5,ingrok0,3,Thu Jun 11 00:40:06 2015 UTC,This is a tough one to be honest.  In the insurance world we think about liability (fault) as duties.  Based on your statement above:  He had the duty to make sure the road was clear for him to make his left turn.    You had a duty to maintain control of your vehicle and do so in a manor that would have allowed you to stop or safely slow for road  hazards.   Also 25k in damages yikes.  Sounds like you have some car shopping to do in your future.

Insurance,39dep5,Kakureta,3,Fri Jun 12 01:39:47 2015 UTC,"Negligence, is duty owed, duty breached, proximate cause, actual damages. Duty owed? To yield right of way to you. Duty breached? I would say yes. Proximate cause of your damages arising from the other driver's action? Sounds like it based on your statement. Actual damages? Yep. Actual contact between vehicles is not an absolute requirement to determine negligence. What is required here is evidence that he did what you say he did. Did he confirm this to the police officer?"
Insurance,39dep5,f1shbone,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"There are some exceptions to this, but generally you will not be able to place fault on him as your vehicle did not come into contact with his.

It's so great to have this.  However, Enterprise may have a different deal as they may have a different deal when renting for covering for collisions, so the insurance may be part of making that happen.  I would certainly call your credit cards and ask, and then call Enterprise."

Insurance,39bls3,tommiebooyy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"Just a bit of my thought process.  I'm legally required to get this insurance to rent the car. If I do not pay the insurance fee, I'm stuck without transportaion for 7-10 days while my car is being worked on in the shop.The insurance fee isn't a luxury that I'm paying for to have peace of mind, it is a requirement that I have to have it just to be able to drive it off.  Why would I have to pay close to $200 for an accident where I have no fault? I'm fine just driving around in my car with just liability, but the rental company is not fine with me driving around with just liability, understandably so.  Not saying that you're wrong, it just seems so baffling to me."
Insurance,39bls3,tommiebooyy,9,Wed Jun 10 18:03:30 2015 UTC,"that is between you and enterprise. Its enterprises requirement that the rental car is covered for collision/comprehensive, not a legal requirement. The only legal requirement for insurance on the rental car is that it carry state minimum liability coverage- which already comes from your own auto insurance policy. I agree it does not seem fair but its also not fair to expect the insurance company with whom you have no policy with, to insure YOUR rental car... Its just one of those things where you are SOL..."
Insurance,39bls3,Grumplstilskin,6,Wed Jun 10 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"You can request usaa to just pay you the amount of the rental, it's called loss of use.  And you can just borrow a car from a friend.  Usaa is required to put you in the same situation as before the accident.  Your car had liability only? They provided you a car w liability only (the rental).  The fact that the rental agency requires additional coverage is irrelevant."

Which under insurance is called indemnity, its what insurance is for. If they were to pay for coverages you don't currently have then you would be profiting from the lose.  As others have said as well, that this is not the requirement of USAA its the rental company. Look at it as driving is a privilege not a right. They are not impacting your life or wronging you in any way due to this. The rental coverage is lose of use coverage so it doesn't have to be a rental it can be cab bus or cash out and borrow a friends car.  There isn't much that can be done here either you get the insurance and get a rental or don't and what out repairs."

Insurance,39bls3,Cicatrized,5,Wed Jun 10 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"USAA has no obligation to insure the rental vehicle. Their obligation to you is to provide you with a replacement vehicle, which they have done, but any associated costs (i.e. gas and insurance) are on you. This is the because, had an accident not occurred you are still responsible for insuring the vehicle you drive.  You can fight them on this, but I guarantee you will not win. I would recommend checking with your own insurer, a lot of times you can purchase rental car insurance as an add-on to your policy."

You are relying on your insurance carrier to do things that are not their responsibility (handle your damages).   When you call, have a copy of your declarations page which shows your coverages and explain your situation. 1. You don't have collision or comprehensive coverages and 2. You can't get in a rental without the Collision Damage Waiver. They will request a copy of that declarations page which you will have ready to provide them.  Liability coverage is required by law and they would not owe for it if you didn't have it.  Collision is optional however, and there is no expectation that you must carry it."

I'm not an insurance agent in Ohio, but I would say $510 really isn't that bad (for six months - praying that's not your monthly premium)  You can try going down to 50/100, it may save you some money, but probably not worth it.  All companies rate drivers differently and the only way you can find out is by getting quotes. You get what you pay for with insurance. Traditionally, the bigger name companies have a better claims experience, which is ultimately the product you're paying for. I would be a little iffy about something like esurance."
Insurance,39dh5n,MaplewoodNectarine,2,Thu Jun 11 02:01:50 2015 UTC,$510 is not bad for a $250 deductible.  The inquiries are soft hits on your credit
Insurance,39dh5n,alphatangolima,3,Thu Jun 11 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"Dont lower your bodily injury. Just because you have no assets doesnt mean you have nothing to lose. Also, future wages can be garnished. At the very least do 100/300/100. The savings would be insignificant and if the limits are being hit, that means you're screwing someone over bc you wanted to save a couple dollars. The collision portion of your car is likely $10 or so a month.   Best companies you didnt mention? Cincinnati Insurance, Travelers, Safeco, and a regional company called Western Reserve Group.  You could call an independent agent and he/she should be able to give you multiple quotes. Tell them what youre paying, they dont control the pricing, but they can tell you if youre getting a good price or not."
Insurance,39dh5n,UnhelpfulReply,2,Thu Jun 11 13:15:17 2015 UTC,"With a car like that you should consider dumping collision coverage if there's no loan and buying another car wouldn't be any sort of insurmountable financial challenge if you total it. You can also raise your collision deductible to $1,000 or some other amount higher than $250.   You can purchase Uninsured Motorists Property Damage Coverage in Ohio instead of collision coverage. This will pay out up to $7,500 if you're hit by an uninsured driver. This is cheaper than collision insurance, though of course it doesn't pay for collision damage that's your own fault, only that which is the fault of an uninsured driver.   Liability limits are just your tolerance for risk.   I worked in a body shop in Ohio for a bit. I wasn't a big fan of dealing with Progressive or Geico. IMHO Allstate and Nationwide micromanage the shit out of their direct repair shops. Emcompass and Esurance are subsidiaries of Allstate but seem to be run at arm's length.  State Farm was easy to deal with, as was Erie. You can look at Cincinnati Insurance and Motorists Insurance which are two other companies popular in Ohio. Farmers Insurance also does a decent book of business in Ohio."

Insurance,39apny,broseph23,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:42:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't get your insurance involved unless you absolutely must. I'd like to here an adjusters thoughts on this bc it happens frequently.
Insurance,39c012,DriverInNeed,8,Wed Jun 10 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"I mean... You were the backing vehicle. You have the greatest duty of care to make sure it is completely safe to back your vehicle. If there's room on the left of you to pass, she can do so. You should've been making sure she wasn't passing you on the left as you were backing. I would probably find you 90% at fault if not 100%."
Insurance,39c012,broseph23,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:19:27 2015 UTC,"What are you basing that on?  I'm not sure what else I could have done in the situation. I stopped in front of the spot. I signaled. I waited. She didn't move. There was room to back in, so I backed in. I was looking over my right shoulder so that I could avoid the parked car and to see where I was going. She didn't have to go around me. There was plenty of room. So she went around me and instead of taking full advantage of all the room to the left, she hit my front bumper.  As I said, I'm not sure what else a normal person could have done in my position. I can't look over both shoulders at once."
Insurance,39c012,broseph23,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:49:57 2015 UTC,"You can't look over both shoulders correct. But liability is based of state statutes. Backing vehicles always have the greatest duty of care, they are never the favored vehicle as they do not have the right of way. The problem: you were looking over your right shoulder when the impact occurred. You never saw the other driver as you were backing, so no danger recognition, no evasive action. A vehicle cannot back unless it is completely safe to do so. An impact never would've occurred had it been completely safe to do so. Now may the other driver have contributed? Possibly. But you don't have an argument because you never saw her as you were backing so you cannot necessarily say what she was or wasn't doing. A driver must maintain proper lookout at all times. When you're parallel parking, it's probably the most important to be looking to your left if your parking to your passenger side when you're cranking the wheel as the front of your car will be swinging wide."
Insurance,39c012,Phil_Achio,6,Fri Jun 12 01:06:01 2015 UTC,"This is the type of situation where the fault would more than likely be attributed 50/50. Meaning you are just as much at fault as she is, provided she tells them the exact way ypu said it her. As a driver reversing you have a duty to make sure it is safe to do so. That's where your fault comes from, but all she has to do I'd say you were pulling out of the spot. Which she willost likely do, and based off the damages that would fit putting you 100% at fault for this. And as her insurance company they have a duty to take her at her word unless it can be proved otherwise.  If you got a ticket for failure to provide proof of insurance it is most likely maditory whereever you are from to ha e insurance. That being said in a court setting this could count against you as well if you aren't carrying insurance you may be view as more apt to lie.  Chances are her insurance company will pay her damages then sue you to recoup the costs that they paid out.   As for getting insurance it's too late for that now to get any kind of coverage. You're going to need to eat you damage and possible pay for a good portion of hers as well. As for getting it insured without switching over the title and registration that is unlikely you need to prove you have an insurable interest in the car since its in your brothers name that will be hard to prove.   Tl:Dr you are more than likely going to have some fault assigned to you, your going to have to pay tp fix your damages and most likely will be sued for all or a portion of the third party damages."
Insurance,39c012,HackPhilosopher,3,Wed Jun 10 22:28:44 2015 UTC,"To piggy back on this, you may live in a state that has ""no pay no play"" laws in place which means that even if you were 100% not at fault, you would be limited to what you could recoup from the other insurance agency since you are not insured. The reasoning for such laws comes from the idea that if you do not care about insuring everyone else, then why should anyone have to pay for your damages."
Insurance,39c012,Cicatrized,2,Wed Jun 10 23:06:20 2015 UTC,Great answer. Could not have said it better myself.
Insurance,39c012,britt5689,3,Wed Jun 10 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"Technically, her insurance company could deny you any payment because you should not have even been on the road in the first place since it's illegal to drive with no insurance in all 50 states."
Insurance,39bdhb,TechFocused,13,Wed Jun 10 16:43:38 2015 UTC,Your insurance paid.  You paid your insurance the deductible.  You do not get that back unless it is subrogated from the other company.  Have you talked to the other driver's insurance company at all?  You should've been in contact with them from day 1.
Insurance,39bdhb,Killboy_Powerhead,9,Wed Jun 10 17:08:01 2015 UTC,"Basically liberty mutual gets that deductible from his insurance, and passes it along to you. If they're denying liability then you don't get your deductible back, it's called subrogation. Even if you're not at fault, every time you file a collision claim you pay a deductible. Hopefully that makes more sense to you. Why didn't you file a claim against the other party's insurance in the first place? Just curious."
Insurance,39bdhb,britt5689,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:09:29 2015 UTC,"It does make sense, thank you. LM told us to pay the deductible and they would reclaim it from the other driver's insurance. We filed a claim with our company right after the accident and the rep said they would contact the other company. Come to find out months later no claim with them was filed.   It was our first accident and went off what the rep we talked to told us."
Insurance,39bdhb,thelurkerabides,7,Wed Jun 10 18:05:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not a claims adjuster and laws do vary from state to state but are you sure you're not at least partially at fault? You tried to pass someone when it was not safe. It might have ""have appeared he was making a left hand turn"" but he didn't. And he didn't signal either way.   I think you should eat the deductible and be glad you didn't have a liability claim as well."
Insurance,39bdhb,potters2643,6,Wed Jun 10 17:32:59 2015 UTC,You would make a good adjuster. Very reasonable determination and evaluation.
Insurance,39bdhb,broseph23,3,Wed Jun 10 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"Did liberty mutual put you 0% at fault? If the other driver never left the lane he was traveling in, he still had control of the roadway even though he made a wide right turn. If he never left, you cannot pass him on the right. You cannot overtake someone in the lane they still have control over, even if their vehicle is only 1 inch within that lane still. On this kind of accident, based on that POI and whether or not either of you had any DR or EA, I would probably find you 70-80% at fault."
Insurance,39bdhb,user4user,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:14:20 2015 UTC,"You could take them to small claims court (if it goes up to 4k) in your state. You would have to sue for the entire 4k & expenses if any. If you win, Liberty Mutual would keep $3500 of the $4000.  You must confirm that Liberty Mutual is not subrogating the case. You can try to get Liberty Mutual to subrogate the case but you need more evidence than just words. They are not going to hire an attorney and engineer for less than $3500. Btw, without reimbursement from the other insurance company, Liberty Mutual can charge you for the accident on the renewal."

Insurance,3975m3,pm_me_your_kindwords,-10,Tue Jun 9 20:23:37 2015 UTC,It seems like a deductible. You pay 100% up to a certain point and then you have 80/20 co insurance from there. That is incredibly standard.
Insurance,39913u,iphone4Suser,8,Wed Jun 10 03:13:44 2015 UTC,"You will have to pay your deductible. You chose to have a $500 deductible on your policy any time your car is damaged, regardless of who's at fault. It's unfortunate you have no UMPD coverage.

But I am new to USA and I am not very sure how insurance works here (never owned car in home country). Here since I was not driving or it wasn't my fault I was wondering whether any way I can convince my insurance company to avoid me paying anything. Seems like it is probably not possible.
Insurance,39913u,Zen_Drifter,3,Wed Jun 10 04:24:05 2015 UTC,"You don't actually have to ""pay"" anything to get your claim paid. They just do an estimate for the actual repair cost and then pay you $500 less than that.  So as to your question about whether you can avoid paying your deductible, it depends.  You have a legal contract with your insurer which obligates them to pay for the repair of your car as long as you comply with the terms set forth in the policy.  You also have a legal contract with the body shop when they agree to do the repairs to your vehicle.   Unless the body shop is a direct repair shop for the insurer then these agreements are mutually independent.   It's usually perfectly legal for the shop to offer you a repair price that is less then the insurer's estimate, whether they know the amount of the insurer's estimate or not. (There's 50 states in the US so there's 50 different definitions of insurance fraud so the actual definition of insurance fraud in your area may vary.)  What's illegal is for you or the shop to claim/misrepresent damages that were not related to the accident as being related, for you or the shop to ""enhance"" existing damages for the purposes of collecting additional money from the insurer, or for you or the shop to basically ""phony-up"" anything. It's all either insurance fraud or facilitation of insurance fraud. These are felonies in some jurisdictions.  If you have a lender then the interest of the lender is protected by the insurer by naming either the shop or the lender on the check in addition to you. If the body shop did not perform all the repairs to industry standards in order to save you some or all of your deductible then you and/or the shop may be guilty of fraud against the lender. (The lender probably does not care though, as long as you keep paying the loan.)  If there is no loan on the car then the check is made out just to you. It's entirely your option whether you want to all, part, or none of the damages. You can pocket the money and just drive around in the damaged car if you like. Fixing the damage isn't a condition of payment. You're being compensated for your financial loss. The insurer is perfectly happy if you never fix the car since that means there's nobody that's going to be calling them up later looking for more money for any hidden damages. You're not doing anything illegal unless you or the shop engage in the sketchy activities outlined above or you have a subsequent accident and claim the unrepaired portion of the damages as new damage. This is called ""double dipping"" and is insurance fraud.  Now the point in the process where you get taken advantage of is in your lack of knowledge about what things actually cost to fix. So you have an estimate for, say, $3,000. You tell the shop you want the whole job done for $2,500. The shop agrees to this. The shop then does a shitty ($750-their-cost) job repairing your car because you've basically just given them a license to do it how ever they want. Now you're mad. You call me. I meet you down at the shop. I tell you and the shop owner that your car looks like crap. Then I turn to you and ask you if you paid your deductible. You say ""well, no"". Then I shrug my shoulders, say ""well you got what you paid for"", say ""this is between you and the shop"", and then I get in my car and drive away."
Insurance,39913u,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"So TL;DR would be..   I go to geico specified body shop who is also the person who will give me the estimate of repairs. Preferably get the car fixed at the same shop (any benefit) ?   I did not get your first line. Doesn't deductible mean that say the cost of repairs if $2500, then $500 I am supposed to pay and rest geico pays ?"

Doesn't deductible mean that say the cost of repairs if $2500, then $500 I am supposed to pay and rest geico pays ?   Correct. Some people are under the impression they need to write some sort of check to the insurer.   If you're going to a direct repair shop then there is usually something in the agreement between the shop and the insurer that the shop has to charge you the deductible.   In cases where you're not having all the work done because you own the car outright they often collect the deductible and then refund all or part of it to you if you are not having all the repairs done."
Insurance,39913u,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:25:15 2015 UTC,"I have a loan on the car. Does it affect or impact anything here with fixing my car ? I had a talk with Geico and they told me to go to that body shop (probably their affiliated) which is 20 miles away from my city (nearest for my zip code as told by geico) and they will give me an estimate. Then I can get the repairs done at any shop and they told me something about providing a 2 name check, is it my name and the body shop's name ? So say the estimate is $2500 then does it mean geico will give me (or the body shop ?) a check of $2000 ?  Sorry for many queries but I am new to USA and never owned car before and this unfortunate thing happens to don't really know what and how it will go ahead.  Also how do I make sure that the work done by body shop is very good and after the work, hopefully it should not appear that some work was done on the car. It should be impeccable. I would hate to see my car daily if I can see the part where it was hit and work was shoddy and faults visible."
Insurance,39913u,britt5689,5,Wed Jun 10 04:30:17 2015 UTC,"So if there is a loan on the car and the estimate is $2,500 then yes, they give you a $2,000 check. The check will have your name on it as well as the name of the repair shop you are having fix the car. When you pick up the car you pay the other $500.   The way you make sure the work is done right is to pay the full amount and use a shop that guarantees the work they do."

Insurance,39913u,britt5689,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:55:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know any shops up there. The body shop business is very fragmented and the large chains like Carstar are franchised so one may be better than another.   My recommendation when chosing a shop is to visit several and not to go against any bad vibes you get from any particular place. The return rate (the odds you have to take the car back to the shop at least once to have something adjusted or addressed) for auto body repair is quite high, like 20%+. You want somebody you can work with."
Insurance,39913u,britt5689,0,Wed Jun 10 11:40:22 2015 UTC,"Uninsured motorists doesn't even apply to this situation. You can only use that when you know who hit you, and you can prove they didn't have insurance, otherwise you use your collision coverage.

So if you don't have the 500$ upfront you can hang on to the check and wait a few months until you can save up your deductible."

However, if you want to get into the field it is best for you to take the test and get licensed.  The adjuster's test isn't hard. Google for TX adjusters pre-licensing classes and sign up. It's usually a 2-3 day course. The reason I say take the Texas test is the TX license has the best reciprocity with other states so you take only one test and can get licensed as an adjuster in multiple others."

At the end you take the actual licensing test and upon passing (you will) it gets turned into the state Dept of Insurance and you get your license."
Insurance,398a89,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:23:31 2015 UTC,"You can apply for an entry level job at any number of property & casualty insurers. There are numerous carriers who specifically hire people with no prior experience so they can their them ""their way"". Just look for ""entry level"" in the wording on the job description. For inside jobs the carrier will usually train you in-house. For outside jobs (field reps) they may train you with a mentor or send you to a school for several weeks.   You can also sidle-in on the property side by working for some sort of home rennovation or roofing/siding contractor doing estimates for a year or two. A year or two of experience in the front office at an auto body shop can also get your foot in the door on the auto side (for a field position). You don't really need any experience at all to get a job doing basic auto claims work in the office. They'll teach you what you need to know and you move up by learning how to handle progressively more complex losses.   Clean cut with no visible tatoos or piercings (for outside positions that involve face-to-face interaction) helps. Enthusiasm for going away to random disaster zones anywhere in the country on short notice also helps."

Basically the lady who came around once a year to test every kid's hearing with those headphones and the high pitched beeps.   Another manager I worked for started off her career running a Pizza Hut.   On the flip side we used to have a field rep who would disappear for hours on end on weekdays several days a week. He was doing all his work at night and on weekends. Turned out he was student teaching during the day and left to become a teacher.

Insurance,398wgf,HMOtroubles,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:37:11 2015 UTC,"I have no idea if this will work, but it may be worth having her update her PCP/OBGYN (if the current provider allows for the OBGYN to be the PCP, all the better) currently on file and see if they can backdate that, and then try to reprocess the claim. I'd see if the provider can call the insurer and get a referral on file for that point after the point.  Just as importantly, since the provider is participating, many carriers have protections for members in this scenario if a specialist fails to get a referral on file. For the company I work for, this responsibility would fall on the provider and they could not bill the member if it's an HMO that requires a referral.  There's several potential paths here. I would start with the provider getting some supporting info on file, your girlfriend updating her profile, and seeing if they can do a reprocess. Appeals is an option here too.  As for the side note, generally, they can do it but it's recommended they wait and bill once the claim is processed to determine proper compensation. I understand why they are doing it after the previous experience but it's not suggested practice."

Insurance,399if1,LASuperdome,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:08:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of these questions can be found on the Colorado Workers Compensation website: https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/dwc . Your adjust should be able to answer all these questions - it's their job.  If they can't help you then request a supervisor or go to that website I linked and call their help line.  I've never worked with Colorado workers comp directly, but I took a cursory glance at the website to see if there were any weird Colorado specific laws (there isn't).  I'll go through your questions:   Is it illegal for my employer to withhold my statement of wages made?    Not necessarily illegal.  But - insurance companies are expected to work with the carriers so they can defend them and administer the claims in a timely fashion.   Under what law are they required to report my wages to the insurance company?    8-42-102 is the law determining how it's calculated.  Here's the law book.  There isn't any specific law that I know of that says they have to submit records.  It would be an indication for something like tax fraud if it did happen and it may be investigated by the state insurance department.   I've only worked for my employer for a few months but aren't they required to send me an income statement for taxes at the end of the year?    Yes, the W2 form.  You'll get it around tax time.   The last time I talked to my insurance adjuster, she had said I would need to provide documentation of my wages made because through ""her experience"" of past claims with my employer, they won't...    Provide what she is asking for.  They seem to be a problem client but the carrier can't drop them until they policy is up.   In regards to the income statement, I believe from other drivers, the company sends only income from credit card wages and not cash/tip wages, because there is no proof that you have actually made that cash/tips.    That's illegal if your company doesn't keep track of tips since you're suppose to pay tax on it.   So at this point in time, should I contact the adjuster and request my employer submits my income statement? Or should I just provide my documented wages?    Do what your adjuster asked you to do, like you mentioned above.   I'm still wondering how I'm going to be fairly compensated if calculating my temp disability benefits is 2/3 of the AWW and what I have as evidence is not my total wages but random shifts I was able to keep record of.   Provide the information the adjuster asked for. They will calculate a voluntary rate.  It will eventually get seen by a judge who will approve it or change it.  If you don't have any records or insufficient records then tell your adjuster and explain the situation.  They don't get paid extra if they screw you out of money - they just aim for fairness.  Final thought: your employer sounds extremely shady and looks to be committing some serious crimes such as tax fraud.  If you don't plan on going back to work there you could consider filing a complaint with the Colorado Department of Insurance and maybe IRS tax fraud unit."

Insurance,399if1,emptydiner,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:34:49 2015 UTC,"Tell the adjuster what you just told us.  All compensation must be reported, both what you have and what your employer has.  You will end up getting roughly 66% of your average weekly wage.  If your employer is trying to withhold your wage amounts from the adjuster then there is a possibility that he is not reporting your wages correctly to the workers comp carrier and to the IRS.  I'm not saying that is what is happening but rather, it happens all the time.    Talk to your employer and the adjuster to see what is going on.  I have heard of some employers not reporting wages properly and instead of reporting them to the WC  carrier, they pay the difference between your claim payments(what you receive from the workers comp) and your AWW.    Bottom line, you need to become the adjuster's best friend."
Insurance,399if1,LASuperdome,2,Wed Jun 10 14:11:16 2015 UTC,The adjuster will pay whatever the judge awards.  If the employer does not submit wage evidence then the judge will generally award a higher AWW than they normally would at a tentative rate.    It's also a great way for the employer to piss off the carrier - it's a big red flag for premium auditors since they look like theyre hiding accounting records.

Cool story: I worked with a policy that was an amish-owned woodshop years ago.  The owner kept very minimal records and he was functionally illiterate.  Like, he knew how much he paid out in employee salary per week but he had no idea how much each person earned.

Sometimes the patient can have more pull with insurance than the provider does.  First I would call the billing department of your creditor to figure out when the claim was first send, when they received the original denial, what the denial was for exactly (I'd expect it to be inactive coverage due to using an old ID #, but you never know if other errors were made), and what steps were taken to appeal the denial.

Insurance,39679d,Waldoh,3,Tue Jun 9 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"Two basic ways to solve this, one easy, one ... less easy?   I’ve looked online and the only advice I found was to submit proof that the claim was submitted timely.   Good advice there, what those things don't tell you is that it doesn't really matter WHERE it was sent, as long as they sent it somewhere within the timely filing guidelines. And since your insurance company has the bill in their systems already the Easy way would be:   call the insurance company member services number.  briefly explain the situation, be super nice to the rep and act happy to give them whatever they're asking for because they're not going to want to do this next part.  ask them to call the people billing you and have them fax over a copy of the original insurance submission. Doesn't matter if it went to the wrong place. As long as it shows that it was sent somewhere within their guidelines they will accept that. (Timely filing guidelines exist to penalize providers for not being diligent in their billing responsibilities. Not to screw over the provider because the patient had an old card in their wallet.) STAY ON THE LINE. Seriously. Say you'll wait on hold or if they can conference you in on the call even better. If someone says they'll call you back or that they'll take care of it, don't believe them!  once fax is received, claim can be reprocessed and everyone is happy.   Less easy way: You're not bound by provider timely filing guidelines so you could request an itemized bill, fill out a claim form and send it in yourself if you want. There are still patient timely filing guidelines though, varies by carrier. About 6 months to a year or two ? This is the sucky way though, don't do this."
Insurance,3985qx,pijinglish,5,Tue Jun 9 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"This sounds like good coverage. It gets you above the minimum liability you previously had. You'd be surprised how quickly one could do 50k worth of damage. You're getting a lot more liability coverage for ~100 dollars more. The rest of the increase is for your comp/coll, which you said you needed.   I'm not seeing rental on there. Would you need a rental vehicle if this one needed to be repaired after a loss? What about med pay/PIP?"
Insurance,3985qx,FunandFailure,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:21:42 2015 UTC,What's med pay/PIP?  I have no idea what I'm doing.
Insurance,3985qx,Zen_Drifter,5,Tue Jun 9 23:23:51 2015 UTC,"Medpay/PIP is basically health insurance that applies only for car accidents. It normally steps-in in-front of your health insurance and pays car accident related medical bills. It's usually pretty cheap and is a great thing to have if you have no health insurance or a plan with a high deductible (because the Medpay/PIP pays-out before your health insurance does). Some versions also pay you lost wages and such that your health insurance does not.  The policy you have is a 25/50/50. This means it pays-out up to $25k for injuries to any one person / up to $50k in total for everybody who is injured put together / and up to $50k in property damages for damages to other people's property that you are found liable for. (This doesn't have anything to do with the collision coverage for your car.)  They're recommending 100/300/300 for those limits. I see 100/300/100 a lot. $300k is a lot of property damage coverage. I only recall ever handling two claims with property damage over $100k and those were both people who caused the complete destruction of tractor trailer trucks and their cargo. So if you destroyed a new Ferrari or wrecked somebody's tractor trailer truck, or caused a multi car pileup you could hit those limits. Possible, but maybe not likely depending where you are.  Th UM limit you have ($25k) and what they are proposing ($100k) is what you get when you get t-boned by an uninsured red light runner and you're left sitting in a wheelchair for life. And that's before the lawyers and doctors take their cuts. I personally carry a million, though I'm overexposed to the bad side of all these types of claims because that's what I do for a living. You may not be able to load-up on the UM coverage without taking out an equal limit on the liability coverage first. This costs more of course. Ultimately it's simply up to you how much tolerance you have for risk vs. how much money you want to spend."

Insurance,3985qx,bigpapajon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"I carry $100k, though I have a high deductible health plan.   Also it's pretty cheap.  From the perspective of a young/new driver it may also make sense because a car accident is the most likely way one would end up in a hospital.   With a pile of PIP/Medpay you just hand them your auto insurance number and walk out. No health insurance deductible or copay shit or bills to deal with. To me, just not having to deal with that makes it worth it.  Some carriers only sell $1k or $5k or $10k in medpay. Some others sell up to $100k."

Insurance,396m9v,britt5689,10,Tue Jun 9 17:43:56 2015 UTC,Well yes it is legal and their insurance company is requiring them to require you to carry insurance. The insurance you will be buying will cover you for liability in the event you accidentally do something that would cause a liability loss. One example is if you bump someone in a store and accidently injure them that would be a liability loss on your part.

If the renter didn't have insurance, the apartment owner's policy would cover it.  The correction from MSCantrell was due to you using the term exterior. The building interior/exterior divide is a feature of condo owner/association policies. Whereas a apartment owner's policy would cover the entire building inside and out and the renter's policy would only cover the building if the renter was liable for the damage."

It's just good sense, every renter should have renters insurance, even when its not mandatory.  I have 3 different friends who either lost stuff in an apartment fire or things were stolen, and they never recovered any of it and had to start over with their belongings, laptops and PC's lost, many even cover things like your guns if you own any. There are also a bunch of other things they include, but you can learn about those when you go shopping for insurance."

You are going to be viewed as a high risk driver (I'm sure you understand why) and that is going to cost you.  If you try to game the system and something happens it will likely come out in the investigation (the adjusters have seen this situation before) and you will be in a world of hurt.  Look for a high risk carrier (watch out for hidden fees), drop everything to the legal minimum (not generally something I suggest but better than nothing) and then bite the bullet.  Keep your nose clean and the rate will improve."

Insurance,39608b,4runfun,4,Tue Jun 9 14:36:06 2015 UTC,"the first thing to understand is that agents do not extend coverage and many times they provide inaccurate information and pretty much just get in the way.  they will not help the situation and will end up being just another person involved.  I highly doubt the policy covers purely anything that is sudden. if it were that simple they would state it on the dec page and wouldn't need a ""policy.""  I work for a major insurer and handle claims under many policies.  we will not cover the interior damage without an opening on the exterior caused by a sudden storm (or vandalism, etc).  if the prior owners or flipper patched the roof or failed to properly flash the area, then it suddenly leaks into the home a few weeks later after you have moved in, then we would not cover that.  if the insurer cut holes in the ceiling then sounds to me like they ""bought it"" at this point.  are they still investigating or have they made a decision at this point?"

That's the case for most commercial policies I've ever encountered. But most homeowners policies follow the ISO HO-3: open perils dwelling, no exclusion for rain."
Insurance,39608b,MSCantrell,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:35:03 2015 UTC,"that makes sense (and this is where many agents/insureds/etc get confused) except many times there are exclusions for wear and tear, neglect, failure to make repairs, defects in workmanship/maintenance.  I think you are correct there are usually no exclusions specifically for rain, unless it enters due to an excluded cause mentioned above.    I can't speak for all policies, but most probably follow the HO3 with some tweaks depending on state laws or insurers or whatever.  as you said, if the cause of the opening is not determined and rain leaked in and there are no related exclusions, then it should be covered damage.  I would like to get on the roof!"
Insurance,39608b,thatguyblah,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"The insurance agent whose deciding this hasn't even gotten on the roof yet.  Would a home inspection, and roof broker counter against the exclusions since we did our own due diligence before we purchased the house?"
Insurance,39608b,MSCantrell,4,Tue Jun 9 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"Would a home inspection, and roof broker counter against the exclusions since we did our own due diligence before we purchased the house?   I can't think of a situation where it would. The roof is still there, available for inspection. Regardless of what someone might have thought about it in the past, there is a set of facts about what happened to let the water in, and someone can learn those facts by inspecting the house.   Either:    The water came in because some covered damage opened the roof up (wind, hail, lightning, etc). The water came in because some non-covered problem opened the roof up (deterioration, defect, etc). The water came in without the roof being opened up (blown in around gaps at the siding, through a vent, etc).    It sounds like they've committed to covering the interior water damage for you. Whether they cover some or all of the roof will depend on 1./2./3."

If it's deteriorated, worn, or otherwise just old it's not covered. (EDIT: Just realized this hail storm predates your policy. If that's the case, there's no coverage for the hail to the roof, period, full stop.  But there should be coverage for the interior depending on your policy IF it looks like it happened that date only, and wasn't ongoing from the date of the hailstorm every time it rained as long as you have an All-Risk HO policy.)"

But if there's other issues to the roof that caused it to leak that are either wear/tear/age related or previous/old damage, that wouldn't be covered. At this point, until your adjuster either does (or hires out a roofer for) a roof inspection, it's all speculation. By the way, what does ""wood looks like it should look for being 61 years old"" mean? Is it rotted?"
Insurance,39608b,MountainGoat84,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"Nope, what caused the loss. The cause of loss is the root. If your house was hit by hail a year ago, then you found out because of a leak, the date of loss would be a year ago."
Insurance,393xs9,vintage_username,4,Tue Jun 9 02:14:23 2015 UTC,"Cold calling is tough, but it is NOT impossible. In the beginning, absolute consistency is key, because you will be experimenting the first little while.   The real trick to consistency, is controlling your own thoughts. Because although possible, cold calling is a total mind fuck in a couple different ways. Your brain is in fight or flight mode, so your survival instinct will help rationalize all kinds of not great habits, in an effort to avoid being repeatedly smashed in the face (well, thats kinda how it feels anyway.)  So like a marine, or an EMS first responder, you must operate, initially, on 'muscle memory'. So while your emotional brain is freaking out, you logical side keeps taking steps toward the appointment.   First, you have to really understand that all parents, homeowners, business owners,  senior citizens, anyone with financial responsibility to another needs life insurance.  If this is is firmly in your mind, then the second most important attitude is knowing, whether the consumer sees it yet or not, that this call is one of the best things that happened to them all day. Now, I understand how this can be a tough one, but you are offering them an opportunity to secure their loved ones future after they are gone. No matter how they react, this is all you are doing, if they want to react rudely, that's on them,  and has nothing to do with you, or a measly phone call. You give them a chance to see you, and protect their family and that is all.  Thirdly, expect to hear No. For some reason this is one of the most soul crushing words anyone can ever hear, and if you are not absolutely prepared to hear it, well most agents shut down. Unlike in dating though, no does not always mean absolutely not, it just means they have a reservation you haven't heard yet. Ask for the explanation why No. You need to know the reason they are saying No, to determine if you can actually help them. No, it's too expensive, may mean they talked to another agent who pitched the wrong product, you may have the right one. There are all kinds of No that don't actually mean call over. Find out what their No is, and see if you can address that.   Have a goal as to how many calls you need to make in a day. Then over time, you can see how many Nos yiu need to get through till you find a yes. I'm sure you've heard this over and over, it's just a numbers game, meaning a certain number of No must be heard before you will get a Yes on average. Embrace the No, find out why, then address it or move onto the next call.   Use a script, alot of agents would disagree with me on this, but over the phone it is critical. You, and no one else, is going to have the attention of 100% of the market. Develop a script that gets the attention of just 25% of the market, say parents, or homeowners. Stick to the script, learn what phrases or words keep 25% of the people on the phone. The issue you are avoiding here is racing around trying to fit the script to the last call, we are mining for a specific market, parents, homeowners, so ignore for now the people who don't fit those profiles.   Remember, there are only like 4 main objections, no money, no time, no need, no interest. Develop scripted responses to these objections, so that when you get smacked in the face with one, you automatically know what to do.   It's a long topic, but these ideas you must have in place to begin with. As you go along, you will have more specific questions, and if like, I would be happy to help.   Lastly, unless it is your manager, or a top producer, don't take advice or criticism from your peers, some are trying to help, but if thwy have lousy numbers then they can't help. And some colleagues are just downright competitive, in which case they have only thier own interests at heart.   Let me know if you have specific questions, and good luck!"

Middle market commercial is really where the most opportunity is to make your mark.   National accounts is difficult.

Although I graduated with an insurance degree, it is not necessary for this field, but it does help understand policies better.   Career ladder (at least for my company, I assume it's relatively similar for others) is pretty much jumping from adjuster to a supervisor/manager. There's smaller steps or specialities depending on the company, but there's not a ton of work to get into a management position. Though a lot of people in my office have been adjusting for 20+ years and enjoy the job and seem comfortable with the salary.

Especially at a carrier, their work is the worst 10% of 10 other people's jobs: the problems, the crazies, the lawsuits, everything that sucks about being an adjuster. That's 10% of my job, but 100% of theirs. The hours are waaaaay longer for a moderate bump in pay. Once you get past that and into the big salaries that come with a title like Assistant Vice President, then you're golden. But you're not guaranteed to ever get there.   There are a couple of other routes, too. You can move up to ""General Adjuster"", ""Regional General Adjuster"", ""Executive General Adjuster"", which involves handling larger and more complicated claims. Those titles come with corresponding increases in salary and prestige.  Or you can go independent and chase storms (long hours, big bucks, lumpy income). Or become a public adjuster (represent the poor innocent businessowner against the big mean insurance company). Both of those have potential for big incomes. But they're not easy or stress-free."

I trained for 3 months in the corporate office before moving out to my area, then a few more weeks of additional training in my state's service office.   But the training itself was kind of like school: we read through some textbooks outlining all the facets of claims and general insurance. It wasn't horrible. Had some personal training and meetings with the training manager. And began handling small claims as a desk adjuster. Kept getting a bigger workload as we got more experience. Sat down and shadowed other adjusters to see how they worked. A mix of hands on training and textbooks.

The carriers I work with that will insure someone with a foreign license (2 of many) will require you to get a US license within 12 months."

You can use your experience driving in Canada but you will need to provide and mvr showing the experience.  As far as insurance in the U.S. Most of the top carriers require you provide at least 6 months of liability coverage with no lapse. As long as you have been rated on your parents policy your carrier should be able to provide a letter of experience showing this information.
Insurance,393tj2,Natruthel,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:53:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. Can you clarify what this part means?   As far as insurance in the U.S. Most of the top carriers require you provide at least 6 months of liability coverage with no lapse.    Does that mean I'm supposed to prove I was insured previously for at least 6 months, without a gap period where I wasn't insured?  I guess what I want to know is, should I try to remain insured under my parents up until the day I get my own car insurance? Or will I get a similar rate if I was insured under my parents for a few years followed by a gap?"

They'll see if they can actually use it to track these folks down, but it may only lead back to the same guy that you talked to that sold the car.  It sounds like he screwed up and didn't transfer the registration correctly if he's getting tickets in the mail.

All of this comes from that $10k.  You are on the hook for anything past that.  Your own insurance should include a coverage called Bodily Injury Liability.  This is the portion that pays for any injuries which you caused.  Once you exhaust this limit, you are on the hook for the rest.  Have you filed a claim on your policy yet?  Look at your declarations page- what is the amount listed for the limit of you bodily injury liability?   There's really no way to know the extent of his soft tissue damage.

You don't want to cancel for nonpayment of premium.  Do you have a local, independent insurance agent, or are you with a direct writer over the internet? I would recommend sitting down with them for a quick once-over of your coverages.  If you don't have towing & labor coverage, as well as rental reimbursement, get it.

It will depend on the company if they surcharge or not.

The sort of grey area here is whether or not putting in an engine that was a factory option offered by Toyota in 1986 counts as a ""performance modification"" or not.   I guess a better question to ask would be how reasonable/logical is the risk assessment procedure for vehicle modifications. I imagine that if I was able to speak to someone, explain the issue, and explain that I'm wanting to insure it as the supercharged version, they probably wouldn't see that as being totally unreasonable. However, if all they're seeing on paper is ""22 year old male with a sports car modified with a higher performance engine"", there's no way in hell they would insure it."

Insurance,3938p6,bigpapajon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:06:37 2015 UTC,"To add on to that and maybe further clarify.  The $10K thing is a result of regulations implemented in FL after being pushed by right wing interest groups and falls under the broader heading of ""tort reform.""  The basic idea is - We have a problem in FL with spurious lawsuits over auto accidents clogging up our judicial system and costing the tax payers money; therefore, from now on no one can sue over an auto accident unless it's serious enough to cause more than $10K in damages.  Damage less than $10K, the other driver recovers from their own insurance (not yours) and can't sue you; over $10K, they can sue and have their damage paid by your insurance.  So do you have insurance with decent liability limits?  And have you filed a claim?"

OP- if the local agents come up with nothing, maybe one of them will be nice enough to run a ""CLUE"" report on your uncle's property. A clue report is claim history, and it MIGHT show who the current insurance carrier is.... And if there is no insurance found then you should work with a local agent to get it insured.

Insurance,393xyb,iwearlederhosen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:02:30 2015 UTC,"How is insuring a property you now have control over- especially with no proof that there is a policy- fraud? The policy covered the insured's interest in the property- the insured is deceased. Having the property unoccupied will be a whole different risk factor to begin with, and it needs to be rated as such.   Maybe I wasn't clear on my intent- the policy on the home with the deceased as named insured should be canceled. It is no longer suitable for a HO policy, which we have to assume he has. If the term has been paid in full, they can get a prorated refund (if allowed by contract) based on the unused premium from when they properly insured it to the end of the term.   Therefore, they will have a policy- most likely a DP3- in the name of the estate. This policy should be considered the correct policy, as they have control over it. Claims go through this policy if there is one.   If something happens while the home sits vacant- or is used by someone part time- the insurance company can say that they did not intend to cover that exposure and they will be SOL.   Maybe I suck at being a criminal, but... where is the fraud?"
Insurance,393xyb,idontgetbacon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:16:51 2015 UTC,"Because it sounded like you were saying to take out a policy to get coverage in case something happens, then not pay the bill because they shouldn't have had the policy insured that way to begin with."

If you can't find it in the last 12 months of bank statements, it may be paid by the mortgagee, in which case they would have the information for you.    If you still can't find a policy, the estate should take its own policy out on the property, as you don't want to risk being uninsured.  If you then get a renewal policy, or some other document, down the road, you could then go and cancel whichever policy you no longer want."

If the endorsement specifically states that the boat is 27', then that's likely enough to trigger coverage since the intent of the endorsement is pretty clear.  That said, I agree that the endorsement is worded poorly and needs to be changed.  Since there are no past claims, there's no need to do it retroactively.  Unless you're looking to blow up the rest of your coverage and move it elsewhere, the path of least resistance seems to be to get them to amend the endorsement (likely by just amending the troubling clause or just using a different edition that has a different restriction).  If that's not possible, then I would ask them to put in writing that they will cover the claims for your 27' boat and continue to pay the premiums.  If they won't do that, you need get your agent to find a new carrier, or, if it's a captive agent, find a new agent to handle your needs."

Many insurers will only write boats that are under 30 years old, mine is an old 1974 sailboat.  Or if they do write them, the LoL is low (300k, 500k). With a watercraft I really want a million in liability."
Insurance,391s5o,superhubris,3,Mon Jun 8 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"If your endorsement specifically lists the length of the boat, I would say you're covered, but I can't say definitively without seeing the exact wording of the endorsement.

The Affordable Care Act requires plans and issuers that offer dependent coverage to make the coverage available until a child reaches the age of 26. Both married and unmarried children qualify for this coverage. This rule applies to all plans in the individual market and to new employer plans. It also applies to existing employer plans unless the adult child has another offer of employer-based coverage (such as through his or her job).

I know someone who did a lot of his own work, and ask the company asked for was proof that the work was complete and then paid all good depreciation. My company would require you submit all your receipts then I would have to use a home owner labor rate to determine what we owe you. So in that scenario your best bet is to upgrade the materials your using to get that depreciation back. (From mobile sorry for any errors)"
Insurance,38yzu0,MountainGoat84,2,Mon Jun 8 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"That's my experience, too. I currently get claims from 20+ carriers, and some just send the depreciation when the work is complete, others ask for your documentation and pay up to what you've spent, including your labor. This can even vary from adjuster to adjuster within the same company.   (Some would disallow the upgrade of materials, too. I mean, you can often get away with it, but if they noticed before they sent the check that you had installed jatoba instead of oak, they'd only pay for oak.)  Re: homeowner labor, I think all three of the major estimating softwares treat it the same way: homeowner labor is equal to the amount that the tradesperson would be getting paid.  In other words, they'd pay a wood floor contractor $70.00/hr for labor. That's $26.07 for the worker, $12.68 for ""labor burden"", and $31.25 for ""labor overhead"". If you're laying your own wood floors, you get the $26.07 only.   Your best plan is email your adjuster and ask him, ""So I'm handy, and I'm thinking about doing the floors myself. If I do, how do I claim the recoverable depreciation?"""

Insurance,38yzu0,FunandFailure,2,Mon Jun 8 13:21:38 2015 UTC,"There's no recoverable depreciation in auto claims. All auto claims are paid at ACV. (Unless you have one of those policies that buys you a brand-new replacement vehicle when yours is totaled).   In property claims when the insured has a replacement cost policy/endorsement then the damages are only paid at ACV up front. The homeowner can apply for the difference between ACV and RCV after the repairs are complete.  For example if you had $10,000 in damage to a 15-year-old roof with a 30-year lifespan than you may only get paid $5,000 up-front. You do not get the other $5,000 unless you actually fix the roof. (And the bill actually comes to $10,000).  The closest equivalent in auto claims is rental car coverage. In some states you don't get paid for rental unless you actually incur the cost. Having LOU coverage doesn't automatically get you a check. You actually have to rent a car.   TL/DR Replacement cost coverage doesn't apply in HO claims unless you actually fix the home."
Insurance,38yzu0,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:21:14 2015 UTC,"This is based off of my company and how I would handle this claim.  Looks like you've got an estimate for $10K. I pay you $8K and hold the $2K until the job is done. I honestly don't care who does the work. In fact, we don't even recommend contractors in case they screw up and the insured blames us. So after I've given you the initial $8K ACV (actual cash value) money, all I'm waiting for is proof the job is done, either by a contractor certificate of completion or just photos proving it. Then I'll release the remaining $2K RC (replacement cost) money.   $10K is the estimated cost to fix the home. If you can do it yourself for say $5K in materials, I essentially believe the other $5K is the labor cost, for all intents and purposes. Now I would like you to tell me you did the job for cheaper and don't need the remaining $2K, but we still estimated the job for $10K, so you've earned the full RC cost."

(Of course if one claims that then their license is likely also going to get revoked for some period of time as well.)    Other sudden emergency defenses that don't involve medical issues may include things like hitting black ice or being stung by a bee or wasp that was in the vehicle. These are uncommonly used defenses (and not applicable in all jurisdictions) but they may apply in certain circumstances.  You can also end up in a situation where the accident dynamics are so complex that although somebody was probably at fault there is no practical way to apportion liability.

As for a pedestrian or cyclist, I hope they would find a way to be compensated; and it's possible that the driver's insurer would choose to be generous if there's really no other option, but there is no obligation for them to pay for an injury that isn't the fault of their insured. Remember we're only talking about medical bills here, which at the least ought to be covered by the victim's healthcare policy. There's no vehicle to replace. The worst case scenario is that someone can't replace their bicycle and has to pay some medical costs out of pocket on top of a deductible.  Fault is really what determines these things. It's torts 101. If you didn't do anything wrong, you can't be held responsible for causing harm. Do they really not teach you that in insurance training or whatever you folks go through?

(seriously, I really would like to see it)   Bottom line- Somebody must be responsible, no court is going to leave a pedestrian out to dry because of a mechanical breakdown in a vehicle.  If the accident was truly caused by a mechanical failure, why did the part fail?  Was it caused by improper use? poor maintenance? improper installation? a flaw in the manufacturing process? or is it a flaw in the design?  or is it a combination of factors?  The original question was if there can be an accident where no one is at fault, and the answer is no.  Somebody has to be responsible."

Insurance,38xpth,key2616,5,Sun Jun 7 22:02:37 2015 UTC,"Typically you need capitalization, but more than that, most insurance departments theoretically review rates to ensure they are not ""inadequate, excessive, or unfairly discriminatory.""  A $1 rate would be deemed inadequate. If you had millions of dollars of capital, the insurance department would still stop you from writing that coverage.  It's rare to be deemed inadequate, but it does happen. In order to write that coverage, you'd have to demonstrate that you anticipate the cost of writing the insurance would be less than $1 per policy on average. That being the case, it is questionable whether you are even providing actual coverage at that point, so there are a couple reasons you might be denied.  So to answer your question: there aren't laws saying premium must be a certain amount, but there are regulations that would effectively stop you.  Source: I am an actuary, and I work for several state insurance departments on rate regulation issues.  Edit: Some states, I believe, have rules that allow you to charge whatever you want, but the insurance department still has the right to go after you if they think you have market conduct that could be harmful to the public. For instance, suppose you write personal lines. Then when you become insolvent, as you most certainly will, all your claimants get dumped into various state mechanisms (e.g. guaranty funds) that will administer their claims, and your remaining assets will be distributed to claimants first and then shareholders and then creditors. That is typically seen as detrimental to other insurance carriers in the state and, ultimately, the tax paying public. So insurance departments will be vigilant about carriers that seem to be doing crazy things like charging $1 and they'll come in and shut you down.  I believe the NAIC requires that insurance rates be actuarially sound (there are some standards of actuarial practice promulgated by the American Academy of Actuaries as well as statements of principles put out by the Society of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuarial Society that govern what this means precisely). That means (generally) that a rate has to be appropriate for the transfer of risk. If you are assuming $100 of risk but charging $1, that is not actuarially sound. So the insurance department should deny you.  You might be able to get away with it for a couple months before someone comes in to shut you down, though."
Insurance,38xpth,Usernameavailabl,2,Sun Jun 7 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"You question is ""will any state let me do this?""  The answer is ""never"".

Insurance,38xpth,FearStalksTheLand,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:23:24 2015 UTC,"Credentialed actuary here.  The other posters dont appear to have first hand experience with this.  If you want to sell admitted insurance (ELI5, everything you buy as an individual) it has to go through a state department of insurance for approval.  For many states, part of that approval process is a rate review.  That's where an actuary (me) fills out forms and collects data and signs their life away that the rate they want is ""not excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory"".    For the states not including in ""many"", you fill out paperwork and put it on the shelf and do whatever you want.  When your company blows up, these papers will be audited.  My license is not governed by my employer and willfully violating my license will get me thrown out and blacklisted.  So a $1.00 rate is simply impossible because you wont find an honest actuary willing to put his name on it.  Companies actually did this (extreme price competition) in the 40s and it had the effect you were alluding to.  Then my profession was created to address these and other issues."

Insurance,38v4vt,Phil_Achio,0,Sun Jun 7 06:24:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand that logic, but here's the thing. When I gave a recorded statement to their insurance company, they asked me if I had any witnesses; my response was ""Only my passenger"". The claim rep. didn't correct me and tell me that my passenger doesn't count during the recording. It was only afterwards where we got into an off tangent talk and she said that it wouldn't be word for word if I had a witness. I then responded by recalling back to the recorded statement, where I declared by passenger/witness with no correction. What a logic no-mans land, where even though there are phone calls with her owning fault and apologizing; she can just lie and save money."
Insurance,38v4vt,lime1221,5,Sun Jun 7 07:34:37 2015 UTC,"When I take my recorded statements it's to gather facts. I don't correct people, show sympathy or anything like that.  No insurance company is going to take a passenger in a vehicle as a witness.   And who is saying that the other driver told her insurance company that it is her fault?  The other driver? She is probably lying about that!  People lie all the time. They get home, think about it and don't want their insurance to go up so they lie about what happened. Unless you have evidence that it happened the way you said, you are out of luck.  If there are gas stations or other buildings around that might have security cameras you might be able to get them. Might. And do that asap!"

Insurance,38vj3a,Katy-J,5,Sun Jun 7 04:41:14 2015 UTC,"I know my company is looking into the legality of paying for medicinal marijuana, its a hot issue right now and there are ton of intersecting issues.  The main issue is that marijuana is illegal everywhere in the US.  The only places it has been ""legalized"" are states where the state government has decided they aren't going to prosecute or arrest for the offense, but in say Colorado, presumably, a federal agency could conceivably come in and arrest everyone if they wanted it.  This is a point that is often missed by most.  I have seen a legal opinion as well for PIP coverage on the auto policy that it isn't owed because the federal government defines marijuana as a schedule 1 drug, ie it has no legitimate medical uses.  How that would go towards a property claim, I don't know though.  I was asked to pay for it once in a state where it was legal and was able to get around it due to our low policy limit.  I wasn't sure if I would pay for it though because marijuana is not legal in the state my company is out of, and I would be issuing a payment from a state where marijuana is not legal so I felt like I myself might have some potential for violation of the numerous drug trafficking laws around.  I do know medicinal marijuana in some instances is paid for as part of bodily injury claims.  They are able to side step the issue though because they are issuing a lump sum injury settlement.  You aren't explicitly paying for it like you would with PIP or medical payments.  My best guess is that you wouldn't have it covered under homeowners for many the same reasons.  You might have luck with all the paraphernalia (don't know homeowners that well, so maybe not) as that stuff to my knowledge isn't illegal, but marijuana of any sort I would have to think no."

And controlled substance is defined by Federal law, not state law... (18 USC sec 811 & 812...) So, I would say that according to the insurance carriers own contract they'd have to cover it ONLY if it was legit medical marijuana.. EDIT- its actually a fantastic question!

Insurance,38v0ex,RockyPi,4,Sun Jun 7 01:41:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly before you start asking for our advice, here's what I would do. Get your wife to open up a new email addressed to her boss. Re: Insurance Concerns. Read your OP out loud to her and have her put it into her words. Then add ""Could you please advise what policies the company has in place to protect me from these liability exposures?"" Then add ""Could you also confirm that as a 1099 employee I'm not covered by workers comp?"" Until you know what coverage is already in place it's hard to know what you need to provide yourself. Having said that, an umbrella's not a terrible idea."
Insurance,38v0ex,forneusFQ,2,Sun Jun 7 12:38:42 2015 UTC,If she gets a  1099 she has exposure as a business operator. Will need a  GL policy.
Insurance,38v0ex,951jimbo,2,Sun Jun 7 03:11:51 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily - and in all probability, definitely not.  While she may fit the tax definition of a 1099 contractor, she fits the definition of a ""temporary worker"" because the work is seasonal and she's working at the sole direction of the parent organization - as best demonstrated by the variance of who rents the vehicles.  However, it's also best practices to expand the definition of employee to include 1099 coaches in this case.  I imagine that US Lacrosse has an insurance program that either the wife can join directly or use via her employer.  Pretty much every sport from fencing to football has a program for liability coverage for the amateur levels.  When I've worked with other sports organizations with this exact scenario (specifically mountain bike coaches, youth baseball and a few other groups), we specifically make sure to define 1099 coaches as employees via endorsement.  The big issue, though, is going to be the Auto, and none of the organizations that I've worked with have ever been able to cover that Hired/Non-Owned exposure, mainly because it's potentially huge to the point of being program-destroying.  I would also ask the employer what they think about covering that knowing full well that they most likely can't afford it.  My personal recommendation is that your wife not transport athletes anywhere if that's possible.  Otherwise, you two need to buy the highest umbrella limits you can afford - juries hate injured kids, and even if your wife isn't at fault injuries that are bad enough will drag you in to financial responsibility.  tl;dr - OP, have your wife check with her employer on what insurance she already has.  If they're stupid and haven't bought anything, check with USA Lacrosse (or whatever the governing body is) to buy what will probably be very affordable personal coverage.  But your Auto concern is very real and most likely not covered by anyone - your wife should avoid driving athletes wherever possible."

The whole point of my advice to ""buy the highest umbrella limits you can afford"" was that the personal auto and umbrella would cover it.  But it shouldn't be left to the personal auto side since there's a chance that this could be construed as a business relationship."
Insurance,38v0ex,key2616,2,Mon Jun 8 14:04:18 2015 UTC,"I was thrown by your last sentence of the tl;dr, where you said the auto concern is most likely not covered by anyone.    Unless she's transporting the kids for a fee, I would interpret this as a carpool situation.  Without seeing the actual wording policy, obviously I can't say for certain one way or the other, but I wouldn't think there would be coverage issue on the personal side, if she has a typical policy, and as long as she has high umbrella limits.    Agree that the LLC could potentially have some issues if they don't have hired/non-owned coverage."

US Lacrosse does provide some coverage (http://www.uslacrosse.org/membership/insurance.aspx), but upon inspecting the Transportation Liability portion, it appears its intent is to protect the club and not necessarily the coach/driver. We've got $500,000 Liability limits on our auto now (mom was a a UW and later Independent Agent and I'm a UW, so a little crazy about stuff like that) but may look to increase it to $1mm if feasible.  The driving is definitely my main concern, since she's sometimes transporting up to 12 girls at a time. I'd love if she could avoid it, but its a service that the program offers (essentially letting the girls travel with the team/coaches - the program charges the parents whatever their costs are plus a nominal fee) and my wife is then responsible for said kids."

Either way, i think i'll still look at increasing our Auto Liability to $1mm, and possibly at an umbrella - would i be looking for something x/s $1mm or $2mm (Assuming the $1mm from our personal auto, $1mm from the above, and then x/s of that)."

Anything that exceed those coverage you will be on the hook.

You may want to reach out to an enthusiast community for whatever make your car is and see how others handled this situation. But let me say this. IF you are going to remove parts, you need to put OEM parts back on, and don't cause damage while doing this. The insurance company can work with you on the value of aftermarket parts but you are right, you won't get dollar for dollar. It will be tough establishing what they are worth on the market used as they are. So you need to decide if your time is worth whatever you think you will get for those parts. You are going to want to look at what the parts sell for used, you may be surprised how little you will get for them. Make sure your expectations are in line with reality.

Insurance,38ucts,951jimbo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:07:58 2015 UTC,"The insurance company told my mother most of the time if the car is totaled they wouldn't let the people buy it back. And if I can buy it back I'm not sure I want to go threw that much trouble because I have no where to keep it while I part it out. I just want some of the smaller items on the car.   So if I did take the ecu out of the car and they totaled it and it goes to be repair, parted out, or scrapped I should be fine? Or would you recommend not doing that.   Should I cut my losses and just fight with the insurance company on the value of the car? Will they even fight with me on all the modifications to the car? That's what I don't want to happen is that insurance says the modification are aftermarket we can't help you and then scrap the car. That literally hundreds of dollars being scraped when I just want a few parts off of it.   Thank you for your time! I really appreciate it."
Insurance,38t7ps,TheBlackKanye,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"In Ontario the biggest driving cost of auto insurance is accident benefits coverage (which is mandatory). Unfortunately not much can offset this cost.  Increasing your deductible will lower your rate a bit, but be prepared to have to pay more out of pocket if you are in an at fault accident.   Shop around as much as you can.  Contact insurers which may offer discounts for low mileage use of the vehicle or insurers which may use driver tracking to obtain discounts for safe use of vehicle.   More than anything be sure you know what you are actually purchasing with your policy.  Because auto insurance is so expensive in Ontario most people seem to say ""give me the cheapest"" and not really understand how limited their coverage may be."

You'll either owe money at the end of the year or get money back at the end of the year based on the income.  The tax credit is an advance tax credit.  It can either be used monthly or can be collected at the end of the year.  I would be cautious so you don't end up owing a ton at the end of the year.

Insurance,38rezr,dutchesse,10,Sat Jun 6 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"First of all, never, ever take a clinic's word that they accept your insurance. If I could have one thing stamped in bold letters on every piece of mail you get from your carrier, this would be in at least the top 3 things.  Here's why: nine times out of ten, the average person isn't aware that there's more to your policy than just the carrier. There are networks. When providers become participating or in network (or accepting insurance), this is what they base it on. So they can choose to go with a Medicare PPO or HMO (which you may or may not have depending on your circumstance), but you may have a commercial line (using as a hypothetical here,) that's an NPOS and they can still tell you, if you ask, ""Yes, we accept that carrier,"" because they technically do even if it's not your actual policy. They aren't lying  or misleading you, in this case. You have to be incredibly precise when you ask these questions, but even so, I still wouldn't ask your provider's office.  Here is how to avoid this in the future: ask the insurance company you are with first if someone you want to go to is in network with your plan. Call the number on the back of your card. And for the love of god, get a reference number, write it down, and verify it with the person you speak with after every single call.  Now, here's the part you are not going to like: you are, unfortunately, likely to be on the hook for this one. This is not on the insurance company because of the above reasons.  It is very strange they are not offering you a payment plan, though. Was it the provider's office or collections that told you that? Regardless, I'd call into your insurance company's customer service (see the number on the back of your ID card), get someone on the line and explain to them that you understand the mistake you made, but if they would be willing to make a 3-way call to the provider's office to see if you can be put on a payment plan. If they are out of network, the insurance company can't apply as much pressure on them as if they were in network, but at least you have someone who will help you advocate for yourself (if the rep is worth their salt; I do this for a lot of my Medicare/Commercial members.)  If this doesn't float your boat, you should be able to pursue Grievance and Appeals or your state department of insurance. Though, this case seems fairly clear to me, there may be more we're not getting, so don't be afraid to explore those avenues."
Insurance,38rezr,TiedinHistory,3,Sat Jun 6 14:39:02 2015 UTC,"This matches my experience most closely as well. Often times, offices will say they accept an insurance and they do...as far as submitting the claim and seeing what comes back, it doesn't necessarily mean they are contracted (or, as dutchesse said, they are contracted on some networks but not yours). Providers that are contracted are responsible for accepting contracted rates (so they may charge $400 but have a contracted rate of $280, and they couldn't bill you for the difference beyond your insured responsibility), following balance billing rules, and meeting certain medical standards.  dutchesse is on point here throughout. Personally, I'd also call your insurer to see if they're willing to talk with your doctor to work out a payment plan (no guarantee, insurers can't put pressure on a company they aren't contracted with for you), or possibly inform your doctor's office you're willing to go through all available grievance routes.   Best of luck."

Like I said in the original post I realize now that I should never take a clinic's word on that. As I said, I didn't know that at the time but after this I realized why that's bad.  It comes back to naivety.   I had asked them to check everything and make sure it would be covered before we committed to the procedure and they input all of my info and said everything was okay - I don't know exactly how that part works, shouldn't it have popped up saying ""bro, this won't be covered by us"" if they ran the insurance beforehand using my specific insurance information? That is why I find it strange that they ran my cards and took my copay but that insurance still declined payment. As far as what's happening with regards to the overall situation (office thought it was covered, insurance said ""piss off, bill him"") I understand that.   I will try seeing to a three-way call with the office and insurance and myself, to see if that resolves anything.   Can you elaborate on the Grievance and Appeals bit a little?

Nope. I'm not with the providers so I can't tell you each and every detail, but I can tell you this, in that these following things are not uncommon:   Providers receive very limited information from the insurance company. When they input the info, it's mostly to check your eligibility (do you still have an active policy?, etc.) Again, most providers don't know explicit details about insurance networks or even how it works in general. You'd be very surprised at how many receptionists and other administrative folk don't know that the carrier is not an indicator of network status. They may know they accept it for Medicare, but not other lines, and will go off that. If you have out of network benefits, they may apply. I can't speak to how common this is, but I've come across it several times that the providers just don't care whether or not you are. Money is money.    That is why I find it strange that they ran my cards and took my copay but that insurance still declined payment. As far as what's happening with regards to the overall situation (office thought it was covered, insurance said ""piss off, bill him"") I understand that.    Did you actually have a copay? Like, was your responsibility a flat, even number? And do you normally have copays otherwise? This is a huge detail I'd have to know before giving better advice for your situation.  Never, ever, ever pay shit up front is the other thing I'd have in bold print. You should be waiting for an explanation of benefits from your insurance, then a bill from the provider before you pay anything ever and in that order (unless you can go online and see if claims processed; the bigger name companies do this for their members.) If a provider makes you pay first before services, you run (unless you know they are out of network.)  This is a shitty move some providers pull to get more money. Not all of them do it out of malice, but all will take advantage of your naivety if you let them. Medicine is a business and they will not turn away extra money (which is understandable as no one would.) And if they don't have a contract with your insurance, the carrier can't enforce anything.   Can you elaborate on the Grievance and Appeals bit a little? I have no idea what that is, how to use it, etc. As I said, I'm young and my parents used to take care of all of this for me but now I'm on my own and never learned about this stuff so that's why it's becoming an issue in the first place.    G&A is a process that varies from state to state and possibly carrier to carrier. It's basically where you write a letter to the insurance company and tell them why you think their decision is unjust.  Because it varies from state, lounge of business, etc. I can't give specifics as to how long it may take. Some may roll from 30 days, others can be up to 90 days.  If after a review they agree with you, they'll notify you in writing and make whatever change they see fit. If not, you'll still be notified in writing.  In each Explanation of Benefits or claim you receive, it's that long, boring legal spiel. Read it. Otherwise, if you call customer service, a rep should be able to break it down for you as well."

This is a huge detail I'd have to know before giving better advice for your situation.   Yes. I believe it was 25 dollars for this visit, which is very normal for practices that are not directly part of the company that provides my insurance. For example, if I go to one of their facilities, the copay is 10, but if I go to an in-network but not the same company office, it's 25. Sorry, I can't really explain it better than that. I also know it can be more or less depending on the nature of the doctor visit. Certain things are more expensive, like advanced procedures. This one was not considered to be ""advanced"" and the copay was 25 dollars to the best of my memory.   TLDR I always have copays. Everywhere I go. I've never had one more than 50 dollars, and they are usually 10 or 25 dollars.   Edit: I don't really know very well what determines the copay amount now that I think about it, because my therapist is not the same company as my insurance provider but her copay is always $10, but I always have a copay, and 90% of the time it's either 10 or 25 dollars."
Insurance,38sriz,lustrate1,3,Sat Jun 6 14:29:41 2015 UTC,"I believe by excess policy they may have meant that the person's liability limits have been reached. I would call your adjuster and ask if there is anyway umpd would cover for your rental, but something tells me it may not. Next bet might be small claims court but im not sure if it's worth it.   Last resort would be to check if either insurances have discounted rates they could hook you up with for a rental."
Insurance,38sriz,claimsclaimsclaims,2,Mon Jun 8 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"You need to get a reason why they won't  cover it.  An excess policy typically  means that it is excess to a primary carrier.  So if GEICO is actually excess then they would not pay until the limits of a primary carrier are exhausted.  What you need to do is call them, ask them why they won't cover a rental and if you don't understand  the answer ask them to clarify it until you understand. If GEICO  is excess you need to get in touch with the primary carrier and get them to cover the rental.  Exanple: Sally has a GEICO  policy with 50/100/50 limits.  Sally borrows her friend Steve's car which is insured with Allstate  for 25/50/25 limits.  Allstate  would be the primary carrier and GEICO would be excess meaning GEICO will only pay if Allstate  exhausts their limits."

Insurance,38r6fc,JustAThoughtfulGuy,2,Sat Jun 6 02:55:51 2015 UTC,"I just want to go ahead an congratulate you on the amount of research you have done already. Most people don't have a single clue what their insurance does for them and only look at the price of the stuff.   Before I say anything your premiums will be high if you are out on your own and not on your parents plan. Something you and your girlfriend should keep in mind. (Even if you live independently from them.)   The course is dependent on the state. I know AZ for the company I work for does not give a discount for a safety course. (Unless it is for a motorcycle.) See the answer above. If you two live together insurance companies will still rate you on the plan. It is because they know that you might borrow the car for only a ""couple times"".  If you can only get rated on your girlfriends car then I would say you would pay less. You still have to remember that teenagers are rated high even if they are female.  I would recommend a liability plan for this vehicle. The vehicle is old and the amount of money you would pay for comp and collision could be saved to pay for parts when you do have an accident.  See question 5. Definitely go for a higher liability limit plan to cover you and your girlfriend from having to be in debt just for hitting someone else. Really that is the most important about car insurance. Pretty much all insurance.  I would say to go to an agent. After having the experience in an agency it really opened my eyes to the online vs agency companies.    Hope that helps!

In terms of proving the other women didn't live there, the first agent told me my daughter needed to bring her current lease in so she could prove who did live there and she needed to bring copies of her roommates insurance policies.  I told him her roommates were college students and I didn't think their parents would be handing over copies of their insurance policies to my daughter.  I asked him if she could bring copies of their ""Proof of Insurance"" cards.  He told me no, it had to be the full policy.  That's when I went looking for another agent.  Initially, I just wanted to see if they could explain it better or if they said the same thing.  The second agent was much better, explained the issue and accepted my daughter's roommates ""Proof of Insurance"" cards instead of demanding the policy.  She also didn't ask for my daughter's lease.

It won't provide coverage for property owned by the person operating the motorcycle either.   Each vehicle's collision coverage would cover those damages and all 3 would have their own deductible. Your friend will be pursued for the damages to all three, maybe.   Does your friend have any other policies such as an umbrella or is he a student away from home for school? Maybe his parents have a policy that will cover him for some of these damages?  This is a tough position to be in but these are all standard rules in place to prevent people from taking advantage of the insurance systems."
Insurance,38nvqc,tommiebooyy,8,Fri Jun 5 12:51:38 2015 UTC,"I think exclusions are very state specific. In KY, you cant exclude anyone. In OH, a carrier I have uses this phrase (cant copy and paste it)  In consideration of this policy continuing in force at the premium charged by the Company, its agree that there is no insurance coverage with XXXXX for claims or suits arising from ""accident"" and subsequent ""bodily injury"" or ""property damage"" caused while a covered ""auto"" or any other ""auto"" is being operated, driven or used by the excluded driver identified below, whether or not the named ""insured"" has given express or implied permission.  It does go on to say  ""The exclusion does not apply to those coverages we are required by law to provide. However, the most we will pay is the minimum amount required by law.""  So, it sounds like they're saying they wont pay anything, but then they say theyll do what the law requires. Im too lazy to look at what the law requires.

Insurance,38ogjb,HSASpreadsheetGuy,3,Fri Jun 5 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the premiums are going to be your decision point here. The PPO is the better plan (lower cost-shares, more coverage with deductible met), but if the premium difference is notable and you don't get sick often, the HSA may make more sense for you. Also depends how much you may take advantage of having an HSA."
Insurance,38ogjb,TiedinHistory,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:33:28 2015 UTC,"For PPO it is $186.28 month $500 deductible  HSA it is $143.60, the company contributes $1000 with a $3000 deductible"
Insurance,38ogjb,TiedinHistory,2,Sat Jun 6 12:03:47 2015 UTC,"To me, the HSA is the choice in that scenario.   I used HSASpreadsheetguy's sheet (it's pretty fantastic) and plugged in your numbers and it matched my first intuition.   If your medical costs are <$2000 in a given year or >$6000 in a given year, the HSA is your better choice. You have to consider the HSA is giving you, effectively, a $1500 head-start between the premiums and the HSA contribution, and that the first $500 goes towards deductible on either plan. Additionally, the HSA has a lower ceiling of potential costs when you consider you start off with 1k (MOOP), so if you have a bad accident and $10,000 in medical expenses, both plans will meet their max, and that 1k advantage means less medical costs with the HSA plan (edited for clarificaiton).  I am excluding the OON Benefits on this one, but if you were in a situation where you saw a lot of OON providers, that may swing it more the other way. Also, I think the PPO has an appeal if you want to stabilize your costs more and don't really want to think about it: you would likely pay more but not have to think about more than a copay for your most common services. The $1000.00 towards the HSA would help with that on the other side though.  Since you rarely see a doctor, I'd probably go for the HSA and try to stack up the money year over year."
Insurance,38lmcn,ThunderAndRain,9,Fri Jun 5 00:38:11 2015 UTC,"Sure it's legal. You are going to be looking for an 'inland marine' property policy and will name the owners as loss payee.

Insurance,38lmcn,roxtafari,3,Fri Jun 5 01:16:53 2015 UTC,"This request doesn't make sense to me. The equipment should already be insured on the businesses commercial package policy/Inland Marine floater. Any damage you cause to the equipment would be covered subject to the exclusions. If they're reimbursing you for the cost of insurance, then it's really no different at all from them insuring it and paying the premium. They own it, they should insure it.   Does anyone else not see the oddity of this request? It's like a contractor asking an employee to insure the businesses lawnmowers that he uses."

Insurance,38lmcn,tommiebooyy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:10:55 2015 UTC,hrmm. Well I still think its silly for them to have an employee insure THEIR equipment. The owner(s) of the business should have the proper coverage in place instead of transferring the risk to the employees. But at the end of the day if you really want that internship I guess you have no other choice. When you do call around for some quotes be prepared to have some perplexed agents. I do totally understand what the business is trying to do here but its impractical for all intents and purposes...
Insurance,38lmcn,aedmiston,2,Fri Jun 5 16:49:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they can do that. Basically what they'd do is loan the equipment to you and require you to insure it in case you break it while using it. The carrier may ask for some sort of documentation of ownership with another document showing that the equipment is in your care, but for a schedule that small it's not likely. Your employer would be listed as the Loss Payee; basically just means they get paid before you do.  You'll be getting an inland marine policy/business personal property floater, they both mean the same thing: insurance for property that doesn't stay in the same place. You'll need a spreadsheet with make/model/serial numbers/cost for each item, unless it's all cheap stuff. I have several carriers that don't require an equipment schedule when the items are worth less than $500/item."
Insurance,38lmcn,tommiebooyy,2,Fri Jun 5 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"completely normal in the commercial insurance world. BUT there needs to be some insurable interest, so there must be rental/lease agreement for said equipment. They can't just hand you the equipment with no contract. If they did that and there was a claim, and you had the proper insurance- your insurance company will ask for the rental contract. If there is no contract, the claim will not be paid. That being said, as a practical matter what they are asking for is pretty silly. Good luck finding an insurance company that will give you a 4,000 inland marine policy without charging an arm or a leg. ""Minimum premium"" will be in play here. This production company is getting some impractical risk control advice from someone..."

Insurance,38lmcn,izznt,3,Fri Jun 5 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"Well, remember for most HO policies if the loss happens at home it's covered as someone else's property in your care/custody/control. The rider just covers when it's left on the bus. And I know what you mean, but if your local school hands out 145-200 pieces of musical equipment to students tomorrow and (g*d forbid) a tornado hits, could they afford to replace it all? Or would it be the death of the school's already underfunded music program? Most schools around here couldn't take the hit. And maybe parents make sure little Julie is more careful with that violin if they have to shell out $250 if she loses it."
Insurance,38lmcn,tommiebooyy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"true. I guess we might assume the school's insurance does not cover items off grounds or whatever, and yes I forgot schools are underfunded to begin with and music programs under-under-underfunded."

We see this all the time if the equipment is going to be mostly in the employee's care, custody, and control and/or the company in question has a lot of employees with a lot of their equipment out in the field. Commercial policies tend to have high deductibles and limited coverage for BPP/items that are damaged or lost off the location on the Declarations. To try to specifically insure each item on an endorsement with the specific risk and location of the person who will have it all the time is a logistical nightmare.  Same happens with schools, by the way... which is why Junior's (edit: school-owned) trombone for marching band is almost always covered on a rider on mom and dad's policy."
Insurance,38lmcn,RockyPi,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:02:34 2015 UTC,"This can be easily added to your renters/homeowners policy (or your parents) at a very cheap rate -- probably around $40 annually. That said, there is NO insurable interest if you do not own the equipment and have no financial duty to replace it - have you signed anything saying that you will? It just seems so odd, as most COP policies will cover property off premises, and if the insured is large enough they should have some sort of floater to cover this type of stuff.  EDIT -- Is it possible the empolyer has a deductible that is close to or greater than the value of the equipment, and, with a smart agent telling them that if this were added to an individual's marine policy that would likely pick up First dollar, is trying to avoid paying a deductible? Be careful because at that point the two carriers are going to share in the loss and your company will probably be pissed off."

Maybe call a captive agent (Allstate, State Farm, etc.) too. Your association bylaws will have information on what limits and coverages you're required to have.   Since you had a lapse in coverage, expect a surcharge. Your association may have some sort of additional penalty for not having your unit insured, but that's a separate issue from the insurance itself.

I really don't even know where to begin.   There are two things you need to do, simultaneously if you want - find an agent and get the insurance requirements from the insurance folks.  I'd talk to your local folks to find a 2 or 3 good local agents - hopefully at least one captive and one independent - that are known for doing a good job.  Then you can take the specifications to them to either fulfill or tell you where to push back (which is a definite possibility).    Hopefully that makes your life easier.

When my wife started her catering business we called the agent for our regular insurance since we've been with them for 27 years and the rates were like 3 times what we ended up with going through an agent who specializes in business insurance.     Based on the potential risks of furnature repair relative to the risks with my wife's catering business, I can't imagine your policy is going to cost very much. Our insurance is less than $1k per year and it's a million dollar injury (sick from bad food) and also million dollar liability in case she damages someone else's facility."

The risks of a furniture repair business are completely different than a catering company.  The rest of your advice is fine, but telling the OP that he can expect to pay $1k in premium when even the OP has absolutely no idea what he will be required to buy is a huge disservice to him.

Well you most likely have a discount for being ""claims-free"", which you'll lose. Plus you'll then get a surcharge for having an at-fault claim, which can be pretty significant. This claim can follow you around for 3-5 years depending on the company, and will show up if you decide to move to another company.   There is no deductible as They would be filing a claim against your insurance.   Also, when they sell the car, the claim could show up on the Carfax or whatever and lower the value of their car quite a bit more than the damage that has occurred. Generally, people don't like buying cars that have been worked on, and a dealership will use the claim against you if you try to trade it in.   It's up to you, and you should consider other's advice.

Whether it was a $500 bumper or a totaled BMW, that won't change your rates, it's the fact that you have the at-fault accident and lose the discount."

Like everyone else said already, this is a 50/50 liability based on the facts of loss. This is not just an opinion, this is factual truth based on the rules of the road.  Where you live does matter. Wisconsin has what is called modified comparative negligence ""less than"" rule. You cannot recover damages if you are of equal fault, only if your percentage contribution is less than the other party. So, you can only recover if you are up to 49% at fault. In this case being 50/50, you cannot present a claim against each other and must pursue your own insurance for repairs. In other words, the other driver can't come after you and you can't do it either for them."

There is a difference between it being something have a responsibility to do, and something  we choose to do.    It's an unfortunate reality that there were so many unscrupulous shops ""taking care of deductibles"" and being complicit in other forms of fraud, that we were basically forced into double checking all of you for accuracy.

Some people want their car to always be in immaculate shape. I totally get it, it's always the brand new car that gets dinged. But, there is a cost involved.  If you decide to submit a claim. Lets say it's $1500. Your deductible is $500. So the insurance company pays $1000.  First, you will likely lose any claims free discount you have. This sucks and can cause a small increase. Sometimes it can be large.  The big thing, and this is what most people fail to account for, is that you may or may not have a significant claim tomorrow, or never. So, lets say you smash a deer next week. Now, youve got 2 claims. The first one ($1000 paid) you look at and say ""I wish I didnt turn that one in"" but its too late. Now, you're rates are insane for 3-5 years and theres nothing you can really do about it.  I dont know the extent of the damages, but I want to make sure you get the big picture on this. The $1000 payout may or may not cost you more than $1000 in the long run.  It's a tough decision for people to make. I dont want to scare you into not turning in a claim, but factor in things like how many cars do you have? Whats your total premium today? Do you have young kids who will be getting licensed soon?"
Insurance,38luni,UnhelpfulReply,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:15:28 2015 UTC,"Short answer is yes it should be covered if you have full coverage with comprehensive and collision. Long answer is it may or may not make sense to make a claim. Depending on the type of collision you have you will be susceptible to your deductible which could be more than the cost of the damage itself. Also, depending on your insurance company you could see your rates change at renewal for making a claim, even a ""not at fault"".   I would suggest going to a collision center and getting an estimate on the damage first to see what you are dealing with. They may also be able to simply buff out the scratch depending on the severity. If it's going to be a significant amount to fix, then call your insurance company and see if it makes sense."
Insurance,38luni,sparta719,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:50:20 2015 UTC,"Heres what I can see for damage:   Light scratches near plate, not too deep.  Scratches on rear bumper, not deep at all.

Edit 2: Actually my deductible is $1000."

I mean if someone is currently selling one for $9000, then couldn't the OP, before the accident, have sold it for $9000?

Also look into an umbrella, in my state a $1,000,000 liability umbrella generally costs less than $200 per year(as long as you don't have a bunch of teenagers driving)  Raise the liability on your homeowners policy.  Our policies default to $300,000, but carrying $1,000,000 is only $8 per year more.  It's ridiculous how cheap that much more coverage is."

Insurance,38itwo,tommiebooyy,2,Thu Jun 4 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"all good advice here, I will add if ""combined single limit"" is available in your state, get it. Its a more flexible coverage than split limits. Pick a combined single limit that matches your net worth at the bare minimum. Also future earnings can be fair game in lawsuit so take that into consideration. For best protection you want your liability coverage (not only auto but personal liability as well) to be net worth plus 10 years income, and you can accomplish that by adding an umbrella if the max auto liability limits are less than that formula."

Insurance,38itwo,tommiebooyy,2,Thu Jun 4 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"sounds a bit extreme I know, but hey insurance is for all those ""what ifs"". Keep in mind that a liability umbrella is one of the best deals in the insurance world. Where else will you get 1 million in coverage for $200/yr or so? Other benefits- the liability does follow you worldwide (with most carriers). This can come in handy if you're renting/operating a vehicle that is not ""in the United States, its territories or possessions or Canada"". Most umbrella policies give you auto liability overseas, since your auto insurance is limited to the united states, the umbrella will ""drop down"" in another country."
Insurance,38itwo,dan_232,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:32:56 2015 UTC,Good stuff.  My insurance company told me that I can get an umbrella policy after the 250/500 auto insurance level.  Is this correct?
Insurance,38itwo,britt5689,2,Thu Jun 4 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"correct- you need to have minimum ""underlying"" limits- and its usually 250/500 on the auto and 300,000 or 500,000 on the homeowners policy. BUT- if you take 500,000 combined single limit on your auto insurance you'll get a nice discount on the umbrella due to having a better underlying coverage amount."

And this is your first collision claim.  If you do indeed file a claim, you may see a rate increase, depending on your company, but I wouldn't worry about being dropped.  And in the off chance that you do get non-renewed, there are plenty of companies that would be fine with that record."
Insurance,38i9an,NYAgent112,3,Thu Jun 4 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"While the homeowners claim would have no bearing on any price increases for his vehicle, I wouldn't completely say that one has nothing to do with another.  Our underwriters often look at the claims history of an entire household's policies when deciding whether to non-renew or not due to claims frequency.  They'll look at the home, autos, recreational vehicles, motorcycles, even the usage of things like emergency road service.  The whole big picture is often considered when an insurance company is trying to decide whether they want to keep the household as a customer or not."
Insurance,38i9an,joeboo5150,2,Thu Jun 4 16:06:09 2015 UTC,"Very true, and good advice. Depending on your state's laws and your carrier's eligibility rules, high claim frequency alone may or may not be sufficient reason to nonrenew your policy. While the claims from one type of policy may not be able to impact the rates on another, I know for certain that when I get a request to make an accommodation (for example, in not applying a surcharge at a renewal, or staying on a policy despite it being ineligible with my company, or reinstating a policy following a cancellation for non-payment of premium), I look at the entire account. Your auto policy may be spotless and you may forget to pay your bill, but if we've been looking for a way to get off of your homeowners policy for awhile because it's junk but we can't legally nonrenew or cancel, you bet I'm going to deny your auto reinstatement and hope that you'll take your home elsewhere as well.

I have a body guy that I may ask his opinion of this. If it's under $1000, I'm going to just eat it because the deductible is $500, and if I register an accident claim, the other $500 would be coming as additional premium several times over so I may be better off handling it outside of insurance."

Generally in the cases of smaller accidents you'll be paying a lot more on your insurance than the accident actually would have cost you out of pocket.  As for the other 2 claims, comprehensive generally doesn't effect your insurance rates much for filing a claim on it and the deer goes under that coverage. The homeowners claim I would suggest being very careful on filing any other claims on your home. Many insurance companies will cancel your home coverage after 2 claims in the last 5 years. Then you will have to go to a higher risk market and they are normally 50% to 400% higher on rates than a preferred carrier."

They do have several condo programs, but they're location-specific, and I don't know if Southern California is one or not.  Also, you can see if the insurance agent that places the coverage for all of the condo buildings can help you out - they have a vested interest in making the owners happy.  You should also ask your neighbors who they use - water damage is notoriously a multi-unit loss (not always but usually), and if your neighbors had the same problem, they may have the solution.  Finally, you should ask your friends if they know anyone in insurance who may be able to help.  One thing that you should realize is that this isn't personal.  Insurance companies aren't judging you when they won't renew you or offer a quote - they're judging risk, much of which is out of your control (e.g. the roof, pipes, etc.).

Insurance,38jgxo,aedmiston,4,Thu Jun 4 17:53:32 2015 UTC,I would love to have SO much money that I didn't notice 1500-2000 dollars magically being drained from my checking account.   EDIT: I swear to god nobody balances their check books anymore.
Insurance,38jgxo,britt5689,2,Thu Jun 4 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I swear to god nobody balances their check books anymore.   I don't balance my checkbook since the online tools can do it faster than I can, but I do review every charge and transaction on all of my accounts."
Insurance,38jgxo,key2616,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:07:11 2015 UTC,That was my first thought when you first said it - people still balance check books??  I look at my checking twice a month on paydays and say Yeah that balance looks like it could very well be correct.  I really need to get better about that.
Insurance,38jgxo,forneusFQ,7,Thu Jun 4 19:02:56 2015 UTC,I know ultimately it is our fault and we should have noticed the charge sooner   That's where the problem lies.  Full stop.  You're blaming Allstate because of your own failings.  Be an adult and take responsibilities for your screw-ups.
Insurance,38jgxo,key2616,8,Thu Jun 4 18:40:47 2015 UTC,"This isn't allstate's fault, this is your crappy agent's fault and partially your fault as well. Didn't you notice money missing for TWO years? Stuff like this blows my mind. I balance my check book monthly and I would have noticed after month 1 if somebody was taking money from my account."
Insurance,38jgxo,britt5689,7,Thu Jun 4 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"How in the world is this anyone EXCEPT the OP's fault?!  He continued to pay a bill for OVER A YEAR without noticing.  Yeah, he's due something back, but the onus is on him to pay attention to his own bank account.  I'd even feel sympathy at 6 months, but this is well into ""special snowflake"" territory for me.  The initial mistake may be the agent's, but anything past the first couple of billing cycles is fully the OP's."

Insurance,38jgxo,key2616,2,Thu Jun 4 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"people make honest mistakes and this is why there are consumer protections exist.  Allstate should have no issue cancelling back to 2014 so long as proper proof of replacement coverage is received. I see it all the time. Insureds do some stupid, though unintentional things. Client added vehicle to their policy over 1 year ago, sold it in like 2 weeks to a family member and failed to inform us to remove it from their policy. Dumb dumb dumb. Carrier was willing to remove the vehicle going back over 1 year with proof that vehicle was insured elsewhere and letter signed by the insured. and this was 100% the insured's fault.  Not sure why allstate being such a dick here.  If OP telling the truth he/she DID advise allstate to cancel, so I see this as like 75% allstate/allstate agent and 25% insured fault.."
Insurance,38jgxo,tommiebooyy,7,Thu Jun 4 18:57:08 2015 UTC,"Fifteen years ago, before there was such a thing as auto-payment, this kind of thing would never have happened.  But they went through at least one renewal.  Does Allstate owe them a refund?  Sure.  Is 90 days enough?  No, I'd agree that they probably owe more.  The full freight?  No, there's a difference between consumer protection and a lesson in adulthood.  For the record, I hate these fly-by smear posts.  It's always someone with an axe to grind convinced that they're 100% right and that the evil corporation is just out to personally screw them.    I agree that honest mistakes can be made, and at 3 or 6 months, this thing still was one.  But there comes a point where a line HAS to be drawn and personal responsibility takes over - everyone is welcome to form their own opinion on exactly where that line should be, and mine is that we are well on the other side of it in this case."
Insurance,38jgxo,key2616,3,Thu Jun 4 19:02:28 2015 UTC,Totally not allstate's fault.  If nothing else your agent should own up and use his E&O Coverage to get your money back.
Insurance,38jgxo,nrdk0r,5,Thu Jun 4 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"I doubt filing a claim on his E&O policy for the amount of premium paid is worth it, but it's definitely something that the agent should be responsible for assuming OP has proof of cancellation request."
Insurance,38jgxo,Del-,2,Thu Jun 4 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The agent just needs to eat this one. However, I had something similar happen to a client when they switched agencies (a previous allstate agent totally wrecked the policy) and they were able to get a refund from over 2 years back so I know allstate will refund it, especially with proof of other coverage."
Insurance,38jgxo,britt5689,3,Thu Jun 4 18:41:01 2015 UTC,Errr....this is an E & O Claim all day.  My two cents.
Insurance,38jgxo,musicalmechanic,5,Thu Jun 4 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that.  Yeah the agent made a mistake, but it was a mistake that should have been caught when it was still correctable.  OP made payments for 15 months, which by the way, is at least 1 renewal, probably 2 and possibly 3.  Agent made an easily correctable mistake.  The insured's ongoing lack of attention is what caused it to get out of hand."
Insurance,38jgxo,NYAgent112,3,Thu Jun 4 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"If it actually happened. Unless they have a written cancellation request and proof it was sent to the agent, OP doesn't have a leg to stand on."
Insurance,38jgxo,aedmiston,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree for the most part.  OP was a dunce in this case.   Still, if OP had any proof that this conversation happened, it'd be the agent on the line normally.    I retract my prior statement about E & O since I (for some reason) figured they had proof.  After re-reading the original comments, he doesn't mention it.  lol"
Insurance,38jgxo,musicalmechanic,3,Thu Jun 4 22:29:42 2015 UTC,"Anytime I've had a call like this where the insured didn't realize they were being billed for 1+ year, the conversation with the agent has generally gone like this:  ""Man, I wish I made enough to not notice a year's worth of auto insurance premium missing from my account.""  OP, this is in no way Allstate's fault. A good deal of the blame does sound like it lies with your agency, but a vast majority of the blame lies with you for not confirming this, not following up, and not checking your bank account."

Insurance,38hn2b,NYAgent112,4,Thu Jun 4 12:40:10 2015 UTC,"To answer the last question first, by law, you are not allowed to benefit (i.e. collect twice).  You probably won't be hurt monetarily at the time of loss. (Although you will be hurt by paying more premium than you should, an it will probably cast you a lot of time and confusion in the case of a loss)  As for what happens, this is the way it will go down in theory:  There is a clause in ISO-based insurance policies called the ""Other Insurance"" clause.  I would imagine that most policies have something similar written in.  What it says is that if there is other applicable insurance, each policy will pay out in proportion to the total limits carried.  So, say for instance you have 2 policies, 1 with a 50k/person limit, and 1 with a 100k/person limit.  You get in an accident and you are found liable for 30k of the other driver's medical bills.  Policy A will pay out 10k and policy B will pay out 20k.  Similar process would be applied to any property damage liability.  This is all theoretical according to the letter of the policy.  In reality, I imagine there will be tons of confusion and finger pointing and headaches."
Insurance,38hn2b,Worker_Lurker,2,Thu Jun 4 13:41:03 2015 UTC,"You can't receive two insurance payments for the same damage if that is your question.  Insurance is supposed to make you financially whole, it is not supposed to make you better off.  If you were to get paid twice for a single loss that would be insurance fraud.  However, you might be able to get an original business auto policy and an excess one.  That way, if your original policy didn't pay enough to cover the cost of an accident the excess one would kick in, protecting your assets.  If you are into the excess idea look into an insurance product called ""personal umbrella""."
Insurance,38hn2b,aedmiston,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:18:58 2015 UTC,"You won't get paid twice, if that's what you're thinking.  Some (maybe most, I'm not sure) property policies have a clause stating that if there is duplicate coverage, they will pay a portion of the damages equal to their portion of the total insurance. So if you have two policies, one with a $50k limit and one with a $100k limit and you have $15k of damage, the $100k policy will pay $10k and the $50k policy will pay $5k. I'm not sure if this applies to auto policies or not, but it's stupid and nobody does it anyway. This was in my study guide for my licensing exam but I've never seen anyone actually do this."
Insurance,38hn2b,HorseKing,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:35:54 2015 UTC,Insurance companies have been around for a long time. You'd only be fooling yourself thinking it could possibly benefit you at all.
Insurance,38hn2b,Phil_Achio,0,Sat Jun 6 00:48:15 2015 UTC,Wouldnt benefit at all from doing this. Essentially its a form of insurance fraud so what it will hurt is both companies could deny whatever claim you put forth and have both policies canceled. And then it would be nearly impossible or very costly for you to get even one policy again. Insurance is a contract of indemnity to put back in the same financial position as just prior to the loss. Having two policies could make it so you could actually profit from a loss and that's not what insurance does.   Nearly company would be willing to pay out on a claim like this as you are not acting in good faith by getting two separate polices on the same vehicle.
Insurance,38hn2b,NYAgent112,2,Thu Jun 4 11:19:32 2015 UTC,"It's not fraud.  It's dumb and probably costs the insured extra premium, but it's not fraud.   Of course, the insured can't collect twice for the same loss, but having a duplicate policy is not a valid reason to deny a claim.  In theory, the two companies would coordinate and pay out proportionally."
Insurance,38hn2b,potters2643,3,Thu Jun 4 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"Of course it's fraud, especially asking about it the way he is.  I can see the sly grin and wink from here."
Insurance,38hn2b,Kittyisnotaninja,3,Thu Jun 4 17:48:44 2015 UTC,Totally fraud. You are making a claim for the same damage on two different policies. As an adjuster I wouldn't hesitate to transfer this to our fraud unit and smile when you're charged for being slimy.

Insurance,38fpzh,PA-Agent-Broker,6,Wed Jun 3 22:52:18 2015 UTC,"It's not a good idea to leave a car where it's incurring storage fees. They're gonna add up fairly quickly, and just like the company said, they're not going to pay for those fees. I'm not sure how it is in Texas, but in some of the states I work claims for have problems with tow yards/shops trying to make money off of the storage fees. The insurance company still has to inspect it, it doesn't matter where. It just makes it easier for the company to move it to a salvage yard, have it inspected there, and if it's a TL, they don't have to move it again."

Insurance,38fpzh,ttho10,4,Thu Jun 4 12:48:19 2015 UTC,"The shop wants to collect more storage fees, it's as simple as that. Total loss settlements are influenced in no way by the location of the car."
Insurance,38fpzh,turboscooter,3,Thu Jun 4 02:55:03 2015 UTC,"Typically your insurance  is moving the vehicle so that they do not rack up more storage, allowing them to move  the vehicle does not give up your right to it.  Until you sign over the title you still own the car.  And it won't make one shred of difference.  Your insurance is going to give you the same amount regardless of where it is."
Insurance,38fpzh,northofindy,3,Wed Jun 3 23:11:05 2015 UTC,"The valuation should be done in exactly the same manner no matter where the vehicle is located. What you make of the offer is up to you. You still have recourse if the car is moved - only you (the owner) have the power to sign the car over to the insurance once you agree on a settlement.  Lowering the offer based on possession of the vehicle is acting in bad faith, and I doubt any insurer or adjuster would attempt something so reckless. If you disagree with the value, ask for their methodology and review it in detail with your adjuster. They will likely have a detailed report that supports their valuation and they should be able to explain it to you and answer any questions."

A good option for saving money is also reviewing your annual mileage to verify you are being rated correctly.  A really good option is also looking at multi line discounts... Auto/home is a big discount, auto/ rent is small but can make a difference on large premiums. Also life policies are not too expensive and they can help on premium.  Your agent can help you with a review of the available discounts, some times you can save quite a bit. :)"

Insurance,38fh6s,forneusFQ,2,Thu Jun 4 02:15:03 2015 UTC,"First of all, love your username.  RA Wilson fan?  Second, here is the actual letter from the insurance commissioner that the story you linked is referencing.  The short answer to your question, as far as I can tell, is insurance for earthquakes caused by frakking doesn't exist.  With the OK DOI investigating, maybe legislation will be passed to change that situation.  It really comes down to the language in the policy and you can see from the policy language quoted in the commissioner's letter that most policies include the word ""natural"" in their specified causes of loss.  A policy that didn't include the word ""natural"" would be more likely to cover you, but I have no idea if a policy like that exists.  I'd advise you sit down with a local agent who might know which carriers in OK would be your best bet."

Insurance,38ecks,tommiebooyy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:41:58 2015 UTC,Not sure if it's because of credit as much as it is based off your prior insurance. We run a credit report and a CCDB which brings up past insurance information and since our rating are tiered and the system defaults to whatever is the best tier CCDB wise if you had insurance with 10/20 limits for a year your rate won't be great but if we pull that address and see your parents 20 years with 250/500 you will get a much much better rate.

We don't do credit score rating on auto in MA, but if you live with your parents we are allowed to give you a multi-car discount and the homeowners discount if you are with the same insurance company as they are. So the advice of 'if you move out, it will go up', could be factual.  It's possible that in one household, it's using the total score of the household, though this typically isn't done. If so, then everything seems correct.  EDIT: Turns out I'm wrong about the credit scoring and it's not possible that they do that. So your agent is in fact shady."
Insurance,38ecks,eastindywalrus,3,Wed Jun 3 19:21:52 2015 UTC,My company will allow multi-car discounts and multi-policy discounts if there are other policies with the same company for other household members. But using someone else's credit or insurance score? Not unless they're a named insured. No way. I'm going to echo the advice of others in this thread: Run away and yell that you need an adult.
Insurance,38ecks,BuffaloQuotes,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:17:25 2015 UTC,"The one main thing to know about insurance is that there are exceptions to every rule. Each insurance company does things a little differently and submits their rates differently to the state.   Despite what others are saying, one of my agency's companies, Preferred Mutual, will give children in the household their parent's credit score. On top of that, they also give the child multi-vehicle and multi-policy discounts. This specific example is in NY State.   Another company allows a vehicle to be titled/registered to a child up the age of 26 while being insured under the parent's policy. Again, must all be in the same household.   Again, these examples are for NY specifically. I'm sure, though, there are other companies across the country who offer similar benefits."

Protecting their best interest does not involve taking the word of a stranger that you hit their car.   There is no time limit as to when a decision needs to be made.

Insurance,38ege6,autopornbot,2,Wed Jun 3 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"All right. Without seeing your exact policy, I'm going on conjecture here, but let me see if I can explain this in a way that may make more sense.  Typically, copays do not contribute to deductibles. Under most, but not all policies, you generally have a deductible and then either copays (so, a set amount) or coinsurance (a percentage) kicks in.   and the therapist charged my debit card because of the deductible   Right away, this makes my hair stand on edge.  In my experience, what happens in these situations is that the provider is not sending the claims to your actual insurance company but basing it on the feed from the insurance carrier. This is not accurate and many times (again, not all), for a provider to be in network, there is an agreement in the contract between the provider and carrier that they are supposed to send the claim to insurance first. Typically, the provider does not get the most updated information, either.   But on my statements, it says I have paid none of the deductible, despite 3 trips to the therapist, who claims I've now satisfied the deductible. The insurance statements say they paid my therapist for the first visit - the full amount minus a $5 copay (even though I paid ~$98 to the therapist on my debit card). For the next two visits, the insurance statement says it paid nothing, with notes for one that my insurance was terminated. The next said it doesn't pay for out of network doctors (although I got this therapist directly from their list of providers).   So, there's a few things that could be happening here.   Your policy is fed into systems incorrectly; your provider may be seeing an outdated policy whereas the insurance is seeing something else. In the time when you first went and subsequent visits, the contract with the provider could have been terminated. Although they may have given you a list, in general, contracts are subject to change. It is your responsibility before you see a provider to verify they are still in network. Most insurance companies will allow for providers to terminate the contract at will. If the provider is kind, they will notify you. If they are not, insurance will likely not notify you either because of A. short notice, B. we have no idea if it is something you will be continuing (you could have changed your mind on this specific provider, etc.) The customer service rep you spoke with was not looking at your benefits correctly.   Personally, based on the information you've provided, I'm willing to bet 2 is the likely culprit. Your out of network benefits will vary depending on the policy, but if they are out of network, you either will have very low or no coverage. This is because there is no contract for them to hold the provider's feet to the fire with (and therefore get discounted rates in addition to mandating certain procedures so you, as the member, get certain benefits you may not be aware of.) They are not required to tell you up front.  There's a lot of things that could be going on here. Customer advocates certainly are a thing, but if I were you, before going to the doctor, therapist, etc. ANYTHING, even preventive services--check that they are in network first and if you speak to someone, get reference numbers.  You can also go to your state's department of insurance, but in this case, I think it really is a matter of the network status of your providers based on information you've provided us."

ACA seems like an attempt at socialized healthcare, attempting to work through the old system of private insurance. A system built to do something quite different than the goal of the ACA.

Insurance,38dc2s,super_dork,6,Wed Jun 3 14:05:59 2015 UTC,"Typically they only pay for the damaged portion, though it's possible they may pay for a refinish/stain of the floors in that room to make them match. It really depends on how much you think the repairs to the water damage will be. You have a $4k deductible, plus you will lose your loss free credit. In addition, if you have made prior or claims or if you need to make claims in the future you may be non-renewed for frequency of claims. Homeowners insurance is really for situations in which the amounts are very high or you are not able to pay out of pocket. If you deductible is $4k, I'd say anything under $7500 worth of repairs isn't worth filing a claim for, personally. Yes. That sounds like a maintenance issue. If it is just old, or the prior contractor did a bad job, the insurance company won't pay for this. If it's damaged due to an insurable loss (big branch fell on it for example), then it may be covered. I'd start by getting an estimate for repairs. Once you know how much all the total repairs will cost you can make an informed decision about filing a claim. If you decide to file, call your agent first to discuss, and then call the insurance company and ask to file a water damage claim. They are correct. You will likely lose your loss-free credit if you even file a claim, whether or not you get paid."
Insurance,38dc2s,BuckEm,2,Wed Jun 3 14:18:55 2015 UTC,"Right. If your floor is a domestic species like oak, it's almost always feasible to replace the damaged boards, then sand the undamaged boards, then stain all the boards, and have them match.  The widely-accepted rule of thumb on flooring is ""entire rooms, up to doors that close."" In other words, if the living room is damaged, they'll probably fix the whole living room. If it continues down a hall and into a foyer with no doors, they'll do those too. If it enters a bedroom there past a door that closes, they'll probably stop at the door.  I would agree. How big your check is vs. the deductible is a matter of personal judgment, and $4,000 ded + $3,500 payment is somewhere around where I would draw the line too. But it's up to you.  You won't be able to ask your insurer to re-do the bricks, no. Not unless something suddenly happened to them (hit by a tree, hit by a vehicle, hit by lightning). Your policy almost definitely excludes lack of maintenance, deterioration, and a whole set of related gradual problems.  Yes Not just a scare tactic. Everybody keeps records of claims that are filed. That sounds oppressive to some folks, but consider it from the opposite perspective. ""Ok, guys, we need to make a system for how we can delete our records of some of the claims people have filed that resulted in $0 payments, but not all of them, and make sure that we don't accidentally delete any of the ones we might need someday.""

If you were not on their policy then it probably went up so much because you were added as a driver to their policy. You'll have to see if your parents company will allow them to exclude you on their policy once you get your own. Keep in mind if you're excluded you would never be able to drive their Accord, even in emergencies. Most companies also put a surcharge on their policies for having an excluded driver so it may still be higher than the previous rate even if you're excluded. If you don't live at their address they may be able to remove you completely unless you're a student.   My question is, is this normal?    No but it happens occasionally. Middle aged people tend to have access to more discounts than younger people do so when you're on their policy you're getting discounts you don't have access to. With those discounts it's usually much cheaper to stay on their policy until you move out.   If so, should we transfer the car to my name and should I get my own insurance?

Insurance,38e7qn,aedmiston,2,Wed Jun 3 22:17:57 2015 UTC,"Most insurance companies have a good idea of who the best drivers are so it's not so much that company GEICO thinks that 30 year olds will have more accidents. They also have to deal with competition with each other so some companies actually prefer higher risk drivers as there is less competition. The premium is usually high for high risk drivers so they can make some profit with them.   There's also the type of insurance products they offer. State Farm and Allstate do auto, homeowners, life and financial products now too so they prefer people who own homes and want all of their insurance policies with one company. They offer big discounts for having your auto and homeowners policies with them. While smaller companies might only offer auto insurance so they have to target a different market.  I'm sure there are more reasons but you're probably better off asking an actuary or senior underwriter as they are the people involved in insurance rate making."
Insurance,38dem8,dum_dum_dummm,6,Wed Jun 3 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Depending on the carrier (most, but not all) your rental car is covered for certain things. ""Fully"" is a trap word that insurance agents will damn near never include in their answer.  If you have comp and collision on your owned auto, this will apply to a car you rent. However, you will be responsible for your deductible and it will show as a claim on your claims history (if you have a claim).  Next, most insurance companies do not cover the ""loss of use"" that rental companies may or may not come after. If you wreck the car and they cant rent it out for a week, you cost them around $210. Your insurance likely wont cover that.  Furthermore, some rental companies will seek diminution of value. This is the loss in value to their vehicle. Since most rental companies sell their cars after so many miles, by damaging it, you have cost them more money. Again, most insurance policies dont cover this portion.  I would make sure both of you are named insured on your policy. Being listed as a driver is not the same. The policy is broad, so being a spouse it likely doesnt matter, but its better to be safe than sorry.  If your wife is living part time in OH, her residence is still in TX.

I started my entry-level position with less than a year of teaching experience, a bachelor's and some other random, totally non-insurance work experience.

Insurance,38aux6,Cornwalace,2,Wed Jun 3 11:40:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's true for underwriters who are actually determining premiums manually in surplus markets or certain commercial lines departments, but I'm in personal lines, where the rates are almost 100% actuarial, and this couldn't be much further from the truth. I examine new and existing policies and make sure that information is entered and classified correctly to make sure that the correct rates are being applied (all while confirming that business meets our eligibility rules), but I can't imagine that there are too many people in my department who ""love math."""
Insurance,38aux6,eastindywalrus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:02:04 2015 UTC,"When you say personal lines, what exactly do you do?"
Insurance,38aux6,Cornwalace,3,Wed Jun 3 12:41:57 2015 UTC,"Personal lines are going to be policies for individuals, rather than companies or organizations. These are your homes, your personal automobiles, your basic rental properties (where you're the landlord - personal lines isn't for management companies or anything like that), umbrella policies, perhaps Inland Marine policies (depending on your company - my company can and will do standalone Inland Marine policies for individuals who have other policies with us and just want their jewelry and big boy toys and whatnot on another policy separate from their home/renters/condo insurance, but we prefer IM items just scheduled on those instead of standalone). I'll look at submissions in these categories and determine a few key things, including (but not limited to):   Whether the submission meets the state's eligibility rules Whether the submission meets my company's eligibility rules (which may be more or less strict than the state's) Whether the information in the application is complete and accurate Whether everything has been classified correctly on the policy   During the policy term, I'll also review and changes (endorsements) made to policies. Many of these are automatically issued by our system after a series of audits are performed. If the computer determines that the changes are not significant and don't require a human set of eyes to determine acceptability, it'll just issue the endorsement as requested. Otherwise, an underwriter will take a look at it and go through the steps above. Same thing at the end of the policy period - if the system determines that the policy needs a human set of eyes looking at it (if there have been certain types of claims, if someone on the policy has passed away during the term, if it automatically determines that the policy is now ineligible, etc.), then an underwriter will review it and go through the steps above, either allowing the policy to renew or issuing a nonrenewal.   Aside from that, you learn your forms inside and out, and will take calls and answer emails from the agents that you work with (at least in a company like mine, which uses independent agents). Often times they're getting you information that you requested, or are bouncing questions off you regarding eligibility and acceptability. These agents typically write with multiple different carriers, and it isn't always reasonable to expect them to you know your underwriting rules, guidelines, etc., as well as your form language inside and out like you (the underwriter) will. Certain submissions also require underwriting approval before even being submitted with coverage bound (guaranteed).   (Not sure how much of an ELI5 you were looking for, but there you go.)"

Insurance,38bj0i,DrunkBTC,2,Wed Jun 3 03:41:53 2015 UTC,You could always self-pay for the procedure.  If you did that I'd recommend negotiating a rate with the provider before having the procedure performed.  If I were negotiating I'd use the Medicaid fee schedule.  I can't imagine an outpatient cyst excision with local anesthesia costing more than $400 - $600 depending on the state.
Insurance,38bj0i,LASuperdome,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:42:21 2015 UTC,If that were the case that would be fantastic. I've heard anywhere from $3000-$12000.
Insurance,38bj0i,LASuperdome,3,Wed Jun 3 04:53:34 2015 UTC,"That sounds way too high.  That might be the self-pay rate the hospitals could use.  Hospitals have a habit of submitting bills way more than they expect to get.  That way the carriers will pay each code at the maximum rate allowed by their negotiated rates and the billers don't have to guess what the insurance company will pay.  So they may bill $12,000 but only expect to receive $500.  That probably sounds extreme but it really isn't.  Insurance carriers negotiate rates with the doctors in their network - the list of providers an insurance company provides is the doctors that accepted the negotiated rate.  If you negotiated the rate then you would basically be doing what the insurance carrier does.  The hard part about negotiating this way is you are only one person; an insurance company is negotiating on behalf of thousands of people.  I'll use the NY Medicaid fee schedule because that's what I'm familiar with: $3,000 is generally the amount for an arthroscopic knee surgery.  $12,000 is more like a back discectomy surgery.    A pilonidal cyst isn't anywhere near as invasive as either of these.  I'd imagine they give you some local anesthetic, cut out the cyst, remove the hair/pus, and then stitch you back up.  It would probably take 5 minutes."
Insurance,38bj0i,madchains,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:15:57 2015 UTC,Since you seem to be familiar with this; my girlfriend recently had to go to the ER for a possible seizure. Unfortunately her insurance had just expired so she wasn't covered for the $1500 bill(just drew some blood and an ekg). The hospital said they already lowered it from $2k+ since she is uninsured. Does she have any negotiation room since it's after the fact?
Insurance,38bj0i,dutchesse,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that would most likely be considered a pre-existing by just about all insurers.   The definition for a pre-existing condition can change slightly from insurer to insurer, but generally speaking even being symptomatic before your insurance begins can mean that the condition relating to the symptom is excluded.   Unfortunately US medical insurance is in shambles at the moment. The international market is much more stable and straightforward, but unfortunately due to US regulations a US citizen living in the USA can't purchase an international policy :(  Source: Am an insurance broker."

Insurance,38bo2t,fitsthebill11,6,Wed Jun 3 04:23:12 2015 UTC,"Nationwide sells policies direct (through Nationwide Sales Solutions) and through agents. If you don't have an agent, you can call 1-877-262-0247 and they can quote policy changes for you. Nationwide does have a way to add vehicles/coverages online but I highly recommend against it. You need someone knowledgeable to make the change and make sure you don't miss something leaving you underinsured.  You really should think about getting a local agent. Your premium would be the same either way. When you call NSS you can ask them to transfer your policies to a local agent so that you have a specific person that can help you with your insurance program rather than whoever happens to answer the phone."

My advice for transferring the policy would be to go to a local Nationwide agent and ask them to ""IPT"" your policy in.  They'll ask you to sign a form, and it'll be done within a few days.  The other great thing about that is that the receiving agent is required to do an ""On Your Side"" review of your policy once they receive it.

Insurance,38aali,lasean951,8,Tue Jun 2 22:22:11 2015 UTC,"A few notes, and I'm taking the rates over a full year and with a non-smoker's discount and using the rates starting 07/01.  Annual Cost HRA: 1529.32 HSA: 1043.62  So right off the bat, your HSA is going to cost you about 475 dollars less per year than the HRA. That is real money to consider in the conversation. That $475 is something you can put into the HSA if you would like or use for whatever you want outside of it.   The deductible is the big argument as an advantage for the HRA. The deductible is half and that is when the beneficial part kicks in. For the expenses from 751-1500, your HRA will be the better plan as it starts covering at 80% there while you're still paying full board on the HSA. The HSA offers more flexibility that you can contribute towards it (the HRA+FSA gives that flex in the FSA but FSA money dies at the end of the year).  So your questions  -The difference is that you can contribute to an HSA, the money rolls over, and you can take it with you if you leave. The HRA isn't something you can contribute to, but it does roll over, and it doesn't leave with you. The FSA you contribute to, doesn't roll over, and I'm not really sure on the take it with you rules.   -It depends how much your annual medical costs are. This is how the timeline works  HSA: You pay until 1500, from 1500-3000 they cover 80%, from 3000 on they pay HRA: You pay until 750, from 750-2500 they cover 80%, from 2500 on they pay  So for instance, if you have $500 in medical costs, the HSA is better (cheaper premium) as you're paying $500 out of pocket on each plan.  If you have $5000 in medical costs, the HRA is slightly better even with the premium savings (assuming equal contributions to your HRA and HSA accounts):  HSA: 1500 + (.2 x 3500) = 2200  HRA: 750 + (.2 x 4250) = 1600  If you have $50,000 in medical costs, it's very close to even, as the maximum out of pocket on the HSA is $500 more, and your premium is $475 less. This doesn't tax into account savings on taxes or rollovers or investments. I am suspecting at 22, you probably won't put a ton into the HSA. Really, your range is that, for the first 750, both plans are the same and the disparity shows up later.  -As for the smarter option...I think it depends on your goals and long-term aspirations. I would go with the HSA in your spot. That gives you the choice on what you want to do with the $475 extra, and as a relatively healthy young person, you could either put it in the HSA and possibly not use it (roll it over), or use it for something more relevant to your needs. If you put money in the HSA, it follows you, so if you leave Staples, it's your money. The HRA doesn't give that option. I'd take the slightly higher potential overall cost for the flexibility involved with the HSA. Hypothetically with the HSA, if money allowed, you could contribute 3,000.00 into your HSA in a year and have all your medical costs ready to pay for tax-free. That's solid incentive."

Insurance,387xjm,powerhawkmash,2,Tue Jun 2 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"Haven't had too much experience with Erie, but they're fairly good based on my dealings with them. I work in claims, so again my experience is limited. I know they are a fairly reputable company and aren't one of those fly by night, daytime TV cut rate carriers if that's what you mean.  It's definitely a good rate, and it doesn't seem way beyond what I'd expect given your profile. It could be that you just fall exactly into Erie's target market and that's why you're getting such a good deal. Unless someone else here knows something I don't, it sounds like you just got an awesome deal. Be sure to thank your agent if you decide to buy it :)"
Insurance,387xjm,forneusFQ,2,Tue Jun 2 14:24:50 2015 UTC,"They're a good, reputable company.  They're regional and only write in the midwest and I think also keep their premiums down by maintaining strict underwriting.  In other words, with some companies you have bad risks paying less than they should balanced with good risks paying more than they should, but I think Erie is one of those companies that try to keep their book on the safer side of the bell curve.  With good credit, good financials, probably live in a relatively safe area of town, mid-30s, good driving record and loss runs, doesn't seem like a crazy rate to me."
Insurance,387xjm,britt5689,2,Tue Jun 2 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"Erie has some pretty strict underwriting guidelines so they don't write people with crappy credit, DUIs, etc. which means they can keep their rates low."

Pretty pumped about it.  I had my liability only down really low but then I got in that accident and then immediately after that bought a new (to me) car.  My first 6 mo policy was like 450 but that was before the accident was finalized and showed on my MVR.  Next policy was 1 year for 1225 and then they tried to increase me to 1335!  This is going to be better insurance with lower deductible for less money I'm quite excited about it.

In my past dealings with them, my impression is that they have done a good job handling claims.

You will need the groups policy/certificate number.  I'm bookmarking this to double check with an associate of mine tomorrow that should provide a definitive answer.  Typically, just like with health insurance, the coverage was paid by the employer @ the beginning of the month, covering the insured/employee through the end of the month, however, the employer typically does have the right to have that premium they paid pro-rated back to them, in which case the insurance would have been invalid as of the termination date.  Lastly, some group life insurance policies are convertible and she would have had XXX days (like COBRA) to complete the paperwork for it. It's possible she was still in the guaranteed portion of that conversion when she passed. Usually though, this paperwork would have needed to be signed and completed by her prior to passing, but it really just depends on the providers policy.

Report it to your insurance carrier and let them handle it. DO NOT just pay the guy and walk away. What happens if 6 months from now he comes back and says ""oh my neck hurts, 50 grand for medical costs, please!""? I did read the other post and I find it curious that you can exclude a driver that isn't even licensed!

Insurance,385txd,ChumbawambaBitch,5,Tue Jun 2 01:43:15 2015 UTC,"For started people don't generally  sue for damage to the vehicle.  They usually attain counsel for ""injuries""  they sustain from the accident. And if thay are the kind of person who would do that,  they are going to do it anyways.  As an adjuster I always recommend just letting your insurance pay for it.  For starters,  most people think k they can pay out of pocket until they see the 5500 bill or something like that.  Also if you pay out of pocket you are relying on the shop to write an horst estimate when they basically know they are getting a blank check from you.  It's not like you are going to know how many hours is needed to fix it,  or how much the parts really are.  Your best bet is to just let insurance pay for it; especially if it ends up expensive.  Even if your insurance goes up a few hundred a year,  it will still take a long time to pay back a repair job of a few grand.

It might not, however, be the right answer in your situation.    If the damages are small AND no one was hurt AND you have good reason to think that another accident could increase your rates, you could be better off paying for this yourself.  All 3 of those need to be true for this to work, but if it does, it's the right choice since it will save money in the long term.  If it's something you think is the right call, you do need to be sure that you get a release of future claims from the other party so that the question you raised in the subject.  Something as simple as ""In exchange for $X, I, Mr. Claimant, waive any future claims of bodily injury or property damage against Mr. At-Fault.""

If the other person wants your insurance to handle it... guess what? Your insurance is handling it. keep in mind, this person may need a rental car (which is on you) and there could be hidden damage once the shop gets to work (also on you).

Insurance,385jer,forneusFQ,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:44:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think high risk is the right term, but insurance companies actually do apply credits/debits to policies based on how long you were with your prior company, what limits you carried, and even which company you were with.  (Source: I used to verify prior coverage and apply these credits/debits.  Don't worry about me, it's only about 75% more tedious than it sounds).  The upshot is that for this one solitary rating factor, if the Allstate policy has been in place longer, it would be better for your future rates to cancel Esurance and replace the other car on the Allstate policy with the car currently on Esurance.  But as you point out there are dozens and dozens of factors that go into your final rate, so I wouldn't make a decision based on this one thing.  Most often I saw the prior carrier info bump the premium just a little bit up and down.  Although, full disclosure, at least a few times a day changing months with prior carrier from for example 60 to 18 was the final straw that dropped the policy from standard to nonstandard and the premium skyrocketed.  All in all I think it's exceedingly unlikely that cancelling Allstate will affect you, but there is a grain of truth to what your dad's friend was saying."
Insurance,385jer,britt5689,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"Depends on the state and the company. When was the esureance policy started? If it has been in effect for more than 6 months then he's fine. Length of insurance greatly affects your rates. Somebody who only maintains insurance for 2 or 3 months at a time is irresponsible. Somebody who has had continuous insurance since they've been licensed is generally a more responsible person which means they're going to pay their bills on time, not try to file fraudulent claims, and statistically speaking is probably a safer driver as well."
Insurance,385jer,britt5689,0,Tue Jun 2 01:35:47 2015 UTC,He's had the policy with the '99 corolla for several years and we've had the insurance for the '10 Hyundai acxent since the first of March. He's also 28 and has never had an accident.  The insurance for the '99 has been in suspension ($10 a month) since December. His insurance agent for that policy is stating that of he drops the insurance entirely he will then be labeled a high risk driver. I'm assuming it's a scare tactics to get or business. Even though all state and essurace are within the same company.
Insurance,385jer,Harvrah,2,Tue Jun 2 02:41:07 2015 UTC,"Is he listed on the policy with the new car? If so, then he will have no lapse in coverage. Why don't you cancel the allstate policy, and stick his Toyota on your policy? He can still put ""suspended"" coverage on it which is comprehensive only."
Insurance,385jer,adirabethzy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:43:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, he is on both policies.  And honestly, the thought never crossed our kinda since we had planned to sell the car a few months ago.  Thanks!"
Insurance,385jer,wishiwasyou333,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:47:26 2015 UTC,Did you even call the Allstate agent to see how much it would be to add the new car onto his existing policy or did you just decide to take out a new policy with Esurance?
Insurance,385jer,tommiebooyy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:51:39 2015 UTC,According to my experience you should go for another policy when get a new car from the same insurance company after selling the older .
Insurance,385jer,BrassKnucklePunches,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:10:34 2015 UTC,"Hiya.  I work for the good hands...  On the Allstate policy is he listed by himself or on his parent's policy?  If his dad is that close with the agent, it is likely he is on the policy with his parents.  Just a thought there.  If he is on his folk's policy he will end up paying more if he leaves it, which is likely what went on.   I have a question though.  Why would you insure two cars with two different companies?  Allstate has a multi-car discount and you would likely be paying less if you insured both with them.  Not really understanding the logic there.    Just a quick thought before you jump to the whole scare tatics thing, you might want to realize that the agent doesn't have the whole story.   It sounds to me like he doesn't even know about the second car.  Also Allstate and Esurance are not the same company.  Esurance is backed financially by Allstate, but that is where they part ways.  One has no information on the other.  No one is trying to screw you over.  Have you sat down with your agent and gotten a quote on adding the vehicle and dropping the other?"
Insurance,385jer,iwearacloudonmyback,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:25:07 2015 UTC,"The policy is in his own name.   When we spoke with the allstate agent, the previous insurance was in suspension, so we were only paying to keep it in suspension (around ten a month) and technically had the insurance but wasn't using it, and the quote the agent gave us at our local allstate office was much higher than what esurance was giving us.  The agent does know about the second car and has asked us repeatedly to get insurance through him. I will admit I am very ignorant about these issues as I have only had to get insurance for my car."
Insurance,3856h2,Wonderpetsgangsta,3,Mon Jun 1 22:54:48 2015 UTC,"Your post makes it sound like you are dealing with the other party directly  and not their insurance, is that correct?  You need to be talking to their insurance.  They should pay for necessary medical care and lost wages.  When you are  done treating  they should come to a settlement with you for the total amount.  If you agree on a settlement  then there is no need for an attorney.  If you feel they are not paying you enough you can go seek the advice of an attorney."
Insurance,3856h2,northofindy,2,Mon Jun 1 23:29:22 2015 UTC,Just know that getting an attorney does not necessarily mean you will get a bigger settlement. Also know that you WILL lose a significant chunk of your total settlement to attorney fees.
Insurance,3856h2,broseph23,2,Tue Jun 2 01:26:41 2015 UTC,"But the total settlement may be larger with an attorney involved.  It is entirely possible that the actual dollars paid to the claimant would be larger with an attorney without.  The inverse is also entirely possible - that the claimant would see less.    OP, without knowing where you are and what happened, it's hard to give you accurate advice.  I can read your narrative as coming from an auto accident - which is the assumption I think everyone else is making - or I can read it as arising from a Products Liability claim or any other number of causes of bodily injury.  It would be helpful if you give us some more detail since Auto claims are functionally different than Commercial General Liability (for example) claims."
Insurance,3856h2,key2616,2,Tue Jun 2 12:06:29 2015 UTC,"So from what I have seen in claims, and I haven't handled liability coverage, attorney's do two things on claims.  The biggest thing is they grind claims to a screeching halt.  They go on for a lot longer.  The second is that an attorney generally gets better settlements, but after their fees, it isn't always much different for the injured party.  I think generally, the simpler and uncomplicated the claim is, the less you need an attorney, and though I don't know where the threshold is, I have seen claims where a party got an attorney and got less because of it.  Of course, outside of the money issue, there is the aspect that your attorney handles everything for you (though I have seen plenty of cases when their handling is poor) and for some that is huge, a lot of people just ""don't want to deal with insurance companies"" which, depending on the claim I either get perplexed at or understand.  That being said, its up to you (of course).  You don't have to decide now, the other party won't make many decisions on the claim until you are ready to settle when they will evaluate the claim all at once.    So you don't have to decide now  The other company won't argue the treatment until their evaluation at the end, though I can say not sure why chiro treatment and P/T would be needed, its generally one or the other (with most chiro's essentially being a P/T that does adjustments).  The closer you stick with what doctor's tell you (particularly from M.D.s and D.O.s and not a chiro), and the more consistent you are in your treatment (don't show any gaps you can't easily explain), the less fuss you are likely to have."

Insurance,382xq1,BrooklynFinest,14,Mon Jun 1 13:53:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd just let your insurance company fight for this on your behalf.  They have both the adjusters with experience in matters like this, and lawyers beyond that if needed.  If your insurance company believes the other driver is 100% at fault, they will probably get farther arguing that point than you could yourself.  I wouldn't trouble yourself with it, let them do it, that's one of the reasons you pay your insurance company."
Insurance,382xq1,joeboo5150,4,Mon Jun 1 15:17:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly what the other poster says. Let your insurance company argue on your behalf. It's what they do and it's why you pay them. They're also the ones who decide if they should go to arbitration or not.   Honestly, as long as your insurance company puts you not at-fault for the accident there is really nothing else for you to worry about. You're being taken care of.   Filing a complaint isn't going to help matters. The complaint makes the state look into the file to make sure they followed regulations. Nothing in your post makes it seem like they've done anything unreasonable. The state won't make them change their liability decision. Based on what you're saying I can understand their logic. I don't agree with it, but I understand it."
Insurance,382xq1,FunandFailure,2,Mon Jun 1 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I'm just afraid that things may not work out on my behalf.  Worst case, I'm looking at paying 20% of damages to my car that are estimated to be about $4500.  Not including the cost of a rental (I don't have rental coverage).  My deductible is $1000, and those costs would take up all of it.  In addition, I don't know what a 20% liability will do to my premiums.  I'm really hoping my insurance company will put up a fight for me, but I can't help but be skeptical about it.  I wouldn't be considering a complaint unless I truly felt they were being unreasonable.  Every time I tried to convince them, their response is always ""he was almost through the intersection"".  It's as if they're choosing to disregard all of the other factors in an attempt to reduce their losses."
Insurance,382xq1,MrFoolsDay,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"Your liability coverage would cover their rental, no worries there. If you do not have rental for yourself, the other insurance would owe to reimburse if you used it, or may owe for loss of use (once things are settled).  Edit: Good news with this being in PA. If I'm not mistaken, only if you are 50% or less at fault can you recover ANYTHING. Most likely you will not need your liability coverage or owe anything for the other car."
Insurance,382xq1,FunandFailure,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"Right.  I discussed this very briefly with my agent, and it doesn't appear my insurance will need to pay for any repair/rental costs for the other driver.  Maybe because he's mostly at fault?  I'm more concerned with cost for my rental.  Because I am using my insurance for repairs, and due to the fact that I don't have rental coverage, I need to pay for rental out of my pocket.  I will then submit receipts for reimbursements.  But, if the 20% liability stays, I will be responsible for 20% of those bills as well."
Insurance,382xq1,Botboy141,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Because you're going through your own collision coverage your insurance company pays for all of the repairs to your vehicle. Let's say the damage to your vehicle is 10,000 dollars and rental was a thousand, because I hate math. Your insurance company will pay the cost of the repairs minus your deductible, so your body shop will get a check for 9k. You pay the shop 1k. Your company submits a bill to the other insurance company for 11. At that point, the other company may say, ""we'll give you a check for $8,800 (80% of 11,000)"" to your insurance company. Your company will then either accept that, writing off the rest or they may take them to arbitration. If it goes to that (some months down the line. It isn't a quick process), a non-biased 3rd party will look at the evidence and make a binding decision. If they side in your favor the other company will remit the remaining balance. If the arbitration panel sides with the other insurance company, that's the end of it. Outside of rental, all you would have paid is your thousand dollar deductible, which you chose when you picked your policy.   Usually as long as you're less than 50% at-fault your premiums won't be affected, unless you lose a ""claims free discount"" or something.  You say they're being unreasonable, but they aren't really. It'd be unreasonable if they put you at fault for the accident. I mean, he did almost make it through the intersection. You said you took evasive action by slamming on the brakes. Did you submit photos of any skidmarks on the road? Is there video? Is there an independent witness to corroborate your story that you tried to avoid the accident and you weren't driving too fast for conditions? How fast were you going? There was a lot of traffic, why weren't you going slower? There are houses nearby, what if a kid on a bike tried to cross? That intersection is weirdly angled, that means the driver had been in the intersection quite a while and was almost completely through the intersection. Why didn't you see him sooner? Were you not paying attention? Where was your head facing before the accident occurred? Etc, etc. Liability is rarely cut and dry and I think they could make an argument that you share some liability. Like I said, if I were your adjuster I'd probably put you not at fault 100%, but I'd also be prepared to accept 10-20% liability."
Insurance,382xq1,MrFoolsDay,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for this discussion and your inputs.  Much appreciated.  Your description of coverage and payouts was exactly my understanding.  $1k is a lot to lose for something I truly feel I have no fault in.  After this, I am seriously considering a dashcam.  Under different circumstances, I could accept 20% liability.  Had there been no cars in the intersection blocking my view of the other driver approaching his stop sign, I could agree that I should have seen him.  It was a 35 MPH road and it did not feel like I was going any faster than that.  If anything, it may have been slower.  I was about 1-2 car lengths from where his car appeared.  I was watching the road in front of me and I literally watched his car, while reacting, emerge from between those two cars on my left side and continue traveling across the intersection right before my eyes.  He has gone on record stating that he increased his acceleration to try to avoid the impact which resulted in me hitting him where I hit him.  Under these circumstances, I can't think of anything I could've done differently other than getting x-ray vision.  Had he not accelerated and I hit his mid section or front side, what stand would his insurance take then?  Unfortunately, I didn't look for skid marks, nor did I see any, but I think the damages to my car can somewhat attest to my slowing down.  My damages where all cosmetic (broken bumper, grill, headlights).  No frame, or engine damage.  Regarding his car spinning, I don't think it takes much impact for that, just hit the right spot.  Edit:  I understand you were just posing random questions, I just felt there was enough presented to show that I had no fault.  Hopefully with the arbitration they can see it that way."
Insurance,382xq1,adirabethzy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"$1k is a lot to lose for something I truly feel I have no fault in.   If the other driver is 80% at fault, why are you not filing the claim directly through his insurance? This would forego the use of your deductible.  Regardless of fault, if you file through your insurance company, you have to pay the deductible, if you file through his, you don't, unless they find you have liability/fault and then it would be handled between the two companies IIRC.  Example: I was rear-ended ~12 months ago. It was an obvious situation where I was not at fault at all. I contacted my insurance company and they informed me I would be responsible to pay the deductible if I wanted them to handle the claim and subrogate through the other individuals company.  They suggested if I didn't want to pay the deductible, to call his company directly and allow them to handle it, which they did, I had a check for my vehicle being totaled within a week and it didn't cost me a penny/no deductible.  The advantage to filing with your own company is they want to work with you to resolve the situation as quickly as possible, but it costs you more to do that (deductible) if you are patient however, you can simply file through the other party's insurance when you are not majority at fault."
Insurance,382xq1,broseph23,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:53:37 2015 UTC,"My intention was to have his insurance pay for it.... that was until I found out they were only taking responsibility for 80%.  Before agreeing to anything, I talked it over with my insurance, and they believed his insurance should be taking 100% responsibility.  In order to make the process ""cleaner"" I went with my insurance so that they can go after his insurance for the full amount.  If successful, I will regain my deductible.  Had I gone with his insurance, I would be responsible for 20% which would then be covered by my insurance.  At that point I would still need to pay my deductible to cover the 20% and by the looks of it, 20% will be around $1k anyways."

Many companies now rate across all vehicles with driver factors and the parents rates might go up even if they never give him the keys to their vehicle. The only way around it is to have the kid buy his own separate policy and never tell them about him. It might not be illegal.  Not sure. It might be grounds for cancelation if they do discover his residence at the same address and having a valid driver's license.   Edit: never mind.

Insurance,383oao,xtboy,11,Mon Jun 1 16:59:05 2015 UTC,"First, you have to carry it on both your auto and motorcycle policies if you want the coverage for both. Since it's more expensive, you can drop it on the motorcycle but it's more expensive because a fender bender on a motorcycle will probably cause more medical bills than a regular car accident.  Second, medpay is good to have even if you do have health insurance. Your health insurance might have a high deductible or co pays that medpay will help with. Additionally, you can get reimbursement from medpay almost immediately whereas, and depending on your health insurance, you might have to pay out of pocket and then get a refund.  Third, medpay covers anyone in your vehicle at the time of an accident. So you have health insurance but you might be carrying someone in the car that does not. Depending on the state, you could be found liable for their medical bills if you were in an at fault accident.  As far as I know, medpay is not required by any state so you can definitely drop it but just know the risks of not carrying it."

Insurance,383oao,adirabethzy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, I can't speak to a New York policy as I don't handle the state.  Not sure exactly why, especially on the auto, you would take med pay due to the very high limits of PIP coverage in the state that you have to have.  This is a good question for your agent, but in dealing with agent's, you may not get a great answer as the agent's knowledge about something like that varies wildly.  I will ask my brother tomorrow who is much more familiar with New York (we both work for Allstate).  Again, not being familiar with the policies, I am not sure if you have overlaps in coverage.  In some Allstate policies, the auto med pay would apply for a motorcycle accident (or vice versa), but in other states it won't.  My guess is they probably don't overlap as that tends to be more true than not, BUT I haven't ever read a NY policy so its just a wild guess.  As for why have med pay (in general) with health insurance.  Well this is, IMO, highly dependent on the state.  In general though, med pay is a broader and more generous coverage than your health insurance (up to your coverage limit).  I mean that in the sense that chiropractic care is essentially completely covered under med pay, and typically has pretty poor coverage under health insurance.  That can follow for other types of treatment as well.  Med Pay CAN help you with health insurance deductibles and copays, but this assumes two things.  One, that your health insurance will process the claims for auto accidents.  This isn't always the case.  Two, that a provider will bill your health insurance over your auto insurance.  In some states (for instance Alabama), med pay is garbage if you go to a hospital.  The hospital has a statutory super lien in the state, they bill your auto insurance, and gobble up most if not all of your med pay at the very start.  In other states this can be true as well.  So any advice to make sure med pay is at least as high as your deductible and that is all you need, is, in the real world, crap because providers will rarely bill how you want them to.  Med pay is a useful coverage though.  I don't know what the cost of treatment in New York is, but for most of the states I have handled $10,000 is a generally good amount of coverage for most situations.    But in my mind, at least with the auto coverage, the big lurking question is why take med pay in New York for auto.  There is probably a decent reason, but I can't immediately think of anything because New York has the mandatory PIP coverage on auto, and your PIP coverage can best be described as (Med Pay plus lost wages and some other miscellaneous stuff)."
Insurance,383oao,dunno260,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:46:29 2015 UTC,"i realized because laws and polices vary from state to state, i've been reading mixed opinions on keeping med pay or not, some of which had been very confusing.  It doesn't bother me so much whether or not medpay is in my auto coverage, but more of the fact that its in my motorcycle coverage.  i understand that if anything, it'd be more ""useful"" having it in my motorcycle coverage however the cost is about $100 or so and because of this, i'm paying the same amount for my motorcycle insurance as my auto insurance.   In my last 2 years of owning motorcycle insurance ( i've had progressive and moved to dairyland, and now transfering to allstate ) i've never had medpay. I was just bit skeptical because I haven't seen it before, and assumed it was some sort of tactic from the insurance agent to charge me more or so. ( although the overall coverage is lower than my previous insurer would charge me )  also i noticed my agent enrolled me for allstate drivewise program, which i never asked for. what would your personal opinion be on that program? i've been trying to find some information about it, and although the savings would be tempting, i've read stories of how it can damage your vehicle.   ps if you could get back to me after hearing from your brother, i'd appreciate it! thanks"
Insurance,383oao,dunno260,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:28:36 2015 UTC,"Well my brother was more on the periphery of New York claims handling more than I thought.  First, in New York on your auto you have to have at least $50,000 of Personal Injury Protection coverage.  New York also has a fee schedule for services in the states (essentially the state sets the rates providers can charge).  This allows for your benefits in New York to actually last quite a bit longer than they likely would in say Illinois which doesn't have a fee schedule.  Now, as stated, PIP coverage is for more than medical bills.  I don't know exactly all what the state allows, but typically PIP can cover lost wages (the amount varies, I know in Maryland its 85% of lost wages, no clue in New York).  I know in New York you can also, depending on injury, get money to have people perform services for you (I know in some areas this includes maids to come to your house and clean, etc).  Again, the caveat with New York, I don't know exactly what services and how much coverage is offered as it could be something like $25 a day.  From a quick google search that I was able to do, it appears Medical Payments coverage in New York is secondary to PIP coverage.  So to use the med pay coverage, you would have to exhaust the PIP coverage.  This is one reason why the med pay on your auto is so cheap (also motorcycle injuries tend to be more severe and occur more often when involved in an accident).    From what I gather, motorcycles do not qualify for New York PIP coverage, so you would ONLY have your medical payments coverage to help you in the event of an accident for bills.    Again, my best guess is you don't have overlapping coverages between the two.  It is possible the med pay on your auto would cover you in the event of a motorcycle accident (and vice versa), but that tends to not be possible across the policies I have seen (though in some states it is possible).  But med pay is optional coverage (the PIP on the auto in New York is not).  Its up to you if you want it or not.  Personally, I would carry on both, especially the motorcycle coverage, but that is me.  I think the state I have my auto policy in makes med pay more useless than it could be in other states and I still pay for $10k of coverage.  I know med pay coverage is, for most insurance companies, one of the more ""profitable"" coverages that is sold, but it can still be a really useful coverage (and in the case of auto's is typically pretty cheap anyways).  I do regularly have claims where the insured does not have enough med pay coverage and no health insurance  (or really poor health insurance) and unfortunately has to then try to work out arrangements with the providers.    As for drivewise, all I can say is I know what it is.  In claims, I have no contact with that program.  I don't know how it could damage the vehicle, but I haven't used any program like it or Snapshot from Progressive.  My understanding is that it currently can only help your rates, not harm, so I would strongly consider it.  It's just a way of trying to identify drivers who are better policyholders (ie people much less likely to be in an accident) and keep them insured with you by applying a discount on the coverage.    So in the context of what I said, I would talk to your agent as well.  If your agent is any good, they will know this stuff backwards and forwards and certainly anyone in New York would know the interactions of the coverages better than I do.  Sorry couldn't be more help, but New York is one of the states that is just a different animal entirely in the insurance world.  Allstate centralizes the med pay and PIP handling for the entire US into two offices, except for New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Florida which are handled in those states.  This is due to both the volume of claims generated in those states (the average New York PIP claim generates 2.5 times more medical bills than the average clam handled in my office), but also because the claim handling in that state and laws regulating coverage are just that different from other states."
Insurance,382ezb,Tzizzle,4,Mon Jun 1 10:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, it shows continuous coverage. If you are looking to get a new policy, the new company may require proof of prior insurance so be sure to have a Dec page or other information that shows your name as a driver."

Insurance,382ezb,MalcolmWent,2,Mon Jun 1 11:28:01 2015 UTC,"You many encounter issues with just the Dec pages, as drivers could potentially be added and removed from a policy during the course of a year, and the dec page wouldn't show that. ( for example, you get taken off the policy 1 day after it renews, then put back on 1 day before it renews next year, the dec page would look the same as if you had always been on it. Dec pages won't always show accidents either). The best thing to do is ask your parent's to obtain a Letter Of experience for you from their insurance company, which will outline how long you were with them, and any claims you had (hopefully none), to verify your awesome driving record. Keep an copy for the future as well, it will come in handy if you end up switching insurers a year or two from now as well."

You're not, after all, trying to commit fraud, just correct a mistake.  And there's nothing wrong with that at all.  As far as ""downgrading the coverage"", I'm not sure what you mean.  Before the accident, your car was worth $X.  After it, it was worth $X-$Y.  If you don't pay $Y to fix it, then you're overinsuring the vehicle since it's not worth as much with the damage.  Make sense?"

It offer drivers a cheaper alternative by delivering driver centered premiums based upon actual driving style rather than statistics.Anyone who typically pays a relatively high price for their car insurance, such as young or newly qualified drivers or drivers with any claims or convictions, would benefit most from this technology.

Insurance,380s6r,lustrate1,2,Mon Jun 1 00:33:20 2015 UTC,"When your vehicle is damaged or stolen, one of the first things you should do is file an insurance claim. If another driver caused the damage to your vehicle, you have the option to file the claim either with your own insurance company, if you have the appropriate coverage (a first party claim) or with the insurer for the owner of the other car (third party claim). In order for you to be able to file a first party claim your policy must provide Collision or Comprehensive coverage . These are often referred to as Physical Damage coverage. If you file a first party claim, your insurance company will either pay to repair the damages to your vehicle or pay you the value of your vehicle if the damages exceed the car's worth. First, though, the company will subtract the deductible amount you have chosen for that coverage. If you file a third party claim against another driver, the other driver's insurance company will only pay for damages to your vehicle to the extent that their insured was legally responsible. In some instances, this may not be enough to reimburse you for the full amount of your loss. hope you get your answer?"
Insurance,380s6r,adirabethzy,2,Mon Jun 1 09:10:36 2015 UTC,"Your ideal course of action is to file on the other person's policy and have their liability coverage pay for your damages, rental car, etc.   Your backup plan is to handle it through your policy, paying your deductible, etc. Your company will then subrogate against the other company to get their money and your deductible back. If they are successful, you'll get a check for your deductible in the mail.  You should only have to pursue the second path if there is a question regarding who was at fault in the accident, which will cause delays as the insurance company investigates what really happened. Having the police report will go a long way toward settling any questions they may have, so if you can provide it before their ordering service can, you can speed things up a great deal. You can facilitate the process by being available, taking the claim representative's calls, and being forthcoming regarding what happened and providing documentation (eg, the police report) if/when requested.   Reputable companies just want to pay what  they owe promptly and settle the claim as quickly as possible."

Once we could prove that we could sell, and maintain a book of business, and had a good loss ratio we were able to obtain a LOT more carriers."
Insurance,37wyr2,britt5689,3,Sun May 31 16:27:43 2015 UTC,If you don't already have a relationship with any carriers....I would definitely reconsider this move. You are not going to get any contracts with zero experience. You'll starve.
Insurance,37wyr2,alphatangolima,2,Sun May 31 02:32:48 2015 UTC,It's not that I do not have any experience in the insurance industry. I have experience in this industry as I used to work for an agent but now I am opening up my own agency. I have contracts with a couple of carriers but I want to expand my market base so that I am able to offer more products to my clients and I think that the best way to offer more products is by getting appointed with a cluster or a general agency as that would allow me access to more carriers.

Insurance,37xo91,sp0rkah0lic,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:51:23 2015 UTC,It depends on your carrier. I've got state farm and they do a progressive age discount instead of all at 25. Mine has gone down every year since I have driven. That includes a license suspension (under 18 in ohio 2 violations and you're done) and 11 total tickets.

Insurance,37xo91,Yamuddah,1 point,Sun May 31 14:49:34 2015 UTC,Because it takes 12 points to suspend your license in Ohio and they were spread out well enough to avoid it. Points disappear every two years.   Aka I'm lucky and ticket free since 2012
Insurance,37xo91,DoDaDrew,1 point,Sun May 31 15:08:03 2015 UTC,Not at all. I'm an agent in Ohio and we check your MVR when you renew. Turning 21 means absolutely nothing. Now turning 26 when you've been licensed for 10 years is a bit of a bigger deal. We look back 5 years for accidents and 3 years for tickets.

Insurance,37uz7k,menchers,1 point,Sat May 30 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"You having a g2 license implies that you haven't been licensed that long and therefore these tickets are going to impact your rates more than a person who has had their license for a long time. No one can give you an exact price though because rates vary, however try doing an online quote with your provider with the two ticket included.  My advice? Don't bother mentioning them to your insurance provider, as they may not pull your record and you may be able to wait them out."

With a G2 many insurers will drop you with two tickets.   Step one- don't tell them. They may not run your record at renewal.   Step two- get your G ASAP
Insurance,37uz7k,5strings,1 point,Sun May 31 03:03:00 2015 UTC,Whoa they'll really drop me on my g2?!?
Insurance,37uz7k,tom158,2,Sun May 31 03:15:40 2015 UTC,A G2 comes with a very short leash. 2 tickets or accidents can result in non-renewal. And having that on your record will follow you to your next insurer and can increase premiums there.   Get your G!
Insurance,37uz7k,violatedbear,1 point,Sun May 31 14:15:29 2015 UTC,Most companies I deal with have a rule that states something along the lines of:  Novice driver with 2 or more minor conviction. Decline.   This means you're looking for a new insurer with two tickets and a cancellation..which makes life hard.   Get your G. A G2 is a learners permit with very little wiggle room.

If this is the case then just be aware that these positions are met with a high turnover rate. Which is good because you will know in a couple months time if this is the right career for you and if it isn't, well you only spent a couple months of your life trying something new out.   Here are a couple easy follow-up questions to gauge the agency. 1. What type of insurance will I be selling and what are the expectations? 2. Do you have a system in place for lead generation? 3. Do I get to quote and create new business for existing referrals? 4. Would you provide base increment pay for acquiring new licenses or achieving new milestones for the agency? (I.E. Writing the first commercial policy ever.)  Hope that helps!"
Insurance,37spsj,4th_dimensional_self,2,Sun May 31 05:39:07 2015 UTC,"This is one of those questions it depends on where you work and what position you are in. Personally I work 40 hours a week, I am one of those people who while on the clock I work my ass but when its my time I'm out. I am an adjuster BTW. I have a good friend who works for a different company doing the same thing as me and does roughly the same hours but often times he is required to work Saturdays. Where I'm Monday to Friday.  Another friend who is an underwriter and he would work the same 40 hours Monday to Friday 9-5 stuff but chooses to stay later to work ahead.  Another friend also an adjuster but works for and independent company and he can work all hours and is on call weekends sometimes. That being said he makes significantly more than the rest of us.  Then again some companies I've had contact with you work 9-6 cause ypu don't get a paid lunch. This is in Ontario Canada mind you but i assume it can very just as much in the US.  As far as liking my job I love it and so do each of my friends, we all went to school for it so we essentially chose it. But its one of those careers its very easy to move to different areas easily and there are so many different things to do in the industry its hard for it to get old."
Insurance,37spsj,Phil_Achio,2,Sat May 30 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"Greatly depends on the company and position and state.   I work in CA where there have been a string of lawsuits by adjusters working hours on end without being properly compensated. As a result, most adjuster positions are 9-5 hourly and the OT is VERY carefully watched. There are some adjusters that are ""non-exempt"" (paid salary not hourly) but that's not the norm that I've seen.   That being said, I've been at companies that have such a high claims load that it's necessary to work OT to stay on top of your stuff. You're technically only 9-5 but there's still no work-life balance. Probably just like any other industry, there's good and bad companies.   Thankfully I'm now at a good company with a GREAT position. So that's pretty cool."

I now work for a family owned and operated independent agency that claims to pride itself on offering a flexible work environment to promote family life, but only certain people are truly allowed those privileges.   I only bring this up because you didn't specify in what area in insurance you were offered a job. Pros and cons to everything."

Maybe I'm just a sucker. But, maybe I can make enough $ to change my life."
Insurance,37spsj,Maxigor,2,Sat May 30 20:22:20 2015 UTC,Not sure why everyone keeps talking about adjusters when you say agent?  Not sure if you actually mean agent (like State Farm) or broker (like marsh)  I have never been an agent so I can't speak to that but I was a broker for 8 years. On average you work between 40-60 hours a week depending on workload. The pay on the low end is pretty terrible but ramps up pretty quickly.  Many of the account execs at my firm made between 250-750k   I decided I didn't like those hours for my lifestyle regardless of the pay. I switched to underwriting were I make low six figures but only work about 35 hours a week which is what I wanted.
Insurance,37spsj,britt5689,2,Sat May 30 13:43:24 2015 UTC,Is this for a captive or independent agency? Captive agents pretty much have to do what their carrier tells them to do. Independent agents are a lot more flexible. I'm an independent agent and enjoy my job. The pay is good and I basically set my own work schedule (I work weekdays 9-4 most of the time) Sometimes I'll do quotes at home if I'm extra busy or want to get ahead for next week.

Insurance,37rpi1,broja,12,Fri May 29 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"Property claims adjuster here. I also managed a dry out company for a little while.   Yes, file the claim.  Yes, they need to start drying it out right away, and can only give you a ballpark before the job is done. Most of their bill will be equipment-per-day, so if it's dry sooner, it costs less, longer costs more.   (So why not dry it more than necessary? Good question. You're trusting them to do it honestly. You could ask to watch while they check the drying- they'll poke things with a moisture meter, and they want the number under about 13%.  But your insurance co doesn't mind paying for the dryout, even a ""cautious"" dryout, because it's way cheaper and happier than paying for mold. If your dryout guy takes it too far, your adjuster will pay this bill, give him a tongue lashing, and watch him more closely next time he sees him.)  Yes, you should expect to have it put back exactly like it was except fresh and new, and pay exactly $1000 for the privilege.  (If you want to upgrade anything, it's a good time to do it, you'll just pay the difference in the price.)  You don't have to use the dryout company for the reconstruction work, but you can.   If your adjuster has any recommendations for contractors, it's not a bad idea to take them. His only interest is to get you off his desk as quick and easy as he can. So a contractor that will make you happy is good for him. And the contractor has a good reason to keep you happy- if you tell the adjuster he did a good job, then adjuster will send him more referrals in the future.  If you want to pick your own contractor, find someone who has done lots of insurance work. The skills to fix your house and the skills to make your claim go smoothly are not the same. Sometimes I meet guys who are excellent craftsmen, but when they write an estimate that says, ""Fix damage, $5,000"", they're not doing the homeowner any favors.  Hope that helps!"

They will come out do the investigation if its not covered you pay the money to get it fixed. If it is covered you'll pay $1000 and have a rate increase for a little while that depending on the value of your home and what you're currently paying for insurance will not equal.

Reminding people about their preventative benefits and determining eligibility for things like diabetes counseling/management, surgery support programs, and other things like that.   The end result is that if you're overdue for a colonoscopy, you'll get a letter saying that you should bring it up with your doctor, or you might get a call from a nurse if you've got a complex condition asking if you'd like any assistance in managing the condition."

I don't deal much with NY these days thank goodness.  Half of the problems would be eliminated if the agents did a little fact checking before they bound coverage and we got to an audit before we realized it was wrong or worse yet the insured already had a penalty.   Just earlier this year I had an insured in Michigan who hired someone in NY without letting us know. Our audit picked it up but I couldn't add NY to the policy without an address AND The underwriting company we wrote them on wasn't filed in NY anyway. I notified the agent but never heard back until 3 months later they had a penalty letter from NY for $37,000+. Then they were quick to reply to my emails.

Insurance,37nwlm,wovi0501,2,Fri May 29 01:05:35 2015 UTC,Progressive's premium was over double Geico's premium when I checked 6 months ago. As for the high limits: a) the projected additional premium was cheap and I'm paranoid b) the premium for an umbrella policy was higher than expected ($250 for $1M).
Insurance,37nwlm,DSkogen,3,Fri May 29 01:12:36 2015 UTC,"From the insurer's perspective, the principle of adverse selection makes a request for high liability alarming. In other words, people who perceive themselves to be such high risks as to necessitate such high limits are the first people to seek them. This is not to say that this describes you or your situation. It's only an explanation as to why they may not allow their website or the majority of their internet technicians to endorse such a change to your coverage.   To resolve this, I would suggest calling GEICO's customer service; explain your situation, in that you have a great driving record and are mostly interested in protecting your assets given the cost of such limits are more cost-effective than a separate umbrella policy; and, if necessary, allow the associate to put in a request. Again, most associates will not have the authority to write liability at these limits and may require the approval of a member of management."

Insurance,37nwlm,smashleys,3,Fri May 29 16:24:45 2015 UTC,"The reasoning behind it is that they don't want to be on the hook for higher limits.

It's not a good equation for them, so they won't do ti.

Just add a buck a head to the ticket cost and you are set...it is virtually certain that someone will drink too much and do something dumb trying to impress old friends.

(like $300-500 in my experience as s broker) I know we are not supposed to name drop here but Travelers does event & wedding insurance all day every day, good coverage and host liquor liability is available. Plus if the venue wants to be additional insured they allow it. If travelers won't do because of the ""ticket"" issue, try USLI. ALso, if you have a personal umbrella policy it would LIKELY cover YOU for this- but you'd want to check with you company/agent."
Insurance,37mxev,deadvolcanoes,3,Thu May 28 20:24:31 2015 UTC,"This is a very grey area in most states...  You're right that a truly independent contractor does not need to carry comp insurance.  However, most states will side with the claimant if an injury ever does happen.  In that case the claim will likely be liable in the GC's wrap up policy or under the GC's workers compensation policy.  Either way it will likely be heavily litigated - and any discrepency will 9 times out of 10 rule in favor of the claimant.  To skip all that stuff the GC will request a certificate of insurance to bypass the potential headaches.  So to answer your question, it depends on how much risk the GC wants to take.  If they want to minimize the risk as much as possible they will require proof of insurance.  However it's not necessary.  It does make the sub more sought after if the sub has comp insurance."
Insurance,37mxev,LASuperdome,1 point,Fri May 29 14:41:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's also important to remember that what the law states and how the carriers operate may be two different approaches.  I love telling people with less than 4 employees that the state does not require them to have coverage, however, they will be held responsible for any medical bills and lost wages if there were to be an accident."
Insurance,37mxev,emptydiner,3,Fri May 29 14:48:46 2015 UTC,"In TX, my carriers pick them up unless the insured has COI's on file. The CT regulations and statutes should be online, and probably define what is an independent contractor. Keep in mind that the IRS, state governments and WC statutes may all have different tests and requirements for what constitutes an IC. A lot of people try to fall back on the IRS test, but if your statute says otherwise, that is irrelevant for WC coverage."
Insurance,37mxev,superhubris,3,Thu May 28 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"In Florida subs are picked up unless they have coverage or have filed an election to be exempt.  About your particular inconsistency in the past, sometimes auditors ""overlook"" some things, be nice, lenient, or don't even ask.  Some auditors call one time and if they don't hear back from the insured that day, they turn the file back over to the company as unauditable/non-compliant.  If there are any WC auditors on this sub, I would be interested to hear from them.  WC audits can be tough.    I tell my clients to either use insured subs or people with exemptions and to try and limit the exemptions accepted.  I've had several claims where the sub had an exemption and took some employees out to the job and got injured.  My clients WC paid the bill and all the sub cost/payroll was picked up on the policy.  And if they are accepting exemptions, make sure that person does not have any employees out there working with them."
Insurance,37mxev,emptydiner,2,Fri May 29 12:27:25 2015 UTC,"WC Auditor here. A few things:  If a subcontractor hires employees of their own, all payments to the subcontractor can be excluded if the subcontractor has a valid workers' compensation policy for the dates they worked for the insured.  This is NOT the case for individuals/sole proprietors/single-member LLCs that do not use any labor of their own when doing work for the insured. The logic here is that just because an individual owns a business does not exclude the possibility of him working as an employee for another business, and so their business' insurance does not matter when they are operating as an individual. HOWEVER, it is difficult to verify the absence of employees, and most auditors will tend to automatically exclude any entity with a WC certificate on file.  The grayest area is when a contractor is operating as an individual and there isn't even a WC certificate. Accountants, engineers, exterminators, third-party fabricators, mechanics, and other service providers who have their own job locations are easy to call independent. Beyond that, it's unusual to find individuals that I am comfortable excluding as independent. There are a number of things we look for when determining independence, but basically we're just seeing if they could be considered at-will employees, who receive a schedule and/or supervision from the insured, and who could be terminated at any time, regardless of contract.  For individuals, we also consider the nature of the contractor's work versus the insured's business; For example, if you run a maid service, you can't call all of your maids independent contractors, even if they have some level of independence. If you have an AV company that sets up stages, lights, and cameras for clients, you can't call all of your stagehands independent contractors. Basically, if your business wouldn't exist were it not for these independent contractors, we can't consider them independent. This makes it nearly impossible to exclude contractors in a construction setting - By necessity, there is a level of direction and control in construction that does not allow for independence.  I see you mentioned exemptions in your post. It is important to mention that many carriers will only honor exemptions and exclusion endorsements that have been properly endorsed onto the policy prior to the audit. Even if there's a signed denial of coverage document that the insured's lawyer gave them, we cannot take it into consideration unless the underwriters have endorsed the exclusion onto the insured's WC policy.  The strictness in which these rules are applied depends on the auditor. Some will give a pass to first-time policyholders who were unaware of how contract labor is treated. Many will bias their sample of subcontractor WC certificates to include only those entities that have certificates on file, potentially excluding amounts paid to uninsured subcontractors. Others will take a couple hours to interrogate every item on a GC's general ledger, and throw all undocumented entries into the highest-rated classification code.  Most of the audits I do are AZ, but the WC rules for independent contractors are very similar in most states. There has been a recent epidemic of obvious at-will employees paid via 1099 in Arizona, especially in construction, so I have conversations with insureds about these issues on an almost daily basis.  Let me know if you have any questions. I'd like agents and insureds to understand how the audit process works - it'd make my job a whole lot easier."
Insurance,37mxev,TheBear242,2,Tue Jul 14 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  That post was from 45 days ago but I wouldn't expect anything less from a WC Auditor.  Jab jab.  Just kidding there.    I think the exemption procedures are a bit different in Florida.  Most carriers are including officers unless proof is provided before or early on the policy but if an exemption is filed shortly after or midterm, most of my auditors will exclude that payroll from the audit.    What gets me every now and then are the new minimums for owners in construction vs non construction and the entity type, sole prop, corp, individual, llc etc.    And the differences between auditors can sometimes get daunting as well but I work pretty well with the ones that cover my areas.  Are you a member of The InsurancePros sub?"
Insurance,37mxev,emptydiner,2,Tue Jul 14 02:54:48 2015 UTC,"That exemption process for officers sounds pretty close to what I experience in AZ. Inclusion/exclusion endorsements for officers are usually pretty straightforward. I was specifically referring to the exclusion of non-officer labor which, for whatever reason, is rarely endorsed correctly.  To be clear, the rules for automatic inclusion/exclusion of officers, as well as officer minimum/maximum wages, do vary significantly from state to state. For example, there isn't a distinction between construction and non-construction in AZ... In fact, that doesn't sound familiar... I should probably make myself aware of whichever rule that is :p  I am not part of the InsurancePros sub, but I'll hang around if I'm allowed in!"

You typically get an insured who thinks youre trying to screw them. Even worse, theyll find an agent who will incorrectly insure them making you look incompetent.  I know this is a different state, but I find it to be a great bit of help http://www.labor.ky.gov/workersclaims/sac/Pages/Enforcement-Section.aspx  What we do in our office is we require our insured to get an ""if any"" or ""ghost"" policy. This will be work comp for $5,000 payroll. This will fall into min premium. We tell them ""If you use ANY subs, dont pay them unless they give you a certificate of insurance. Otherwise, your work comp will charge you for it.""  This provides coverage in the event of a claim. It prevents our insured from getting fined. It also helps when they need to show proof of work comp for a job/bid.  I will say many of the contractors get irritated when you explain the right way to do things. They like to do things under the table and this is never easy.  Also, you should join /r/insurancepros if you havent already!"

Besides primary emergency medical care, and an evac ticket back to the U.S. where you are insured once your condition stabilizes, it covers your possessions, your luggage, and things like hotels and rental cars that you paid for but couldn't use because of travel delays through no fault of your own.  A lot of people use World Nomads, which is available online.  It may or may not suck.  I don't work for them, and I know their policies differ from country to country.

Your policy in the certificate of coverage (a lot of the big name carriers offer this information online if you have online services) will outline how coverage is mandated for international services. Your certificate of coverage is basically your bible for how and what services will be covered, limitations, exclusions, etc. You don't state what kind of policy you have (commercial/group, Medicare, individual, etc.) so I'll give you what info I know.  In many of the policies I've worked with, international services would be covered as non-participating providers (because they probably don't have a contract with the carrier), so you may have a larger responsibility. This will vary from policy to policy, so do not take this as gospel.  Medicare will cover anything for emergency services abroad regardless of country. As far as non-emergency services (and this will come down to the codes used), you may be SOL, but again, this will depend on your policy.  You can also call your customer service on the back of your ID card for further clarification. But as /u/Gekko463 points out, I'd still highly recommend travel insurance."

Insurance covers cars not people so if you were involved in an accident and not listed on the policy you would still be covered under the permissive use clause.

Insurance,37nk6v,the1republican,3,Fri May 29 04:29:15 2015 UTC,"I would start by asking if you parents have a homeowners policy, if they do you should look at their carrier first because you can piggyback on their multi policy discounts. I'm an independent agent so it kills me to say this but I've seen State Farm, Farmers and American family be friendly to youthful drivers but I would shop around if you have the time.  It doesn't cost you anything but time.   The reason having your permit doesn't change you premium is because insurance companies can't typically add someone to a policy if they don't have a drivers license. Some companies may be aware that you are a permitted driver in the household but won't add you until you are officially licensed.

That means that that's what your insurance covers on your behalf should you be at fault for an accident.   The coverage you need is Collision coverage. That's the coverage that takes care of your vehicle regardless of fault, with a deductible. I can't tell you what to do, but if you have this coverage I would strongly advise you to use that coverage (stomps foot) and have your insurance company attempt reimbursement. That way you'll get your vehicle taken care of and your company would decide whether to litigate or write-off the cost. Let them take the hit, if necessary.  If you don't have rental on your policy then you'll have to pay for a rental vehicle out of pocket and then submit for reimbursement. Most companies make sure their insured is paid back first."

Thanks SOOOOO much for the help, but I do have one more question!  Is it possible to file a personal injury claim through his insurance and the property damage claim through mine? Or do both claims need to be under the same insurance? I've got coverage on my own policy, but I'm already into the process with his insurance.   Yeah, I didn't have rental OR underinsured.

Is it at all common they they would actually pay me for that expense?   Correct. Let's say you paid 1000 bucks for the rental. You'd submit your bill to the other insurance company. You should get reimbursed.   Look at the other person's liability policy as a stack of money. Every dollar the insurance company spends on his behalf is money out of that pile. That's is all that they have. There are no other piles to get money out of. The moment that pile is gone then the person, not the insurance company, is on the hook for the rest. So let's say with everything together your insurance company spends 14,000 and you spend a 1,000 for rental. The other driver now owns 15,000. His insurance company will pay 10k on his behalf and the other driver will be responsible for the remaining 5. Your insurance company may go after the driver or give up. Your insurance company could take the 10k they get and keep it, or they could say, ""Hey insured, you're our customer and we like you. We'll give you the thousand for the rental and then we'll take the 9 grand remaining.* Or you could take the other driver to court for rental (you probably won't. It's a hassle).    Is it possible to file a personal injury claim through his insurance and the property damage claim through mine? Or do both claims need to be under the same insurance? I've got coverage on my own policy, but I'm already into the process with his insurance.    Yes, you can do that. Most people do as Med Pay/PIP isn't a real popular coverage, for some reason.

You may want to verify how much the particular insurance company really cares about voluntary v. involuntary. So that's often an option too."
Insurance,37mui0,TiedinHistory,1 point,Thu May 28 20:23:00 2015 UTC,"the lag would be called a waiting period.  I want to say under the ACA the max waiting period is 30 days, and covering back to date of hire.  I might be wrong.  I know STD/LTD and a bunch of other insurance usually has longer waiting periods."
Insurance,37mui0,FearStalksTheLand,1 point,Sun May 31 02:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yep. Waiting period is a better term for it (lag is our jardon). ACA max is 90 days, although it can vary by the company (I typically handle NY groups and you see everything from 0 to 90, and a ton of different iterations in between) for what they actually have.  I will say, coverage only goes to DoH if the waiting period is 0 days. The coverage would start after the full waiting period is up as long as the enrollment comes in within timeframe."

You have ""inpatient"" (""in"", as in ""in the hospital"" as opposed to ""outpatient cover"" which covers things like your case, when you just visit a medical facility, get treated, and sleep in your own bed that night) cover that covers you when you are admitted to a hospital bed, and your terms and conditions probably say ""for at least 6 hours"".  Outpatient cover is much, much more expensive.  You have really cheap as insurance that probably has very strict coverage limits.  Don't get really hurt or sick while this is all you have.    Your cover is only for catastrophes that require you to be hospitalized for at least 6 hours, in a hospital bed.  See a broker specializing in expat health cover.  I do this, but in Asia.  Check your local expat community website to find one near you.  What did you think you were getting for $45?"

My suggestion is to wait until November/December.  You can do it earlier but there usually isn't much point.

Generally speaking they do but agents and brokers are judged by insurance companies based on the quality of business they bring in. The main thing they look it is our loss ratio which is the amount paid out in claims vs how much premium they brought in. If the insurance company paid out $100,000 in claims and the broker only brought in $80,000 in premium that's not good. The insurance company is losing money because of that broker."

Insurance,37ip1b,nimrod358,3,Wed May 27 22:35:15 2015 UTC,"Former CA adjuster.   Who were your witnesses? If they know you then they're worthless.   What part of your vehicle was struck? How wide is the intersection/how many lanes are there? If the left lane is lane one, which lane was he in and which lane were you turning into?  -The other insurance company has 40 days to accept or deny a claim until they have to send a letter saying they need more time. Unfortunately, 7 weeks for a disputed injury claim isn't out of the ordinary, especially if the other driver has been unresponsive.   -You can contest it in writing. You could also contact a supervisor. Last step is a Department of Insurance complaint. Now, the latter isn't really going to help you get them to change their mind. What it does is cause the DOI to audit their file and make the insurance company prove that they did everything within regulations. If they did then the DOI complaint won't be considered valid and you've wasted everyone's time. But yeah, I'd call up a supervisor and contest their finding. Don't get all angry, don't threaten to get a lawyer. That won't help and it'd put them on the defensive so they're less likely to help you. Calmly state your reason why you disagree. I've had people successfully change my mind before. Never because they threatened me, but because they submitted their evidence and the logic behind it. Pictures, what the witness said, diagrams, in case I missed something.   -Getting a lawyer is up to you.   -Uninsured is completely out of the question at this point. You know the other driver and they have insurance. They're just denying liability for your claim. If they deny your only recourse is to take the other driver to small claims court. If you win then their insurance company will pay your settlement up to the limits of their policy.   What may be happening is your adjuster is accepting 50% liability in the hopes that the other insurance company accepts as well. That way you'll at least get half of your damages taken care of, as opposed to the nothing you're getting now.   Now, let's say your insurance company sticks with 50 while they deny at 100. What that means is when their insurance company presents AAA a bill AAA will pay half of it. Then the other company will have to take them to arbitration. You, however, are completely SOL unless you take them to court."
Insurance,37ip1b,FunandFailure,1 point,Wed May 27 23:56:47 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you so much for your response.   The intersection was very large, 2 lanes in every direction, with an additional left turn lane. I was pulled out past the crosswalk as the second car in the left hand turn lane. The light went red, then the car in front of me went. I waited and then turned as well, which is when the car who hit me (who was traveling in the opposite direction of me if I hadn't been turning) ran the red and hit my side, mainly the impact was on the back rear tire. All the damage took place behind my side mirror (very small car). I guess the new adjuster is finding that I turned with the car in front of me, which I specifically remember telling the original adjuster I left space and had waited. And I knew the driver in the car behind me (coworker, was leaving work.) The other witness (who I don't know) had just been passed by the driver, who was speeding.   So, if I'm not mistaken, you're saying it really doesn't matter what AAA finds my fault at then? Because there's no scenario where I am getting money from them? Everything basically hinges on the other insurance company's decision?"
Insurance,37ip1b,FunandFailure,2,Thu May 28 00:15:55 2015 UTC,"All that matters, for your vehicle, is what the other insurance company decides. Your insurance company is just trying to figure out how much they'll have to pay. Whether it's 0-100% doesn't change what they'll pay you. Which is nothing. You are not getting a dime from your company.   If the other insurance company and yours come to an agreement, let's say 50/50, then the other insurance company will pay for half of the damage. They'll pay for the amount that their insured is at fault.   In CA as long as your liability is 50% or less it's considered a ""not at-fault"" accident."
Insurance,37ip1b,Zen_Drifter,4,Thu May 28 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"Not a California adjuster so I have no knowledge if third-party bad faith is a thing there but generally speaking:   Is there a time limit on how long this other insurance company can take for their investigation (that I'm sure will screw me.)?   No.   Is there a way to fight my own insurance's claim of 50%?   No. Most personal auto & homeowner policies have a clause that basically says ""we will settle claims made against you as we see fit"". In cases where the claim is potentially going to exceed your liability coverage limit you or your own attorney may have some input about their settlement with the other party if it potentially leaves you exposed to further action over & above your insurance coverage.   Should I get a lawyer?   You can always get your own lawyer or pay one for a consult. Very few lawyers are going to be interested in a small property damage claim, plus don't forget if they're working on a contingency that they'll take 25% to 33% of whatever you get. A lawyer may be able to help you prepare your case. If you're going to small claims court the judge will tend to be sort of lenient about the rules if you don't really know what you're doing so you may be able to make the argument yourself.   If my own company upholds the %50 decision and the other company finds me at 100% fault and denies the claim, would I still get the $3500 uninsured collision coverage? I have gotten 2 complete different answers on this.   I don't see where the uninsured coverage applies at all since it appears the other driver is not uninsured.  If the other carrier denies liability then it would seem your only options are to take the other driver to court yourself (or with an attorney) or do nothing.   EDIT: spelling"
Insurance,37ip1b,f1shbone,2,Wed May 27 23:53:33 2015 UTC,"There is no set in stone limit as far as settling, but there are some general rules set forth as far as claims handling. The take-away is as an insurance you have a duty to settle the claim as promptly as reasonably possible, and this includes making a decision in the investigation. It is too lengthy to reproduce, so feel free to refer to the California Insurance Code Section 790.03 Prohibited Acts. The other insurance needs to provide you, in writing if requested, with exactly what is preventing them from making a final liability decision. Dragging a claim out when a decision can be reasonably made is a prohibited act. You don't need a lawyer. You need evidence to support your statement. This is word vs word. You said the other driver ran a red light, they are saying the light was yellow and you made a turn in front of them. This could go either way. The adjuster offering 50% is trying to make a compromise, while the one going for 100% is siding with your statement. 50% is better than you getting 0% for your damages. If you have no independent witness coming forward, you are stuck and getting a lawyer will solve nothing. Being under ""pressure"" to clear an intersection does NOT give you the right-of-way. You still have a duty to look for oncoming traffic and yield before executing a left-turn. Just because you were in the middle of an intersection does not put you in the clear. I can argue that you should not have put yourself in that position, unless you can safely execute your left turn in one motion without stopping, don't enter the middle of the intersection, stay behind the line!"

From the value of the car on the market, they are substracting salvage value. Salvage is basically the value of the car as it is right now, wrecked. You are keeping the salvage so that money is not owed to you. What is owed is the value of the car minus the salvage amount. That would be my reasonable expectation, but if you are unsure of any amount, they owe you a clear explanation.    Later edit: I must be blind, I missed the whole liability bit. So their liability decision is 60% on their own driver, 40% on you. So based on what happened they judge you contributed 40% to this accident having happened. From the payout, they substract salvage value and 40% your negligence contribution and the final amount is what is owed. Hiring a lawyer will likely not amount to much and you will end up paying in fees any potential difference. If you're interested in a liability opinion, feel free to share what happened."

In your video you can see the other driver start backing when you are, if I am counting right, at least 6 parking spots down from where they were, and at least 4 seconds of travel. There is absolutely zero indication of any evasive action prior to impact. I would attribute that to inattention given the road conditions (no sun in your eyes, no visual obstructions, etc).

Insurance,37jsd3,Jake_77,3,Thu May 28 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't think you have a choice... the insurance company isn't going to call this totaled, or give you a new car.

The easiest way to get that, though, is to go to one of the online companies and run it for only you as a worst case scenario.  Even if you give your mother the title, the insurance company will know that you're a driver (unless you are specifically excluded, which is a terrible idea) and will charge you something.  Generally speaking you can bring that down by taking as much driver education as possible and by being a good student.  Beyond that, there's not much that you can do to change pricing."

Insurance,37gktc,brakndawnt,5,Wed May 27 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"Your situation is a bit of a mess. You settled, at least partially, out of pocket with the other driver, and while you can still get your own insurance involved, you have undermined their right to subrogate for any and all damages they may pay under your policy to repair your vehicle. Be prepared for your claim to take on some potentially complex aspects. Wheel bearing does not sound related to me, unless there was actual damage to your wheel. Hitting a pothole and the resulting damage also does not appear to be related. In order to successfully present a claim to the other person for these damages, you have to prove those damages are definitely related to the sidewsipe. A sideswipe does not reasonably cause the mechanical issues you described. Just laying on the table what you have to work with, to make an informed decision. If I were the uninsured's guy insurance (I know, but just go with me), I would definitely not pay for any of the mechanical damages unless upon inspection it could be determined they were caused by the side-swipe."
Insurance,37gktc,f1shbone,5,Wed May 27 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry but a side swipe doesn't cause a bad wheel bearing, abs or tcs issues. He would have had to slam head first directly into your wheel for these to even be considered an issue from the accident. Even if he had insurance, and you tried to claim the mechanical issues with them, they would likely deny it as you can't really prove the accident caused those issues. Hitting a massive pothole is what caused those issues. For future reference, if somebody with no insurance hits you, file an uninsured motorists property damage, or a collision claim, then let your insurance company go after him for the money."
Insurance,37gktc,britt5689,1 point,Wed May 27 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"Unrelated to the sideswipe. probably an easy fix- the pothole impact either damaged or simply knocked out a wheel sensor. Happened to my car (it was actually a piece of road debris). The sensor was damaged. Total Cost to replace sensor including labor was $325, this was on a new acura."
Insurance,37gktc,tommiebooyy,1 point,Wed May 27 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"As other users have said, the wheel bearing and ABS/traction issues are probably unrelated.    If the ABS/traction control issues came up after you hit a pothole, that would most likely be (1) an independent issue, or (2) shoddy repair work.  As far as getting insurance involved goes, you're way passed that point.  Don't even bother calling it in.  Also, your speedometer being stuck at 0 is probably a bad wheel speed sensor.  Get it replaced."
Insurance,37f8pt,dianne1221,3,Wed May 27 04:51:13 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, sorry for what you're going through. That's an incredibly selfish and immature move on your parents part. Insurance isn't that complicated, so don't be scared! You'll be fine.   To answer your most basic question, in order to qualify for medicaid, you do need to be officially removed from your parents plan. You'll need to have them do that asap, if they plan on following through with their threat. The good news is, once you're on your own, you should be gravy.   You'll want to start at healthcare.gov, and enter all of the pertinent info. As a single pregnant female making a fairly low wage with an uncertain living situation, you should most certainly qualify.   So first off, find off if your parents are serious about removing you.  Once you know if they will, make them do it right away. You can apply for insurance through healthcare.gov assuming you won't have other coverage, but if your parents never end up terming your coverage, medicaid WILL find out,  and you'll be in for a bunch of claims/bills that could have been avoided.   Best of luck to you!"
Insurance,37f8pt,pomdecouer,2,Wed May 27 12:17:37 2015 UTC,"You need to contact your parent's insurance company to see if you're still actively on their plan or not. If you aren't, you can head down to your local department of job and family services and fill out a Medicaid application and they will cover you retroactively to the date you filled out the application. You will want to go to planned parenthood to get an official pregnancy test prior to filling out this application so they will immediately start covering you. They'll need proof of income, proof of address, and proof of pregnancy to get you covered."
Insurance,37f8pt,britt5689,2,Wed May 27 15:40:06 2015 UTC,"I am sorry for what you are going through.  As far as health insurance goes, it is quite possible your parents' policy would not have covered your pregnancy anyway. Much depends on the plan and the state, though. I can tell you at least in some states they definitely do not need to officially remove you for medicaid to provide maternity care for you. I have specific reasons I know which I would not feel comfortable discussing here. Go to the office and apply, or apply online. They should have a way to check if you have other coverage. Tell them your situation and see what happens. Please PM me if you'd like more specific information from me regarding what I do know.  Good luck!"

A carrier though, can sit you at a desk next to someone who you can ask questions of. If you mess up a claim, it's just one claim, and they've even got other people to transfer it to if necessary.

Having an at fault accident doesn't help much either. But the one thing that I think has been overlooked is the fact that you were licensed at 27? If that's correct not having continuous insurance, an at fault accident and your license for two years makes for a shit storm.  As for coverages I and others would agree minimum for your state is never a good idea. It often can put you in a bad situation. At fault accident with injuries can be a life ruining thing, for you and whomever is hurt."
Insurance,37dmq0,Phil_Achio,9,Wed May 27 00:44:33 2015 UTC,"This right here.  With only two years of driving experience and that accident, you might as well be 18.  The gaps in coverage will also slay you in the insurance world.  Even a one day gap can cost you double depending on the company that is rating you.  Also the state minimum thing, ugh!  The company I work for will actually put you in a higher risk category for carrying only the minimums.  If you must skimp on coverage, go one step up from minimums.  Then stick with a company for at least a year.  Also ask about filing a no need for the time you didn't own a car, but were licensed.  This can help reduce rates as well if you find a company that accepts them.  Seek out an agent.  You will likely need an independent agent who deals with a few different companies to get you competitive rates."

Insurance,37bz19,Udstrat,3,Tue May 26 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"You want to talk to your school first. If the insurance is procured by them, they will likely function as a group and you will be the member under them. I am unsure if school student insurances function different than companies but that would be the first people I go to. I strongly suspect it won't function like an Exchange plan.  It really all hinges on if you can be reinstated retroactively on to the plan. I know on typical group plans there is room for reinstatement to where there would be no lapse in coverage, but it's dependent on your policy, carrier, and how the school insurance is specifically set-up. You may be able to get the ER/Subsequent visits covered if you can get reinstated with no lapse in coverage."
Insurance,37bz19,TiedinHistory,2,Tue May 26 15:51:55 2015 UTC,"Does enrolling through my school fall under the state's marketplace/exchange?    Very likely, no. I would strongly recommend contacting your school directly about this for more clear information, but most of these policies aren't marketplace/exchange. Those are ones you specifically sign up for on the marketplace website, typically.  Even if you were to sign up for a different policy, there likely isn't a way to backdate the coverage, as you cannot submit for services that were not covered under the policy at that time. However, if BCBS gives an extension or grace period, then gravy.  But I'd contact BCBS and your school to confirm.   And how would I find out if I "" receive a premium subsidy in the form of a tax credit and/or cost-sharing reduction""?    You won't know until you sign up, is my general understanding, though I am not an individual policy specialist; my expertise runs towards commercial (group) or Medicare/Medicaid."

They MIGHT force place insurance on you, which is going to be way more expensive and cost more than you save.   Here's the kicker though. They should be listed on your insurance.

Most people can't and often times cant afford their $1000 deductible.   Like its already been said there is most likely a clause on your policy that protects the lender's interest in the vehicle. Technically they still own the vehicle till you pay them off.

He has 2 Mercedes, a BMW, and a Camry. It makes me nervous as hell, but it's what he does. Every time he buys a new car the underwriters call me ""You left off collision"" and I have to be like ""nope, dude is crazy!""

I'm not sure where the idea that 25 is some magical age started so I wouldn't be surprised if your rate doesn't change much. My rate didn't change at all.

Think of it this way- if you were the insurance company would you remove a high risk driver from the policy just because they say they don't drive? Of course you wouldn't. There are 3 ways to remove yourself- get your own auto insurance policy, move out, or surrender your license to DMV..."

They know you are a resident therefore there is a chance you will drive one of their vehicles in the underwriter's eyes.

If excluded they should not charge any premium for yourself."

The first you linked is a bit of a different situation as the named insured was excluded. The second has a similar case in Texas Zamora v. Dairyland where the exclusion of a spouse was upheld on appeal and found not to be contrary to state law but supplemental. Even stating the exclusion keeps high risk drivers off the road (not so empathetic to the plaintiff. Yikes.) As with everything else in US insurance law location, location, location I guess."
Insurance,37cdf4,eastindywalrus,5,Wed May 27 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"OP, this might help you understand this issue. The policy they carry automatically extends coverage to you, as a resident relative. You are part of the definition of an ""insured"", which is you(meaning the person paying for the coverage), spouse, and any and all resident relatives related by blood, marriage or adoption. You are considered to have implied consent to operate the vehicle, even without a license. The only way to help your parents out is to move out and be on your own, or add you as an excluded driver on the policy, in which situation you most definitely do not want to ever get behind the wheel. There is nothing special or evil about State Farm here, it is the reality of insurance."

This is completely legitimate. The only othe rway I know of is to ask their SF agent to re-write the policy with you as an excluded driver. You'll probably also have to turn in your driver's license to prove you don't drive."

Because if you mom was having a heart attack and needed to go to the hospital I guarantee you will get behind the wheel and drive her there. The only way to get out of this is by surrendering your license.
Insurance,37cdf4,951jimbo,2,Wed May 27 14:42:08 2015 UTC,"Every other company will do the exact same thing. You are a liability, and the reason the rest of us can't have nice things. The fact that you don't have a vehicle and ""aren't driving"" truly does not matter. There is nothing physically stopping you from borrowing your parents' vehicles and smashing them. Your driving record proves that this is all too likely, and that's why State Farm (and any other company) will still rate for their exposure (you) under your parents' policy."

Now, I have no idea if the employer has the OPTION of restricting FSA enrollment that way, it may be the case."
Insurance,37c0t5,sab1432,3,Tue May 26 14:51:35 2015 UTC,"I have a couple designations.  The AAI is for agents.  If you want to go that route then go for it.  If you want to stay in claims I recommend going for the AIC.  If you want to go for underwriting go for the AU.  I find the ARM the most useful since you can relate that information to your personal finances.  The CPCU is really boring.  It looks good on the resume but, in my opinion, that's about it.  It's a very general study at all aspects of insurance but doesn't really go in depth much on any one topic.  If you're close to moving into a management position I'd recommend it.  If you're still low on the totem pole I'd recommend something else.  A lot of people start with the AINS, then a specialized designation (AIC, AU, ARM), then the CPCU.  Maybe throw in AIS if you really want those extra letters.  I personally think that's the best way to go about it."
Insurance,37c0t5,LASuperdome,2,Wed May 27 16:55:10 2015 UTC,"I forgot about ARM, that's a good one.  ARM gets your resume some extra attention whether you want to be in claims, UW, an adjuster, management.  I'd still choose CPCU over ARM for myself, but these are all great suggestions OP.  Honestly if you pass more than 2 tests, you'll probably already be miles ahead of many of your colleagues."

Insurance,37c0t5,forneusFQ,1 point,Wed May 27 13:36:17 2015 UTC,I work in a large insurance company. It's in the top 150 in the Forbes Global 500 list. Idk if that makes a difference. I currently work in claims as a claims assistant. I am probably one of the only people in my specific team with a bachelors degree. I am hoping to stay in this company just move on from my position. Hopefully underwriting but I have not set anything in stone yet.
Insurance,37c0t5,forneusFQ,2,Wed May 27 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"I wondered if you would say underwriting.  First off, any designation is helpful in beefing up your resume and setting you apart.  Even being able to say ""I'm working on X designation"" in an interview is helpful.  Many people who go on to underwriting eventually decide to get the CPCU designation.  I went the route you're thinking about.  I just wanted some letters after my name ASAP so I got my AINS designation, then went on to the CPCU, which I should have in 2 months.    I regret doing that now and you might too.  In underwriting, CPCU really does command more respect than any other designation you can get from the Institutes.  It's a series of 9 courses.  Well, the AAI is 4 courses and it only waives one CPCU course.  I think you should consider just jumping in to CPCU, do the 9 courses and get that one designation - instead of doing 12 courses to get the 2 designations.  If your state requires claims reps to be licensed with CE requirements, that also looks great.  If not, rather than the AAI you might consider getting your agents license.  It's a single test and a background check.  I know, you're not planning to sell insurance.  But it comes with CE requirements that seem like a pain, but they get you out of the office and if you can spin it right in an interview, placing CE requirements on yourself when you don't really have to shows a real commitment to the industry and to staying up to date."

I was planning on eventually getting my CPCU, also similar to you. I really just want to get my feet off the ground and gain some career traction which is why I am looking at a designation I can get quicker. My company pays for whatever courses as well. How long did the AINS and CPCU take you?"

Dropbox will give you 1TB storage for $10/month.  Others are similar.  While insurance may give you some money for the hardware, the data is a different story."
Insurance,37afvg,mbruns2,4,Tue May 26 04:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yes power surges are covered but you do need to check if your policy also has a ""special limit"" for computer equipment.  Certain items on your renters/homeowners policy may have an upper limit to the coverage of anywhere from $500 to $2500 or so. This includes things like boats, guns, jewelry, gravestones, cash, and computer equipment & software. I have a USAA policy with a special limit on computer equipment but I pay an extra $16 to have that limit raised to $5k. I believe it also extends the coverage to dropping the computer or spilling stuff on it, which normally isn't covered."

Insurance,37afvg,FunandFailure,2,Tue May 26 13:00:25 2015 UTC,Renters would cover power surges.   That said I'd recommend purchasing a surge protector if you're concerned about it.  You should be using a surge protector with all your expensive electronics.  They only cost like $20 and it wouldn't effect your insurance premiums if a surge ever did happen.
Insurance,37afvg,LASuperdome,2,Tue May 26 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"While surge protectors are a good thing to have, they only protect you if there is too much electricity in the lines. They do nothing for too little electricity.   Look into a UPS, uninterrupted power supply. You can find them for $100-1000+. Many work as a surge protector.  When your power goes out, your computer is shorted power unexpectedly, and its not good for it. It operates with low voltage for a bit. A UPS fixes this and if power goes out, it keeps your PC on for a few minutes. Software will trigger what to do in those few minutes, like saving data, closing programs, etc."
Insurance,37afvg,UltraApplesauce,1 point,Tue May 26 06:05:00 2015 UTC,"Broad advice here: generally, your best bet is to go right to the policy. It should describe exactly what is covered. (And will probably specifically indicate things that aren't covered.) An insurance policy is a contract - if you purchase this coverage and these things happen, the insurance carrier will do this.  Get comfortable reading your policy - it will be very useful to you. You can always come back here as well but you're more likely to get an accurate answer if you can say, ""My policy says 'x...' will I be covered if this happens?"""

Insurance,379y90,insurancequst,1 point,Tue May 26 01:51:29 2015 UTC,"I am agent here in Texas so I can give my take on your claims. I will warn that policies differ from one company to another. Auto - Typically not at fault accidents have a minimal impact on your rates. Some companies have no penalty at all. Honestly if the other party is admitting fault and handling the claim then there is a not a major reason to get your insurance involved. I would only get your company involved if you feel the other parties insurance is not going to cover it. Home - More than likely your homeowners deductible is at least 1% of the home's insured value. I would first call out a roof to fix the shingle and prevent any further. Possibly get an estimate to see how much it would cost to get the water damage fixed. That stuff can add up pretty fast. 1 claim is going to get you dropped by any major insurance company. Usually you have to have at least 2 or 3 claims in a 5 year period to be considered being dropped by a carrier. Again, this is my experience as an agent. I am not a claims adjustor or underwriter."

If you are down there, at least you're not one of the people being airlifted off their roofs.  I followed you over to /r/personalfinance and the top answer over there is actually very good, I don't disagree with it at all.  To answer your additional questions:  Your car: Yes, call their insurance, not yours.  You'll get your car fixed with nothing out of pocket from you.  Your house:  Not to come on too strong or anything, but I think you're the most amazing person in the world.  Not only did you actually read and quote your policy, you also correctly interpreted it.  Based on your description, I can't imagine this not being a covered cause of loss.  However, I strongly recommend that you file a claim and have an adjuster come out and have professional repairs, not try to fix it yourself.  If there is some seepage or a leak somewhere that you miss, your policy will exclude that damage and any resultant mold if you allow the condition to continue for longer than 2 weeks.  In the meantime, do whatever you reasonably and safely can to prevent further damage."

Insurance,378yuh,Zen_Drifter,8,Mon May 25 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's common to just have the other carrier pay for it if they have accepted liability for the accident. You're just skipping the step where your carrier has to pursue them to get their money & your deductible back.   There are really only a few possible down sides. The main one that comes to mind is if you have damage to wear and tear parts on your car like tires/batteries/shocks/exhaust. In those cases it's possible that the other person's carrier takes what's called ""betterment"" (depreciation) on those items where your carrier might not. For example if your tire was half worn-out they may only be legally obligated to pay you 50% of the replacement cost of the tire. Your company's policy may be to not take depreciation on such items.  Of course this situation could just as well be flipped where their company does not depreciate such items and yours does, so it may work to your benefit.   Another example would be a statutory difference in how your claim is handled. For example in Indiana your own insurer is obligated to utilize new OEM parts in the repair of your vehicle if it is less than six years old. There's no such rule that applies to third parties like when you go through the other guy's carrier.   As a general rule most carriers do not treat claimants any differently from their own insureds in most jurisdictions. You'll often get the same treatment that their own customers get."

Insurance,378yuh,dewprisms,2,Tue May 26 05:52:35 2015 UTC,Yes. Why would you use your own insurance if someone else is at fault?  Your own insurance will cover rental cars if you pay for that coverage. It sounds like you may not have that on your policy and may want to consider getting it added if you feel that it's something you want in the event of your car being in the shop.
Insurance,378yuh,MrFoolsDay,1 point,Tue May 26 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"Haha I've never had to deal with this and always assumed people just went through their own insurance to let them handle everything.

I work in Auto Insurance claims, and in situations like this we usually notify underwriting that this is a not an ""At fault"" accident on you.  Your insurance company will attempt to recover your deductible through the companies insurance. The more things your insurance company has to fully recover and show you not ""At fault"" the better. You (most likely) also have the ability to file through there insurance company (if they have one) and have them handle the claim instead. Rest assured you will not go to prison for Insurance Fraud by just getting an estimate either by the way. You are also safe here. In my experience, MOST people think any estimate is too high in smaller damages. They don't realize it really matters most how many different panels are affected in the vehicle."

Because if he is on the title, he has ""insurable interest"" in the vehicle and should be able to cover the vehicle on his policy. I'd recommend your parents speaking with their agent using that information to see where it gets you.  On the flip side, the company may want you separated if you are no longer a dependent-- but if you are both titled on the auto, they may find it better to allow you to keep coverage as it is."

Insurance,371ax0,acekitten17,4,Sat May 23 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, if you don't notify the companies to each other's existence, it generally won't be noted unless something on a claim tips off an insurance company. Even then, they won't go around calling insurance companies, they'll deny a claim requesting a COB Questionnaire (Coordination of Benefits) or further info.  With that said, if you have two insurances, it's usually beneficial to use both of them. A claim will processed under your primary, and then you can send the EOB and that claim to your secondary and they process it under those benefits. I'm not quite sure why you are worried about the insurance companies finding it."
Insurance,371ax0,TiedinHistory,1 point,Sun May 24 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response! What do you mean something on a claim tips off an insurance company?  I'm not eligible for the health insurance i've been using if I'm on any other insurance. If they find out about the other insurance, they could retroactively deny claims they've paid for for the last few months. I thought I'd waived the second health insurance, but something must've gotten mixed up. So now, I'm just hoping they don't find out about this second insurance before I end it. Since I've never used it (not having known it existed, and not wanting it in the first place), is there a way for the insurance I have submitted claims through to find out? Thank you for your assistance!"
Insurance,371ax0,TiedinHistory,2,Sun May 24 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"Oftentimes, there will be common medical codes on a claim that will tip off an insurance company to a situation that may encourage further research. Between two health insurance companies isn't something I've really seen without an existing COB on file, but it's common when there is a car accident and a subsequent ER/Ambulance trip: diagnosis and procedural codes will flash ""car accident"" to the insurer and they will prompt a review into a potential coordination of benefits with a car insurance company or further investigation into if someone else could be responsible.  The explanation makes sense, was just curious on why you may not want a COB. Honestly? Most of the COB I've seen is prompted by the insured, a representative of theirs, or an internal audit due to the prompts listed above. I figure as long as you don't submit anything to the second insurance and generally keep it under wraps, it's not too likely you'll be found out unless something else trips their notice."

Insurance,370oek,Riftwerks,8,Sat May 23 19:42:23 2015 UTC,"Copy and pasted to read easier:   I was at a complete stop at a light in my town behind a car that had been driving erratically (albeit slowly) in front of me for the last quarter mile. At the light I was already cautious of her driving so i gave her a wide birth (1 to 1.5) car lengths. Her car started rolling backwards at me, I honked my horn emphatically as she got within 5 or so feet of my car with no sign of slowing down. She hit the front of my car with the back of hers, then proceeded to continue left through the intersection. I followed honking the horn and gesturing for her to pull over with my arm out the window. It became quickly apparent she was not going to stop so I called 911 and had them connect me to local dispatch. They intercepted her about 4 miles from the scene of the accident, with me still behind. She denied everything but her state of mind was so questionable the cops on the scene filed an 'immediate threat' and took her license on the spot. I want to get the car checked out to make sure there is no structural damage, and an appraiser from her insurance company is coming to check out the car this week. My concern, however, is that the car is a 98 suzuki esteem (worth about 1500 dollars on kbb) and if their is any major damage to my car, they will probably call it a total loss. However, 1500 bucks would not give me enough money to buy a new serviceable vehicle. Do insurance companies allow you to buy a totalled car back off of them or would I just have to eat the damages this crazy lady caused.   Yes, you can buy back the car; whether or not that is the correct course of action is debatable."

Insurance,370glo,eddie2911,2,Sat May 23 23:49:06 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this.  First, GEICO doesn't run MVRs until you've already agreed to purchase.  Second, anyone who ""forgets"" to add UM is not someone I'd buy insurance from.  Even in states where it's not per se required, it's incredibly inexpensive and well worth it.  You have a claim history.  You're likely to be involved in another accident, statistically.  That also means you're likely to be involved in another accident with an uninsured motorist.  If that happens, and you don't have UM, your damages and injuries are on your own dime.  Knowing what healthcare costs, and knowing what car repairs cost, that should terrify you.  For the fifty bucks a year, demand the coverage and pay for it.  What state?"

They'll be able to advise you on the difference between legal and prudent coverage.  Do not call up GEICO and talk to some kid in a call center in Omaha hoping they know what they're talking about.  Florida warrants a local agent you can personally vet and who earns your trust."

Insurance,370glo,alphatangolima,1 point,Sun May 24 02:58:00 2015 UTC,"That's a drastic reduction.  Compare the dec page and the quote line by line.  It's quite likely that you're missing something in the new quote, considering you're talking almost a grand a year.  If you can save $200 a year, take it without a whole lot of questions.  That's fifteen bucks a month, give or take.  If you're saving more than that, you need to take pains to compare the coverage very carefully.  Full disclosure, I work primarily with HO in FL, but the ""if you're saving more than $200 a year look carefully"" rule is universal.    If you were buying chicken breasts for your family and someone offered them at 29 cents a pound, would you ask questions?  The same logic applies to insurance.    Salmonella and bad insurance both are a hell of a thing to live through.  Don't cut costs on insurance or chicken.  I pay out the tail for good coverage on auto and home, but I sleep better at night as a result.  If someone hits me in a parking lot and tries to claim it's my fault, defense is not my damn problem.  That's worth the cost of the insurance on its own."

Insurance,370vr8,thatshowifeel2345776,2,Sat May 23 20:43:41 2015 UTC,"If all you care about after an accident where say, you lose your legs, is the medical bills, then no, you don't need UM.   So with health insurance, when you lose your legs in a car accident you get your medical bills paid for. Now you have no legs but without UM nobody is going to compensate you for that unless you have an AD&D (Accidental death and dismemberment) policy or you're eligible for workers compensation, which gives you a fixed amount per limb.  UM/UIM is basically your insurer standing in the shoes of the other person's non-existent or poor insurer.   With UM/UIM you get your medical bills paid for plus compensation for pain & suffering, lost of future earnings potential, the $3000 set of hand-controls you need for your car now, etc...  With regards to the UMPD coverage some states don't actually allow you to purchase both because collision and UMPD are basically duplicate coverage. Collision covers everything that UMPD covers. UMPD covers collision damages, but only if the accident is not your fault and the other driver is uninsured. UMPD may also have a fixed upper limit for coverage that is the same as the state PD (property damage) minimum where you reside. For example the minimum PD coverage in Ohio is $7,500, so the most the UMPD policy my carrier sells will cover is $7,500. You'd have to ask your carrier whether you can buy UMPD coverage that is higher than the state minimum."
Insurance,370vr8,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Sun May 24 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"So essentially, even with health insurance through a job, it would be a really good Idea to have UI/UM medical? Also, it sounds like you're saying I don't really need UI/UM Property Coverage if I already have collision, is that right? And a side-note, I havn't caused a wreck in 10 years, but have had 2 people hit me (both were insured). I'm a pretty safe driver.  Sorry If I'm sounding stupid, just trying to make sure I understand you."
Insurance,370vr8,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Sun May 24 20:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, because insurance is to ""make you whole"" again, or at least to the extent that money can do so. Health insurance is just there to protect you from catastrophic medical bills. Health insurance isn't concerned with any effect whatever injury you have affects your life. It's only concern is with paying the bills that relate to medical care.  So to an extent these two insurance types overlap, but they're not completely identical.   If you have a severe injury from a car accident, but from which you have no lingering aftereffects, and you were not interested in suing anybody over it, and you have both coverages, then there is almost complete overlap. The auto UM would usually cover the medical bills back to the first dollar (so you'd probably have no health insurance deductible to worry about) so you'd only be out for physical damages to your car & clothes & personal property destroyed in the accident, plus maybe some lost wages.    The opposite case where there would not be a lot of overlap between potential medical and UM coverage would be an accident with a low medical bill but severe consequences. For example your face is splashed with battery acid in an accident and you're made totally blind. Your health insurance pays a couple grand for the medical bill and you're blind for life with nobody to pursue for compensation for how this has affected you except the other driver who has no assets.   Now being made blind from flying battery acid is kinda far fetched but it's used to illustrate the point. A more realistic example might be that you get t-boned and sustain a traumatic brain injury that leaves you with chronic headaches and chronic short term memory loss. You can't work anymore so your employer no longer needs you. Now you are destitute and reliant upon charity or government assistance. With UM/UIM coverage your insurer would stand in the shoes of the the other party's absent insurer and compensate you with money for how this will affect the rest of your life.   I'm in claims, not sales, so I see a lot of the end consequences of these coverages. I've always framed the question as: If you're an able bodied person how much money would you want in compensation if tomorrow you were made a paraplegic for life?  So here's the side-by-side scenario :   Fred is his way home from work one day an oncoming driver turns in front of him and the cars collide. Fred has a cervical strain, first degree burns from the airbag gasses, a 4"" facial laceration from his right eye to his right ear, a crushed lower left leg, and a liver laceration. Fred's health insurer pays for the medical bills. He uses his short-term and long-term disability coverage at work to receive partial compensation for lost income. Fred pays his $3,500 deductible from his high-deductible health plan and later hits his out-of-pocket $10,000 maximum. Three months later Fred returns to work with a limp, a large facial scar, and $10,000 missing from his bank account. The other driver has no insurance.  WITHOUT UM: Freddy has no outstanding health insurance bills but also no compensation for his changed appearance and lingering health effects. WITH UM: Freddy files a UM claim with his insurer. They reach a settlement that compensates Fred for his $10,000 out-of-pocket medical expenses, pays him (making up numbers here) $40,000 for the facial scarring, $150,000 for the 50% permanency rating for the leg injury, $50,000 for the pain/suffering/trauma for the liver laceration, plus all the medical bills (which are usually owed out of the settlement amount back to his health insurer). So Fred nets $250,000 or so, minus his attorney's fees.    With regards to the UM Property coverage yes collision covers everything that UMPD does.    Collision just costs more because it also covers accidents that are your fault.  Collision also covers accidents where the other guy has insurance but his carrier does not agree that it is his fault. Your insurer says ""well, he has insurance so UMPD does not apply here. Good luck dealing with his insurer"".  Collision also helps in a situation where you have an accident where you're partly liable but the other guy is mostly liable. His carrier may call you and say ""we'll pay you 70% of your damages and 70% of your rental car bill because we feel our insured is 70% at fault."" You can turn that sort of thing into your collision insurance and your insurer pays 100% of your damages (less your deductible) and fighting over the money and percentages of liability is your insurer's problem, not yours.   EDITS: grammar for clarity"

Insurance,370vr8,951jimbo,1 point,Sun May 24 21:14:25 2015 UTC,You definitely want the UM coverages on your policy as they will pay for your pain and discomfort as a result of the injury sustained. They're not that expensive coverages to have. Also please keep in mind that health insurance may not cover accident related medical costs completely (as I have seen) so I recommend having PIP/Medpay on your policy with a decently high limit.

The other way to do it is to have the car co titled under your mom and you.  Than the car can be added under your mom's policy with you as a driver.

Insurance,36vl8h,dc567,16,Fri May 22 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you are still at fault, regardless of how slow you were pulling out. Unless you have an independent witness that can testify he was driving recklessly, in that case you might be able to get away with only being 50% at fault.  Either way, you are responsible for his damages."
Insurance,36vl8h,Cicatrized,6,Fri May 22 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"This is correct. OP, law puts the driver backing at the greater duty of look-out. I understand your situation, many of us were in your very shoes, this is a reality that happens too often. Unfortunately everything you said has to somehow be proven in order to assign negligence to the other driver and even if that happens, the likelyhood of you still not being majority at fault (more than 50%) is not a likely possibility. At the end of the day, the only thing that can be proven factually is that one car was driving down the aisle, one car was backing up, and the two collided. Per the rules of the road, backing car has the duty of look-out and to yield. Where are the damages to the other car? If they are anywhere on the side of the vehicle, especially towards the rear of that car, it establishes that at some point they were right behind you as you were backing and you should have definitely seen them, but you backed into them anyway. If they scraped the side of your vehicle with one of their front corners, that may make a difference. Speeding can't really be used as a defense, it is subjective (how do you define it), has to be proven, and the only thing that establishes is that you pulled in front of a speeding car."
Insurance,36vl8h,f1shbone,5,Fri May 22 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"The backing party has the greater duty to yield the right of way. I would put you 100% AF for the accident.   It isn't a he said/she said situation. The damage tells the story. You were backing, he was going down the aisle, and you hit him. It's pretty simple, really.   How do you know he was speeding? You said you didn't see him.   What I would do? Let him file the claim with your insurance and let them handle it. That's why you pay them."

My trunk was already out.. he should have stopped when he saw I was pulling out. Instead he wanted to be an ass and try to either go around me or try to speed up to not have to wait for me. I ended up telling him that I will not pay for the damage as I do not feel I was 100% at fault. I also told him that I understood he was in a rush but we should have called the cops and have them determine this. Long story short he told me he was getting a lawyer. I have not heard anything yet but I am pretty sure he did not call insurance since they have yet to contact me.

In other words, you look behind and if you see no cars, back out FAST so that you can then argue that you were already in the aisle. This, of course, all things being equal. There are elements to your accident that may have dictated for that liability to be correct. Each claim is handled on its own merits. You are being downvoted because you made a blanket statement."

Insurance,36vno6,precator,6,Fri May 22 14:11:13 2015 UTC,Can you provide some clarification?  As I'm understanding it your sump pump failed. And now a year later you have mold?  Was there a second water claim that involved the carpet and pads? or was that damage part of the original sump pump failure?  I'm not understanding the chain of events.
Insurance,36vno6,Cicatrized,3,Fri May 22 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"Sump pump failed around 5/14. we had about an inch of water all over the basement. I got a new sump pump, emptied out the water, removed all carpets, cleaned up baseboards a bit. All seemed good then. Fast forward almost a year later we have a little mold in a few areas we found this during an energy audit. I put in one claim for the mold."
Insurance,36vno6,Cicatrized,8,Fri May 22 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"Ok, this makes more sense now.  You will not be able to appeal the mold claim. This is not something your insurer will cover. Your policy will have a wording that sates they cover ""sudden and accidental events"". Since you did not take necessary measures to prevent mold damage when the sump pump failed your insurance company is off the hook for the resulting mold damage.  Normally when there is water damage you cannot just ""clean up"" the baseboards, you have to tear them out and replace them to prevent mold from forming."

That's what keeps you from getting sued if you're at fault for an accident.   After that it depends on what's important to you. If you can easily replace your vehicle if it's in an accident you don't really need comp. or collision. I can't replace my car, nor can I afford a grand out of pocket for a deductible, so I have comp/coll with a 500 ded.   Raising or lowering your comp. deductible won't change your policy that much.

I require signatures of husband and wife to lower or reject coverage.  Your wages can be garnished, so even if you dont have much today, they can hit you up for that.

They will only give you that snapshot but will not be of any help when dealing with the higher end of the spectrum.  Everyone here is going to tell you that you have too little coverage now, because that's true.  The statutory minimums are what your state has said is the absolute bare minimum.  They're comparatively high when looking at other states (PA), but they're still not all that high.  I'm not an auto person, or even a personal lines person, nor do I know what your circumstances are, but unless you're earning in the bottom 25% of local wages, then you need to raise your limits.  If you own a home, have children or own a business, you need substantially higher limits.  And the idea of ""too much coverage"" is really only appropriate if you never have a claim.  I think it's safe to presume that you're human, so it is possible for you to make a mistake that could kill or cripple someone.  That's when the ""too much coverage"" concept is proven to be something that only morons subscribe to."

Insurance,36xig4,treecrashcrash,4,Fri May 22 22:56:51 2015 UTC,"I don't see where you have any liability.  For you to be liable for your tree falling on somebody else's property there has to be negligence on your part arising from an act or omission on your part that caused or allowed the tree to fall where it did. (Unless there's a strict liability statute that automatically makes you liable, but this would be unusual.)   So since the tree was dying the question is whether you knew it was dying before it fell (or whether you should have known), how bad of a condition it was in, and whether it presented a hazard. Since it was private property and you had no reasonable expectation that anybody would be parking/walking/camping in that spot IMHO there's no real apparent hazard that rises to the level of a omission on your part that creates any liability.   but I'm itching with curiosity (and a little worry) about whose responsibility this will come down to, and if it's mine, whether insurance will cover it.   There's nothing to really worry about. If your insurer decides you're liable then they pay the claimant. If your insurer decides you're not liable then they will deny the claimant's claim. If your insurer denies the claim and you get sued and a court finds you liable then your insurer pays the claim.   In the vast majority of cases I've handled there would be no liability in this situation even if the tree was completely dead or the other party had explicit permission to park where they did. The legal hurdles the claimant has to overcome in cases like this tend to be quite high."

If your regulations are the same as ours I would say you owe nothing to the owner of the car.  When you talk to your insurer makes sure you let them know the guy was trespassing.    Edit: adding to my comment, if you have a regulation in your state similar to the occupiers liability act in Ontario, if your land is vacant (you said it was a driveway to farmland) then you are immediately off the hook for any damage caused by the tree.

Insurance,36rwwv,Tabathock,2,Thu May 21 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"As a general rule of thumb, more fear = high premiums.  In this particular example it depends on what timescale and what kind of region you are insuring. Motor isn't especially CAT exposed, but if you are in the US, I suspect natural catastrophe and interest rates are more important than a new technology. In Europe - where there isn't much natural catastrophe (other than the odd hail storm) there would be a much more drastic reduction in premium."
Insurance,36rwwv,GreatDeku,11,Thu May 21 21:05:00 2015 UTC,"Are we talking revenue or profit?  In the short term: Revenue would stay the same and profit would increase.  As less claims are paid out, insurers will want to decrease their prices in order to stay competitive; however, the rate approval process would be slow since State Insurance Departments would only incrementally accept rate decreases.  Also, some insurers are more risk averse and would prefer slowly losing business than risk being under-reserved.  In the long term:  Revenue would decrease, and profit would return to normal.  Premium is revenue for an insurer, and since their customers represent a smaller risk, the premium per policyholder would decrease.  Assuming that their books are sounds, insurers would resume making a modest profit comparable to the time before the new technology (at least by percentage)."
Insurance,36rwwv,GreatDeku,2,Thu May 21 17:24:18 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify in case you weren't aware, revenue is different from profit.    Revenue is essentially the total amount of money brought into a business from sales or services.  For an insurance company, that includes premium received for writing policies and other work, such as selling risk control services.  Profit is the money left over after expenses (revenue - minus expenses, interest, and taxes).  In other words, it can be oversimplied as policyholder premium - claims paid.  Of course, that is ignoring employee salaries, overhead, taxes, and other big items."

Then there would be reduced revenue and profit because the market has shrunk.  Self-driving cars will be very bad for insurance companies. They already know this.
Insurance,36rwwv,BuckEm,3,Thu May 21 17:53:20 2015 UTC,"Self driving cars are definitely a hot topic in the insurance world.  I do however see at least one downside.    Many personal lines insurers ""subsidize"" their homeowners lines of business with a more profitable auto insurance book.  If auto insurance becomes less profitable, I feel like many companies would be forced to increase their homeowners rates to an actuarially sound level."

Let's say you own a self-driving car, obviously the software/car manufacturer would be responsible for any accidents and we can even go on the assumption that accident rate will be 0%.  You will still need insurance. What if a tree falls on your car? Vandalism? Theft? Collision with animal? All of these things will still need to be covered.  Granted insurance companies will charge much less because they don't cover collisions, but their payout will be much lower too."

A deductible would apply to that and it's nice of you to be willing to pay that back to her. (3) Rates increase and decrease for many reasons, so if their renewal premium is higher than their current, it probably won't be due to this minor accident...although it could be...who knows...I'd be careful about promising to pay for rate increases that might have nothing to do with you (4) You can't blame her dad for being thorough I guess, but if your girlfriend did indeed have coverage in place and the damage to the other car was as minor as you say, then your insurance has nothing to do with this, I mean absolutely nothing  A post about an accident and all parties involved exchanged information, looped in all relevant insurance carriers, and cooperated like mature, responsible human beings?  I can't fucking believe it..."

I wouldn't worry too much about what you should or shouldn't disclose to the insurance company - just tell the truth
Insurance,36s5rj,AndyBatcountry,1 point,Thu May 21 21:14:23 2015 UTC,"Girlfriend and her family have good insurance, so I'm sure whatever liability coverage they do have will be enough to cover the minuscule damage that was done to her car.  No damage whatsoever to girlfriend's car, so she will not be filing a claim.    Her family has been super cool about it and has told me not to worry.  I texted a bit with her dad today and he basically just wanted me to get in touch with their insurance agent just to give a statement and my contact info.  Here is where the frustrating part comes in:  her dad says the insurance told him the other lady is claiming injury, which is laughable.  There is absolutely no way this lady was injured whatsoever, she got out immediately, practically danced around her car, didn't call police, ambulance, no witnesses, nothing.  GF's dad and insurance company both recognize there is no way this lady is injured and is most likely just trying to milk the insurance company, and her dad assured me they have departments that make this a non-issue, so I'm not really sweating the injury part.  I'm not trying to hide any information from any insurance company, but would like to avoid notifying my company if I don't have to.  Dealing with two insurance companies is already a hassle.  Hell, I wanted to just write this lady a check when she got her repair quoted but she INSISTED on going through insurance.  I think it's all going to end up working out -- her dad told me the insurance companies agree the damage is incredibly small and have all but dismissed her injury BS."
Insurance,36s5rj,forneusFQ,3,Thu May 21 22:22:47 2015 UTC,"This is a valuable lesson.  It's a super common question on this sub and elsewhere, why do I need to call my insurer when I barely tapped the other car?  The injury BS is exactly the reason why.  Insurers have skyscrapers packed full of attorneys that specialize in shutting that kind of BS down.  So you get to let them do that for you and move on with your life instead of trying to fend off a spurious lawsuit on your own.  What's unfair is she probably will get some extra money for claiming an injury.  It's cheaper to write a check than fight it in court."

I know that insurance minimizes the risk to me and makes it so the lady can't profit from lying about injuries, which obviously is invaluable, but it never occurred to me there would be this many people involved for knocking a piece of plastic loose on some lady's bumper."
Insurance,36s5rj,Zen_Drifter,3,Fri May 22 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"Insurance usually follows the car, but not always.  Your own liability insurance likely does not cover property damaged while in your care/custody/control, so your liability insurance pays nothing for your girlfriend's car.  Your girlfriend's policy likely affords you coverage for damage to the car that you hit as a permissive user of the vehicle, though there are circumstances where your coverage under her insurance could be voided if she has a policy that excludes other drivers. You may also be excluded from coverage if her policy has an exclusion for other drivers with their own coverage (which is a thing in at least one state). But all this depends on what her policy actually says. Most likely it just falls under her coverage. Her policy will have an at-fault liability claim on it if one was filed on the vehicle you were driving.   What obligations you have towards discussing things with her insurer are probably something that's different on a state-to-state basis. You're not a named insured but presumably there are circumstances where their insurer could void your coverage under your girlfriend's policy for failing to cooperate in the resolution of the claim when you're seeking protection under the same coverage umbrella. One possible outcome of this would be that your girlfriend's insurer may not be obligated to provide you with a defense if you were named along with your girlfriend and/or her parents in a lawsuit brought by the other driver.   Under normal personal auto coverage, unless they are filing a collision claim there will be no deductible to pay. Deductibles generally do not apply to liability claims under personal auto policies. They only apply to claims for physical damage to your own car, (or in your case the car you were driving)."

Life insurance in CA has a two-year period after purchase during which the company can still terminate the contract with cause, or adjust rates based on things discovered about you. If you die during the first two years, they can and will investigate your death and see if there was anything underwriting missed or you didn't disclose which would have changed your rate or should have disqualified you. After two years, you're in the clear. I'm under the impression most other states work this way as well. However, as long as your answers to the underwriting questions are correct you should be fine.  You're young, presuming you're also healthy it should be no problem to make it past the two years, and -fates forbid- you don't make it, as long as you were not seeing any doctor concerning any questions on the health section of the application, omitting them should be immaterial. Ask your agent for guidance.  Just wondering - why not get universal life instead of term?"

The agent doing the quote for you will dispute it and upload the proof for the underwriters to review. This maybe common in several cases - The clue report pulls up ""possibly related claims"" on your report so someone with the same exact name may pop up or if you live in an apt complex several other tenants may pop up for address match or even a previous driver for the vehicle you are considering for purchase if it was used. I don't see this as a huge deal as long as you have maybe a bill for the years stating you were in a completely different country and the claims will be disputed."

In this day and age, Travel insurers are increasing looking for ways to avoid insurance claim pay outs  ...But truth be told, in this world where insurers use general and broad terms which can go either way. It’s hard for policy buyers to know if insurers would actually pay their promised pay out till shit actually hits the fan.   The article doesn't give too much information on what actually happened. But it does say that the deceased was on medication prior to purchasing the policy. I would agree it was considered a pre-existing condition. If the condition was not disclosed at the time of purchase (and the article does not mention if it was or wasn't) then it should be cause for the claim to be denied.  This just highlights that it is important to read and understand your policy."

Do you know what your liability limits for both of these policies are?"
Insurance,36ookb,IntricatelySimple,4,Wed May 20 23:25:53 2015 UTC,"I second that you need renters and your liability should be at least 100/300. Lower UM is fine IMO, but not lower liability.

So if your liability limits are 100/300 that's what your UM limits should be as well.  It pisses me off to no end when I see a Geico policy that has cut the UM coverage.  Basically your saying that the people in your car are worth less than the people you hit.  As for the renters insurance, get it.  If your packaging it with your auto, it should cost pennies a month.  (You may even pay less.  It's not unheard of.)"
Insurance,36ookb,NYAgent112,2,Thu May 21 18:29:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice everybody. Here's what I'm taking away from it: My UM and liability limits should match, I should get Renter's Insurance, I want as low of a comprehensive deductible as possible, I should go for ""full tort"", I should shop around at Met Life, American National, and Farmer's, as well as others, GEICO is a non-starter because if anything actually hits the fan, I'm SOL, and I should include rental car and towing.  My question is whether I should bump up liability to a 250/500 due to the whole ""Wrongful Death"" issue. I'm also hearing that 100/300 is fine. Once I factor this other stuff into my quote I guess I'll have to make the financial decision. Any arguments to sway me up or down on the liability limit?  Also, is a $1000 collision deductible reasonable? Should I bump it up or down?"
Insurance,36ookb,forneusFQ,2,Thu May 21 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken the full vs. limited tort is only an option in PA, so if you're in any other state, just disregard that.  Your state might offer PIP or Medpay or some other thing that falls under the general category of no fault insurance.  If you tell us your state we can weigh in on that.  Higher liability limits are always better than lower, but I really think 100 grand per person will cover you.  Another option that falls in between 100/300 and 250/500 is 300 combined single limit - that is, $300,000 per accident without the $100,000 per person sublimit.  On both comp and collision, the higher your deductible, the lower your rate.  Personally I carry a $1,000 deductible on both comp and collision, because whether I get rear ended or a tree falls on my car, $1,000 won't destroy me financially.  The proper deductible is the amount of risk you can comfortably retain and no one can answer that but you.  And man if you get a quote from Geico that you like, go with Geico.  People that work in insurance all day develop strong opinions on companies.  Ask me about Progressive and I'll hit you with a similar level of hatred and vitriol that even I know is irrational and unfounded.  Maybe Geico isn't as efficient as others in handling claims, but to read this post you'd think their typical response to an auto claim is to burn your house down and frame you for arson."
Insurance,36ookb,tang81,3,Fri May 22 13:37:16 2015 UTC,"From my experience you have quotes here from the cheapest and most expensive company.   First, stay away from Geico. If you ever have a claim for anything other than property damage you will regret it.   State Farm is a descent company when it comes to claims. But, I would look at companies like Met Life, American National, Farmers, etc. Shop around.   I work personal injury claims with a lawyer. We recommend 250/500 limits and full tort. But I know not everyone can afford it. If you get into an accident you want to anticipate worst case scenario. The other driver might only have $15k limits or no insurance.  At $100k, you could be over your limit before you even get to the hospital."

Insurance,36ookb,tang81,2,Thu May 21 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"Agents will always push you to limited tort. Lawyers will always advise full tort.   The tort option is your ability to sue insurance companies for what is called non-economic damages.   So let's say someone t-bones you and it's obvious they are at fault. Now let's say they have the state minimum of 15k.   You are injured. You are life flighted from the scene to the hospital. You suffer no serious permanent injuries. Just a broken arm, a few broken ribs, broken leg and concussion. The breaks didn't require plates or screws. But you spend 4 days in the hospital and can't work for 6 weeks.  Limited tort option: their insurance covers the first $15k of medical bills/property damage. Let's say $10k in damage to your car. Then  the other $5k goes towards medical bills. That barely scratches the $50k life flight bill.   Now your insurance kicks in. They pay your medical bills/lost wages up to your underinsured limits.     Full Tort: Covers all the same above but now you can recover something for pain & suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, the inconvenience of being in the hospital, not being able to play baseball with your kid, loss of consortium (can't have sex). If your married your spouse can sue because you can't do your spousal duties. So in short, if your involved in an accident, even one as simple as a rear end collision, you can recover money for your suffering."
Insurance,36ookb,kowalski10,1 point,Thu May 21 11:44:11 2015 UTC,Ok.  Why would my insurer charge me more for this choice? Would my un/underinsured limits apply in this scenario of non-money damages?
Insurance,36ookb,theINSURANCEguy,1 point,Thu May 21 13:07:04 2015 UTC,"Your UM/UIM limits are exactly what they are - If the other party is at fault and you are injured, but their liability limits are insufficient or non existent - the UM/UIM coverage kicks in for your specific medical bills. Tort options are the ability to sue the other parties insurer for additional damages as /u/tang81 as explained. (names vary by state but PA is Limited or Full Tort).  Source: Broker located in PA."
Insurance,36ookb,kowalski10,2,Thu May 21 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"So UM/UIM would not apply to these additional damages regardless of tort option? If so, why are Full Tort premiums higher?"

Insurance,36ookb,prefontaine,1 point,Thu May 21 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"UM/UIM does not apply if the other party is adequately insured, and from my understanding it generally works in the same manner as BI coverage, so why would full tort matter in the event that UM/UIM coverage is applied if it does cover non-economic damage? Wouldn't it be more applicable to PIP or Medpay coverage (i.e. the right to sue your own insurer as opposed to a third party)? Can you clarify for me?   Also, and this may be state-specific, but UM/UIM generally does not cover property damage. That's usually handled under your collision or UMPD. How is this handled in PA?"
Insurance,36ookb,tang81,1 point,Thu May 21 22:59:43 2015 UTC,They only apply to non-economic damages IF you select the full tort option. If you select limited tort then you can only claim economic damages.

Also, you might consider getting a personal umbrella policy if you have concerns about being sued for wrongful eviction, invasion of privacy, etc.  It is not fun evicting someone that lives on the other side of the wall from you...but that's a whole separate story."

Find out when the home was renovated (plumbing, heating, electrical, roof) as if this was done recently it can really help (may have to prove it with permits).  Put your house and cars together, look at a $2,500 deductible instead of $1k or $500 (if you are comfortable with that)."

There's 2 of everything, so some major system is always breaking, there will never not be a clogged pipe somewhere in the house, and, yeah, the insurance is more expensive.  But you've also got that rent coming in to subsidize the mortgage & insurance.  There's also some pretty great tax benefits that you may not be aware of.  Where in a normal house, replacing a furnace is just money gone, as a landlord, you get to treat that as a business expense.  Even buying bug spray to spray outside counts as a business expense.

Insurance,36mx7t,anothernewyorker1,2,Wed May 20 15:41:25 2015 UTC,Generally movers have an option to insure things at a higher rate than the 60 cents. There are products for you but they can be expensive.
Insurance,36mx7t,key2616,2,Wed May 20 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"Are you SURE your property isn't covered in transit by either your NY or CA policies?  The standard insuring agreement in a renters policy starts with the phrase ""We cover personal property owned or used by an insured while it is anywhere in the world.""  If it's really not, you should at least be able to add a Scheduled Personal Property endorsement to your policy that will at least protect your most valuable items (artwork, musical instruments, jewelry...) while in transit and storage.    If that doesn't work, have you asked the moving company about increased limits?  The 60 cents thing is what's called a released bill of lading - you're releasing them from their normal liability in return for a ""released rate.""  They should offer higher limits for a higher bill.  If none of that works, there are always standalone personal articles floaters that will cover your valuable items.  The storage facility may also have their own policy to protect clients' property.  I think $100K is the standard limit on these policies, but I might be wrong."
Insurance,36mx7t,forneusFQ,1 point,Wed May 20 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that under a tenant/renter's policy your stuff is usually covered anywhere in the world - however, many are Named Peril and will only cover you for fire, lightning, etc. The moving company being rough and breaking or damaging your stuff wouldn't be covered.

Insurance,36mx7t,IntricatelySimple,1 point,Wed May 20 22:11:48 2015 UTC,"Short answer:  I always recommend Baker insurance: https://www.bakerintl.com/  The longer hopefully more informative answer/explanation:  The $.60 per/lbs is the minimum coverage required by the Max 4 Tariff in CA (my state). I believe this is very common across multiple sates so I am assuming that NY is similar OR the company you are using is adhering to the CA PUC regulations.   If you are not offered additional coverage options ($250 deductible, $500 deductible, ACV (actual cash value) or full coverage) by the moving company, they are NOT adhering to the CA PUC regulations and NY may allow to not offer additional coverage. Personally, I have never seen this as it is required in CA and most reputable companies will offer the above mentioned options regardless of state.  I specialize in the industry and have been heavily involved on both client (shipper) and company (carrier) sides of household goods transportation and insurance for motor carriers for over 10 years.

Insurance,36mx7t,VenturaMeathead,1 point,Wed May 20 22:25:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for everyone's comments.  After posting this I talked to multiple people and my insurance again. So they will cover the move but only for the 16 named perils. Breakage (by the moving company) is not something that is covered. According to the ins company, not sure if true, they are not aware of polices by any company that covers this.  In my policy they will cover belongings for 10% of the insured amount if it's not retained in the residence that the policy is for. So I have $27,400 coverage and they would only pay out 10% of that amount.   Not sure if this is typical of renters insurance or if anyone is more familiar with this matter, I'd certainly appreciate your feedback.  Separately from all of this, not sure if at this point I can get new renters insurance elsewhere with ""better coverage"". I'm moving out next week on the 28th, living in temporary housing for 30 days and then obtaining a permanent address in SF. At which point I would need new renters policy to reflect CA law. That would seem off to the insurer if I get a NY policy and a month later now need CA policy."
Insurance,36ntem,Ina_Macie,5,Wed May 20 19:06:23 2015 UTC,"I say go through your insurance. The amount your premiums will go up will not be more than $680.00.   Yes, it is rude to ask the Ford owner to get a second quote. They didn't ask you to back in to them and now you are asking them to go out of their way to make things easier on you.  The amount of the estimate seems about right. The labor is not just putting a bumper on a car. They have to paint the bumper and blend the paint in to the other panels to make sure everything blends correctly. Depending on where you are labor can be anywhere from $60.00 an hour up to $120.00 per hour."
Insurance,36ntem,Kittyisnotaninja,1 point,Wed May 20 21:07:12 2015 UTC,"Submit a claim and let insurance handle.  This falls under liability, which will be paid with no deductible from you.  Maybe your rate will jump up, but that'll be spread out over whatever payment plan you use to pay your premium, which is probably preferable to paying $700 in one lump sum now if money is tight.  And you can always shop around if your renewal rate really jumps up, which would be surprising with such a minor claim."
Insurance,36ntem,forneusFQ,1 point,Wed May 20 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"You will need to provide a little more info for people to give you an accurate answer. For instance which country state province etc are you in. And what are the details of the accident.  With that being said labour has no correlation with the price of a part, it could be a $5 part but if it takes 2 hours to install they will certainly charge for two hours. Often times repair work costs well and above what the part costs.if the bumper needs to be replaced the old needs to be taken off the new one painted and put on. Probably missed a lot of other steps but that's a very generalization of what needs to happen just to replace the bumper.  Most likely its a good few hours at leas tof work and depending where you live its really hard to say what they might be charging for labour. For instance my company in Ontario Canada will pay usually $55 an hour, but the same shop would and does charge for the same work about $75+/hour"
Insurance,36ntem,Phil_Achio,1 point,Wed May 20 19:58:47 2015 UTC,"$680 could be a really high or a reasonable estimate. If there is damage other than the bumper as well, it's not a bad cost because there's going to be paint involved. If it's just for the bumper, could also be reasonable depending on what other items are on the estimate. The price of the bumper is one, the paint and labor and material is another. Some questions worth considering are whether or not the bumper is repairable or truly needs to be replaced. Maybe the owner asked the shop to write it as a replacement and it can in fact be repaired. The other question is whether or not they are writing for a brand new bumper. It is not owed. A recycled 2011 bumper in good condition is owed, and that is what the insurance would owe and pay for as well. The car had a 2011 part on it, that's what's owed per the principle of indemnity. That said, you've got a duty to report the loss, per the policy terms. You are liable for someone else's damages."

Insurance,36lsoa,DaddyBurton,4,Wed May 20 09:33:25 2015 UTC,"I saw your post over in /r/legaladvice and followed you over here.  I can answer these questions here, and I see you've gotten good advice over there on the pay issue already.  Generally speaking, a new valet driver should have his MVR run prior to or immediately after his start date.  The employee isn't responsible for running that report, but the employer has to pass the relevant information (DL # etc.) along to the folks who do (either an independent firm or the insurance company).  Generally speaking, the insurance company only cares if someone has a bad record, but I know from experience that there are some insurance companies that don't require MVR's to be run for every employee.    Valet insurance is very specialized, and there aren't that many companies that offer the coverage - mainly because of the Ferris Bueller factor.  Think a couple of knuckleheads out hotdogging in a vintage Porsche.  That's a huge potential liability for the insurance company, and it's not all that far-fetched.  But there are several companies that take the stance that since there is so much turnover in employees that the expense of running MVR's just isn't worth it.  I don't agree with that, but that's what they think.  Based on this thread and the other, though, my best educated guess is that your boss does not have any insurance at all.  You've referred to him as the ""CEO"", which in this story strikes me as a younger guy legitimizing and aggrandizing himself with a fancy title.  I'd be very careful about tying yourself too closely to him since I suspect that he's probably not on the up-and-up.  Just my $0.02."
Insurance,36lsoa,key2616,3,Wed May 20 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response!   I do agree, with everything you said. When I get back on site, I am serving him papers for payment. As well as contacting the client to make sure the insurance is real, because it doesn't sound like it is.   The client seems like ""You have an insurance card, great! I don't have to call and verify because how would you get one without it?""  We'll see."
Insurance,36lsoa,key2616,3,Wed May 20 13:29:12 2015 UTC,"Wait - this is different than what I thought it was.  Is the company that you're parking cars for (i.e. a restaurant) providing the insurance or is it your boss?  If it's your boss's client, that could solve some of the mysteries.    But then you mention an insurance card, which makes it sound like they're checking your own personal coverage.  That has absolutely nothing to do with valet operations since the card just represents coverage for your own vehicle and not anyone else's.  If that's what the boss and client are relying on, then you need to run as fast as you can from this operation."
Insurance,36lsoa,emptydiner,3,Wed May 20 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"/u/key2616 has offered a lot of good and sound advise.  It takes a lot to get insurance(Garage Liability, Garage-Keepers Legal Liability, workers comp, and possible others) for a valet company in my state including a list of all locations where the company works, a list of all drivers with DL#'s, address, DOB's and marital status.  A lot of questions about key controls, driving patterns, types of turns(left or right).  It's a process and I am guessing the ""company"" you work for does not have insurance and quite possibly not be a legitimate company recognized by your state.    An accident is an accident.  Police are sometimes called, sometimes not, but the valet company is generally on the hook for the damage.    I have a client that one of his employees ran over an illegal alien on his bike going the wrong way on a one-way road and the valet companies insurance is forking that bill."

Insurance,36l4t3,scaredstarter,6,Wed May 20 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"A few rules I have grown my business with. First, I have never met any agent/broker who was successful right out of the gate. Many start strong but get into a pretty big slump after their natural market goes dry. It's the ones that play the slow and steady game that make the top of the table every year.   1- Don't Care About Failure. Every broker/agent fails miserably. My first-year commissions were less than 7K. (Failed)It is a numbers game and the more times you fail, the more people you talk to, the better you will be.   2- Never Make A Sale. Sales are based on salespeople chasing compensation and if compensation is your focus, this is not the right business. Be a counselor/trusted adviser and not a salesperson. Teach your clients why doing business with you is in their best interest and your primary focus is making sure this is the right product/service for them. You will have clients for life. They will then refer you to their friends and family, this is how you grow your business.   3- Do what you say. This will set you apart from 70% of all other agents/brokers. To many brokers/agents make promises to their clients they never keep. We hurt as an industry because of this type of behavior. Do what you say, when you say it and the clients will come to you.   4- Find a niche that you enjoy and are knowledgeable about. When I was first starting they told me ""you will develop a niche over time."" This was absolutely not the case and I spend a good part of 3 years spinning my wheels trying to meet as many people as possible. The problem, different industries have specific needs and you will spend more time trying to understand everything than focusing on one specific market and knowing everything. It was not until I decided and made a plan based on the market I wanted to engage in, did my business start to take off.  This will be your primary area of influence. If you can relate to the business owner/individual, you will have much better success developing a relationship and servicing your clients in the manner they wish. Talking insurance with individuals that do not understand insurance/financial products is one of the hardest things to do. If you can relate the products to their own experience, this will make it more understandable and easier to digest when you start talking premiums.   Don't worry that you don't have a natural market. Neither did I. I moved to a brand new city and knew nobody.   Good luck and keep your head up."

You are surrounded by people who are not insurance agents, do not know what you know, and have concerns related to the uncertainties of life which you are able to alleviate for them. These are all potential customers. Figure out what you want to tell them, approach them, and arrange meetings with them. Convey the idea that it can't possibly hurt to know more about their options and rights.  Walk into small businesses and offer meetings. Hang out at the bus stop near a retirement home. Ask open ended questions. Ask when the last time they sat down with an agent and reviewed their coverage is. Do not be afraid to tell someone you meet with that their current coverage is fine, or that you'd like to do more research before making a recommendation. Become a expert in your field.  A new agent will think this is a skill game, that you have to get smarter to sell. A more advanced agent will think this is a luck game, that you have to get lucky to find the right people to sell to. A veteran agent will know this is a numbers game, that you have to talk with a certain number of new prospects every day to find new business.  Don't give up, don't be afraid, and don't sell yourself short. To have what others don't you must do what others won't."

I'm a little hesitant to give them my credit card info to know what my real rate is."
Insurance,36k43c,imamadbro,3,Wed May 20 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"Did you make sure to get the payouts right?   Depending what state you're in, the speeding ticket may still show up."
Insurance,36k43c,imamadbro,1 point,Wed May 20 02:42:38 2015 UTC,"They never asked for a payout amount on their website. I only received a payout of $1,600, and that went directly to the shop from the other party's insurance. There was a passenger in my vehicle that got a settlement from their insurance, but I do not know the amount. Nobody else asked for that amount on the online claims websites, for what it's worth.  And hopefully it doesn't. I have proof that charges were dropped and that I was never convicted, but I'm not sure if that would still show up. My driving school instructor insisted that it wouldn't, and Erie has not said anything to me about it, for what it's worth.  I'm in Virginia, if that makes a difference."
Insurance,36k43c,Fulline,5,Wed May 20 02:51:35 2015 UTC,"Even if it was an NAF accident it will still make a difference in your rate, once the MVR is ran it will pull the payout. I forget about Virginia specifics, but your passengers medical may make a difference as well."
Insurance,36k43c,britt5689,4,Wed May 20 03:17:02 2015 UTC,"Im also curious to know how Geico does it. They spend millions on commercials and still come out cheaper in the end.   I know Geico doesn't run MVR, so make sure they do otherwise your rate might change. Also what state are you in?"

Insurance,36k43c,fiveeightthirteen,4,Wed May 20 02:25:38 2015 UTC,"This rate is not accurate. They haven't run your credit score, insurance score, or MVR. Once you actually agree to purchase the policy, your rates will go up."
Insurance,36k43c,fiveeightthirteen,1 point,Wed May 20 14:19:49 2015 UTC,"Are they allowed to raise rates AFTER I purchase the policy? In my mind, they should have to tell you what you're paying before you pay them.  I understand that my rate could increase if they have more information or discover mistakes, but it strikes me as false advertising if they would raise the rates substantially, since I've answered everything they've asked as fully and honestly as possible.   And having said all that, even if they did raise the premium by 100%, it's still significantly less than the rest of the competitors."
Insurance,36k43c,dan_232,2,Wed May 20 14:27:21 2015 UTC,"To chime in on this, there's a good chance that your quote from them is sincere or close to sincere. Another huge rating factor is who your prior insurance is with and what your limits are.   If you had a lapse of insurance in the past 6-12 months, Erie is charging you for that but Geico is just seeing you've been with Erie for long enough to make it a good deal to give you a good rate.   Geico also sees Erie as a preferred company so they're trying to steal preferred business. If you were with a nonstandard company like the General or whatever your local brand is, your rate would not be as hot.   Lastly, your limits of $250k/500k are great indicators you are a preferred client. If your limits before Erie were $25k/50k, Erie is in the process of transitioning you from a standard/nonstandard to a preferred client so they're currently giving you the standard rate. I would expect if this were the case that they give you the preferred rate at renewal."
Insurance,36k43c,Rocheforte,1 point,Wed May 20 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting stuff.  I've been with Erie for about 3 months, with a different vehicle. The new vehicle has been insured by them for a few days.  Before Erie, I was covered by Safeco under my family's policy. I've never had a lapse in coverage at any time, but I've only been insured for 3 months on my own policy, if that means anything.  And I had $250K/500K with Erie for the past three months (no collision or comp though), so my limits are staying the same, not increasing from Erie to GEICO."
Insurance,36k43c,PA-Agent-Broker,2,Wed May 20 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"Do you know if you were actually listed as a driver under your parents' policy with Safeco? They may be rating you as a brand new driver never insured before and that definitely hurts. If that's the case, get your Erie agent to put in that you were with Safeco for x number of years.   Also, were your parents' limits also $250k/500?  You could at this point tell your agent you got a new quote from Geico for cheaper, but some guy on the internet told you to ask him to requote your policy. If he requotes you, there's a chance that the prior insurance out on your own could knock you down quite a bit.   I would suggest based off a knowledgeable and accessible agent, it's better to stay with a real agent than going online. Your agent might be neither knowledgeable or accessible, and if that's the case, give him the boot."
Insurance,36k43c,Rocheforte,1 point,Wed May 20 17:29:03 2015 UTC,"I'm 99.9% sure that I was listed as a driver under their policy with Safeco with $250/500K limits, but I'll check to make sure.  I've had the same agent for quite some time (he's an independent agent with Safeco and Erie and other comapnies), so he's aware of the whole situation, and should be able to verify everything. So far he's been accessible and knowledgeable, but I haven't really had to use him that much (knock on wood).  Since he's done a good job for us so far (based on my limited interactions), I'm happy to stay loyal to him and support his local independent in-person agency, but I'm not sure if I'm $90/mo loyal....  EDIT: Just talked with my family, and they confirmed I was listed as a driver with the same $250K/500K limits"

Insurance,36jobw,Doc_Lee,6,Wed May 20 00:09:55 2015 UTC,This is correct. Health has nothing to do with your rate and is not allowed to be included as a factor. If your friend is paying less it's because he has a different plan or is subsidized through his employer.

Insurance,36kcjj,spiritbear872,10,Wed May 20 00:47:47 2015 UTC,"Relax, it's not the end of the world even though it may seem pretty bad right now. Your insurance rates are probably going to go up, you're right. Whether they drop you depends on your company's particular guidelines, but if you have an otherwise clean history there's a good chance they won't.  As far as renting a car while you're on vacation, this won't play a factor at all. Rental companies don't check your driving history, so you'll be fine in that aspect.  As long as your liability limits are enough to cover damages to the other car, you should be okay here.   I've been in more car accidents than I care to admit. Mostly my fault too. It's definitely stressful, but it could always be worse. Try to cut yourself some slack and enjoy that vacation - sounds like you could use it!"
Insurance,36kcjj,powerhawkmash,4,Wed May 20 04:35:35 2015 UTC,"Also, settling is a terrible idea.  Mostly because your policy expressly prohibits you from doing anything like that.  Whoever suggested that, don't ask them for insurance advice again.  Everybody gets that insurers send an adjuster out to assess damage and writes checks for the amount of damage, but a lot of people forget that your policy also contains a duty to defend.  Your insurer employs hundreds if not thousands of attorneys and if anything like a settlement happens, they'll do all that for you.  You don't even have to be involved.  You don't even have to ask them for legal assistance, it's their duty to provide it under the terms of the policy."
Insurance,36kcjj,forneusFQ,1 point,Wed May 20 13:43:05 2015 UTC,My agent actually suggested this along with a friend. The friend may well not get it but it is more troubling that the agent would suggest this.

Let them take care of it, and don't even think about it.  Going forward, yes, you will probably see a rate increase for a few years, but there aren't many companies that will drop you for having one accident.  Even if they do, don't sweat it.  There are plenty of insurance companies that will take you."

Insurance,36j7bx,Kniles,1 point,Tue May 19 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"If you haven't paid anything on the first account, it would not show up on the deductible, since you haven't paid it yet. Hopsitals use third party systems to find out from payors if you have met deductibles or what your copays are. In these instances the data would have already had to be sent to the third party system that you have met these items.  You can always request a detailed bill of your charges and dispute any you feel unfair. In some hospitals you could actually pay less if you ask for either a prompt pay discount or if you forgo insurance and opt to pay for services as a self pay. The hospital I work at currently gives a 40% discount if you pay out of pocket instead of going thru insurance."
Insurance,36jy50,Ed_Tivrusky_IV,11,Tue May 19 22:58:51 2015 UTC,The other driver's carrier should pay 100% of your rental car cost if the other driver was 100% liable. It sounds like you filed the claim through your own carrier so you'll need to contact the other driver's carrier for reimbursement. Your carrier will only subrogate for the coverage you have on your policy.  Additionally you should consider raising your rental coverage in the event of future claims.
Insurance,36jy50,PleaseNoNames,3,Wed May 20 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this. Have the other insurance carrier set up a rental for you if possible and request a larger class size. Once that's squared away, update your renter's coverage to 30/day at the least. It should be as customizable as picking a deductible."
Insurance,36jy50,Rocheforte,2,Wed May 20 00:40:57 2015 UTC,Thus stuff is another thing about american insurance that is just crazy. In Canada you pay for loss of use you get comparable model covered.

Insurance,36jy50,jenjam85,4,Wed May 20 00:57:57 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like a crazy subrogation issue in this situation. They chose a specific limit for that specific coverage. Their company will subrogate for that coverage. So they'll get exactly what they paid for from their carrier, anything above should be paid by the at fault parties carrier. If they had opted for higher rental coverage their company would pay the cost & subrogate against the other company. Seems pretty cut & dry to me."

Insurance,36jy50,northofindy,8,Thu May 21 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"Your own rental coverage is a first party coverage that you bought and there  is absolutely  no way they will go over it.  Talk to your agent about increasing it to a higher limit.  When it comes to first party coverage you only get what you pay for.  Now if you present the claim to the other party's insurance  they should cover a comparable vehicle  (at least in most states, some states only require  them to reimburse you for basic transportation )."
Insurance,36jy50,FunandFailure,1 point,Wed May 20 01:03:01 2015 UTC,So is this to say that informing my own insurance was ill advised?  I was under the impression that it was protocol.  Should I have reached out to her insurance directly?
Insurance,36jy50,BuckEm,4,Wed May 20 03:05:24 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily ill advised.  When you are in an accident and the other party is at fault you have 2 options:   Go through your own insurance. This is usually the quickest and easiest option, they can get your car into a shop and begin repairs immediately.  The down side is that you have to pay your deductible, but your insurance should be able to recover that for you through a process called subrogation (note that subrogation can take months) and if you have rental coverage with a small dollar amount you will have to make due with what your coverage provides. Go through the at fault party's insurance.  In a perfect world this is the best option , however this can end up being a long and frustrating process.  Sometimes there are coverage issues (they didn't pay their bill or an excluded driver was driving the car) or the other driver refuses to call and provide their facts of loss or ends up telling their own company a made up story about what happened."
Insurance,36jy50,Jake_77,1 point,Wed May 20 03:15:31 2015 UTC,"My insurance waived the deductible off the bat because she was cooperating, had admitted fault to me, and was very forthcoming with all of her details.  I was frustrated when I did the OP, but it seems like I have at least one avenue to pursue today, to see if I can keep the U part of my SUV, while I am in the process of moving.  That's the real killer!"
Insurance,36jy50,mail323,2,Wed May 20 10:00:55 2015 UTC,"You can do either. In your situation I would have suggested you go through theirs because you don't have proper coverage for your needs. But that's assuming:   Coverage is in order on their end. Their insured is cooperating.  Liability has been agreed on.  They have enough money to pay for everything.  Their insured isn't being shady.   An issue with any one of those could cause a claim to go from a simple one to one that can last (many) months. So assuming you don't have enough insurance, which it seems like you don't, there isn't a hard and fast rule.   Now, if you had a deductible you could pay, enough rental to last you and meet your needs, I'd advise you to go through your own policy and be done with it. But that isn't the case."

Insurance,36jy50,powerhawkmash,6,Wed May 20 09:58:46 2015 UTC,"As said below, you can get at least $15/day more from the other party's insurance company.  However, $700/week is absurd for a rental car. Insurance typically covers $30/day for 30 days = $900 for a month.   Keep in mind, that in most situations and as longas you have full coverage, your regular auto insurance will cover your rental car, so you don't need to purchase their insurance. Unless you're getting a super fancy rental car, I can't imagine why you would be paying $700/week."

Insurance,36kn7q,SoMuchMoreEagle,1 point,Wed May 20 02:47:02 2015 UTC,I started paying in December so we could get health insurance in January. We never got any type of statement of benefits or cards or anything. Everytime I called they told me to log onto my kp account. I kept asking them to send cards and they said they would now repeat this every 2 weeks or so for 5 months. I finally started blowing up the CEO on twitter and magically I can login now. I even got my card in the mail. Now they are saying she was dropped for nonpayment. We are on a family account which I have been paying in full.

All the non-group plans are individual.     Were you on automatic payment or were you being billed?  Did you look back on your statements to see if they processed payment for February?  You didn't receive a cancelation notice for your wife?   What state are you in?  Did you have an agent when you signed up?  Did you sign up directly or through a state or federal exchange?

Insurance,36kn7q,mbevks,3,Wed May 20 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"It might take some time, but there may be something you can do.  First, gather up all the paperwork you have, along with your bank or credit card statements (whatever you used to pay).  Scan everything and have it ready.  Second, call the Maryland health exchange and ask for them to review your and your wife's application to see if there is anything missing.  Proof of income, residency, anything.  That could be why it was canceled, but the person at Kaiser mistook it as a payment issue.    If everything is fine from that angle, call Kaiser.  Tell them that you have proof of payment and that their records are incorrect and that you would like your wife's insurance re-instated.  If they want proof, ask for that person's email address and send it directly to them.  DO NOT FAX IT.  I cannot stress this enough.  I don't trust faxes to large companies.  They often go into a black hole and no one ever seems to look at them.  Pdfs and email only.    They will probably have to process your request and that may take  a few days (nothing happens instantly with insurance companies).  Ask for that person's direct line.  Write down their name, along with the date and time you called.  If they won't give you a direct line or don't have one, ask for a call record number or something like that so you can reference the previous call when you call back.  They should make notes in their system of the call and what it was about.    Follow up in a few days to see if it is going through.  If they say your wife is re-enrolled, ask for an email confirmation of that.    ***Also, most importantly, you must remain calm.  If you sound upset or raise your voice, the person will not be as inclined to help you.  Remember: who ever you are talking to, your problem is not their fault.  They are just one person doing their job.  They are not Kaiser.  Don't take your frustration out on them.    You also need to be very clear and concise.  Your original post was very difficult to understand.  Don't mention the BBB or filing a complaint.  Just state your problem, that you have proof that it should not have happened, and ask for the person's help.    And when they say they will try to help, say thank you.  If they do help in any way, say thank you.  It really does mean a lot.    Good luck.  Let me know how it goes."

I was taking a detour through a new area due to construction and I was not familiar with those roads. The other driver definitely has the right of way because only I had the stop sign."
Insurance,36is1k,Phil_Achio,4,Wed May 20 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"I think you got lucky only being held 50% at fault like the other post says have someone wave you through doesn't negate your responsibility. And part of the reason its 50% is cause they may have felt that the car that hit you was partly at fault as they were considering it as a single road.  I'd say just eat the fault determination, cause they very easily could've held you 100% at fault."
Insurance,36is1k,northofindy,3,Wed May 20 00:41:09 2015 UTC,"Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop sign or a flashing red signal indication shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right of way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways  There is the statute.  If you are at a stop  sign you must yield to any vehicle approaching the intersection."
Insurance,36is1k,BlackEarth2012,3,Wed May 20 01:08:30 2015 UTC,"1) Am I truly more than 50% fault in this case? How is ""fault"" even calculated?   Yes, you are.  You were at a controlled part of the intersection, the other driver was at an uncontrolled part.  You owed them the right of way, and the accident occurred.  Whether or not there was another driver who waved you by isn't really relevant.  It's still your responsibility to ensure that the road is clear for you to go. Like Phil_Achio said, you're lucky if they didn't place you 100% at fault for this.  Keep in mind I'm not talking about how things should be, I'm talking about how they actually are in these situations.  Fault determination is somewhat subjective, but adjusters typically use state statutes and precedents.     2) Is there any official rule about unmarked roads and how they can be considered 2 lanes if they are wide enough?   No, not really, but it might depend on your state.  When I was a liability adjuster, I had some claims where we won using that argument and some where we lost.  The word ""inconsistent"" comes to mind.  It depends on who's making the decision, whether it be an arbitration board or if it goes to court.  One thing I've noticed is that decisions made in arbitration usually align more with logic than court decisions.   3) Will there be any consequences for attempting to appeal the surcharge?   There is no appeal process for this. You could be ""that guy"" and complain to your adjuster's supervisor, but there's little likelihood of success for that."
Insurance,36is1k,powerhawkmash,1 point,Wed May 20 01:11:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed reply! I definitely agree the other driver had the right of way.   I did some searching about the unmarked roads, but all the results seemed inconsistent as well, and it looked like it was one of those ""use your best judgement"" situations. So I was curious if anyone here knew any official ruling for such a scenario. I thought it would be good to know for the future as well, in case the roles were reversed, and I end up driving on a road with no markings.   And I would never complain to a supervisor just because someone was doing their job. When I mentioned appealing, I was referring to a ""Surcharge Appeal"" for at-fault accidents. But after seeing everyone's replies, I don't think it would be worth it."
Insurance,36is1k,powerhawkmash,3,Wed May 20 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're definitely more than 50% at fault. Others have covered that aspect pretty well.  You'd be smart to appeal the surcharge though. Honestly, the Massachusetts DMV is a joke and they overturn these things all the time. It's far from a guarantee, but if you fill out the form and pay the $50 fee, you have a decent chance at beating it. You might have to show up in court, but if it's not a 100% clearly at fault accident, you really never know what they might do.   If you have $50 to spare for the filing charge, it's a decent option and could save you some serious money in the long run. It won't necessarily keep your insurance rates from going up, but the surcharge in MA is outrageous and I would probably contest it if it was me. There are no consequences if you lose, why not roll the dice?"
Insurance,36is1k,FunandFailure,1 point,Wed May 20 04:40:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you. That is what I was considering when I saw the option of appealing the surcharge. It looked like it would be worth a shot even if there was a slim chance of success. My concern was that attempting to appeal may get myself into more trouble if they later decide that I am 100%, as a result of the hearing.    It won't necessarily keep your insurance rates from going up    But that is the first time I have heard about insurance rates going up regardless of fault... I always thought that only at-fault accidents would raise insurance rates."

You mentioned on that post that your incorrect name was listed as an excluded driver. That is likely where the issue is coming from.  You need to speak with you agent and find out when you were and who listed you as excluded. This very well could be a clerical error and if it is the claim should be covered. If someone really did list you as an excluded driver and the named insured signed off on it then you wouldn't have any coverage."

Insurance,36hc0t,Cicatrized,4,Wed May 20 01:14:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you are an excluded driver that means you weren't allowed to drive the car. Ever.   If you were excluded then you will have to go with the other party's insurance to get repaired.   eta: This has to be the excluded driver thing. Because even if your name was incorrect on the policy the policy covers the vehicle first, usually whoever is driving. Meaning I could let my buddy drive my car and if there's an accident the car is still covered (usually). Yeah, I'm nearly positive that the issue isn't your name but the excluded driver."

I can tell you that any typos or unmatched names (John Allen Smith vs Allen Smith vs Joe Schmoe) doesn't matter. The moment you said ""I am that person"" is a good enough reason to deny coverage if you are excluded on the policy.

My insurance agent is investigating this case. Thank you so much for your help."
Insurance,36ilor,FunandFailure,3,Wed May 20 19:42:00 2015 UTC,What do you mean a name error is holding this up?  There should be an insurance company listed on the police report. As soon as you get the name you just call and file a claim. Companies are usually pretty good at finding their insureds based on whatever information you have.   If you can't find the insurance give it to your insurance company and ask them to file a claim for you.
Insurance,36fgyg,muogue,2,Mon May 18 23:48:36 2015 UTC,"You may check with your card company. Many cards have rules that their coverage is secondary, requiring you to use your personal auto insurance first."

You're using liability coverage from the rental place and using your credit card to cover comp & collision?  If you don't currently have an auto policy, filing this claim will have no impact on your rates in the future.  Insurers get their info on your driving history from 2 sources - your driving record provided by the DMV and loss runs provided by other insurers.  If you didn't get a ticket and you don't currently have insurance, there will be no record of this claim that an insurance company can access.  Insurers will consider this time period a gap in coverage, which WILL negatively impact your rating - not because you're doing anything wrong by not having a personal policy in place, but for the very reason that they're not able to obtain any info on your accident history during this time."

Insurance,36ftjg,ChineseAstronaut,3,Tue May 19 01:31:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think that to an adjuster your diminished value claim is preferrable now, that you are actually looking to sell the car, rather than a claim put forth as speculative ""I think my car is worth less now, but I'm not really looking to sell"". Contact the insurance company of the at fault driver and put them on notice of your situation, and ask them what comes next. It will likely come down to you having to retain a professional appraiser that would then assess if there is a loss in value, and what that amount is. But you definitely want to talk to the insurance company before you go spending any money on that route to see what direction they provide. Diminished value is sometimes difficult to nail down to a specific amount, keep in mind there is always a possibility for negotiation."

No insurance company wants to lose customers, and rate increases will do just that. You can always shop your rate.

For instance, if your plan was on the Reddit Network, and you switched to a plan with lesser benefits in the same Reddit Network, you would have the same list of doctors to choose from as your PCP/OBGYN. However, if you switched to the Upvote network, the doctor may not be in that network and as such be ineligible for any type of coverage. I haven't really seen it where a doctor is participating in both networks but is an OBGYN in one and not in another...but it is possible if they have separate provider/FTINs for that purpose.  It's worth noting that you may have to specifically select your PCP/OBGYN and have it listed on your profile for your claims to process under the primary copayments as opposed to a specialist, or that your provider may serve both as OBGYN and a specialist."

Insurance,36dqd0,lemonsole,2,Mon May 18 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"Under the ACA, a company only gets fined if they A) do not offer a plan to their FT employees that offers a Minimum Essential Coverage MEC ($2,000 penalty) at a max of 9.5% of their wage and B) they do not offer a plan that meets Minimum Value (MV) and has an employee that gets an Exchange subsidy ($3,000 penalty).   In other words, they have no idea what they're talking about. If your mom is not getting coverage through the federal/state marketplace exchange and the coverage they offer meets MV requirements,  there will be no fine imposed on the employer."

Insurance,36dqd0,forneusFQ,1 point,Mon May 18 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know the full answer to your question, hopefully someone on here has more expertise.  I think what they're telling you is correct.  I think that's because, as a government contractor, this job falls under the Service Contract Act, which requires a certain hourly health & welfare rate to be paid to each employee.  I think in the past, instead of providing insurance, the employer could just pay cash or some other fringe benefit, but I believe the Affordable Care Act changed that so that they must provide primary coverage or pay a penalty.  I might be completely wrong.  I tried researching this and found myself reading Dept of Defense press releases and got totally lost."

They count loss of short-term medical coverage as a life event (at least in this state).  Call Cigna (assuming you have it in your state) and speak to someone about temporary/short-term insurance.  You can have it for 30 days and then get a regular medical policy with them.  YRMV."
Insurance,36e01r,walshe25,2,Mon May 18 17:16:33 2015 UTC,"I've done it before.  One of the biggest hurdles will be having a permanent ""address.""  You're going to have to tag and title your car in the state where you buy the vehicle.  One of my friends used to sell cars in Atlanta, and he had a customer do the same thing you were doing.  He let the guy use the dealership as the address, helped him with the tag and title, and I wrote an insurance policy for 6 months - Paid in Full.    I'd recommend finding someone who can do the vehicle and registration first, then asking if they have any insurance contacts that can help."
Insurance,36e01r,Killboy_Powerhead,1 point,Mon May 18 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that the dealer address might be best or if I stay in an air bnb or a hotel maybe that address.   Yea the vehicle registration is one more awkward thing. (I think there's a certain time frame to do it within?)   You did the insurance policy so did you need precious driving record? I'm assuming it wasn't as competitive a price as a native would get, because not being from there you can't look up and confirm our previous insurance records?  If I'm only there for 1 month, 6 month policy is still the shortest?   Thanks!"
Insurance,36e01r,Killboy_Powerhead,3,Mon May 18 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"If you buy from a dealer, they would be the one to do the registration for you and it varies from state to state.  A lot of places you have 30 days, so you'll be pushing the limit with your paperwork.  You will probably need to get an International Driver's license, and yes, we can look that information up.  No, your price won't be competitive with local insurance.  California is pretty expensive for insurance anyway.  You may be better off starting in Seattle or Atlanta rather than NY or California or Florida.  6 months is the shortest auto policy I've seen, and if I were doing it for someone I wouldn't take less than a Paid in Full policy for 6 months, otherwise it wouldn't be worth it for me to write up the policy."

Insurance is included.   If you're really set on going through the hassle of buying and registering a car, try the General. They offer <6 month policies. Or just get a regular insurance policy. When you cancel, you'll get reimbursed for the portion of the term that you didn't use."

Insurance,36e01r,r4ndpaulsbrilloballs,2,Mon May 18 18:19:59 2015 UTC,You're going to have a really hard time with this one since you have no permanent US address to base your rates off of.
Insurance,36e01r,r4ndpaulsbrilloballs,2,Mon May 18 19:23:13 2015 UTC,"If you were 25, renting would be cheaper.  Budget's showing about $1,100 for unlimited miles LAX to JFK from 6/20 to 8/20.  Not so bad.  But have to be 25.  Keep in mind that buying a car in the US is going to be a pain in the ass in ways you maybe haven't imagined.  First, you're going to pay state sales tax if you pick it up in California.  And you're going to have to get it registered.  And they're going to hunt you down for excise tax too (or hunt whoever's address you use down...)    Say it's a $5,000 car you buy.  You'll pay almost $500 in sales tax in LA.  Then you'll pay another $200 in excise tax (depending on the address you use).  Then you'll have to go register it, where you'll pay some odd combination of fees.    Either you buy from a dealer, and they'll struggle with this.  Or you buy cheaper not from a dealer, and you'll have to figure it out.  This could take longer and/or be more expensive if you're not a citizen.  I have no clue - not from California.  But I'd factor in another $100 or more.  And it will probably be at least a half day of bureaucracy if you're lucky.  Then you'd have to find and buy insurance for two months.  You might do best to talk to a broker.  The Geico search for agents is here, since you asked.  And I really wouldn't try to push your luck on the registration or with papers if I were you.  A cop comes up behind you without registration, and they're towing the car and maybe leaving you on the side of the road.  You get 10 days from a private purchase in California.  Dealers do it up front.  But the dealers will be taking the tax, title fee, registration fee, and all this stuff and adding it to the cost of the car (whatever they say it will cost).  But do you see how this stuff adds up?  You're going to pay $1,000 in taxes and fees to buy then flip a car in two months anyways.  And you're going to be taking a $5k beater across the continent (in this example).  The more you pay for the car, the higher the fees and taxes will be.  There have to be cheaper/easier ways to do what you want to do.  Have you thought of taking Amtrak (rail) from LA to NY, stopping for a few days here and there, and using one week rentals or ZipCar or something like it for excursions at each stop?  That's probably your cheapest option out of this.  Amtrak tickets drop below $300 from LA to NYC, and you can hunt daily rental car deals down for as cheap as $20 a lot of times.  Otherwise, Avis' website says they will do a 2 month lease on a car to 24 year old ROI citizens from June 20 to August 20 from LAX to JFK (LA to NYC) for $1,300.  Odds are any existing policy you have now and/or your credit card agreement might cover the rental car for liability (check this).  That's probably your cheapest way out of this game if you don't want to do rail.  Not trying to discourage you or anything.  Just want to make sure you realize that you're going to end up paying a lot of taxes and fees one way or the other to buy a car over here, so much so you might not be saving any money (or headaches) over renting something new.  That said, if you find a diamond in the rough and can sell it for a grand more than you bought it for after driving it across the country, you might just be able to gamble your way into doing this for nothing.  But pulling that off usually takes a lot of searching and time..."
Insurance,36czcu,maspien,7,Mon May 18 11:56:47 2015 UTC,Diminished value compensation is usually specifically excluded under collision and comprehensive coverage. This claim that you are referring to is a comprehensive claim. Going to court wouldn't help as the policy language is clear in that diminished value is not owed when something happens to your vehicle and you are compensated by your own insurance company (first party claim). Hate to say it but you are likely SOL on the DV claim.
Insurance,36czcu,Malarkey713,2,Mon May 18 13:41:04 2015 UTC,So I have to eat over 10k in loss? Seems like a bunch of crap.

Going to court is not going to accomplish anything, as all that will do is the insurance company's attorney will simply point out the policy language that excludes the recognition of diminished value. The policy is a contract which you voluntarily signed. Ask your agent for a copy of the policy and read it, you will find the language that excludes diminished value. You're not in Georgia by chance, are you? In Georgia, diminished value IS owed."

Insurance,36czcu,Kittyisnotaninja,6,Mon May 18 18:55:42 2015 UTC,You file a diminished value claim against the party that damaged your vehicle.  Your policy (like all first party policies) will state that diminished  value is not payable under your comprehensive or collision coverage.  You are not going to find a standard auto policy that will pay diminished value under a first party coverage.  It is always something you will have to present to the at fault party.
Insurance,36czcu,Killboy_Powerhead,3,Tue May 19 00:46:16 2015 UTC,You are saying the diminished value claim ONLY is over $10K?
Insurance,36czcu,Kakureta,1 point,Mon May 18 15:30:20 2015 UTC,Yes the diminished value claim so far is only over $10k USD.  I don't have have exact numbers because the car has not been repaired yet. I have talked to a few dealership and they gave me 2 numbers.  One was 65k for near perfect condition (Which my car was in.)  Then and estimate of 53k-55k for the damage estimate of 22k.

I would have to pay $750/month for the cheapest plan. The reason they did this, as far as I can guess, is because most teachers are married to someone outside the district. So they just piggyback on their spouse's insurance plan and get mo money. Kind of fucks over the newer and single teachers I think. I'd rather take the $5k less and get awesome health insurance like most schools in the area offer.

Or is there a certain amount of time I have to wait on any health insurance plan before it kicks in?   You can only upgrade your insurance during open enrollment.  That begins in November for insurance coverage starting on January 1st of the following year.  So, you could technically ""game"" the system, but, you'd have to be diagnosed at the end of the year, but, even then, it's risky.      The cheapest insurance is going to have a high deductible.  For single coverage, the maximum out of pocket expense is $6600.  So, if you were to have the cheapest coverage available, you'd end up paying $6600 out of pocket (in addition to the premium) and the rest of your coverage would be paid for by the insurance company until the beginning of the following year when the maximum out of pocket resets."

If I wait until November, could I sign up for the most expensive plan, get a physical and every test in the book done, then switch to the lowest plan in December if I'm all good?   No, because if you purchase a plan in November, the policy won't start until January 1st.     Sometimes I go into hypochondriac mode and I get paranoid about every little ache and pain I have.    As you get older, you'll have more and more of these things.  You've got to accept that you're not young anymore.   I want to get a physical, but I'm afraid I will have something I can't afford.   It's always better to catch things earlier than wait on them.   for a decade after that diagnosis few insurance companies would cover her.

No matter what it should go as a not-at-fault collision.   You did everything correctly that was in your power.  BTW, as a general rule, don't take insurance advice from police officers, they usually mean well, but they often have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to this stuff.

If you're planning on getting your own policy, why not get it before you go through with the sale?  That's how everyone else in the state does it."
Insurance,36c266,NYAgent112,2,Mon May 18 13:18:11 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, NY takes their insurance very seriously and you have to have valid, active insurance before you can even register/tag the vehicle. If you still live with your parents, you can add the vehicle on to their policy, even if it's in your name, as long as your listed as an operator on the policy. Then if you want to get your own insurance later you can list yourself, and your vehicle on your new policy."
Insurance,36c266,britt5689,3,Mon May 18 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is that NY does not allow the insurance and registration to be in different names.  So you would have to register the car in the parents name, secure insurance for the kid, then re-register in the kids name, then remove the car from the parents policy.  It creates extra, totally unnecessary steps, not to mention an extra registration fee up front.  If OP is intending on getting his or her own insurance, why not just get the insurance before getting the car?  Unless there are financial issues, that's the way it should be done."

Insurance,36b7cc,northofindy,6,Mon May 18 03:54:58 2015 UTC,"The answer is actually in an individual life insurance policy. Many life insurance policies, just like any other insurance coverage, come with certain exclusions that null and void any benefits should you expire in a certain way, i.e., suicide. However, there can be fine print attached to that exclusion. Some policies will pay benefits even if the policyholder committed suicide, but the policyholder would have had to committed suicide after holding the life insurance policy for two to three years depending on the carrier.  Some policies come with a separate exclusion that addresses non-disclosure of mental health and/or drug or alcohol addiction/dependencies. To receive life insurance, many companies require you to take several health tests and submit them, but sometimes, tests are completely optional. Mental illnesses are also taken on a case-by-case basis. If you have a history of serious depression and your life insurance carrier doesn’t know, you run the risk of eliminating any benefits if you commit suicide. Leaving out information like this allows insurance companies to deny benefits based on a contestability clause.  If you are thinking of killing yourself please don't. If you need to talk to someone pm I would love to help you out any way I can"
Insurance,36b7cc,NateDznuts,3,Mon May 18 03:16:33 2015 UTC,"Don't kill yourself.  That said, from a technical standpoint, I think most life insurance policies have a thing where if you kill yourself in the first 2 years, you get nothing, whereas after that they pay the full amount.   Policy wise, the idea is that if you get depression and kill yourself, that is exactly the type of thing you would want to insure against.  Thus it is covered.  Legal theory wise, I'm not sure why there is this ""no coverage period.""  There are a few things that come to mind.  First, it could be detailed in the policy language.  Second, most insurance policies will cover death for everything except a few excluded causes (amatuer plane flying is a common exclusion).  Thus, death by suicide would be covered.  However, if you commited suicide right after purchasing the policy, the insurer might argue in a court that you had mental illness, but did not inform the insurer of it when asked.  Thus, they would argue you misrepresented yourself on the application, and would try to deny coverage.    However, most insurance policies have a ""incontestability period,"" generally about 2 years.  Thus, even if you lied on your life insurance application (said you were not mentally ill, but you were), they would still be obligated to pay out if you had been paying premiums for over two years.    Anyways, remember that if you wait a year or something, conditions will probably improve and you will lose your desire to kill yourself.  Also note that I'm a guy on the internet, so take my advice with a grain of salt.  Don't make any big decisions based on it."

First and foremost, PLEASE compare companies. There are people that save money switching companies, then find out that the policy is totally different.   Second- make sure the coverages are identical. I don't care if you want to look at lowering coverage or adding your sisters girlfriend's baby's uncle. Fist compare apples to apples, then make one apple cider.   Third- make sure they run reports. Hopefully you won't have a major change, but it typically adjusts after pulling everything.   Finally, your question about splitting. Is it possible? Yes. My dad co-signed my loan for me, making us both on the title (as AND not OR). Since I lived in Houston and him in The Woodlands, I was able to have the insurance in my name with him an interested party. In other words, anything that would be paid to me would be paid to both of us. However, the loan held primary but I digress. HOWEVER, most companies want all household residents on the insurance. They have access to the keys and the vehicle. That's called a ""risk"". That does not mean you can't have your own policy- they will just be named as drivers. It will most likely help you rate-wise. (And if they want you off their policy, they will need to prove you are covered in your own policy to be a non-rated risk). Keep in mind accidents follow the driver, so even if you were on your own and had an accident, it wouldn't impact them unless you were also rated on their policy.   Let me know if you have more questions!"

No, US insurance will not/can not drop you for having a procedure done in another country. Can a GP feel uncomfortable in treating you and fire you as a patient, yes, but this is why you find a GP in advance that won't.

The health insurance company will definitely try to get the WC policy to cover it but since you are exempt, I think they will be on the hook for it all.   Many business owners that have health insurance will exempt themselves and others try to use WC like it's a health insurance policy.  I come across business owners and employees that hurt themselves at home and try to file a WC claim on Monday morning.    But if you are a ""by-the-books"" kind of guy, then you could include yourself on the policy.  If you are injured at work, file a WC claim.  If you are injured at home, use the health insurance.    But many business owners would not file a claim on the WC if they were injured if they had health insurance.  It's kind of like filing a claim against yourself.

Insurance,36922j,partyhat,1 point,Sun May 17 14:12:21 2015 UTC,I would call both insurance's and find out how they cordinate with Other insurance. Sometimes if the primary has a Deductible When the Secondary recives the EOB from the primary and see that nothing was paid they will process it using the normal benefit in this case the oop has been met then its possible it would be coverred at 100%. What this means is that you would get the same benefit as just putting the baby on your insurance but the Primary insurance would also be applying what ever they dont pay to the Deductible. I would call both and find out how they coordinate then compare that with any increase in premiums since switching from individual coverage to Family for you husbands will in most cases increase premiums.

Are you starting a new job/company and that is available as a result of that? Our company allows for more lenient rules for returning to the country and I believe, on the exchange, changing states is considered a life event to boot. If it's a new company and you need to meet their lag, that trumps it, but it's worth asking them.  I think you kind of have to get coverage here. You're going to be in your seventh and eighth month of a pregnancy and you kind of have to have coverage in this scenario to avoid a potentially back breaking bill. I would recommend getting a broker.   Your situation does seem kind of made for short-term coverage. There are plans with a moderate price-tag without a huge deductible. I have no idea if you can find one with a national network (group coverage is my area), but if you can't, I do think you seriously reconsider traveling outside of the service area. Normally I'm fine with risk but that's a pretty big one to take unless you can find coverage to handle it, especially when deliveries often fall outside the scope of emergent and urgent care. Also be sure to check on the pre-existing condition issue. Icea_Tea is on point with the ACA, but it doesn't necessarily apply to grandfathered or short-term plans."

They might not even fill out a report at this stage, since it sounds like it's been a while.

Both driver's have a duty to look around them and be sure it is safe to back up, both driver's failed to do so in this case.   I am going to say take the 50/50 offer. Also, the other party's damage will be covered by your policy under liability. They may still try to fight that the other party is majority at fault, but I don't think they win.

If you're accepting the 50% off from the other carrier you should probably do this anyway as it makes problems go away before they happen.  IMHO you probably can't get 100% but you should be able to do better then 50%.  Note that depending how your policy is worded you may not have to have received any actual payment to trigger the rental car reimbursement provisions.

Insurance,368puc,JigJig,2,Sun May 17 06:40:51 2015 UTC,"WOT-  You have several different issues here.   I contacted and have left 5 voicemails over last week for Manager's office at the Avis rental location to get details whether the driver had purchased insurance or if she was the driver listed on car.   I'm guessing this may be information that they can or will disclose to you at this time.   The bigger problem is, the driver did major damage to a 2015 Charger (rental car she was driving) + 2015 Subaru Forester + bumper damage (front + rear) to 2015 Nissan Versa. I just don't see how the coverage will be sufficient to cover all the damages.   The Charger would be excluded from any liability claim. Liability insurance doesn't cover property that's in your care/custody/control. That's what physical damage coverages like collision insurance or collision damage waiver are for. So your concern is only with the cumulative total of the Subaru and the Versa. IL state minimum coverage, which is likely what applies to the rental car unless they purchased supplemental liability insurance (which is probably voided by the unauthorized driver anyway) is $15,000 for property damages.   In addition, will Avis take first bite out of coverage for their vehicle or the coverage amount is distributed evenly e.g. 15K coverage, shared 5K for each of the 3 cars damaged?   So no the Charger coverage doesn't come out of the $15k. Different insurers handle coverage limit cases differently depending on carrier and jurisdiction. IMHO the fairest way is proportional, meaning if your car has 40% of the total cumulative damage then you (or your insurer) gets 40% of the total available coverage. As far as applying that to your carrier's subrogation claim that means if that hypothetical 40% of their limit is enough to cover, say, 80% of what was paid out to you, then you might get 80% of your deductible back. Some carriers treat deductibles as first-in first-out so they may simply reimburse you the first $500 they get back.  I've seen carriers pay-out liability limits on a first-come/first-served basis as well. It just depends on the rules in any particular place.  I've also seen it paid out on a ""greatest social harm"" type basis where, say, one parked car has no collision coverage on it but yours does so they give the majority of the funds to the no-collision guy and your carrier pursues the at-fault party directly.   In the end the calculation is just the insurer for the other party asking the question: ""what not-enough-coverage solution here gives us the lowest chance of being sued by our own customer for mishandling the claim against them?"". That calculation is different depending on the situation.  All of the above is predicated of course on whether the liability coverage that came with the Charger when it was rented applies at all. Your basic question here would seem to be: ""Does liability coverage still apply to a rental car in Illinois in cases of negligent entrustment by the original renter?""  So if the answer to that question is ""No"" then your insurer will have to sue the underage (presumably adult?) driver directly for damages, or the original renter for negligent entrustment for giving them the car, or both.   If the answer is ""Yes"" then the only question is whether $15k in liability coverage is enough to cover the two damaged cars."
Insurance,368puc,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Sun May 17 13:52:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the great deal of information. GEICO just informed me that they will pay back my deductible first from any amount recovered. They just started the subrogation process today, still waiting on full police report. I am unsure in terms of the IL regulations about negligent enstrument, as my google search yielded only cases of privately owned vehicles.   Follow up hypothetical question: Let's hope the driver's parents/original renter has sufficient coverage - Can the loss of 'value' on my car also be claimed in addition to actual damages? I mean, now that the car will have a listed accident, the value of the car will be significantly compromised.  I'm hoping GEICO pursues the matter to full extent as I have yet to find out if there's any other structural damage besides just the body work."

Can you imagine causing a major accident where a friend or sibling is hurt - they would be so screwed!  Secondly, you're contributing to the pool of uninsured drivers out there that drive up costs for everyone.  Your policy start date & time may change from the initial verification that you printed out.  Now, you could try going to court with it, showing that you NOW have insurance, but they may require better documentation.

Insurance,36509z,QuestionableMangoes,2,Sat May 16 05:01:02 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping someone who works for AETNA can drop in to get for the plan specific information, but the general rules I'm familiar with would go as follows for you (based on where I work, it may vary for AETNA, so I do strongly recommend speaking with an employee there):  Most people I see schedule the appointment and then go for the precertification. It's easier to cancel it or determine next steps if you have a denied or partially denied prior authorization and it's often something you'll need some assistance from the medical professional on in terms of getting the preauthorization approved (it usually falls on the member's responsibility if it's OON but still). Considering the relatively new removal of the exclusion and the complexity of the medical requirements for approval of this kind of sensitive procedure, I'd recommend giving as much time as possible to sort it out, especially if it goes to an appeals process.  As for the order of it, I'd schedule the appointment first: considering the relative limitations of out-of-network coverage to begin with, you'll want that settled before going further. I'd also, in your spot, contact AETNA and determine exactly what their medical management department is going to want in this scenario as documentation to meet their requirements. If your surgeon is going to be Thai, you may also have to contend with the plan's requirements or restrictions on overseas elective surgery, so keep that in mind too. Once Aetna lets you know what you need, work with your medical professionals to get what is needed and any guidance on how to follow up from there.  The claim form really can't be filed until after the surgery occurs, but having as much of it ready as possible could make it easier later and give you an idea on cost expectations.  Best of luck!"
Insurance,36509z,TiedinHistory,2,Sat May 16 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! This is a great response - really helpful.   I intend on calling Aetnas member services/assistance number on Monday once the weekend is over, which will hopefully shed some light on the whole overseas elective surgery. On my plan's handbook it specifies that it allows overseas emergency surgery/services, but it doesn't specify about elective surgery. This is a question that probably depends on a lot of other factors, but if Aetna does initially deny the Thai surgeons, would it be possible to appeal based on the argument that Thai surgeons are a lot cheaper for Aetna, and otherwise better for me which seems like a win-win?"
Insurance,36509z,TiedinHistory,1 point,Sat May 16 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"You're welcome and I'm happy to help.  I would definitely check with them. My insurance company does allow for coverage for emergent services overseas but not elective. This may vary from company to company but you want to make sure of it.   The appeals thing does depend on a lot of other factors, but from my very limited experience with appeals, it's an uphill battle. Even if the cost for Aetna is cheaper than it would be in the states, they have obligations to their providers and insurance laws to follow, and if you knowingly go outside of the country and the rules on out-of-country surgery are clear-cut, it's a tough road to sled.  Also of note on OON Surgery costs, the savings argument may have less oomph than one might expect. An insurance company will reimburse on an OON surgery up to a specific rate (often related to a percentage of the Medicare rate or Fairhealth or some other third party's determination of a proper fee). So even if it is covered OON , they may only cover a portion of a portion (their share based on the rates they grant).  With something this important, it may end up being worth it to bypass the insurance entirely instead of compromising your choice of provider (especially in this field), but it's good that you're researching this side as well going in. It also may be worth exploring in-network options locally, even if the sticker cost is dramatically higher, to see how that would turn out. One other thing worth pursuing is a potential exception. Due to the specialized nature of this kind of procedure, if your area simply doesn't have options in-network for this kind of service, you may have a shot of getting an in-network exception for it. This is an ultra-long shot with a foreign doctor but still."
Insurance,3637uc,missnewreddit,4,Fri May 15 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"Doctors dont bill prenatal office visits with Aetna. Their contract with Aetna includes payment for routine prenatal visits embedded into the payment of the delivery claim.  invoices are usually not even created for routine scheduled visits, and if Aetna is billed for one they deny it as ""incidental"". The fact that they're processing and paying on these bills means that its not being billed as a routine prenatal visit. If Aetna is waiving your copay by reprocessing and denying the entire claim as well as collecting overpayment from the doctor then there's not much else Aetna can do. But if they are reprocessing your claim and paying the copay to the doctor then I guarantee you  this will come back and bite you in the ass. Unless your plan specifically says copays are waived for diagnostic tests at the doctors office then waiving the copay is processing the bill incorrectly.  I've seen the exact same situation a bajillion times when I worked at Aetna. the rep has the claim reprocessed and copay paid to the doctor, then some number of YEARS later a claims audit is done and they find claims that were paid that weren't supposed to be. They then get their money back from the doctor who then will go after the patient, likely to a collections agency.  I would call Aetna and verify with a supervisor that your past claims were processed correctly, and whether or not your new plan waives the copay for billed ultrasounds.   Tl;Dr: Your doctor can not be paid for services that are already being reimbursed per their contract. Either these ultrasounds are billed as non routine and you owe a copay per your plan, or your plan specifically waives copays for non routine ultrasounds done in the doctors office"
Insurance,3637uc,Waldoh,1 point,Fri May 15 21:06:15 2015 UTC,"I must have spoken with 50 different Aetna reps during my first pregnancy and they all assured me that it was covered on that plan. I'm sure my husband even spoke with a supervisor at some point because it was getting ridiculous.   With my new plan, that's not the case so I will have to pay my copay and advise my doctor to stop doing them. In fact I just found out I have to get my 20 week ultrasound preauthorized, which again wasn't the case with my first pregnancy."
Insurance,3637uc,Waldoh,2,Fri May 15 21:46:32 2015 UTC,"You and your husband could have talked every CSR employed by Aetna, none of which will have ever processed a claim, and 100% of which have been told since training day 1 that prenatal services including ultrasounds aren't supposed to cost the member anything. I would have to see your old plan summary or an eob to tell you for sure if those claims will come back to haunt you or not, just warning you as someone who has seen this exact issue as an employee of that company who went from calling people to tell them they have a thousand dollars worth of claims that were wrongfully paid and to expect a bill, to someone who actually did to reprocessing of these claims that were wrongfully changed by the CSR.   Also, your husband was unlikely to actually speak to a supervisor, as all requests for one are transferred to someone in the 'mentor queue', which is just another CSR who has been identified as someone who is good at handling pissed off people and doesn't mind not being paid any extra for taking those calls. If you keep asking for an actual supervisor you will eventually get a voicemail for someone who will call you back and is also likely just another person on the 'mentor queue' and not an actual supervisor. You have to be incredibly specific and state that you will wait on the line for the next available supervisor and not mentor to actually get to one.  Anyway, I'm off topic. Routine ultrasounds do not require preauthorizations, at Aetna I believe the policy that governed this used to be called R.A.D.S. Only experimental ultrasounds need to be authorized so that's another flag that someone is giving someone the wrong info. Your old and new plan are all coded into the same claims processing system so I promise you that there's a breakdown of communication or understanding going on that is completely unrelated to the plan change.  If you have a benefits summary of the new plan or an eob for one of the ultrasounds I can tell you with 100% accuracy what is going on. I usually hedge on the side of being wrong, but this is one of those cases where I am literally the best person to help due to personal experience"
Insurance,3637uc,Mdcastle,2,Fri May 15 22:44:50 2015 UTC,"There really is a disconnect at most health insurance companies. It's not some monolithic entity.  The people talking on the phone, the people processing claims, and the people making the rules are different departments that are probably in different buildings or even different cities. (Once a co-worker claims processor left her phone number with a provider, and from then on she kept getting direct calls about claims issues rather than filtering through customer service). There's different incentives too. Customer service wants to keep members happy up to and including bending the rules on claims processing, Claims wants to follow the rules to the letter because they don't have to talk to the person who's claim they rejected, and they get audited if they pay something that shouldn't. ""The rules"" are made by a whole lot of different departments, including but not limited to Sales, Marketing, Medical Review, and Legal. Both claims and service are scared of such people who work in real offices and wear suits.  There may be an audit too on why an ultrasound was done every visit, from my experience it doesn't seem to be the norm. It's possible these visits are being coded as non-routine and not part of a global maternity code, which will get the provider in deep doo-doo if they get audited."

I just want to be clear about my responsibility.   Now I don't remember what I said in my last response ... but with my current plan I'm told I need preauthorization for the 20 week ultrasound to determine if it's medically necessary. Aside from the in office ultrasound I had at my doctors office (quick look), I haven't had a single detailed ultrasound with this pregnancy. With my first, I had 3 (16 week, 20 week and a fetal echocardiogram which was a result of something being seen on the 20 week) which were all covered 100%. I just assumed that all of this would be standard again. That being said, I figured my level of cost responsibility would be different given its a different plan.

They have additional options (i.e. baggage insurance, cancellation insurance) that you can add but it will jack the price up a fair bit.

Insurance,3626qg,hurricant,4,Fri May 15 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"Do you also have comprehensive coverage?  Assume your deductible is $500.  Add up how much premium you're paying per month or per 6 months, however you want to think about it (collision premium + comp premium).  Ask yourself if it's worth that amount of premium to you to get a check for ~$3,000 (KBB minus your deductible) if your car was totalled.  Will you be able to buy a replacement car without that insurance check as a down payment?  Many people, myself included, choose to carry liability only on older cars.  But this isn't really an insurance question, it's a personal finance question."
Insurance,3626qg,forneusFQ,2,Fri May 15 14:55:45 2015 UTC,"My general rule of thumb:  0-7 Years - Full coverage is a must  7-12 years - Depends on the vehicle, price, coverage.  Maybe full coverage, maybe just comprehensive.  But to answer your question specifically you need to figure out your cost to insure minus the benefit gained.  If you're paying an additional $800 a year in insurance premium to pay for a $3500 - $500 deductible = $3000 vehicle that's only going down in value, would you rather have the additional $800 in your pocket at the end of the year or have the peace of mind that if you get into an accident that's your fault you'll get some cash out of the deal?  Only you can answer that question. 12 years and older - Full coverage and definitely collision isn't worth it.

As some of the other commenters here have said, you might keep comprehensive coverage because it's cheap. Plus comprehensive coverage pays for many of the types of losses that you really can't do anything about (deer hits, hail damage, tress falling on it, fire, flood, etc..). If you have comp and you're okay with beating yourself up over an accident that's your own fault where you'd have no coverage then the only scenario outside those where you could take a hit would be getting hit by an uninsured person (where you're not at fault but also have no physical damage coverage).  Other alternatives include comp plus some form of uninsured motorists coverage that covers property damage (sometimes this is part of UM coverage and sometimes it is called UMPD).  Another thing you could do is just keep collision and comp but make the deductibles very high. That way you're saving premium in exchange for absorbing some, but not all, of any loss."

Insurance,3626qg,tommiebooyy,3,Fri May 15 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"the kicker here is that as the car ages, collision gets cheaper and cheaper (usually). If you totaled it you'd be lucky if you got 4,000 from the insurance carrier. So, if I were in your shoes I'd drop collision but keep comprehensive, which is inexpensive. My opinion is once its under 5K value its not worth having collision, but everyone's situation is different...  Make sure before you pull the trigger that you have your insurance company/agent give you the official price. Don't just look at your policy and assume the cost listed for the collision coverage is the real cost. With some insurance companies you will get ""re-tiered"" if you don't have collision coverage which increases your base rates and then makes it worthless to remove collision in the first place."

You won't need to pay that deductible to both places, just choose one and then the other can re-submit the info to insurance again.  Personally, I'd probably pay the OBGYN first, that is the one you are going to have an on-going relationship with going forward and you want to make sure they are paid so that you can keep making appointments with them, you don't want them to cut you off while they're waiting for insurance paperwork to clear."
Insurance,363ifr,joeboo5150,2,Sun May 17 17:33:51 2015 UTC,"Im going to disagree with you, Talk to the Doctors office. You should not be paying the full amount of a Deductible before you get any services for Health insurance. When you have a Covered Service done your doctor should bill the insurance. Once the insurance has processed the claim they will tell you how much of the bill was processed towards the Deductible, followed by how much the full patient responsibilty is.  Here is an Example with easy Math.  Doctor sends in a 200$ claim to your insurance where you have a 1000$ deductible and 80/20 after.   They take the 200$ claim and say Based on the contract we have with this provider (you went in network right?) they have agreed to be paid 100$ for this service. We are applying 100$ towards your Deductible and that is the full aptient resp.  At this point your deductible will have 900$ left and you will have not gotten to use the 80/20 yet. Now that the insurance has processed the claim the doctor should send you a bill for that 100$. Lets say you had met 950$ of your Deductible before the same claim. The insurance would process 50$ of the 100$ allowed amount(contracted rate) to the Deductible then take 20% of the remaining 50$ = 10$ then add the 50$ from the deductible to get 60$ patient responsibilty.          YOU DO NOT GET TO CHOOSE WHERE THE INSURANCE APPLIES YOUR DEDUCTIBLE. If your insurance says it applied to lab work you need to pay the lab. If you pay the Doctor The Full amount of the Deductible you will have overpaid them by the amount that was supposed to go to the lab and have to get a refund which is much harder. Call your insurance company to find out how they processed the claims then call the Billing department of the doctors office so that they can recalculate the payments knowing that you are not going to be paying them the Deductible.   --Edit Sorry about the wall of text."

I'm thinking that it's in my best interest to get the deductible paid ASAP and if it's the lab work then so be it. Also my pyt agreement with them seems to be based on the fees I was quoted as a self pay without my in network discounts applied.   So my next appt with them is 6/1/15 I'm thinking I should go ahead and pay the lab bring evidence of my pyt to my Obgyn along with as much as I scrape up to pay the bal ($824) of visits prior to having ins and the new fee ($82.11) from my last visit and work out a new pyt plan with them. I know I won't have it all but I think if I can put a few hundred toward that they should be happy.   At least I hope so. Ty for your help.

Insurance,3624vk,forneusFQ,1 point,Sun May 17 16:41:33 2015 UTC,"So, I don't know if anyone on here has any experience with insurance in Germany.  If so, hopefully they can chime in.  In the USA, we have short term disability policies that are comparable to your income protection.  I might be wrong, but I don't think we have anything that's like your accident insurance, but we have similar injury schedules built into some of our workers comp laws (a given lump sum in the case of a certain type of injury or death).  It's a personal decision based on how likely you think it is that you'll suffer a serious injury or long-term illness.  I've never purchased any of these optional coverages because, like you, I'm young and I work in an office environment, so I think the chances of me being seriously injured or hospitalized for a long period of time are pretty low.  If you rock climb or skydive on the weekends, maybe give it some extra consideration."
Insurance,361b9b,peasncarrots20,5,Fri May 15 06:54:42 2015 UTC,"Obviously none of us can predict the future to see which companies are going to have rate increases and which ones won't.  If you don't like the process of switching companies, might I suggest seeing an independent agent.  An independent agent represents multiple companies, so they can shop the insurance for you to find the best fit for you.  If the company ends up with a rate hike in a few years, switching is a whole lot easier, and you keep the same agent relationship."
Insurance,361b9b,NYAgent112,3,Fri May 15 13:17:44 2015 UTC,"Some companies (such as Erie) now offer rate lock. Depending on your state, it might be available for you too. Rate lock allows a rate to be locked unless you make a vehicle, coverage, address, or driver change. Unfortunately, rates are on the rise and you should still shop it out."
Insurance,361b9b,gunjr,2,Fri May 15 11:29:20 2015 UTC,"It is not unheard of for a company to reduce rates in an area to grab market share, then increase them far above and beyond typical inflation after a year or two.  I've seen this done by American Family, American National, Farmers, and a couple other big ones.   As others have said, your best bet is to get an independent agent and have him check rates annually."
Insurance,361b9b,onewatt,1 point,Fri May 15 17:50:34 2015 UTC,"Sounds like what the State Farm agents around here have been saying.  Rates can increase or decrease over time.  Typically you won't see increases in consecutive terms, and I've never seen a company increase rates every twice a year for 3 years - but I'm sure it happens.  The best thing to do is find a local agent in the area who can give you some more quotes.  I personally recommend an independent agent who can quote you multiple companies and search for a great rate.  You can also try your local captives (SF, Allstate, Nationwide, Farmers) and just see what their quotes are."

Insurance,361b9b,V6F,1 point,Fri May 15 23:22:45 2015 UTC,how is your credit? That is now the biggest rating factor for car insurance.. Regardless rates go up every year even if all things remain equal. Very rarely does an insurance carrier take a rate decrease. So if I were you just shop it. Call a local independent broker that can do the legwork for you (he/she will shop multiple insurers)
Insurance,361b9b,tommiebooyy,3,Fri May 15 12:32:45 2015 UTC,the biggest rating factor for car insurance...   Got a source for that?
Insurance,361b9b,saivode,4,Fri May 15 12:48:01 2015 UTC,"yeah, me lol. Been a broker for 10+ years Examples- guy with bad ""IBS"" (insurance bureau score) and clean record pays more for car insurance than the guy with a good IBS and a DUI. (with most other factors being equal) I see it all the time. Insurance carriers figured out that bad credit means you are more likely to submit a claim. It doesn't necessarily mean you're more likely to get into an ACCIDENT, just that you are more likely to file a claim. I am assuming the reason for that is people with bad credit cannot afford to pay for minor damage out of pocket... EDIT- this is not the case with ALL insurance companies, but it is with many of them. Of course rating factors etc vary greatly from carrier to carrier..."
Insurance,361b9b,tommiebooyy,6,Fri May 15 13:00:24 2015 UTC,"I'll second this. For the average driver, no single factor affects prices as much as the credit (outside of an sr22 or something egregious.)"

Insurance,361b9b,whispen,1 point,Fri May 15 13:02:48 2015 UTC,There was a small study posted on this subreddit about how much bad credit increased your rate. I can't find it right now but IIRC it increased your rate anywhere from 30-110% depending on the state and insurance company. A few states have banned it while others limit the amount it can effect your rate.  I work in a poor area where most people have no credit or poor credit and can also confirm that poor people pay a lot more for insurance than middle class or rich people. Poor or no credit history and a lack of discounts make their rates insanely high.
Insurance,361b9b,dan_232,1 point,Fri May 15 13:15:25 2015 UTC,"some companies will treat ""no credit"" as a perfect credit score.  The only one I can think of off hand is american national."

Insurance,3605wh,inneedofadvice2933,7,Thu May 14 23:50:54 2015 UTC,u/flker is right. I will add that your dad is putting himself at risk here. In most cases you run into some coverage issues on your personal auto insurance policy when acting as a livery (taxi). If your dad is at fault for an accident and causes damage to another party- there may not be any coverage under his car insurance. Does Lyft have a blanket commercial auto policy like Uber that covers its drivers?
Insurance,3605wh,tommiebooyy,4,Fri May 15 12:30:53 2015 UTC,From what I can see them having the same company doesn't matter much at all in this situation this is a good old fashion he said she said. This type of accident unless there is an impartial third party who is going to come forward and say they seen what happened. They aost never do BTW and unless its the first call a witness is mentioned one after the fact isn't really used either.  These type of accidents are pretty common and going 50/50 is the usual outcome.

Police rarely witness an accident first hand and one of the drivers is usually falsifying the truth...nothing new and nothing we don't see all the time.  The damage on both vehicles speaks for itself...location of the dent, paint transfer, etc.  Your Dad doesn't have anything to worry about.  The truth is in the damage."
Insurance,3605wh,flker,3,Fri May 15 04:55:02 2015 UTC,That is what I was thinking. I am not an adjuster and certainly not claiming OP or his father is lying. Perhaps he should check for cameras in area businesses. And quickly.

Each driver is saying the other got in their lane. The likely outcome is word vs word, each driver will have to pay their deductible and never see it recovered. If my insured was telling me the other driver got into his lane, in the absence of evidence such as an independent witness, I would deny the other drivers claim all day. The insurances can't pursue each other for damages because neither one can prove their version is the factual one.  Op, unfortunately there's nothing you can do about it. I have reviewed plenty of subrogation demands before arguing damages. Unless you can demonstrate that a dent or paint transfer or scratches can ONLY occur one way and not the other, you have no case."
Insurance,3605wh,f1shbone,1 point,Sat May 16 21:48:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's still word vs word as are most accidents without an independent witness.

Insurance,35zzmx,emptydiner,3,Fri May 15 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"I'm at a captive agency. Yes I'd like to stay in sales. And yes I'm behind a desk.

I think it's all about attitude so if you can keep it up, have fun with it, enjoy talking to people and trying to get to know them, then you can expect a good successful future.  I also came from the hospitality industry to insurance and I think it is a great transition and I'm still here after 10 years.  I know a lot of us could go on and on about what to expect, some of us are jaded, and some care-free.  You have a lot of options and many different routes you can take.

You can leave out the bit about Facebook posts about her spending her $100k. It's her money. It's not relevant.  I'd want to know the answers to these questions:   Is the insurer obligated to provide a copy of the policy and/or cancelled check to the beneficiaries of a payment? Can you prove the payment was sent to the step mom? Can you prove she cashed the check and not somebody else? Can the insurer be forced to pay the claim to the correct parties or is this a civil matter between the parties and a criminal matter between the state and you step mom?   I suspect you may need a lawyer to sort this out.   If it seems too expensive or not worth pursuing I suppose you can always look into turning her in to the IRS. Stolen money is still income and you still owe taxes on it. Sometimes just the threat of this can compel a resolution because they can make her life hell. Companies sometimes use this tactic against embezzlers to get their money back."
Insurance,35zydh,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Fri May 15 01:35:43 2015 UTC,Agreed with all. I'm pretty sure this isn't an insurance issue as long as the check has been cashed.
Insurance,35zydh,Whiskeybuck,1 point,Fri May 15 06:24:52 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions   I believe so.  Yes we can, the insurance company has records they sent it to HER address, even though they were instructed to send it to my sister.  Yes we can, bank records don't lie.  The insurance company was supposed to re-route the check to us but in the process of doing so, she cashed it. So i'm not sure the next steps.   The police contacted us today, they contacted my step mom where she instantly laywer carded. She then told them that the money was hers, the police told us her story did not match with the information they had. They have a copy of the cashed check and to my knowledge they understand that SHE signed my sisters name and cashed it. She then at one point from what I was told was asking if she could pay us the 15k and have no charges pressed against her, then she tried to claim it is a civil matter. But I don't believe fraud is a civil matter, when you falsely cash a check.  The police are getting down to the bottom of it and will contact us on monday, I just pray that we get our money without having to go to court. What can I expect if we have to escalate it?  How did the bank let her cash 15k anyways? Would the bank be at fault ?  Insurance company is still not complying with us, they still have not sent any documentation that we asked for but I believe they are complying with the police now (assuming so because the police have a copy of the check)"
Insurance,35zydh,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Fri May 15 21:43:40 2015 UTC,"My thought is what do you want more? Do you want your $15k or do you want charges pressed against her? I'd assume you want both but if everything could be resolved by her cutting a (valid) check to your sister for the $15k I'd call it a day.  I wanna say that if the police present this to a prosecutor with no admission of guilt by the step mom then they're looking at a whole trial and having to find handwriting experts and dealing with a whole he-said-she-said fight over $15k. $15k may sound like a lot but last time I checked the Federal Government wasn't prosecuting many embezzlement cases that were under $100k. They might not want to bother with it. They may call and say ""eh, we don't really have a viable case here"" and do nothing. Then you're left hiring an attorney and pursuing it in civil court.   On the flip side maybe she cuts your sister a check over the weekend and you call the detective Monday and advise that the ""misunderstanding"" has been resolved. Then they may flush the whole thing. ""We'll get back to you Monday"" sounds a bit like ""we'll let this dangle over the weekend to see if they can resolve it amongst themselves before we tell them adios on Monday"".   Or maybe they don't let it go. At that point it's up to the police to decide whether to pursue it or not."

You should seek advice from a lawyer, the sooner the better, legal action will most likely need to take place, because from the insurers side, the claim check was cashed and paid (fulfilling their contractual obligations), however the insurer should be able to provide information that can be used in solving this issue (what bank the check was cashed at, at a minimum).  Contact the bank and notify them what happened and see if they can remediate the situation.  (Seriously though, contact a lawyer)"

It is either on the bank for allowing your mother to cash such large check without ID, or completely  on your mother if she took steps to show your sister's ID and impersonate her.  I wish I could give you a better answer but unless the insurance  comapny made an error when they issued the check they won't be able to send you another one if the first has been cashed."
Insurance,35zydh,LASuperdome,3,Fri May 15 01:44:31 2015 UTC,The insurance company can request copies of the check stubs and they can forward them to /u/bronzeashe.  /u/bronzeashe can then give those check stubs to the police so they can give them to their handwriting analysts.  The check stubs will also show where the check was cashed.  if you get that info fast enough you might be able to get a surveillance video.

However if the claiment talks to me, let's me get an inspection on their car and I then find out the damage is in an area that confirms they had greater possession of the aisleway, then we just went from a partial payment for damages to me paying for most, if not all of the damage.  I understand your hesitation in injury situations, however from what OP was describing it sounded super minor. I don't think this sub should be trying to scare people away from those of us in the insurance business. We're not all bad people like we are made out to be! :)"
Insurance,35y0ur,newtobudgeting101,8,Thu May 14 13:42:20 2015 UTC,"Your homeowners policy should cover you just fine. It would take care of costs if someone damaged the house, and it takes care of your personal liability in case someone gets hurt on your property. If you're really concerned, call up the company you have your homeowners policy with and have them go over what your limits are."
Insurance,35y0ur,DiscordianAgent,9,Thu May 14 14:13:57 2015 UTC,"Your homeowners policy should also include host liquor liability, so even if someone causes damage after driving drunk after leaving your party, you're still covered (as long as you're not charging guests for the drinks).  If you have any outside companies coming in - caterers, servers, bartenders, etc - they should come with their own liability policy in place and it's not wrong of you to ask them to see proof of coverage."

Ask your agent about bumping that up to $500,00 or $1,000,000.  It's usually almost nothing in price difference.  For example, our homeowners policies default to $300,000, but $1million is only $9 more per year.  It's a no-brainer."

The limits on your HO policy will be enough to cover the neighbor kid breaking his ankle falling down the stairs or your cousin burning his hand on the boiling pot.   If you're worried about the deck scenario, you can probably increase your limits pretty cheaply or purchase a one-day event policy. Probably not necessary though."

Insurance,35y0ur,Yamuddah,1 point,Thu May 14 18:39:41 2015 UTC,I work in international insurance so I'm not sure if it's the same in the US but elsewhere you can purchase Event Insurance packages that provide Public Liability cover (in case someone gets hurt at the party) and also Indemnity cover in case someone sues you for some reason.  These packages only cover the days of the actual event so you don't need to purchase a full year's cover or anything like that.
Insurance,35z9q2,Kuonji,5,Thu May 14 19:35:37 2015 UTC,"First off, buy uninsured motorist coverage. That will cover your BI in a hit and run. If you want some states have UM Property Damage, which will also cover damage to your vehicle in a hit-and-run. Since you have a dashcam you'll have evidence that there actually was a hit-and-run and won't have to jump through all the hoops proving you didn't actually hit a post or some other fixed object.  Second, your insurance won't do anything for you unless you have collision coverage. Your insurance will take your deductible and fix your car and then go after the other driver if you have collision. If you don't have collision, it's up to you to run the plate and track them down yourself.  Third, you should still be able to recover on their policy unless they can prove that the driver of the car stole it. Auto insurance in the US follows the vehicle, not the driver. They will still be liable for your damages even if someone else was driving, though they may not be criminally liable.   Always call the police every time you are in an accident."
Insurance,35z9q2,aedmiston,2,Thu May 14 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"I have full coverage. I have uninsured motorist and collision/comprehensive. I don't think I have UM Property Damage.  Do I pay the deductible in the event of uninsured motorist? Obviously if their car isn't insured my company can't collect from them, so I guess yes? I would say they wouldn't be happy about paying on something they can't collect from, so do they have any interest in reporting the driver to the authorities (for being uninsured) or take any action in that case?  And if I call the police and say someone hit me and drove off, how much investigation will they really do? I had assumed that driving (and hitting someone!) without insurance was a huge deal, but I heard that it's really only a big deal if there are injures."
Insurance,35z9q2,forneusFQ,1 point,Thu May 14 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"There's no deductible for UM, but it only covers bodily injury.  Damage to your vehicle would be covered (also with no deductible) only if you also add UMPD (as previously mentioned, not offered in every state)."

Insurance,35z59t,LincolnStein,12,Thu May 14 19:00:51 2015 UTC,"The insurance company is not responsible for your body shop (guessing it was a shop of your choice?) holding your car for ransom until they receive their supplement payment. They had received initial payment which should show the shop the insurance company is willing to pay for the repairs. It is NOT normal for a shop to hold on to the supplement until ""the repairs are done.""  I would go after the shop. Depending on where you are there should be a BAR (Bureau of Automotive Repairs) that you can file a complaint with. Or you can threaten the shop with the complaint first to see if this gets them to budge.  In the future I highly recommend using a preferred shop from the insurance company because these kinds of things can be avoided.  The insurance company is only responsible for a rental car for the time it takes to actually fix the vehicle."
Insurance,35z59t,Kittyisnotaninja,3,Thu May 14 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"The actual statement in your policy will go something like this:  Our payment will be limited to that period of time reasonably required to repair or replace the ""your covered auto"" or the ""non-owned auto"".   Since the extra days were not required to complete repairs, they were incurred because the shop was waiting for payment, there's no coverage under the policy.  I'm sure your insurer told the shop they were going to pay on Wednesday, so it seems crazy to me that the shop would hold your car hostage until the payment cleared on Friday.  Did they think a check from an insurance company would bounce?"
Insurance,35z59t,forneusFQ,1 point,Thu May 14 20:14:35 2015 UTC,The shop said they don't give vehicles to the client until fully paid.

Insurance,35z59t,f1shbone,3,Thu May 14 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"Claims rep here. No. Shop needs to let us know ASAP about a supplement, so we can review it and get it approved and we need to be given a chance to inspect the vehicle before it gets repaired if we have to. Wanna know why? Because you as a shop need to make sure we're on the same page with the repairs. That's just good customer service. What if something on the estimate doesn't get approved because it's unrelated or prior damage? What if your supplement is for replacement and based on your photos it looks to be repairable, so I need to see the car again, but can't because it's already been repaired? Have fun having that conversation with the customer once the car is already repaired."

And i understand not releasing the car until paid if the owner's paying for the repairs, but in my experience, repair shops have generally trusted that my insurance will be paying and they go out of their way to make sure I'm happy with their service because they want my insurer to send more customers their way..."

Insurance,35zsg6,ludecknight,3,Thu May 14 21:57:20 2015 UTC,"Nothing to freak out about.  Some insurers will send somebody out to deal with injury claims in-person. I used to do this for a different insurer. I always felt it was easier to deal face to face than over the phone. Some carriers do this (particularly in areas where there is no local office) because the adjuster works out of their house so they are already nearby. It's possible that they want to discuss the circumstances of the accident (do a diagram and statement and all that) or ask what you know about the damage/injuries to the party(s) to those in the car in front of you.   So you can sit and talk if you like. They can tell you what they are and are not willing to do for you. They may have a claims release on them which you can sign to extinguish all your claim rights in exchange for some amount of money. You can sign it or not sign it. It's your choice. I probably settled about 30%-50% of the injury claims I handled on the first visit. Sometimes people just asked me to call them back every 30 days until they felt like signing off on it.    So if they offer you a settlement you have four choices:   Sign-off on it now Sign-off on it later Go get a lawyer Tell them you're not pursuing a claim   Things that you want to want to consider:   Understand what the time limit is to sue in your state (statute of limitations) for bodily injury. It is 2 years in many jurisdictions but it can be more or less than that. This means you tell them to call you back in 30 days or something if you're not ready to do something now. Assume any and all medical/hospital/ambulance/doctor bills paid by your health insurer, (and sometimes even medical bills paid by your car insurer), are owed back to those parties out of any settlement money you get, until you've been told otherwise by somebody who knows what they're talking about.   Also- it's entirely possible that you will be named as a co-defendant in any suit brought by person(s) in the car in front of yours against the guy who rear-ended your husband. If you ever end up with that paperwork don't freak out about it but do make sure you pass it on to your insurer so they can extract you from it. It's just the attorney for the person in front of you covering all their bases."
Insurance,35zsg6,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Thu May 14 23:30:57 2015 UTC,"Is there any paperwork we should bring with us to the meeting? I've kept all our receipts for anything dealing with the accident just in case and my husband's medical paperwork, including the doctors note to be off work."
Insurance,35zsg6,Zen_Drifter,3,Thu May 14 23:43:09 2015 UTC,"Anything that documents expenses that you incurred that were the result of the accident. Medical bills, lost wages, property damages, rental car fees, towing bills, etc..  Also sit and think about anything that might be missing from the medical bills. Nothing like settling and a $500 ambulance or radiology bill shows up in the mail a week later.  Medical bills are not always owed back to the providers but this varies by jurisdiction and even may vary by what your health insurance policy actually says. A California BI adjuster may be able to pipe-in here with more accurate info.  If you're uncertain I'd presume you can just do a settlement that separates your pain & suffering from the medicals. Basically ""we agree to pay you $XXXX plus all your accident related medical bills for treatment through XX/XX/2015"" or something like that."
Insurance,35zsg6,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Thu May 14 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, we paid cash for towing, so there's no receipt :( but there's no ambulance and the doctor only did a physical examination. We do have health insurance though, so it was covered except the prescriptions and co-payment.   How do you prove loss of wages? My husband spent two days out of work and his boss gave him extra hours for the week because she likes him.   Our car was totaled, so we had to get buy a new one, but our insurance already paid us the value of the car, minus our deductible and remaining loan balance. They also reimbursed our car seat, since that was in the car during the accident."
Insurance,35yfty,programunit1,2,Thu May 14 15:43:34 2015 UTC,"Probably not. From publication 969:    For HSA purposes, expenses incurred before you establish your HSA are not qualified medical expenses. State law determines when an HSA is established.   The expense was incurred when the medical service was provided. Most states consider your HSA as established either when you actually fund the account(i.e. your first paycheck of 2015) or at the beginning of the plan year(Jan 1, 2015). [edit: Mostly the former. You are definitely safe once your HSA is funded.]  However, if you live in Utah you can retroactively 'establish' your HSA back to the beginning of 2014 if you were eligible all year but didn't fund your HSA for whatever reason as long as you contributed to an HSA before filing your 2014 taxes. [edit: This is a pretty simplified explanation, and I honestly only have a basic understanding of how it works. So if you do live in Utah you should do a bit more digging before deciding that you are eligible.]"

I would suggest contacting her insurance company to open up a claim against her auto liability insurance.  That being said, if she has state minimum coverage ($10,000 for Property Damage in WA) there is likely not enough insurance money to go around for all the vehicles she damaged. If this is the case you may only be able to get partial payment from her insurer (so get that claim in ASAP) and you'll have to get the rest of your loss directly from her, which probably mean you'll have to sue her and get a judgement.

Explain to them that no police reported to the scene and now the at-fault driver refuses to give you her insurance info.  They may be able to give you her most recent insurance information through the DMV, and you can contact them directly.  If she goes through her insurance to get the repairs done, they may end up getting your contact info from her during the claims process since they'll know there was another vehicle involved, unless she lies about how the damage occurred."

Because I could see the adjuster hitting you with whatever liability they could. Even if only ten percent that's ten percent they don't have to pay (assuming a comparative negligence state). The fact that she admitted liability means absolutely nothing whatsoever."
Insurance,35yksf,aedmiston,3,Thu May 14 21:57:22 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to take her to small claims court. It costs nothing. You have her name and number, you can find her online.   You can pursue her for up to $5,000 and it costs $14-$29 to file for a court date. Yeah. $14-$29. That's it. And if you win, the court will make her reimburse you for that fee. You also don't need a lawyer for small claims court. So you have nothing to lose, and everything to gain.  All you have to provide the court with is her name, address, and if possible — phone number. You already have her name and phone number, so work on getting her address. Use Spokeo or Intellius if you can't find it from a regular google search. Nowadays, people's addresses are very easy to find via Whitepages and other online directories. Especially if she has an uncommon name. If you need help doing this, feel free to PM me. I still have a few Spokeo and Intellius lookups (I bought one months for myself recently since I had to track someone down as well).   Make sure you save any correspondence you have.

What would you have done if you were at fault you hit someone injuried them badly or worse killed someone? That poor person and family would have to try to make do with probably ly not enough to get by.

FTFY.  Your public adjuster represents you now so he/she is the person to direct this question to. You're paying them to do this for you. If they are competent then they already know every last way to squeeze money from a property claim.  Coming to an insurance sub to ask property adjusters how to help your public adjuster squeeze your carrier some more is going to get some ""interesting"" replies here."

Those guys will suck every last dime out of you, you are their paycheck and they don't really care what type of compensation you receive. Fist call should have been directly to the insurance company which obviously it's too late to do anything about that now. The recoverable depreciation is pretty standard. Since you went about this kind of backwards, there really isn't anything else you can do. They're not going to give you more than what it takes to repair the damages. If you've already cashed that 21,000 dollar check then that means you agree to the terms and have accepted that amount as your settlement. If you're really trying to save some money I suggest doing some of the labor yourself, or finding somebody that will do the work for less money. Other than that there really isn't anything you can do."

Insurance copies never cover wear and tear, if the roof need replacing they often won't pay for the roof to be replaced but the resulting water damage cause by leaking. And if it was cause by ice damming I don't even think they would consider including the roof in the settlement. Which actually frees up an editional 10k that should've gone to the home repairs. You even stated it was for walls ceiling and the cabinets.  Based off that it think its very unlikely that you will get anymore money out of them. I could be wrong but based off what your saying I don't think any of the settlement was intended for the roof whether or not it needed to be replaced because of its age."
Insurance,35xwvl,Phil_Achio,3,Thu May 14 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"You've already received good advice here to go talk to your P.A.   However, I do want to make one point - you will only get recoverable depreciation released back to you on COVERED damages. If you've used insurance proceeds to replace the roof (which sound like it was deteriorated, and not part of a covered claim) instead of doing something that was on your insurance company's estimate, you cannot claim that money back as part of the claim total to account for your depreciation.  EG: I pay you 10k out of 15k in damages from a covered water claim in your basement and hold back 5k. I deny the boiler as wear/tear as it failed due to age and caused the loss. You only spend $2k on the basement and $8k of that check on the new boiler. You only get the rec depr that was taken on the 2k you spent on the basement."

I want to give you a few more details about the Guaranteed Life that we have, in case you and your father choose that.  a.) your father has to complete the application (online, phone or mail) b.) Maximum death benefit is $25K c.) Your father has to be at least 50 years old to qualify. d.) as others have stated there are no medical questions asked on the application, but do not miss payments and allow it to lapse, as reinstatement may involve medical questions e.) as this agent stated, theres a 2 year period that the policy has to be in force before the full death benefit become available, should he unfortunately pass due to natural causes the beneficiary receives a return of premium plus 10% (accidental death is covered from the issue date). f.) The premium for this plan is higher than other whole life policies (since there are no medical questions on the application) but they remain level for the life of the policy, and you get a slight discount on the premium by paying on auto draft.

Second, I hate to be the bearer of even more bad news, but after a cancer diagnosis there's no way he will qualify for any kind of life insurance. Maybe if he beats it and is cancer free for a number of years, he might be able to qualify for sonething. But if he currently has cancer, he's uninsurable.   Yes, there are policies out there that you can get without testing. But they still ask medical questions. Abswering truthfully will disqualify him, and lying would constitute ""material misrepresentation"" and void any claim if/when he passes.   To all others reading this, this is EXACTLY why you have to buy life insurance before you need it. By the time you know you need it, you won't qualify."

There are guaranteed issue products with absolutely no health questions, hence the ""guaranteed issue"". The only difference with this product and a traditional final expense policy besides health questions versus no health question is the two year waiting period. Meaning the insured has to live for two years before they are eligible for the death benefit. If they die within the two years, they get back all of their premiums paid, plus an additional 10% each year.   The company and product I would recommend would be National Guardian Life's Guaranteed issue whole life product.   Your dad is still insurable, anybody is insurable."

The ones that don't will be very expensive. like 2 years in the policy and your premiums are greater than or equal to the face amount of the policy.

I once had an offer for a small life insurance policy from work that didn't require anything more than paying for it.  Other than that, the insurance company is pretty good at guessing how long someone will live, so if they do issue you a policy, it will probably not be in your best interest.  That said, it doesn't need to cost a ton of money to bury someone:  Do some shopping. There's a huge range in pricing and it can easily run anywhere from $2,000 - $12,000.  Also, cremation is very inexpensive if he's OK with it. At the end of the day, everybody who's buried ends up in a box in a hole, and all the ""extras"" they charge you for are forgotten. I've lost way too many friends and relatives, and nobody who matters, will care if you got the cheap burial or the expensive one.  Also, cancer isn't a death sentence. In many cases it's curable, and in others it's slow enough that it doesn't matter in an elderly person. Lots of people die from cancer, but lots of others don't."

Insurance companies have no interest in paying out a typical large sum if they are insuring a post cancer diagnosis.  It's also very important to know what kind of cancer it is. Taken care of insurance in a day won't happen in your situation until the insurance company know more details before taking on such a huge risk.

Insurance,35ug6u,whatheheckplzhelp,6,Wed May 13 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"I used to work for an agency that specialized in festival and event insurance and they had a program for vendors which was pretty inexpensive, but I don't remember the price exactly. The program gets the price down because technically you don't have a unique policy, your name is added to a master policy. You get the benefit of liability insurance and a certificate of insurance for the festival manager, but there is a slight risk because you are sharing a master limit with other vendors on the policy (usually the master limit, hidden to you, is very high: like $50M+).  This agency certainly wasn't the only one that wrote vendor liability policies. I googled a few others as well. Here are some links to check out.  http://www.eventinsurancenow.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=cContent.vendors https://www.vendorinsurenow.com/ https://www.theeventhelper.com/vendor-insurance http://www.steelbridgeins.com/association-event-program    Hopefully one of these works for you.

They should have actuaries that are determining their risk and seeking re-insurance if they are over their in house limit. I would hazard a guess that offering a policy they can't deliver on would be illegal.  If true I would never provide that as a viable option. Have a festival with a windstorm and kill ___ people.

The board or president or whomever needs to be able to act in emergency situations like this one.  That's my two cents.  With regards to the shadily obtained policy, unless I'm missing something, I don't see anything that you truly have to worry about.  If some stranger wants to pay for an insurance policy (if in fact one was actually purchased), let them.  If you ever receive a bill, at that point you can call whatever company issued it and tell them that you never requested this policy, and to cancel it flat.  Until then, I wouldn't worry about it.  Lastly, please get you own insurance policy for the association.  If a contractor, or employee, or any random person is hurt while on a common area, the association (and ultimately the unit owners) could be out major money.  Edit: Holy shit!

Insurance,35visq,minze,5,Thu May 14 12:26:04 2015 UTC,"The question is who was defrauded here.  Your association certainly wasn't since you're not out anything.  The insurance company might be, but only if there's a claim.  One of the lenders or sellers might be if they are out money based on this, but that's only assuming that coverage is not in force.  It is entirely possible you've gotten something for nothing.  Not likely, but possible.  That said, if you are so hellbent on following your own guidelines (and forgive me if I'm misunderstanding your attitude), my guess is that you're breaking them by not insuring the buildings.  If there is a fire or storm that damages them (up to and including their complete destruction), you and your neighbors will simply have lost your investment entirely.  Additionally, you and the other directors are potentially personally liable for this oversight or decision (whichever it is).  That's one of the liabilities of being on a board.  Assuming that you have Directors and Officers coverage (which I doubt but maybe I'm wrong), you probably voided your coverage since failure to procure proper insurance is typically excluded (I'm not an expert but that's what the experts tell me is usual).    As far as your next step, I'd call the insurance company show in the top right corner of the certificate and use the policy number to track down whether or not there's really coverage in your name.  Additionally, you can call the issuing agency listed in the lower left corner and find out what is going on.  If you cannot get answers from either, then call the Florida Department of Insurance and get them involved since there would most likely be some level of fraud going on - most likely on the agency side.  The insurance company would be the one being defrauded in that situation, not you.  It seems that you are an innocent (and potentially very lucky) party in that case."

Neither the buyers or sellers realty company has any motive to make sure you have the proper insurance.  all they care about is you having insurance that they can show the bank to get the approval to close on the property.    As an HOA, you need to have a Commercial General Liability Policy, Commercial Property Policy, Director & Officers, Umbrella, Workers comp and a Crime policy/bond.    As is stands now, not only is the association, the property, the directors and officers, but all of the unit-owners are all in jeopardy of having a catastrophic event exhaust any reserve you may have.    My professional opinion is two fold. One, find out who signed and issued this policy/certificate and hold them responsible and two, get in touch with an agent that has your best interest in mind when trying to find the correct policy for you.    You may also want to call a few property management companies and just talk to a few of them and tell them your situation.

Insurance,35u8m6,key2616,1 point,Thu May 14 12:46:05 2015 UTC,"That's not really true. A warranty is essentially an insurance product that utilizes the rule of large numbers to cap a buyers liability. Whether they are a good deal or not should be analyzed on a case by case basis.   Additionally, warranties help keep customers utilizing their maintenance services. Thus some warranties may actually break even on the pure financial costs but provide seller gains based on client introduction and retention on their real money maker (not selling cars, but rather providing maintenance)."

(In contrast to other carriers who divide their claims people up by specialties like home, auto, casualty, etc..). So they were all basically multi-line reps. It seemed like most of them were liability/injury adjusters and they didn't know a whole lot about cars or property claims so they just took the shop/contractor estimates and paid them without questioning much."

Considering the market is asking 7K and you are being offered 5,600- that is more than fair.. It sucks I know but that's how most car insurance policies work. Actual cash value is replacement cost minus depreciation. In this case- rep cost for your honda is 7K. Take off deprecation and you're left with 5,600.

Insurance,35vcad,tommiebooyy,3,Thu May 14 13:01:25 2015 UTC,Sounds about right to me. If you found more of the same year make model selling for 7k how many did you find and how far from you?  They look at your market not just anywhere an accord is sold. Also they are asking price for those 7k. I can ask 10k for a pack of gum doesn't mean that's what its going to sell for.  At this point thought the insurance company has done their research made their settlent. Got to remember more often than not its not really an offer so much as a settlement. They will look at other things to possibly change that value but unless its hard evidence saying that they are wrong or sufficient evidence by their requirements it stays at what it is.
Insurance,35vcad,Phil_Achio,3,Wed May 13 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"I just looked it up on NADA.com and it shows $4,650 clean trade and $6,925 clean retail, so you're about smack in the middle of that (if your current offer is a before tax number), which is about where I'd expect it to be if some random friend of mine called me and asked about the same situation.  Remember you're comparing an actual purchase price from an insurer against asking prices of sellers.  At this point they seem to be putting their foot down. Since this is presumably the other person's insurer they don't have any obligation to do anything else here. If you don't like what they're offering you can turn around and claim it with your own insurer to see if they give you a better deal or you can sue the other party in court.   If you sue then you'll need to bring whatever evidence you have and put it in front of a judge and convince them you're not getting a fair offer. Just remember that the offer they've already made to you may be taken off the table, so it's possible you wind up with less than they've already offered you.  Also, unless you're in a state with no sales or transaction taxes you're owed those on top of the insurer's offer.  Also, if you're not in a rental car, some states require loss of use expenses to be paid regardless of whether you've rented a car or not. Your local insurance department should be able to tell you if this is the case where you are.  If you really want to push things you can also claim that the gasoline in the tank is not part of the vehicle's attached equipment but in fact represents ""personal property"", the value of which of which you are being deprived of, and as such you should be compensated for it."

Usually telling them where in their policy they had to abide my ""reasonable requests"" did the trick). If it was not the person I insured, if they refused to give me a statement then I'd just point out that I would then be forced to base my decision on the information I had on hand, which may not be to their benefit.

Insurance,35udg8,rezilient,2,Wed May 13 16:15:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see where it would make that big of a difference, especially if you have some pictures of what it looked like before the ""repair"" by Mr. Shady. They may not pay to have the overspray on undamaged adjacent panels removed.   Without photos it's possible that they may deny the claim under ""defects in materials or workmanship"".  It largely depends on whether they can differentiate between the original damage and the ""repair"". If the bumper had a large crack it's likely they would have paid to replace it anyway. The rear cover is a $267 part on that car. IIRC the tailgate on a Leaf is aluminum.  I have a Leaf myself but my wife has it at work at the moment. You can check yours with a refrigerator magnet. A magnet will not stick to aluminum. Touch it to an area near the top (not the plastic spoiler)  where you know where was no body work done to it. If the magnet sticks it's steel. If not then it's aluminum. Aluminum is harder to repair than steel so the likelihood that the tailgate would have needed replacement is higher with aluminum than with the same size dent in steel.  So, if I'm looking at your car as an appraiser and the existing trunk lid looks properly fixable, then I pay to fix it correctly, assuming that I can tell that I would be paying that amount regardless of whether the first repair attempt had ever happened or not.  If the bumper cover warranted replacement and it has some sort of half-assed repair that's not going to hold up I'd still pay to replace it.  The overspray is on you, though in most cases a skilled detailer can take it off in a matter of minutes or an hour or two.  There's another similar post to thise here or in /r/cars today where somebody pushed out their own dent with a broom handle or something. The bottom line is that as long as you didn't make it any harder to fix than the way it was before the accident then it doesn't matter. If you did make it harder to fix then it's still covered, just only up to the amount it would have cost to fix it properly."

Defective repair isn't generally the type of thing you can claim against your policy anyway.   I'd just tell them it got damaged, you tried to have it repaired on the cheap but you didn't like the way it turned out, and you'd like compensation for the original damage.  Even if you did like the way it turned out you'd still be able to make a claim. There's a provision (condition) in just about every insurance policy that says the insurer is entitled to look at the damages but this can be overcome with photos or other evidence of the loss. You may just run into them saying ""this is all we can tell from these pictures"" if there is a dispute about the amount though."

Insurance,35sh5b,strickzilla,1 point,Wed May 13 08:33:08 2015 UTC,"Transportation network company:       A transportation network company (TNC) is a company that uses an online-enabled platform to connect passengers with drivers using their personal, non-commercial, vehicles.  Examples include Lyft, Uber X, Sidecar, Wingz, Summon, and Haxi.    These platforms have sometimes been called ""ridesharing"", but transportation experts prefer the term ""ridesourcing"" to clarify that drivers do not share a destination with their passengers.  (The term means the outsourcing of rides.) Unlike ridesharing, TNCs do not reduce vehicle trips, traffic congestion, and automobile emissions.  The definition of a TNC was created by the California Public Utilities Commission in 2013, as a result of a rulemaking process around new and previously unregulated forms of transportation. Prior to the definition, the commission had attempted to group TNC services in the same category as limousines.  Taxi industry groups opposed the creation of the new category, arguing that TNCs are taking away their business as illegal taxicab operations.

Insurance,35sh5b,northofindy,1 point,Wed May 13 16:30:20 2015 UTC,There are three periods of coverage when you are driving for Lyft/UBER.  Period 1- The moment you turn on the app Period 2- You are picked and are driving to pick up your client Period 3- Taking your client to their destination.  Uber (and I assume Lyft) provide coverage for period 2 and period 3.  Your personal coverage covers you for the rest of the time.  The point you need to address is period 1 as you will not have any coverage then from anyone.    Farmers Insurance is starting to offer an endorsement that you can purchase that will cover you for period 1 on the 05/28/2015.  If you are in CA you will also need to carry limits of at least 50/100/50 effective 7/1/15.
Insurance,35rwwf,OmegaLiar,7,Wed May 13 00:23:09 2015 UTC,"General rules because every state/policy is different:  If you were driving the car with their permission and you were not an excluded driver under their policy then you are probably an insured under their policy. There are exceptions to this, (for example one carrier in my state has a policy exclusion that totally excludes coverage for any driver that has their own other insurance), but as a general rule that's how it works. As such they probably cannot make a liability claim against you for the physical damages because they'd functionally be making a claim against themselves, which they cannot do.  So if you're an insured, and not excluded from coverage for another reason, and they have collision insurance, then you have to choose between $2,000 of your money and their friendship.   Their liability insurance pays for damages to the other car.  Your liability insurance, if their's is exhausted or does not apply to you, pays for the damages to the other car.  Neither their liability insurance, nor likely yours, will pay for damages to a vehicle in your care/custody/control. Only collision coverage pays for that.   Your collision coverage is likely excess to theirs, meaning theirs goes first if, as above, you're a not-excluded & permissive user.  Their rates may or may not go up. Too many factors for anybody here to know.  Your rates may or may not go up. Too many factors for anybody here to know."
Insurance,35rwwf,Zen_Drifter,2,Wed May 13 01:23:23 2015 UTC,Should I get in contact with my own insurance then to inquire about what would happen (likely in the form of a hypothetical)?  What are general factors that lead to rate increases?  Do rates only increase when costs of repair exceed predetermined coverage limits?  I really appreciate your input. It's definitely cleared up. A lot of things for me.
Insurance,35rwwf,Zen_Drifter,3,Wed May 13 02:05:59 2015 UTC,I wouldn't bother calling my own insurance for something like this unless their carrier claims you have no coverage for some reason. It's not unheard of but it's quite unusual for your collision coverage on your car to apply to another person's car (except in the case of rental cars which happens all the time).  I'm in claims. The agents and underwriters here can probably comment more accurately about the factors that lead to rate increases but I'd presume foremost is claim & driving history. The size of an individual claim may make a difference in some cases. Also whether the type of claim is something you have control over (collision) vs something you don't (hail damage).
Insurance,35rwwf,captainjoel,2,Wed May 13 02:20:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. I won't bother then. It sounds like I will be paying it straight up at a majority rate. Something like 75% because I can work it out with the owners.
Insurance,35rwwf,britt5689,3,Wed May 13 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"Something you may want to consider as well is that although people may have said that there were no injuries or damage to the vehicle, the other driver may still wish to make a claim and he may contact your friends insurance to get their vehicle repaired or to open a claim for bodily injury.  If there is already a claim open and your friend has collision coverage he may as well repair through his insurance company as there will already be an at fault accident on their policy."

Trying to get term insurance is going to be expensive as hell. What if, God forbid, you were diagnosed with something while working and now that you're out of a job? Getting coverage would be a hassle to say the least.   I had a small policy via USAA after I got married. It was only about 50k. My wife was still young and pretty, so I wasn't going to pay for her second honeymoon. And we didn't really have many expenses.   Once she got pregnant, however, I bumped that up quite a bit.

Insurance,35royy,thelurkerabides,2,Wed May 13 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"Really, the only thing you can do is shop around. Ask friends and family members the name of the agent. If the agent is good, they'll tell you.   Get a copy of your current policy and take it to him or her. Ask them to review your current policy and explain all your coverage options. Make an informed decision on your coverages. Then ask that agent for a quote.  If the price is reasonable, purchase the policy. If it seems high, take the quote to a few other agents. An independent agent represents multiple companies but not some of the best so talk to some of the major companies as well.  Make sure you get an honest ""apples to apples"" quote. Make sure they run all applicable reports before giving you the final price. Maybe you'll find the first agents price wasn't too high and the level of service he'll provide is worth the cost. If not, do a quick search on the claims satisfaction of the less expensive carriers and the agencies that are representing them.   With all this information choose the quote that best fits your personal ""cost to service"" matrix.  When it comes to coverage, don't pinch pennies too much now because you may regret it in the future. And don't undervalue service. A good agent representing a solid company will be a huge asset if/when you have a claim"

Insurance,35royy,thelurkerabides,1 point,Wed May 13 02:47:12 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you favoring yourself or captives, but Texas has one important distinction from most of the rest of the country:  There are schmucks who sell insurance that's not worth a damn to people who can't afford anything else.  Avoid any agent who sells e.g., Fred Loya.  If it doesn't have an AM Best rating, run like hell.  Even The General is rated, so if someone is trying to sell you a carrier who isn't, you need to run.  For what it's worth, The General is reasonably well rated (A-) but there are anecdotal reports their claims service is questionable.  My experience has been otherwise, insureds report that their legitimate claims are handled with a minimum of fuss.  Worst thing  I ever had to deal with was an insured who had a disagreement with them over how many days of towing and storage they'd pay for.  That's not a terrible experience for a non-standard carrier.  Primarily, just make sure you research and know your state insurance laws before you make a decision.  If you can't or don't care to learn then, find an awesome independent agent."

I like how the article makes these companies sound generous like they are trying to keep things equitable, while in practice, rather than paying the lowest earners a higher livable wage in order to keep the health costs to earnings ratios bearable, companies are now selecting the barest of plans that meet ACA requirements and contributing less for workers that dare to rise above poverty level.  Aren't government subsidies designed to specifically address the concerns the article describes?  Are there regulations regarding how tiered income contribution schemes can be designed?"

Insurance,35pls9,tz67,9,Tue May 12 13:54:57 2015 UTC,"insurance is a contract. Sounds like your son purchased a sub-par homeowner's policy, for whatever reason. Adjusters usually follow the policy contract. If the policy is on ACV basis, well you're kinda SOL. I would pull a copy of the ENTIRE policy, and read it. 9 out of 10 times you're wasting money with a lawyer, especially for a property claim such as this. instead try a ""public adjuster"" first...."

Insurance,35pls9,emptydiner,3,Tue May 12 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"ACV is based on depreciation.  Something brand new hasn't depreciated much.  Depending on the premium difference and the financial standing of the insured, ACV may be the better way to go.  I never quote anything ACV and only offer it when the premium is a factor for the insured."
Insurance,35pls9,Podunk14,2,Tue May 12 18:26:08 2015 UTC,"The difference in premium from RC to Act for ""brand new"" property would be negligible or at least it should be. However, it could be extremely detrimental to an insured if it's a hard to get item after a disaster.   A fast example would be someone who bought a hard to reproduce machine for $1 million. A loss happens 6 months later and maybe it's only worth $750k for whatever reason. So now the insured saved a couple bucks but really screwed themselves because they have to come up with the $250k difference between replacing and the acv."
Insurance,35pls9,emptydiner,2,Tue May 12 18:36:39 2015 UTC,"It makes a bigger difference on homeowners personal property, RC can be up to 40% of the premium in my area.

Insurance companies will issue this payment in good faith so as not to delay the repairs."
Insurance,35qorq,watusa,3,Tue May 12 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"I think I understand what youre getting at. You have your normal home insurance policy that has different coverages: dwelling, separate structures, personal property, liability, and medical. Each of these coverages have their own limits that can be restricted and endorsed for more or less coverage. So, in a normal insurance policy (at least in Illinois, my state) policies do not cover earthquake insurance. So, if you want coverage for that you add an earthquake endorsement. This extends the coverages of the policy to cover earthquakes and has its own deductible. Lowest my policies will go is 10%. So, if an earthquake were to happen all of the policy features such as dwelling and personal property would pay out in accordance to the endorsement and it's 10% deductible. To show you what I mean say you have a house insured at 100k, and have an earthquake and it takes everything out and you have a 10% deductible. You would be responsible for 10k of the loss. For flood, they completely separate policy because it is government regulated. You can get coverage for just the dwelling itself or for personal property and the dwelling. For the depreciation issue, depending on your policy and the provisions of it, you may only be eligible for the depreciation of the item or you may be able to recover that deprecation in a full replacement policy. For instance with my company say you had a fire and your roof was destroyed going to cost 5k to fix, the deprecation on the roof is about 1k. We will pay the 4k taking in account for deprecation and once you prove you have replaced the roof, you will get the 1k of deprecation back. This is called recoverable deprecation."
Insurance,35qorq,kfyoung,1 point,Tue May 12 19:45:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! Some of these terms are new to me but it helps me be a little more educated for when I go in and speak to an agent. :)
Insurance,35qorq,NYAgent112,2,Wed May 13 14:13:59 2015 UTC,"First, you need a homeowners policy.  That will cover your house and its contents in case of a fire, windstorm, and many other perils.  If you get a replacement cost policy (which you should), no depreciation will be deducted.   Earthquake is different and is usually not covered on a homeowners policy.  In order for your house to be covered for earthquake, you need a separate earthquake policy.  If you take the policy, you will have two insurance policies, but they will never both pay out because they cover different things.  I won't opine on whether it's worth having from my office on the other side of the country.  You should speak to your local agent about that.   (PS I don't know who your boss is, but you should not be taking insurance advice from someone who is not licensed. Speak to an expert.)"
Insurance,35qorq,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Tue May 12 19:41:16 2015 UTC,Thanks!  His dad is a life insurance guy so I think in his mind he is an expert.  :)  That clarified a lot of my questions.  Thanks for your help.
Insurance,35qorq,Zen_Drifter,2,Tue May 12 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question about whether insurance coverage is ""worth it"" is a cost/value proposition. It just depends on how likely you think an earthquake is (more appropriate for a geology subreddit) and how much the insurance costs against your ability to absorb such a hit.  Earthquake coverage is handled differently in different states.   In some places you buy an actual ""Earthquake policy"" that is separate from your homeowners insurance. It has different terms and provisions and a different deductible. The deductible may be a certain % of the insured value of the property (not the amount of the loss) like 10%, 15% or 20%. This affects the premium.  In other places you may be able to purchase an ""earthquake endorsement"" that more-or-less just removes ""earthquake"" from the list of things that are not covered by your insurance. Basically deleting it from the exclusions section of the policy.   Aside from understanding the deductible and premium issues you should also look over how it covers what it covers. Earthquake policies can have a clause that references ""functionally equivalent construction"". So for example when your granite countertops shatter in an earthquake the insurer may not be obligated only to replace them with a ""countertop"", as in Formica, not necessarily granite. Or when your brick chimney falls over they're obligated to go back with nothing more than cinderblock or whatever is functional.  Beyond that it's ""how bad do I want to pay $XXX a year for this coverage that I may never need or that may not pay out a whole lot even if I need it?"". It's just personal preference."

Our house currently will have no upgrades but later down the road we plan on upgrading here and there, so it's good to know there might need to be more research done by me at that time to make sure I am getting everything we want replaced covered properly."
Insurance,35qorq,britt5689,1 point,Wed May 13 14:15:59 2015 UTC,I'm paying something like $140/yr for an earthquake endorsement on a $150k house in Cincinnati.   I was close to dropping it a year or so ago and then was sitting at my desk when the whole house started gently shaking from a small earthquake in West Virginia. I decided maybe I want to keep it after that.
Insurance,35qorq,forneusFQ,3,Wed May 13 14:31:44 2015 UTC,You want a total replacement cost policy with an earthquake endorsement. It's all on one policy. I'm kind of confused as to what your question is but hopefully my answer helps a bit.
Insurance,35qorq,britt5689,1 point,Tue May 12 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry I wasn't very clear.  I want to know what policy I should get on my new home (once it's built) so if there is an earthquake, fire, flood, etc. I can get my house rebuilt without having a ton of out-of-pocket expense.  I've heard during floods and things insurance won't pay for new carpet but will just write you a check for what they think it's worth at a depreciated value, which means you may still have to pay for most of it?  I think your answer helped me know the direction I am supposed to look for proper coverage, though."
Insurance,35qorq,forneusFQ,2,Tue May 12 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"You don't want an actual cash value policy, you want a full replacement cost policy. Flood policies are separate and are only necessary if you're in a flood plain."

Insurance,35q2in,NYAgent112,5,Tue May 12 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"To repeat what the other guys have said, insurance needs are highly individual.  You can't simplify it to just age and salary.

Insurance,35q2in,key2616,2,Tue May 12 16:54:10 2015 UTC,"To add on to what /u/NYAgent112 said, there's no such animal as the online questionnaire you seek, and I doubt that one could be designed in a way that would spit back reliable answers.  If you have specific questions about the differences in coverages, we're happy to help, but there no way to really ""benchmark"" (which is the term used on the commercial side for what you're after, but it's only used for larger companies) you or your exposures.  Insurance is a highly personal financial decision that uses a lot of variables, not the least of which is your own appetite for what you want to self-insured (e.g. not buy any insurance to cover at all) and what you want purchase."

You can be training bears to fire rocket launchers and there will be an insurance company that will cover you (the real question is, how much will they charge you for coverage).  As for proper levels. This is highly dependent on  you individual situation, where you are located, what type of insurance you are looking for, etc.  You will not find an easy reference guide for this. Your best bet is to talk to someone in the business, but again, it will vary depending on what you are looking to insure."

Insurance,35r2pc,Ciaobella17,5,Tue May 12 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Before filing a grievance, see if you can work this out. It sounds like there were two authorizations - one for the initial stay, and one for the additional 15 days. What you need to do is first off, verify that you're active with both carriers for the entire length if your stay. Do this by calling the carriers, not the provider.   Secondly, verify that both authorizations were made, and not retracted for any reason.   Lastly, assuming both services were authorized by both carriers, verify that the 10 grand you owe is because the authorizations were denied, like you're saying, and then take it from there. If the services were actually authorized, your carriers just need to reprocess.   However - what this kind of sounds like to me is an additional balance that you owe. A 28 day stay at an inpatient facility is VERY expensive. 10 grand is on the very low side in terms of what a carrier would get billed for this kind of service. The claims I've seen are usually closer to 80 or 90 thousand dollars.   To verify this, get copies of the EOB from both carriers and cross check it with the bill you're getting. Also, a good customer service rep with either carrier should be able to break down where the $10,000 is coming from. Good luck!"
Insurance,35r2pc,pomdecouer,1 point,Tue May 12 21:24:13 2015 UTC,"It would also be beneficial to have both insurance reps verify that their claims match the authorization (procedures, diagnoses, auth no., etc.). I so frequently see claims deny because the claim and authorization don't match."

If you're really concerned, there are a number of 2-4 day exam prep courses in the $300-$500 range.  The 2 day courses could even be on a Saturday and Sunday so you don't even have to take a day off work.  My coworker had no insurance experience and passed after going through one of these classes.  We're in Dallas, but I'm sure there are similar courses out there.  Fun fact - TX has a database of thousands of questions and generates a random set of ~200 questions for each test.  So my coworker and I took the exam at the same time and had completely different questions.  So this is really vague advice, but learn everything in the course guide because it's totally random what questions you'll get.  Also, the results of randomizing sometimes don't seem that random, so you could get hammered on one particular topic - like in my case where about 80% of my questions were on workers comp and I got maybe 2 questions about auto insurance..."

If you want a personal umbrella policy, you'll probably want all underlying policies to be on A-rated paper.  But anyway A and A+ are both excellent.  If you're curious, the VII after the A- refers to the company's net worth on a scale of I-XV.  A- is the financial strength, VII is the financial size.

From an insurance perspective, ALL of those elements put together qualify you in one of the most expensive brackets, based on statistics. You're seen as a very high risk driver. Out of those factors that I outlined, the only one that is within your span of control is the kind of car you drive and insure. Unfortunately you've already made a purchasing decision, so the only thing you can do right now to get better rates, is to own a different car. It won't matter much where you shop, everywhere will be expensive. You may not be a high risk driver yourself, but you're guilty by association unfortunately (demographics)."

Insurance,35lr20,mail323,2,Mon May 11 20:20:46 2015 UTC,They will. Part of it is due to the cost of parts. My first car was a Pontiac Sunfire GT. My muffler needed to be replaced and I talked to 5 different mechanics. Replacing the muffler was going to cost $900 (the car was 10 years old at the time). Every mechanic I spoke to said if I had the 4-door model the muffler would have only cost $300.

Insurance,35lr20,mail323,1 point,Tue May 19 19:28:12 2015 UTC,"They will because of demographics. People that buy two-door vehicles buy them for the sporty aspect and they tend to have more accidents, and therefore are a higher risk. Crash ratings is one thing, insurance is looking at the liability exposure you represent. So it's one thing to hurt yourself and damage your car, the bigger problem is when you damage others."
Insurance,35lr20,f1shbone,3,Tue May 12 15:26:58 2015 UTC,"If your grandfather cosigned with you, you maybe able get a policy in his name with you listed as a driver.

This right here. Based off all of the information you have provided you have a lot of things counting against you when it comes to rates.  The best thing you can do right now is shop around and to make sure you have all the possible discounts included. Are you a student? Do you qualify for a good student discount? Low mileage? maybe an occupation discount?  Honestly, if you shop around and the prices are coming in that high then it means that is the market rate for you. You will either have to suck it up and pay the cost until the price goes down (and you can shop around on the renewal to check market pricing again) or you'll have to get a different car."
Insurance,35lr20,Cicatrized,2,Mon May 11 15:29:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured as much. A few follow-up questions if you don't mind. The car has 24K miles, does that normally fall in the range of ""low-milage discount""? I work as a 911 dispatcher, do companies usually have discounts for something like that (law enforcement/county employed)? And also, when do rates usually start to fall? Is it a gradual decline or does it usually just drop instantly once hitting a certain age?"
Insurance,35lr20,Cicatrized,3,Mon May 11 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"The low mileage discount would depend on your use. For example someone who uses the vehicle for 8,000 km/year (yeah, I'm from Canada) would qualify for low mileage whereas someone who uses it for 20,000 km/year would not. This is something you can discuss with your agent and see if you can get a low mileage discount.  Occupation discounts will vary from one carrier to the next, you can ask your agent if you would qualify based off you occupation.  As far as pricing, because of your age the the fact that you are still considered a new driver you are paying higher than the average rate. If you do not have any claims you should see a small decline with each renewal.   You will get a larger discount when you are no longer considered a new driver (usually after you have been driving for 6 years) and when you turn 25."
Insurance,35lr20,britt5689,3,Mon May 11 15:44:39 2015 UTC,"The low mileage discount isn't for how many miles are on the car, it's for how many miles per day you drive on average. The average person drives 12-15K a year. Your rates should go down after your first renewal as long as you don't file any claims, have any accidents, or get any tickets. It will also go down once you get married, or turn 26, whichever comes first."
Insurance,35lr20,gunjr,3,Mon May 11 17:53:13 2015 UTC,"Everyone on this sub will tell you to shop it out, so, shop it out. Keep in mind that you are looked at as a youthful operator due to age and will pay higher than average rates due to your age bracket being known to file claims. Here is what I advise: carry BI limits of 100/300/100 and unstacked UM/UIM coverages. Ask your agent to explain and quote the difference between limited vs. full tort. Make a decision on what option your prefer (limited or full). Carry minimum deductibles of $500 and don't submit any claims unless they are large losses."
Insurance,35lr20,chris41658,2,Mon May 11 15:31:17 2015 UTC,"The only thing I would add to this is to check the difference in cost between $500 deductibles and $1,000 as there can be a significant difference between the two (especially for the collision deductible)."
Insurance,35lr20,Phil_Achio,6,Mon May 11 16:20:41 2015 UTC,But keep in mind that if at any given time you can't afford a $1000 deductible do not get one that high. This is something often over looked just because it saves you money doesn't mean you should take it.

Typically the more payments you split your premium into, the more you end up paying.  Rather than pay every month for 6 months, if you can afford to go to a 4-pay, 2-pay, or even pay in full at policy inception, you might see your premium reduced by something approaching 10%.  A number of companies will also give discounts for going paperless and/or for setting up automatic bill pay.

Insurance,35lidz,f1shbone,4,Mon May 11 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely they do. Almost every major company I represent removes your claims free discount after a comp claim.

Insurance,35lidz,britt5689,5,Mon May 11 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"So, Nationwide, for example, which advertises this as a Safe Driver discount, will remove it upon this sort of incident? Sounds to me like a recipe for good rates of lapse/can policies. For the insurance companies you represent, if you can give some examples of names, how do they advertise this discount? What is the intent behind this discount? Let's look at some concrete examples and read what the discount is for."
Insurance,35lidz,f1shbone,5,Mon May 11 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"Allstate for example, runs TONS of ads about that ridiculous safe driving bonus check. However, that is an endorsement on the policy that you pay extra for, you're literally paying extra money to receive a check. It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen but people are in love with the idea of it. Progressive offers a 5 year accident free discount. So even if you file a comp claim for a broken windshield, or hitting a deer, those aren't counted as ""accidents"" so you retain your accident free discount, but lose your claims free discount. Hopefully that clarifies things a bit. This may also be different in different states, but this is how it works here in Ohio."
Insurance,35lidz,britt5689,2,Mon May 11 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"So you are not talking about accident free, but claims free discount. You could still retain your accident free discount while losing on some sort of claims free discount. Where can I read about this discount?"
Insurance,35lidz,f1shbone,3,Mon May 11 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly, if you file a comp claim you will lose your claim free discount, but keep your accident free discount because comp claims aren't considered accidents. I've hit 6 deer in the last 12 years (only filed claims on 2) and kept my accident free discount but lost my claims free discount."
Insurance,35lidz,britt5689,2,Mon May 11 18:08:29 2015 UTC,"At random, I looked at Allstate. They qualify theirs under the Safe Driver discount. You are saying Allstate will void this accident free discount following a comp claim with no negligence on behalf of the policyholder, and this applies across the board with all carriers you represent that qualify the accident free discount similarly. Is this correct?"
Insurance,35lidz,f1shbone,4,Mon May 11 18:00:10 2015 UTC,"would they both affect your premiums the same going forward?   Nope. They would be rated differently.

Medical Payments pays out regardless of who is at fault. It may not be necessary if you have a low max out of pocket on your health insurance and if you're well prepared with an emergency fund to pay your max out of pocket but it does also cover your passengers.

The exceptions I make to that are when you regularly have other folks, clients, kids etc. in your car as you never know what other people are doing.  If it is just you driving around, and you have health insurance I would rather see a person use that money on increased coverage elsewhere (Umbrella, higher liability limits, life etc.)"
Insurance,35ls2n,chris41658,2,Mon May 11 16:29:24 2015 UTC,"100/300 is what your policy will pay towards another person's medical bills if you cause an at fault accident, that's not what you receive. If you're in at fault accident that is where the medical coverage kicks in. If somebody else is at fault, their liability pays towards your medical bills. If you have health insurance, and don't regularly transport tons of passengers then feel free to choose a low medical payment option."
Insurance,35ls2n,britt5689,2,Mon May 11 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"Medpay is a duplication of health insurance coverage but it may be useful if you have a high deductible health plan since it normally is primary coverage ahead of health insurance for incidents involving cars.   So, if you have a car accident, or you get hit by a car while cycling or a pedestrian, or have just about any other sort of incident where the car is a material factor in the injury (loading, unloading, entering, exiting, etc..) then instead of having to eat your $5,000 health insurance deductible you just submit the bills to the auto insurer and they pay them.   So it's not for your copays. Your health insurer will actually reject your automobile related injury claims until you demonstrate that either you have no medpay coverage or what coverage you have is all used-up. Only then does everything roll onto your health insurance.  IMHO for the $4 a month, or whatever the premium is, I think it's a good buy. I carry $100k just so I don't have to deal with any car injury bills/paperwork unless I'm in a pretty serious accident.  If you're young it's an exceptionally good deal since an automobile is at or near the top of the list of ways you'd ever end up in the hospital.   TL/DR Medpay is $0 deductible primary health coverage, but only applies to injuries related to car accidents."

I paid the late payment this morning, and then called to ask about reinstatement. They said I did not quality for reinstatement, but that I could sign up for a new policy.   But on my canceled policy it says I still owe $700+ and that my next payment is due 6/9. Why would I have a payment due next month, and a remaining balance equal to half the total policy, if my policy has been canceled?   Thanks again."
Insurance,35l7bs,britt5689,5,Mon May 11 13:25:09 2015 UTC,I work for Progressive and I promise you do not owe the balance for the rest of policy. They cannot charge you for insurance if they're not providing coverage. The paper work might just be confusing.
Insurance,35l7bs,halfanapplepie,2,Mon May 11 14:30:21 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your response and I will reference you if they invoice me next month. (Kidding, of course.)"
Insurance,35l7bs,zardwiz,3,Mon May 11 14:43:26 2015 UTC,Yea the other person is correct. Obviously I can't tell your exact situation but every company does have specific guidelines. Progressive likely differ from my own company though.
Insurance,35l7bs,NYAgent112,5,Mon May 11 14:46:35 2015 UTC,"Billing lag.  Didn't realize it had only been two days.  Give it a few days and look online or call them.  If you paid the earned premium, your balance should be zero, it just takes time for all the systems to catch up to each other.  If they still want $700+ in a week or so, then call and inquire, but that's unlikely."
Insurance,35l7bs,NYAgent112,2,Mon May 11 23:52:13 2015 UTC,OK. That makes sense. Thanks.
Insurance,35l7bs,NYAgent112,4,Tue May 12 12:43:56 2015 UTC,"You're not paying the remainder of the policy.  Progressive still insured you from the time you made your last payment to the date your policy cancelled.  Since they were still insuring you for that time, they can collect for that time, plus whatever back payments you missed.  This is standard practice."
Insurance,35l7bs,tommiebooyy,1 point,Mon May 11 12:58:42 2015 UTC,"I responded to this in another comment, but the email I received seems to indicate that I am responsible for the remaining balance of the entire policy, which is another five months. I already paid the past due amount, but it says I still have a balance of $700+.  I understand that I owed, and I paid that, but my policy still lists a remaining balance and a due date for the next payment."

The person I spoke with was quite clear that I am not longer a Progressive policy holder, so I have no interest in paying anything additional on this policy.   Thanks again."

The brakes, rim, possibly the hub will be on you to repair. But if you have undercarriage, additional suspension damage etc they would likely cover that. Being you did the work yourself it could be marked as an at fault loss but that depends on the company and adjuster. Only way to know for sure is to file the claim and do a bit of negotiation."

With a DMO (Dental maintenance organization), you will pay a fixed amount based on the procedure.   When comparing plans, make sure your procedure is going to be covered!"
Insurance,35jlwu,GuardianAlien,2,Mon May 11 02:55:33 2015 UTC,"You may be missing the point of insurance.  Insurance is for things that have not happened yet.  It is also for things that directly affect your health.  Bonding is a cosmetic procedure.  To make you attractive.  Most dental plans I am aware of do not cover cosmetic procedures.  Insurance is not a way to save money on things you know you are going to need.  It is also not a way to get a good deal on non-essential, purely cosmetic procedures.  If trying to get over on paying the real price for having your bonding replaced, I think you better rethink this strategy.  You will be disappointed.  If you suddenly have raging pain and need a root canal, that is what insurance is for.  Insurance companies won't sell you insurance for something that has already happened."
Insurance,35jlwu,Gekko463,3,Mon May 11 05:52:30 2015 UTC,Most dental bonding isn't cosmetic.  Bonding is tooth colored filling material.  It's used to fill cavities.  It lasts about 5-10 years depending on conditions of the mouth and then needs to be replaced or they begin to seep causing further damage as bacteria flourishes.
Insurance,35jlwu,Doc_Lee,2,Mon May 11 21:33:53 2015 UTC,"Uh, OP just got kicked off and perhaps wants dental insurance period, not just for the bonding. If OP gets a root canal, it'll be a good thing that they have insurance!  Can't predict that kind of stuff."
Insurance,35k8f5,Dranakin,3,Mon May 11 04:04:28 2015 UTC,"Normally when you rent a car you get the applicable state minimum liability coverage and that's it.   Supplemental Liability coverage usually increases your liability coverage to a stated amount, like $1M.   So say you rent a car in Connecticut. Connecticut has limits of 20/40/10 which means the liability pays up to $20,000 for injuries to any one person, $40,000 cumulative total for injuries from any one accident, and up to $10,000 in property damage. The rental car place would pay out up to those limits and after that you may be on the hook for the rest. So you're cruising down I-95 in Stamford and the traffic comes to a sudden stop and you rear-end a Porsche 911 and do $26,000 in damage to it. The rental car company insurance pays $10,000 and you may be left holding the bag for the remaining $16,000. Supplemental Liability coverage pays that bill.  So if you have no assets you may be judgement proof, but Murphy's Law says that you'll end up in some sort of accident like that where you don't declare bankruptcy over it but get left holding the bag on some uncomfortably large sum.  The Collision Damage Waiver is for the damages to the car you're renting. The rental car place agrees to waive any claims against you for physical damage to the rental car in exchange for $XX per day. You fill out a report, hand them the keys, and walk away.  Damage waivers may be secondary coverage to any collision coverage you may have, they may be primary, or they may only cover a fixed amount of money in damages. You need to ask the rental car place and/or read the back of the rental agreement.  Credit card agreements like yours may cover the rental car essentially like collision insurance. The agreements vary by card issuer and change from time to time so you want to read the most recent version. Read the agreement but IIRC most credit card agreements also require you to turn down the rental car company's coverage and pay for the entire rental in full with that credit card. This means no paying cash at the end or switching to a different credit card. I worked at a rental car place and occasionally saw ccard companies refuse to pay-out on claims that were discovered after the car was returned because the owner paid part of the bill in cash.  Note that both damage waivers and credit card coverages have many more loopholes than traditional auto insurance. For example both CDW and CC coverages are voided by driving drunk which collision insurance (in the US) generally is not.   If you rely on CDW or CC coverage you must read the terms on the back of the contract carefully and abide by the provisions for coverage to be applicable. Only listed drivers can operate the car, drunk driving voids it, geographical use limitations apply, off-road use voids it, etc... There is usually a blanket exclusion in the credit card coverage for any violation of the rental agreement.  Read the agreements carefully to be sure that theft is a covered peril under either coverage. In some rental car contracts and CCARD agreements it is not. Credit card agreements may not cover diminished value (where applicable) or loss of use charges that would normally be waived under the Damage Waiver from the rental car place.  Also note that credit card coverages generally don't cover certain exotic/luxury vehicles or larger trucks.  EDITS: Grammar."

Insurance,35ick3,omfg_its_so_and_so,6,Sun May 10 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"Check what kind of medical payments (medpay) coverage you have on your renters and your dad's homeowners policies. Common limits are $1000-$5000. It is meant for exactly this kind of situation. Medpay claims are considered ""no-fault"" so your company shouldn't raise your premium for using it, though you should check with your agent to be sure.  If the limit on the medpay isn't enough to cover his injuries and he wants to pursue more or he retains an attorney who will be looking for general damages (pain and suffering) then they will open a liability claim. That would definitely affect your premium.  By offering the medpay compensation, you are showing good faith and hopefully will avoid it going any further. That is the main motivation for insurers offering the coverage in the first place.  ETA: You might also suggest he double check to make sure COBRA isn't a possibility. There is a certain amount of time you have to start COBRA benefits (I believe 90 days) past your last day of coverage. He would have to pay back premium during the time he wasn't covered, but depending on how his deductibles and OOP maximums are setup he could save a lot of money."
Insurance,35ick3,JeepGuy587,4,Sun May 10 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"Does the victim getting drunk at the OPs house (I'm assuming this, it wasn't stated) effect liability?"
Insurance,35ick3,none_shall_pass,3,Sun May 10 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"The friend being drunk probably would affect liability, but it would come down to either having the court decide that or the insurance company issuing a cash settlement to avoid litigation altogether. Either way it's a claim that will cost OP. Keep in mind also that liability isn't all or nothing. The court could decide that the friend has some percentage of negligence between 0 and 100%. Depending on state laws OP could be responsible for the remaining percent.  That's the beauty of medpay coverage. It's basically the insurance company saying ""Hey chief, we aren't saying our customer did anything wrong, but we'd be completely willing to pay for your medical bills (up to $X) if you don't pursue it any further""."
Insurance,35ick3,JeepGuy587,5,Sun May 10 20:23:21 2015 UTC,"This seems like dangerously state-specific advise to give.  What might fly in PA might not in WI, for instance.    OP, I'd be very careful with this line of thinking.  You're potentially giving your friend the keys to your checkbook.  It is not a long step to the idea of him suing you and winning more than your insurance amount.  Personally, I would never voluntarily offer up my insurance limits, and any good attorney will give you the exact same advice.

That said, I never said anything about providing OP's friend with his policy limits. Just simply to consider going ahead and filing a medpay claim, as this is the exact situation it is designed for.

Odds are, his level of intoxication would make him at least 50% liable, but other issues such as the fact that there is no defect with the stairs, and the fact that (I assume) he's used those stairs many times before.   Liability can be placed on you if your stairs are out of code, or if there is inadequate lighting that should be there.

Whether it gets fixed or not depends on whether or not you authorize a shop to do the repair.   If there is a lender then the lender or body shop's name will be on the check.  If there is no loan then only that name of the insured(s) will be on the check.

They're not cancelling you, which is good, but they're due more money because owning a car and driving it in Savannah is riskier than wherever you were in Kansas - according to your insurance company that risk is about double.  That has nothing to do with your driving or anything else, just that you're learning that not all places are equal from an insurance standpoint.  The companies look at things like crime, traffic density, how often people managed to collect money from ""soft tissue damage"" from car accident injuries and things like that to determine what the price should be.  Generally speaking, there's nothing you can do to bring this back down to $54/month.  Sorry, but until you move, you're going to pay  more than that.  And you may never have a bill that low again.

However, your wife's lack of experience driving in the US is probably going to keep the premium higher than it would otherwise.

Some companies will give a bit of credit though for international driving experience, so do shop around.  I also would recommend having your wife rated on a liability only vehicle (no comprehensive or collision coverage).  In some instances (at least in NC), it is cheaper to insure two vehicles (one full coverage, one only liability) than it is to just insure the full coverage vehicle because the inexperienced operator gets rated on the liability only vehicle."

Google ""sample behavioral interview questions.""  If they ask ""Are you organized?"", ""Yes, very"" is not a sufficient answer.  Also, have several solid questions for them.  I've interviewed UW trainees. And when I ask ""What questions do you have for me?"" and they say ""Nothing"" or the only question they can think of is ""What would a typical day be like?"", I know right then I won't be offering them a position.  Anyway, if it's a trainee position, they're not going to expect you to know too much about insurance or underwriting.  I'd do some research along 3 parallel lines. (1) how an insurance company works - what does an actuary do, what's the distribution department, what's a combined ratio, what's a hit ratio, why do UWs get so upset when agents block the market, what does blocking the market even mean? (2) whatever lines they write, have at least a basic understanding of the coverages involved - if they write auto, know the difference between comp and collision, know what CSL and UM stand for - if they write homeowners, know the difference between a homeowners policy and a dwelling policy (3) if you have any idea what territory you'll be in, look into some issues specific to that area - like why do homeowners in TX get a discount for having a hail-resistant roof, why do homeowners rates keep going up in NC?"

But at $8 a month, that's $96 a year.  That's more money annually than a standard renters policy with contents coverage in some places.  Assurant will do 5k contents IIRC, and they're cheap.  I have not seen reviews of their liability claims handling, only of their property claims handling.  What state are you in, and how is your credit?  Those both impact price (credit does not in MD/CA) In most parts of NJ, Stillwater starts at $79 a year for 10k contents and 300k liability, for instance.  Also, what are you trying to accomplish with an umbrella, specifically? If you have a $1MM liability exposure, you want a solid carrier behind the underlying policy.    It may benefit you to sit down with an agent and discuss your coverage goals, to make sure the policies you're considering will accomplish those goals."
Insurance,35f8t0,zardwiz,2,Sat May 9 21:06:42 2015 UTC,"I will be moving to a southeast state and I need the renters liability to purchase an umbrella of $1M-2M from my auto insurer.   I assume that the crime rate is much higher in my new city than my current city because my auto policy will double in cost when I move there.  My credit is high-600's to low 700's (low average account age and a smattering of old late payments).  I don't have much in networth or current salary, but I will begin a residency in emergency medicine July 1st and in three years time when I graduate, I anticipate making $250K-450K annually.  Since I have the potential for a high income, I feel more exposed than the average person making $50K a year with no assets.  I did approach an agent who gave me two reasonable quotes, one from Assurant for ~$136 a year ($5K property, $300K liability) and one from Universal for ~$140 a year ($20K property, $300K liability).    What I don't understand is why the Assurant policy costs the same as the Universal policy but only includes $5K in contents coverage versus $20K offered by Universal."
Insurance,35f8t0,zardwiz,2,Sat May 9 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"Could be crime, could be quantity of accidents driving up the auto premium, or both - the crime can easily be checked online, though.  Also could be you're moving to FL, where fraud is rampant, though they're trying to get a handle on it.  Drives rates way up for everyone.  Future income is a very good reason to get an umbrella.  You're making the right choice.  Assurant is not a carrier I would personally recommend, for what it's worth.  Premiums aren't just based on the risk of you as an individual, but also on the company, their reserves, their overall finances, etc.  Some states also have far less regulation on rates than others. (Compare TX and NC rate filings, for instance)  With decent credit, you should go with a large, solid carrier that's been around awhile - namely, A rated.  If a carrier says they ""aren't rated"" or ""never asked to be rated,"" that's a big red flag.  Those prices you've been quoted are not bad for GA/FL.  Check out American Strategic (through a local agent) they tend to be reasonably priced, have a solid claims payment record, and their agents are largely decent at minimum.  I know they write in FL and are willing to write coastal areas in many cases.  Also, don't forget to increase your auto liability limits as well - the umbrella will cover you there too, but only if you maintain the requisite underlying limits.  If you have 50/100, and the retention on the umbrella is $300k, you're on the hook for the $250k difference (assuming you injure one person in that accident).   And if available, get the UM/UIM on your umbrella.  Some guy from NJ with 15/30 hits you?  No problem, you have the UIM on your policy + the umbrella.  Costs a bit more, but well worth it.    You're definitely more exposed than the average person, and not everyone in your position thinks that far ahead."

If you don't mind, could I ask you why Assurant is not a company that you'd not recommend?  I am strongly considering increased UIM as well.  Do you think it is worth increasing UIM to 100% of my umbrella limit?  My current policy is $300K/$500K unstacked UIM."
Insurance,35f8t0,chris41658,1 point,Sat May 9 23:30:45 2015 UTC,"TL;dr - your post is being downvoted because most people who ask for a liability only renters policy are cheap assholes.  Forgive the bluntness, but that's about the sum total of it.  Not suggesting you fall into that category, but it's common.  The same people who get their lease renewal offer on the first of May, and find out they're required to have renters insurance, call up and absolutely demand that the policy not start until the first of August when the lease mandating coverage begins.  Because God forbid they spend six dollars a month when their lease doesn't contractually require them to.  (I contract for a national firm that focuses on renters insurance, and these bitter fools ruin my day even though I'm not the one dealing with their BS).  I'm not judging you in any way, just observing why others might be judging you.  Assurant...  Does not have the best reputation with regards to property claims.  They allegedly have failed to disclose things like actual cash value policies.  I have no personal, direct knowledge of those claims, of course, since I don't work for them, but even allegations suggesting they sold ACV policies without clearly explaining that fact are deeply concerning.  I have zero knowledge of how Assurant handles liability claims, which are your primary concern, but if they don't handle property claims well they're not likely to handle liability claims well.  The state you're moving to is highly relevant with regard to auto.  Stacking is not a thing in most states.  The state you're moving from would also help.  Generally speaking, stacking is a waste of money if you have one vehicle and one driver - the entire premise is that liability limits for multiple vehicles can be combined on one vehicle.  Two cars on one policy?  Your 50/100 just became 100/200 UIM.  That's a very over-broad paraphrase, but close enough.  300/500 is perfectly reasonable limits in 99% of circumstances.  Your auto carrier will not write 1.3/1.5 limits for UIM - the additional $1MM comes from your umbrella.  I'm not in the southeast, and not in a state that stacks, but here's my current setup as a risk-averse individual (Never, ever forget that the higher your limits, the harder your insurer will defend against a claim, at their own expense, saving you potentially tens of thousands in legal fees)  HO4: $35k contents, $1MM liability, $5k med pay (no fault ""Guest breaks ankle in your apartment because life sucks, make it go away quick"" coverage)  Auto: 500/500, same UM/UIM, $0 comp deductible, $250 collision deductible.    For what it's worth, my wife never had a reason to get a license, I'm currently teaching her to drive.  I'll be keeping maxed out limits for several years as she gains experience, just because it's a best practice.  Umbrella: $1MM.  Not because I have assets to protect, but because someone suing me would ruin my day.  For me, none of those limits are per se necessary - I have little at risk - but they keep me comfortable and I know that if someone sues me it's straight up not my problem.  Also, off the top of my head, I think I spend maybe two grand a year between auto, renters, and umbrella.  I'd spend $1,750 if I knocked my limits down to minimums, and I'd be screwed if something happened.  Well worth the extra couple hundred a year.  If your current policy is 300/500, all you need to do is get an umbrella with UM/UIM coverage that only mandates $300k retention.  In the Southeast, pay attention to wind exclusions.  If you're going to FL and it's not Orlando or Gainesville, you may safely assume windstorm (hurricane) coverage is excluded.  If you live at Pierhouse at Channelside, built recently and from concrete, wind coverage for contents is not even a thing.  If it's a frame building with asphalt shingles, you may want to try to get wind coverage, for instance.  If you throw me a company you're looking at and the state you're in, I'm happy to offer feedback.  Some are drastically more difficult to deal with than others.  Avoid insurers of last resort unless they are, well, your last resort.  Incidentally, my perspective on UIM is this: If some idiot thinks 15k is enough coverage, and I know he exists somewhere out there, I need to protect against that.  If your 40 year x 250k/year career of $10MM expected earnings could be destroyed by one drunk idiot with 15/30, you owe it to yourself to insure against that risk.  Maxed out limits + umbrella with UIM does a good job of that.  It also makes it the insurance carrier's problem to sue the drunk, underinsured idiot.  Not yours. (generally speaking).  Hopefully helpful - there are too many people out there in early stages of their professional career who get screwed because of personal mistakes that impact their future income.  Insure for anything and everything you can, because you'll be a big fat target for a PI attorney one day.  Not that PI attorneys don't serve a valid purpose - they absolutely do.  But defending against them and paying the settlement should be your insurance company's problem, not a problem that sucks away your future assets or earnings.  TL;dr - Insurance is cheap, cover your ass well."
Insurance,35f8t0,chris41658,1 point,Sun May 10 02:14:52 2015 UTC,You might not be able to eliminate the personal property but you could carry 5 or 10k and jump your deductible to 5k (or whatever the max is) and end up in the same place   You may also be able to select ACV coverage instead of replacement cost coverage.  If you were to go with a policy like that in CA your cost would be ~500 per year.  Not sure you can get anyone to play ball for less than that.

You could have a 450cc Kawasaki and it might be $500 a year to insure but as soon as that same style Kawasaki has 600cc, you're now at $2000.   It's honestly kind of a way for a company to say they don't want to insure those types of bikes without flat out denying them coverage.

I'm a personal lines underwriter for a major insurer, and I almost never request this documentation, nor does anyone else in my department.   Exceptions: You have a major speeding violation, an alcohol-related violation, or any sort of at-fault accident with interesting circumstances recently, and I suspect you're not actually out of the household (and could still be an exposure under the policy) and your parents are just trying to cut their premium down by lying. Additionally, with the way that Personal Injury Protection coverage works in my state, I also want to make sure that your legal address is at another residence, so that if you continue to drive poorly and smash your car and injure yourself, my company is not on the hook for any of your medical expense anymore. I also want to know that you have active insurance elsewhere, so even if you're operating one of the vehicles we insure with permission, your PIP coverage would still come from your carrier, and not my company.

For what it's worth, back when I moved out of my parents' house, a request for documentation from their insurance carrier's underwriters followed shortly after.

Insurance,35be7j,hg13,5,Fri May 8 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"I personally think that the Progressive quote with25/50K liability is way too low. That limit usually does not cost that much to increase and can really save you if you're sued for negligence.  Even if a pedestrian jumps in front of your car and it's tough to prove you're not at-fault you can be responsible for their medical bills for the accident (which can take MANY years to recover from) and they most likely will exceed $50,000.   Other than that the coverages on all the policies look great especially Rental Reimbursement & Loan/Lease Gap. The esurance looks REALLY low even for a 6-month policy (I don't know much about esurance, but I'm skeptical). Other than that moving the deductibles to suit your finances is important.   And having an at-fault accident on your record as a young, single driver will make your rates SKYROCKET. I'd look to see if they offer accident forgiveness. It's usually worth it for about the first 3 years."
Insurance,35be7j,DevinB40,1 point,Fri May 8 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"do you mean for a theoretical at-fault accident, or could you somehow tell from my quotes that I had an at-fault accident?  Maybe this is a stupid question, but if you get new car insurance will accident forgiveness ever cover a previous accident?"
Insurance,35be7j,GnawSun,3,Fri May 8 18:51:15 2015 UTC,"No, accident forgiveness is only going to cover an accident you have while you're on the policy."
Insurance,35be7j,DevinB40,1 point,Fri May 8 18:56:12 2015 UTC,"No, I could not tell that you had an At-Fault accident. If you already have one it should fall off your record after 3 years of the incident.  Accident Forgiveness will not forgive a pre-existing accident. I don't think it's a stupid question."
Insurance,35be7j,Kaell311,1 point,Fri May 8 19:06:10 2015 UTC,As far as I understand accident forgiveness won't truly forgive your future one either. It just says they won't raise your rates as long as you stay with them. If you want to change to a different policy or carrier that forgiven accident will still impact your rates.
Insurance,35be7j,britt5689,6,Fri May 8 20:45:05 2015 UTC,"Whoa these quotes are whack (no offense OP) Your progressive is at state minimum, and the esurance is at 100/300. That's why the prices are different. Quote each company with the EXACT same coverage, otherwise it's like comparing apples to oranges. I would suggest carrying 50/100/50 5K medical, 500 comp, 500 collision, gap (loan lease payoff), and rental car at 30$ per day/maximum 30 days. Once you get all of your quotes at the same coverage then you can do some good comparisons."

I was always on the interstate and I would take pictures of commercial vehicles then go back to the office and call.

Tell them how great their trucks look or how safe a driver was being, add in a few coverage topics and I could usually get an appointment.      But since you are new, what type of insurance are you writing and what do you want to be writing?  What markets do you have?    I have always had good luck with business networking events, chambers of commerce, social after hours, etc.  It seems people don't mind talking about insurance so much with a beer in their hand."
Insurance,35b3lb,emptydiner,1 point,Fri May 8 19:02:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with every single suggestion offered thus far.   One suggestion to consider: approach your carrier(s) and ask for feedback on what unique markets / difficult risks they are comfortable writing, and then focus your calling, emailing, driving, meeting, web and social networking presence on branding yourself as the go-to expert in one or more of these arenas.   As an example, my brand is PEO and my pitch is ""no deposit, no audit pay-as-you go workers compensation and risk management"".   Under your chosen brand, you will then develop your subsets of expertise to stay 80/20 with market dynamics. For a while, the high return for me was to market our programs to California temp staffing, and then it was to Florida roofers. Now I am on to home health care and non emergency medical transportation.   If you venture down this path, just remember to do the research with your carrier(s) before you start promoting your ability to perform miracles.  Self assess the ratio of your time spent (and how) versus financial return. Identify with the 80/20 rule. Always be striving to keep your time and effort aligned with it."
Insurance,35c32z,SickArm,1 point,Fri May 8 21:46:42 2015 UTC,Do you know if their insurance company has already contacted yours?
Insurance,35c32z,Jake_77,1 point,Sat May 9 07:49:10 2015 UTC,the conditions of your policy will require notification of any incident that could giv rise to a claim. Late notification is an indemnity issue taht they will usually waive provided you havent prejudiced their position. Motor insurance is compulsory in the UK and as such under the RTA your insurers have to deal with any TP claim in the first instance although they are entitled to seek to recover any sums incurred from you ifyou breached a reporting condition. This is more of a problem if the TP has been injured as a claim would be in the PI portal which has a very limited period for investigation and response to a claim and failing to respond drops the claim out of the portal and the C sols costs increase. You would have prejudiced their position and they could then look to you to recover their outlay although arguably only the adverse additional costs caused by your delay. I would ring them and explain and my bet would be this wont be a problem.

It is your responsibility to make sure you know what your policy covers and what payments you are required to make, not the office that is lending the equipment.

It's your car, your loss, etc. They cannot negotiate the value of your vehicle or anything for you. And many carriers won't even do the courtesy of contacting the other insruance company for you and giving them your info. So they saved you 30 mins or so of filing a claim (if one wasn't already filed). I know it's a pain in the ass to have to tell tons of people what happened, where your car is, etc etc etc. But ultimately, you have to discuss the accdient with the other carrier b/c it's YOUR car and you were the driver. No one but an attorney can negotiate or deal with the other carrier for you."

Depending on the results of the insurance companies' investigations, you could be liable for the other driver's damages. In Texas, you need to be 51% or more at fault in order to be barred from recovery.

The accident I witnessed, one was reversing slowly, having looked carefully. The other car whipped around the corner without looking, and ran into the nearly stopped reversing car. It was still deemed the fault of the car reversing. Since you were both reversing, I don't know. I would say for certain you'd better call your insurance immediately with your side."

Insurance,35b5ge,RegulatorsMountUp,6,Fri May 8 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on the state of course, but at least in CA, this can PROBABLY be done. You do not have to have an LLC to be insurable, individuals can be insurable on commercial policies. There are lots of production insurance specialists in the LA area but some independent agents would probably be able to swing it as well, I know I could (of course depends on what you do).   I am assuming you are NOT being asked to insure the entire production, just your own work.  That said, depending on what you do, it could be easier or harder.  Easier: indoor videography, sound, animation, post production.  Harder: outdoor videography, porn, music videos, pyrotechnics, sports, any ""uncontrolled"" environments.  If you're in the ""harder"" group, well, it's going to be harder to find insurance on such short notice. If you're in the ""easier"" group, it should be doable with any competent agency that has access to production markets.   Something you may need to negotiate down is the $3M limit. That's more than most insurers are going to want to offer to an individual who has no prior coverage. A better benchmark for you is $1M per occurrence, $2M general aggregate. MAYBE you can get $2M per occurrence. $3M, good luck and it's going to cost you. Good news is, a lot of insurance requirements are negotiable. If your contribution to the production is minor and low-risk, the limits are especially negotiable.  Again, depends on what you do, but lets say you are an independent videographer for hire. Expect to pay $1000-3000 for annual insurance. The ""rating basis"" (pricing basis) for the policy will probably be your gross annual receipts and you will need to provide information on the frequency and types of productions you work on. Good news is, once you have general liability insurance in place (which you should have to start with), you won't have to worry about these kinds of requests in the future.  My advice is, call around to independent agents in your area. If any of them specializes in film, pay particular attention to those. Explain your situation and your timeline. Find at least 2 agents who think they can assist you and work with both. Give them what they need ASAP, and let each of them know you are working with another agent as a backup so that there is no nasty surprise on their plate when they dedicate the next 2 days to your file only to find you're going with someone else. (There is nothing I hate more than pouring all of my effort into a file to save a client from a bad situation, only to find out they had another card up their sleeve the whole time. I'd rather know upfront.) Good luck!"

With this kind of accident, determining who is at fault can be a big problem, and you don't want to have to try and negotiate that without some backup. It's likely going to be 50/50, but you never know what the other person said happened.  Judging by some of the wording in your post, it sounds like you're trying to avoid this altogether. Don't be that guy. If the other driver got your license plate, can accurately describe your car, and the damages match up, there's a pretty good chance that's enough for him to make a claim with your insurance company anyway, and recover at least some of his damages. You're better off reporting it to them so they can have the most information possible, including your side of the story."

Insurance is about indemnity (to blatantly steal a phrase that one of my fellow posters used a little while ago).  That means that it's there to put you back in the same position you were in at the time of the accident.  So putting you back in a better car is not an option.  However, if GEICO decides to total your Kia, you can try to find a similar one and they should reimburse you for it.  That's possible, so maybe you'll get lucky.  That is all predicated on the idea that your car will be totaled.

If the bank owns your car, you may not have any say in the matter.  In general, GEICO owes you up to the pre-accident value of your vehicle.  Let's say that's $3K.   They'll also find out the current value of your vehicle, with the damage, and for this demonstration, we'll say that it's $800.  They may give you the option of releasing the vehicle and taking a check for $3K, or they may let you keep $800 worth of wrecked vehicle and give you $2,200 to do with as you please.   They've essentially made you whole again, and their job is done.  You've got to determine if it's worth it to you take that $2200 to keep the car.  If the repairs are less than that (which is unlikely, but there is a ""sweet spot"" you might fall into), you're in luck.  If the repairs are more, then you'd be responsible for any part of the repair bill over $2200.  Then again, if you don't mind a green fender on a white car, that repair bill can be brought down some.

Of course there is some cold calling, but it's not too bad. My suggestion if you decide to come to the sales side is start networking with possible ""centers of influence"" now. Realtors, car dealers and mortgage brokers are great ones to focus on.

Insurance,358jfk,fremenofporitrin,5,Fri May 8 00:17:44 2015 UTC,"Code upgrades usually require a) that the cause not be excluded (ie, the decking is rotted away unrelated to the loss, but due to age/long-term leaks, and b) a letter from the local code enforcement officer confirming the code itself and that your roof has been inspected and found not to conform to current code."
Insurance,358jfk,izznt,3,Fri May 8 01:22:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response, definitely something to consider.  If it was excluded in the policy I would have expected them to have brought that up already (not that I am going to suggest they check).  As for an inspection from local code enforcement , the problem was found on a Saturday morning when the roofers removed the old roof.  They could not just stop work and expose the interior of the house to the elements until the next week when code enforcement would be back in the office.  If they had not replaced the decking and just put on the new roof, and it then failed inspection,they would have had the major expense of doing it all over again.  And I doubt the insurance company would have paid for that, they would then say they should have just replaced the decking in the first place.  Stuck between a rock and a hard place."
Insurance,358jfk,izznt,3,Fri May 8 01:49:29 2015 UTC,"Failed what sort of inspection? Roofing generally doesn't require one. The roofers should have saved several sheets of the old deck. Did they not?   Edit: Sorry, realized I was probably confusing in my prior comment. They usually just need to see the old deck to confirm it wasn't up to code. I didn't mean you replace a roof and then have to call code enforcement. You can't tell what thickness sheathing is on a roof after it's done."
Insurance,358jfk,MountainGoat84,1 point,Fri May 8 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"Well, sucks they did not keep pieces, just took pictures.  But perhaps if I show the pics to code enforcement that would be enough?  Might be long shot, but worth a try.  Thanks for responding."
Insurance,358jfk,MountainGoat84,1 point,Fri May 8 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you are, roofs definitely can require an inspection. In Colorado, some cities require a mid roof inspection (not entirely sure when that happens, but sometime after tear off and before the shingles are put on) and a final inspection."
Insurance,358jfk,MountainGoat84,3,Fri May 8 04:56:44 2015 UTC,"So I don't know what city you're in so I can't look at the codes. But 3/8'' could be acceptable depending on your rafter span and the roof loads. You'll have to determine what your roof load requirements are based on your local code but this would help as well.   http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/icod/irc/2012/icod_irc_2012_5_sec003.htm     look at table R503.2.1.1(1)  A few things, your contractor needs to provide the code and it needs to be enforced code by the city.    Really, he should have gotten a photo of the thickness. You can say that it's obvious that it was less than 1/2'' but in reality, it takes two seconds to take a photo with a smart phone.  As for the ""sound, level and rigid surface"" argument. That sounds to me like the plywood decking was deteriorated and probably rotting and delaminating. That would be an excluded cause of loss, and as such would not be subject to code upgrade.  As someone else said, you should try and get the inspector to tell you if what would have been up there was not up to code and why. If it's because it didn't meet the proper thickness, then you're looking good on having that covered."
Insurance,358jfk,TresGay,1 point,Fri May 8 04:19:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for that info.  The contractor says code is 1/2 inch.   I will suggest they get the pictures to the code inspector and see what they say.

I like code stuff, and this is one I've never had to deal with (the thickness issue) so I did some more research.  If he wasn't submitting, the code, along with the rafter spacing then he hasn't given them what they need. Granted this is based of the 2012 International Building Code, but that's what a lot of cities, counties or states use. Could you tell me what state you live in? If it has a lot of variability (mountains, marine environments), could you tell me that too?  I'm curious now and would like to see if I can figure out the roof loads.

For future reference, an average replacement with a fairly low mileage used engine (including a parts & labor warranty) should run $2,500-$3,000 for many older cars.  The salvage title will often detract from the value, sometimes 30% or more form a comparable vehicle with a clean title.  On balance the salvage title is likely to subtract more from the value than the engine will add."

They even tell you your insurance score at the end of the quote. The only other concern is they do not pull your MVR or CLUE reports until after you purchase the policy. So if you've forgotten about a minor ticket or accident in the past five years they can change your rate if one pulls up. And if someone else was driving your vehicle during an accident it may pull up under your insurance records since your insurance is primary for your vehicle.

Insurance,357cxr,JeepGuy587,1 point,Thu May 7 20:42:23 2015 UTC,Companies have criteria they are looking for.  You and a man down the street might be the same age driving the same car and have different rates.  I would pull up both quotes and make sure that they are quoting the same coverage.  Most companies sweet spot is 2 years so they don't want to jack the rates right away or they will lose the customer after 6 months. Because it is basically half i'm willing to bet that you are being quoted with basic full with the cheaper ones and added limits or coverage with the more expensive companies.
Insurance,355epw,insuranceq123,3,Thu May 7 06:44:03 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll try to answer these as best I can:   Generally speaking, insurance companies can get some storage fees waived in cases like this.  However, you should be proactive and mitigate those fees as much as possible, so if you can have it towed elsewhere and stored for less (preferably nothing), then you should do so.  No, you should not hire a lawyer at this stage.  If you get sued, your insurance company is obligated to defend you.  You don't have Collision coverage with your insurance company, so you don't have reason to sue them yet (you might if the Uninsured Motorists comes into play down the line, but it sounds like it won't). I don't see a reason to stop trusting your insurance company at this stage. The new adjuster is coming in because the other driver is alleging that you injured him.  Based on your version of events, YOUR adjuster (and that's how to think of her) is most likely to point the other driver towards a large pile of sand and invite him to pound it until he produces a beautiful stained-glass window. Yes, I think you're just being paranoid.   Honestly, you need to be pursuing the other driver's insurance, not yours.  It sounds like you might not have done that, but I'm a bit confused by your sequence of events, so maybe you've already taken that step.  Your phone calls need to be to the other driver's  since you're convinced he was at fault.  That said, it sounds like he's disputing that, although your witnesses should support your version.  Good luck!"

And to answer your question I did call his insurance and they still haven't even talked to their own driver (they can't get in touch from what I gathered.) The conversation turned pretty accusatory on their part so I got out of it quickly. His adjuster has been impossible to reach by my adjuster.   The other big concern I have is my car and the storage fees. I live in CA and it seems like this http://repobiz.com/fyi_repairs_storage_2008.pdf  limits the storage fees to $1250. Is that the case? Because they are asking for like $5000, which I clearly don't have."
Insurance,355epw,broseph23,3,Fri May 8 23:41:09 2015 UTC,"You got a new adjuster assigned to your claim because 1) claimant is rep'd 2) claimant is rep'd for injuries Calm down, almost every insurance company has different segmentations of adjusters. Also, you need to get your car out of that shop as it is just accruing storage and you're not doing anything about it. You have a duty to mitigate your damages, if the other insurance company were to accept liability they may determine that some of your storage costs are unreasonable if you're not doing anything to mitigate your damages.

Insurance,355lcl,maspien,6,Thu May 7 08:22:53 2015 UTC,"Your policy likely states that your insurance company can either choose to pay you for the amount to repair the vehicle or the actual cash value (total it out).  Your insurance company will not total it out until it reaches a certain threshold (usually when the repair cost is 70-80% of the actual cash value).  If the estimate comes in below that they won't total it, and again your policy gives your insurance company the right to choose what to do.  The rental will not be added to the cost of repair.    If you run out of rental I doubt they will give you more days. Your insurance policy is a contract and it will have the total dollar amount they will pay for rental.   The one curious thing is that they didn't total it out already.  Usually if a vehicle is stolen and not recovered in 30 days they are totalled but you said the thieves had it for 2 months?"

Insurance,355lcl,1NSUR4NC3,5,Thu May 7 11:18:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry about your situation.    You won't be able to force your insurance company to total the car. If they deem it repairable you could ask to speak with a manager and address your concerns, but if that doesn't change their position then they will pay for repairs and not a total.   Regarding rental, if you maxed your limits then they cannot pay for any additional.  If $1,500 limits is what you paid for then that's all they will pay for.   However, if you know who the perp is who stole your car, and they're charged with auto theft, you could submit any out of pocket expenses to the prosecuting attorney for inclusion of restitution. That includes any out of pocket rental. If the perp has no money...well...you might not get anything back anyway and they'll just do jail time.   TL;DR: no, no, theft sucks I'm sorry :("
Insurance,355lcl,Zen_Drifter,4,Thu May 7 11:11:13 2015 UTC,"As an appraiser I dislike giving recovered thefts back to owners who don't want them. I know that in the worst cases the owner can basically claim any type of damage as related damage. I'm also going to live with any premature mechanical problems the car has until either the claim period ends or until they sell it (if the policy has no time limits for claims).   So no, you probably can't ""make them"" total it, though because insurance is state regulated I'm interested in how an overseas claim is handled by a US insurer.  There are things you can do to make the decision to total it easier for the insurer if it's close though.  Step 1 : Inspect the car yourself. Make detailed & copious notes on every single last dent, scratch, abrasion, nick, chip, gouge, smell, discoloration, or defect, regardless of how small, that you don't remember being there before the loss.   Step 2: Speak directly with the damage appraiser if possible, as well as the body shop estimator. Make it crystal clear that, aside from anything pre-existing, any indication of damage, however small, is expected to be returned to its pre-loss condition. That cut in the door trim panel? Sure they can hire a vendor to fix it, but the texture across it better be totally consistent or that $450 part is going to need to be replaced. The chip in your transmission housing? Well, that needs to be replaced. Smegma stain on your shift boot. Replace. Greasy thumbprint on the headliner? That too. Pay special attention to the interior trims (especially expensive bits like the dash and airbag covers), wheels, look for sidewall cuts on both sides of the tires, and obviously the exterior painted panels. You can make it add-up really fast on an Audi. No need to be a dick about it. That's counterproductive. The power relationship in this situation is asymmetrical, and in the insurer's favor. Just be sure to make them aware that you're going to require them to adhere to the letter of the policy they sold you. Your goal here is to plant seeds of doubt in the appraiser's head so they total it or call their boss to say ""dude, we need to get rid of this car"" for authority to do a preemptive dump.  Step 3: If you can't get them to total it then just go buy another car (if you can afford to float two car payments). When the car is done just sell it. This may sound pricey but the total hit you take on it may well be less than paying for another month of rental out-of-pocket.  With regards to the rental car, if you hit the cap then you hit the cap. Your choices include calling the rental place and trying to renegotiate the deal as cash, seeing if the shop will give you a free or discounted loaner in exchange for you not taking your car elsewhere, or (if you own the car outright) directing the shop not to do some specific parts of the repair and rebating you that money to be used towards the rental."
Insurance,355lcl,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Thu May 7 21:24:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information.  I already told them to not work on it when it gets to the dealer because I wanted to inspect it as well and point out everything.  As you can see in the pictures the airbags did not deploy, is that a cause for a concern or something that should be looked at?  The other car's bags deployed.  I know there is a science going into how air bags deploy and each car and manufacture is different.  What about resale loss?  I was looking into that and noticed I can file a claim for that.  Will the adjuster factor that into the cost to repair the vehicle?"
Insurance,355lcl,Kittyisnotaninja,3,Thu May 7 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"Where is the car? Overseas or in a state in the US?  As far as I know diminished value is only available as a first party claim (meaning claimable against your own policy) in Georgia. This is because auto insurance policies only cover direct physical loss and diminished value is considered an indirect loss, except in Georgia where it's legally defined as a direct loss.  I wouldn't worry too much about the airbags. There's a lot of collision dynamics involved in whether they go off or not including the speed, deceleration forces, seat weight & distance from the airbag, angle of impact, and manufacturer settings. Airbags are required to deploy at a certain deceleration threshold (equal to about ~15mph to zero into a fixed non-movable object like a tree) but there's nothing stopping a manufacturer from setting them to go off at lower speeds than required. I don't see any indication in the photos that the car was subjected to an exceptionally fast deceleration.   Grab the seat belts and give them a tug when you go to look at it. The detonators for the seatbelt tensioners work off the same sensors as the airbags but are independently triggered. If the seatbelt is like a limp piece of spaghetti and won't retract then it's probably detonated in the ""being worn"" position. If it's tight to the center post like a guitar string then it's detonated in the ""not being worn"" position. This requires replacement of the seatbelt(s) and probably the sensors either way. (Some German cars have the detonator in the buckle part so the buckles shouldn't be sucked down into the seat). Either way the airbag light would be activated and not going out when the key is turned. This is basically a ""partial"" deployment of the system and considered normal."

Insurance,3558w2,CopsBroughtPizza,2,Thu May 7 05:28:43 2015 UTC,"You've obviously never seen a credit card merchant agreement.  That's perfectly fine since I bet that most of my compatriots here haven't either.  I only saw one up close and personal about 2 years ago and was shocked.  Those contracts that merchants sign with the folks that provide the terminal services (the actual point of sale, whether that terminal is a physical swipe machine or an electronic one) make the merchant responsible for any fraudulent transactions.  So, for the sake of illustration, if I use a fake Visa card at Wal-Mart, the transaction goes through the system until it bounces back as fraudulent when I'm far away from Wal-Mart (because unless it's immediately declined, it takes time to wend through the system to get approval - usually 2 or 3 days for the merchant to get the money).    So, basically, your assumption that banks are somehow on the hook for fraud just wasn't right.  The merchants are, so using a fake credit card is defrauding Wal-Mart et al, not American Express (since they're an actual bank - the others are not).    Banks do have special insurance for credit card fraud, but that's more because they're the depositories of the information (numbers, ID's, etc.), so if they lose control of that data they're actually on the hook - i.e. if they get hacked Target-style, they're in really serious trouble.  Make sense?"
Insurance,3558w2,key2616,1 point,Thu May 7 12:06:03 2015 UTC,So do the merchants have coverage for things like this?  I'm sure that smaller establishments would not have coverage.  Seems it would be included or at least offered with the POS or terminal agreement.
Insurance,3558w2,emptydiner,2,Thu May 7 13:36:43 2015 UTC,"I know that we were not offered any coverage when we were working on that option, but we would have declined since as an insurance product we could have deflected any non-payment issues pretty easily.  There's a possibility that something like this could be covered in a Crime policy for a merchant, but I don't know one way or the other - you smarter folks will know that answer.  Generally speaking, though, most smaller establishments aren't going to have that much exposure - $50 here or maybe $100 there.  Larger ticket items generally don't walk out the door immediately, though, there's that control already in place."
Insurance,3558w2,key2616,1 point,Thu May 7 14:01:26 2015 UTC,"Merchants are not insured for this, at least not in a traditional sense.  In a large enough data breach, issuing banks can bring suit against the merchant to recover these sorts of costs and it could theoretically be covered under the Privacy Liability agreement of a cyber policy.  But it's not really worth discussing because, by the time that suit gets resolved, the insured's limit will already be blown.  Target had gone through their $100mil before that was even a real discussion.  Either way, it has to be phrased as a suit based on the merchant's failure to secure data, not just ""we want our money back.""  Cyber doesn't respond to pure losses of funds or monetary instruments.  Crime coverage will not address this type of loss.  At the very least, because it's a willful parting of funds to the issuing bank."
Insurance,3558w2,ReppTie,1 point,Thu May 7 23:03:59 2015 UTC,"There's some nuance that I think should be added.  It's pretty common that the merchant takes the loss on card-not-present transactions (online, over the phone, etc.,) and the issuing bank takes the loss on card-present transactions.  The exception when a large, fraudulent, card-present transaction occurs.  I'm not sure there are formal guidelines, but it generally has to be a few thousand dollars before the bank will bother with it.  There's also usually a fee for the issuing bank to handle these issues.  It could be up to $100 per transaction.  It's also worth noting that the liability currently held by the issuing bank shifts to the merchant in October unless the merchant is EMV-compliant.   I'm assuming their bank or credit card company gets reimbursed through insurance.   In short, no, the banks aren't insured for this.  The banks write it off on their taxes.  As key2616 mentioned, the banks do have certain insurance, but that insurance only applies to their own privacy liability.  For example, if the bank failures to protect customer data (hacking, rogue employee, simple mistake, whatever,) they have certain liabilities and obligations.  Think of the letters you get in the mail that say, ""sorry we lost your data.  Here's some complimentary credit monitoring.""  That sort of thing.  Many of them are insured for this type of risk.    The money itself is a whole other thing though.  They aren't insured for that, partially because there's nothing for the insurance companies to underwrite.  The underwriters can't review a merchant's security or protocols, particularly when that merchant might sit on the other side of an acquiring vendor.  (I just realized there's a huge hole in this argument, in case anybody wants to discuss ""vendors acting on your behalf"" wording on cyber policies, although that's not quite the same.)"
Insurance,3558w2,ReppTie,1 point,Thu May 7 22:58:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's helpful. I'm assuming that online transactions simply count as ""card not present"" transactions and so the merchant will take the hit? Same for phone orders?   I'm assuming that the merchant who has EMV technology is free from liability even if the customer didn't use an EMV payment method? (starting in October)  When you say that the banks write off the theft in their taxes, how much does that mitigate the cost. I'm trying to figure out if the banks actually have a meaningful financial incentive to prevent CC fraud.  Another question that might lead me to my answer is what body created that liability shift to occur in October and who wanted it to happen? Is that like a congressional law, or something that is decided by some other group that governs financial liabilities?   Thanks a lot for the response."
Insurance,3558w2,ReppTie,1 point,Fri May 8 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"I'm going to answer the last part first because it provides good context for the rest of it.   Another question that might lead me to my answer is what body created that liability shift to occur in October and who wanted it to happen? Is that like a congressional law, or something that is decided by some other group that governs financial liabilities?   This is purely contractual - the issuing banks dictate it.  Technically they negotiated it but...you can guess how easy it is to negotiate contract terms with, say, Visa (hint: they say ""jump"" and you ask ""how high?"")  That said, a lot of these things are done in order to avoid having the government get involved.  The basic idea is to beat lawmakers to the punch.  That way, by the time the lawmakers start discussing it, the industry can say, ""you don't need to do that.  Look at what we've done on our own.  We're proactive!  Please go back to ignoring us!""  Also, keep in mind that I'm speaking in generalities here, based on the contracts I've read and discussions I've had with clients and people in the industry.  I don't hesitate to believe that the contract key2616 reviewed put all the liability on the merchant.  I've seen a couple contracts that contradict the feedback I'm giving.   I'm assuming that online transactions simply count as ""card not present"" transactions and so the merchant will take the hit? Same for phone orders?   Generally, yes.   I'm assuming that the merchant who has EMV technology is free from liability even if the customer didn't use an EMV payment method? (starting in October)   Not free from liability but their liability will not increase.     When you say that the banks write off the theft in their taxes, how much does that mitigate the cost.   Sorry but I have no clue on this one.  I barely understand my own taxes, nevermind the taxes of multi-billion dollar revenue financial institutions.   I'm trying to figure out if the banks actually have a meaningful financial incentive to prevent CC fraud.   The following is just my opinion.  In a strict sense, I don't think they have a meaningful financial incentive to prevent payment card fraud, however I believe they have meaningful financial incentive to do take certain actions relating to credit card fraud.  In my view, the two related reasons are:   A lack of self-regulation will result in government regulation.  Most large companies prefer the status quo, but if they can't maintain the status quo, they'd prefer to act on their own terms.  If the government gets involved, who knows what they'll do.  While they might act in a low-impact way, they might also enact some sort of draconian law that destroys the profits of the issuing banks.  I think the issuing banks finally feel that government regulation is (or is becoming) likely. The US's failure to adopt EMV is causing issues on a global basis.  Some foreign governments have talked about making magnetic strips (the current US standard) illegal.  If that happens, then Americans traveling overseas can't use their cards to spend money.  That means the issuing banks would lose out on the fees from transactions from Americans who can afford overseas travel."

Insurance,3532iu,emptydiner,6,Wed May 6 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"As an auto claims adjuster in CA I see SO many claims where I need to utilize the UMBI/UNBI coverage. As a motorcyclist if you get hit you are going to have some pretty hefty medical costs. Just one ambulance ride, being seen in the ER and heaven forbid a CT Scan or MRI is going to go over $10k. The minimum liability needed to drive in CA is 5K PD (Property Damage) and $15k for BI (Bodily Injury). So say you are hit by an uninsured motorist, you will definitely want to have UMBI. But say you are hit by a driver who only has $15k BI. You have an ER trip, stitches, an appointment to remove stitches, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment.. that $15k is gone in no time.   UMBI(Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury) and UNBI (Underinsured Bodily Injury) are one in the same coverage. So say you are hit by the driver who has $15k BI coverage and you have $35k in bills. The other insurance company is only going to pay $15k no matter what. So your only recourse is to pursue the rest in Superior Court. If you have the UMBI/UNBI coverage you don't have to do that. You go to your own carrier and they assist you with the rest.   UNBI coverage is not stackable though. So say the other driver has $15K BI and you have $50k UMBI/UNBI, you don't get $65k in coverage. Your carrier would pay the difference so you would have an additional $35k at your exposure (50-15=35). I bring this up because you asked if HIGHER UM/UIM coverage is needed. If you have $15k UM and the other driver has $15k BI, you only have $15k available to you.   As far as Med Pay, this is not as important since the coverage is normally excess to your Primary Health Carrier. It is nice to have if you have a high copay amount or health insurance ded."

Quite a few people are uninsured and even more carry small limits such as $10,000 per person here in Florida. $10,000 gets consumed extremely quickly in a bad accident.  Both coverages will help pay toward your health insurance deductible and/or copay. They also cover your passengers.   Normally the coverage is cheap, but it is relatively expensive on my motorcycle policy.   Yeah, that's pretty common with motorcycle policies.

Insurance,353n0g,britt5689,2,Thu May 7 12:15:17 2015 UTC,"Now, I don't handle Ontario policies, so I'm not 100% sure on this. I looked up the regulations in Ontario and it states:   Ontario Regulation 664 was amended effective November 1, 1996 to prohibit the use of lapses in insurance coverage as a rating variable, except in those limited circumstances set out in the regulation.    This regulation prohibits an insurer from considering a lapse in insurance coverage for purposes of risk classification unless:   the insured person was convicted of driving without insurance during the lapse in coverage; the lapse resulted from the termination of an automobile insurance policy because the insured person failed to pay the premiums due under the policy; the lapse resulted from the suspension of the insured person's driver's license as a result of a driving conviction; the lapse resulted from the insured person's attempt to misrepresent their driving record due to earlier accidents or convictions, in order to avoid paying higher insurance premiums.   The following are examples of criteria insurers cannot consider in assigning a driving record or in determining automobile insurance rates:   the number of years of continuous insurance; the length of time a person has been insured; any lapse in insurance coverage that was not due to a reason set out in the regulation; the length of time a person has owned or leased a vehicle; whether the insurer can verify the claims history of the person.     Based off of this I would assume they are not allowed to charge you a higher rate for a lapse in insurance coverage, unless the lapse was due to one of the 4 accepted circumstances.

In Ontario here (don't know where you are but imagine it's the same rules) the insurance rating is based on the Driver of the vehicle despite who's name the policy/vehicle is in.  So the premium will be the same whether in your SO's name or her parents' names...either that or your misrepresenting the risk and that's a whole different discussion!

Insurance,34zo67,VaticanCattleRustler,2,Wed May 6 08:51:44 2015 UTC,"Their rates are higher because they are accurately pricing the cost of insurance.  I don't want to be cliché but the line, ""you get what you pay for"" is somewhat applicable here.  You are entering into a contract with this company.  The reason they have such high ratings for customer satisfaction is due to their prudent underwriting.  You pay your insurance premiums and they pay any claims.    Many people have bad experiences with insurance companies because there is a tendency to lie or hide material facts when applying for coverage.  Many of the major carriers are no better because they will opt to deny claims based on these situations or abuse the legal system which can be substantially cheaper than paying out claims.  TL;DR  Treat your insurance with importance and due diligence and you'll have a better experience long term."

Insurance,3507wz,gunjr,1 point,Wed May 6 00:56:29 2015 UTC,"The other thing to consider is that accelerated death benefit is often (in my experience) included in a term life policy, whereas a long term care rider might? have an additional premium.    The problem with either is giving the insured a false sense of security because they decrease the final death benefit.. if you calculate you need a $500k death benefit, you can't just slap on a LTC rider without increasing the face value and think that you've suddenly also covered your LTC needs."

ADB often is included in a term policy, but it's priced into the term policy anyway - you just can't see the explicit charge for it. LTC on the other hand is usually a rider which has an explicitly broken out charge."

Keep in mind you just upgraded from a compact car to a mid/full size SUV. The liability for that is going to increase your premiums. If you hit someone you are going to cause a lot more damage and have a higher chance of injuring or severely injuring someone in a 4000 lb SUV vs a 2800 lb car. Also the SUV is worth more, so if you end up totaling it, the insurance has to pay more money out for it. That, and the combination of a recent comp claim, that doesn't seem too far of a stretch.

Insurance,34zdow,LASuperdome,2,Wed May 6 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, 4 years later?  That's a long term for an insurance noncompete.  The longest one I've seen is 2 years."
Insurance,34zdow,key2616,3,Wed May 6 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, the noncompete was for two years.  I was 4 years out but they went after me anyways.  They were ""under suspicion"" that I broke the noncompete prior to the two years was up.  The whole complaint was baseless; they were just trying to be jerks."
Insurance,34zdow,LASuperdome,2,Wed May 6 21:12:03 2015 UTC,One of these days I'm going to post the story of my noncompete over in InsurancePros (where it's not Google-able).  You want to talk about petty and stupid - I've got a story.

Insurance,34zdow,emptydiner,3,Wed May 6 02:13:25 2015 UTC,"You know I love you but this is the actual situation that noncompetes were originally designed to stop - someone working in two places at once.  Whatever the OP thinks, both employers are in the same business competing in the same customer pool.  I can't imagine that any judge would ever wave this through regardless of how poorly worded this is.  Noncompetes are very much driven by circumstances, and if they're enforceable in TX (and they are) then it is absolutely going to be enforced under these circumstances no matter how badly worded it is."
Insurance,34xt5i,DHerpster,3,Tue May 5 13:26:53 2015 UTC,"Yes you do. I work for quite a few big name companies and get lots of incentives/bonuses. I actually just got back from an all expenses paid trip to Palm Beach because I wrote a pre-set amount of polices last year. You don't really have a huge control over your loss ratios. I had one client that had her 500K house burn to the ground and after paying for the structure, contents, and loss of use it was about a one million dollar loss and that particular company dropped my agency like a hot potato."
Insurance,34xt5i,britt5689,2,Tue May 5 14:28:37 2015 UTC,Due to one shock loss? That really sucks!
Insurance,34xt5i,BuckEm,3,Tue May 5 14:41:49 2015 UTC,"Yes it did suck. It's not like the lady purposely burnt her own house down. It was a wiring malfunction.

Her husband died of cancer, 1 year later her house burns to the ground, then about 6 months after that her son ODs and enters rehab."
Insurance,34xt5i,britt5689,2,Tue May 5 14:45:53 2015 UTC,If you are opening your own agency then yes you normally would. They are negotiated annually and the bonus's will vary from year to year. I'm in Texas and keeping our loss ratio low is like trying to predict the weather. Honestly the best you can do as a producer is follow the carriers underwriting guidelines and try to avoid risk with excessive exposures. Usually when you are quoting someone you can tell which clients are more prone to claims than others.
Insurance,34xt5i,ansonyuhas,1 point,Tue May 5 14:23:51 2015 UTC,It depends on the carrier. Loss ratio is a huge component to keeping a carrier happy and some will compensate you for doing so. Agencies are also more valuable when your loss ratio is low.
Insurance,34xt5i,gunjr,1 point,Tue May 5 14:00:22 2015 UTC,"yes, though the carriers don't call is ""profit sharing"" anymore. (remember AON, Marsh, etc?) Deferred compensation is now the PC term. Each carrier is different in how they calculate your table, but yes if your book is profitable and you meet other criteria you get some extra cake.  To keep your loss ratio low: no magic bullet. But one thing that can help is just to make sure you tell your clients to CALL YOU FIRST before they report a claim. Smaller claims (say 2,500 and less) wind up costing the policy holder more money long term. And majority of claims filed are smaller ones that slowly increase your LR."

Then insure it in NJ and in YOUR name, then go to NJ DMV and register it in your name. Since you are now officially out of the household, you really should not be on your parents policy anymore. And insurance must follow ownership of the vehicle.. Doing it like I outlined above and everything is on the up and up and there will be no issues if you're in an accident etc. EDIT- congrats on the job and welcome to NJ (I live in bergen county)"

Insurance,34vp76,letuseatsnacks,4,Mon May 4 23:13:40 2015 UTC,Can you give me a break down of the payouts on the past two and the anticipated payout on the third claim? Minus your deductible of course. I will say that three claims within one year on a renters policy is unusually high and I would lean towards not submitting the claim depending on the dollar amount of your damages.
Insurance,34vp76,gunjr,6,Tue May 5 11:21:16 2015 UTC,3 theft claims in 1 year will definitely affect your homeowner's rates. Are you getting thousands of dollars of stuff stolen? If you're only getting a few hundred bucks for every claim it is not worth it to file again.
Insurance,34vp76,britt5689,3,Tue May 5 14:31:35 2015 UTC,"did you use the same insurance company for your homeowners insurance that you used for your renters insurance? What I'm getting at is that claim history (from a ""CLUE"" report) is usually attached to the RISK address, and not always the individual... So it may not even be a factor here.. But as gunjr mentioned- if its a relatively small amount don't claim it. And just FYI homewoner's insurance is not designed for smaller claims- they cost you more money in the long term. My rule of thumb is don't claim anything under 2,500 (I'm a broker)"
Insurance,34vp1f,ludecknight,5,Mon May 4 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"To the first question yes its perfectly legal to change your rates. Each zip code has its own rates because each place has its own crime rates, traffic issues, if you moved further from your work etc. When you originally get a policy its based off the address you provide, the vehicle you have and the info about the drivers of the vehicle. If one of those changes it changes the rates. Think of the people making the move the opposite way their rates are going down do you think it would be fair for the insurance company to charge the same premium?  To the second one I wouldnt have a clue."

Insurance,34vp1f,thelurkerabides,3,Tue May 5 02:31:16 2015 UTC,Your auto question has been answered so I wonder bother agreeing with everyone. For life you need to go sit down with an agent and discuss the different options for policies on her. I would suggest going to multiple agencies to get quotes. We can not give you a quote on here and do not know your complete situation. I would also take your mom and/or grandma since they are highly involved also.
Insurance,34vp1f,thelurkerabides,2,Tue May 5 00:13:50 2015 UTC,"Final expense protection is all your grandmother really needs at this point.  If she's younger than 80, you're still able to find something.  Lots of companies have senior plans.  However, it can get pretty expensive.  I would suggest possibly looking at whole life.  If the premiums seem high for the overall death benefit, look into a guarantee death benefit universal life policy.  It will be on average about 70% or so the price of the whole life in most circumstances for a greater face amount.  If you're still interested, let me know in a message.  I can put you in contact with someone in your area."
Insurance,34vp1f,thelurkerabides,1 point,Thu May 7 06:46:19 2015 UTC,1) Of course it is legal. Garaging address is a huge factor in insurance rates. Any time you change zip code you can expect your rates to change.  2) Credit and debt don't have anything to do with insurability or rates. The two biggest rating factors are age and health. Whether there are any cost efficient options would depend on those two things and your definition of cost efficient.
Insurance,34vp1f,thelurkerabides,1 point,Mon May 4 23:17:00 2015 UTC,It wasn't her insurability I was worried about. I just meant there wouldn't be anything life insurance would need to pay for besides funeral and burial costs.
Insurance,34w25j,combasemsthefox,4,Tue May 5 01:02:23 2015 UTC,You would need to review the specific wording of the warranty to see if your dad breached it. Keep in my mind that if there is any ambiguity in the wording (what would be a reasonable time to pull over?) it will likely be interpreted against the company.

This is very different than most main street insurance.  I do a lot of weird things, and I very occasionally (and always reluctantly) get involved in warranty stuff.  But basically, you need to review the contract between you and the warranty company. If you see something suspicious and want to ask specific questions, you might be best served by asking in /r/legalhelp.  That all said, this sounds suspicious, and third party warranties are notoriously narrowly worded products.  But without seeing the wording or knowing exactly what happened all I can do is suspect."
Insurance,34ti9t,IamAFlaw,10,Mon May 4 12:57:34 2015 UTC,"I do motor vehicle appraisals and IMHO they're taking a pretty high depreciation on it.   The question you want to ask of your local regulatory authority is if depreciation is allowed in your jurisdiction and if there is an upper percentage limit that's illegal or at least frowned upon.  I don't know what the rules are in Canada but I'd tend to disagree that a new steering rack adds any value to the vehicle and, as such, that it necessarily needs to be depreciated at all. Some carriers depreciate all sorts of suspension bits though, right down to shocks and struts and brake rotors.  I agree with you that depreciating the labor is bullshit. Maybe there's case law on-point on this topic in your jurisdiction but you're correct that the labor is the same whether the rack is new or old.   One other thing to check is whether they're actually knocking part of the money off because they don't cover above-OEM prices on aftermarket parts. Some policies (at least in the US) don't cover aftermarket upgrades so if the original rack was $1000 then all they cover is the $1,000 rack (minus any applicable depreciation), regardless of whether you paid $1,200 or $2,000 for it.  Barring you being able to point out some rule or insurance regulation that forbids this sort of depreciation, and getting them to change their tune, your only real option is taking them to court or exercising the appraisal clause (binding arbitration) if you have that in your insurance policy."
Insurance,34ti9t,Zen_Drifter,3,Mon May 4 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"This is spot on and needs to be higher in the thread (at least by typical US laws).  To me, the bottom line is a steering rack isn't a consumable part so there shouldn't be betterment taken on it. Even my cheap ass non-standard carrier wouldn't deduct on a steering rack. LKQ could usually be sourced but even if not we'd pay out for OEM.   Personally, if I were in OP's shoes I would ask for a supervisor to review and climb up the ladder from there."
Insurance,34ti9t,JeepGuy587,2,Mon May 4 23:26:52 2015 UTC,Even if I was depreciating a steering rack I doubt I would go anywhere near 50% on it.   A rack is meant to last more-or-less the reasonable life of the vehicle.  I think OP's best argument is to hand the insurer a manufacturer service schedule and ask them to point out where it says the rack should be replaced as part of regularly scheduled maintenance like a timing belt or a strut. I doubt it's even listed.
Insurance,34ti9t,Zen_Drifter,2,Mon May 4 23:55:09 2015 UTC,In Canada we do things a little differently op states the part cost 2100 when you depreciate it by 60% common in Canada you get the 800 which is being paid by the company. So the deduction would be for 1300 the responsibility of the insured for better. Now you factor in the cost of the insured deductible that will be charged outside of the betterment you get the 1800 op is referring to.   As far as whether or not the rack should be replaced according to manufacturer schedule that would be why the betterment is in place. The insured either can't find a suitable part of like kind and quality or the ones then can find are too beat up to use. Remember Canada has about 1/10th population of america and nova Scotia isn't Ontario or Quebec its relatively small. Finding a part could be near impossible or the shipping of the part could make it not cost effective.  As far a regulators its perfectly acceptable to charge betterment for something like this.   I would recommend trying to speak with the adjuster see if there is someone you can talk to to work things out. They might be able to cut you a break and split the difference or something. Don't go in there heated making comments about a supervisor. Canada's insurance industry is heavily regulated to the point where the insurance companies would rather cover something they should then deny something thar they aren't 100% sure on.

Insurance,34ti9t,ThaBoshtrich,2,Tue May 5 00:21:51 2015 UTC,I've written some depreciated steering racks for some carriers at their request (while working as an independent adjuster or body shop estimator) but it usually came down to giving the owner a choice between a used/remanufactured rack or a new rack that's depreciated to the same amount. I don't recall ever seeing somebody paying out of pocket for whichever the cheapest option was.

Insurance,34ti9t,dewprisms,13,Tue May 5 01:14:06 2015 UTC,"This is why it pays to actually read your policy, companies know that insureds never do, but its not our responsibility to force you.  That being said insurance  is a contract of indemnity, which means put you back in the same financial position as just prior to the loss. So if there is wear on a part and it need to be replace they either will find a used one if they can, which is might not even be possible. Or depending on the part itself sometimes the nature of it would prevent them from safely replacing the item with a used one.  When they do replace it putting you in a better position, which sounds to be the case here, they can have what's called a betterment charged. Sometimes they are relatively low in value and for customer service point of view we waive them. In this case when they have calculated it out to almost $2000 likelihood of it getting waive is very low."

Insurance,34vmfe,letuseatsnacks,2,Mon May 4 22:50:49 2015 UTC,"Your concerns are valid. And It is highly likely that if you go through with a third claim your home insurance will be non-renewed. You will still be able to get home insurance with another company, but you will have to go through a high-risk market and the premiums will be higher than what you have right now.  Please keep in mind, insurance is not meant for small claims like the ones you have had. It is there to protect you from financial ruin in the event of a large loss.  So when you repeatedly put through claims for small amounts you become undesirable to an insurance company."
Insurance,34vmfe,Cicatrized,2,Tue May 5 14:48:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, he's definitely running the risk of entering the territory of being non-renewed for claims frequency.  Then you get really hammered when you go and try to find new insurance and no one will insure you with 3 recent at-fault claims.  You'll end up in a high-risk pool through your state more than likely and pay a small fortune for that insurance.  Claims surcharges on your renters policy might not have been too bad because renters insurance is so cheap to begin with, but a claims history like that on a homeowners policy could costs you thousands of dollars per year extra.  You might end up paying more in surcharges on your homeowners insurance than you collected on claims."
Insurance,34vmfe,joeboo5150,2,Tue May 5 21:29:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would have advised you not to file for the $2,000 claim to begin with.  That said, the other posters are absolutely right.

Insurance,34tym4,Kickassness,2,Mon May 4 15:20:47 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with State Farm specifically. Generally insurance companies put speeding tickets into two different categories: major and minor. Anything 14-15MPH or more over the speed limit is a major ticket. Anything less than that is a minor ticket. Most of the companies I work with don't surcharge for minor tickets at all until you have 2-3 or more in the past three years. They surcharge for all major tickets. One company I work with surcharges for pretty much everything.  If you have an agent I would give them a call to find out more information. It's most likely irrelevant where the ticket happened. AFAIK most states share ticket information with each other.
Insurance,34tym4,dan_232,0,Mon May 4 16:11:42 2015 UTC,Do you know if you are in their standard or mutual company? If you are in mutual they do not run your MVR annually so they might not catch it. If you are in their standard company then they run your MVR every year and will catch it on your next renewal which could result in a rate increase.
Insurance,34tym4,silverr90,1 point,Mon May 4 15:50:37 2015 UTC,I have no idea. We go through a state farm agent so I'm assuming standard but idk
Insurance,34tym4,silverr90,0,Mon May 4 15:55:40 2015 UTC,It should be listed in your auto renewal information. Mutual  company just means you are getting their preferred rate. If you had a clean record before this incident then you are likely in mutual.
Insurance,34tym4,silverr90,1 point,Mon May 4 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"I will admit my wording is a little off. I wasn't really trying to define what a mutual company is, but it is true that most companies have stricter underwriting guidelines to make it into their mutual company and it is also true most people in mutual companies pay less premium then standard companies.  Also it is common knowledge in insurance underwriting that MVRs are not run after a certain point. Here is a quote from a recent article on insurancequotes.com ""Dan Weedin, an insurance and risk management consultant, says drivers who’ve never filed a claim and who’ve maintained a clean driving record for at least 10 years often go undetected when they get a traffic ticket"". I'm on mobile and will link later. I would argue that 10 years is being generous.   It's pretty frustrating that you shoot down what I wrote and don't contribute anything. I hope for the sake of your company that you fact check a little better before you give advice to customers."

I work for Farmers we only run MVRs on a small percentage of customers at renewal just because of the cost while other companies are every renewal. It all depends on the company. If I were OP honestly I would just not say anything to my agent and wait to see what happens.
Insurance,34tym4,eastindywalrus,1 point,Mon May 4 18:24:52 2015 UTC,"Same here. NYAgent112 is incorrect. I work for a large, nationwide insurer - we most certainly do not run MVRs at every renewal. We'd bankrupt ourselves in a heartbeat if we did that. Our system will automatically run MVRs if you had a moving violation on your license in the previous term, if you're a very young driver, etc. Generally speaking, if I'm reviewing a renewal, I'll manually run an MVR if you've had an at-fault accident in the last term, if you've had a history of other violations, if you're a kid and your license hasn't been run in 3-4 years, or if I read claim notes that indicate you were a jerk to any of our claim representatives."
Insurance,34tym4,PA-Agent-Broker,3,Mon May 4 22:46:40 2015 UTC,"Not really, I got a couple carriers that won't run MVRs at renewal unless they had a reason to, eg. claim or got picked up at random."
Insurance,34tym4,HackPhilosopher,2,Wed May 6 21:14:52 2015 UTC,"Big insurance companies, unless you are in a high risk placement won't run your MVR every year. That would be millions upon millions of dollars thrown away just to try and ""catch"" someone for an extra $100 a year. StateFarm most likely has a high risk policy they provide and those with it will have their mvr rerun upon renewal. But as for general policies, they most likely won't rerun it.  Lets say Statefarm has over 10 million drivers insured, That is 10 million MVRs they have to pay for every 6 months or a year. No way would a company pay for that overhead."

That's going to be state-specific though, and a better question for /r/legaladvice.  From an insurance perspective, there's nothing really that you can do.  Sometimes insurers catch out of state tickets and sometimes they don't.  You may get lucky."

You're clearly already suspicious of repair procedures and if that's your mindset, you're never going to be happy with the repairs, even if they're perfect.  You should hope they find more damage ($3K more) after the teardown.  Or, sell it as soon as it's fixed and document the hit you took on the sale price and make a Diminished Value claim, if you can."

If so you're 100% at fault, if he is over the line it does not mean anything unfortunately, you still hit a fixed object/stationary vehicle. Call your insurance and setup a claim.

Insurance,34tznq,broseph23,1 point,Mon May 4 15:59:50 2015 UTC,"So I called Uhaul/Safemove to set up a claim. Should I call Geico (personal insurance) as well even though I was driving a vehicle they exempt from their coverage? If they aren't going to provide any help, I'd rather they didn't even know about the accident."
Insurance,34tznq,f1shbone,3,Mon May 4 16:03:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. No coverage under UHaul for third party damages means your insurance, Geico, is primary for liability and they will take care of damages to that pick-up truck. Call them to turn the claim in, that is all you have to do. They will handle it from there. This will be a coverage question they need to conclude since you were not driving your own vehicle (easy and straight forward), so you want to make sure you send in to them the rental agreement you signed, to expedite things. You should have a copy, if not, ask for it from UHaul."
Insurance,34tznq,f1shbone,1 point,Mon May 4 16:07:43 2015 UTC,"OK looks like I understand. I looked into my Geico policy and it states the following exclusion:    In addition to the above exclusion for the business of selling, servicing, repairing or parking autos, while anyone is using a vehicle in the course of any business. This exclusion also applies to private passenger autos, pick-up trucks, vans, and similar vehicles used for the delivery or transportation of goods or materials unless such use is incidental to your business of installing, maintaining, or repairing furnishings or equipment.  I don't think that exempts them from payment, but do you have a different translation?     Ninja edit: Never mind. That doesn't even mention trucks."
Insurance,34tznq,Grumplstilskin,3,Mon May 4 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"No, that exclusion doesn't come into play at all. Were you using  the UHaul for business purposes? Were you being paid  by someone? If not, the exclusion doesn't apply. If that exclusion were in play, it would mean that Geico is not providing liability coverage to you for the damage to the other car, which would mean you would be in a world of hurt."
Insurance,34tznq,f1shbone,2,Mon May 4 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of personal auto policies will have exclusions for large vehicles such as these, check the exclusions section on your auto policy under the liability section."
Insurance,34tznq,Cicatrized,2,Mon May 4 18:47:58 2015 UTC,"A 26 foot moving truck is very commonly used by people to haul their own stuff. I would be surprised if Geico had an exclusion on their standard policy that would kick this out from liability coverage. Geico is using standard policies, which actually give coverage back. Exclusions will read ""this exclusion does not apply to the use of a private passenger car"". Had numerous claims like this and have yet to hear it being excluded. It should be covered under a standard form policy."
Insurance,34tznq,Grumplstilskin,1 point,Mon May 4 18:54:32 2015 UTC,"Actually one of the companies I used to work for had it written into their policy that the liability would only extend to a ""private passenger vehicle"", so for them a moving truck was definitely not covered."

Insurance,34tznq,f1shbone,1 point,Mon May 4 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with the other two replies to this, I've seen it excluded based on GVW as opposed to ""private passenger vehicle""."
Insurance,34tznq,Phil_Achio,2,Mon May 4 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"Specifically excluded under language for liability coverage, or do you mean defined as a term in the policy language? Because there is a difference here. Just because it is a defined term does not mean it is excluded. I used to get a lot of calls from agents concerned over the fact that private passenger car was a defined term, with a quoted gross vehicle weight of 10,000 lb. It didn't matter, because there was no exclusion under liability to kick out coverage for this kind of UHaul. In fact, many agents would advise insureds to purchase the extra coverage, which was not needed."
Insurance,34tv7z,Mahaleck,3,Mon May 4 14:54:16 2015 UTC,"The speed you were going over will matter if it changes the ticket from a minor infraction to a major infraction.  For example, in Alberta going 25km over is considered a minor ticket. You can have 2 minor tickets with little-to-no impact on your policy. A 3rd minor ticket will cause a surcharge on the premiums.  In Alberta, going 50km over is considered a major conviction. As soon as you have 1 major conviction you will see an increase.  I would check with your local registry and see if 45km is considered minor or major in Ontario."
Insurance,34tv7z,Cicatrized,4,Mon May 4 15:17:07 2015 UTC,"To answer this 45km/h is definitely a major conviction. 5 more km/h and you lose you license, I'm not sure where the line between minoer and major is as I'm not an underwriter, but I would be willing o bet its major."
Insurance,34tv7z,Phil_Achio,4,Mon May 4 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that it was a minor conviction if it is 49 km/h or less over the limit; 50 km/h or more is a major conviction. Tried looking it up in the HTA but it doesn't actually classify things as minor or major... closest I can find is a difference in fines per km over in S.128(14):   ""Every person who contravenes this section or any by-law or regulation made under this section is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable, where the rate of speed at which the motor vehicle was driven... (c) is 30 kilometres per hour or more but less than 50 kilometres per hour over the speed limit, to a fine of $7 for each kilometre per hour that the motor vehicle was driven over the speed limit; and (d) is 50 kilometres per hour or more over the speed limit, to a fine of $9.75 for each kilometre per hour that the motor vehicle was driven over the speed limit.  2005, c. 26, Sched. A, s. 17 (7).""  Random internet searches turn up high risk broker sites also indicating the line between major and minor is at 50 km/h.  What that means for the insurance rates though can vary by company -- the company I used to work for didn't surcharge for 1 minor conviction, another I worked for added 5% for the first minor."
Insurance,34tv7z,jenjam85,0,Mon May 4 18:06:16 2015 UTC,Minor and major determinations are made by the insurance company and not the OTA. This would almost certainly be major under most major carrier policies but you can call your adjuster to be sure.
Insurance,34tv7z,ihideindarkplaces,2,Mon May 4 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on the insurance company. For example, in Progressive, a speeding ticket is a speeding ticket and they count them all the same, but in AAA insurance the high the amount over the limit, the more they charge you on your insurance."
Insurance,34tv7z,britt5689,1 point,Mon May 4 15:17:27 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, it will depend on where the line between Minor and Major conviction lies. This definition and how they get rated for may vary from company to company. At the very least, you're going to lose any Conviction Free Discount you might have.  However, finding out about the conviction is not automatic. Companies have to actually check your MVR to find out about any new convictions and they don't do this every renewal for every driver."
Insurance,34ty0g,ThatDidntJustHappen,10,Mon May 4 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"Yes it does. The trim level in encoded into the VIN number so when your agent types in your VIN, they'll know the specific year, make, model, and trim level."

Interesting, because a VIN will not have this info unless these options are part of a standard dealer package for that particular trim. The obvious question becomes, when I am looking up vehicle valuations in NADA, why do I get any choices for options besides just decoding a VIN?"
Insurance,34ty0g,f1shbone,2,Mon May 4 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"Usually only the dealer can pull it up to that level of detail.  When we type the VIN into a standard decoding program like one used for collision estimating it will pull up all the standard equipment that decodes to that VIN and then it leave check boxes open for selecting other options.   So when you put in a VIN for a Toyota Camry the system knows it's a Camry but you have to select  plain, CE, LE, SE, etc..  On other cars it may decode down to the trim level but you have to manually select for sunroof, leather seats, nav systems, etc..  If you call the dealer then they're not ""decoding"" the VIN per se, they're just pulling up the build sheet for that particular car as it exists in their database from when they originally built it."
Insurance,34ty0g,Zen_Drifter,1 point,Mon May 4 22:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get where people get it from. I got someone said they got a green car, so their rate should be higher right?  Or the lady who got a red car.  I was like, not sure who you talk to, but color don't matter."

If you mean vehicle options and denonimations like S, SL, SE, etc, then no, the VIN will not have this info. Those are option packages."
Insurance,34ty0g,f1shbone,6,Mon May 4 16:16:27 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for all insurance companies, but the ones I represent do know the difference based on the VIN. For example, if I type in my VIN number my system knows it's a Honda Accord EX 4.3 V6 VTec. I do have one or two high risk companies that would only show it as a Honda Accord 4.3 V6 and nothing more. It really depends on the company and how up to date their rating software is."

Which is why the car rental places provide an additional cost for insurance or if you already had a policy, most carriers will extend coverage over to a rental.  To put it simply, if you need coverage for a month, you may have to purchase their insurance as it may be difficult to convince an agent to write an application for a car you don't own.

Insurance,34sopw,britt5689,1 point,Mon May 4 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"Technically, you can. However, that is if an agent is willing to write a policy knowing you'll be cancelling. The shortest terms you'll find are likely 6 months. And yes, you would only be charged for the time you have the policy but what everyone else said it would be that non-named owner policy. But again, that is if an agent is willing to do it."

The only way to find this out is to get the dealer or any shop capable of interfacing with the car to hook up an OBD tool and read what tune it is running. Modded cars are modded to go faster than factory. This may or may not mean a higher probability that the owner ran the car hard. You'll have to decide if you want to bite the bullet with this one or not. You may want to have a mechanic take another look at the car and see what they can spot, or simply shop for another car if you're not sure what you're getting into."

A broker might try to push you into something you don't need. Start off shopping for 20 year term policies but quote out what 30 years would be depending on your situation. You can always buy more later.  You want to have insurance as long as someone is dependent on your income. So in most cases, your kid is going to be under you until age 22ish so a 20 year term might be just enough coverage--unless you keep popping out babies.   There are two philosophies on determining need: 1) sum of all debts and future debts (education expenses for kids). That way if you kicked the bucket, your husband could just pay everything off but be living on just his income. 2) and in my opinion, better, get 10-12 times your annual income. If you die, your husband can invest benefit and pull 7-8% off so there's not a huge lifestyle change. He might not be able to pay off all debts all at once, but he could replace your income that way.  If you don't have a job, it'd still be good to consider the costs of raising children with just one parent--pre-school, after school care, etc."

Insurance,34oh02,snooze_sensei,4,Sun May 3 01:35:26 2015 UTC,"The car you have must have a really bad safety rating, or really expensive replacement parts, or both. You cannot compare you rates to somebody else who is paying full coverage on a used Honda. Also, your zip code plays a pretty big factor in your rates as well. This is why it's important to check insurance rates before you purchase a vehicle to know what you're getting into."
Insurance,34oh02,britt5689,6,Sun May 3 21:59:19 2015 UTC,Is it possible that postmarketing experience with the Fiats is revealing a higher claim frequency or claim payout profile?  It unfortunately appears that your car has made the worst to insure list for a couple years now:  http://www.insure.com/car-insurance/passenger-injuries-2014.html
Insurance,34oh02,original_evanator,5,Sun May 3 04:20:38 2015 UTC,"Couple things...   Obviously, your rates are going to be higher with a brand new vehicle.  Different companies use different models for insurance scores. I would read less into what CreditKarma tells you, and more into your actual credit score - 700, which isn't that good, in reality. This number will have a significant impact on all of your different insurance scores with various carriers. Rates may be steadily increasing in the parts of the state that you've been living. Actuarial data is being adjusted/improved constantly. Some companies adjust their rates more often than others. Texas is also a file-and-use state, meaning companies don't have to wait for approval for their new rates from the state - they can implement them and use them while the state reviews them. If there are any issues, refunds can result. But this will mean that your company is likely going to be updating their rates more often than in other states (which are limited in number, in all fairness).   Of those 3 things, number 2 is the one that stands out to me the most. Despite what a lot of people think, 700 isn't a very good credit score. Work on improving this, and you'll most likely see your rates drop significantly."
Insurance,34oh02,eastindywalrus,4,Sun May 3 02:11:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know your situation obviously, so I'm not stating this as absolute fact:  The first thing that jumped out to me when your quotes jumped from 110 to 197 is a lapse in coverage.  Given all the other things that you listed it makes the most sense. Were you with progressive for years before your swap? If not it could have happened before that. If so then perhaps during your swap to Geico.  If Geico already had you quoted and in the system, it could be an easy oversight locking in your rate with them not realizing your policy canceled a week ago.   However, getting quotes from any company other than Geico would easily recognize the gap in coverage since they didn't already have a quote run on you before the gap happened. That may not be the case, but mistakes happen. The Progressive agent could have accidentally put the date in one week earlier than the Wednesday you were talking about. Or the Geico agent could have thought you said next Wednesday instead of this Wednesday.   Also, in my experience, bill pay history matters much more than numerical credit score. I've seen peoples quotes go up by 20-30% requoting them a year later with one maybe two bills being 30 days late.  I would check with the person you most recently got a quote from, and see if maybe he can check on what his system says about your insurance history. If he seems like an experienced agent, ask him to see if he notices anything that jumps out to him as to what might be driving your rate so high.  Rates don't just jump for one person randomly, every aspect is rated in tiers and after a while with the same company, it's pretty easy to gather why the price is what it is.  If I quote three people and the same coverage comes back at 90, 130, and 160, I know exactly where to look to get confirmation as to what is changing the price. If you paying 80% more than the majority of people, it should be relatively easy for the agent to find the discrepancy.   Best of luck, let me know if you have any other questions!"
Insurance,34oh02,scatterbastard,1 point,Sun May 3 05:04:33 2015 UTC,Most of the other responses are right. You are checking all the right boxes to get a good rate. The only other variables are location and vehicle type. All you can do is check around and compare the rates. I always recommend checking with an independent agent since they can check rates with companies that you can't check directly. I'll message you some info.

It sounds like your company treats an open container ticket equal to a DUI. How your state treats a ticket has nothing to do with how your insurance company treats it.

Lots of companies do it, they just don't advertise it much because not that many people are in your situation.  I would guess it'd be somewhere between $50 and $100/month and covers liability.  It doesn't include comp/collision (damage to the rental car itself), so you'd have to see if you can purchase that separately with Enterprise or rent the smallest, least valuable cars and retain that exposure."

They offer Collision Damage Waiver protection, which covers the value of the car in case of damage or theft. If the accident is your fault, it doesn't cover their car, property damage, or any injuries.  Enterprise sells 4 types of insurance and CDW is one of them. You have to decline CDW for the credit card to cover it, but now you still have the other three insurance to worry about:   Personal Accident Insurance (covers injuries, may overlap with health insurance) Supplemental Liability Protection (covers the other party) Roadside Assistance (tow trucks, etc)   Most full-coverage auto insurance includes this."

Insurance,34nvc4,Sauburo,1 point,Tue May 5 13:40:14 2015 UTC,I took a look at the photos. I'm not entirely sure what you want them to claim? There is no evidence of hail damage to the shingles. That just shows some dinged up dents. We see old damaged vents all the time. We also see damage to vents but no damage to shingles (generally on newer roofs).   If that is all you have you don't exactly have a strong case. Vents can be replaced.
Insurance,34nvc4,Phil_Achio,6,Wed May 6 00:25:04 2015 UTC,"Well there is a lot of info that is needed here before anyone can really make a call as to what might have happened. How old is the roof and anyt of the other things involved? Was it 30 years old and then the hail storm happened? So the roof already needed to be replaced. Are you in an area where there was a previous hail storm a few years prior and the adjuster could not determine when the damage is really from?  The contractor would say something like that, but essentially what it comes down to they were most likely told that they wouldnt get paid to do the work. So they kinda but not really were ordered to deny it. They have absolutely call what so ever as to what claims do or don't get paid. It comes down what the policy wordings and what the adjuster finds.  Attorneys arent really a good route to go, most insurance companies have their own lawyers too. The difference is their lawyers are on retainer where your lawyer is gonna charge you for every hour of work they put in. Hell I work at the second largest insurance company in Canada we have 23 lawyers on salary. With the difference in population s between America and Canada our second largest could easily be an average size company south of the border.   Believe or not a lot has change in the insurance industry from what people think it is. Take a look at a few of the other threads here and people are genuinely trying to help others out. Now put that into propestive, why would they do that to a policyholder? Because maybe the damages that you see as obvious hail isn't hail damage at all. I'm not saying you're wrong it could be just that but there could be some very big underlying issues that aren't coming out here.  I have paid out on claims for a couple hundred to thousands of dollars just because we couldn't say one way or another what caused the issue so we paid to keep client happy. But I've seen things that very clearly aren't something that would be covered not paid because we are sure. And generally insurance has heavy regulations in place, then have a bad public opinion and they don't want things to go to court. If they screw up they are the ones who get screwed in court so they don't like to deny things for the sake if denying things they will probably have a very big reason to deny it."

While I'm assertive and I stand up for my clients I always go out of my way to be polite and professional to all of the adjusters I meet with because we can make this job as pleasant or as unpleasant as we want.  I don't yell, scream, threaten, lie, cheat, steal or any of the other things that bad PA's have done.

Insurance,34izhb,key2616,2,Fri May 1 16:05:09 2015 UTC,Product Tampering and Recall (it's on the same policy) and an Umbrella to give you higher liability limits.
Insurance,34izhb,key2616,2,Fri May 1 16:14:51 2015 UTC,I confirmed that it does contain a 1mil/2mil liability coverage.  Will get workers comp once we hire employees.   What is an appropriate amount for an umbrella policy if I already 1mil/2mil liability in the BOP?
Insurance,34izhb,NYAgent112,3,Fri May 1 16:29:15 2015 UTC,"It depends on your sales, but as a rule of thumb I'd say somewhere between $1M and $5M assuming sales of >$1M."
Insurance,34izhb,NYAgent112,3,Fri May 1 16:30:21 2015 UTC,"Just to add, you never said where you are located.  Depending on where that is, you may need a disability policy for your employees as well."
Insurance,34izhb,forneusFQ,2,Fri May 1 17:30:15 2015 UTC,I'm in Texas. not sure about disability but I know WC is a must.
Insurance,34izhb,NYAgent112,3,Fri May 1 17:31:27 2015 UTC,Looks like it's not required in Texas.  You're good.
Insurance,34izhb,aedmiston,3,Fri May 1 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"It's complicated in TX. If you choose not to have WC, you still have to file a non-subscription form with the state every year and still have to report employee injuries to the state. You have to post signs in English and Spanish in the workplace letting your workers know they're not covered. It's really best to have it."
Insurance,34izhb,IntricatelySimple,2,Fri May 1 21:02:39 2015 UTC,I was talking about a state disability policy.  But that's good to know.  Thanks.
Insurance,34izhb,key2616,3,Mon May 4 13:00:21 2015 UTC,"Work Comp is optional in Texas, actually. You're an idiot if you don't take out a policy, but you're not legally required to purchase the insurance."
Insurance,34izhb,key2616,2,Fri May 1 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"Good info, and I got a laugh."
Insurance,34k5g9,WildHoneyChild,2,Fri May 1 21:15:12 2015 UTC,It will get a little better every year (assuming you don't screw up).  If you don't already get it the good driver discount will kick in after 3 years of driving experience.  After that the next big break is after 9 years of driving experience or 25.

Insurance,34jkaw,starbuck88,1 point,Fri May 1 18:20:49 2015 UTC,"If that's the plan that you're on then $15 is the correct amount. Just make sure that the provider is in network and you're good to go.  (often times offices draw blood and send it to a lab. You may not be protected if the lab turns out to be out of network, so make sure. ask questions)"
Insurance,34jkaw,Waldoh,1 point,Fri May 1 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely call your insurance company if you haven't already. The link you provided is costs ""at a glance,"" meaning there could be fine print and what not. Also, there isn't any description of what is defined as a ""diagnostic lab"". When you call, make sure you get the person's name that you're speaking to as well in case the bill comes back as more.  (Also note: Insurance companies love to say that even if you do call and ask for quotes, it's not guaranteed. This is why the healthcare system needs work.)  Lastly, make sure whoever does the actual labwork is in network, as the other commenter mentioned. It would also be wise to check with your insurance company about additional costs. For instance, there might be an office visit co-pay to get blood taken and then the charges for the labwork."

Insurance,34j8id,09SThr,3,Fri May 1 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"Is there any way to undo filing through my job plan and file through my mom plan so I can get closer to meeting the lower deductible?   Usually plans are labeled primary and secondary. Your employer's plan is probably your primary plan. Usually what happens is that any part of a bill that would be your responsibility after sending a claim to the primary insurance will then get billed to the secondary insurance.  So what probably should have happened is that your doctor sent a claim to your primary insurance, which resulted in a $400 bill. That then should have been sent to your mother's insurance, which also would have resulted in a $400 bill. You then pay $400 out of your HSA. However, you are $400 closer to meeting the deductible for both insurance plans.  I would contact your medical provider to make sure they sent a claim to both of your insurance providers. You can also double check with your mother's insurance to verify that you are $400 closer to meeting your deductible.  Another thing to keep in mind is that it often isn't worth it to pay for double coverage. If your premiums are very cheap, or your employer contributes to your HSA it may be worth it[edit: Or if you expect to continue to have a very large amount of medical expenses]. Otherwise you may want to consider dropping your employer's insurance plan during your next open enrollment until you turn 26."
Insurance,34j8id,saivode,1 point,Fri May 1 17:04:27 2015 UTC,"It was a new doctor and I only gave them my job insurance card, I didn't even think about the mom plan. Should I call them and see if they can add it?"
Insurance,34j8id,Waldoh,5,Fri May 1 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"You might be in a bigger pickle than you realize. If you're covered by a plan that's not a HDHP (HSA qualified) then you are not eligible for a HSA. Your mom's coverage makes you ineligible for the tax benefits of the HSA, and will likely have to claim any contributions to the HSA as income.   You need to talk to your employer"
Insurance,34j8id,saivode,1 point,Fri May 1 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"Hah, I didn't even think about that."
