debian,3e4zvc,umpc,3,Wed Jul 22 00:41:44 2015 UTC,"Users on a Linux system should be able to see a lot more than their own home directories, that's normal. But if they can peer into each others files (without the file owner explicitly making the files world-readable), permissions may have been set up incorrectly."
debian,3e4zvc,ArthurOnCode,6,Wed Jul 22 00:35:44 2015 UTC,"The standard umask is 022, so peoples home directories are ordinarily readable (but not writable) to everyone. It's easy for users to chmod their home directories if they don't want that, or to set the umask in ~/.profile (for users) or /etc/profile (for the sysadmin to configure it globally) to change the default."

I think dual booting with windows is fine to test the debian system and see if you like it, but once you decide that you want to go with it, then I would just install it on the whole drive. Your learning curve might be steep, but you will force yourself to learn much faster than if you keep turning back to windows.  I started using linux with a dual boot but it did not take long before I made a clean break from windows. Now Debian is easy to install and easy to use. On my laptop everything - except my wifi card - configured automatically. My tip to you would be to use the 'Synaptic package manager' to search and install the software you want. It is easy to install software at the command line with 'apt-get' but I just think synaptics makes it easier to search for stuff."

Debian is worth a shot though. Even if it just helps you narrow down where the issue is.  Let me give you some advice first: Google.  If you are unsure about a particular piece of hardware working with Linux you can use google to find out. Be sure to get which version of the linux kernel works with your hardware. This is important because Debian - as a enterprise distro - is very conservative about updating the kernel. You may need a later version of the kernel for your hardware to work properly.  Just search: hardwarename debian. You should find the information you need."

Debian is the stable workhorse, and Ubuntu is a little more cutting edge (not as much as other systems like Arch).  Ubuntu has a lot more PPAs and packages available, while on Debian, you may need to have to compile programs on your own.  For example, MakeMKV, Handbrake, and a couple 3D printer programs were available as packages in the Ubuntu repos, but on Debian I needed to download the source and binary files and install them.

Not necessarily disk space, although it does, but more the memory and processor usage of having an active desktop environment.  Depending on the DE it can take a good amount of resource to run it.  Now if this is a beast server and you are only using a small portion of it's capabilities then go for it.  Better yet would be to spend the time learning how to manage it a little more proficiently by using the command line.  Once you get a really good handle on using the command line you'll find that quite a bit of stuff is quicker and sometimes easier without using a GUI.  This is especially true if you are managing it remotely.  Learning to do what you need to over a quick SSH session is much better than trying to get a GUI going remotely."

No offense, but  if someone installed  X11 / Xorg  on one of my Linux servers,  there would be hellfire coming down upon them,  because virtualization nodes should be headless ---  no GUI,  under normal circumstances,  no Keyboard or Display anyways.  The last thing you want in a virtualization setup is the host node running such things which compete for resources with the things the server is supposed to be doing  and can freeze up the entire system, if there is a bug in a display driver.  Of course if the machine is just hosting a Windows 7 VM,  then it's probably not a critical system."

Luckly since Tanglu Bartholomea was released in the same period, this release (if I understood how Tanglu is developed) should be very close to Jessie, but they instead decided to include it.  I doesn't feel like that version is production-ready, so I understand the decision not to include it. Most packages are missing the screenshots and the valutation.
