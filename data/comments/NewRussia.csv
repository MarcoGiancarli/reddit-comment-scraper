It is clear though which ever way you slice it you have Ukrainian soldiers firing on unarmed civilians and then run away. It is shameful, it is cowardly and, if it had been called a war, it would be a war crime."

NewRussia,3burix,3rim,2,Thu Jul 2 09:05:39 2015 UTC,"TAKEN FROM COMMENTS:   Vaska X Tumir MA    Why did Gysi lie at 6:40, claiming that Putin had done exactly the same as Barroso did when he tried to blackmail Yanukovich, i.e. that Putin, too, confronted Ukraine with an ultimatum, using economic pressure for political ends when the facts are otherwise?  In November 2013, the EU, in the person of Barroso, attempted to blackmail Ukraine into signing an association agreement with the EU at the price of foregoing any similar arrangements with the Russian Federation.  This was in direct breach of Article 3 of the Budapest Memorandum of 1994.  In December of 2013 and again in January 2014, Russia, in the person of Putin, offered three-way talks and negotiations for a way out of the increasingly dangerous impasse in Ukraine -- and offered the open prospect of a Ukraine free to form trade agreements with both the EU and the Russian Federation.  Gysi must have been aware of this in March 2014, when he gave this relatively courageous speech.  So why did he choose to lie about it and claim that BOTH the EU and Russia had presented Yanukovich with an ultimatum, i.e. that both are to blame for what took place in Ukraine between January and March 2014?  Disappointing to find that even the German left is too scared (""circumspect"") to speak truth to power."

While the EU is doing an open politic to gain influence, the German left takes arguments of a type like there is just a difference in the evaluation of the situation, which makes them pretty stupid."

NewRussia,3befgv,veritanuda,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"Such type of buildings are everywhere in Russia, in every city, and in Donbass of course too. This style has come from the Soviet era when the people were given the apartments from the State for free and the house building was quick, on a massive scale and of the same style and quality. This is why they all look similar.  What strikes me the most on this photo is the sharp contrast between death and life. Completely dead apartment house and full of life a kid enjoying short moment of non-shelling. And what is much more striking is to imagine that, perhaps, this the same day or night this lovely girl may be found among the maimed or dead victims of the next Ukrainian shelling...  It remains really impossible to comprehend such naked aggression, such ugly desacralization of human lives and the total absurdity of this, and any other mass murders :("
NewRussia,3befgv,veritanuda,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:02:36 2015 UTC,It does bring it home how visceral the feelings must be seeing the world around you being destroyed with little if any sense. The fact life goes on does show me how people are people despite the circumstances and the spirit to not give up not give in is far stronger than attachment to chattels and possessions.  I find it impossible not to empathise.
NewRussia,3b3pk2,3rim,0,Thu Jun 25 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"What a load of bullshit. Russian imperialism is corrupting and ruining Eastern Ukraine. The evil forces supporting the Ukrainian ""rebels"" are the true nazis."
